      "text": "× Like Love Meow on Facebook \nA little ginger boy was born one week before his littermates. He was the tiniest thing they had seen but the little baby had so much fight in him. \nMeet Peanut the cat! Courtesy of Crys Malone \nPeanut was born a week before two of his siblings. As a tiny preemie baby , the size of his human mom's thumb, he fought hard to live. \nHe was so small after birth that his cat mother didn't believe he would survive. \"His momma is a farm cat. Shortly after his birth his mother disappeared. She thought he was going to die and left him,\" Crys Malone told Love Meow . \nLittle Peanut barely had any fur and couldn't regulate his body temperature. He had trouble breathing, and needed immediate help and lots of TLC. \nThe family began to feed the tiny baby every two hours and kept him warm on their chests. Courtesy of Crys Malone \nA week after having Peanut, his cat mama returned and surprised the family with two more babies. They were born healthy and were bigger than Peanut in size. \nAt one week, little Peanut had finally grown big enough to fill his human mom's palm. Courtesy of Crys Malone \nWhen they reintroduced Peanut to mama, she took to him and started grooming and caring for her baby as if she was overjoyed to know that her miracle kitten survived. Courtesy of Crys Malone \nPeanut caught up in size and became fluffier than ever. Courtesy of Crys Malone ",

(Patrick Sullivan/The Times-News via AP) People take photos of a wildfire burning near Lake Lure, N.C., Thursday, Nov. 10, 2016. A state of emergency is in effect for 25 western North Carolina counties where active wildfires are burning, caused by the drought that began last spring. Gov. Pat McCrory said in a news release Thursday that he was declaring the state of emergency for one-quarter of North Carolina's 100 counties. (Patrick Sullivan/The Times-News via AP) \nThe area is less than 50 miles from North Carolina’s Nantahala National Forest, where more than 20 wildfires that have burned more than 17,000 acres are all “being investigated for suspected arson,” forestry officials announced in a status update. \nThere were 14 other wildfires burning on Cherokee Nation land in North Carolina, all under investigation by local law enforcement. A fire managers’ update noted that the U.S. Bureau of Indian Affairs is seeking information about fires on Indian lands through an arson hotline. \nStates of emergency were declared in some of the affected areas to facilitate state and federal spending on the response. \nMore than 5,000 firefighters and support staff from around the nation have joined the effort, said Shardul Raval, director of fire and aviation management for the southern region of the U.S. Forest Service. About 40 aircraft are involved, including three large air tankers flying out of Chattanooga, Tennessee. \nThe national drought report shows 41.6 million people in parts of 15 Southern states living in drought conditions. The worst is in Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi and Tennessee, but extreme drought also is spreading into the western Carolinas. Kentucky, Tennessee and North Carolina all have fierce fires. \nOne of the largest blazes was spreading rapidly in the Cohutta Wilderness area just south of the Georgia-Tennessee line. Nearly 300 people are battling that fire, which already consumed about 15 square miles, the Forest Service said. \nSmoke from the fires has made North Carolina’s largest city a Code Orange zone for air quality, meaning anyone with breathing problems could suffer. The Charlotte Observer reports that the heavy haze and smoky conditions should make people limit outdoor activities. \nThat apparently isn’t stopping organizers of this weekend’s Charlotte Marathon. They said Friday that they do not expect the wildfire smoke to impact Saturday’s races, which include a marathon, half-marathon, 5K run/walk, marathon relay and a kids 1-mile fun run. \n___ \nReynolds Yonker reported from Louisville, Kentucky.

Inevitably, we start sharing each other’s technology and even our passwords.\nBut your device says a lot about you: Your pastimes, your taste in music, your curiosities and the things you shop for. So how do you maintain your privacy online, even with the people who are closest to you?\nHere are a few simple tricks to help you keep your secrets under wraps.

If something isn’t located in the menus precisely as I say, look around for a similar action.)\nAmazon \nAmazon tracks not only what you have purchased, but also what you have browsed. If you share an Amazon account, both can pose a major problem especially this time of year.\nThe good news is that you can easily cover your tracks. To erase your browsing history, from your account settings, look for the Personalization section. Go to Personalized Content >> View and Manage Your Browsing History. Here, you have a few options. You can remove only certain items or all items as well as turn off browsing history, so you never have this issue again.\nLet’s say you want to make it more difficult for someone to find out what you have ordered. Amazon will not completely delete your order history, but you can archive individual orders. Casual snoops will have a harder time seeing what you have purchased. From your account settings, go to Your Orders. Select the item you wish to hide and select Archive order.\nYou can use the Amazon app as an additional holiday security measure. Suppose you have purchased a pair of shoes for your spouse, you’ve archived the order, and now you’re waiting for the package to arrive. But you’re receiving so many boxes this time of year, how do you know which delivery to open and wrap?\nWith the Amazon app, you can scan the barcode on the box to immediately find out what’s inside. It works like a charm – unless your spouse has secretly ordered something for you!\nBy the way, Amazon has added a slew of new benefits for Prime members from unlimited photo storage to free ebooks. Click here for seven Amazon Prime perks you’re probably not using. \nGoogle \nGoogle often auto-completes your search terms based on personal information, such as your location and previous searches. Anyone looking over your shoulder or borrowing your device might be surprised by the guesses Google makes. Google products that collect your information include Chrome, Google Maps, and YouTube.\nTo delete your search history on Google, you need a Google account. Just log in, go to My Activity, and remove items individually.\nBetter yet, take control of the data Google saves about you. Click here for step-by-step instructions on how to stop Google from collecting data about you. \nMost browsers have a similarly easy way to delete your browsing history, and the controls tend to be in your browser’s preferences. Keep this in mind, especially if you’re researching something a little unusual.\nFacebook \nFor many of us, Facebook is like a sprawling digital yearbook. Maybe you have a family computer, and you usually forget to log out of Facebook. Other people use the same computer, they stumble into your Facebook account, and they notice your conspicuous search history.\nYour significant other may wonder why you’ve become so curious about the person you once invited to the prom, no matter how innocent your interest.\nThe easiest way to avoid an awkward conversation is to open your Activity Log on your Facebook page. Select More from the column at left >> Search >> Clear Searches. Or you can remove each search item one by one.\nYour Facebook Activity Log stores a lot of data about you. Click here for tips to clean it up and prevent things from coming back to haunt you. \nNetflix \nWe all have our guilty pleasures, especially when it comes to movies. You may have privately viewed Lars Von Trier’s \"Nymphomaniac\" and thought it was a great work of art-house cinema, but that could be hard to explain to a roomful of people.\nIf you want to hide past screenings, just go to My Account >> Viewing History. Be advised that items aren’t always deleted immediately; it may take 24 hours for your lists to update on all devices.\nNetflix also allows you to create multiple profiles. Many households don’t bother with this unless they have children, but if you want to keep your viewing history private, you can create a personal profile and protect it with a password. Click here to learn how to do this as well as access secret Netflix categories. \nGo incognito \nEvery major web browser including Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Internet Explorer, Safari, and Opera has private, or incognito, browsing settings. Turning this feature on means your browser will ignore cookies including ad-tracking cookies and won't record your browsing history. It's almost like you weren't online. Click here to learn how to enable this simple step to keep your browsing history a secret. \nMaintaining privacy is one of my favorite themes.

      "text": "GIF Illustration by Jim Cooke \nDepending on whom you ask, Facebook is either the savior or destroyer of journalism in our time. An estimated 600 million people see a news story on Facebook every week, and the social network’s founder Mark Zuckerberg has been transparent about his goal to monopolize digital news distribution. “When news is as fast as everything else on Facebook, people will naturally read a lot more news,” he said in a Q&A last year , adding that he wants Facebook Instant Articles to be the “primary news experience people have.” Advertisement \nFacebook’s stranglehold over the traffic pipe has pushed digital publishers into an uneasy alliance with the $350 billion behemoth, and the news business has been caught up in a jittery debate about what, precisely, the company’s intentions are. Will it swallow the business whole , or does it really just want publishers to put neat things in users’ news feeds ? For its part, Facebook—which has recently begun paying publishers including Buzzfeed and the New York Times to post a quota of Facebook Live videos every week—bills its relationship with the media as a mutually beneficial landlord-tenant partnership. \nBut if you really want to know what Facebook thinks of journalists and their craft, all you need to do is look at what happened when the company quietly assembled some to work on its secretive “trending news” project. The results aren’t pretty: According to five former members of Facebook’s trending news team—“news curators” as they’re known internally—Zuckerberg & Co. take a downright dim view of the industry and its talent. In interviews with Gizmodo, these former curators described grueling work conditions, humiliating treatment, and a secretive, imperious culture in which they were treated as disposable outsiders. After doing a tour in Facebook’s news trenches, almost all of them came to believe that they were there not to work, but to serve as training modules for Facebook’s algorithm. \nLaunched in January 2014, Facebook’s trending news section occupies some of the most precious real estate in all of the internet, filling the top-right hand corner of the site with a list of topics people are talking about and links out to different news articles about them. The dozen or so journalists paid to run that section are contractors who work out of the basement of the company’s New York office. Advertisement \n“We were housed in a conference room for two-and-a-half months,” said one former curator (all former curators insisted on anonymity out of concerns over violating their non-disclosure agreements with Facebook). “It was clear that Zuckerberg could squash the project at any moment.” \n“It was degrading as a human being,” said another. “We weren’t treated as individuals. We were treated in this robot way.” \nThis section, no doubt, drives a substantial number of monthly views to news outlets. Facebook wouldn’t specify, but anecdotal evidence suggests that being featured in the trending widget boosts clicks to a story by many thousands. The trending news section is responsible for dictating many of the stories the average person reads when they’re using Facebook. But nobody really knows much about how it works—and the company isn’t telling. “We choose what’s trending,” said one former news curator. \nThe trending news section is run by people in their 20s and early 30s, most of whom graduated from Ivy League and private East Coast schools like Columbia University and NYU. They’ve previously worked at outlets like the New York Daily News , Bloomberg, MSNBC, and the Guardian . Some former curators have left Facebook for jobs at organizations including the New Yorker , Mashable, and Sky Sports. Advertisement Sponsored \nAccording to former team members interviewed by Gizmodo, this small group has the power to choose what stories make it onto the trending bar and, more importantly, what news sites each topic links out to. “We choose what’s trending,” said one. “There was no real standard for measuring what qualified as news and what didn’t. It was up to the news curator to decide.” \nNews curators aren’t Facebook employees—they’re contractors. One former team member said they received benefits including limited medical insurance, paid time off after 6 months and transit reimbursement, but were otherwise excluded from the culture and perks of working at Facebook. “A company happy hour would happen at 8 p.m., and we’d be working,” said another former curator. “We were apart from a lot of the things happening. But we were employed under very different circumstances.” Advertisement \nWhen the curators, hired by companies like BCForward and Pro Unlimited (which are then subcontracted through Accenture to provide workers for Facebook), arrive at work each day, they read through a list of trending topics ranked by Facebook’s algorithm from most popular (or most engaged) to least. The curators then determine the news story the terms are related to. \nThe news curation team writes headlines for each of the topics, along with a three-sentence summary of the news story it’s pegged to, and choose an image or Facebook video to attach to the topic. The news curator also chooses the “most substantive post” to summarize the topic, usually from a news website. The former contractors Gizmodo interviewed said they were asked to write neutral headlines, and encouraged to promote a video only if it had been uploaded to Facebook. They were also told to select articles from a list of preferred media outlets that included sites like the New York Times , Time , Variety , and other traditional outlets. They would regularly avoid sites like World Star Hip Hop , The Blaze , and Breitbart , but were never explicitly told to suppress those outlets. They were also discouraged from mentioning Twitter by name in headlines and summaries, and instead asked to refer to social media in a broader context. \nNews curators also have the power to “deactivate” (or blacklist) a trending topic—a power that those we spoke to exercised on a daily basis. A topic was often blacklisted if it didn’t have at least three traditional news sources covering it, but otherwise the protocol was murky—meaning a curator could ostensibly blacklist a topic without a particularly good reason for doing so. (Those we interviewed said they didn’t see any signs that blacklisting was being abused or used inappropriately.) \nIn early 2015, when Facebook’s trending news project was still in its infancy, there weren’t many rules about how curators did the rest of their job. “It was all pretty easy breezy,” said one. “We were trained on the basics of everything, then we were thrown into the deep end” with some supervision. Advertisement Advertisement \nOver time, the work became increasingly demanding, and Facebook’s trending news team started to look more and more like the worst stereotypes of a digital media content farm. Managers gave curators aggressive quotas for how many summaries and headlines to write, and timed how long it took curators to write a post. The general standard was 20 posts a day. “We shared documents to see how fast everyone was working,” said one former curator. “They tried to foster inter-office competition to see how many topics we could complete every day.” \nBurnout was rampant. “Most of the original team isn’t there anymore,” said another former news curator. “It was a stop-gap for them. Most of the people were straight out of [journalism school]. At least one of them was fired. Most of them quit or were hired by other news outlets.” \nAccording to one contractor, a colleague sent around a letter asking if people were unhappy with their working conditions. Managers told contractors not to mention that they worked at Facebook on their resumes or in any public profiles. “I got the sense that they wanted to keep the magic about how trending topics work a secret,” said another former news curator. “We had to write in the most passive tense possible. That’s why you’d see headlines that appear in an alien-esque, passive language.” Despite management’s best efforts, many of the contractors are publicly listed in a simple LinkedIn search . Advertisement \nOne reason Facebook might want to keep the trending news operation faceless is that it wants to foster the illusion of a bias-free news ranking process—a network that sorts and selects news stories like an entirely apolitical machine. After all, the company’s entire media division, which is run by Facebook’s managing editor Benjamin Wagner , depends on people’s trust in the platform as a conduit for information. If an editorial team is deliberating over trending topics—just like a newspaper staff would talk about front-page news—Facebook risks losing its image as a non-partisan player in the media industry, a neutral pipeline for distributing content, rather than a selective and inherently flawed curator. \nThat said, many former employees suspect that Facebook’s eventual goal is to replace its human curators with a robotic one. The former curators Gizmodo interviewed started to feel like they were training a machine, one that would eventually take their jobs. Managers began referring to a “more streamlined process” in meetings. As one former contractor put it: “We felt like we were part of an experiment that, as the algorithm got better, there was a sense that at some point the humans would be replaced.” \nWhen asked about the trending news team and its future, a Facebook spokesperson said, “We don’t comment on rumor or speculation. As with all contractors, the trending review team contractors are fairly compensated and receive appropriate benefits.” Advertisement Advertisement \nAccording to those we interviewed, their peers still at Facebook believe their jobs are being phased out. From a group of about 20, Facebook has fired at least eight people this year, and according to former curators, the company has yet to replace any of them. “They had hired us and promised us a job for at least a year,” said one. “Within three months, six of us were fired. No reason was given. We were just told ‘the company is cutting back.’” \nOne former contractor thinks that Facebook’s end goal with its trending section is simple: “It’s an experiment,” this person said. “They are just running tests to see what would increase engagement. At the end of the day, engagement was the only thing they wanted.” \nThe data Facebook is gleaning from upwards of 1 billion users clicking through the trending news module could have a significant impact on the future of news—what we read, how, and from which sources. A future that, if it’s not being determined by a group of 20-something contractors in a basement, will be determined in part by the algorithm that group trained. “They have it down to a science,” said one former curator. “We were truly slaves to the algorithm.”",

      "text": "Zuckerberg: 'Crazy' to say Facebook influenced election - Live5News.com | Charleston, SC | News, Weather, Sports Member Center: Zuckerberg: 'Crazy' to say Facebook influenced election By BARBARA ORTUTAYAP Technology Writer \nNEW YORK (AP) - Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg says the idea that fake news spread on Facebook influenced the outcome of the U.S. election is \"crazy.\" \nStill, the majority of Americans (six in 10) say they get at least some news from social media , mostly Facebook, according to the Pew Research Center. While a lot of this news comes from established outlets - whether CNN or BuzzFeed News, misinformation spreads on Facebook just as information does, shared by users, recommended by software and amplified by both. \nSources of spurious information have ranged from news articles produced by \"content farms\" for the sole purpose of getting clicks, to \"hyperpartisan\" sites from both sides of the political spectrum, churning out stories that are misleading at best. \nCase in point: \"FBI AGENT SUSPECTED IN HILLARY EMAIL LEAKS FOUND DEAD IN APPARENT MURDER-SUICIDE\" - a fabricated headline from a fake news site called the Denver Guardian, was shared thousands of times in the days leading up to the election. \nIs it possible that voters were swayed for or against a candidate, much like those same people might buy a product after seeing an ad on Facebook? \nZuckerberg says voters deserve more credit. \nDuring an interview Thursday with \"The Facebook Effect\" author David Kirkpatrick, Zuckerberg said idea that people voted the way they did because of bogus information on Facebook shows a \"profound lack of empathy\" for supporters of Donald Trump. \n\"Voters make decisions based on their lived experience,\" he said. \nGiven the acerbic political contest from which the country just emerged, when countless longtime friends, even family, were unfriended, many are left to wonder if there would be an alternative American history being written today if it were not for Facebook, Twitter and the like. \nThis, after all, was the first truly social media election, playing out on Twitter and Facebook as much or more than it did on major networks, in living rooms and around watercoolers. \nBut isn't social media just a reflection of our world as it exists? Has Facebook become an easy scapegoat when the answer is far more complex? \nWhile Pew found that many believe political discussions on social media to be \"uniquely angry and disrespectful,\" a comparable number have the same impression of face-to-face conversations when it comes to Democrats, the GOP, or another party. \nFILTER BUBBLE? \nWhen it comes to Facebook users, Zuckerberg said almost everyone has friends on the \"other side.\" Even if 90 percent of your friends are Democrats, for example, 10 percent will be Republican. Still, that's not a very big number, and the idea of a \"filter bubble\" - that social media allows people to surround themselves only with the people and ideas with whom they agree, has been a hot topic this election cycle. \n\"By far the biggest filter in the system is not that the content isn't there, that you don't have friends who support the other candidate or that are of another religion,\" Zuckerberg said. \"But it's that you just don't click on it. You actually tune it out when you see it. I don't know what to do about that.\" \nA DIFFICULT LINE \nFacebook has long denied that it's a publisher or a media company, or that it acts remotely like either. Its cheery slogan - to make the world more \"open and connected\" - seemingly invites a broad range of viewpoints, diverse, lively discussion and the free flow of information, rather than censorship. \nBut it could also make clamping down on fake news difficult. At a time when everyone seems entitled, not just to their own opinions, but to their own facts, one person's misleading headline might be another person's heartfelt truth. \n\"We take misinformation on Facebook very seriously,\" Adam Mosseri, the executive in charge of Facebook's news feed, said in a statement to the tech blog TechCrunch this week. \"We value authentic communication, and hear consistently from those who use Facebook that they prefer not to see misinformation.\" \nFacebook acknowledges that it has more work to do, and it seems to be putting a lot of faith in the power of data, artificial intelligence and algorithms as the solution. \nOver the summer, Facebook fired the small group of journalists in charge of its \"trending\" items and replaced them with an algorithm. The catalyst appeared to be a report in a tech blog, based on an anonymous source, that the editors routinely suppressed conservative viewpoints. \nSubsequently, fake stories ahead of the election began to trend.

      "text": "As Ovilex Soft’s nearly 550,000 Facebook fans will agree, when the powerhouse development company adds a new 3D simulation app to its roster, it’s truly a global event that invariably leads to millions of downloads, and unleashes a steady stream of positive reviews from experts and users alike. And true to form, that’s exactly what is happening in the aftermath of the latest spectacular release that may arguably be the best yet: Extreme Trucks Simulator. As the title suggests, Extreme Trucks Simulator is for all of the men, women, boys and girls who’ve ever looked at an excavator, bulldozer, hauler, crane, dump truck, or any other glorious industrial beast, and said to themselves: “I wish I could be in control of that!”\nObviously, Extreme Trucks Simulator can’t put people in the cockpit of a real extreme industry vehicle, since only trained and licensed professionals enjoy that privilege. However, the app does the next best thing by bringing the experience to life with the stunningly realistic 3D graphics, sounds, and obsessive attention to detail that Ovilex Soft is known for.\nThe first thing that users will love is the wide selection of extreme vehicles they can choose from, which include: an excavator, dump truck, bulldozer, hauler, log crane truck, forklift, flatbed truck, garbage truck, cement truck, tow truck, crane, and snow plow. Anyone who wonders why Ovilex Soft would offer so many extreme vehicles when most users would be satisfied with three or four clearly isn’t familiar with how the company operates. They simply never cut corners, and exceeding expectations is somehow what they manage to achieve release after release.\nOnce they choose their extreme vehicle, users are treated to spectacularly realistic interiors and driving controls, including tilt and touch-responsive steering, dashboard buttons and turn signals, gears, handles, levers and more. Users can also choose automatic transmission or clutch-operated manual transmission with slider pedals. The driving simulation is flawless, thanks to a realistic AI that uses physics to determine what’s possible and what isn’t. To that end, users need to make sure they safely and responsibly operate their vehicle to avoid damage or accidents.\nThe sound effects are also outstanding with lifelike engine noises, loading and unloading cargo, operating gears, and so on. There are also various weather conditions – from sunny and dry to cloudy and rainy -- as well as day and night scenes, and multiple scenarios including country roads, quarry mine, deserts, mountains, cities, and more.\nIn terms of gameplay, as with Ovilex Soft’s other 3D simulation apps, users can choose various modes such as free ride, career or multiplayer for teaming up with friends. In total, there are 8 modes with 80 levels that get increasingly challenging. The app also features Leaderboard integration, and users can request new maps and modes on Ovilex Soft’s social media pages.\n“Extreme Trucks Simulator was in development for many months, and our team worked extremely hard to get all of the details right,” commented Marusac Alexandru of Ovilex Soft. “And based on the overwhelmingly positive feedback we have received so far – including more than 1000 five star reviews in less than 48 hours since launching the app – it looks like our community of users around the world approve of our efforts. We hope they enjoy playing the app as much as we did creating it!”\nExtreme Trucks Simulator is available now for iOS devices from the App Store at https://itunes.apple.com/ro/app/extreme-trucks-simulator/id1161136955 , and for Android Devices from Google Play at https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ovilex.extremetruckssimulator\nAddition app information, including a video trailer and screenshots, is available at: http://www.ovilex.com/app/extreme-trucks-simulator/\nFor all other information or media inquiries, contact Mark Johnson on behalf of Ovilex Soft at +1 408 757 0156 or press (at)appshout(dot)com.\nAbout Ovilex Soft\nOvilex Soft is a new games company that focuses on making the best simulators on Google Play and the App Store. With a variety of planned future projects and continuous attention to quality control, the company will become an important developer within the simulator/racing game market.\nOlivex Soft also helps ensure the quality of their products by keeping contact directly with their large audience of games players via the company’s site forum at: http://www.ovilex.com/forum/\nView the full Press Release in the appshout!

      "text": "\nThe kind of story that brings people together . \nAlyssa Galios shared the story on Facebook . She was in a Washington State Starbucks working away Wednesday morning like she often does. But she was about to witness something extraordinary this time. \nShe said the coffee shop was pretty empty except for a table with a mother and her three young children. \nAlyssa was typing away when she noticed two soldiers walk into the shop in all of their gear. The kids went silent when they saw the two men. \nAfter placing their orders, one of the soldiers turns around -- sensing a pair of young eyes. He went over to the boy and asked him how his day was going. They have a quick chat and the soldier learns that the boy's favorite superhero is Spider-Man. \nThen the soldier ripped off his velcro American flag patch and gave it to the young boy. \nThe other soldier then walked over and did the same -- giving the boy his American flag patch right off of his uniform. \nAs you can imagine, the little boy smiled wide with happiness. \nSoon after, it was time for the kids to go to school. So the boys' mother thanked the two soldiers, Edgar Gonzalez and Pedro Cordoba, profusely. \nAnd with Friday being Veterans' Day, this is a perfect reminder to thank those who've served. \nRead the full story below: 47.912876 -122.098185 ",

If you never look up someone on Facebook and have very few mutual friends with them and they're always on your suggestions you can assume that person may be stalking you through FB. That's about the best you can do, and it's rather unreliable. But I've noticed a few stalkers using this. This one girl I had never seen with 0 mutual friends (but nearby, she must have landed on my profile by account hopping). She kept coming into my friend suggestions but eventually faded away after about 2-3 weeks, I can be fairly certain she was viewing my PFP a few times a day or every other day.",

      "text": "Follow CBSMIAMI.COM: Facebook | Twitter \nPORTLAND, Ore. (CBSMiami/AP) — A fourth day of demonstrations have swept across the country protesting Donald Trump’s presidential election victory.\nIn Portland, police used tear gas and flash-bang grenades Friday to try to disperse the crowd after hundreds of people marched through the city, disrupting traffic and spray-painting graffiti. Authorities said “burning projectiles” were thrown at police and vandalism and assault had taken place during the rally, which organizers had billed as peaceful earlier in the day.\nIn other parts of the country, there were spirited demonstrations on college campuses and peaceful marches along downtown streets.\nHundreds joined an afternoon “love rally” in Washington Square Park in Manhattan.\nLeslie Holmes, 65, a website developer from Wilton, Connecticut, took an hour-long train ride to the demonstration — her first protest since the 1970s, when she hit the streets of San Francisco to oppose the Vietnam War.\nShe described herself as an armchair liberal but declared, “I’m not going to be armchair anymore.”\n“I don’t want to live in a country where my friends aren’t included, and my friends are fearful, and my children are going to grow up in a world that’s frightening, and my granddaughters can look forward to being excluded from jobs and politics and fulfilling their potential, so I’m here for them,” she said.\nEvening marches disrupted traffic in Miami and Atlanta.\nTrump supporter Nicolas Quirico was traveling from South Beach to Miami. His car was among hundreds stopped when protesters blocked Interstate 395.\n“Trump will be our president. There is no way around that, and the sooner people grasp that, the better off we will be,” he said. “There is a difference between a peaceful protest and standing in a major highway backing up traffic for 5 miles. This is wrong.”\nMore than a thousand protesters took to the streets across California after night fell including downtown Los Angeles, where over 200 were arrested a night earlier. In Bakersfield, where Trump is far more popular than in most of the state, some held signs reading “Anti-Trump, Pro-USA.”\nSmall protests also were held in Detroit; Minneapolis; Kansas City, Missouri; Olympia, Washington and Iowa City.\nMore than 200 people, carrying signs gathered on the steps of the Washington state Capitol. The group chanted “not my president” and “no Trump, no KKK, no fascist USA.”\nIn Tennessee, Vanderbilt University students sang civil rights songs and marched through campus across a Nashville street, temporarily blocking traffic. A protest also occurred in Minneapolis.\nIn Chicago, multiple groups planned protests through Saturday.\nNadia Gavino, 25, learned about the rallies on Twitter and protested Thursday evening. Gavino, whose father is from Peru and whose mother is of Mexican and Lithuanian heritage, said she took Trump’s harshest statements about immigrants and Latinos personally.\n“I obviously agree that he’s racist, he’s sexist, he’s phobic, he’s misogynistic. He’s all these things you don’t want in a leader,” she said.\nAshley Lynne Nagel, 27, said she joined a Thursday night demonstration in Denver.\n“I have a leader I fear for the first time in my life,” said Nagel, a Bernie Sanders supporter who voted for Hillary Clinton.\n“It’s not that we’re sore losers,” she said. “It’s that we are genuinely upset, angry, terrified that a platform based off of racism, xenophobia and homophobia has become so powerful and now has complete control of our representation.”\nDemonstrations also were planned Saturday in Las Vegas, Los Angeles and other areas.\nPrevious demonstrations drew thousands of people in New York and other large urban centers. The largely peaceful demonstrations were overshadowed by sporadic episodes of vandalism, violence and street-blocking.\n(TM and © Copyright 2016 CBS Radio Inc. and its relevant subsidiaries.

      "text": "  Jeff Haanen Leave a Comment \nThe world is a distracting place. \nEmail, Facebook, open office spaces, iPhones, and insanity-inducing apps with red pop-up bubbles nagging for my attention. \nWhat would the opposite of a distracted work day look like? \nCheck out this statement by W.H. Auden: \n“You need not see what someone is doing to know if it is his vocation, you have only to watch his eyes; a cook mixing a sauce, a surgeon making a primary incision, a clerk completing a bill of lading, wear the same rapt expression, forgetting themselves in a function. How beautiful it is, that eye-on-the-object look.” \nWhen was the last time you were working and you had that eye-on-the-object look? For me, at least, it’s elusive. So much clutter – mental, and physical. What can be done? \nThis makes me think about three things: Find Deep Work. Cal Newport’s book makes the case that unplugging from distraction is rare, meaningful and valuable. He also gives some clear tips on on how to work deeply in a distracted age, like quitting social media, embracing boredom, and “draining the shallows.” It’s the quantity of deep work – not the total hours in your day on your computer – that really matters. Serve the Work, Not the Customer . In her profound little essay “Why Work?” Dorothy Sayers says “If work is to find its right place in the world, it is the duty of the Church to see to it that the work serves God, and that the worker serves the work.” Here’s what she means: in an age focused on “customer service” we’ve lost a vision for the intrinsic value of the work itself. That is, we ought not to work ultimately for our customers or for our wages, but for God, and in so doing, our work reflects his beauty and creativity alone. Nuts to what others think about it. Do a thing well for its own sake. There’s your daily act of worship. Recover the Practice of Attention . Matthew Crawford has written a delightful book called “ The World Beyond Your Head: On Becoming an Individual in an Age of Distraction .” It might be your iPhone’s fault that you’re distracted, or it may have deeper roots in Western culture. Crawford makes the case that hockey players, chefs and pipe organ makers need hours of undistracted focus – and that like them, collectively we could build public spaces more attentive to focus than frittering away our time. \nIt is indeed possible to get into a flow, as TED talk all-star Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi calls it. It’s tough, but worth a try. \nIt’s high time each of us went back to the why of our work, and started to recover our vocation – and that beautiful eye-on-the-object look.  ",

      "text": "Facebook has agreed to strengthen its advertising screening after allowing several racially discriminatory housing ads to run on the site.\nThe social media platform came under fire in October when a ProPublica investigation revealed that the Facebook had allowed advertisers not only to target ads to certain minorities, but also to illegally exclude some groups from seeing housing ads. After talking with New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, members of Congress, and the US Department of Housing and Urban Development, Facebook has agreed to end all selective advertising based on race.\n\"We are going to turn off, actually prohibit, the use of ethnic affinity marketing for ads that we identify as offering housing, employment, and credit,\" Erin Egan, Facebook's vice president of US public policy, told USA Today .\nRecommended: Infographic Race equality in America: How far have we come? Facebook will provide advertisers with educational materials explaining their legal obligations, and then require them to confirm that they will not place discriminatory ads on the site. The social media site is still working on reprogramming the algorithm that monitors for discriminatory practices.\nInfographic Race equality in America: How far have we come? Photos of the Day Photos of the Weekend “We are going to have to build a solution to do this. It is not going to happen overnight,” Steve Satterfield, privacy and public policy manager at Facebook, told ProPublica .\nAdvertisements that exclude groups of people based on a variety of identity-based factors, including race, ethnicity, and gender, were banned under the Fair Housing Act of 1964, enacted when many African American and Latino families struggled to find housing because landlords would not rent to them.\n\"There's a part of the Fair Housing Act that makes it illegal to have discriminatory advertising. That part applies to both the person taking out the ad and also the publisher of that ad,\" Rigel Oliveri, professor of law at the University of Missouri, told USA Today.\nIn the eyes of the law, Facebook is not \"just hosting\" these ads, he explained. \"It's encouraging and providing the advertisers with the ability to exclude people based on their race and ethnicity,” he said.\nPrior to this, Facebook allowed advertisers to target their ads based on a category it labeled “ethnic affinities,\" which led a group of Facebook users to file a lawsuit against the site.\n\"These tools are intended to be inclusive. That's why we created these tools,\" Ms. Egan told USA Today. \"People have been using multicultural advertising for years in order to reach people.\"\nThe tools were designed to target advertisements to the appropriate audience – Facebook gave the example of hair products marketed to African-American women – but these advertising practices have created a moral grey area. As such, advertising experts recommend simply avoiding such practices , as The Christian Science Monitor's Zhai Yun Tan reported last month:\nAs Jerome Williams, professor and provost of Rutgers University-Newark tells The Christian Science Monitor in a phone interview, the original purpose of targeted advertising was not to \"exclude other groups\" but to \"concentrate your message to a particular group.\"\n\"Because of technology, you can prohibit certain people from viewing it. That becomes risky,\" Prof. Williams says. \"I think you want to avoid those type of strategies.\"",

      "text": "Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Pin it \n(NCIS Los Angeles / Facebook) “NCIS: Los Angeles” season 8 airs Sundays at 8 p.m. on CBS. \nSneak previews on the upcoming episode 8, titled \"Parallel Resistors,\" of the American police procedural drama \"NCIS: Los Angeles\" season 8 were recently dropped. Two teaser clips hint that one asset could solve the attack on a graduate student. \nAccording to reports , the synopsis of \"NCIS: Los Angeles\" season 8 reveals that the team takes on the case of a graduate student who was attacked. The team learns that the attacks should not be taken lightly since the victim is developing an electromagnetic weapon for the Navy and it could be linked to an international warfare. The upcoming episode also centers on Kensi's (Daniela Ruah) recovery. \nIn one of the two sneak previews, the team learns more information on a girl named Nadia (Shree Crooks), who happens to be the daughter of the victim. They suspect that she knows some information regarding her father's attack. Despite Callan (Chris O'Donnell) and Hanna's (LL Cool J) attempts to talk to her, Nadia refuses to answer them. The two detectives tell her that she doesn't have to play detective on her own and assure her that she can trust them with whatever she knows. \nNadia will only answer to Callan and Hanna's questions through her mother. She recommends looking into case files that have to do with her father's project. Also, she tells the detectives that her father's plans for the power supplier have no value alone. It would be better, she suggests, that they look into the guidance plans that are available in the university where her father studies. Apparently, Nadia is a gifted child with an incredible IQ for such a young age. Advertisement \nMeanwhile, the previous episode , titled \"Crazy Train,\" saw Callen going undercover as a patient at a mental health facility to look for a missing NSA agent. \n\"NCIS: Los Angeles\" season 8 airs Sundays at 8 p.m. on CBS.

      "text": "Close Eric Risberg, Associated Press file \nFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg delivers the keynote address at the F8 Facebook Developer Conference in San Francisco April 12. AP Zuckerberg: 'Crazy' to say Facebook influenced election BARBARA ORTUTAY Associated Press ( … ) Eric Risberg, Associated Press file \nFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg delivers the keynote address at the F8 Facebook Developer Conference in San Francisco April 12. \nNEW YORK — Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg says the idea that fake news spread on Facebook influenced the outcome of the U.S. election is \"crazy.\" \nStill, the majority of Americans (six in 10) say they get at least some news from social media , mostly Facebook, according to the Pew Research Center. While a lot of this news comes from established outlets — whether CNN or BuzzFeed News, misinformation spreads on Facebook just as information does, shared by users, recommended by software and amplified by both. \nSources of spurious information have ranged from news articles produced by \"content farms\" for the sole purpose of getting clicks, to \"hyperpartisan\" sites from both sides of the political spectrum, churning out stories that are misleading at best. \nCase in point: \"FBI AGENT SUSPECTED IN HILLARY EMAIL LEAKS FOUND DEAD IN APPARENT MURDER-SUICIDE\" — a fabricated headline from a fake news site called the Denver Guardian, was shared thousands of times in the days leading up to the election. \nIs it possible that voters were swayed for or against a candidate, much like those same people might buy a product after seeing an ad on Facebook? \nZuckerberg says voters deserve more credit. \nDuring an interview Thursday with \"The Facebook Effect\" author David Kirkpatrick, Zuckerberg said idea that people voted the way they did because of bogus information on Facebook shows a \"profound lack of empathy\" for supporters of Donald Trump. \n\"Voters make decisions based on their lived experience,\" he said. \nGiven the acerbic political contest from which the country just emerged, when countless longtime friends, even family, were unfriended, many are left to wonder if there would be an alternative American history being written today if it were not for Facebook, Twitter and the like. \nThis, after all, was the first truly social media election, playing out on Twitter and Facebook as much or more than it did on major networks, in living rooms and around watercoolers. \nBut isn't social media just a reflection of our world as it exists? Has Facebook become an easy scapegoat when the answer is far more complex? \nWhile Pew found that many believe political discussions on social media to be \"uniquely angry and disrespectful,\" a comparable number have the same impression of face-to-face conversations when it comes to Democrats, the GOP, or another party. \nFILTER BUBBLE? \nWhen it comes to Facebook users, Zuckerberg said almost everyone has friends on the \"other side.\" Even if 90 percent of your friends are Democrats, for example, 10 percent will be Republican. Still, that's not a very big number, and the idea of a \"filter bubble\" — that social media allows people to surround themselves only with the people and ideas with whom they agree, has been a hot topic this election cycle. \n\"By far the biggest filter in the system is not that the content isn't there, that you don't have friends who support the other candidate or that are of another religion,\" Zuckerberg said. \"But it's that you just don't click on it. You actually tune it out when you see it. I don't know what to do about that.\" \nA DIFFICULT LINE \nFacebook has long denied that it's a publisher or a media company, or that it acts remotely like either. Its cheery slogan — to make the world more \"open and connected\" — seemingly invites a broad range of viewpoints, diverse, lively discussion and the free flow of information, rather than censorship. \nBut it could also make clamping down on fake news difficult. At a time when everyone seems entitled, not just to their own opinions, but to their own facts, one person's misleading headline might be another person's heartfelt truth. \n\"We take misinformation on Facebook very seriously,\" Adam Mosseri, the executive in charge of Facebook's news feed, said in a statement to the tech blog TechCrunch this week. \"We value authentic communication, and hear consistently from those who use Facebook that they prefer not to see misinformation.\" \nFacebook acknowledges that it has more work to do, and it seems to be putting a lot of faith in the power of data, artificial intelligence and algorithms as the solution. \nOver the summer, Facebook fired the small group of journalists in charge of its \"trending\" items and replaced them with an algorithm. The catalyst appeared to be a report in a tech blog, based on an anonymous source, that the editors routinely suppressed conservative viewpoints. \nSubsequently, fake stories ahead of the election began to trend.

CrowdTangle said that its technology helps identify stories picking up traction and influential sources as well as their performance on social networks. \nThe startup claimed that thousands of journalists use its tool daily, with its customers around the world including newspapers, television stations, digital media outlets, nonprofits, and sports teams. \nThe list of users at CrowdTangle included Google, BuzzFeed, Vox, the British BBC, RTL Group in Luxembourg, and Switzerland-based media group Ringier. CrowdTangle is also used by nonprofit groups such as Greenpeace and Unicef, according to its website. \nThe CrowdTangle platform is tailored to spot news that is catching fire at online venues like Facebook, its subsidiary Instagram, and even competitors such as Google-owned YouTube or Twitter. \nThe US startup also provides tools for media to see how much attention its own stories attract and to identify who is sharing their content, according to its website. \nThe CrowdTangle team will continue to run the operation, and the plan was to go on supporting support integration with Twitter, YouTube and other clients. \nFacebook expected CrowdTangle technology to enable it to provide more meaningful insights to publishers at the social network.

      "text": "0 A picture of Hafthor Bjornsson's costume in \"Game of Thrones\" Season 6. Facebook/ GameofThrones \nIn case there was any doubt about which TV series does brutal killing better “Game of Thrones” or “The Walking Dead,” Hafþór Júlíus Björnsson has ended that debate with a single picture. The picture is of his character and the new villainous character from Frank Darabont’s show. \nThe picture shows a scene from “The Walking Dead” of the new villain Negan (Jeffrey Dean Morgan). For those who are unfamiliar with the zombie TV series, this new villain likes to carry a baseball bat covered in barbed wire, which he has named Lucille. The character uses this weapon to batter the heads of his victims. \n“I crush skulls with a baseball bat,” Negan says in this picture Björnsson (Gregor Clegane) shared on Instagram. In reply to this statement, the actor has a picture of his character in a scene from a previously aired episode. In that scene his character crushes his opponent’s skull with his bare hands. So, the Mountain thinks “The Walking Dead” character’s approach is “cute.” \nA photo posted by Hafþór Júlíus Björnsson (@thorbjornsson) on Nov 10, 2016 at 9:52am PST \nCredit: Instagram/ Hafþór Júlíus Björnsson \nMeanwhile, the production of “Game of Thrones” Season 7 continues. Two leaked pictures from the set reveal the throne rooms two major characters will use next year. \n  first picture posted on Watchers of the Wall is the redesigned throne room of King’s Landing. The window on top of the Iron Throne will no longer have the seven-pointed star, a symbol of the Faith of the Seven. After the events in the previous season involving the Faith Militants, Cersei (Lena Headey) will rather have the Lannister symbol of the lion. \nThe other picture is the throne room of Daenerys Targaryen (Emilia Clarke) in “Game of Thrones” Season 7. The Mother of Dragons will get to sit on her ancestral seat at Dragonstone. The character and her army are expected to land on this island, which is very close to King’s Landing.",

      "text": "\nAfter every supermoon, Twitter and Facebook are flooded with fuzzy photos of white glowing orbs kind of floating in a black sea of night. \nBut there are ways to take a good photo of the moon, even with a smartphone. \nMonday’s supermoon will be the closest in its orbit to Earth since 1948. It becomes full Monday morning. \nA super moon rises over the Boynton Beach Inlet in Boynton Beach, Florida on September 8, 2014. (Allen Eyestone / The Palm Beach Post) \n“Don’t make the mistake of photographing the moon by itself, with no reference to anything,” Bill Ingalls, a senior photographer for NASA, told National Geographic . “Instead, think of how to make the image creative — that means tying it into some land-based object. It can be a local landmark or anything to give your photo a sense of place.” \nThe moon begins to set behind the First Baptist Church during a lunar eclipse, October 8, 2014, in West Palm Beach. (Greg Lovett / The Palm Beach Post) \nHere are a few tips from Palm Beach Post photographer Lannis Waters that were first gathered by Palm Beach Post staff writer Staci Sturrock during supermoon events in 2014. Start early. If you’re using a smartphone, try to capture the moon when it’s still near Earth’s horizon, and find something to frame it with in the foreground (trees, buildings, people). “That will help with your exposure because there should still be some light in the sky, and add interest,” Waters says. Go long. Using a DSLR? “Obviously, shoot with as long a lens as possible,” Waters says. “A tripod will help, and is necessary if you’re using a very long lens. Ditto for a cable release or self-timer to avoid adding any vibrations when you fire a frame.” Look for foreground interest. You can’t go wrong composing your photo with either the Lake Worth or Juno Beach pier in the foreground. “Around here, it’s hard to find a place where you can get far enough back to make a skyline work, but there are places where you could get the moon rising through a stand of trees or over buildings, but you need to search for those in advance,” Waters says. (Jupiter Lighthouse, we’re looking at you.) Tap into an app. Waters likes the SkyView app, “which gives you an Augmented Reality view of the sky, and lets you type in the time and date you want so you can see where the moon will be at that time.” Make manual adjustments. Forgo your camera’s automatic settings and use the back of your camera to judge your exposure. “Otherwise the dark sky can make your shot overexposed,” Waters says. “And since the moon is reflecting daylight, the exposure is near what it would be for a sunlit scene in the daytime, so you don’t need a high ISO.” \n\n(Greg Lovett / The Palm Beach Post) \n",

      "title": "How to take the best photos of Monday’s supermoon | WSB-TV",
      "text": "\nAfter every supermoon, Twitter and Facebook are flooded with fuzzy photos of white glowing orbs kind of floating in a black sea of night. \nBut there are ways to take a good photo of the moon, even with a smartphone. \nMonday’s supermoon will be the closest in its orbit to Earth since 1948. It becomes full Monday morning. \nA super moon rises over the Boynton Beach Inlet in Boynton Beach, Florida on September 8, 2014. (Allen Eyestone / The Palm Beach Post) \n“Don’t make the mistake of photographing the moon by itself, with no reference to anything,” Bill Ingalls, a senior photographer for NASA, told National Geographic . “Instead, think of how to make the image creative — that means tying it into some land-based object. It can be a local landmark or anything to give your photo a sense of place.” \nThe moon begins to set behind the First Baptist Church during a lunar eclipse, October 8, 2014, in West Palm Beach. (Greg Lovett / The Palm Beach Post) \nHere are a few tips from Palm Beach Post photographer Lannis Waters that were first gathered by Palm Beach Post staff writer Staci Sturrock during supermoon events in 2014. Start early. If you’re using a smartphone, try to capture the moon when it’s still near Earth’s horizon, and find something to frame it with in the foreground (trees, buildings, people). “That will help with your exposure because there should still be some light in the sky, and add interest,” Waters says. Go long. Using a DSLR? “Obviously, shoot with as long a lens as possible,” Waters says. “A tripod will help, and is necessary if you’re using a very long lens. Ditto for a cable release or self-timer to avoid adding any vibrations when you fire a frame.” Look for foreground interest. You can’t go wrong composing your photo with either the Lake Worth or Juno Beach pier in the foreground. “Around here, it’s hard to find a place where you can get far enough back to make a skyline work, but there are places where you could get the moon rising through a stand of trees or over buildings, but you need to search for those in advance,” Waters says. (Jupiter Lighthouse, we’re looking at you.) Tap into an app. Waters likes the SkyView app, “which gives you an Augmented Reality view of the sky, and lets you type in the time and date you want so you can see where the moon will be at that time.” Make manual adjustments. Forgo your camera’s automatic settings and use the back of your camera to judge your exposure. “Otherwise the dark sky can make your shot overexposed,” Waters says. “And since the moon is reflecting daylight, the exposure is near what it would be for a sunlit scene in the daytime, so you don’t need a high ISO.” \n\n(Greg Lovett / The Palm Beach Post) \n",

      "title": "Outrage, Fear Fuel 4th Day Of Anti-Trump Protests",
      "text": "Follow CBSMIAMI.COM: Facebook | Twitter \nPORTLAND, Ore. (CBSMiami/AP) — A fourth day of demonstrations have swept across the country protesting Donald Trump’s presidential election victory. \nIn Portland, police used tear gas and flash-bang grenades Friday to try to disperse the crowd after hundreds of people marched through the city, disrupting traffic and spray-painting graffiti. Authorities said “burning projectiles” were thrown at police and vandalism and assault had taken place during the rally, which organizers had billed as peaceful earlier in the day. \nIn other parts of the country, there were spirited demonstrations on college campuses and peaceful marches along downtown streets. \nHundreds joined an afternoon “love rally” in Washington Square Park in Manhattan. \nLeslie Holmes, 65, a website developer from Wilton, Connecticut, took an hour-long train ride to the demonstration — her first protest since the 1970s, when she hit the streets of San Francisco to oppose the Vietnam War. \nShe described herself as an armchair liberal but declared, “I’m not going to be armchair anymore.” \n“I don’t want to live in a country where my friends aren’t included, and my friends are fearful, and my children are going to grow up in a world that’s frightening, and my granddaughters can look forward to being excluded from jobs and politics and fulfilling their potential, so I’m here for them,” she said. \nEvening marches disrupted traffic in Miami and Atlanta. \nTrump supporter Nicolas Quirico was traveling from South Beach to Miami. His car was among hundreds stopped when protesters blocked Interstate 395. \n“Trump will be our president. There is no way around that, and the sooner people grasp that, the better off we will be,” he said. “There is a difference between a peaceful protest and standing in a major highway backing up traffic for 5 miles. This is wrong.” \nMore than a thousand protesters took to the streets across California after night fell including downtown Los Angeles, where over 200 were arrested a night earlier. In Bakersfield, where Trump is far more popular than in most of the state, some held signs reading “Anti-Trump, Pro-USA.” \nSmall protests also were held in Detroit; Minneapolis; Kansas City, Missouri; Olympia, Washington and Iowa City. \nMore than 200 people, carrying signs gathered on the steps of the Washington state Capitol. The group chanted “not my president” and “no Trump, no KKK, no fascist USA.” \nIn Tennessee, Vanderbilt University students sang civil rights songs and marched through campus across a Nashville street, temporarily blocking traffic. A protest also occurred in Minneapolis. \nIn Chicago, multiple groups planned protests through Saturday. \nNadia Gavino, 25, learned about the rallies on Twitter and protested Thursday evening. Gavino, whose father is from Peru and whose mother is of Mexican and Lithuanian heritage, said she took Trump’s harshest statements about immigrants and Latinos personally. \n“I obviously agree that he’s racist, he’s sexist, he’s phobic, he’s misogynistic. He’s all these things you don’t want in a leader,” she said. \nAshley Lynne Nagel, 27, said she joined a Thursday night demonstration in Denver. \n“I have a leader I fear for the first time in my life,” said Nagel, a Bernie Sanders supporter who voted for Hillary Clinton. \n“It’s not that we’re sore losers,” she said. “It’s that we are genuinely upset, angry, terrified that a platform based off of racism, xenophobia and homophobia has become so powerful and now has complete control of our representation.” \nDemonstrations also were planned Saturday in Las Vegas, Los Angeles and other areas. \nPrevious demonstrations drew thousands of people in New York and other large urban centers. The largely peaceful demonstrations were overshadowed by sporadic episodes of vandalism, violence and street-blocking. \n(TM and © Copyright 2016 CBS Radio Inc. and its relevant subsidiaries.

Join the Conversation x Share Several events were held Saturday in Rochester to rally the community around positivity and to reject violence and bullying.

(Photo: TINA MACINTYRE-YEE/@tyee23/staff photographer) Buy Photo \nTwo gatherings. Two different reasons. One emerging theme: the need to talk with people at the other end of the political spectrum. \n“We need to respect that we may not be able to share each other’s views,” said Chris Iorillo of Brighton, who attended a rally Saturday organized by Rochester’s North Winton neighbors to show support after a rainbow flag was burned the day after the presidential election. “We need to live together and work together and say, ‘How can we continue to do that despite our differences?’” \nA few miles away, Meagan Harris had planned a get-together at the grave of Susan A. Anthony to ponder a similar question. \n“We have to be respectful on both sides,” said Harris. \nAt the end of a tumultuous and emotional week, some people still felt the need to come to terms with the election of Donald Trump over Hillary Clinton for president. \nAbout 200 people gathered at Browncroft Rose Garden to show support for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgendered neighbors who might have felt threatened after an act of vandalism in the area. At Mt. Hope Cemetery, people continued to pay tribute to Anthony for her work in gaining women the right to vote. Facebook A link has been posted to your Facebook feed.

The other girls with her, sisters Natalie and Elizabeth Lascari of Brighton came with them. The Montenas were in town visiting them. Jessica Montena said, \"It was supposed to be a different day,\" and said \"maybe by next week I'll stop crying\" She said the election was still historical even though Hillary Clinton lost, \"I wanted it so badly for our girls, I wanted it for my mother.\" TINA MACINTYRE-YEE/ @tyee23/staff photographer Fullscreen Buy Photo Jen Perry of New Jersey, has her daughter, Elle, 10, pose by Susan B.

But they admitted the conversation can be tough to start. \n“Sometimes it’s difficult because we play the blame game and aren’t listening to the words,” said Leandra Montemarano, who was visiting the Anthony grave. \nThe 30-year-old Rochester resident said she has friends with different opinions, but doesn’t often wade into a discussion. “I think there are things people can agree on both sides. … I think we can just say, ‘Hey, I’d like to talk to you about something. This is how I feel, what is your take?’ and from there go on to say, ‘Let’s talk about why you feel that way and why I feel this way and see if we can come to a compromise and make things better.” \nIt appears people are looking for ice-breakers. Kit Miller, director of the M.K. Gandhi Institute for Nonviolence in Rochester, said there’s been more calls and people turning up at the center on South Plymouth Avenue. \n“Speak to what you’re worried about,” Miller said late last week. “Those are human things we can connect with, no matter who you voted for. Stay away from our judgments and our opinions and our blame. Those are not the things that are going to help us connect across differences.” \nShe said the goal isn’t necessarily to change minds but to learn, to teach and to understand. “Once I’ve indicated understanding, then I can ask to be understood,” she said. \nBut that’s not the same as agreeing, she said. “We can understand someone without agreeing with them.” \nPeople may equate the two because they listen to only what they already know from people who look like them, what Dawn Pozzi called the echo-chamber effect. Pozzi said the local Quaker group, which is mostly white and college-educated, is looking to bring in diverse voices. \n“We have to listen to other people without putting up our own barriers to hearing them,” said Pozzi, who is the clerk of the Rochester Friends Meeting of the Religious Society of Friends. \n“We need to be honest with ourselves about how segregated we are and how racist and sexist our communities are,” said Bridget Dee of Rochester, who attended the North Winton rally. \nAcross town, Stephanie Malady was asked how to talk to someone instead of at the person. \n“I think that’s something we have to figure out,” she said. “I think both sides have to figure that out.” \nPSINGER@Gannett.com \nSTADDEO@Gannett.com Peaceful resolutions \nThe M.K.

I don't know if it's like a muscle ache, or a bone ache or tendon or who the fuck knows what. No, I'm not sore lol. It's not super bad, but it's really annoying. Thanks! Updates:",

I agree with her because she is absolutely right and the perfect RMD you perceive is a creation of the woman who genuinely loves me and is there on the sidelines cheering me on and keeping me grounded. \nMy prayer for you today is that you find the man for you and give you the wisdom to mold him into perfection. #RMDSaysSo \nRMD is a renowned Nollywood actor who has given us great films such as: Behind Closed Doors, I Believe in You, Scores to Settle and Out of Bounds.",

      "text": "This was on Facebook as I follow him. Dieudonné M'Bala M'Bala, a french comedian, addressed Hillary his famous \"quenelle\" as Trump won the election. Who is Dieudonné? - The story is way too long but basically this guy is politically the most uncorrect comedian here in France. He's been banned from all (or at least 99.9%) TV channels since 2003 after making a sketch about Israel and the zionists. He's also known for bashing (with humor, for sure) the mainstream media, the corrupt french government and all the **** concerning Hillary too, for example. More here : en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dieudonn%C3%A9_M%27bala_M%27bala What is the \"quenelle\"? - It's a gesture (refer to the picture) consisting in putting one's hand onto between their other shoulder and arm. It means how deep we, the people, f*** fk the government and the media with humor and freedom of expression. (Sorry for my bad english lads.)",

      "text": "Email “Chewy” the dog. The pet was allegedly killed by a neighbor in St. George. Image via Facebook. \nST. GEORGE, Utah — After posts on social media began attracting major attention, the St. George Police Department has issued a statement on the case of a dog that was hit and killed by a man with pruning shears after the dog ran onto the man’s property. \nAccording to St. George PD , officers responded to a home in the area of 2040 East around 4:30 p.m. Friday on report that a man had killed his neighbor’s dog. \nPolice said the dog entered the neighbor’s yard as the man was maintaining his landscaping, and the man swung pruning shears at the dog when it approached him. \n“The sheers(sic) ended up striking the dog in the head, killing it instantly,” police stated on Facebook Saturday. “As sad as it is that the dog was hit and killed, the circumstances were worsened by the fact that the incident was witnessed by the dog owner’s juvenile daughter.” \nThe owner of the dog, named “Chewy”, stated on Facebook that all her dog did was run into the man’s yard. \nPolice stated that at this time they are still in the process of gathering information. They say the relevant criminal code is aggravated cruelty to an animal, and they stated that charges would depend on a person’s mental intent at the time of the incident. \n“We must be able to show an intent level to determine what penalties may be imposed if the suspect is convicted,” police stated. “It also impacts what options the officer has when determining whether to cite or arrest a suspect.” \nPolice said that there are conflicting reports about what the suspect was intending to do when he swung his shears at the dog, and they said no police were present so they cannot make an arrest based on what they know so far. Police further stated they will continue to work with the prosecutor’s office to determine if charges will be filed. \nThey closed by addressing community concerns about the case: \n“The St. George Police Department does feel that this incident is significant and has had a significant impact on the children and family who own the dog. Our goal is to fully and effectively investigate ALL aspects of this incident to determine what legal options for criminal charges we have and then to proceed with the most appropriate and effective option. We understand, with the emotions involved, how it might seem that the “police are doing nothing about it,” but that is not the case. We are trying to do the RIGHT thing to address this situation. \nWhere this is an ongoing investigation we can’t discuss the factors and details that play into the final decision, we are working to establish what they are. We feel badly for the family that lost their pet and understand the impact it has had on them.” ",

      "text": "\nAfter every supermoon, Twitter and Facebook are flooded with fuzzy photos of white glowing orbs kind of floating in a black sea of night. \nBut there are ways to take a good photo of the moon, even with a smartphone. \nMonday’s supermoon will be the closest in its orbit to Earth since 1948. It becomes full Monday morning. \nA super moon rises over the Boynton Beach Inlet in Boynton Beach, Florida on September 8, 2014. (Allen Eyestone / The Palm Beach Post) \n“Don’t make the mistake of photographing the moon by itself, with no reference to anything,” Bill Ingalls, a senior photographer for NASA, told National Geographic . “Instead, think of how to make the image creative — that means tying it into some land-based object. It can be a local landmark or anything to give your photo a sense of place.” \nThe moon begins to set behind the First Baptist Church during a lunar eclipse, October 8, 2014, in West Palm Beach. (Greg Lovett / The Palm Beach Post) \nHere are a few tips from Palm Beach Post photographer Lannis Waters that were first gathered by Palm Beach Post staff writer Staci Sturrock during supermoon events in 2014. Start early. If you’re using a smartphone, try to capture the moon when it’s still near Earth’s horizon, and find something to frame it with in the foreground (trees, buildings, people). “That will help with your exposure because there should still be some light in the sky, and add interest,” Waters says. Go long. Using a DSLR? “Obviously, shoot with as long a lens as possible,” Waters says. “A tripod will help, and is necessary if you’re using a very long lens. Ditto for a cable release or self-timer to avoid adding any vibrations when you fire a frame.” Look for foreground interest. You can’t go wrong composing your photo with either the Lake Worth or Juno Beach pier in the foreground. “Around here, it’s hard to find a place where you can get far enough back to make a skyline work, but there are places where you could get the moon rising through a stand of trees or over buildings, but you need to search for those in advance,” Waters says. (Jupiter Lighthouse, we’re looking at you.) Tap into an app. Waters likes the SkyView app, “which gives you an Augmented Reality view of the sky, and lets you type in the time and date you want so you can see where the moon will be at that time.” Make manual adjustments. Forgo your camera’s automatic settings and use the back of your camera to judge your exposure. “Otherwise the dark sky can make your shot overexposed,” Waters says. “And since the moon is reflecting daylight, the exposure is near what it would be for a sunlit scene in the daytime, so you don’t need a high ISO.” \n\n(Greg Lovett / The Palm Beach Post) \n",

      "text": "Christians protest the holding of a satanic black mass in Oklahoma City on Aug. 15, 2016. (Facebook/TFP Student Action) \n\"No to Satan!\" \nThat rallying cry is expected to fill the air in Portland, Oregon when thousands of Christians are expected to gather outside a school on Wednesday, Nov. 16, to show their opposition to a plan by the Satanic Temple to open an \"After School Satan Club.\" \nMembers of a Satanic Temple earlier announced plans to hold a satanic club open house on that day, CBN News reported. \nIf the satanists' plan pushes through, the Sacramento Elementary School in Portland, Oregon, will become the first school in America to openly welcome Satan inside its doors, according to Charisma News . \nThe Satanic Temple announcement prompted thousands of shocked Christian parents from all over America to rally behind Concerned Catholics and America Needs Fatima to sign a protest petition . Advertisement \n\"Parents are aghast. And so many good people are standing up in peaceful protest,\" America Needs Fatima rally coordinator Francis Slobodnik said in a statement. \n\"More than 87,000 people have signed the petition against Satan Clubs, urging school authorities NOT to allow Satan—the father of lies—into the lives of young children. Every single voice counts against the devil. This needs to be stopped,\" Slobodnik pointed out. \nThe concerned parents are expected to join other Christian protesters on the sidewalk outside the school while the satanic club open house is going on. \n\"Satanism is about lies and darkness. When we say 'God bless America,' we really mean it. We only love God. Satan is not welcome in our culture. Satan should be excluded in our schools because children cannot prosper if they embrace lies, evil and anarchy,\" Slobodnik said. \nHe warned school authorities against allowing the establishment of a Satan Club inside an elementary school. \n\"To dismiss the opening of a Satan Club in an elementary school as something of little importance is to ignore the way Satan works,\" Slobodnik said. \"Once Satan gets in, who will get him out?\"",

By JEFF MARTIN and REBECCA REYNOLDS YONKERAssociated Press \nATLANTA (AP) - A wannabe weatherman was jailed for arson after admitting he started a wildfire to draw attention to his selfie videos on Facebook, his town's police chief said Friday. Meanwhile, a Georgia sheriff appealed for help identifying the driver of a dark blue SUV last seen where other wildfires began. And in North Carolina, authorities suspect arson in more than 20 wildfires burning in a national forest. \n\"It's really too bad because he's not a bad kid - he's just misguided,\" said James Stephens, the police chief in Jenkins, Kentucky, where Johnny Mullins, 21, was arrested this week on a second-degree arson charge. \n\"He likes to do Facebook videos and have people follow him on his 'weather forecast,' so that's pretty much why he did what he did,\" the chief said. \"He enjoyed the attention he got from the Facebook stuff.\" \n\"He didn't realize how much danger he was putting other people in,\" Stephens added. \nA teenager in Harlan County, Kentucky also was arrested for arson this week, and in Tennessee, authorities said Friday that Andrew Scott Lewis was charged with setting fires and vandalism causing more than $250,000 in damage and threatening homes outside Chattanooga. \nNo arrests were announced in most of the rest of the suspicious fires, which have been torching forests in and around the southern Appalachian mountains. The relentless drought across much of the South has removed the usual humidity and sucked wells and streams dry, making the woods ripe for fire. \nTens of thousands of acres have burned, about a dozen of the largest fires remain uncontained and many people to evacuate their homes ahead of fast-moving flames. \nLaw officers in Georgia's Rabun County suspect that someone started a series of small roadside fires Wednesday that eventually merged into the much larger blazes firefighters were working to contain on Friday, said Justin Upchurch, the county's assistant fire chief. \nThe Rabun County sheriff's office urged people to be on the look-out, saying the SUV was last seen in the area of the fires. The office was more emphatic in a separate Facebook post, asking residents to spread the word \"and help us lock this criminal up!!!\" \nThe area is less than 50 miles from North Carolina's Nantahala National Forest, where more than 20 wildfires that have burned more than 17,000 acres are all \"being investigated for suspected arson,\" forestry officials announced in a status update. \nThere were 14 other wildfires burning on Cherokee Nation land in North Carolina, all under investigation by local law enforcement. A fire managers' update noted that the U.S. Bureau of Indian Affairs is seeking information about fires on Indian lands through an arson hotline. \nThe U.S. Forest Service announced Friday that the entire Cohutta Wilderness, which stretches across the Chattahoochee National Forest in Georgia and the Cherokee National Forest in Tennessee, has been closed to the public due to multiple fires there. \nStates of emergency were declared in some of the affected areas to facilitate state and federal spending on the response. \nMore than 5,000 firefighters and support staff from around the nation have joined the effort, said Shardul Raval, director of fire and aviation management for the southern region of the U.S. Forest Service. \nSmoke from the fires has made North Carolina's largest city a Code Orange zone for air quality, meaning anyone with breathing problems could suffer. The Charlotte Observer reports that the heavy haze and smoky conditions should make people limit outdoor activities. \nThat apparently isn't stopping organizers of this weekend's Charlotte Marathon. They said Friday that they do not expect the wildfire smoke to impact Saturday's races, which include a marathon, half-marathon, 5K run/walk, marathon relay and a kids 1-mile fun run. \n___ \nReynolds Yonker reported from Louisville, Kentucky.

      "text": "send to friend Netanyahu criticized for comments about Rabin Incitement The PM's Facebook post in, which he attacked claims that he was responsible for incitement that led to former PM Rabin's assassination in 1995, was widely criticized by former and current members of the Knesset. Yedioth Ahronoth reporters | Published: 13.11.16 , 10:53 \nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke out Saturday evening regarding accusations leveled at him for his role in supposedly inciting the hatred that led to the assassination of then-Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin on November 4, 1995. \nFollow Ynetnews on Facebook and Twitter \n\nIn a Facebook post, Netanyahu called Rabin's killing a \"shocking political murder that all of us condemn,\" and wrote that, \"since the murder, there have been continuous attempts to distort the historical truth and blame me for the incitement that preceded the killing.\" \n\nA video was added to the post, which Netanyahu claimed contained, \"Some of the unequivocal things I said in condemnation of the invective pointed at the prime minister … Judge for yourself.\" \nPM Netanyahu at a memorial ceremony for former PM Rabin, 2015. (Photo: Haim Zach/GPO) \nThe video shows – among other things – Netanyahu attempting to calm people in the crowd at a political rally, telling them that Rabin is not a traitor as they were labeling him, and that he should be treated as a political rival rather than an enemy. \n\nFormer Prime Minister Ehud Barak responded on Twitter, writing, \"(Netanyahu) isn't to blame for the murder of Rabin, but was and is the lead inciter, then in Zion Square and at the 'funeral' in Ra'anana, and today in the responses to Uvda and Weitz, backed by Bitan and whiney posts.\" \n\nCurrent Knesset opposition members also responded to the PM's post. MK Revital Swid (Zionist Union) wrote, \"The prime minister is denying incitement from 21 years ago, while ignoring systematic incitement that characterizes his conduct today as well. Arabs, leftist organizations, the media, and others are an object of Netanyahu's incitement on a regular basis. \n\nMK Michal Rozin (Meretz) responded as well, writing, \"Despite the prime minister's many attempts – history cannot be re-written. Netanyahu is weak in leadership, (and) strong in denial. He was and is the baron of incitement, that's his way and that's how his time in office will be remembered.\" \nFormer PM Ehud Barak. Wrote the Netanyahu, \"Was and is the lead inciter.\" (Photo: Courtesy of the Darkenu movemet) \n\nSunday, November 13 marks the official memorial day for Rabin's murder, and will feature ceremonies in schools around the country, as well as an official memorial ceremony on Mount Herzl in Jerusalem. \n\nItamar Eichner, Amihai Attali, and Tsahi Dabush contributed to this report \n",

      "text": "By Cherie Burbach Updated July 27, 2015 . \nFacebook can be a bonding element in friendships today, providing an easy way to stay in touch and nurture the relationship , or it can drive a wedge. Excessive posts, communicating only through the site, and too much complaining by your friend can make you want to hit the unfriend button. Should you? \nBefore You Unfriend \nMost friends won’t understand that when you unfriend them, you don’t want to end the friendship but just end their obnoxious posts. Today, unfriending has become an issue that signifies “I’m unhappy with our friendship as a whole” rather than just being unhappy with the communication on the site. One study showed that acquaintances and old high school friends were the ones people unfriended the most. \nBefore you unfriend, consider other options, like: Controlling the posts you see in your feed The amount of time you spend on the site (maybe Facebook in general is a little too overwhelming) Not responding through Facebook email and instead following up with phone or text \ncontinue reading below our video 5 Most Common Signs of a Doomed Relationship Limiting your friend’s view of your page \nTalking With Your Friend About Facebook \nVery often the people that bug us most on Facebook are the ones that use it more than we do. We might log on to check things here and there but our friend is probably on it daily. If your friend uses Facebook for everything, even to announce things in their life or send emails, chances are you’ll miss posts and updates, even if you’re not purposely trying to block them. \nFriends can get very offended if they post a question or issue and expect you to respond. Let them know you don’t use Facebook in the same way they do, and that if they want a response they’ll have to call or email you through a regular account. \nIf your friend is posting things about you that you don’t like ( unflattering pictures or private information you shared just with them), you’ll have to let them know about your own personal boundaries . Tell them you don’t appreciate when they spread your news on Facebook or even talk about your personal life in any way. \nYour Friend Posts Annoying Things on Facebook \nMaybe the issue is that your friend posts political opinions, religious thoughts that conflict with yours, or rants that you’re just sick of hearing. It’s one thing to accept the differences in a friendship , but when you’re confronted with them over and over on Facebook, it may change the way you feel about your friend. \nLook at it this way, your friend is also choosing what happens with his or her friendships when they post their opinions over and over. They know there is a possibility that they could offend someone or have a friend disagree with them. If you’re annoyed at what your friend is posting , chances are other friends are as well. Perhaps your friend won’t have a clue that what they’re doing is driving people away until they lose a few friends. \nIn the meantime, telling a friend that their opinions bother you may make the situation worse. Spending time away from Facebook or blocking them might be the only way to really drive home the point that you’re tired of their online rants. \nWhen Facebook Changes Your Friendship \nYour friend, despite you asking for them to respect your wishes, may choose to ignore you. Instead of calling you to see if you can get together, for example, they may continue to post on Facebook alone and leave you out. You might miss out on things because of this. \nRemember that you can’t change your friends, you can only change yourself. If you make the choice to stay off Facebook or take your friend’s posts out of your feed, you’re taking the chance that your friendship will change because of this. \nIt’s never easy when a friendship doesn’t go the way you want it. If your friend is inflexible, you have to make the choice to pull away from Facebook and see where your friendship goes from there. You might need to make an extra effort with phone calls or other forms of communication then.",

      "text": "As shared on Facebook, March 27, 2013: \nManure... An interesting fact \nManure: In the 16th and 17th centuries, everything had to be Transported by ship and it was also before the invention of commercial Fertilizers, so large shipments of manure were quite common. It was shipped dry, because in dry form it weighed a lot less than when Wet, but once water (at sea) hit it, not only did it become heavier, But the process of fermentation began again, of which a byproduct is Methane gas of course. As the stuff was stored below decks in bundles You can see what could (and did) happen. Methane began to build up below decks and the first time someone came Below at night with a lantern, BOOOOM! Several ships were destroyed in this manner before it was determined Just what was happening \nAfter that, the bundles of manure were always stamped with the Instruction ' Stow high in transit ' on them, which meant for the Sailors to stow it high enough off the lower decks so that any water That came into the hold would not touch this volatile cargo and start The production of methane. \nThus evolved the term ' S.H.I.T ' , (Stow High In Transit) which has Come down through the centuries and is in use to this very day. You probably did not know the true history of this word. Neither did I. I had always thought it was a golf term. \ncontinue reading below our video Best Vacation Reads of 2015 \nExample #2: From a Usenet posting dated April 12, 1999: \nSubject: origin of sh*t \nIn the 1800's, cow pie's were collected on the prarie and boxed and loaded on steam ships to burn instead of wood. Wood was not only hard to find, but heavy to move around and store. \nWhen the boxes of cow pie's were in the sun for days on board the ships, they would smell bad. So when the manure was boxed up, they stamped the outside of the box, S.H.I.T....which means Ship High In Transit. \nWhen people came aboard the ship and said,\"Oh what is that smell!\" They were told it was sh*t. \nThat is where the saying came from...It smells like sh*t! :-) \nAnalysis: Clever as all that may be, whoever came up with it doesn't know sh*t about \"sh*t.\" \nAccording to my dictionary, the word is much older than the 1800s, appearing in its earliest form about 1,000 years ago as the Old English verb scitan . That is confirmed by lexicographer Hugh Rawson in his bawdily edifying book, Wicked Words (New York: Crown, 1989), where it is further noted that the expletive is distantly related to words like science , schedule and shield , all of which derive from the Indo-European root skei- , meaning \"to cut\" or \"to split.\" You get the idea. \nFor most of its history \"sh*t\" was spelled \"sh*te\" (and sometimes still is), but the modern, four-letter spelling of the word can be found in texts dating as far back as the mid-1700s. It most certainly did not originate as an acronym invented by 19th-century sailors. \nApropos that false premise, Rawson observes that \"sh*t\" has long been the subject of naughty wordplay, very often based on made-up acronyms on the order of \"Ship High in Transit.\" For example: In the Army, officers who did not go to West Point have been known to disparage the military academy as the South Hudson Institute of Technology.... And if an angelic six-year-old asks, \"Would you like to have some Sugar Honey Iced Tea?\", the safest course is to pretend that you have suddenly gone stone deaf. \nLastly, all these stories are reminiscent of another popular specimen of folk etymology claiming that the f-word (another good old-fashioned, all-purpose, four-letter expletive) originated as the acronym of \"Fornication Under Consent of the King\" (or, in another version, \"For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge\"). \nSuffice it to say, it's all C.R.A.P. \nSources and further reading:",

      "text": "By Brian Ives \nOn Sunday morning, a new mini documentary was posted on the Facebook page “His Royal Highness,” which has served as an ad hoc Prince page over the past few months. The nearly eight minute film focuses on Prince’s charitable efforts, most of which were done in secret.\nRelated: Bruce Springsteen on Prince: ‘I Felt a Great Kinship’ \nIt begins with Geoffrey Canada, the founder of the Harlem’s Children Zone explaining how he discovered that Prince was interested in donating to his organization. He was told that “Prince” wanted to speak with him on the phone. “No, Prince Charles has already visited the Harlem’s Children Zone,” he said. The response he got: “‘No: Prince, Prince .'”\n“‘You mean, the real Prince?'”\nMr. Canada describes their conversation: “I want to help you,” Prince told him. “I don’t want anybody to know about this. I just want to help you. I’m going to give the Harlem’s Children Zone a million dollars.”\nHe asked, “But we’re not going to tell anybody about it?”\nPrince’s response: “It’ll ruin it if anybody hears. If you have been blessed the way that I have… I have to give back. And not to do so in a way that says, ‘What a wonderful person you are.'”\nThere are similar stories in the doc about how Prince approached former President Obama aide Van Jones and singer Janelle Monae. And Jones says, “Eighty-five to ninety-five percent — easily — of the people he helped, have no idea he helped them. No idea. [They] Would be stunned!”\nThe doc also features interviews with Prince’s brother and sister, as well as Alicia Garza, the co-founder of the Black Lives Matter movement, who noted that “He was one of the first donors to Black Lives Matter, it was important in its symbolism, it was important in its very clear statement, that he believed in what we were doing and what we were doing was important.”\nWatch the entire short film at His Royal Highnesses Facebook page .",

(Photo: iStockphoto) \nBreaking up is hard to do. Add a house and tens of thousands of dollars into the mix, and it can get downright ugly. \nUnlike romantic entanglements, though, breaking up with your real estate agent as a seller if you’re not getting the service or the results promised doesn’t have to be dramatic. Here’s what you can do early on to minimize the damage — and how to handle the situation if, alas, you do come to irreconcilable differences. When you first enlist an agent \nReview your contract closely. Many real estate agents require their clients to sign an exclusive representation agreement, which is essentially an employment contract, says Brian Pendergraft, a real estate attorney in Greenbelt, Md. These contracts spell out how the client and real estate agent will each uphold their end of the deal, and they tend to be worded to protect the agent’s interests, says David Reiss, a law professor at Brooklyn Law School in Brooklyn, New York. Which kind of real estate agent is the right one for you \nAs a seller, you’ll want to ensure the contract covers your rights, too. This includes outlining exactly how your agent will market your home, and a plan to generate enough showings within a set timeframe so that you’ll have a legal leg to stand on for early termination, Reiss says. \nUnderstand your options for termination from the get-go. There are a few ways to call it quits with your agent, but the win-win situation is a no-penalty termination in which neither party is penalized if the relationship ends prematurely, says Bruce Ailion, a Realtor and attorney in Atlanta. Include this detail in your contract. If things go sour \nConsider what constitutes a fireable offense. If you’re upset with your agent about sales strategy, lack of communication or poor service, those are issues that are unlikely to be resolved easily, Ailion says. Or perhaps you’re worried that your agent is in murky legal waters, such as refusing to show your home to people from certain protected groups or failing to share a property disclosure with buyers. Report these issues immediately to the agent’s broker of record, who is responsible for the real estate agents in a brokerage, Ailion says. \nPut it in writing. If your agreement is in writing, you have to get out of it in writing even if there’s no specific expiration date, Pendergraft says. Write a letter or email to your agent requesting to part ways. If you get no response, hire an attorney to write a demand letter for you, Pendergraft says. This shows you mean business — at a fraction of the cost to take the issue to court. Are you sabotaging the sale of your home? \nYou might still owe money. If you do manage to get out of your contract early, you might still be on the hook for paying out-of-pocket marketing costs, even if your home doesn’t sell. Look for language about this in your contract, as well as how the real estate agent will be compensated and other costs you might be responsible for.",

We finally decided to meet in person on a date. He came with flowers and it was a great date. On the date he talked about future dates with us. He seemed to like me. When i got home he messaged me an hour after saying he had a great time. The next day he messaged me good morning. We talked for two days after that and then he started to drift...why? Maybe he wasnt attracted to me and did not want to reject me right away to make me feel bad :/ But he did call me beautiful after he saw me a couple of times. We havent talked for a week now, occasionally he does snapchat me a picture of his food or dog and i didnt respond, but thats about it. what do u think i should do to get his attention again.

      "text": "Facebook 1 Twitter \nIn theory, it sounds like a great idea. Things I Have Drawn is the Instagram account of a father-son combo who riff off each other’s artistic abilities. \nDom, the son, is six years old and draws pictures of everyday animals and objects. They’re really good for a six-year-old. His dad then utilises his digital art skills to create real-life versions of the images, staying true to the elements and proportions of the original. \nThe results are terrifying. It’s not so much that the original pictures are that bad. It’s more that the father’s design skills are so accurate that they really bring out the weirder aspects of the drawings. \nHaving said that, the collection of works has a warm feel given the father-son combo, and on the whole, they are way funnier than they are unsettling. Maybe you could even grow to love them. Or not. Like (1) Videos from Lost At E Minor TV Connect with us",

      "text": "How Facebook can escape the echo chamber Posted Snapchat’s Spectacles are now on sale near Big Sur in California \nFacebook may have built an influence so large that it’s cracking under the weight of the power and influence of its News Feed. \nMark Zuckerberg began an interview on stage at Techonomy16 discussing the evolution of the News Feed and Facebook’s impact on the election. Post-election, journalists politicians, and pundits have questioned Facebook’s role in shaping the campaign and its outcome , debating the merits of Facebook’s position of primacy as a source of information. \nZuckerberg defended the News Feed’s progress arguing that the filter bubble isn’t an issue for Facebook . He suggested the real problem is that people by nature engage with content they like and find agreeable, and dismiss things they don’t agree with online as they would in real life. \n“You’d be surprised at how many things we dismiss,” he said. “The problem isn’t that the diverse information isn’t there…but that we haven’t gotten people to engage with it in higher proportions.” \nWhat are the tools that could help us escape the echo chamber? \nIf Facebook won’t change its algorithms for fear of going against its wildly successful revenue model or expand its Trending Topics product, it needs to implement better features to help diversify the content we see. First, Facebook should hire human journalists to curate stories during elections. They should pick the best stories from a variety of sources and perspectives and flag them on Facebook as good quality and worthy of reading. Also: Fact checking. Google did it. Now it’s Facebook’s turn. Since the personalized News Feed favors what we engage with, and we tend to engage with content we agree with, Facebook should provide an option to turn this off during elections to allow people to see algorithm-free, real-time content. Imagine being able to activate a filter that would show you what your Facebook-specified Republican or Democratic or Libertarian etc. friends were sharing. Facebook could create a feature that allows people to declare endorsement for a candidate, and users could then build a feed to see what that pool of friends was posting about as well as the conversation around their posts. Facebook could curate and flag certain content as partisan, and those stories could appear with a link to an Instant Article of the opposing viewpoint or from an opposing news source (however, since not every issue is purely partisan — and not every news source either — this could get tricky). Trending Topics should be expanded and should display more takes on political stories, not just what the highest number of people are talking about. Facebook could use the “Suggested Videos” window that pops up when you watch a video to its completion to surface opposing viewpoints. Facebook could show a post from a candidate on the opposing side whenever a politician posts from their account. Facebook is missing a huge opportunity to use its tech to help us be more bipartisan during this politically divided time in U.S. history. \nFacebook is hiding behind its “we’re a tech company, not a media company ” guise in an effort to excuse itself from the fact that it hasn’t figured out the news. For such an influential platform that preaches social responsibility and prioritizes user experience, it’s irresponsible for Facebook to give people such a powerful megaphone for personal expression, only to lock them inside an echo chamber. \nDespite what Zuckerberg claims, Facebook profoundly affected the way the U.S. consumed the election , just as it has shaped our news experience whether it wants to our not. \nI don’t recommend using Facebook as a sole news source. But 44 percent of adults in the U.S. use Facebook as a source for news, a Pew report detailed earlier this year . Another study found that Facebook saw an increase of almost 30 percent on election night compared to a typical evening. \nIt’s safe to say that a solid number of people were banking on Facebook for election updates, live video and as a stage for their own social commentary. \nIs this all a pipe dream? \nIf Facebook routinely showed users things they found distasteful or viewed as incorrect, its audience wouldn’t want to use it as much. Facebook’s revenue model profits (you know, that cool $7B revenue in Q3 ) from a strategy of making its 1.79 billion users feel validated (and more likely to engage ) with its personalized algorithm . \nIt wants to keep us in a bubble of comfort where our views are repeated back to us in the News Feed. So yes, Facebook makes money by algorithmically favoring content that affirms our opinions. Why would it want to change? And are people even ready for a fair Feed? With its massive influence, Facebook may have the ability to change this by offering both sides. \nWhat is Facebook currently doing? \nFacebook has offered lip service about breaking out of the echo chamber. Its data was used in the Wall Street Journal’s Blue Feed, Red Feed experiment to juxtapose a liberal Facebook and conservative Facebook feed sourced from users’ self-proclaimed political views and what they shared. \nThis year, Facebook published an odd video in a lackluster plea for us to play nice this election season, offering up its search bar as a resource to discover new viewpoints (Facebook’s search may be the least useful function on the platform). Its election Hub was a hands-on guide for information about the election aimed at helping people learn about candidates, policy and ballot propositions. \nIt also supposedly helped over 2 million people become registered voters . But the way users are interacting with the ‘lean back’ News Feed experience is important too. \nFacebook is missing a huge opportunity to use its tech to help us see content through a more bipartisan lens during this politically divided time in U.S. history when it could also potentially change our proclivity to ignore the other side. As a company that has always prioritized the user experience, Facebook could be doing much more. 0",

For now, segments of President-elect Trump’s 60 Minutes interview can also be seen below.\nMr. Trump’s full 60 Minutes interview should also be available before long on the CBS website of full episodes.\n[Image by Charlie Neibergall/AP Images] Meanwhile, President-elect Trump spoke on 60 Minutes about the power of using Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to draw followers and get Mr. Trump’s message out to the public.\nPresident-elect Trump called social media “where it’s at” — and refused to agree that he would totally tone down his social media messages from some of the heated things Mr. Trump has tweeted in the past.\nInstead, President-elect Trump credited his huge social media following with giving him a platform to refute any messages promoted by the mainstream media that he felt were incorrect.\n\nMr. Trump also spoke about Obamacare in the 60 Minutes interview, along with President-elect Trump’s previous promise to totally repeal President Obama’s healthcare law.\nOn 60 Minutes with Leslie Stahl, however, Mr. Trump seemed to pivot on that promise, while still claiming that he would not leave anyone uncovered via the Obamacare changes — not even for as short of a time period as two days.\nThe 60 Minutes interview with Mr. Trump is already being satirized in the New Yorker article titled “Trump Confirms That He Just Googled Obamacare,” by Andy Borowitz , a man who writes plenty of satire about political topics.\nMeanwhile, President-elect Trump promised that he will continue to leverage social media as he enters the White House.\nAlong with Mr. Trump showing up for Sunday’s 60 Minutes interview, which airs at 7 p.m. ET/PT, Melania Trump will appear as well — including Mr. Trump’s children.\n\nMr. Trump not only praised social media as a wonderful modern form of communication, President-elect Trump mentioned his 28 million followers on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram, along with the effect that those followers had upon helping him win the presidency.\nMr. Trump’s campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, spoke of President-elect Trump’s chief of staff appointment , reports CBS News, with Conway promising Mr. Trump would appoint one soon.\n[Image by Charlie Neibergall/AP Images] On 60 Minutes , Mr. Trump spoke of how restrained he would be with Twitter, Facebook and Instagram as President Trump.\n“It’s a great form of communication. Now do I say I’ll give it up entirely and throw out, that’s a tremendous form– I pick up– I’m picking up now, I think I picked up yesterday 100,000 people. I’m not saying I love it, but it does get the word out. When you give me a bad story or when you give me an inaccurate story or when somebody other than you and another– a network, or whatever, because of course, CBS would never do a thing like that right? I have a method of fighting back. That’s very tough–\n“I’m going to be very restrained, if I use it at all, I’m going to be very restrained. I find it tremendous. It’s a modern form of communication. There should be nothing we should be ashamed of. It’s– it’s where it’s at. I do believe this, I really believe that– the fact that I have such power in terms of numbers with Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, et cetera, I think it helped me win all of these races where they’re spending much more money than I spent. And I won. I think that social media has more power than the money they spent, and I think maybe to a certain extent, I proved that.”\n[Featured Image by José Luis Magaña/AP Images]\nDonald Trump’s ’60 Minutes’ Full Interview: Facebook, Twitter, Instagram Helped Trump Win — Trump Family, Obamacare Pivot Featured [Videos] is an article from: The Inquisitr News \n",

Post to Facebook Georgia State fires coach Trent Miles Miles was 9-38 overall in four seasons.  //usat.ly/2fPzjvQ   Georgia State fires coach Trent Miles Dan Wolken , USA TODAY Sports 1:05 p.m.   Former Georgia State Panthers head coach Trent Miles. (Photo:   Sports) \nGeorgia State fired coach Trent Miles on Sunday after a 2-8 start to the season. \nThe move was not a surprise. Miles, whose record was 9-38 overall in four seasons, was on the verge of being fired last season until the Panthers won four consecutive games to reach bowl eligibility for the first time in school history. \nThat was enough to save Miles' job for another year, but the program backslid this season and was just 1-5 in the Sun Belt. \nGeorgia State didn't even play football until 2010 and was planning on a slow build as a an FCS program. Instead, it got an invitation to the Sun Belt and had to rush its transition to FBS, a strategic error that has plagued the program since Day 1. Georgia State receives approval to buy Turner Field \nThe good news is Georgia State's next coach will get a fresh start, at least some foundation of an FBS roster and a new stadium. Just last week, Georgia State officially completed its purchase of Turner Field from the city of Atlanta and will convert the Braves' former home into a 23,000-seat football venue with surrounding campus expansion. \nGiven its location, this could be one of the best jobs in the Sun Belt if athletics director Charlie Cobb makes the right hire. \nMiles will be owed just under $300,000 as a buyout. \nContributing: Steve Berkowitz",

      "text": "share Facebook has been under the spotlight following the results of this week’s presidential election. While Mark Zuckerberg has dismissed claims that his company has unduly influenced the election, others at Facebook are beginning to look closely at their role in the media landscape, according to The New York Times . Last night, Zuckerberg posted a lengthy status update to his page , outlining his thoughts on his company's role in the election, noting that \"99 percent of what people see is authentic. Only a very small amount is fake news and hoaxes.\" \n\"99 percent of what people see is authentic\" According to The New York Times , several senior officials at the company began chatting internally late Tuesday evening, \"questioning what [Facebook's] responsibilities might be.\" This election appears to be a wakeup for the company, which has seen itself itself as a blank slate for anyone to express themselves and their views. Earlier this week, the company did admit that it has \"more work to do\" when it comes to combatting misinformation, even as it attempts to avoid becoming a referee. Zuckerberg noted that Facebook has launched an initiative to allow users to flag fake and hoax stories, and that it has more work ahead of it. However, he pushed back on the idea that the company was in the media business, responding to one commenter that \"news and media are not the primary things people do on Facebook, so I find it odd when people insist we call ourselves a news or media company in order to acknowledge its importance.\" \n62 percent of Americans got some news from social media Despite Zuckerberg's comments, social media is becoming a major way in which people get their news, according to a PEW research report released earlier this year . The report found that 62 percent of Americans got some news from social media, with 18 percent receiving most of it through social media channels. While many at Facebook believe that their work has a positive impact on the world, they also appear to be grappling with how information is shared and displayed across the social media site. The company has faced several challenges this year, such as editorial bias in their trending topics team and the removal of a historic war photo . The company faced further problems after it terminated the editorial team responsible for trending topics in favor of an automated selection, only to find that fake stories were being delivered to users . Despite Facebook’s efforts to take steps to limit the flow of misinformation, Zuckerberg noted that this isn’t a straightforward task: some information can be debunked outright, other stories can be more difficult to parse. However, there are excellent resources resources out there that are already combatting online hoaxes and fake news reports that Facebook could use to guide it: Snopes , which researches a wide range of memes and articles to assess their accuracy, and PolitiFact , which has been fact checking politicians for years. While Facebook might not believe that they have a problem with misinformation, they should look at the number of times someone posts a comment pointing to a Snopes article.",

      "text": "share Photo by Drew Angerer/Getty Images During the 2016 election, Facebook showed fake news stories to millions of voters. Because these stories were disproportionately pro-Trump (inaccurately claiming, for example, that the Pope had endorsed Trump and that an FBI agent involved in investigating Hillary Clinton had been murdered ), that has caused some people to wonder if Facebook itself had contributed to Trump’s victory . This article is part of New Money , a new section on economics, technology, and business. On Saturday, Zuckerberg addressed his critics with a new post on Facebook. He insisted that “on Facebook, more than 99% of what people see is authentic” — though given that news is a minority of the content of what people see on Facebook, that doesn’t actually mean the fake news problem is trivial. Zuckerberg argues that it’s “extremely unlikely hoaxes changed the outcome of this election.” At the same time, he said Facebook is taking the problem seriously: We don't want any hoaxes on Facebook. Our goal is to show people the content they will find most meaningful, and people want accurate news. We have already launched work enabling our community to flag hoaxes and fake news, and there is more we can do here. We have made progress, and we will continue to work on this to improve further. This is an area where I believe we must proceed very carefully though. Identifying the \"truth\" is complicated. While some hoaxes can be completely debunked, a greater amount of content, including from mainstream sources, often gets the basic idea right but some details wrong or omitted. An even greater volume of stories express an opinion that many will disagree with and flag as incorrect even when factual. I am confident we can find ways for our community to tell us what content is most meaningful, but I believe we must be extremely cautious about becoming arbiters of truth ourselves. He’s obviously right that this is a hard problem, and that caution is warranted. Still, I think it’s a mistake to frame the problem as merely rooting out “hoaxes.” Facebook’s goal should be to help users find the best content possible. Limiting the distribution of obviously fake news is the bare minimum Facebook can do. But I think Facebook can also add value at the opposite end of the quality spectrum, identifying articles that are thoughtful and thoroughly reported (and publications with a track record of producing such articles) and giving those an extra boost in the News Feed algorithm. An advantage of this approach is that it makes it less necessary to make hard judgment calls about whether a particular article is so fake that it needs to be blocked outright. Low-quality news (whether outright hoaxes or just sloppy journalism) will just naturally get less exposure because people will only see it after scrolling through the higher-quality news their friends have shared.

      "text": "Like Us On Facebook \nI absolutely love weddings . I’m also a super sappy chick. \nSo you can imagine putting those two things together. When it’s time for the traditional father-daughter dance, I start to get v. emotional and tear up… most especially when this girl has a drink in her hand from the open bar. \nBut to be completely honest, even if I didn’t know the bride and her father here and was just a tiny fly on the wall watching them dance, I’d probably still cry my heart out. \nWhen I was a little girl, it was one of my favorite things in the world to go to the father-daughter dance with my dad. My mom would always buy me the most beautiful dress and coordinating “party shoes,” as I liked to call them. \nI would get my hair done, and my dad would buy me a beautiful corsage that matched my dress perfectly. Standing on his feet as we danced the night away was the norm because I was (and still am/forever will be) Daddy’s little girl. \nWhen I saw this bride’s dance with her dad, I thought it would be the typical tearjerker of a father-daughter wedding number. The video begins with Mikayla Phillips and her dad, Nathan Ellison, slow dancing to Bob Carlisle’s “Butterfly Kisses.” \n*Waterfall of tears commence* \nBut THEN, the dance transforms into something entirely new and unique. This father-daughter duo surprised everyone. \nThey whip out sunglasses and MAJOR MOVES on the dance floor as M.C. Hammer’s “Can’t Touch This” comes on and the dance turns into an insane mashup of awesome jams. YouTube \nThis dad has so much swag on the dance floor, it’s unreal. I’m kind of jealous, to be honest. \nPhillips opened up to ABC News, saying, \nEvery night [in the week] prior to the wedding we’d run through it a few times. I think since we’d talked about it for years that it was pretty easy for it to come together. \nFor real, though, they totally crushed it. \n ",

He had, police say, a twisted way of attracting publicity to his ambitions. \n\"He likes to do Facebook videos and have people follow him on his 'weather forecast,'\" Jenkins, Kentucky, police Chief James Stephens told the AP. \"So that's pretty much why he did what he did. He enjoyed the attention he got from the Facebook stuff.\" \nHe's not alone in wanting the get attention on Facebook.

EVERY major news item has been, well take your pick: persuading electors to vote for Hillary, anti-Trump \"protests\", Robert Di Nino, Michael Moore, the #notmypresident and #safetypin hashtags, Trump endangering the Affordable Care Act, Aaron Sorkin's letter to his daughter... \nZuckerberg has no credibility whatsoever setting himself and Facebook up as brokers in truthful information. 6 posted on 11/13/2016 1:44:15 PM PST by Ciaphas Cain [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies ] To: E.
