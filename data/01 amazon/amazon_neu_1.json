      "text": "5:14pm PT by Lesley Goldberg Robert De Niro, Julianne Moore Drama From David O. Russell Lands at Amazon Andrew Toth, Anthony Harvey/FilmMagic De Niro and Moore The Weinstein Co. will produce the untitled drama in what is said to be a rich two-season 16-episode commitment. \nAmazon's spending spree continues. \nThe streaming service and retail hub has landed a drama series package from David O. Russell that stars Oscar winners Robert De Niro and Julianne Moore,   \nSources tell THR that Amazon has committed to a two-season order — eight episodes each — for the mafia drama with each installment written and directed by Russell. The series is said to have landed at Amazon with a price tag of a whopping $160 million. Insiders told THR that Russell was seeking $1 million an episode just to hear the pitch, with Amazon now appearing to have agreed to his terms (though the initial pitch had the project eyeing a $20 million payday for 20 episodes). The series was first announced in August with multiple offers coming in for the package sight unseen at the time. De Niro is said to have scored $850,000 per episode for the series. \nScott Lambert, Alexandra Milchan and Megan Ellison of Annapurna Pictures (Russell's American Hustle, Joy ) are attached to produce the series with Russell at the helm. \nRussell's largest TV commitment to date is 2014's The Club , which was picked up with a 12-episode straight-to-series order at ABC. He quickly exited the project and ABC reversed course on the series, which was poised to star Betsy Brandt. \nFor Amazon, the Russell package comes two weeks after the streamer ponied up what is said to be $ 70 million to land Mad Men creator Matthew Weiner's TV follow up with an eight-episode straight-to-series order. The anthology landed at Amazon with six other outlets competing for the project, which like the Russell drama, will be produced by The Weinstein Co. \nThe Russell drama comes as A-list talent continues to segue to the small screen, where many are drawn by limited episode counts, stronger creative and more time to explore the material and characters. On the TV side, high-level talent helps broadcast, cable and streaming outlets cut through the increasing amount of original scripted programming in the so-called Peak TV world where talent and recognizable IP are considered keys to breaking through the clutter. \nThe Russell/De Niro/Moore project comes after Russell earned back-to-back screenwriting Oscar nominations for Silver Linings Playbook and American Hustle . Moore recently won an Emmy for HBO's Game Change . De Niro, for his part, scored a supporting Oscar nomination for his role in Silver Lining Playbook . \nCAA reps De Niro, Moore and Russell.",

      "text": "\nHoliday Shopping is well under way. Amazon has had their countdown to Black Friday running since the day after Halloween. Walmart stores were stocking their Christmas sections at the beginning of October. Black Friday advertisements are being leaked all across the internet as we speak, and one company that many felt was down and out seems to be showing up on several of the holiday lists, Nintendo.\nNintendo made the call at the beginning of 2016 to announce to the world that a new home console system, known now as the Switch, would be coming out in Spring 2017. This effectively killed any momentum that was left for their current home console the Wii U. While some questions their strategy, Nintendo had a plan, and according to numbers and experts, they look poised to have a significant share of the holiday shopping in 2016.\nPokemon Sun and Pokemon Moon In case you do not have a smartphone, there was a phenomenon that swept the world this year known as Pokemon GO . A simple free-to-play app that allowed a player to catch Pokemon in the real world. The app is well on it’s way to grossing over $1 billion. Survey Monkey called Pokemon GO the “most popular mobile game in US history.”\n[Image by The Pokemon Company] While Nintendo is just part owners of The Pokemon Company, the core Pokemon games are exclusive to Nintendo handhelds. November 18 will see the release of the much anticipated next installment of the Pokemon series, Pokemon Sun and Pokemon Moon . As of this writing, Nintendo has stated that these games are the most pre-ordered games in the history of the company.\nForbes goes on to explain that the excitement for Pokemon Sun and Pokemon Moon is directly related to the popularity of Pokemon GO . This is not the first time Nintendo utilized GO’s popularity. At one point in the summer during GO’s most popular months, the 3DS handheld system was the most popular system in the world despite the fact it was released in 2011.\nNew Nintendo 3DS For $99.99 Anticipating the momentum of Pokemon Sun and Pokemon Moon , Nintendo has announced for Black Friday two New Nintendo 3DS systems. One is black, and one is white, and they feature characters from the Super Mario Bros . series. More importantly, they can be picked up for $99.99. Polygon spoke with a Nintendo representative who confirmed these two systems will be the only ones at that price , but most major retailers will have them in stock.\n[Image by Nintendo of America] A Nintendo 2DS is also available. It is currently priced at $79.99, but no specials have been announced for it at this time. Some sites speculate that Black Friday could see a discount for it as well.\nNES Classic Edition Nintendo stunned everyone in the summer with the announcement of the NES Classic Edition. The miniature form of the Nintendo Entertainment System would come with a preloaded 30 original Nintendo games. The internet instantly went crazy, and people have been clamouring for it every since.\nAs we draw closer to holiday shopping, the NES Classic Edition is prominently featured in every major retailer’s toy catalog including Target and Toys R Us. At just $59.99, many are expecting the system to be almost impossible to obtain especially considering the fact that no retailer in the United States is taking pre-orders including Amazon and GameStop.\nDespite the fact that the Nintendo Switch is still the better part of four months away, Nintendo is poised to make a big splash this season. The NES Classic Edition alone should keep their names in front of parents. An affordable New 3DS system and a new Pokemon game to play as the days get too short for GO should keep players satisfied. Will your holiday shopping consist of anything from Nintendo?\n[Feature Image by Nintendo of America]\nHoliday Shopping: Nintendo Looking For Major Market Share is an article from: The Inquisitr News \n",

      "text": "SHARE 0 \nBack in August, we learned that The Silver Linings Playbook and American Hustle director David O. Russell was putting together a TV project with Julianne Moore and Robert De Niro set to star. It was obvious from the word “go” that this series was going to be a major get and prestige player for whatever network landed it, and today brings the news that Amazon and The Weinstein Company have secured a two-season commitment for the series for a pretty penny — $160 million to be exact. \nThe report from Deadline also offers up some new details on the untitled series, which is reportedly a mafia crime drama (the first report suggested it was set in the 90s, but no time period is mentioned in the latest update). Each of the two seasons will consist of eight episodes, with Russell writing and directing the lot. Russell will also produce alongside Annapurna Pictures’ Megan Ellison , who collaborated with Russell on Joy and American Hustle , as well as Alexandra Milchan ( Bullett to the Head ) and Scott Lambert ( Paranoia ). Image via The Weinstein Company \nAmazon and The Weinstein Co. reportedly won out in a competitive situation, with FX also vying for the project. And the streaming service makes a natural fit for the auteur-driven series (though FX would have been a grand pairing as well), having recently provided a home for Woody Allen ‘s Crisis in Six Scenes and Walt Stillman ‘s The Cosmopolitans . Amazon and The Weinstein Company recently teamed up for another high-profile score with Mad Men creator Matthew Weiner ‘s untitled return to TV. Russell previously teamed with The Weinstein Company on The Fighter and Silver Linings Playbook . \nIt’s always fascinating to see how a long-time filmmaker adapts to the TV medium and exciting when that filmmaker is given creative control over the entirety of the series. It’s the kind of auteur-driven approach that led to the success of Carey Fukunaga ‘s first season of True Detective and Stephen Soderbergh ‘s work on The Knick , where you can see the vision of the single helmer played out over a long-form narrative. I’ve found Russell’s films to be a bit bloated as of late, so I’m particularly curious to see how he utilizes the unique pacing of the serialized format. \nWhat do you guys think? Is David O. Russell a good fit for the TV format? Is Amazon a good fit for Russell? Did you ever think you’d see Robert De Niro in a TV series? Sound off in the comments. Related Content ",

      "title": "Could Amazon offer housekeeping as its latest Prime perk?",
      "text": "It looks like Amazon is getting into delivering more than just products — the company may soon let you hire workers, too. The company just put up two listings in Seattle for housekeepers that would be part of the Amazon Assistants program.\nAccording to the listings, the housekeepers would be hired by Amazon to do things like tidy up around the house, do laundry, and help put away groceries. The listings first surfaced in a report from the Seattle Times .\nMore: Amazon Prime is being offered at an aggressive discount in India\nAccording to the report, Amazon could offer housekeeping simply as a part of its Amazon Prime subscription, with the goal apparently being for Amazon to play a role in developing an “errand-free” household.\nIt would be an interesting move for Amazon, to be sure, but it highlights just how creative the company is getting to convince potential subscribers to sign up to Amazon Prime. Traditionally the company has offered services like quicker shipping on items and access to music and video streaming services.\nRecently, however, Amazon has been developing original content for the service, such as the highly anticipated The Grand Tour , a show starring Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond, and James May, who rose to fame as the hosts of the previous iteration of the BBC’s Top Gear.\nAmazon Prime has been so successful that it has become one of the main focuses for the company, as demonstrated by the fact that it could soon start offering more interesting services like housekeeping. If it turns out that Amazon is indeed offering housekeeping as part of Prime, it’s likely it will start with a pilot program in Seattle, and then expand the offering depending on its success.\nIt’s important to note that Amazon customers can already hire housekeepers through the company’s marketplace for home-service providers, however it seems like the new offering would be provided by Amazon itself rather than by a third-party through Amazon.\nAdd these apps to your shopping list and never go to the grocery store again Primed for growth? Amazon Prime has just launched in China Amazon’s Alexa can be your extra hands in the kitchen with ChefSteps’ Joule",

      "text": "November 8, 2016 \nAt first I thought it was a “Saturday Night Live” parody about ebooks for kids. \nWe’re so addicted to info-snacking, seemingly less able to (and interested in) focus on long-form reading, so let’s create a new platform that helps foster even shorter attention spans for our kids. \nAmazon Rapids , the company’s newest offering, is nothing more than a series of text messages disguised as a new way of encouraging kids to read. \nGo ahead. Download the app, read the sample content and tell me whether you think it’s worth $2.99 a month to expose kids to these “short stories.” \nI wouldn’t recommend Rapids to kids even if it were offered for free. \nAnyone who knows me would agree that I’m an unabashed digital enthusiast. Nobody wants technology to help make reading more accessible and interesting than I do. \nMore. \nThe DBW Daily is the go-to newsletter for staying up to date on the biggest issues facing the book publishing industry and indie authors .

Her experience as an outreach specialist for the New England Aquarium helped inform her picture books, while growing up near — and once staying the night in — a haunted, lakeside cottage gave her non-fiction a unique perspective. When she decided to try self-publishing, she wanted to “produce well-written books that readers would find entertaining and interesting.” \n10 Things Authors Do Wrong (and How to Fix Them) (The Verbs) I once had an author tell me that getting into publishing is sort of like building a house without any plans. There’s a lot of information out there, but some of it feels a bit too hyped (“Make your book an Amazon bestseller!”) while other information is flat out confusing. For this reason, I find that authors often just decide to jump into the deep end of the pool, with very little research or practice. And while that’s admirable, it often comes with a price. Also (and as you’ll see from this piece) while the challenges are real, the fixes are pretty simple. \nThe X Factor. Adding the X to PDF/X (BookMachine) We all know PDFs. Here we are over a decade and a half into the 21st century and chances are you have probably already read one or more this week and are probably carrying a few around in your pocket right now.

      "text": "Who will, like, do their laundry? Photo credit: Jonni , CC BY 2.0. We still have the rest of the whole day to get through, so… um… let’s pass the time by poking fun at major corporations!\nToday’s subject: Amazon. \nFrom the Seattle Times:\nAmazon looks to clean house - literally \nThey call [in a job posting] for potential recruits to join “Amazon Assistants,” which the company describes as “experts in helping Amazon customers keep up their home.” That means helping customers with “tidying up around the home, laundry, and helping put groceries and essentials like toilet paper and paper towels away.” The goal is to provide, as part of a two-person team, “timesaving assistance to Amazon Prime members,” so they can run an “errand-free” home. I know that Amazon is probably not planning to roll out this feature to all 54 million Prime members , but I live in Seattle and I have Amazon Prime. Am I eligible for an Amazon Assistant?\nCould I seriously get a person to come to my home, take the roll of quarters out of my bedroom, and haul my laundry down to the grody basement? Would I be able to give that person a complete list of all clothes that must never be dried , including clothes you wouldn’t expect, like my cheapo Old Navy white cotton layering tanks? (They shrink.) Would that person shove the padding back into my bralette and never say anything about how I should get a new one, because I just bought that bralette at the beginning of the summer and I don’t feel like I’ve gotten enough use out of it yet?\nThe point being that many Amazon Prime members live in modest circumstances, and the idea of having a personal assistant to wipe the lint off the top of my toilet tank (I don’t know what it is about cheap bathroom fixtures, but they collect so much more lint than the better-quality ones) and shove quarters into a dryer feels hilarious.\nConsumerist suggests that my Amazon Assistant might actually say something about the bralette, though—or at least tell me when I’m running out of products that are available for purchase on Amazon, which is to say nearly everything: \nIs Amazon Adding House Cleaning To Prime Membership Perks? \n[The job ad] suggests that if a Prime customer orders paper towels or other household products from, oh say, Amazon, then the assistant would come by when they’re delivered and put them away. Additionally, the ad notes that assistants would “advise customers on regular cleaning service visits and grocery replenishment offerings,” which suggests that the employees could also sell customers on products they might need — perhaps through Amazon’s Dash buttons or wands. Can it be like Kindle, though, so we have the option to get our Amazon Assistants “without special offers?” An errand-free home, if that’s what we’re calling it, means adding no new tasks —and considering whether I need to install an Amazon Dash button is a task, as is listening to my Amazon Assistant deliver whatever advertising advice message they’re required to say before they can move on to the next one-bedroom apartment.\nI’m trying to articulate why this feels different from a housecleaning service. Plenty of people in small apartments hire the occasional housecleaner, and that’s no big deal, so I don’t want to sound like I’m slagging on people who use cleaning services.\nIt’s more like… there are a lot of people who use Amazon Prime, millions and millions, and this fantasy of the “errand-free home” is neither applicable nor scalable to a potential majority of Amazon Prime users. (Will roommates get multiple assistants? What about people who live in rural areas? Will this service be automatically included with the Prime membership, or will it cost extra?)\nOr maybe I’m just a person who likes an extraordinarily high level of control over her environment and the thought of someone I don’t know coming into my home and touching things squigs me out.\nAnyway, discuss. We’ve got hours to kill before this election’s over, after all.\nIs Amazon Offering Prime Members Personal Assistants? was originally published in The Billfold on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.",

Amazon is hiring cleaning technicians  //usat.ly/2fAEL5F   Will Amazon clean up, on cleaning up? Edward C. Baig , USA TODAY 2:19 p.m. EST November 8, 2016 Amazon is hiring cleaning technicians and home assistants. (Photo: Edward C. Baig) \nNEW YORK—Amazon is looking to hire a “cleaning technician” and “home assistant,” raising the possibility that the e-commerce titan may be readying a new housekeeping offering for Amazon Prime members. \nIdeal candidates for such jobs will have a “passion for making a house feel like a home” and will be “comfortable working in homes of customers and lifting up to 25lbs,” among other qualifications. \nThe job post for the home assistant tells prospective candidates that, “You will be working with customers each day with tidying up around the home, laundry, and helping put groceries and essentials like toilet paper and paper towels away. You will assure that customers return to an errand-free home.” \nThe Seattle Times which first spotted the listings, suggested that this good housekeeping initiative might lead to some kind of new perk for Prime members, while also indicating that “the fact that it’s only a couple of job postings has ‘experiment’ written all over it.” \nAmazon declined USA TODAY 's request for comment. \nHome Assistant is one of the job postings at Amazon's site. (Photo: Edward C. Baig) \nPrime members currently pay $99 a year for free second day shipping on some of the products that they buy on Amazon, along with other benefits that include certain free Kindle e-books, and free streaming of select TV shows and movies. \nThe job listings, which date back to last month, also indicate that whatever service might come of this, would consist of two-cleaner teams that would “efficiently provide high-quality cleaning that surpasses each customer’s expectations.” In the description, Amazon said that it would provide all the cleaning supplies, and pay for a gas stipend to cover the cost to and from customer's homes. \nEmail: ebaig@usatoday.com; Follow USA TODAY Personal Tech Columnist @edbaig on Twitter CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE",

      "text": "By Linda Buchwald November 8, 2016 4:11pm The stars of “Good Girls Revolt,” a new series on Amazon inspired by Lynn Povich’s memoir. (Courtesy of Amazon Studios) \n( JTA ) — Men were writers and women were researchers. That’s the way it was when Lynn Povich and 45 of her colleagues at Newsweek decided to take a stand. \nPovich, who became Newsweek’s first female senior editor in 1975, wrote “ The Good Girls Revolt: How the Women of Newsweek Sued Their Bosses and Changed the Workplace. ” The memoir, published in 2012, offers a compelling account of the events and the trailblazers involved in the historic case. \nAnd in a historic year that has seen the first female presidential nominee, the book has inspired a TV series, “Good Girls Revolt,” which is streaming on Amazon. \nThe series, based on the book, is fictionalized — it takes place at the made-up magazine News of the Week, and most of the characters are invented, too. Still, the series captures the general gestalt of the time and place of the “revolt,” from the blatant gender bias to the fabulous fashions to the thrills of landing a scoop in the newsroom. \n“It’s a very personal story for me and my friends,” Povich told JTA. “I thought it would be difficult, given what the demands of TV and streaming are these days, to get it to be the way it really was versus what has to be done to make it an exciting, dramatic show.” \n“The fact is that we weren’t famous — that was the point,” she added. “We were just a group of young women at Newsweek. And I thought it would give the [show’s] writers more leeway to create some backstories.” \nJTA spoke to Povich about seeing her story on TV, the role Judaism plays in her life and more. \nJTA: Even though it’s a fictionalized version, how accurate do you think it is? \nPovich: I think it catches the spirit of the story. The actual storyline of the women organizing and ultimately filing the charges is correct. I think they caught the spirit of a newsroom, and being young and how exciting it was. The late ’60s and early ’70s were very exciting, and you have a sense of what the times were like. \nDo you identify with any of the characters? \nNo. They were very smart when they fictionalized the characters to take pieces of everybody and put them in. There are little pieces of me in all of these people. I think that most of us would, in this sense, identify with the sense of how thrilling it was to break a story or get a scoop. But the personal stories of all these women are completely different. “The Good Girls Revolt: How the Women of Newsweek Sued Their Bosses and Changed the Workplace” was published in 2012. (Courtesy of Lynn Povich) \nWhat is it like to watch your story played out on TV? \nIt’s interesting — it’s us but not us. So on the one hand, I’m very excited that our story is reaching a larger audience, and certainly a younger audience, 46 years later. \nWhat was your Jewish upbringing like? \nI was raised in Washington, D.C. We belonged to an Orthodox synagogue until I was about 10 and my parents were very observant. We had Shabbat every Friday night. We went to synagogue on all of the holidays and we had big family gatherings on all of the holidays. When I was about 10, my parents moved to B’nai Israel Congregation, a Conservative synagogue in Washington, D.C. I was one of the first women in that congregation to be bat mitzvahed in 1956, when women were bat mitzvahed on Friday nights, not Saturday, and you couldn’t read the Torah. \nI come from a very observant background of people who were genuine in their belief and their faith. I pretty much followed that path. I have continued to observe Shabbat in my house the whole time with my husband and our two kids, and I belong to a Conservative synagogue in New York. I would say that my sense of Judaism is traditional and familial and cultural that I both enjoy and am proud of. \nWas having a bat mitzvah something that came from you? Or was it something your parents wanted? \nI wanted it. I wanted anything my brothers had. They were bar mitzvahed, so I wanted to be bat mitzvahed. And, in fact, when they said to me they wanted me to read everything in English, I said, “My brothers read it in Hebrew, so I want to read it in Hebrew.” So I read it in Hebrew because I insisted. I was proud to be one of the first young women in our shul to step on the bimah, read Hebrew and become an adult in the eyes of my religion. \nLooking back, does your bat mitzvah seem significant now? \nI do think becoming a bat or bar mitzvah is incredibly important when you look back. We are part of a long history of our people and our survival. I believe strongly in preserving our religion, traditions and culture. I’m so glad I did it. It was meaningful to me then and now. \nSo even from a young age you were fighting for equal rights. What do you think brought that on? \nMy father [ Shirley Povich] was a sports columnist at the Washington Post for 75 years, but in those days, in the ’40s and ’50s, he was writing a lot about the lack of integration in major-league sports. He wrote about when Jackie Robinson came into the league [Major League Baseball] and how black players at spring training had to stay in segregated areas of town because the hotels wouldn’t put them up. He won a prize for a series that he did about segregation and Major League Baseball. My sense of civil rights and human rights came from this period when he was very involved with that. \nDo you think there is anything in being raised Jewish that influenced you? \nI do think this sense of it’s what you do, not what you say — that your deeds count and how are you making the world a better place. And I’m very involved in two nonprofit organizations which do that. One is the International Women’s Media Foundation that supports women journalists around the world. I’m also on the advisory board of the Women’s Rights Division of Human Rights Watch . Newsweek was a very radicalizing action for me. Organizing with other women and together realizing that you actually can make change set me on my path for the rest of my life. Lynn Povich (Courtesy of Povich) \nHow far do you think women have actually come? \nIn my profession of journalism, women are everywhere. We’re in war-torn areas; we’re covering the president, not the first lady; we’re on Wall Street. Women are doing very well in journalism, except at the top. Journalism isn’t unusual that way. Women are not at the top in corporations and many organizations. So I think the glass ceiling is now at the point of top management. We unfortunately are seeing things like pregnancy discrimination again, which we felt we had won that battle. The same with reproductive rights that continue to be eroded; we thought we had won that battle. So there’s still a lot to be done. \nIs there anything that you think women should be doing? \nI think there is a lot women can be doing — and women are doing a lot. I think, culturally, we’re in a feminist moment now. It started when a lot of the celebrities started embracing feminism because there was a period when a whole generation of young women didn’t want to be called feminist, so I’m encouraged by all of that. \nI think what’s different about this generation is that we mobilized in the streets and within our workplaces, and most of the young people I see are organizing online. I think that has a different effect than it does when you’re doing something in person and in a place like an office, where you know the people, the systems, barriers and things like that. \nI always encourage women wherever they are working to talk to other women and other men. I don’t think a lot of these issues are women’s issues. They get labeled women’s issues and I think that’s the problem. So I think young women and young men have a lot of common interests, and they would do well to start the conversation.",

      "text": "© 2016 Time Inc. All rights reserved. Amazon’s Alexa Will Tell You If Clinton or Trump Wins the Election \nDon’t feel like turning on CNN to watch election returns? Amazon’s voice assistant, Alexa, has been updated to provide real-time election updates, the e-commerce giant announced on Tuesday. \nAlexa is Amazon’s voice-controlled digital assistant, which can already answer simple questions like “Who is the 44th President of the United States?” as well as play music on-command and order household goods. The service is limited to select Amazon amzn devices, such as one of Amazon’s home automation devices (the Echo and Echo Dot) or Fire TV for streaming video. \nFor the past few months, Alexa has been able to inform users with the latest polling numbers for the two presidential candidates: Republican nominee Donald Trump and Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. Get Data Sheet , Fortune’s technology newsletter. \nAs of Election Day, Alexa will be able to answer questions about which states Trump and Clinton have won, respectively, how many electoral votes each candidate has, how much of the popular vote each candidate has, projections for state winners, and how many votes each candidate has in each state. Later on, Alexa will be able to provide final election results for the presidential race when ready to call. \nAlexa is powered by artificial intelligence, the machine learning technology that powers driverless cars and other intelligent machines that are slowly taking over human tasks. But in order to make Alexa more human-like, the technology needs human interaction to help program and teach it. \nAccording to a recent Seattle Times report, Amazon has had a team comprised of a half a dozen employees working to ensure Alexa was ready to answer up-to-date queries about the presidential election. But this wasn’t the first time Alexa has been “prepped” to answer specific questions about a major news event as the company did something similar during the Summer Olympics in August.",

      "text": "David O. Russell’s TV series starring Robert De Niro and Julianne Moore has landed at Amazon , sources tell Variety . The Weinstein Company is producing.\nThe high-profile package was put together this August and was shopped around to networks and production companies shortly after. Insiders tell Variety that FX and Amazon emerged as the front-runners, and in early October, Amazon had become the likely home for the series.\nDetails on the plot and storyline are scarce, though the project is believed to be serialized. While an episodic commitment has not been announced at this time, industry sources say De Niro’s paycheck is a hefty $850,000 per episode.\nO’Russell will write and direct all episodes. He will work alongside Scott Lambert, Alexandra Milchan and Megan Ellison, who are all on board as producers.\nThe project marks O’Russell’s big foray into TV, following award-winning films, including “Silver Linings Playbook,” “American Hustle,” and most recently “Joy.”\nDe Niro and Moore, both Academy Award winners, are the latest A-listers to flock to television. The trend started with Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson signing on for the first season of HBO’s “True Detective” and Halle Berry starring in “Extant” on CBS. Coming up on Showtime is “Purity,” starring James Bond’s Daniel Craig, and also “Maniac” at Netflix with Emma Stone and Jonah Hill.\nO’Russell, De Niro, and Moore are all repped by CAA.\nRelated stories\nBroadway Box Office: 'A Bronx Tale,' Kristin Chenoweth Bow Strong\nHollywood Film Awards: Robert De Niro, Natalie Portman Support Hillary Clinton on Eve of Election\nRobert De Niro Refuses to Take Photo With Arnold Schwarzenegger Over Election Politics\nGet more from Variety and Variety411 : Follow us on Twitter , Facebook , Newsletter",

      "text": "It looks like Amazon prime could soon offer more than online services and cheap shipping. The company has posted two listings for housekeepers to be hired by Amazon in Seattle to help with things like \"tidying up around the house.\" More It looks like Amazon is getting into delivering more than just products — the company may soon let you hire workers, too. The company just put up two listings in Seattle for housekeepers that would be part of the Amazon Assistants program.\nAccording to the listings, the housekeepers would be hired by Amazon to do things like tidy up around the house, do laundry, and help put away groceries. The listings first surfaced in a report from the Seattle Times .\nMore: Amazon Prime is being offered at an aggressive discount in India\nAccording to the report, Amazon could offer housekeeping simply as a part of its Amazon Prime subscription, with the goal apparently being for Amazon to play a role in developing an “errand-free” household.\nIt would be an interesting move for Amazon, to be sure, but it highlights just how creative the company is getting to convince potential subscribers to sign up to Amazon Prime. Traditionally the company has offered services like quicker shipping on items and access to music and video streaming services.\nRecently, however, Amazon has been developing original content for the service, such as the highly anticipated The Grand Tour , a show starring Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond, and James May, who rose to fame as the hosts of the previous iteration of the BBC’s Top Gear.\nAmazon Prime has been so successful that it has become one of the main focuses for the company, as demonstrated by the fact that it could soon start offering more interesting services like housekeeping. If it turns out that Amazon is indeed offering housekeeping as part of Prime, it’s likely it will start with a pilot program in Seattle, and then expand the offering depending on its success.\nIt’s important to note that Amazon customers can already hire housekeepers through the company’s marketplace for home-service providers, however it seems like the new offering would be provided by Amazon itself rather than by a third-party through Amazon.\nAdd these apps to your shopping list and never go to the grocery store again Primed for growth? Amazon Prime has just launched in China Amazon’s Alexa can be your extra hands in the kitchen with ChefSteps’ Joule",

      "text": "New Constructs Summary \nGoing up against the likes of Amazon, with its impressive scale and pricing power, has proven difficult for bricks-and-mortar as well as other online retail firms. \nOverstock’s after-tax profit (NOPAT) has declined from $18 million in 2013 to $2 million in 2015, and even further, to -$6 million over the last twelve months. \nWith negative profitability, rising costs, and an overvalued stock price, could OSTK be the next victim of the retail market? Online retail is widely regarded as the biggest threat to brick-and-mortar stores. What about the threat that online retail is to other online retail? Going up against the likes of Amazon, with its impressive scale and pricing power, has proven difficult for bricks-and-mortar as well as other online retail firms. With negative profitability, rising costs, and an overvalued stock price, Overstock (NASDAQ: OSTK ) is in the Danger Zone this week. Could OSTK be the next victim of the retail market? Overstock's Profits Are On the Decline Overstock's after-tax profit ( NOPAT ) has declined from $18 million in 2013 to $2 million in 2015, and even further, to -$6 million over the last twelve months (TTM). The company's NOPAT margin has fallen from 1.4% in 2013 to -0.4% TTM, per Figure 1. The deterioration in Overstock's profitability comes despite revenue growing 13% compounded annually from 2013-2015. Figure 1: Overstock's Growing Losses Click to enlarge Sources: New Constructs, LLC and company filings Overstock's return on invested capital ( ROIC ) has fallen from a once impressive 58% in 2013 to a bottom-quintile -4% TTM. It's clear that Overstock's business is showing significant signs of deterioration across multiple key metrics. Compensation Plan Misaligns Executive Interests Overstock's executive compensation plan is weighted heavily towards equity incentive awards with a smaller focus on annual cash bonuses. The criteria for earning equity awards appear largely subjective, as Overstock's proxy statement states that \"the number of awards are determined by the compensation committee on the basis of management's recommendation and the comp committee's subjective views of the relative ability of key employees to make positive contributions to the company.\" Annual cash bonuses are paid out through a company-wide bonus pool, of which the pool's total value is determined as a percentage of a \"measurement amount.\" In 2015, this \"measurement amount\" was adjusted net income, which removed stock-based compensation, development project expenses, and general & administrative expenses, among others from net income. No bonuses are paid out unless the \"measurement amount\" exceeds a target level. With significant leeway in the calculation of this \"measurement amount,\" one must question whether executive interests are correctly aligned with that of shareholder interests. In either case, executives are incentivized by metrics that do little to create shareholder value and investors should be wary of heavy use of stock price as an incentive . We would much rather see executive compensation tied to ROIC, as there is a clear correlation between ROIC and shareholder value . Currently, OSTK's executive compensation plan has done little to create shareholder value, as its economic earnings , the true cash flows of the business, have declined from $16 million in 2013 to -$16 million TTM. Non-GAAP Metric Ignores Economic Reality Overstock doesn't represent the most egregious abuse of non-GAAP metrics we've come across in our Danger Zone picks, but its use of \"contribution\" still distracts from the economic realities of the business. Overstock's \"contribution\" is calculated from gross profit and removes the effect of sales and marketing expense and Club O Rewards & gift card breakage. The issue with \"contribution\" is management claims it provides additional insight into the firm's operations while it actually diverges significantly from economic earnings. See the dangers of non-GAAP metrics for more details on how companies can abuse non-GAAP. Per Figure 2, Overstock's \"contribution\" has increased from $172 million in 2014 to $187 million over the last twelve months. Meanwhile, economic earnings have declined from $7 million to -$17 million over the same time. Investors following \"contribution\" would believe Overstock's business to be in much better condition than those calculating the true cash flows of the business. Figure 2: Discrepancy Between Non-GAAP & Economic Earnings Click to enlarge Sources: New Constructs, LLC and company filings Negative Profitability In The Cutthroat Retail Industry Overstock's business, an online retailer of home goods, jewelry, apparel, electronics, and more, places it in one of the most competitive industries in the world. Retailers across the globe compete with one another in terms of product offering, pricing, availability, delivery time, and even ease of use. At the same time, Overstock is not only competing against Internet retailers such as Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ), Etsy (NASDAQ: ETSY ), Wayfair (NYSE: W ), eBay (NASDAQ: EBAY ), or Alibaba (NYSE: BABA ), but also thousands of brick-and-mortar stores operating across the country such as Bed Bath & Beyond (NASDAQ: BBBY ), Wal-Mart (NYSE: WMT ), and Williams-Sonoma (NYSE: WSM ). Originally, Amazon's practice of cutting prices to grow market share was believed to be one of the most significant threats to traditional retailers. However, online retailers are just as susceptible to this competition, Overstock included. Per Figure 3, Overstock earns an ROIC and NOPAT margin well below its main Internet and traditional retail competition. In fact, the only company with lower profitability is Wayfair, a previous Danger Zone pick . With negative profitability, Overstock's ability to compete on price is diminished, and with increased discounting across the sector, the costs to acquire customers are increased, an issue we'll touch on later. Figure 3: Overstock's Profitability Lags Nearly All Competition Click to enlarge Sources: New Constructs, LLC and company filings Bull Hopes Ignore Deteriorating Economics In online retail, the bull case generally centers on a firm's ability to attract traditionally brick-and-mortar shoppers to its online offering. Retailers can take many approaches to reach this goal, including under pricing the competition, providing a niche offering unavailable elsewhere, or even customer loyalty programs. The problem with many of these approaches is that they can be costly to a retailer's margins, as noted above, and greatly undermine the firm's ability to market to new customers while maintaining profitability. We see this scenario playing out at Overstock, as the firm has increased coupons, sales, and customer rewards programs in an attempt to grow the business. However, the cost per unique customer is continually rising, making each customer worth less to the firm. Per Figure 4, Overstock's cost per customer has grown from $12.52 in 2Q13 to $18.36 in 2Q16. Figure 4: Cost Per Customer Threatens Future Profitability Click to enlarge Sources: New Constructs, LLC and company filings At the same time, the company's cost of goods sold and sales & marketing expenses are growing equal to or faster than the revenue generated by new and existing customers. Since 2011, revenue has grown 9% compounded annually, the same as cost of goods sold. Sales & marketing expenses have grown 15% compounded annually over the same time frame. Meanwhile, the executive team at Overstock is expanding its interest in side businesses such as blockchain software and bitcoin currency, with claims that it can revolutionize the market and business as a whole. We feel these non-core operations are more of a smokescreen to distract from the growing issues at the business, namely the consistently growing cost to acquire a new customer. Without significant cost controls, the business will be unable to meet the expectations embedded in its stock price. The largest risk to the bear case is what we call \" stupid money risk \", which is higher in today's low (organic) growth environment. Another firm could step in and acquire OSTK at a value that is much higher than the current market price. However, we only see an acquisition situation possible if an acquiring firm is willing to destroy shareholder value. Is OSTK Worth Acquiring? The biggest risk to any bear thesis is that an outside firm acquires OSTK at a value at or above today's price. If the negative profitability, weak competitive position, and costly customer acquisition noted above are not enough, we'll show below that OSTK is not an attractive acquisition target unless a buyer is willing to destroy shareholder value. To begin, OSTK has liabilities of which investors may not be aware that make it more expensive than the accounting numbers suggest. $45 million in off-balance-sheet operating leases (12% of market cap) After adjusting for this liability we can model multiple purchase price scenarios. Even in the most optimistic of scenarios, OSTK is worth no more than the current share price. Figures 5 and 6 show what we think Wal-Mart should pay for Overstocks to ensure it does not destroy shareholder value. Wal-Mart has a long history of acquiring online retailers in an effort to spur its e-commerce growth, and Overstock could present another target. However, Wal-Mart's success in these acquisitions is checkered at best, and WMT must not overpay for OSTK or the company will risk investor backlash. Furthermore, there are limits on how much WMT would pay for OSTK to earn a proper return, given the NOPAT of free cash flows being acquired. Each implied price is based on a 'goal ROIC' assuming different levels of revenue growth. In each scenario, the estimated revenue growth rate in year one and two equals the consensus estimate for 2016 (6%) and 2017 (7%). For the subsequent years, we use 7% in scenario one because it represents a continuation of 2017 expectations. We use 10% in scenario two because it assumes a merger with Wal-Mart could create revenue growth through increased advertising efforts and exposure to Wal-Mart's large customer base. We conservatively assume that Wal-Mart can grow OSTK's revenue and NOPAT without spending on working capital or fixed assets. We also assume OSTK achieves a 0.6% NOPAT margin, the average of the past five years. For reference, Overstock's TTM NOPAT margin is -0.4%, so this assumption implies immediate improvement and allows the creation of a truly best case scenario. Figure 5: Implied Acquisition Prices For WMT To Achieve 5% ROIC Click to enlarge Sources: New Constructs, LLC and company filings. Figure 5 shows the 'goal ROIC' for WMT as its weighted average cost of capital ( WACC ) or 5%. Even if Overstock can grow revenue by 9% compounded annually with nearly a 1% NOPAT margin for the next five years, the firm is not worth more than its current price of $15/share. It's worth noting that any deal that only achieves a 5% ROIC would be only value neutral and not accretive, as the return on the deal would equal WMT's WACC. Figure 6: Implied Acquisition Prices For WMT To Achieve 10% ROIC Click to enlarge Sources: New Constructs, LLC and company filings. Figure 6 shows the next 'goal ROIC' of 10%, which is WMT's current ROIC. Acquisitions completed at these prices would be truly accretive to WMT shareholders. Even in the best-case growth scenario, the most WMT should pay for OSTK is $4.36/share (70% downside). Even assuming this best-case scenario, WMT would destroy $302 million by purchasing OSTK at its current valuation. Any scenario assuming less than 9% CAGR in revenue would result in further capital destruction for WMT. Standalone Valuation - Priced for Perfection Despite a rollercoaster ride over the past few years, OSTK is up nearly 20% year-to-date. This significant price increase coupled with the continued deterioration of business fundamentals leaves OSTK significantly overvalued. To justify the current price of $15/share, OSTK must immediately achieve 1.4% pretax margins (highest ever achieved in 2013, compared to -0.6% TTM) and grow NOPAT by 30% compounded annually for the next 12 years. This scenario assumes Overstock can grow revenue by 9% compounded annually, but with the large increase in margins, NOPAT growth significantly outpaces revenue on a compounded annual basis. In this scenario, Overstock would be generating nearly $4.9 billion in revenue (12 years from now), which is greater than Wayfair and Pier 1 Imports last fiscal year revenue combined, and nearly equal to home goods retailer Williams-Sonoma's 2016 revenue. Even if we assume OSTK can immediately achieve slightly lower 1% pretax margin and grow NOPAT by 27% compounded annually for the next decade , the stock is only worth $7/share today - a 53% downside. This scenario assumes Overstocks can grow revenue by 7% compounded annually (2017 consensus estimate) but with the increase in margins, NOPAT growth significantly outpaces revenue on a compounded annual basis. Each of these scenarios also assumes the company is able to grow revenue and NOPAT/free cash flow without spending on working capital or fixed assets. This assumption is unlikely but allows us to create a very optimistic scenario. For reference, Overstock's invested capital has grown on average $2 million (<1% of 2015 revenue) per year over the last five years. Market Tires of Overstock's Lack of Focus We've seen Overstock's price move upwards of 20% on numerous occasions over the past few years, often in relation to earnings surprises. However, one of the key sticking points recently is Overstock's lack of focus on its core retail operations. Instead, executives are more interested in non-core operations such as crypto currency (i.e. bitcoin) or blockchain software. These ventures not only cost money, but also take time away from fixing the issues within the retail business. Most recently, OSTK jumped 26% in February when Overstock's CEO noted the blockchain software could be spun off into its own entity. Clearly investors are excited at the prospects of Overstock focusing solely on its struggling retail operations. However, with this announcement, Overstock is left in a tough situation. If the software gets spun off, the economics of Overstock's retail operations do not leave the firm in a position that warrants investment. With fast growing customer acquisition cost, sales & marketing costs, and cost of goods sold, the viability of the business in the retail sector remains in question. If there is no spin off, the focus between managing an online retail firm in a competitive market gets split between the non-core operations, and losses could continue to grow larger. At the end of the day, without a significant increase in margins, along with impressive revenue growth, Overstock simply cannot meet the expectations baked into its stock price. An earnings miss, particularly in regards to margins, could be all that is needed to send shares to a more rational level as investors wake up to the poor economics of this business. Insider Action and Short Interest Are Low Over the past 12 months, 85 thousand insider shares have been purchased and 109 thousand have been sold for a net effect of 24 thousand insider shares sold. These sales represent less than 1% of shares outstanding. Additionally, there are 934 thousand shares sold short, or just under 4% of shares outstanding. Impact of Footnotes Adjustments and Forensic Accounting In order to derive the true recurring cash flows, an accurate invested capital, and a real shareholder value, we made the following adjustments to OSTK's 2015 10-K: Income Statement: we made $13 million of adjustments with a net effect of removing $1 million in non-operating income (<1% of revenue). We remove $7 million related to non-operating income and $6 million related to non-operating expenses. See all the adjustments made to OSTK's income statement here . Balance Sheet: we made $261 million of adjustments to calculate invested capital with a net decrease of $127 million. The most notable adjustment was $64 million (38% of net assets) related to deferred tax assets. See all adjustments to OSTK's balance sheet here. Valuation: we made $138 million of adjustments with a net effect of decreasing shareholder value by $40 million. The most notable adjustment was $45 million related to off-balance-sheet operating leases. This adjustment represents 12% of OSTK's market cap.

      "title": "AMZN Stock: Amazon.com, Inc. Set To Take Significant Market Share From Alibaba (BABA)",
      "text": "Amazon set to gain traction from China's growing middle class. Key investments ready to make big returns. Strong performance in India within a short period. Flickr Amazon's (NSDQ:AMZN) foray into China isn’t yet a significant threat to Alibaba's (NYSE:BABA) core commerce business; however, performance in India and global momentum indicates that Amazon is set to grab significant market share in the Chinese market. Notably, Amazon is getting into a Chinese B2C market with 70% of the market shared between just two companies: Alibaba and JD.com (NSDQ:JD) . Moreover, Alibaba has a deep understanding of the Chinese market. For instance, during 2015’s “Singles Day”, China’s version of Black Friday , the Chinese commerce giant was able to generate $14 billion in revenue . This is not to say that Alibaba’s dominance is impenetrable. When we consider the fact that China’s middle class is growing at a stratospheric rate, and consumers are willing to spend, Amazon doesn’t have to go toe-to-toe with Alibaba in order to see significant results. Amazon gave the market a sense of their aggressive foray by offering Chinese consumers a year of Prime for $28. This might come across as desperate but is based on a lesson learnt. U.S based Prime members spend double per year on average as compared to non-Prime members. Therefore, Amazon is keen to use Prime as leverage to gain significant traction in the highly competitive Chinese market. In an early indication of their strategy, Amazon took the decision to give Chinese Prime members free overseas shopping . Chinese consumers are keen to purchase products from countries such as the U.K and U.S.A. In fact, the middle class goes to the length of going on trips in order to buy western goods. This creates a sort of “funnel” to bring highly sought after products into China. In this way, Amazon is able to create a niche for themselves in China and grow off the back of this momentum. There is more evidence that Amazon is looking to gain a firm footing in China. For instance, the development of Amazon Prime Air and the upcoming launch of their shipping fleet would allow the company to make huge cost savings and gain full control of logistics. This would allow Amazon to become a truly global company and enable investors to reap the benefits. A longstanding criticism of Jeff Bezos and his team is their constant reinvestment of profits, and lack of dividends. However, the strong year-on-year growth for Amazon over the past five years shows that this was a smart strategy. Impressively, AWS grew by 55% between Q3 2015 and Q3 2016. Interestingly, growth opportunities in the current commerce market lie in the software based execution. For instance, machine learning, predictive analysis and automation (chat bots) are making a game-changing difference. This has the potential to provide Amazon with a long term growth in Alibaba dominated areas. (Also Read : Why The VMware Deal Is Great For AWS And AMZN Stock ) In a move that would have been unthinkable 10 years prior, Amazon overtook Walmart to become the largest U.S retailer (by market cap). This was only possible due to a risk on strategy and a strong appetite for innovation. We only need to look at Amazon’s performance in India to get an indication of what they could do in Asia. After landing in India just 3 years ago, the company recently emerged as India’s most attractive brand . Moreover, India is Amazon’s fastest growing market. When one considers the socio-economic and logistical challenges present in India, this is quite impressive. On the other hand, Amazon’s Q3 earnings report left some investors worried; however, analysis of trends in global markets and you will see that Amazon is well positioned. For instance, Amazon’s timing of investment into India and China is impeccable. The two countries are growing fast and are likely to become formidable superpowers in the near future. Moreover, the internet access is improving rapidly in these areas. Amazon’s Prime Air drones combined with the increasing use of digital currencies in emerging markets such as Africa could also add significant revenue in the future. This is due to the fact that roads in many countries in Africa are subpar, and Amazon Prime Air drones allow for the circumvention of the logistical challenges.

This is based on strong historical performance, stable management and calculated, profitable risks. Show Full Article",

So many different answers.\nSince they asked, I'm guessing they don't have a smart TV, one with a built-in Netflix app. So we are talking about adding a streaming box to their current TV.\nFor this, you should have an open HDMI port on the TV. Almost all the choices we'll talk about here need to connect to your TV via HDMI.\nNow we need to ask a few questions that might lead us to a specific box.\nDo you have any brand allegiances? For instance, do you have Macs (or iPads or iPhones) at home that would make you predisposed to picking Apple TV ($149.99)?\nAre you a subscriber to Amazon's Prime service? Amazon has a video streaming service that's included in the Prime subscription. The easiest and cheapest way to take advantage of Prime video is through an Amazon Fire TV Stick ($39.99).\nRoku also makes a full line of streaming devices that can be added to any TV. The easiest and most inexpensive is its Streaming Stick, which is on sale for $39.99 at Roku.com. The Roku has the most video sources, both free and paid, including Netflix.\nApple TV is nice. It has a bunch of apps to stream different video services, and it has games, but at such a price premium, I can't recommend it for people who want simple streaming.\nI should also mention Google's Chromecast ($35), which is a streaming dongle you attach to your TV's HDMI port. It enables you to \"cast\" video playing from your phone or tablet or computer to your TV screen.\nThis means that the device you already have (Windows, Mac, iOS, Android, Chromebook) is the source and Chromecast is the receiver.\nCasting a show or movie isn't difficult, but it's not the easiest choice. So if all you want is Netflix, the cheapest and simplest way is either Amazon's or Roku's streaming sticks.\nOf those two, I'd say Roku has a bit cleaner interface.",

      "text": "Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos. As Donald Trump began his march to the White House last year, he became embroiled in numerous feuds. One that got a lot of attention starting last year was a spat with fellow billionaire and Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos over taxes, media coverage in the Bezos-owned Washington Post and antitrust issues.\nPresident-Elect Donald Trump addresses a victory rally at the New York Hilton Midtown, with Vice President-Elect Mike Pence at his side. (Credit: Right Side Broadcasting) Following Trump’s victory, Amazon’s stock opened down about 3 percent , not a major drop, and probably a lot less than expected after U.S. markets freaked out as the tide shifted from Hillary Clinton to Trump. But Amazon did see a slightly sharper decline than some of its big tech contemporaries, such as Microsoft , Apple and Google parent Alphabet .\nWhen it became clear that Donald Trump was on the way to becoming the next U.S. president, Dow futures plummeted as the votes rolled in. But U.S. markets recovered this morning, possibly due to Trump’s victory speech , which featured a more conciliatory tone than his divisive and angry rhetoric as a candidate.\nTo be sure, Amazon’s stock movement could have nothing to do with Trump. Amazon’s stock has shown to be volatile with multiple peaks and valleys through the years. But some outlets speculate that a Trump presidency could be bad news for Amazon and Bezos.\nTrump’s first dustup with Bezos came late last year. Bezos bought the Washington Post in 2013 for $250 million . Trump has claimed he used the paper to influence politicians in Washington D.C. and keep them from taxing Amazon.\nThe @washingtonpost , which loses a fortune, is owned by @JeffBezos for purposes of keeping taxes down at his no profit company, @amazon .\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 7, 2015 \nThe @washingtonpost loses money (a deduction) and gives owner @JeffBezos power to screw public on low taxation of @Amazon ! Big tax shelter\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 7, 2015 \nIf @amazon ever had to pay fair taxes, its stock would crash and it would crumble like a paper bag. The @washingtonpost scam is saving it!\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 7, 2015 \nTrump has alluded to the possibility that Amazon could face antitrust issues under his presidency. From an appearance on Sean Hannity’s show on Fox News in May:\nI will tell you, this is owned as a toy by Jeff Bezos, who controls Amazon. Amazon is getting away with murder tax-wise. He’s using the Washington Post for power so that the politicians in Washington don’t tax Amazon like they should be taxed. … He’s worried about me — I think he said that to somebody, it was in some article — where he thinks I would go after him for antitrust, because he’s got a huge antitrust problem, because he’s controlling so much. Amazon is controlling so much of what they’re doing.\nHe bought this paper for practically nothing, and he’s using that as a tool for political power, against me and against other people, and I’ll tell you what, we can’t let him get away with it.\nAccording to Amazon’s annual report released in April, it paid approximately $273 million in cash in income taxes in 2015, up from $177 million in 2014 and $169 million in 2013.\nAmazon did not respond to a request for comment, and Bezos has been silent on Twitter.\nBezos tends to downplay Trump’s attacks. After Trump’s December volley, for example, Bezos joked on Twitter that he would “reserve him a seat on the Blue Origin rocket,” another venture that the Amazon founder is pursuing with his private fortune. In May, Bezos said Trump’s remarks were “not an appropriate way for a presidential candidate to behave.” \nBezos is not the first tech luminary to speak out against Trump. In July, dozens of tech leaders signed a letter saying that a Trump presidency would be a “disaster for innovation.” \nInvestors have been very bullish on Amazon recently, with some analysts projecting that its stock could exceed $1,000 a share soon. Amazon strung together multiple strong quarters this year, before missing Wall Street expectations in the third quarter. It remains unclear what effect, if any, a Trump presidency will have on Amazon’s stock in the long term.",

      "text": "How will Amazon fare in a Trump world?  20 am Jeff Bezos built an empire that prospers, in part, because of globalization and the free trade that President-elect Donald Trump has railed against. Trump also once said Amazon had a “huge anti-trust problem.” Share story Ángel González Seattle Times business reporter \nPresident-elect Donald Trump seems to have no love for Amazon.com’s CEO Jeff Bezos, who also owns the Washington Post, a newspaper that aggressively investigated the candidate during a no-holds barred campaign. \nHe also once said that Amazon, which dominates e-commerce, has a “huge antitrust problem,” given that the company “is controlling so much of what they’re doing. \nSo what are the prospects for America’s fifth largest company by market value under an administration led by the Republican firebrand? \nBezos built an empire based, in part, on Internet sales of goodies that stem from the overseas factories that Trump has said have stolen American jobs. Most Read Stories Unlimited Digital Access: $1 for 8 weeks. \nFree trade fills the company’s sails — as it builds a planetary network of warehouses, transportation and profitable data centers that are turning it into a truly global store. At the end of 2015, more than a third of Amazon’s physical footprint was in countries other than the U.S., and about 32 percent of its retail sales were made overseas. Trump has also rallied against the trade deals that facilitate some of that commerce, saying they’re not advantageous enough to the U.S. \nInvestors seemed to sniff some danger: shares are down 2.77 percent at $765.92, even as the wider stock market shrugged off initial fears stemming from a Trump presidency. \nAmazon didn’t respond to a request for comment. But a look at the boilerplate language in its annual report warns investors about the potential negative impact of trade protection measures, export duties and such, including “laws and policies of the U.S. and other jurisdictions affecting trade, foreign investment, loans, and taxes.” \nA hostile environment in its U.S. home base would add to some of the policy issues it has run into overseas, including anti-trust and tax investigations in Europe.

      "text": "President-elect Donald Trump seems to have no love for Amazon.com’s CEO Jeff Bezos, who also owns the Washington Post, a newspaper that aggressively investigated the candidate during a no-holds barred campaign. \nHe also once said that Amazon, which dominates e-commerce, has a “huge antitrust problem,” given that the company “is controlling so much of what they’re doing.\nSo what are the prospects for America’s fifth largest company by market value under an administration led by the Republican firebrand?\nBezos built an empire based, in part, on Internet sales of goodies that stem from the overseas factories that Trump has said have stolen American jobs. \nMost Read Stories Sororities, frats at WSU face event ban How Election Day 2016 unfolded: Trump wins, Washington passes new initiatives  WATCH Wife of Bills' kicker suggests castration for Richard Sherman, who responds by saying 'have a great day' Voters approve minimum wage increase to $13.50 in Washington state Oregon hunter impaled by antler of elk he just killed Unlimited Digital Access: $1 for 8 weeks. Free trade fills the company’s sails — as it builds a planetary network of warehouses, transportation and profitable data centers that are turning it into a truly global store. At the end of 2015, more than a third of Amazon’s physical footprint was in countries other than the U.S., and about 32 percent of its retail sales were made overseas. Trump has also railed against the trade deals that facilitate some of that commerce, saying they’re not advantageous enough to the U.S. \nInvestors seemed to sniff some danger: shares are down 2.77 percent at $765.92, even as the wider stock market shrugged off initial fears stemming from a Trump presidency.\nAmazon didn’t respond to a request for comment. But a look at the boilerplate language in its annual report warns investors about the potential negative impact of trade protection measures, export duties and such, including “laws and policies of the U.S. and other jurisdictions affecting trade, foreign investment, loans, and taxes.”\nA hostile environment in its U.S. home base would add to some of the policy issues it has run into overseas, including anti-trust and tax investigations in Europe. \nÁngel González: 206-464-2250 or agonzalez@seattletimes.com .

      "title": "How Trump presidency will affect Amazon",
      "text": "Donald Trump. AP\nIt's fair to say Donald Trump and Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos aren't on the best terms.\nTrump has often attacked Bezos for using his Washington Post ownership to keep taxes low on Amazon and free of antitrust allegations, famously saying, \" if I become president, oh, do they have problems.\"\nBezos, meanwhile, called out Trump for his accusations of mainstream media bias, saying he's \"eroding our democracy,\" and suggesting Trump take a trip to space instead.\nNow that Trump will become the next US president, Bezos and the companies he own — Amazon and The Washington Post specifically — may have to brace themselves. These are the areas that could face increased scrutiny under Trump's presidency:\nTaxes Trump seems to believe Bezos's ownership in The Washington Post (a company owned by Bezos himself, not Amazon) is somehow helping Amazon keep its taxes low.\nHe once called Amazon a \"big tax shelter\" and suggested Bezos is using The Post's unprofitable business as a means for tax deduction on Amazon. He also said Amazon is getting away with \"murder\" because Bezos is using Washington Post's influence to keep politicians away from taxing the company properly.\nIt's unclear what actions Trump will take to prove his case, but it's not hard to see him threatening to put more pressure on Bezos and Amazon by asking the IRS to increase its scrutiny.\n\"[Bezos] bought this paper for practically nothing, and he’s using that as a tool for political power, against me and against other people, and I’ll tell you what, we can’t let him get away with it,\" Trump said in an interview with Fox News in May.\nAmazon paid $273 million in income taxes in 2015. The company has historically had very little profit and only about $14 billion in cash, a small amount compared to other companies of its size.\nOn the other hand, if anything, Trump's proposed tax policy could help Amazon. Trump plans to lower the business tax rate from 35% to 15%, and cut the tax rate on income held overseas to 10% from the current 35%.\nThe @washingtonpost loses money (a deduction) and gives owner @JeffBezos power to screw public on low taxation of @Amazon ! Big tax shelter\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 7, 2015 Antitrust Trump once claimed Bezos has a \"huge antitrust problem.\"\n\"What he’s got is a monopoly, and he wants to make sure I don’t get in,\" Trump said.\nIt's true that Amazon controls a big chunk of the online retail and cloud computing market, but making a case for antitrust could prove difficult for Trump.\nAntitrust laws clearly state that the main goal is to protect consumers from unfair price hikes due to the lack of competition. But Amazon is all about offering every day low prices and putting customers first in its business. Amazon also owns just 15% share of total US retail and 20% share in e-commerce — hardly anywhere near a monopoly.\nThere's a chance Amazon could potentially raise prices in the future, but its history suggests that's unlikely. Amazon continuously offers discounts and big sales days, while its cloud service AWS is the driving force behind an industry-wide price war, even after offering 52 price cuts so far .\nChip Somodevilla/Getty\nThe Washington Post Perhaps Trump's biggest concern seems to be Bezos's ownership of The Washington Post. He believes Bezos exerted influence over the paper's editorial voice in order to reduce Trump's chances of winning the presidency . In the run-up to the election, The Post did break a number of stories that tainted Trump's image .\nBezos has repeatedly disputed this claim and made it clear that he is not involved in the editorial process. He's also criticized Trump for not welcoming more media scrutiny .\n“An appropriate thing for a presidential candidate to do is say, ‘I am running for the highest office in the world, please scrutinize me.' That’s not what we’ve seen. To try and chill the media and threaten retribution and retaliation, which is what he’s done in a number of cases, it just isn’t appropriate,\" Bezos said.\nWe don't know what Trump will do to The Washington Post, but the paper has a long history as a political watch dog, so this is an area to watch.\nInvestors Amazon's stock is down 2.6% as of Wednesday afternoon, but most investors believe Amazon won't be much affected by Trump, largely because it's still growing fast with a lot of long-term growth potential in front of it.\nScreenshot / CNBC\n\"The drivers of Amazon’s business are broad — secular growth trends in online retail, cloud computing, and media distribution — that it wouldn’t seem to me to be at risk unless the government specifically began to regulate those industries with impediments to growth, which seems unlikely,\" Baird Equity Research analyst Colin Sebastian told Business Insider. Mizuho's analyst Neil Doshi also noted he remains bullish on Amazon because its market share is \"far from displaying monopolistic characteristics\" and growth remains strong.\n\"We remain buyers of Amazon's stock given its growing market share of retail dollars shifting online, strong flywheels around its core business, and continued strength and profitability coming from its AWS cloud segment,\" Doshi wrote.\nAmazon's representative wasn't immediately available for comment on this article.\nDisclosure: Jeff Bezos is an investor in Business Insider through his personal investment company Bezos Expeditions.\nSEE ALSO: Here's how much the highest-paid actors make from the shows by Netflix, HBO, Amazon, and Hulu NOW WATCH: This hidden iPhone feature will boost your reception Loading video...

A dyed-in-the-wool introvert, he’s the star of Amazon Prime’s “Red Oaks,” playing a college-age tennis pro at an exclusive New Jersey country club. Not only is he not college age (he’s 25), he’s not athletic and never was, and what’s more, he’s not even American. \nRoberts is Welsh. How he pulls off a role like that is anybody’s guess — especially his. “One thing that I love about it (acting), I think for me it’s the involvement in the industry, full stop,” he says. \n“The fact that I’m allowed to be part of something that’s making people laugh or making people cry or whatever, or relaying information to people, I think it’s the involvement as much as anything. I’m certainly not one of these actors that needs to completely transform themselves and escape my own reality in any kind of way. I’m just very grateful to be working,” he says. \nRoberts was 18 when he was cast in an independent movie called “Submarine,” and that started things rolling. His parents didn’t object when he said he wanted to be an actor.   \n“My parents were happy I was just getting out of my bedroom,” he says. “I was a recluse. I played my computer games a lot; I didn’t really leave my bedroom. So for them, I think they were just happy I was interacting with other human beings, to be honest.” \nReacting with others is still a challenge for Roberts, who’s been shy since he was a kid. Crowds exhaust him. “I don’t like to talk sometimes. I’m definitely not somebody who can talk for the sake of talking. I think I was like that as a kid, I would kind of observe.” \nThe only connection his family had with show biz was Roberts’ grandfather, who entertained as a ventriloquist. “He used to dress up like Al Jolson, mimed him. He worked with a dummy, and left it to me.” \nAlthough he’s been acting for 16 years, Roberts has entered the fields of writing and directing, feats he can attempt without being the center of attention. “A couple of years ago, I started writing and directing because I wanted to do more things and challenge myself more,” says Roberts. \n“Some of the things related to acting I’m not very great with, like promoting oneself. Like this interaction feels very rude of me,” he says, pointing to the interviewer. \n“I feel like I should be asking you questions. I feel very rude. For me that’s very uncomfortable, and it’s like the elephant in the room. \n“But as a writer-director, hopefully I can be behind the scenes … It’s great. It’s very cool. It’s good to have so much pressure and you to be the blame for everything. That’s really cool.” \nThe second season of “Red Oaks” begins streaming Friday, Nov. 11. Luaine Lee  ",

      "text": "SEATTLE -- President-elect Donald Trump seems to have no love for Amazon.com's CEO Jeff Bezos, who also owns the Washington Post, a newspaper that aggressively investigated the candidate during a no-holds barred campaign.\nHe also once said that Amazon, which dominates e-commerce, has a \"huge antitrust problem,\" given that the company \"is controlling so much of what they're doing.\nSo what are the prospects for America's fifth largest company by market value under an administration led by the Republican firebrand?\nBezos built an empire based, in part, on Internet sales of goodies that stem from the overseas factories that Trump has said have stolen American jobs.\nFree trade fills the company's sails -- as it builds a planetary network of warehouses, transportation and profitable data centers that are turning it into a truly global store. At the end of 2015, more than a third of Amazon's physical footprint was in countries other than the U.S., and about 32 percent of its retail sales were made overseas. Trump has also railed against the trade deals that facilitate some of that commerce, saying they're not advantageous enough to the U.S.\nInvestors seemed to sniff some danger: Shares were down 2.77 percent at $765.92, even as the wider stock market shrugged off initial fears about a Trump presidency.\nAmazon didn't respond to a request for comment. But a look at the boilerplate language in its annual report warns investors about the potential negative impact of trade protection measures, export duties and such, including \"laws and policies of the U.S. and other jurisdictions affecting trade, foreign investment, loans, and taxes.\"\nA hostile environment in its U.S. home base would add to some of the policy issues it has run into overseas, including anti-trust and tax investigations in Europe.\nAs the dust settles, other retailers are also looking into how a change in free-trade stance by the U.S. administration may affect them.\nJ. Craig Shearman, a spokesman for the National Retail Federation, a trade group for big retailers, showed concern in a blog post Wednesday about Trump's opposition to the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a free trade agreement that would cut tariffs, as well as the president-elect's threats to \"tear up\" the North American Free Trade Agreement and impose \"huge\" tariffs on Chinese imports. \"NRF strongly opposes new tariffs and supports TPP and other free trade agreements because retailers rely heavily on imported merchandise,\" he wrote.\n(c)2016 The Seattle Times\nVisit The Seattle Times at www.seattletimes.com\n ",

      "text": "0 \n2pm Pacific, to be exact \nThe NES Classic is one of the more sought-after holiday items this year, and it has been relatively difficult to secure days before its launch. A few retailers held brief pre-order periods, but anyone who didn't get in on those is left hoping there will be ample supply on Friday, November 11 when it releases. \nAmazon, like most places, won't open pre-orders but we do know exactly when it'll have some NES Classics to purchase. An email was just sent out to interested Amazon customers that the mini console will be available on Friday at 2pm Pacific. Here's the product page just in case you want to keep tabs on it; we'll also put up a reminder post on Friday afternoon. \nThere are a few circumstances that are unique to the NES Classic since it's an item that Amazon says will have \"very limited quantities\" (although more are expected in the coming weeks). The NES Classic is restricted to one per customer. Further, one-click ordering is turned off. Because of the high demand, make sure you have your credit card and shipping details sorted ahead of time. \nWith this heads-up, most people should be able to nab one if they want one -- that is, if they have the benefit of not doing anything else at this very specific moment. Those without that luxury might find themselves waiting a couple of weeks. You are logged out.

      "text": "Share \nOnce trick-or-treating ends, the masks come off, and the shopping game faces go on. Retailers in-store are raring to go with news of their Black Friday shopping plans, from when stores are open and for how long. But online, the focus seems to be more so aimed at the weeks leading up to the minute shoppers wipe their mouths after indulging in their Thanksgiving meal. \nOf those that are already off to the online shopping races? Amazon, Walmart, Etsy and Home Depot have already made the biggest jumps up (over last year) on the Internet Retailer 2016 Top 500 Guide , in terms of both desktop and mobile traffic to their sites. Of the 100 companies listed in the guide, more than 746.8 million visits occurred — notably, just in the first five days of November. More than half of those visits were by way of mobile device. \nAmazon has been touting its Black Friday deals since Nov. 1. Walmart is hawking its “Early Bird Online Specials.” Home Depot has put up the signal for special Black Friday savings and “Lowest Prices Of The Year.” \nFor true and tangible context, Amazon was visited more than 385 million times globally in those first five days, according to website data from SimilarWeb. Whether or not that seems like a lot, compared to last year, it’s already up by 33 million more visits compared to last year at this time. \nWalmart trails with more than 54 million visits this year, which is nearly 7 million more than last year. Home improvement site HomeDepot.com has had 3 million more visitors this year over last year, leveling out at a total 20 million visits in these first five days. \nPerhaps most interesting is Etsy, which offers small businesses and crafters the opportunity for a global market. The platform was visited more than 30 million times in the first few days of the month, which is a bump up of more than 8 percent over last year. The site has not launched holiday promotions, but it has decorated the site to celebrate the festive shopping time. \nThe guide, however, does include some lagging companies and brands. The companies that have seen the biggest online visitor declines include Best Buy, Victoria’s Secret and Gap. They’re not alone: 76 of the 100 retailers listed did see a decline over last year.",

      "text": "Amazon’s tentacles are spreading far and wide. The one-time book delivery service is now a TV and film studio, a book publisher, and in its latest venture, an experimental fiction maker.\nIts new app launched on Nov. 2, Amazon Rapids, tells stories to kids by simulating two people messaging each other. The reader-user reads more by tapping after each text.\nDesigned to look like a messaging app, Rapids imitates a narrative unfolding through live conversation, much the same way Quartz’s own news app does.\nIts looks mimic that of the addictive app Hooked, which tells stories through the same conversational UI. Billed as “Fiction for the Snapchat generation” and marketed toward readers aged 13 to 24, Hooked was a finalist for this year’s Fast Company’s Co.Design innovation awards in the app category.\n“The text message format appeals to young readers, because it is visceral, conversational and bite-sized,” says Hooked CEO Prerna Gupta. “All critical elements when you’re trying to capture the attention of a young person who is otherwise glued to Instagram and Snapchat all day.”\nAvailable on iOS, Android, and Amazon’s Fire tablets, a subscription to Rapids is available for $2.99 a month. According to a release, “dozens” of new stories will be added monthly.\n\\",

      "text": "Jeff Bezos is frantically aborting that mission to send Donald Trump into space.\nAmazon’s billionaire boss — who joked last December he’d like to send Trump into orbit on a rocket operated by Blue Origin, his space-exploration startup — on Thursday congratulated Trump on winning the presidential election.\n“Congratulations to @realDonaldTrump,” Bezos tweeted . “I for one give him my most open mind and wish him great success in his service to the country.”\nBezos’s conciliatory tweet came after Amazon shares plunged as much as 7 percent early Thursday on worries that Trump might retaliate against the company when he takes the Oval Office.\nThe shares, which had dipped nearly 2 percent the day after the election, settled 3.8 percent lower Thursday at $742.38.\nLast December, Trump had begun attacking the Amazon founder after the Washington Post, which Bezos bought in 2013 for $250 million, ran a series of critical stories on the real-estate magnate.\n“The @WashingtonPost, which loses a fortune, is owned by@JeffBezos for purposes of keeping taxes down at his no profit company, @Amazon,” Trump tweeted at the time .\n“If @Amazon ever had to pay fair taxes, its stock would crash and it would crumble like a paper bag,” Trump added .\nThe President-elect also has said Amazon’s dominance in online retailing has created a “huge antitrust problem.”\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google WhatsApp Email Copy Filed under amazon ,  donald trump ,  jeff bezos",

But, when talking about world’s biggest online shopping sale, there is nothing bigger than China’s Singles Day Sale that is conducted by Alibaba. Celebrated on November 11, it was started as anti-Valentine’s Day for being single. The sale was designed to encourage ‘single’ customers to buy something and treat themselves with. While the sale has already started and will continue till 5PM IST tomorrow, even you can make the most of this shopping extravaganza and get products delivered here in India.

      "text": "(Photo via BigStock) President-elect Donald J. Trump’s antipathy toward Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos won’t threaten Amazon Web Services as the federal government’s major supplier of cloud computing, at least in the short term.\nThat’s the word from two analysts who say the bureaucracy is too thick, the competition is too weak, and AWS is too well entrenched for any vendetta to immediately affect Amazon’s cloud computing arm that helps a variety of federal government agencies with their cloud needs.\n“My guess is that Trump doesn’t even know what cloud computing is,” said Dan Scholnick, a general partner with Menlo Park, Calif., venture capital firm Trinity Ventures. “The part of Amazon he doesn’t like is the retail portion and the politics of Jeff Bezos.”\nAWS, which inked a $600-million cloud-computing contract with the CIA in 2013, offers a recorded webinar explaining “how to buy cloud computing for your agency” and gives the federal government its own dedicated data centers, collectively called the GovCloud (US) region. It’s designed to host sensitive data and regulated workloads and complies with U.S. government standards including the International Traffic in Arms Regulations and Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program. The region is operated by employees who are vetted “U.S. Persons,” and root account holders of AWS accounts must confirm they are U.S. Persons before being granted access credentials to the region.\nTrump’s first clash with Bezos came late last year. Bezos bought the Washington Post in 2013 for $250 million , and Trump claimed Bezos used the paper to influence politicians in Washington, D.C. and keep them from taxing Amazon.\nTrump has suggested Amazon could face antitrust issues under his presidency. In a May appearance on Sean Hannity’s Fox News show , he said: “He’s worried about me — I think he said that to somebody, it was in some article — where he thinks I would go after him for antitrust, because he’s got a huge antitrust problem, because he’s controlling so much. Amazon is controlling so much of what they’re doing.”\nBezos earlier this week congratulated Trump on his victory — a message quite different from those to Trump in the past. Bezos at one point joked on Twitter that he would “reserve him a seat on the Blue Origin rocket,” another venture he’s pursuing with his private fortune. In May, Bezos said Trump’s remarks were “not an appropriate way for a presidential candidate to behave.” \nDespite their bad blood, it would be tough for an irate President Trump to break off relations with AWS, which Scholnick estimated provides up to 80 percent of the federal government’s cloud computing.\n“First off, there are all sorts of things you need to do to work with the federal government,” he said. “You need data centers in the right places and need to have certain security standards in place. AWS has been working on this the longest, they have the largest data-center footprint and the most advanced functionality. So it’s not like the federal government has a lot of great alternatives at this point.”\nIn addition, he noted, “there’s an elaborate government procurement process and a big bureaucracy in the agencies that are using cloud computing. It’s not like the president can come in and change the rules overnight.”\nAnother factor is that a lot of cloud projects are massive migrations that have been planned over a number of years. “It would be hard to rewind them and just start over,” Scholnick said. “Maybe in two to three years, once the Trump administration has really settled in, we could see a change.”\nShawn McCarthy, research director for IDC Government Insights, echoed Scholnick’s sentiments.\n“The federal government is a very different place than private industry,” he said. “If someone makes you angry in private industry, you can always take your dollars and go elsewhere. In the federal government, there are very stringent guidelines for who can bid on a contract and how those contracts are awarded. So people — I’m not going to say Trump — can get in trouble by channeling business in a way that’s not appropriate.”It could happen, however, that Trump, as a businessman who prides himself on savvy management, might carefully assess the return on investment and total cost of ownership of cloud computing versus conventional on-premises IT. “Having that business focus, he’s likely to say ‘This is better’ or not,” McCarthy said.\nDespite a commanding lead, AWS isn’t the only public-cloud service to do business with the federal government. IBM in 2013 signed a ten-year, $1-billion deal to host the Interior Department’s computing. The same year, AWS beat out public-cloud rival IBM for a $600-million cloud-computing contract with the CIA. The National Security Administration has reportedly moved some of its IT infrastructure to AWS, as have the Defense Department and the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency.\nAzure and Google could very well make incursions into AWS’s federal dominance, Scholnick said.\n“We’ll see big changes over the next few years. Both Microsoft and Google have very credible cloud strategies. AWS and Google don’t know how to sell to the enterprise, whereas Microsoft has relations with every enterprise in the world. So Microsoft is in the pole position to really dominate the enterprise space over the next five years, and that’s great for their federal presence.”\nNeither AWS nor Microsoft reveals the percentage it holds of the federal cloud computing business or the percentage of its revenue derived from federal cloud computing. Scholnick estimated that their respective market shares roughly reflect those for the market in general. Estimates put Amazon far in the lead in terms of infrastructure and platform as a service, with Microsoft second and Google a distant third.\nAWS specifically courts the federal government, while Microsoft Azure promotes itself to all governments , not the federal government in particular.\nIDC said in February that the federal government would spend about 8.5 percent of its IT budget, or just over $6.7 billion, for cloud computing in its FY16, up from only 5 percent in FY15. (The federal government’s FY17 began on October 1, 2016 and will end on September 30, 2017.)\nFederal spending on infrastructure as a service increased in FY16 to $1.2 billion, from $1.1 billion the year before. Spending on software as a service increased to $702.9 million, from $700.7 million. Spending on platform as a service increased to $231.3 million, to $227.1 million. And “other” cloud spending, which wasn’t defined, totaled $4.6 billion in FY15, with an increase of $45.2 million in FY16.\nThe cloud will account for half of all federal IT spending by 2018, estimated IDC’s McCarthy.",

      "text": "Finally (Picture: Getty Images) If your kids have made wild in-app purchases on Amazon, then you can breathe a sigh of relief – because the company just got ordered to refund parents. \nAny purchases made by children without their parents’ permission between 2011 and 2014 will now be refunded, thanks to a ruling from Seattle-based judge John Coughenour.\nAnother smartphone has ditched the headphone jack The Federal Trade Commission took legal action against the company in 2014, saying it was too easy for kids to spend their parents’ money while playing games on mobile devices.\nAfter settling similar cases against Apple and Google, all three companies now require a password for in-app purchases, or an opt-in setting to enable purchases without a password.\nHowever, the FTC’s request for a lump refund of $25.6million – around £20million – was rejected by Judge Coughener, who said the figure was ‘too high’.\nThe judge also, somewhat unsurprisingly, turned down Amazon’s offer to provide the reimbursement in the form of gift cards.\nIt was way too easy to authorise in-app purchases (Picture: PA) Amazon and other platforms started offering people the option of paying for extra content inside mobile apps, including games and music platforms, in 2011.\nParents soon complained about how easy it was for kids to make purchases while on the apps, either without their permission or by accident.\nIf you're using one of these passwords for anything then you're a moron And when it first took action, the FTC said: ‘When Amazon introduced in-app charges to the Amazon Appstore in November 2011, there were no password requirements of any kind on in-app charges, including in kids’ games and other apps that appeal to children.’\nOne example it gave was of a game called Ice Age Village, in which kids could use free ‘acorns’ or ‘coins’ as currency. However, players could also buy more of them with actual money, in a scene that was ‘visually similar’ to the free exchange.\nAmazon introduced changes to how in-app purchases are described and authorised in 2014.\nIn separate settlements, Apple agreed to refund customers more than $30million (£20million at the time) and Google around $19million (£13million).",

      "text": "How Trump vs. Bezos Will Affect Amazon (AMZN) Stock November 11, 2016, 06:40:00 PM EDT By Raymond Keane, Zacks.com Shutterstock photo \nOn Tuesday, Donald Trump was elected to be the 45th President of The United Sates of America. While many citizens either celebrated or protested this historic victory, Amazon AMZN CEO Jeff Bezos needed to back track on some of his previous comments about the President-Elect. \nBezos is the CEO of AMZN, which is currently trading at $738.39 per share. He also owns the Washington Post, a prestigious newspaper that he purchased in 2013 for $250 million. Both men have been exchanging words for over a year now over accusations made by Trump regarding Bezos' use of his newspaper company to get out of paying taxes. According to the President-Elect , \"Amazon is getting away with murder tax-wise. He's using the Washington Post for power so that the politicians in Washington don't tax Amazon like they should be taxed.\" \nTrump's biggest problem with AMZN is that he believes Bezos is outsourcing too many jobs to overseas nations and taking jobs from Americans. As quoted in the Seattle Times , \"Free trade fills the company's sails - as it builds a planetary network of warehouses, transportation and profitable data centers that are turning it into a truly global store. At the end of 2015, more than a third of Amazon's physical footprint was in countries other than the U.S., and about 32 percent of its retail sales were made overseas. Trump has also railed against the trade deals that facilitate some of that commerce, saying they're not advantageous enough to the U.S.\" \nThroughout his campaign, Trump's biggest message was to \"Make America Great Again,\" implying the attempt to make more jobs here domestically. Trump believes Bezos is getting away with paying little to no taxes and embarking on foreign trade agreements that aren't benefiting anyone in the United States besides Amazon itself. \nEven though there is no proof that Bezos or Amazon is indeed using the political reach of the Washington Post to avoid paying taxes, the fact Donald Trump was elected president caused Bezos to concede to the future leader. Bezos tweeted from his verified Twitter TWTR account: \"Congratulations to @RealDonaldTrump I for one give him my most open mind and wish him great success in his service to the country.\" \nThis came after AMZN stock has seen an immense drop in price over the past few days. Prior to the election results on Tuesday, November 8th at 3:40pm, AMZN was trading at $789.72. In just three days, the stock has dropped over $51 to its current price of $738.39. Stockholders are showing fear that Trump being elected will cause some major negative changes to the company. This explains why Bezos tweeted that positive message for the President-Elect; he needs to help protect his company's well being. \nCurrently, AMZN is a #3 (Hold) on the Zacks Rank, with a VGM score of 'C.'

      "text": "By Kim Komando \n  The Kim Komando Show   livefyre Email Print Illustration file picture. (REUTERS/Kacper Pempel/Files) \nWhen a relationship gets serious, we start to share more of our lives. We borrow each other’s cars. We move in together. Inevitably, we start sharing each other’s technology and even our passwords.\nBut your device says a lot about you: Your pastimes, your taste in music, your curiosities and the things you shop for. So how do you maintain your privacy online, even with the people who are closest to you?\nHere are a few simple tricks to help you keep your secrets under wraps. (Note: Apps and websites do not always work the same across all devices and operating systems. If something isn’t located in the menus precisely as I say, look around for a similar action.)\nAmazon \nAmazon tracks not only what you have purchased, but also what you have browsed. If you share an Amazon account, both can pose a major problem especially this time of year.\nThe good news is that you can easily cover your tracks. To erase your browsing history, from your account settings, look for the Personalization section. Go to Personalized Content >> View and Manage Your Browsing History. Here, you have a few options. You can remove only certain items or all items as well as turn off browsing history, so you never have this issue again.\nLet’s say you want to make it more difficult for someone to find out what you have ordered. Amazon will not completely delete your order history, but you can archive individual orders. Casual snoops will have a harder time seeing what you have purchased. From your account settings, go to Your Orders. Select the item you wish to hide and select Archive order.\nYou can use the Amazon app as an additional holiday security measure. Suppose you have purchased a pair of shoes for your spouse, you’ve archived the order, and now you’re waiting for the package to arrive. But you’re receiving so many boxes this time of year, how do you know which delivery to open and wrap?\nWith the Amazon app, you can scan the barcode on the box to immediately find out what’s inside. It works like a charm – unless your spouse has secretly ordered something for you!\nBy the way, Amazon has added a slew of new benefits for Prime members from unlimited photo storage to free ebooks. Click here for seven Amazon Prime perks you’re probably not using. \nGoogle \nGoogle often auto-completes your search terms based on personal information, such as your location and previous searches. Anyone looking over your shoulder or borrowing your device might be surprised by the guesses Google makes. Google products that collect your information include Chrome, Google Maps, and YouTube.\nTo delete your search history on Google, you need a Google account. Just log in, go to My Activity, and remove items individually.\nBetter yet, take control of the data Google saves about you. Click here for step-by-step instructions on how to stop Google from collecting data about you. \nMost browsers have a similarly easy way to delete your browsing history, and the controls tend to be in your browser’s preferences. Keep this in mind, especially if you’re researching something a little unusual.\nFacebook \nFor many of us, Facebook is like a sprawling digital yearbook. Maybe you have a family computer, and you usually forget to log out of Facebook. Other people use the same computer, they stumble into your Facebook account, and they notice your conspicuous search history.\nYour significant other may wonder why you’ve become so curious about the person you once invited to the prom, no matter how innocent your interest.\nThe easiest way to avoid an awkward conversation is to open your Activity Log on your Facebook page. Select More from the column at left >> Search >> Clear Searches. Or you can remove each search item one by one.\nYour Facebook Activity Log stores a lot of data about you. Click here for tips to clean it up and prevent things from coming back to haunt you. \nNetflix \nWe all have our guilty pleasures, especially when it comes to movies. You may have privately viewed Lars Von Trier’s \"Nymphomaniac\" and thought it was a great work of art-house cinema, but that could be hard to explain to a roomful of people.\nIf you want to hide past screenings, just go to My Account >> Viewing History. Be advised that items aren’t always deleted immediately; it may take 24 hours for your lists to update on all devices.\nNetflix also allows you to create multiple profiles. Many households don’t bother with this unless they have children, but if you want to keep your viewing history private, you can create a personal profile and protect it with a password. Click here to learn how to do this as well as access secret Netflix categories. \nGo incognito \nEvery major web browser including Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Internet Explorer, Safari, and Opera has private, or incognito, browsing settings. Turning this feature on means your browser will ignore cookies including ad-tracking cookies and won't record your browsing history. It's almost like you weren't online. Click here to learn how to enable this simple step to keep your browsing history a secret. \nMaintaining privacy is one of my favorite themes. To learn other ways to protect your information, be sure to listen or download my podcasts, or click here to find it on your local radio station .

Google Images), automatically download the first KB of the file to get its real size from the file header Use multiple threads or processes automatically when relevant, to speed up processing Automatically reuse TCP connections (HTTP Keep-Alive), for better performance Automatically retry failed HTTP requests Music library scan supports all common audio formats (MP3, AAC, Vorbis, FLAC..) Cover sources page or API changes are quickly detected, thanks to high test coverage, and SACAD is quickly updated accordingly Installation \nSACAD requires Python >= 3.3. From PyPI (with PIP) If you don’t already have it, install pip for Python 3 (not needed if you are using Python >= 3.4) Install SACAD: pip3 install sacad From source If you don’t already have it, install setuptools for Python 3 Clone this repository: git clone https://github.com/desbma/sacad Install SACAD: python3 setup.py install Standalone Windows executable \nWindows users can also download a standalone binary which does not require Python .

      "text": "He Made 21,078% Buying Amazon. Heres His New Pick \nEvery week, the Federal Reserve adds up the balance sheets of every single commercial bank in the United States -- going so far to include U.S. branches of foreign banks -- and publishes the aggregate data. This gives us some insight into what the banking industry as a whole is doing at any given point in time. The chart below was created with a recent data release by the Federal Reserve. \nYou probably aren't surprised by the chart above. Banks are lenders first and foremost, with about 57% of their assets tied up in loans to individuals and businesses across the United States. They also invest in securities, mostly government and government-backed bonds, and obviously keep some cash lying around to meet regulatory requirements and facilitate withdrawals. \nContinue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT \nIn this article, I'll focus exclusively on loans, which make up a majority of the average bank's balance sheet and source of income. This is where banks differentiate from one another, building their loan portfolios in different ways with the goal of generating high amounts of income with the least amount of risk. \nAdmittedly, there are many different types of loans, each with their own opportunities and risks for the banking industry. And while most banks offer a full line of loan products, many tend to favor one type over another. In a small city, one bank might be the bank for personal mortgages, while another competes aggressively for car loans, and yet another prefers to underwrite commercial loans to businesses. \nTaken together, though, we can see what the banking industry does as a whole, and thus create a model for who the \"average bank\" lends to. Residential mortgages, banks' bread and butter -- 14% of bank assets \nSurprise! Residential mortgages make up most of the banking industry's assets. This category includes single-family homes, all the way up to properties with four units (fourplexes, for example). To a lesser extent, this segment also includes home equity loans, though banks have generally shied away from home equity loans after getting walloped by losses during the financial crisis. \nGenerally protected by large down payments and borrower behavior -- no one wants to turn their house over to the bank -- residential real estate losses are typically very low. Note that in every single year in the 17 years leading up to the financial crisis, banks charged off less than 0.5% of their residential real estate loans. Of course, losses skyrocketed during 2008, but they've been trending back down to historical levels ever since. C&I loans, the everyday business loan -- 13% of bank assets \nUp next are commercial and industrial loans, frequently referred to as C&I loans, which make up about 13% of assets across commercial banks. Under the broadest definition, this includes virtually every loan to a business that isn't secured by real estate. C&I loans are typically backed by specific collateral -- inventory or accounts receivables, for example. Larger and established businesses can getunsecured loans that are backed only by the company's ability to repay. \nBanks like C&I loans because they typically pay variable, or floating, interest rates. Thus, C&I loans help mitigate the increased interest expense banks pay on deposits when rates rise, and they often enable banks to earn larger profits during periods of rising interest rates. \nBecause C&I loans are usually backed by specific collateral, and only issued to companies with established business histories, loan losses tend to be modest, even during very deep recessions. The chart below shows charge-offs since 1985. Note how losses rise and fall with the business cycle, peaking during recessions but staying relatively low during periods of economic growth. Commercial real estate, the boom-and-bust loan -- 12% of assets \nCommercial real estate (CRE) loans come in third at 12% of the banking industry's assets. This segment is self-explanatory. Loans backed by nonresidential property -- everything from car washes to factories and retail storefronts -- make up about 60% of all CRE loans. To a lesser extent, multifamily residential property (structures with more than four units), construction loans, and loans on farmland also appear here. \nCommercial real estate loans can be very profitable for banks. Banks typically protect themselves by lending 60%-70% or less of a property's value. Thus, a bank might only lend a company $600,000 against a property worth $1 million, which provides a cushion that protects banks from losses should property values decline. \nOver the last 25 years, CRE losses were virtually nonexistent outside two major events. The worst losses typically follow periods of too much construction and oversupply, which was the case in the early 90s and late 00s. \nWithin this category, construction loans are the culprit for the most devastating losses. Speculative by their nature, the collateral that backs a problem construction loan -- half-finished buildings or undeveloped land -- can be very difficult for banks to sell. It's an unfortunate reality that bank foreclosures on real estate are most frequent in periods where buyers are already few and far between. Other loans, mostly loans to financial companies -- 10% of assets \nThe \"other loans\" category includes some borrowing arrangements with nonbank lenders, loans to financial companies that are not lenders (insurers, for example), and other loans that are \"simply not elsewhere classified.\" It's a true \"other\" category, to be sure. \nBanks are often lenders to other lenders and investors. For example, many of the non-traditional lenders you see in shopping centers borrow money from banks to lend it to individuals and businesses. Similarly, private equity funds establish credit lines with banks to be able to deploy cash quickly, and then worry about establishing long-term financing for the investment at a later date. SVB Financial is one such bank that specializes in loans to financial clients, primarily private equity investors. \nLoans to non-bank financial companies are generally the domain of the largest banks in the United States. Smaller banks tend to be more \"plain-vanilla\" and prefer traditional residential or commercial real estate loans. Consumer loans, high returns but very high risk -- 9% of assets \nSo-called consumer loans make up about 9% of bank assets. Car and credit card loans make up the overwhelming majority of bank loans to consumers. Student loans and loans for medical expenses and other personal expenditures make up a much smaller share. \nWhile most banks will happily issue personal loans or credit cards -- banks charge more than 9% on personal loans and just under 14% on credit card balances, on average -- few banks make personal lending a priority. All things considered, most banks would prefer to make one $5 million loan than make and monitor 1,000 loans to individuals of $5,000 each. \nLoan losses tend to be relatively high, regardless of economic conditions. That means banks need to have fully staffed and dedicated collection and customer service departments at all times.For this reason, it's usually an all-or-nothing business -- lenders will specialize in personal lending, or engage in very little or no consumer lending at all. \nSome specialists include Capital One Financial , American Express , and Discover Financial , whichare all banks by definition, but they certainly aren't the prototypical bank given their focus on consumer lending. What banks really do \nThere are some important conclusions that we can draw from this simple study of the banking industry. \nFirst, banks largely exist to serve the real estate industry. The vast majority of loans and securities that are on bank balance sheets are ultimately secured by real estate, from single-family homes to apartment buildings and farmland. To say that real estate and banking are related would be a massive understatement. \nSecondly, though we think of banks as a risk business, banks are primarily in the business of avoiding as much risk as possible. Outside of personal loans and credit cards, banks want valuable collateral to minimize their risk of loss. And even with rock-solid collateral in place, banks will only make loans equal to a fraction of the collateral value. \nThe simple truth is that the very best banks will put a dollar at risk with the hope of making a penny after losses, operating expenses, and credit losses. There is very little room for error in the banking industry. \nFinally, the banking industry is very competitive. There are more than 5,200 banks in the United States, in addition to credit unions and non-bank lenders. That means that for every type of loan discussed in this article, there are thousands of institutions that will underwrite it. \nAs a bank customer, use competition to your advantage and shop around. As a bank investor, realize that competition ensures that very few banks can and will generate outsized returns over long periods of time. \nA secret billion-dollar stock opportunity The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

      "title": "One Third Of Prime Members Buy From Amazon At Least Once A Week",
      "text": "Source: courtesy of Amazon.com Inc. Outsiders have questioned whether Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) makes much money from its Prime membership service. Maybe Amazon underprices its benefits, or gives away too many services for free. A new survey shines light on the potential power of Prime. One third of its members buy something from Amazon at least once a week\nAccording to Feedvisor’s Amazon User Study 2016:\n● Amazon uses aren’t exclusive: 61 percent of Amazon users have also made a purchase on a brand or retailer’s site, such as Walmart.com or Gap.com, in the last year.\n● Prime members shop Amazon more often: About a third of Prime members make purchases on Amazon at LEAST once per week, compared to 5 percent of non-Prime members.\n● Shipping costs are a deterrent to sales: More than 85 percent of customers consider shipping charges to be a deal-breaker.\n● Amazon users consider third-party sellers to be reliable: Nearly 80 percent of Prime and 60 percent of non-Prime members have purchased from third-party sellers.\nPrime costs users $10.99 a month. At the same time, it costs Amazon a great deal. Amazon has gone into highly expensive in-house exclusive programming to compete with NetFlix (NASDAQ: NFLX). It offers unlimited photo storage, free, unlimited use of Audible, two million free songs, and a massive library of streaming video.\nIf the Feedvisor data is accurate, Prime may be among the best ideas Amazon has ever had.\nMethodology:\nThe study was conducted by Feedvisor, the algorithmic repricing and revenue intelligence company. It surveyed more than 1,500 U.S. Amazon users and showed how they rely on the online marketplace for price and product information during their shopping journeys.\n ",

      "text": "Amazon’s fulfillment center in Rugeley (Picture: Getty Images) A fire has hit an Amazon distribution centre just weeks before the busy Christmas period. \nThe blaze started at around 2am this morning, with six firefighter crews attending the warehouse in Rugeley, Staffordshire.\nThey managed to evacuate workers from the building and extinguish the fire but it’s not yet known what impact it will have on deliveries.\n‘There was a small fire in the Rugeley fulfilment centre in the early hours of this morning which was quickly extinguished,’ the company told the Express & Star. \nMORE: Amazon drivers ‘forced to poo in bags’ on ‘illegal shifts with no time for breaks’ \nStaffordshire Police added: ‘The fire was safely extinguished and Staffordshire Police forensic investigators were able to examine the scene of the incident.\n‘CID colleagues are still on scene and our enquiries are ongoing into the cause of the incident.’\nThe Rugeley centre has 1,500 permanent staff members but this can spike to 4,500 during the holiday season.\nStaffordshire Police are still investigating the fire.\nMetro.co.uk has contacted Amazon for a further comment.\nMORE: Teenager bullied at school for her thick eyebrows gets modelling contract \nMORE: Man gets huge banner outing his neighbour as a sex offender ",
