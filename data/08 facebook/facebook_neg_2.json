      "text": "Written by Shruti Dhapola | Published:November 10, 2016 3:29 pm Facebook and the role of social in democracies is under more scrutiny, especially after the recent US presidential elections. Representational Image \nUS election results are out and for most of the world it is quite a shocker. That Donald J Trump would emerge victorious, was not an expected outcome. It has also been acknowledged that for most Americans this was a bitterly divided election. And while the post-election analysis will continue, the role of Facebook and Twitter and social media in general has come under scatching criticism and scrutiny for its role in this election. \nFacebook’s ‘Fake News’ problem was something that even Obama acknowledged just days before the election. At a campaign in rally in Michigan, the now out-going US President had this to say, “The way campaigns have unfolded, we just start accepting crazy stuff as normal… As long as it is on Facebook, and people can see it, as long as it’s on social media, people start believing it, and it creates this dust cloud of nonsense.” \nWhat Obama is referring to isn’t new. Facebook and fake news have been an issue for sometime now, and it is not isolated to the US. In India too, fake and unverified news articles with sensation claims will trend faster and for days. False news reports around how an FBI officer investigating Clinton’s emails had died, malicious reports about Clinton’s top aide Huma Abedin, claims of how 88 US generals were defying Hillary Clinton, and many more trended and were shared by users on the social network. \nMore disturbingly, a BuzzFeed News investigation had shown how over 140 pro-Trump websites with sensational political headlines were being run by teens in Macedonia, looking to make a quick buck by increasing engagement and readership on their websites. \nAnd it is not just a Facebook problem. On Twitter, it was being claimed Pro-Hillary voters could do so via text, which was clearly false and misleading. Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey himself admitted they had no clue how they missed something so crucial. \nIn India too, we have seen fake, unverified stories trend on Facebook. When the JNU saga was unfolding, one of the first trends was ‘Shut down JNU.’ If you had no clue what this was about, you’d have been convinced that shutting down JNU was the only solution. More so another JNU student Umar Khalid was trending for days as a JEM terrorist sympathiser on Facebook; this when no official government agency had said anything of the sort. Pictures of Umar with captions like he is a terrorist, anti-India, etc were shared for many days, without any proof and Facebook didn’t take down the topic either. \nAlso read: Donald Trump’s victory: Questions raised over Facebook, Twitter’s role \nOf course, in India, the best place for spreading rumours on social media is WhatsApp. I’m pretty sure everyone has gotten the latest message about the Rs 2,000 note with the miracle Nano-GPS chip. FYI, it is totally false. Then there were pictures shared of dead bodies of terrorists killed by the Indian Army in the recent surgical strikes. Except these pictures, shared judiciously on WhatsApp Groups across India, were not remotely connected with the surgical strikes. And these are just some recent examples. Daily messages claiming a miracle via a natural Indian cure for everything are an everyday part of family WhatsApp groups in India. \nIn light of the recent US elections, Facebook has itself denied that the News Feed played a devastating role in promoting fake news. Bloomberg quoted a Facebook spokesperson: “While Facebook played a part in this election, it was just one of the many ways people received their information – and was one of the many ways people connected with their leaders, engaged in the political process and shared their views.” \nTo some extent that’s true. Facebook and social media in general are just a source of news, but for a growing number of people these are the only sources. Homepage traffic is down across the world for websites, and this is true in India as well. People read more news shared by their friends on Facebook, rather than actually go to news websites. \nBut the problem is that Facebook’s 1 billion plus reach means fake news gets amplified a lot stronger than it would say with a traditional news media outlet. The more sensational a headline on Facebook, higher the clicks, likes and shares. And if you click on a lot of these, Facebook’s News Feed will feed you more of them. Your bias, your bubble, whichever side of the spectrum you might be leaning towards, is only going to get stronger, because the News Feed will show you more of what it thinks you want to see. \nThe fake news problem has also exacerbated since Facebook has no human editors looking at these trending topics anymore. It’s all based on an algorithm, ready to serve and validate people’s biases. There is no human judgement deciding which stories could be fake, damaging, libelous. And unless people start reporting them as false they will get shared, liked a whole lot more on the social network. The problem lies with relying on the wisdom of the crowds. \nFor every link you click on Facebook you are likely to be shown five other similar links below it. And don’t be surprised if at least one of these is from a news source you have not heard of before. Zuckerberg might insist Facebook is a tech company and not a media one, but the truth is that for a lot of people social media, be it Facebook or WhatsApp is now a source of news. And it seems that fake news has an edge on engagement. © The Indian Express Online Media Pvt Ltd Tags:",

      "title": "Facebook has signed up Singapore’s entire civil service to its Workplace chat platform",
      "text": "2 hours ago \nFacebook’s Workplace chat platform for businesses just got a huge boost. \nSingapore’s civil service is adopting the platform for all 143,000 of its public servants by March 2017. It’s the first civil service in the world to use Facebook’s business-focused chat platform, according to Peter Ong, the head of Singapore’s civil service. \nTo get an idea of how big this is, if Singapore’s entire civil service indeed starts using Workplace, it would represent about 11% of Slack’s paid user base. That’s rapid progress for Facebook’s product that was just launched a month ago. \nWorkplace charges $1 per user per month for groups larger than 10,000 people, which suggests $1.7 million in revenue for Facebook each year from the Singapore deal. What’s more, the city-state’s civil service grows at a rate of 2.5% annually, according to the government , which means an additional 2,860 accounts per year for Workplace. \nOng said in a speech at an awards ceremony that 5,300 civil servants already use Facebook’s messaging app as part of its first phase of adoption, which started in October. The platform is apparently a hit: Some 82% of civil servants who activated their accounts are active weekly users, Ong said. The number of emails has gone down—replaced by Workplace posts—and there is an “explosion of activity” as workers collaborate more actively than before, he said. \n“Wouldn’t it be amazing,” Ong noted, “that 143,000 people can form sub-groups, go onto one, whole-of-government platform to share ideas, collaborate, and find out about one another?” \nSingapore’s civil service is in the midst of another sweeping technology change: it’s removing internet access from workers’ computers to reduce hacking risks. Over 100,000 computers used by the civil service will not have direct internet access by next May. It’s unclear, then, whether Workplace will be accessed solely on workers’ mobile devices, which are allowed to connect to the internet. We’ve asked the civil service to clarify this point. \nThe work-messaging scene is hot right now. Microsoft entered the market with its Teams product earlier this month, and Slack duly played the role of the rebellious upstart by taunting it with a full-page ad in the New York Times. \nNabbing Singapore’s government as a Workplace customer is a coup for Facebook, and it puts Microsoft, with its prowess in selling enterprise software to governments and corporations, on notice. And Slack, which first made enterprise chat cool, certainly has its work cut out for it. Read full story",

      "text": "A week with Google’s Daydream, why Facebook should be nervous Daydream is the platform, View is the headset, we explain it all share \nDaydream, Google’s new VR platform , isn’t a product in the way we think of the Oculus Rift and HTC Vive, or even the Gear VR. It’s a set of standards for both phones and headsets that are designed to deliver a comfortable, inviting and mobile virtual reality experience. The View is just the first headset to launch for the platform, and for now the only phone that is Daydream-ready is Google’s Pixel. Which is a pretty great phone , if you’re in the market. The Daydream View in action Jeff Ramos/Polygon There will be other Daydream-ready phones, although no specific models have been announced yet. There will be other headsets from other companies that conform to the Daydream spec but may look different or target different markets. But today we’re going to talk about the View, Google’s first-party attempt to define what a Daydream headset can be, and the Daydream platform. It’s a bit of a strange product when compared to other virtual reality headsets, but Google’s dedication to virtual reality is impressive. Cardboard is already the most widely-used virtual reality platform in the world, and this is the next step up from those inexpensive, and in some ways unimpressive, entry-level viewers. This isn’t a scored review because Daydream is likely to be a variety of devices very soon, and we didn’t have access to a large variety of software before launch. But we’re going to dig deep into the system, share some thoughts and try to explain Google’s next big step into higher-end VR. So ... how is it? And what is it? The phone is doing all the work \"There are a few key things,\" Relja Markovic, the engineering director of VR at Google, told Polygon. \"The viewer doesn’t have any active electronics in it, so when you put the phone in the viewer the phone basically detects the viewer using [near field communication]. So that’s the core signal that says ‘oh, OK, I should be thinking about going into VR now.\" The View also includes two capacitive nubs on the inside of the headset, and the Pixel senses where those touch the screen and figures out how the phone is resting in the viewer in order to align the image correctly. There is nothing to fiddle with or connect directly; you just put the phone in, the VR mode kicks in, and the image is perfect every time. My only problem with this system is that sometimes the headset didn’t seem to recognize the phone, so I had to remove it and put it back in. This happened rarely enough to not be a huge bother, but often enough that it’s worth noting. I also had to manually close the VR application on the phone after removing it from the View, it never seemed to know when to go back to standard phone mode. A Pixel phone going into the View Google This is a very different approach than the Gear VR, which includes its own electronics to decrease the latency of the Samsung phones that powered it, while also offering a touch pad for built-in controls. The issue of latency is what makes Cardboard viewers so hard on the stomach at times; the view lags too far behind your movements due to the viewers’ dependency of the hardware in the phone that powers it. The View is a cloth and plastic shell with a set of lenses and a wireless controller, and that’s it. The Pixel is doing all the heavy lifting to make virtual reality possible. \"The Pixel is just the first of many Daydream-ready phones,\" Markovic explained. \"We actually have certification requirements for things like the display to make sure it’s capable of certain low-persistence output modes. The [inertial measurement unit] isn’t just any old IMU, but actually meets very specific tolerances for precision and refresh rate.\" My god it's fast The only phone, at the moment, that’s Daydream-ready. The Google Pixel. | Jeff Ramos/Polygon Daydream-ready phones also have to meet or exceed certain minimums in terms of graphical performance in order to perform well under the strain of VR applications. So the View’s job is to tell the Pixel to go into VR mode, and then hold it comfortably near your face. There are no electronics or sensors involved in the headset itself, which will make it easier for other companies to release their own take on what a Daydream headset could be. At Daydream’s launch, however, Google’s View is the first and only option. Let’s dig in. The View Google likes to describe the View as being inspired by things that you wear, and it absolutely looks like a pair of sweatpants for your face. It’s covered completely in cloth, with a squishy, removable and hand-washable mask that presses against your face. There are no cables or anything needed to connect, you just remove the controller, drop the phone in and go. Google sent us a Pixel XL to use with the device, and it looks a bit silly when connected, as if it doesn’t quite fit. But the auto alignment system works well, and you always get a good view of what’s going, even if the phone is slightly askew. The front plate actually slides away from the rest of the headset using some clever extenders on the bottom, so it will be able to fit a wide variety of phones, or even a Pixel that’s using a thin to moderate case. It’s a nice touch. The Daydream View | Jeff Ramos/Polygon It’s also comfortable as hell. The squishy front mask plays nice with your glasses, to the point where I never even noticed I was wearing vision correction while in VR — a nice change from headsets like the Rift that often force you to fumble with your glasses when you put on or remove the headset — and the pressure is distributed evenly around the face once you fiddle with it a bit to get it seated corrected. And that moment of fiddling is important; the View, like most VR headsets, has a \"sweet spot\" that allows you to see the image with maximum clarity. It can take a moment to find that sweet spot — my advice would be to look at text while doing so to help notice the difference — but it should only take you a moment to put it on once you get used to the process. The design is kind of goofy-looking at first, but it’s also oddly friendly. It’s a piece of technology that invites touching and squeezing; it’s approachable in way many virtual reality headsets aren’t. This is meant to be something you hold and feel, and people I’ve handed it to seem to love playing with it even before putting it on. Even the clasp on top is a stretchy loop with a small bit of fabric to grab onto and hook around body of the headset to close it. The View’s face mask is squishy, and comfortable Jeff Ramos/Polygon I’ve noticed many people are scared to break a VR headset when they hold one for the first time, but I have yet to see anyone treat the View with the same gingerness. My wife remarked that it looked like it was covered with Oprah’s T-shirt sheets , which is apparently a thing. The View seemed like an object of curiosity when I showed it to people; everyone wanted to hold it and feel the cloth and play with the top clasp. Google did a great job creating VR hardware that seems playful, and anecdotally people are responding to its unorthodox looks. The View’s faceplate also both hides and holds the system’s controller, which is a nice detail that makes the controller harder to lose. That’s a good thing, because that controller is another way the Daydream View stands out. The controller The controller that comes with the View isn’t just the View controller, it’s the Daydream controller. Developers don’t have the option of using a standard Bluetooth controller for their game, nor does the headset itself include a touchpad or any other means of interaction outside of looking around. The controller is it. The controller slips into the mask for storage | Google In practice it operates like the bastard child of a remote control and a laser pointer. The bottom button will take you back to the home screen with a tap, or re-center the View and the controller in the direction you’re facing if you hold it down. The middle button’s use is left up to the developer, and the top, indented dish is both a touchpad and a button. There are also volume controls on the side, which is a nice touch. It’s also motion-tracked, and you see a virtual representation of the controller in the home menu and many of the games, allowing you to point at things you’d like to interact with, wave a magic wand or aim a gun. The controller is comfortable to hold, and easy to understand | Jeff Ramos/Polygon You can see one use of it in the user interface for the Google Street View app. The downside to the controller is that it only offers three degrees of freedom, instead of the six you get with the HTC Vive controller. That means you can point the controller in any direction, or even twist it so it’s facing downward, and the tracking is solid. What it can’t do is move in and out of the game world; it’s not actually a tracked object in 3D space. So in the top right image below, imagine the controller is locked in place, but you can point it in any direction or flip it over to see its back. You can also switch it to left-handed mode in the options. Searching in Street View | Google Thumb movement on the pad | Google The View controller, showing the volume buttons | Jeff Ramos/Polygon And Google has found some interesting ways to make that controller feel natural. The controller doesn’t actually stay in one place as you move it around the home menu, it slides around as if it were on the surface of a sphere in order to model your elbow. It fakes you into feeling like the controller has more sensors than it actually does, and it’s an effective illusion. \"We can give you a really strong sense of a connection with your hand,\" Markovic told Polygon. Google also provides developers with best practices for the controller, and helps show them the best ways to model hand movement in their games. \"We have a suite of kinda mathematical libraries that lets developers translate ... you give us the context of your app, the controller gives us its state, and then our library adapts one to the other,\" Markovic explained. The controller fits snugly in the View when not in use Jeff Ramos/Polygon And again, this is the controller for Daydream. Other companies can create and offer their versions of it, but the basic ability and number of buttons will always remain the same. And developers are already finding neat ways to use it; the kart-racing game on Daydream has you hold the control horizontally and turn it to steer, while using the button on the left-hand side for throttle. The controller also suffers from a moderate amount of drift, and I found myself holding the home button every five minutes or so to re-center the pointer. This will happen often enough that it’s addressed in the system’s first tutorial introducing you to Daydream. You’ll want to re-center things if you move the position of your arm or hand as well, as the controller works best for most apps and games when you hold your shoulder still and move either your elbow or your wrist. It’s a bit hard to get used, but it does allow for some impressively expressive motions in games that use it well. So how is it? The Daydream View is exactly what you want it to be: A higher-end version of the Cardboard platform with a motion controller, lower latency and all the advantages of being created by Google. I was told they were able to achieve a bit better than 20ms of motion-to-photon latency , which is a technical way of saying it won’t make you sick as you look around the world. The headset is comfortable, even during long sessions, and the controller allows for some interesting interactions while inside games and applications. There’s a nifty welcome application that explains the various aspects of the hardware, and you can revisit the brief tutorial if you want to introduce anyone else to the View. The YouTube app is pretty slick in virtual reality Google And Google gets to flex its software muscles with the launch applications. The Street View app allows you to explore famous places and even warp around them a bit, and the YouTube VR app is one of the best video applications I’ve ever used in virtual reality. You can watch 360 degree video, which can be blocky messes if you’re not on a fast connection, but standard videos work just as well; you can click and drag the virtual screen anywhere you’d like, while making it bigger or smaller by sliding your thumb up or down on the touchpad. If you have YouTube Red you can also download 360 degree videos and watch them locally as well. There’s a Google Photos application that can sync to your existing Google Photos account so you can look at your holiday snaps in virtual reality, or you can download the Cardboard Camera application and create your own virtual reality panoramas, complete with a sound clip, to view in your virtual gallery. Google Play Store App | Google Google Daydream Home | Google Google Photos | Google Google Play Movies | Google You buy new Daydream apps through the Google Play store, which takes you to its VR section when used in the View, and there’s a Google Play Movies application that lets you watch movies or trailers in a virtual reality theater. If you already own TV shows or Movies you bought through Google play, you can watch them in virtual reality. Many of your Google accounts and services link into the Daydream ecosystem. I asked about the ability to play local videos or videos I shot using the phone in a virtual theater, and I was told that one workaround is to upload the videos to YouTube in a private account and then download them using YouTube Red to watch them locally. It’s an overly complex solution to a simple problem, but Google also stressed to me that Daydream is an open platform, and we’ll likely see theater apps for local video pop up on the story relatively quickly. We were able to try a few games in the review bundle of applications that Google sent us, including a VR version of Mekorama , a collection of carnival-based minigames called Wonderglade , and a hack-and-slash type deal called Hunter’s Gate . More content should be available at launch, which means right now, but we were only given access to a select few games and applications for review purposes. It’s kind of neat to see a 3D representation of the stock market in the Wall Street Journal application, but it’s nothing I can see myself using with any regularity. These are the early days of the platform, however, and many more applications and games are on the way, including support for Hulu, HBO Now, Netflix and others. In conclusion The Gear VR has a serious competitor for best mobile VR platform, and if you’re planning on picking up a Pixel or more Daydream-ready phones are announced soon, the $79.99 peripheral is kind of a no-brainer. Google’s tendrils extending in so many directions gives them a strategic advantage that Oculus, even with Facebook’s support, will likely find hard to counter. You’ll also notice that your phone will heat up to a slightly alarming temperature if you play long session in VR, and Daydream was designed for long, intense gaming and viewing session. I have yet to see an overheating warning, but the phone will get pretty toasty. There are also no options to adjust interpupillary distance or focus the image, but I had no problems seeing clearly even without being able to fine-tune the optics. I’ll be curious to see if anyone else has problems. The View with The Pixel | Jeff Ramos/Polygon Daydream is the platform, View is Google’s own Daydream headset, and Pixel is the only Daydream-ready phone available for the moment. But it’s going to be fascinating to see how the platform evolves and changes as more phones are released and more companies create Daydream headsets. It’s going to be hard to beat the View, however, as Google created something that’s approachable, easy to use and comfortable. I’m looking forward to the release of a few more apps and games, but it’s easy to recommend the View as a must-have add-on for their Pixel.",

      "text": "Published November 10, 2016 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre 0 Email Print \n \nBy Erick Erickson  \nPublished November 10, 2016  | FoxNews.com \nEditor's note: The following column originally appeared on TheResurgent.com. \n\nFor eight years the left has refused to hold itself accountable. Having once declared dissent patriotic, dissent for the last eight years has been homophobic, bigoted, and racist. Conservatives and people of faith have been hounded from their jobs, silenced, and punished for refusing to go along with the left’s agenda. The left demanded cultural homogeneity and is outraged that Americans refuse to go along with their anti-Christian secular agenda.\nOn Tuesday, Americans had enough and decided to seek fundamental change.\nToday, the left is protesting in the streets because of American democratic action. The left accuses Donald Trump of totalitarianism, but it is the left refusing to accept a democratic act. The left blasted Trump for suggesting the election was rigged. But they are okay with protesting a fair election and declaring it illegitimate because they hate the outcome.\nFor eight years I have watched parts of the right descend to madness as they presumed the worst about their opponents. Parts of the right had become convinced that the Clintons kill people and Barack Obama would refuse to vacate the White House. During all this, the left became convinced, by their own rhetorical overreach, that conservatives want to put black people back on plantations, castrate gays, and forcibly impregnate women.\nA week ago the Democratic Party insisted that everyone accept the legitimacy of the election. What we are seeing today is that much of the left think that, like so many other things, it is a one way street.\nWednesday night, their chickens came home to roost. Professional leftwing activists who have no skill other than agitation have trained a large group of people to do nothing but protest. Instead of trying to unite the country, they have flown into hysterics and temper tantrums.\nRead the full story in the Opinion section on FoxNews.com→",

      "title": "2017 Roush F-150 Nitemare comes with 600-horsepower V-8 | News",
      "text": "By Viknesh Vijayenthiran \nPublished November 10, 2016 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 Email Print  (Roush) \nStill disappointed by Ford Motor Company’s [NYSE:F] decision to equip its  2017 F-150 Raptor with a V-6 ?\nDon’t sweat it because there are a handful of reputable tuning shops that offer F-150-based performance pickups packing V-8 grunt.\nAmong them is semi-official Ford tuner Roush, which at last week’s 2016 SEMA show unveiled its 2017 F-150 Nitemare.\nYears ago, Roush teamed up with Ford for a  prior version of the Nitemare F-150 . That one came with a supercharged 5.4-liter V-8 delivering 445 horsepower and 500 pond-feet of torque. For the 2017 F-150 Nitemare, Roush turned to a supercharged 5.0-liter V-8 good for 600 hp and 557 lb-ft of torque.\nCouple the supercar-like output with the lightweight aluminum construction of the latest F-150 and you can imagine just how quick this steed will be. According to Roush, it will hit 60 mph from rest in just 4.2 seconds, making it, the tuner says, the “quickest factory street truck in the world.”\nOther mods include a high-flow exhaust system, a custom grille and front bumper cover, and 20-inch forged wheels with performance rubber. Customers will be able to select two- or four-wheel drive, and for those seeking true off-road capability Roush has  a few mods for that too . For example, one could add a full Fox suspension system and Mickey Thompson tires.\nPricing and availability details are yet to be announced.\nFor more SEMA  coverage, head to Motor Authority's  dedicated hub.",

      "text": " Most parents might take to Facebook to share a child’s first tooth.\nAndrew Brown of Melbourne, Australia, recently stirred hearts by capturing a more somber milestone: his daughter’s last eyelash, still hanging on after four months of intensive cancer treatment.\nCourtesy of Andrew Brown \"I was expecting the usual dozen people to comment and click 'like,' 'heart' or 'sad face,'\" said Andrew Brown of his photo. In June, Hayley Brown, 7, was diagnosed with rhabdomyosarcoma, a soft tissue cancer that caused a two-inch tumor to form in the back of her nasal passage.\nRELATED: Cancer patient transforms chemo into must-see photo shoot\nTo attack the tumor, her treatment included aggressive radiation and chemotherapy as well as several operations. The family has all but lived at the Royal Children’s Hospital in Melbourne since her diagnosis.\nOn July 22, Hayley celebrated her 7th birthday at the hospital.\nMore Moments that matter videos 3:57 Dylan Dreyer gets her last-minute baby questions answered 2:03 How long should you swaddle your baby?

But her long, dark eyelashes — which had been the subject of much family envy — hung on until early October.\n“It was a bit of a heartbreaking moment when we realized they were all going,” said Brown. “When we noticed that one stayed…she fell asleep at the hospital after chemo had finished. I was a little emotional and just wanted to capture a photo of that one eyelash.”\nCourtesy of Andrew Brown Hayley lost her hair after several weeks, but her eyelashes hung on for months. He posted the powerful photo to his Facebook page. “The photo was just an update, really, seeking words of love and encouragement,” he said.\nRELATED: Michael Bublé reveals his 3-year-old son has cancer\nIt soon received 1,500 likes and was picked up by news organizations across the world.\nBrown finds his daughter’s “internet fame” ironic.\n“Hayley is one of the shyest and most introverted people you could ever meet,” he said. “Most of the doctors and nurses still have never heard her voice.\n\"Her sister, on the other hand, has loaded my computer with about 500 selfies,\" he joked.\nCourtesy of Andrew Brown Hayley shares a lighter moment with her 12-year-old sister, Natalie. But while Hayley might be embarrassed to learn of the photo’s reach, it has given Brown and his wife, Leia, the opportunity to connect with kind people around the world.\nMessages have arrived from as far away as Norway, Montreal and Minnesota.\nMeanwhile, Brown said, \"I've never been out of the country.\"\nHe pointed to one in particular that \"reached my wife's heart in seconds.\"\nFacebook Hayley’s tumor has almost completely disappeared. At the time her dad spoke with TODAY, she was still undergoing preventative chemo.\nBrown hopes the prognosis will last — but knows the shift in perspective will.\nCourtesy of Andrew Brown \"Not everything has to be huge to be important,\" said Brown. \"When I am holding my little girl as she falls asleep or screams in pain, (nothing else) in the world comes into my mind.” “A friend sent a message saying that she has been holding her kids just that little bit closer and squeezing a little bit tighter every night when tucking them in,\" he shared. \"I want people to notice the little things.\"\nHe continued, “Love what you have and in the words of the late Dave Grant, a very well-loved and respected comedian here in Australia, ‘Take care of each other, brothers and sisters, that’s what it’s all about.'”\nClosed Captioning ON OFF apply | reset x Text Display Background Enhancements font\nTimes New Roman Arial Comic Sans size\nT T T T color\nshare link Students surprise breast cancer survivor with trip to meet Luke Bryan Play Video - 6:42 Students surprise breast cancer survivor with trip to meet Luke Bryan Play Video - 6:42 More video 2:46 Hoda Kotb spent the weekend in New Orleans at Race for the Cure 1:28 Tearful cancer-fighting mom gets big plaza surprise: Her family AND hero Lynda Carter 6:11 Meet the cancer-fighting mom who channels Wonder Woman during treatment 6:16 Family shares heart wrenching story of 4 women battling cancer",

      "text": "share \nAfter this week's unexpected election of Donald Trump to the presidency, some have pointed to Facebook's enabling of misinformation as one source that fed his success. Now, Facebook is admitting it must try harder to fight the problem. \nIn a statement first provided to TechCrunch , VP of product management Adam Mosseri said Facebook works to combat misinformation, but admitted \"there's so much more we need to do.\" \nThe statement: We take misinformation on Facebook very seriously. We value authentic communication, and hear consistently from those who use Facebook that they prefer not to see misinformation. In Newsfeed we use various signals based on community feedback to determine which posts are likely to contain inaccurate information, and reduce their distribution. In Trending we look at a variety of signals to help make sure the topics being shown are reflective of real-world events, and take additional steps to prevent false or misleading content from appearing. Despite these efforts we understand there’s so much more we need to do, and that is why it’s important that we keep improving our ability to detect misinformation. We’re committed to continuing to work on this issue and improve the experiences on our platform. \nThe issue of fakes news has by now been a longstanding one for Facebook, and one that was exacerbated when the company fired its human editors in favor of algorithmic selection. (The company made that decision after a storm of criticism over whether some employees had suppressed conservative news sources in its Trending Topics section.) In one instance, a completely false story claiming Megyn Kelly secretly supported Hillary Clinton appeared in the Trending Topics section. More problems followed . \nWith a president-elect who has a propensity for the conspiratorial — and who favors a conservative media machine that does as well — Facebook will likely meet increased scrutiny over its place and responsibility in the news ecosystem. \nIn a statement last night , Mark Zuckerberg, while not denouncing Trump, encouraged a \"long term focus\" on issues. \"We are all blessed to have the ability to make the world better, and we have the responsibility to do it,\" he wrote. \"Let's go work even harder.\" In its battle against misinformation, the company is admitting that it has to.

      "title": "13 Freaky Facts About Disney's Tower of Terror Ride",
      "text": "Serena via Flicker // CC BY 2.0 Like us on Facebook \nOn October 31, 1939, five people met their fates when lightning struck the elevator shaft of the Hollywood Tower Hotel. \nAt least, that's what Disney would have you believe. The Twilight Zone Tower of Terror, a drop ride at four Disney theme parks, takes guests on a terrifying trip through time to discover what happened to those unsuspecting passengers in 1939. It has since become a cult hit, even making famous guests like Mariah Carey scream for more. Here are 13 facts about Disney's Tower of Terror. 1. IT COULD HAVE BEEN BASED ON THE WORKS OF STEPHEN KING. \nAfter Disney’s movie-themed MGM Studios opened in 1989, Imagineers made plans to add an attraction that would appeal to fans of horror movies. They kicked around a variety of ideas , including a ride based around Stephen King’s many terrifying tales. Also considered was a faux ghost tour featuring Vincent Price, an amusingly horrifying ride hosted by Mel Brooks, or an actual hotel inside of the park that would have had a haunted theme. 2. CREATING THE RIDE INVOLVED A LOT OF TWILIGHT ZONE RESEARCH. \nKnown for their immersive research, Disney Imagineers watched 156 episodes of The Twilight Zone in order to perfect the ride's aesthetic and tone. Fans of the Rod Serling classic have picked up on the many references to classic episodes, including an appearance from the infamous Talky Tina doll. 3. THERE ARE ALSO SUBTLE DISNEY REFERENCES. \nIn addition to the many nods to The Twilight Zone , there are plenty of sly references to Disney as well. For starters, there’s sheet music in the library titled “What! No Mickey Mouse?” and a Photoplay magazine featuring a four-page spread of Walt Disney-designed caricatures in the lobby. 4. THERE WAS ONCE A SECRET MESSAGE IN ONE OF THE NOTICE BOARDS. \nMichael Gray via Flicker // CC BY 2.0 \nThe spirits at the Hollywood Studios Tower of Terror sometimes try to help guests avoid their fates. Inquisitive guests who peer inside an old notice board in the lobby may find that the fallen letters accumulated at the bottom spell out a warning: “EVIL TOWER UR DOOMED.” The warning has come and gone over the years. 5. GREMLINS DIRECTOR JOE DANTE DIRECTED THE PRE-RIDE VIDEO. \nBefore guests board the ride, they’re taken into a dusty old library, where Rod Serling tells the tale of the tragedy that changed the hotel on October 31, 1939. That’s really Rod Serling, by the way; Imagineers were able to take clips from The Twilight Zone episode “It’s a Good Life” that matched up with the story they wanted to tell. That pre-ride video was directed by Joe Dante, who also directed Gremlins . 6. ROD SERLING'S WIFE CHOSE THE VOICEOVER ARTIST. \nThough it’s Rod Serling’s image in the video, it’s not all his voice. Voice impersonator Mark Silverman’s ability to match Serling’s famous cadence was so impressive that he was chosen for the job by Rod’s widow, Carol Serling. 7. GUESTS DON’T ACTUALLY DROP. \nTower of Terror guests may feel like they're free-falling, but they're not—they’re being pulled . Ride technology pulls the elevator car down faster than gravity, which is what results in that amazing butts-off-the-seat levitation effect. (Don’t forego the seat belts on this one, kids.) 8. THE DROPS ARE RANDOMIZED. \nGuests can't prepare themselves for the exact level of terror they'll experience on the ride. In 2002 , Disney upgraded the Tower of Terror with computer- randomized drop sequences for each individual experience, so riders don't know how many times they'll drop or from what heights. 9. THE EXTERIOR WAS DESIGNED TO BLEND IN WITH MOROCCO. \nThe Florida ride is the second-tallest attraction at the resort, second only to the Expedition Everest roller coaster and the Animal Kingdom. In fact, it's so tall that the upper half of it is visible from Epcot—it can be seen just behind the Morocco pavilion. Because Disney is so invested in making guest experiences completely immersive, they designed the exterior of the fake hotel to blend right into the Morocco skyline. Check it out: 10. OTIS ELEVATORS WAS INVOLVED IN THE RIDE'S CREATION. \nDisney called in the elevator experts to help create the attraction. Otis Elevators has been outfitting buildings across the world since 1853—and with a price tag of $8 million , the Tower of Terror is the company's most expensive sale ever. 11. PART OF THE RIDE IS A SELF-DRIVING CAR. \nIf you’ve been on the Florida version of the ride, you probably recall a moment where the elevator car seems to leave the shaft to take you through a very Twilight Zone- esque \"Fifth Dimension.\" That’s because it does! The car is actually an AGV, or an autonomous-guided vehicle, that moves without tracks or rails. \nIf you don’t mind ruining some of the mystery, you can see exactly how it works on this clip from Modern Marvels : 12. THE VERSION AT DISNEY’S CALIFORNIA ADVENTURE IS GETTING RE-THEMED. Getty \nThe California Adventure version of the Tower of Terror opened on May 5, 2004, 10 years after the Orlando version made its debut. Unless fan petitions manage to get through to the powers that be, the elevator doors at the California Adventure Tower of Terror will close for the last time on January 2, 2017, to make way for a Guardians of the Galaxy makeover . 13. THERE MAY BE A MOVIE ON THE WAY. \nThe Tower of Terror first received a movie treatment in 1997, with a made-for-TV film starring Steve Guttenberg and Kirsten Dunst. \nBut there may be a big-budget revamp in the works as well. Big Fish screenwriter John August turned in a treatment last year , with direction from producer Jim Whitaker. Stay tuned! More from mental_floss...",

      "title": "11 Honorable Ways You Can Help Veterans",
      "text": "Getty Like us on Facebook \nThis Veterans Day, make a difference in the lives of former military members. Just thanking a veteran can go a long way, but an act of kindness means even more. Here are 11 ways you can show vets that you appreciate the sacrifices they made. 1. PICK UP THE TAB FOR THEIR COFFEE OR MEAL. \nThe next time you see a veteran in a restaurant or standing in line for coffee, pick up the tab. You can do so anonymously if you would prefer, but a even a quick \"thank you for your service\" would mean a lot to the veteran. You don’t have to limit yourself to dinner or a latte—you could pay for a tank of gas, a prescription, or a cart of groceries. 2. DRIVE A VET TO A DOCTOR’S APPOINTMENT. \nMany vets, especially those who are infirm or disabled, have trouble making it to their doctor appointments. If you have a driver’s license, you can volunteer for the Department of Veterans Affairs (DAV) Transportation Network, a service provided by all 197 VA medical facilities. To help, contact the hospital service coordinator [ PDF ] at your local VA Hospital. 3. TRAIN A SERVICE DOG. \nService dogs are a great help to veterans with mobile disabilities and post-traumatic stress disorder, helping them rediscover physical and emotional independence. It takes approximately two years and $33,000 to properly train one service dog, so donations and training volunteers are critical. Even if you aren’t equipped to train a dog, some organizations need \" weekend puppy raisers ,\" which help service dogs learn how to socialize, play, and interact with different types of people. \nThere are several organizations that provide this service for veterans, including Patriot Paws and Puppy Jake . 4. REPLACE ONE LIGHT BULB WITH A GREEN ONE. \nThe \" Greenlight a Vet \" project is a simple way to remind yourself and others about the sacrifices veterans have made for our country, and to show your appreciation to them. Simply purchase a green bulb and place it somewhere in your home—a porch lamp is ideal since it’s most visible to others. Nearly 5 million people across the nation have logged their green lights into the project's nationwide map so far. 5. HELP SPONSOR AN HONOR FLIGHT. \nMany of the veterans who fought for our freedoms have never seen the national memorials honoring their efforts—and their fallen friends. Honor Flights helps send veterans of World War II, Korea, and Vietnam to Washington D.C. to see their monuments. You can help sponsor one of those flights for as little as $4. 6. WRITE A LETTER. \nOperation Gratitude is an organization that coordinates care packages, gifts, and letters of thanks to veterans. You can work through them to send your appreciation to a vet, or volunteer to help assemble care packages. And, if you still have candy kicking around from Halloween, Operation Gratitude also mails sweets to deployed troops. They're accepting deliveries until November 15! 7. VOLUNTEER AT A VA HOSPITAL. \nWhatever your talents are, they’ll certainly be utilized at a Veterans Hospital. From working directly with patients to helping with recreational programs or even just providing companionship, your local VA Hospital would be thrilled to have a few hours of your time. 8. GET INVOLVED WITH THE VETERANS ASSISTANCE PROGRAM. \nThere are no doubt veterans in your community that could use help—but how do you find them? Contact the Local Veterans Assistance Program . They’ll be able to put you in touch with local vets who need help doing chores like yard work, housework, grocery shopping, or running errands. 9. HELP THEM WITH JOB TRAINING. \nAdjusting back to civilian life isn't always smooth sailing. Hire Heroes helps vets with interview skills, resumes, and training so they can find a post-military career. They even partner with various employers to host a job board. Through Hire Heroes, you can help veterans with mock interviews, career counseling, job searches, workshops, and more. 10. HELP BUILD A HOUSE. \nBuilding Homes for Heroes builds or modifies homes to suit the needs of veterans injured in Iraq or Afghanistan. The houses are given mortgage-free to veterans and their families. You can volunteer your painting, carpentry, plumbing, wiring, and other skilled services—or you can just donate to the cause. 11. VOLUNTEER FOR A STAND DOWN. \nThe VA continually hosts Stand Downs , one- to three-day events that give much-needed supplies and services to homeless veterans. Vets can receive everything from food and clothing to health screenings, housing solutions, substance abuse treatment, and mental health counseling. They take place at various places across the nation all year long, so contact the representative in your state about when and how you can volunteer. More from mental_floss...",

The \"Warsaw Ghetto Boy\". (photo credit:US HOLOCAUST MEMORIAL MUSEUM) Share on Facebook Share on Twitter \nA neo-Nazi group in Germany posted a map on Facebook containing the addresses and locations of about 70 Jewish institutions and businesses.The list was published by the Berlin-based group on Wednesday on the 78th anniversary of the Kristallnacht pogrom. Be the first to know - Join our Facebook page. Please share this article on Linkedin too Titled “Jews among us,” the list includes synagogues, day care centers, schools, memorials, businesses, restaurants and cemeteries. Its existence was first reported by the German-language Tagesspiegel.The 1938 Kristallnacht pogrom, or “Night of Broken Glass,” against Austrian and German Jews is what many Holocaust historians view as the opening shot in the Nazi-led campaign of violence against the Jews.The post also read: “Today is such a nice day!”All the Jewish establishments on the list were contacted by the group Mobile Counsel against Right-wing Extremism, or MBR, and Green Party lawmaker Volker Beck, who told Tagesspiegel that he was disgusted by the post and said he would stand with the Jewish community.“I see this as an attack against our open society. This is an attack against us all,” Beck said.He said that an initial legal assessment of the post shows that it does not fulfill the requirements for the crime of incitement of hatred.

      "text": "Like Us On Facebook \nJennifer Lawrence is just as stunned as the rest of us, but not into silence. \nAs protesters took to the streets of cities like New York and LA to share their discontent with the impending Trump presidency, J Law penned an essay for Vice’s Broadly urging fellow women to let that discontent fuel their actions over the next four years. \nThe Oscar winner insisted she wants “to be positive” and “support our democracy,” though she reminded readers, \nThis country was founded on immigration and today the only people that feel safe, that their rights are recognized and respected are white men. \nJen admitted she doesn’t have all the answers and shares our fear of the future. \nShe wrote, \nIf you’re a woman and you’re worried that no matter how hard you work or how much you learn, there will always be a glass ceiling, then I don’t really know what to say. I don’t know what I would tell my daughter if I were you. \nRather than looking for a shoulder on which to saddle the blame for the current political climate, though, the “Passengers” star encouraged all women to “have hope” and “work for the future.” \nSpeaking in specifics, the 26-year-old wrote, \nWe mustn’t be defeated. We will keep educating ourselves and working twice as hard as the man next to us because we know now that it is not fair. It is not fair in the workplace, so you make it impossible to fail. And like Hillary, it might not work. But like Hillary, you can still be an inspiration and get important things done. Do not let this defeat you — let this enrage you! Let it motivate you! Let this be the fire you didn’t have before. \nWith a call to people of color, women and members of the LGBTQ+ community to abdicate fear and “be loud,” Jen gave us the hype we need to take action and fight back in real ways that make a difference in our lives and the lives of those similarly affected by the Trump/Pence victory. \nWhether we decide to donate to Planned Parenthood, alter our personal rates of energy consumption to stave off climate change, educate ourselves about the American Muslim experience or get more involved in local elections, a push from Katniss fucking Everdeen only helps us hit the ground running harder and faster.",

The event leading up to the fight between Eddie Alvarez and Conor McGregor had laughter, fan chants, costumes, belt theft, an attempted chair throw, and a walk-off … all in about five minutes. \nFirst, Alvarez walked out on the stage, but found himself out there alone … as McGregor, per usual, was running late. That didn't stop McGregor's fans in attendance from heckling Alvarez, which he seemed to enjoy, and egged them on: Eddie Alvarez gets into it with the Conor fans #ufc205 pic.twitter.com/vOKimyXtCi — Damon Martin (@DamonMartin) November 10, 2016 \nFrom there, though, Alvarez would only wait so long, and after sitting around onstage getting heckled by McGregor fans, decided enough was enough. So he got up and walked offstage, leaving Dana White up there, just kinda hanging. So now Eddie Alvarez has walked out of #ufc205 press conference since McGregor isn't here pic.twitter.com/JXloplBq1X — Les Carpenter (@Lescarpenter) November 10, 2016 \nThen the grand entrance. When McGregor finally did show up, he was wearing a white fur coat and loudly announced to the group that he was \"a [expletive] pimp.\" \nThen we had the chair throw. You can see it go down below: \nThat is one way of entering a fight press conference. This is going to be fun. The fight is happening November 12.

      "text": "Follow CBSDFW.COM: Facebook | Twitter \nBATON ROUGE, La (CBSDFW/AP) – A Louisiana college student has acknowledged she fabricated a report that she was assaulted and robbed of her wallet and Muslim headscarf by two men, one of whom she described as wearing a white “Trump” hat, police said Thursday. \nThe Lafayette Police Department said in a statement that it is no longer investigating the 18-year-old woman’s claims, which were made within hours of Donald Trump’s presidential victory. \nPolice said the student told investigators she was walking near the University of Louisiana at Lafayette’s campus Wednesday morning when she was accosted by two white men who drove up in a gray sedan. Police added the student had claimed the men shouted racial obscenities as they knocked her down and stole her wallet and the headscarf, known as a hijab. \nCharlie Bier, a spokesman for the university, said a federal privacy law prohibits him from saying whether the student could be disciplined. \nIn California, meanwhile, authorities at San Diego State University said they were investigating a reported attack on a Muslim student on campus as a hate crime. The university’s police department said two suspects who assaulted the student on campus Wednesday had targeted her because of her faith and made comments about Trump’s election. \nThe woman was not hurt. Authorities said the assault occurred in a parking complex while the woman was wearing a hijab. The suspects stole her car keys, and the vehicle was later reported missing, authorities said. \nIn a statement, SDSU President Elliot Hirshman denounced the attack, calling hate crimes destructive to the spirit of the campus. \nCalifornia Attorney General Kamala Harris on Thursday issued an information bulletin to law enforcement agencies, outlining laws that prohibit hate crimes. \nEarlier Thursday, President Obama met with Donald Trump in the Oval Office for more than an hour to discuss the transition of power. \nObama said that they had an “excellent” and “wide-ranging” conversation. \nObama said he was encouraged by Trump’s wanting to work with his team on issues facing the country. He said it’s important for all “to now come together.” \n(©2016 CBS Local Media, a division of CBS Radio Inc. All Rights Reserved.

(Photo: Jeff Blake, USA TODAY Sports) \nA year ago at this time, South Carolina athletics director Ray Tanner was knee-deep in a long, pressure-packed coaching search with twists and turns he couldn’t possibly control. And when he finally wound up choosing Will Muschamp on Dec. 6 — 55 days after Steve Spurrier resigned abruptly in the middle of a disastrous 3-9 season — the decision was largely met with snickering from rival SEC fan bases and much of the national media. \nAfter pursuing a handful of others, including Houston’s Tom Herman and Georgia defensive coordinator Kirby Smart, some perceived Muschamp to be a panic move that was made because South Carolina didn’t want to deal with any more rejections. \nBut this weekend, as South Carolina heads to Florida with a 5-4 record, a chance to get bowl eligible and an outside shot to win the SEC East, Tanner might be getting the last laugh. \nWhile it’s true the East’s historic run of mediocrity has opened the door for South Carolina to make quick progress, a win this weekend arguably would make Muschamp the favorite to win SEC Coach of the Year (Non-Saban division, which is another matter altogether). USA TODAY Sports college football staff picks for Week 11 \nAt least in the short term, it appears Tanner may join the long list of athletics directors who didn’t “win the press conference” with their hires but may have found the right guy, a lesson to keep in mind as hiring season begins for this cycle. \n“I never went into it thinking that there would be 100% percent approval on any decisions that were made,” Tanner told USA TODAY Sports this week. “I understand the scrutiny. There was some skepticism going into the process, but I wasn’t affected by that. It was so important we got the right person here.” \nIt was pretty clear by this week that Muschamp had enough of the questions about his return to Florida, where he went 28-21 over four seasons and was informed of his firing the day after a loss, ironically, to South Carolina on Nov. 16, 2014. And it’s hard to blame him. \nIt would be difficult to find any coach anywhere who has been as standup about a professional failure on a major stage as Muschamp, and frankly, it’s an old conversation by now. \nThe more illuminating story line to examine is why Muschamp is working at South Carolina when the conventional wisdom a year ago was that Tanner needed to hire an exciting offensive-minded coach, not an SEC retread with a defensive background who struggled at Florida because of some bad decisions (both in personnel and coaching) on the offensive side of the ball. Bowl projections: Top four remain in playoff while other major bowls shuffle \nSome critics all but counted Muschamp out before his first day on the job, making the illogical leap that because he didn’t work out at Florida there was no way he could do it at a program with fewer advantages. \nTanner knew those slings and arrows would come his way because, like everyone else, he watched what happened in Gainesville. But coaching searches can be as much about the intangibles as the statistics, especially at a place like South Carolina where you’re not going to win no matter what unless you can draw players from Atlanta and North Carolina and compete with Clemson on the small amount of in-state talent. \nUnder the surface of his win-loss record, Tanner saw the fit in both recruiting and how he dealt with off-field issues and responsibilities at Florida, which even Muschamp’s critics would agree was impeccable. \n“I’ve been here a long time and felt like I understood our culture,” said Tanner, who won two national titles with six College World Series appearances as South Carolina’s baseball coach before moving into administration. “I was just so impressed, so comfortable with what he represents and his work ethic, his ability to communicate. I listened to what happened in the past and where he was professionally. I just was so excited about the fit and just felt strongly that our fan base would embrace him and he’d embrace them and we'd have a chance to get this thing going again, and I’m certainly very happy with where we are today.” Under-the-radar college football games in Week 11 \nThe Muschamp hire working out should also raise some questions about the popular theory in college athletics these days that there’s a big advantage to be gained in the search by firing a coach at midseason. \nThough Tanner was able to do some legwork on candidates, the reality is that South Carolina’s searched chang course multiple times after the early focus on Tom Herman and then Kirby Smart, the possibility of which played some role in Georgia’s quick-trigger decision to fire Mark Richt. \nUltimately, as more jobs opened up, South Carolina was no longer in the front of the line, which is simply the reality most athletics directors will face when they go through this process in December. \n“Timing is everything, and things change a long the way,” Tanner said. “I had a little more time to run some things out, but it didn’t necessarily make the process perfect. The thing that was important to us as we went through this is, I never worried about whether I was going to win the press conference.” \nSouth Carolina is just winning games instead. COACHING CAROUSEL CLIPS \nOn the other end of the spectrum, Fresno State was the first school on the board to hire a new coach this cycle by bringing in Jeff Tedford, a name that will win the press conference but should come with significant red flags. \nThe last time he was seen on the sidelines in college football, Tedford had allowed the University of California program to completely collapse both on the field and in the all-important Academic Progress Rate, which forced the school to impose restrictions that could help avoid NCAA penalties. \nThere is little in Tedford’s final six years at Cal to suggest he’s capable of reversing the slide at Fresno State under Tim DeRuyter, which has left the program in a big 1-9 hole this season. The fact is, Tedford had good players at Cal throughout his tenure, including 22 NFL draft picks over his final five seasons in which his teams went a combined 20-25 in the Pac 10/12. (By comparison, Oregon State had 14 draft picks over the same span and went 26-19.) Fresno State names Jeff Tedford head coach \nThere’s a reason Tedford had been floating around the Canadian league and landed this year at Washington in a non-coaching/consultant position without much traction in head coaching searches. \nMoreover, the contract Fresno State gave him — he’ll reportedly make $1.6 million per year, making him the Mountain West’s highest-paid coach — sent shockwaves through the industry given that Fresno State was basically bidding against itself. \nBut given Tedford’s moniker as the winningest coach in Cal football history and his ties to Fresno State as an alum in the early 1980s and assistant coach from 1992-97, he’ll be highly popular for a while. Whether he can restore the Bulldogs to prominence is another matter altogether. Nick Saban says he had no idea that Tuesday was Election Day FAUX PAS OF THE WEEK \nIt’s perfectly understandable for coaches to avoid politics in the aftermath of a heated presidential election. No matter where Nick Saban actually stands politically — and there’s actually been quite a bit of speculation about this over the years given that he has donated in the past to Democrat Joe Manchin’s Senate campaign, as they are childhood friends from West Virginia — anything he might have said about Tuesday’s result would have offended roughly half his fan base and drawn unnecessary media attention. \nBut Saban actually might have outsmarted himself by claiming he “didn’t even know (the election) was happening,” a statement that is so hard to believe it actually ended up as a headline just about everywhere. \nSaban certainly likes to project the image he’s laser-focused on football, and there’s no doubt he structures his life to ensure a minimum amount of distractions. But if you're really so deep in the football bunker that the presidential election got by you this time, that’s not endearing, it’s just weird. — Isaiah Hole (@isaiahhole) November 7, 2016 YOUR WEEKLY HARBAUGH \nYou know Jim Harbaugh has reached cultural icon status when last week’s episode of The Simpsons referenced him. In the brief exchange while Homer Simpson is talking to his wife Marge, he says, “Kirk is like a sports genius who everyone hates.” Marge responds: “Worse than Jim Harbaugh?” \nAccording to the Detroit Free Press , Harbaugh basically took it in stride and said it was one of his favorite shows. \n“People have been making sport of me since I can remember,” Harbaugh said. “My earliest memories, 5, 6, 7, 8, in the schoolyard. People would make sport of me. But it was pretty high class being on The Simpsons .” Blind study: Comparing two College Football Playoff contenders DUD OF THE WEEK \nJust a few years ago, Rice was on a nice little run of success including a Conference USA title in 2013. But things have gone sour on David Bailiff in a hurry, and his program reaches a new low Saturday when it travels to Charlotte as a 10.5-point underdog to Charlotte. In fairness, the 49ers have played some decent football lately and are coming off back-to-back road wins at Marshall and Southern Miss. \nStill, Charlotte is only in its second year of FBS play and fourth season as a program. It went 2-10 last season and shouldn’t be a double-digit favorite over anyone. But at 1-8 and 0-6 in the league, Rice is only one loss away from claiming the title as worst team in the country. \nTOP 10 GAMES IN WEEK 11 Facebook",

(AP) — Veteran North Carolina assistant coach Steve Robinson will not travel with the sixth-ranked Tar Heels for their first two road trips because of a blood clot in his leg. \nCoach Roy Williams made the announcement Thursday, a day after doctors told Robinson not to fly after finding the clot. \nThe Tar Heels open the season Friday night at Tulane, and visit Hawaii on Nov. 18 before playing in the Maui Invitational on Nov. 21-23. Williams says Robinson will be on the bench as usual for the two home games in between, against Chattanooga on Sunday and Long Beach State on Nov. 15. \nRobinson — a former head coach at Tulsa and Florida State — is in his 14th year at UNC and his 22nd year assisting Williams. \n___ \nMore AP college basketball: www.collegebasketball.ap.org \nCopyright 2016 The Associated Press.

      "text": "iStock // Wikimedia Commons Like us on Facebook \nFollowing a traffic accident in 1998, 15-year-old Griselda Servin spent two years in a coma. When she awoke, the Paraguayan was excited to find out that a regional television show, Tell Me a Dream , would be making one of her wishes come true . Servin would have an opportunity to fly to America, which she had always wanted to see, with all expenses paid. \nThere was one condition. Instead of heading for New York City, which she preferred, the show would be sending her to Fremont, Ohio. Servin would be honoring her country by visiting the resting place of its greatest hero—the 19th American president, Rutherford B. Hayes. iStock \nHow Hayes —by most historical accounts, a man who chaired an unremarkable presidency from 1877 to 1881 that was remembered mainly for introducing telephones and Easter Egg rolls to the White House—wound up becoming an icon for a small South American country is remarkable. Not because of the geographical divide, but because Hayes himself might have had virtually nothing to do with it. \nIn 1864, Brazil had tried to intervene in a civil war in Uruguay; Paraguay was worried that this would destabilize the entire region, and ultimately declared war on Brazil, which enlisted Argentina and Uruguay to overtake the Paraguayans. Paraguay was so overwhelmed by the sheer numbers of the opposing soldiers that they began painting sticks to look like guns and putting them in the hands of children wearing fake beards. After six years of bloodshed, the country had seen up to 60 percent of its population killed in combat or dead of disease. \nSensing easy prey, Argentina swooped in to claim Chaco, a desolate slice of land roughly the size of Colorado that made up 60 percent of Paraguay's total territory. Losing it meant Paraguay would be in danger of ceasing to exist. \nIn an attempt to settle the land issue without bloodshed, the countries agreed to arbitration by a neutral third party: the United States. Both submitted reams of documents and testimony arguing why their side should be awarded Chaco. \nOn November 12, 1878, Hayes released a written decision. It read , in part: \n…Be it known that I, Rutherford B. Hayes, President of the United States of America, having duly considered the said statements and the said exhibits, do hereby determine that the said Republic of Paraguay is legally and justly entitled to the said territory between the Pilcomayo and the Verde rivers, and to the Villa Occidentals situated therein… \nAlthough Chaco was and would remain largely destitute and semi-inhabitable—Paraguayans like to refer to it as the “Green Hell” despite a productive cattle ranching industry—it didn’t matter. To them, Hayes had rendered a just decision that offered some ray of hope after a devastating three-pronged attack, one that had left just 29,000 adult males alive—many still with battle wounds. \nOver the next several decades, Paraguay’s reverence for Hayes swelled. It named a state Presidente Hayes, with the town at the mouth of Chaco dubbed Villa Hayes. A museum was erected in his honor; a bust of him greets schoolchildren at Villa Hayes Elementary. The date of his decision, November 12, is a provincial holiday. \nAmid the monuments, soccer teams, and postage stamps honoring him, Paraguayans often express disbelief whenever they're confronted with the idea that Americans don’t spend much time thinking about Hayes. \nRicardo Nuñez, mayor of Villa Hayes, was astonished to be told by a U.S. journalist that Hayes’s contemporaries once referred to him as “Rutherfraud” because his office was preceded by a Constitutional crisis, and he had lost the popular vote. \n“Rutherfraud? Wow!” Nuñez told NPR in 2014. “That’s amazing!” He could not conceive of such a slur. Wikimedia Commons \nGiven Paraguay’s history of malevolent rulers, it’s not surprising that they placed a lot of emotional stock in Hayes, who served just one term and died in 1893. The dictator who antagonized Brazil, General Francisco Solano Lopez, once demanded that his Catholic bishops declare him a saint. If they refused, they were executed. Once he took office, he had his elderly mother flogged in public. \nWhile there’s no record of Hayes ordering the courtyard whipping of his mother, the truth is that no one is quite sure just how much he had to do with the decision to allow Paraguay to keep Chaco. Historians don’t know what criteria was used, or if Hayes simply endorsed the decision made by his staff. It’s likely low-level subordinates pored through paperwork and that Secretary of State William Evarts merely gave the ruling to Hayes for a signature. \nFor a matter that may have occupied just a couple of hours of his life, Hayes has received infinitely more credit for it than for his entire tenure in office. In Delaware, Ohio, his childhood home was torn down to make room for a commercial development. Those wishing to pay a pilgrimage to Hayes’s birthplace will be greeted by a BP gas station with a memorial plaque out in front.  ",

      "text": "Join a chat \nIt’s Facebook, after all, that unceremoniously cut ties with human editors in favor of algorithms. If you thought algorithms were the answer, you were quickly proven wrong. Story after story details their shortcomings as Facebook continues to display false narratives in its own ‘Trending’ section. \nOnce stories end up in Trending, all bets are off — these things get shared like venereal disease at a community college, all under the presumed authority of the Facebook banner. \nFor the tech savvy, Facebook is merely a tool to curate what people are talking about and add your own voice to the conversation. For baby boomers and luddites, however, it’s an authoritative source in which to read the news. Never mind the fact that Facebook isn’t actually producing any of it. \nWorse, the entire site operates in a sort of filter bubble or echo chamber. You’re friends with people who share your interests and, largely, your views. When a Megyn Kelly story appeared in the Trending section, it was quickly shared tens (or hundreds) of thousands across the network. The (now-proven-false) story alleged Kelly was a closet Clinton supporter and that Fox News was none-too-happy about it. . @facebook still has a totally fake story about Megyn Kelly in its trending list. Niiceee pic.twitter.com/n2egP2d92h \n— Justin Green (@JGreenDC) August 29, 2016 \nIt’s not the only time Facebook promoted a false story. \nIf you think that’s dangerous, how about these? The titles below are from websites that litter the web for the sole purpose of attracting cheap clicks through the spread of misinformation. Remember that confirmation bias thing? These are the stories that align with our deepest fears, preconceived notions, and communal beliefs. \nThey’re also completely false. In a world dominated by half-truths, these don’t even bother to go that far. \nIf you’ve been on the internet for more than a day — and to sites you weren’t led to by a social media link — you’ll see right through these. Most, however, won’t. While we take for granted our ability to see through bullshit, it’s a skill many aren’t blessed with. And nowhere is that more apparent than on Facebook. \nThere’s a side of correlation to go with this causation too. \nTrump voters, according to polling data, tended to trend older and less educated than Clinton supporters. I hope I’m not being too controversial in saying younger people tend to be more computer savvy than older generations. And controversial or not, it should go without saying more education leads to a better filter for bullshit and misinformation. \nSo, in essence we have a social network known for doing little to stop the spread of misinformation and a userbase known for eating every word of it. It’s ironic, really, that this is typically the same segment of the population that blames media for their distrust of the political process yet digest news from alternative sites who are no more credible as an information source than Dr. Phil is as a doctor. Maybe they mean social media. \nAs Verge editor Casey Newton pointed out: Everything I read for 18 months depicted Trump as a dangerous psychopath but tell me more about how this is the media’s fault \n— Casey Newton (@CaseyNewton) November 9, 2016 \nHe’s not wrong. The media vilified Trump to near-epic proportions, and rightfully so. This was the same candidate, after all, that mocked a disabled reporter, proposed a registration process for Muslims in the US (and a ban on future muslim immigration), disrespected a POW on television, and was accused of sexual assault by at least 19 women. \nNo matter where you stand on policy, it’s hard to argue that Trump warranted the media cutting him some slack. \nFor what it’s worth, Facebook today promised to start ‘doing more’ to stop the spread of misinformation. According to VP of product management at Facebook Adam Mosseri in a comment to TechCrunch : \nIn Trending we look at a variety of signals to help make sure the topics being shown are reflective of real-world events, and take additional steps to prevent false or misleading content from appearing. \nDespite these efforts we understand there’s so much more we need to do, and that is why it’s important that we keep improving our ability to detect misinformation. We’re committed to continuing to work on this issue and improve the experiences on our platform. \nIf that sounds like rather vague language from the propaganda machine, I couldn’t fault you for thinking that. \nIn fairness, Facebook has a difficult task at hand, and one it as committed to tackling on multiple occasions. \nThat’s really where the good will ends. Since committing to stop the spread of misinformation, Facebook has made few public changes that back up the promise. Well, unless you can make the argument that firing the only human eyes available to verify stories on Trending was a step in the right direction — I wouldn’t.",

      "text": "Mark Zuckerberg doesn't believe that Facebook, the largest social network on planet Earth and a major news platform, could have influenced the outcome of the presidential election.\n\"Personally I think the idea that fake news on Facebook, which is a very small amount of the content, influenced the election in any way, I think is a pretty crazy idea,\" the Facebook CEO reportedly said Thursday night at the Techonomy conference in Half Moon Bay, California. \"Voters make decisions based on their lived experience.\" \nWowza.\nSEE ALSO: Facebook pledges to clear News Feed of misinformation, again \nFacebook has come under fire this year for allowing the proliferation of misleading information in its News Feed, where a tremendous number of people receive information every day — 1.18 billion people, according to the social network's own numbers . \nOthers at the organization are taking the company's responsibility to its users seriously. Earlier Thursday, a Facebook vice president stated that the company will work to combat hoaxes.\n\"We value authentic communication, and hear consistently from those who use Facebook that they prefer not to see misinformation,\" Adam Mosseri, Facebook VP of product management, said.\nThe company has made similar statements at least four other times in the past two years .\nBut Zuckerberg, who's been dismissive about his company's role in the media business in the past, apparently doesn't believe that his vast userbase actually cares about the content they consume on Facebook. While it's obviously impossible to define how exposure to certain articles, video or photographs impacts an individual's life, it's downright cynical to suggest it all has zero effect. If that was true, none of us would care about opening that blue app every single day.\nBesides, recent findings from the Pew Research Center actually indicate that 20 percent of Americans have changed their views on an issue because of something they've seen on social media. And while Zuckerberg said fake news is \"a very small amount of the content\" shared on Facebook, Mashable found Wednesday that just one bogus article about Hillary Clinton was potentially distributed to over 2 million people. \n\"Why would you think there would be fake news on one side and not on the other?\", Zuckerberg asks. Here's evidence: https://t.co/zAJGw5dmre \n— Will Oremus (@WillOremus) November 11, 2016 \nPlenty more bogus news stories — often supporting right-wing viewpoints — were distributed on Facebook this year, and one might imagine they had an effect on some people given that such is the very essence of reading information. \nBack to the work of figuring this problem out , Facebook.",

      "text": "I didn't know Leonard Cohen — of course I didn't. But his loss is profound to me, as it is for so many, because I felt like I did.\nHis music affected into me so throughly that I couldn't imagine a dark moment where his words, whether I wanted company or not, reminded me I wasn't alone.\nSEE ALSO: Leonard Cohen, singer-songwriter, artist and poet, dead at 82\nAnd then he became an unlikely public figure that I felt like I got to know through his Facebook page. I don't know how much Cohen himself (or his family) had to do with it, but the page's updates felt like the sort of thing you'd get from a relative.\nPictures of youth. Grainy cell phone shots. A man whose verses are etched into my brain as the paragon of elegance and sorrow trying to fix his car's engine and bending down to fix his shoes. Cohen's sense of humor was always in tact.\nIt's not the aspirational stuff we expect from our icons. It was just moments of the life of a man who helped us laugh and cry and laugh and cry about it all again.",

      "text": "Mark Zuckerberg said he doesn't think fake news on Facebook had an effect on the election. Photo by Paul Sakuma for Techonomy \nAfter Donald Trump won the US presidential election on Tuesday, there were some commentators who argued fake news circulating on Facebook helped him win. \nThere was, for example, this story from the nonexistent Denver Guardian about an FBI agent associated with Hillary Clinton 's email leaks being found dead in a murder suicide. Or this one about the Pope endorsing Trump. \nEven President Barack Obama called out Facebook by name on Monday, the day before the election. \"As long as it's on Facebook, and people can see it, as long as it's on social media, people start believing it,\" Obama said at a Michigan rally . \"And it creates this dust cloud of nonsense.\" \nMark Zuckerberg doesn't buy that fake stories played a role in the election outcome. \n\"Personally, I think the idea that fake news on Facebook -- it's a very small amount of the content -- to think it influenced the election in any way is a pretty crazy idea,\" Facebook's CEO said during an interview Thursday at the Techonomy conference in Half Moon Bay, California. \nInstead, he thinks some people are shocked and still trying to understand the results of the election. \n\"It takes a profound lack of empathy to think that someone voted some way because of a fake news story,\" Zuckerberg said. \nThe discussion comes, of course, two days after the presidential election in the United States. Trump won the office in an upset victory, which blindsided many people -- including pollsters and pundits -- who believed Clinton, the Democratic nominee, would become the next president. \nFacebook, with its 1.79 billion users, has a major responsibility on its hands as more people look to the social network to get their news. More than 40 percent of American adults get their news from Facebook, according to the Pew Research Center and Knight Foundation. \nEarlier on Thursday, Adam Mosseri, vice president of product management at Facebook, said in a statement that \"there's so much more we need to do,\" to fight the spread of misinformation on the social network. \nIn the aftermath of the election, some have also been blaming Facebook for how shocking the result was, arguing that the social network promotes tunnel vision because people are supposedly only exposed to viewpoints aligned with their own. After all, your Facebook feed is made up of posts from only people you choose to populate it. So, the argument goes, there's a Facebook that liberals see and one that conservatives see, depending on the political views of your friends on the site. \nPlus, Facebook has an algorithm that decides exactly what you see on your News Feed. Generally, it learns from what you've clicked on or Liked in the past, as well as other signals, and shows you more of what fits your interests. \nEven though the algorithm learns from your cues, Facebook still has an awesome amount of power to potentially shape someone's worldview. Zuckerberg denied that Facebook is an echo chamber. He argued that Facebook actually exposes you to more viewpoints, because everyone has at least a small number of friends who hold opposing opinions. \nZuckerberg emphasized that Facebook does show people stories they may not agree with, but that sometimes people just tune them out. \n\"It's not that the diverse information isn't there,\" he said. \"We haven't gotten people to engage with it in higher proportions.\" \nThis isn't the first time Facebook has been scrutinized for what it does or doesn't show us. The social network drew ire earlier this year after reports claimed Facebook encouraged its editorial contractors to suppress conservative news in its \"trending stories\" feature. Soon after that, the feature was redesigned to be more robotic, without human-written descriptions or curation. \nZuckerberg was also asked about his thoughts on the election results in general. In the past, he's been critical of Trump. In April, he took a thinly-veiled shot at then-candidate Trump onstage at F8, Facebook's most important conference of the year. Without referring to Trump by name, he talked about the dangers of \"building walls,\" a nod to Trump's campaign promise to build a wall along the Mexican-American border. \nTrump has previously attacked Zuckerberg , too, calling the tech CEO's push for more-open immigration through his public interest group Fwd.us a bad move for American workers. \nOn Thursday, Zuckerberg was more diplomatic. \"Well we have a lot of work to do,\" he said. \"But that would have been true either way.\"",

      "text": "Share on Facebook \n  Officer Mark Zuckerberg rejected   the social network influenced the U.S. presidential election and said echo-chambers aren't really a problem on the site. \nThe company co-founder was responding to criticism following Donald Trump's victory in the elections, from people who argued the company allowed false information to run rampant on its site and that its algorithm tended to amplify the voices people wanted to hear, instead of providing a full picture of what was going on. \nZuckerberg, speaking at the Technonomy   California, said the company certainly has work to do to improve the news feed, but said false stories were a small portion of the content shared. Mark Zuckerberg speaks during a session at the Techonomy 2016 conference on Nov. 10. Photographer: David Paul Morris/Bloomberg \n\"That it influenced   idea,\" he said. People vote based on their life experiences, and anyone who thinks fake news contributed to the outcome betrays a \"profound lack of empathy\" for Trump's camp, he said. \nFacebook has constantly studied the effect of its news feed. Zuckerberg says the idea that it shields people from diverse opinions is a misconception -- a particularly difficult theory for him to quash. \n\"All of the research we have suggests that this hasn't really been a problem,'' Zuckerberg said. People tend to have some friends with diverse opinions, but Facebook's research shows people tend to ignore their posts. \"The biggest filter in the system is not that the content isn't there, but just that you don't click on it.\" \nZuckerberg said the balance it takes to improve Facebook's news feed has always been difficult. Earlier this year, the company faced criticism from conservatives after reports of bias in its trending topics section. The company met with conservative leaders and later cut the editorial employees working on the feature, choosing instead to leave ranking decisions to algorithms. \n\"As norms change and as people want to see more news, we will have to continue to evolve the guidelines to reflect the values that the community holds,\" Zuckerberg said. \"It's tough to make everyone happy, but we care, and we care about learning quickly and making this better and better and better.\" \nWhen asked about the election result, Zuckerberg said that the country would have a lot of work to do either way. \n\"One thing that I think it's easy to lose track of is, most progress is made by private citizens,\" not the government, he said. \"That progress will continue.\" Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

      "title": "Mark Zuckerberg Says Fake News On Facebook Didn’t Change The Election",
      "text": "View this image ›\nPaul Sakuma for Techonomy\nID: 9964531 Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg Thursday rejected charges that the social network’s promotion of false pro-Trump news articles could have affected the outcome of the presidential election.\n“I think the idea that fake news on Facebook — of which it’s a very small amount of the content — influenced the election in any way is a pretty crazy idea,” he said.\nIn the months leading up to November 8, fake news traveled far and wide on Facebook . Its algorithm-driven Trending feature repeatedly promoted untrue stories. Hyperpartisan political pages racked up hundreds of thousands of comments and likes on sensational and misleading stories about Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. And many of those viral claims were made by Macedonian teens who profited handsomely by gaming the social network, as BuzzFeed News has found .\nZuckerberg was speaking onstage at Techonomy, a science, business, and technology conference held on Thursday, two days after Election Day. It was held at the Ritz-Carlton Hotel in Half Moon Bay, a picturesque seaside town between San Francisco and Silicon Valley, where many liberal-minded tech executives and employees were still coming to grips with the fact that America had voted to send Trump to the White House.\n“Part of what I think is going on here is people are trying to understand the results of the election,” he said. “I think there is a certain profound lack of empathy in asserting that the only reason why someone could have voted the way they did is because they saw some fake news.”\nZuckerberg noted that hoaxes aren’t a brand-new phenomenon, either. “There have been hoaxes on the internet, there were hoaxes before,” he said. “We do our best to make it so that people can report that, and as I said before, we can show people the most meaningful content we can.”\nHe added, “Voters make decisions based on their lived experience. One part of this that I think is important is we really believe in people. You don’t generally go wrong when you trust people that understand what they care about and what’s important to them, and you build systems that reflect it.”\nThe CEO also argued that, compared to traditional media, Facebook’s newsfeed exposes people to a variety of opinions — and is not an echo chamber, as many have criticized the social network of being.\n“The media diversity and diversity of information that you’re getting through a social system like Facebook is going to be inherently more diverse than what you would have gotten from watching one of three news stations and sticking with that and having that be your newspaper or your TV station 20 years ago,” he said.\nEarlier in the day, a Facebook spokesperson had told BuzzFeed News: “While Facebook played a part in this election, it was just one of many ways people received their information – and was one of the many ways people connected with their leaders, engaged in the political process and shared their views.”",

      "text": "Tech News Zuckerberg sure fake news on Facebook didn't sway election \"The idea that fake news on Facebook, which is a very small amount of the content, influenced the election in any way I think is a pretty crazy idea,\" Zuckerberg says Published 1:32 PM, November 11, 2016 Updated 1:32 PM, November 11, 2016 IN FOCUS. This file photo taken on October 28, 2015 shows Facebook chief executive and founder Mark Zuckerberg speaking during a 'town-hall' meeting at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) in New Delhi. Photo by Money Sharma/AFP \nSAN FRANCISCO, USA – Facebook chief Mark Zuckerberg on Thursday rejected the idea that bogus stories shared at the social network paved a path of victory for President-elect Donald Trump. \n\"The idea that fake news on Facebook, which is a very small amount of the content, influenced the election in any way I think is a pretty crazy idea,\" Zuckerberg said during an on-stage chat at a Technonomy technology trends conference in California. \nThe Facebook co-founder rhetorically asked why people would think there would be hoax stories about one candidate but not the other. \nHe also dismissed worries about Facebook users existing in \"bubbles\" where they only see news or perspectives echoing their viewpoints. \n\"Voters make decisions based on their lived experience,\" Zuckerberg said. \n\"You don't generally go wrong when you trust that people understand what they care about and what's important to them and you build systems that reflect that.\" \nHe added that research gathered at Facebook suggests news-filter bubbles are not a problem. \nThe social network found that while people may have a lot of friends very much like themselves, almost everyone at Facebook has someone in their mix who breaks the mold in some way, such as religion, ethnicity, or background. \nHowever, Zuckerberg added, Facebook has also found that people are less inclined to click on links or otherwise check out shared stories that don't line up with their views. \n\"We just tune out,\" Zuckerberg said of the pattern. \"I don't know what to do about that.\" \nWhile acknowledging the importance of the election, he advised maintaining faith that most progress in innovation is made by private citizens, typically without help from the government. \n\"These elections make a real difference in the world, but it would not be right to suggest that it changes the fundamental arc of technology or progress over time,\" Zuckerberg said. \nThe News Feed at Facebook has evolved from early days of being about sharing personal tidbits with friends or family to becoming a platform for important news. \nFacebook continues to adapt to that shift, modifying the way it ranks stories as well as the community guidelines regarding what might be offensive, according to Zuckerberg. \nHe conceded there was a lot that could be improved and that the process was ongoing, but contended it was misguided to put blame on Facebook. \n\"I do think there is a certain profound lack of empathy in asserting that the only reason someone could have voted the way they did is because they saw some fake news,\" Zuckerberg said. \n\"If you believe that, then I don't think you have internalized the message that Trump supporters are trying to send in this election.\" – Rappler.com HOW DOES THIS STORY MAKE YOU FEEL?

      "text": "Facebook buys passwords off the black market to make your account more secure Facebook buys passwords off the black market to make your account more secure The company cross references passwords with those bought off the black market, to ensure users don't choose vulnerable passwords. 19999 \nFacebook Chief Security Officer Alex Stamos has revealed that the company buys passwords that are sold on the black market by hackers. He added that the company cross references stolen passwords with encrypted passwords on the platform, to ensure that Facebook users do not use them for their accounts. \nSpeaking at the Web Summit in Lisbon, Stamos stated that, “Keeping Facebook safe and keeping it secure are two different things.”“Security is about building walls to keep out threats and shore up defences,” but safety is bigger than that said Stamos. “It turns out that we can build perfectly secure software and yet people can still get hurt,” he observed. \n\"Usernames and passwords are an idea that come out of 1970s mainframe architectures....they were not built for 2016,\" said Stamos. \"The reuse of passwords is the No. 1 cause of harm on the internet,\" the CSO noted. \nIt has been observed that many of the stolen passwords are quite similar. For instance, passwords such as \"123456\" and other such consecutive numbers are especially weak. If users use similar passwords, their accounts become prone to more security threats. \nStamos stated that although the process was \"computationally heavy\" and time consuming, it ensures that Facebook users are alerted when their passwords are not strong enough. Facebook employs a variety of tools and methods to ensure maximum security , which range from two-factor authentication to identification of faces of friends. The company also applies machine learning algorithms to find out if any activity on your account is fraudulent. Another concept presently being developed is to allow close friends of users to verify account recovery request, in case the account is hacked. \n\"Even though we provide these options, it is our responsibility to think about those people that choose not to use them,\" Stamos concluded.

      "text": "A lot of questions are emerging about Facebook’s role in this year’s election cycle, especially given the proliferation of sensationalistic and even outright fake news stories, and CEO Mark Zuckerberg has responded.\n\"I think the idea that fake news on Facebook--of which it's a very small amount of the content--influenced the election in any way is a pretty crazy idea,\" he said on Thursday at the Techonomy conference in Half Moon Bay, Calif., just two days after Donald Trump was elected president, according to media reports .\n\"There have been hoaxes on the Internet, there were hoaxes before,\" he said. \"We do our best to make it so that people can report that, and as I said before, we can show people the most meaningful content we can.\"\nGet Data Sheet , Fortune's technology newsletter. \nTrump’s victory in the U.S. presidential election stunned many, including polling analysts and the media. Since then, many questions about the role of social media--and mass media at large--have been swirling.\nFacebook fb , in particular, has grown into a powerful tool for sharing information and news articles--or what looks like news articles. In a recent report, BuzzFeed detailed how a slew of teens in Macedonia have been creating entire operations of pushing fake, but very dramatic, news onto the social network, which uses algorithms to decide what each user sees in their News Feeds.\nThus, the argument is that services like Facebook are enabling the viral spread of these faux news articles, and some are asking whether it may have had a significant effect on the election’s outcome. Read more in Fortune ‘s Mathew Ingram’s take on why Facebook is partly to blame here .\n\"Part of what I think is going on here is people are trying to understand the results of the election,\" Zuckerberg said. \"I think there is a certain profound lack of empathy in asserting that the only reason why someone could have voted the way they did is because they saw some fake news.”\nOf course, Facebook is sticking to its guns. The social network giant has vehemently denied that it’s a media company, insisting that it’s merely an open technology platform enabling people to connect with each other and share information.\nFacebook also argues that its users are exposed to a variety of viewpoints through the service, despite criticism that it’s an echo chamber for each user to have their viewpoints reinforced over and over again. But even Zuckerberg has acknowledged that people don't tend to click on articles promoting viewpoints different from their own, which only supports the idea of an online echo chamber. And therefore, fewer of those tend to show up in your News Feed.\nFor more on Facebook, watch Fortune’s video: \n\nThat’s also where Zuckerberg is both right and wrong. Fake news articles did play a role, but in reaffirming or confirming what people want to believe; probably not so much in swaying most users’ pre-existing beliefs to the point that they entirely changed their minds.\nWith that said, Zuckerberg’s comments shouldn’t be surprising at all. Even if the company has come to believe its News Feed has had some effect, why would it possibly want to acknowledge that in public?\nDoing so would only open the door even louder to calls for Facebook to start regulating the information on its network, and the company has no interest in getting into that messy game. Even when it tried to hire young employees to flag popular news items and write short descriptions of the stories, it was quickly confronted with accusations of bias against right-wing media , and dismantled the entire operation to replace it with algorithms.\nEditorial judgement is difficult and carries risks--just ask any member of the media.",

      "text": "People who believe fake news on Facebook influenced the US presidential election are showing a “profound lack of empathy” and are believing in a “pretty crazy idea,” says Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg.\nHe made the remarks on Nov. 10 in an on-stage interview at the Techonomy conference in California with former Fortune journalist David Kirkpatrick.\n“Personally, I think the idea that fake news on Facebook, of which it’s a very small amount of the content, influenced the election in any way, I think is a pretty crazy idea. Voters make decisions based on their lived experience,” Zuckerberg said.\nHe added:\n“Part of what I think is going on here is people are trying to understand the result of the election, but I do think there is a certain profound lack of empathy in asserting the only way someone could have voted the way they did is because they saw some fake news. If you believe that, then I don’t think you have internalized the message that Trump supporters are trying to send in this election.”\nZuckerberg argued that supporters of both candidates could generate fake news, so it wasn’t clear why it would specifically benefit Trump’s campaign. “The quickest way to refute that this surely had no impact, is why would you think there’s fake news on one side and not the other. We study this, we know this is a small volume,” he said.\nZuckerberg defended his platform’s News Feed algorithm, claiming that it already provides users a diversity of information. The problem is that users don’t click on items with different viewpoints from their own, he said, seeming to reference a 2015 peer-reviewed study by Facebook data scientists.\nThat study had several problems, including using a sample of Facebook users who identified their political ideology, which isn’t representative of the average user, as University of North Carolina professor Zeynep Tufekci has written .\nThroughout the interview, Zuckerberg downplayed Facebook’s role as a gatekeeper of news, saying that his platform merely reflected users’ wishes. Nevertheless, Facebook issued a statement yesterday saying it was working on its ability to detect “misinformation” in its news feed and in its Trending section, which highlights topics users are discussing on the platform.\nDespite Zuckerberg’s protestations, Facebook already has a powerful toolkit to deal with fake news. In August, it announced that it was clamping down on clickbait articles with a system that worked like an email spam filter. Zuckerberg said the measures have “dramatically improved” the quality of the News Feed.\nPerhaps if those tools had been adapted for the flood of “hyperpartisan” Facebook pages churning out questionable material during campaign season, voters would have had to contend with less noise when they were making their decision at the ballot box.",

      "text": "T he Facebook updates from friends in America are a chilling instruction about the world we live in now. Black friends reporting racist street abuse. Trans friends stockpiling treatment medicine before Trump ends the Affordable Care Act. The young women seeking out 10-year IUDs, concerned about impending restrictions on birth control and desperate to head off more desperate, punishable future choices.\nI spend a lot of time being harassed on the internet but I’ve never seen the volume of hateful garbage that’s appeared on my Twitter feed in the past two days. It’s humanity’s worst values, emboldened with thunder.\nAmerica has to face the immediate consequences of its electoral choices. In Australia, we still have the privilege of being able to face the cause. While Facebook discussions dissolve into furious flurries of finger-pointing symptomatic of feeling powerless, terrified and enraged, a calm reminder deserves heeding: “intersectionality” is a word that not only explains that there are complex factors that inform how people are oppressed, but also how others come to oppress them.\nIt was the Democrats' embrace of neoliberalism that won it for Trump | Naomi Klein Read more\nAustralians appreciate the overt racism and sexism of Trump’s message that inspired the overwhelmingly white, male electorate who voted for him; the KKK isn’t marching the streets of North Carolina because it’s excited about his tax plan. How bragging about sexual assault was forgiven by an electorate moved to explosive passion over fewer emails deleted by a candidate than by George W Bush is but one neat example of an ongoing sexist double standard.\nBut the significant number of white women, and the smaller but just as crucial number of Hispanic Americans who voted Trump into office, contribute their numbers to the nuanced and difficult story of Trump’s appeal to an American middle and working class displaced and enraged by 35 years of market-first-people-last economic policy.\nI wrote an article about the economic anxiety of working Americans when I was in the US earlier this year. Those stories of low pay, poor conditions and very few labour protections don’t affect every individual who voted for Trump, but they are depredations visible everywhere in America, an omnipresence that reminds any American without independent wealth how insecure their conditions are.\nIn Ken Burns’ extraordinary documentary series about the American Civil War, the point is made that the majority of Confederate soldiers fighting to maintain slavery weren’t slave owners themselves, but gave their loyalty and their lives to the Southern Cause in a willingness to defend the meagre status advantage that another people’s legalised oppression provided them. It’s impossible to witness Trump voters scream hate at women, LGBTQIA+ people, black and Hispanic Americans, people with disabilities and other minorities without remembering this.\nBut Australians have greater means at our disposal to protect our community from the ravages of Trumpism than the experiences of our English-speaking, Brexit-voting British cousins and now our American ones suggest. The words “we need to speak to the working class!” are ringing out throughout the left’s US election postmortem . Well, there’s one thing better than speaking to the working class, and that’s participating in it: join a union.\nAustralian unions are the difference that gives the nation’s workforce a comparative comfort that our counterparts in America and Britain don’t have. While America’s Reagan and Britain’s Thatcher were smashing the organised working class in the 1980s, ours not only held on, but Bob Hawke, a former union leader no less, was installed as the prime minister of this country. While their wages were driven down with drivel about “competitiveness”, Australian unions demanded and delivered the award wage system which doesn’t exist in either of those other countries.\nCollective bargaining through unions delivered the penalty rates, casual loading and higher minimum wages that Americans and the British have not had. And for all of this country’s struggles with racism, sexism and other forms of marginalisation, we have an opportunity to fight not only neoliberalism’s misery, but also its populist, fascist non-alternative. It should be obvious: economic misery foments conditions that agglomerate hate.\nAustralian unions campaign for and defend the Medicare system America does not have. Australian unions fight battles against privatisation and keep the gates of quality public education open. They have fought for equal pay, for equal opportunity and for workplace equity, all of which underpin our country’s fundamental belief in its own egalitarianism.\nDemocrats once represented the working class. Not any more | Robert Reich Read more\nAll of these things have, of course, been under attack from neoliberalism’s advocates – if you’re still scratching your head as to why the Coalition has been trying to smash the CFMEU with the ABCC legislation for four long bitter years, now is the time to make the link: when politicians are unconcerned by inequalities, strong unions provide the bulwark against exploitation and greed.\nThe reason the World Economic Forum reported only 17% of Australians would be tempted to vote for Trump is that the miserable economic conditions that fomented his electoral rage response have not yet – yet – materialised here. If you don’t want it to go any higher, if you want to avoid the American nightmare, there is an alternative to hate. It is solidarity.",

(Photo: Jason Connolly, AFP/Getty Images) \nDonald Trump did what so many couldn't have fathomed — he won the 2016 presidential election. \nHis campaign was riddled with xenophobic language, allegations of sexual assault, insults against a Gold Star family, shocking tapes and racist rhetoric. And now that candidate Trump is President-elect Trump, hundreds are protesting his presidency, and hateful speech and graffiti have popped up in cities and on college campuses across the country. \nBut during his campaign, Trump also managed to tap into a sense of anger and disenfranchisement felt by some working-class Americans. He came across as relatable to a certain faction of the public. \nWhat's next? After a campaign that was rocked by scandal and division, can Trump bring the change to Washington that his supporters hope? Or will his personal baggage perpetuate the same partisanship that has always plagued Beltway politics? Can he help Americans reach across divisions to unify the country? \nReaders, Millennials and Eileen Rivers, Jill Lawrence and David Mastio of USA TODAY's Editorial Board discuss in the podcast below.

REUTERS/Mike Segar What is this? \nSponsored content is written by Global News' editorial staff without any editorial influence by the sponsor. If you'd like to learn more... X What is this? \nSponsored content is written by Global News' without any editorial influence by the sponsor. If you'd like to learn more... - Story continues below \nCould his win be attributed to Hillary Clinton’s alleged lack of popularity among voters or the FBI’s last-minute investigation into additional emails linked to her private server ? Did his repeated promises of change rally enough support from those tired of an eight-year Democratic administration? \nREAD MORE: Donald Trump arrives at White House to meet with Barack Obama as transition of power begins \nOr was Facebook to blame? \nOver the last 24 hours, several media outlets have published opinion pieces accusing the social network of aiding Trump’s campaign, including Forbes , New York Magazine and Mashable . \nAt the helm of their argument is Facebook’s news feed – the backbone on which the social network operates, or, as Mashable described it “a tangled mess of bizarre falsehoods and outdated information used as ammo to help people scream at one another.” \nWATCH: Donald Trump’s rocky relationship with the media No good news feed \nHere is something Facebook users should already know – your news feed is curated by an algorithm to show you status updates, comments, news stories and advertisements it thinks you will like based on what content you have previously interacted with. \nThat means you’re shown content you are likely to agree with, both politically and otherwise, before you see a differing opinion. \n“Spoon-feeding us information that reinforces our existing opinions, damages our ability as humans to think rationally, and to consider an opposing point of view,” read a Forbes’ article. \nFacebook has long refused to call itself a “media company,” insisting that it’s a tech company that simply aggregates content. \nREAD MORE: Facebook is trying to make your News Feed more relevant \nBut Forbes , New York Magazine and Mashable ’s articles all argue that Facebook’s stance is dangerous because it isn’t held to editorial standards that force it to present opposing ideas and comments with equal weight. \n“Endless reports of corruption, venality, misogyny, and incompetence merely settle in a Facebook feed next to a hundred other articles from pro-Trump sources (if they settle into a Trump supporter’s feed at all),” read the New York Magazine article. \nREAD MORE: Facebook denies censoring conservative content \nThe social networking company denied the allegations, noting that there are “rigorous guidelines in place for the review team to ensure consistency and neutrality,” adding that the guidelines don’t permit political perspectives to be suppressed or one viewpoint or outlet to be prioritized over another. \nThe “Trending” sidebar – which previously included a description of why the topic was trending – was later redesigned to only show the person, place, or thing that was trending. President-elect Donald Trump calls for unity in his victory speech Donald Trump supporters chant ‘USA, USA’ after Florida victory Fake ‘news’ stories going viral \nBut Facebook is also coming under fire for allowing fake news websites and blogs that masquerade as legitimate sources to be featured next to articles from legitimate news sources. \n“The most obvious way in which Facebook enabled a Trump victory has been its inability (or refusal) to address the problem of hoax or fake news,” said New York Magazine. \nREAD MORE: Donald Trump election win causes political, economic uncertainty around the globe \n“All throughout the election, these fake stories, sometimes papered over with flimsy ‘parody site’ disclosures somewhere in small type, circulated throughout Facebook: The Pope endorses Trump. Hillary Clinton bought $137 million in illegal arms. The Clintons bought a $200 million house in the Maldives. Many got hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of shares, likes, and comments.” \nA Buzzfeed investigation, published just days before the election , found that a group of Macedonian teens was responsible for dozens of these articles, many of which were written in favour of Trump. Yes, people are readily believing the completely fake story of an FBI agent who leaked Clinton documents being murdered. pic.twitter.com/dbqF7kVmol \n— Sam (@FuriousCarterII) November 6, 2016 \nWhether these articles were created to influence voters, or simply to make a profit from their ad-ridden websites, is unclear. However, these media outlets feel Facebook should be held accountable to better identify or remove fake news stories and websites. \nFacebook has been working to rid its platform of so-called “click bait” using an algorithm that identifies phrases commonly used in these stories, including things like “… you won’t believe what happens next.” \nIt will also consider items “clickbait” if a headline exaggerates information or is misleading. Is it fair to blame Facebook? \nRobert Steiner, director of the fellowship in global journalism at the University of Toronto’s Munk School of Global Affairs, said that while Facebook should better address the issue of fake news stories, he noted that Facebook shouldn’t be seen as the enemy. \n“Facebook is a genie and the genie is out of the bottle, so we have to find ways to work with that,” Steiner told Global News, noting that Facebook serves as a massive distribution platform for all journalism outlets – not to mention, one that makes them money. \nREAD MORE: What President Donald Trump will mean for Canada \n“I think Facebook has shown an interest and willingness to work with journalists – we have to engage with it, not demonize it.” \nSteiner said the 2016 presidential election, in many ways, was an experiment for how social media works, thanks to Trump and Clinton having a global audience at their fingertips. \nWhile he neither agrees nor disagrees with the media coverage surrounding Facebook, he noted that the platform will continue to play a massive role in people’s lives and how media companies share their content. In other words, we have to learn to get along. \n“People of America knew who they were voting for [Trump], but they did it anyway. The same way that people know cigarettes are bad for them, but they smoke anyway,” he said. © 2016 Global News, a division of Corus Entertainment Inc. ",

      "text": "Apple, Amazon, Facebook fall as technology antipathy continues Disney advances as investors focus on forecast over earnings Share on Facebook \nU.S. stock-index futures fell, indicating the S&P 500 Index will halt a four-day winning streak, as investors continue to parse the implications of a Donald Trump presidency for the economy and interest rates. \nS&P 500 Index contracts expiring in December slid 0.6 percent to 2,154.25 at 6:35 a.m. in New York. The equity benchmark capped its longest winning streak since July yesterday, as financial companies extended gains, although progress was tempered by losses in technology and some defensive stocks. Bucking the trend, the Nasdaq 100 Index dropped the most since September. Contracts on the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 72 points, or 0.4 percent, to 18,714, today, after the index posted its first record close in three months. \nAs the dust settles after the shock election result, the spotlight is intensifying on Trump’s policies and the possible winners and losers. Financial and health-care industries have so far emerged as the most likely beneficiaries amid speculation that the president-elect and Republican-controlled Congress will pare down regulations. Trump’s promise to revive the nation’s infrastructure means commodities needed for everything from airports to bridges will benefit, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. \n“The U.S. market is having a think about what a Trump presidency means,” said Paul Wildman, an analyst at Avalon Capital based in London. “I don’t think it will be terrible for business despite perhaps some protectionism. The market is worrying about not just one rate rise in December, it’s looking down into next year and thinking maybe the Fed might have to raise two or three or four times next year.” \nInvestors are also considering what a Trump presidency means for Federal Reserve policy and the trajectory of interest rates. Odds for a December increase in borrowing costs have risen to 80 percent from 78 percent a week ago. The University of Michigan’s preliminary reading of consumer sentiment in November will be scrutinized today for indications of the health of the world’s biggest economy. \nAs Trump prepares to take over the White House, earnings season is coming to an end. About 76 percent of companies that reported so far beat profit projections and 56 percent topped sales estimates. Analysts now expect quarterly earnings growth of 2.5 percent for the benchmark’s constituents, reversing forecasts for a 1.6 percent decline at the start of the month. \nAmong stocks moving in premarket New York trade, technology companies continued their declines, with Apple Inc., Amazon.com Inc. and Facebook Inc. each losing more than 1 percent. \nWalt Disney Co. climbed 1.1 percent after predicting renewed growth next year and beyond even as fourth-quarter profit fell short of estimates. Nvidia Corp surged 13 percent after the biggest maker of graphics chips used by computer gamers forecast quarterly sales that signaled continued strong demand for its signature products and gains in new markets such as data centers.

The refinery built by ABU Chemical Engineering students. Photo credit: Daily Trust \nHowever, the refinery would be used mainly for the training of the students, team leader of the project, Professor Ibrahim Ali Muhammad Dabo told Daily Trust. \nDabo however stated that the department had the manpower to build a refinery that would be bigger than that of Kaduna if it had government support. \nREAD ALSO: Goodbye Niger Delta? Niger Republic to supply crude oil to Kaduna refinery \nHis words: “The initial idea was to construct a 1,000 barrel-capacity refinery, but lack of funding limited us to this one, where we would now be refining one barrel per day. \n“Only the controls were sourced from Hong Kong. No expatriate was hired from abroad. All those that were engaged in this project are Nigerians. \n“Therefore, this mini refinery is a product of Nigerian brains. If government can come in, we have the ability to do wonderful things, not only refinery. \n“This is our training and it is what our department is meant for,” he said. \nAccording to Dabo, the project which cost N20million had more than 80 per cent of the materials used for the construction sourced locally. \nHe further stated that the idea of the mini refinery was conceived about 15 years back, but work commenced fully in the year 2011.",

      "text": "Facebook \n– Rev. Samson Ayokunle, the President of the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN), said that US President-elect, Donald Trump, was positioned by God to fight immorality in the country \n– The CAN leader said the nation that was once known as God’s own country is vastly becoming Sodom and Gomorrah \n– He called on Americans to watch very closely as the new administration would not tolerate the issues of immorality any more Donald Trump is the 45th President of the USA \nRev. Samson Ayokunle, the President of the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN), said that US President-elect, Donald Trump, was positioned by God to fight immorality in the country. \nAyokunle stated this while speaking at the 29th General Assembly of the Christian Council of Nigeria (CCN) held at First Baptist Church, Garki, Abuja, on Thursday, November 10. \nREAD ALSO: US election – Donald Trump in historic win \nHe called on Americans to watch very closely as the new administration would not tolerate the issues of immorality in the country any more. \nAccording to him, God positioned Trump to fight the immoral life in the American society. He said the nation that was once known as God’s own country is vastly becoming Sodom and Gomorrah. \nAyokunle said that there was an extent to which a nation would emphasise circular and individual liberty to the neglect of God’s absolute reign to the affairs of men. \nThe CAN leader also called on Nigerians to be on guard at all times as Boko Haram had not been fully defeated, following the recent killing of Lt. Col. Abu Ali and some soldiers in Maiduguri. \nHe said “it is not over until it is over; the fact that a top army officer was killed is a signal to the fact that we have not defeated them. \n“It was also an attestation to the commitment of the Federal Government to fight this demon called Boko Haram. So, everybody should be more committed so that the souls of those who died might not be in vain.” \nREAD ALSO: Hillary Clinton goes hiking after her electoral loss to Trump \nThe CAN boss called on Christians to be united and not to make their doctrinal beliefs to overwhelm them because Jesus Christ prayed for the church to be one. \nThe 70-year-old, won by over 57 million votes to his name, as against Hillary Clinton’s 56 million votes. \nTrump in his victory speech said he was “reaching out” to those who did not support him and that “it is time for us to come together as one united people”. “The forgotten men and women of our country will be forgotten no longer,” he added.",

      "text": "Facebook \n– Many citizens of the United States are yet to come to terms with the victory of Donald Trump at the presidential election \n– The president-elect currently has a number of cases against him in various courts across the US just as a judge has ruled against him \nA United States federal judge, Gonzalo Curiel, has ruled against the winner of the country’s presidential election, Donald Trump. \nTrump floored Hillary Clinton who was to make history as the country’s first female president and this has caused serious protests across the US as results showed that Clinton actually had the popular votes. A US federal court has ruled against Trump \nCuriel ruled Thursday, November 10, in San Diego, California, in a class-action lawsuit against Trump over the defunct Trump University. \nThe News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the case is scheduled to go to trial later in November and Trump is expected to testify in his own defence against allegations that the University for-profit business seminars was a hoax. \nThe plaintiffs argue that hundreds of individuals were charged large sums of money for courses that were essentially worthless. \nThe report said Judge Curiel ruled against Trump’s legal team who sought to ban testimony relating to Trump’s conduct during the presidential campaign as well as on the Trump University’s ‘F’ rating by the Better Business Bureau. \nAccording to Trump’s team, this is because the university had since gone bankrupt. \nThe judge, according to the report, further denied a request by Trump’s lawyers to ban discussion of the financial condition of students as well as the impact of the seminar fees had on their lives since many of them are poor. \nTrump’s lawyers had argued that the testimony about the presidential campaign and about the other elements of the case are irrelevant and would serve to colour the jury’s opinion of the president-elect and his business venture. \nREAD ALSO: Inside Donald Trump’s luxurious penthouse in New York \nThe judge ruled that the students be called to testify about their experience and how the courses improved their understanding of business and real estate. \nThe report said Trump had steadfastly defended the university as a worthwhile investment for participants, who were promised knowledge of how to build their businesses. \nThe trial is now scheduled to begin on November 28.",

      "text": "Mark Sullivan 11.10.16 3:30 PM \nIs Facebook at fault for providing an echo chamber of rumors and lies? \nThe automatic answer one often gets when asking that question is that the First Amendment reigns supreme—and social networking channels simply provide a neutral medium where people can say whatever they want. \nFacebook definitely provides such a medium, and it does relatively little to check free speech. But it’s also set up in a way that encourages and nurtures echo chambers where the most outrageous rumors, half-truths, and outright lies can go completely unchecked. \nPerhaps most troubling is that many news consumers on Facebook aren’t concerned with questioning the legitimacy or political bent of the sources of the stories they read and share. I know this from the stories my Trump-supporting friends and family have shared with me. Sure, there are voters whose dissatisfaction with the Washington establishment is rooted in righteous anger, and many voted for Trump accordingly—not because Hillary is a felon and has cancer, or because Obamacare kills the elderly via death panels, or other popular falsehoods. \nBut let's not forget that Trump’s political rise was boosted to life by the false claim that President Obama isn’t a U.S. citizen. He did this to generate heat throughout his campaign. Remember him boosting the story that Ted Cruz's dad was connected with the JFK assassination? \"All I did is point out the fact that on the cover of the National Enquirer there was a picture of him and crazy Lee Harvey Oswald having breakfast,\" Trump said at the time. \nGoal Number One of the Trump campaign was to send (and repeat) messages that elicit emotional responses (usually anger or fear) from disaffected people. He often used as fodder bogus or half-true news stories circulated on social media. \nWhile genuine political arguments do happen among friends on Facebook, the company's \"personalized news front page\" is not designed to foster meaningful discussions. On the contrary: The stories surfaced there are based on the interests of like-minded friends. Facebook believes, and has from the start, that agreement and harmony make for better engagement than argument and disharmony. That’s why there’s never been a \"thumbs down\" button on Facebook, and the reason that adding the \"angry face\" emoji was such a tough internal decision for the company. \nTake a forum like that, add a truth-averse persona like Donald Trump and his millions of followers, and you have an echo chamber that feeds on its own volume and gets louder and louder. Facebook and the Trump movement are a bad combination for reasoned discourse. \nAnd let’s call Facebook what it is: the biggest media organization in the world. It exerts more control over the news people see than any other single entity. It’s bigger than the New York Times , and yet you’d never refer to Facebook as a \"newspaper of record.\" \nTraditional news sources are accountable for what they publish, but because Facebook claims to be merely a \"platform,\" it escapes accountability for the information it surfaces for users, even as it makes editorial judgements like allowing Donald Trump to promote hate-fueled speech that would not be permitted by everyday users. \nPerhaps regulating free speech on social media channels would create more negative side effects than benefits, but this election should be a lesson that Facebook (and other social networks like Twitter) has not provided safe places for measured political discussions among people who disagree. And they've done a poor job of managing the bigoted talk has tainted the national discussion this election cycle. \nFacebook provided a forum, a breeding ground, for misinformation—and benefited handsomely from it. Social engagement is Facebook's business. Each new engagement—a comment, a like, a share—is a new opportunity to deliver an ad message. Or a new opportunity to add another piece of user data to the \"social graph,\" which might be used to help target some ad. In Facebook's political echo chamber, each echo represents opportunity. \nAnd by the time election season came to a close, the denizens of that echo chamber were full of passionate intensity—and Trump rode it all the way to a win. \nIs Facebook partly responsible for Trump's rise? You bet they are. Facebook will say \"we only provide the platform; what people do on it is their business.\" For years, that stock answer has worked pretty well for internet companies. But in the year of Trump, it rings a little hollow. Facebook provided the public space where the wild expression of frustration and hatred was OK. It played host to the oxygen fire of pent-up working class and rural frustration that carried Trump to the White House. \nIronically it’s people like Donald Trump and Peter Thiel who have benefited so richly from social media free speech who want to stifle the free speech of news outlets they don’t like. Trump wants to \"strengthen the libel laws,\" while Thiel believes that people with enough money should be able to bleed enemy publications out of existence through the courts. \nFull disclosure: I quit Facebook last week and deleted my account. I have been very suspicious of Facebook’s business model for a long time, but it was the tiresome political drone of the site over the past year that, I believe, finally did me in. I suppose I’ll miss some of my acquaintances on there, but I feel good about my decision so far. \nFor me, Facebook looks different in the wake of this painful election cycle. It’s not such a friendly place. It’s a place where millions of disaffected people met and talked each other into electing the most dangerous president in U.S. history. Never miss a story.

      "text": "Zuckerberg says Facebook didn't influence the election According to him, it's engagement with the facts that's the real problem. Save David Paul Morris / Bloomberg via Getty \nIf you controlled a media publishing platform that connected to millions of people, it'd make you a pretty powerful individual. Not so, according to Mark Zuckerberg, who has come out against the notion that Facebook helped win it for Trump . TechCrunch reports that the CEO was challenged about his social network's laissez-faire policy towards stopping the flood of fake, bubble-reinforcing propaganda . He thinks that the notion that the torrent of fabricated stories \"influenced the election in any way is a pretty crazy idea.\" \nZuckerberg believes that it's wrong to suggest that the diet of false stories, much of it generated in Macedonia , influenced things. Instead, he said that \"voters make decisions based on their lived experience,\" and that you \"don't generally go wrong when you trust that people understand what they care about.\" In addition, the Zuck says that the company studies fake news and analyzes how it can be improved, and feels that fake stories aren't much of a problem. In the same breath, the company is also pledging to do more to tackle fake news in the future .The Facebook chief also said that the problem isn't to do with the news feed, or people's social networks at all, but the level of engagement. He added that \"the biggest filter in the system is not that the content isn't there,\" but that \"you just tune it out when you see it.\" That's at odds with what Facebook said last year, too, when it said that if you were only seeing self-reinforcing stories, its because your friend circle wasn't diverse enough .

      "text": "\nA lot of questions are emerging about Facebook’s role in this year’s election cycle, especially given the proliferation of sensationalistic and even outright fake news stories, and CEO Mark Zuckerberg has responded.\n“I think the idea that fake news on Facebook—of which it’s a very small amount of the content—influenced the election in any way is a pretty crazy idea,” he said on Thursday at the Techonomy conference in Half Moon Bay, Calif., just two days after Donald Trump was elected president, according to media reports .\n“There have been hoaxes on the Internet, there were hoaxes before,” he said. “We do our best to make it so that people can report that, and as I said before, we can show people the most meaningful content we can.”\n\nTrump’s victory in the U.S. presidential election stunned many, including polling analysts and the media. Since then, many questions about the role of social media—and mass media at large—have been swirling.\nFacebook [fortune-stock symbol=”fb”], in particular, has grown into a powerful tool for sharing information and news articles—or what looks like news articles. In a recent report, BuzzFeed detailed how a slew of teens in Macedonia have been creating entire operations of pushing fake, but very dramatic, news onto the social network, which uses algorithms to decide what each user sees in their News Feeds.\nThus, the argument is that services like Facebook are enabling the viral spread of these faux news articles, and some are asking whether it may have had a significant effect on the election’s outcome. Read more in Fortune ‘s Mathew Ingram’s take on why Facebook is partly to blame here .\n“Part of what I think is going on here is people are trying to understand the results of the election,” Zuckerberg said. “I think there is a certain profound lack of empathy in asserting that the only reason why someone could have voted the way they did is because they saw some fake news.”\nOf course, Facebook is sticking to its guns. The social network giant has vehemently denied that it’s a media company, insisting that it’s merely an open technology platform enabling people to connect with each other and share information.\nFacebook also argues that its users are exposed to a variety of viewpoints through the service, despite criticism that it’s an echo chamber for each user to have their viewpoints reinforced over and over again. But even Zuckerberg has acknowledged that people don’t tend to click on articles promoting viewpoints different from their own, which only supports the idea of an online echo chamber. And therefore, fewer of those tend to show up in your News Feed.\n\nThat’s also where Zuckerberg is both right and wrong. Fake news articles did play a role, but in reaffirming or confirming what people want to believe; probably not so much in swaying most users’ pre-existing beliefs to the point that they entirely changed their minds.\nWith that said, Zuckerberg’s comments shouldn’t be surprising at all. Even if the company has come to believe its News Feed has had some effect, why would it possibly want to acknowledge that in public?\nDoing so would only open the door even louder to calls for Facebook to start regulating the information on its network, and the company has no interest in getting into that messy game. Even when it tried to hire young employees to flag popular news items and write short descriptions of the stories, it was quickly confronted with accusations of bias against right-wing media , and dismantled the entire operation to replace it with algorithms.\nEditorial judgement is difficult and carries risks—just ask any member of the media.\n",

      "text": "Oprah Reflects On President-Elect Trump November 11, 2016 6:31 AM Follow CBSDFW.COM: Facebook | Twitter ATLANTA (AP) – As Oprah Winfrey reflected Thursday on this week’s election, she said she was initially in disbelief after learned Donald Trump was elected president of the United States. But the media mogul, who was vocal in her support for Democratic hopeful Hillary Clinton, found some comfort in watching President Barack Obama and president-elect Trump meet with each other at the White House on Thursday. In an interview with The Associated Press on Thursday, Winfrey said “hope is still alive” after Obama said he was encouraged by Trump’s willingness to work with his team during the transition of power. The meeting between Obama and Trump lasted nearly 90 minutes. Winfrey didn’t think Trump being elected was a repudiation of Obama. She credits Trump’s victory to his millions of supporters who felt like their voices had not been heard. “I could sense, maybe I’m wrong, but I could sense from Donald Trump’s body language even when he came out for the acceptance speech, that brotha has been humbled by this whole thing. I think it’s a humbling process that now you literally have the weight of the world on your shoulders,” she said. (© Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.   rewritten or redistributed.)",

And even if you could, chances are you’d never set foot on the moon – we haven’t personally visited that luminous satellite in over 40 years. \nSo, no magical moon missions for you. But thanks to NASA and the Project Apollo Archive, now you can at least feel like you’ve been . \nEnter VRtually There, a weekly video series from the USA TODAY network. Using some of the latest state-of-the-art virtual reality technology, they’re giving us a 360 degree first-hand look at how it feels to stand on the surface of the moon. \nIn 1972, American astronauts Eugene Cernan and Jack Schmitt were the last men to land on the moon. They brought with them an American flag, some Hasselblad cameras, giddy exuberance and a great sense of humor.

They took hundreds of detailed photos of the moon’s surface, documenting their landing in exhausting detail. Last year, Project Apollo Archive made available over 8,400 unprocessed, high-resolution photos from that mission. \nWe’ve stitched 25 of them together into an astonishing panorama that puts you on the surface of the moon with Cernan and Schmitt, clowning around in their spacesuits in the moon’s lower gravity, assembling the flag and gawking at orange soil. Yes, orange. \nCheck out the full video below, which also includes some crazy cool footage of the world’s fastest roller coaster.

      "text": "Mark Zuckerberg says no, don't blame election results on Facebook Latest News Facebook chief executive officer Mark Zuckerberg speaks at the company's headquarters in Menlo Park, Calif., on Thursday, April 4, 2013. Marcio Jose Sanchez/AP View Caption of \nFacebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg defended his company on Thursday by saying that it’s a “crazy idea” to think that fake news on the social network helped elect Donald Trump to the White House. \nIt was a remark aimed at criticism that the social media network, one of the most widely used in the United States, has aided in the spread of fake news through its algorithms that run the Trending box, and in showing what posts show up on a user’s feed. \n“I do think that there is a certain profound lack of empathy in asserting that the only reason why someone could have voted the way that they did as because they saw some fake news,” Mr. Zuckerberg said, as reported by Recode. “I think if you believe that, then I don’t think you have internalized the message that Trump supporters are trying to send in this election.” Recommended: Are you savvy about social networks? Take our quiz to find out. \nBut critics point out that the fake news stories – on both sides – could have played a role in steering voters toward an inaccurate and polarizing picture of the country, affecting their decisions at the poll and contributing to misunderstandings. Deciding what should and should not show up in social media, however, is a tricky job that runs the risk of editorializing – yet the burden will increasingly fall on technology companies like Facebook, as social media becomes a major source of news for Americans. Photos of the Day Photos of the day 11/10 \n“For all [Facebook's] wonders ... it’s also become a single point of failure for civic information,” Joshua Benton, the director of the Nieman Journalism Lab at Harvard University, wrote on Wednesday. “Our democracy has a lot of problems, but there are few things that could impact it for the better more than Facebook starting to care – really care – about the truthfulness of the news that its users share and take in.” \nThe organizations and users creating fake content vary widely, as do their stories: from the fake, trending Facebook story about Fox News host Megyn Kelly being fired and supporting Hillary Clinton; to stories falsely claiming that Mrs. Clinton had called for civil war if Trump won, or that Pope Francis had endorsed Trump; to even a made-up stories suggesting the Clintons had murdered someone. \nAll this occurred as Facebook was under fire after it fired its Trending section editors, amid accusations that they had censored conservative news stories, leaving an algorithm to filter out misleading information. \nBut the company hasn't been able to defeat popular posts that trick the algorithm into displaying them prominently. Some users hungry for ad money are taking advantage of that weakness to create hundreds of fake websites to push false news on Facebook , as revealed by investigations from Buzzfeed and The Guardian. A group of teenagers in Macedonia told Buzzfeed they did it for the money, publishing stories that claimed Mike Pence said Michelle Obama was \"the most vulgar first lady we’ve ever had\" and that Clinton would be indicted for the email scandal, for instance. \nOther social media companies, like Twitter, also had to deal with tweets spreading misinformation, such as false rules about voting procedures. Google went a step further to address this problem by adding a “fact check” label in its news clusters, along with “opinion.” Back in 2014, Facebook tested labeling fake news stories with a “satire” tag . \nZuckerberg has repeatedly emphasized that Facebook is merely a tech company, not a media company in charge of determining content. But proliferation of false information on the platform may hurt its credibility, Adam Mosseri, the vice president of product management at the company, acknowledged in a statement to Tech Crunch on Thursday. \n“In Trending we look at a variety of signals to help make sure the topics being shown are reflective of real-world events, and take additional steps to prevent false or misleading content from appearing,” Mr. Mosseri wrote. “Despite these efforts we understand there’s so much more we need to do , and that is why it’s important that we keep improving our ability to detect misinformation.” Next up ",

A spokesperson declined to share how much Facebook paid for the company.\nCrowdTangle appears to be most popular with media companies — customers include NPR, the BBC, Buzzfeed, and Vox — but the service also boasts of customers across marketing agencies, sports leagues, and non-profits.\nFacebook says “publishers around the world turn to CrowdTangle to surface stories that matter, measure their social performance and identify influencers. We are excited to work with CrowdTangle to deliver these, and more insights to more publishers.”\nWhile CrowdTangle helps publishers track stories online, it’s unlikely the service will address one of Facebook’s biggest editorial challenges.\nFacebook’s on-again, off-again relationship with publishers has been abrasive at best lately. And following the 2016 U.S. election, as numerous news organizations have documented and critiqued Facebook’s role in the spread of misinformation, some journalists are pleading with Facebook to improve its news feed.\nFacebook has said it will work to address the issue , but only yesterday CEO Mark Zuckerberg outright denied that fake news on Facebook influenced the U.S. election in any way.\n \nMore to follow. \nGet more stories like this on Twitter & Facebook ",

      "text": "Facebook will disable “ethnic affinity” targeting for housing, employment and credit-related ads Posted \nIt may be tough to remember given all the discussion about the role that Facebook’s News Feed may have played in getting Donald Trump elected, but the company was also criticized recently for its “ethnic affinity” ad targeting . Today, Facebook announced that it’s making some changes. \nThe targeting allows advertisers to focus on users whose Facebook activity indicates an interest in “content relating to particular ethnic communities.” A ProPublica report suggested that these capabilities could be used for discriminatory advertising — particularly in housing and employment, where such practices are illegal. \nFacebook’s response at the time was to point out that it prohibits discriminatory ad practices and said it will take down any violating ads. In a blog post published this morning, Erin Egan — Facebook’s vice president for US public policy and its chief privacy officer — said the company will go further. \nTo be clear, Facebook isn’t abandoning “ethnic affinity” targeting. Instead, it says it’s building tools that will automatically disable the targeting for ads that involve housing, employment or credit. Related Articles Zuckerberg denies Facebook News Feed bubble impacted the election Facebook admits it must do more to stop the spread of misinformation on its platform Facebook draws criticism for 'ethnic affinity' ad targeting “There are many non-discriminatory uses of our ethnic affinity solution in these areas, but we have decided that we can best guard against discrimination by suspending these types of ads,” Egan said. “We will continue to explore ways that our ethnic affinity solution can be used to promote inclusion of underrepresented communities, and we will continue to work with stakeholders toward that goal.”\nIn addition, Egan said Facebook will do more to educate advertisers on how to avoid discriminatory practices. \nApparently, the company didn’t make these decisions on its own. According to the post, Facebook met with government officials to discuss the issue, as well as having a “constructive dialogue” with groups including the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, the American Civil Liberties Union, the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, the National Fair Housing Alliance, the Center for Democracy & Technology, the Brookings Institution and Upturn.

The company said in a statement that it will require advertisers to make new agreements to not discriminate with ads, and is planning to release new materials \"to help advertisers understand their obligations.\" \n\"We are making these changes to deter discrimination and strengthen our ability to enforce our policies,\" Facebook said in the statement. \"We look forward to finding additional ways to combat discrimination, while increasing opportunity, and to continuing our dialogue with policymakers and civil rights leaders about these important issues.\" \nAlthough it has offered the targeting options for two years, Facebook first came under fire last month, after a ProPublica investigation outlined the practice, and showed how it may conflict with federal housing law. Lawmakers soon responded , calling on Facebook to change its policies. \nFacebook defended the practice at the time. \"This kind of communication is positive: it reflects an advertiser’s respect for the diverse communities it is trying to reach,\" the company said in response . \"But it’s important to know that there’s also negative exclusion — for example, an apartment building that won’t rent to black people or an employer that only hires men. Our ad policies strictly prohibit this kind of advertising, and it’s against the law.\" \nFacebook first defended the practice after it gained attention \nOther digital advertising companies offer some form of demographic-based ads, although not necessarily based on race, and the practice is not inherently illegal. But both ProPublica and lawmakers pointed to the Fair Housing Act, meant to curb discrimination in housing, as one place where Facebook may have overstepped the law. Last week, users filed a proposed class action suit against the company, claiming it enabled illegal discrimination through the practice. More From The Verge",

Robin Kelly of Illinois and the Congressional Black Caucus, and U.S. Rep. Linda Sánchez of California and the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, to listen to their concerns and their ideas about how Facebook can better support our existing efforts to combat wrongful discrimination.” \nThe site also vowed to “offer more clarification and education” regarding its advertising policies. \n“We are making these changes to deter discrimination and strengthen our ability to enforce our policies,” the site said. “We look forward to finding additional ways to combat discrimination, while increasing opportunity, and to continuing our dialogue with policymakers and civil rights leaders about these important issues.” Join the Conversation:",

Justin Sullivan/Getty Images \nFacebook announced on Friday it is going to remove an option that allowed advertisers to exclude certain ethnic groups from their targeting. \nThe social network has offered the ability to exclude \"Ethnic Affinity\" groups for a couple of years, but the feature was thrust into public attention last month, thanks to an article from ProPublica . \nThe article explained housing or employment ads that exclude people based on race, gender, or other sensitive factors are prohibited by federal law — but the author managed to purchase an ad aimed at house hunters that excluded anyone with an “affinity” for African-American, Asian-American or Hispanic people that was approved within \"15 minutes.\" This month, a lawsuit seeking class action status alleged Facebook was violating federal fair housing laws and civil rights laws for allowing the option. \nOn Friday, Facebook's VP of US public policy and chief privacy officer Erin Egan published a blog post outlining that \"discriminatory advertising has no place on Facebook.\" \nFacebook is making a number of changes to address the issue. It is disabling the ethnic affinity targeting option for ads it identifies as offering housing, employment, or credit products and building tools. The company is also building tools that can automatically identify when an advertiser in one of these sectors has attempted to exclude an ethnic group from its targeting. \nIn addition, Facebook says it wants to provide more clarification and education to prevent marketers from running discriminatory ad campaigns. \nEgan said Facebook met with New York State Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, U.S. Rep. Robin Kelly of Illinois and the Congressional Black Caucus, and U.S. Rep. Linda Sánchez of California and the Congressional Hispanic Caucus to discuss how the site can do better to target discrimination. \nFacebook also spoke with the American Civil Liberties Union, the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, the National Fair Housing Alliance, the Center for Democracy & Technology, the Brookings Institution, and Upturn. \nEgan concluded: \"We are making these changes to deter discrimination and strengthen our ability to enforce our policies. We look forward to finding additional ways to combat discrimination, while increasing opportunity, and to continuing our dialogue with policymakers and civil rights leaders about these important issues. \" \nFacebook's ethnic affinity targeting option has been compared to racial profiling by detractors, but the company has argued that its advertising policy prohibits using its targeting features to discriminate against a group of people.",

      "text": "Tweet \nFacebook founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg says it’s a “pretty crazy idea” to suggest the “small amount” of bogus news that habitually goes viral on his social media platform played any role in the outcome of the presidential election. \n“I do think there is a certain profound lack of empathy in asserting that the only reason someone could have voted the way they did is they saw some fake news,” Zuckerberg said . “If you believe that, then I don’t think you have internalized the message the Trump supporters are trying to send in this election.” \nThe Facebook leader, speaking at a technology conference in San Francisco Thursday, said voters made their decisions not on fake news that circulated on the network but on “their lived experience.” \nHowever, not everyone in Silicon Valley agrees with Zuckerberg. Tech investor Dave McClure, founder of the business accelerator 500 Startups, said technology is “a propaganda medium” that has led the way in the trafficking of false information. \n“People aren’t aware of the [expletive] they’re being told,” he said Thursday during a Web Summit in Lisbon, Portgual, according to USA Today . \nAnd technology forecaster Paul Saffo warned, “There has long been this naive view that technology is neutral and there’s nothing neutral about technology. The problem is we can never figure out which way it’s going to cut until it arrives.” \nBut Zuckerberg has stood his ground. While speaking in San Francisco, he also rejected the idea that people’s Facebook feeds have become so personalized that they are no longer being exposed to any opposing viewpoints. \n“We’ve studied it a lot. I really care about this,” he said, highlighting how important it is to him that Facebook users receive a “diversity of information.” \nZuckerberg argued that most Facebook users are friends with people who have differing viewpoints. \n“Even if 90 percent of your friends are Democrats, probably 10 percent are Republicans. Even if you live in some state or country you will know some people in another state, another country,” he said. “That means that the information you are getting through the social system is going to be inherently more diverse than you would have gotten through news stations.” \nHe argued that the issue isn’t a lack of diversity on everyone’s Facebook feed but that users don’t “click on and engage” material they feel is in opposition to their predetermined ideals.",

      "title": "Mark Zuckerberg: ‘Facebook has no fake news problem. Also, Hillary Clinton killed Scalia.’",
      "text": "By Jason O. Gilbert \nSAN FRANCISCO—At a conference last night, Mark Zuckerberg fought back against allegations that misinformation on Facebook helped swing the election, and, in addition, said that Hillary Clinton ordered the assassination of Justice Antonin Scalia. \n“Fake news is not a problem on Facebook,” Zuckerberg said, before adding, “Hillary Clinton hired a lesbian death squad to smother Antonin Scalia with a pillow.” \n“Scalia knew that Hillary was having an affair with Angela Merkel,” Zuckerberg said to a smattering of applause, “so she had no choice but to personally contract a roving gay-lady motorcycle gang to take him out, Texas-style.” \n“Hillary Clinton has dog rabies,” he added. \nJournalists have debated the role of the Facebook News Feed in spreading false, hyperpartisan news stories in the wake of Donald Trump’s election. Zuckerberg, who was wearing an old-timey baseball uniform and smoked a corncob pipe, shrugged it off. \n“At Facebook we believe all voices should be heard,” Zuckerberg said, “whether it’s an investigative series from a New York Times reporter, or a story written by a neo-Nazi Slovakian teenager who believes in global apartheid about Hillary Clinton personally doing Benghazi from George Soros’ helicopter.” \n“Both of those stories should be treated totally equally,” Zuckerberg said, before ripping off his trousers to perform a 35-minute pantsless version of Riverdance . \nZuckerberg’s comments will do little to quell the debate over Facebook’s mysterious algorithm, which prioritizes articles like New York ‘s “ Donald Trump Won Because of Facebook ” (2K shares) and TruthBazooka’s “ Hillary Clinton’s Body Double Read from a Jewish Teleprompter at the Debate ” (157K shares). \n“All the research we have—which consists of me asking Lloyd Blankfein at Davos—suggests this is not an issue,” Zuckerberg said. \nAt one point, Zuckerberg posed a hypothetical to the audience. \n“Think of this way: Would it be easy to build a tool that halted the spread of phony stories designed to incite loonies? Sure,” he said. “But also: Did John Podesta strangle a diabetic WWII veteran in the parking lot of a condemned VA hospital?” \nHe let the question hang in the air and then threw down a magician’s smoke bomb. When the smoke dissipated, he had disappeared, leaving behind a ZuckerMannequin flipping the bird and grabbing its crotch. \nIn a statement, Facebook PR rep Lindsay von Lindseyton also dismissed fears of Facebook’s influence. \n“Facebook was one of many sources for people to receive their news this year, which means we are totally off the hook,” she wrote. “In addition, we’d like to ask all of our advertisers to please ignore our excuse that Facebook users are not influenced or swayed by anything they see on Facebook. \n“Please continue to give us all of your money,” the statement concluded. \nIn the end, the question of whether Facebook could have done more to spread truth instead of misinformation isn’t likely to be settled soon—until at least next week, when TruthBazooka reports that Hillary Clinton begins her trial for the murder of Antonin Scalia.

The social media site doesn’t ask users to state their race when they sign up. Regarding the possibility for misuse of the “ethnic affinity” categorization, Facebook says its “policies strictly prohibit discriminatory uses of this solution.” AOL A screenshot of Facebook's \"ethnic affinity\" tool, which allowed marketers to target certain groups with their ads. \nFacebook’s decision is smart, both in the sense that it no longer risks perpetuating inequity in three historically discriminatory fields, and that it helps the company avoid what could be very serious legal challenges, say legal experts. \nThe policy shift is “a positive approach that moves them forward towards compliance with the law and that ensures they are not facilitating discrimination,” Jon Bauer, a law professor at the University of Connecticut who focuses on discrimination, told USA Today . \nProPublica’s report compared Facebook’s racial targeting abilities to a modern variant of Jim Crow-era ads, since they could permit property managers, for example, to only advertise apartments to white people. \nThe Fair Housing Act of 1968 explicitly prohibits making, printing or publishing ads “with respect to the sale or rental of a dwelling that indicates any preference, limitation, or discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, handicap, familial status, or national origin.” Also on HuffPost 10 Ways Facebook Messes With Your Life 10 Ways Facebook Messes With Your Life 1 10 It Can Mess With Your Sleep Heavy social media use can upset sleep patterns, studies have found .

By Abby Ohlheiser November 11 at 12:08 PM Follow @abbyohlheiser (Amy Cavenaile/The Washington Post; iStock) \nThe idea that Facebook’s fake news problem could have influenced the result of the 2016 presidential elections is a “crazy idea,” the social network’s co-founder and chief executive said Thursday. \nMark Zuckerberg was responding to calls from media writers and experts for Facebook to examine its role in spreading hyperpartisan misinformation to a wide audience in the months before the elections. Zuckerberg countered that fake news “surely had no impact” on whom voters chose to be president. \n“Voters make decisions based on their lived experience,” Zuckerberg said in an interview with David Kirkpatrick at the Techonomy conference in Half Moon Bay, Calif. “I think there is a certain profound lack of empathy in asserting that the only reason why someone could have voted the way they did is because they saw some fake news.” [ Facebook has repeatedly trended fake news since firing its human editors ] \nThere are a couple of reasons why, days after the election of now President-elect Donald Trump, Zuckerberg is being asked to answer for Facebook’s long-standing difficulties in dealing with hoaxes and fake news that spread freely through its massive user network. \nFacebook is a tech company, one that prides itself on neutrality and that has explicitly said it is not a media company. With 1.7 billion monthly active users across the globe, Facebook is also perhaps the most influential distributor of information in the world. According to a recent Pew study , 44 percent of the general population in the United States says it gets its news from Facebook. And 79 percent of Americans online use Facebook in general, a much larger share than that of any other social network . \nAs Facebook has become the favorite online home for Americans, it has also become host to a wide array of hyperpartisan content machines that publish mountains of misleading or outright fabricated stories that are explicitly designed to be widely shared among people who are more inclined to believe them. [ No, John Podesta didn’t drink bodily fluids at a secret Satanist dinner ] \nAccording to a BuzzFeed analysis of many of these hyperpartisan pages , that misinformation targets both progressives and conservatives, but false or misleading news stories are more common among right-wing sites. That’s also reflected in The Intersect’s own, nonscientific tracking of fake stories about the election across all social media platforms over the past few weeks. Misinformation on Facebook wasn’t exclusive to the supporters of one candidate, but it was more common and viral on the right. \nThere is also some evidence that right-wing readers of online news are being encouraged to ignore attempts at verification of these stories. “Forget the press, read the Internet,” Trump told his supporters just months before his victory. He didn’t specify which parts of the Internet he liked, but we already know that he accepts and repeats information from websites and tabloids that publish false or misleading articles. For instance, he has in the past complimented the work of Alex Jones, the conspiracy theorist behind Infowars, which has argued that the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School was a “false flag.” [ If you use Facebook to get your news, please — for the love of democracy — read this first ] \n“The Internet,” even just Facebook, looks very different to different people. As Facebook gains influence in the lives of its users, experts have become concerned about algorithmically enforced “filter bubbles.” People tend to click on stories that confirm their worldview. \nAny good algorithm for a site like Facebook would be able to notice that and use the information to start showing users other posts and stories like it. Although Facebook has over the years denied that its algorithms are part of the problem , the fact remains that ideological polarization on Facebook is getting worse at a time when the site has never been more important to how people consume information. Zuckerberg repeated his company’s long-standing response to questions about the influence of the filter bubble on Thursday. Which is, essentially, that it’s the people, and not the site or its algorithms, that create the problem. \n“Even if 90 percent of your friends are Democrats, probably 10 percent are Republicans. Even if you live in some state or country, you will know some people in another state, another country,” he said . He added later that “it’s not that the diverse information isn’t there … but we haven’t got people to engage with it in higher proportions.” \nMore reading:",

      "text": "Like Us On Facebook \nJK Rowling does not see a problem with putting Johnny Depp in her “Potter” franchise. \nLess than six months ago, Depp was faced with a charge of physically abusing his then-wife, Amber Heard . \nMany fans were outraged to hear, despite these abuse allegations, he would be playing the important role of Grindelwald in their beloved franchise. Twitter Twitter \nHowever, it seems JK Rowling does not share her fans anger. \nAt the red carpet premiere of “Fantastic Beast and Where to Find Them” in New York on Thursday night, the author said she was “delighted” to have Depp in the cast, according to a report from BT . \nRowling said of Depp, \nI’m delighted. He’s done incredible things with that character. \nDavid Yates, the director of “Fantastic Beasts” as well as the last four “Harry Potter” films, was also on the red carpet. He agreed with Rowling, adding, \nYou have to trust us and see what he does in this movie… What you have to remember about Johnny is that extraordinary talent and that talent never goes away. Hollywood is such a fickle place. People go up and go down. He’s a huge Potter fan. He loves the world. He was beyond excited about working on this material. In fact he didn’t even want to see a script, he just said ‘I’m in.’ \nUnfortunately, for many fans, Hollywood and talent is not the issue here. \nHowever, it seems fans are stuck with Depp for the next four films of “Fantastic Beasts.” \nDepp is confirmed to be playing Gellert Grindelwald, the dark wizard who many are familiar with as being Albus Dumbledore’s past lover. \nYou can see a brief shot of Depp for yourself at around 3:22 in the below featurette. Waner Bros/REX/Shutterstock \nYates has also confirmed he is looking to cast a younger Dumbledore for the upcoming films. \nRowling did not confirm whether or not fans would see this romantic relationship play out on screen. \nShe said, \nI can’t tell you everything I’d like to say because obviously it’s a five-part story and there’s lots to unpack in that relationship. I will say you’ll see Dumbledore as a younger man and quite a troubled man because he wasn’t always the sage. He was always very clever. We’ll see him at what I think was the formative period of his life. As far as his sexuality is concerned, watch this space. \n“Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them” will be in theaters everywhere November 18. \n ",

      "text": "(Dado Ruvic/Reuters/Illustration) Facebook will stop letting marketers run housing, employment, and credit ads that target or exclude users by racial and ethnic identity on the social network, the company announced Friday.\nFacebook have let advertisers target ads using what it calls “ethnic affinity” for some time, but the practice came under fire after a recent ProPublica report showed how the feature could be used to place ads that may violate federal anti-discrimination laws.\nThe journalism outfit said it was able to order a Facebook ad for a housing event that wouldn’t be shown to African American, Hispanic and Asian American users. ProPublica was able to place the ad despite a Facebook policy banning marketers from using its ad targeting tools to discriminate against users.\nThe report led to an outcry from civil right groups and policymakers concerned that the targeting feature could be used to violate federal laws barring discriminatory ads in areas such as housing and employment opportunities.\nBoth the marketer and the publisher of a discriminatory housing ad can be punished under the federal Fair Housing Act, according to University of Missouri law professor Rigel Oliveri.\nSites that let people post ads are generally protected from that liability because of a different law that says such services aren’t responsible for user-generated content, she said. But Facebook’s approach raised “serious legal problems” because it offered tools that could be used to exclude a protected user class, according to Oliveri.\nA group of users filed a potential class-action lawsuit against Facebook about the issue last week.\nFacebook told ProPublica it does not know users’ races and that the ethnic affinity categorization is determined by what posts and pages people engage with on the platform.\n“Discriminatory advertising has no place on Facebook,” Erin Egan, Facebook's vice president for U.S. public policy and chief privacy officer, said in a Friday blog post.\nThe company will build tools to detect and automatically disable the use of “ethnic affinity” targeting for advertisements about housing, credit or employment, she wrote. There are “many non-discriminatory uses” for targeting ads in those areas using the company’s “ethnic affinity solution,” but the company decided the best way to “guard against discrimination” was suspending those types of ads altogether, Egan said.\nFacebook spokeswoman Jodi Seth said the decision was “unrelated” to the pending lawsuit. Instead, it was a change the company had been considering and was “accelerated” after it heard from civil rights groups and policymakers, she told The Washington Post in an email.\nIn addition to blocking the advertisements, Facebook will update its advertising policies “to be even more explicit and require advertisers” to commit to not posting discriminatory ads on Facebook, Egan wrote. The company will also offer new educational materials aimed at explaining legal restrictions on housing, credit, and employment ads to marketers, she added.\nThe Center for Democracy & Technology, which had urged Facebook to change its system, praised the move.\n“These changes will improve Facebook’s platform and protect its users from the worst types of discriminatory advertising,” CDT senior policy analyst Alethea Lange said in a blog post responding to the announcement.",

And Clinton, who leads Trump by 17 percent among those who haven’t voted, has only a 21 percent lead overall in the state. That’s down from 26 percent in the previous poll conducted by SurveyUSA and issued Tuesday by Southern California News Group and KABC/Eyewitness News. (AP file photos) November 11, 2016 at 10:48 am \nFake. It’s the word of the day as pundits and politicos ponder this: was this campaign season’s plethora of phony news stories and bogus tweets, many of which ended up passed around on Facebook and which often made the Clinton camp seem downright menacing, one of the reasons Donald Trump was able to shock much of the planet and ascend to the Oval Office? \nOr, as Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in his defense to critics who claim the social-media site is awash in bogus news posts: \n“Personally, I think the idea that fake news on Facebook—of which it’s a very small amount of the content—influenced the election in any way is a pretty crazy idea.” \nHe also raised a very good point when he addressed the suggestion that there seemed to be more fake stories about Hillary than Trump: “Why would you think fake news would be on one side, but not on the other?” \nThat’s not to say that Facebook and the rest of the online world has been rife with questionable and downright made-up “news” reports. A BuzzFeed study of “hyperpartisan Facebook pages” discovered that these sites “are consistently feeding their millions of followers false or misleading information.” And the study also showed that the less truthful a piece of content was, the more it was shared. \n“Right-wing pages were more prone to sharing false or misleading information than left-wing pages,” the BuzzFeed reporting team said. \nWe decided to poke around and find ten of the more outrageous fake stories of the 2016 election. Let’s start with candidate Trump’s very own Twitter account where, just days before the election he tweeted out an inflammatory bit of nonsense stating: “Twitter, Google and Facebook are burying the FBI criminal investigation of Clinton.” No proof that was happening, and all three sites, in fact, had plenty of stories about the FBI’s probe into Clinton’s emails. But that didn’t stop the tweeted ”news alert” from taking on a life of its own, quickly being retweeted by 25,000 other twitterers and being “liked” 50,000 times. When is ABC News not really ABC News? When a hoax version of the site appears with a story headlined “Donald Trump Protester Speaks Out: ‘I Was Paid $3,500 To Protest Trump’s Rally.'” And even though the site was clearly bogus, the prank in early October fooled Trump’s son Eric Trump, prompting him to tweet forth with “Finally, the truth comes out.” The story also generated hundreds of very real and very angry (on both sides) comments from readers. Twitter? Trust, if you want, but verify: Election Day was just cranking up when Twitter hoaxsters went to work, starting with phony exit poll numbers from the Sunshine State, ostensibly coming from an official CNN account which turned out not to be. It shared this little lopsided and fabricated report: BREAKING: The first Florida exit poll numbers have been released. Trump 55% Clinton 39% Johnson 6%— CNN (@CNN_PoIitics) Nov. 8, 2016 Even Sean Hannity makes mistakes: The radio host got caught with his proverbial pants down when he found, swallowed and ingested a large chunk of fresh fake news about President Obama supposedly erasing endorsements of Hillary from his Twitter account. That “news” prompted Hannity to suggest that Obama’s legacy might be “jail.” Trouble was, the claim could have been easily disproven with a quick search of Twitter, even if the searcher were a four-year-old. Hannity soon tweeted a very real correction and a supposedly sincere apology. Now that’s American ingenuity: YourNewsWire, which was the carrier of the fake news Hannity feasted upon, publishes a mix of true, slanted and simply bogus news. Good clean fun, right? Well, not when it fires off “news” accusing one candidate or the other of evil deeds and that “news” spreads among the believers like wildfire. And YourNewsWire is just one of many “news” sites that have come under the scrutiny of fact-checking groups like Real or Satire? Their staff has poked and prodded a whole range of suspicious actors, from the jokers over at News10Live.com to the all-in-good-fun guys behind Now8News.com, which Real or Satire? applauds because they at least have “the decency to provide a disclaimer: We thank Now88News for being upfront and honest about their site’s content.” Related Articles ",

      "text": "2016 November 11, 2016 \nPeople who believe fake news on Facebook influenced the US presidential election are showing a “profound lack of empathy” and are believing in a “pretty crazy idea,” says Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg. \nHe made the remarks on Nov. 10 in an on-stage interview at the Techonomy conference in California with former Fortune journalist David Kirkpatrick. \n“Personally, I think the idea that fake news on Facebook, of which it’s a very small amount of the content, influenced the election in any way, I think is a pretty crazy idea. Voters make decisions based on their lived experience,” Zuckerberg said. \nHe added: \n“Part of what I think is going on here is people are trying to understand the result of the election, but I do think there is a certain profound lack of empathy in asserting the only way someone could have voted the way they did is because they saw some fake news. If you believe that, then I don’t think you have internalized the message that Trump supporters are trying to send in this election.” \nZuckerberg argued that supporters of both candidates could generate fake news, so it wasn’t clear why it would specifically benefit Trump’s campaign. “The quickest way to refute that this surely had no impact, is why would you think there’s fake news on one side and not the other. We study this, we know this is a small volume,” he said. \nZuckerberg defended his platform’s News Feed algorithm, claiming that it already provides users a diversity of information. The problem is that users don’t click on items with different viewpoints from their own, he said, seeming to reference a 2015 peer-reviewed study by Facebook data scientists. \nThat study had several problems, including using a sample of Facebook users who identified their political ideology, which isn’t representative of the average user, as University of North Carolina professor Zeynep Tufekci has written . \nThroughout the interview, Zuckerberg downplayed Facebook’s role as a gatekeeper of news, saying that his platform merely reflected users’ wishes. Nevertheless, Facebook issued a statement yesterday saying it was working on its ability to detect “misinformation” in its news feed and in its Trending section, which highlights topics users are discussing on the platform. \nDespite Zuckerberg’s protestations, Facebook already has a powerful toolkit to deal with fake news. In August, it announced that it was clamping down on clickbait articles with a system that worked like an email spam filter. Zuckerberg said the measures have “dramatically improved” the quality of the News Feed. \nPerhaps if those tools had been adapted for the flood of “hyperpartisan” Facebook pages churning out questionable material during campaign season, voters would have had to contend with less noise when they were making their decision at the ballot box.

      "title": "”I’m not after her pussy”! Nigerian actor cries out as marriage to Oyinbo wife ends",
      "text": "Facebook \nYoruba Nollywood actor, Yomi Fabiyi, who got married to a white lady, Fran, about 4 years ago, has cried out on his plans to divorce. \nThe actor took to his Instagram page to intimate his fans in a long narration of how he did not marry his British wife for green card and how he is not happy anymore with the union. According to him, he would have preferred that the wife come over to Nigeria while they settle down husband and wife but the wife prefers the other way round. She wants him to come live in England permanently, take up an employment and also study while at it. Yomi Fabiyi and wife \nRead how the actor put it on Instagram below: \n“It’s so sad that a lot of people never give me the benefit of the doubt. Only a handful think it is right to respect my freedom of choice. I have been unlucky in life, most of what I do normally have opposite impression irrespective of my positive mindset. I cannot help it and will rather prefer to continue to be real as possible, I am used to being misinterpreted my entire adult life. I never aim to hurt anybody in words or actions before them or behind them. I am never raised that way. They forget that some people no matter how horrible the situation, still has some dignity left in them. Yomi Fabiyi and wife during their wedding 4 years ago \n“I have also been raised to know that no matter how small the interactions I have with anybody, I should not let my manners slip. It cost nothing but could win a whole lot of goodwill. Moreso, I have been vigorously warned by my parents never to prove to know if what am ready to give out is a guess. \nPAY ATTENTION: Get all the latest gossips on NAIJ Gossip App \n“Hopefully Fran accepts my proposition to end this marriage now as I cannot continue this way, AM NOT HAPPY anymore as we edge close to the 4th year anniversary. Fran is such a beautiful woman, supportive and wish I come live in England, take up employmemt and study. I HAVE USED HER DOCUMENTS TO RENEW MY NORMAL VISA ONLY, so no question she is not willing, I NEVER said that. With all humility, if she never promised me she is coming to take up employment in Nigeria and live with me, maybe we may not have secured the dating. I have made it abundantly clear I am not prepared to live abroad as my career was just gathering shape then. I decor wedding hall Nigeria colour on purpose. Yomi Fabiyi and Wife \n“The outlook of my choice may look familiar to those marriages but I never thought people will think of me that way. I have to live with that but sometimes it can be so bruising. \n“I am focused on my career and keeping my fans and admirers entertained. I have an absolute right to do whatever makes me happy provided it is nothing criminal, illegal, immoral or anti-social. I am NOT interested with the reason two adult came together. It’s crude and an uncivilized thing to do for me. I HOPE I FIND TRUE LOVE AGAIN WHILE I PUSH FOR A HIT-FREE DIVORCE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. I will be fine guys. Thank you – Yomi Fabiyi” \nNawa oh!",

The report said the meeting lasted for about one hour. President Buhari has met Saraki again \nAfter the meeting, the Senate president reportedly left the villa without speaking with journalists. \nThere had been moves lately by the presidency to cement the frosty relationship that existed between the executive and the legislative arms of government. \nREAD ALSO: Saraki, Ekweremadu reveal what they discussed with Buhari \nThe Senate recently threw away the plan by the government to borrow $29.9 billion after picking holes in the president’s letter. \nThe upper legislative chamber also described the 2017 to 2019 Medium Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) forwarded by President Buhari for approval as empty. \nMany senators were also reported to have accused the president of refusing to carry the National Assembly along in the scheme of things. \nThis meeting is the third in the last two weeks.",

      "text": "By Sidney Fussell \nOne of Facebook’s most controversial features was curtailed Friday—but not killed. \nFacebook announced to USA Today that it would end “ethnic affinity” targeted advertising of certain types of ads after meetings with the Congressional Black Caucus, Congressional Hispanic Caucus, and advocacy groups like the ACLU and National Fair Housing Alliance. \n“We are going to turn off, actually prohibit, the use of ethnic affinity marketing for ads that we identify as offering housing, employment and credit,” Erin Egan, Facebook’s vice president of U.S. public policy, told the publication. \nFacebook assigns an “ethnic affinity” (or race) to some users based on the posts they like and share and their profile information. The affinities include Hispanic American, African American and Asian American. As first reported by Propublica, advertisers could target or exclude users based on those designations (which could only be seen if users went looking in their ad profiles). The feature prompted a class action lawsuit wherein plaintiffs allege the targeting violates the Civil Rights Act. Facebook countered that it doesn’t actually collect racial data on users and will fight against the suit. \nBlocking exclusion by ethnic affinity when it comes to job, housing, and credit opportunities is a necessary step, but it doesn’t mean racial targeting by proxy will end on the platform. Users will continue to be assigned an ethnic affinity and advertisers will still be able to exclude or include users based on it. And this isn’t limited to Facebook. Other digital advertising networks also assign probable race to users and allow advertisers to target them accordingly. \nIt’s less outrageous that white users may see ads for different movies or clothing than Asian or Hispanic users, but the problem of inaccuracy in the collection of information remains. When Fusion asked users to screencap their ad preferences , Facebook made dozens of inferences about things like their religion and sexual orientation, often getting it wrong, like identifying white users as African American, misidentifying LGBT allies as queer themselves, and even implying a Jewish journalist was “interested in” a militant terrorist organization. So per @sidneyfussell I looked for my \"ethnic affinity\" \nhighlights: \nJoe Lieberman = \"American Jewish culture\"\"Hezbollah\" \n— Rafi Letzter (@RafiLetzter) October 28, 2016 \nFacebook policy change is welcome, but doesn’t address the larger problem of incorrect inferences made via metadata collection. On the bright side, Facebook does allow you to make changes to your advertising profile, if you’re willing to go look for it . Story Tags",

(Photo: Eric Christian Smith, AP) \nThis happened 10 years ago. I had just finished covering the Detroit Lions’ 31-24 loss to the New York Jets at the Meadowlands in 2006. The Lions had fallen to 1-6 and appeared headed to another terrible season. (They finished 3-13. Another lost season amid a seemingly endless sea of lost seasons.) \nA few Detroit reporters shared a cab back to the hotel. One veteran writer who had witnessed decades of failure said, “This team has just never had any luck.” \nIt was my first year covering the Lions. I thought it wasn’t true. It couldn’t be true. It was just the whiny rhetoric of a tired sports writer. \nThat is, after all, kind of our thing. \nBut the guy was right. And I’ve thought a lot about that in the decade since. There just hasn’t been a season in which things broke right a lot more often than they broke wrong for the Lions. They’ve never had that magical year of luck. Next year will mark the 60th anniversary of their last championship. Sixtieth! \nLook, I grew up in Los Angeles, and we had our version of the Lions. In fact, we had three versions of the Lions. They were called the Rams, the Angels and the Kings. I figured if you couldn’t win a Super Bowl with Deacon Jones, Merlin Olsen and Eric Dickerson, a World Series with Nolan Ryan, Rod Carew and Reggie Jackson, nor a Stanley Cup with Wayne Gretzky, Larry Robinson and Luc Robitaille, you just weren’t going to win. Ever. \nThen the Rams turned a grocery store stock boy into a Super Bowl MVP quarterback. The Angels found the Rally Monkey. The Kings turned to a new coach during the season and won their first Cup as a No. 8 seed. \nSo what about this year, the year of miracle comebacks? The Cavaliers, the Cubs, the election . The Lions? It seems like anything is possible. Preseason predictions? Exit polls? Does anything really mean anything anymore? \nGreen Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers finally has regressed to being human, the Minnesota Vikings’ offense is being held together by duct tape and a staple gun, the Chicago Bears are the Bears. \nSo in the past few days, I’ve conducted extensive exit polling — and even a little entrance polling. I’ve constructed several probabilistic models and mostly have avoided getting glue on my hands. And I can confidently report the following: I see a path for the Lions to get to the Super Bowl. \n• Nov. 20 vs. Jacksonville Jaguars. The Lions win, 20-17, and improve to 6-4. Jalen Ramsey holds Marvin Jones to negative-1 receptions. When reporters ask Lions coach Jim Caldwell how that's possible, Caldwell just shakes his head, smiles and says, “I know you guys have to ask these questions, but we can’t get everyone the ball.” \n• Nov. 24 vs. Minnesota Vikings. Hey, man, Aretha Franklin is singing the national anthem , and the Lions ain't gonna lose to no stinkin’ Vikings on Thanksgiving in front of the Queen! All right? ALL RIGHT? Lions improve to 7-4. \n• Dec. 4 at New Orleans Saints. The Saints have Drew Brees, beignets and a terrible defense. Sorry, Ain’ts. Lions win, 30-28, and improve to 8-4. \n• Dec. 11 vs. Chicago Bears. Jay Cutler — I just threw up in my mouth a little after typing that. Lions win, 27-9, and improve to 9-4. Football party decorations start to disappear from Detroit stores. \n• Dec. 18 at New York Giants. The train finally stops. Eli Manning puts on a blindfold, trips and throws a Hail Mary as time expires to beat the Lions, 20-17. The Lions drop to 9-5. \n• Dec. 26 at Dallas Cowboys. Dak Prescott throws four touchdowns, but league and game officials are late leaving Stephen Jones ’ party bus before the game and only see three of the TDs. Matthew Stafford yells “home cookin’!” at the crowd. 'Boys win, 30-17. Lions drop to 9-6. \n• Jan. 1 vs. Green Bay Packers. This time, it’s Stafford who makes the 60-yard javelin throw into the end zone. Eric Ebron catches the last-second touchdown for a 27-23 win. The Lions finish 10-6 and win the NFC North. The entire Lower Peninsula calls in sick Monday morning. \n• Playoffs. The Lions are the No. 4 seed. They beat the Giants in the wild-card round, upset the Cowboys in the divisional round and beat the Seattle Seahawks in the NFC title game, when Golden Tate scores the winning touchdown by doing cartwheels into the end zone , followed by an interpretive dance that would make Isadora Duncan proud. \n• Feb. 5 vs. New England Patriots in Super Bowl LI at Houston. Before the game, Lions general manager Bob Quinn finds Tom Brady and offers an enthusiastic, “Hi, Tom! Good luck today!” To which Brady responds with a blank look and an uncertain, “Hey, you.” The Patriots pull it out, 45-10. Commissioner Roger Goodell can’t hand Brady the Lombardi Trophy because he's \"stuck in an elevator.\" The Lions sign Caldwell to a five-year extension two days later. \nThe next season, in the 60th anniversary of their 1957 NFL championship, the Lions finish 3-13.",

Facebook incorrectly flagged some people's profile pages with a message saying that the person was deceased . And it looks like the glitch was pretty widespread: even founder Mark Zuckerberg had apparently ceased to be. A banner at the top of his profile page read, \"We hope people who love Mark will find comfort in the thing others share to remember and celebrate his life.\" A number of Engadget staffers had passed on as well; we weren't just pining. \nBut it seemed to be on whoever was viewing the page, and not individual accounts -- a few of us didn't see any issues when scrolling through the social network's pages. We've reached out to Facebook for more information and will update this post should it arrive.",

      "text": "Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg doesn't believe that fake news on his social network influenced the election.\nBut recent findings from the Pew Research Center suggest the opposite is true, as 20 percent of social media users say they've changed their stance on a political issue because of something they saw on sites like Facebook. The shift was usually pessimistic.\nSEE ALSO: Facebook is the most powerful force online — and these new numbers prove it\n\"People who said they had changed their minds on [the presidential] candidates often said that social media pointed their opinion in a more negative direction,\" Pew research associate Monica Anderson said in a post about the survey that was published Monday.\n\"Respondents who indicated they had changed their minds about Clinton were more than three times as likely to say that their opinion changed in a negative direction rather than a positive one (24% vs. 7%), and respondents who mentioned Trump were nearly five times as likely to say that their opinion became more negative as opposed to more positive (19% vs. 4%),\" she added.\nThe findings are pulled from more extensive Pew research on politics and social media that was published last month. The surveys behind that research were completed earlier this year, long before Election Day, so it's impossible to state with any certainty that shifting opinions translated into political action.\nStill, the anecdotes collected by Pew reinforce the logical notion that some people are impacted by the information they see online.\nSEE ALSO: Facebook failed America this year — now it should kill the News Feed\nHere are a couple of the responses from Pew's survey-takers — 4,579 random U.S. adults who live in households and are representative of the national population:\n\"Trump continues to voice his opinion incredibly ignorantly about immigration and made my respect for him tank.\"\n\"All the videos circulating about Hillary Clinton and her email debauchery. Now I think she is even more evil and corrupt than originally thought.\"\n\"Videos of black people being murdered by police made me more angry and therefore more outspoken about Black Lives Matter.\"\n\"I saw some of my friends were animated about left-leaning things like Bernie Sanders and gay marriage. Originally I was against gay marriage and have now accepted it.\"\nNote that none of the responses included in Pew's report indicate that the individuals surveyed had been exposed to — or swayed by — fake news reports. In fairness, that's somewhat beside the point: The question is fundamentally about whether people can be influenced by information they see on social media. If the answer is yes, then we should believe in the power of viral hoaxes when they spread on social media.\nWho are these people? With varying margins of error, Pew's sample, at a 95 percent level of confidence, included 3,571 social media users, 3,163 of which were Facebook users. Of that population of social media users, 1,557 said they were Republican or Republican-leaning, while 1,929 were Democrats or leaning in that direction.\nSelf-identified liberal Democrats were most likely to say they'd changed their minds on a political or social issue because of something they saw on social media, at 25 percent overall. Thirteen percent of conservative Republicans said the same.\nDo keep in mind that the overwhelming majority — 82 percent — of the individuals surveyed said they never changed their opinion of a candidate because of social media.\nThat said, the race for electoral votes was incredibly close in swing states this year, as we see via Google Trends:\nImage: Google\nDid information shared on Facebook, including hoaxes, make a difference in these states? Impossible to say — but let's not pretend the notion is absurd.",

Due to some incredible bug on @Facebook , everyone I know is dead, including me.

      "text": "It’s a fitting end to a strange week. When many Facebook users logged on to their accounts on Friday afternoon, they discovered the social network had declared them to be deceased.\nThe lethal online epidemic is causing Facebook FB to display a small memorial message above users’ regular homepage profile. In the case of my editor, Rachel King, Fortune tech writers who visited her page discovered a “Remembering Rachel King” message, and a wish to remember to remember and celebrate her life.\nI can assure you that Rachel is very much alive (and reminding me about the Oxford comma). But if you’re wondering what it looks like, here’s a screenshot:\n\nI’m still alive (for now) but it appears the bug is spreading quickly to others in the media, and has reportedly even affected the pages of Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg.\nFacebook did not immediately return a request for comment.\nWhile Friday’s wave of Facebook fatalities is clearly a bug or a hoax of some sort, the social network does offer a function that allows people to turn the profile pages of loved ones into a “Memorial.”\nFortune will update when the company tells us what’s going on but, in the meantime, the incident is already giving rise to predictable jibes on Twitter:\nGod is dead. – Nietzche, 1883\nNietzche is dead. – God, 1900\nEveryone is dead. – Facebook, 2016\n— Ryan Calo (@rcalo) November 11, 2016 \nFacebook is telling people they're dead pic.twitter.com/kdIKijT5Nw \n— Brian Hart (@VR_BHart) November 11, 2016 \n\nSo enjoy the end of your week everyone – and possibly your last day on earth.",

      "text": "Continue reading the main story Photo Facebook users can check the ad preferences in their accounts to see whether they have been assigned an “ethnic affinity.” Marketers placing housing, employment or credit advertisements on Facebook will no longer be able to use tools that target people by ethnicity, reflecting concern that the company was violating anti-discrimination laws. “There are many nondiscriminatory uses of our ethnic affinity solution in these areas, but we have decided that we can best guard against discrimination by suspending these types of ads,” Erin Egan, Facebook’s chief privacy officer, said in a blog post on Friday. An article by ProPublica published last month reported that advertisers could use Facebook targeting to exclude certain races, or what the company calls “ethnic affinities,” from housing and employment ads, potentially putting the social network in violation of the Fair Housing Act of 1968 and the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The article prompted scrutiny from civil rights groups and policy makers, including the American Civil Liberties Union and four members of Congress, and a class-action lawsuit. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story The decision casts a perhaps unwelcome spotlight onto what Facebook calls its “ethnic affinity marketing solution,” which is still available for use outside the areas of housing, employment and credit advertising. One of Facebook’s main draws for marketers is how narrowly they can target messages to its users. Ads can be sent to people based not only on standard demographics like age, gender and location, but also on a bevy of other factors, like whether they have an anniversary coming, their interest in horseback riding, whether they use Gmail or Hotmail, and the languages they speak. Users can also be excluded from seeing ads based on this data. Photo Facebook’s “ethnic affinity” classifications include four categories of Hispanics. While much of this information is provided voluntarily by users, ethnic affinity is one demographic offered to marketers that users cannot choose, but it is instead assigned based on their interests and activities on Facebook. That includes page likes, group memberships and friendships, the company said. You can list your religious views and languages on your Facebook profile, but you can’t self-identify as, say, Asian-American. On Facebook’s ad-buying website, however, advertisers can choose to include or exclude certain demographic “affinities” from ads in the United States. For instance, they can exclude African-American, Asian-American and four “types” of Hispanic — bilingual, English-dominant, Spanish-dominant or all of the above. Facebook lists the number of people who match those affinities within its ads tool. For example, if an advertiser wants to reach all Americans ages 18 and up on Facebook, hovering over “African-American (U.S.)” shows that there are 26 million people with that “ethnic affinity.” The company confirmed that because the assignment is based on activity, a white person could be targeted as an African-American and vice versa. Facebook users can visit their Ad Preferences and see what, if any, ethnic affinity is assigned to them under their “lifestyle and culture” interests, and remove it if they want, the company said. A reporter who is Indian-American did not have “Asian-American” listed under her interests in that section. A colleague, who is Hispanic and speaks primarily English, had “Ethnic affinity: African-American (U.S.)” listed under descriptions like “away from family” and “books.” In her blog post, Ms. Egan wrote that this type of targeting “gives brands a way to reach multicultural audiences with more relevant advertising.” In addition to tools that will disable ethnic affinity marketing for housing, employment or credit ads, Facebook will “require advertisers to affirm that they will not engage in discriminatory advertising” on the site and offer them information so they “understand their obligations with respect to housing, employment and credit.” This is hardly the first time Facebook has dealt with intense scrutiny over its ad-targeting practices. In 2013, Facebook paid $20 million to settle a class-action lawsuit against the company for sharing data with advertisers about users’ “likes” without asking permission. The same year, a lawsuit accused the company of scanning users’ private messages on the network and using the information for advertising purposes. In September of this year, a federal judge in California ruled against a bid to certify the case as a class-action lawsuit. The changes to Facebook’s “ethnic affinity marketing solution” will very likely deal a difficult blow to the company’s longstanding boasts about its superior ad-targeting capabilities, especially in the face of competitors like Google, Twitter and Snapchat. Shares of Facebook closed down 1.5 percent on Friday.",

      "text": "Enlarge this image CEO Mark Zuckerberg defended Facebook against criticism that it doesn't vet fake news in its News Feed. Lluis Gene/AFP/Getty Images hide caption \ntoggle caption Lluis Gene/AFP/Getty Images CEO Mark Zuckerberg defended Facebook against criticism that it doesn't vet fake news in its News Feed.\nLluis Gene/AFP/Getty Images Mark Zuckerberg says the notion that fake news influenced the U.S. presidential election is \"a pretty crazy idea.\"\nThe Facebook CEO is finding himself in a unique position in this election cycle. Many news organizations have come under fire for their coverage of the campaign. Now Facebook is getting it too, as a modern media company that does not vet fake news from its News Feed and that, critics argue, allows users to stay in information bubbles that reinforce existing prejudices.\nZuckerberg took both these criticisms head on yesterday, at a conference called Techonomy . (You can find the full interview on his Facebook feed .)\nPolitics Did Social Media Ruin Election 2016? He says hoaxes existed before his platform was created. They aren't new, and people who say misinformation is why Donald Trump won simply do not get it. \"There's a profound lack of empathy in asserting that the only reason why someone could have voted the way that they did is because they saw some fake news,\" Zuckerberg says.\nHe also says his company has studied fake news and found it's a \"very small volume\" of the content on Facebook. He did not specify if that content is more or less viral or impactful than others.\nWeeks back Facebook algorithms accidentally promoted to \"trending news\" a fake story about Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly pledging her support for Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.\nArticle continues after sponsorship All Tech Considered In Wake Of Shootings, Facebook Struggles To Define Hate Speech Zuckerberg also said his team has studied the filter bubble effect and the research shows that almost everyone has some friend on the other side of the aisle. A Democrat may think there's no Republican in their News Feed, but there likely is. The social network's ability to connect people makes it \"inherently more diverse\" than the major news stations of 20 years back, Zuckerberg says.\nHe says right now the problem is not that diverse information isn't there. It's there more than it was in the days of traditional media. The problem, he says, is that people don't click on things that don't conform to their worldview. And, he says, \"I don't know what to do about that.\"\nFacebook is not a free speech platform. It has a long list of rules, called Community Standards , of things you're not allowed to say or share. Naked pictures of children are a well-known example.\nAll Tech Considered With 'Napalm Girl,' Facebook Humans (Not Algorithms) Struggle To Be Editor During this election cycle, Zuckerberg personally intervened to change the rules. When Trump called for a ban on all Muslims, it was clearly hate speech, as defined by Facebook guidelines. But the CEO ordered his staff to not take it down because it was newsworthy.\nThat example is just one illustration of the extraordinary power Zuckerberg has amassed to decide what news is. And from his talk, it's clear that he's thinking about how to wield this power.\n\"When we started, the north star for us was: we're building a safe community,\" Zuckerberg says. He thought about how to control for bullies. One of the things that has shifted, he says, is that now news is a more important part of Facebook content. \"We're still working through what that means.\"\nAll Tech Considered An App Saw Trump Winning Swing States When Polls Didn't",

      "text": "The bug even \"killed\" Mark Zuckerberg + READ ARTICLE \nIt’s a fitting end to a strange week. When many Facebook users logged on to their accounts on Friday afternoon, they discovered the social network had declared them to be deceased. \nThe lethal online epidemic is causing Facebook to display a small memorial message above users’ regular homepage profile. In the case of my editor, Rachel King, Fortune tech writers who visited her page discovered a “Remembering Rachel King” message, and a wish to remember to remember and celebrate her life. \nI can assure you that Rachel is very much alive (and reminding me about the Oxford comma). But if you’re wondering what it looks like, here’s a screenshot: Screenshot \nI’m still alive (for now) but it appears the bug is spreading quickly to others in the media, and has reportedly even affected the pages of Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg. \nFacebook did not immediately return a request for comment. \nWhile Friday’s wave of Facebook fatalities is clearly a bug or a hoax of some sort, the social network does offer a function that allows people to turn the profile pages of loved ones into a “Memorial.” \nFortune will update when the company tells us what’s going on but, in the meantime, the incident is already giving rise to predictable jibes on Twitter: God is dead. – Nietzche, 1883 \nNietzche is dead. – God, 1900 \nEveryone is dead. – Facebook, 2016 \n— Ryan Calo (@rcalo) November 11, 2016 Facebook is telling people they're dead pic.twitter.com/kdIKijT5Nw \n— Brian Hart (@VR_BHart) November 11, 2016 \nSo enjoy the end of your week everyone – and possibly your last day on earth.",

      "text": "\nIf you went to a friend’s Facebook profile, or even your own, sometime earlier today, you may have been surprised that the social network had declared your friend, or yourself, as being dead. Memorial banners were briefly online on many users pages today, but this appears to just be a server glitch.\nSee also: 10 best Facebook apps for Android June 18, 2016 \nAll of the banners had the same kind of message, saying, “We hope people who love (name) will find comfort in the things others share to remember and celebrate (his/her) life.” As Business Insider shows, even Facebook CEO and founder Mark Zuckerberg’s official profile page was not immune to this rather spooky server bug.\nThe glitch started appearing just after 3 p.m Eastern time today, but by 4 p.m. it had apparently been resolved. So if you saw a friend’s page turn into a memorial for his or her life, the chances are he or she is still very much alive. Facebook has not yet revealed what caused this server bug, but we would certainly hope they will take measures to not have this happen en masse again.\nDid you encounter this “Remembering” bug on your Facebook profile? If so, what was your first immediate reaction? Let us know in the comments!",

(Facebook) Updated:   4:32 PM \nFacebook users who accessed their profiles on Friday afternoon found rumors of their own demise. \nIn a widespread glitch portraying even Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg as dead, users’ profiles appeared in the “remembering” format. \n“We hope people who love Mark will find comfort in the things others share to remember and celebrate his life,” a banner above his public profile said. \nRepresentatives for Facebook didn't immediately respond to requests for comment on Friday. — Hadas Gold (@Hadas_Gold) November 11, 2016 \nCompany executives told Politico reporter Hadas Gold the change \"appears to be a bug, not compromised accounts,\" Gold tweeted . \nWord of the glitch spread on social media Friday as users mocked the social media giant by posting photos of their profiles. \n\"In the meantime though APPARENTLY FACEBOOK THINKS I'M DEAD,\" one Twitter user said .

Around 60% of people get their news from social media, including Facebook, according to one survey . \n“Personally I think the idea that fake news on Facebook, which is a very small amount of the content, influenced the election in any way — I think is a pretty crazy idea,” Zuckerberg said.

Twitter/@peterstringer \nFacebook users were forced to do a double take on Friday as they leisurely scoped out their friends’ profiles. \nAt the top of the page, some people, including verified users, reported seeing memorial banners. \nThe problem: the person memorialized wasn’t actually dead. \n“We hope people who love [Facebook user] will find comfort in the things others share to remember and celebrate [his or her] life,” the banner read. \nThe switch to memorial pages left users shocked and confused. \n“Having a tough day today, but not dead, just in case Facebook tries to claim that I am,” one user posted. \n“I’m still alive at the moment!” another person exclaimed. \nEven Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg fell victim to the apparent bug. Facebook Thursday: Fake news is not a problemFacebook Friday: Mark Zuckerberg is dead. Your friends are dead. We are all dead. — Julia Carrie Wong (@juliacarriew) November 11, 2016 Cool.

Many users of the popular social network have reported seeing a banner pop up on their Facebook profiles, reading “Remembering So-and-so” and asking their friends to “find comfort” in the things people are sharing. (Image: Facebook) \nIt’s not clear what’s causing the bug—which is presumably related to the service’s “memorialized accounts” feature—but the virtual body count seems staggeringly high, ignoring such factors as fame, social status, or even whether someone is the founder of Facebook himself: (Image: Facebook) \nLuckily, we all learned earlier today that Facebook can’t actually impact anything in the real world, so we can rest assured in the knowledge that it doesn’t really matter if the service thinks we’re alive or dead. \nSend your Newswire tips to Filed Under: AUX, Facebook More Newswire",

      "text": "Nov 11, 2016 10:44 AM (Photo: David Ramos/Getty Images) Share Tweet \nFollowing the election of Donald Trump to the presidency of these United States of America—still getting used to that—there have been well-reasoned arguments that Facebook and its ability to spread fake news had a role in the result. But Mark Zuckerberg is not having that. \nAccording to a report from TechCrunch , Zuckerberg disavowed the notion that News Feed had anything to do with the country swinging in Trump’s favor while speaking at the Techonomy16 conference. “I’ve seen some of the stories you are talking about around this election and personally I think the idea that fake news on Facebook, of which it’s a very small amount of the content, influenced the election in any way is a pretty crazy idea,” he said. “You know voters make decisions based on their lived experience. We really believe in people. You don’t generally go wrong when you trust that people understand what they care about and what’s important to them and you build systems that reflect that.” Zuckerberg ultimately concluded that the problem his company needs to tackle isn’t false information, but getting people to “engage with” a wider variety of it. \nThis response would only serve to prove Max Read’s point in a New York magazine piece that : “Facebook has seemed both uninterested in and incapable of even acknowledging that it has become the most efficient distributor of misinformation in human history.” All together now: MARK! \nSend your Newswire tips to",

The notices seem to have first appeared at around 3:45 Eastern time.\nThe wording was the same in all cases. For instance: \"Remembering Mark Zuckerberg. We hope people who love Mark will find comfort in the things others share to remember and celebrate his life. Learn more about memorialized accounts and the legacy contact setting on Facebook.\"\nThe notices disappeared shortly after.\nA query to Facebook asking for comment was not immediately returned.\nFacebook allows loved ones to “memorialize” the account of someone who had died, to allows their family and friends to remember the person and pay tribute to the life they life.\nIn a posting in 2011 , Facebook’s Chengos Fei wrote about the option.\n“We hope that by allowing the people who use our service a chance to mourn together and remember someone who passed away, people can find comfort in sharing happy and heartwarming stories about their departed friend or family member.\"\nGo to MSN Home",

      "text": "Mark Zuckerberg denies Facebook helped elect Donald Trump By Noah Kulwin on Nov 11, 2016 In response to concerns that Facebook may have affected the election and spread false information, Mark Zuckerberg, the company’s CEO and co-founder, has a simple message: Don’t blame us.\n“Personally I think the idea that fake news on Facebook, which is a very small amount of the content, influenced the election in any way… is a pretty crazy idea,” Zuckerberg said in a public Q&A session at the annual Techonomy conference in California Thursday night. “Voters make decisions based on their lived experience.”\nOthers in the tech industry are less sure. Ev Williams, co-founder of Twitter and current chief of Medium, didn’t address Facebook by name but said that the way social and traditional media work together is “broken.”\n“I think the problem with talking about the role of social media in particular is its impact is impossible to separate from the rest of media,” Williams said over email. “Commercial media and social media play off of and multiply each other. They are deeply intertwined, and the whole thing is pretty broken.”\nZuckerberg might sound a little defensive because he’s feeling quite a bit of heat this week. Critics across academia, the press , and the tech industry have charged Facebook with enabling and profiting from the widespread dissemination of hyper-partisan fake news.\nThough fake news proliferated on both the Left and the Right during the presidential campaigns, a BuzzFeed News investigation earlier this year found that the leading right-wing Facebook pages published fake news in 38 percent of posts (the figure was 20 percent for left-wing pages). If you’re interested in what a real-time visualization of this looks like, the Wall Street Journal’s “Blue Feed, Red Feed” project is a good place to start.\nFor people like Indiana University professor Fil Menczer , who studies the effect and travel of misinformation, the potential damage Facebook has wrought is troubling, and Facebook’s disinclination to do anything about it, even moreso.\n“There is no way of establishing whether online misinformation played a pivotal role in the election results. This is itself worrisome — our democratic process might be manipulated by abuse of social media, and we don’t know,” Menczer told VICE News in an email. “What we do know is that there is an industry of fake news. We also know from our research that misinformation is just as likely to go viral as reliable information. And we know that abuse of social media is rampant.”\nIn his remarks Thursday night, Zuckerberg turned this line of criticism back on the critics. He said that to assert the possibility of fake news’ swaying voters’ behavior in the election suggested “a certain profound lack of empathy.”\nBut Zuckerberg may be missing a more tactical and cynical approach among some of his most controversial users. As Mike Cernovich, a Trump-supporting white supremacist with a large social media following, told The New Yorker last month, he calibrated his message to get picked up by TV networks, part of the “broken” process described by Ev Williams. From the article: “If [a story I share is] on Drudge, then it’s on ‘Hannity,’ ” Cernovich said. “If it’s on ‘Hannity,’ then Brian Stelter’s talking about it on CNN.”\nWhether Facebook will reckon with its role in spreading misinformation remains to be seen. Though Zuckerberg insists Facebook is a technology company and not a media company, a narrative that allows the company to abdicate any obligation to consider this problem, Facebook will sometimes discreetly back down once the uproar dissipates.\nProPublica last month reported that Facebook allows advertisers to exclude audiences by race and ethnicity, which poses a serious civil rights problem. At the time, a Facebook executive defended the tool as allowing consumers to see ads that are most relevant to them.\nEarlier on Friday morning, while everyone was still discussing Zuckerberg’s comments from the previous night, Facebook quietly revealed that it would disallow certain kinds of advertisers from using the feature.",

Late Friday afternoon many Facebook users had the rare privilege of attending their own memorial, so to speak, when the social media giant unleashed its legacy profile feature.\nZuck dead pic.twitter.com/J8y5LbfQBz\n— Steve Kovach (@stevekovach) November 11, 2016\nIn promoting its memorial feature, meant to celebrate the profiles of people who have passed away, the social network accidentally posted a banner at the top of many active user profiles saying that “We hope people who love [user] will find comfort in the things others share to remember and celebrate his life.”\nThere was an extinction level event on Facebook pic.twitter.com/xxkr1t1ptC\n— Anthony Quintano (@AnthonyQuintano) November 11, 2016\nOf course, Facebook didn’t actually kill anyone off, and by 4 p.m. the issue appeared to be resolved, and users were once again digitally present.\nA representative for the company did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nCover: Screengrab via Facebook",
