      "title": "[Video] Amazon’s Grab-And-Go Grocery Store − There's No Need To Line Up At A Cashier, Simply Walk Out The Door",
      "text": "View Comments Imagine not having to queue up to pay for your groceries anymore – that’s exactly the concept of Amazon’s latest service. With the \"just walk out technology\" as they call it, Amazon Go, literally allows customers to enter the store, grab what they want and walk out without ever having to stand in a checkout line. Using the Amazon app, customers will walk in and tap their phones at the entrance, and the machine will automatically sense and track items customers pick up. The technology of this virtual cart will also be able to sense if items are removed from the cart. There will also be cameras following the customer around and watching the shelf to determine whether multiples of the same item are taken, or if items are consumed. Once the customer walks out, the app will charge their Amazon account. However, if Amazon is not confident about how many items you took or what you took, they may end up confirming with you. Phil Lempert, a food marketing expert based in Los Angeles calls the technology “amazing”. \"When you look at the store itself in the video (and presumably it is the actual store), they have done a great job of merchandising, and having \"meal kits\" available is simply brilliant. As the meal-kit industry struggles due to the shipping/logistics aspect, Amazon Go could be a venue where they could succeed,\" said Lempert, reported by USA TODAY. Analyst Jan Dawson of Jackdaw Research says this could be a game changer for supermarkets. \"If there were hundreds of these stores around the country, it would be a huge threat\" to supermarket chains. \"The ease with which you can shop a website, the same thing is going to happen for physical stores,\" he told CBC. Currently, it has only been open to Amazon employees but the Seattle-based company says the store in the same location will be open to the public in early 2017. Watch the video below, and be amazed at this advanced shopping technology.",

One of the retailer’s Twitter account mentioned the news, while adding that consumers can expect to hear something “in the coming week.” \nThe tweet reads: NES Classic fans: we've got a couple exciting announcements to make in the coming week. Stay tuned for more info soon! \n— Amazon Video Games (@amazongames) December 7, 2016 \nAt the very least, it’d make sense if one of these announcements were about a restock.

      "title": "Target Will Get HUGE Shipment of Hatchimals This Weekend - Including Bearakeet",
      "text": "Posted: Dec 6 2016, 8:51pm CST | by Noel Diem , in News | Toys \nDon't Miss: Amazon 12 Days of Deals Sale \nIt has been a week since Toys R Us stores received surprise shipments of Hatchimals that created a pandemonium in stores and online, and now Target says that it will get a large shipment of the holiday's must-have toys as well. Don't Miss: Victoria's Secret Fashion Show 2016 \nStarting this Sunday, December 11, 2016, every Target store, our source at a local Target confirms, will receive DOZENS of Hatchimals. Even better, they will get more throughout the week. There will be a limit of two per guest, so you won't have to worry too much about people scooping them all up before you get there. Still, the supplies won't last all that long, so you have to check your local store, as they won't say what time they'll be released. \nHatchimals are furry, interactive toys that hatch out of an egg after you activate them. They have been one of the most difficult to find toys of the 2016 Christmas season. They have been sold out all over the world for weeks, and eBay and Amazon have seen prices going into the hundreds of dollars. Some sellers were able to stock up on Hatchimals and make a killing, while other parents have been struggling to find a toy. \nIf you aren't able to get to a nearby Target, you should also watch the secondary market. It is likely that the prices will go down now that more and more people will be able to get the toy. \nTarget is even expected to have the elusive Bearakeet Hatchimal - a bear and parakeet hybrid that is exclusive to Target. \nOur source at Target said that there will be lines outside of Target in the morning and they are already preparing for the extra traffic. Competition to get the Hatchimals will still be fierce, and anyone who really wants one needs to hurry and get to the store immediately.",

(Source: Amazon/CNN) \n(CNN) - A grocery store with no checkout lines sounds like a dream, but Amazon is making it a reality. \nThe online giant unveiled a new brick and mortar store where it sells grocery essentials and pre-made meals. \nCustomers check in at the entrance of the store using the Amazon Go app. \nShoppers can then grab whatever they want and just exit the store when they're done. \nAmazon said it tracks purchases using computer vision and advanced sensor technology. \nThe first store is in Seattle, where Amazon is headquartered. \nRight now, the store is only open to Amazon employees. \nThe public can start shopping at Amazon Go stores early next year. \nCopyright 2016 CNN.

(AP Photo/Mark Lennihan) AP Tuesday, December 06, 2016 04:59PM NEW YORK -- Amazon is testing a grocery store model in Seattle that works without checkout lines.Called Amazon Go, shoppers scan their Amazon app when they enter the store, and then sensors register items that shoppers pick up and automatically charge them to the Amazon app.If a shopper puts the item back they aren't charged.Check out the video Amazon released Monday:The store offers ready-to-eat meals, staples like bread and milk and meal-making kits.The store is in testing and open to Amazon employees in a beta program. It is expected to open to the public in early 2017.The e-commerce powerhouse has also been dipping its toe into the physical realm. It has opened three bookstores in California, Oregon and Washington with traditional check outs. Two more are in the works in Illinois and Massachusetts. Related Topics: ",

      "text": "December 6, 2016 - Business , Featured - Tagged: Christmas , Connecticut , webextra - no comments By JOSEPH PISANIAP Business Writer \nNEW YORK – Hop on a virtual sleigh ride to the North Pole. Stand on the “Naughty or Nice O’Meter.” Snap a selfie and see your face on a dancing elf. The Santa experience has gotten a makeover as many malls install shows and games they hope will lure shoppers who are buying more online. \nAbout 40 malls in the U.S. including Westfarms mall in West Hartford, Conn., and one in London have the high-tech Santa displays, most of them located near major cities that tend to house pricier stores. Taking photos on Santa’s lap costs about $30 and up, around the same as at other malls, but most of the malls say people can walk through without purchasing anything. \n“It was a half-hour of entertainment that was free,” says Katie Mass, who took her twin daughters through Santa’s Flight Academy, a 3,000-square-foot setup at The Mall at Short Hills in New Jersey. \nThis Monday, Nov. 21, 2016, photo, shows Santa’s Flight Academy in Great Lakes Crossing Outlets in Auburn Hills, Mich. In an effort to lure online shoppers to their stores, many malls are upgrading the traditional visit to Santa into a high-tech spectacle.

The final stop was a two-story tall enclosed sleigh that dropped fake snow upon them. One girl made snow angels on the floor while her sister danced under the colorful lasers. “It was extravagant and well done,” says Mass. \nMalls are hoping the over-the-top Santa visits remind people what brick-and-mortar stores can offer. They’re increasingly trying to offer special experiences as they compete with online rivals, says Howard Davidowitz, chairman of New York-based retail consulting group Davidowitz & Associates. \n“The parents love it, the kids love it and Amazon can’t do it,” Davidowitz said. \nSanta’s Flight Academy was developed by mall operator Taubman Centers Inc., which spent two years on the idea. After testing it last year at The Mall of San Juan in Puerto Rico, the company rolled it out to 11 other Taubman malls this year, replacing a low-tech ice palace that had housed Santa for years. Like other malls with elaborate Santa sets, Taubman declined to say how much it spent on Santa’s Flight Academy. \nGuy Perry, a manager of a Disney Store at Taubman’s Westfarms mall in West Hartford, Conn., credited this year’s “great” store traffic to Santa’s Flight Academy. Kids come into the store and tell him how they helped Santa take flight. \n“It is getting a lot of good reviews,” says Perry. \nAn old-school Santa display got the boot at Queens Center in New York as the mall this year installed Santa HQ, a set sponsored by cable TV channel HGTV. \nAs kids stand on the “Naughty or Nice O’Meter,” they can watch their names pop up on Santa’s “Nice List” screen. In another room they can take a selfie and see themselves as dancing elves. In the last room, they’re handed tablets that use augmented reality technology to make it appear as if cartoon elves are popping out of the walls and packing gifts. The entire set and trees put on a light show every 20 minutes that is synchronized with holiday music. \nQuite a difference from last year’s Santa setup: A couch and some Christmas trees. \n“It’s Santa-meets-21st-century-technology,” says John Scaturro, a marketing manager for the mall. \nQueens Center’s owner, Macerich Co., first installed Santa HQ at some malls two years ago. This year, that expanded to 15 malls from 10. As of November, sales of photos with Santa at Queens Center nearly tripled from last year, says Scaturro. \nIn addition to bringing in shoppers, the set is an advertisement for HGTV. Screens air the network’s home improvement and real estate programs. Stars of its shows were set to sign autographs and take photos at two Macerich malls. \nIt’s cartoon characters that share the spotlight with Santa at another mall display, the DreamWorks DreamPlace. The set, created by DreamWorks Animation, stars characters from the movie studio’s “Kung Fu Panda” films – replacing the green ogre from the “Shrek” movies that were last year’s focus. Thirteen malls are using the set, which uses rumbling seats, wind and mist to create a virtual ride on Santa’s sleigh. \nWhatever malls are spending on the Santa spectacles is worth it, says Davidowitz. Santa has always attracted crowds, he says, but adding a high-tech twist is likely to bring in even more who may stop to shop. \n“I don’t see many things out there that equal Santa’s power to draw crowds,” he says. \nAssociated Press reporter Susan Haigh in Hartford contributed to this story.

      "text": "If your HDT 22 is connected to pin 6 like my board, try it out: /root/checkHumidity/bin/checkHumidity 6 HDT2249.301 Showing me 29.6 degrees C wilth 49.301% humidity! (2) Install Node.js on the Onion. From here on in, we will be using the opkg manager to install: opkg install nodejs (3) I also installed nano because it is my favourite editor on Linux. You can bypass this if you are happy with any other editor (Note: There is also an editor on the web interface, but I had some issues with saving on it): opkg install nano (4) Install the mosquitto app for MQTT conversations: opkg install mosquittoopkg install mosquitto-client This installs the mosquitto broker and client. We won’t really be using the broker, mainly the client, but it is handy to have if you want to set up your Onion as an MQTT bridge later. AMAZON IOT Ok, now we have almost everything prepped on the device itself, we need to set up a ‘thing’ on Amazon’s IoT cloud to mimic the Onion. The ‘thing’ you set up on Amazon acts as a cloud repository for information you want to store on your IoT device. Amazon uses a concept of a ‘shadow’ for the ‘thing’ that can store the data. That way, even if your physical ‘thing’ is powered off or offline, You can still send MQTT packets of data to the ‘thing’, and the data will be stored on the ‘shadow’ copy of the ‘thing’ in the cloud until the device comes back online, at which point Amazon can copy the ‘shadow’ data back to the physical device. You see, our Node.js app will be pushing temperature and humidity data to the shadow copy of the ‘thing’ in the cloud. From there, we can set up a rule on Amazon IoT to further push that data into a DynamoDB database. Setting up the ‘thing’ on the cloud can be a little tricky. Mainly due to the security. Because the physical device will be working unattended and pretty much anonymously, authentication is carried out using security certificates. Lets step through the creation of a ‘thing’. (Note: This tutorial assumes you already have an AWS account set up). From the Amazon Console, click on ‘Services’ on the top toolbar, then choose ‘AWS IoT’ under ‘Internet Of Things’. On the left hand menu, click on ‘Registry’, then ‘Things’. Your screen will probably be blank if you have never created a thing before. Click on ‘ Create ’ way over on the top right hand side of your screen. You will need to give you thing a name. Call it anything you like. I just used the unique name for my Omega Onion, which looks like Omega-XXXX . Great! Next, you will be taken to a screen showing all the information for your ‘thing’. Click on the ‘Security’ option on the left hand side. Click on the ‘ Create Certificate ’ button. You can now download all four certificates from this screen and store them in a safe place. NOTE : DON’T FORGET to click on the link for ‘A root CA for AWS IoT Download’. This is the Root CA certificate that we will need later. Store all 4 certificates in a safe place for now on your local hard drive. Don’t lose them or you will have to recreate the certificates again and re-attach policies etc. Messy stuff. Lastly, click on ‘ Activate ’ to activate your certificates and your thing. Next, we have to attach a policy to this certificate. There is a button marked ‘ Create Policy ’ on this security screen. Click it, and you will see the next screen asking you to create a new policy. We are going to create a simple policy that lets us perform any IoT action against any device. This is rather all encompassing, and in a production environment, you may want to restrict the policy down a little, but for the sake of this exercise, we will enable all actions to all devices under this policy: In the ‘ Action ’ field, enter ‘ iot:* ’ for all IoT actions, and in the ‘ Reource ARN ’ field, enter ‘ * ’ for all devices and topics etc. Don’t forget to tick the ‘ Allow ’ button below, then click ‘ Create ’. You now have a thing, a set of security certificates for the thing, and a policy to control the certificates against the thing. Hopefully the policy should be attached to the certificates that you just created. If not, you will have to manually attach the policy to the certificates. To do this, click on ‘ Security ’ on the left hand menu, then click on ‘ Certificates ’, then click on the certificate that you just created. Click on the ‘ Policies ’ on the left hand side of the certificate screen. If you see ‘ There are no policies attached to this certificate ’, then you need to attach it by clicking on the ‘ Actions ’ drop down on the top right, then choosing ‘ Attach Policy ’ from the drop down menu. Simply tick the policy you want to attach to this certificate, then click ‘ Attach ’. You may want to now click on ‘ Things ’ on the left hand menu to ensure that the thing you created is attached to the certificate as well. To ensure all your ducks are in a row:- The ‘thing’ -> needs to have -> Security Certificate(s) -> needs to be attached to -> A Policy Actually, there is one more factor that we want to note on here which is important for later. Go ahead and click on the ‘ Registry ’ then ‘ Things ’ on the IoT dashboard. Choose the thing you just created, and then click on the ‘ Interact ’ option on the left hand menu that pops up. Notice under HTTPS, there is a REST API endpoint shown. Copy this information down and keep it aside for now, because we will need it in our Node.js code later to specify which host we want to talk to. This host address is unique for each Amazon IoT account, so keep it safe and under wraps. Also note on this screen that there are some special Amazon IoT reserved topics that can be used to update or read the shadow copy of your IoT thing. We won’t really be using these in this project, but it is handy to know for more complex projects where you might have several devices talking to each other, and also devices that may go on and offline a lot. The ‘shadow’ feature allows you to still ‘talk’ to those devices even though they are offline or unavailable, and lets them sync up later. Very powerful stuff. Next, we will take a break from the IoT section, and set up a DynamoDB table to collect the data from the Onion. AMAZON DYNAMODB Click on ‘ Services ’ then ‘ Dynamo DB ’ under ‘Databases’. Click on ‘ Create Table ’. Give the table a meaningful name. Important: Give the partition key the name of ‘ id ’ and set it to a ‘ String ’ type. Tick the box that says ‘ Add sort key ’ and give the key a name of ‘ timestamp ’ and set it to a ‘ Number ’ type. This is very important, and you cannot change it later, so please ensure your setup looks like above. Tip : Once you have created your DynamoDB table, copy down the “Amazon Resource Name (ARN)” on the bottom of the table information screen (circled in red above). You will need this bit of information later when creating a security policy for reading data from this table to show on the web site chart. Ok, now that you have a table being created, you can go back to the Amazon IoT Dashboard again for the next step (‘ Services ’ then ‘ AWS IoT ’ in your console top menu). What we will do now is create a ‘Rule’ in IoT which will handball any data coming in to a certain topic across to DynamoDB to store in a data file. Tip : When you transmit data to an IoT thing using MQTT, you generally post the data to a ‘topic’. The topic can be anything you like. Amazon IoT has some reserved topic names that do certain things, but you can post MQTT packets to any topic name you make up on the spot. Your devices can also listen on a particular topic for data coming back from Amazon etc. MQTT is really quite a nice, powerful and simple way to interact with IoT devices and servers. In the IoT dashboard, click on ‘ Rules ’ on the left hand side, then click the ‘ Create ’ button. The ‘ Name ’ can be something distinctive that you make up. Add a ‘ Description ’ to help you remember what this rule does. For the ‘ SQL Version ’, just choose ‘ 2016–03–23 ’ which is the latest one at time of writing. Below that, on ‘ Attribute ’, type in ‘ * ’ because we will be selecting ALL fields sent to us. In the ‘ Topic Filter ’, type in ‘ temp-humidity/+ ’. This is the topic name that we will be listening out for. You can call it anything you like. We include a ‘ /+ ’ at the end of the topic name because we can add extra data after this, and we want the query to treat this extra data as a ‘wildcard’ and still select it. (Note: We will be adding the device name to the end of the topic as an identifier (e.g. temp-humidity/Omega-XXXX ). This way, if we later have multiple temperature/humidity sensors, we can identify each one via a different topic suffix, but still get all the data from all sensors sent to DynamoDB). ERRATA : The screenshot above shows ‘ temp-humidity ’ in the ‘Topic Filter’ field, but it should actually be ‘ temp-humidity/+ ’. Leave the ‘ Condition ’ blank. Now below this, you will see an ‘ Add Action ’ button. Click this, and choose ‘ Insert a message into a DynamoDB table ’. As you can see, there is a myriad of other things you can do, including on forwarding the data to another IoT device. But for now, we will just focus on writing the data and finishing there. Click on the ‘ Configure Action ’ button at the bottom of the screen. Choose the DynamoDB table we just created from the drop down ‘ Table Name ’. The ‘ Hash Key ’ should be ‘ id ’, of type ‘ STRING ’, and in the ‘ Hash Key Value ’, enter ‘ ${topic()} ’. It means we will be storing the topic name as the main key. The ‘ Range Key ’ should be ‘ timestamp ’ with a type of ‘ NUMBER ’. The ‘ Range Key Value ’ should be ‘ ${timestamp()} ’. This will place the contents of the packet timestamp in this field. Lastly, in the the ‘ Write Message Data To This Column ’, I enter in ‘ payload ’. This is the name of the data column that contains the object with the JSON data packet sent from the device. You can call this column anything you like, but I like to call it ‘ payload ’ or ‘ iotdata ’ or similar so that I know all the packet information is stored under here. One more thing to do, for security purposes, we have to set up an IAM role which will allow us to add data to the DynamoDB table. This is actually quite easy to do from here. Click the ‘ Create A New Role ’ button. Give the role a meaningful name, then click ‘ Create A New Role ’. A new button will show up with the text next to it saying ‘ Give AWS IoT permission to send a message to the selected resource ’. Click on the ‘ Update Role ’ button. Important : You must click the ‘Update Role’ button to set the privileges properly. Once completed, click the ‘Update’ button. Thats It! We are pretty much done as far as Amazon IoT and DynamoDB setup. It was quite a rigmarole wasn’t it? Lots of steps that have to be done in a certain order. But the good news is that once this is done, the rest of the project is quite easy, AND FUN! INSTALLING CERTIFICATES Oh, Wait — One more slightly tedious step to do. Remember those 4 certificates we downloaded much earlier? Now is the time we need to put them to good use (well, 3 out of the 4 at least). We need to copy these certificates to the Onion. I found it easiest to copy and paste the text contents of the certificate over onto the ‘ /home/certs ’ folder on the Onion. I simply used the web interface editor to create the files in the ‘ /home/certs ’ folder and paste the contents of the certificate I downloaded. The three certificates I needed (and which I copied and renamed) are: VeriSign-Class3-Public-Primary-Certification-Authority-G5.pem -> /home/certs/rootCA.pem x1234abcd56ef-certificate.pem.crt -> /home/certs/certificate.pem x1234abcd56ef-private.pem.key -> /home/certs/private.key As you can see, I shortened down the file name for ease of handling, and put them all into one folder for easy access from my Node.js app too. That’s it. Once done, you don’t have to muck about with certificates any more. Exactly where you store the certificates or what you call them is not important, you just need to know the details later when writing the Node.js script. WRITING CODE Ok, back to the Omega Onion now, where we will write the code to grab information from the HDT22 and transmit it to Amazon IoT. This is where the rubber hits the road. Using nano, or the web editor on the Onion, create a file called ‘ /home/app.js ’ and enter the following: var util = require('util'); ",

The Santa experience has gotten a makeover as many malls install shows and games they hope will lure shoppers who are buying more online. (AP Photo/Branden Camp) \nNEW YORK (AP) — Hop on a virtual sleigh ride to the North Pole. Stand on the \"Naughty or Nice O'Meter.\" Snap a selfie and see your face on a dancing elf. The Santa experience has gotten a makeover as many malls install shows and games they hope will lure shoppers who are buying more online. \nAbout 40 malls in the U.S. and one in London have the high-tech Santa displays, most of them located near major cities that tend to house pricier stores. Taking photos on Santa's lap costs about $30 and up, around the same as at other malls, but most of the malls say people can walk through without purchasing anything. \n\"It was a half-hour of entertainment that was free,\" says Katie Mass, who took her twin daughters through Santa's Flight Academy, a 3,000-square-foot setup at The Mall at Short Hills in New Jersey. \nShe had gone to the mall to return some dresses, but had to stop when her 2-year olds saw the spectacle. \"They started running,\" says the stay-at-home mom from Westfield, New Jersey. \nThe girls tapped touch screens, pulled levers and watched as flight suits were virtually fit over their bodies on a screen. The final stop was a two-story tall enclosed sleigh that dropped fake snow upon them. One girl made snow angels on the floor while her sister danced under the colorful lasers. \"It was extravagant and well done,\" says Mass. \nMalls are hoping the over-the-top Santa visits remind people what brick-and-mortar stores can offer. They're increasingly trying to offer special experiences as they compete with online rivals, says Howard Davidowitz, chairman of New York-based retail consulting group Davidowitz & Associates. \n\"The parents love it, the kids love it and Amazon can't do it,\" says Davidowitz. \nSanta's Flight Academy was developed by mall operator Taubman Centers Inc., which spent two years on the idea. After testing it last year at The Mall of San Juan in Puerto Rico, the company rolled it out to 11 other Taubman malls this year, replacing a low-tech ice palace that had housed Santa for years. Like other malls with elaborate Santa sets, Taubman declined to say how much it spent on Santa's Flight Academy. \nGuy Perry, a manager of a Disney Store at Taubman's Westfarms mall in West Hartford, Connecticut, credited this year's \"great\" store traffic to Santa's Flight Academy. Kids come into the store and tell him how they helped Santa take flight. \n\"It is getting a lot of good reviews,\" says Perry. \nAn old-school Santa display got the boot at Queens Center in New York as the mall this year installed Santa HQ, a set sponsored by cable TV channel HGTV. \nAs kids stand on the \"Naughty or Nice O'Meter,\" they can watch their names pop up on Santa's \"Nice List\" screen. In another room they can take a selfie and see themselves as dancing elves. In the last room, they're handed tablets that use augmented reality technology to make it appear as if cartoon elves are popping out of the walls and packing gifts. The entire set and trees put on a light show every 20 minutes that is synchronized with holiday music. \nQuite a difference from last year's Santa setup: A couch and some Christmas trees. \n\"It's Santa-meets-21st-century-technology,\" says John Scaturro, a marketing manager for the mall. \nQueens Center's owner, Macerich Co., first installed Santa HQ at some malls two years ago. This year, that expanded to 15 malls from 10. As of November, sales of photos with Santa at Queens Center nearly tripled from last year, says Scaturro. \nIn addition to bringing in shoppers, the set is an advertisement for HGTV. Screens air the network's home improvement and real estate programs. Stars of its shows were set to sign autographs and take photos at two Macerich malls. \nIt's cartoon characters that share the spotlight with Santa at another mall display, the DreamWorks DreamPlace. The set, created by DreamWorks Animation, stars characters from the movie studio's \"Kung Fu Panda\" films — replacing the green ogre from the \"Shrek\" movies that were last year's focus. Thirteen malls are using the set, which uses rumbling seats, wind and mist to create a virtual ride on Santa's sleigh. \nWhatever malls are spending on the Santa spectacles is worth it, says Davidowitz. Santa has always attracted crowds, he says, but adding a high-tech twist is likely to bring in even more who may stop to shop. \n\"I don't see many things out there that equal Santa's power to draw crowds,\" he says.",

      "text": "MINNEAPOLIS (WCCO) — It has not even been operating for six months, but the Amazon.com plant in Shakopee already plans to nearly double its workforce.\nA company spokesperson confirmed the fulfillment center wants to hire 1,000 full-time employees – and this is all thanks to an increase in customer demand across the company.\n(credit: Getty Images/David McNew)\nSamantha DiMaggio, the economic development coordinator for the city of Shakopee, said she was initially under the impression that the hires would only be for temporary positions. But she said city officials were pleasantly surprised to learn the jobs would be full time.\nDiMaggio added that it is possible Shakopee might reach out to the Minnesota Department of Transportation and Scott County officials to see if a traffic study should be done since more workers would be commuting to the facility. \nShe said they anticipated Amazon might add more workers to the Shakopee plant, but they did not anticipated it would happen so soon.\n",

      "text": "print Amazon \nAmazon's new grocery store, Amazon Go , may have created a surprise winner: Impinj, a $600 million IoT company that went public about four months ago. \nOn Tuesday, Impinj closed up more than 7.5%, after RBC Capital published a note saying the company could be a major beneficiary of Amazon's new grocery store initiative. \nImpinj offers real-time inventory tracking technology which makes it easy for retailers to see the movement of every item in the store. \nAlthough there hasn't been any official partnerships, it theoretically makes sense for Amazon to adopt Impinj's technology, as Amazon Go comes with no cashiers or checkout lines. \nIn fact, RBC Capital's Mitch Steves wrote in the note that Impinj is already working with Amazon in its \"small set of retail stores,\" and predicted that the company could get involved in the build out of Amazon Go, as well. \nHe wrote: \"Impinj is working with Amazon in its small set of retail stores and we think the Company may be involved in the Amazon Go initiative as well (no confirmation from either party at this time). This would act as a logical extension of the Impinj product line as the chips could be used as the inventory Management tracker (when lifting a new item the system recognizes a picked up sale allowing for seamless walk-out the door checkout).\" \nSteves added the potential partnership could give Impinj an instant 3% to 5% revenue growth, and even double its annual revenue if it finds a way to get into all of Amazon's warehouses. Last year, Impinj had $78.5 million in revenue. \nNeither company responded when reached for comment by Business Insider. \nImpinj, founded in 2000, is best-known for its RAIN RFID wireless technology that can track products in real-time. Its technology is used in a number of markets, including retail, healthcare, and manufacturing. The video below, published in 2013, gives a clue to how its technology works in a retail setting: Disclosure: Jeff Bezos is an investor in Business Insider through his personal investment company Bezos Expeditions.",

      "text": " China Household Electrical Appliances Association\nThe 2017 Appliance & Electronics World Expo (AWE) will take place from March 9-11, 2017 at the Shanghai New International Expo Centre (SNIEC).\nSHANGHAI , Dec. 6, AWE has forged a strategic partnership with Amazon and JD.com, two leading e-commerce platforms, and invited them to showcase more smart home appliances at the forthcoming AWE 2017, allowing consumers to see first-hand internationally recognized high-end brands and their extraordinary performance.\nOrganized by the China Household Electrical Appliances Association, AWE is a major event on par with CES and IFA, and its next edition will embrace historic new heights, expanding to almost 120,000 square meters of exhibition space in its eight halls.\nFueled by the explosive demands of Chinese consumers for high-end, high-added-value products, Amazon is set to establish its presence for the first time at AWE 2017, and to set up an Amazon Life Show of high-end small home appliances spanning beauty care, kitchen appliances, health care, and more .\nIn March 2016 , JD.com launched a smart home show at AWE 2016, with six experience areas (including an independent kitchen, an open living room, and a special area for home appliances ) showcasing products from Siemens, Samsung, Casarte, LG, Midea, Robam, Fotile, TCL, Haier, Panasonic, LeTV, Hisense, Joyoung, Phillips, A.O. Smith , and more. This brought consumers one step closer to the latest technologies.\nOne of the major distribution channels for consumers , e-commerce platforms are star ting to step up their efforts promoting smart, high-end products, and expand ing their portfolio to include cross-border business, providing consumers products from around the world. Amazon China has registered more than 10 million overseas orders since it began offer ing cross-border service in 2014. In the first half of 2016, sales from its cross-border shopping segment surged to four times as same period last year. AWE, the highest-level exhibition in China's home appliances and consumer electronics industry, has grown to be a preferred platform for e-commerce providers to do offline promotions.\nOnly three weeks after AWE 2017 officially launched, 80% of its booths were booked out, matching last year's record -setting pace . AWE is expanding its portfolio to include more international brands, such as ABB, KUKA, Karcher, Tiger, Vitamix, Cuisinart, Omega, Fisher & Paykel, Westinghouse, Vidal Sassoon , BaByliss, and Laurastar.\nAWE 's Official Website: http://awe.com.cn/en/\nContact:\nCara Wang\n+86-10-6709-3609\ncara.wang@cheaa.com\nTo view the original version on PR Newswire, visit: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/amazon-and-jdcom-to-establish-strong-presence-at-awe-2017-300373536.html\n ",

Content provided on this site is for entertainment or informational purposes only and should not be construed as medical or health, safety, legal or financial advice. Click here for additional information. Why Amazon’s New Ad About Two Seemingly Unlikely Friends Is a Must-Watch Sara Ahmed \nHave you seen the new holiday ad released by Amazon UK yet? If not, please do yourself a favor and watch it immediately. It’s exquisitely soothing, like a warm salve for the third-degree burn otherwise known as the year 2016. And it might just be the bright spot you’ve been looking for. \nRight now, it seems the entire country — or make that the world — is engaged in a brutal dialogue about race, religion, and the perpetual tug-of-war between “us” and “them.” I don’t know about you, but I’m exhausted over it all. \nBut then, as I was having my morning coffee and debating whether or not to click through any one of the million Doomsday-esque stories on Facebook, this popped up on my newsfeed and stopped me in my tracks: Watch More Videos > \nYou guys, I love EVERYTHING about this commercial. I love that Amazon took a huge risk by creating an ad that shows the friendship between a Muslim Imam and Catholic priest. I love that Amazon cast an actual Vicar (Rev. Gary Bradley of Little Venice) and a Muslim school principal (Zubeir Hassem of Leicestershire), adding authenticity to the message. I love that they’re sitting with each other, drinking hot tea. And I SO love that it shows the elderly using technology, because that’s always surprisingly sweet to see. \nThe commercial shows the two religious leaders meeting at the priest’s home to share a cup of tea, some laughter, and commiserate about their mutual knee aches. It doesn’t take an astute observer to see the similarity in how the two men pray to their Maker. But once they depart, each suddenly has the same idea: to send the other something to help with their knee pains. \nBy the end, we see both men at their respective places of worship, kneeling for prayer with the help of gifted kneepads. \nAfter watching it through, a quote by the poet Hafez immediately came to my mind: \nI am in love with every church And mosque And any kind of shrine. Because I know it is there That people say the different names Of the One God. Heathrow's New Christmas Ad Will Make Your Heart Burst Into a Million Pieces \nOxford Dictionary’s Word of the Year is apparently post-truth — an adjective defined as “relating to or denoting circumstances in which objective facts are less influential in shaping public opinion than appeals to emotion and personal belief.” And while that certainly seems fitting, I think the runner up should be xenophobia — an intense or irrational dislike or fear of people from other countries [insert “loudly crying face emoji” here]. \nI know this isn’t the everyday reality for many Americans, but for millions of us — including me, and my own Muslim family — it is. At least, it is now . In my 32 years as an American, I have never seen my foreignness reflected so clearly in the faces of others as I have this past year. My mother, who happens to wear a hijab, has never had a random white guy scream at her in the middle of the day at a Macy’s located in the most diverse county in America. \nUntil last week. \nSo yeah, it got heavy really quick there while I was watching this. But that’s precisely why this commercial stuck a chord with so many people. I recognized my America in it, as well. In this bleak season of Armageddon-like anticipation, it was a gentle reminder that this was the world I grew up in. There were dozens upon dozens of people from different races, cultures, and religions that have helped shape my personal history. \nAmazon’s commercial illustrated the ease with which we can all cultivate interfaith compassion. It also managed to give a boost to my own unexceptional levels of hope for 2017 — and that, I have to admit, is really saying something. Related Post Article Posted 6 hours Ago Share this article ",

      "text": "Amazon May Have Just Killed the Grocery Store (AMZN, KR) By Dan Moskowitz | December 6, 2016 — 6:56 PM EST \nIn the unlikely event you haven’t noticed, new technology that increases speed and/or convenience often leads to new and powerful consumer trends. You usually wouldn’t associate technology with grocery stores, but this is Amazon.com, Inc. ( AMZN ) we’re talking about, and if this is the infant stages of a new grocery store concept, then it could eventually lead to Amazon overtaking The Kroger Co. ( KR ) as the largest supermarket chain. That might sound ridiculous now, but unless Kroger finds a way to compete, give it a few decades. \nThe new Amazon grocery store concept is called Amazon Go, which is currently being tested by Amazon employees in Seattle. The slogan for Amazon Go: “No Lines. No Checkouts. (No, Seriously.)” That should give you the general idea. If you would prefer more details, Amazon Go uses a combination of computer vision, deep learnings algorithms, and sensor fusion to create “Just Walk Out Technology.” \nThe Amazon Go store is expected to open to the public in early 2017. At that time, consumers will have the opportunity to access the Amazon Go app, enter the store, grab the items they need, use their smartphone to scan those items, and walk out the door. In case you’re wondering, there is no self-checkout line. There are absolutely no registers. Also, if you pick something up and put it back on the shelf after deciding you don’t want it, that item will be removed from your checkout list. When you’re done shopping, a receipt will be sent to your Amazon Go app. (See also, How Amazon Financing Works ) \nFor Amazon, this will take years to move the needle, but the potential is enormous. The real investment news for right now is the fear this new concept will generate for Kroger and Whole Foods Market, Inc. ( WFM ). Despite Kroger being mentioned above, this news might be a bigger threat to Whole Foods. \nKroger has generated $5.03 billion in operating cash flow over the past 12 months versus $1.12 billion for Whole Foods over the same time frame. This is in addition to Kroger delivering a profit of $2.04 billion in its last fiscal year versus $507 million in profit for Whole Foods. These numbers indicate that Kroger has much more maneuverability, especially when it comes to innovation. Kroger is currently dealing with food price deflation , but Whole Foods has a bigger problem, which is increased competition in the natural and organic food space, which has led to lower prices in order to drive traffic. This, in turn, has the potential to lead to margin contraction and reduced profitability. In order to compete with Amazon Go in the future, competitors must generate as much cash flow and profit as possible now. \nWhile Amazon’s new store has significant long-term potential as might change the entire industry, it’s an unfortunate development because it would lead to reduced need for jobs. This factor could be one potential headwind for Amazon if consumers boycott the brand, but a boycott would be unlikely to have a long-term impact. \nAmazon may kill the grocery store, but it may also give birth to a new one.

      "text": "\"What would shopping look like if you could walk into a store, grab what you want and just go?\" Next year, ecommerce giant Amazon will open a grocery store in Seattle where customers can just walk in, browse and pick up items from shelves, and walk straight out without paying at a register.\nClaimed to be \"the world’s most advanced shopping technology\", Amazon Go is a new kind of store with no checkout required.\nAnd this is how it works: You just have to open the corresponding app, and scan your phone on the way in. From there, you can stow away your phone and grab all the items you need. When you're finished collecting your items, just walk out of the store. No more lines or registers.\nShortly after, the store charges your Amazon account and sends you a receipt.\nhttps://youtu.be/NrmMk1Myrxc\nAs you’re shopping, sensors in the inventory shelves monitor when (and which) items are being picked up. With the company’s \"just walk out technology\", the sensors watch whether the item gets put back down on the shelf or not, and may even check if the weight of the item changes from its original state. This is likely designed so people are correctly charged if they pick up a food or drink and begin consuming them while they’re still in the store.\nFor years, retailers and tech companies have touted futuristic possibilities like the new store Amazon is introducing.\nNow in beta mode with Amazon employees, the 1,800-square-foot store, selling ready-made meals and grocery staples, should open to the public next year. It is located in Seattle, where the 22-year-old brand is headquartered.",

      "title": "Will Amazon's (AMZN) Convenience Stores Transform Retail?",
      "text": "The so far online-only retail giant Amazon.com, Inc. ( AMZN - Free Report ) is reportedly planning to open a brick-and-mortar grocery store by early 2017. Known as Amazon Go, the first store will open in Seattle, Amazon’s hometown.\nThe Wall Street Journal reported yesterday that the company has a broader plan of opening over 2000 brick-and-mortar stores in three different store formats, depending on the success of the initial stores.\nNotably, the new Amazon exclusive store format that the company calls “Just Walk Out” will be devoid of cashiers and check outs and thus will not have long customer queues.\nHow Does it Work? \nAmazon would be the first major retailer to transform the line-free store concept to reality. Customers will have to download an app and get their smartphones scanned at the store entrance.\nAs they start shopping, the app will add every item they pick up in their virtual carts and delete the ones that are put back.\nAs the customers exit, the technology will enable the calculation of the total bill, generate a digital receipt and charge customers from their Amazon account.\nAMAZON.COM INC PE Ratio (TTM) \nAMAZON.COM INC PE Ratio (TTM) | AMAZON.COM INC Quote \nWill it Revolutionize Retail? \nBefore coming to that, a few more questions need to be answered. The first one is how efficient the system is? The technology is at a primary stage and Amazon may have to face a number of consumers’ complaints in case they are overcharged.\nAmazon has said that the technology is based on machine learning, computer vision and artificial intelligence, but has not revealed much. So there are still a lot of uncertainties related to its execution.\nThe next question is will the convenience of no queues come at the cost of cashiers? According to The Bureau of Labor Statistics, cashier is the second-biggest occupation, with 3.5 million employed in the U.S. So, if the new technology works out and gets widely accepted in the retail industry, the job scenario will undergo a drastic transformation.\nNevertheless, the technology will eliminate checkout queues, one of the frustrating parts of shopping in store, saving shoppers a lot of time and effort. Amazon will have the first mover advantage with this system.\nWhat’s on Amazon’s Platter \nThis is undoubtedly a clever move on part of Amazon to steer its business into the $800 billion grocery space. The move will help the company wrestle market share from peers such as Walmart ( WMT - Free Report ) , Kroger ( KR - Free Report ) and Target ( TGT - Free Report ) .\nThe move also appears to be a part of Project Como, Amazon’s plan to enhance food sales, to help it extract more dollars from the retail market. Shares of Amazon have been steadily treading higher on a year-to-date basis. The stock generated a return of 12.35% compared with the Zacks Electronic Commerce industry gain of 6.49%.\n\nAmazon has already gone brick-and-mortar with books and it seems that it is treading the same path with other merchandise as well, targeting the considerably large customer base that still prefers to shop at physical stores. We note that every industry matures and falls. Amazon seems to be gearing up well in advance should online retail ever bottom out.\nZacks Rank \nCurrently, Amazon is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company.

      "text": "Ambika Chopra December 6, 2016 2 min read Inc42 Staff 139 SHARES \nIn line with its vision to make big in India, ecommerce giant Amazon has unveiled its Launchpad programme in India. The move is aimed at helping Indian startups to increase their customer base in India and abroad, as per a report by ET. \nStartups can access the premium programme offered by Amazon’s seller support services for a fee of INR 5,000 per month . The benefits of the programme include account management, marketing, and warehouse management among others. \nCommenting on the development, Amit Agarwal, VP and Country Head, Amazon India said, “India has great minds which invent amazing products and we will support their growth by helping customers discover their new products not just in India but also other countries around the world. We hope that Amazon Launchpad has a positive impact on the economy by further promoting ‘Make in India,’ adding further impetus to the current interest in Indian startups and also creating additional employment opportunities.” \nIn order to facilitate the programme, Amazon has tied up with various partners including Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion’s Start Up India initiative , Nasscom 10,000 startups , and Indian Angel Network . The company also said that around 25 startups such as Witworks, Leaf Wearables, Ducere Technologies, and Seventh Sense Technologies , have already joined the programme. \n“The global programme, which is already present in seven countries has helped over 1,200 startups launch products, with over 4,000 products in the storefront,” Jason Feldman, Director Global Innovations, Amazon said. \nGlobally, Amazon Launchpad works with more than 100 venture capital firms, crowd-funding services, and accelerators/incubators. In India, it has also roped in a few strategic partners such as NITI Aayog, Government of Maharashtra, Government of Telangana, and TiE to help support the startups further. \nAmazon has been extensively working to launch services that meet different business requirements of sellers and help them grow their business online. Over the past years, it has introduced programmes like Seller University , an extensive education and skilling program for SMBs; Fulfilment By Amazon , a fulfilment service wherein Amazon India packs, ships and delivers products to customers, manages returns and does customer service on behalf of the sellers; Easy Ship , an assisted shipping service for sellers across India; Amazon Tatkal , and Seller Flex , implementation of FBA technology at sellers’ warehouses.

The Santa ... more Photo: Branden Camp, AP Mindful of Amazon, malls take the Santa experience high-tech 1 / 16 Back to Gallery NEW YORK (AP) — Hop on a virtual sleigh ride to the North Pole. Stand on the \"Naughty or Nice O'Meter.\" Snap a selfie and see your face on a dancing elf. The Santa experience has gotten a makeover as many malls install shows and games they hope will lure shoppers who are buying more online. About 40 malls in the U.S. and one in London have the high-tech Santa displays, most of them located near major cities that tend to house pricier stores. Taking photos on Santa's lap costs about $30 and up, around the same as at other malls, but most of the malls say people can walk through without purchasing anything. \"It was a half-hour of entertainment that was free,\" says Katie Mass , who took her twin daughters through Santa's Flight Academy , a 3,000-square-foot setup at The Mall at Short Hills in New Jersey. She had gone to the mall to return some dresses, but had to stop when her 2-year olds saw the spectacle. \"They started running,\" says the stay-at-home mom from Westfield, New Jersey. The girls tapped touch screens, pulled levers and watched as flight suits were virtually fit over their bodies on a screen. The final stop was a two-story tall enclosed sleigh that dropped fake snow upon them. One girl made snow angels on the floor while her sister danced under the colorful lasers. \"It was extravagant and well done,\" says Mass. Malls are hoping the over-the-top Santa visits remind people what brick-and-mortar stores can offer. They're increasingly trying to offer special experiences as they compete with online rivals, says Howard Davidowitz , chairman of New York-based retail consulting group Davidowitz & Associates. \"The parents love it, the kids love it and Amazon can't do it,\" says Davidowitz. Santa's Flight Academy was developed by mall operator Taubman Centers Inc. , which spent two years on the idea. After testing it last year at The Mall of San Juan in Puerto Rico, the company rolled it out to 11 other Taubman malls this year, replacing a low-tech ice palace that had housed Santa for years. Like other malls with elaborate Santa sets, Taubman declined to say how much it spent on Santa's Flight Academy. Guy Perry, a manager of a Disney Store at Taubman's Westfarms mall in West Hartford, Connecticut, credited this year's \"great\" store traffic to Santa's Flight Academy. Kids come into the store and tell him how they helped Santa take flight. \"It is getting a lot of good reviews,\" says Perry. An old-school Santa display got the boot at Queens Center in New York as the mall this year installed Santa HQ, a set sponsored by cable TV channel HGTV. As kids stand on the \"Naughty or Nice O'Meter,\" they can watch their names pop up on Santa's \"Nice List\" screen. In another room they can take a selfie and see themselves as dancing elves. In the last room, they're handed tablets that use augmented reality technology to make it appear as if cartoon elves are popping out of the walls and packing gifts. The entire set and trees put on a light show every 20 minutes that is synchronized with holiday music. Quite a difference from last year's Santa setup: A couch and some Christmas trees. \"It's Santa-meets-21st-century-technology,\" says John Scaturro , a marketing manager for the mall. Queens Center's owner, Macerich Co., first installed Santa HQ at some malls two years ago. This year, that expanded to 15 malls from 10. As of November, sales of photos with Santa at Queens Center nearly tripled from last year, says Scaturro. In addition to bringing in shoppers, the set is an advertisement for HGTV. Screens air the network's home improvement and real estate programs. Stars of its shows were set to sign autographs and take photos at two Macerich malls. It's cartoon characters that share the spotlight with Santa at another mall display, the DreamWorks DreamPlace. The set, created by DreamWorks Animation, stars characters from the movie studio's \"Kung Fu Panda\" films — replacing the green ogre from the \"Shrek\" movies that were last year's focus. Thirteen malls are using the set, which uses rumbling seats, wind and mist to create a virtual ride on Santa's sleigh. Whatever malls are spending on the Santa spectacles is worth it, says Davidowitz. Santa has always attracted crowds, he says, but adding a high-tech twist is likely to bring in even more who may stop to shop. \"I don't see many things out there that equal Santa's power to draw crowds,\" he says.

      "text": "NEW YORK (AP) -- Hop on a virtual sleigh ride to the North Pole. Stand on the \"Naughty or Nice O'Meter.\" Snap a selfie and see your face on a dancing elf. The Santa experience has gotten a makeover as many malls install shows and games they hope will lure shoppers who are buying more online.\nAbout 40 malls in the U.S. and one in London have the high-tech Santa displays, most of them located near major cities that tend to house pricier stores. Taking photos on Santa's lap costs about $30 and up, around the same as at other malls, but most of the malls say people can walk through without purchasing anything.\n\"It was a half-hour of entertainment that was free,\" says Katie Mass, who took her twin daughters through Santa's Flight Academy, a 3,000-square-foot setup at The Mall at Short Hills in New Jersey.\nShe had gone to the mall to return some dresses, but had to stop when her 2-year olds saw the spectacle. \"They started running,\" says the stay-at-home mom from Westfield, New Jersey.\nThe girls tapped touch screens, pulled levers and watched as flight suits were virtually fit over their bodies on a screen. The final stop was a two-story tall enclosed sleigh that dropped fake snow upon them. One girl made snow angels on the floor while her sister danced under the colorful lasers. \"It was extravagant and well done,\" says Mass.\nMalls are hoping the over-the-top Santa visits remind people what brick-and-mortar stores can offer. They're increasingly trying to offer special experiences as they compete with online rivals, says Howard Davidowitz, chairman of New York-based retail consulting group Davidowitz & Associates.\n\"The parents love it, the kids love it and Amazon can't do it,\" says Davidowitz.\nSanta's Flight Academy was developed by mall operator Taubman Centers Inc., which spent two years on the idea. After testing it last year at The Mall of San Juan in Puerto Rico, the company rolled it out to 11 other Taubman malls this year, replacing a low-tech ice palace that had housed Santa for years. Like other malls with elaborate Santa sets, Taubman declined to say how much it spent on Santa's Flight Academy.\nGuy Perry, a manager of a Disney Store at Taubman's Westfarms mall in West Hartford, Connecticut, credited this year's \"great\" store traffic to Santa's Flight Academy. Kids come into the store and tell him how they helped Santa take flight.\n\"It is getting a lot of good reviews,\" says Perry.\nAn old-school Santa display got the boot at Queens Center in New York as the mall this year installed Santa HQ, a set sponsored by cable TV channel HGTV.\nAs kids stand on the \"Naughty or Nice O'Meter,\" they can watch their names pop up on Santa's \"Nice List\" screen. In another room they can take a selfie and see themselves as dancing elves. In the last room, they're handed tablets that use augmented reality technology to make it appear as if cartoon elves are popping out of the walls and packing gifts. The entire set and trees put on a light show every 20 minutes that is synchronized with holiday music.\nQuite a difference from last year's Santa setup: A couch and some Christmas trees.\n\"It's Santa-meets-21st-century-technology,\" says John Scaturro, a marketing manager for the mall.\nQueens Center's owner, Macerich Co., first installed Santa HQ at some malls two years ago. This year, that expanded to 15 malls from 10. As of November, sales of photos with Santa at Queens Center nearly tripled from last year, says Scaturro.\nIn addition to bringing in shoppers, the set is an advertisement for HGTV. Screens air the network's home improvement and real estate programs. Stars of its shows were set to sign autographs and take photos at two Macerich malls.\nIt's cartoon characters that share the spotlight with Santa at another mall display, the DreamWorks DreamPlace. The set, created by DreamWorks Animation, stars characters from the movie studio's \"Kung Fu Panda\" films — replacing the green ogre from the \"Shrek\" movies that were last year's focus. Thirteen malls are using the set, which uses rumbling seats, wind and mist to create a virtual ride on Santa's sleigh.\nWhatever malls are spending on the Santa spectacles is worth it, says Davidowitz. Santa has always attracted crowds, he says, but adding a high-tech twist is likely to bring in even more who may stop to shop.\n\"I don't see many things out there that equal Santa's power to draw crowds,\" he says.",

Those same tangles become bothersome distractions when listeners are ready to zone out and can even damage sound performance if they persist over time. \nUinvent Universal Travel Organizer Picture 2 of 17 Don’t toss gadget gear willy-nilly into luggage. This convenient travel organizer doesn’t just hold loose cash, toiletries, and other spare parts, it’s got pockets and straps to secure all your unbundled tech items, too. That includes cords, cards, packs, jacks, batteries, chargers, dongles, you name it, even a 10-inch tablet. Bonus: this versatile carry-all is water-proof.\nREI Self-Inflating Travel Pillow Picture 3 of 17 Heavy is the head addled by jet lag, but this 4-ounce travel pillow brings rest anywhere. The REI Travel Pillow collapses into a pack that's small enough to fit inside a personal bag. When it's time for shut-eye on a red-eye, an inflation nozzle draws air until the bow tie-shaped pillow's stuffed to a comfy volume. To deflate, raise the same nozzle and squeeze. Book further travel and repeat. \nEasyAcc 6000mAh Ultra Slim External Battery Picture 4 of 17 Jetting between time zones makes it easy to forget battery-drained gadgets. The EasyAcc Ultra Slim portable charger packs a 6,000-mAh power bank with enough amps to restore most phones two times over. Thanks to built-in, fast-charge technology, the Ultra Slim delivers power at 2.4-amp speeds, putting devices back in go mode in less time.\nTrackr Bravo Bluetooth Tracking Tags Picture 5 of 17 I haven't traveled without losing something important since the first Bush administration. Trackr tags make for handy digital leashes to those can't-lose travel chotkes. Attach the thin tags to a wallet, passport case, luggage, even the rental keys. Then pair the Trackr tags to your smartphone via Bluetooth. When an item's out of range, the connected phone will sound an alarm. Finders keepers.\nSamsonite World Wide Power Adapter Picture 6 of 17 Meet the Swiss army knife of power adapters. Samsonite's World Wide adapter has slide-out connections for wall sockets in Australia, China, Europe, the U.S. and the United Kingdom. Just connect your device to the universal receiving plug on one side (or jack in via one of two USB ports), then slip out the appropriate wall connection and plug that into the wall.\nTylt Ribbn USB-C Charger Picture 7 of 17 Even if many current Android phones don't charge via USB Type-C, the next generation of devices certainly will. Embrace the future with the Tylt Ribbon, a car charger with a dedicated Type-C port. This tangle-free cord comes in yellow, red, blue, or black, and packs a traditional USB port to charge a second gadget, regardless of the native charger type. \nScottevest Pack Jacket Picture 8 of 17 This weather-ready light coat bundles into carry-ons to pull out when needed. It sports 14 zippered external and internal pockets, an interior cord-management system that wires a set of headphones into the hood, and hook-and-loop enclosures that keep tech secure as jet-setters jet around. Available in Black, Graphite, Navy Blue, Sky Blue or Red.\nKindle E-Reader Picture 9 of 17 A hefty load of books does not a light travel bag make, but the Kindle e-reader can squeeze millions of pages into a traveler's carry-on. This digital device is smaller than 7 inches and has a battery that lasts weeks, not to mention a glare-free, e-ink display that keeps the \"print\" clear, even if the plane's window shades are raised high. Another perk: Amazon Prime members have access to over a thousand books for free, which translates to less cash spent at the airport book store.\nZolt Laptop Charger Plus Picture 10 of 17 Tell them to toss their chargers in the trash. When it's plugged into a wall outlet, the Zolt not only powers up smartphones, tablets, and other devices, it has the amperage to charge PCs and MacBooks, too. Built with the capacity to re-juice notebooks that require between 40 and 65 watts of juice, the Zolt frees warriors of the road to leave bulky power bricks at camp, and take only the gadget weapons they need for the journey. Oh, and, pssst, don't skimp on the warranty. The two-year coverage plan includes free replacements for the power tips that connect laptops to the Zolt's USB power ports.\nLogitech Create Backlit Keyboard Case for iPad Pro Picture 11 of 17 The Logitech Create and the 9.7-inch iPad Pro are a first-class match. While most keyboard cases are cramped, stubby affairs, the Create has an edge-to-edge layout and a row of dedicated iOS shortcut buttons. A backlight lets working travelers tap away after the lights go down, and the Apple Smart Connector draws power from the iPad itself, so there's no need to plug in two devices.\nParrot Zik 2.0 Noise-Canceling Headphones Picture 12 of 17 The Road is long and boring. Brighten travels with the fantastic Parrot Zik 2.0 headphones . These plush, comfortable over-ear cans use gesture-based touch controls and noise-canceling technology that blocks out background racket. The Zik's secret weapon: Concert mode, which adds a warm, live stage quality to studio-recorded tracks. You're not on the road if you feel like you're at a show.\nHP Powerup Backpack Picture 13 of 17 When is a backpack more than a backpack? When it's got a humongous 22,400-mAh battery with the storage capacity to return a dead laptop to full strength. With its internal wiring system, the HP Powerup can juice three gadgets at a time, and lets the lucky wearer set the charging priority. It's also freakin' stylish, and includes a heat sensor to make sure hardware is charging — not cooking.\nBose QuietComfort 35 Noise-Canceling Headphones Picture 14 of 17 The QuietComfort 35 are Bose's first-ever wire-free noise-canceling headphones, and, wow, do they deliver. The sound quality is so rich that we discovered brand-new details in our music, and the battery life is rated for 20 hours — with Bluetooth and noise-canceling modes turned on. Cushy leather-cupped earpieces means listeners can wear the QC35 for every second of that cross-country flight.\nBluesmart One Smart Luggage Bag Picture 15 of 17 The Bluesmart One is a teched-out four-wheeler with a smart lock that even the TSA will love. What else? How about a 10,400-mAh charger, two USB ports to re-up your gadgets and a 3G SIM card that provides GPS tracking even if your bag's in another time zone. Need more? The One has a scale built into its handle. Just lift up, check the weight and breeze through check-in.\nDell XPS 13 Picture 16 of 17 The XPS 13 is a work of art. Dell smooshed a 13-inch, 1080p screen into a petite body the size of an 11-inch laptop. Soft-touch carbon fiber cradles a bright, back-lit keyboard. And though the XPS 13 is teeny, its battery life is anything but. The system lasted upward of 11 hours on our tests. So even en route to the other side of the world, the Dell XPS 13 is always ready for action.\nTopHome Cord Organizer Uinvent Universal Travel Organizer REI Self-Inflating Travel Pillow EasyAcc 6000mAh Ultra Slim External Battery Trackr Bravo Bluetooth Tracking Tags Samsonite World Wide Power Adapter Tylt Ribbn USB-C Charger Scottevest Pack Jacket Kindle E-Reader Zolt Laptop Charger Plus Logitech Create Backlit Keyboard Case for iPad Pro Parrot Zik 2.0 Noise-Canceling Headphones HP Powerup Backpack Bose QuietComfort 35 Noise-Canceling Headphones Bluesmart One Smart Luggage Bag Dell XPS 13",

      "text": "Morale is sinking, pilots for Amazon cargo say in survey   9:01 pm On Wednesday, Atlas Air pilots are expected to demonstrate in front of Amazon’s headquarters. (Atlas Air) In a survey, pilots for one of the companies Amazon has contracted for air- cargo services complain about pay, attrition and a looming pilot shortage. Share story Ángel González Seattle Times business reporter \nThe pilots who work for an air-cargo contractor scheduled to become a big part of Amazon.com’s budding air force are chafing under what they say are lackluster compensation packages, attrition and a looming pilot shortage — and they want the tech giant to know all about it. \nOn Wednesday, the union representing pilots working at Atlas Air Worldwide is releasing a survey of more than 1,000 respondents, or about two-thirds of the company’s roster, that shows tanking morale. \nDemonstrations and claims of woe are not unusual in the context of bitter contract negotiations between pilots and their management. But it’s a new scene for Amazon, which has sought to exert more control over its logistics by having third-party contractors Atlas and Air Transport Services Group (ATSG) operate 20 planes each on its behalf. The effort is dubbed “Prime Air.” \nFor the e-commerce and technology behemoth, it underscores the challenges of its first steps into the world of air freight — a foray that could become deeper if Amazon chooses to acquire parts of ATSG and Atlas, according to options specified in the deal struck earlier this year. Most Read Stories Unlimited Digital Access. $1 for 4 weeks. \nAmazon’s big name recognition and humongous transportation needs have made it a fulcrum in high-stakes pilot-contract negotiations, particularly during the busy holiday season. \nBefore Thanksgiving, pilots with a unit of ATSG went on a strike that they claimed would result in “delays and disruptions” for Amazon customers just when they shop the most. The pilots, who were protesting what they said were stressful working conditions and intentional understaffing, were ordered back to work by a judge the following day. \nATSG pilots said at the time the company was already flying 14 planes for Amazon. An Atlas pilot says that so far that company is flying one plane for Prime Air. \nIn the case of Atlas, pilots and management are at a standstill in negotiations over a new labor agreement. \nThe Atlas pilots’ union, Airline Professionals Association Teamsters Local 1224, says its members are paid much less and have longer working hours than pilots at UPS or Fedex. The union also complained that Atlas has refused to negotiate. \nThe trouble stems in part from Atlas’ recent acquisition of Southern Air, which had a different labor contract with its pilots. The Atlas pilots’ union says the company is trying to merge its contract with Southern Air’s, which it considers disadvantageous. \nIn a statement, Atlas Air said it “respects an individual’s right to express his or her opinion.” \n“We will continue our dialogue with the union under the terms and conditions of our contract to reach a new joint collective-bargaining agreement incorporating the merger with Southern Air,” the company said. \nThe pilots are trying to win Amazon, which declined to comment for this story, to their cause. \nRobert Kirchner, an Atlas pilot and executive council chairman of the union, says low pay and poor working conditions are fueling attrition that might aggravate the impact of a looming pilot shortage already felt around the industry. \nHe said a hiring push by Atlas last year was greatly dampened by the departure of more than a hundred pilots. \n“We want to get not only Amazon’s attention, but the public’s attention,” Kirchner said in an interview. “We’d like to see this fixed; we’d like to see Atlas prosper.” \nThe Teamsters Local 1224 survey was answered by 897 Atlas pilots and 143 pilots working for Southern Air. (There are about 1,400 pilots on the Atlas contract and 300 on the Southern contract.) \nAsked whether their carrier had enough pilots to meet the long-term needs of Amazon or of DHL, another large contractor, 69.3 percent of Atlas pilots said they “completely” disagreed. About 19.4 percent said they “somewhat” disagreed. \nWhen asked whether they planned to apply to another airline for employment in the coming year, 65.3 percent of Atlas pilots said yes. So did 71.1 percent of Southern pilots. \nAs for the question of whether morale was high among the pilot staff, 68.9 percent of Atlas pilots and 69.1 percent of Southern pilots “completely” disagreed.

The Santa experience has gotten a makeover as many malls install shows and games they hope will lure shoppers who are buying more online. (AP Photo/Branden Camp) \nNEW YORK (AP) — Hop on a virtual sleigh ride to the North Pole. Stand on the \"Naughty or Nice O'Meter.\" Snap a selfie and see your face on a dancing elf. The Santa experience has gotten a makeover as many malls install shows and games they hope will lure shoppers who are buying more online. \nAbout 40 malls in the U.S. and one in London have the high-tech Santa displays, most of them located near major cities that tend to house pricier stores. Taking photos on Santa's lap costs about $30 and up, around the same as at other malls, but most of the malls say people can walk through without purchasing anything. \n\"It was a half-hour of entertainment that was free,\" says Katie Mass, who took her twin daughters through Santa's Flight Academy, a 3,000-square-foot setup at The Mall at Short Hills in New Jersey. \nShe had gone to the mall to return some dresses, but had to stop when her 2-year olds saw the spectacle. \"They started running,\" says the stay-at-home mom from Westfield, New Jersey. \nThe girls tapped touch screens, pulled levers and watched as flight suits were virtually fit over their bodies on a screen. The final stop was a two-story tall enclosed sleigh that dropped fake snow upon them. One girl made snow angels on the floor while her sister danced under the colorful lasers. \"It was extravagant and well done,\" says Mass. \nMalls are hoping the over-the-top Santa visits remind people what brick-and-mortar stores can offer. They're increasingly trying to offer special experiences as they compete with online rivals, says Howard Davidowitz, chairman of New York-based retail consulting group Davidowitz & Associates. \n\"The parents love it, the kids love it and Amazon can't do it,\" says Davidowitz. \nSanta's Flight Academy was developed by mall operator Taubman Centers Inc., which spent two years on the idea. After testing it last year at The Mall of San Juan in Puerto Rico, the company rolled it out to 11 other Taubman malls this year, replacing a low-tech ice palace that had housed Santa for years. Like other malls with elaborate Santa sets, Taubman declined to say how much it spent on Santa's Flight Academy. \nGuy Perry, a manager of a Disney Store at Taubman's Westfarms mall in West Hartford, Connecticut, credited this year's \"great\" store traffic to Santa's Flight Academy. Kids come into the store and tell him how they helped Santa take flight. \n\"It is getting a lot of good reviews,\" says Perry. \nAn old-school Santa display got the boot at Queens Center in New York as the mall this year installed Santa HQ, a set sponsored by cable TV channel HGTV. \nAs kids stand on the \"Naughty or Nice O'Meter,\" they can watch their names pop up on Santa's \"Nice List\" screen. In another room they can take a selfie and see themselves as dancing elves. In the last room, they're handed tablets that use augmented reality technology to make it appear as if cartoon elves are popping out of the walls and packing gifts. The entire set and trees put on a light show every 20 minutes that is synchronized with holiday music. \nQuite a difference from last year's Santa setup: A couch and some Christmas trees. \n\"It's Santa-meets-21st-century-technology,\" says John Scaturro, a marketing manager for the mall. \nQueens Center's owner, Macerich Co., first installed Santa HQ at some malls two years ago. This year, that expanded to 15 malls from 10. As of November, sales of photos with Santa at Queens Center nearly tripled from last year, says Scaturro. \nIn addition to bringing in shoppers, the set is an advertisement for HGTV. Screens air the network's home improvement and real estate programs. Stars of its shows were set to sign autographs and take photos at two Macerich malls.

The set, created by DreamWorks Animation, stars characters from the movie studio's \"Kung Fu Panda\" films — replacing the green ogre from the \"Shrek\" movies that were last year's focus. Thirteen malls are using the set, which uses rumbling seats, wind and mist to create a virtual ride on Santa's sleigh. \nWhatever malls are spending on the Santa spectacles is worth it, says Davidowitz. Santa has always attracted crowds, he says, but adding a high-tech twist is likely to bring in even more who may stop to shop. \n\"I don't see many things out there that equal Santa's power to draw crowds,\" he says.",

      "text": "Facebook Flipboard 0 0 SHARES \nThis week in retail started with the news that Amazon would be opening Amazon Go , a cashier-free, app-based shopping experience concept that I am almost certain will grow into a chain with hundreds, if not thousands, of locations. Amazon pretty much invented e-commerce and now they are sending clear signals that they intend to reinvent physical retail as well. \nWhile the Amazon Go concept is clearly innovative and a great example of competing by creating an effortless experience , it’s not like no one saw this coming. I moderated a conference panel 3 years ago on the blending of physical and digital retail, including app-assisted shopping. Meanwhile, “robot retail” startup, Hointer , (also offering cashier-free checkout) was founded back in 2011. One key tidbit from the Amazon Go promo video that’s not getting noticed in the media coverage, is that Amazon has been working on the design and technology of the store for 4 years . \nIf Amazon decides to step on the gas with expanding Amazon Go it will take a big chunk of business away from many incumbent convenience stores and small format grocers. If you think the damage will be limited to grocery—don’t be so complacent—Rebecca Minkoff is also piloting a self checkout concept and Amazon is clearly determined to make Amazon Fashion a success in the long run (self-checkout is just one of many innovations they could bring to the apparel category). Recommended for You \nWebcast, December 14th: Measuring Micro-Moments With Google Analytics \nNow that Amazon has a 4-year head start (and potentially some patent protection to boot), incumbent retailers find themselves once again trailing behind another technology-led disruption to their business. Why do we keep seeing these cycles of disruptive innovation with incumbents falling further behind? I have a few favorite reasons: Status quo inertia – In established industries like retail, the status quo can breed a powerful sense of complacency. I can imagine an internal narrative like this: “Hey we have cashiers and they are not that expensive plus there are those impulse buys of candy and tabloids when consumers get stuck in long lines. We’ll throw up a couple of self-checkout lines to check the tech box.” Fine, until Amazon comes along and completely redesigns the experience to be effortless and data informed from end to end. Lack of a disciplined and patient approach to innovation – Experts in the field of innovation point out that coming up with ideas is the relatively easy part, but actually bringing innovations to market is hard. Many retailers who are organized around running their existing businesses don’t have the discipline built-in to filter innovation ideas and test them with consumers. Alternately, they don’t have the patience required for the process and systems changes needed to scale innovations beyond a few pilot stores. Quarterly earnings myopia – Investing in the future often involves short-term pain (expense, sales comping down) for long-term gain. Amazon has a deep understanding of this and has never let Wall Street-driven, short-term thinking influence it’s decision making. Sadly, this can’t be said for the majority of retailers, and it’s led them to be gun shy about even small innovations like better CRM or the use of Beacon technology in their stores. Losing the talent wars – It takes a lot of really smart people and specialized knowledge to bring an Amazon Go to market. Unfortunately for retailers and most brands the war for that kind of talent is increasingly being won by a very short list of tech companies, including Amazon. \nAll this isn’t to say that retailers should chase Amazon down the cashier-free rabbit hole. Instead, retailers should assess what kinds of innovation are on-brand for themselves and—critically—which types of innovations are within the scope of their near-future capabilities and investment bandwidth. Ultimately, for retailers to bring pioneering retail concepts to market, they will need to get inside the mind of the customer , elevate their strategic thinking, conduct realistic assessments of their own technology and infrastructure, and develop a rigorous approach to piloting and implementation. These are all things Amazon excels at doing. \nThat’s my take on why most of retail largely ignored an obvious trend and let Amazon beat everyone to market, again. I’d love to hear your point of view: Is there another way to look at this? Or, if you agree, what other lessons do you think retailers still haven’t learned?

      "text": "At Amazon's New Grocery Store, You Grab and Go, No Checkout No cashiers, no lines, no need to bring credit cards or cash December 7, 2016 | Retail & Ecommerce | CPG Share Print \nOnline grocery shopping is at the tipping point, thanks to shifting consumer attitudes and innovations at the brick-and-mortar level. In the latest sign of change, Amazon unveiled a concept grocery store in Seattle that offers a no-checkout experience. \nThe store is currently in beta, but the company plans to open doors to the public in early 2017. In order to shop there, consumers need an Amazon account, as well as the Amazon Go app installed on their smartphone. The shopping process appears simple. Consumers will be able to enter a store via the Amazon Go app (most likely with a bar code in the app), pick up the things they need and then walk out of the store. \nThe Seattle store is just one of several grocery store formats that Amazon plans to explore. The other two concepts combine online ordering with pickup, eliminating the delivery option—one of the most costly aspects of online grocery shopping. \n“The move to brick-and-mortar is necessary for Amazon to compete—and perhaps succeed—in the grocery retail arena,” said eMarketer analyst Patricia Orsini. “And they are serious about winning in this space, evidenced by the fact that Amazon [is trying out] several different shopping formats.” \nAnother Amazon concept is that a shopper could place an order online, drive a few miles to a store where the order is waiting and pull in to a designated parking spot where someone would load the groceries into their car. “This is where the real convenience of online grocery shopping lies,” Orsini said. “It also solves two other issues related to online grocery shopping: shoppers can receive their order within a couple of hours, and there are no delivery charges to increase the cost of doing online shopping.” \nThis click-and-collect model of shopping has gained a lot of traction in Europe, especially in the UK and France. It’s starting to gain steam in the US, as major supermarket chains such as Kroger and Safeway begin to offer it. Data from Adobe also explored this shift. \nAs of July 2016, in-store pickup was responsible for almost half of the sector’s online sales when measured by fulfillment type. That’s up from 18% for the previous year. \n“Brick-and-mortar stores will lead the way in the growth of online grocery sales. The increase will be small, don’t expect to see the percentage of purchases made online increase by more than 1 or 2 percentage points,” Orsini said. “But, this will still add up to a good chunk of money—about $58 billion is spent monthly overall in the US food and beverage category.” \nAmazon has some fierce competition, and not just from Kroger and Safeway, but also Wal-Mart and drugstore chain CVS. \n“Wal-Mart recently acquired Jet.com, a pure-play CPG ecommerce site,” said Orsini. “Jet.com’s algorithm that discounts shoppers’ carts as they add more products, combined with the fact that 90% of the US population lives within 10 miles of a Wal-Mart store, could be a catalyst for shoppers to take get both lower prices and convenient pickup: Two things that consumers value when purchasing groceries digitally.” \nAs the grocery space continues to change, consumer behavior toward buying groceries online is also slowly shifting. The change is primarily led by millennials. According to February 2016 research from UPS , in association with comScore and the e-tailing group , 11% of millennial digital buyers had ordered from digital grocery delivery services such as Peapod, compared with 6% of non-millennials.

      "title": "WTF are wrapper tags? - Digiday",
      "text": "Header bidding got a little sexier last week after Amazon announced it was flirting with wrapper tags .\nWhile it was clear that Amazon’s announcement could have implications for publishers, it was less clear exactly how wrappers worked in the first place. They’ve been alleged to increase revenue and reduce page latency, but explanations haven’t always been comprehensible for ordinary humans.\nHeader bidding — the process by which publishers offer inventory to multiple ad exchanges simultaneously before making calls to their ad servers — was already confusing enough without this additional nuance. So let’s make some sense of it.\nAdvertisement\nSo WTF is it? \nA header wrapper is a string of javascript that simultaneously collects multiple bid requests and responses before passing them through to an ad server, said Gabe Dewitt, vp of technical operations at Index Exchange. The wrapper also collects various ad tech tags for services such as tracking, analytics and viewability that are implemented throughout a publisher’s webpage. The ad tech tags that the wrapper collects are then centrally hosted, typically through an external cloud-based service or a content delivery network.\nOK, but why does that matter? \nBy collecting tags in one place, publishers can more easily manage and alter their tags.\n“Without a wrapper, every time a publisher makes a change to a header tag, the ads person has to [manually] replace the old header tag with a new one,” said Jay Friedman, COO of programmatic company Goodway Group. “But if you have a wrapper, that provides with you with a portal where you place that code in one time, make sure it works, and then you can work in a separate interface to change code so that you are not messing with the actual page anymore.”\nWrappers also allow publishers to set some standards in their heading bidding. With a wrapper, publishers can adopt a “universal timeout,” which weeds out bidders who take too long to respond.\nWhat does a timeout have to do with anything? \nA major criticism of header bidding is that every additional tag a publisher adds is a potential source of additional page latency. A universal timeout helps reduce this latency because it sets a ceiling on how long bidders have to respond before they are passed over.\nFor example, imagine a publisher with four header-bidding partners and a timeout of 100 milliseconds. The first three partners make their bids within 100 milliseconds, but the fourth makes its bid in 150 milliseconds. The first three partners have their bids passed along, but the fourth partner gets dumped for being too damn slow. By dumping slowpokes like the fourth partner, page latency is reduced.\nA standard timeout also helps publishers by “exposing reporting analytics on which bidders are late more often than others,” said John Ellis, an engineer at Yieldbot.\nSo what’s the catch? \nDevelopers of header wrappers insist that they increase revenue, reduce page latency and ease tag management. While those claims may be true, developers are also incentivized to tout their products.\nAlthough several wrappers are free to use, some charge a fee . Aside from a potential additional cost, sources said that publishers may be weary of working with yet another third party to implement the wrappers. And there was some skepticism that even for free wrappers, there may come a fee down the road once publishers are ingrained in the habit of using wrappers. Another disincentive to adopting wrappers is driven by inertia.\n“Wrappers are very sticky,” said Heather Swarnes, vp of Conversant. “Once a publisher integrates with a wrapper and spends resources setting up all configurations for each adapter, it would take a considerable amount of effort to swap that out.”\nRelated",

      "text": "NEW YORK - Hop on a virtual sleigh ride to the North Pole. Stand on the \"Naughty or Nice O'Meter.\" Snap a selfie and see your face on a dancing elf. The Santa experience has gotten a makeover as many malls install shows and games they hope will lure shoppers who are buying more online.\nAbout 40 malls in the U.S. and one in London have the high-tech Santa displays, most of them located near major cities that tend to house pricier stores. Taking photos on Santa's lap costs about $30 and up, around the same as at other malls, but most of the malls say people can walk through without purchasing anything.\nIn this Thursday, Nov. 17, 2016, photo, a child has his photo taken with Santa Roger Edmonds at the Santa HQ at the Chandler Mall, in Chandler, Ariz. The Santa experience has gotten a makeover as many malls install shows and games they hope will lure shoppers who are buying more online. (AP Photo/Matt York)\n\"It was a half-hour of entertainment that was free,\" says Katie Mass, who took her twin daughters through Santa's Flight Academy, a 3,000-square-foot setup at The Mall at Short Hills in New Jersey.\nShe had gone to the mall to return some dresses, but had to stop when her 2-year olds saw the spectacle. \"They started running,\" says the stay-at-home mom from Westfield, New Jersey.\nThe girls tapped touch screens, pulled levers and watched as flight suits were virtually fit over their bodies on a screen. The final stop was a two-story tall enclosed sleigh that dropped fake snow upon them. One girl made snow angels on the floor while her sister danced under the colorful lasers. \"It was extravagant and well done,\" says Mass.\nMalls are hoping the over-the-top Santa visits remind people what brick-and-mortar stores can offer. They're increasingly trying to offer special experiences as they compete with online rivals, says Howard Davidowitz, chairman of New York-based retail consulting group Davidowitz & Associates.\n\"The parents love it, the kids love it and Amazon can't do it,\" says Davidowitz.\nSanta's Flight Academy was developed by mall operator Taubman Centers Inc., which spent two years on the idea. After testing it last year at The Mall of San Juan in Puerto Rico, the company rolled it out to 11 other Taubman malls this year, replacing a low-tech ice palace that had housed Santa for years. Like other malls with elaborate Santa sets, Taubman declined to say how much it spent on Santa's Flight Academy.\nGuy Perry, a manager of a Disney Store at Taubman's Westfarms mall in West Hartford, Connecticut, credited this year's \"great\" store traffic to Santa's Flight Academy. Kids come into the store and tell him how they helped Santa take flight.\n\"It is getting a lot of good reviews,\" says Perry.\nAn old-school Santa display got the boot at Queens Center in New York as the mall this year installed Santa HQ, a set sponsored by cable TV channel HGTV.\nAs kids stand on the \"Naughty or Nice O'Meter,\" they can watch their names pop up on Santa's \"Nice List\" screen. In another room they can take a selfie and see themselves as dancing elves. In the last room, they're handed tablets that use augmented reality technology to make it appear as if cartoon elves are popping out of the walls and packing gifts. The entire set and trees put on a light show every 20 minutes that is synchronized with holiday music.\nQuite a difference from last year's Santa setup: A couch and some Christmas trees.\n\"It's Santa-meets-21st-century-technology,\" says John Scaturro, a marketing manager for the mall.\nQueens Center's owner, Macerich Co., first installed Santa HQ at some malls two years ago. This year, that expanded to 15 malls from 10. As of November, sales of photos with Santa at Queens Center nearly tripled from last year, says Scaturro.\nIn addition to bringing in shoppers, the set is an advertisement for HGTV. Screens air the network's home improvement and real estate programs. Stars of its shows were set to sign autographs and take photos at two Macerich malls.\nIt's cartoon characters that share the spotlight with Santa at another mall display, the DreamWorks DreamPlace. The set, created by DreamWorks Animation, stars characters from the movie studio's \"Kung Fu Panda\" films — replacing the green ogre from the \"Shrek\" movies that were last year's focus. Thirteen malls are using the set, which uses rumbling seats, wind and mist to create a virtual ride on Santa's sleigh.\nWhatever malls are spending on the Santa spectacles is worth it, says Davidowitz. Santa has always attracted crowds, he says, but adding a high-tech twist is likely to bring in even more who may stop to shop.\n\"I don't see many things out there that equal Santa's power to draw crowds,\" he says.",

      "text": "by Kevin Bruce Francisco · December 6, 2016 \nThe Seattle-based commerce company has once again made it easier to shop with the introduction of the Amazon Go . It basically eliminates the need to fall in line when you shop for groceries. \nAll you need to do is to go inside the Amazon Go store, scan the app on your phone at the entrance, get the necessary items, and leave. Using advanced technologies like computer vision, deep learning algorithms, and sensor fusion, the store ‘knows’ what you pick up from the shelf and once you leave the place, items checked out will be reflected on your Amazon account. \nThe 1,800-square-foot store will be open to the public “early 2017” at the company’s home turf in Washington. Watch the video above to see how this could reshape the future of shopping for groceries.",

      "text": "Amazon testing checkout-free grocery store The Associated Press Published: Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window) \nNEW YORK (AP) — Amazon is testing a grocery store model in Seattle that works without checkout lines. \nCalled Amazon Go, shoppers scan their Amazon app when they enter the store, and then sensors register items that shoppers pick up and automatically charge them to the Amazon app. \nIf a shopper puts the item back they aren’t charged. \nThe store offers ready-to-eat meals, staples like bread and milk and meal-making kits. \nThe store is in testing and is open to Amazon employees on a trial run. It is expected to open to the public in early 2017. \nThe e-commerce powerhouse has also been dipping its toe into the physical realm. It has opened three bookstores in California, Oregon and Washington with traditional check outs. Two more are in the works in Illinois and Massachusetts. \nCowen & Co. analyst John Blackledge says the new grocery store is just one way that Amazon has been setting its sights on the food and beverage category, a lucrative $795 billion market. It also offers grocery delivery in some markets and Prime Now for last-minute items delivered in one or two hours. \n“We are encouraged by Amazon’s growing footprint in this category, which we see as ripe for potential disruption given younger demos increasingly purchasing food and beverage grocery items via digital channels,” Blackledge said. \nAmazon.com Inc. shares rose $18.69, or 2.5 percent, to $759.03 in afternoon trading Monday. Its shares are up almost 13 percent since a year ago. Share this: ",

      "text": "Don't Miss: Amazon 12 Days of Deals Sale \nNASA said its Cassini spacecraft has successfully made the first close dive past the outer edges of Saturn's rings since beginning its penultimate mission phase on November 30, but did not obtain views of the planet near the time of closest approach. Don't Miss: Victoria's Secret Fashion Show 2016 \n\"Cassini's imaging cameras obtained views of Saturn about two days before crossing through the ring plane, but not near the time of closest approach,\" NASA said in a statement on Monday. \n\"The focus of this first close pass was the engine maneuver and observations by Cassini's other science instruments. Future dives past the rings will feature some of the mission's best views of the outer regions of the rings and small, nearby moons,\" it added. \nCassini crossed through the plane of Saturn's rings on Sunday at a distance of approximately 91,000 kilometres above Saturn's cloud tops. \nThis is the approximate location of a faint, dusty ring produced by the planet's small moons Janus and Epimetheus, and just 11,000 kilometres from the centre of Saturn's F ring. \nAbout an hour prior to the ring-plane crossing, the spacecraft performed a short burn of its main engine that lasted about six seconds. \nAbout 30 minutes later, as it approached the ring plane, Cassini closed its canopy-like engine cover as a protective measure. \nA few hours after the ring-plane crossing, Cassini began a complete scan across the rings with its radio science experiment to study their structure in great detail. \n\"It's taken years of planning, but now that we're finally here, the whole Cassini team is excited to begin studying the data that come from these ring-grazing orbits,\" said Linda Spilker, Cassini project scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California. \n\"This is a remarkable time in what's already been a thrilling journey,\" Spilker said. \nEach of Cassini's orbits for the remainder of the mission will last one week. \nThe next pass by the rings' outer edges is planned for December 11. \nThe ring-grazing orbits -- 20 in all -- will continue until April 22, when the last close flyby of Saturn's moon Titan will reshape Cassini's flight path. \nWith that encounter, Cassini will leap over the rings, making the first of 22 plunges through the 2,400-kilometre gap between Saturn and its innermost ring on April 26. \nOn September 15, the mission will conclude with a final plunge into Saturn's atmosphere, NASA said. \nLaunched in 1997, Cassini has been touring the Saturn system since arriving there in 2004 for an up-close study of the planet, its rings and moons.",

      "text": "0 0 \nNEW YORK: Amazon.com Inc said on Monday it has opened a brick-and-mortar grocery store in Seattle without lines or checkout counters, kicking off new competition with supermarket chains. \nAmazon Go, the online shopping company's new 1,800-square-foot (167-square-meter) store, uses sensors to detect what items shoppers have picked off the shelves and sends a bill to their Amazon accounts if they do not replace them. \nThe store marks Amazon's latest push into groceries, one of the biggest retail categories it has yet to master. The company currently delivers produce and groceries to homes through its AmazonFresh service. \n\"It’s a great recognition that their e-commerce model doesn’t work for every product,\" said analyst Jan Dawson of Jackdaw Research, noting that physical stores would complement AmazonFresh. \n\"If there were hundreds of these stores around the country, it would be a huge threat\" to supermarket chains, he said. \nThe S&P 1500 food retail index, which includes Kroger Co, Whole Foods Market Inc and other companies, was down 0.5 percent at the close. Shares of Amazon closed up about 2.6 percent. \nAmazon Go is available now for employees of the company and is expected to be open to the public early next year, Amazon said. \nIf tests are successful, Amazon plans to open more than 2,000 grocery stores, the Wall Street Journal reported on Monday, citing sources. The company is considering other store formats, including one that would let drivers pick up goods at the curbside, the report said. Amazon declined to comment on the report. \n\"The checkout lines are always the most inefficient parts of the store experience,\" said Neil Saunders, managing director of retail research firm Conlumino. \"Not only would you save a lot on labor costs, you actually would make the process much quicker for consumers and much more satisfying.\" \nStill, the grab-and-go experience would take getting used to, he said. Some people may \"feel like they stole\" an item, Saunders said. 0 0 Amazon opens line-free grocery store in challenge to supermarkets   Print/170216-Amazon-opens-line-free-grocery-store-in-challenge-to-supermarkets/   \"Amazon opens line-free grocery store in challenge to supermarkets\" is https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/170216-Amazon-opens-line-free-grocery-store-in-challenge-to-supermarkets+TheNewsInternational- ",

      "text": "© 2016 Time Inc. All rights reserved. Why Amazon’s Convenience Store Test Is Worth Notice \nThere it goes again. Amazon, the most disruptive retailer since Sears Roebuck and Montgomery Ward hit the scene is noodling again on something new. It’s called Amazon Go , a convenience-store-sized shop staffed by robots and sensors rather than humans. \nAs with much of what Amazon does, this is only a test. Its current Amazon Go store in Seattle is only open to employees for now. \nBut Amazon is like a computer virus: It probes, it examines, it learns. And then it attacks. The company announced Amazon Go with a video , and Fortune ’s Andrew Nusca and Robert Hackett also produced a video discussing the move. Get Data Sheet , Fortune’s technology newsletter, where this essay originated. \nI’m with Nusca, who argues that Amazon @amazon amzn is a master at building on top of its existing infrastructure. Just as Amazon Web Services was able to jumpstart itself by being its own best customer, Amazon’s massive distribution network is a natural partner to a chain of convenience stores. \nAmazon doesn’t succeed at everything it does. (Think: Fire Phone .) Nor does it do everything quickly. It has been investigating the grocery business for years without achieving the dominance it has in online commerce. But when Amazon tries something new, it is worth paying attention.",

      "title": "Amazon’s new grocery store highlights a huge hole in Donald Trump’s promise on jobs",
      "text": "(Tasos Katopodis/Getty Images)\nAmazon debuted its new Go store on Monday, and the design of the store hints at a future of shopping with no human interaction. The grocery store will allow shoppers to check in to the store with their phones, grab what they need, and simply walk out of the store.\nThe shopper's Amazon account will be billed for the cost of the goods. Customers won't have to stand in line, and critically, they won't have to interact with a cashier.\nThat's great news for Amazon customers who detest human interaction or waiting , but it's bad news for cashiers, a critical part of the US workforce, and it highlights the challenge Donald Trump will face as he bids to boost the US labor market.\nDuring his campaign, Trump pledged to \" bring back the jobs \" by cutting taxes and regulation and pulling out of trade deals . Free trade agreements such as the North American Free Trade Agreement or Trans Pacific Partnership allowed companies to shift jobs overseas to places like Mexico and China and decimate the middle class, he said.\nThe argument struck a chord, particularly with white working class voters , propelling Trump to the White House.\nMore recently, he has threatened to clamp down on companies moving jobs overseas .\nDespite the convincing nature of Trump's anti-offshoring argument, Amazon Go proves the biggest danger isn't jobs going overseas, but rather the march of technological progress.\nAccording to the Bureau of Labor Statistics , 856,850 Americans were employed as grocery store cashiers in May 2015, the most recent data available. Theoretically, Amazon Go's model grocery store puts a chunk of these jobs at risk. Include all cashiers (there doesn't seem to be a reason the Amazon Go model couldn't work for say, clothes or books) and that's roughly 3.5 million people in roles that are at risk of being automated away.\nView photos\nwalmart checkout cashier shopping More (Joe Raedle / Staff / Getty Images)\nTo put that into perspective, t he World Trade Organization estimated that between 2001 and 2013 the US had lost 3.2 million jobs due to outsourcing to China. This isn't an apples to apples comparison, but the numbers are striking.\nThat's not to say that every cashier job is going to disappear overnight. Amazon is only opening a pilot Go store in Seattle next year. And cashier jobs have held remarkably steady over the last decade, even as online shopping became the dominant trend in retail.\nThe change, however, highlights the ever-shifting landscape of the American workforce.\nThis point isn't a new one. Everyone from liberal, Nobel-winning economist Paul Krugman to Republican Senator Ben Sasse have noted that technological developments are a bigger threat to American workers than trade. The World Economic Forum estimated 5 million jobs in 15 developed economies are at risk of automation by 2020 and Citi projected that 57% of jobs in OECD nations are at risk of automation.\nIn heavy manufacturing, jobs once done by multiple humans are being replaced by robots. Panera Bread is trying out machines that take and deliver your order, all without a human server. Even in journalism there are programs that are starting to automate simple article writing.\nView photos\nhoward marks More Read More (Screengrab via Bloomberg)\nHoward Marks, the founder of investment firm Oaktree Capital, riffed on this topic earlier this year, pointing out that US manufacturing output is near an all-time high, even though US manufacturing employment is down 37% since the peak in 1979.\n\"Perhaps if the government wants to preserve jobs it should just outlaw productivity gains,\" he said .\nThat, of course, isn't feasible. There is likely a long-run benefit to making processes more affordable and quicker.\nRather, the point is that refocusing the labor market on the jobs and skills that will be needed in the future is a productive way to allow innovation and keep America employed.\nThat kind of policy was barely mentioned in Trump's campaign. In fact, the president-elect hardly mentioned the issue of technological advances destroying jobs at all, so it appears to be a huge blind spot in his proposed economic plan.\nTrump is focused on the wrong problem when it comes to the labor market. Instead of getting old manufacturing jobs back from overseas, the government should be focused on retraining workers for the new labor market.\nNOW WATCH: This hidden iPhone feature will boost your reception\nMore From Business Insider\nTRUMP TREASURY SECRETARY: 'There were a lot of people in California and New York who wanted to stop being friends'\nTrump's massive economic plan is like 'taking a well-done steak and putting it on broil'\nOne restaurant group stands to be the big winner if Trump cuts everyone's taxes",

      "text": "If the hype is to be believed, Amazon will be targeting Australia from Sept. 2017 with extreme prejudice.\n\"We are going to destroy the retail environment in Australia,\" an Amazon staff member is reported to have said , according to the Australian Financial Review .\nAs further indication of its intentions, there were numerous reports Wednesday the company has local trademarks pending across a variety of products, including its home assistant Amazon Echo .\nSEE ALSO: Kill the drones, Amazon Go is an actual game changer\nWhile Australians can already shop on Amazon, spending about A$500 to A$700 million according to research published in August by Citi, international shipping rates and wait times can be a deterrent.\nThe rumoured launch of local distribution centres could make all the difference though, and while Amazon has been coy on offering any details, it could also launch its Prime subscription that guarantees free two-day shipping as well as access to its streaming service, Prime Video.\nIf it enters the market in the next two years, Citi estimates Amazon could reach A$3.5 to A$4 billion in sales within five years of launching, capturing around 14 percent of all online sales.\nAmazon is known for acting aggressively, but will it be the annihilation so many are predicting?\nLocal online business have different opinions on the matter.\nThe optimist, to a point Beauty retailer Adore Beauty is a local digital success story, expanding into China this year via Alibaba's TMall platform.\nKate Morris, founder of Adore, told Mashable digital retailers have been competing against international merchants for years.\nNaturally, she offered a optimistic outlook for specialist retailers like herself. \"We can compete on a better depth of knowledge for our particular vertical,\" she said. \"[Amazon is] not that influential a player as far as premium beauty.\"\nHer customers tend to prefer other beauty specialists such as Mecca or Sephora, she added, noting that Amazon is not something that comes up often in their consumer surveys.\n\"I think there are a lot of lazy retailers in Australia.\"\nStill, there is no competing with Amazon on logistical efficiency if the company decides to open fulfilment warehouses locally. It may set a new local standard.\n\"You've certainly got to keep up, but you're probably not going to win,\" Morris said.\nThat means any retailer not adding value in terms of customer service or a unique brand proposition — in other words, purely transactional sites that compete solely on price — are going to come up against some serious competition.\nCiti predicted electronic retailers like JB Hi-Fi would feel the greatest impact, with sales potentially dropping by six percent.\n\"If you're going to compete on price, you better be the biggest or have some sort of supply chain efficiency that's going to allow you to offer a cheaper price,\" she said. \"You'd be hard pressed to deliver on that up against Amazon.\n\"It has the potential to be extremely disruptive, because I think there are a lot of lazy retailers in Australia,\" Morris added.\nThe skeptic with an eye on eBay Nati Harpaz, CEO of deals site Catch Of The Day, is not 100 percent convinced by the Amazon rumours.\nHe told Mashable he was undecided whether Amazon was coming to Australia in 2017 at all, adding that he's yet to hear from any of the warehouses or local suppliers the company would need to get started.\n\"I think there's a lot of media hype, but no substance to it,\" he said.\nDespite this, Harpaz predicts Amazon could do some damage to big box stores should it arrive.\n\"The difference between what Amazon does and some of the big chains, is Amazon has access to cheap capital because they raise money and they're willing to fund their losses,\" Harpaz said. \"That's a hard thing for anyone to compete with.\"\nHe also suggested international competitor eBay could be both a challenge and a target for Amazon in Australia, something Citi agreed with.\nAmazon makes about one third of its sales from third-party retailers who sell on the website, Citi wrote. That's a space eBay dominates locally along with a 22 percent market share of all Australian online sales.\nImage: Getty Images\nStill, Harpaz pushed back on the notion Amazon could offer a fully fledged Prime service locally from 2017, thanks to Australia's relatively high postal costs.\nShipping and fulfilment are definitely Amazon's sweet spot, however.\nAccording to Citi's analysis, Amazon is likely to convince local customers by making itself known, as it is in other markets, for impossibly swift service. Overseas, it has introduced regional sortation and delivery centres in addition to major fulfillments sites to \"improve the 'final mile' experience for consumers.\"\nThose are expenses local retailers might find it hard to match, although the shipping phenomenon has been accompanied by criticism regarding Amazon's treatment of its warehouse workers.\nDespite Amazon's logistical expertise, Harpaz suggested Prime may not be fully fledged in Australia if it does indeed launch in late 2017, at least not immediately.\n\"Amazon only offers Prime on goods that they stock,\" Harpaz said. \"It's mostly available on things Amazon has in its own distribution centre or that they do the fulfilment for other suppliers.\n\"To do that in Australia, it's going to take them a bit of time.\"\nAmazon and eBay have been approached by Mashable for comment.\nBONUS: Take this festive virtual tour of Santa’s house at the North Pole",

      "text": "30 Share This Post : \nI recently purchased a new Canon Wireless printer from Amazon . I am a Mac user, so I figured I would use the AirPrint feature and print wirelessly. Everything was perfect, until I wanted to print some coupons out from Coupons.com . My coupons were printing TINY — maybe like 25% of the original size. I searched and searched for a solution. I contacted Coupons.com support, and they had no idea how they could help me. I finally found the solution on my own, and I am posting this just in case others are having this same issue. Here’s the fix (Mac Users) 1) This problem, in my opinion, is caused by the “AirPrint” wireless printing feature in your wireless printer. 2) Go to your computer settings by clicking the Apple icon on the top left of your screen and go to System Preferences. 3) Select “Printers & Scanners” 4) Delete the printer from the list by clicking ‘-‘ at the bottom of the list. Then add it back again by clicking ‘+’. 5) You’ll see your printer appear. Towards the bottom, you’ll see different options for types of printer. Change it from AirPrint to just the standard printer name/model. Do not use the “Bonjour” one, instead use the same exact name of your printer and for the type of printer as well. You will STILL be able to print wirelessly, so no worries! Try printing a coupon and see if it works now . Let us know if this works for you, leave a comment below! Find more in: Frugal Talk , Shark Bites Latasha Whitmore \nOh my goodness!!! Thank you soooo much!! I was having the same problem and this totally solved it!! FreebieShark \nYay! You’re welcome Latasha! I know, it drove me nuts until I finally figured out how to fix it. Nichole \nTHANK YOU! I actually had to download a different driver from the Canon website as “airprint” was my only option. But after doing so, this works beautifully!! Thank you again! FreebieShark \nYou’re welcome Nichole! Happy to help! Michelle Pamplin Ray \nOMYGOSH!! Thank you s much!! I had all but given up using my MacBook to print. I have struggled with the tiny coupon issue for over a year, and multiple internet searches have not helped UNTIL TODAY!! Thank you! Thank you! FreebieShark \nYou’re very welcome Michelle! Rebecca \nThank you so much!! Don’t know how you figured this out, but I truly appreciate you sharing this. I can print coupons again!! FreebieShark \nYou’re welcome Rebecca! jv \nOMG after searching google for the last 45 minutes i stumbled upon this posting and it finally worked thank you!! went and checked the apple forums and they had me reinstall all the software and all it take was a small 5 second change!! thank you Kait \nHOLY CRAP. THANK YO . My printer kept trying to print the coupons as if they were 4×6 photos and the default setting was letter. I almost took the printer back to the store. You are awesome 🙂 FreebieShark",

      "title": "Amazon Replaces Gift Cards with 'Amazon Pay' Balance",
      "text": "Amazon Replaces Gift Cards with 'Amazon Pay' Balance, Touts Faster Checkout Pay with Amazon will let you pay using saved cards on other sites Gift card balance is now Amazon Pay balance, can be used as wallet Sellers will also be able to sign up for Amazon's Easy Ship logistics \nAmazon has quietly made a change on Wednesday where it replaced its Gift Card balance with Amazon Pay, which the company is touting as the fastest way to pay. It's essentially the same as gift card balance - and unlike wallets, there are no limits on how much you can transact in a day, and the money stored in your Amazon Pay balance is only valid for one year, post which it will expire - but instead of having to purchase gift cards, you can simply top it up directly on the Amazon website. \nThe new Amazon Pay balance is handy if you shop a lot on Amazon, and don't want to enter your OTP regularly when shopping - once you've filled up some balance, you can just use that money to complete shopping with a single click. There are some restrictions - you can't buy gift cards, gold coins, or bank cards, on Amazon.in using the Pay balance - but otherwise, you can use it to buy all other items on the website. \"We are happy to launch Amazon Pay Balance. All customers have to do is load their balance; a friction-free payment experience awaits them,\" added Sriram Jagannathan Vice President Payments, Amazon India. Your remaining gift card balance is automatically transferred to Amazon Pay, and for refunds on cash on delivery items, you have the option of choosing Amazon Pay to receive the money, which Amazon says is much faster than choosing a refund to your bank.\nHowever, you can't transfer money from your Amazon Pay balance to your bank account - this means that the money is effectively locked into Amazon's ecosystem. Amazon plans to incentivise usage of Amazon Pay by giving special offers to use it. You can add up to Rs. 10,000 at one time, though there is no limit on the number of transactions you can make. \nAmazon had earlier launched Pay with Amazon in India - it has not linked the two yet, but it would be an interesting way for the company to expand into payments, at a time when other e-commerce companies are investing in areas such as UPI (Flipkart), or have their own wallets (Snapdeal, Paytm).",

According to a Walmart report in 2014, India’s B2B e-commerce industry is expected to be larger than B2C market and it will grow to $700 billion by 2020 from $300 billion in that year. \nIn September, the company had invested Rs 115 Crore into the wholesale unit, which currently serves SMBs in Bangalore and Mangalore.

      "text": "Email \nSACRAMENTO -- It was a miracle on 34th Street for the children of the Next Move Charity. Santa arrived early on a special 18-wheeler sleigh packed with presents from Amazon Prime. \n“It's one of the best things about working at Amazon - having the opportunity to give back to the communities where we live and work,” said Brian Fontenot, with Amazon. \nThe families, who have been struggling with homelessness, many for years were greeted by Santa Claus, at the Next Move facility on 34th Street in Sacramento. The children got a chance to sit on Santa's lap and receive a gift from the man in red. \n“It's a jewelry maker, I haven’t really used these before it's cool because usually I don’t have enough money to buy stuff like this,” said Tyeisha Watt, a child who received a gift. \n“I got this little monkey because my mom is in labor today and I thought it would be nice to give my baby sister a monkey,” said Terrance Watt a child who received a gift. \nThe online retail giant chose to help Next Move because of their dedication to helping families suffering with chronic homelessness. \nTricia Rosenbam the executive director of Next Move says this donation helps roughly 150 families through the holidays. The families submitted a wish list of things they desperately needed, and Amazon made sure the items arrived fast. \n“Not everyone can shop at Amazon, but we want to bring some of that holiday cheer to the local community and help them be a part of it,” said Fontenot. \nEven Santa teared up spending time with the kids, agreeing Amazon made the good list, by bringing smiles to these families faces. \n“The looks in the eyes are tremendous so its really a wonderful thing for us to be able to give to the children that don’t have anything,” Santa Claus. \nAmazon is on a national day of giving tour, they will be stopping at locations across the United States to make donations just like the one at Next Move, their next stop Tuesday is in Modesto at the center for Human Services. 38.581572 -121.494400 ",

      "text": "Holiday shopping continues to bring good cheer to online retailers like Amazon ( AMZN ) and others, with overall U.S. sales up 7.8% to $52.16 billion year over year, for the period from Nov. 1 to Dec. 5, reports Adobe Systems ( ADBE ).\nBut that's a slowdown from growth of 10.3% in the year-earlier period, as tabulated by Adobe Digital Insights . For the full holiday shopping period, from Nov. 1 to Dec. 31, Adobe estimates 11% growth to $91.6 billion, down from 12.7% growth in 2015.\nThe best-selling electronics included Sony 's ( SNE ) PlayStation 4, the Apple ( AAPL ) iPad, Samsung's 4K TVS and Microsoft 's ( MSFT ) Xbox.\nMondays are typically big online shopping days, as consumers plan their spending over the weekend and procrastinators kick into high gear, Adobe said. Dec. 5 brought in $1.94 billion, an 8.7% increase year over year.\nIBD'S TAKE : Black Friday and Cyber Monday always provide a sales surge for Amazon, but shares are trading about 10% below their all-time high set on Oct. 6, and also below the key 50-day moving average. Who's a leader now? Check out IBD's Tech Leaders to keep up to date.\nBlack Friday, the day after Thanksgiving, set a record with $3.34 billion in U.S. online retail sales, up 21.6%. Black Friday was the first day in U.S. retail history with more than $1 billion in sales via mobile devices, with such sales jumping 33% to $1.2 billion. To date, mobile has brought in $16.17 billion in revenue, driving 49% of visits to retail sites and 31% of purchases.\nOnline sales for Cyber Monday, the first Monday after Thanksgiving, rose 12% year over year to $3.45 billion.\nSpending by Apple users has outpaced that of Android users. The average order value on an Apple mobile device is $132, with Android users at $118.\nAmazon, though not releasing sales figures, said the Thanksgiving holiday weekend, including Cyber Monday, was its \"best ever.\" The Amazon Echo Dot, Amazon Fire TV Stick with Alexa Voice Remote, Fire tablet, and Amazon Echo were the best-selling Amazon devices.\nAmazon stock finished 0.7% higher at 764.68 in the stock market today .\nThe strength in online sales did not carry over to brick-and-mortar stores. According to RetailNext , combined sales on Thanksgiving Day and Black Friday at physical retail stores fell 4.7%, with in-store traffic down 5.1%.\nAdobe's figures are based on aggregated and anonymous data from 23 billion visits to retail websites.\nLoading the player...",

      "text": "Amazon testing cashier-free retail store \nWednesday, December 07, 2016 Tweet \nSAN FRANCISCO, United States (AFP) — Amazon on Monday unveiled a new kind of retail store, with no cashiers. \nIn the concept store in Amazon’s hometown of Seattle, Washington, customers can fill their shopping carts and walk out — with the costs tallied up and billed on their accounts with the US online giant. \nAmazon Go, which is being tested in a single store with Amazon employees and will open to the public next year, is a “checkout-free shopping experience made possible by the same types of technologies used in self-driving cars: computer vision, sensor fusion, and deep learning,” its Web page, says. \n“Our ‘Just Walk Out’ technology automatically detects when products are taken from or returned to the shelves and keeps track of them in a virtual cart. When you’re done shopping, you can just leave the store. Shortly after, we’ll charge your Amazon account and send you a receipt.” \nThe store in Seattle of some 170 square meters (1,800 square feet) is selling a variety of food products including breads, cheeses and ready-to-eat meals, as well as Amazon meal kits, which has the ingredients for home-cooked dishes. \nIt was not immediately clear whether Amazon will expand this model with more physical stores or offer the technology to other retailers. \nThe online giant has been rumoured to be looking at creating brick and mortar outlets but, so far, has only announced a handful of bookselling outlets.

      "text": "up vote 1 down vote favorite \nI currently have 2 Amazon EC2 Windows Server 2008 instances setup with a load balancer. My problem now is that I need both instances to be able to access a single file system source (I'm trying to use Amazon S3). \nBasically now I'm using TntDrive to mount an S3 bucket on both of my servers, and it works fine. However, once I setup my IIS server and point a website to the network drive that TntDrive mounted, it all goes to hell. It seems like it's caching files somewhere but I've checked TntDrive's settings and all the caching appears to be turned off, unless it's doing some caching that I can't turn off. \nAm I going about this the wrong way? Is there a better way to do this? \nThanks.",

      "text": "Researchers reproduced the web interfaces of major Internet giants to test carbon-reducing strategies. \nThis story was first featured on Ensia . \nReducing the carbon footprint of what we buy isn’t easy, but the opportunity for impact is substantial: In the United States, producing and delivering consumer purchases releases twice as much carbon into the atmosphere as home energy use and personal travel. By gathering and sharing information on carbon emissions associated with their products, companies can make environmentally friendly choices easier for consumers and boost their own reputations as planet-friendly businesses. \nAdvances in online technology provide effective and inexpensive opportunities to do this, according to a recent study (PDF) conducted by the U.S. Department of Energy’s National Renewable Energy Laboratory. \nTo explore strategies for sharing carbon footprint information and evaluate the impact of offering consumers carbon offset options, NREL researchers designed a series of experiments focused on four industries — online retailing, ride sharing, video streaming and short-term lodging. \nUsing crowdsourced online survey services, they reproduced the online interfaces of actual companies to track the decision process of participants offered green choices. Follow-up questions explored participants’ reactions to these options. Their findings demonstrate that providing green choices can lower their overall carbon footprints and improve customer satisfaction. \nProviding green choices can lower overall carbon footprints and improve customer satisfaction. \nResearchers reproduced the online interface of a major U.S. online retailer, Amazon, to test carbon-reducing strategies in online retailing. Amazon Prime members receive free two-day shipping, but can also select free no-rush shipping and earn a $1 credit. \nIn one experiment, the researchers asked participants how they would respond if they were given a chance to accept carbon offsets instead of the credit, and how their opinion of Amazon would change if the company offered carbon-neutral no-rush shipping. Researchers found that green shipping was as popular as the credit and improved Amazon’s environmental image. In addition, since the carbon offsets generally were less expensive than the $1 credit, offering this service to customers could save the company money. \nA second experiment gave customers the option to add carbon offsets for shipping to their bills, with the cost of this offset varying with the product and the shipping option selected. When adding the carbon credit was the default, 88.2 percent of customers chose to do so. When the carbon credit was not the default option, 40 percent of customers still chose to add it. \nThe researchers used Uber as a model system for exploring the potential for carbon offsets in the ride-share industry. \nThe experiment was similar to that conducted using the Amazon interface, providing customers an option to add the cost of carbon offsets to their bill. The cost of the offset was varied between 2 cents and 20 cents per trip based on estimated costs of carbon of $6 per 1.1 tons and $50 per 1.1 tons and assuming a 10-mile trip and the 2012 U.S. average fuel economy for light-duty vehicles. \nGiven the scenario of a 10-mile trip every weekday for a year, participants then were asked if they would be willing to add the cost of carbon offsets to their bill for every ride. Depending on the carbon price, this would increase the total cost by either $5.95 or $49.58. Results showed close to three-quarters of customers were willing to add the offset for a single trip at either carbon price and to offset emissions associated with all of their Uber trips when the total yearly cost was $5.95. Even when the cost for all future trips was high, half of all participants remained willing to purchase offsets. \nTheir results support two basic \"design principles\" for initiatives aimed at helping consumers reduce their carbon emissions. \nFor video streaming, the research team used the model of Netflix. Content can be streamed in standard, high or ultrahigh definition — with the carbon footprint increasing with increased definition. Subscribers may not realize that higher definition streaming isn’t necessary for all content. The researchers provided information on the carbon footprints of the three streaming options to the Netflix user and found that participants tended to choose a lower resolution stream. \nNot only that, but 42 percent of participants said they would allow Netflix to automatically provide the least carbon-intensive streaming resolution, adjusting the definition level to the needs of the type of video being streamed. \"This response could represent an opportunity for Netflix to reduce operating costs, lower its corporate environmental footprint and improve customer satisfaction with one simple innovation,\" the researchers noted. \nIn the realm of short-term lodging, the researchers used the example of Airbnb, a company that connects customers with hosts who offer space in their homes as an alternative to hotels. The researchers found that, on average, potential Airbnb hosts could expect to receive just under $7 more per booking if they qualify as providing an energy-efficient rental. However, when participants were given the option to add between 50 cents and $3 to their bills to make their stays carbon neutral, less than 13 percent indicated that they would be willing to purchase these carbon offsets. \nThe researchers noted that their results support two basic \"design principles\" for initiatives aimed at helping consumers reduce their carbon emissions: provide credible information at the point of decision and keep things simple. \n\"These experiments indicate significant untapped potential for firms to reduce the climate impact of their product chains and improve customer satisfaction at very low or even negative cost,\" the researchers concluded. \"Such opportunities certainly exist in other industries as well.\" Topics:",

      "title": "[Video] Amazon’s Grab-And-Go Grocery Store − There's No Need To Line Up At A Cashier, Simply Walk Out The Door",
      "text": "View Comments Imagine not having to queue up to pay for your groceries anymore – that’s exactly the concept of Amazon’s latest service. With the \"just walk out technology\" as they call it, Amazon Go, literally allows customers to enter the store, grab what they want and walk out without ever having to stand in a checkout line. Using the Amazon app, customers will walk in and tap their phones at the entrance, and the machine will automatically sense and track items customers pick up. The technology of this virtual cart will also be able to sense if items are removed from the cart. There will also be cameras following the customer around and watching the shelf to determine whether multiples of the same item are taken, or if items are consumed. Once the customer walks out, the app will charge their Amazon account. However, if Amazon is not confident about how many items you took or what you took, they may end up confirming with you. Phil Lempert, a food marketing expert based in Los Angeles calls the technology “amazing”. \"When you look at the store itself in the video (and presumably it is the actual store), they have done a great job of merchandising, and having \"meal kits\" available is simply brilliant. As the meal-kit industry struggles due to the shipping/logistics aspect, Amazon Go could be a venue where they could succeed,\" said Lempert, reported by USA TODAY. Analyst Jan Dawson of Jackdaw Research says this could be a game changer for supermarkets. \"If there were hundreds of these stores around the country, it would be a huge threat\" to supermarket chains. \"The ease with which you can shop a website, the same thing is going to happen for physical stores,\" he told CBC. Currently, it has only been open to Amazon employees but the Seattle-based company says the store in the same location will be open to the public in early 2017. Watch the video below, and be amazed at this advanced shopping technology. ",
