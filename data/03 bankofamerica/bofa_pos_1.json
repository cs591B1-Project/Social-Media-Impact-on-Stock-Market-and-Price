      "text": "Marilyn Torres, Bank Of America, talks about opportunities at the job fair with Jossalberto Briceno, his wife Can Hui and son Wesley, 4 months. (Photo by Dean Musgrove, Los Angeles Daily News,SCNG) \nWOODLAND HILLS >> Two weeks ago, U.S. Army Specialist Aisha Umar finished a three-year stint in the service and was worried about landing a civilian job.\nA day before Veterans Day, she and a thousand U.S. veterans got a hero’s welcome in Woodland Hills on Thursday at one of the largest veterans job fair events in the state.\n“I feel welcomed. I feel honored. I wasn’t expecting this,” said Umar, 27, of Canoga Park, who hopes to return to USC and get a job as a statistical data analyst, gazing at nearly 100 prospective employers eager to hire vets.\n\n\n“When I got out two weeks ago, I didn’t think anyone would hire veterans.”\nThe 11th Honor a Hero — Hire a Vet Job and Resource Fair drew an estimated 1,000 veterans from across the Southland to the Warner Center Marriott for a day of encouragement, support and greetings from California companies who hoped to hire them.\n• RELATED PHOTOS: Honor a Hero-Hire a Vet Job and Resource Fair \nThe job fair, hosted by the Valley Economic Alliance and the California Employment Development Department, paired vets with 91 companies with 3,200 available jobs.\n\n\nBy focusing on veterans, they hoped to give thanks to the many Americans who served. \nThey also hoped to whittle down a 7.8 percent unemployment rate for veterans across Los Angeles County, nearly double the national rate for vets. The jobless rate for the more than 28,000 employable veterans in the city of Los Angeles was even higher, at 9.6 percent, state employment officials said, \n“Events like these are a critical part of the Valley Economic Alliance’s effort to strengthen our economy, support our brave veterans and build a more innovative San Fernando Valley,” said Kenn Phillips, its president and CEO. \n\n\n• RELATED STORY: Veterans Day events and deals for veterans, Nov. 11-12 \nThere were veterans who’d served during the Vietnam War, veterans who’d served during recent conflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq, and men and women who’d served in uniform in between.\nThey’d joined the service and had put off going to college, launching a career, starting a family and buying a home.\nNow they were ready to start new routines.\nBut since touching down at Hollywood Burbank Airport or a seaman’s landing in San Diego, CalVet officials say, many veterans have had trouble gaining civilian footing. Many need help with housing, education and, most importantly, jobs.\nAdvertisement \n\n“It’s been tough,” said Nick Johnson, 37, of Oxnard, a former Navy petty officer who served 11 years on a carrier or a destroyer, but left in July to be close to family. He has since struggled to find steady work. “A lot of places say they are veteran-friendly.\n“(But) I have had five to six interviews out of 80 applications. It’s not friendly.”\nThey streamed into the Marriott grand ballroom to be greeted by signs such as “Veterans are our friends” and lines of employer tables festooned with American flags.\n\n\n“Even at this time of low unemployment in this great country, we need to make sure that our veterans, those in particular that have served us in Afghanistan and Iraq, are welcomed with open arms,” said Patrick W. Henning Jr., director of the California Employment Development Department, during an opening ceremony. \nBefore it was over, Oxnard artist David Schwartz had unveiled an American flag-based canvas “Will to Live, Will to Serve” in honor of the late Cpl. Tibor “Ted” Rubin, a Hungarian-born Holocaust survivor who was awarded the Medal of Honor a half century after his valor in Korea. The Garden Grove veteran died last December.\n\n\nOfficials said most U.S. veterans, many who have college degrees, have the right stuff for civilian jobs. They’re loyal, highly trained and employ leadership, discipline and teamwork. And they can roll up their sleeves with a strong work ethic.\nEach year, 25,000 veterans return home to California, home to 1.8 million other vets.\n“In over 28 years of military service, I have worked alongside soldiers, airmen and Marines performing honorably in the most arduous situations imaginable,” said Dr. Vito Imbasciani, secretary of the California Department of Veterans Affairs, a former Army surgeon who served four combat tours from Desert Storm to Iraq. “So I know firsthand that veterans are the best trained and qualified of those seeking employment.”\n\n\nDan Allan, an employment program manager for the state EDD office in Lancaster, attributed the soaring unemployment rates for veterans in Southern California to fierce competition for high-tech jobs.\nEmployers seeking to hire veterans Thursday ranged from Bank of America to the U.S. Forest Service.\n“Veterans, they gave so much to this country,” said Marc Jay, a recruiter for Aerojet Rocketdyne, a rocket engine maker in Canoga Park. “It’s time to give back.\n“I’ve already met some impressive people.”\nNearly two years ago, Aubrey Strain retired from Veterans Affairs after nearly four decades at the Sepulveda or West Los Angeles VA offices. Now the Air Force veteran who’d served during Vietnam has had to hit the bricks after family woes.\n\n\n“My wife got sick, so I have to go back to work — administration, delivery, anything,” said Strain, 60, of Van Nuys, in a crisp white shirt with French cuffs and links, ready to meet a new employer. “It feels OK.\n“I’m just glad to be alive. I appreciate those companies that help veterans.”\nClick here to subscribe to Digital & Home Delivery - 50% off About the Author \nReach the author at dana.bartholomew@dailynews.com or follow Dana on Twitter: @DN_DanaBart .\nFull bio and more articles by Dana Bartholomew Back to top",

      "text": "Send Message Summary \nBAC is enjoying the bank party along with its peers, and is up 18% since its 3Q results. \nValuation remains comfortable in an absolute sense and its relative attraction is unchanged. \nOwn this stock for its improving operating leverage and take the Trump driven gyrations as they come. When we last looked at Bank of America I thought it was on 8.2x earnings for 2018, and said it was a strong buy. Now - by pure luck - it is up 18.5% and is on 10x earnings for 2018 if we assume it can get to $20bn at the bottom line and out there and reduces its share count to around 10.5bn though buybacks. I say \"by pure luck\" because I didn't expect (1) Trump to win (2) anything in risk assets to go up much if he did and (3) that anyone would take his somewhat disjointed ideas on the economy quite this seriously. My guess is people haven't really altered their outlooks and are watching and waiting and this rapid move is just a positioning bulge as underweights get balanced. It will try to reverse at some point and I'd stay relaxed if it does. We won't really have a feel for the new administration's economic policies for months. When looking at banks in respect of the economic outlook I'm usually guided by what they say about their next quarter pipelines as to the economic environment in the immediate term and in this respect BAC were pretty buoyant on the last earnings call saying that loan demand was solid, something that's been borne out for the U.S. by early November lending data released by the Fed on Friday. What I've emphasized in my other articles on BAC is that there is a very clear reason to own it that has nothing to do with its gearing to the economic environment. This is that the bottom line should grow by >20% by 2018 as the bank achieves strongly improved operating leverage. On the face of it, BAC's cost reduction programme seems quite modest. If operating costs are on course to come in at ~$55.2bn for 2016, then it's a matter of just under 4% of these costs that will come out over the next 2 years to get us to $53bn by 2018. The \"oomph\" comes in when you think of this in the context of revenue growth of, say, 3.5% annually for two years (which is a very dull forecast). You would get 27% growth in pre-provision profit, as we find in the chart below. Click to enlarge How to think of BAC after the recent spike is in this framework. Everything in this sector has gone up, so there's nothing stock specific going on. And we don't have anything specific in terms of a macro outlook to parse individual banks' gearing to one rates scenario or another, just a general sense that we might get better growth and inflation down the line. So whether this move is \"right\" is very hard to assess. What we can say is BAC isn't stretched at all in terms of value. It's capital return capacity means it should trade at 12x current year earnings doing so I'd expect it to grind up to that kind of PE from here (about 20% absolute return before capital distribution). And of course, if we do get a constructive growth and inflation outlook, which is in nobody's numbers, then upgrades will give you further upside. Stay long and remember why you own it.

      "text": "Funds News  42pm EST Bank of America's Montag sees trading boost, cost saves from Trump win By Dan Freed | NEW YORK \nNEW YORK Nov 15 Bank of America Corp is on track to report better fourth-quarter trading revenue because of higher volumes around the U.S. presidential election, Chief Operating Officer Tom Montag said on Tuesday. \n\"Quarter-to-date has continued to be pretty good relative to last year,\" Montag said at an industry conference in New York. \"Not as robust as the third quarter was but still double-digit improvement ... year-over-year.\" \nBank of America's client trading volumes on both the New York Stock Exchange and in Japan were higher than ever due to the election, he added. \nMontag also said he hopes the election of Donald Trump will allow the bank to save money complying with post-crisis regulations such as the Volcker Rule, which is intended to prevent banks from making big directional bets on the market. \nTrump and certain influential members of Congress have indicated they will dismantle or change Dodd-Frank, the sweeping reform law passed in 2010. Montag is being \"a little more cautious\" about spending money on regulatory compliance until there is clarity on what will be done, he said. \n\"There is a chance they change something in Volcker, maybe they change it appreciably,\" Montag said.

      "text": "November 15, 2016 3:52 PM Bank of America top exec sees Trump win boosting revenue, cutting costs Bank of America Chief Operating Officer Tom Montag Jonathan Fickies Bloomberg i \nBY LAURA J. KELLER AND JENNY SURANE \nBloomberg News Order Reprint of this Story \nBank of America, the Charlotte-based lender whose stock surged 17 percent since Donald Trump was elected president, said it can increase revenue and cut costs amid optimism that the next administration will boost economic growth and curb financial regulations. \nThe firm hopes that expenses drop as regulatory burdens ease, though it’s a “little too early to know” what Trump’s policies will portend for the industry, Chief Operating Officer Tom Montag said Tuesday to kick off an investor conference sponsored by Bank of America in New York. He said there are ways to change U.S. regulations to make them better and more efficient. \nThere’s a “sense of optimism” that “the government will work better together to supply the foundation of growth that we as a bank can optimize,” said Montag, 59. “This might provide the opportunity to have that debate.” \nTrump’s transition team signaled last week that it wants to dismantle key parts of the Dodd-Frank Act, the sweeping overhaul of U.S. financial regulation aimed at preventing future crises. In addition to repealing Dodd-Frank, the president-elect’s transition website outlines policies to restrain regulation, including calls for a moratorium on new rules so existing measures can be reviewed. \n“We have a lot of regulations, so it’s probably healthy to take a breath,” said Montag, who runs the bank’s trading and investment-banking units. \nWhile some of those rules have helped U.S. banks appear strong compared with competitors in other countries, they also have resulted in billions of dollars of “inert liquidity” as derivatives trades have become more costly to execute because of margin requirements, Montag said. His wish list under a new regulatory regime would include more flexibility on rules governing bank lending, he said in response to a question from an investor. \nThe bank’s trading business improved by a double-digit percentage during the fourth quarter compared with a year earlier, Montag said. Revenue in the period has been “pretty good,” though not as robust as the third quarter. \n“The market moves around Election Day we handled well,” Montag said. “I think it was our No. 1 volume day in the New York Stock Exchange ever, and our No. 1 volume day in Japan.” \nAn area of growth the firm is focusing on is middle-market investment banking, Montag said. The company is seeking to boost its share of that fee pool by 1 percent to 2 percent, and has hired bankers in Seattle, Atlanta and Denver to help achieve that goal, he said. It’s also seeking to expand revenue from municipal bonds, a business where the bank is already a market leader, he said. \nBank of America has made its biggest overall share gains in Europe and Asia, where it has taken longer to integrate the lender’s operations with those of Merrill Lynch, which it purchased in 2009. The bank’s largest trading increases have come in rates and foreign exchange, Montag said. Related content",

      "text": "DOJ gives up in fight over massive Bank of America, Countrywide 'Hustle' fine Billion-dollar settlement is now dead November 23, 2016 KEYWORDS Bank of America Countrywide Department of Justice Financial crisis Financial crisis of 2007–2009 Hustle Hustle case \nThe fight between Bank of America and the federal government over the $1.27 billion penalty levied against Bank of America in a fraud case over defective mortgages sold by Countrywide in the run-up to the housing crisis is now officially over. \nAnd the victor is Bank of America. \nAccording to a report from the Wall Street Journal , the Department of Justice chose not to pursue the case any further and allowed the final deadline for appeal to pass, meaning that Bank of America beat the government in one of the biggest cases to come from the financial crisis. \nThe fight first began in 2013, when a federal jury held Bank of America and Countrywide liable for defrauding Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac by selling toxic mortgage loans to the government-sponsored enterprises. \nThe fine stemmed from the government suing Bank of America over Countrywide’s “High Speed Swim Lane” or “HSSL” loan origination process. The “HSSL” program became known as “Hustle,” and was characterized by the program’s speed in underwriting loans. \nIn 2014, a federal judge ruled that Bank of America should pay more than $1 billion in fines for the Hustle loan sales, less than the $2 billion the government initially sought in the case. \nLater that year, Bank of America asked U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff in Manhattan to throw out the jury verdict, a request he denied in 2015. \nBut in May of this year, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals overturned the lower court’s decision, ruling that the government did not prove that Countrywide (and Bank of America) knowingly committed fraud when they sold the defective mortgages to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. \nThe Second Circuit’s decision also voided the $1 million penalty against Rebecca Mairone, who is a former executive at Countrywide and one of the few individuals whose actions during the housing crisis landed them in legal trouble with the government. \nIn August, the government asked the Second Circuit to reconsider its decision, a request that the Second Circuit denied. \nAccording to Wall Street Journal report, Monday, November 21 was the deadline for the government to appeal the decision to the Supreme Court, and the government elected to throw in the towel. \nNow, the Hustle case and the accompanying $1.27 billion fine is dead and buried.",
