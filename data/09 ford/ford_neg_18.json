      "title": "Ford says Donald Trump influenced decision to not move production to Mexico",
      "text": "Late Thursday, President-elect Donald Trump took credit for what might have been a big achievement — preventing an auto plant from moving to Mexico — if it were true. But it turns out Trump did have some influence in Ford's decision to keep making Lincolns in America.\n\"Just got a call from my friend Bill Ford, Chairman of Ford, who advised me that he will be keeping the Lincoln plant in Kentucky - no Mexico,\" Trump tweeted. And then: \"I worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky. I owed it to the great State of Kentucky for their confidence in me!\"\nAs several news outlets then reported , neither of the two plants where Ford builds cars in Kentucky were ever at risk. The company's new contract with the United Auto Workers union preserved those jobs. While Ford was considering moving production of the low-selling Lincoln MKC to its plant in Cuautilan, Mexico, it would have ramped up production of its popular Escape in Kentucky.\nHowever, when asked whether Trump had some bearing on the decision to keep the Lincoln production in Kentucky, Ford spokeswoman Christin Baker answered: \"The answer to your question is yes.\"\n\"We have been reviewing the sourcing of this product, and Bill Ford spoke to the President-elect yesterday and shared our recent decision to keep Lincoln MKC in Kentucky,\" Baker elaborated. \"We are encouraged the economic policies he will pursue will help improve U.S. competitiveness and make it possible to keep production of this vehicle here in the U.S.\"\nDuring the campaign, Trump talked about imposing high tariffs on cars coming from overseas, and repeatedly chastised Ford — often using faulty information — for moving some production to Mexico.\nEven if U.S. jobs were not at stake in this particular location decision, the ability to produce vehicles in other countries has been very important to the Ford's business model, and that of other American car companies. If Detroit is no longer able to move different vehicle lines around to its various factories because of political pressure or new tariffs, it could curtail their profits, and even their ability to create more jobs in the United States.\nThus far, Ford has been resolute in its decision to move production of some small car lines to Mexico, and vocal in its opposition to an overhaul of the free trade agreement between Mexico, Canada, and the United States.\nHowever, the company might have wanted to start off on the right foot with the Trump administration by making a small concession.\n\"I'm sure they're trying to make nice with Trump,\" says Art Schwartz, an economist and former labor negotiator with General Motors. \"He is president now, so he does have a lot of influence. To start fighting with him right away would be a bad idea.\"\nStill, it's unlikely that Trump can force Ford to open new plants in the United States, even if he imposed the kind of import barriers that he has promised. \"Ford's not going to eat a 35 percent tariff,\" he said. \"The price of the vehicles would go up, sales would go down, and jobs would be lost in the U.S.\"\nFord's decision may also be indicative of a broader chilling in investment in Mexico, as businesses wait to see how the rules of the road will change in the Trump administration — which could take a long time to become clear.",

The investment by the automaker and its collaboration with United Auto Workers members will fund a state-of-the-art performance center and other programming. Museum officials have said the expansion will create space for interactive exhibits at the Detroit tourist attraction. It will be designed and built around the existing museum, which includes the Motown studio with its \"Hitsville U.S.A.\" facade. Designers and architects are collaborating on details of the expanded space. The museum is located in the house where record company founder Berry Gordy launched his cultural and commercial music empire. The label started in 1959 and scores of stars and hits were created before Motown moved to California in 1972. Most Popular",

      "text": "\nIn a series of tweets, President-elect Donald Trump took credit for keeping a Ford manufacturing plant in the U.S. Turns out, that is not entirely true. USA TODAY NETWORK\nThe 19th most unreliable car is the Lincoln MKC (Photo: Lincoln)\nFord Executive Chairman Bill Ford has told President-elect Donald Trump that the automaker no longer plans to move production of its Lincoln MKC luxury SUV from Louisville to Mexico.\nAfter repeatedly bashing Ford for investing in Mexico, Trump took credit in two tweets Thursday night for causing Ford to change its plans, saying he \"worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky.\"\nThe reality is that Ford had no plans to shutter the Louisville plant, where it currently makes both the Ford Escape compact sport-utility vehicle and the MKC.\nIn fact, the Dearborn automaker made a commitment in its 2015 contract with the United Auto Workers union to invest $700 million in the Louisville plant over the next four years.\nFord had said last year that it planned to move MKC production to another factory so it could increase production of the Escape in Louisville. The automaker said at the time no jobs would be lost in Louisville because of plans to boost Escape production.\nUSA TODAY\nWhat we've seen so far at the L.A. Auto Show\nFord spokeswoman Christin Baker said Ford's plant in Cuautitlan, Mexico, had been the \"likely\" location for the MKC in 2019.\nBaker did not say why the automaker changed its plans for the Lincoln SUV. She did confirm that Bill Ford spoke with President-elect Trump on Thursday.\n\"Bill shared Ford's continued commitment to invest in the U.S.,\" Ford said in a statement. \"We are encouraged that President-elect Trump and the new Congress will pursue policies that will improve U.S. competitiveness and make it possible to keep production of this vehicle here in the United States.\"\nFord employs about 4,700 people at its plant in Louisville. The vast majority of the vehicles built at the plant are Escape SUVs. It also has a separate truck plant in Louisville, where it builds pickups and larger SUVs.\nUSA TODAY\nUp close with the new vehicles that wowed us at the L.A. Auto Show\nTrump has repeatedly criticized Ford over the past 18 months for its plans to move the production of its Ford Focus and Ford C-Max hybrids to Mexico even though nearly all other automakers also have built new plants in recent years or are expanding their presence there.\nTrump also has promised to bring manufacturing jobs back to the U.S., signaled plans to withdraw from the North American Free Trade Agreement and proposed a 35% tariff on cars made in Mexico as well as other products.\n\"A tariff like that would be imposed on the entire auto sector, and that could have a huge impact on the U.S. economy,\" Ford CEO Mark Fields said Tuesday at the Los Angeles Auto Show.\nFields also said the automaker sent Trump a congratulatory letter after he won the Nov. 8 election.\nSeveral other top-ranking executives at the Los Angeles Auto Show declined to comment directly on Trump's comments about NAFTA or the tariff. Instead, most automotive executives say it's too early to comment on Trump's comments on the campaign trail because he hasn't formally proposed anything yet.\n\"Well obviously, we are in a transition at the moment. I think it’s important with all of the speculation that’s out there just to see once the transition is finished, what the environment looks like,\" Mike Manley, head the Ram and Jeep brands for Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, said Wednesday. \"Like every other automaker we are in contact with the administration, we welcome that contact, we are looking forward to that continuing and will see what happens.\"\nFord, on Friday, emphasized that it has created 28,000 new jobs and has invested $12 billion in the U.S. over the past five years.\n\"We continue to engage with President-elect Trump's team — and the new Congress — as they shape the policy agenda for 2017. We have shared our commitment to continue investing in the U.S. and creating American jobs,\" Ford said in a statement.\nFollow Detroit Free Press reporter Brent Snavely on Twitter @ BrentSnavely .\nFacebook Twitter Google+ LinkedIn Stunning cars debut at the Los Angeles Auto Show Fullscreen Post to Facebook Posted!

      "text": "Upgraded Mileage Adds to Mustang’s U.K. Street Cred \nFord Australia is a key player in the development of EcoBoost engines globally, spending $2 billion in R&D over the past six years and even more to launch and upgrade a record number of products, including the rapid rollout of Sync 3 that helps save time and fuel. \nAustralians rank fuel efficiency as their top priority when purchasing a new vehicle, with 80% of respondents in a survey citing the need to save money, 64% naming high fuel prices and 44% wanting to be more environmentally friendly. \nThe price of gasoline in Sydney this week was A$1.17.4 Australian cents a liter – the equivalent of $3.37 a gallon. By comparison, Michigan motorists were paying about $2.05 a gallon. \nThis may be the reason the survey conducted for Ford found only 16% of Australian consumers rated power output as most important when buying a new vehicle. \nThe online survey, conducted by GlobalWebIndex surveyed consumers in 11 markets: Australia (1,026 respondents), Hong Kong (784), Thailand (1,026), India (1,023), China (1,011), Malaysia (786), Philippines (783), New Zealand (774), Vietnam (774), Taiwan (762) and South Korea (760). \nThe results showing the move to fuel efficiency are music to Ford’s ears as its EcoBoost technology proliferates across its lineup. \nEcoBoost engines are engineered to deliver substantial fuel savings compared with larger-displacement engines. EcoBoost technology is applied in more than 20 Ford nameplates around the world. \n“The survey shows that consumer attitudes towards power and fuel efficiency are shifting and industry sales are supporting that notion,” Ford Australia President and CEO Graeme Whickman says in a statement. \nFuel efficiency is such a significant factor that the survey finds 29% of drivers who own a powerful car say they regret not purchasing a more fuel-stingy vehicle. \nAs a result, drivers are starting to change their behavior. More than 34% say they plan to drive less over the next 12 months, and 22% say they intend to change their driving habits to use less fuel. \nThis coincides with general uncertainty about Australian fuel prices. Some 78% of respondents say they don’t trust fuel prices to stay stable over the next year, which is 30 percentage points more than the Asia-Pacific region’s average. \nThe survey finds the behavioral and attitude shifts are reflected in choices among those planning to buy a new vehicle in the next year. \nIt finds 32% saying they plan to buy a more fuel-efficient vehicle than their current car and 23% plan to downsize to a smaller vehicle. \nWhile fuel efficiency is a priority, Australian motorists still place high value on performance. Some 53% of respondents say they consider power a major factor when buying a new car. Among city residents, 58% say they are motivated by performance, compared with 51% of suburbanites. \nWhickman says today’s consumers are more demanding than ever. \n“They expect their vehicle to deliver excellent fuel economy without sacrificing the performance they need – whether it’s making a safe overtake on the highway or negotiating a busy intersection in dense city traffic – it is important that power is available,” he says.",

      "text": "Leaders of the United Auto Workers union plan to meet with Ford Motor Co. Friday, after being taken by surprise by a tweet from President-elect Donald Trump disclosing the auto maker had shelved plans to move production of Lincoln sport-utility vehicles from the U.S. to Mexico, people familiar with the matter said.\nMr. Trump wrote in the late-night Twitter posting that he had received a call from Ford Chairman Bill Ford assuring him the U.S. auto maker would keep Lincoln production at a plant in Louisville, Ky.\nWhile the plant builds higher-volume Ford Escapes along with the Lincolns and wasn't actually slated to close, the auto maker confirmed it reversed course on its plan to move a smaller-volume Lincoln SUV production to Mexico at a later date.\nFor the UAW, retaining production of even lower-volume nameplates is a priority, partially because it provides a hedge if the market should shift away from one of the other products UAW workers assemble.\nUnion officials have long railed against the North American Free Trade Agreement, blaming it as a reason for a decline in high-paying auto assembly jobs. UAW President Dennis Williams last week said he was open to working with the incoming administration on reworking that agreement.\nFord continues to plan to separately move a substantial part of its passenger car production from Michigan to a new $1.6 billion facility in Mexico, although that move isn't currently expected to result in employment reduction for the UAW.\nWhile that issue is likely to remain a sticking point between Ford, the UAW and the president-elect, the Lincoln announcement isn't going unnoticed.\nUnion officials only learned about the Lincoln decision and the call between the chairman and president-elect through Mr. Trump's tweet and are meeting with Ford executives to learn more about what transpired between the president-elect and the company in making this decision, according to people briefed on the matter.\nTodd Dunn, president for the union local in Louisville, Ky., said the UAW wasn't aware Ford had plans to move Lincoln output to Mexico. Rather, union members were told \"months ago\" that Ford had committed to building the vehicle at the plant through the 2019 model year. After that, it would move the crossover to another, unspecified plant, to make room for building more Escapes, he said.\nNo job reductions were expected to result from the move and the plant was never in danger of closing, Mr. Dunn added. Ford built roughly 37,000 Lincoln MKC crossovers last year versus 383,000 Escapes, its second best-selling model, according to WardsAuto.com.\n\"Before last night, our plants were secure,\" he said. A Ford spokeswoman confirmed the plan now is to keep the Lincoln output in Kentucky beyond 2019.\nFord routinely meets with UAW officials to debrief them on planned production changes, often telling them well in advance of making such moves public. Mr. Trump was quick to take credit for Ford's change of heart, saying he \"worked hard\" with Bill Ford to keep Lincoln production in the U.S.\nWrite to Christina Rogers at christina.rogers@wsj.com\n 13:55 ET (18:55 ",

      "text": "Luke Sharrett | Bloomberg | Getty Images An employee works on a Ford Motor Co. Super Duty Truck engine at the Ford Kentucky Truck Plant in Louisville, Kentucky. What is the greatest power of the presidency? Is it the power to enact laws? Is it the power to order military attacks? How about the power to pardon criminals and commute prison sentences? All of those are awesome weapons in the chief executive's arsenal. But the most powerful thing the President of the United States can do is send a clear message via the bully pulpit. \nWithout having to sign a bill or use an Executive Order, a president can make things happen simply by saying it's the right thing to do. And even though he's still only President-elect, Donald Trump is using this power and getting results.\nWe learned that last night when Ford finally came out and definitively promised it would not move its Lincoln MKC plant from Louisville, Kentucky to Mexico. Trump happily made the announcement on his Twitter account: \nTweet \nTweet \nSkeptics and Trump detractors jumped all over the tweets, insisting that Ford had never made any solid plans to move the plant in the first place. But as CNBC Auto and Airline Industry Reporter Phil Lebeau explained , Trump can indeed claim a victory here by \"getting Ford to reverse plans to move the MKC out of Louisville at some point in the future.\" \nAnd that's not all, Trump's \"Made in America\" message also seems to have spurred Apple to consider some form of iPhone production in the United States. One report says the company asked its Chinese-based suppliers to start coming up with ideas on how to move some production to America. It's probably no coincidence that June was when even the ever-faulty pre-election polls showed Trump at his strongest levels of the campaign. \nThere could be more announcements and stories like this in the coming months through the first 100 days and even first year of Trump's presidency. And even if none of them individually or even collectively actually make a difference in economic growth, it's important to remember that perception is almost always greater than reality in politics. \nThese kinds of small public relations victories will be helpful for Trump who is coming into office with such high unfavorable ratings and so many Americans actively refusing to accept his election victory. But all you have to do is ask the Clinton campaign and the Democratic Party about how perceptions can change and it's best to have real accomplishments on your side in the long run. \nPresident Obama was able to point to the very slow recovery in the most positive light for most of his two terms in office. It helped him win re-election in 2012 and it seems to be keeping his approval rating above 50 percent as he begins his final two months in office. But Hillary Clinton's happy talk about the economy during the election fell flat because there just wasn't enough economic growth to justify it. Call it bad luck or just bad timing, Clinton found out there is indeed an expiration date on positive political perceptions. \nTrump isn't likely to get the kind of grace period President Obama enjoyed. The best he can probably hope for is the timetable president Reagan faced when he took office in 1981. The nation actually went into recession in 1982 and had not shown much real recovery through most of 1983. \nBy September of '83, Reagan's poll numbers were weak as the period of optimism he initiated was waning. Had the first few months of 1984 not produced the kind of stronger economic numbers that they did, it's arguable even the enormously popular Reagan would have been defeated in November instead of winning a 49-state landslide. \nTrump is going to need solid numbers, starting with some form of sustained GDP growth at or very close to the three percent level to win over more suspicious voters and keep most of his existing base. \nReal wage growth will need to be higher by 2019 or so. And if higher interest rates are coming, they'll have to find a sweet spot that keeps retirees and cash investors happy without destroying the housing market with soaring mortgage rates. Trump and his team believe reducing corporate taxes, repatriating cash held overseas, and creating large amounts of infrastructure and defense manufacturing jobs will do the trick. \nBut with a Republican Congress in tow, Trump will have few excuses in the years to come if his favored economic bills are passed and they don't produce the promised results. For now, and maybe for another year or so, little symbolic victories like the Ford announcement and the Apple story will be fine enough. But at some point, Trump will have to deliver the goods. \nCommentary by Jake Novak, CNBC.com senior columnist.

      "text": "View Comments Print By - Associated Press   \nDETROIT (AP) - Ford Motor Co. and UAW-Ford are investing $6 million in the $50 million expansion of the Motown Museum in Detroit. \nThe investment by the automaker and its collaboration with United Auto Workers members will fund a state-of-the-art performance center and other programming. \nMuseum officials have said the expansion will create space for interactive exhibits at the Detroit tourist attraction. It will be designed and built around the existing museum, which includes the Motown studio with its “Hitsville U.S.A.” facade. \nDesigners and architects are collaborating on details of the expanded space. \nThe museum is located in the house where record company founder Berry Gordy launched his cultural and commercial music empire. The label started in 1959 and scores of stars and hits were created before Motown moved to California in 1972. \nCopyright © 2016 The Washington Times, LLC.",

      "title": "Trump just took credit for stopping Ford from moving a plant to Mexico — but it wasn’t planning to",
      "text": "President-elect Donald Trump claimed credit on Thursday for keeping a Ford plant in Kentucky from moving to Mexico. But the company never planned to move the entire plant, only one of its production lines. On Thursday night, Trump tweeted: Just got a call from my friend Bill Ford, Chairman of Ford, who advised me that he will be keeping the Lincoln plant in Kentucky — no Mexico\nThen followed it up with this tweet: I worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky. I owed it to the great State of Kentucky for their confidence in me!\nFord has never announced any plans to move either its Kentucky Truck Plant in Louisville, which produces the Lincoln Navigator, or the Louisville Assembly Plant, which produces the Lincoln MKC, to Mexico.\nIn a statement on Thursday night, following Trump's tweet, the company said it had told Trump it would cancel a plan to shift production of a single model — the MKC — from Kentucky to Mexico. The company last year indicated it would be moving MKC production out of Louisville, though it did not announce where it was going. At the time, union leaders said the shift would not cost any jobs in Kentucky.\n\"Today, we confirmed with the president-elect that our small Lincoln utility vehicle made at the Louisville Assembly Plant will stay in Kentucky,\" the company said in a statement. \"We are encouraged that president-elect Trump and the new Congress will pursue policies that will improve U.S. competitiveness and make it possible to keep production of this vehicle here in the United States.\"\nIn a followup email exchange, a Ford spokesperson confirmed that the MKC production had been slated to move to Mexico.\nThis week, Ford chief executive Mark Fields reiterated that it was moving forward with plans to shift production of the Ford Focus to Mexico from Michigan.\nTrump has criticized those plans, which the company says will not cost any American jobs, because other models will be produced in the Michigan plant instead.\nIn an interview with Reuters, Fields highlighted the investments the company was making in domestic plants — most notably, in Kentucky.\nFord announced a $1.3 billion investment in the Kentucky Truck Plant late last year. It said the move would create 2,000 new jobs.\nBill Ford Jr., the company's executive chair, said in October that he had met with Trump over the then-candidate's frequent campaign attacks on Ford's decision to move small-car production to Mexico.\n\"I've had a very good meeting with him,\" Ford Jr. told the Economic Club of Washington. \"He's a very good listener and he knows the facts.\"",

      "text": "November 18, 2016 1:54 pm Donald Trump claims he saved Ford plant – but it wasn’t closing By Tom Krisher The Associated Press \nDonald Trump is taking credit for keeping a Ford plant open, but it was never slated to close. Sam VarnHagen/Ford Motor Co. via AP What is this? \nSponsored content is written by Global News' editorial staff without any editorial influence by the sponsor. If you'd like to learn more... X What is this? \nSponsored content is written by Global News' without any editorial influence by the sponsor. If you'd like to learn more... - Listen \nDETROIT – President-elect Donald Trump claimed Thursday that he convinced the chairman of Ford Motor Co. not to move an assembly plant from Kentucky to Mexico. But Ford never intended to move the plant, just production of one of the vehicles it makes. \nTrump said in a tweet that Bill Ford, the company’s executive chairman, telephoned him with the news that a “Lincoln plant” would stay in Louisville. Instead Ford decided to keep production of the Lincoln MKC small SUV at the Louisville Assembly Plant. Ford had previously said it would move production of the MKC out of the plant in order to build more Ford Escapes there. \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 18, 2016 \nA factory in Cuautitlan, Mexico, was likely to get the MKC. Under a contract negotiated last year with the United Auto Workers, Ford agreed to invest $700 million in the Louisville plant in return for moving production of the MKC. Because Escape production would increase, no Louisville jobs would be lost. \nIt’s possible the decision to keep the MKC in Kentucky was made before the election, because Escape sales have been falling since July and additional production capacity in Louisville may not be needed. \nWATCH: Trump to cancel ‘global warming payments to UN’ in effort to grow jobs \nOn Friday, Ford would say only that the MKC decision was “recent,” but spokeswoman Christin Baker wouldn’t say exactly when it was made or whether Trump directly influenced it. \nThe MKC and Escape are essentially the same vehicle and are now built by the same workers on the same assembly line. But while Ford has sold over 258,000 Escapes so far this year, it’s only sold about 21,000 MKCs. So, moving the MKC would have had little impact on the factory even if Escape production was not increased. \nREAD MORE: How Trump’s immigration crackdown could raise food prices for Canadians \nStill, Trump claimed credit for saving a factory from moving to Mexico. “I worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky. I owed it to the great State of Kentucky for their confidence in me!” Trump said in one of two tweets on the subject. His initial tweet said: “Just got a call from my friend Bill Ford, Chairman of Ford, who advised me that he will be keeping the Lincoln plant in Kentucky – no Mexico.” \nFord Motor Co. and Trump have engaged in a yearlong feud over the automaker’s plans to move production south of the border. The company plans to shift small-car production from suburban Detroit to Mexico to improve profitability of the lower-priced cars. CEO Mark Fields said Tuesday that the presidential election didn’t change the company’s plan. \nWATCH: Obama hopes Donald Trump is not quick to cut deals with Russia \nTrump wants to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement and has called for a 35 per cent tariff on goods shipped from Mexico in an effort to preserve U.S. manufacturing jobs. \nFord plans to move production of the Focus and C-Max small cars to Mexico from a plant in Wayne, Michigan. But jobs at the Wayne plant would be preserved because it’s getting a new SUV and small pickup truck. \n“We are encouraged that President-elect Trump and the new Congress will pursue policies that will improve U.S. competitiveness and make it possible to keep production of this vehicle here in the United States,” Baker said in an email. © 2016 The Canadian Press ",

      "text": "2017 Toyota Tacoma TRD Pro First Drive Going Pro: Toyota’s Top Tier Tacoma   97 Photos When Ford’s F-150–based Raptor landed in showrooms in late 2009, the pickup industry shifted forever. The factory-built performance off-road truck was an immediate hit, often selling for thousands of dollars more than sticker price and flying off of dealer lots faster than they could even get them off the delivery truck. Up until this point, every pickup manufacturer had a form of “off-road” package, which typically comprised of “upgraded” shocks, skidplates, and stickers at best. These often performed adequately, but left a lot to be desired. However, Raptor was the proverbial game-changer. It proved that the public not only wanted a true desert racing-inspired off-road truck but that they were willing to clamber over each other and spend money hand-over-fist to get one. Toyota, being no stranger to off-road racing, jumped into the factory performance off-road craze a couple years later, in 2012, with the Tacoma TRD T/X Baja edition. The T/X Baja was a limited edition, with only 1,500 being produced between the ’12 and ’14 model years. These trucks came equipped with 60mm (2.4-inch) Bilstein coilover shocks up front and 50mm (2-inch) Bilstein monotube shocks in the rear. Ride height was increased by nearly 2 inches, and wheel travel increased by 1 inch in the front and 2 1/2 inches in the rear. For ’15 the name changed to TRD Pro and production numbers increased. All of the functional bits remained the same, while a few cosmetic upgrades graced the exterior. Tundra and 4Runner also got the TRD Pro treatment for ’15, rounding out the family of off-roaders. Tacoma was fully redesigned for ’16, and due to the complexity of launching an all-new truck, we said goodbye to the TRD Pro Tacoma. Fortunately, Toyota isn’t keeping us waiting any longer and has reintroduced and all-new and significantly updated Tacoma TRD Pro edition for the ’17 model year. Photo 2/97 | 2017 Toyota Tacoma Trd Pro Familiar Underpinnings If the ’17 Tacoma TRD Pro looks and feels familiar, that’s because it is. The truck’s frame, cab, bed, and drivetrain are all your typical Tacoma fare. Under the hood is Toyota’s new 3.5L Atkinson Cycle D4S V-6, which churns out 278 hp and 265 lb-ft of torque. Mated to the engine is your choice of six-speed automatic or manual transmissions. If fuel economy matters to you the manual transmission version will net 17 mpg city and 20 mpg on the highway, while the automatic returns 18 mpg city and 23 mpg highway. Four-wheel drive is the only drive option, and the transfer case gives a 2.57:1 low range. Axle gearing is 4.300:1 for manual trucks and 3.909:1 for automatics. For those looking for a smaller truck, we’re sorry: Double Cab is the only option for TRD Pro. Photo 3/97 | 2017 Toyota Tacoma Trd Pro Engine Go–Fast Bits What really makes the Tacoma TRD Pro special is what lies beneath the body. For ’17 Toyota paired up with renowned desert racing shock manufacturer Fox, a departure from Bilstein on the previous TRD Pro Tacoma. The new dampers are 2 1/2-inch internal bypass units that are specifically tuned by TRD for the Tacoma. The shocks feature an aluminum body for impeccable cooling and corrosion resistance; hardened and oversized shafts; and protective and redundant dust boots. The front coilovers use Fox’s Internal Floating Piston (IFP) technology, while the rear utilizes a traditional piggyback reservoir. All of the shocks are position-sensitive, utilizing internal bypass valves that create five compression and three rebound zones in the front and seven compression and four rebound zones in the rear. TRD-tuned Eibach coil springs provide 1 inch of front lift, while progressive-rate leaf springs from the TRD Off-Road models support the rear. Compensating for the softer shock valving, spring rate, and ride height is a front anti-sway bar that has been increased in size from 28 mm to 30 mm. Off-Road Chops Toyota designed the ’17 TRD Pro Tacoma to do two things, off-road well and look good doing it. In addition to the Fox racing shocks, the Tacoma TRD Pro also sports Crawl Control and Multi-Terrain Select, both new on the ’16 Tacoma TRD Off-Road, and Hill Start Assist. Sorry manual transmission fans, these features are only available on the automatic-equipped trucks. Fortunately, regardless of transmission, all TRD Pros also get an electric locking rear differential and Toyota’s Automatic Limited-Slip Differential (Auto LSD) technology.   97 Photos Photo 4/97 | 2017 Toyota Tacoma Trd Pro Wheels Goodyear’s Kevlar-reinforced Wrangler All-Terrain Adventure tires in a 265/70R16 size (about 30 1/2 inches in diameter) adorn each corner, along with TRD Pro–exclusive black alloy wheels with an offset designed to increase track width by an inch over the standard TRD Off-Road. Fog lights from Rigid Industries light up the night with ultra-bright LEDs while remaining legal in all 50 states. For those hard hits, a skidplate constructed of ¼-inch aluminum protects the vital bits at the front of the truck. And thanks to its special front bumper and lack of a lower valance, the TRD Pro Tacoma touts an impressive 36-degree approach angle. Departure angle is 24 degrees, with the standard trailer hitch being the first thing to hit, and breakover is 26 degrees, making for a pickup that you can actually take off-road without tearing up the bumpers and rockers. Style Points There’s an old saying that says looks aren’t just one thing, they are everything. We would disagree, but fortunately, in addition to all of the function, the TRD Pro Tacoma has it in the form department as well. On the inside we find heated leather-trimmed seats, which are embossed with the TRD Pro logo. The steering wheel and shift knob are also trimmed in leather, and accented with red stitching. In an interesting love it or leave it move, black is the only interior color option. Outside we find a custom grille, bumper, and black-accented projector headlamps with LED daytime running lights. The TRD Pro’s hood comes by way of the TRD Sport and features a blacked out scoop along with black accent graphics. Out back are black-accented taillights and TRD’s stainless steel exhaust. Toyota is offering the ’17 TRD Pro in three colors: Cement, Barcelona Red Metallic, and Super White.",

      "title": "Ford's Change on Kentucky Plant Is an Olive Branch to Donald Trump Administration",
      "text": "By Christina Rogers and John D. Stoll\nOne of the U.S. auto industry's best-known figures has extended an olive branch to President-elect Donald Trump by informing him the car maker won't move a small amount of production to Mexico, the latest effort by a business leader to thaw tension stemming from the incoming administration's position on key issues, including global trade.\nBill Ford, the great-grandson of Henry Ford and chairman of Ford Motor Co., called Mr. Trump on Thursday to inform him the company was reversing course on a plan to eventually relocate Lincoln sport-utility production from Kentucky to a factory south of the U.S. border. The auto maker is sticking with its $1.6 billion construction of a new small-car plant in Mexico, but is signaling confidence in its ability to work with Mr. Trump on making U.S. manufacturing more attractive to multinational companies.\nMr. Trump overplayed Ford's decision in a tweet about the conversation he posted to his Twitter account Thursday night, suggesting Ford would no longer relocate a Lincoln plant from Louisville to Mexico. The Dearborn, Mich., company only wanted to move one model to Mexico in this case, and it never intended to close the Kentucky plant or cut jobs, according to company and union officials.\nOfficials working on Mr. Trump's transition team didn't return requests for comment.\nMr. Ford's outreach reflects a broader move by business leaders to mend fences with the president-elect after a brutal campaign. Following the election, Ford Chief Executive Mark Fields sent a congratulatory letter to Mr. Trump even after the New York businessman had repeatedly criticized the auto maker's plan to relocate Ford Focus production from Michigan to Mexico.\nOther companies made similar pushes. International Business Machines Corp. CEO Ginni Rometty published an open letter to Mr. Trump this week offering support for his policies, even after the president-elect criticized IBM and other companies for moving U.S. jobs overseas.\nDish Network Corp. Chief Executive Charlie Ergen has said a Trump administration would bring a \"lot of positives for business,\" including infrastructure spending and reduced corporate-tax burdens. Caterpillar Inc., a maker of construction and mining equipment, applauded Mr. Trump's pledge to boost infrastructure spending.\nSome of the outreach has come with a downside.\nSneaker maker New Balance Athletic Inc. publicly backed the president-elect's antitrade stance, welcoming Mr. Trump's election as a reprieve from the policies of President Barack Obama. New Balance's position, however, has incited a social media backlash, with hundreds of consumers posting that they'd throw out their sneakers.\nMr. Trump's complaints concerning Ford reflect broader criticism of the North American Free Trade Agreement, which some blame as the culprit for job loss in manufacturing sectors like automobiles. Mr. Trump has proposed a 35% tariff on autos and other products imported from low-cost countries such as Mexico. Mr. Fields said earlier this week that policy would be bad for his industry and the broader economy, but insisted he and the president-elect share the same objective of boosting the U.S. economy.\nIn making the Lincoln decision, Ford said it was \"encouraged that President-elect Trump and the new Congress will pursue policies that will improve U.S. competitiveness and make it possible to keep production of this vehicle here in the United States.\"\nFord's change of plans is largely symbolic and is similar to arrangements it has been making with the United Auto Workers for decades as the union lost members amid perpetual restructuring efforts by Detroit's Big Three.\nThe auto maker had planned to move the Lincoln MKC, a small sport-utility sold in low volumes that shares components with the popular Ford Escape.\nThe factory wasn't in danger of closing or shedding jobs. Rather, Ford was moving MKC production to make room for building more Escape crossovers, the company's second-best selling model.\nStill, keeping the Lincoln output in Kentucky means Ford will make future investments in tooling or other factory enhancements needed to make the MKC in the U.S. rather than reroute that capital to Mexico. And it is a win for its hourly workers, about one-third of whom are estimated to have voted for Mr. Trump, according to preliminary UAW figures.\nEven though Ford builds more than 10 Escapes in Kentucky for every Lincoln that rolls down the assembly line, keeping the MKC nameplate in an American factory is meaningful to the UAW, which has sided with Mr. Trump's Nafta position. Mr. Trump's ability to identify with concerns held by workers in states like Michigan, Pennsylvania or Ohio helped propel him to victory in early November.\nUAW officials were slated to meet with Ford executives Friday to discuss the change in plans.\nFor the union, retaining production of even the lowest-volume of cars is a priority because it provides a hedge if the market should shift away from one of the other products UAW workers assemble. This is an argument UAW officials have repeatedly made as Ford and other auto makers, including Fiat Chrysler Automobiles and General Motors Co., sink deeper investments into Mexico for the production of vehicles, including less profitable small cars.\nWrite to Christina Rogers at christina.rogers@wsj.com and John D.

      "text": "(Before It's News)\nThis article was written by Tyler Durden and originally published at Zero Hedge .\nEditor’s Comment: Though his administration is still taking shape, President-elect Trump may be able to claim his first tangible victory. Though Ford Motors were resistant to Trump’s trade policy positions and threatened to move jobs to Mexico, the CEO has now announced that, instead, production will remain American.\nIs Trump pulling televangelist-style miracles – with arrangements ahead of time in the back room – or is he making things happen because he is in a position to make good on his policy promises? Either way, Ford and other big companies will be keeping optics in mind when they decide whether or not to play ball with the wild card Trump administration (at this point, still to be). If this actually becomes the trend, perhaps there is a lot of positive that can be done for the economy, and perhaps good paying jobs can return for struggling working class Americans. Only time will tell, but he hasn’t even assumed office yet.\nFord CEO Folds? Trump Confirms Carmaker Won’t Move Production To Mexico\nby Tyler Durden\nJust hours after Ford CEO complained of the “huge impact” of Donald Trump’s proposed trade plans, following the company’s plan to move a substantial portion of its passenger-car production to Mexico from a factory in Michigan, Donald Trump tweeted “Just got a call from my friend Bill Ford, Chairman of Ford, who advised me that he will be keeping the Lincoln plant in Kentucky — no Mexico,” seemingly winning his first ‘america-first’ victory.\nAs WSJ reported yesterday, Ford Motor Co. Chief Executive Mark Fields issued a warning about President-elect Donald Trump’s proposed trade policies, saying high tariffs on automobiles and other products coming into the U.S. would be a blow to the auto industry and broader U.S. economy.\nMr. Fields, speaking with reporters on the sidelines of the Los Angeles Auto Show on Tuesday, said Ford has talked to Mr. Trump’s transition team and believes the company can work with the new administration. During a separate interview, he said, “We all share the same objective; we want a vibrant and healthy U.S. economy.”\nThe two sides, however, appear to be at odds on how to achieve that goal.\nFord’s plan to move a substantial portion of its passenger-car production to Mexico from a factory in Michigan was heavily criticized by Mr. Trump on the campaign trail. Like many of its rivals, Ford is building more-profitable light trucks in the U.S. while investing in new capacity in Mexico to produce lower-margin small cars.\nAnd then hours later, Donald Trump tweeted…\nJust got a call from my friend Bill Ford, Chairman of Ford, who advised me that he will be keeping the Lincoln plant in Kentucky – no Mexico\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 18, 2016\nI worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky. I owed it to the great State of Kentucky for their confidence in me!\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 18, 2016\nWhich was followed by a statement from Ford confirming Trump’s comment…\nThis article was written by Tyler Durden and originally published at Zero Hedge .\nThis article has been contributed by SHTF Plan.

We now have a few more details on that big project. Ford and UAW-Ford are lead donors in the project, pitching in $6 million to help create a new theater at the site. Ghosts of Motown Past? Courtesy of the Motown Museum The Ford Motor Company Theater, a state-of-the-art performance space, is part of the gift, along with educational, music and other programming as part of community outreach. Also part of this gift is something called CARaoke Experience, which we’re guessing means you can sing along to Motown songs in a Ford vehicle. Also in Motown Museum news, Friday at 5 is the unveiling of Stevie Wonder Avenue at the corner of West Milwaukee & Woodward Avenue. Isn’t that lovely?",

      "text": "President-elect Donald Trump says he kept Ford from relocating plant to Mexico President-elect Donald Trump says he kept Ford from relocating plant to Mexico Trump's declaration was met with some derision since Ford had not publicly announced plans to move the Lincoln MKC production. By: AFP | New York   1:52 am Bill Ford Jr., Ford Motor Company Executive Chairman (above); President-elect Donald Trump claimed that he convinced the chairman of Ford Motor Co not to move an assembly plant from Kentucky to Mexico. (Source: AP) \nFord confirmed on Friday that it will keep production of one SUV model in Kentucky, rather than relocating as planned, a decision US President-elect Donald Trump claimed as a personal victory. “Just hung up on the phone with my friend Bill Ford, the chairman of Ford’s board, who let me know he was going to keep the Lincoln site in Kentucky – No Mexico,” Trump wrote on Twitter yesterday night. \n  \nTrump’s declaration was met with some derision since Ford had not publicly announced plans to move the Lincoln MKC production. And just this week Ford confirmed it will proceed with plans to move production of the Focus to Mexico from Michigan, a state Trump narrowly won in last week’s election. \nBut under the last year’s contract agreement with the powerful United Automobile Workers union, Ford had made plans to move the smaller Lincoln MKC production line to make room for the Escape. Ford’s Louisville plant produces the Lincoln MKC as well as the Ford Escape, both small SUVs. \n“Cuautilan plant in Mexico was likely the plant for MKC,” Ford spokesman Christine Baker, told AFP in an email today. \nFord already produces the Lincoln MKZ sedan on the Hermosillo site, and in early April announced a USD 1.6 billion investment in a new site in Mexico. \nBut, the company said in a statement, “Today, we confirmed with the President-elect that our small Lincoln utility vehicle made at the Louisville Assembly Plant will stay in Kentucky.” \nOne of the main themes of Trump’s campaign was to bring back manufacturing jobs that American companies had moved overseas in search of cheap labor. Ford and the IT giant Apple were his favorite targets. \nTrump even threatened to impose a 35 percent punitive import duty on cars produced in Mexico, and to renegotiate the 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). \nHis rhetoric seems to have worked since several states where the car industry is strongly represented and that traditionally voted Democratic, such as Michigan and Wisconsin, voted for Trump, tipping the election. \nFord said of the decision, “We are encouraged that President-elect Trump and the new Congress will pursue policies that will improve US competitiveness and make it possible to keep production of this vehicle here in the United States.” \nBut the company defended its record, saying it employs more American auto workers and produces more American-made vehicles than any other company, and has invested $12 billion US plants in the past five years and created nearly 28,000 US jobs. \n“We continue to engage with President-elect Trump’s team — and the new Congress — as they shape the policy agenda for 2017. We have shared our commitment to continue investing in the US and creating American jobs,” Ford said. Best of Express",

      "title": "Ford's Change on Kentucky Plant Is an Olive Branch to Donald Trump Administration",
      "text": "By Christina Rogers and John D. Stoll\nOne of the U.S. auto industry's best-known figures has extended an olive branch to President-elect Donald Trump by informing him the car maker won't move a small amount of production to Mexico, the latest effort by a business leader to thaw tension stemming from the incoming administration's position on key issues, including global trade.\nBill Ford, the great-grandson of Henry Ford and chairman of Ford Motor Co., called Mr. Trump on Thursday to inform him the company was reversing course on a plan to eventually relocate Lincoln sport-utility production from Kentucky to a factory south of the U.S. border. The auto maker is sticking with its $1.6 billion construction of a new small-car plant in Mexico, but is signaling confidence in its ability to work with Mr. Trump on making U.S. manufacturing more attractive to multinational companies.\nMr. Trump overplayed Ford's decision in a tweet about the conversation he posted to his Twitter account Thursday night, suggesting Ford would no longer relocate a Lincoln plant from Louisville to Mexico. The Dearborn, Mich., company only wanted to move one model to Mexico in this case, and it never intended to close the Kentucky plant or cut jobs, according to company and union officials.\nOfficials working on Mr. Trump's transition team didn't return requests for comment.\nMr. Ford's outreach reflects a broader move by business leaders to mend fences with the president-elect after a brutal campaign. Following the election, Ford Chief Executive Mark Fields sent a congratulatory letter to Mr. Trump even after the New York businessman had repeatedly criticized the auto maker's plan to relocate Ford Focus production from Michigan to Mexico.\nOther companies made similar pushes. International Business Machines Corp. CEO Ginni Rometty published an open letter to Mr. Trump this week offering support for his policies, even after the president-elect criticized IBM and other companies for moving U.S. jobs overseas.\nDish Network Corp. Chief Executive Charlie Ergen has said a Trump administration would bring a \"lot of positives for business,\" including infrastructure spending and reduced corporate-tax burdens. Caterpillar Inc., a maker of construction and mining equipment, applauded Mr. Trump's pledge to boost infrastructure spending.\nSome of the outreach has come with a downside.\nSneaker maker New Balance Athletic Inc. publicly backed the president-elect's antitrade stance, welcoming Mr. Trump's election as a reprieve from the policies of President Barack Obama. New Balance's position, however, has incited a social media backlash, with hundreds of consumers posting that they'd throw out their sneakers.\nMr. Trump's complaints concerning Ford reflect broader criticism of the North American Free Trade Agreement, which some blame as the culprit for job loss in manufacturing sectors like automobiles. Mr. Trump has proposed a 35% tariff on autos and other products imported from low-cost countries such as Mexico. Mr. Fields said earlier this week that policy would be bad for his industry and the broader economy, but insisted he and the president-elect share the same objective of boosting the U.S. economy.\nIn making the Lincoln decision, Ford said it was \"encouraged that President-elect Trump and the new Congress will pursue policies that will improve U.S. competitiveness and make it possible to keep production of this vehicle here in the United States.\"\nFord's change of plans is largely symbolic and is similar to arrangements it has been making with the United Auto Workers for decades as the union lost members amid perpetual restructuring efforts by Detroit's Big Three.\nThe auto maker had planned to move the Lincoln MKC, a small sport-utility sold in low volumes that shares components with the popular Ford Escape.\nThe factory wasn't in danger of closing or shedding jobs. Rather, Ford was moving MKC production to make room for building more Escape crossovers, the company's second-best selling model.\nStill, keeping the Lincoln output in Kentucky means Ford will make future investments in tooling or other factory enhancements needed to make the MKC in the U.S. rather than reroute that capital to Mexico. And it is a win for its hourly workers, about one-third of whom are estimated to have voted for Mr. Trump, according to preliminary UAW figures.\nEven though Ford builds more than 10 Escapes in Kentucky for every Lincoln that rolls down the assembly line, keeping the MKC nameplate in an American factory is meaningful to the UAW, which has sided with Mr. Trump's Nafta position. Mr. Trump's ability to identify with concerns held by workers in states like Michigan, Pennsylvania or Ohio helped propel him to victory in early November.\nUAW officials were slated to meet with Ford executives Friday to discuss the change in plans.\nFor the union, retaining production of even the lowest-volume of cars is a priority because it provides a hedge if the market should shift away from one of the other products UAW workers assemble. This is an argument UAW officials have repeatedly made as Ford and other auto makers, including Fiat Chrysler Automobiles and General Motors Co., sink deeper investments into Mexico for the production of vehicles, including less profitable small cars.\nWrite to Christina Rogers at christina.rogers@wsj.com and John D.

      "title": "UAW, Ford to Meet After Trump's Tweet on Production Plans",
      "text": "Leaders of the United Auto Workers union plan to meet with Ford Motor Co. Friday, after being taken by surprise by a tweet from President-elect Donald Trump disclosing the auto maker had shelved plans to move production of Lincoln sport-utility vehicles from the U.S. to Mexico, people familiar with the matter said.\nMr. Trump wrote in the late-night Twitter posting that he had received a call from Ford Chairman Bill Ford assuring him the U.S. auto maker would keep Lincoln production at a plant in Louisville, Ky.\nWhile the plant builds higher-volume Ford Escapes along with the Lincolns and wasn't actually slated to close, the auto maker confirmed it reversed course on its plan to move a smaller-volume Lincoln SUV production to Mexico at a later date.\nFor the UAW, retaining production of even lower-volume nameplates is a priority, partially because it provides a hedge if the market should shift away from one of the other products UAW workers assemble.\nUnion officials have long railed against the North American Free Trade Agreement, blaming it as a reason for a decline in high-paying auto assembly jobs. UAW President Dennis Williams last week said he was open to working with the incoming administration on reworking that agreement.\nFord continues to plan to separately move a substantial part of its passenger car production from Michigan to a new $1.6 billion facility in Mexico, although that move isn't currently expected to result in employment reduction for the UAW.\nWhile that issue is likely to remain a sticking point between Ford, the UAW and the president-elect, the Lincoln announcement isn't going unnoticed.\nUnion officials only learned about the Lincoln decision and the call between the chairman and president-elect through Mr. Trump's tweet and are meeting with Ford executives to learn more about what transpired between the president-elect and the company in making this decision, according to people briefed on the matter.\nTodd Dunn, president for the union local in Louisville, Ky., said the UAW wasn't aware Ford had plans to move Lincoln output to Mexico. Rather, union members were told \"months ago\" that Ford had committed to building the vehicle at the plant through the 2019 model year. After that, it would move the crossover to another, unspecified plant, to make room for building more Escapes, he said.\nNo job reductions were expected to result from the move and the plant was never in danger of closing, Mr. Dunn added. Ford built roughly 37,000 Lincoln MKC crossovers last year versus 383,000 Escapes, its second best-selling model, according to WardsAuto.com.\n\"Before last night, our plants were secure,\" he said. A Ford spokeswoman confirmed the plan now is to keep the Lincoln output in Kentucky beyond 2019.\nFord routinely meets with UAW officials to debrief them on planned production changes, often telling them well in advance of making such moves public. Mr. Trump was quick to take credit for Ford's change of heart, saying he \"worked hard\" with Bill Ford to keep Lincoln production in the U.S.\nWrite to Christina Rogers at christina.rogers@wsj.com\n 18, 2016 13:55 ET (18:55 ",

      "text": "’97-’03 Ford F-150 Heater Core Replacement Feeling The Heat View Photo Gallery | 27 Photos Anyone who has tackled heater core replacement will tell you they’d rather have an all-night root canal than have to perform this dreaded task. Heater core leakage begins with the subtle aroma of antifreeze and evolves into a small wet spot on the driveway. By the time you have coolant on the pavement there is no way around it. You’re going to have to replace the heater core or load up on Stop Leak. Back in the day, on older Ford F-Series trucks, heater core placement involved going up under the dashboard and removing the heating and air-conditioning unit. In the ’70s, Ford began installing HVAC systems before dashboards were bolted into the vehicle. Dashboards, which were preassembled on rotisseries, were installed in the vehicle via an installation fixture and a couple of assembly workers. This approach made vehicle assembly easier and quicker. However, it also meant extensive labor for the technician faced with heater core and/or air-conditioning evaporator replacement. We’re working with a ’98 Ford F-150 with nearly 267,000 miles on the odometer after 18 years of service. That’s pretty good, considering most F-Series trucks have experienced chronic heater core failure earlier in their service lives. Heater cores have always been a weak spot in Ford vehicles for various reasons, including excessive cooling system pressure and volume, which has been improved in production via the use of heater hose restrictors between the engine and heater core. Heater core replacement in the F-Series, Expedition, and Lincoln Navigator involves removal of the dashboard to where it can be disconnected and swung away from the HVAC unit bolted to the firewall. Some technicians have managed to unbolt the dashboard and swing it out far enough to gain access to the HVAC unit. Others disconnect the steering column and remove the entire dashboard for easier access. It is suggested you use genuine Motorcraft parts where possible, which are available from Rock Auto, in your heater core replacement, including cooling system hoses, which have the factory-style quick connections at the firewall. Motorcraft heater hoses also have the flow-restrictor in the “in” hose designed to prevent heater core failure from pressure and excessive flow. Not all aftermarket replacement heater hoses have this restrictor. Heater hose quick-connects are anything but “quick” disconnect. You’re going to need the quick-disconnect tool available at any auto parts store or Summit Racing Equipment. If you’re replacing the heater hoses, you can cut the quick-connect tabs and pull the connectors. Although we’re working with a ’97-to-’03-generation F-Series truck, basic principles of replacement are the same from for ’97-to-’17 models. Let’s get started.",

      "title": "UAW, Ford to Meet After Trump's Tweets on Production Plans",
      "text": "By Christina Rogers\nLeaders of the United Auto Workers union plan to meet with Ford Motor Co. Friday, after being taken by surprised by a tweet from President-elect Donald Trump disclosing the auto maker had shelved plans to move production of Lincoln sport-utility vehicles from the U.S. to Mexico, people familiar with the matter said.\nMr. Trump wrote in the late-night Twitter posting that he had received a call from Ford Chairman Bill Ford assuring him the U.S. auto maker would keep Lincoln production at a plant in Louisville, Ky.\nWhile the plant builds higher-volume Ford Escapes along with the Lincolns and wasn't actually slated to close, the auto maker confirmed it reversed course on its plan to move a smaller-volume Lincoln SUV production to Mexico at a later date.\nFor the UAW, retaining production of even lower-volume nameplates is a priority, partially because it provides a hedge if the market should shift away from one of the other products UAW workers assemble.\nUnion officials have long railed against the North American Free Trade Agreement, blaming it as a reason for a decline in high-paying auto assembly jobs. UAW President Dennis Williams last week said he was open to working with the incoming administration on reworking that agreement.\nFord continues to plan to separately move a substantial part of its passenger car production from Michigan to a new $1.6 billion facility in Mexico, although that move isn't currently expected to result in employment reduction for the UAW.\nWhile that issue is likely to remain a sticking point between Ford, the UAW and the president-elect, the Lincoln announcement isn't going unnoticed.\nUnion officials only learned about the Lincoln decision and the call between the chairman and president-elect through Mr. Trump's tweet and are meeting with Ford executives to learn more about what transpired between the president-elect and the company in making this decision, according to people briefed on the matter.\nTodd Dunn, president for the union local in Louisville, Ky., said the UAW wasn't aware Ford had plans to move Lincoln output to Mexico. Rather, union members were told \"months ago\" that Ford had committed to building the vehicle at the plant through the 2019 model year. After that, it would move the crossover to another, unspecified plant, to make room for building more Escapes, he said.\nNo job reductions were expected to result from the move and the plant was never in danger of closing, Mr. Dunn added. Ford built roughly 37,000 Lincoln MKC crossovers last year versus 383,000 Escapes, its second best-selling model, according to WardsAuto.com.\n\"Before last night, our plants were secure,\" he said. A Ford spokeswoman confirmed the plan now is to keep the Lincoln output in Kentucky beyond 2019.\nFord routinely meets with UAW officials to debrief them on planned production changes, often telling them well in advance of making such moves public. Mr. Trump was quick to take credit for Ford's change of heart, saying he \"worked hard\" with Bill Ford to keep Lincoln production in the U.S.\nWrite to Christina Rogers at christina.rogers@wsj.com\n 18, 2016 13:05 ET (18:05 ",

      "text": "Time: 2 p.m. ET (Sunday) \nTrack: Homestead-Miami Speedway (Homestead, Fla.) \nTV: NBC \nRadio: MRN, SIRIUS XM Channel 90 \nWho’s at the Front: Toyota \nAs we head to Homestead-Miami, barring a catastrophe, Toyota is poised to knock off Chevrolet and claim their first-ever manufacturer’s championship on the Cup Series level. (Kyle Busch won Toyota’s first driver’s title in 2015). The changing of the guard will end a 13-year run for Chevrolet, who has dominated the sport and the majority of starting fields during most of the Chase era. But the Toyotas of Joe Gibbs Racing proved too tough for the competition this year, with their chassis posting the most wins (16) of any organization on the circuit. Chevy is poised to finish second in manufacturer points with Ford a distant third; in fact, Ford has just one of the 12 drivers vying for a title this weekend in NASCAR’s top three series (Logano). \nWho’s at the Back: Chris Buescher \nIt was a minor miracle to see this rookie make the Chase following his rain-induced victory at Pocono. Sadly, that mojo never transferred into the postseason itself. With one race remaining, Buescher has yet to score a top-15 finish during the playoff with a best result of just 16th at Charlotte. He’s rumored for a promotion during the offseason, either to Roush Fenway Racing or Richard Petty Motorsports but that’s going to need to come with a step up in performance. \nNews Briefs \n\nTommy Baldwin Racing has officially sold its charter to the No. 95 of Leavine Family Racing next season. In an emotional Facebook post, Baldwin announced he’s changing direction after eight years running one of the sport’s underdog programs. \n\n“I have been blessed to have a career in motorsports because of how NASCAR has grown over the years,” he said. “Teams don't always agree with their stance on rule changes or penalties or just the way things are done. But I can tell you that they have gone out of their way to help our team. They've brought us opportunities and have always made themselves available to meet with prospective sponsors if we needed them to. It's been a privilege for me to say that I'm a NASCAR team owner.” \n\nThere’s no word on what might happen to Regan Smith in 2017 or the No. 7 team itself. Baldwin did have sponsorship set for a number of races next year and it’s unknown what happens with those agreements. \n\nSprint and Tony Stewart will both wrap up their tenure with NASCAR in different capacities this weekend. Sprint will end their 13-year tenure as title sponsor, coinciding with the advent of the Chase era in 2004. Over that time, through Sprint Vision, the 10-race playoff and other fan initiatives, they’ve left their mark following the iconic backing of Winston that launched NASCAR into the national sporting conversation. \n\nAs for Stewart, he wraps up a career as a driver that’s spanned three decades and (after Sunday) 618 Sprint Cup starts. Forty-nine victories, three championships, and 15 poles make him an almost-certain first-ballot Hall of Famer. His diversity, represented in wins at every NASCAR track on the circuit except Kentucky and Darlington, goes well beyond stock car racing. A former IRL series champion, Stewart has been successful in virtually any type of car he straps into and will spend much of the next few years moonlighting at dirt tracks all over the country. Still co-owner of Stewart-Haas Racing , he’ll be visible on some race weekends but be allowed to disconnect from a driving culture he claims has gotten “frustrating” in recent years as engineers have taken on a bigger role in the sport. \n\n\n26 \nTop-10 finishes by Kevin Harvick this season, more than any other driver. Harvick has a total of 54 top-10 finishes in his last 71 Cup Series starts, an impressive 76 percent clip. \n\n1,809 \nLaps led this season by Martin Truex Jr., a number that leads the Cup Series. Over the past 12 years of Cup competition entering this season Truex had led a little more than 2,400 laps. \nPlaying the Odds (Fantasy Spin) \nTop Tier \n\nJimmie Johnson . Joey Logano . Carl Edwards . Kyle Busch . They are all fighting for a title and they’ll fight for you on your roster. Pick whomever you think has the edge as the winner of the Cup has won this race in the last two years under the current format. Personally, I think Johnson has the edge for seven even though he hasn’t won at Homestead throughout his career. Stats get thrown out the window here in the pressure of this winner-take-all title format. And no Championship 4 driver has run lower than 16th, so no matter whom you select you should be pretty safe. \nMiddle Tier \n\nKasey Kahne continues to have a fantastic Chase as he positions himself to be the “Best of the Rest” driver, running 17th in the final standings. Eight top-15 finishes in nine Chase races would have made Kahne a formidable foe to even reach the Championship 4; it’s a shocking turnaround for a guy whose earlier this season had to quell rumors he’d be released from his Hendrick Motorsports contract early. Add in the fact that in his last eight Homestead races, there’s been no finish lower than 21st and 1.5-mile ovals are Kahne’s bread and butter. He should be your pick here. \n\nKyle Larson has had an awful Chase but Homestead offers an opportunity to finish strong. Three starts here have produced three top-15 finishes including a strong fifth last season. His XFINITY Series record here is even stronger, earning three top-5 finishes and a win in three starts. Needless to say, he’s a safe bet. \nLower Tier \n\nIt’s slim pickings at the back of the field, as this track doesn’t favor backmarker teams. Danica Patrick leads a weak group with finishes of 20th, 18th, and 24th in her career at this track. That’s not great but will protect your lead in fantasy if you’re entering the weekend playing prevent defense. \nWhat Vegas Thinks \nJimmie Johnson holds the edge in Vegas, but just barely. He’s got 21/20 odds over Kyle Larson at 23/20. Joey Logano sits third at 27/20 according to vegasinsider.com. \nWhat I Think \nJimmie Johnson took three years to get here under this format and the No. 48 team won’t waste the opportunity. Johnson has been running the best of the four drivers here and he’ll take home the championship trophy and start a conversation as to when he’ll break Dale Earnhardt and Richard Petty’s record of seven Cup Series titles. \n\n— Written by Tom Bowles, who is part of the Athlon Contributor Network and the Majority Owner of NASCAR Web site Frontstretch.com .

      "text": "By Christina Rogers\nLeaders of the United Auto Workers union plan to meet with Ford Motor Co. Friday, after being taken by surprised by a tweet from President-elect Donald Trump disclosing the auto maker had shelved plans to move production of Lincoln sport-utility vehicles from the U.S. to Mexico, people familiar with the matter said.\nMr. Trump wrote in the late-night Twitter posting that he had received a call from Ford Chairman Bill Ford assuring him the U.S. auto maker would keep Lincoln production at a plant in Louisville, Ky.\nWhile the plant builds higher-volume Ford Escapes along with the Lincolns and wasn't actually slated to close, the auto maker confirmed it reversed course on its plan to move a smaller-volume Lincoln SUV production to Mexico at a later date.\nFor the UAW, retaining production of even lower-volume nameplates is a priority, partially because it provides a hedge if the market should shift away from one of the other products UAW workers assemble.\nUnion officials have long railed against the North American Free Trade Agreement, blaming it as a reason for a decline in high-paying auto assembly jobs. UAW President Dennis Williams last week said he was open to working with the incoming administration on reworking that agreement.\nFord continues to plan to separately move a substantial part of its passenger car production from Michigan to a new $1.6 billion facility in Mexico, although that move isn't currently expected to result in employment reduction for the UAW.\nWhile that issue is likely to remain a sticking point between Ford, the UAW and the president-elect, the Lincoln announcement isn't going unnoticed.\nUnion officials only learned about the Lincoln decision and the call between the chairman and president-elect through Mr. Trump's tweet and are meeting with Ford executives to learn more about what transpired between the president-elect and the company in making this decision, according to people briefed on the matter.\nTodd Dunn, president for the union local in Louisville, Ky., said the UAW wasn't aware Ford had plans to move Lincoln output to Mexico. Rather, union members were told \"months ago\" that Ford had committed to building the vehicle at the plant through the 2019 model year. After that, it would move the crossover to another, unspecified plant, to make room for building more Escapes, he said.\nNo job reductions were expected to result from the move and the plant was never in danger of closing, Mr. Dunn added. Ford built roughly 37,000 Lincoln MKC crossovers last year versus 383,000 Escapes, its second best-selling model, according to WardsAuto.com.\n\"Before last night, our plants were secure,\" he said. A Ford spokeswoman confirmed the plan now is to keep the Lincoln output in Kentucky beyond 2019.\nFord routinely meets with UAW officials to debrief them on planned production changes, often telling them well in advance of making such moves public. Mr. Trump was quick to take credit for Ford's change of heart, saying he \"worked hard\" with Bill Ford to keep Lincoln production in the U.S.\nWrite to Christina Rogers at christina.rogers@wsj.com\n 13:05 ET (18:05 GMT)\n ",

After that, it would move the crossover to another, unspecified plant, to make room for building more Escapes, he said.\nNo job reductions were expected to result from the move and the plant was never in danger of closing, Mr. Dunn added. Ford built roughly 37,000 Lincoln MKC crossovers last year versus 383,000 Escapes, its second best-selling model, according to WardsAuto.com.\n\"Before last night, our plants were secure,\" he said. A Ford spokeswoman confirmed the plan now is to keep the Lincoln output in Kentucky beyond 2019.\nFord routinely meets with UAW officials to debrief them on planned production changes, often telling them well in advance of making such moves public. Mr. Trump was quick to take credit for Ford's change of heart, saying he \"worked hard\" with Bill Ford to keep Lincoln production in the U.S.\nWrite to Christina Rogers at christina.rogers@wsj.com\n 13:55 ET (18:55 GMT)\n ",

      "title": "Ford's Change on Kentucky Plant Is an Olive Branch to Donald Trump Administration",
      "text": "By Christina Rogers and John D. Stoll\nOne of the U.S. auto industry's best-known figures has extended an olive branch to President-elect Donald Trump by informing him the car maker won't move a small amount of production to Mexico, the latest effort by a business leader to thaw tension stemming from the incoming administration's position on key issues, including global trade.\nBill Ford, the great-grandson of Henry Ford and chairman of Ford Motor Co., called Mr. Trump on Thursday to inform him the company was reversing course on a plan to eventually relocate Lincoln sport-utility production from Kentucky to a factory south of the U.S. border. The auto maker is sticking with its $1.6 billion construction of a new small-car plant in Mexico, but is signaling confidence in its ability to work with Mr. Trump on making U.S. manufacturing more attractive to multinational companies.\nMr. Trump overplayed Ford's decision in a tweet about the conversation he posted to his Twitter account Thursday night, suggesting Ford would no longer relocate a Lincoln plant from Louisville to Mexico. The Dearborn, Mich., company only wanted to move one model to Mexico in this case, and it never intended to close the Kentucky plant or cut jobs, according to company and union officials.\nOfficials working on Mr. Trump's transition team didn't return requests for comment.\nMr. Ford's outreach reflects a broader move by business leaders to mend fences with the president-elect after a brutal campaign. Following the election, Ford Chief Executive Mark Fields sent a congratulatory letter to Mr. Trump even after the New York businessman had repeatedly criticized the auto maker's plan to relocate Ford Focus production from Michigan to Mexico.\nOther companies made similar pushes. International Business Machines Corp. CEO Ginni Rometty published an open letter to Mr. Trump this week offering support for his policies, even after the president-elect criticized IBM and other companies for moving U.S. jobs overseas.\nDish Network Corp. Chief Executive Charlie Ergen has said a Trump administration would bring a \"lot of positives for business,\" including infrastructure spending and reduced corporate-tax burdens. Caterpillar Inc., a maker of construction and mining equipment, applauded Mr. Trump's pledge to boost infrastructure spending.\nSome of the outreach has come with a downside.\nSneaker maker New Balance Athletic Inc. publicly backed the president-elect's antitrade stance, welcoming Mr. Trump's election as a reprieve from the policies of President Barack Obama. New Balance's position, however, has incited a social media backlash, with hundreds of consumers posting that they'd throw out their sneakers.\nMr. Trump's complaints concerning Ford reflect broader criticism of the North American Free Trade Agreement, which some blame as the culprit for job loss in manufacturing sectors like automobiles. Mr. Trump has proposed a 35% tariff on autos and other products imported from low-cost countries such as Mexico. Mr. Fields said earlier this week that policy would be bad for his industry and the broader economy, but insisted he and the president-elect share the same objective of boosting the U.S. economy.\nIn making the Lincoln decision, Ford said it was \"encouraged that President-elect Trump and the new Congress will pursue policies that will improve U.S. competitiveness and make it possible to keep production of this vehicle here in the United States.\"\nFord's change of plans is largely symbolic and is similar to arrangements it has been making with the United Auto Workers for decades as the union lost members amid perpetual restructuring efforts by Detroit's Big Three.\nThe auto maker had planned to move the Lincoln MKC, a small sport-utility sold in low volumes that shares components with the popular Ford Escape.\nThe factory wasn't in danger of closing or shedding jobs. Rather, Ford was moving MKC production to make room for building more Escape crossovers, the company's second-best selling model.\nStill, keeping the Lincoln output in Kentucky means Ford will make future investments in tooling or other factory enhancements needed to make the MKC in the U.S. rather than reroute that capital to Mexico. And it is a win for its hourly workers, about one-third of whom are estimated to have voted for Mr. Trump, according to preliminary UAW figures.\nEven though Ford builds more than 10 Escapes in Kentucky for every Lincoln that rolls down the assembly line, keeping the MKC nameplate in an American factory is meaningful to the UAW, which has sided with Mr. Trump's Nafta position. Mr. Trump's ability to identify with concerns held by workers in states like Michigan, Pennsylvania or Ohio helped propel him to victory in early November.\nUAW officials were slated to meet with Ford executives Friday to discuss the change in plans.\nFor the union, retaining production of even the lowest-volume of cars is a priority because it provides a hedge if the market should shift away from one of the other products UAW workers assemble. This is an argument UAW officials have repeatedly made as Ford and other auto makers, including Fiat Chrysler Automobiles and General Motors Co., sink deeper investments into Mexico for the production of vehicles, including less profitable small cars.\nWrite to Christina Rogers at christina.rogers@wsj.com and John D.

      "title": "Blindsided by Trump Tweet, UAW Meets With Ford on Lincoln SUV",
      "text": "Bloomberg Nov 18, 2016 \n“What is important is the transparency between Ford Motor Co. and the UAW,\" said Todd Dunn, president of the UAW local in Louisville, Ky. \"We’re doing a good job and that wasn’t decided in an overnight tweet.” Getty Images \nUnited Auto Workers leaders huddled with Ford Motor Co. executives today after the union was caught off guard by President-elect Donald Trump’s tweet last night he helped prevent another Ford model from going to Mexico. \nWhile the union is pleased Ford has now committed to continue building the Lincoln MKC small sport utility vehicle at a Kentucky factory, Trump’s tweets had suggested that the entire Louisville Assembly Plant’s output was under threat of moving to Mexico. The MKC is built on the same assembly line as the Ford Escape, which outsells the Lincoln version by 12-to-1. More than 5,000 employees are working nearly around the clock on three crews to meet demand for the two SUVs, said Todd Dunn, president of UAW Local 862 in Louisville. \nSo were Trump’s tweets that there would be “no Mexico” because he “worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky” misleading? \n“I’ll let each individual reach their own conclusions, but the true answer should be clear to anyone,” Dunn said in an interview. “What is important is the transparency between Ford Motor Co. and the UAW. We’re doing a good job and that wasn’t decided in an overnight tweet.” \nFord didn’t inform the union of its long-term plans for the MKC before those tweets went out Thursday night, Dunn said. That’s what UAW Vice President Jimmy Settles, who oversees Ford contract negotiations, and other union leaders were planning to discuss with the company today, he said. Ford didn’t respond to a request for comment on the talks. Talks With Trump \nAfter Trump’s tweets, the company acknowledged for the first time it had been considering moving production of the MKC to Mexico, allowing the plant to boost output of the Escape, one of its hottest models. After talks between Executive Chairman Bill Ford and the president-elect, the automaker decided to keep building the MKC in Louisville after the UAW’s current contract expires in 2019. \n“We had planned to move the Lincoln MKC out of Louisville Assembly Plant,” Christin Baker, a Ford spokeswoman, said in an e-mail, noting the UAW contract signed last year allowed for such a move. \"Cuautitlan plant in Mexico was likely the plant for MKC.\" \nDuring his campaign, Trump was relentless in his criticism of Ford for planning to move all its North American small-car production to Mexico, where wages are 80 percent lower than in the U.S. Ford also builds the Lincoln MKZ sedan at a factory in Hermosillo, Mexico. During the campaign, Trump threatened to slap Ford’s Mexican-built cars with a 35 percent tariff. He also said he would terminate the North American Free Trade Agreement, which lets goods flow between Mexico, the U.S. and Canada without tariffs. Popular Now",

Trump tweeted that he worked with Ford chairman Bill Ford to keep the plant in the Bluegrass state, not Mexico. But Ford has repeatedly said it has no plans to close any U.S. plants. The Louisville Assembly Plant in Kentucky builds the Ford Escape and the Lincoln MKC SUV and employees 47-hundred people. Last month, the No. 2 automaker in the U.S. said it would suspend production of the Escape and MKC at the Louisville plant for two weeks because of low demand.",

It will be designed and built around the existing museum, which includes the Motown studio with its \"Hitsville U.S.A.\" facade. \nDesigners and architects are collaborating on details of the expanded space. \nThe museum is located in the house where record company founder Berry Gordy launched his cultural and commercial music empire. The label started in 1959 and scores of stars and hits were created before Motown moved to California in 1972. Related content",

      "text": "Ford factory decision, cited as victory by Trump, has no effect on U.S. jobs Originally published November 18, 2016 at 4:05 pm Ford Motor extended a political olive branch to President-elect Donald Trump by deciding to keep production of its Lincoln MKC in Kentucky. But the move was largely symbolic, since the plant was slated to keep working at maximum capacity even if the Lincoln work moved to Mexico. Share story Neal E. Boudette The New York Times \nAlthough President-elect Donald Trump claimed a hard-won victory Thursday night to persuade Ford Motor to keep making a small Lincoln SUV in a Louisville, Kentucky, plant rather than move its production to Mexico, Ford’s decision to maintain production in Kentucky will have no impact on jobs at the factory. The plant is already operating virtually around the clock at full capacity. \nThe decision, which Ford Motor said it made before Trump spoke by phone Thursday with William Clay Ford Jr., the company’s executive chairman, will simply keep the current product mix in place at the factory. \nThe Louisville plant will continue making a far larger number of Ford Escapes, a small SUV that is essentially the same, if less luxurious, vehicle as the Lincoln MKC, which Ford said it would continue to make in Louisville. \nFord, which during the election campaign was a frequent target of Trump’s criticism for moving jobs to Mexico, was no doubt waving a political olive branch by deciding to keep Lincoln MKC production in Kentucky. But the move was largely symbolic. Most Read Stories Unlimited Digital Access. $1 for 4 weeks. \nAnd that Trump seemingly overstated its impact — if it proves emblematic of his future dealings with the industry — could indicate that his rhetoric about saving and restoring auto jobs may not necessarily require significant changes on the part of carmakers. \nTrump’s vows to protect manufacturing jobs in the U.S. helped him win the support of working-class voters, including many factory workers in Michigan, Ohio and Kentucky. He sought to underscore the message Thursday night. \n“Just got a call from my friend Bill Ford, Chairman of Ford, who advised me that he will be keeping the Lincoln plant in Kentucky — no Mexico,” Trump wrote in a Twitter message. \nIn a subsequent post, he wrote: “I worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky. I owed it to the great State of Kentucky for their confidence in me!” \nBoth posts overstated certain issues. \nFord never planned to move the Louisville plant to Mexico. It only intended to shift the production of the MKC, which represents less than 10 percent of the plant’s total output. The Ford Escape, a much bigger seller than the MKC, is enough to keep the Louisville plant running at full capacity. \nMoreover, the decision to keep the MKC in Louisville was made before the two men spoke Thursday, not as a result of their conversation, according to Ford. \n“We have been reviewing the sourcing of this product, and Bill Ford spoke to the president-elect yesterday and shared our recent decision to keep Lincoln MKC in Kentucky,” a Ford spokeswoman, Christin Baker, said in a statement Friday. “We are encouraged the economic policies he will pursue will help improve U.S. competitiveness and make it possible to keep production of this vehicle here in the U.S.” \nDuring the campaign, Trump heavily criticized Ford for deciding to shuffle its manufacturing operations so that all its small cars are made in Mexico. At times, he even suggested hitting the company and others with a 35 percent tariff on vehicles imported from Mexico. \nFord has countered that moving small-car assembly to Mexican plants would have no impact on U.S. jobs. \nThe Louisville plant’s work force would remain unchanged even if the MKC were moved to a new factory. The factory employs 4,500 hourly workers and is operating on three shifts, producing vehicles, mostly Ford Escapes, almost around the clock. Neal E.

      "text": "DETROIT (AP) -- President-elect Donald Trump claimed Thursday that he convinced the chairman of Ford Motor Co. not to move an assembly plant from Kentucky to Mexico. But Ford never intended to move the plant, just production of one of the vehicles it makes.\nTrump said in a tweet that Bill Ford, the company&apos;s executive chairman, telephoned him with the news that a \"Lincoln plant\" would stay in Louisville. Instead Ford decided to keep production of the Lincoln MKC small SUV at the Louisville Assembly Plant. Ford had previously said it would move production of the MKC out of the plant in order to build more Ford Escapes there.\nA factory in Cuautitlan, Mexico, was likely to get the MKC. Under a contract negotiated last year with the United Auto Workers, Ford agreed to invest $700 million in the Louisville plant in return for moving production of the MKC. Because Escape production would increase, no Louisville jobs would be lost.\nIt&apos;s possible the decision to keep the MKC in Kentucky was made before the election, because Escape sales have been falling since July and additional production capacity in Louisville may not be needed.\nOn Friday, Ford would say only that the MKC decision was \"recent,\" but spokeswoman Christin Baker wouldn&apos;t say exactly when it was made or whether Trump directly influenced it.\nThe MKC and Escape are essentially the same vehicle and are now built by the same workers on the same assembly line. But while Ford has sold over 258,000 Escapes so far this year, it&apos;s only sold about 21,000 MKCs. So, moving the MKC would have had little impact on the factory even if Escape production was not increased.\nStill, Trump claimed credit for saving a factory from moving to Mexico. \"I worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky. I owed it to the great State of Kentucky for their confidence in me!\" Trump said in one of two tweets on the subject. His initial tweet said: \"Just got a call from my friend Bill Ford, Chairman of Ford, who advised me that he will be keeping the Lincoln plant in Kentucky - no Mexico.\"\nFord Motor Co. and Trump have engaged in a yearlong feud over the automaker&apos;s plans to move production south of the border. The company plans to shift small-car production from suburban Detroit to Mexico to improve profitability of the lower-priced cars. CEO Mark Fields said Tuesday that the presidential election didn&apos;t change the company&apos;s plan.\nTrump wants to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement and has called for a 35 percent tariff on goods shipped from Mexico in an effort to preserve U.S. manufacturing jobs.\nFord plans to move production of the Focus and C-Max small cars to Mexico from a plant in Wayne, Michigan. But jobs at the Wayne plant would be preserved because it&apos;s getting a new SUV and small pickup truck.\n\"We are encouraged that President-elect Trump and the new Congress will pursue policies that will improve U.S. competitiveness and make it possible to keep production of this vehicle here in the United States,\" Baker said in an email.\n ",

      "text": "2017 Ford F-150 Buyer's Guide 2017 Ford F-150 Buyer's Guide By Jason Allan   11:07 AM When word started to spread that Ford was building its next F-150 out of aluminum, the truck world got nervous. Trucks and steel go together like baseball and hot dogs, while aluminum makes great beer cans. Now that the dust has settled, Ford's legitmately bold move is looking more and more like a winning play. The move to aluminum did indeed save weight (up to 700 pounds in some cases) and increase efficiency, but the Ford F-150 also offers the highest towing and payload capacities in the segment, and top safety ratings. It was for all these reasons and more that we've picked the F-150 as KBB's Pickup Truck Best Buy two years in a row. \nThe most capable truck in the class, the best-selling vehicle   three-time Best Buy award winner. \nWhen word started to spread that Ford was building its next F-150 out of aluminum, the truck world got nervous. Trucks and steel go together like baseball and hot dogs, while aluminum makes great beer cans. Now that the dust has settled, Ford's legitmately bold move is looking more and more like a winning play. The move to aluminum did indeed save weight (up to 700 pounds in some cases) and increase efficiency, but the Ford F-150 also offers stellar towing and payload capacities, and top safety ratings. For 2017, Ford did not rest on its laurels, redesigning the F-150's 3.5-liter EcoBoost V6 engine to put out more power, and backing it with a new 10-speed automatic transmission. It's for all these reasons and more that we've picked the F-150 as KBB's Pickup Truck Best Buy three years in a row. \n  : \"While many skeptics doubted a small-displacement V6 could ever replace the pulling power and longevity of big V8, Ford’s 2017 F-150 pickup has proved them all wrong. The F-150’s lightweight aluminum body shaves nearly 500 pounds off a conventional steel-body truck, allowing the 2.7-liter EcoBoost V6 to easily move even a fully loaded truck. Those needing to tow more than 12,000 pounds, however, would be well advised to move up to the larger 3.5-liter EcoBoost engine with its class-leading 470 lb-ft of torque.\" \nTwo Turbos to Choose From \nThe F-150 is available with a traditional V8 and traditional V6, but there are two twin-turbo V6 engines to choose from as well. The F-150's maximum tow rating of 12,200 pounds is achieved not with the big V8, but with the redesigned 3.5-liter EcoBoost V6 under the hood. The new EcoBoost puts out more power for 2017, now 375 horsepower and a best-in-class 470 lb-ft of torque. There's also the excellent 2.7-liter V6, which is plenty of engine for just about everyone -- and is rated to tow up to 8,500 pounds. \nWork Innovations \nThe F-150 is the only truck on the market that offers an integrated tailgate step. This includes a bar that makes it easy to get into and out of the bed. You can also get tough cargo ramps for loading motorcycles or work equipment into the truck. And you can lock, unlock or lower the tailgate with the key fob. With the available Pro Trailer Backup Assist, you can turn a knob left or right for the direction you want to back up the trailer, and the truck controls steering and limits speed. \nSales King \nThey say it's lonely at the top and the Ford F-150 knows a thing or two about that. Not only has the F-150 been at the top of the light-duty pickup truck segment for almost four decades, it's been the country's best-selling vehicle overall for more than 30 years in a row. \nWhat About the Raptor? \nThe mega-off-roader Ford F-150 Raptor returns for the 2017 model year, as both a SuperCab and SuperCrew, at the end of 2016. \nBuild and Price \nThe 2017 Ford F-150 starts at under $28,000 and can climb beyond $68,000 with all the available upgrades. How much should you really pay?   Ford F-150 right here at KBB.com to unlock its current   \nOther Choices \nJust because the F-150 is the best-seller   truck for you.

      "text": "Tweet \nDraft Kings There are 41 entrants this week for the Ford EcoBoost 400, which means there are some teams that one doesn’t see very often. For the most part these drivers are racing for lightly-funded organizations in opportunity rides. Gray Gaulding in the No. 30, Jeffrey Earnhardt in a BK Racing entry, and Dylan Lupton in the No. 32 could hope to gain some valuable experience but it is highly unlikely they will gain many points.However, the movement at Leavine Family Racing this week creates an interesting option. Michael McDowell has been one of our go-to drivers since the addition of Todd Parrott at Charlotte Motor Speedway this fall. He moves into a second Leavine car so that Ty Dillon can get into the show in the No. 95. At first glance it seems unlikely that the resources will be great enough to get both to the front, but their price in the game is so low, in the $6k range, that taking them allows for an average of $9,350 per remaining player. Only seven drivers are more expensive this week.The sky is not the limit, but one can take at least two of the Chase contenders. That is important because the last two Chase finales showcased playoff contenders as the winner and second-place finisher. That is reflected in this week’s Draft Kings Salary caps. Jimmie Johnson is the most expensive driver at $10,800. Kyle Busch is third-most at $10,500 and Joey Logano is fourth-most expensive at $10,200. A case can be made for any of these guys winning the Cup, but our best guess is that it will go to Logano.Just because the Chase has been won by contenders in the past two years does not automatically mean they will win again. There have been some great values among the non-Chasers who should continue to be able to carry their momentum. Chase Elliott , Kyle Larson , and Ryan Blaney scored impressive top-10s last week at Phoenix International Raceway. They have been strong most of the fall and should continue to run well. Pick two of these three and that leaves cap value in the mid-$9k range. Matt Kenseth fits nicely in that final niche. He was in Chase contention until the Can-Am 500 went into overtime and the No. 20 was hit by Alex Bowman . Kenseth has the best Fantasy Power Ranking number at Homestead-Miami Speedway this week with a runner-up finish in 2013 and back-to-back top-10s in 2014/2015. Kenseth should be considered one of the favorites to run best among the non-Chasers and with some track position late in the Ford EcoBoost 400, ho could win outright. Lineup set while writing this article: Joey Logano ($10,200), Matt Kenseth ($9,300), Chase Elliott ($9,000), Kyle Larson ($8,800), Ty Dillon ($6,600), and Michael McDowell ($6,000) RaceDayScore Last week, Bowman had a career-defining race. He might have backed off and let Kenseth have the corner, but he protected his place on the track and defied the Chaser. His bad angle into the corner might have kept him from sticking to the bottom line, but he had the best car all afternoon. If the race had gone green, he might have won. This team has improved to a point where they are likely to contend for another top-10 in the Ford EcoBoost 400 and with a cap below the RaceDayScore midline of $10,000, they are an easy pick.Johnson is much cheaper in reference to the other Chasers in this contest and as a result, he is a great value with a price tag less than $11,000. He should be considered a likely choice to challenge Logano and Kyle Busch for the victory and championship.In fact, if a player takes the two Leavine Family drivers in this game as well as Bowman, they can fill the remainder of the roster with the top Chase contenders. Kyle Busch has struggled on a few occasions during the Chase, but he finds a way to surge when it matters most.If Busch is not to one’s liking, Martin Truex Jr. is available in the same price range. He has been one of the top performers on 1.5-mile tracks this year and if he stays out of trouble, he can also challenge for the win. Unfortunately, he has struggled to stay out of trouble this year as last week’s goat rope of a Can-Am 500 suggests. Watch him on Saturday and if he posts fast 10-lap averages, he can be started without much concern. Lineup set while writing this article: Joey Logano ($11,400), Kyle Busch ($11,300), Jimmie Johnson ($10,800), Alex Bowman ($9,700), Ty Dillon ($9,100), and Michael McDowell ($7,600) \nDraft Kings There are 41 entrants this week for the Ford EcoBoost 400, which means there are some teams that one doesn’t see very often.

Learn more... \nSat, Nov 19, 2016, 11:35 AM SGT - Singapore Markets closed Under pressure on U.S. jobs, Ford tries new gambit with Trump Reuters – 4 hours ago \nA newly remodeled Ford F250 Super Duty truck is displayed in front of the new Louisville Ford truck plant in Louisville, Kentucky, U.S. September 30, 2016. … \nBy David Shepardson \nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co (F.N), one of Donald Trump's prime corporate targets on the campaign trail, offered the President-elect a chance to claim a victory late on Thursday by informing him it would not shift production of a Lincoln sport utility vehicle to Mexico from Kentucky. \nTrump jumped at the chance, claiming in a tweet that he had \"worked hard\" with Ford Executive Chairman Bill Ford Jr. to keep the plant in Kentucky, even though Ford had never considered moving the whole factory south of the border. \nIn letting Trump claim a victory, Ford made what appeared to be a calculated, public appeal to the next president in an attempt to soothe concerns about outsourcing jobs and to gain some leverage with the new administration as the automaker pushes for favourable policy changes in Congress. \n\"Ford is not going to make a decision on a purely political basis,\" said Kristin Dziczek, director of industry, labour and economics at the Center for Automotive Research in Michigan. \n\"They are going to make a decision that makes business sense, economic sense and if it happens to align with political goals, that's great,\" she said. \nThe No. 2 automaker in the United States is not the only company in Trump's crosshairs working out how to deal with the new political reality in Washington. \nApple Inc (AAPL.O), criticized by Trump for not building products in the United States, is studying the possibility of moving iPhone production to the United States, Japanese news service Nikkei reported on Thursday. \nApple did not reply to a request for comment on Friday. \nJOBS = VOTES \nTrump campaigned heavily on bringing jobs to the United States and attacking companies such as Ford that plan to take some production overseas, a message that resonated in the economically ravaged centre of the country. \nFord gave Trump plenty of ammunition, confirming in September that all of its remaining small-car production in the United States, at its facility in Wayne, Michigan, would go to lower-cost Mexico by 2019. \nFord Chief Executive Mark Fields said no plants would be closed as a result, and no U.S. jobs would be lost as capacity at the Wayne plant would be taken up by two new models. \nThe Mexico plans remain in place, despite the fact that Trump vowed on the campaign trail to stop Ford opening a new plant in that country and promised to slap 35 percent tariffs on any Ford vehicles made there. \nFord went further this month, announcing on Election Day a new $195 million investment in India, where it will add 3,000 new jobs in a facility to build its new EcoSport SUV. Ford said this week it would import cars made there to the United States. Trump has not made any public comment on that plan. \nBOTH CLAIM VICTORY \nOn Thursday, Ford said it had been reviewing where to build the Lincoln MKC, just one vehicle built at the Louisville assembly plant, but had decided to keep it in Kentucky. \nAs such, nothing changed, but letting Trump announce the decision gave him the opportunity to claim he saved U.S. jobs and cast Ford as a patriotic manufacturer. \n\"Both sides will claim a certain level of victory because nobody wants a significant negative impact on the industry,\" said Dave Cole, chairman emeritus of the Center for Automotive Research. \nIt was unclear how many, if any, jobs were actually saved by the decision. Ford decided last year to move MKC production by 2019, on the assumption that production of the Ford Escape, a similar vehicle made in the same plant, would grow. But recently Escape demand has slumped, which may have prompted Ford to reconsider. \nAccording to Cole, Ford's olive branch to Trump was a clear indication that it needs help from the next administration as it faces a host of issues from fuel economy standards and the rise of autonomous vehicles to trade and currency. \nCole said Trump, who boasts about his dealmaking skills, may choose to focus on bargaining with companies he has targeted - even if only for small concessions - rather than pursue more punitive measures such as tariffs, which would take time to implement and potentially damage the economy. \nFord nodded to those wider issues in a statement on Friday, saying it was encouraged that Trump's economic policies \"will help improve U.S. competitiveness.\" \nFord, like other global U.S. corporations, agrees with key aspects of Trump's economic plans. It has called for U.S. tax reform and raised concerns about the costs of federal regulations. Ford also shares Trump's concerns about currency manipulation. \n(Editing by Bill Rigby) China's African population declines amid slowdown, crackdown Associated Press - 28 minutes ago Dreams are fading in China for African traders like Mouhamadou Moustapha Dieng, who in 2003 was among the first wave of Africans to set up homes and companies in this port city and forge trading links ... … More » Hong Kong, Chile ink investment deal at APEC meeting Associated Press - 38 minutes ago Hong Kong and Chile have signed a bilateral investment agreement on the sidelines of an Asian-Pacific summit in Peru.

      "text": "By Reuters / Reuters   5:26   \nWASHINGTON (Nov 17): U.S. President-elect Donald Trump said Ford Motor Co Executive Chairman Bill Ford Jr told him the automaker would not move a Kentucky plant to Mexico, but the firm said it informed him the decision was to keep one vehicle in U.S. production. \nOn Thursday, Trump posted on Twitter: \"I worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky. I owed it to the great State of Kentucky for their confidence in me!\" \n\"He will be keeping the Lincoln plant in Kentucky — no Mexico,\" the President-elect tweeted. \nBut Ford has repeatedly said it has no plans to close any U.S. plants and likely could not do so, under the terms of the current United Auto Workers contract that expires in 2019. \nThis is not the first time Trump's comments about Ford production have been called into question. Last year, he took credit for Ford moving work from Mexico to Ohio, while the automaker had already made the decision in 2011 — long before Trump announced a run for president. \nSpokeswoman Christin Baker said Ford \"confirmed with the President-elect that our small Lincoln utility vehicle made at the Louisville Assembly plant will stay in Kentucky\". \n\"We are encouraged that President-elect Trump and the new Congress will pursue policies that will improve U.S. competitiveness and make it possible to keep production of this vehicle here in the United States,\" she added, in a statement. \nThe company builds both the Ford Escape and Lincoln MKC SUV at its Louisville Assembly Plant in Kentucky, which Trump refers to as the \"Lincoln plant\" and where Ford employs about 4,700 people. It also has a separate truck plant in Louisville, where it builds pickups and larger SUVs. \nIt is not clear how many jobs would have been impacted if the low-selling MKC had moved to Mexico. \nFord has sold about 20,000 MKC SUVs this year in the United States, compared with 258,000 Escape SUVs. \nFord said last month it would suspend production of the Escape and MKC at its Louisville Assembly Plant in Kentucky for two weeks because of low demand. \nIn 2015, it told workers at the plant that it planned to phase out MKC production by 2019 and move it elsewhere. \nThe U.S. No. 2 automaker is planning to move some small-car production south of the border. \nScathing criticism \nFord has endured scathing criticism from Trump over its Mexican investments for nearly 18 months. \nHe has said at times incorrectly that Ford planned to fire American workers because of its Mexican investments. During his presidential campaign, the Republican candidate also said that if elected he would not allow Ford to open a new plant in Mexico and would slap hefty tariffs on any Ford vehicles made there. \nA Trump spokeswoman did not immediately respond to questions about whether Ford's decision to keep production of an SUV in the United States would cause him to drop plans to impose tariffs on some Ford vehicles built in Mexico. \nIn April 2015, Ford said it planned to invest US$2.5 billion to build two new plants in Mexico, adding 3,800 jobs in all. Earlier this year, Ford said it will invest a further US$1.6 billion in Mexico for small-car production to start in 2018. \nIn September, Ford confirmed that all of the company's small-car production will leave U.S. plants and head to lower-cost Mexico by 2019, but no plants would be closed as a result. \nFord has repeatedly said no U.S. jobs will be lost because of the move — and it will produce two new vehicles at a Detroit area plant that built the small cars. \nIn October, Bill Ford said he had met with Trump to talk about his extensive attacks on Ford's investments in Mexico. \nFord said Trump's criticism was \"infuriating\" and \"frustrating\" because of the company's extensive investments and employment in the United States.

I owed it to the great State of Kentucky for their confidence in me! \n\nFord representatives we contacted were initially wondering what Trump was talking about since the auto company has never said it plans to move production of the Lincoln MKC (a small SUV) out of the Louisville plant and to Mexico.\n\nWhat the company has said is that at some point in the future it would likely move the MKC out of Louisville ... when the current model runs out (within the next couple years). Where production of the MKC might go has never been finalized, but Ford's plants in Mexico might have been a possibility. Emphasis on the word \"might.\"\nThere are also other assembly plants in the U.S. where MKC production could have also been shifted to depending on a number of factors (UAW contracts, assembly line capacity, etc.).\nBottom line: Bill Ford has told the president-elect the Lincoln MKC is not going anywhere.\nSo yes, Trump can claim a victory in getting Ford to reverse plans to move the MKC out of Louisville at some point in the future.\nThat is no longer happening.\nQuestions?

      "text": "President-elect Donald Trump took credit this week for stopping Ford from moving an assembly plant from the U.S. to Mexico—but the automaker actually had no plans to relocate the plant.\nTrump wrote in a pair of tweets on Thursday evening that he “worked hard” with Ford Motor Co. Executive Chairman Bill Ford Jr. to keep its Lincoln plant in Kentucky instead of moving it to Mexico. Trump said Thursday that the executive called to tell him “he will be keeping the Lincoln plant in Kentucky—no Mexico.”\n“I owed it to the great State of Kentucky for their confidence in me!” Trump added.\nHowever, U.S. jobs were never at stake, according to reports. Ford currently produces the Lincoln MKC and the Ford Escape at its Louisville Assembly Plant, the Washington Post reports. The company had considered moving production of the Lincoln MKC from Kentucky to Mexico in order to build more Ford Escapes at the Kentucky plant, but Ford had previously said the change wouldn’t lead to any lost jobs in Kentucky.\nNow, though, the company is keeping Lincoln MKC production in Kentucky and will not produce additional Ford Escapes there. It was not immediately clear when Ford made the decision.\nFord issued a statement after Trump’s announcement, saying the company “confirmed” with Trump that “our small Lincoln utility vehicle made at the Louisville Assembly Plant will stay in Kentucky,” according to the Post .\n“We are encouraged that President-elect Trump and the new Congress will pursue policies that will improve U.S. competitiveness and make it possible to keep production of this vehicle here in the United States,” the statement said.\nJust got a call from my friend Bill Ford, Chairman of Ford, who advised me that he will be keeping the Lincoln plant in Kentucky – no Mexico\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 18, 2016\nI worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky. I owed it to the great State of Kentucky for their confidence in me!\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 18, 2016",

      "text": "Who We Are Trump Wins : Ford Won't Move Plant to Mexico \"We are encouraged that President-elect Trump and the new Congress will pursue policies that will improve U.S. competitiveness.\" 11.18.2016 Paul Bois \nAfter taking heavy fire from Donald Trump during the presidential campaign for potentially shipping American jobs to Mexico, Ford has now announced that it will not be moving its Lincoln assembly operations from Louisville, Kentucky to Mexico. \"Just got a call from my friend Bill Ford, Chairman of Ford, who advised me that he will be keeping the Lincoln plant in Kentucky — not Mexico,\" Trump wrote on Twitter \nFrom Breitbart : The news was shocking to local residents, since Ford had never announced any intention of moving Kentucky jobs to Mexico. Ford operates two plants in the Louisville community, with their truck plant producing the full-size Lincoln Navigator. Ford currently employs 4,705 at its massive 3,154,173-square-foot assembly facility, which sits on 180 acres located in the Northeast side of town. The facility has operated since 1955 and currently produces the mid-size Lincoln MKC small sport-utility, along with the very popular Ford Escape small-size SUV. Ford announced in a formal statement, \"Today, we confirmed with the President-elect that our small Lincoln utility vehicle made at the Louisville Assembly Plant will stay in Kentucky.” The company added, \"We are encouraged that President-elect Trump and the new Congress will pursue policies that will improve U.S. competitiveness and make it possible to keep production of this vehicle here in the United States.\" The issue of trade and shipping American jobs internationally became one of the cornerstones to Trump's campaign, propelling him to victories in Rust Belt states Ohio, Michigan, and Wisconsin. Back in September, Ford employees were deeply saddened to hear that all small car in the U.S would be shipping down to a modern Mexico facility employing 2,800 workers and 80 percent lower wages.

      "text": "DETROIT — President-elect Donald Trump claimed Thursday that he convinced the chairman of Ford Motor Co. not to move an assembly plant from Kentucky to Mexico. But Ford never intended to move the plant, just production of one of the vehicles it makes.\nTrump said in a tweet that Bill Ford, the company’s executive chairman, telephoned him with the news that a “Lincoln plant” would stay in Louisville. Instead Ford decided to keep production of the Lincoln MKC small SUV at the Louisville Assembly Plant. Ford had previously said it would move production of the MKC out of the plant in order to build more Ford Escapes there.\nJust got a call from my friend Bill Ford, Chairman of Ford, who advised me that he will be keeping the Lincoln plant in Kentucky – no Mexico\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 18, 2016\nA factory in Cuautitlan, Mexico, was likely to get the MKC. Under a contract negotiated last year with the United Auto Workers, Ford agreed to invest $700 million in the Louisville plant in return for moving the MKC production. Because Escape production would increase, no Louisville jobs would be lost.\nIt’s possible the decision to keep the MKC in Kentucky was made before the election, because Escape sales have been falling since July and additional production capacity in Louisville may not be needed. Ford spokeswoman Christin Baker said she didn’t know when that decision was made or if Trump had any impact on it.\n“I worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky. I owed it to the great State of Kentucky for their confidence in me!,” Trump said in the tweet claiming credit for Ford’s decision.\nFord Motor Co. and Trump have engaged in a yearlong feud over the automaker’s plans to move production south of the border. The company plans to shift small-car production from suburban Detroit to Mexico to improve profitability of the lower-priced cars. CEO Mark Fields said Tuesday that the presidential election didn’t change the company’s plan.\nTrump wants to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement and has called for a 35 percent tariff on goods shipped from Mexico in an effort to preserve U.S. manufacturing jobs.\nFord plans to move production of the Focus and C-Max small cars to Mexico from a plant in Wayne, Michigan. But jobs at the Wayne plant would be preserved because it’s getting a new SUV and small pickup truck.\nBill Ford met with Trump during the summer and spoke with him on Thursday, Baker said.\n“We are encouraged that President-elect Trump and the new Congress will pursue policies that will improve U.S. competitiveness and make it possible to keep production of this vehicle here in the United States,” she said in an e-mail.\n# Trump fact check Bill Ford detroit",

      "text": " count=\"235\" data-total-count=\"235\">Judging from a couple of Twitter messages by President-elect Donald J. Trump, he had scored a hard-won victory for American autoworkers by persuading Ford Motor to keep a Lincoln plant in Louisville, Ky., rather than move it to Mexico. The reality proved less straightforward.\nFord had never said it was moving a plant to Mexico, only that it was transferring the production of a small Lincoln sport utility vehicle there so it could fully dedicate a Louisville plant to a larger-selling model.\nThat decision has now been reversed — but either way, it will have no impact on jobs at the factory. The plant is already operating virtually around the clock at full capacity.\nThe decision, which Ford Motor said it made before Mr. Trump spoke by phone on Thursday with William Clay Ford Jr., the company’s executive chairman, will simply keep the current product mix in place at the factory.\nThe Louisville plant will continue making a far larger number of Ford Escapes, a small S.U.V. that is a less luxurious vehicle than the Lincoln model, the MKC.\n Ford, which during the election campaign was a frequent target of Mr. Trump’s criticism for moving jobs to Mexico, was no doubt waving a political olive branch by deciding to keep Lincoln MKC production in Kentucky. But the move was largely symbolic.\nAnd that Mr. Trump seemingly overstated its impact — if it proves emblematic of his future dealings with the industry — could indicate that his promises to save and restore auto jobs may not require significant changes on the part of carmakers.\nMr. Trump’s vows to protect manufacturing jobs in the United States helped him win the support of working-class voters, including many factory workers in Michigan, Ohio and Kentucky. He sought to underscore the message in his Twitter dispatches on Thursday night.\n“Just got a call from my friend Bill Ford, Chairman of Ford, who advised me that he will be keeping the Lincoln plant in Kentucky — no Mexico,” Mr. Trump wrote in a message.\nIn a subsequent post, he wrote : “I worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky. I owed it to the great State of Kentucky for their confidence in me!”\nBoth posts overstated certain issues.\nThe plant is not primarily a Lincoln plant — the MKC represents roughly 10 percent of its total output. The MKC is a more expensive version of the Ford Escape , which is a much bigger seller than the MKC. Production of the Escape alone is enough to keep the Louisville plant running at full capacity.\nMoreover, the decision to keep the MKC in Louisville was made before the two men spoke on Thursday, not as a result of their conversation, according to Ford.\n“We have been reviewing the sourcing of this product, and Bill Ford spoke to the President-elect yesterday and shared our recent decision to keep Lincoln MKC in Kentucky,” a Ford spokeswoman, Christin Baker, said in a statement on Friday. “We are encouraged the economic policies he will pursue will help improve U.S. competitiveness and make it possible to keep production of this vehicle here in the U.S.”\n Ford’s chief financial officer, Robert L. Shanks, held a conference call with analysts on Thursday morning in which he expressed hope that Mr. Trump’s policies would “provide an environment where it makes economic sense to build back up manufacturing jobs here.”\nBut how Mr. Trump governs may be “a bit different” from his campaign speeches, Mr. Shanks said. “So let’s just wait and see.’’\nDuring the campaign, Mr. Trump heavily criticized Ford for deciding to shuffle its manufacturing operations so that all its small cars are made in Mexico. At times, he even suggested hitting the company and others with a 35 percent tariff on vehicles imported from Mexico.\nFord has countered that moving small-car assembly to Mexican plants would have no impact on American jobs.\nFor example, a factory in Wayne, Mich., that now makes the weakly selling Ford Focus compact will be retooled to make trucks and S.U.V.s, which are selling briskly. Ford said the higher profit margins on trucks and S.U.V.s allow it to absorb the higher labor costs of building the vehicles in the United States.\nThe Wayne plant is expected to remain fully staffed with 3,700 workers.\nIn October, speaking to reporters at an auto technology conference, Mr. Ford voiced frustration with the criticism Mr. Trump was then aiming at the company.\n“Look, we are everything he should be celebrating about this country,” Mr. Ford said, noting that the company makes more cars and trucks in United States plants than any of its rivals and that it was investing in its American operations and adding jobs.\n“He knows all that,” Mr. Ford said of Mr. Trump at the time. “I can’t control what he says.”\n This week, Ford’s chief executive, Mark Fields, spoke at the Los Angeles Auto Show and reiterated the company’s commitment to shift assembly of small cars like the Focus to Mexico.\nThe decision on the MKC gave Mr. Ford some good news to pass on to Mr. Trump.\nFord wanted to move the MKC to another plant to increase production of the Escape, a change that had been planned for 2018. It could still increase output of the Escape by cutting back the number of MKCs it makes in Louisville, or it could move the Lincoln model to another plant in the United States.\nThe Louisville plant’s work force would remain unchanged even if the MKC were moved to a new factory. The factory employs 4,500 hourly workers and is operating on three shifts, producing vehicles almost around the clock.\nIn the first 10 months of this year, the plant made nearly 300,000 Ford Escapes and just over 37,000 Lincoln MKCs.\nIn the auto industry, plants are considered to be operating at 100 percent capacity if they are running two shifts a day. Most typically produce 200,000 to 250,000 vehicles a year.",

      "title": "Ford's Change on Kentucky Plant Is an Olive Branch to Donald Trump Administration",
      "text": "By Christina Rogers and John D. Stoll\nOne of the U.S. auto industry's best-known figures has extended an olive branch to President-elect Donald Trump by informing him the car maker won't move a small amount of production to Mexico, the latest effort by a business leader to thaw tension stemming from the incoming administration's position on key issues, including global trade.\nBill Ford, the great-grandson of Henry Ford and chairman of Ford Motor Co., called Mr. Trump on Thursday to inform him the company was reversing course on a plan to eventually relocate Lincoln sport-utility production from Kentucky to a factory south of the U.S. border. The auto maker is sticking with its $1.6 billion construction of a new small-car plant in Mexico, but is signaling confidence in its ability to work with Mr. Trump on making U.S. manufacturing more attractive to multinational companies.\nMr. Trump overplayed Ford's decision in a tweet about the conversation he posted to his Twitter account Thursday night, suggesting Ford would no longer relocate a Lincoln plant from Louisville to Mexico. The Dearborn, Mich., company only wanted to move one model to Mexico in this case, and it never intended to close the Kentucky plant or cut jobs, according to company and union officials.\nOfficials working on Mr. Trump's transition team didn't return requests for comment.\nMr. Ford's outreach reflects a broader move by business leaders to mend fences with the president-elect after a brutal campaign. Following the election, Ford Chief Executive Mark Fields sent a congratulatory letter to Mr. Trump even after the New York businessman had repeatedly criticized the auto maker's plan to relocate Ford Focus production from Michigan to Mexico.\nOther companies made similar pushes. International Business Machines Corp. CEO Ginni Rometty published an open letter to Mr. Trump this week offering support for his policies, even after the president-elect criticized IBM and other companies for moving U.S. jobs overseas.\nDish Network Corp. Chief Executive Charlie Ergen has said a Trump administration would bring a \"lot of positives for business,\" including infrastructure spending and reduced corporate-tax burdens. Caterpillar Inc., a maker of construction and mining equipment, applauded Mr. Trump's pledge to boost infrastructure spending.\nSome of the outreach has come with a downside.\nSneaker maker New Balance Athletic Inc. publicly backed the president-elect's antitrade stance, welcoming Mr. Trump's election as a reprieve from the policies of President Barack Obama. New Balance's position, however, has incited a social media backlash, with hundreds of consumers posting that they'd throw out their sneakers.\nMr. Trump's complaints concerning Ford reflect broader criticism of the North American Free Trade Agreement, which some blame as the culprit for job loss in manufacturing sectors like automobiles. Mr. Trump has proposed a 35% tariff on autos and other products imported from low-cost countries such as Mexico. Mr. Fields said earlier this week that policy would be bad for his industry and the broader economy, but insisted he and the president-elect share the same objective of boosting the U.S. economy.\nIn making the Lincoln decision, Ford said it was \"encouraged that President-elect Trump and the new Congress will pursue policies that will improve U.S. competitiveness and make it possible to keep production of this vehicle here in the United States.\"\nFord's change of plans is largely symbolic and is similar to arrangements it has been making with the United Auto Workers for decades as the union lost members amid perpetual restructuring efforts by Detroit's Big Three.\nThe auto maker had planned to move the Lincoln MKC, a small sport-utility sold in low volumes that shares components with the popular Ford Escape.\nThe factory wasn't in danger of closing or shedding jobs. Rather, Ford was moving MKC production to make room for building more Escape crossovers, the company's second-best selling model.\nStill, keeping the Lincoln output in Kentucky means Ford will make future investments in tooling or other factory enhancements needed to make the MKC in the U.S. rather than reroute that capital to Mexico. And it is a win for its hourly workers, about one-third of whom are estimated to have voted for Mr. Trump, according to preliminary UAW figures.\nEven though Ford builds more than 10 Escapes in Kentucky for every Lincoln that rolls down the assembly line, keeping the MKC nameplate in an American factory is meaningful to the UAW, which has sided with Mr. Trump's Nafta position. Mr. Trump's ability to identify with concerns held by workers in states like Michigan, Pennsylvania or Ohio helped propel him to victory in early November.\nUAW officials were slated to meet with Ford executives Friday to discuss the change in plans.\nFor the union, retaining production of even the lowest-volume of cars is a priority because it provides a hedge if the market should shift away from one of the other products UAW workers assemble. This is an argument UAW officials have repeatedly made as Ford and other auto makers, including Fiat Chrysler Automobiles and General Motors Co., sink deeper investments into Mexico for the production of vehicles, including less profitable small cars.\nWrite to Christina Rogers at christina.rogers@wsj.com and John D.

Ford said this week it would import its Ford EcoSport built in India to the United States. Trump has not made any public comment on that plan. \nBOTH CLAIM VICTORY \nOn Thursday, Ford said it had been reviewing where to build the Lincoln MKC, just one vehicle built at the Louisville assembly plant, but had decided to keep it in Kentucky. \nAs such, nothing changed, but letting Trump announce the decision gave him the opportunity to claim he saved U.S. jobs and cast Ford as a patriotic manufacturer. \n\"Both sides will claim a certain level of victory because nobody wants a significant negative impact on the industry,\" said Dave Cole, chairman emeritus of the Center for Automotive Research. \nIt was unclear how many, if any, jobs were actually saved by the decision. Ford decided last year to move MKC production by 2019, on the assumption that production of the Ford Escape, a similar vehicle made in the same plant, would grow. But recently Escape demand has slumped, which may have prompted Ford to reconsider. \nAccording to Cole, Ford's olive branch to Trump was a clear indication that it needs help from the next administration as it faces a host of issues from fuel economy standards and the rise of autonomous vehicles to trade and currency. \nCole said Trump, who boasts about his dealmaking skills, may choose to focus on bargaining with companies he has targeted - even if only for small concessions - rather than pursue more punitive measures such as tariffs, which would take time to implement and potentially damage the economy. \nFord nodded to those wider issues in a statement on Friday, saying it was encouraged that Trump's economic policies \"will help improve U.S. competitiveness.\" \nFord, like other global U.S. corporations, agrees with key aspects of Trump's economic plans. It has called for U.S. tax reform and raised concerns about the costs of federal regulations. Ford also shares Trump's concerns about currency manipulation. \n(Editing by Bill Rigby) National smart city alliance needed Business Times - 3 hours ago KUALA LUMPUR: With technological applications being at the forefront of the smart cities concept and in making cities more liveable, one may wonder about Malaysia’s smart city initiative.

UAW President Dennis Williams last week said he was open to working with the incoming administration on reworking that agreement.\nFord continues to plan to separately move a substantial part of its passenger car production from Michigan to a new $1.6 billion facility in Mexico, although that move isn't currently expected to result in employment reduction for the UAW.\nWhile that issue is likely to remain a sticking point between Ford, the UAW and the president-elect, the Lincoln announcement isn't going unnoticed.\nUnion officials only learned about the Lincoln decision and the call between the chairman and president-elect through Mr. Trump's tweet and are meeting with Ford executives to learn more about what transpired between the president-elect and the company in making this decision, according to people briefed on the matter.\nTodd Dunn, president for the union local in Louisville, Ky., said the UAW wasn't aware Ford had plans to move Lincoln output to Mexico. Rather, union members were told \"months ago\" that Ford had committed to building the vehicle at the plant through the 2019 model year. After that, it would move the crossover to another, unspecified plant, to make room for building more Escapes, he said.\nNo job reductions were expected to result from the move and the plant was never in danger of closing, Mr. Dunn added.

      "text": "Published: Sat, November 19, 2016 @ 12:00 a.m. Trump claims to save plant, But it wasn’t shuttering doors \nAssociated Press \nDETROIT \nPresident-elect Donald Trump claimed Thursday that he convinced the chairman of Ford Motor Co. not to move an assembly plant from Kentucky to Mexico. But Ford never intended to move the plant, just production of one of the vehicles it makes. \nTrump said in a tweet that Bill Ford, the company’s executive chairman, telephoned him with the news that a “Lincoln plant” would stay in Louisville. \nInstead, Ford decided to keep production of the Lincoln MKC small SUV at the Louisville Assembly Plant. Ford had previously said it would move production of the MKC out of the plant in order to build more Ford Escapes there. \nA factory in Cuautitlan, Mexico, was likely to get the MKC. Under a contract negotiated last year with the United Auto Workers, Ford agreed to invest $700 million in the Louisville plant in return for moving production of the MKC. Because Escape production would increase, no Louisville jobs would be lost. \nIt’s possible the decision to keep the MKC in Kentucky was made before the election, because Escape sales have been falling since July and additional production capacity in Louisville may not be needed. \nOn Friday, Ford would say only that the MKC decision was “recent,” but spokeswoman Christin Baker wouldn’t say exactly when it was made or whether Trump directly influenced it. \nThe MKC and Escape are essentially the same vehicle and are now built by the same workers on the same assembly line. \nBut while Ford has sold over 258,000 Escapes so far this year, it’s only sold about 21,000 MKCs. So, moving the MKC would have had little impact on the factory even if Escape production was not increased. \nStill, Trump claimed credit for saving a factory from moving to Mexico. “I worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky. I owed it to the great State of Kentucky for their confidence in me!” Trump said in one of two tweets on the subject. His initial tweet said: “Just got a call from my friend Bill Ford, Chairman of Ford, who advised me that he will be keeping the Lincoln plant in Kentucky - no Mexico.” \nFord Motor Co. and Trump have engaged in a yearlong feud over the automaker’s plans to move production south of the border. The company plans to shift small-car production from suburban Detroit to Mexico to improve profitability of the lower-priced cars.  ",

      "text": "How ugly will Democrats get in smearing Jeff Sessions? \nFord is trying to get on the good side of Donald Trump, with the company’s top executive personally calling the president-elect to say it no longer plans to move production of one of its lines from Kentucky to Mexico. \nA jubilant Trump — who had blasted the automaker for shipping manufacturing jobs south of the border during the campaign — quickly took to Twitter to crow about the development. \n“Just got a call from my friend Bill Ford, Chairman of Ford, who advised me that he will be keeping the Lincoln plant in Kentucky — no Mexico,” Trump wrote. \nFord had earlier called Trump to say production of the Lincoln MKC was being kept stateside, a company spokesman confirmed. \n“Bill shared Ford’s continued commitment to invest in the US,” spokesman Christin Baker told The Detroit Free Press . \nTrump later patted himself on the back for the decision — which amounts to a symbolic victory for the incoming president. \n“I worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky. I owed it to the great State of Kentucky for their confidence in me!” the president-elect later tweeted from Trump Tower. \nTrump won nearly 63 percent of the vote in the Bluegrass State — and had threatened to slap a 35 percent tariff on vehicles made by US manufacturers outside of the country. \nBut while the auto giant had said it would start building vehicles in Mexico, it never planned to close its manufacturing plant in Louisville and was in fact investing $700 million to expand it. \nTrump’s claim to have saved the factory — which employs about 4,700 workers — prompted widespread snark in the media. \nFord now manufactures both the Ford Escape SUV and the Lincoln MKC at the Kentucky plant. \nThe company had announced in 2015 that MKC production would move to another factory so the company could boost production of the Escape in Louisville. \nBut the company insisted that no jobs would be lost because the factory space allocated to the slow-selling Lincoln would be shifted to the fast-moving Escape. \nIn September, Ford confirmed that all of the company’s small-car production will leave US plants and head to lower-cost Mexico by 2019, but no plants would be closed as a result. \nFord said it welcomed Trump’s plan to make the US more competitive. \n“We are encouraged that President-elect Trump and the new Congress will pursue policies that will improve US competitiveness,” Baker said.

      "text": "In Overture, Ford Rethinks Car Plan -- WSJ November 19, 2016, 02:47:  By Christina Rogers and John D. Stoll \nOne of the U.S. auto industry's best-known figures extended an olive branch to President-elect Donald Trump, saying the car maker won't move certain production to Mexico -- the latest business leader to thaw tension stemming from concerns about the incoming administration's stance on trade. \nBill Ford, the great-grandson of Henry Ford and chairman of Ford Motor Co., called Mr. Trump on Thursday to tell him the company was reversing course on a plan to eventually relocate Lincoln sport-utility production from Kentucky to a factory south of the U.S. border, the company confirmed. \nMr. Trump overplayed Ford's decision in a tweet about the conversation he posted to his Twitter account Thursday night, suggesting Ford would no longer relocate a Lincoln plant from Louisville to Mexico. The Dearborn, Mich., company only wanted to move one model to Mexico in this case, and it never intended to close the Kentucky plant or cut jobs, according to company and union officials. \nOfficials working on Mr. Trump's transition team didn't respond to requests for comment. \nMr. Ford's outreach reflects a broader move by business leaders to mend fences with the president-elect after a brutal campaign. Following the election, Ford Chief Executive Mark Fields sent a congratulatory letter to Mr. Trump, despite the New York businessman's repeated criticisms of the auto maker's plan to relocate Ford Focus production from Michigan to Mexico. \nOther companies made similar pushes. International Business Machines Corp. CEO Ginni Rometty published an open letter to Mr. Trump this week offering support for his policies, even after the president-elect criticized IBM and other companies for moving U.S. jobs overseas. \nDish Network Corp. Chief Executive Charlie Ergen has said a Trump administration would bring a \"lot of positives for business,\" including infrastructure spending and reduced corporate-tax burdens. Caterpillar Inc., a maker of construction and mining equipment, applauded Mr. Trump's pledge to boost infrastructure spending. \nSome of the outreach has come with a downside. Sneaker maker New Balance Athletic Inc. publicly backed the president-elect's antitrade stance, welcoming Mr. Trump's election as a reprieve from the policies of President Barack Obama. That support, however, incited a social-media backlash, with hundreds of consumers posting that they would throw out their sneakers. \nMr. Trump's complaints concerning Ford reflect broader criticism of the North American Free Trade Agreement, which some blame as the culprit for job losses in manufacturing sectors like automobiles. Mr. Trump has proposed a 35% tariff on autos and other products imported from low-cost countries such as Mexico. \nMr. Fields said earlier this week the tariffs would hurt his industry and the broader economy, but said he and the president-elect share the same objective of boosting the U.S. economy. \nThe tariff \"would be harmful, I think, to the entire industry and the economy and therefore we want to engage in a very productive set of discussions,\" he said. He noted Nafta has increased the interwoven connections shared by auto industries in the U.S., Canada and Mexico. \nMany in the auto industry say untangling the trade pact would be costly and complicated because of the multilayered connections between U.S. and foreign suppliers and assembly points. The tens of thousands of parts that make up any vehicle often come from multiple producers in different countries and travel back and forth across borders several times. \nMore than half the parts in the Ford Focus, for instance, are made outside the U.S. and Canada, including 20% in Mexico. Ford also ships in some of the car's engines from Spain and transmissions from Germany. \nWorries over Mr. Trump's Nafta stance are shared outside the auto industry. Martin Richenhagen, CEO of farm- equipment maker Agco Corp., said he is concerned about Mr. Trump's repeated support for trade protectionism. \n\"That would be a nightmare if we make life difficult for imports and exports,\" Mr. Richenhagen said. \nIn making the Lincoln decision, Ford said it was \"encouraged that President-elect Trump and the new Congress will pursue policies that will improve U.S. competitiveness and make it possible to keep production of this vehicle here in the United States.\" \nFord's change of plans is similar to arrangements it has been making with the United Auto Workers for decades as the union lost members amid perpetual restructuring efforts by Detroit's Big Three. \nThe auto maker had planned to move the Lincoln MKC, a small sport-utility sold in low volumes that shares components with the popular Ford Escape. \nThe factory wasn't in danger of closing or shedding jobs. Rather, Ford was moving MKC production to make room for building more Escape crossovers, the company's second-best selling model. \nStill, keeping the Lincoln output in Kentucky means Ford will make future investments in tooling or other factory enhancements needed to make the MKC in the U.S., rather than reroute that capital to Mexico. And it offers reassurance for its hourly workers, about one-third of whom are estimated to have voted for Mr. Trump, according to preliminary UAW figures. \nEven though Ford builds more than 10 Escapes in Kentucky for every Lincoln that rolls down the assembly line, keeping the MKC nameplate in an American factory is meaningful to the UAW, which has sided with Mr. Trump's Nafta position. Mr. Trump's ability to identify with concerns held by workers in states like Michigan, Pennsylvania and Ohio helped propel him to victory on election day in early November. \nThe UAW appeared reluctant to declare Ford's change in plans a victory. In a joint statement with the company, UAW officials reiterated that moving Lincoln output would have allowed for more Escape production but the company \"has since re-evaluated that plan based on changing business conditions.\" \nFord Escape sales have slumped in recent months and the once-booming U.S. auto market is cooling off, with analysts saying industry sales have already peaked. \nFor the union, retaining production of even the lowest-volume of cars is a priority because it provides a hedge if the market shifts away from one of the other products UAW workers assemble. This is an argument UAW officials have repeatedly made as Ford and other auto makers, including Fiat Chrysler Automobiles and General Motors Co., sink deeper investments into Mexico for the production of vehicles, including less-profitable small cars. \nWrite to Christina Rogers at christina.rogers@wsj.com and John D.

      "title": "Ford Will Keep Producing Lincoln MKC in Kentucky; Trump Claims Victory",
      "text": "Email \nEarly Thursday evening President-elect Donald Trump tweeted : “Just got a call from my friend Bill Ford, Chairman of Ford, who advised me that he will be keeping the Lincoln plant in Kentucky — no Mexico.” A few minutes later he tweeted an addendum: “I worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky. I owed it to the great State of Kentucky for their confidence in me!” (Trump won Kentucky’s 8 electoral votes by beating Hillary Clinton, 62 percent to 32 percent.) \nThe anti-Trump media jumped all over Trump’s self-proclaimed “victory,\" noting in the process that he got some of his facts wrong: The plant was never in jeopardy — just the manufacturing of the company’s low-volume luxury SUV, the Lincoln MKC. On Friday morning Ford tweeted back the correction: “Louisville plant wasn’t moving; MKC was. Pres-elect’s econ policy will help boost American competitiveness, keep MKC here.” \nTrump had spent considerable time on the campaign trail attacking Ford’s plan to move jobs to Mexico and threatening that, as president, he would raise tariffs on cars made there as punishment. This would also effectively terminate NAFTA, the so-called North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). \nNow, Bill Ford is Donald Trump’s newest best friend, working together for the “common good.\" In a statement to that effect, Ford said, “We are encouraged that President-elect Trump and the new Congress will pursue policies that will improve U.S. competitiveness and make it possible to keep production of this vehicle [the MKC] here in the United States.” \nThis is how business is done in a managed economy, where government interference in the free market is accepted as fact, and where consequently business has to be quick on its feet to stay competitive, or even remain in business. Bill Ford is nothing if not a realist. \nFord had planned to move the building of its MKC automobile to its existing plant in Mexico where wages are estimated to be 80 percent lower than in the United States. That would allow the company to keep all 4,700 workers in its Louisville plant employed by expanding production of its low-cost high-volume Focus automobile. It had done the math before Trump’s surprise victory, and it made sense: like in dollars and cents. Labor costs make up between 10 and 15 percent of the cost of the MKC and moving its production to Mexico would increase the company’s profit margin on it considerably. \nAlong came Trump and his surprise victory last week. That changed the math. Now there was a political element in play: Trump had been attacking Ford for months on the campaign trail and, in January, he would have the power, through the Department of Commerce which resides in the Executive Branch, to inflict punishment by dictating tariffs. Prior to November 8 it was, as far as Ford was concerned, just campaign rhetoric. On November 9, it was real. \nTrump made his point. Ford looked like a winner. As Bill Ford told reporters back in September, “We are everything that [Trump] should be celebrating about this country. We pulled ourselves up by our bootstraps, we paid back our borrowings, we are healthy again, we’ve been adding jobs in the U.S. and we are the largest manufacturer of cars and trucks in the U.S.” \nSome think it’s just a little early for President-elect Trump to be throwing his weight around. Others think Ford is doing what any company operating in a “mixed economy” (i.e., government intervention in the free market) would do: adjusting to the new reality even before it becomes a reality. Ford readjusts its “manufacturer’s suggested retail price” sticker on its luxury MKC a little. And MKC production stays in Kentucky. \n\nAn Ivy League graduate and former investment advisor, Bob is a regular contributor to The New American magazine and blogs frequently at LightFromTheRight.com, primarily on economics and politics.

      "text": "With dawn of Trump era, Ford cuts profit outlook By KEITH NAUGHTON Bloomberg News First Published 34 minutes ago • Updated 34 minutes ago Share This Article Ford Motor Co., cutting its 2017 profit forecast for the second time in three months, said it sees a bumpier future as President-elect Donald J. Trump translates his campaign promises into new policies on trade, tariffs and regulation. \"It feels like a world that's even more volatile,\" Bob Shanks, Ford's chief financial officer, said in a presentation to analysts today. The Trump administration \"is going to be an opportunity for substantial change.\" Complicating matters, those changes are coming just as U.S. auto sales are slowing after a record six straight years of growth -- meaning there's now a glut of used cars that is hurting profit at its Ford Credit unit. On an optimistic note, Shanks said the automaker does expect Trump to have a \"pro-growth\" strategy for the economy. That might include easing tough fuel-economy regulations to reflect consumers' preference for trucks and sport utility vehicles -- instead of electric cars -- in an era of cheap gasoline. VIDEOS TOP JOBS \"If the new government is serious about accelerating and growing in a very healthy way the U.S. economy -- and I believe it is -- I think it will take measures that will enable that,\" Shanks said. Hitting Ford with a 35 percent duty on cars it makes in Mexico and brings back to the U.S., as Trump threatened during the campaign, \"would be contrary to that.\" Ford is talking to Trump's transition team, while also speaking with federal regulators about how low gas prices are undermining efforts to get Americans to buy electric cars and hybrids so that automakers can achieve a goal to average more than 50 miles per gallon by 2025. \"There's been no movement whatsoever for electrified products, which is probably driven by the fact that gas prices are so low,\" Shanks said. \"It's just not what any of us had expected, including the government. And it's going to be very difficult, therefore, to get there without pushing on the customers things they just don't want.\" More immediately, Ford is still adjusting to a slowing auto market -- cutting its forecast for 2017 pretax profits because of declining auction values for used cars. Ford shares fell 1.1 percent to $11.87 in New York and had declined 14 percent this year through Thursday. Pretax earnings for the automaker's credit unit next year will be about $1.5 billion, $300 million lower than its previous estimate, the company said Thursday in a regulatory filing. In September, Ford reduced its 2016 profit prediction by $600 million due to rising recall costs. The second-largest U.S. automaker reiterated that it expects total company adjusted pretax profit to drop in 2017 as it invests in \"emerging opportunities,\" and forecast improvement in 2018. Hertz Global Holdings Inc. last week cut its annual earnings forecast, citing a drop in used-car values, especially for compact and mid-sized cars, which have come under pressure as American buyers shift to pickups and sport utility vehicles. Ford has undertaken an extensive, expensive effort to transform itself to take on interlopers including Uber Technologies Inc. and Google. The carmaker has said it will be selling 100,000 robot taxis -- without a steering wheel, gas or brake pedals -- annually by 2021. It's also investing $4.5 billion to convert 40 percent of its product lineup to electrified vehicles by 2020 and has begun offering bike sharing and a commuter van service in San Francisco. \"Clearly the investments we're making in emerging opportunities, whether it's electrification or autonomy or mobility, will impact our earnings,\" Chief Executive Officer Mark Fields said on Bloomberg TV last month. \"Further out, those businesses will start to contribute to the company's bottom line.\"",

It will be designed and built around the existing museum, which includes the Motown studio with its \"Hitsville U.S.A.\" facade. \nDesigners and architects are collaborating on details of the expanded space. \nThe museum is located in the house where record company founder Berry Gordy launched his cultural and commercial music empire. The label started in 1959 and scores of stars and hits were created before Motown moved to California in 1972.",

President-elect Donald Trump claimed Thursday that he convinced the chairman of Ford Motor Co. not to move an assembly plant from Kentucky to Mexico. But Ford never intended to move the plant, just production of one of the vehicles it makes. Paul Sancya — The Associated Press By Tom Krisher, The Associated Press Posted: # Comments \nDETROIT >> President-elect Donald Trump has a long list of deceptive statements about Ford Motor Co. and the auto industry, and he added to that list this week. \nTrump’s tweet on Thursday asserting that he had dissuaded Ford from moving a Kentucky factory to Mexico was a stretch, at the very least. The company has no intention of moving the plant, and it had already agreed to keep production of one specific model there. \nThroughout the campaign, Trump accused Ford of exporting U.S. jobs south of the border and, in alarming terms, contended that auto jobs are leaving the country in mass. He also misstated the impact of trade agreements on U.S. auto jobs and has threatened to impose a 35 percent tariff on goods imported from Mexico. \nWhile it’s true that Ford and others have spent billions of dollars on assembly and parts plants in Mexico, the industry also has added thousands of U.S. jobs since auto sales recovered from the Great Recession. There aren’t as many jobs at U.S. auto plants as there were a decade ago, but that’s due more to automation than to the free-trade agreements that Trump has criticized. Advertisement \nHere are how Trump’s statements about Ford and the industry stack up with the facts: \nTRUMP: “Just got a call from my friend Bill Ford, Chairman of Ford, who advised me that he will be keeping the Lincoln plant in Kentucky — no Mexico.” \nTHE FACTS: Ford never had any intention of moving a factory from Kentucky to Mexico. But it did propose shifting production of the Lincoln MKC small SUV from Louisville to Cuautitlan, Mexico. The idea was to free assembly-line space to make more Ford Escapes, which are made on the same line as the MKC. In a deal with the United Auto Workers union, Ford agreed to invest $700 million in the plant and not cut any jobs, since workers would still make Escapes. \nSo, while Trump may have been responsible for keeping production of the MKC in Louisville — Ford wouldn’t say if he directly played a role — there should be little if any impact on the Louisville plant’s 4,700 workers. Ford has sold only 21,000 MKCs so far this year, compared with 258,000 Escapes. Also, Escape sales have been falling since July, so the need for added factory capacity to build more of them isn’t needed. \nTRUMP: “Our jobs are fleeing the country. They’re going to Mexico. They’re going to many other countries. ... Ford is leaving ... thousands of jobs leaving Michigan, leaving Ohio.” \nTHE FACTS: Trump was referring to Ford’s plans to shift all small-car production to Mexico to take advantage of lower wages. The company announced this year that it would move the Ford Focus and C-Max from suburban Detroit to a new plant south of the border. But the move wouldn’t cost any U.S. jobs. The 3,700 workers at the plant in Wayne, Michigan, that now makes the small cars will stay employed building a new SUV and small pickup truck. \nTrump and his supporters contend the Mexican jobs could have been added in the U.S. if Ford built a new factory here instead of in Mexico. But Ford says it’s nearly impossible to make money building small cars in the U.S., while Mexico’s lower costs of production, including wages, allow the automaker to turn a profit on the vehicles. \nAs for jobs fleeing the U.S., the U.S. auto industry has actually added 300,000 jobs since June 2009, when the recession ended. \nTRUMP: When he becomes president “The auto industry will come roaring back.” \nTHE FACTS: The industry has already roared back from the financial crisis. Total U.S. auto sales reached a record level of 17.5 million last year. They may tail off slightly this year, but sales are expected to stay near the record or even grow during the next several years. The resurgence has benefited both U.S.-based and foreign automakers, many of which have U.S. factories. \nTRUMP: “According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, before NAFTA went into effect, there were 285,000 auto workers in Michigan. Today, that number is only 160,000.” \nTHE FACTS: Michigan actually added jobs after the North American Free Trade Agreement began in 1994, when auto-manufacturing and auto-parts plants employed roughly 280,000 workers. Over the next six years, their ranks increased to 320,000. But the jobs started falling in Michigan as U.S. automakers lost market share, automation increased and the Great Recession hit. Auto employment bottomed out at 95,000 in 2009 and recovered to about 165,000 as of September. \nEDITOR’S NOTE A look at the veracity of claims by political figures",

      "text": "SEND PDF \nWASHINGTON – President-elect Donald J. Trump claimed credit on Thursday night for persuading Ford to keep an automaking plant in Kentucky rather than moving it to Mexico. The only wrinkle: Ford was not actually planning to move the plant. \nTrump wrote on Twitter shortly after 9 p.m. Eastern time that Ford’s chairman, William Clay Ford Jr., had just told him that Ford “will be keeping the Lincoln plant in Kentucky — no Mexico.” \nMinutes later, Trump wrote in a second post: “I worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky. I owed it to the great State of Kentucky for their confidence in me!” Trump won 62.5 percent of the state’s popular vote in the presidential election. \nDuring the campaign, he repeatedly criticized Ford for moving production to Mexico, and he threatened to impose a 35 percent tariff on vehicles made there. \nFord makes the Lincoln MKC, a sport utility vehicle, at a factory in Louisville. Last week, Ford said it planned to move production of the vehicle elsewhere. On Thursday night, after Trump’s Twitter messages, the company said that Mexico had been the intended destination and that it would now keep MKC production in Kentucky. \nBut Ford had not planned to close the Louisville factory. Instead, it had planned to expand production of another vehicle made in Louisville, the Ford Escape. And the change had not been expected to result in any job losses. \n“Whatever happens in Louisville, it will not lose employment,” Jimmy Settles, a union official, told The Detroit Free Press. “They cannot make enough Escapes.” \nNow, thanks to Trump, the plant will make fewer Escapes — and more MKCs. \n“We are encouraged that President-elect Trump and the new Congress will pursue policies that will improve U.S. competitiveness and make it possible to keep production of this vehicle here in the United States,” Ford said in a statement.",

      "text": "The EPA’s Fuel Efficiency Testing May Not Work. Like, at All \nA report from the group shows that BMW, General Motors, Honda, Kia, Mazda, Nissan, Toyota, and VW/Audi also build small cars in Mexico . It’s easy to see why. Ever-stricter US emissions and safety regulations increase manufacturing costs. Building cars where wages are lower is cheaper for automakers, and consumers. \nThis effect is greatest with small, inexpensive automobiles—where labor comprises a significant chunk of production costs and margins are narrow. Mexico’s free trade agreements with 44 countries make it attractive to automakers because exports aren’t subject to tariffs. \nLabor comprises a smaller percentage of the cost of larger, more expensive vehicles like trucks and SUVs, which have far larger profit margins for automakers. In other words, it makes more economic sense to build cheap cars abroad and expensive cars at home—which is what Ford plans to do. This helps American workers, because Ford has promised to build two new vehicles in Dearborn. It won’t say more, but they are believed to be a Ranger pickup and Bronco SUV. \nPremium features like leather seats and large touch-screens make such vehicles more expensive to produce and “higher content,” meaning they contain more parts—and therefore require more labor to assemble. That means more jobs for Ford, and its suppliers. Inside the Factory Where Acura Builds the NSX Supercar \nWhat’s more, the factory jobs in the US often require more highly skilled—and more highly paid—employees. For example, Ford uses aluminum to build the F-150 pickup. The material requires specialized equipment and skills. In those cases where robots do some of the work, factories need technicians to keep them running. Automakers favor “just in time” inventories in which suppliers deliver parts when they’re needed. These suppliers tend to set up shop near the factories they serve. That, too, can lead to more jobs. \n“It’s changing manufacturing, factories look nothing like they did a couple of years ago,” says Swiecki. \nLooking ahead, hybrid and electric vehicles will be a growing part of the market, as will autonomous vehicles . Automakers may build their cheap cars abroad, but they tend to keep the design, R&D and manufacturing of their most advanced vehicles at home. Again, Ford is not alone here: General Motors proudly developed and built its new halo cars, the Volt and the Bolt electric cars , entirely in Michigan. \nThe benefits of this are obvious with regard to autonomous vehicles, which Ford plans to have on the road by 2021 ; Boston Global Consulting predicts the self-driving vehicle market will be worth $42 billion and create 100,000 new jobs by 2025. \nSo despite the alarmists and liars, US automotive jobs aren’t going anywhere, at least not in the short term. “Detroit is still the head on the body of the automotive industry,” Swiecki says. Motown needn’t worry about Mexico. Now, Silicon Valley may be a different story… Related Video Transportation This Motoring Mimic Can Become Any Car Need a Camaro? A Duesenberg? Maybe a Batmobile?

It will be designed and built around the existing museum, which includes the Motown studio with its \"Hitsville U.S.A.\" facade. \nDesigners and architects are collaborating on details of the expanded space. \nThe museum is located in the house where record company founder Berry Gordy launched his cultural and commercial music empire. The label started in 1959 and scores of stars and hits were created before Motown moved to California in 1972. Tags",

      "title": "Ford Will Keep Producing Lincoln MKC in Kentucky; Trump Claims Victory | Tea Party",
      "text": "(Before It's News)\nThis article appeared online at TheNewAmerican.com on Friday, November 18, 2016:\nEmbed from Getty Images\nEarly Thursday evening President-elect Donald Trump tweeted: “Just got a call from my friend Bill Ford, Chairman of Ford, who advised me that he will be keeping the Lincoln plant in Kentucky — no Mexico.” A few minutes later he tweeted an addendum: “I worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky. I owed it to the great State of Kentucky for their confidence in me!” (Trump won Kentucky’s 8 electoral votes by beating Hillary Clinton, 62 percent to 32 percent.)\nThe anti-Trump media jumped all over Trump’s self-proclaimed “victory,” noting in the process that he got some of his facts wrong: The plant was never in jeopardy — just the manufacturing of the company’s low-volume luxury SUV, the Lincoln MKC (pictured above). On Friday morning Ford tweeted back the correction: “Louisville plant wasn’t moving; MKC was. Pres-elect’s econ policy will help boost American competitiveness, keep MKC here.”\nTrump had spent considerable time on the campaign trail attacking Ford’s plan to move jobs to Mexico and threatening that, as president, he would raise tariffs on cars made there as punishment. This would also effectively terminate NAFTA, the so-called North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).\nNow, Bill Ford is Donald Trump’s newest best friend, working together for the “common good.” In a statement to that effect, Ford said, “We are encouraged that President-elect Trump and the new Congress will pursue policies that will improve U.S. competitiveness and make it possible to keep production of this vehicle [the MKC] here in the United States.”\nThis is how business is done in a managed economy, where government interference in the free market is accepted as fact, and where consequently business has to be quick on its feet to stay competitive, or even remain in business. Bill Ford is nothing if not a realist.\nFord had planned to move the building of its MKC automobile to its existing plant in Mexico where wages are estimated to be 80 percent lower than in the United States. That would allow the company to keep all 4,700 workers in its Louisville plant employed by expanding production of its low-cost high-volume Focus automobile. It had done the math before Trump’s surprise victory, and it made sense: like in dollars and cents. Labor costs make up between 10 and 15 percent of the cost of the MKC and moving its production to Mexico would increase the company’s profit margin on it considerably.\nAlong came Trump and his surprise victory last week. That changed the math. Now there was a political element in play: Trump had been attacking Ford for months on the campaign trail and, in January, he would have the power, through the Department of Commerce which resides in the Executive Branch, to inflict punishment by dictating tariffs. Prior to November 8 it was, as far as Ford was concerned, just campaign rhetoric. On November 9, it was real.\nTrump made his point. Ford looked like a winner. As Bill Ford told reporters back in September, “We are everything that [Trump] should be celebrating about this country. We pulled ourselves up by our bootstraps, we paid back our borrowings, we are healthy again, we’ve been adding jobs in the U.S. and we are the largest manufacturer of cars and trucks in the U.S.”\nSome think it’s just a little early for President-elect Trump to be throwing his weight around. Others think Ford is doing what any company operating in a “mixed economy” (i.e., government intervention in the free market) would do: adjusting to the new reality even before it becomes a reality. Ford readjusts its “manufacturer’s suggested retail price” sticker on its luxury MKC a little. And MKC production stays in Kentucky.",

      "text": "DETROIT, MI (AP) — President-elect Donald Trump has a long list of deceptive statements about Ford Motor Co. and the auto industry, and he added to that list this week.\nTrump’s tweet on Thursday asserting that he had dissuaded Ford from moving a Kentucky factory to Mexico was a stretch, at the very least. The company has no intention of moving the plant, and it had already agreed to keep production of one specific model there.\nThroughout the campaign, Trump accused Ford of exporting U.S. jobs south of the border and, in alarming terms, contended that auto jobs are leaving the country in mass. He also misstated the impact of trade agreements on U.S. auto jobs and has threatened to impose a 35 percent tariff on goods imported from Mexico.\nWhile it’s true that Ford and others have spent billions of dollars on assembly and parts plants in Mexico, the industry also has added thousands of U.S. jobs since auto sales recovered from the Great Recession. There aren’t as many jobs at U.S. auto plants as there were a decade ago, but that’s due more to automation than to the free-trade agreements that Trump has criticized.\nHere are how Trump’s statements about Ford and the industry stack up with the facts:\nTRUMP: “Just got a call from my friend Bill Ford, Chairman of Ford, who advised me that he will be keeping the Lincoln plant in Kentucky – no Mexico.”\nTHE FACTS: Ford never had any intention of moving a factory from Kentucky to Mexico. But it did propose shifting production of the Lincoln MKC small SUV from Louisville to Cuautitlan, Mexico. The idea was to free assembly-line space to make more Ford Escapes, which are made on the same line as the MKC. In a deal with the United Auto Workers union, Ford agreed to invest $700 million in the plant and not cut any jobs, since workers would still make Escapes.\nSo, while Trump may have been responsible for keeping production of the MKC in Louisville — Ford wouldn’t say if he directly played a role — there should be little if any impact on the Louisville plant’s 4,700 workers. Ford has sold only 21,000 MKCs so far this year, compared with 258,000 Escapes. Also, Escape sales have been falling since July, so the need for added factory capacity to build more of them isn’t needed.\n___\nTRUMP: “Our jobs are fleeing the country. They’re going to Mexico. They’re going to many other countries. … Ford is leaving … thousands of jobs leaving Michigan, leaving Ohio.”\nTHE FACTS: Trump was referring to Ford’s plans to shift all small-car production to Mexico to take advantage of lower wages. The company announced this year that it would move the Ford Focus and C-Max from suburban Detroit to a new plant south of the border. But the move wouldn’t cost any U.S. jobs. The 3,700 workers at the plant in Wayne, Michigan, that now makes the small cars will stay employed building a new SUV and small pickup truck.\nTrump and his supporters contend the Mexican jobs could have been added in the U.S. if Ford built a new factory here instead of in Mexico. But Ford says it’s nearly impossible to make money building small cars in the U.S., while Mexico’s lower costs of production, including wages, allow the automaker to turn a profit on the vehicles.\nAs for jobs fleeing the U.S., the U.S. auto industry has actually added 300,000 jobs since June 2009, when the recession ended.\n___\nTRUMP: When he becomes president “The auto industry will come roaring back.”\nTHE FACTS: The industry has already roared back from the financial crisis. Total U.S. auto sales reached a record level of 17.5 million last year. They may tail off slightly this year, but sales are expected to stay near the record or even grow during the next several years. The resurgence has benefited both U.S.-based and foreign automakers, many of which have U.S. factories.\n___\nTRUMP: “According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, before NAFTA went into effect, there were 285,000 auto workers in Michigan. Today, that number is only 160,000.”\nTHE FACTS: Michigan actually added jobs after the North American Free Trade Agreement began in 1994, when auto-manufacturing and auto-parts plants employed roughly 280,000 workers. Over the next six years, their ranks increased to 320,000. But the jobs started falling in Michigan as U.S. automakers lost market share, automation increased and the Great Recession hit. Auto employment bottomed out at 95,000 in 2009 and recovered to about 165,000 as of September.",

The figure makes the auto giant and union the lead donors in a recently announced $50 million upgrade that will create a new Ford-branded theater, space for interactive exhibits and a recording studio at the tourist attraction.\n\"We are thrilled to play a role in the next chapter of a global music icon,\" said Joe Hinrichs, president, The Americas, Ford Motor Company. \"The enhanced museum will not only upgrade the visitor experience, it also fits with our commitment to investing in the cultural heritage of Detroit and southeast Michigan.\"\nAs part of the Ford/UAW investment, the expanded Motown Museum will include a new venue to be called the Ford Motor Company Theater, as well as a new interactive activity called the CARaoke Experience that will incorporate music with Ford vehicles. The donation will also fuel educational, music and other programming.\n\"Motown and Ford Motor Company have wide and deeply connected roots,\" said Robin R. Terry, chairwoman and CEO, Motown Museum. \"As two Detroit born brands, they have had -- and continue to have today -- a transformative and profound impact on creativity and innovation around the world.\"\nThe Motown Museum is located in the Hitsville U.S.A. house where record company founder Berry Gordy launched his music empire in 1959. Scores of stars and hits were created there before the label moved to California in 1972.\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.",

Just got a call from my friend Bill Ford, Chairman of Ford, who advised me that he will be keeping the Lincoln plant in Kentucky – no Mexico \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 18, 2016 I worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky. I owed it to the great State of Kentucky for their confidence in me! \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 18, 2016 \nOn Friday the liberal mainstream media attacked Trump over the news. (It’s as if the DNC is writing their headlines now — And if you followed the Wikileaks Podesta email scandal you know they are!) \nThe liberal DNC media said Trump was not responsible for Ford’s change of plans. \nThey are grasping at straws now folks.

      "title": "In Overture, Ford Rethinks Car Plan -- WSJ",
      "text": "By Christina Rogers and John D. Stoll\nOne of the U.S. auto industry's best-known figures extended an olive branch to President-elect Donald Trump, saying the car maker won't move certain production to Mexico -- the latest business leader to thaw tension stemming from concerns about the incoming administration's stance on trade.\nBill Ford, the great-grandson of Henry Ford and chairman of Ford Motor Co., called Mr. Trump on Thursday to tell him the company was reversing course on a plan to eventually relocate Lincoln sport-utility production from Kentucky to a factory south of the U.S. border, the company confirmed.\nThe largely symbolic change of plans signals Ford's willingness to work with Mr. Trump on making U.S. manufacturing more attractive to multinational companies, even as the auto maker sticks with its $1.6 billion construction of a new small-car plant in Mexico.\nMr. Trump overplayed Ford's decision in a tweet about the conversation he posted to his Twitter account Thursday night, suggesting Ford would no longer relocate a Lincoln plant from Louisville to Mexico. The Dearborn, Mich., company only wanted to move one model to Mexico in this case, and it never intended to close the Kentucky plant or cut jobs, according to company and union officials.\nOfficials working on Mr. Trump's transition team didn't respond to requests for comment.\nMr. Ford's outreach reflects a broader move by business leaders to mend fences with the president-elect after a brutal campaign. Following the election, Ford Chief Executive Mark Fields sent a congratulatory letter to Mr. Trump, despite the New York businessman's repeated criticisms of the auto maker's plan to relocate Ford Focus production from Michigan to Mexico.\nOther companies made similar pushes. International Business Machines Corp. CEO Ginni Rometty published an open letter to Mr. Trump this week offering support for his policies, even after the president-elect criticized IBM and other companies for moving U.S. jobs overseas.\nDish Network Corp. Chief Executive Charlie Ergen has said a Trump administration would bring a \"lot of positives for business,\" including infrastructure spending and reduced corporate-tax burdens. Caterpillar Inc., a maker of construction and mining equipment, applauded Mr. Trump's pledge to boost infrastructure spending.\nSome of the outreach has come with a downside. Sneaker maker New Balance Athletic Inc. publicly backed the president-elect's antitrade stance, welcoming Mr. Trump's election as a reprieve from the policies of President Barack Obama. That support, however, incited a social-media backlash, with hundreds of consumers posting that they would throw out their sneakers.\nMr. Trump's complaints concerning Ford reflect broader criticism of the North American Free Trade Agreement, which some blame as the culprit for job losses in manufacturing sectors like automobiles. Mr. Trump has proposed a 35% tariff on autos and other products imported from low-cost countries such as Mexico.\nMr. Fields said earlier this week the tariffs would hurt his industry and the broader economy, but said he and the president-elect share the same objective of boosting the U.S. economy.\nThe tariff \"would be harmful, I think, to the entire industry and the economy and therefore we want to engage in a very productive set of discussions,\" he said. He noted Nafta has increased the interwoven connections shared by auto industries in the U.S., Canada and Mexico.\nMany in the auto industry say untangling the trade pact would be costly and complicated because of the multilayered connections between U.S. and foreign suppliers and assembly points. The tens of thousands of parts that make up any vehicle often come from multiple producers in different countries and travel back and forth across borders several times.\nMore than half the parts in the Ford Focus, for instance, are made outside the U.S. and Canada, including 20% in Mexico. Ford also ships in some of the car's engines from Spain and transmissions from Germany.\nWorries over Mr. Trump's Nafta stance are shared outside the auto industry. Martin Richenhagen, CEO of farm-equipment maker Agco Corp., said he is concerned about Mr. Trump's repeated support for trade protectionism.\n\"That would be a nightmare if we make life difficult for imports and exports,\" Mr. Richenhagen said.\nIn making the Lincoln decision, Ford said it was \"encouraged that President-elect Trump and the new Congress will pursue policies that will improve U.S. competitiveness and make it possible to keep production of this vehicle here in the United States.\"\nFord's change of plans is similar to arrangements it has been making with the United Auto Workers for decades as the union lost members amid perpetual restructuring efforts by Detroit's Big Three.\nThe auto maker had planned to move the Lincoln MKC, a small sport-utility sold in low volumes that shares components with the popular Ford Escape.\nThe factory wasn't in danger of closing or shedding jobs. Rather, Ford was moving MKC production to make room for building more Escape crossovers, the company's second-best selling model.\nStill, keeping the Lincoln output in Kentucky means Ford will make future investments in tooling or other factory enhancements needed to make the MKC in the U.S., rather than reroute that capital to Mexico. And it offers reassurance for its hourly workers, about one-third of whom are estimated to have voted for Mr. Trump, according to preliminary UAW figures.\nEven though Ford builds more than 10 Escapes in Kentucky for every Lincoln that rolls down the assembly line, keeping the MKC nameplate in an American factory is meaningful to the UAW, which has sided with Mr. Trump's Nafta position. Mr. Trump's ability to identify with concerns held by workers in states like Michigan, Pennsylvania and Ohio helped propel him to victory on election day in early November.\nThe UAW appeared reluctant to declare Ford's change in plans a victory. In a joint statement with the company, UAW officials reiterated that moving Lincoln output would have allowed for more Escape production but the company \"has since re-evaluated that plan based on changing business conditions.\"\nFord Escape sales have slumped in recent months and the once-booming U.S. auto market is cooling off, with analysts saying industry sales have already peaked.\nFor the union, retaining production of even the lowest-volume of cars is a priority because it provides a hedge if the market shifts away from one of the other products UAW workers assemble. This is an argument UAW officials have repeatedly made as Ford and other auto makers, including Fiat Chrysler Automobiles and General Motors Co., sink deeper investments into Mexico for the production of vehicles, including less-profitable small cars.\nWrite to Christina Rogers at christina.rogers@wsj.com and John D.

      "title": "UAW, Ford to Meet After Trump's Tweet on Production Plans",
      "text": "Leaders of the United Auto Workers union plan to meet with Ford Motor Co. Friday, after being taken by surprise by a tweet from President-elect Donald Trump disclosing the auto maker had shelved plans to move production of Lincoln sport-utility vehicles from the U.S. to Mexico, people familiar with the matter said.\nMr. Trump wrote in the late-night Twitter posting that he had received a call from Ford Chairman Bill Ford assuring him the U.S. auto maker would keep Lincoln production at a plant in Louisville, Ky.\nWhile the plant builds higher-volume Ford Escapes along with the Lincolns and wasn't actually slated to close, the auto maker confirmed it reversed course on its plan to move a smaller-volume Lincoln SUV production to Mexico at a later date.\nFor the UAW, retaining production of even lower-volume nameplates is a priority, partially because it provides a hedge if the market should shift away from one of the other products UAW workers assemble.\nUnion officials have long railed against the North American Free Trade Agreement, blaming it as a reason for a decline in high-paying auto assembly jobs. UAW President Dennis Williams last week said he was open to working with the incoming administration on reworking that agreement.\nFord continues to plan to separately move a substantial part of its passenger car production from Michigan to a new $1.6 billion facility in Mexico, although that move isn't currently expected to result in employment reduction for the UAW.\nWhile that issue is likely to remain a sticking point between Ford, the UAW and the president-elect, the Lincoln announcement isn't going unnoticed.\nUnion officials only learned about the Lincoln decision and the call between the chairman and president-elect through Mr. Trump's tweet and are meeting with Ford executives to learn more about what transpired between the president-elect and the company in making this decision, according to people briefed on the matter.\nTodd Dunn, president for the union local in Louisville, Ky., said the UAW wasn't aware Ford had plans to move Lincoln output to Mexico. Rather, union members were told \"months ago\" that Ford had committed to building the vehicle at the plant through the 2019 model year. After that, it would move the crossover to another, unspecified plant, to make room for building more Escapes, he said.\nNo job reductions were expected to result from the move and the plant was never in danger of closing, Mr. Dunn added. Ford built roughly 37,000 Lincoln MKC crossovers last year versus 383,000 Escapes, its second best-selling model, according to WardsAuto.com.\n\"Before last night, our plants were secure,\" he said. A Ford spokeswoman confirmed the plan now is to keep the Lincoln output in Kentucky beyond 2019.\nFord routinely meets with UAW officials to debrief them on planned production changes, often telling them well in advance of making such moves public. Mr. Trump was quick to take credit for Ford's change of heart, saying he \"worked hard\" with Bill Ford to keep Lincoln production in the U.S.\nWrite to Christina Rogers at christina.rogers@wsj.com\n(END) 18, 2016 13:55 ET (18:55 ",

      "title": "Ford Confirms It Will Keep Lincoln Production in Kentucky -- Update",
      "text": "By Christina Rogers\nFord Motor Co. Chairman Bill Ford called Donald Trump to tell the president-elect the auto maker won't move production of Lincolns out of Kentucky, a sign the car company aims to work with a new administration on protecting American manufacturing workers.\nMr. Trump, in a tweet posted to his Twitter account late Thursday, said he had \"just got a call from my friend Bill Ford, Chairman of Ford, who advised me that he will be keeping the Lincoln plant in Kentucky -- no Mexico.\" He then added in a second tweet \"I worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky.\"\nThe auto maker confirmed in a statement that production of the Lincoln MKC crossover will remain at its assembly plant in Louisville, Ky. Ford had initially planned to move output of the Lincoln model to another plant to boost production of the Escape, which is built at the same factory. The company didn't say where it had planned to move production of the Lincoln crossover.\nFord communicated that plan to the United Auto Workers in 2015 as part of a broader contract negotiation. The Louisville plant, employing about 4,700 workers, wasn't in danger of closing.\n\"We are encouraged that President-elect Trump and the new Congress will pursue policies that will improve U.S. competitiveness and make it possible to keep production of this vehicle here in the United States,\" the company said.\nMr. Trump campaigned on a pledge to bring U.S. manufacturing jobs back and took aim at Ford's separate plans to move small-car production from Michigan to a new $1.6 billion factory it is building in Mexico. That product, the Focus, is separate from the Lincoln Mr. Trump referred to, and Ford is still planning to move those small cars to Mexico, Chief Executive Mark Fields said earlier this week.\nAs the Republican candidate for president, Mr. Trump proposed a 35% tariff on vehicles or other products built abroad and imported by the U.S. by companies like Ford. Mr. Fields said a tariff would have negative consequences for the broader auto industry and the U.S. economy.\nA spokeswoman for Mr. Trump didn't immediately return a request for comment.\nFord executives, including Mr. Ford, have repeatedly stressed the company's shift in factory output to Mexico won't cost any U.S. jobs and the Michigan factory losing small-car production will eventually get new models to keep the assembly lines running.\nFord says it has invested $12 billion in its U.S. factories over the past five years creating 28,000 jobs.\nMr. Fields told reporters Ford has talked to Mr. Trump's transition team and believes the company can work with the new administration. \"We all share the same objective,\" Mr. Fields said.\nFord's Chief Financial Officer Bob Shanks was also encouraged by Mr. Trump's recent remarks, saying earlier Thursday he believes the president-elect is pursuing \"pro-growth\" policies, including on trade.\nLike many of its rivals, Ford is increasing production of more profitable trucks and sport-utility vehicles in the U.S. while investing to boost output in Mexico for lower-margin small cars.\nMr. Trump has said he would begin renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement that covers Canada, the U.S. and Mexico.\nIf Mexico doesn't agree to improve terms, the U.S. will leave the pact, Mr. Trump said. He blames unfair trade, in particular with Mexico and China, for the loss of millions of factory jobs--a message that resonated with voters in Michigan during the election. Mr. Trump won Michigan, the first Republican candidate to do that since 1988.\nWrite to Christina Rogers at christina.rogers@wsj.com\n(END) 18, 2016 00:43 ET (05:43 ",

      "title": "UAW, Ford to Meet After Trump's Tweets on Production Plans",
      "text": "By Christina Rogers\nLeaders of the United Auto Workers union plan to meet with Ford Motor Co. Friday, after being taken by surprised by a tweet from President-elect Donald Trump disclosing the auto maker had shelved plans to move production of Lincoln sport-utility vehicles from the U.S. to Mexico, people familiar with the matter said.\nMr. Trump wrote in the late-night Twitter posting that he had received a call from Ford Chairman Bill Ford assuring him the U.S. auto maker would keep Lincoln production at a plant in Louisville, Ky.\nWhile the plant builds higher-volume Ford Escapes along with the Lincolns and wasn't actually slated to close, the auto maker confirmed it reversed course on its plan to move a smaller-volume Lincoln SUV production to Mexico at a later date.\nFor the UAW, retaining production of even lower-volume nameplates is a priority, partially because it provides a hedge if the market should shift away from one of the other products UAW workers assemble.\nUnion officials have long railed against the North American Free Trade Agreement, blaming it as a reason for a decline in high-paying auto assembly jobs. UAW President Dennis Williams last week said he was open to working with the incoming administration on reworking that agreement.\nFord continues to plan to separately move a substantial part of its passenger car production from Michigan to a new $1.6 billion facility in Mexico, although that move isn't currently expected to result in employment reduction for the UAW.\nWhile that issue is likely to remain a sticking point between Ford, the UAW and the president-elect, the Lincoln announcement isn't going unnoticed.\nUnion officials only learned about the Lincoln decision and the call between the chairman and president-elect through Mr. Trump's tweet and are meeting with Ford executives to learn more about what transpired between the president-elect and the company in making this decision, according to people briefed on the matter.\nTodd Dunn, president for the union local in Louisville, Ky., said the UAW wasn't aware Ford had plans to move Lincoln output to Mexico. Rather, union members were told \"months ago\" that Ford had committed to building the vehicle at the plant through the 2019 model year. After that, it would move the crossover to another, unspecified plant, to make room for building more Escapes, he said.\nNo job reductions were expected to result from the move and the plant was never in danger of closing, Mr. Dunn added. Ford built roughly 37,000 Lincoln MKC crossovers last year versus 383,000 Escapes, its second best-selling model, according to WardsAuto.com.\n\"Before last night, our plants were secure,\" he said. A Ford spokeswoman confirmed the plan now is to keep the Lincoln output in Kentucky beyond 2019.\nFord routinely meets with UAW officials to debrief them on planned production changes, often telling them well in advance of making such moves public. Mr. Trump was quick to take credit for Ford's change of heart, saying he \"worked hard\" with Bill Ford to keep Lincoln production in the U.S.\nWrite to Christina Rogers at christina.rogers@wsj.com\n(END) 18, 2016 13:05 ET (18:05 ",

      "title": "In Overture, Ford Rethinks Car Plan -- WSJ",
      "text": "By Christina Rogers and John D. Stoll\nOne of the U.S. auto industry's best-known figures extended an olive branch to President-elect Donald Trump, saying the car maker won't move certain production to Mexico -- the latest business leader to thaw tension stemming from concerns about the incoming administration's stance on trade.\nBill Ford, the great-grandson of Henry Ford and chairman of Ford Motor Co., called Mr. Trump on Thursday to tell him the company was reversing course on a plan to eventually relocate Lincoln sport-utility production from Kentucky to a factory south of the U.S. border, the company confirmed.\nThe largely symbolic change of plans signals Ford's willingness to work with Mr. Trump on making U.S. manufacturing more attractive to multinational companies, even as the auto maker sticks with its $1.6 billion construction of a new small-car plant in Mexico.\nMr. Trump overplayed Ford's decision in a tweet about the conversation he posted to his Twitter account Thursday night, suggesting Ford would no longer relocate a Lincoln plant from Louisville to Mexico. The Dearborn, Mich., company only wanted to move one model to Mexico in this case, and it never intended to close the Kentucky plant or cut jobs, according to company and union officials.\nOfficials working on Mr. Trump's transition team didn't respond to requests for comment.\nMr. Ford's outreach reflects a broader move by business leaders to mend fences with the president-elect after a brutal campaign. Following the election, Ford Chief Executive Mark Fields sent a congratulatory letter to Mr. Trump, despite the New York businessman's repeated criticisms of the auto maker's plan to relocate Ford Focus production from Michigan to Mexico.\nOther companies made similar pushes. International Business Machines Corp. CEO Ginni Rometty published an open letter to Mr. Trump this week offering support for his policies, even after the president-elect criticized IBM and other companies for moving U.S. jobs overseas.\nDish Network Corp. Chief Executive Charlie Ergen has said a Trump administration would bring a \"lot of positives for business,\" including infrastructure spending and reduced corporate-tax burdens. Caterpillar Inc., a maker of construction and mining equipment, applauded Mr. Trump's pledge to boost infrastructure spending.\nSome of the outreach has come with a downside. Sneaker maker New Balance Athletic Inc. publicly backed the president-elect's antitrade stance, welcoming Mr. Trump's election as a reprieve from the policies of President Barack Obama. That support, however, incited a social-media backlash, with hundreds of consumers posting that they would throw out their sneakers.\nMr. Trump's complaints concerning Ford reflect broader criticism of the North American Free Trade Agreement, which some blame as the culprit for job losses in manufacturing sectors like automobiles. Mr. Trump has proposed a 35% tariff on autos and other products imported from low-cost countries such as Mexico.\nMr. Fields said earlier this week the tariffs would hurt his industry and the broader economy, but said he and the president-elect share the same objective of boosting the U.S. economy.\nThe tariff \"would be harmful, I think, to the entire industry and the economy and therefore we want to engage in a very productive set of discussions,\" he said. He noted Nafta has increased the interwoven connections shared by auto industries in the U.S., Canada and Mexico.\nMany in the auto industry say untangling the trade pact would be costly and complicated because of the multilayered connections between U.S. and foreign suppliers and assembly points. The tens of thousands of parts that make up any vehicle often come from multiple producers in different countries and travel back and forth across borders several times.\nMore than half the parts in the Ford Focus, for instance, are made outside the U.S. and Canada, including 20% in Mexico. Ford also ships in some of the car's engines from Spain and transmissions from Germany.\nWorries over Mr. Trump's Nafta stance are shared outside the auto industry. Martin Richenhagen, CEO of farm-equipment maker Agco Corp., said he is concerned about Mr. Trump's repeated support for trade protectionism.\n\"That would be a nightmare if we make life difficult for imports and exports,\" Mr. Richenhagen said.\nIn making the Lincoln decision, Ford said it was \"encouraged that President-elect Trump and the new Congress will pursue policies that will improve U.S. competitiveness and make it possible to keep production of this vehicle here in the United States.\"\nFord's change of plans is similar to arrangements it has been making with the United Auto Workers for decades as the union lost members amid perpetual restructuring efforts by Detroit's Big Three.\nThe auto maker had planned to move the Lincoln MKC, a small sport-utility sold in low volumes that shares components with the popular Ford Escape.\nThe factory wasn't in danger of closing or shedding jobs. Rather, Ford was moving MKC production to make room for building more Escape crossovers, the company's second-best selling model.\nStill, keeping the Lincoln output in Kentucky means Ford will make future investments in tooling or other factory enhancements needed to make the MKC in the U.S., rather than reroute that capital to Mexico. And it offers reassurance for its hourly workers, about one-third of whom are estimated to have voted for Mr. Trump, according to preliminary UAW figures.\nEven though Ford builds more than 10 Escapes in Kentucky for every Lincoln that rolls down the assembly line, keeping the MKC nameplate in an American factory is meaningful to the UAW, which has sided with Mr. Trump's Nafta position. Mr. Trump's ability to identify with concerns held by workers in states like Michigan, Pennsylvania and Ohio helped propel him to victory on election day in early November.\nThe UAW appeared reluctant to declare Ford's change in plans a victory. In a joint statement with the company, UAW officials reiterated that moving Lincoln output would have allowed for more Escape production but the company \"has since re-evaluated that plan based on changing business conditions.\"\nFord Escape sales have slumped in recent months and the once-booming U.S. auto market is cooling off, with analysts saying industry sales have already peaked.\nFor the union, retaining production of even the lowest-volume of cars is a priority because it provides a hedge if the market shifts away from one of the other products UAW workers assemble. This is an argument UAW officials have repeatedly made as Ford and other auto makers, including Fiat Chrysler Automobiles and General Motors Co., sink deeper investments into Mexico for the production of vehicles, including less-profitable small cars.\nWrite to Christina Rogers at christina.rogers@wsj.com and John D.

      "title": "Ford's Change on Kentucky Plant Is an Olive Branch to Donald Trump Administration",
      "text": "By Christina Rogers and John D. Stoll\nOne of the U.S. auto industry's best-known figures has extended an olive branch to President-elect Donald Trump by informing him the car maker won't move a small amount of production to Mexico, the latest effort by a business leader to thaw tension stemming from the incoming administration's position on key issues, including global trade.\nBill Ford, the great-grandson of Henry Ford and chairman of Ford Motor Co., called Mr. Trump on Thursday to inform him the company was reversing course on a plan to eventually relocate Lincoln sport-utility production from Kentucky to a factory south of the U.S. border. The auto maker is sticking with its $1.6 billion construction of a new small-car plant in Mexico, but is signaling confidence in its ability to work with Mr. Trump on making U.S. manufacturing more attractive to multinational companies.\nMr. Trump overplayed Ford's decision in a tweet about the conversation he posted to his Twitter account Thursday night, suggesting Ford would no longer relocate a Lincoln plant from Louisville to Mexico. The Dearborn, Mich., company only wanted to move one model to Mexico in this case, and it never intended to close the Kentucky plant or cut jobs, according to company and union officials.\nOfficials working on Mr. Trump's transition team didn't return requests for comment.\nMr. Ford's outreach reflects a broader move by business leaders to mend fences with the president-elect after a brutal campaign. Following the election, Ford Chief Executive Mark Fields sent a congratulatory letter to Mr. Trump even after the New York businessman had repeatedly criticized the auto maker's plan to relocate Ford Focus production from Michigan to Mexico.\nOther companies made similar pushes. International Business Machines Corp. CEO Ginni Rometty published an open letter to Mr. Trump this week offering support for his policies, even after the president-elect criticized IBM and other companies for moving U.S. jobs overseas.\nDish Network Corp. Chief Executive Charlie Ergen has said a Trump administration would bring a \"lot of positives for business,\" including infrastructure spending and reduced corporate-tax burdens. Caterpillar Inc., a maker of construction and mining equipment, applauded Mr. Trump's pledge to boost infrastructure spending.\nSome of the outreach has come with a downside.\nSneaker maker New Balance Athletic Inc. publicly backed the president-elect's antitrade stance, welcoming Mr. Trump's election as a reprieve from the policies of President Barack Obama. New Balance's position, however, has incited a social media backlash, with hundreds of consumers posting that they'd throw out their sneakers.\nMr. Trump's complaints concerning Ford reflect broader criticism of the North American Free Trade Agreement, which some blame as the culprit for job loss in manufacturing sectors like automobiles. Mr. Trump has proposed a 35% tariff on autos and other products imported from low-cost countries such as Mexico. Mr. Fields said earlier this week that policy would be bad for his industry and the broader economy, but insisted he and the president-elect share the same objective of boosting the U.S. economy.\nIn making the Lincoln decision, Ford said it was \"encouraged that President-elect Trump and the new Congress will pursue policies that will improve U.S. competitiveness and make it possible to keep production of this vehicle here in the United States.\"\nFord's change of plans is largely symbolic and is similar to arrangements it has been making with the United Auto Workers for decades as the union lost members amid perpetual restructuring efforts by Detroit's Big Three.\nThe auto maker had planned to move the Lincoln MKC, a small sport-utility sold in low volumes that shares components with the popular Ford Escape.\nThe factory wasn't in danger of closing or shedding jobs. Rather, Ford was moving MKC production to make room for building more Escape crossovers, the company's second-best selling model.\nStill, keeping the Lincoln output in Kentucky means Ford will make future investments in tooling or other factory enhancements needed to make the MKC in the U.S. rather than reroute that capital to Mexico. And it is a win for its hourly workers, about one-third of whom are estimated to have voted for Mr. Trump, according to preliminary UAW figures.\nEven though Ford builds more than 10 Escapes in Kentucky for every Lincoln that rolls down the assembly line, keeping the MKC nameplate in an American factory is meaningful to the UAW, which has sided with Mr. Trump's Nafta position. Mr. Trump's ability to identify with concerns held by workers in states like Michigan, Pennsylvania or Ohio helped propel him to victory in early November.\nUAW officials were slated to meet with Ford executives Friday to discuss the change in plans.\nFor the union, retaining production of even the lowest-volume of cars is a priority because it provides a hedge if the market should shift away from one of the other products UAW workers assemble. This is an argument UAW officials have repeatedly made as Ford and other auto makers, including Fiat Chrysler Automobiles and General Motors Co., sink deeper investments into Mexico for the production of vehicles, including less profitable small cars.\nWrite to Christina Rogers at christina.rogers@wsj.com and John D.

      "text": "Yahoo / Fox / NASCAR: Quick Picks Heading into qualifying for Sunday's season finale at Homestead-Miami Speedway, all the focus was on the four drivers who will be competing for the championship. By the time qualifying was over, it was Kevin Harvick who had earned the headlines. Harvick grabbed the pole for the Ford EcoBoost 400 with a lap of 177.637 mph in the final round, leaving little doubt that he isn't going to give up just because he won't be running for the title. Brad Keselowski will join Harvick on the front row, and Ryan Newman, Denny Hamlin, and Chase Elliott rounded out the top five. Kyle Busch was the top qualifier among the title contenders. He will start ninth Sunday, and all four championship drivers will start in the top 15. Starting up front has proven to be a huge advantage when it comes to winning at Homestead. Of the 17 Cup races at the track, ten have been won from a top-five starting spot, including three straight. Meanwhile, 12 races have been won from a top 10 starting spot and just two have been won by a driver starting outside the top 20. There has also been a strong correlation with starting up front and leading laps. Over the last three races here, nine drivers have led 40-plus laps, and eight of those drivers have started eighth or better. More importantly, two drivers have led more than 100 laps during that span, and both started from the pole. Now that the starting lineup for the season finale is locked in, it's time to take a closer look at the drivers to target for your DFS NASCAR lineups. You can check out the Ford EcoBoost 400 Sunday at 3:00 p.m. ET on NBC. Must-Own Drivers Kevin Harvick ($10,700) He may not be competing for the title this weekend, but that doesn't mean Harvick can't cap the season with a win. His 6.1 average finish in the last ten races at Homestead is the best in the series, and he has finished first and second in the last two races here, leading 40-plus laps in both events. Harvick starts on the pole, and two of the last three pole-sitters at Homestead have led 100-plus laps. He could cap a strong 2016 season by being the top scorer this weekend. Martin Truex Jr. ($10,000) Truex was eliminated from the Chase early, but that doesn't change the fact that he has been one of the best drivers at 1.5-mile tracks all year, leading more laps than any other driver. After qualifying sixth, he is in a good position to add to that total Sunday, especially at a Homestead track where he owns the second-best average finish over the last ten races. Carl Edwards ($9,700) To be honest, none of the four title contenders look like overwhelming favorites coming out of qualifying, but history says that at least a couple of them will be among the top performers Sunday. Edwards starts in the top 10, and the two-time Homestead winner has led more laps than any other driver in the last ten races here, leading more than 100 laps three times. Among the championship drivers, he looks like the best bet to provide a big point total. Value Plays Kyle Larson ($8,800) Larson's 24th-place run in qualifying is nothing new at Homestead. He has now qualified 20th or worse in all four starts at the track, but he has yet to finish outside the top 15. Last year, he started 23rd and finished fifth, and Larson could be in line for a similar charge to the front this weekend. Denny Hamlin ($8,600) He is a two-time winner at Homestead, and Hamlin has cracked the top 10 in each of his last three races at the track. Qualifying fourth puts him in a position to score some points in the laps led and fastest laps run categories, and at this price, he should be a solid option based on finishing position alone. Kasey Kahne ($8,200) He has struggled in qualifying at 1.5-mile tracks throughout the Chase, and the trend continued with a 29th-place run at Homestead. Of course, the qualifying issues haven't carried over to race day, and he has cracked the top 10 in all four races at 1.5-mile tracks during the playoffs, logging a +13.5 average place differential. Look for Kahne to be one of the biggest movers and an absolute bargain as a mid-priced play. Alex Bowman ($7,400) While I don't expect Bowman to be the top scorer like he was last weekend at Phoenix, he should still post a solid score after qualifying 19th. He has been a top 10 driver at the 1.5-mile tracks since jumping into the No. 88, so he has a great chance to provide 40-plus fantasy points once place differential is factored in. Ty Dillon ($6,600) Fantasy owners couldn't have asked for a better scenario in qualifying. Dillon will start 35th, giving him almost nothing to lose and plenty to gain in the place differential category. He has been able to run in and around the top 20 all year, so he is shaping up to be a must-have driver in cash games this weekend. Paul Menard ($6,500) Menard's up-and-down record at Homestead makes him a bit of a gamble, but he has the upside through place differential that you look for in a sleeper. He will start 28th, but he has two finishes of 11th or better in his last four starts at Homestead, including a fourth-place run in 2014. Chris Buescher ($6,300) On the heels of a lackluster 27th-place qualifying effort, Buescher should be one of the safest sources of cap relief for fantasy owners. He has finished 21st or better in each of the last three races at 1.5-mile ovals, gaining at least nine spots in all three races. He is in perfect position to have a similar performance this weekend. Sleeper Specials Danica Patrick ($6,100) She has had decent results at Homestead, cracking the top 25 in all three career starts and compiling a 20.7 average finish. After qualifying 30th, a place differential of +10 or so isn't out of the question. She could end up being a cheap source of 30-plus fantasy points. Regan Smith ($5,300) There is no such thing as a sure thing when you drop down to this price range, but Smith's 35th-place starting spot at least limits his risk. He isn't going to destroy your lineup with a negative score, and he has a chance to finish with a modest point total. Smith has cracked the top 30 in the last three races at 1.5-mile tracks, finishing 26th or better twice. 2016 Ford EcoBoost 400 Starting Lineup Pos.",

      "text": "ANALYSIS-Under pressure on U.S. jobs, Ford tries new gambit with Trump Updated: November 18, 2016 — 7:13 PM EST Share \n(Adds details on Ford India investment) \nBy David Shepardson \nWASHINGTON, Nov 18 (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co, one of Donald Trump's prime corporate targets on the campaign trail, offered the President-elect a chance to claim a victory late on Thursday by informing him it would not shift production of a Lincoln sport utility vehicle to Mexico from Kentucky. \nTrump jumped at the chance, claiming in a tweet that he had \"worked hard\" with Ford Executive Chairman Bill Ford Jr. to keep the plant in Kentucky, even though Ford had never considered moving the whole factory south of the border. \nIn letting Trump claim a victory, Ford made what appeared to be a calculated, public appeal to the next president in an attempt to soothe concerns about outsourcing jobs and to gain some leverage with the new administration as the automaker pushes for favorable policy changes in Congress. \n\"Ford is not going to make a decision on a purely political basis,\" said Kristin Dziczek, director of industry, labor and economics at the Center for Automotive Research in Michigan. \n\"They are going to make a decision that makes business sense, economic sense and if it happens to align with political goals, that's great,\" she said. \nThe No. 2 automaker in the United States is not the only company in Trump's crosshairs working out how to deal with the new political reality in Washington. \nApple Inc, criticized by Trump for not building products in the United States, is studying the possibility of moving iPhone production to the United States, Japanese news service Nikkei reported on Thursday. \nApple did not reply to a request for comment on Friday. \nJOBS = VOTES \nTrump campaigned heavily on bringing jobs to the United States and attacking companies such as Ford that plan to take some production overseas, a message that resonated in the economically ravaged center of the country. \nFord gave Trump plenty of ammunition, confirming in September that all of its remaining small-car production in the United States, at its facility in Wayne, Michigan, would go to lower-cost Mexico by 2019. \nFord Chief Executive Mark Fields said no plants would be closed as a result, and no U.S. jobs would be lost as capacity at the Wayne plant would be taken up by two new models. \nThe Mexico plans remain in place, despite the fact that Trump vowed on the campaign trail to stop Ford opening a new plant in that country and promised to slap 35 percent tariffs on any Ford vehicles made there. \nFord went further this month, announcing on Election Day a new $195 million investment in India to add 3,000 jobs over the next five years in a technology and business center in Chennai. Ford said this week it would import its Ford EcoSport built in India to the United States. Trump has not made any public comment on that plan. \nBOTH CLAIM VICTORY \nOn Thursday, Ford said it had been reviewing where to build the Lincoln MKC, just one vehicle built at the Louisville assembly plant, but had decided to keep it in Kentucky. \nAs such, nothing changed, but letting Trump announce the decision gave him the opportunity to claim he saved U.S. jobs and cast Ford as a patriotic manufacturer. \n\"Both sides will claim a certain level of victory because nobody wants a significant negative impact on the industry,\" said Dave Cole, chairman emeritus of the Center for Automotive Research. \nIt was unclear how many, if any, jobs were actually saved by the decision. Ford decided last year to move MKC production by 2019, on the assumption that production of the Ford Escape, a similar vehicle made in the same plant, would grow. But recently Escape demand has slumped, which may have prompted Ford to reconsider. \nAccording to Cole, Ford's olive branch to Trump was a clear indication that it needs help from the next administration as it faces a host of issues from fuel economy standards and the rise of autonomous vehicles to trade and currency. \nCole said Trump, who boasts about his dealmaking skills, may choose to focus on bargaining with companies he has targeted - even if only for small concessions - rather than pursue more punitive measures such as tariffs, which would take time to implement and potentially damage the economy. \nFord nodded to those wider issues in a statement on Friday, saying it was encouraged that Trump's economic policies \"will help improve U.S. competitiveness.\" \nFord, like other global U.S. corporations, agrees with key aspects of Trump's economic plans. It has called for U.S. tax reform and raised concerns about the costs of federal regulations. Ford also shares Trump's concerns about currency manipulation. (Editing by Bill Rigby) More Coverage ",

It will be designed and built around the existing museum, which includes the Motown studio with its \"Hitsville U.S.A.\" facade. \nDesigners and architects are collaborating on details of the expanded space. \nThe museum is located in the house where record company founder Berry Gordy launched his cultural and commercial music empire. The label started in 1959 and scores of stars and hits were created before Motown moved to California in 1972. Published: ",

      "text": "Home > Transport Under pressure on US jobs, Ford tries new gambit with Trump Ford Motor Co, one of Donald Trump's prime corporate targets on the campaign trail, offered the President-elect a chance to claim a victory late on Thursday by informing him it would not shift production of a Lincoln sport utility vehicle to Mexico from Kentucky. PHOTO: AFP Nov 19, 2016 12:36 PM \n[WASHINGTON] Ford Motor Co, one of Donald Trump's prime corporate targets on the campaign trail, offered the President-elect a chance to claim a victory late on Thursday by informing him it would not shift production of a Lincoln sport utility vehicle to Mexico from Kentucky. \nMr Trump jumped at the chance, claiming in a tweet that he had \"worked hard\" with Ford executive chairman Bill Ford Jr to keep the plant in Kentucky, even though Ford had never considered moving the whole factory south of the border. \nIn letting Mr Trump claim a victory, Ford made what appeared to be a calculated, public appeal to the next president in an attempt to soothe concerns about outsourcing jobs and to gain some leverage with the new administration as the automaker pushes for favorable policy changes in Congress. \n\"Ford is not going to make a decision on a purely political basis,\" said Kristin Dziczek, director of industry, labour and economics at the Center for Automotive Research in Michigan. \n\"They are going to make a decision that makes business sense, economic sense and if it happens to align with political goals, that's great,\" she said. \nThe No 2 automaker in the United States is not the only company in Mr Trump's crosshairs working out how to deal with the new political reality in Washington. \nApple Inc, criticised by Trump for not building products in the United States, is studying the possibility of moving iPhone production to the United States, Japanese news service Nikkei reported on Thursday. \nApple did not reply to a request for comment on Friday. \nMr Trump campaigned heavily on bringing jobs to the United States and attacking companies such as Ford that plan to take some production overseas, a message that resonated in the economically ravaged center of the country. \nFord gave Mr Trump plenty of ammunition, confirming in September that all of its remaining small-car production in the United States, at its facility in Wayne, Michigan, would go to lower-cost Mexico by 2019. \nFord chief executive Mark Fields said no plants would be closed as a result, and no US jobs would be lost as capacity at the Wayne plant would be taken up by two new models. \nThe Mexico plans remain in place, despite the fact that Mr Trump vowed on the campaign trail to stop Ford opening a new plant in that country and promised to slap 35 per cent tariffs on any Ford vehicles made there. \nFord went further this month, announcing on Election Day a new US$195 million investment in India to add 3,000 jobs over the next five years in a technology and business center in Chennai. Ford said this week it would import its Ford EcoSport built in India to the United States. Mr Trump has not made any public comment on that plan. \nOn Thursday, Ford said it had been reviewing where to build the Lincoln MKC, just one vehicle built at the Louisville assembly plant, but had decided to keep it in Kentucky. \nAs such, nothing changed, but letting Mr Trump announce the decision gave him the opportunity to claim he saved US jobs and cast Ford as a patriotic manufacturer. \n\"Both sides will claim a certain level of victory because nobody wants a significant negative impact on the industry,\"said Dave Cole, chairman emeritus of the Center for Automotive Research. \nIt was unclear how many, if any, jobs were actually saved by the decision. Ford decided last year to move MKC production by 2019, on the assumption that production of the Ford Escape, a similar vehicle made in the same plant, would grow. But recently Escape demand has slumped, which may have prompted Ford to reconsider. \nAccording to Mr Cole, Ford's olive branch to Mr Trump was a clear indication that it needs help from the next administration as it faces a host of issues from fuel economy standards and the rise of autonomous vehicles to trade and currency. \nMr Cole said Mr Trump, who boasts about his dealmaking skills, may choose to focus on bargaining with companies he has targeted - even if only for small concessions - rather than pursue more punitive measures such as tariffs, which would take time to implement and potentially damage the economy. \nFord nodded to those wider issues in a statement on Friday, saying it was encouraged that Mr Trump's economic policies \"will help improve US competitiveness.\" \nFord, like other global US corporations, agrees with key aspects of Mr Trump's economic plans. It has called for US tax reform and raised concerns about the costs of federal regulations. Ford also shares Mr Trump's concerns about currency manipulation. \nREUTERS ",

      "text": "New York (AFP) - Ford announced on Friday it will keep producing an SUV model in Kentucky, rather than move it to Mexico, in a decision overplayed by President-elect Donald Trump who claimed he had saved an entire plant from closure. Trump repeatedly took aim at Ford and other groups during the White House campaign for moving production overseas in search of cheap labor -- and Thursday night he announced the firm's U-turn as a personal victory.\n\"Just got a call from my friend Bill Ford, Chairman of Ford, who advised me that he will be keeping the Lincoln plant in Kentucky - no Mexico,\" Trump tweeted.\n\"I worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky. I owed it to the great State of Kentucky for their confidence in me!\" added the Republican -- who won 62.5 percent of that state's popular vote.\nTrump's tweets were initially met with derision since Ford had not made public any plans to shift production from Lincoln to Mexico.\nFord on Friday confirmed there was some substance to the claims.\nUnder last year's contract agreement with the powerful United Automobile Workers union, Ford indeed made plans to move production of the Lincoln MKC out of Louisville to make room for expanded production of its Escape model. The Kentucky plant produces both small SUVs.\nThe company said in a statement, \"Today, we confirmed with the President-elect that our small Lincoln utility vehicle made at the Louisville Assembly Plant will stay in Kentucky.\"\n\"Cuautitlan plant in Mexico was likely the plant for MKC,\" Ford spokeswoman Christin Baker told AFP.\nBut the billionaire appears to have significantly overstated the impact of the decision -- on several accounts.\n- No impact on jobs -\nWhile Ford confirmed that it was indeed considering moving the one model to Mexico, it certainly had no intention of shuttering the Louisville, Kentucky plant.\nIn addition, the decision will have no impact on jobs.\nBaker said that employment at the Louisville plant would have held steady regardless of any production changes, in accordance with the four-year union agreement.\nAccording to The Wall Street Journal, the automaker has been in contact with Trump's transition team since his election, and saw the Lincoln move as a relatively painless way to hand him a victory even before he moves into the White House.\nBut the reversal has no impact on Ford's wider decision -- confirmed earlier this week -- to move production of the Focus to Mexico from Michigan, a state Trump narrowly won in last week's election.\nFord already produces the Lincoln MKZ sedan in Hermosillo, Mexico, and in early April announced a $1.6 billion investment in a new site in the country.\n- Rhetoric swung votes -\nOne of the main themes of Trump's campaign was to bring back manufacturing jobs that American companies had moved overseas in search of cheap labor. Ford and the IT giant Apple were his favorite targets for criticism for their overseas operations.\nTrump even threatened to impose a 35 percent punitive import duty on cars produced in Mexico, and to renegotiate the 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).\nHis rhetoric seems to have resonated since several states where the auto industry is strongly represented and that traditionally voted Democratic, such as Michigan and Wisconsin, voted for Trump, tipping the election in his favor.\nFord said of its decision on Kentucky, \"We are encouraged that President-elect Trump and the new Congress will pursue policies that will improve US competitiveness and make it possible to keep production of this vehicle here in the United States.\"\nThe company also defended its record, saying it employs more US auto workers and produces more American-made vehicles than any other firm, has invested $12 billion in US plants in the past five years and created nearly 28,000 US jobs.\n\"We continue to engage with President-elect Trump's team -- and the new Congress -- as they shape the policy agenda for 2017. We have shared our commitment to continue investing in the US and creating American jobs,\" Ford said.",

      "text": "Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window) Ford (AP Photo/Jae C. Hong, File) \nDETROIT (AP) — President-elect Donald Trump claimed Thursday that he convinced the chairman of Ford Motor Co. not to move an assembly plant from Kentucky to Mexico. But Ford never intended to move the plant, just production of one of the vehicles it makes. \nTrump said in a tweet that Bill Ford, the company’s executive chairman, telephoned him with the news that a “Lincoln plant” would stay in Louisville. Instead Ford decided to keep production of the Lincoln MKC small SUV at the Louisville Assembly Plant. Ford had previously said it would move production of the MKC out of the plant in order to build more Ford Escapes there. \nA factory in Cuautitlan, Mexico, was likely to get the MKC. Under a contract negotiated last year with the United Auto Workers, Ford agreed to invest $700 million in the Louisville plant in return for moving the MKC production. Because Escape production would increase, no Louisville jobs would be lost. \nIt’s possible the decision to keep the MKC in Kentucky was made before the election, because Escape sales have been falling since July and additional production capacity in Louisville may not be needed. Ford spokeswoman Christin Baker said she didn’t know when that decision was made or if Trump had any impact on it. \n“I worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky. I owed it to the great State of Kentucky for their confidence in me!,” Trump said in the tweet claiming credit for Ford’s decision. \nFord Motor Co. and Trump have engaged in a yearlong feud over the automaker’s plans to move production south of the border. The company plans to shift small-car production from suburban Detroit to Mexico to improve profitability of the lower-priced cars. CEO Mark Fields said Tuesday that the presidential election didn’t change the company’s plan. \nTrump wants to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement and has called for a 35 percent tariff on goods shipped from Mexico in an effort to preserve U.S. manufacturing jobs. \nFord plans to move production of the Focus and C-Max small cars to Mexico from a plant in Wayne, Michigan. But jobs at the Wayne plant would be preserved because it’s getting a new SUV and small pickup truck. \nBill Ford met with Trump during the summer and spoke with him on Thursday, Baker said. \n“We are encouraged that President-elect Trump and the new Congress will pursue policies that will improve U.S. competitiveness and make it possible to keep production of this vehicle here in the United States,” she said in an e-mail.

The decision was confirmed on Thursday night to AutomotiveNews , and comes after the Michigan-based giant previously considered shifting it from the Louisville Assembly Plant to Mexico, for the next generation, once the UAW deal expires in 2019. Ford's Global Manufacturing and Labor Communications Manager said that the automaker \" engaged \" with \" Trump's team and the new congress \" to shape up their \" policy agenda for 2017 \". \" We have shared our commitment to continue investing in the US and creating American Jobs - building on the $12 billion we have invested in our US plants and the nearly 28,000 US jobs Ford has created in the past five years .\" The US President-elect Donald Trump has confirmed receiving a phone call from \" friend \" Bill Ford, the car company's Chairman, who told him that production will be kept \" in Kentucky - no Mexico \". Trump has apparently taken credit for this decision, believing that he was behind it , according to a different tweet, posted shortly after. \" I worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky. I owed it to the great State of Kentucky for their confidence in me! \" Ford has yet to comment whether Donald Trump had a role in this agreement.

By Samuel Reiman Nov 19, 2016 at 1:56p ET 0Shares \nFord reset a Guinness World Record at Homestead-Miami Speedway in Homestead, Florida on Saturday as part of the Ford Championship Weekend. \nUsing the all-new Ford F-450 Super Duty, Ford towed a 4,124 square foot (45 x 92 feet) American flag four laps around the 1.5-mile Homestead-Miami Speedway early in the morning, achieving the record for the World’s Largest Flag to be Pulled by a Moving Vehicle. An encore performance will be put on as part of the pre-race festivities ahead of the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series finale on Sunday. true Ford Super Duty claims Guinness World Record pulling 4,124 sq. ft. U.S. flag @HomesteadMiami #FordChampWknd @GWR #TorqueMatters pic.twitter.com/YNTpujEfEc — Ford Performance (@FordPerformance) November 19, 2016 \nThe record had previously been held by Chevrolet, which towed a 40 by 80-foot flag at Texas Motor Speedway back in September. \n“At Ford and with Ford trucks in particular we are used to being number one,” said Doug Scott, Ford Truck Group Marketing Manager. “Towing the largest banner here today and setting the Guinness World Record in the category certainly fits with our DNA and what we are all about when we talk about Ford trucks and their towing power.” \nTo set the record, the truck has to pull the flag 328 feet along without it touching the ground. Ford managed 360 feet, and then continued around the circuit for four laps. Ford credits the truck’s 6.7-liter Power Stroke turbo diesel V8, which produces 925 lb.-ft of torque and 440 horsepower, for completing the stunt. Forty-five-foot riggings were constructed to accommodate the flag and a team of 20 people helped launch and retrieve the flag, ensuring it didn’t touch the ground. \nThe F-450 Super Duty delivers maximum gooseneck towing of 32,500 pounds, 27,500-pounds of fifth-wheel towing and 21,000 pounds conventional towing, with a maximum payload rating of 7,630 pounds.

      "text": "Daniel Strohl on at 8:00 am Share \nHackaday, which normally focuses on Arduinos and other hardware hacking projects, recently examined the Lotus Seven and decreed it one of the most hackable cars . It’s always encouraging when the DIY/Maker movement discovers hot rodding. \n* Henry Ford might have been against replacing the four-cylinder engine in his mass-appeal cars during the Twenties, but that didn’t mean he stopped experimenting with alternative engine configurations, as we can see from Mac’s Motor City Garage’s recent look at the X-8 experimental engine that Ford tinkered with. \n* Here in the States, we’ve seen plenty of rebadging disasters, and it seems that scourge is just as bad if not worse in Australia. The Garage of Awesome recently ran down a few of the more egregious examples . \n* Usually, a Ferrari engine swap becomes a car’s most noteworthy feature. Not so with the Zlatko Cosmopolit , which, well, was certainly different. \n* Finally, for those who think that Rambler pioneered in-car sleeping, an entry in The Old Motor’s recent Nothing New Under the Sun series points out an early predecessor.",
