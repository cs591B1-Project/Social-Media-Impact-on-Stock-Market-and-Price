      "text": "View Comments Mention a Big Mac and anyone would know what it is. The burger that went on to become one of the most popular fast foods in the world was created by Michael \"Jim\" Delligatti, a McDonald's franchisee. “I would never have dreamed that my creation would turn into a piece of Americana,” Delligatti once said about his two-tiered burger created 49 years ago. The creator who ran his restaurant in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania was said to have eaten at least one Big Mac every week for decades. But he’s not the only one – worldwide, McDonald's sells 900 million Big Macs a year. The fast food joint today have announced the creator had sadly passed away at 98 years of age, at his Pittsburgh home on Monday. But what’s certain is that he will leave a legacy through his seven-ingredient burger, concocted with his \"special sauce.\" The burger – two all-beef patties, special sauce, lettuce, cheese, pickles, onions on a sesame seed bun – is now available in 100 countries – and McDonald's hasn't changed its recipe since 1967. When asked why he named his creation the Big Mac, Delegatti’s son said his father replied because “Big Mac sounded too funny”. Delligatti was also one of McDonald's largest franchise holders, owning 48 restaurants. \"Jim was a legendary franchisee within McDonald's system who made a lasting impression on our brand,\" McDonald's said in a statement. Meanwhile on Twitter, many have also called Delligatti a \"legend\" and thanked him for his creation. Today, we celebrate the 98 inspirational years of Big Mac inventor, Michael \"Jim\" Delligatti. Jim, we thank and will forever remember you. pic.twitter.com/wmEFrmazdn ",

Puskar FILE - In this Aug. 21, 2008, file photo, Big Mac creator Michael \"Jim\" Delligatti attends his 90th birthday party in Canonsburg, Pa. Delligatti, the Pittsburgh-area McDonald's franchisee who created the Big Mac in 1967, has died. He was 98. (AP Photo/Gene J. Puskar, File) By JOE MANDAK ASSOCIATED PRESS \nPITTSBURGH — You probably don’t know his name, but you’ve almost certainly devoured his creation: two all-beef patties, special sauce, lettuce, cheese, pickles, onions, on a sesame seed bun. \nMichael James “Jim” Delligatti, the McDonald’s franchisee who created the Big Mac nearly 50 years ago and saw it become perhaps the best-known fast-food sandwich in the world, died Monday at home in Pittsburgh. Delligatti, who according to his son ate at least one 540-calorie Big Mac a week for decades, was 98. \nDelligatti’s franchise was based in Uniontown, not far from Pittsburgh, when he invented the chain’s signature burger in 1967 after deciding customers wanted a bigger sandwich. Demand exploded as Delligatti’s sandwich spread to the rest of his 47 stores in Pennsylvania and was added to the chain’s national menu in 1968. \n“He was often asked why he named it the Big Mac, and he said because Big Mc sounded too funny,” his son Michael Delligatti said. \nHowever, McDonald’s in 1985 honored Esther Glickstein Rose with coming up for a name for the burger and presented her with a plaque etched with a likeness of the best-selling sandwich and french fries between the Golden Arches. \nShe was a 21-year-old secretary for the company’s advertising department in 1967 when, the story goes, a harried executive dashing to a board meeting asked her for a name nomination. \nJim Delligatti’s family disputes that Rose came up with the idea. The company didn’t immediately clear up the dispute Wednesday. \nDelligatti told The Associated Press in 2006 that McDonald’s resisted the idea at first because its simple lineup of hamburgers, cheeseburgers, fries and shakes was selling well. \n“They figured, why go to something else if (the original menu) was working so well?” Delligatti said then. \nMcDonald’s has sold billions of Big Macs since then, in more than 100 countries. When the burger turned 40, McDonald’s estimated it was selling 550 million Big Macs a year, or roughly 17 every second. Delligatti received no payment or royalties for coming up with the burger, the company said. \n“Delligatti was a legendary franchisee within McDonald’s system who made a lasting impression on our brand,” the Oak Brook, Illinois-based company said Wednesday in a statement. The Big Mac “has become an iconic sandwich enjoyed by many around the world.” \nAnn Dugan, a former assistant dean of the University of Pittsburgh’s Katz School of Business and an expert on business franchises, said Jim Delligatti’s genius was simple: He listened to customers who wanted a bigger burger. \n“In franchising, there’s always this set playbook and you have to follow it. Jim saw an opportunity to go outside the playbook because he knew the customer,” Dugan said. “He persevered and (McDonald’s) listened, and the rest is history.” \nDelligatti headed M&J Management, a four-generation family business and McDonald’s franchise organization, for more than 60 years. He opened his first McDonald’s in Pittsburgh’s North Hills suburbs in 1957. In 1979, he co-founded Pittsburgh’s Ronald McDonald House, then the seventh such facility in the country, where families can stay when children travel to Pittsburgh for life-saving medical care, and he was involved in several other charities. \nDelligatti also helped introduce breakfast service at McDonald’s, developing the hotcakes and sausage meal to feed hungry steelworkers on their way home from overnight shifts in the mills, his family said. \nIn addition to his two sons, Jim Delligatti is survived by his wife, Ellie, five grandchildren and eight great-grandchildren. \nThe Devlin Funeral Home near Pittsburgh is handling visitation Thursday and Friday. Delligatti’s funeral will be held Saturday at St. Joseph’s Parish in O’Hara Township. TAGS:",

REUTERS/Toshiyuki Aizawa/File Photo 1/2 Japanese teenagers enjoy McDonald's Big Macs in Tokyo December 24, 2003. REUTERS/Eriko Sugita/File Photo 2/2 \nThe man behind one of the most recognizable fast-food sandwiches, McDonald's Big Mac, died this week at age 98. \nMichael James Delligatti invented the Big Mac - two beef patties on a hamburger bun - which debuted at a McDonald's restaurant in Uniontown, Pennsylvania, in 1967. \nMcDonald's tweeted a message on Wednesday celebrating Delligatti's contribution to the fast-food company where he was a franchisee. \n\"Today, we celebrate the 98 inspirational years of Big Mac inventor, Michael \"Jim\" Delligatti. Jim, we thank and will forever remember you\", the company said. \nU.S. media reported that Delligatti died at his Pennsylvania home on Monday. \nIn a 2007 interview with Reuters, Delligatti said it took two years to convince McDonald's that the Big Mac was a good idea. \n\"I felt that we needed a big sandwich,\" he said. \"But you couldn't do anything unless they gave you permission.\" \nThe contents of the sandwich, immortalized by the popular jingle \"two-all-beef-patties-special-sauce-lettuce-cheese-pickles-onions-on-a-sesame-seed-bun\" are generally the same worldwide, although prices and nutrition value varies. \nThe U.S. version of the Big Mac contains about 540 calories, 28 grams of fat and 25 grams of protein, according to the McDonald's website. \nOver the years the Big Mac's ubiquity has come to mirror that of the Golden Arches itself. It is used to track the value of foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar in a \"Big Mac Index\" published by The Economist magazine. \n(Reporting by Julie Noce; Editing by Darren Schuettler) Next In U.S. U.S. veterans to form human shield at Dakota pipeline protest \nCANNON BALL, N.D. More than 2,000 U.S. military veterans plan to form a human shield to protect protesters of a pipeline project near a Native American reservation in North Dakota, organizers said, just ahead of a federal deadline for activists to leave the camp they have been occupying.",

A short history of his iconic creation: https://t.co/6nDSnQ9ZVa — Wall Street Journal (@WSJ) November 30, 2016 \n\nHERE'S MORE! \nHere's A Story WTAE Did On Jim A Few Years Back... Mike Frazer - I was born in Brooklyn, NY (Home of Vinnie Barbarino and The Sweathogs!) and grew up on Long Island. I graduated from the State University of New York at Oswego about the same time that the school's most famous Alum Al Roker from The Today Show did. (In fact, it was Al who helped me to audition at the College Radio Station!)From there, I've been \"up and down the dial\" in Syracuse, Baltimore and Philadelphia. I've happily cheered on the Black and Gold for the past 27 years...a real rarity in the radio business!Over the course of my career I’ve been heard on radio stations throughout the country, as part of the iHeartradio Premium Choice Talent Team. I’ve also had the pleasure of hosting many Music Concerts, and am proud to serve as the official voice of the popular “My Music” Concert Series featured on PBS.My wonderful wife and I live in the Eastern Suburbs, with our two fantastic \"kids\", Chip and Shelby(our spoiled, lovable pups!)I’m also “Eagle Scout” who LOVES Pittsburgh, and ALL the music that 3WS plays…which works out REALLY well!So…LIFE IS GOOD!

      "title": "Creator of McDonald’s flagship sandwich, the Big Mac, dies",
      "text": "By JOE MANDAK - 11/30/16 2:07 PM \nPITTSBURGH — You probably don’t know his name, but you’ve almost certainly devoured his creation: two all-beef patties, special sauce, lettuce, cheese, pickles, onions, on a sesame seed bun. \nMichael James “Jim” Delligatti, the McDonald’s franchisee who created the Big Mac nearly 50 years ago and saw it become perhaps the best-known fast-food sandwich in the world, died Monday at home in Pittsburgh. Delligatti, who according to his son ate at least one 540-calorie Big Mac a week for decades, was 98. \nDelligatti’s franchise was based in Uniontown, not far from Pittsburgh, when he invented the chain’s signature burger in 1967 after deciding customers wanted a bigger sandwich. Demand exploded as Delligatti’s sandwich spread to the rest of his 47 stores in Pennsylvania and was added to the chain’s national menu in 1968. \n“He was often asked why he named it the Big Mac, and he said because Big Mc sounded too funny,” his son Michael Delligatti said. \nJim Delligatti told The Associated Press in 2006 that McDonald’s resisted the idea at first because its simple lineup of hamburgers, cheeseburgers, fries and shakes was selling well. \n“They figured, why go to something else if (the original menu) was working so well?” Delligatti said then. \nMcDonald’s has sold billions of Big Macs since then, in more than 100 countries. When the burger turned 40, McDonald’s estimated it was selling 550 million Big Macs a year, or roughly 17 every second. Delligatti received no payment or royalties for coming up with the burger, the company said. \n“Delligatti was a legendary franchisee within McDonald’s system who made a lasting impression on our brand,” the Oak Brook, Illinois-based company said Wednesday in a statement. The Big Mac “has become an iconic sandwich enjoyed by many around the world.” \nAnn Dugan, a former assistant dean of the University of Pittsburgh’s Katz School of Business and an expert on business franchises, said Jim Delligatti’s genius was simple: He listened to customers who wanted a bigger burger. \n“In franchising, there’s always this set playbook and you have to follow it. Jim saw an opportunity to go outside the playbook because he knew the customer,” Dugan said. “He persevered and (McDonald’s) listened, and the rest is history.” \nDelligatti headed M&J Management, a four-generation family business and McDonald’s franchise organization, for more than 60 years. He opened his first McDonald’s in Pittsburgh’s North Hills suburbs in 1957. In 1979, he co-founded Pittsburgh’s Ronald McDonald House, then the seventh such facility in the country, where families can stay when children travel to Pittsburgh for life-saving medical care, and he was involved in several other charities. \nDelligatti also helped introduce breakfast service at McDonald’s, developing the hotcakes and sausage meal to feed hungry steelworkers on their way home from overnight shifts in the mills, his family said. \nIn addition to his two sons, Jim Delligatti is survived by his wife, Ellie, five grandchildren and eight great-grandchildren. \nThe Devlin Funeral Home near Pittsburgh is handling visitation Thursday and Friday. Delligatti’s funeral will be held Saturday at St. Joseph’s Parish in O’Hara Township.",

      "title": "Who Is Michael ‘Jim’ Delligatti? Big Mac Inventor Dies At The Age Of 98 Almost 50 Years After Iconic McDonald’s Burger Was Launched",
      "text": "By Seerat Chabba @crat074 On 12/01/16 AT 2:23 AM The McDonald's Restaurant Store Museum is seen in the Chicago suburb of Des Plaines, Illinois, July 23, 2015. Photo: REUTERS/Jim Young/File Photo \nThe person behind McDonald’s iconic Big Mac has died. Michael “Jim” Delligatti, who created the burger almost 50 years ago, was 98. \nMcDonald’s spokeswoman Kerry Ford reportedly confirmed that Delligatti died at home surrounded by his family late Monday. As one of the company’s first franchisees, Delligatti started offering the Big Mac — for 45 cents — at his store in Uniontown, Pennsylvania, spreading to 47 of his other McDonald’s outlets across the country. \nIn an interview with the Associated Press in 2006, Delligatti said the company was initially averse to the idea of the new burger as their existing menu of hamburgers, cheeseburgers, fries and shakes was doing reasonable well. However, Delligatti wanted to offer a bigger, better burger. \nIn 1967, he decided to double the ingredients of a regular burger — beef patties, lettuce, cheese, pickles, onions and special sauce — and put out a new variation. \n“The first day we just used the regular bun, we didn't have any centre [bread] slice,” Delligatti told Reuters in 2007 . “Making it that way made it very sloppy. The next day we put the centre slice in, and today it looks the same.” \nMcDonald’s gauged the popularity of the Big Mac and went national with it in 1968. \nThe star of the seven-ingredient burger is undoubtedly the so-called “secret sauce.” Last year, McDonald's auctioned off a bottle of the sauce on eBay, attracting bids of more than $18,000. \nMcDonald’s described Delligatti as a “legendary” person, who “made a lasting impression on our brand.” A McDonald’s spokesperson told BBC’s Newsbeat : “[Jim] is an exemplary individual who embraced the community and championed many causes and organizations that benefitted children.” Related Stories The Global Economy: Minutes Of Minimum-Wage Work To Buy A Big Mac \n“We will remember Jim as an insightful franchisee, a knowledgeable businessman, and an honourable gentleman who left a legacy of four generations of family members running great restaurants in Pennsylvania and North Carolina.” \nMcDonald’s has over 36,000 outlets in more than 100 countries where more than 900 million Big Macs are sold annually. However, McDonald's says Delligatti received no payment for the creating the company’s iconic burger, ABC reported . \nDelligatti remained the burger’s biggest fan and, according to his son, consumed at least one Big Mac every week for decades.

      "text": ". PITTSBURGH \nYou probably don't know his name, but you've almost certainly devoured his creation: two all-beef patties, special sauce, lettuce, cheese, pickles, onions, on a sesame seed bun. \nMichael James \"Jim\" Delligatti, the McDonald's franchisee who created the Big Mac nearly 50 years ago and saw it become perhaps the best-known fast-food sandwich in the world, died Monday at home in Pittsburgh. Delligatti, who according to his son ate at least one 540-calorie Big Mac a week for decades, was 98. \nDelligatti's franchise was based in Uniontown, not far from Pittsburgh, when he invented the chain's signature burger in 1967 after deciding customers wanted a bigger sandwich. Demand exploded as Delligatti's sandwich spread to the rest of his 47 stores in Pennsylvania and was added to the chain's national menu in 1968. \n\"He was often asked why he named it the Big Mac, and he said because Big Mc sounded too funny,\" his son Michael Delligatti said. \nHowever, McDonald's in 1985 honored Esther Glickstein Rose with coming up for a name for the burger and presented her with a plaque etched with a likeness of the best-selling sandwich and french fries between the Golden Arches. She was a 21-year-old secretary for the company's advertising department in 1967 when, the story goes, a harried executive dashing to a board meeting asked her for a name nomination. \nJim Delligatti's family disputes that Rose came up with the idea. The company didn't immediately clear up the dispute Wednesday. \nDelligatti told The Associated Press in 2006 that McDonald's resisted the idea at first because its simple lineup of hamburgers, cheeseburgers, fries and shakes was selling well. \n\"They figured, why go to something else if (the original menu) was working so well?\" Delligatti said then. \nMcDonald's has sold billions of Big Macs since then, in more than 100 countries. When the burger turned 40, McDonald's estimated it was selling 550 million Big Macs a year, or roughly 17 every second. Delligatti received no payment or royalties for coming up with the burger, the company said. \n\"Delligatti was a legendary franchisee within McDonald's system who made a lasting impression on our brand,\" the Oak Brook, Illinois-based company said Wednesday in a statement. The Big Mac \"has become an iconic sandwich enjoyed by many around the world.\" \nAnn Dugan, a former assistant dean of the University of Pittsburgh's Katz School of Business and an expert on business franchises, said Jim Delligatti's genius was simple: He listened to customers who wanted a bigger burger. \n\"In franchising, there's always this set playbook and you have to follow it. Jim saw an opportunity to go outside the playbook because he knew the customer,\" Dugan said. \"He persevered and (McDonald's) listened, and the rest is history.\" \nDelligatti headed M&J Management, a four-generation family business and McDonald's franchise organization, for more than 60 years. He opened his first McDonald's in Pittsburgh's North Hills suburbs in 1957. In 1979, he co-founded Pittsburgh's Ronald McDonald House, then the seventh such facility in the country, where families can stay when children travel to Pittsburgh for life-saving medical care, and he was involved in several other charities. \nDelligatti also helped introduce breakfast service at McDonald's, developing the hotcakes and sausage meal to feed hungry steelworkers on their way home from overnight shifts in the mills, his family said. \nIn addition to his two sons, Jim Delligatti is survived by his wife, Ellie, five grandchildren and eight great-grandchildren. \nThe Devlin Funeral Home near Pittsburgh is handling visitation Thursday and Friday. Delligatti's funeral will be held Saturday at St. Joseph's Parish in O'Hara Township. Today, we celebrate the 98 inspirational years of Big Mac inventor, Michael \"Jim\" Delligatti. Jim, we thank and will forever remember you. pic.twitter.com/wmEFrmazdn",

Delligatti, the Pittsburgh-area McDonald's franchisee who created the Big Mac in 1967, has died. He was 98. (AP Photo/Gene J. Puskar, File) \nPITTSBURGH (AP) — You probably don’t know his name, but you’ve almost certainly devoured his creation: two all-beef patties, special sauce, lettuce, cheese, pickles, onions, on a sesame seed bun. \nMichael James “Jim” Delligatti, the McDonald’s franchisee who created the Big Mac nearly 50 years ago and saw it become perhaps the best-known fast-food sandwich in the world, died Monday at home in Pittsburgh. Delligatti, who according to his son ate at least one 540-calorie Big Mac a week for decades, was 98. \nDelligatti’s franchise was based in Uniontown, not far from Pittsburgh, when he invented the chain’s signature burger in 1967 after deciding customers wanted a bigger sandwich. Demand exploded as Delligatti’s sandwich spread to the rest of his 47 stores in Pennsylvania and was added to the chain’s national menu in 1968. \n“He was often asked why he named it the Big Mac, and he said because Big Mc sounded too funny,” his son Michael Delligatti said. \nJim Delligatti told The Associated Press in 2006 that McDonald’s resisted the idea at first because its simple lineup of hamburgers, cheeseburgers, fries and shakes was selling well. \n“They figured, why go to something else if (the original menu) was working so well?” Delligatti said then. \nMcDonald’s has sold billions of Big Macs since then, in more than 100 countries. When the burger turned 40, McDonald’s estimated it was selling 550 million Big Macs a year, or roughly 17 every second. Delligatti received no payment or royalties for coming up with the burger, the company said. \n“Delligatti was a legendary franchisee within McDonald’s system who made a lasting impression on our brand,” the Oak Brook, Illinois-based company said Wednesday in a statement. The Big Mac “has become an iconic sandwich enjoyed by many around the world.” \nAnn Dugan, a former assistant dean of the University of Pittsburgh’s Katz School of Business and an expert on business franchises, said Jim Delligatti’s genius was simple: He listened to customers who wanted a bigger burger. \n“In franchising, there’s always this set playbook and you have to follow it. Jim saw an opportunity to go outside the playbook because he knew the customer,” Dugan said. “He persevered and (McDonald’s) listened, and the rest is history.” \nDelligatti headed M&J Management, a four-generation family business and McDonald’s franchise organization, for more than 60 years. He opened his first McDonald’s in Pittsburgh’s North Hills suburbs in 1957. In 1979, he co-founded Pittsburgh’s Ronald McDonald House, then the seventh such facility in the country, where families can stay when children travel to Pittsburgh for life-saving medical care, and he was involved in several other charities. \nDelligatti also helped introduce breakfast service at McDonald’s, developing the hotcakes and sausage meal to feed hungry steelworkers on their way home from overnight shifts in the mills, his family said. \nIn addition to his two sons, Jim Delligatti is survived by his wife, Ellie, five grandchildren and eight great-grandchildren. \nThe Devlin Funeral Home near Pittsburgh is handling visitation Thursday and Friday. Delligatti’s funeral will be held Saturday at St. Joseph’s Parish in O’Hara Township. Share this: ",

Delligatti, who according to his son ate at least one 540-calorie Big Mac a week for decades, was 98. Delligatti's franchise was based in Uniontown, not far from Pittsburgh, when he invented the chain's signature burger in 1967 after deciding customers wanted a bigger sandwich. Demand exploded as Delligatti's sandwich spread to the rest of his 47 stores in Pennsylvania and was added to the chain's national menu in 1968. \"He was often asked why he named it the Big Mac, and he said because Big Mc sounded too funny,\" his son Michael Delligatti said. Jim Delligatti told The Associated Press in 2006 that McDonald's resisted the idea at first because its simple lineup of hamburgers, cheeseburgers, fries and shakes was selling well. Photo: Gene J.

McDonald's has sold billions of Big Macs since then, in more than 100 countries. When the burger turned 40, McDonald's estimated it was selling 550 million Big Macs a year, or roughly 17 every second. Delligatti received no payment or royalties for coming up with the burger, the company said. \"Delligatti was a legendary franchisee within McDonald's system who made a lasting impression on our brand,\" the Oak Brook, Illinois-based company said Wednesday in a statement. The Big Mac \"has become an iconic sandwich enjoyed by many around the world.\" Ann Dugan , a former assistant dean of the University of Pittsburgh 's Katz School of Business and an expert on business franchises, said Jim Delligatti's genius was simple: He listened to customers who wanted a bigger burger. \"In franchising, there's always this set playbook and you have to follow it. Jim saw an opportunity to go outside the playbook because he knew the customer,\" Dugan said. \"He persevered and (McDonald's) listened, and the rest is history.\" Delligatti headed M&J Management, a four-generation family business and McDonald's franchise organization, for more than 60 years. He opened his first McDonald's in Pittsburgh's North Hills suburbs in 1957. In 1979, he co-founded Pittsburgh's Ronald McDonald House , then the seventh such facility in the country, where families can stay when children travel to Pittsburgh for life-saving medical care, and he was involved in several other charities. Delligatti also helped introduce breakfast service at McDonald's, developing the hotcakes and sausage meal to feed hungry steelworkers on their way home from overnight shifts in the mills, his family said. In addition to his two sons, Jim Delligatti is survived by his wife, Ellie, five grandchildren and eight great-grandchildren. The Devlin Funeral Home near Pittsburgh is handling visitation Thursday and Friday. Delligatti's funeral will be held Saturday at St. Joseph's Parish in O'Hara Township.

      "title": "McDonald's Big Mac Inventor Jim Delligatti Has Died at 98",
      "text": "Michael “Jim” Delligatti, the inventor of McDonald’s ( MCD - Free Report ) famous Big Mac sandwich, died Monday night in Pittsburgh at 98 years old. He was one of the iconic burger chain’s first franchisees.\nBorn in 1918 in Uniontown, Pennsylvania, Delligatti first entered the hamburger business after he moved to Southern California, managing a drive-in restaurant in Long Beach. But 1955 is when the magic began: Delligatti bought his first McDonald’s franchise for $1,500, and went on to operate 47 additional locations throughout Pennsylvania.\nDelligatti first offered the Big Mac in 1967 at his Uniontown McDonald’s, wanting to introduce a bigger burger on a menu that specialized in simple burgers, fries, and shakes. Though it seems absurd today, McDonald’s was hesitant to the idea of the Big Mac because its basic menu was selling well. According to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette , Delligatti was eventually given the go-ahead to make the burger—despite having to go out and buy the double-sliced buns himself—creating a hit at his restaurants.\nThe recipe hasn’t changed since, with two all-beef patties, lettuce, cheese, pickles, onions, and “special sauce” on a sesame bun, even though the price has. The Big Mac originally sold for 45 cents. Today, you can get the burger for $3.99 (or $5.69 if you make it a meal). The burger is sold in more than 100 countries around the world.\n“Jim was a legendary franchisee within McDonald’s system who made a lasting impression on our brand,\" McDonald's said in a statement on Delligatti's death. \"We will remember Jim as an insightful franchisee, a knowledgeable businessman, and an honorable gentleman who left a legacy of four generations of family members running great restaurants in Pennsylvania and North Carolina.\"\nIn addition to creating one of the most famous sandwiches ever, Delligatti played a crucial role in developing McDonald’s breakfast menu. He would feed steel workers hotcakes and sausage at the end of their overnight shifts, in effect creating the popular Hotcakes and Sausage menu item, according to a family obituary.\nStocks that Aren't in the News…Yet \nYou are invited to download the full, up-to-the-minute list of 220 Zacks Rank #1 \"Strong Buys\" free of charge.

      "text": "Dec 1, 2016, 9:00pm Image: Supplied \nHave you ever noticed how McDonald's Chicken Mcnuggets come in a handful of suspiciously similar shapes? (The one with the protruding nubbin in every pack is usually the giveaway.) Turns out there are four distinct forms of McNugget: the bell, the ball, the boot and the bow tie/bone. Here's how they are made. \nMcDonald’s Canada released a video showing us how Chicken McNuggets are made - a process that is markedly similar at McDonald's restaurants around the world. \nWe went digging for the reasoning behind the shapes and here’s what we found out. The four shapes are all the same width and they are “pressed out with a rolling cookie cutter,” according to McDonald’s marketing material. \nThe picture below shows the nuggets after they have been formed. The bottom row is the bow tie, followed by a row of boots, then balls, and the bells: Image: Supplied \nThe reason why they are all a standard shape and size is to ensure consistent cooking times for food safety in all McDonald’s restaurants. But the varying shapes are also geared toward kids. \n“Our Chicken McNuggets are shaped uniquely for kids and kids at heart — it makes dipping more fun!” the company wrote. \nSo why just four shapes? \nAccording to the company, “three would’ve been too few. Five would’ve been, like, wacky.” \nAfter the nuggets are shaped, they are smothered in a two layers of batter and then sent to the fryers, where they are partially cooked. \nThey come out of the fryer looking like this: \nFinally, the nuggets are frozen and packaged for shipping to McDonald’s restaurants, where they should be fully cooked through for consumption. \nMcDonald's Australia adds the following: \n\"To make our Chicken McNuggets, we use chicken breast, some skin and a few seasonings for flavour and to maintain succulence. Then comes the classic coating. It involves three steps: battering, breading and the tempura coating. The nuggets are then par-fried in canola oil before freezing. The nuggets are cooked from frozen in our restaurants in our canola oil blend.\" \nSo there you have it! Also, to anyone concerned that McNuggets are made from baby chickens and/or tossed into grinders while alive, here's the official response from McDonald's Australia: \nOur Chicken McNuggets are made with 100% Aussie chicken breast meat that we can only get from mature chickens, and not the baby ones. \nGood to know.

      "text": "\n“Earlier this year, we became aware of certain circumstances relating to services provided by Human Connection HR which were not in compliance with our standards,” spokesman Ron Christianson said in a statement. \n“As a result, we have terminated our contract with them.” \nThere was no suggestion of any wrongdoing by McDonald’s. Human Connection HR said it will hold a meeting and issue a response soon. \nChristianson would not confirm details of the exploitation, saying the workers were employees of the labour agency. \n“Because the workers are not employees of McDonald’s, our efforts to address the issues were unsuccessful, as were proposals for McDonald’s to assume responsibility for paying workers directly,” he said. \nHuman Connection HR had been supplying workers to McDonald’s in Malaysia for “a number of years”, Christianson added. \nHe said the company’s suppliers were bound to uphold a code of conduct which includes safeguarding worker’s rights. \nMcDonald’s hires over 12,000 people in Malaysia, and less than 5 percent are foreign workers. \nMalaysia, which is Southeast Asia’s third-largest economy, relies heavily on foreign workers especially in construction, plantation and domestic work, but human rights campaigners have long voiced concerns that they face widespread abuses. \nAegile Fernandez, director at Kuala Lumpur-based migrant rights group Tenaganita, said labour exploitation happens “almost everyday” among multinational firms in the country. \nShe urged McDonald’s to take responsibility and ensure its supply chain is free of exploitation and slavery. \n“They can’t run away because they are the main company,” she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. \n“No matter if you’re in the United States or Europe, you have to ensure your suppliers are following all the regulations and upholding the rights of the workers.” Best of Express ",

      "text": "Asia Pacific McDonald's drops supplier in Malaysia over worker exploitation claims Fast food giant McDonald's said it has dropped a labour supply agency in Malaysia after claims emerged that it was underpaying its migrant workers and housing them in appalling conditions. Posted 01 Dec 2016 19:01 Updated 01 Dec 2016 19:10 A McDonald's outlet in Kuala Lumpur. (Photo: AFP / JIMIN LAI) A \nKUALA LUMPUR (Thomson Reuters Foundation): Fast food giant McDonald's said it has dropped a labour supply agency in Malaysia after claims emerged that it was underpaying its migrant workers and housing them in appalling conditions. \nAn investigation by British newspaper the Guardian said the agency supplying workers to McDonald's was withholding their salaries, which were as low as 75 US cents an hour, underpaying promised wages, and confiscating their passports. \nThe report was based on interviews with 15 Nepali workers who had worked at different McDonald's restaurants in the capital Kuala Lumpur. \nMcDonald's said it has ended its contract with the agency, Human Connection HR, and pledged staff welfare is a \"top priority\", with companies globally under mounting pressure to ensure their supply chains are free of slavery and exploitation. \n\"Earlier this year, we became aware of certain circumstances relating to services provided by Human Connection HR which were not in compliance with our standards,\" spokesman Ron Christianson said in a statement. \n\"As a result, we have terminated our contract with them.\" \nThere was no suggestion of any wrongdoing by McDonald's. Human Connection HR said it will hold a meeting and issue a response soon. \nChristianson would not confirm details of the exploitation, saying the workers were employees of the labour agency. \n\"Because the workers are not employees of McDonald's, our efforts to address the issues were unsuccessful, as were proposals for McDonald's to assume responsibility for paying workers directly,\" he said. \nHuman Connection HR had been supplying workers to McDonald's in Malaysia for \"a number of years\", Christianson added. \nHe said the company's suppliers were bound to uphold a code of conduct which includes safeguarding worker's rights. \nMcDonald's hires more than 12,000 people in Malaysia, and less than 5 per cent are foreign workers. \nMalaysia, which is Southeast Asia's third-largest economy, relies heavily on foreign workers especially in construction, plantation and domestic work, but human rights campaigners have long voiced concerns that they face widespread abuses. \nAegile Fernandez, director at Kuala Lumpur-based migrant rights group Tenaganita, said labour exploitation happens \"almost everyday\" among multinational firms in the country. \nShe urged McDonald's to take responsibility and ensure its supply chain is free of exploitation and slavery. \n\"They can't run away because they are the main company,\" she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. \n\"No matter if you're in the United States or Europe, you have to ensure your suppliers are following all the regulations and upholding the rights of the workers.\" - Reuters",

Creator of McDonald's flagship sandwich, the Big Mac, dies Joe Mandak Associated Press ( … ) Gene J. Puskar/AP \nIn this Aug. 21, 2008, photo, Big Mac creator Michael \"Jim\" Delligatti sits behind a Big Mac birthday cake at his 90th birthday party in Canonsburg, Pennsylvania. Delligatti, the Pittsburgh-area McDonald's franchisee who created the Big Mac in 1967, has died. He was 98. \nPITTSBURGH — You probably don't know his name, but you've almost certainly devoured his creation: two all-beef patties, special sauce, lettuce, cheese, pickles, onions, on a sesame seed bun. \nMichael James \"Jim\" Delligatti, the McDonald's franchisee who created the Big Mac nearly 50 years ago and saw it become perhaps the best-known fast-food sandwich in the world, died Monday at home in Pittsburgh. Delligatti, who according to his son ate at least one 540-calorie Big Mac a week for decades, was 98. \nDelligatti's franchise was based in Uniontown, not far from Pittsburgh, when he invented the chain's signature burger in 1967 after deciding customers wanted a bigger sandwich. Demand exploded as Delligatti's sandwich spread to the rest of his 47 stores in Pennsylvania and was added to the chain's national menu in 1968. \n\"He was often asked why he named it the Big Mac, and he said because Big Mc sounded too funny,\" his son Michael Delligatti said. \nJim Delligatti told The Associated Press in 2006 that McDonald's resisted the idea at first because its simple lineup of hamburgers, cheeseburgers, fries and shakes was selling well. \n\"They figured, why go to something else if (the original menu) was working so well?\" Delligatti said then. \nMcDonald's has sold billions of Big Macs since then, in more than 100 countries. When the burger turned 40, McDonald's estimated it was selling 550 million Big Macs a year, or roughly 17 every second. Delligatti received no payment or royalties for coming up with the burger, the company said. \n\"Delligatti was a legendary franchisee within McDonald's system who made a lasting impression on our brand,\" the Oak Brook, Illinois-based company said Wednesday in a statement. The Big Mac \"has become an iconic sandwich enjoyed by many around the world.\" \nAnn Dugan, a former assistant dean of the University of Pittsburgh's Katz School of Business and an expert on business franchises, said Jim Delligatti's genius was simple: He listened to customers who wanted a bigger burger. \n\"In franchising, there's always this set playbook and you have to follow it. Jim saw an opportunity to go outside the playbook because he knew the customer,\" Dugan said. \"He persevered and (McDonald's) listened, and the rest is history.\" \nDelligatti headed M&J Management, a four-generation family business and McDonald's franchise organization, for more than 60 years. He opened his first McDonald's in Pittsburgh's North Hills suburbs in 1957. In 1979, he co-founded Pittsburgh's Ronald McDonald House, then the seventh such facility in the country, where families can stay when children travel to Pittsburgh for life-saving medical care, and he was involved in several other charities. \nDelligatti also helped introduce breakfast service at McDonald's, developing the hotcakes and sausage meal to feed hungry steelworkers on their way home from overnight shifts in the mills, his family said. \nIn addition to his two sons, Jim Delligatti is survived by his wife, Ellie, five grandchildren and eight great-grandchildren. \nThe Devlin Funeral Home near Pittsburgh is handling visitation Thursday and Friday. Delligatti's funeral will be held Saturday at St. Joseph's Parish in O'Hara Township. Most Popular",

      "text": "KUALA LUMPUR (REUTERS) - Fast food giant McDonald's said it has dropped a labour supply agency in Malaysia after claims emerged that it was underpaying its migrant workers and housing them in appalling conditions.\nAn investigation by British newspaper the Guardian said the agency supplying workers to McDonald's was withholding their salaries, which were as low as US$0.75 (S$1.07) an hour, underpaying promised wages, and confiscating their passports.\nThe report was based on interviews with 15 Nepali workers who had worked at different McDonald's restaurants in the capital Kuala Lumpur.\nMcDonald's said it has ended its contract with the agency, Human Connection HR, and pledged staff welfare is a \"top priority\", with companies globally under mounting pressure to ensure their supply chains are free of slavery and exploitation. \n\"Earlier this year, we became aware of certain circumstances relating to services provided by Human Connection HR which were not in compliance with our standards,\" spokesman Ron Christianson said in a statement. \"As a result, we have terminated our contract with them.\" \nThere was no suggestion of any wrongdoing by McDonald's. Human Connection HR said it will hold a meeting and issue a response soon.\nChristianson would not confirm details of the exploitation, saying the workers were employees of the labour agency. \n\"Because the workers are not employees of McDonald's, our efforts to address the issues were unsuccessful, as were proposals for McDonald's to assume responsibility for paying workers directly,\" he said.\nHuman Connection HR had been supplying workers to McDonald's in Malaysia for \"a number of years\", Christianson added.\nHe said the company's suppliers were bound to uphold a code of conduct which includes safeguarding worker's rights.\nMcDonald's hires over 12,000 people in Malaysia, and less than 5 percent are foreign workers.\nMalaysia, which is Southeast Asia's third-largest economy, relies heavily on foreign workers especially in construction, plantation and domestic work, but human rights campaigners have long voiced concerns that they face widespread abuses.\nAegile Fernandez, director at Kuala Lumpur-based migrant rights group Tenaganita, said labour exploitation happens\"almost everyday\" among multinational firms in the country.\nShe urged McDonald's to take responsibility and ensure its supply chain is free of exploitation and slavery. \n\"They can't run away because they are the main company,\" she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. \"No matter if you're in the United States or Europe, you have to ensure your suppliers are following all the regulations and upholding the rights of the workers.\"\nTopics:  MALAYSIA FAST FOOD  //str.sg/4QX5 Copy",

Delligatti, the Pittsburgh-area McDonald's franchisee who created the Big Mac in 1967, has died. He was 98. (AP Photo/Gene J. Puskar, File) PITTSBURGH You probably don't know his name, but you've almost certainly devoured his creation: two all-beef patties, special sauce, lettuce, cheese, pickles, onions, on a sesame seed bun. Michael James \"Jim\" Delligatti, the McDonald's franchisee who created the Big Mac nearly 50 years ago and saw it become perhaps the best-known fast-food sandwich in the world, died Monday at home in Pittsburgh. Delligatti, who according to his son ate at least one 540-calorie Big Mac a week for decades, was 98. Delligatti's franchise was based in Uniontown, not far from Pittsburgh, when he invented the chain's signature burger in 1967 after deciding customers wanted a bigger sandwich. Demand exploded as Delligatti's sandwich spread to the rest of his 47 stores in Pennsylvania and was added to the chain's national menu in 1968. \"He was often asked why he named it the Big Mac, and he said because Big Mc sounded too funny,\" his son Michael Delligatti said. However, McDonald's in 1985 honored Esther Glickstein Rose with coming up for a name for the burger and presented her with a plaque etched with a likeness of the best-selling sandwich and french fries between the Golden Arches. She was a 21-year-old secretary for the company's advertising department in 1967 when, the story goes, a harried executive dashing to a board meeting asked her for a name nomination. Jim Delligatti's family disputes that Rose came up with the idea. The company didn't immediately clear up the dispute Wednesday. Delligatti told The Associated Press in 2006 that McDonald's resisted the idea at first because its simple lineup of hamburgers, cheeseburgers, fries and shakes was selling well. \"They figured, why go to something else if (the original menu) was working so well?\" Delligatti said then. McDonald's has sold billions of Big Macs since then, in more than 100 countries. When the burger turned 40, McDonald's estimated it was selling 550 million Big Macs a year, or roughly 17 every second. Delligatti received no payment or royalties for coming up with the burger, the company said. \"Delligatti was a legendary franchisee within McDonald's system who made a lasting impression on our brand,\" the Oak Brook, Illinois-based company said Wednesday in a statement. The Big Mac \"has become an iconic sandwich enjoyed by many around the world.\" Ann Dugan, a former assistant dean of the University of Pittsburgh's Katz School of Business and an expert on business franchises, said Jim Delligatti's genius was simple: He listened to customers who wanted a bigger burger. \"In franchising, there's always this set playbook and you have to follow it. Jim saw an opportunity to go outside the playbook because he knew the customer,\" Dugan said. \"He persevered and (McDonald's) listened, and the rest is history.\" Delligatti headed M&J Management, a four-generation family business and McDonald's franchise organization, for more than 60 years. He opened his first McDonald's in Pittsburgh's North Hills suburbs in 1957. In 1979, he co-founded Pittsburgh's Ronald McDonald House, then the seventh such facility in the country, where families can stay when children travel to Pittsburgh for life-saving medical care, and he was involved in several other charities. Delligatti also helped introduce breakfast service at McDonald's, developing the hotcakes and sausage meal to feed hungry steelworkers on their way home from overnight shifts in the mills, his family said. In addition to his two sons, Jim Delligatti is survived by his wife, Ellie, five grandchildren and eight great-grandchildren. The Devlin Funeral Home near Pittsburgh is handling visitation Thursday and Friday. Delligatti's funeral will be held Saturday at St. Joseph's Parish in O'Hara Township.

      "text": "World   Creator of McDonald's flagship sandwich, the Big Mac, dies By Joe Mandak (Associated Press)   5:43pm In this Aug. 21, 2008, file photo, Big Mac creator Michael \"Jim\" Delligatti attends his 90th birthday party in Canonsburg, Pa. Delligatti, the Pittsburgh-area McDonald's franchisee who created the Big Mac in 1967, has died. He was 98. AP/Gene J. Puskar, File \nPITTSBURGH — You probably don't know his name, but you've almost certainly devoured his creation: two all-beef patties, special sauce, lettuce, cheese, pickles, onions, on a sesame seed bun. \nMichael James \"Jim\" Delligatti, the McDonald's franchisee who created the Big Mac nearly 50 years ago and saw it become perhaps the best-known fast-food sandwich in the world, died Monday at home in Pittsburgh. Delligatti, who according to his son ate at least one 540-calorie Big Mac a week for decades, was 98. \nDelligatti's franchise was based in Uniontown, not far from Pittsburgh, when he invented the chain's signature burger in 1967 after deciding customers wanted a bigger sandwich. Demand exploded as Delligatti's sandwich spread to the rest of his 47 stores in Pennsylvania and was added to the chain's national menu in 1968. \n\"He was often asked why he named it the Big Mac, and he said because Big Mc sounded too funny,\" his son Michael Delligatti said. \nHowever, McDonald's in 1985 honored Esther Glickstein Rose with coming up for a name for the burger and presented her with a plaque etched with a likeness of the best-selling sandwich and french fries between the Golden Arches. She was a 21-year-old secretary for the company's advertising department in 1967 when, the story goes, a harried executive dashing to a board meeting asked her for a name nomination. \nJim Delligatti's family disputes that Rose came up with the idea. The company didn't immediately clear up the dispute Wednesday. World   \nDelligatti told The Associated Press in 2006 that McDonald's resisted the idea at first because its simple lineup of hamburgers, cheeseburgers, fries and shakes was selling well. \n\"They figured, why go to something else if (the original menu) was working so well?\" Delligatti said then. \nMcDonald's has sold billions of Big Macs since then, in more than 100 countries. When the burger turned 40, McDonald's estimated it was selling 550 million Big Macs a year, or roughly 17 every second. Delligatti received no payment or royalties for coming up with the burger, the company said. \n\"Delligatti was a legendary franchisee within McDonald's system who made a lasting impression on our brand,\" the Oak Brook, Illinois-based company said Wednesday in a statement. The Big Mac \"has become an iconic sandwich enjoyed by many around the world.\" \nAnn Dugan, a former assistant dean of the University of Pittsburgh's Katz School of Business and an expert on business franchises, said Jim Delligatti's genius was simple: He listened to customers who wanted a bigger burger. \n\"In franchising, there's always this set playbook and you have to follow it. Jim saw an opportunity to go outside the playbook because he knew the customer,\" Dugan said. \"He persevered and (McDonald's) listened, and the rest is history.\" \nDelligatti headed M&J Management, a four-generation family business and McDonald's franchise organization, for more than 60 years. He opened his first McDonald's in Pittsburgh's North Hills suburbs in 1957. In 1979, he co-founded Pittsburgh's Ronald McDonald House, then the seventh such facility in the country, where families can stay when children travel to Pittsburgh for life-saving medical care, and he was involved in several other charities. \nDelligatti also helped introduce breakfast service at McDonald's, developing the hotcakes and sausage meal to feed hungry steelworkers on their way home from overnight shifts in the mills, his family said. \nIn addition to his two sons, Jim Delligatti is survived by his wife, Ellie, five grandchildren and eight great-grandchildren. \nThe Devlin Funeral Home near Pittsburgh is handling visitation Thursday and Friday. Delligatti's funeral will be held Saturday at St. Joseph's Parish in O'Hara Township.",

      "text": "The inventor of the Big Mac has died aged 98 Alim Kheraj The man behind the iconic McDonald’s Big Mac has died aged 98. Michael “Jim” Delligatti invented the famous sandwich in 1967 where it was trialled in Uniontown, Pa., south of Pittsburgh, and sold for just 45 cents. Within a year, the sandwich had been rolled out to every McDonald’s franchise in the country, and by 1969 it allegedly brought in around 19% of the company’s total sales. Indeed, the Big Mac is still so popular that last year McDonald’s Sweden launched a shop dedicated to the burger , and McDonald’s sells around 550 million Big Macs in the U.S. alone every year. However, sadly Michael Delligatti passed away on Monday (November 28th) in his home in Fox Chapel, Pa. RIP James Delligatti, creator of the Big Mac. Thanks for all the delicious memories, Jim. pic.twitter.com/cxIGA0hbo6 — McDonald's Philly (@McDPhilly) November 30, 2016 Known for it’s two beef patties, it’s center sliced bun, and Secret Sauce, the Big Mac became synonymous with its famous commercials, including this retro 1968 one that sees an actor in a beige suit explaining what goes into the sandwich. However, the burger became known for it’s catchy jingle that lists the ingredients of the Big Mac. Indeed, Delligatti even opened his own Big Mac Museum in 2007. Speaking to Reuters at the time, he opened up about why he invented the iconic hamburger sandwich. “I felt that we needed a big sandwich, but you couldn’t do anything unless they gave you permission,” he said. “The first day we just used the regular bun, we didn’t have any center (bread) slice. Making it that way made it very sloppy. The next day we put the center slice in, and today it looks the same.” Delligatti actually went rogue while making the Big Mac. While his idea was approved by McDonald’s, he used a large sesame seed bun from a local baker to put the burger together. Today, we celebrate the 98 inspirational years of Big Mac inventor, Michael \"Jim\" Delligatti. Jim, we thank and will forever remember you. pic.twitter.com/wmEFrmazdn — McDonald's (@McDonalds) November 30, 2016 Part of the Big Mac’s appeal, however, is that Special Sauce. While McDonald’s revealed how the sauce is made in a recent video, a bottle of the Mac Sauce was sold for $18,000 only last year. “[Jim] is an exemplary individual who embraced the community and championed many causes and organizations that benefitted children,” McDonald’s told BBC Newsbeat in a statement. “We will remember Jim as an insightful franchisee, a knowledgeable businessman, and an honourable gentleman who left a legacy of four generations of family members running great restaurants in Pennsylvania and North Carolina.” Earlier this year, McDonald’s announced that they were launching a new version of the Big Mac , the Mac JR, a smaller version of the sandwich . Similarly, it was revealed that the fast food giant was trialling a Sriracha Big Mac, too. Our thoughts are with Delligatti’s family at this time.",

McDonald's spokeswoman confirmed Delligatti's death, which occurred Monday night in his home, and said he was surrounded by family. Delligatti, who owned a franchise in the Pittsburgh area, invented the Big Mac 50 years ago with two all-beef patties, “special sauce,” lettuce, cheese, pickles, onions on a sesame seed bun. Media: Wibbitz PITTSBURGH (AP) — You probably don't know his name, but you've almost certainly devoured his creation: two all-beef patties, special sauce, lettuce, cheese, pickles, onions, on a sesame seed bun. Michael James \"Jim\" Delligatti, the McDonald's franchisee who created the Big Mac nearly 50 years ago and saw it become perhaps the best-known fast-food sandwich in the world, died Monday at home in Pittsburgh. Delligatti, who according to his son ate at least one 540-calorie Big Mac a week for decades, was 98. Delligatti's franchise was based in Uniontown, not far from Pittsburgh, when he invented the chain's signature burger in 1967 after deciding customers wanted a bigger sandwich. Demand exploded as Delligatti's sandwich spread to the rest of his 47 stores in Pennsylvania and was added to the chain's national menu in 1968. \"He was often asked why he named it the Big Mac, and he said because Big Mc sounded too funny,\" his son Michael Delligatti said. Jim Delligatti told The Associated Press in 2006 that McDonald's resisted the idea at first because its simple lineup of hamburgers, cheeseburgers, fries and shakes was selling well. Photo: Gene J.

McDonald's has sold billions of Big Macs since then, in more than 100 countries. When the burger turned 40, McDonald's estimated it was selling 550 million Big Macs a year, or roughly 17 every second. Delligatti received no payment or royalties for coming up with the burger, the company said. \"Delligatti was a legendary franchisee within McDonald's system who made a lasting impression on our brand,\" the Oak Brook, Illinois-based company said Wednesday in a statement. The Big Mac \"has become an iconic sandwich enjoyed by many around the world.\" Ann Dugan , a former assistant dean of the University of Pittsburgh 's Katz School of Business and an expert on business franchises, said Jim Delligatti's genius was simple: He listened to customers who wanted a bigger burger. \"In franchising, there's always this set playbook and you have to follow it. Jim saw an opportunity to go outside the playbook because he knew the customer,\" Dugan said. \"He persevered and (McDonald's) listened, and the rest is history.\" Delligatti headed M&J Management, a four-generation family business and McDonald's franchise organization, for more than 60 years. He opened his first McDonald's in Pittsburgh's North Hills suburbs in 1957. In 1979, he co-founded Pittsburgh's Ronald McDonald House , then the seventh such facility in the country, where families can stay when children travel to Pittsburgh for life-saving medical care, and he was involved in several other charities. Delligatti also helped introduce breakfast service at McDonald's, developing the hotcakes and sausage meal to feed hungry steelworkers on their way home from overnight shifts in the mills, his family said. In addition to his two sons, Jim Delligatti is survived by his wife, Ellie, five grandchildren and eight great-grandchildren. The Devlin Funeral Home near Pittsburgh is handling visitation Thursday and Friday. Delligatti's funeral will be held Saturday at St. Joseph's Parish in O'Hara Township. Latest News Video ",

      "text": "Reuters | December 1, 2016 McDonald's said it has ended its contract with the agency, Human Connection HR, and pledged staff welfare is a 'top priority', with companies globally under mounting pressure to ensure their supply chains are free of slavery and exploitation. \nKUALA LUMPUR: Fast food giant McDonald’s said it has dropped a labour supply agency in Malaysia after claims emerged that it was underpaying its migrant workers and housing them in appalling conditions. \nAn investigation by British newspaper the Guardian said the agency supplying workers to McDonald’s was withholding their salaries, which were as low as 75 US cents an hour, underpaying promised wages, and confiscating their passports. \nThe report was based on interviews with 15 Nepali workers who had worked at different McDonald’s restaurants in the capital Kuala Lumpur. \nMcDonald’s said it has ended its contract with the agency, Human Connection HR, and pledged that staff welfare is a “top priority”, with companies globally under mounting pressure to ensure their supply chains are free of slavery and exploitation. \n“Earlier this year, we became aware of certain circumstances relating to services provided by Human Connection HR which were not in compliance with our standards,” spokesman Ron Christianson said in a statement. \n“As a result, we have terminated our contract with them.” \nThere was no suggestion of any wrongdoing by McDonald’s. Human Connection HR said it will hold a meeting and issue a response soon. \nChristianson would not confirm details of the exploitation, saying the workers were employees of the labour agency. \n“Because the workers are not employees of McDonald’s, our efforts to address the issues were unsuccessful, as were proposals for McDonald’s to assume responsibility for paying workers directly,” he said. \nHuman Connection HR had been supplying workers to McDonald’s in Malaysia for “a number of years”, Christianson added. \nHe said the company’s suppliers were bound to uphold a code of conduct which includes safeguarding worker’s rights. \nMcDonald’s hires over 12,000 people in Malaysia, and less than 5 per cent are foreign workers. \nMalaysia, which is Southeast Asia’s third-largest economy, relies heavily on foreign workers especially in construction, plantation and domestic work, but human rights campaigners have long voiced concerns that they face widespread abuses. \nAegile Fernandez, director at Kuala Lumpur-based migrant rights group Tenaganita, said labour exploitation happens “almost everyday” among multinational firms in the country. \nShe urged McDonald’s to take responsibility and ensure its supply chain is free of exploitation and slavery. \n“They can’t run away because they are the main company,” she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. \n“No matter if you’re in the United States or Europe, you have to ensure your suppliers are following all the regulations and upholding the rights of the workers.”",

      "text": "By Rick Moran \nIn light of several cities passing $15 an hour minimum wage laws, McDonald's will install self-serve kiosks at many locations around the country. Wendy's has already gone the automated ordering route and othe fast food outlets are seriously considering it. \nSupporters of the $15 hourly wage claim that few jobs will be lost as result of automation. They say the self serve kiosks will make workers more efficient in dealing with the ordering process. That may be true ( as explained here ). But the near doubling of the minimum wage in most cities will be done incrementally, ostensibly to soften the blow to businesses. But that kind of thinking ignores the flash point where labor costs cannot be compensated for by raising prices. Eventually, something is going to have to give. \nForbes: \nIt’s not just McDonald’s that has embraced job-replacing technology. Numerous restaurant chains (both quick service and full service) have looked to computer tablets as a solution for rising labor costs that won’t adversely impact the customer’s experience. Eatsa, a fully-automated restaurant concept, now has five locations—all in cities or states that have embraced a $15 minimum wage. And in a scene stolen from The Jetsons , the Starship delivery robot is now navigating the streets of San Francisco with groceries and other consumer goods. The company’s founder pointed to a rising minimum wage as a key factor driving the growth of his automated delivery business. \nOf course, not all businesses have the capital necessary to shift from full-service to self-service. And that brings me to my next correct prediction –that a $15 minimum wage would force many small businesses to lay off staff, seek less-costly locations, or close altogether. \nTragically, these stories—in California in particular–are too numerous to cite in detail here. They include a bookstore in Roseville, a pub in Fresno, restaurants and bakeries in San Francisco, a coffee shop in Berkeley, grocery stores in Oakland, a grill in Santa Clara, and apparel manufacturers through the state. In September of this year, nearly one-quarter of restaurant closures in the Bay Area cited labor costs as one of the reasons for shutting down operations. And just this past week, a California-based communications firm announced it was moving 75 call center jobs from San Diego to El Paso, Texas, citing California’s rising minimum as the “deciding factor.” (Dozens of additional stories can be found at the website FacesOf15.com .) \nOther states are also learning the same basic economic lesson: Customers have a limit to what they will pay for service. Voters in Washington, Colorado, Maine and Arizona voted to raise minimum wages on Election Day, convinced of the policy’s merits after millions of dollars were spent by union advocates. In the immediate aftermath, family-owned restaurants, coffee shops and even childcare providers have struggled to absorb the coming cost increase—with parents paying the cost through steeper childcare bills, and employees paying the cost through reduced shift hours or none at all. \nAutomating the order process is only the beginning. Any repetitive task will eventually be done by robots. Most orders at future fast food restaurants will be filled by machines that place the burgers on the grill, flip them, place them on a condiment-laden bun, automatically fill the drink order, and send the finished product to a worker who will either bag it for carry out or put it on a tray for in strore consumption. This is the future. And while it will take a sizable capital investment to buy the machines, they will pay for themselves in a couple of years. \nPeople who support the \"Fight for Fifteen\" wage believe in magic. At the very least, they are ignorant of basic economics. Will they turn on organized labor when it becomes clear that unions had lied to them? No doubt they will blame \"greedy franchise owners\" for their predicament instead. \nIn light of several cities passing $15 an hour minimum wage laws, McDonald's will install self-serve kiosks at many locations around the country.

      "text": "The Vetr community has upgraded $WEN to 4.5-Stars. (Vetr) \nWhile there seems to be limited upside to the current valuations of McDonald's Corporation (NYSE: MCD ) and Wendys Co (NASDAQ: WEN ), the companies could face “more potential macro headwinds as gasoline becomes an incremental household expense after being a benefit for the last two years,” Guggenheim analysts said in a report. \nThe analysts downgraded the ratings on the companies from Buy to Neutral, while establishing a price target of $127 for McDonald's and removing the price target for Wendy’s. Rising Rates Add To The Challenges \nThe unemployment rate was already close to historical lows. While both McDonald’s and Wendy’s had experienced management teams that have been successfully executing restructuring plans , the Guggenheim report pointed out that “the rate of franchise investment in the near term could be challenged in a rising interest environment.” \nBoth the stocks were trading within 10 percent of their respective fair value price targets, the analysts mentioned, while reiterating their above-consensus estimates for 2017 for each. \nThe analysts said they preferred casual dining to quick-service brands . \nMcDonald's closed at $119.27 and was trading down about $0.42 in the pre-market session, while Wendy's closed at $12.57 and was down about $0.08. Year-to-date, McDonald's is up about 1 percent while Wendy's is up more than 16 percent. Latest Ratings for MCD",

      "text": "Jonathan Garber \n(Reuters) - A consortium led by private-equity firm Carlyle Group and Chinese conglomerate Citic Group Corp has neared a deal to buy McDonald's Corp's stores in China and Hong Kong for up to $3 billion, a source with direct knowledge of the matter said.\nThe deal is likely to be signed before Christmas, the source said.\nReuters had reported in October that U.S. buyout firms Carlyle and Bain Capital LLC had been the front runners among the bidders for the fast-food giant's China assets.\nMcDonald's in March said it was reorganizing operations in Asia, bringing in partners as it switches to a less capital-intensive franchise model.\nThe company hired Morgan Stanley to run the sale of about 2,400 restaurants in China and Hong Kong.\nFinancial Times reported earlier on Wednesday that Bain Capital had dropped out of the race, and that a group led by Citic Group and Carlyle were the front runners to the deal.\nCarlyle declined to comment, while McDonald's was not immediately available for a comment.

      "text": "Source: Thinkstock Despite an OPEC oil production cut, the stock market did not follow oil’s surge higher on Wednesday, and Thursday morning is looking to open soft to flat in early trading indications. What remains in place at this point is the theme of investors proving at every opportunity that they will buy stocks on any real pullbacks. Those same investors are also looking for new ideas to generate gains or income.\n24/7 Wall St. reviews dozens of analyst reports each day of the week to find new investing and trading ideas for its readers. Some of these analyst research reports cover stocks to buy, and other analyst calls cover stocks to sell or to avoid.\nOn a brief note on oil, many of the secondary and third tier oil companies rallied 15% to 30% — could it have been too much considering OPEC’s history of not sticking to quotas and cuts?\nThese are the top analyst upgrades, downgrades and initiations seen on Thursday morning:\nAlcoa Corp. (NYSE: AA) was started with a Sell rating and a $26 price target (versus a $28.97 prior close) at Deutsche Bank. Alcoa has recently transformed, and we show a post-adjustment trading range of $20.00 to $32.19, with a consensus analyst price target of $27.83. This was a $22 stock just a month ago, and shares were indicated down 1.3% at $28.58.\nDeere & Co. (NYSE: DE) was raised to Buy from Neutral with a $124 price objective (versus a $100.20 close) at Merrill Lynch. It has a 52-week range of $70.16 to $104.83 and consensus analyst price target of $98.05.\nI'm interested in the Newsletter Get Newsletter \nterms and conditions   Ford Motor Co. (NYSE: F) was started as Neutral with a $13 price target (versus an $11.96 close) at Macquarie. The 52-week range is $11.02 to $14.38, and the consensus analyst target is $12.72.\nGeneral Motors Co. (NYSE: GM) was started as Outperform with a $44 price target (versus a $34.53 close) at Macquarie. GM has a 52-week range of $26.69 to $36.52 and a consensus price target of $35.94.\nMcDonald’s Corp. (NYSE: MCD) was downgraded to Neutral from Buy at Guggenheim. It has a 52-week range of $110.33 to $131.96 and a consensus price target of $127.20.\nWells Fargo & Co. (NYSE: WFC) was downgraded to Neutral from Positive with a $56 price target (versus a $52.92 close) at Susquehanna, in a broader banking downgrade (see below) after huge post-election runs higher. Wells Fargo has a 52-week range of $43.55 to $56.24 and a consensus price target of $52.97.\nBHP Billiton Ltd. (NYSE: BHP) was reiterated as Buy and the price target was raised to $46 from $40 (versus a $37.54 close) at Argus. It has a 52-week range of $18.46 to $39.12 and a consensus price target of $36.46.\nRio Tinto PLC (NYSE: RIO) was reiterated as Buy and the price target was raised to $44 from $36 (versus a $37.91 close) at Argus. The 52-week range is $21.89 to $40.19, and the consensus price target is $42.18.\nFollow @Jonogg on Twitter to receive the daily analyst calls and research updates directly on your Twitter feed. \nOther key analyst upgrades and downgrades were seen in the following:",

      "text": "Atif Rafiq. Most Popular \nAtif Rafiq, who was named McDonald's first chief digital officer in 2013, is leaving the fast feeder for Volvo where he will assume the role of senior VP for information technology and chief digital officer. \nMr. Rafiq will oversee the automaker's \"continued digital transformation, helping to evolve how consumers interact with Volvo cars across the buying, driving, entertainment and service experience,\" Volvo said in a statement. Klas Bendrik, Volvo's senior-VP for Group IT, \"will support Mr. Rafiq in the transition and thereafter leave Volvo Cars for a new position,\" the automaker stated. \n\"The automotive industry is changing rapidly,\" said Håkan Samuelsson, Volvo's president and chief executive, in the statement. \"This means that Volvo must also change rapidly. Part of this involves rethinking how customers buy Volvo's cars and then how they interact with them once they have bought them. Atif is ideally qualified to speed up our development in this area.\" \nMr. Rafiq, 43, set up McDonald's Silicon Valley outpost in 2014 in an effort to better train and recruit digital talent. Projects he has overseen include tests of mobile ordering and payment, as well as McDonald's World Cup effort, which included an augmented reality game. Before McDonald's he held general management roles at Amazon, Yahoo, and AOL . \nRepresentatives for McDonald's did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Mr. Rafiq's departure. \nMcDonald's recently rolled out an updated app for the United States. While the McDonald's app has been downloaded by millions of customers, it still lacks some of the sticky features that have made other chains' apps appealing to diners, such as ordering and payment. Mobile ordering and payment is available in some of McDonald's other markets and is expected to hit the U.S. next year. The company has also beefed up its social media monitoring and outreach during Mr. Rafiq's tenure. \nVolvo's tech initiatives include implementing in 2017 what it describes as \"the world's largest autonomous driving experiment.\" The effort, called Drive Me, involves putting 100 families in autonomous driving Volvos on roads around Gothenburg in Sweden. Volvo in September announced plans to set up a jointly-owned venture with automotive safety system supplier Autoliv to develop autonomous driving software. Volvo also has a deal with Uber to develop cars for autonomous driving. \n\"In many ways, the development of cars that are autonomous, electrified and connected overlap,\" Mr. Samuelsson said. \"Mr Rafiq will help ensure that all of these developments are pursued in a cohesive, strategic and technologically-advanced way.\" \nThe auto industry is facing \"its biggest inflection point in literally 100 years,\" Mr. Rafiq said in the statement. \"Whether it's new technologies like computer vision and machine learning, or changing consumer behaviours around sharing and mobility, the scope for leveraging digitization is huge. I see in Volvo a company that has fully embraced these challenges and can lead the industry into the future.\" In this article:",

      "text": "\nThe creator of the Big Mac has died.\nJim Delligatti lived to 98 and is best known as a McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD) restaurant franchisee in Uniontown, Pennsylvania.\nHis story and success show that one franchise owner can have a big league impact on the overall company.\nIndeed, Delligatti’s experimentation and “special sauce” propelled McDonald’s ahead of all its fast-food competition.\nCheck out this super early commercial for the Big Mac:\n\nTo this day, the Big Mac is responsible for 20 percent of the corporation’s overall sales. But it was created to win a local business market.\nBig Mac Creator Focused Locally In 1968, Delligatti sold the first Big Mac in western Pennsylvania. It was designed to compete with a burger sold at a regional sit-down restaurant chain, Eat n Park.\nFor the record, it’s two all-beef patties, special sauce, lettuce, cheese, pickles, onions — on a sesame seed bun.\n\nThe rave reviews led to a total of 47 McDonald’s locations selling the burger. By the end of that year, it was in every McDonald’s in the U.S.\nSince then it’s been emulated and imitated. There are even McDonald’s restaurants that sell their own unique version of the Big Mac. It’s got its own museum . It’s used to measure currencies.\nMcDonald’s rode the Big Mac’s popularity through the end of the 20th Century. And even now, as its iconic status is in jeopardy (somewhat), the franchise is using another of Delligatii’s creations to stay on top today.\n\nYes, it was Delligatti who created the Egg McMuffin. And he also created the hot cakes and sausage breakfast item — originally to cater to steel workers near Pittsburgh, another locally focused effort that caught on nationally.\nIt’s clear that McDonald’s is probably on the hunt for the next Delligati and what franchise company isn’t?\nImage: McDonald’s \nThis article, \" Big Mac Creator and Early McDonald’s Franchise Owner Dies at 98 \" was first published on Small Business Trends \n",

      "text": "Privacy policy | More Newsletters AFP/Getty Images A McDonald's Big Mac, their signature sandwich is held up near the golden arches at a McDonalds's August 10, 2015, in Centreville, Virginia. The Pittsburgh-area McDonald's franchisee who created the Big Mac nearly 50 years ago has died. James Delligatti was 98. McDonald's spokeswoman Kerry Ford confirmed that Delligatti died at home surrounded by his family on Monday night. Hat-Wearing Penn State Critters Go Nuts for 'Squirrel Girl' Delligatti's franchise was based in Uniontown, about 40 miles south of Pittsburgh, when he invented the chain's signature burger with two all-beef patties, \"special sauce,\" lettuce, cheese, pickles, onions on a sesame seed bun. Delligatti told The Associated Press in 2006 that Oak Brook, Illinois-based McDonald's resisted the idea at first, because its simple lineup of hamburgers, cheeseburgers, fries and shakes were selling well. But Delligatti wanted to offer a bigger burger and it went over so well it spread to the rest of Delligatti's 47 stores, then went national in 1968.

      "text": "Aleister Dec 1st, 2016 10:04 am Leave a Comment \nThe “Fight for 15” movement has been staging protests for the last few years, insisting that fast food workers get a minimum wage of $15 dollars. They don’t care about the economic reality of their demands, they just want what they want. They also refuse to understand that being a fast food cashier is a starter job, not a career. \nMany people warned them that their demand would have a negative impact on these jobs, as business owners would look for ways to work around them. That time has arrived. \nFormer McDonald’s CEO Ed Rensi writes at Forbes: \nThanks To ‘Fight For $15’ Minimum Wage, McDonald’s Unveils Job-Replacing Self-Service Kiosks Nationwide \nAs the labor union-backed Fight for $15 begins yet another nationwide strike on November 29, I have a simple message for the protest organizers and the reporters covering them: I told you so. \nIt brings me no joy to write these words. The push for a $15 starter wage has negatively impacted the career prospects of employees who were just getting started in the workforce while extinguishing the businesses that employed them. I wish it were not so. But it’s important to document these consequences, lest policymakers elsewhere decide that the $15 movement is worth embracing. \nLet’s start with automation. In 2013, when the Fight for $15 was still in its growth stage, I and others warned that union demands for a much higher minimum wage would force businesses with small profit margins to replace full-service employees with costly investments in self-service alternatives. At the time, labor groups accused business owners of crying wolf. It turns out the wolf was real. \nEarlier this month, McDonald’s announced the nationwide roll-out of touchscreen self-service kiosks. In a video the company released to showcase the new customer experience, it’s striking to see employees who once would have managed a cash register now reduced to monitoring a customer’s choices at an iPad-style kiosk. \nThis was always more about the unions than the workers. As large unions like the SEIU lost members and political bargaining power, they sought to inflate their ranks with fast food employees because it’s such a large segment of workers. It got the unions a lot of publicity but in the end, it is young people seeking a first job who will be hurt. \nHere’s the bottom line: \nThe out-of-state labor groups who funded these initiatives aren’t shedding tears over the consequences. Like their Soviet-era predecessors who foolishly thought they could centrally manage prices and business operations to fit an idealistic worldview, economic reality keeps ruining the model of all gain and no pain. This brings me to my last correct prediction, which is that the Fight for $15 was always more a creation of the left-wing Service Employees International Union (SEIU) rather than a legitimate grassroots effort. \nIt’s just further evidence that the left claims to care about the working man, but really doesn’t.

      "text": "  11:14am EST McDonald's drops supplier in Malaysia over worker exploitation claims By Beh Lih Yi \nKUALA LUMPUR (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Fast food giant McDonald's said it has dropped a labor supply agency in Malaysia after claims emerged that it was underpaying its migrant workers and housing them in appalling conditions. \nAn investigation by British newspaper the Guardian said the agency supplying workers to McDonald's was withholding their salaries, which were as low as 75 U.S. cents an hour, underpaying promised wages, and confiscating their passports. \nThe report was based on interviews with 15 Nepali workers who had worked at different McDonald's restaurants in the capital Kuala Lumpur. \nMcDonald's said it has ended its contract with the agency, Human Connection HR, and pledged staff welfare is a \"top priority\", with companies globally under mounting pressure to ensure their supply chains are free of slavery and exploitation. \n\"Earlier this year, we became aware of certain circumstances relating to services provided by Human Connection HR which were not in compliance with our standards,\" spokesman Ron Christianson said in a statement. \n\"As a result, we have terminated our contract with them.\" \nThere was no suggestion of any wrongdoing by McDonald's. Human Connection HR said it will hold a meeting and issue a response soon. \nChristianson would not confirm details of the exploitation, saying the workers were employees of the labor agency. \n\"Because the workers are not employees of McDonald's, our efforts to address the issues were unsuccessful, as were proposals for McDonald's to assume responsibility for paying workers directly,\" he said. \nHuman Connection HR had been supplying workers to McDonald's in Malaysia for \"a number of years\", Christianson added. \nHe said the company's suppliers were bound to uphold a code of conduct which includes safeguarding worker's rights. \nMcDonald's hires over 12,000 people in Malaysia, and less than 5 percent are foreign workers. \nMalaysia, which is Southeast Asia's third-largest economy, relies heavily on foreign workers especially in construction, plantation and domestic work, but human rights campaigners have long voiced concerns that they face widespread abuses. \nAegile Fernandez, director at Kuala Lumpur-based migrant rights group Tenaganita, said labor exploitation happens \"almost everyday\" among multinational firms in the country. \nShe urged McDonald's to take responsibility and ensure its supply chain is free of exploitation and slavery. \n\"They can't run away because they are the main company,\" she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. \n\"No matter if you're in the United States or Europe, you have to ensure your suppliers are following all the regulations and upholding the rights of the workers.\" \n(Reporting by Beh Lih Yi @behlihyi, Editing by Belinda Goldsmith; Please credit the Thomson Reuters Foundation, the charitable arm of Thomson Reuters, that covers humanitarian news, women's rights, trafficking, property rights and climate change.

      "text": "McDonald's Chicken McNuggets come in 4 shapes — and they have names! 2016-12-01T15:01:00.000Z comment () \nDo you prefer to dip your boot in creamy ranch or hot mustard? \nThat might sound like a strange question, but if you've ever enjoyed an order of McDonald's Chicken McNuggets, it's likely one you've pondered before — sort of. Alamy Stock \nNow, you may have seen a photo making the rounds on social media that describes one of the shapes as a bone: can you identify all 4?? the Boot, the Bell, the Ball, the Bone. pic.twitter.com/uNcvKQGUPp — maddie (@MaddieLand1) November 9, 2016 \nThat because McDonald's has called it that in the past , too. But over the years, in videos and statements, the company has used the term \"bow tie\" more often than \"bone\" (though to us, the shape looks a bit like a blob). \nRELATED: McDonald's customers cheesed off by lack of key ingredient in mozzarella sticks \n\"The 4 shapes we make Chicken McNuggets in was the equilibrium of dipability and fun,\" one McDonald's website wrote . \"3 would've been too few. 5 would've been, like, wacky. For now, our McNugget shapes are: the 'ball,' the 'boot' the 'bow tie' and the 'bell.' We also make them similar in size to ensure consistent cooking times for food safety.\" \nBut boot, ball, bell or bow tie (or bone), the important thing is that each shape begins with the letter B. \n\"Because, bud,\" the company wrote in reply to one customer . \"Beautifully built 'B' bites boost bliss, bypassing boredom.\" \nFollow Ree Hines on Twitter .",

      "text": "By Beh Lih Yi KUALA LUMPUR (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Fast food giant McDonald's said it has dropped a labor supply agency in Malaysia after claims emerged that it was underpaying its migrant workers and housing them in appalling conditions.\nAn investigation by British newspaper the Guardian said the agency supplying workers to McDonald's was withholding their salaries, which were as low as 75 U.S. cents an hour, underpaying promised wages, and confiscating their passports.\nThe report was based on interviews with 15 Nepali workers who had worked at different McDonald's restaurants in the capital Kuala Lumpur.\nMcDonald's said it has ended its contract with the agency, Human Connection HR, and pledged staff welfare is a \"top priority\", with companies globally under mounting pressure to ensure their supply chains are free of slavery and exploitation.\n\"Earlier this year, we became aware of certain circumstances relating to services provided by Human Connection HR which were not in compliance with our standards,\" spokesman Ron Christianson said in a statement.\n\"As a result, we have terminated our contract with them.\"\nThere was no suggestion of any wrongdoing by McDonald's. Human Connection HR said it will hold a meeting and issue a response soon.\nChristianson would not confirm details of the exploitation, saying the workers were employees of the labor agency.\n\"Because the workers are not employees of McDonald's, our efforts to address the issues were unsuccessful, as were proposals for McDonald's to assume responsibility for paying workers directly,\" he said.\nHuman Connection HR had been supplying workers to McDonald's in Malaysia for \"a number of years\", Christianson added.\nHe said the company's suppliers were bound to uphold a code of conduct which includes safeguarding worker's rights.\nMcDonald's hires over 12,000 people in Malaysia, and less than 5 percent are foreign workers.\nMalaysia, which is Southeast Asia's third-largest economy, relies heavily on foreign workers especially in construction, plantation and domestic work, but human rights campaigners have long voiced concerns that they face widespread abuses.\nAegile Fernandez, director at Kuala Lumpur-based migrant rights group Tenaganita, said labor exploitation happens \"almost everyday\" among multinational firms in the country.\nShe urged McDonald's to take responsibility and ensure its supply chain is free of exploitation and slavery.\n\"They can't run away because they are the main company,\" she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.\n\"No matter if you're in the United States or Europe, you have to ensure your suppliers are following all the regulations and upholding the rights of the workers.\"\n(Reporting by Beh Lih Yi @behlihyi, Editing by Belinda Goldsmith; Please credit the Thomson Reuters Foundation, the charitable arm of Thomson Reuters, that covers humanitarian news, women's rights, trafficking, property rights and climate change.

      "text": "The guard, who eventually got the baton back and subdued 25-year-old McDonald, was later treated and released at a local hospital, the spokesman said. \nMcDonald, who also required for treatment of two lacerations, was transferred to another institution, Herrera said. \nThe prisoner was among those who met at 12th and Main streets in Santa Ana on Aug. 12, 2014, for a drug deal. Around 11:30 that night, McDonald drove an SUV up to a parked sedan with a 21-year-old woman behind the wheel, Aaron Jonathan Chavez in the front passenger seat and a 28-year-old female riding in the back. \nMcDonald then stepped out of his ride, walked around to the front passenger side of the sedan, pulled out a firearm and fired around 10 shots. The trio inside the sedan were hit multiple times by rounds from McDonald's gun. Chavez, 23, died at the scene. The woman were taken to a local hospital but ultimately survived their injuries. \nAfter surveillance video from the area of the shooting was studied, McDonald was stopped by Santa Ana cops the next evening as he drove near his residence and was arrested.

      "text": "  \nLike the black Nando’s card and the Gregg’s VIP card, McDonald’s also has its own gold card – but it seems like it’s a lot harder to get your hands on than any of those. Featured Image VIA \nThose cards you seem to be able to get just from being a celebrity, but with the gold card it’s pretty different. Only a few people have revealed that they’re actually in possession of one, so here’s a list, with the reasons if we know them: \nMillionaire Warren Buffet – probably because he was a millionaire \nBill Gates – likewise \nRob Lowe – because his dad’s friend invented the Egg McMuffin. He can only get free nuggets in the Santa Barbara area though \nA man named Charles Ramsey – he left his Big Mac half eaten to come to the aid of three kidnapped women \n100-year-old Nadine Baum – given a certificate rather than a card for being such a loyal customer, but received free food for life too Image VIA \nSo it just seems like they’re given out for whatever reasons McDonald’s decides on the day right? Here’s what an official McDonald’s spokesperson said though: \nIndividual stores will make a call on the individual, for example a regular customer or local/national hero, but there is no policy in the UK of giving away food to people and no plans to introduce it. \nSorry to be a let-down, but the McDonald’s gold card does not exist in the UK. \nWell, that’s a major bummer but at least we know how to get one in America now. If you’ve got any friends over there, get them to fake a kidnapping or mugging or something so that next time you go over to visit them you can get free food. Perfect. If you haven’t got any friends in America though I guess you’re fucked.",

Delligatti, the Pittsburgh-area McDonald's franchisee who created the Big Mac in 1967, has died. He was 98. (AP Photo/Gene J. Puskar, File) \nUpdated at 12:21 p.m. \nPITTSBURGH • You probably don't know his name, but you've almost certainly devoured his creation: two all-beef patties, special sauce, lettuce, cheese, pickles, onions, on a sesame seed bun. \nMichael James \"Jim\" Delligatti, the McDonald's franchisee who created the Big Mac nearly 50 years ago and saw it become perhaps the best-known fast-food sandwich in the world, died Monday at home in Pittsburgh. Delligatti, who according to his son ate at least one 540-calorie Big Mac a week for decades, was 98. \nDelligatti's franchise was based in Uniontown, not far from Pittsburgh, when he invented the chain's signature burger in 1967 after deciding customers wanted a bigger sandwich. Demand exploded as Delligatti's sandwich spread to the rest of his 47 stores in Pennsylvania and was added to the chain's national menu in 1968. \n\"He was often asked why he named it the Big Mac, and he said because Big Mc sounded too funny,\" his son Michael Delligatti said. \nJim Delligatti told The Associated Press in 2006 that McDonald's resisted the idea at first because its simple lineup of hamburgers, cheeseburgers, fries and shakes was selling well. \n\"They figured, why go to something else if (the original menu) was working so well?\" Delligatti said then. \nMcDonald's has sold billions of Big Macs since then, in more than 100 countries. When the burger turned 40, McDonald's estimated it was selling 550 million Big Macs a year, or roughly 17 every second. Delligatti received no payment or royalties for coming up with the burger, the company said. \n\"Delligatti was a legendary franchisee within McDonald's system who made a lasting impression on our brand,\" the Oak Brook, Illinois-based company said Wednesday in a statement. The Big Mac \"has become an iconic sandwich enjoyed by many around the world.\" \nAnn Dugan, a former assistant dean of the University of Pittsburgh's Katz School of Business and an expert on business franchises, said Jim Delligatti's genius was simple: He listened to customers who wanted a bigger burger.",

Delligatti, the Pittsburgh-area McDonald's franchisee who created the Big Mac in 1967, has died. He was 98. (AP Photo/Gene J. Puskar, File) \nPITTSBURGH (AP) — You probably don’t know his name, but you’ve almost certainly devoured his creation: two all-beef patties, special sauce, lettuce, cheese, pickles, onions, on a sesame-seed bun. \nMichael James “Jim” Delligatti, the McDonald’s franchisee who created the Big Mac nearly 50 years ago and saw it become perhaps the best-known fast-food sandwich in the world, died Monday at home in Pittsburgh. Delligatti, who according to his son ate at least one 540-calorie Big Mac a week for decades, was 98. \nDelligatti’s franchise was based in Uniontown, not far from Pittsburgh, when he invented the chain’s signature burger in 1967 after deciding customers wanted a bigger sandwich. Demand exploded as Delligatti’s sandwich spread to the rest of his 47 stores in Pennsylvania and was added to the chain’s national menu in 1968. \n“He was often asked why he named it the Big Mac, and he said because Big Mc sounded too funny,” his son Michael Delligatti said. \nJim Delligatti told The Associated Press in 2006 that McDonald’s resisted the idea at first because its simple lineup of hamburgers, cheeseburgers, fries and shakes was selling well. \n“They figured, why go to something else if (the original menu) was working so well?” Delligatti said then. \nMcDonald’s has sold billions of Big Macs since then, in more than 100 countries. When the burger turned 40, McDonald’s estimated it was selling 550 million Big Macs a year, or roughly 17 every second. Delligatti received no payment or royalties for coming up with the burger, the company said. \n“Delligatti was a legendary franchisee within McDonald’s system who made a lasting impression on our brand,” the Oak Brook, Illinois-based company said Wednesday in a statement. The Big Mac “has become an iconic sandwich enjoyed by many around the world.” \nAnn Dugan, a former assistant dean of the University of Pittsburgh’s Katz School of Business and an expert on business franchises, said Jim Delligatti’s genius was simple: He listened to customers who wanted a bigger burger. \n“In franchising, there’s always this set playbook and you have to follow it. Jim saw an opportunity to go outside the playbook because he knew the customer,” Dugan said. “He persevered and (McDonald’s) listened, and the rest is history.” \nDelligatti headed M&J Management, a four-generation family business and McDonald’s franchise organization, for more than 60 years. He opened his first McDonald’s in Pittsburgh’s North Hills suburbs in 1957. In 1979, he co-founded Pittsburgh’s Ronald McDonald House, then the seventh such facility in the country, where families can stay when children travel to Pittsburgh for life-saving medical care, and he was involved in several other charities. \nDelligatti also helped introduce breakfast service at McDonald’s, developing the hotcakes and sausage meal to feed hungry steelworkers on their way home from overnight shifts in the mills, his family said. \nIn addition to his two sons, Jim Delligatti is survived by his wife, Ellie, five grandchildren and eight great-grandchildren. \nThe Devlin Funeral Home near Pittsburgh is handling visitation Thursday and Friday. Delligatti’s funeral will be held Saturday at St. Joseph’s Parish in O’Hara Township. ❯❯ Click the Icon below to share this post... ",

She was a 21-year-old secretary for the company's advertising department in 1967 when, the story goes, a harried executive dashing to a board meeting asked her for a name nomination. \nJim Delligatti's family disputes that Rose came up with the idea.

      "text": "Tweet Published: 1:  \nKUALA LUMPUR (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Fast food giant McDonald's said it has dropped a labor supply agency in Malaysia after claims emerged that it was underpaying its migrant workers and housing them in appalling conditions. \nAn investigation by British newspaper the Guardian said the agency supplying workers to McDonald's was withholding their salaries, which were as low as 75 U.S. cents an hour, underpaying promised wages, and confiscating their passports. \nThe report was based on interviews with 15 Nepali workers who had worked at different McDonald's restaurants in the capital Kuala Lumpur. \nMcDonald's said it has ended its contract with the agency, Human Connection HR, and pledged staff welfare is a \"top priority\", with companies globally under mounting pressure to ensure their supply chains are free of slavery and exploitation. \n\"Earlier this year, we became aware of certain circumstances relating to services provided by Human Connection HR which were not in compliance with our standards,\" spokesman Ron Christianson said in a statement. \n\"As a result, we have terminated our contract with them.\" \nThere was no suggestion of any wrongdoing by McDonald's. Human Connection HR said it will hold a meeting and issue a response soon. \nChristianson would not confirm details of the exploitation, saying the workers were employees of the labor agency. \n\"Because the workers are not employees of McDonald's, our efforts to address the issues were unsuccessful, as were proposals for McDonald's to assume responsibility for paying workers directly,\" he said. \nHuman Connection HR had been supplying workers to McDonald's in Malaysia for \"a number of years\", Christianson added. \nHe said the company's suppliers were bound to uphold a code of conduct which includes safeguarding worker's rights. \nMcDonald's hires over 12,000 people in Malaysia, and less than 5 percent are foreign workers. \nMalaysia, which is Southeast Asia's third-largest economy, relies heavily on foreign workers especially in construction, plantation and domestic work, but human rights campaigners have long voiced concerns that they face widespread abuses. \nAegile Fernandez, director at Kuala Lumpur-based migrant rights group Tenaganita, said labor exploitation happens \"almost everyday\" among multinational firms in the country. \nShe urged McDonald's to take responsibility and ensure its supply chain is free of exploitation and slavery. \n\"They can't run away because they are the main company,\" she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. \n\"No matter if you're in the United States or Europe, you have to ensure your suppliers are following all the regulations and upholding the rights of the workers.\" REUTERS",

      "text": "Tuesday, November 29th, 2016, 2:15pm   McDonald’s franchise owner Joe Ferrino, left, recently presented a check for $3,500 on behalf of Ronald McDonald House Charities of WNY to Frank Cerny, executive director of the Rural Outreach Center (ROC) in East Aurora. The funds will support the ROC’s outreach to and support of children, including the play therapy, winter readiness and back-to-school backpack programs. Part of the ROC's strategic plan is to focus on children to break the cycle of generational poverty. The grant monies used to support this award were raised through the efforts of McDonald's restaurants in the Western New York community, and in part by national McDonald's promotional programs. Ronald McDonald House Charities provides lodging, comfort and emotional support to families of children receiving medical treatment at area hospitals, and reaches out to families in the community by supporting programs that benefit children.

      "text": "The person behind McDonald’s iconic Big Mac has died. Michael “Jim” Delligatti, who created the burger almost 50 years ago, was 98. McDonald’s spokeswoman Kerry Ford reportedly confirmed that Delligatti died at home surrounded by his family late Monday. As one of the company’s first franchisees, Delligatti started offering the Big Mac — for 45 cents — at his store in Uniontown, Pennsylvania, spreading to 47 of his other McDonald’s outlets across the country.\nIn an interview with the Associated Press in 2006, Delligatti said the company was initially averse to the idea of the new burger as their existing menu of hamburgers, cheeseburgers, fries and shakes was doing reasonable well. However, Delligatti wanted to offer a bigger, better burger.\nIn 1967, he decided to double the ingredients of a regular burger — beef patties, lettuce, cheese, pickles, onions and special sauce — and put out a new variation.\n“The first day we just used the regular bun, we didn't have any centre [bread] slice,” Delligatti  told Reuters in 2007 . “Making it that way made it very sloppy. The next day we put the centre slice in, and today it looks the same.”\nMcDonald’s gauged the popularity of the Big Mac and went national with it in 1968.\nThe star of the seven-ingredient burger is undoubtedly the so-called “secret sauce.” Last year, McDonald's auctioned off a bottle of the sauce on eBay, attracting bids of more than $18,000.\nMcDonald’s described Delligatti as a “legendary” person, who “made a lasting impression on our brand.” A McDonald’s spokesperson told BBC’s Newsbeat : “[Jim] is an exemplary individual who embraced the community and championed many causes and organizations that benefitted children.”\n“We will remember Jim as an insightful franchisee, a knowledgeable businessman, and an honourable gentleman who left a legacy of four generations of family members running great restaurants in Pennsylvania and North Carolina.”\nMcDonald’s has over 36,000 outlets in more than 100 countries where more than 900 million Big Macs are sold annually. However, McDonald's says Delligatti received no payment for the creating the company’s iconic burger, ABC reported .\nDelligatti remained the burger’s biggest fan and, according to his son, consumed at least one Big Mac every week for decades.\nRelated Articles \nMcDonald's Has Big Plans For The Big Mac The Global Economy: Minutes Of Minimum-Wage Work To Buy A Big Mac",

      "text": "Creator of McDonald’s iconic Big Mac burger dies at 98 world Updated: Dec 01, 2016 17:50 IST Reuters In an undated handout photo, Jim Delligatti holds two Big Mac burgers. (Agencies) \nThe man behind one of the most recognisable fast-food sandwiches, McDonald’s Big Mac, died this week at age 98. \nMichael James Delligatti invented the Big Mac - two beef patties on a hamburger bun - which debuted at a McDonald’s restaurant in Uniontown, Pennsylvania, in 1967. \nMcDonald’s tweeted a message on Wednesday celebrating Delligatti’s contribution to the fast-food company where he was a franchisee. \n“Today, we celebrate the 98 inspirational years of Big Mac inventor, Michael “Jim” Delligatti. Jim, we thank and will forever remember you”, the company said. \nUS media reported that Delligatti died at his Pennsylvania home on Monday. \nIn a 2007 interview with Reuters, Delligatti said it took two years to convince McDonald’s that the Big Mac was a good idea. \n“I felt that we needed a big sandwich,” he said. “But you couldn’t do anything unless they gave you permission.” \nThe contents of the sandwich, immortalised by the popular jingle “two-all-beef-patties-special-sauce-lettuce-cheese-pickles-onions-on-a-sesame-seed-bun” are generally the same worldwide, although prices and nutrition value varies. \nThe US version of the Big Mac contains about 540 calories, 28 grams of fat and 25 grams of protein, according to the McDonald’s website. \nOver the years the Big Mac’s ubiquity has come to mirror that of the Golden Arches itself. It is used to track the value of foreign currencies against the US dollar in a “Big Mac Index” published by The Economist magazine. tags ",

      "text": "December 1, 2016 AT 3:23 PM \nLast Updated: December 1, 2016 3:23 pm Employees work at a McDonald's in in Beijing in 2007. (FREDERIC J. BROWN/AFP/Getty Images) \nAs McDonald’s employees protest for a $15 per hour minimum wage, the fast food chain may have plans to replace them, said the former CEO. \nA number of minimum protesters were arrested on Tuesday across the country, including in Chicago, Detroit, Houston, Los Angeles, Minneapolis, and New York, The Associated Press reported. \n“We’re not asking for special treatment, we’re asking for decent treatment. We’re asking for decent wages,” said protester Kisha Rivera. “We’re demanding respect.” \nBut the protests might spell the doom for wage protesters who work at McDonald’s: the chain earlier this month rolled out self-serving kiosks at select locations. \nOn Tuesday, former McDonald’s CEO Ed Rensi said that the wage protests have spurred on the kiosks. \n“It brings me no joy to write these words,” Rensi wrote for Forbes . “The push for a $15 starter wage has negatively impacted the career prospects of employees who were just getting started in the workforce while extinguishing the businesses that employed them. I wish it were not so. But it’s important to document these consequences, lest policymakers elsewhere decide that the $15 movement is worth embracing.” \nHe added: \nIt’s not just McDonald’s that has embraced job-replacing technology. Numerous restaurant chains (both quick service and full service) have looked to computer tablets as a solution for rising labor costs that won’t adversely impact the customer’s experience. Eatsa, a fully-automated restaurant concept, now has five locations—all in cities or states that have embraced a $15 minimum wage. \nA raise in the minimum wage would harm employees’ prospects, Rensi said, adding it would “wipe out thousands of entry-level opportunities for people without many other options.” \nMore than 500 locations in Florida, New York, and California will have the new feature, it was reported . Later, Boston, Washington D.C., Chicago, Seattle, and San Francisco will have the kiosks. \nMcDonald’s president Chris Kempczinski said rolling out the kiosks in the cities was “very purposeful” as they are “trendsetting” markets, Fortune magazine reported .

      "text": " 11 pm - Updated December 1, 2016 03:13 pm By Associated Press Creator of McDonald’s flagship sandwich, the Big Mac, dies \nIn this Aug. 21, 2008, file photo, Big Mac creator Michael “Jim” Delligatti attends his 90th birthday party in Canonsburg, Pa. Delligatti, the Pittsburgh-area McDonald’s franchisee who created the Big Mac in 1967, has died. He was 98. (Associated Press) \nIn this Aug. 21, 2008, file photo, Big Mac creator Michael “Jim” Delligatti sits behind a Big Mac birthday cake at his 90th birthday party in Canonsburg, Pa. (Associated Press) \nPITTSBURGH — You probably don’t know his name, but you’ve almost certainly devoured his creation: two all-beef patties, special sauce, lettuce, cheese, pickles, onions, on a sesame seed bun. \nMichael James “Jim” Delligatti, the McDonald’s franchisee who created the Big Mac nearly 50 years ago and saw it become perhaps the best-known fast-food sandwich in the world, died Monday at home in Pittsburgh. Delligatti, who according to his son ate at least one 540-calorie Big Mac a week for decades, was 98. \nDelligatti’s franchise was based in Uniontown, not far from Pittsburgh, when he invented the chain’s signature burger in 1967 after deciding customers wanted a bigger sandwich. Demand exploded as Delligatti’s sandwich spread to the rest of his 47 stores in Pennsylvania and was added to the chain’s national menu in 1968. \n“He was often asked why he named it the Big Mac, and he said because Big Mc sounded too funny,” his son Michael Delligatti said. \nHowever, McDonald’s in 1985 honored Esther Glickstein Rose with coming up for a name for the burger and presented her with a plaque etched with a likeness of the best-selling sandwich and french fries between the Golden Arches. She was a 21-year-old secretary for the company’s advertising department in 1967 when, the story goes, a harried executive dashing to a board meeting asked her for a name nomination. \nJim Delligatti’s family disputes that Rose came up with the idea. The company didn’t immediately clear up the dispute Wednesday. \nDelligatti told The Associated Press in 2006 that McDonald’s resisted the idea at first because its simple lineup of hamburgers, cheeseburgers, fries and shakes was selling well. \n“They figured, why go to something else if (the original menu) was working so well?” Delligatti said then. \nMcDonald’s has sold billions of Big Macs since then, in more than 100 countries. When the burger turned 40, McDonald’s estimated it was selling 550 million Big Macs a year, or roughly 17 every second. Delligatti received no payment or royalties for coming up with the burger, the company said. \n“Delligatti was a legendary franchisee within McDonald’s system who made a lasting impression on our brand,” the Oak Brook, Illinois-based company said Wednesday in a statement. The Big Mac “has become an iconic sandwich enjoyed by many around the world.” \nAnn Dugan, a former assistant dean of the University of Pittsburgh’s Katz School of Business and an expert on business franchises, said Jim Delligatti’s genius was simple: He listened to customers who wanted a bigger burger. \n“In franchising, there’s always this set playbook and you have to follow it. Jim saw an opportunity to go outside the playbook because he knew the customer,” Dugan said. “He persevered and (McDonald’s) listened, and the rest is history.” \nDelligatti headed M&J Management, a four-generation family business and McDonald’s franchise organization, for more than 60 years. He opened his first McDonald’s in Pittsburgh’s North Hills suburbs in 1957. In 1979, he co-founded Pittsburgh’s Ronald McDonald House, then the seventh such facility in the country, where families can stay when children travel to Pittsburgh for life-saving medical care, and he was involved in several other charities. \nDelligatti also helped introduce breakfast service at McDonald’s, developing the hotcakes and sausage meal to feed hungry steelworkers on their way home from overnight shifts in the mills, his family said. \nIn addition to his two sons, Jim Delligatti is survived by his wife, Ellie, five grandchildren and eight great-grandchildren. \nThe Devlin Funeral Home near Pittsburgh is handling visitation Thursday and Friday. Delligatti’s funeral will be held Saturday at St. Joseph’s Parish in O’Hara Township. Advertisement",

      "text": "McDonald's first chief digital officer, who oversaw huge advancements in the burger giant's technology efforts, has left the company to join Volvo Car Group.\nAtif Rafiq, 43, had been with McDonald's for just over three years. A veteran of Yahoo and Amazon.com, Rafiq was hired by McDonald's to bring the world's largest burger chain into the future with digital and mobile initiatives intended to engage younger consumers.\nHis departure comes at a critical time for the fast-food giant. Two weeks ago, McDonald's announced a bold plan to roll out kiosk ordering and table service to its restaurants nationwide, starting with those in big cities. During his tenure with the company, Rafiq helped develop kiosks and table service, which relies on Bluetooth-enabled markers that show workers where a customer is sitting.

Personnel changes have been made in several key positions, including U.S. division president, as CEO Steve Easterbrook attempts to keep the momentum going from new initiatives like all-day breakfast.\nIn a statement, McDonald's said that Rafiq's \"departure provides an opportunity to further align our structure as we accelerate the digital experience our customers want.\"\nJim Sappington, executive vice president of operations, digital and technology now will oversee all restaurant operations, tech and digital teams, the Oak Brook-based company said.\nMcDonald's exec heads to Dunkin' Donuts; burger chain says he will forfeit job perks Samantha Bomkamp A longtime McDonald's executive who resigned abruptly last week has been named the new president of Dunkin' Donuts in the U.S. and Canada.\nDavid Hoffmann was the president of McDonald's high-growth segment, which includes countries like China and Russia.

      "title": "Big Mac creator, Michael 'Jim' Delligatti, dies",
      "text": "Nearly 50 years ago, Michael James “Jim” Dellagatti, a McDonald’s franchisee in Uniontown, Penn., decided that his customers wanted a bigger sandwich.\nHe slapped together two beef patties, a tangy sauce, lettuce, cheese, pickles, onions, and three layers of sesame seed bun. He called it the Big Mac – and the fast-food sandwich became a big hit in his other 47 stores in Pennsylvania, eventually gaining a spot in the chain’s national menu in 1968.\nDelligatti, who died on Monday, was seen as an innovator at the time by pushing initially skeptical McDonald’s corporate headquarters to expand its servings beyond just the simple hamburgers, cheeseburgers, fries, and shakes that were selling well. The need for change, however, is just as present now, as the fast food chain struggles to maintain its customer base, who are increasingly looking for healthier and specialized options.\nRecommended: What kind of an eater are you? \"In franchising, there's always this set playbook and you have to follow it. Jim saw an opportunity to go outside the playbook because he knew the customer,\" Ann Dugan, a former assistant dean of the University of Pittsburgh's Katz School of Business, told the Associated Press. \"He persevered and [McDonald's] listened, and the rest is history.\"\nWhat kind of an eater are you? In his lifetime, McDonald's has sold billions of Big Macs in more than 100 countries, with estimations that it was selling 550 million Big Macs a year when the burger turned 40. But in July 2016, a top McDonald’s franchisee wrote in a memo that the Big Mac “has gotten less relevant,” with the number of hamburgers sold at McDonald’s US restaurants staying flat over the past few years , as reported by the Wall Street Journal.\nCustomers, especially Millennials, were flocking to places that sold food with higher-quality ingredients, opting for fast-casual chains such as Panera Bread, Chipotle, Shake Shack Inc. and Five Guys Holdings LLC, all of which are growing faster than McDonald’s.\nIn a bid to catch up with its consumers’ demands, the chain has been experimenting with improving taste by longer toast times so the burgers turn out warmer, and injecting healthier components into its classic menu items.\nFor instance, the company is removing artificial ingredients from Chicken McNuggets and other products. It is also experimenting with fresh beef instead of frozen beef in some restaurants' burgers, planning to phase out chickens raised with antibiotics, and even entertained adding kale-based items into its menu.\nThe challenge of these innovations lies in having to maintain quick serving times and low prices while still delivering higher-quality fast food. Some of its competitors, such as Burger King and Wendy’s, face the same problems.\n“Customers loved the taste but said, ‘We don’t have 10 minutes,’ ” Alex Williams, an executive in charge of an initiative to speed up drive-through service while creating custom burgers, told The Wall Street Journal.\nBut the chain store has seen its fair share of innovations, with other franchisees inventing the now-popular Egg McMuffin and the Filet-O-Fish. Delligatti had also introduced the breakfast option – hotcakes and sausages – to McDonald’s, serving the needs of hungry steelworkers returning home early in the morning after their night shifts.\nThis report contains material from the Associated Press.",

      "text": "McDonald's Hit by Downgrade (MCD) By Investopedia | December 1, 2016 — 11:17 AM EST \nMcDonald’s Corporation ( MCD ) has been downgraded by a Guggenheim analyst, but this isn’t your average downgrade. There is much debate on the street about whether or not upgrades and downgrades are legit. The answer to that question is simple: It depends on the analyst. In this case, the downgrade is legit. \nThe Guggenheim analyst that downgraded MCD is Matthew Difrisco. If you look at his TipRanks profile, you will see that his picks have been 88% accurate since 2009, with an average return of 29.7%. This doesn’t mean Difrisco will continue to be so accurate in the future, but it certainly gives his downgrade credibility. \nDifrisco downgraded MCD to “neutral” from “buy” and maintained a $127 price target. The reasons for the downgrade were provided on The Fly. Those reasons are summed up here: Increased potential for macroeconomic headwinds due to rising gas prices Higher interest rates negatively impacting franchisee investments Expectation of near-term negative comps sales Increased risk to 2017 earnings upside due to a strong U.S. dollar \nMCD has suffered quarterly revenue and earnings declines of 2.90% and 2.60%, respectively, year over year. Despite that being the case, the stock has appreciated 4.21% over the past 12 months. This is in addition to a generous 3.12% dividend yield . \nIn addition to the headwinds listed above, McDonald’s is battling against the rise of the health-conscious consumer and increased competition. The company’s strong international brand name and $6.62 billion in operating cash flow (trailing twelve months) are its biggest assets. The latter allows for consistent dividend payments, the ability to buy back shares , and spending on innovation and marketing, which then gives McDonald's an opportunity to steal market share from peers. It’s a tug-of-war battle between McDonald’s fighting to stay on top and natural consumer forces wanting to bring it down.

REUTERS/Carlos Barria/File Photo \nDecember 1, 2016 \n(Reuters) – A consortium led by private-equity firm Carlyle Group <CG.O> and Chinese conglomerate Citic Group Corp has neared a deal to buy McDonald’s Corp’s <MCD.N> stores in China and Hong Kong for up to $3 billion, a source with direct knowledge of the matter said. \nThe deal is likely to be signed before Christmas, the source said. \nReuters had reported in October that U.S. buyout firms Carlyle and Bain Capital LLC had been the front runners among the bidders for the fast-food giant’s China assets. \nMcDonald’s in March said it was reorganizing operations in Asia, bringing in partners as it switches to a less capital-intensive franchise model. \nThe company hired Morgan Stanley <MS.N> to run the sale of about 2,400 restaurants in China and Hong Kong. \nFinancial Times reported earlier on Wednesday that Bain Capital had dropped out of the race, and that a group led by Citic Group and Carlyle were the front runners to the deal. \nCarlyle declined to comment, while McDonald’s was not immediately available for a comment. \n(Reporting by Denny Thomas in Hong Kong and Gayathree Ganesan in Bengaluru; Editing by Anil D’Silva)",

In addition to mobile order and pay, the chain is expanding its “Experience of the Future” to locations in more markets in 2017. \nThe departure also comes amid a wave of executive changes at the chain, which named Steve Easterbrook CEO last year. Mike Andres, the chain’s president, and Pete Bensen, chief administrative officer, both announced their retirements this summer. In addition longtime executive Dave Hoffman, who led McDonald’s high-growth division, took a job with Dunkin’ Donuts in September. \nRafiq was named McDonald’s first chief digital officer in 2013 and in more recent years the company announced plans to beef up its digital efforts, hiring hundreds of new people. He had previously worked with technology companies like Amazon, Yahoo! and AOL. \nContact Jonathan Maze at Follow him on Twitter at @jonathanmaze \n​Photo courtesy of McDonald's",

Click here to submit a Letter to the Editor , and we may publish it in print. \nVolvo Cars has named Atif Rafiq its first chief digital officer, luring the longtime Silicon Valley executive from the McDonald's, where he built the fast food giant's digital unit from scratch. \nVolvo is looking for Rafiq to lead the company's continued digital transformation. That includes \"helping to evolve how consumers interact with Volvo cars across the buying, driving, entertainment and service experience,\" Volvo said in a statement. \nRafiq will oversee the \"consumer-facing applications, digital touchpoints and enterprise systems supporting the company's products, processes and services,\" Volvo said. \nRafiq, 43, will succeed Klas Bendrik, who has been Volvo's senior vice president for group IT and chief information officer since 2010. Bendrik, 47, will help Rafiq transition into his new job, which he starts Jan. 2, and will then leave Volvo for a new position, the automaker said. \nSpeeding up development \nVolvo CEO Hakan Samuelsson said in the statement Thursday that Volvo chose Rafiq because the company needs to rethink how customers buy its cars and how the automaker interacts with its customers after the purchase. Rafiq“is \"ideally qualified\" to speed up our development in this area, Samuelsson said. \nRafiq set up McDonald's Silicon Valley outpost in 2014 to better train and recruit digital talent. Projects he has overseen include tests of mobile ordering and payment, as well as McDonald's World Cup effort, which included an augmented reality game. Before joining McDonald's he held general management roles at Amazon, Yahoo, and AOL. Representatives for McDonald's did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Rafiq's departure. \nVolvo's pending tech initiatives include implementing what it describes as \"the world's largest autonomous driving experiment\" starting next year. \nThe automaker's Drive Me pilot will put 100 families in autonomously driven XC90 on roads around Gothenburg, Sweden. Volvo also has a deal in the U.S. with Uber to develop cars for autonomous driving. \n\"In many ways, the development of cars that are autonomous, electrified and connected overlap,\" Samuelsson said. Rafiq will help ensure that all of these developments are pursued in a \"cohesive, strategic and technologically advanced way, the CEO said. \nThe auto industry is facing \"its biggest inflection point in literally 100 years,\" Rafiq said in the statement. \"Whether it's new technologies like computer vision and machine learning, or changing consumer behaviors around sharing and mobility, the scope for leveraging digitization is huge. I see in Volvo a company that has fully embraced these challenges and can lead the industry into the future.\" \nRafiq's LinkedIn profile says he has built his career within the Internet over 18 years. He calls himself a \"digital native senior executive\" and says his background is steeped in e-commerce, mobile, digital media, social media and retail. \nBefore joining McDonald's as its first chief digital officer in 2013, Rafiq was at Amazon, where he says he helped to give shape to the future of content and books, through my work in Kindle. Prior to that he says he helped AOL pioneer the idea of an Internet portal and helped the company dominate web 1.0. \nLots of changes \nRafiq's arrival pending arrival is the latest in a series of personnel changes at the top of Volvo's organizational chart. When Bendrik departs in 2017 he will be the third member of Volvo executive management team to exit the company in less than a year. \nLast week Audi said Volvo r&d boss Peter Mertens would become its board member for technical development \"as soon as possible\" while Lars Wrebo stepped down as head of manufacturing and logistics in September. \nVolvo has not named Mertens' replacement yet, while Wrebo was succeeded by former PSA Group executive Javier Varela on Nov. 2. Varela spent 26 years at PSA, where he last served as executive vice president of the French automaker's joint venture with Toyota Motor in the Czech Republic. \nJessica Wohl of Ad Age contributed to this report You can reach Douglas A.

According to the report, an agreement is expected to be inked before Christmas. Such a deal would bring to a close the saga of what will happen with the McDonald’s stores located in China and Hong Kong, with reports over the past few months...

      "text": "PITTSBURGH — You probably don’t know his name, but you’ve almost certainly devoured his creation: two all-beef patties, special sauce, lettuce, cheese, pickles, onions, on a sesame seed bun. Michael James “Jim” Delligatti, the McDonald’s franchisee who created the Big Mac nearly 50 years ago and saw it become perhaps the best-known fast-food sandwich in the world, died Monday at home in Pittsburgh. Delligatti, who according to his son ate at least one 540-calorie Big Mac a week for decades, was 98.\nDelligatti’s franchise was based in Uniontown, not far from Pittsburgh, when he invented the chain’s signature burger in 1967 after deciding customers wanted a bigger sandwich. Demand exploded as Delligatti’s sandwich spread to the rest of his 47 stores in Pennsylvania and was added to the chain’s national menu in 1968.\n“He was often asked why he named it the Big Mac, and he said because Big Mc sounded too funny,” his son Michael Delligatti said.\nHowever, McDonald’s in 1985 honored Esther Glickstein Rose with coming up for a name for the burger and presented her with a plaque etched with a likeness of the best-selling sandwich and french fries between the Golden Arches. She was a 21-year-old secretary for the company’s advertising department in 1967 when, the story goes, a harried executive dashing to a board meeting asked her for a name nomination.\nJim Delligatti’s family disputes that Rose came up with the idea. The company didn’t immediately clear up the dispute Wednesday.\nDelligatti told The Associated Press in 2006 that McDonald’s resisted the idea at first because its simple lineup of hamburgers, cheeseburgers, fries and shakes was selling well.\n“They figured, why go to something else if (the original menu) was working so well?” Delligatti said then.\nMcDonald’s has sold billions of Big Macs since then, in more than 100 countries. When the burger turned 40, McDonald’s estimated it was selling 550 million Big Macs a year, or roughly 17 every second. Delligatti received no payment or royalties for coming up with the burger, the company said.\n“Delligatti was a legendary franchisee within McDonald’s system who made a lasting impression on our brand,” the Oak Brook, Illinois-based company said Wednesday in a statement. The Big Mac “has become an iconic sandwich enjoyed by many around the world.”\nAnn Dugan, a former assistant dean of the University of Pittsburgh’s Katz School of Business and an expert on business franchises, said Jim Delligatti’s genius was simple: He listened to customers who wanted a bigger burger.\n“In franchising, there’s always this set playbook and you have to follow it. Jim saw an opportunity to go outside the playbook because he knew the customer,” Dugan said. “He persevered and (McDonald’s) listened, and the rest is history.”\nDelligatti headed M&J Management, a four-generation family business and McDonald’s franchise organization, for more than 60 years. He opened his first McDonald’s in Pittsburgh’s North Hills suburbs in 1957. In 1979, he co-founded Pittsburgh’s Ronald McDonald House, then the seventh such facility in the country, where families can stay when children travel to Pittsburgh for life-saving medical care, and he was involved in several other charities.\nDelligatti also helped introduce breakfast service at McDonald’s, developing the hotcakes and sausage meal to feed hungry steelworkers on their way home from overnight shifts in the mills, his family said.\nIn addition to his two sons, Jim Delligatti is survived by his wife, Ellie, five grandchildren and eight great-grandchildren.\nThe Devlin Funeral Home near Pittsburgh is handling visitation Thursday and Friday. Delligatti’s funeral will be held Saturday at St. Joseph’s Parish in O’Hara Township.",

      "title": "McDonald's Has A Secret Gold Card For All The Free McDick's You Can Eat",
      "text": "McDonald's Has A Secret Gold Card For All The Free McDick's You Can Eat Favorite by Rebecca-Martinson on 6 hours ago 2,814 Previous | Next \nGetting free food is not hard. As a girl, all I really have to do is show up to any given fast food restaurant past midnight, act slightly intoxicated and pathetic, then ask random people for shit off the dollar menu in the most pitiful way possible. Maybe drop a line or two about how my phone is dead or how I dropped it in a toilet and can't contact anyone, possibly shed a tear or two...it's not hard. \nSame strategy works for dudes...granted, it's way more uncomfortable to see a grown man crying about his shattered phone screen and begging for cheeseburgers, but that's life: women get the \"joy\" of getting pregnant and giving birth, men get to play on hard mode when it comes to asking for free stuff. It's a give and a take, and I for one will always choose free food over screaming babies any day. \nIf you're reading this and thinking, \"There must be a cheat code for free fast food!\" you would be correct. I just told you the cheat code: be a 6.5 or above and have a vagina. OR, if you are hideously ugly and a dude, you could always get the McDonald's McGold card. \nApparently McDonald's primarily gives these cards out to celebrities, because people worth millions of dollars need free food that costs less than $5. That's exactly why you regularly see stars like Jennifer Lopez, Selena Gomez and Hugh Jackman stuffing their faces full of McNuggets. There is nothing healthier or more guaranteed to get you in shape than a weekly McRib, which means that the rich and famous have to be chowing down on McDick's daily in order to stay attractive for their fancy-pants movie roles and television shows. Us plebs, on the other hand... \n...we eat at Burger King. \nGod help us all. \nThere is, however, one way for us normal folk to be #blessed with a McGold card, but it involves doing something heroic or newsworthy. Remember Charles Ramsey, that guy who ditched his meal at McDonald's to help rescue Amanda Berry and several other kidnapped women back in May 2013? iframes not supported \nMcDonald's gave him a McGold card that meant he was able to have free McDonald's at all locations for a year, and unlimited food for the rest of his life at local Ohio restaurants. The lesson here is simple: have a friend steal a child, keep that child locked up for at least five years and then go on and bust into the house. Save the kid and reap the free cheeseburgers for the rest of your life. You'll probably have to split it with your friend, but considering he'll be doing life in prison you've got a solid head start until if/when he makes parole. \nOr, you could accept your place towards the bottom rung of American and continue to fork over $1 for cheeseburgers. In the meantime, you can find me stalking along the outskirts of a playground carrying a large potato sack and wearing all black. These free burgers ain't gonna kidnap themselves, y'know.

They have had the rebound, so it is reasonable to expect it's fairly valued,\" Terranova said on CNBC 's \"Halftime Report\" Thursday afternoon.\nCNBC \"Shark Tank\" investor and O'Shares Investment chairman Kevin O'Leary disagreed with the calls entirely.\n\"I don't agree on any of these calls. I don't agree with the downgrade of McDonald's because in terms of execution excellence in this sector they are number one. Number two, I am not bullish on restaurant stocks. I think it's miserable out there,\" O'Leary explained.",

      "text": "Junk food junkies, if the recent announcement of a Nutella burger at McDonald's in Italy had your mouth watering, rebook those international airline tickets. Now you're going to need to head to the Philippines, where Taco Bell is offering a Cheetos quesadilla for a limited time only.\nYep. It's exactly what you think it is, and maybe what you yourself crafted once long upon a late college night when you happened to have a bag of Cheetos handy. I admit to having tucked a few plain potato chips in a ham sandwich once in a while, but mixing the cheesy melt of a quesadilla with the orange cheesy powder and crunch of Cheetos is new to me.\nJust look at this Facebook post from TB Philippines. They know diners in other countries are jealous, and they aren't afraid to crow about it.\nIf you're thinking you've seen something similar at American Taco Bells, you kind of have. But US outlets are using Doritos, not Cheetos, and they're using them as taco shells . And Napoleon Dynamite and his pal Pedro reunited for some Burger King cheesy tater tots this week , so cheese is in.\nIf you don't have a trip to the Philippines planned, we can give you complicated instructions for making a Cheetos quesadilla on your own. Step one: Melt some cheese in a tortilla. Step two: Add Cheetos. Step three: No regrets!\n10 10 utterly weird snack foods to satiate your kookiest cravings ",

      "text": "Home > Consumer McDonald's drops supplier in Malaysia over worker exploitation claims [KUALA LUMPUR] Fast food giant McDonald's said it has dropped a labour supply agency in Malaysia after claims emerged that it was underpaying its migrant workers and housing them in appalling conditions. PHOTO: AFP Dec 1, 2016 6:50 PM \n[KUALA LUMPUR] Fast food giant McDonald's said it has dropped a labour supply agency in Malaysia after claims emerged that it was underpaying its migrant workers and housing them in appalling conditions. \nAn investigation by British newspaper The Guardian said the agency supplying workers to McDonald's was withholding their salaries, which were as low as 75 US cents an hour, underpaying promised wages, and confiscating their passports. \nThe report was based on interviews with 15 Nepali workers who had worked at different McDonald's restaurants in the capital Kuala Lumpur. \nMcDonald's said it has ended its contract with the agency, Human Connection HR, and pledged staff welfare is a \"top priority\", with companies globally under mounting pressure to ensure their supply chains are free of slavery and exploitation. \n\"Earlier this year, we became aware of certain circumstances relating to services provided by Human Connection HR which were not in compliance with our standards,\" spokesman Ron Christianson said in a statement. \n\"As a result, we have terminated our contract with them.\" \nThere was no suggestion of any wrongdoing by McDonald's. Human Connection HR said it will hold a meeting and issue a response soon. \nMr Christianson would not confirm details of the exploitation, saying the workers were employees of the labour agency. \n\"Because the workers are not employees of McDonald's, our efforts to address the issues were unsuccessful, as were proposals for McDonald's to assume responsibility for paying workers directly,\" he said. \nHuman Connection HR had been supplying workers to McDonald's in Malaysia for \"a number of years\", Mr Christianson added. \nHe said the company's suppliers were bound to uphold a code of conduct which includes safeguarding worker's rights. \nMcDonald's hires over 12,000 people in Malaysia, and less than five per cent are foreign workers. \nMalaysia, which is South-east Asia's third-largest economy, relies heavily on foreign workers especially in construction, plantation and domestic work, but human rights campaigners have long voiced concerns that they face widespread abuses. \nAegile Fernandez, director at Kuala Lumpur-based migrant rights group Tenaganita, said labour exploitation happens \"almost everyday\" among multinational firms in the country. \nShe urged McDonald's to take responsibility and ensure its supply chain is free of exploitation and slavery. \n\"They can't run away because they are the main company,\" she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. \n\"No matter if you're in the United States or Europe, you have to ensure your suppliers are following all the regulations and upholding the rights of the workers.\" \nREUTERS ",

      "text": "View Comments \nKUALA LUMPUR : Fast-food giant McDonald’s said it has dropped a labour supply agency in Malaysia after claims emerged that it was underpaying its migrant workers and housing them in appalling conditions. \nAn investigation by British newspaper The Guardian said the agency supplying workers to McDonald’s was withholding their salaries, which were as low as 75 US cents (RM3.35) an hour, underpaying promised wages, and confiscating their passports. \nThe report was based on interviews with 15 Nepali workers who had worked at different McDonald’s restaurants in Kuala Lumpur. \nMcDonald’s said it has ended its contract with the agency, Human Connection HR, and pledged staff welfare is a “top priority”, with companies globally under mounting pressure to ensure their supply chains are free of slavery and exploitation. \n“Earlier this year, we became aware of certain circumstances relating to services provided by Human Connection HR which were not in compliance with our standards,” spokesman Ron Christianson said in a statement. “As a result, we have terminated our contract with them.” \nThere was no suggestion of any wrongdoing by McDonald’s. \nHuman Connection HR said it will hold a meeting and issue a response soon. \nChristianson would not confirm details of the exploitation, saying the workers were employees of the labour agency. \n“Because the workers are not employees of McDonald’s, our efforts to address the issues were unsuccessful, as were proposals for McDonald’s to assume responsibility for paying workers directly,” he said. \nHuman Connection HR had been supplying workers to McDonald's in Malaysia for “a number of years”, he added. \nChristianson said the company’s suppliers were bound to uphold a code of conduct which includes safeguarding worker’s rights. \nMcDonald’s hires over 12,000 people in Malaysia, and less than 5% are foreign workers. \n– Thomson Reuters Foundation",

With all the hoopla surrounding Santa and his eight tiny reindeer, people forget about the birth of Jesus on a cold winter night.\nFortunately though, Amy Basel recently visited a McDonald's that not only remembered the meaning behind the miraculous holiday, but is displaying it proud for everyone to see.\nfacebook.com\nAmy is the founder of Your Path, His Plan , where she speaks and writes about the power of God's love.

      "title": "Dozier's 21 Lead No. 20 South Carolina to 68-50 Win",
      "text": "PJ Dozier came to South Carolina last season as coach Frank Martin's first McDonald's All-America recruit. Things, however, did not go Dozier's way.\nJust look at him now.\nDozier had a career-high 21 points to lead the 20th-ranked Gamecocks to a 68-50 victory over Vermont and a 7-0 start for the second consecutive year.\nThe 6-foot-6 sophomore topped his previous best performance of 17 points in a season-opening win over Louisiana Tech. Two games later, it was Dozier who hit the game-winning shot in a 70-69 victory over Monmouth.\nIt's a dramatic step forward form 2015-16 when Dozier was regularly in foul trouble and routinely pulled from games by Martin because of sub-standard defense.\n\"Last year wasn't my year,\" Dozier said. \"This year, (Martin) has that trust in me.\"\nDozier helped the Gamecocks to a 13-1 run at the start of the second half. Maik Kotsar had eight points in the charge while Dozier had a 3-pointer and a thunderous finish to an alley-oop pass that had the crowd on its feet as South Carolina took a 49-32 lead.\nThe Catamounts (6-3) could not respond to taller, quicker South Carolina.\nLast year, Martin said Dozier committed the triple sins of turnovers, not defending and getting into foul trouble. \"This year, he's playing hard, he's defending and he's never in foul trouble,\" Martin said. \"Last time I checked, you haven't seen any of those turnovers where he throws it to the guy at the top of the key so he can dunk it in the other basket.\"\nDozier had three of the Gamecocks' four 3-pointers. Kotsar had 14 points on 7-of-10 shooting, mostly from close to the basket, while Chris Silva added 12 points for South Carolina.\nDozier had six rebounds, as did the 6-9 Silva, along with three steals.\nAnthony Lamb had 14 points, the only Vermont player in double figures.\nTHE BIG PICTURE\nVermont: The Catamounts have won 20 or more games in coach John Becker's five seasons and had a trip to the NCAA Tournament in 2012 and the NIT in 2014. They do it with a mix of strong-shooting upperclassmen and enough young talent to compete in the American East Conference. But Vermont doesn't have enough firepower to keep up with a top-20 team like South Carolina. The Gamecocks' defense kept the Catamounts off balance most of the way as they fell behind by 14 points in the opening half.\nSouth Carolina: For their success last week in defeating ranked opponents Michigan and Syracuse, the Gamecocks are very much a work in progress. One starter, Kotsar, and four of the five players off the bench are in their first years at South Carolina and several times an animated Martin yanked players, loudly questioning their technique. He calmed in the second half with South Carolina's quick start.\nPOLL IMPLICATIONS\nSouth Carolina should maintain its spot in the rankings as long as it stays undefeated.\nWORRIED COACH\nWith South Carolina in the rankings for the first time this season, Martin worried his team's mindset might be off facing Vermont following wins against ranked teams Michigan and Syracuse last week. \"I'm glad this game's over with,\" Martin said. \"I just had a feeling that because of the success of the last couple of games against name teams, we weren't going to be as clean was we needed to be.\"\nLEARNING LESSONS\nVermont coach John Becker believes his players are on the right path to another successful season in the America East Conference. They're just not there yet. He said the loss to South Carolina exposed some flaws that will need to be fixed in the next month. \"I think we found we're just not tough enough yet,\" he said.\nUP NEXT\nVermont gets almost a week off before starting three straight at home with Dartmouth on Dec. 7.\nSouth Carolina concludes a two-game home stand against Florida International on Sunday.\n———\nMore AP college basketball: www.collegebasketball.ap.org and https://twitter.com/AP—Top25.\n  Dozier's 21 Lead No. 20 South Carolina to 68-50 Win \" \nPatriots star Rob Gronkowski to have back surgery Friday \" \nRichard Sherman on Cam Newton grabbing '12th man' flag: 'I guess karma gets you' Chargers expected to exercise option for L.A. move, sources say Pirates 3B Jung Ho Kang faces DUI-related charges in Korea \" \nLeBron James: 'I haven't thought about' Finals rematch with Warriors \" \nESPN's NFL MVP Poll: Derek Carr takes top spot \" \nThe story behind Nike's self-lacing, 'Back to the Future'-inspired shoes \" \nCoyotes captain Shane Doan: Auston Matthews is an 'even better person than player' Five Rounds: Who would win a mythical Mayweather-McGregor fight? \" \nUFC's Conor McGregor issued boxing license in California  ",
