      "text": "More: Console/PC , Business/Marketing \nMicrosoft has rebranded its Xbox Preview Program and opened up the initiative to all Xbox users. \nAs revealed by Microsoft's Major Nelson , the Xbox Preview Program will now go by the name of the Xbox Insider Program. \nBefore now, the Preview Program was an invite-only testing ground where members could try out new apps, games, and system updates and provide feedback. \nGoing forward, the Insider Program will take an opt-in approach, allowing all Xbox users to take previews for a spin and share their thoughts with Microsoft. \nFollowing the rebrand, the Xbox Preview Dashboard will be updated with a fresh UI, personalized announcements and content opportunities, and an Xbox Insider profile card that highlights a user's contributions. \nThe changes will initially be rolled out to those preview members who've provided the most feedback, before being dished out en masse over the next few weeks. \nAs it stands, Xbox One system update previews will be limited to those already testing them due to an overwhelming number of volunteers. \n\"More fans will have the ability to provide feedback directly from their Xbox One consoles,\" wrote Major Nelson . \"The Xbox Insider Hub will provide great opportunities to try out games, apps, and other console experiences.\" \n\"Whether you're an Xbox Insider who enjoys previewing the latest Xbox One system updates, or an Insider who loves checking out the beta of the latest installment in your favorite franchise, you'll now get to choose how to participate.\" Related Jobs",

      "title": "Microsoft Teams uses next generation Skype Consumer network, not Skype for Business",
      "text": "  \nWhen Microsoft took the stage last week at New York’s Milk Studios to introduce Microsoft Teams , repeated references were made inferring that Teams is “built on Skype.” The new supposed “Slack-killer” will allow business users to use Microsoft Teams’“chat based interface” to communicate quickly, keep “channels” of communication open, add GIFs and emoticons as well as documents and links to conversations, and keep everything organized and connected to the rest of Office 365. \nBut over at the Mastering Lync blog (via Mary Branscombe ), Microsoft MVP Richard Brynteson digs in a bit to what’s really going on in Teams, and low and behold, it’s not built on Skype for Business at all. \nBrynteson analyzes the act of sending a message in Teams, finding two different JSON (or JavaScript Object Notation, a way of transmitting data objects marked up by human-readable notation) events, and goes on to explain: \nSo there are a few items of note that we should discuss at this time: \nThis is absolutely not Skype for Business under the hood. Microsoft has talked about the next gen Skype Consumer network and this is clearly go to that environment.https://st-client-ss.msg.skype.com/v1/users/ME/conversations/19%3A2a9ad786-8a9b-409c-a29a-19666d549187_fabf899c-a61b-44a3-9623-d269342541b4%40unq.gbl.spaces/messages \nThis is all driven via JSON and web services. If you look at the language that is being used this is a very modern interface that is be used by several other players in the market. \nBrynteson finds the same JSON object notation and same types of next-gen Skype Consumer network language when looking at audio-video sessions, and then concludes: \nSo again, we see the entire meeting experience is built on top of the Skype Consumer network. So the key item to know is that Teams sits on that next generation Skype Consumer network and is most likely one step to a much larger consolidation. \nSkype has had its share of detractors lately, mired in problems as it moves from an old peer-to-peer network to today’s somewhat stopgap effort built on Microsoft technologies, while not yet ready to unleash this new Skype Consumer network architecture. At least with these glances under the hood at Microsoft Teams, we can see that a newer, and hopefully better world is coming for Skype.  ",

      "text": "  \nSteve Lasker, the Program Manager at Azure Developer Experiences has taken to an official Microsoft Blog to announce that Microsoft has issued Azure Container Registry preview. The move brings major upgrades to Azure Container offerings, and makes Azure a cloud provider with the broadest support for container deployments. \nThe Azure Container Registry Preview also comes after Microsoft made Azure Container Service generally available in April 2016, and after Microsoft announced container support for Azure Batch and Azure Service Fabric container support. Azure Container Registry Preview will also include a preview of Azure Container Registry, which is a private registry for hosting container images. According to Steve Lasker, Azure Container Registry has several uses such as: Store and manage images for all types of container deployments Automated Container Builds, Testing and Security Scanning Support for Store your container image in local, network-close storage on Azure Use Common Command Line Interface (CLI) to interact with the registry Use Azure Active Directory to manage access, including Service Principals for headless connections like automated CI/CD and vulnerability scanning Manage Windows and Linux container images in a single registry \nTo learn more about Azure Container Registry Preview, you can visit this official Microsoft website and also stay on the watch for more details during Microsoft Connect().

      "text": "By Rich Woods Neowin LLC @@TheRichWoods · 3 seconds ago with 0 comments \nMicrosoft today announced the Skype Insider Program, which will allow users to test out upcoming builds of the service. It's currently available for iOS, macOS, Android, and Windows; however, that does not include the UWP Skype Preview app, as that fits under the Windows Insider umbrella. In other words, if you want Skype Preview previews, you'll need to be on the Fast ring. \nThe sign-up form also allows for a write-in section. You can request to join the Insider Program on other platforms, such as Xbox or the recently released Linux Alpha client . \nAfter signing up, Microsoft will promise to get back to you within one business day with steps on how to get started. Until then, the company suggests downloading \"the Windows Insider build\" to get started. \nThe news follows yesterday's announcement of the Xbox Insider Program , which was formerly known as the Xbox One Preview Program. It's finally open to anyone that wants to join, but new members won't get system updates. \nWith the addition of Skype, the list of Insider Programs continues to grow for Microsoft. It joins major software like Windows, Office, and Xbox, but also mobile apps like Office Lens and OneDrive on Android. You can sign up for the Skype Insider Program right here . Tags",

The Cloud Native Compute Foundation , which plays host to the open source side of Kubernetes, is hosting its first Kubernetes conference this week and unsurprisingly, we’ll see quite a bit of container-related news in the next few days. \nFirst up is Microsoft, which is not only making the source code of the engine at the core of its Azure Container Service (ACS) available, but also launching a preview of its native integration of Kubernetes for ACS. In addition, Microsoft is also continuing to bet on Mesosphere’s DC/OS and updating that service to the latest release of DC/OS. \nRead more at Tech Crunch",

      "text": "Brazilian government plans largest Microsoft procurement to date The decision marks a departure from the open source model | Topic: Microsoft \nThe Brazilian government is planning a massive procurement exercise of Microsoft products over the next few months. \nFederal government bodies have until November 11 to show interest in buying Microsoft software. The goal of the joint purchasing process is to generate cost efficiencies and standardize the IT applications portfolio across departments. \nThe agreement with Microsoft will then allow government departments to buy products as required at previously negotiated prices within a 12 month period without the need to launch new tendering processes. Windows 10 telemetry secrets: Where, when, and why Microsoft collects your data \nProducts most likely to be bought by departments are Windows 10, Windows Server and the Office suite. \nThe intended purchase would be the biggest purchase of Microsoft products by the Brazilian government to date and also marks a departure from the open source model that had been encouraged within the public sector since 2003. \nThe idea with open source was to reduce licensing costs while stimulating local companies to develop products for the government, but the lack of skilled professionals and scarcity of specialized providers meant the initiative lost momentum. \nWhile the joint Microsoft procurement aims at reducing spend in the long run, it's unlikely there will be a shopping spree, as public sector bodies in Brazil are under pressure to avoid any new spending commitments and departmental budgets have already been considerably reduced.

      "title": "NooBaa Announces Microsoft Partnership: Azure Marketplace Availability and Accelerator Participation",
      "text": "Flexible data storage fabric spans on-premises and multi-cloud capacity including Microsoft Azure\n\nTel Aviv, Israel (PRWEB) November 08, 2016\n\nNooBaa today announced a strategic partnership with Microsoft, which includes NooBaa’s native integration with Azure Blob Storage, availability of the NooBaa software-based storage solution in the Microsoft Azure Marketplace, and Microsoft’s selection of NooBaa as a member in the Microsoft Accelerator program.\n\nNooBaa’s software solution provides a new architecture for a flexible compute and storage fabric that seamlessly spans enterprise datacenters and public cloud providers. In addition to supporting heterogeneous on-premises storage resources, NooBaa now allows customers to pool public cloud capacity from Microsoft’s Azure Blob Storage in addition to other cloud providers. NooBaa’s support for multiple public clouds reduces vendor lock-in and facilitates simple application and data migration between resource pools.\n\nThe NooBaa storage solution is now also available directly through the Microsoft Azure Marketplace. NooBaa represents the first multi-cloud-capable storage solution in the Marketplace and provides access to Azure Blob Storage capacity via the popular S3 API, which has emerged as a de-facto standard for Dev-Ops and cloud computing. The NooBaa Azure Marketplace Edition can be deployed for free and automatically integrates with Azure compute and capacity resources.\n\nIn addition to NooBaa’s availability in the Azure Marketplace, NooBaa has also been selected by Microsoft to join the exclusive Microsoft Accelerator program. The Accelerator program provides NooBaa working space, and valuable access to mentoring, funding, facilities, and direct access to Microsoft customers. According to Navot Volk, Managing Director of Microsoft Accelerator, “We only accept 3.5% of the applicants into the accelerator so we’re extremely selective about the companies we work with. NooBaa is unique because their technology is impressive, they deliver a unique value proposition for Microsoft’s IT customers, and they align perfectly with Microsoft’s strategic vision for hybrid computing.”\n\nAccording to James Staten, Microsoft’s Chief Strategist for Cloud & Enterprise, “This blended model lets you stop worrying about where your apps are, and focus more on how to leverage the right resources for the right value…hybrid is not a temporary state but the new normal.” NooBaa supports hybrid computing by creating and automating a continuous capacity fabric across on-premises and public cloud resources, with flexible capabilities for data placement and migration. With NooBaa, customers can more easily move workloads between cloud providers without application changes.\n\n“It’s becoming clear that Microsoft is going to be a dominant market force for enterprise hybrid cloud computing over the next few years. Being admitted to the Accelerator was a huge win because it allows us to focus on important things like Azure integration and customer feedback,” according to Yuval Dimnik, NooBaa’s CEO, “we’re getting access to some amazing people and resources that are accelerating our progress. Plus I have to say the food is amazing!”\n\nAbout NooBaa\nNooBaa is the new way for enterprises to create and consume cloud services. It allows large enterprises to improve flexibility while reducing vendor lock-in and costs. Co-founded in 2013 by leading storage and security experts Yuval Dimnik and Guy Margalit, NooBaa has offices in Herzliya, Israel and Silicon Valley, California. Privately-held, NooBaa has received venture capital funding from JVP, OurCrowd and prominent industry leaders. For more information, visit http://www.noobaa.com.",

      "text": "Macworld Nov 8, 2016 7:00 AM \nFor a company that has for years been reported to be just months from annihilating Apple, Microsoft seems pretty bad at sealing the deal. \nWriting for The Motley Fool , Leo Sun wonders aloud “Will Microsoft's Surface Studio Crush Apple's Mac Business?” (Tip o’ the antlers to The LeeBase and Shawn King .) \nShort answer: No. \nLong answer: N . \nThe Macalope has already said the Surface Studio looks like a nice machine. It’s too bad it runs Windows. Still, if you’re a graphics professional, you would be crazy not to give it a look. But it’s not without its drawbacks (see: Windows 10) and at $3,000, it’s not going to move enough units to make a big dent. Targeting the high end is a very good first move, but that’s all it is right now. \nThe Surface Pro Studio comes with the Surface Pen, which works with other Surface devices, and the new Surface Dial. \nSurface, Surface, Surface! \nMarcia, Marcia, Marcia! \nMicrosoft probably doesn't care if it sells more of its own Surface devices, or if it helps Windows OEMs sell more Surface-inspired devices. That's because most of its revenue still comes from sales of Windows licenses. So as long as Windows-powered devices dominate the PC market, Microsoft will maintain a defensible platform against iOS and Android devices. \nHot takes on 2016 from a mindset mired in 1996. Microsoft absolutely cares that you buy its hardware because otherwise it has no growth. Growth in the PC market has stalled and Microsoft doesn’t compete in the mobile market. If it doesn’t steal the lunch of its OEMs, it doesn’t eat. \nThe comparisons between Microsoft's new Surface devices and Apple's Macs look pretty dismal for the latter. The base models of Microsoft's new Surface Book and Apple's new MacBook Pro both cost about $1,500, but the ;Surface Book gets 12 hours of battery life compared to the ;MacBook Pro's 10 hours. \nAnd that’s the only difference! Well, OK, the MacBook Pro has twice the storage space and weighs a third of a pound less. But the MacBook Pro’s advantages aren’t what we’re here to discuss. \nApparently. \nWe see the same form factor confusion when we compare the iPad Pro to the iMacs -- the former mimics the Surface's hybrid touchscreen approach with iOS, \nSorry, who’s mimicking what now? Sure, we all remember how the Surface came out before the iPad, right? If you don’t, just stand a little closer to this leaking gas line and you’ll remember soon enough. \nFor many customers -- especially Apple's dedicated demographic of graphic designers -- the Surface Pro Studio likely represents what the iMacs should have already become. \nFor many Windows customers, a touch-screen desktop operating system is the two-headed demon stepchild of computing. The Macalope isn’t saying it’s not possible to make an operating system that seamlessly works with keyboard and mouse input as well as touch, but Windows 10 certainly hasn’t proved that it is. \nMicrosoft's new Surface devices, along with the clones that they will inspire, won't deliver a knockout punch to Apple's Mac business… \nSo, what was the point of this journey of discovery from the headline to here? The friends we made along the way? \nBut Apple's Macs are definitely losing steam… \nThis is true. Turns out you have to make Macs to sell them. \nApple has really brought some of this craziness on themselves. Unless there’s some surprise, this will be the first year the iMac has not been updated since it was introduced in 1998, the Mac mini is two years old and the Mac Pro hasn’t been updated since we were all speaking doge . \nThe Surface Studio really isn’t going to “crush” the Mac. The only thing that’s crushing it is Apple’s lack of concern about updating it. Related:",

      "text": "\nMicrosoft are currently working on the Xbox Scorpio, their next console, which is due to launch in Holiday 2017. Unlike the relatively disappointing PS4 Pro, the Scorpio seems to be a beast of a machine- it was unveiled at E3 as ‘the most powerful console ever made,’ and with a 6TFLOP GPU, it looks like Microsoft will deliver on that vision.\nAnd now, Windows Central seems to have more information on exactly how they will do it. Citing insider sources, Windows Central claims that the Scorpio will become the centre for first party game development, for all Microsoft games on Windows 10 PCs and Xbox One (the same tools will also be extended to third parties, of course). Any game that is created for the UWP PC platform will run on Scorpio in 4K natively , including older games that are already out- which means that titles like Gears 4 and Forza Horizon 3 will run in 4K on the device, as well as any new titles that are released in UWP format.\nThe Scorpio can mimic a standard Xbox One at a hardware level, so essentially, developers can now simply target a Scorpio for development, make games for it, and then test them across multiple configurations (the Scorpio configuration and the Xbox One configuration) on the Scorpio itself- essentially, on the development end, the Scorpio will become the nexus of Xbox Play Anywhere.\nWith that said, the Scorpio will have exclusive VR games that will simply not be compatible with existing Xbox One systems, which are too weak to run it. Scorpio is also slated to run on the Xbox One OS, though again, with some alterations and additions for VR.\nAll of this sounds incredibly exciting to me- and if this is what Microsoft are pushing with the Scorpio, then I’m all for it. I cannot wait for the details to be confirmed as we near Scorpio’s launch a year from now.",

In addition to supporting heterogeneous on-premises storage resources, NooBaa now allows customers to pool public cloud capacity from Microsoft’s Azure Blob Storage in addition to other cloud providers. NooBaa’s support for multiple public clouds reduces vendor lock-in and facilitates simple application and data migration between resource pools. \nThe NooBaa storage solution is now also available directly through the Microsoft Azure Marketplace. NooBaa represents the first multi-cloud-capable storage solution in the Marketplace and provides access to Azure Blob Storage capacity via the popular S3 API, which has emerged as a de-facto standard for Dev-Ops and cloud computing. The NooBaa Azure Marketplace Edition can be deployed for free and automatically integrates with Azure compute and capacity resources. \nIn addition to NooBaa’s availability in the Azure Marketplace, NooBaa has also been selected by Microsoft to join the exclusive Microsoft Accelerator program . The Accelerator program provides NooBaa working space, and valuable access to mentoring, funding, facilities, and direct access to Microsoft customers. According to Navot Volk, Managing Director of Microsoft Accelerator, “We only accept 3.5% of the applicants into the accelerator so we’re extremely selective about the companies we work with. NooBaa is unique because their technology is impressive, they deliver a unique value proposition for Microsoft’s IT customers, and they align perfectly with Microsoft’s strategic vision for hybrid computing.” \nAccording to James Staten, Microsoft’s Chief Strategist for Cloud & Enterprise, “This blended model lets you stop worrying about where your apps are, and focus more on how to leverage the right resources for the right value…hybrid is not a temporary state but the new normal.” NooBaa supports hybrid computing by creating and automating a continuous capacity fabric across on-premises and public cloud resources, with flexible capabilities for data placement and migration. With NooBaa, customers can more easily move workloads between cloud providers without application changes. \n“It’s becoming clear that Microsoft is going to be a dominant market force for enterprise hybrid cloud computing over the next few years. Being admitted to the Accelerator was a huge win because it allows us to focus on important things like Azure integration and customer feedback,” according to Yuval Dimnik, NooBaa’s CEO, “we’re getting access to some amazing people and resources that are accelerating our progress. Plus I have to say the food is amazing!” \nAbout NooBaa NooBaa is the new way for enterprises to create and consume cloud services. It allows large enterprises to improve flexibility while reducing vendor lock-in and costs. Co-founded in 2013 by leading storage and security experts Yuval Dimnik and Guy Margalit, NooBaa has offices in Herzliya, Israel and Silicon Valley, California. Privately-held, NooBaa has received venture capital funding from JVP , OurCrowd and prominent industry leaders.

      "text": "0 \nThey're offering refunds \nCall of Duty: Infinite Warfare runs just fine on consoles, but PC users, specifically Windows 10 users, are having major issues with the game. Most notably, the Windows 10 edition doesn't work with the Steam version , leaving players with ghost town servers and no one to play with. \nFingers have been pointed in the direction of Activision, which includes a Microsoft customer service rep, and multiple reports of refunds being granted. According to Windows Central, a Microsoft spokesperson noted that \"they support cross-play for partners who enable it,\" and that Activision opted to not provide that support. \nThis seems like a really odd move since Infinite Warfare isn't doing so hot on PC right now. If you're interested, I'd strongly consider getting it on consoles.  ",

      "text": "Vista, and the inability to make its own hardware, took the blame for Microsoft's smartphone woes. Image: Microsoft \nMicrosoft should have moved much faster to make its own smartphone hardware, said former CEO Steve Ballmer, in a recent interview with Bloomberg . \n\"I would have moved into the hardware business faster and recognized that what we had in the PC, where there was a separation of chips, systems and software, wasn't largely going reproduce itself in the mobile world,\" he said. \nBallmer said that Microsoft should \"have been in the hardware business sooner in the phone case,\" and that another -- perhaps unexpected -- reason for that not happening was Windows Vista, which debuted in November 2006. \nThe Vista release \"sucked up a huge amount of resource for a much longer period of time than it should have, because we stumbled over it, and when you have a lot of your best engineers in a sense being non-productive for a while it really takes its toll,\" Ballmer explained. \nDespite spending billions on acquiring Nokia's phone business in 2014, Microsoft has now largely given up on being a player in smartphones (see chart) although there remain some suggestions that it might have one more try with a 'Surface-phone' next year. But for now, having failed to make a dent on market, Microsoft seems resigned to putting its apps onto other companies' smartphone operating systems. Image: ZDNet / Data: company filings \nSo, if Microsoft has bought Nokia earlier, say in 2012 rather than 2014, would that have really made any difference? \nOf course, Microsoft had a long history in of making mobile software: before Windows Phone it had Windows Mobile since 2000, and Windows CE and PocketPC before that. It didn't make its own hardware though, but relied on the likes of Dell and Compaq to build the devices. \nIndeed, market share stats from 2006 show how different the the world was: Windows CE had more than half the market for PDAs (and Nokia had a third of the mobile phone market). \nRecognise these names? The way things were in 2006. Image: Gartner \nThe first iPhone arrived in June 2007 and everything started to change -- but only slowly. Indeed, taking a look at the smartphone market share numbers here is instructive. \nIn 2007 Windows Mobile had a 12 percent market share in smartphones -- enough to put it in second place behind Symbian (63 percent) and just ahead of Research in Motion (remember that name?) and 'Linux', which tied on 9.6 percent: Apple only managed a 2.7 percent market share (these figures are all from analyst Gartner). \nA year later that had changed: Microsoft remained on 11.8 percent, but iOS had jumped to 8.2 percent, with Symbian on 52.4 percent and RIM on 16.6 percent. By 2009 Apple had overtaken Microsoft with 14.4 percent compared to 8.7 percent -- and the iPhone never really looked back. In 2010 Microsoft's smartphone share was just 4.2 percent. \nWith the arrival of Android, Symbian's market share evaporated and RIM (later BlackBerry) would also find the competition too hot, leaving us with the two-horse mobile race we have today. Brave new smartphone world \nIt seems that Microsoft just couldn't make the jump from being a leader in PDAs to being a smartphone leader, ending up as a niche interest. \nStephen Elop's famous 'burning platform' memo came early in 2011, in which he warned that Nokia was being beaten by Android and iOS. This resulted in the Finnish company adopting Windows Phone as its primary platform, and eventually selling its mobile business to Redmond in Setpember 2013.",

      "title": "Microsoft launches new Skype Insider Beta program",
      "text": "\nInsider programs are all the rage it seems, Microsoft has one for Windows and the Xbox, and now – the Skype team are initiating their own Skype Insider program.\nSkype Insider is a program that provided testers with access to pre-release builds of Skype whether o Android, iOS or Windows (excluding Windows phones and the Store apps). The program is set to allow Skype fans to test out and deliver feedback on planned features fo the program.\nIt is trivially easy to sign up for Skype Insider, you’ll need to head to this link here and have your Google account, Apple ID or Microsoft account on the ready.\nWhile there aren’t any builds of Skype Insider ready yet for mobile devices, Microsoft already has a build for the PC out , so you can try out Skype beta builds on the PC right now.\nWhile the exclusion of the Skype preview apps for Windows may seem weird, Microsoft’s Windows Store apps allow developers to push put updates to Insider builds, allowing the store apps to use their own mechanism. With that in mind, there is likely no need for a Skype Insider program for the Windows 10 Store apps. Similarly, while many users may balk at Microsoft;s continued support of the Skype Win 32 app, that is still the most widely used variant on Skype for Widows due to being available on Windows 7 and 8 as well and will likely be the most used version of Skype for the near future.\nTo learn more about Skype Insider and sign up for the program, visit the source link below.\n",

      "text": "share \nMicrosoft was expected to unveil at least one Xbox streaming device earlier this year, but the company may have canceled its plans altogether. Brad Sams, executive editor at Petri, originally claimed the devices would be unveiled at E3 in June, but Microsoft launched an Xbox One S console and detailed its Project Scorpio plans instead. \nWindows Central reports that Microsoft canceled its plans to launch an Xbox TV streaming device, leading to an order for 300,000 units to be pulled. The device was reportedly a streaming stick that would debut with a $99 price point, and codenamed Project Hobart. It's not clear what led Microsoft to cancel its plans, but the software giant has previously shelved devices at the last minute. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella reportedly canceled the Surface Mini just weeks before it was supposed to debut at an event in New York City. Microsoft unveiled the Surface Pro 3 instead, with no mention of a Surface Mini. \nMicrosoft was also reportedly planning to introduce its own Alexa device during its Surface Studio event last month. Windows Central originally reported that Microsoft had an Amazon Echo competitor ready to unveil on October 26th, with Cortana built-in. Microsoft never unveiled such a device, leading to some speculating that the company canceled its plans. Microsoft has also canceled its hardware efforts with the wearable Band accessory recently.

      "text": "Just as with the Windows Insider program for Windows 10, Microsoft calls on adventurous customers to test new builds of the Xbox One operating system. The company launched the Xbox Preview Program in February of 2014, and since then, it has incorporated feature requests and provided means for voting on potential feature additions to improve the Xbox One experience for all owners. Now, more than two years later, Microsoft is overhauling the program.\nMicrosoft’s head of the Xbox preview program, Emily Hanson, said on Monday that it’s now called the Xbox Insider Program, which falls in line alongside the Windows Insider Program. The name change reflects the program’s expansion beyond offering just previews to system updates with the ability to offer feedback on preview builds of apps, games, and other “experiences.”\nRelated: Xbox One Holiday Gaming Preview\nWith the new program name comes an update to the Xbox Preview Dashboard. According to Hanson, this was rebuilt “from the ground up” to reflect user feedback. The changes start with a new “Xbox Insider Hub” name, a more personalized approach, and a new user interface inspired by the New Xbox One Experience. The update will also provide the ability for multiple users on a single console to provide feedback.\n“We’re starting to roll these changes out today to a small number of preview members who have provided the most feedback since the inception of the Xbox Preview Program,” Hanson said. “If you have your Xbox One console in Instant-on mode and you have the Xbox Preview Dashboard app installed, then you don’t have to do anything — the app will update automatically overnight.”\nIf you haven’t jumped on the Xbox One preview bandwagon, the renamed program provides an additional benefit: an open door for all Xbox One owners. That’s right: Microsoft will provide the Xbox Insider Hub to all Xbox One gamers “soon” for testing new games, apps, and other console “experiences.” What the general base won’t test are new builds of the Xbox One operating system.\nAs shown in Microsoft’s FAQ here , the Xbox Preview Program was split into two offerings: the Xbox Insider Program and the Xbox One Update Preview. The former provides previews for games, apps, new “experiences,” and system updates. The former program focuses only on previewing system updates for the console.\nBased on that information, current Insiders can test apps, games, experiences, and system updates whereas the upcoming new Insiders can only test apps, games, and experiences when the program launches for the masses. The second program, which appears separately in the Xbox Insider Hub app, seems to focus on gamers who only want to test system builds.\n“Xbox Insiders become eligible for previews based on their interests, previous activities in the program, tenure as an Xbox Insider, Xbox Insider XP, and other factors,” the FAQ states. “If you previously participated in the Xbox Preview Program, you can rejoin the Xbox One Update Preview at any time by selecting it from the Insider content list in the Xbox Insider Hub.”\nWith the introduction of the two programs, Microsoft is providing Xbox One owners several ways they can participate in software testing. When the Xbox Insider Program actually rolls out to all Xbox One owners is unknown for now, but hopefully it will be long before Microsoft serves up the Creators Update for Windows 10 in spring 2017.\nUpdate: The Xbox One’s N64 emulator is already gone The best Xbox One compatible Xbox 360 games Xbox Game Preview, ID@Xbox titles coming to Windows 10 this year",

Before I begin, that's my first guide and English isn't my mother tongue, so don't be harsh if you don't like it, thanks :)First of all, the Minesweeper Title Update is Free and only available on Windows 8.1Then, when you are in Minesweeper, you have to select ine the category Games, the Adventure mode.Ok, so that was easy. Now that you are in Adventure mode, you have to complete the tutorial level (aka Level 0). It will explain you what to do in this game mode. Once you reach the end of the level, you will begin the Level 1, you will simply have to make your way through the blocks as you saw in the Level 0.Once the exit reached, the scoreboard will appear, and normally : Achievement unlocked !But you can be like me, and do not have any notifications for the achievement unlocked, and when you come back in the main menu to check your achievements, it may be still locked. Don't worry, actually mine is still locked in the main menu even tough I unlocked it (you can see that I unlocked it recently)Thanks for reading this little guide, and I hope you will earn this achievement without problems :) There are 3 comments relating to this Solution | Please log in to comment on this solution.

      "text": "0 0 \nMicrosoft is making big steps towards improving Kinect in Windows 10 . In that manner, the company just released the new Kinect v2 driver for Windows 10 , which can be downloaded from the Device Manager. \nThe biggest highlight of the new Kinect update for Windows 10 is that it allows users to use Kinect as a webcam . Once you set everything up, you’ll be able to use Kinect during video calls, or for biometric face recognition for Windows Hello , just like any other webcam. \nIt has always been possible to do such thing with Kinect in Windows 10, but now it’s easier than ever. All you have to do is to go to the Device Manager, find your Kinect device, check for driver updates, and you’re good to go. As simple, as that. \nAdditionally, Microsoft also enabled the new UWP APIs, that will allow third-party universal Windows apps to absorb depth, RGB, and infrared data from the sensor. All code samples related to Kinect for Windows UWP APIs are available for developers to download: \n“First, by popular demand, the code that Alex Turner used during his Channel 9 video is now available on GitHub as part of the Windows universal samples . With this sample, you can use Windows.Media.Capture.Frames APIs to enumerate the Kinect sensor’s RGB/IR/depth cameras and then use MediaFrameReader to stream frames. This API lets you access pixels of each individual frame directly in a highly efficient way.” \nFor more info about all the innovations for Kinect on Windows 10, and the latest driver, visit Microsoft’s official blog. \nRELATED STORIES YOU NEED TO CHECK OUT:",

      "text": "0 0 \nMicrosoft just pushed a new update for Skype Preview to Windows Insiders. The new update brings some fresh features, and enhances the overall usability of the app. \nWith this update, Microsoft introduced the drag and drop option to Skype Preview. Users are now able to simply drag a file they want to share into Skype’s UI, and it will automatically be sent. This feature has been present on the Desktop version for quite some time, so Microsoft is catching up with the Preview, as well. \nAdditionally, links shared with Skype Preview will have a URL preview. This option was also introduced to Skype for Desktop some time ago. The latest update also enhanced the calling and video experience, and introduced the ability to start a conversation directly from a contact’s profile page. \nHere’s the full changelog: \n“Improved messaging – drag and drop files (up to 300MB) and images up to 300MB in chat to quickly share them, right click on the message and select “Quote Message” so you will know who said what in instant message chats, see an image preview of a shared URL rather than a long link, and stay on top of unread messages with an unread message indicator in chat. \nEnhanced profiles – start a call or conversation from a contact’s profile page, add/remove/block contacts, view initials of a contact if they don’t have a profile picture, and unblock blocked contacts. \nEasier calling – manage audio/video devices from Skype settings to select a preferred camera, microphone or speaker and test audio before a call. \nAdditional Windows Mobile updates – video calls will default to loud speaker for video calls and improved back button navigation.” \nAll these options are, for now, only available to Windows Insiders of Windows 10 Preview Program. We don’t know when Microsoft will introduce them to regular users. The first guess is that it will be with the Creators Update , but the company may easily bring the update earlier. \nTo download the latest update for Skype Preview, go to the Windows Store, and check for updates. Or you can download the latest version of the app directly from the Store. \nRELATED STORIES YOU NEED TO CHECK OUT:",

      "text": "\nIf you didn't notice, last week Microsoft started up yet another promotion to push Xbox One S units. This has been a tried-and-true method from Microsoft, and as far as we can tell it has been strongly effective even when the holiday season is right around the corner.\nUntil November 12, when you buy an Xbox One S at select retailers , you'll be able to receive an additional free game of your choice based on the retailer's catalog. Certain retailers have taken a new spin on this promotion and added their own flare - making the deals even more noteworthy, particularly for people that simply can't wait until Black Friday to secure an Xbox One S.\nWalmart/eBay Deals \nXbox One S 2TB Gears of War 4 Limited Edition Bundle — $399.99 Xbox One S 1TB Gears of War 4 Bundle + Infinite Warfare — $329.99 Xbox One S Battlefield 1 Bundle + Free Game + 4K Movie + Controller — $299 Microsoft Store Deals \nXbox One S Battlefield 1 1TB Console Bundle + The Crew + Free Game — $349 Xbox One S Battlefield 1 Storm Grey + The Crew + Free Game — $299 Xbox One S Gears of War 4 Storm Grey Bundle + The Crew + Free Game — $299 Xbox One S Minecraft Bundle + The Crew + Free Game — $299 Xbox One S FIFA 17 Bundle + The Crew + Free Game — $299 From the batch of deals above, the most noteworthy one would be Walmart where you can pick from 3 Xbox One S bundles and receive a free game of your choice from an option of 7. You'll also receive a free Blu-ray movie from selection of 8 and finally you get to pick one extra controller. That's a crapload of stuff for just $299.\nFor those needing a bit more space,both the 1TB an 2TB Gears of War 4 bundle are on sale at eBay for a slight discount. If you go with the 1TB unit of Gears of War 4 bundle, you'll even receive a free copy of Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare for free. That's like $10 value if you trade it in at GameStop! (Actual value may vary...)\nAt Microsoft Store, they are offering the free game promotion where you can choose from about 18 options in their store catalog along with a free copy of The Crew (because you know, having infinite supply of Ubisoft games to give away is kind of Microsoft's M.O. now).",

      "text": "Former Microsoft exec Anoop Gupta, Telo CEO and co-founder, with Aravind Bala, CTO and co-founder. (GeekWire File Photo / Todd Bishop) Telo, a messaging startup led by former Microsoft executive and distinguished scientist Anoop Gupta, has raised $2.2 million in funding in its pursuit of a new communication service that empowers and delivers value to recipients of messages, rather than senders or social networks.\nThe seed round was disclosed in an SEC filing this week and confirmed by Gupta, Telo’s CEO, who said via email that the startup has brought on board “some incredible investors” from both the Bay Area and the Seattle region. The company isn’t yet identifying those investors or talking in detail about its plans.\nHowever, in an earlier interview with GeekWire , Gupta and co-founder Aravind Bala , a former Microsoft partner engineering manager, talked about their goals through a series of “what if” questions: What if users had a public address that they could share confidently, where they could receive relevant messages in a system that enabled meaningful interactions and conversations, discouraged misuse and spam, and provided value to recipients?\nHere’s how the company’s website explains the concept.\nTelo lets you decide who you want to hear from and which topics you are interested in connecting about. You establish the guidelines for that communication without interference from Internet advertisers or recruiters seeking to leverage your network for their own means. If somebody wants to reach out to you outside of those guidelines, they pay for that communication just as they would an ad except, with Telo, the money comes to you – keep the money or send it to a charity of your choosing.\nOn his LinkedIn page , Gupta writes that the company believes “life-changing opportunities arise when we move beyond the familiar, exploring options beyond what is known to us, reaching out beyond our immediate network of co-workers and friends.” The goal is to provide professionals “with visibility, transparency and access to the landscape of opportunities available to them – and the means to find, reach and be reached by people who can help them seize those opportunities.”\nGupta left Microsoft in November after nearly 20 years, including two years as technical assistant to Bill Gates, and four years leading Microsoft’s Unified Communications Group. He was an associate computer science professor at Stanford University from 1987 to 1997, also serving as co-founder and chief scientist at the startup VXtreme in Sunnyvale, Calif., based on early virtual classroom technologies developed at Stanford.\nBala, a 15-year Microsoft veteran, spent time on products including Windows, Bing and AdCenter before working with Gupta on the Office Mix presentation service.\nTelo, based in Bellevue, Wash., was originally founded under the name ZipStorm. The company is currently accepting signups for its waitlist for the forthcoming Telo service.",

      "text": "Data Manipulation with sparklyr on Azure HDInsight \nby Ali Zaidi, Data Scientist at Microsoft Apache Spark and a Tale of APIs \nSpark is an exceptionally popular processing engine for distributed data. Dealing with data in distributed storage and programming with concurrent systems often requires learning complicated new paradigms and techniques. Statisticans and data scientists familiar wtih R are unlikely to have much experience with such systems. Fortunately, Spark is a very intuitive distributed computing platform, and there are APIs available in R and Python that are more familiar to the average data scientist than scala. \nOne of the most intriguing APIs available for Spark for R users is the sparkapi package developed by RStudio and the associated sparklyr project, which provides a very similar dplyr syntax for manipulating Spark DataFrames. Azure HDInsight \nAzure HDInsight is the Microsoft developed Apache Hadoop distribution for the cloud. The Hadoop ecosystem is a wild zoo of components, and configuring them together can be a difficult job. Microsoft's Azure HDInsight service gives data scientists and analysts the most exciting capabilities of distributed computing on the cloud without the hassle of configuration and management. In this post, I will show how we can utilize premium Spark clusters with a complete installation of Microsoft R's stack for doing data manipulation at scale. Provisioning \nTo provision Azure HDInsight Spark clusters with Microsoft R Server, follow the instructions on the Azure Documentation Page , or my Spark course repository . To create a cluster, simply navigate to your portal and select a new HDInsight cluster: \nOn the Azure portal page, you will be asked to select a subscription, and also provide some security credentials to access your cluster via a secure terminal connection (SSH). \nMake sure you select the premium option to get the awesome features of Microsoft R Server: \nA follow up blog post will show you how to develop scalable machine learning models using the Microsoft R Server machine learning libraries. Spark DataFrames and Spark SQL \nIn order to accommodate the variety of workloads a data scientist encounters during her work, Spark contains four core pieces aimed at a specific use-case: \nThe component aimed at data manipulation workloads is the Spark SQL component . Inside the Spark SQL context, Spark developers create DataFrames, which are a schematic versions of RDDs (Resilient Distributed Datasets). RDDs are the standard primitive of data in the Spark ecosystem, and can be thought of as distributed lists. However, just as lists are somewhat too general for the workloads necessitated by data manipulation in R, RDDs are also too general for data analysis workloads in Spark. By injecting a schema of columns (type schema and equality of rows), DataFrames are born. Functional Programming and the Art of Being Lazy \nThe majority of Spark is written in Scala (~80% of Spark core), which is a functional programming language. Functional programming languages emphasize functional purity (the output only depends on the inputs) and strive to avoid side-effects. One important component of most functional programming languages is their lazy evaluation. While it might seem odd that we would appreciate laziness from our computing tools, lazy evaluation is an effective way of ensuring computations are evaluated in the most efficient manner possible. \nLazy evaluation allows Spark SQL to highly optimize the queries. When a user submits a query to Spark SQL, Spark composes the components of the SQL query into a logical plan. The logical plan is basically a recipe Spark SQL creates in order to evaluate the desired query. Spark SQL then submits the logical plan to its highly optimized engine called Catalyst , which optimizes this plan into a physical plan of action that is executed inside Spark computation engine (a series of coordinating JVMs). Spark SQL and dplyr \nSome of the more R-enthusiastic readers might already see where this is going. Since Spark SQL is Spark's core component of doing data analysis, why can't we just use our favorite SQL-like paradigm in R to connect to Spark as an inteface? For many an R user, the only package that brings up memories of love and joy for data analysis is dplyr . \nMore than just being an awesome package with a simple to understand grammar , dplyr is highly extensible and works hand-in-hand with SQL. It supports working with many SQL databases by utilizing that database engine as it's backend, and converting/translating all of it's verbs into SQL statements. For more information on working with databases using dplyr , see the package's vignette on databases . Take a look at dplyr 's translate_sql function to see how it converts dplyr verbs into SQL statements. \nThe sparklyr package takes advantage of dplyr's SQL connectivity and R's lazy evaluation procedures by sending all the dplyr operations to Spark SQL. Therefore, as an R user, you don't need to write anything but dplyr to get the awesomeness of Spark SQL and Catalyst! Spark Context \nIn order to start using Spark as our computation engine, we need to define a Spark context (or Spark Session). We will use the sparklyr function spark_connect to create a Spark SQL context. There are a slew of arguments you can use to modify the parameters of your Spark SQL context, but we will stick to the defaults. By specifying yarn-client as our master, we are telling Spark we want a yarn client application. Full an overview of the environments on which you can run spark, take a look at the documentation page here . library(sparklyr) sc <- spark_connect( \"yarn-client\" ) Import Into Spark DataFrames \nIn my cluster's storage account on Azure HDInsight, I have loaded data from Freddie Mac's single family loan database . I then use the spark_read_csv function to read my folder of mortgage originations data into a Spark DataFrame. origins <- file.path( \"wasb://mrs-spark@alizaidi.blob.core.windows.net\" , \"user/RevoShare/alizaidi/Freddie/Acquisition\" ) freddie_origins <- spark_read_csv(sc, path = origins, name = 'freddie_origins' , header = FALSE , delimiter = \"|\" ) Using dplyr to Query our Spark DataFrame \nThe resulting object from the above operation is a Spark DataFrame. If we peek at it's class, we notice that in addition to being a tbl_spark object, it is also of class tbl_sql , so all dplyr methods are converted to Spark SQL statements and run on the spark application defined through the spark context sc . class(freddie_origins) ## [1] \"tbl_spark\"\"tbl_sql\"\"tbl_lazy\"\"tbl\" library(dplyr) freddie_origins %>% head ## Source: query [?? x 25] ## Database: spark connection master=yarn-client app=sparklyr local=FALSE ## ## V1 V2 V3 V4 V5 V6 V7 V8 V9 V10 V11 ## <chr><int><chr><int><int><chr><int><chr><dbl><chr><int> ## 1 751 199910 N 202909 NA 000 1 O 71 20 180000 ## 2 733 199909 N 202908 29540 000 1 O 51 116000 ## 3 755 199905 N 202904 29540 30 1 O 95 38 138000 ## 4 669 200206 N 202901 NA 000 1 O 80 33 162000 ## 5 732 199904 N 202903 17140 000 1 O 25 10 53000 ## 6 715 199904 N 202903 17140 000 1 O 67 35 91000 ## # ... with 14 more variables: V12 <int>, V13 <dbl>, V14 <chr>, V15 <chr>, ## # V16 <chr>, V17 <chr>, V18 <chr>, V19 <int>, V20 <chr>, V21 <chr>, ## # V22 <int>, V23 <int>, V24 <chr>, V25 <chr> \nTherefore, we can do any our common dplyr operations directly on this Spark DataFrame, and through the magic of method dispatch in R, the operations are converted to SQL and sent to Catalyst for evaluation in Spark SQL. freddie_rename <- freddie_origins %>% rename( credit_score = V1, first_payment = V2, first_home = V3, maturity = V4, msa = V5, mi_perc = V6, num_units = V7, occ_status = V8, cltv = V9, dti = V10, upb = V11, ltv = V12, orig_rate = V13, channel = V14, ppm = V15, prod_type = V16, state = V17, prop_type = V18, post_code = V19, loan_number = V20, loan_purpose = V21, orig_term = V22, num_borrowers = V23, seller = V24, servicer = V25 ) freddie_rename %>% head ## Source: query [?? x 25] ## Database: spark connection master=yarn-client app=sparklyr local=FALSE ## ## credit_score first_payment first_home maturity msa mi_perc num_units ## <chr><int><chr><int><int><chr><int> ## 1 751 199910 N 202909 NA 000 1 ## 2 733 199909 N 202908 29540 000 1 ## 3 755 199905 N 202904 29540 30 1 ## 4 669 200206 N 202901 NA 000 1 ## 5 732 199904 N 202903 17140 000 1 ## 6 715 199904 N 202903 17140 000 1 ## # ... with 18 more variables: occ_status <chr>, cltv <dbl>, dti <chr>, ## # upb <int>, ltv <int>, orig_rate <dbl>, channel <chr>, ppm <chr>, ## # prod_type <chr>, state <chr>, prop_type <chr>, post_code <int>, ## # loan_number <chr>, loan_purpose <chr>, orig_term <int>, ## # num_borrowers <int>, seller <chr>, servicer <chr> \nThe origination date is buried inside the loan number field. We will pick it out by indexing the loan number substring: freddie_rename %>% select(loan_number) ## Source: query [?? x 1] ## Database: spark connection master=yarn-client app=sparklyr local=FALSE ## ## loan_number ## <chr> ## 1 F199Q1 1 ## 2 F199Q1 2 ## 3 F199Q1 3 ## 4 F199Q1 4 ## 5 F199Q1 5 ## 6 F199Q1 6 ## 7 F199Q1 7 ## 8 F199Q1 8 ## 9 F199Q1 9 ## 10 F199Q1000010 ## # ... with more rows \nObserve that year field is augmented with the quarter field and then some additional loan identification numbers. We will extract that by using some very simple string operations: freddie_rename <- freddie_rename %>% mutate(orig_date = substr(loan_number, 3 , 4 ), year = as.numeric(substr(loan_number, 3 , 2 ))) freddie <- freddie_rename %>% mutate(orig_year = paste0(ifelse(year < 10 , \"200\" , ifelse(year > 16 , \"19\" , \"20\" )), year)) freddie <- freddie %>% mutate(orig_year = substr(orig_year, 1 , 4 )) freddie %>% head ## Source: query [?? x 28] ## Database: spark connection master=yarn-client app=sparklyr local=FALSE ## ## credit_score first_payment first_home maturity msa mi_perc num_units ## <chr><int><chr><int><int><chr><int> ## 1 751 199910 N 202909 NA 000 1 ## 2 733 199909 N 202908 29540 000 1 ## 3 755 199905 N 202904 29540 30 1 ## 4 669 200206 N 202901 NA 000 1 ## 5 732 199904 N 202903 17140 000 1 ## 6 715 199904 N 202903 17140 000 1 ## # ... with 21 more variables: occ_status <chr>, cltv <dbl>, dti <chr>, ## # upb <int>, ltv <int>, orig_rate <dbl>, channel <chr>, ppm <chr>, ## # prod_type <chr>, state <chr>, prop_type <chr>, post_code <int>, ## # loan_number <chr>, loan_purpose <chr>, orig_term <int>, ## # num_borrowers <int>, seller <chr>, servicer <chr>, orig_date <chr>, ## # year <dbl>, orig_year <chr> Calculate Average Credit Score by Year \nNow that we have created features defining the quarter and year of the mortgage origination, we can create a summary of average credit attributes by year. For example, here's the average credit score by year for each state: fico_year <- freddie %>% group_by(orig_year, state) %>% summarise(ave_fico = mean(credit_score)) %>% collect fico_year %>% head ## Source: local data frame [6 x 3] ## Groups: orig_year [6] ## ## orig_year state ave_fico ## <chr><chr><dbl> ## 1 2008 NM 730.7395 ## 2 2012 WI 769.2008 ## 3 2011 KS 763.1039 ## 4 2006 WI 728.6378 ## 5 2014 AR 750.9074 ## 6 2015 MI 752.5942 \nEven though we are using Spark to do most of computation, we can still proceed as though we were working entirely in R. For example, we could create a function for evaluating the average credit attribute, which will make it easier to obtain different summarizations: year_state_sum <- function (val = \"credit_score\" ) { library(lazyeval) year_state <- freddie %>% group_by(orig_year, state) %>% summarise_(sum_val = interp( ~ mean(var), var = as.name(val))) year_state <- year_state %>% collect names(year_state)[ 3 ] <- paste0( \"ave_\" , val) return (year_state) } Summarize, Plot, ...?, Profit! \nWhile our original dataset was very large, our resulting aggregated result is pretty small. The length of the output is just the number of years of data we have times the number of states: \n$$ \\text{number of rows} = \\sum years \\times\\sum states $$ \nTherefore, we could collect that object into a local R data.frame and plot it using the plethora of plotting libraries in R. In this case, we have data at the state-level, so I will use the awesome rMaps to make a htmlwidget containing average debt-to-income by state and year: library(rMaps) year_state_sum( \"dti\" ) %>% mutate(year = as.numeric(orig_year)) %>% rMaps :: ichoropleth(ave_dti ~ state, data = ., animate = \"year\" , geographyConfig = list(popupTemplate = \"#!function(geo, data) { return '<div class=\\\"hoverinfo\\\"><strong>'+ data.state + '<br>' + 'Average DTI in '+ data.year + ': ' + data.ave_dti.toFixed(2)+ '</strong></div>';}!#\" )) -> state_dti state_dti $ save( \"StateMapDTI.html\" , cdn = T ) htmltools :: includeHTML( \"StateMapDTI.html\" ) \nClick here for a larger version without the scrollbar. The End \nThank you for reading! If this post was interesting, I welcome you to check out my course on R and Spark here and my in-development booklet on Spark and R . I also spoke about Spark and R at the recent Spark Summit in Brussels, and you can find the recording of that talk here . Thanks!",

      "text": "Microsoft smartphone company in trouble? On Cell Phone Forums 5 USA giant has just announced the number of sales they made in the Q3 2016 and it doesn't look good. The company sold only 2.3 million Lumia phones in the quarter, which is a huge drop, when looking at the previous year where they sold total of 8.6 million Lumias. Even the previous quarter had a number of 4.5 million Lumia units, so it is nearly 50% less right now. The same can be said about non-lumia models which number came to 15.7 million units, down from the 24.7 million figure it reported the same time last year. The American Giant might have a big problem, if they don't find a way to improve their products as well as services offered.

      "text": "Home / News / Xbox News / Microsoft just price slashed the original Xbox One Microsoft just price slashed the original Xbox One \nby Joe Roberts Read Comments \nNow that it's launched the Xbox One S, and with Project Scorpio soon to be unveiled, Microsoft has decided it's time to get rid of a few of its original Xbox One consoles. \nThe company has taken a hefty amount off the price of the Xbox One, which you can now pick up from the online store with prices starting at £179.99 for the 500Gb bundles – that's down from £249.99. \nFor that price you can get a variety of bundles, including the Gears of War: Ultimate Edition pack, which also comes with a free copy of Forza Horizon 3. \nRelated: Xbox One vs Xbox One S \nThere's also the Quantum Break bundle, or you can go for the '2 free games' option which nets you the 500GB console with Forza and Halo 5. \nIf you're looking for a tad more storage, you can always pick up one of the 1TB bundles, which now start at £199.99 – down from £299.99. \nConsidering you'll save £100 and get a free game, the 1TB deals seem like the most tempting to us, but there's a load of options on offer. \nThe Xbox One Elite controller \nThe Xbox One Elite, which comes with a fancy controller that lets you swap out buttons, has also been discounted from £299.99 to £199.99. \nMicrosoft is running the promotion until December 2, so make sure you get your order in before then. \nRelated: Xbox One S \nThe company is gearing up to unveil the long-awaited Project Scorpio: a more powerful version of the console that Xbox head of games marketing Aaron Greenberg says will \"change the way we think about the future of console gaming.\" \nWhile it remains to be seen whether Microsoft can live up to such lofty promises, there's every reason to take advantage of the price cuts that come ahead of Scorpio's unveiling. \nThe original Xbox One may be a bulky machine, but it's still considered 'current-gen' in terms of consoles, and is capable of running all the games the Xbox One S can. \nWATCH: Xbox One S review \nLet us know if you pick up one of the consoles. 0 shares",

      "text": "ZDNet Japan What's happening with Microsoft's Skype messaging everywhere feature The Skype messaging everywhere (SMS Relay) feature is slowly but surely moving ahead, and not just for Windows or Skype Insiders only. \nMicrosoft is slowly but surely bringing its promised 'Messaging Everywhere' feature to users across devices. Credit: Microsoft \nIn late June, just a month before finalizing the Windows 10 Anniversary Update, Microsoft decided to remove its \"Messaging Everywhere\" feature from that build of Windows 10. Instead, officials said, that capability would become part of the updated Universal Windows Platform version of Skype. Read More \nAt that time, Microsoft continued to enable users with Windows Phones and Android phones who had Cortana installed on both their phones and Windows 10 PCs to continue to reply to text messages between their devices. \nLast week, Microsoft made an updated preview build of the Skype UWP app available to Windows 10 users (not just Windows Insiders). That preview build included the \"Messaging Everywhere\" (officially christened SMS Relay) to the application. However, the updated Skype PC preview only supports SMS messaging between Windows Phones running Windows 10 Mobile and PCs running Windows 10 -- though Microsoft officials confirmed that Microsoft will bring SMS Relay to Android \"in the future.\" \nMicrosoft also quietly disabled the ability to message between Windows 10 PCs and Windows Phones and Android phones without relying on Skype last week. Previously, if Cortana was installed on both devices, that type of communication worked without requiring the SMS Relay feature in Skype Preview. \n\"We have temporarily disabled the capability in Cortana on Windows Phone 10 and the Cortana Android companion app that enables you to receive text messages to your PC while we evaluate an experience issue which we are working to resolve. We will bring this capability back into the experience as soon as possible,\" a Microsoft spokesperson confirmed. \nLast week's updated Skype Preview (version 11.9) for Windows 10 PCs and Phones also added the ability to connect to Skype for Business users, as well as some fixes and updates to calling and chatting fin the preview app. \nIn other Skype news, Microsoft launched its Skype Insider program on November 8. (I had heard of individuals claiming to be Skype Insiders before today, but it seems today is the \"official\" launch of the testing program.) Like the Office Insider and Windows Insider program, Skype Insiders will be able to give early feedback on coming features. Microsoft also renamed its Xbox Preview Program to Xbox Insider Program yesterday, and made it no longer an invitation-only test program. \nAlso, though I'm a bit late to this one, Microsoft did make the RTM version of Skype for Business on Mac generally available late last month, in case anyone hadn't heard.

      "title": "Microsoft Announces Xbox Insider Program, Welcomes All Gamers To Join And Provide Feedback",
      "text": "by Brandon Hill — Tuesday, November 08, 2016 Microsoft Announces Xbox Insider Program, Welcomes All Gamers To Join And Provide Feedback Microsoft has been hinting at consolidating its Xbox Preview Program and Windows Insider Program for quite some time. After all, the Xbox One shares a codebase with Windows 10 , and as Windows Chief Terry Myerson stated in March, “It doesn’t make sense for these to be separate.”\nToday, Microsoft is taking the first step towards harmonizing its public software testing regimen by renaming the Xbox Preview Program to the Xbox Insider Program. “Since the program launched in February 2014, your feature requests, ideas, and millions of votes have helped shape and improve your Xbox experience for the whole community,” writes Xbox Live chief Larry “ Major Nelson ” Hyrb. \nAs for the name change, Major Nelson explains, “This new name reflects how we are expanding to offer opt-in opportunities to provide feedback on Game and App Previews alongside System Update previews.” The Xbox Preview Dashboard has also received a name change, and is now known as the Xbox Insider Hub. \nSome of the other changes included with the refreshed Xbox Insider Hub include: Personalization to give you more relevant announcements, quests, and Insider content opportunities to get early access to select games and apps A new UI, inspired by the New Xbox One Experience, makes it easier to find the right info and provide more robust feedback The Xbox Insider profile card where your contributions in the program come front and center Support for multiple users on a console to participate and provide feedback \nIf you’re a long-time member of the Xbox Preview program that has provided plenty of feedback to Microsoft over the years, you’ll be among the first to sample the new Xbox Insider Hub, which goes live today. The new Xbox Insider Preview will eventually be rolled out to all current Xbox Preview participants by the end of the month. \nThe other big change is that the Xbox Insider Preview (including the Xbox Insider Hub) is being opened to all Xbox One users. However, if you are a new tester looking to score early system updates, you’ll likely be disappointed. “Xbox system updates will currently be limited to those already testing them (not open to new members), as we still have a huge number of volunteers already doing a great job testing and providing feedback,” added Major Nelson.",

      "text": "November 08, 2016 at 13:06 PM EST NooBaa Announces Microsoft Partnership: Azure Marketplace Availability and Accelerator Participation PRWeb \nNooBaa today announced a strategic partnership with Microsoft, which includes NooBaa's native integration with Azure Blob Storage, availability of the NooBaa software-based storage solution in the Microsoft Azure Marketplace, and Microsoft's selection of NooBaa as a member in the Microsoft Accelerator program. \nNooBaa's software solution provides a new architecture for a flexible compute and storage fabric that seamlessly spans enterprise datacenters and public cloud providers. In addition to supporting heterogeneous on-premises storage resources, NooBaa now allows customers to pool public cloud capacity from Microsoft's Azure Blob Storage in addition to other cloud providers. NooBaa's support for multiple public clouds reduces vendor lock-in and facilitates simple application and data migration between resource pools. \nThe NooBaa storage solution is now also available directly through the Microsoft Azure Marketplace. NooBaa represents the first multi-cloud-capable storage solution in the Marketplace and provides access to Azure Blob Storage capacity via the popular S3 API, which has emerged as a de-facto standard for Dev-Ops and cloud computing. The NooBaa Azure Marketplace Edition can be deployed for free and automatically integrates with Azure compute and capacity resources. \nIn addition to NooBaa's availability in the Azure Marketplace, NooBaa has also been selected by Microsoft to join the exclusive Microsoft Accelerator program . The Accelerator program provides NooBaa working space, and valuable access to mentoring, funding, facilities, and direct access to Microsoft customers. According to Navot Volk, Managing Director of Microsoft Accelerator, \"We only accept 3.5% of the applicants into the accelerator so we're extremely selective about the companies we work with. NooBaa is unique because their technology is impressive, they deliver a unique value proposition for Microsoft's IT customers, and they align perfectly with Microsoft's strategic vision for hybrid computing.\" \nAccording to James Staten, Microsoft's Chief Strategist for Cloud & Enterprise, \"This blended model lets you stop worrying about where your apps are, and focus more on how to leverage the right resources for the right value...hybrid is not a temporary state but the new normal.\" NooBaa supports hybrid computing by creating and automating a continuous capacity fabric across on-premises and public cloud resources, with flexible capabilities for data placement and migration. With NooBaa, customers can more easily move workloads between cloud providers without application changes. \n\"It's becoming clear that Microsoft is going to be a dominant market force for enterprise hybrid cloud computing over the next few years. Being admitted to the Accelerator was a huge win because it allows us to focus on important things like Azure integration and customer feedback,\" according to Yuval Dimnik, NooBaa's CEO, \"we're getting access to some amazing people and resources that are accelerating our progress. Plus I have to say the food is amazing!\" \nAbout NooBaa NooBaa is the new way for enterprises to create and consume cloud services. It allows large enterprises to improve flexibility while reducing vendor lock-in and costs. Co-founded in 2013 by leading storage and security experts Yuval Dimnik and Guy Margalit, NooBaa has offices in Herzliya, Israel and Silicon Valley, California. Privately-held, NooBaa has received venture capital funding from JVP , OurCrowd and prominent industry leaders.

      "text": "Xbox Preview Program Opening Up To All Xbox Owners   08:10 PST \nMicrosoft launched the Xbox Preview Program back in February 2014 to make it easier for console owners to give feedback, make feature requests, and share ideas with the company about how it can make the Xbox better for them. The company today announced that it’s opening up the Xbox Preview Program to all Xbox owners, it’s also renaming it to the Xbox Insider Program. \nMicrosoft says that the name change reflects how it’s expanding to provide opt-in opportunities for console owners to give feedback on Game and App Previews alongside System Update previews. \nIt has rebuilt the Xbox Preview Dashboard from the ground up based on fan feedback. The dashboard is now called Xbox Insider Hub and it’s personalized to give console owners more relevant announcements, quests, and Insider content opportunities for early access to select apps and games. \nThe dashboard also gets a new user interface that’s inspired by the New Xbox One Experience so that it’s easier for users to find the right information and provide more robust feedback. It’s adding support for multiple users on a console to participate and provide feedback as well. \nMicrosoft is rolling out these changes today to a small number of preview members who provided the most feedback since this program was launched more than two years ago. It confirms that the Xbox Insider Program will soon be open to all Xbox owners. \nFiled in Gaming . Read more about Microsoft . Source: majornelson Related Articles",

      "text": "Microsoft May Have Cancelled Xbox TV Streaming Devices   08:00 PST \nIt was rumored earlier this year that Microsoft would launch at least one of its Xbox TV streaming devices at some point in 2016 but that didn’t happen at the E3 convention where the company launched the Xbox One S and also unveiled Project Scorpio. It didn’t actually talk about the streaming devices at the event where it had some major hardware announcements to make. Now, if a new report is to be believed, Microsoft has actually decided to give up on the Xbox TV streaming devices altogether. \nThe Xbox TV streaming device was believed to be an HDMI dongle much like the Google Chromecast. It would have been a $99 dongle that was capable of running Universal Windows Platform applications and even light UWP games. The new report claims that Microsoft was pretty much done with the development of this device and that it was due to order 300,000 units for production but it decided to shelve the product. \nIt’s said that Microsoft wasn’t actually planning on unveiling Project Scorpio at E3 this year but the leaks and Sony’s announcement of the PlayStation 4 Pro forced the company’s hand. For now, it appears that Microsoft has canceled the dongle as it wants the spotlight to remain firmly on its consoles. \nWhether or not the company decides to come out with this streaming stick at some point in the future remains to be seen. Microsoft has not yet confirmed if that’s ever going to happen. \nFiled in Gadgets . Read more about Microsoft and Xbox . Source: windowscentral Related Articles",

      "text": "Silwood Extends Application Metadata Intelligence Capabilities With Launch of Safyr® for Microsoft Dynamics AX PRWeb Published 10:00   \nMicrosoft's presence in the ERP and CRM packaged application space is growing quickly and as a result there is an increasing need for the data from those systems to be incorporated into their customers' enterprise information ecosystems. Silwood Technology, the leaders in Application Metadata Intelligence solutions, have extended the capabilities of Safyr® to address the challenge of accessing, understanding and exploiting the underlying data model of Microsoft Dynamics AX to accelerate delivery of data and information led projects. Ascot, UK (PRWEB) November 08, 2016 \nSilwood Technology Ltd today announces the release of Safyr® 6.4, the latest version of the world’s most advanced Application Metadata Intelligence solution. Safyr 6.4 includes a number of major enhancements including the ability to allow users to extract and analyse metadata from Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012. \nMicrosoft's presence in the ERP and CRM packaged application space is growing quickly and Silwood have moved to address the challenge many organisations face when trying to access, understand and exploit the underlying data model of Dynamics AX. \nAs with virtually all large complex enterprise systems, there is no built in easy intuitive way of finding and comprehending the metadata underpinning Microsoft Dynamics AX. For organisations who are trying to incorporate Dynamics AX data in Data Warehouse, Big Data, Master Data Management, Data Integration, Enteprise Metadata Management and Data Governance projects the problems associated with locating the right data tables often results in delays, overspend and poor quality. \nWith the release of Safyr 6.4, Silwood has advanced the capabilities of the product by introducing an additional module which provides support for extracting metadata from Microsoft Dynamics AX. This reflects that application’s growing importance as a critical system of record for many organisations. More information is available here: http://www.silwoodtechnology.com/products/ms-dynamics-ax-metadata-discovery/ \nAmongst other general enhancements to Safyr, Silwood have made significant improvements to the ‘Compare’ functions to make it easier to locate differences between the metadata in two instances of the same package. \nRoland Bullivant, Sales and Marketing Director of Silwood Technology commented: \"We are delighted to be announcing this new version of Safyr, the world's leading software product for Application Metadata Intelligence. We have been seeing a steady increase in the number of customers who are seeking to access and understand the metadata in their Microsoft Dynamics AX systems in order to support information and data led projects. Safyr 6.4 is a response to that demand and another major step in our vision to deliver a centre of excellence for metadata discovery, scoping and delivery across enterprise packages.” \nSafyr gives control of how and when to access and use application metadata to those who need it most - the data architects and analysts who are charged with delivering information and data management projects of all kinds.

      "title": "Introduction to Microsoft Intune",
      "text": "\nIn today’s Ask the Admin , I’ll provide an overview of Microsoft Intune.\nPart of Microsoft’s Enterprise Mobility + Security solution, Intune handles the task of managing PCs and mobile devices, such as Windows 10 tablets, Android phones and Apple iPads. At the heart of Intune is Mobile Device Management (MDM), which is a set of standards for managing mobile devices and provides features similar to, but not as comprehensive as Group Policy. MDM is not a Microsoft technology, so Group Policy remains the best solution for managing domain-joined Windows devices.\n \n \nA relatively recent addition to Intune is Mobile Application Management (MAM), allowing organizations to manage Microsoft mobile apps without users needing to enroll their devices. In BYOD scenarios, users are often reluctant to enroll devices with MDM because it means handing over complete control to IT. MAM is a compromise that gives organizations some control over how business data is used on devices not owned by the company. Finally, mobile app security gives organizations the ability to isolate business data so that corporate files can be wiped without touching users’ personal information.\nIntegration with Azure Active Directory (AAD) and Azure Rights Management (Azure RMS) provides identity management and data protection, respectively. Intune additionally provides security features required by organizations for managing data and devices, including multi-factor authentication for users enrolling Windows devices to Intune if your organization has the right infrastructure in place. Endpoint Protection for Intune is a managed version of Windows Defender that includes reporting capabilities, and Windows Firewall rules are also configurable.\nMicrosoft Intune (Image Credit: Microsoft)\nIntune can be used as a lightweight alternative to Active Directory. It provides some software distribution features, inventory, limited configuration management for Windows PCs, and remote support options in the form of Remote Assistance for Windows 7, and TeamViewer support for Windows 10. Plus, it’s also possible to use MDM policy to perform remote wipes if a device is lost, and there’s a feature that allows VPN and Wi-Fi profiles to be provisioned for secure access to corporate networks.\nSystem Center Configuration Manager (SCCM) and Intune Intune and SCCM can be integrated to extend SCCM into the cloud for managing mobile devices, providing a central management console for managing all your organization’s devices. But if Intune is quick and easy to deploy, and requires no on-premises infrastructure, a hybrid SCCM/Intune deployment is complex to manage and has a steep learning curve.\nMicrosoft recommends using SCCM, or a hybrid management approach, for organizations with 50,000 or more endpoints, or when management of traditional “fat clients” is required. SCCM provides advanced features not found in Intune, such as the ability to provision Windows to bare metal, Role Based Administration Control (RBAC), advanced reporting, full app inventory, targeting via Collections, and because SCCM moves part of the processing and storage overhead on-site, a hybrid SCCM/Intune deployment scales better than standalone Intune. SCCM also provides access to advanced tooling, such as the SCCM console, PowerShell, and logging.\nSponsored Intune isn’t the only MDM solution on the market, and other products from AirWatch and Citrix are also popular.

      "text": "Microsoft’s Xbox One gaming console has had an interesting year so far. Back at E3 2016, Microsoft unveiled two new Xbox consoles: the sleeker Xbox One S (which was the best gaming console in the US for the third time in a row in September ) and the 4K-enabled Project Scorpio which won’t be released until late 2017. \nAdditionally, Microsoft made significant efforts this year to make Xbox a more powerful consumer brand. Indeed, following the launch of the Windows 10 Anniversary Update the Xbox app has become a true gaming hub on Windows 10 PCs . Furthermore, Microsoft has been promoting cross-platform gameplay experiences through the new Xbox Play Anywhere initiative which lets consumers buy a game once and play it on both the Xbox One and Windows 10 for free. \nHowever, Microsoft reportedly had other plans to make Xbox a bigger consumer play this year. Just a few weeks before E3 2016, blogger Brad Sams revealed on his podcast that Microsoft could release two Xbox streaming devices this year , one about the size of a Chromecast and a larger one which could have been able to run apps and games. Considering that Microsoft’s Xbox One S is still a $300 purchase, both products would have been a more affordable way to access the Xbox and Windows ecosystems on your TV. The Xbox One dashboard. \nAccording to a new report from Windows Central, Microsoft may have ultimately decided to change its plans as rumors about a more powerful Playstation 4 started to materialize: \n“Hobart” was the codename for Microsoft’s Xbox streaming stick, and the device was pretty much ready to go. Microsoft was due to order 300,000 units for manufacture, set to launch a few weeks after E3 2016. A change in plans led to the device being canned, however, and while we don’t know the exact reason why the leak of the PlayStation 4 Pro might have had something to do with it. \nA source familiar with Microsoft’s plans also told Windows Central that Project Hobart would have been priced at $99 and support Windows 10 Universal apps as well as some UWP games. “The stick would also be capable of streaming your Xbox One or Project Scorpio over your home WiFi, presumably via the Windows 10 Xbox app,” added Windows Central. \nWe may never know why Microsoft scrapped Project Hobart, though it wouldn’t be the first time that Microsoft canceled a product late in its development cycle. Microsoft reportedly canned the Microsoft Band 3 earlier this year while Surface fans may remember that a Surface Mini model powered by the unpopular Windows RT was also canceled back in 2014. \nAs Microsoft UWP ecosystem is still immature, the company may well have been right not to release a product targeted at a niche market. Indeed, it probably wouldn’t have been easy to compete with other streaming sticks from Google, Amazon, and Roku. However, bringing Xbox and Windows 10 experiences to the big screen at a cheaper price point than the current Xbox One models should remain on the company’s agenda. Let us know in the comments if you think Microsoft was right to cancel Project Hobart this year. In this story stream:",

      "text": "\nMicrosoft’s Xbox family of devices aims to enhance your entertainment experience both with passive experienced like streaming video and music as well as active experiences like gaming. However, for a while lst yeat Microsoft did branch out briefly into making promotional loungewear for the Xbox – the Xbox Onesie. \nMicrosoft’s Xbox Onesie was first shown off late last August to coincide with the launch of the Xbox One S in Australia. Shortly afterwards, Major Nelson (The face of Microsoft’s Xbox for many as well as Xbox Live’s Director of Programming), announced that he would be giving some away on Twitter, so a few lucky fans were able to get their hands on them with Major Nelson commenting that the distribution of the Onesie was extremely limited – indicating that there were just a small number of Onesies available. The Xbox Onesie resurfaced one last time in when Microsoft offered to let Xbox player add the Xbox Onesie suit to their avatar for a limited time period.\nUnfortunately, hopeful gamers who wanted to get their hands on this comfortable piece of loungewear will have to be disappointed.\nIn a statement to Neowin, Microsoft confirmed that “The Xbox Onesies were for a limited-time activation led by our Xbox Australia team and are no longer available at this time.”\nWould you buy an Xbox Onesie should it become available in the future? Let us know in the comments below.\n",

      "text": "\nMicrosoft have announced that the Xbox Preview program – their Early Access program that lets users play games and go hands on with system updates early before their actual release – will be getting rebranded to Xbox Insider. It also seems like the program will be getting expanded to reflect and do justice to is new name.\nThe new changes will be made available to some Xbox Preview members who have so far been the most active at providing feedback. Over the new few weeks, they should be made available to everyone. If you fall under the purview of active Xbox Preview members, then your app should update automatically overnight.\nXbox Insider will soon be made open to everyone as well, instead of being invite based as it is right now. You can check out the full list of changes coming to the program for yourself below:\nA new name — the Xbox Insider Hub Personalized to give you more relevant announcements, quests, and Insider content opportunities to get early access to select games and apps A new UI, inspired by the New Xbox One Experience, makes it easier to find the right info and provide more robust feedback The Xbox Insider profile card where your contributions in the program come front and center Support for multiple users on a console to participate and provide feedback ",

      "text": "If you didn't notice, last week Microsoft started up yet another promotion to push Xbox One S units. This has been a tried-and-true method from Microsoft, and as far as we can tell it has been strongly effective even when the holiday season is right around the corner.\nUntil November 12, when you buy an Xbox One S at select retailers , you'll be able to receive an additional free game of your choice based on the retailer's catalog. Certain retailers have taken a new spin on this promotion and added their own flare - making the deals even more noteworthy, particularly for people that simply can't wait until Black Friday to secure an Xbox One S.\nWalmart/eBay Deals \nXbox One S 2TB Gears of War 4 Limited Edition Bundle — $399.99 Xbox One S 1TB Gears of War 4 Bundle + Infinite Warfare — $329.99 Xbox One S Battlefield 1 Bundle + Free Game + 4K Movie + Controller — $299 Microsoft Store Deals \nXbox One S Battlefield 1 1TB Console Bundle + The Crew + Free Game — $349 Xbox One S Battlefield 1 Storm Grey + The Crew + Free Game — $299 Xbox One S Gears of War 4 Storm Grey Bundle + The Crew + Free Game — $299 Xbox One S Minecraft Bundle + The Crew + Free Game — $299 Xbox One S FIFA 17 Bundle + The Crew + Free Game — $299 From the batch of deals above, the most noteworthy one would be Walmart where you can pick from 3 Xbox One S bundles and receive a free game of your choice from an option of 7. You'll also receive a free Blu-ray movie from selection of 8 and finally you get to pick one extra controller. That's a crapload of stuff for just $299.\nFor those needing a bit more space,both the 1TB an 2TB Gears of War 4 bundle are on sale at eBay for a slight discount. If you go with the 1TB unit of Gears of War 4 bundle, you'll even receive a free copy of Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare for free. That's like $10 value if you trade it in at GameStop! (Actual value may vary...)\nAt Microsoft Store, they are offering the free game promotion where you can choose from about 18 options in their store catalog along with a free copy of The Crew (because you know, having infinite supply of Ubisoft games to give away is kind of Microsoft's M.O. now).\n\n",

      "text": "100% CLEAN report malware 2 screenshots Convert any number of PDF files to the Microsoft Word DOC format easily, with this easy-to-use application that offers multiple customization options PDF to Word Converter is a small software application developed specifically for helping you convert PDF files to Word documents (DOC file format) with the aid of batch actions. Straightforward layout You are welcomed by a clean and intuitive design that allows you to set up conversion tasks on the fly. PDF files can be imported in the working environment using the built-in browse button or drag-and-drop support. The tool offers only a few details about each file, such as status, filename, path, size, and number of pages. Plus, you can remove items from the list or clear the entire workspace with a single click, and open PDF files via your default viewer. Conversion settings When you add a new file in the working environment, you are asked to configure several conversion settings. You may choose between two conversion modes, namely Easy Reading and Easy Editing. The first one is particularly useful in case you want to preserve the original layout of MS Word boxes (frames), but you should know that it’s pretty difficult to edit the output document. The second mode allows you to maintain the text flow and edit the final file easier, but its style may differ from the original document. What’s more, you are offered the freedom to process all pages, user-defined page numbers, or ranges separated by commas, convert PDF graphics data and tables, as well as disable the mode used for inserting line breaks. In addition, you can make use of batch actions for processing multiple PDF files at the same time, pick the saving directory or make the application save the converted files to the same folder as the source files, and open the saving directory directly from the main window. Tests have pointed out that PDF to Word Converter is quite speedy and provides good output results. It remains light on system resources so the overall performance of the system is not affected. Final words All in all, PDF to Word Converter comes bundled with several handy features for helping you create Word documents out of PDF files, and is suitable for rookies and professionals alike. LIMITATIONS IN THE UNREGISTERED VERSION Only 3 pages from each source document can be processed at a time Nag screen New in PDF to Word Converter 3.60: Improved the conversion process.",

The same window plays a double role: not only that it provides important details on the files to be processed, but it also lets you configure the conversion task per se, all with the help of very simple options. Easily convert entire documents or specific page ranges For instance, you first need to select the source PDF documents and the page range to be converted, with PDF to Excel Converter offering two different settings: all pages or a user-defined range. Furthermore, it can recognize graphical tables and convert them too. Once the new file has been selected, the main screen shows each item along with source folder, size and selected pages information. The output settings are available at the bottom of the window, again with two available options: it can be either the same as source PDF file or a different, user-defined one. Basic batch PDF converter that offers a limited array of features The conversion job doesn't take much time and it all goes very smooth, but we've found some problems when it comes to the original layout of the tables. PDF to Excel Converter doesn't manage to retain the formatting, so you may need to make manual adjustments once the conversion comes to an end. Overall however, PDF to Excel Converter is worth a try, mostly because it supports batch processing too and it comes with so easy to use options.

      "text": "Microsoft Word: Check this out By J. Carlton Collins, CPA Related Information Management and Technology Assurance Q. I can't seem to find the checkmark symbol in Microsoft Word. Can you direct me? A. It has always bothered me that Microsoft Word and PowerPoint do not include a decent checkmark symbol among their thousands of characters and symbols. As CPAs, we are accustomed to using checkmarks for many purposes, for example, to mark completed tasks. We also sometimes use double checkmarks to indicate data that have been rechecked and verified. Nonetheless, a simple checkmark symbol or character is not included in Word or PowerPoint. If you scour Word's and PowerPoint's font sets, you will find a few feeble checkmark options available via the Insert , Symbol tool, as follows. The Symbol font set includes a weird checkmark that resembles a partial square root symbol (√) more than a checkmark, and virtually the same dog - eared character can also be found in the Extended Characters—Plane 14 (√) and the Wide Latin font sets (√). Checkmarks encased in a check box are included in both the Wingdings and Wingdings 2 font sets. Surprisingly, the Wingdings font set includes a spider, a snow skier, and even a motorcycle symbol, but no simple checkmark. How is this possible? To get around this problem, you can visit copypastecharacter.com and select All characters from the menu located in the top center portion of the webpage. Scroll down near the bottom, and you will find a couple of nice, simple checkmark symbols as highlighted in the screenshot below. To use these checkmarks in Word or PowerPoint, if you have Flash installed (as a browser add - on ), simply click the checkmark on the webpage to copy it to your Clipboard, and then paste it into your Word or PowerPoint document (here is an example of the resulting checkmark: ✔ ). (If you don't have Flash installed, then select and copy the symbol using Ctrl+C to copy and Ctrl+V to paste.) Thereafter, the copypastecharacter.com symbol behaves like any other standard letter in your paragraph; for example, it will grow or shrink as you increase or decrease the symbol's font size. (Before I discovered copypastecharacter.com , I sometimes copied and pasted the picture of a checkmark into Word and PowerPoint, which then required me to manually reposition the checkmark image(s) as the paragraph changed, and manually resize the checkmark image(s) if the paragraph font was altered.) Therefore, to recap the benefits of copypastecharacter.com checkmarks, and also to demonstrate the usefulness of using this checkmark to create a bullet list: ✔ This method produces a simple checkmark symbol. ✔ Simply paste the checkmark into your document or slideshow. ✔ Thereafter, the checkmark behaves like a standard character in your paragraph. ✔ The checkmark grows or shrinks as you increase or decrease its font size. \nAbout the author \nJ.

      "text": "Echodyne , a radar array startup with investors including Bill Gates, his Microsoft cofounder Paul Allen's Vulcan Capital, and Seattle's own Madrona Ventures, just made what the company considers a landmark announcement for the future of self-driving vehicles.\nBasically, Echodyne's big breakthrough product is the Metamaterial Electronically Scanning Array (MESA) — a  radar arrays that's small enough to mount on a drone — like the ones Amazon or Google might use for their drone delivery programs — but that the company says is orders of magnitude more powerful than the kind you'd find on existing self-driving cars and drones. \nOn Tuesday, Echodyne announces the successful test of a system that lets drones mounted with MESA automatically detect and evade oncoming aircraft and other obstacles... even when it would otherwise be too far away, too cloudy, or too dark for a human operator to see.\nDrones mounted with Echodyne's system flew several missions over a few days. You can watch one test here:\nYoutube Embed:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/embed/OGy9sDNMm2Q\nWidth: 560px\nHeight: 315px \nIt's a little dry, but stay with it. The important part is that the radar can pick up a decoy made to appear on radar like an oncoming small aircraft or other small drones, even when the camera can't see them on visual, and steer around it. \n\"I can see that drone, and I can see another aircraft,\" says  Echodyne founder and CEO Eben Frankenberg. \nEchodyne \nThis is a big deal, Frankenberg says , because it opens the door for drones to operate further away from human operators. Other startups are working on this problem , but Echodyne says theirs is the first to successfully complete real-world tests. \nRight now, the FAA requires a drone pilot essentially be within eyeshot of the vehicle they're flying, which is no good if you're Amazon and you're trying to send drones all over town. But with the ability to do automatic collision detection, a drone doesn't need a human pilot to be paying attention in order to dodge hazards.  \nEchodyne \nFrankenberg says Echodyne is leaving it up to its customers how to use this so-called \"detect and avoid\" system. There are two options, either leaving it to the vehicle's artificial brain to make the call, or having it suggest a course correction to a human who can approve it. With issues of liabiltiy and safety still up in the air, Echodyne doesn't want to wade into the debate. \n\"It's still unclear what the FAA will be comfortable with, with algorithms,\" Frankenberg says. \nRight now, Echodyne is focused on drones, because that's the biggest market with the most need for this kind of always-aware radar scanner. \nEchodyne \nBut eventually, he says, it could come back down to earth: Self-driving cars from the likes of Uber and Google use a combination of radar and lasers to scan the road, but they lack a certain ability to \"see\" elevation — it can see a tree that's fallen on the road, but if there's a too-low overpass or a falling hazard, Echodyne's MESA would be able to see it before the relatively weaker systems on the car and drive around. \n\"Lasers are not going to be a solution,\" Frankenberg says. \nNOW WATCH: There’s a foldable drone that follows you around by tracking your face \n",

      "text": "\nMore than 6 months ago, we exclusively revealed Microsoft’s upcoming Project Cheshire app . Project Cheshire, for those who don’t know, is Microsoft’s upcoming to-do list app. Over the past couple of months, Microsoft has been making a lot of changes to the app, adding new features and introducing a much better user interface on Windows 10. Today, some more details about the app emerged online. According to a new report from Thurrott, Microsoft’s Project Cheshire app is now in private beta. This could possibly mean that Microsoft may officially launch the app within the next couple of months.\nWhen we initially reported about Project Cheshire back in May, we stated that the app will be available on Windows 10 devices for both PCs and Mobile — and now, it seems like Microsoft also built Cheshire for Android and iOS as well:\n\nProject Cheshire looks like a very neat service, but the important question still remains: why exactly is Microsoft building another to-do list app? The software giant acquired Wunderlist in 2015 , which is believed to be one of the best to-do list apps out there. Additionally, the company also makes OneNote which can also be used a to-do list app. However, as I have reported previously, Project Cheshire could potentially be a major update coming to Wunderlist across all platforms, but it could also be a standalone service as well. As usual, we should have a much better picture when the product is officially launched or in the coming weeks, so make sure to keep an eye on MSPU for more on Cheshire.",

      "text": "Echodyne , a radar array startup with investors including Bill Gates, his Microsoft cofounder Paul Allen's Vulcan Capital, and Seattle's own Madrona Ventures, just made what the company considers a landmark announcement for the future of self-driving vehicles.\nBasically, Echodyne's big breakthrough product is the Metamaterial Electronically Scanning Array (MESA) — a radar arrays that's small enough to mount on a drone — like the ones Amazon or Google might use for their drone delivery programs — but that the company says is orders of magnitude more powerful than the kind you'd find on existing self-driving cars and drones. \nOn Tuesday, Echodyne announces the successful test of a system that lets drones mounted with MESA automatically detect and evade oncoming aircraft and other obstacles... even when it would otherwise be too far away, too cloudy, or too dark for a human operator to see.\nDrones mounted with Echodyne's system flew several missions over a few days. You can watch one test here:\n\nIt's a little dry, but stay with it. The important part is that the radar can pick up a decoy made to appear on radar like an oncoming small aircraft or other small drones, even when the camera can't see them on visual, and steer around it. \n\"I can see that drone, and I can see another aircraft,\" says Echodyne founder and CEO Eben Frankenberg. \n(Echodyne CTO Tom Driscoll (left) and CEO Eben Frankenberg (right) in the radar test chamber in the company offices.Echodyne) \n\nThis is a big deal, Frankenberg says , because it opens the door for drones to operate further away from human operators. Other startups are working on this problem , but Echodyne says theirs is the first to successfully complete real-world tests. \nRight now, the FAA requires a drone pilot essentially be within eyeshot of the vehicle they're flying, which is no good if you're Amazon and you're trying to send drones all over town. But with the ability to do automatic collision detection, a drone doesn't need a human pilot to be paying attention in order to dodge hazards. \n(An Amazon Prime Air drone.AP/Amazon) \n\nFrankenberg says Echodyne is leaving it up to its customers how to use this so-called \"detect and avoid\" system. There are two options, either leaving it to the vehicle's artificial brain to make the call, or having it suggest a course correction to a human who can approve it. With issues of liabiltiy and safety still up in the air, Echodyne doesn't want to wade into the debate. \n\"It's still unclear what the FAA will be comfortable with, with algorithms,\" Frankenberg says. \nRight now, Echodyne is focused on drones, because that's the biggest market with the most need for this kind of always-aware radar scanner. \n(The Echodyne array is a super-small, super-powerful radar array.Echodyne) \n\nBut eventually, he says, it could come back down to earth: Self-driving cars from the likes of Uber and Google use a combination of radar and lasers to scan the road, but they lack a certain ability to \"see\" elevation — it can see a tree that's fallen on the road, but if there's a too-low overpass or a falling hazard, Echodyne's MESA would be able to see it before the relatively weaker systems on the car and drive around. \n\"Lasers are not going to be a solution,\" Frankenberg says. \nNOW WATCH: There’s a foldable drone that follows you around by tracking your face \n\nMore From Business Insider \nTrump says he was just endorsed by Tom Brady and Bill Belichick \nPeople are so excited about this wallet that it’s become the biggest one in Kickstarter history \nDrones may soon deliver medical supplies in Australia",

      "text": "Tim Jonze \nOnce, Apple ads told us that PCs were for dorks. But now its own products are overpriced, dongle-tangled and everywhere. Perhaps it’s time to reopen Windows? The Apple/Peep Show ads were smug and annoying and made you realise Apple didn’t understand Peep Show. Photograph: Apple Contact author   17.07   17.18   \nA bout a decade ago, Apple ran a series of adverts featuring the comedians Mitchell and Webb , designed to highlight the difference between Macs and PCs. They didn’t bother explaining what the spec differences were, or even showing you pictures of the products they were advertising (Alan Sugar would have fired the bladdy useless lot of ’em on the spot). Instead, Apple’s whole purpose was to point out how much cooler their computers were compared with PCs. \nOn the left, David Mitchell was in full Mark Corrigan-mode as the PC, wearing a brown suit and explaining how family holidays are best represented in pie-chart form. On the right, Robert Webb slouched around with his hands in his jeans, breezily explaining how effortlessly creative he was as a Mac. It wasn’t a great advert series. It was smug. It was annoying. And it made you realise that Apple didn’t understand Peep Show . (People rooted for Mark, and Jez wasn’t cool. Super Hans using his MacBook to order psilocybin on the dark web would have been cool, although the Advertising Standards Authority might have had something to say about that.) But you accepted their point: PCs were stuffy, out-of-touch, virus-ridden machines suitable only for grey office drones to run spreadsheets on. Your dad had one, and it kept freezing whenever he tried to show you the email he had received saying he was due £5,000 compensation as the victim of a road accident. The Apple experience, on the other hand, was a constant dress-down Friday full of pictures, music and movies. \nThe reason Apple got away with this ad was because they were – undoubtedly – a very cool company. Throughout the 00s, they changed the way we consumed entertainment and shaped the ways in which we interacted with each other. What is more, they did so in the form of nice white curvy things that, compared with the grey/black boxy PCs, made the world seem like a better place (if, by better, you mean a permanent episode of Black Mirror where we would sooner press handheld blocks of plastic than converse with our friends and family). Apple were so cool they had a quasi-spiritual air to them, with feverish launch events and a leader who singlehandedly pioneered normcore. Compared with all this, what did Microsoft have? Clippy, a crudely animated paperclip that was supposed to help you with writing covering letters. \nThe distressing news, then, for people who have spent approximately the economic output of Moldova on Apple products over the past two decades, is that Apple in 2016 no longer seems very cool. In fact it now seems a bit of a mess, as out-of-touch and unfriendly as Mark Corrigan. Its products look increasingly samey or – worse – plain ugly. Its innovations, such as the Touch Bar, look like the kind of thing a toddler might come up with at an hour’s notice (“Put some iPad ... here!” *toddler points to above the number keys on a nearby laptop*). They raised their already-extortionate prices to cash in on Brexit (technically our fault that one, but still). And they seem to be on a mission to make everything as incompatible and user-unfriendly as possible. Currently, Apple are selling a whopping 17 different dongles for all the different bits their devices no longer serve properly. Meanwhile, their compatibility is a car-crash example of capitalism gone rogue: even the iPhone’s new standard Lightning headphones won’t connect to Apple’s latest line of laptops without an adaptor . It all points to a grand strategy whereby come 2036 you won’t be able to type at all without special gloves that have to be individually purchased to fit each finger, and then will only allow you to spell out the word “plonker”. Where once Apple had an app for things you didn’t imagine were possible, now they have a dongle for things that were perfectly possible before you needed a dongle. \nOh, and on top of all this, they’ve got a CEO called Tim (embarrassing) who wears a fleece and doesn’t seem to think he’s Jesus. It’s all wrong. \nBut if Apple’s cachet is fading, who does that leave us with? Surely not Samsung – its phones literally blow up in your hands . Step forward ... Microsoft and Bill Gates! Once, he was derided as a squeaky-voiced billionaire who couldn’t possibly be as cool as that guy who tucked his roll-neck shirt into stonewashed dad jeans (weird times, looking back now). These days, Microsoft’s co-founder is doing some pretty cool stuff . Such as pouring his billions into philanthropic projects fighting malaria in Africa. And helping to eradicate poverty. Of course, ending life-threatening disease is only technically cool if you can make nice, shiny computers on the side, but Microsoft seems to be sorting that side of things out too. A recent launch event saw it turning its attention to the world’s “creatives” – tempting designers and musicians to cross the bridges and start taking a Surface Pro to their nearest organic coffee store. Is such a shift really possible? It could be. After all, even Clippy seems to have harnessed his valuable retro appeal of late , starring in memes with all the nonchalance of a piece of animated stationery who always knew he was about more than page indentation advice. Have the tables turned? Has Mark finally got the whip hand over Jez? \nThe ball’s in your court, Apple . You were cool once. But now you need to sort out your products and at least try to end measles. Failing that, how about making something we can at least plug a USB stick into?",

      "text": "Things are heating up in the world of workplace chat.\nLast week, Microsoft took the lid off of Teams , a new chatting app aimed squarely at Slack and Atlassian HipChat. In response, Slack took out a full-page ad in the New York Times to “welcome” the Redmond tech giant to the market. Meanwhile, shortly after Teams launched, Microsoft exec Ron Markezich referred to tools like Slack as “applications du jour.”\n“Little companies come and go,” Markezich said in an interview with Business Insider . Harsh!\nAs this chart from Statista shows, though, Microsoft is taking on one of the hottest startups in tech. Since its launch in August 2013, Slack's growth has been like rocketship, and now it claims four million daily active users and 1.25 million paid users.\nStill, Markezich has a point. While Slack hasn’t stopped growing, that growth has started to slow , and there are now legitimate questions over whether or not the app’s simple, relatively feature-lite UI can scale beyond smaller companies. With Teams, Microsoft thinks it can hit startups and the enterprise.\nWill it? We’ll start to find out when Teams launches in early 2017. For now, it’ll be interesting to see how Slack tries to keep the ship fueled.\nStatista \nNOW WATCH: A mysterious cloud moving 700,000 mph is going to collide with our galaxy — here's what will happen \n",

Ahead of Black Friday, Microsoft is offering a bunch of deals on Xbox One bundles , selling the console with two games for £180. \nGames vary depending on which bundle you choose, but among those offered are Forza Horizon 3 , Quantum Break , Rise of the Tomb Raider and Halo 5: Guardians . \nFor £200 you can upgrade to a 1 TB console with Rainbow Six Siege and The Division bundles — both of which include a copy of Gears of War 4 . \nThere’s also the £200 1 TB Xbox One Elite controller bundle if you’re willing to miss out on a game. \nIt’s worth noting, however, that this sale does not include any Xbox One S consoles; it’s the original big-ass Xbox One model that launched in 2013.",

      "text": "0 0 \nCortana is Microsoft’s direct response to Apple’s now iconic voice assistant Siri. The main function of Cortana is that of a voice assistant that helps you complete different tasks, while both providing and soaking up information transmitted verbally. \nIn a recent discovery, it seems that Microsoft have been pushing a patent that intends to make Cortana behave more like a human being, in the way that she greets users across all used platforms. The main issue to Cortana as she is currently, according to Microsoft, is that she isn’t greeting users as a human being would, and that they are trying to fix that. If you had a real life assistant, they wouldn’t greet you with the same exact phrase twice or three times in a day, so if Cortana is to be more realistic, she shouldn’t either. \nThe way Microsoft intends to fix this is by having Cortana soak up personal information and get more accustomed to your preferences, based on your emails, calendar appointments, messages and so on, and personalize each greeting accordingly. An example of this would be that Cortana will greet you by saying “happy birthday” the first time she greets you on your birthday, while secondary encounters will be greeted with something different like “I hope your day is going well”. Cortana will also implement things like sports or weather in her greetings, according to what you like. Cortana will be able to combine greetings as well, taking two different personalized greetings and turning them into a grander, more unique one. \nThe patent is apparently from back in April, but there is no word yet regarding the implementation to live of this update. The feature branches out, requiring compatibility between platforms and tweaking so that Cortana doesn’t sabotage her mobile counterpart or vice versa. \nRELATED STORIES TO CHECK OUT:",

      "text": "Microsoft Surface Pro 5 Release Date, Specs, Price News: Rechargeable Surface Pen Alone Worth The Value Joe Bacaron Nov 08, 2016 11:34 AM EST Share on Facebook Share on Twitter YouTube grabThe Surface Pro 5 release date was rumored this year, but as we enter the fourth quarter of 2016, it seems remote that it's going to happen. \nThe news update on the Microsoft Surface Pro 5 reveals the Stylus Pen, which is now rechargeable. That alone is worth the price of admission. \nAccording to the report from TechRadar , the Stylus Pen will come bundled with the Microsoft Surface Pro 5, which is good news to consumes who won't have to shell out more money in order to purchase an accessory. \nIt noted the patent filing from Microsoft in January this year, which showed a pen that can be recharged over and over again. Owners can stuff triple A batteries into the device, which can also be charged using the dock. \nThis is the edge of the iPad Pro over the current Surface Pro, which is the ability to charge the Apple Pencil by connecting to the device through the Lighting port.   \nHowever, there's no confirmation that the new rechargeable pen will be unveiled along with the Microsoft Surface Pro 5, so this bit of news should be regarded as speculation for now. \nMeanwhile, the Microsoft Surface Pro 5 is reported to be getting the Kaby Lake processor from Intel, which is supposed to be more efficient and faster compared to its predecessor, the Skylake. Aside from that, there are rumors that it's going to feature the Windows 10 Redstone 2 update. \nOne of the better news to come out of the woodworks is that the Microsoft Surface Pro 5 would come with bigger battery life, which was one of the chief complaints for the Surface Pro 4. As to the price, it's reported to cost at least $900 for the entry level when the release date is announced early next year.",

It’s not the soldier with the most expensive gun or the biggest heart who wins on the battlefield. It’s the smartest. Semper fi, Marine. \nYou'll notice that Operation Flashpoint: Red River doesn't have a price next to it, and that's because you can only buy it in Japan. If you live anywhere else, you'll need to use the disc. \nOf course, if you're an Xbox Live Gold member, you should also be taking a look at this month's Games with Gold . You have until the end of the month to claim Super Dungeon Bros (Xbox One) and until the 15th to grab Monkey Island: SE (Xbox 360).

      "text": "Things are heating up in the world of workplace chat. \nLast week, Microsoft took the lid off of Teams , a new chatting app aimed squarely at Slack and Atlassian HipChat. In response, Slack took out a full-page ad in the New York Times to “welcome” the Redmond tech giant to the market. Meanwhile, shortly after Teams launched, Microsoft exec Ron Markezich referred to tools like Slack as “applications du jour.” \n“Little companies come and go,” Markezich said in an interview with Business Insider . Harsh! \nAs this chart from Statista shows, though, Microsoft is taking on one of the hottest startups in tech. Since its launch in August 2013, Slack's growth has been like rocketship, and now it claims four million daily active users and 1.25 million paid users. \nStill, Markezich has a point. While Slack hasn’t stopped growing, that growth has started to slow , and there are now legitimate questions over whether or not the app’s simple, relatively feature-lite UI can scale beyond smaller companies. With Teams, Microsoft thinks it can hit startups and the enterprise. \nWill it? We’ll start to find out when Teams launches in early 2017. For now, it’ll be interesting to see how Slack tries to keep the ship fueled. \nStatista",

      "text": "print \nEchodyne , a radar array startup with investors including Bill Gates, his Microsoft cofounder Paul Allen's Vulcan Capital, and Seattle's own Madrona Ventures, just made what the company considers a landmark announcement for the future of self-driving vehicles. \nBasically, Echodyne's big breakthrough product is the Metamaterial Electronically Scanning Array (MESA) — a radar arrays that's small enough to mount on a drone — like the ones Amazon or Google might use for their drone delivery programs — but that the company says is orders of magnitude more powerful than the kind you'd find on existing self-driving cars and drones. \nOn Tuesday, Echodyne announces the successful test of a system that lets drones mounted with MESA automatically detect and evade oncoming aircraft and other obstacles... even when it would otherwise be too far away, too cloudy, or too dark for a human operator to see. \nDrones mounted with Echodyne's system flew several missions over a few days. You can watch one test here: \nIt's a little dry, but stay with it. The important part is that the radar can pick up a decoy made to appear on radar like an oncoming small aircraft or other small drones, even when the camera can't see them on visual, and steer around it. \n\"I can see that drone, and I can see another aircraft,\" says Echodyne founder and CEO Eben Frankenberg. \nEchodyne CTO Tom Driscoll (left) and CEO Eben Frankenberg (right) in the radar test chamber in the company offices. Echodyne \nThis is a big deal, Frankenberg says , because it opens the door for drones to operate further away from human operators. Other startups are working on this problem , but Echodyne says theirs is the first to successfully complete real-world tests. \nRight now, the FAA requires a drone pilot essentially be within eyeshot of the vehicle they're flying, which is no good if you're Amazon and you're trying to send drones all over town. But with the ability to do automatic collision detection, a drone doesn't need a human pilot to be paying attention in order to dodge hazards. \nAn Amazon Prime Air drone. AP/Amazon \nFrankenberg says Echodyne is leaving it up to its customers how to use this so-called \"detect and avoid\" system. There are two options, either leaving it to the vehicle's artificial brain to make the call, or having it suggest a course correction to a human who can approve it. With issues of liabiltiy and safety still up in the air, Echodyne doesn't want to wade into the debate. \n\"It's still unclear what the FAA will be comfortable with, with algorithms,\" Frankenberg says. \nRight now, Echodyne is focused on drones, because that's the biggest market with the most need for this kind of always-aware radar scanner. \nThe Echodyne array is a super-small, super-powerful radar array. Echodyne \nBut eventually, he says, it could come back down to earth: Self-driving cars from the likes of Uber and Google use a combination of radar and lasers to scan the road, but they lack a certain ability to \"see\" elevation — it can see a tree that's fallen on the road, but if there's a too-low overpass or a falling hazard, Echodyne's MESA would be able to see it before the relatively weaker systems on the car and drive around. \n\"Lasers are not going to be a solution,\" Frankenberg says.

      "text": "Microsoft is looking to turn its upcoming Xbox Scorpio into a keystone in its Universal Windows Platform (UWP) system, having it play those games at up to 4K resolutions natively. This means no more console exclusives from Microsoft, as any game developed for the UWP platform will work on Windows 10 PCs, Scorpio, and the Xbox One without much difficulty.\nMicrosoft’s UWP system has been a major drive for a while now, with the idea being that it creates a single ecosystem that spans consoles, PCs, mobile and even the HoloLens augmented reality headsets. Scorpio will be a major component in that mix, as it will not only deliver monstrous power for console gaming, but also act as a developmental platform for games and experiences on other hardware, too.\nThis is because Scorpio is a clever piece of kit. As explained by Windows Central sources , Scorpio will be able to mimic an Xbox One at a hardware level, so developing games on a Scorpio will make it incredibly easy to test those titles on an Xbox One too. We’re told that this system has an internal code name: Project Helix.\nRelated: Microsoft’s Phil Spencer teases the pricing window of 2017’s Project Scorpio\nWhile great news for developers, this also means that we may finally see an end of poor quality PC ports. By bringing the Scorpio up to the (purportedly) 6 teraflops level, it is just as capable as many decent gaming systems, so games developed for either should work fine on the other. Even a couple of years down the road when PC hardware has advanced beyond it again, the fact that Scorpio is built on the UWP should mean that upgrading the visuals and frame rates for PC gamers will be much easier than before as well.\nOf course releasing games through the Windows Store hasn’t gone so well in every instance . Microsoft may need to get people over that problematic stigma before the UWP platform is completely embraced, but with the way Scorpio is being positioned, that might be easier than we’d have expected. It’s also possible that Microsoft doesn’t try and target the PC gaming space as much as it tries to augment the Xbox market with additional PC play and features.\nIf it tries to take the fight to Steam to push people to its store instead, it will need to step up its game.\nDell preps its own Surface Studio-inspired creativity workstation A wireless solution for the HTC Vive could be ready in time for Chrismas Ed Boon hints at PC release for 'Mortal Kombat XL'",

      "text": "  \nBack in July of 2016, and at the height of the Pokemon Go hype, Microsoft’s CEO Satya Nadella commented to CNBC that “Pokemon Go will hopefully boost interest in HoloLens.” While the hype has since died down, one HoloLens developer has brought Satya’s vision to life and has made a HoloLens Pokemon RPG game, blowing Pokemon Go right out of the water. \nAccording to the description in the YouTube video, the genius behind the game is Kenny W. On his Twitter page , Kenny describes himself as someone who likes “Developing games and playing with augmented reality.” Kenny’s game, nonetheless, is very impressive (developed in Unity), and as seen in the video, brings Pokemon into the real world settings in very similar fashion to Pokemon Go (minus the phone of course!) \nThe video begins with a wild Pidgey appearing on a beach, the player of the game tapping on it, and then choosing Pikachu from one of pokeballs floating on the screen. Based solely on the video, animations for the experience appear to be very responsive even when the user chooses a move for the Pokemon to use. Animations for the moves themselves also appear to be true to life, and the Pokemon react accordingly to how hard and effective the moves are. \nAs it progresses, the video even takes us into battles at several other real locations, such a park, the bushes, and a train station. Lastly, with the player’s Pokemon still by his side, the video then ends with the user throwing a Pokeball to catch a wild Pikachu. \nIf the video has got your attention, you might want to follow Kenny W on Twitter to get further updates as his project progresses. We’ll also be following along right with you, and will be here to report any new developments in the situation. In this story stream:",

      "text": "  \nMicrosoft threw its hat into the 3D ring in a big way a few weeks ago during its Fall Windows 10 Event. Aside from its Surface Studio hardware geared for touch manipulation of 3D creations , Microsoft also revamped its Paint software to now be the home of consumer-facing 3D creation. \nMicrosoft isn’t satisfied hanging its hat on its Fall announcements and is bolstering its 3D offerings with a new patent for full-color 3D printing with mixed CMYKW materials. \nThanks to 3ders.org we get summation of the patent in laymen’s terms: \nSo how does it work? In a nutshell, this patent covers various techniques for mixing CMYKW (cyan, magenta, yellow, key or black and white) 3D printable materials and expressing the design from computer software to a physical device – from CAD model to 3D printed object.” \nUnderstandably, 3D printing is a bit more complicated and requires new processes to get solid results, but it looks like Microsoft and its Windows 10 operating system is attempting to get out ahead of the potential complications to make it as assessable as possible.

In response, Slack took out a full-page ad in the New York Times to “welcome” the Redmond tech giant to the market. Meanwhile, shortly after Teams launched, Microsoft exec Ron Markezich referred to tools like Slack as “applications du jour.”\n“Little companies come and go,” Markezich said in an interview with Business Insider . Harsh!\nAs this chart from Statista shows, though, Microsoft is taking on one of the hottest startups in tech. Since its launch in August 2013, Slack's growth has been like rocketship, and now it claims four million daily active users and 1.25 million paid users.\nStill, Markezich has a point. While Slack hasn’t stopped growing, that growth has started to slow , and there are now legitimate questions over whether or not the app’s simple, relatively feature-lite UI can scale beyond smaller companies. With Teams, Microsoft thinks it can hit startups and the enterprise.\nWill it? We’ll start to find out when Teams launches in early 2017. For now, it’ll be interesting to see how Slack tries to keep the ship fueled.\n(Statista) \n\nNOW WATCH: Here's how Donald Trump can function on barely any sleep \n\nMore From Business Insider \nObama’s plan to supercharge electric vehicles has a lot of ground to cover \nWe put Siri, Alexa, Google Assistant, and Cortana through a marathon of tests to see who's winning the virtual assistant race — here's what we found \nFacebook keeps growing, and it’s all because of smartphones",

      "title": "Microsoft Surface Book or Apple MacBook Pro: Which One to Buy",
      "text": "Loading... Comparing Microsoft's New Surface Book to Apple's MacBook Pro Apple and Microsoft both announced new notebooks designed to appeal to business and consumers alike. Is the new MacBook Pro or Surface Book right for you? Let's See How the Screen Sizes Measure Up One of the first things to consider before buying a MacBook Pro or Surface Book is screen size. The MacBook Pro ships in both 13-inch and 15-inch varieties. The Surface Book with Performance Base has a 13.5-inch screen. Anyone looking for a larger screen will need to choose Apple's option. Both computers, though, feature outstanding display clarity and quality. Check Out the Processor Options On performance, Microsoft's Surface Book with Performance Base has a slight edge. The device ships with a sixth-generation Intel Core i7 processor and support for a higher-end graphics chip in the Nvidia GeForce GTX 965M. Depending on the version customers pick, the lower-end MacBook Pro models come with an Intel Core i5 chip, while bigger models have Intel Core i7 processors. On the graphics side, Apple offers up to an AMD Radeon 455. Both options top out at 16GB of RAM. The Surface Book Has a Touch Screen If a touch screen is important, the Surface Book with Performance Base is the best option. Apple has decided against a touch screen in the MacBook Pro, saying it doesn't fit well with a notebook. Microsoft, however, believes it's a must-have. Customers ultimately will determine which company is right. The MacBook Pro Has the Touch Bar While the MacBook Pro doesn't have a touch screen, it does have what Apple calls the Touch Bar. The component is a multitouch strip that sits above the keyboard and gives users access to software controls. Apple has opened the Touch Bar to third-party developers to ensure apps come with the software functions users want. Depending on its developer support, the Touch Bar could be either a gimmick or the MacBook Pro's secret weapon. Choose Between a Pure Notebook and a Hybrid PC Customers ultimately will need to decide whether a hybrid is important to them when choosing between the two computers. Apple's MacBook Pro is a standard notebook with a clamshell design. The Surface Book comes with a hinge that allows it to be used as both a notebook and a tablet. The difference is an important one that shouldn't be overlooked. The Surface Book Supports a Stylus Unlike the MacBook Pro, the Surface Book supports a stylus. Using the Microsoft Surface Pen, users can draw on the screen, sign documents and perform other creative actions. Since Apple's computer doesn't support a stylus or any touch input, for that matter, creative professionals might find a more suitable option in Microsoft's computer. Big Battery Life Could Be a Decisive Factor Apple promises 10 hours of battery life in the MacBook Pro, delivering solid mixed-use performance during the day. However, Microsoft is the clear winner here, offering up to 16 hours of battery life. While mileage may vary depending on how the computers are used, the Surface Book is the best option for anyone needing a bit more battery life to get through the day. Neither Model Is Over-Equipped With Ports Neither the MacBook Pro nor the Surface Book with Performance Base is a real winner when it comes to port support. Apple's MacBook Pro comes with four Thunderbolt 3 ports and a headphone jack. The Surface Book ships with two USB 3.0 ports, an SD Card reader, a headphone jack and a Mini DisplayPort. Which computer wins depends on the accessories owners want to plug into their machine. Software Compatibility Considerations The Surface Book runs Windows 10 Pro, which is compatible with numerous applications of every description for consumers and business users. It also includes some important security enhancements. The MacBook Pro runs on macOS Sierra, which also works with a huge stock of existing applications. While Apple has done a fine job of adding more support for third-party applications, Windows is still the platform most developers design their apps for first. It All Comes Back to Pricing Inevitably, some customers will choose their computer based on price. However, neither option is cheap. The Surface Book with Performance Base starts at $2,399 and goes up to $3,299 for the highest-end option. Apple's Touch Bar-equipped MacBook Pro starts at $1,799 for the 13-inch model and tops out at $2,799 for the highest-end version. Customizations to the machine will push the price higher.",

      "title": "Microsoft Word Intruder 8 Adds Support for Flash Vulnerability CVE-2016-4117",
      "text": "Proofpoint Staff \nAnalysis \nMicrosoft Word Intruder (MWI) is a kit designed for building malicious Microsoft Word documents for use in targeted attacks. The most recent iteration of MWI - Version 8 - supports a wide variety of vulnerabilities that actors can exploit via crafted Microsoft Word documents. Available on underground markets since 2013, we first identified MWI in March 2015 [1]. FireEye [2] and Sophos [3] provided additional documentation of the kit later that year. \nIn the mid-July 2016, an advertisement for MWI on an underground site stated that this exploit document builder integrated CVE-2016-4117 (Adobe Flash Player up to 21.0.0.213). At the end of August, MWI incremented to version 8, with the message “MICROSOFT WORD INTRUDER 8 (MWI8): CVE-2016-4117 + CVE-2015-2545 + CVE-2015-1641 + CVE-2012-0158” in an advertisement for the new version (see Appendix). \nWe were able to observe this updated version in the wild dropping various payloads; for example, we saw it dropping RTM Banker on October 21. In this case, the document “business project laveco price.doc.rtf” was delivered via email and targeted at retail, financial, and manufacturing verticals. \nFigure 1: Network traffic for MWI and its RTM Banker payload network traffic on October 21 \nNote that we observed the same instance of RTM fed by Empire Pack (RIG variant [2]) in multiple infection vectors (both compromised sites and malvertising) in multiple countries (the Netherlands, Norway, Germany, Spain, Switzerland, Sweden, Austria, and Ireland). \nAnother observed MWI document “Изменения условий взаимодействия.doc” (translated from Russian as “Changes of conditions of cooperation.doc”) dropped a TeamViewer-based RAT on September 7. \nFigure 2: MWI document installing a TeamViewer-based RAT and reporting to C&C \nThe Adobe Flash Player zero-day CVE-2016-4117 zero-day was discovered by FireEye [6], and was first used by an APT actor named “ScarCruft”, as described by Kaspersky [7]. The exploit was later integrated into multiple exploits kits [8]. \nWhen we examined the MWI CVE-2016-4117 addition, it appears that this exploit document builder reused the original exploit code without modifying anything except the shellcode. The first Flash file decrypts a second Flash file, which triggers the vulnerability. In fact, the MWI author maintained the same decryption routine and the XOR key for this second file. \nFigure 3: Original sample on the left, MWI exploit integration on the right \nThis second Flash file appears to be the exact same file from the original exploit, without any modification by the MWI author. \nFigure 4: ActiveScript code triggering the vulnerability \nConclusion \nMicrosoft Word Intruder is an example of the sort of sophisticated crimeware used to develop attacks on a variety of targets. By incorporating new vulnerabilities in vectors such as Adobe Flash, MWI users increase the likelihood that their malicious documents will successfully infect target devices. This particular vulnerability has also been incorporated in a number of web-based exploit kits, making it imperative that users and organizations who choose to maintain Flash on their systems update to the latest versions. \nReferences",

      "title": "Microsoft's Cortana could get chattier and more personal soon",
      "text": "By James Walker 43 mins ago in Technology Microsoft's Cortana could become a lot more personal soon. Microsoft recently applied for a patent that describes a \"personalized greeting system\" capable of emulating human interactions and delivering contextually relevant welcome messages. Cortana currently greets users with a range of friendly but generic messages including \"What's up?\", \"Greetings!\" and \"Anything I can get started?\" The phrases are displayed randomly each time Cortana's interface is opened. Microsoft may be working on something more advanced though. As discovered by MSPoweruser , the company has considered technology that takes into account your interests to develop unique greetings. Cortana would feel a little more human if the system gets developed. Current digital assistants are limited by their canned and scripted responses to queries. This is particularly evident in the initial greeting messages. After you've been using Cortana for a while, you'll have seen all the possible greetings and any semblance of being personal or human is lost. Microsoft's proposed solution would consider your interests to create a greeting based on things Cortana already knows about you. The app would then intelligently rank the different messages based on how interested you are in the subject. If Cortana determined a user is more interested in sports than the weather, the app could generate a greeting based on the latest match results. For a different user, it may be the weather that’s ranked higher. Each greeting would only be displayed once after generation. This solves another problem of current assistants. It's not uncommon for the same message to be used multiple times throughout the day. This is particularly evident on special occasions, such as birthdays. Cortana will say \"Happy Birthday!\" to the user but will continue to do so throughout the day, unlike a real person would. Microsoft proposes the system could keep track of the greetings it's used. The second time that Cortana is launched on your birthday, the app would know not to say \"Happy Birthday!\" again. Instead, the assistant would continue the context, opting for a more natural \"Hope you are having a wonderful day!\" It follows human speech conventions and makes for a more convincing digital assistant. Microsoft suggests data including emails, user searches and calendar entries could be used to power the greetings system. This may raise some privacy concerns amongst users, especially as Windows 10 already has a poor reputation for transparency in this regard. Since Cortana can already access these data sources, existing users shouldn't be affected though. The patent was filed on April 28th 2016. Microsoft may not be actively developing the technology, although it does seem to align with its long-term goals for Cortana and artificial intelligence. The company has been adding new features to the assistant since it became available on desktop PCs with last year's launch of Windows 10.",

All three, namely KB3198586, KB3198585, and KB3200970, can be downloaded right away via Windows Update, but users should keep in mind that these updates require a system reboot, so work needs to be saved before anything else. Since they arrive on Patch Tuesday, these cumulative updates including security fixes as well, and Microsoft recommends everyone to install them as soon as possible. There are also some other improvements and reliability enhancements for both the operating system and the pre-installed apps, such as Microsoft Edge browser. What’s also important to note is that cumulative updates bring your computer fully up-to-date when you install the latest one, so in case you skipped a previous version because of various reasons, installing the ones that Microsoft shipped today will have you covered. No failed installs just yet For the moment, we can’t tell for sure if these cumulative updates install fine or not, but we’ve already tried them on several computers here at Softpedia and everything worked smoothly. As always, however, it remains to be seen if all users can install them flawlessly, as it all depends on apps that are running on a machine, as well as the configuration, to have an update install successfully. Cumulative updates don’t have a good history when it comes to performance on Windows 10 devices and there are plenty of users out there whose systems were actually affected by them, but Microsoft is showing increasing interest in fixing these issues and preventing them in future releases. Just like before, Microsoft is asking users to send feedback should anything go wrong with these cumulative updates, so if you come across a bug that prevents them from installing, or maybe something that impacts your system, make sure you report to the company. We’ll also keep an eye out for reports pointing to botched cumulative updates and will update the article should we find any.",

Credit: Microsoft \nFeature Pack 1, which officials said in September would be available this month , includes new features for administrators and end-user customers, both. Read this Read More \nOn the administrator side, Feature Pack 1 adds more granular administrative-action logging and new MinRole capabilities aimed at smaller user environments. \nEnd users get access to an updated OneDrive for Business interface; custom tilese in the SharePoint app launcher; a preview of SharePoint hybrid auditing and hybrid taxonomy; and OneDrive API for SharePoint on-premises. \nFeature Pack 1 is free to SharePoint users, though some of the features -- like the new OneDrive for Business support -- are for Software Assurance customers only. \nMicrosoft made SharePoint 2016 available to MSDN and volume licensees starting in May. At that time, officials said they planned to make at least one feature pack with new updates for SharePoint available in 2017 . (So I guess this means the team was ahead of schedule.) \nCompany officials have said that SharePoint Server 2016 won't be the last on-premises release of SharePoint. In between the two to three years likely between full-blown releases, the company is expected to update the on-premises version with Feature Packs. Join Discussion",

      "text": "\nThe new Surface Studio , Surface Book and Surface Pro were just released to some fanfare, but the unsung hero of the Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) event was probably the Surface Dial.\nAs an accessory, it didn’t get a lot of attention, that is until everyone became aware of its capabilities. And now, the Dial is being labeled as a revolutionary tool for the creative process by allowing users to transition seamlessly between tasks.\nWhat’s the Big Deal About the Microsoft Surface Dial? This is a truly innovative way to interact with digital technology. Dial lets you easily access shortcuts to improve your workflow. Whether you are writing, drawing, editing video, watching your favorite movie or listening to music, you can manipulate these and other applications with a click and turn.\nThe Dial looks like a paperweight, but place it on the Surface Studio monitor, and it becomes much more than that.\n\nDesigned to simplify the actions of applications, you can undo each line, change color or brush size, adjust different parameters, rotate 3D vectors and more. And the haptic feedback adds another dimension of interaction with vibrations that let you experience and interact with your project in a new way.\nThe Dial has a maximum diameter of 2.32″, and it only weighs in at 145 g with 2 batteries that last for 12 months. Using Bluetooth Low Energy, it connects to any of the Surface PCs, but only the Studio has on-screen detection through a capacitive pattern.\nWhen you use it with the Pen, the combination of the two accessories adds yet another layer of creativity and productivity. You can choose colors, themes, controls and other options so you can create with more flexibility than ever.\n\nAt $99 ( for pre-order ), the Surface Dial may be another accessory out there for creatives who want to explore the full potential of their Surface computers.\nImages Microsoft \nThis article, \" Surface Dial May Be Unsung Hero of Recent Microsoft Release \" was first published on Small Business Trends \n",

      "title": "Microsoft's new Xbox Insider Program is open to all players",
      "text": "By James Walker 21 mins ago in Technology Microsoft has rebranded its Xbox Preview Program as the Xbox Insider Program. It brings it in line with the Windows and Office Insider Programs. For the first time, any Xbox gamer will be able to join up and get access to pre-release software. Microsoft's Xbox Preview Program has been running since February 2014. It lets involved Xbox users contribute feature requests, bug reports and general feedback to the teams behind the platform. In return, members get access to early builds of new software updates, before the general public. Before Windows 10 launched, Microsoft unveiled the Windows Insider Program. It allows anyone to download development versions of Windows 10 to help the company test new updates before they're publicly released. Microsoft also has an Office Insider Program. Yesterday, it announced Xbox will be rebranding to be a part of the \"insiders\" family. Microsoft said it is making the change because it reflects the expansion of the preview program. The Xbox Insider Program will enable gamers to participate in opt-in opportunities to submit feedback on preview versions of Xbox software. This will include Microsoft-provided system updates as well as third-party apps and games. The original Preview Program was limited to the core Xbox software. To accompany the new focus, Microsoft has rebuilt the Xbox Preview Dashboard. It's now known as the Xbox Insider Hub, aligning with Microsoft's branding across its platforms. The company has developed a new UI that fits with the styling of the New Xbox One Experience . The app is personalised with announcements, quests and Insider opportunities applicable to each individual user. There's also the ability for multiple console users to submit feedback from one device. The changes are available from today to \"a small number\" of existing preview members who have been the most active since the program's inception. The remaining Xbox Preview users will be converted to \"Insider\" status over the coming weeks. Once the rollout is complete, Microsoft will expand the Insider Program to all Xbox gamers. For the first time in its history, any Xbox user will be able to provide feedback and suggest features from the console's interface. \"Whether you're an Xbox Insider who enjoys previewing the latest Xbox One system updates, or an Insider who loves checking out the beta of the latest installment in your favorite franchise, you'll now get to choose how to participate,\" said Microsoft . \"We hope you enjoy the new experience.\" Shortly after it unveiled the Xbox Insiders Program, Microsoft quietly announced that Skype now also has an Insiders Program. Users of the chat app who sign up as an Insider will be able to receive pre-release builds of Skype software, access new features early into their development and more easily submit feedback and bug reports. Microsoft appears to be giving all its most significant software an Insider Program, letting its most devoted users help it improve its products.",

      "text": "Things are heating up in the world of workplace chat. \nLast week, Microsoft took the lid off of Teams , a new chatting app aimed squarely at Slack and Atlassian HipChat. In response, Slack took out a full-page ad in the New York Times to “welcome” the Redmond tech giant to the market. Meanwhile, shortly after Teams launched, Microsoft exec Ron Markezich referred to tools like Slack as “applications du jour.” \n“Little companies come and go,” Markezich said in an interview with Business Insider . Harsh! \nAs this chart from Statista shows, though, Microsoft is taking on one of the hottest startups in tech. Since its launch in August 2013, Slack's growth has been like rocketship, and now it claims four million daily active users and 1.25 million paid users. \nStill, Markezich has a point. While Slack hasn’t stopped growing, that growth has started to slow , and there are now legitimate questions over whether or not the app’s simple, relatively feature-lite UI can scale beyond smaller companies. With Teams, Microsoft thinks it can hit startups and the enterprise. \nWill it? We’ll start to find out when Teams launches in early 2017. For now, it’ll be interesting to see how Slack tries to keep the ship fueled. \nStatista",

      "text": "By Rich Woods Neowin LLC @@TheRichWoods · 4 seconds ago with 0 comments \nToday is the second Tuesday of the month, meaning that it's time for a new round of cumulative updates for Windows 10. If you're on the Anniversary Update, you'll see build 14393.447 on your PC; sadly, there is no update for Windows 10 Mobile just yet. \nMicrosoft promised today's update a week ago, when the company responded to Google's reporting of a security vulnerability in Windows 10 . The fix should be included in all updates released today, including for Windows Vista, 7, and 8.1. \nHere's what's new in build 14393.447: \nImproved the reliability of multimedia audio, Remote Desktop, and Internet Explorer 11.​ \nAddressed issue that prevents users from connecting to a virtual private network (VPN). \nAddressed issue with a scheduled task that doesn’t run in Task Scheduler after reenabling. \nAddressed issue to update the Access Point Name (APN) database. \nAddressed issue with Japanese characters that are missing when converted by the Input Method Editor. \nAddressed issue with the system tray showing no Wi-Fi connection even when Wi-Fi is present. \nAddressed issue with Windows devices that disconnect from the Internet prematurely before users can complete their paid Wi-Fi purchase. \nAddressed issue to update the new Belarusian ruble symbol to Br and the new ISO 4217 code to BYN. \nAddressed additional issues with multimedia, Windows kernel, packaging release management, authentication, Microsoft Edge, Internet Explorer 11, Remote Desktop, Active Directory, wireless networking, Windows shell, graphics, enterprise security, and Microsoft HoloLens. \nSecurity updates to Boot Manager, Windows operating system, kernel-mode drivers, Microsoft Edge, Internet Explorer 11, Microsoft Virtual Hard Drive, Common Log File System driver, Microsoft Video Control, Common Log File System driver, Windows authentication methods, Windows File Manager, and the Microsoft Graphics Component. \nIf you're on version 1511, also known as the November Update, you'll be receiving an update as well. Here's what's new in build 10586.679: \nImproved the reliability of the Windows shell, Microsoft Edge, and Internet Explorer 11. \nAddressed issue with Japanese characters that are missing when converted by the Input Method Editor. \nAddressed issue with systems that randomly stop applying UNC Hardening group policy, leaving systems vulnerable until restarted. \nAddressed issue with proxy authentication that causes Windows Update downloads to fail. \nAddressed issue that prevents users from accessing network resources after logon after they’ve installed KB3185614. \nAddressed issue with point rendering in Internet Explorer 11 and Microsoft Edge. \nAddressed issue where users can’t navigate to Internet sites when a network is configured to use Web Proxy Auto Discovery (WPAD). \nAddressed issue where users can’t access Microsoft Store in an authenticated proxy environment. \nAddressed additional issues with enterprise security, Internet Explorer 11, Remote Desktop, datacenter networking, Windows shell, filter driver, the Access Point Name (APN) database, and wireless networking. \nSecurity updates to the Windows operating system, kernel-mode drivers, Microsoft Edge, Boot Manager, Internet Explorer 11, Common Log File System driver, Microsoft Virtual Hard Drive, Microsoft Video Control, Windows authentication methods, Windows File Manager, OpenType, and the Microsoft Graphics Component. \nFinally, those on the original version of Windows 10 - which is now known as version 1507 - are being offered a cumulative update too. Here's what's new in build 10240.17190: \nAddressed issue to update the Access Point Name (APN) database. \nAddressed issue with deadlocks occurring after a user password reset. \nAddressed issue with point rendering in Internet Explorer 11 and Microsoft Edge. \nAddressed issue with Japanese characters that are missing when converted by the Input Method Editor. \nAddressed additional issues with filter drivers, enterprise security, Windows shell, and Internet Explorer 1. \nSecurity updates to the Windows OS, Microsoft Edge, Internet Explorer 11, Windows File Manager, Microsoft Graphics Component, Windows authentication methods, kernel-mode drivers, Microsoft Virtual Hard Drive, Microsoft Video Control, OpenType, and the Common Log File System driver. \nAs far as Windows 10 Mobile updates go, the Production ring (non-Insiders) is still on version 14393.321, which was offered on the last Patch Tuesday . Insiders on the Release Preview and Slow rings are on 14393.351, and that was released on October 20 . Tags",

      "text": "0 comment(s) \nMicrosoft today released 13 bulletins (plus one bulletin from Adobe for Flash). 5 of the Microsoft bulletins, and the Adobe Flash bulletin are rated critical. There are a number of vulnerabilities that have either already been known, or have already been exploited: \nMS16-129 and MS16-142 (Internet Explorer): An information disclosure ( CVE 2016-7199%%) has already been publicly disclosed, but not been exploited yet. The vulnerability can leak information cross-origin. In addition there is a spoofing vulnerability that only affects Microsoft Edge that has been publicly disclosed (%%cve:2016-7209 ). \nMS16-132 (Microsoft Graphics Component): This is yet another open type font issue ( CVE 2016-7256 ). IT has already been exploited and I labeled this bulletin as \"Patch Now\" . The vulnerability can be used for remote code execution. \nFull details: https://isc.sans.edu/mspatchdays.html?viewday=2016-11-08 \nNote that Microsoft didn't use the first two bulletins for the usual Internet Explorer and Edge cumulative updates. Instead, the first bulletin (MS16-129) is used for Edge, and the last one (MS16-142) is used for Internet Explorer. The Flash update uses the next to last bulletin (MS16-141).",

      "text": "  fixes Windows security flaw under attack by hackers The software giant said Russian hackers were behind a low-volume spearphishing campaign, which exploits a previously undisclosed security flaw in the operating system. \n(Image: file photo) \nMicrosoft has fixed a security flaw in Windows that was being actively exploited by hackers. \nThe software and services giant released the patch as part of its monthly round of security patches, known as Patch Tuesday . \nIn a security bulletin , the company said that the \"important\"-rated patch will fix multiple elevation of privilege vulnerabilities, which can be exploited because of how the Windows kernel-mode driver improperly handles objects in memory. \nAn attacker would have to trick the user into opening a specially-crafted application while the user was logged into the computer. \nIf exploited, that attacker would be able to run programs, delete data, and create new accounts with full user rights and \"take control of an affected system,\" said the bulletin. \nDetails of the security vulnerable were first revealed on Monday by Google. \nThe search giant disclosed the flaw outside of its usual three-month private disclosure period, citing evidence that hackers were exploiting the flaw. \nMicrosoft confirmed the vulnerability in its own blog post . \nWindows president Terry Myerson said that Russian hackers, known as Strontium carried out the low-volume spearphishing attack, designed to attack a particular target or organization. \nBut Myerson, angered by Google's decision to publicly disclose the flaw, said that Google put Windows users \"at potential risk\" as a result of the premature disclosure. \nMyerson said that Windows 10 users running the latest Anniversary Update were not affected by the flaw. \nMicrosoft nevertheless acknowledged two Google researchers for finding the flaw. \nThe company also fixed six critical flaws -- including one that affects all versions of Windows , along with eight other important updates, including cumulative updates for Internet Explorer and its Edge browser. \nNovember's patches will be available through the usual update channels.

      "text": "Microsoft Patches Windows Zero-Day Exploited by Russian Hackers By Eduard Kovacs on November 08, 2016 Tweet \nThe 14 security bulletins released on Tuesday by Microsoft address many serious issues, including a couple of Windows vulnerabilities actively exploited by malicious actors and bugs for which exploits are already publicly available. \nOne of the zero-days has been patched with MS16-135, a bulletin rated important. MS16-135 fixes two information disclosure and three privilege escalation flaws, one of which is a Windows kernel bug exploited in attacks by a Russia-linked cyber espionage group to elevate privileges and escape the browser sandbox. \nThe zero-day, tracked as CVE-2016-7255, was reported to Microsoft by Google researchers on October 21 and it was disclosed by the search giant ten days later. Google typically gives vendors a few months to patch vulnerabilities, but the deadline is only 7 days for flaws exploited in the wild. \nWhile Google decided that it would be in the best interest of users to disclose the vulnerability, Microsoft disagreed and criticized the company for putting its customers at risk. Microsoft said the vulnerability had been exploited in a low-volume spear-phishing campaign by the threat group known as Pawn Storm, APT28, Fancy Bear, Sednit, Sofacy and Tsar Team. \nThe vulnerability affects Windows Vista through Windows 10 Anniversary Update, but new mitigations prevent exploitation against the latter. The same attacks also leverage a Flash Player vulnerability that Adobe patched on October 26. \nThis is not the only zero-day vulnerability patched by Microsoft on Tuesday. The critical security bulletin MS16-132 addresses several issues related to the Windows Media Foundation, the Windows Animation Manager and OpenType fonts, including a remote code execution vulnerability (CVE-2016-7256) caused due to the way the Windows font library handles specially crafted embedded fonts. \nThe vulnerability has been exploited in the wild, but Microsoft has not shared any details on these attacks. The company said the flaw can be exploited via specially crafted websites or documents that victims must open in order to trigger the exploit. \nMicrosoft also patched a couple of vulnerabilities that have not been exploited in the wild, but for which exploits are publicly available. This includes a browser information disclosure vulnerability (CVE-2016-7199) and an Edge spoofing flaw (CVE-2016-7209) – both fixed with MS16-129. \nOther critical security bulletins resolve various Windows vulnerabilities, including issues affecting Video Control, the Input Method Editor (IME) and the Task Scheduler. Important bulletins fix security holes in the Windows Virtual Hard Disk Driver, SQL Server, Windows authentication methods, the Windows kernel, Secure Boot, the Windows Common Log File System (CLFS) driver, and Office. \nAdobe also released security updates this Patch Tuesday. The company addressed one vulnerability in Connect for Windows and nine arbitrary code execution flaws in Flash Player. The Flash Player issues have also been patched in Internet Explorer and Edge with the MS16-141 critical bulletin.",
