      "text": "Microsoft has today announced that they are temporarily halting Windows 10 PC Insider Preview build availability as they begin to switch their updating systems over from the old delivery method to the new Unified Update Platform. \n\nWhat does this mean, exactly? Well if you're an Insider and you're not running the latest Insider Preview build, you're now going to have to wait a few more days before you can download it as Microsoft is no longer offering builds on the fast and slow ring.\nFrom the Microsoft blog post: \nUPDATE 12/2: We are getting ready to start releasing PC builds to Insiders using UUP. To prepare for this, we are going to pause all PC builds for both the Fast and Slow rings starting this evening (Friday 12/2). We will begin flighting the latest builds via UUP starting with our internal rings first then to Insiders based on each ring's promotion criteria. We're excited to be able to release builds for PC to Insiders using UUP! Mobile builds are not impacted by this.\nIt's unclear how long this pause in build availability will be, but considering Microsoft wants to test out their own method internally first, it could be a few days at the very least. Stick to Windows Central for more news regarding the Insider Preview.\n",

Due to this restriction, Windows developers were not using symlinks and many modern cross-platform development tools works less efficiently and reliably on Windows. Microsoft is fixing this issue with Windows 10 Creators Update. Starting with Windows 10 Insiders build 14972, symlinks can be created without needing to elevate the console as administrator.\nMicrosoft highlighted the following reasons for including symlinks support in Windows 10,\nModern development projects are increasingly portable across operating systems Modern development tools are symlink-aware, and many are optimized for symlinks Windows developers should enjoy a development environment that is at least the equal of others Learn how to create symlinks here .",

      "text": "0 Panos Panay, Corporate Vice President for Surface Computing holds the new Microsoft Surface Book i7 laptop at a live event in the Manhattan borough of New York City, October 26, 2016. Reuters/Lucas Jackson \nRecent reports suggest that that the Microsoft Surface Pro 5 will have a gigantic 512GB internal storage. This is incredible for a portable device that is not a laptop. Microsoft has never cut back on performance when it comes to its device as the Surface Pro 4 is a prime example. It’s an amazing piece of technology that comes in a light and small package. \nThe heavily useful tablet, Surface Pro 4, has 16GB internal storage and can host an Intel i7 processor. Now, as per reports, Microsoft is looking to better its successor, the Surface Pro 5. Such a massive storage will most definitely attract a lot of buyers. But that’s not it. The Microsoft Surface Pro 5 will also have a much better battery performance. \nThe Surface Pen is also reportedly getting a big upgrade and instead of a replaceable battery, the device will be able to charge wirelessly via a magnetic dock. The Microsoft Surface Pro 5 could be getting the USB 3.0 protocol along with the Thunderbolt 3 interface. Microsoft is in talks to add the USB Type-C ports to the upcoming device. \nEven though the Surface Pro 5 is unlikely to receive PixelSense Display upgrades, many believe a 4K resolution upgrade may be brought about by Kaby Lake native 4K video support. Instead, Microsoft may provide fingerprint scanning through the PixelSense Display, writes The Bitbag . \nBelieved to be released in Spring 2017, the Microsoft Surface Pro 5 may sport the much-awaited Intel Kaby Lake processor and run on Windows 10 Redstone 3 from Microsoft. The Surface Pro 5 will come with a hefty price tag. The Surface Pro 4 basic model sold for US$899 (AU$1,210). This price went up to US$2,000 (AU$2,700), depending on the configuration. \nStay tuned on IBT AU for more updates on Microsoft Surface Pro 5.",

      "text": "Microsoft Wins Proxy Access Vote (MSFT) By Richard Saintvilus | December 2, 2016 — 10:39 AM EST \nShares of Microsoft Corporation ( MSFT ) declined as much as 2.19% Thursday, reaching a session low of $58.94 on a Wall Street Journal report that shareholders voted down a proposal to alter how the company selects its directors. \nInvestor advocate James McRitchie was pushing to make it easier for investors to nominate members to Microsoft's board . But the proposal, which garnered only 26% of votes, failed at the company's annual meeting . \"That's worse than I thought,\" said McRitchie in reference to the 26% vote, according to the Journal. (See also: Microsoft Declares 39-Cent Cash Dividend .) \nChanging how the company selected its directors was one of several items McRitchie's proposal called for. He was also pushing for Microsoft to eliminate the so-called shareholder aggregation cap, which states that, in order to nominate directors on company proxy filings, it requires a maximum of 20 shareholders who can combine their investments to reach the required minimum 3% holdings. \nGiven the challenge it poses to reach the 3% threshold with a small number of shareholders, McRitchie wanted Microsoft to increase the maximum number of investors who can team up. Stephen Giove, a partner at Shearman & Sterling LLP, explained that McRitchie's efforts are one example of investors prodding large companies and aiming to create a precedent for the wider corporate universe. (See also: How to Become a Corporate Board Member .) \n\"The investors are going after companies who are leaders,\" Giove said, according to the Journal. \"If they get them to turn, they may get others to turn.\" Giove estimated that some 45% of S&P 500 companies have adopted proxy access in recent years, reported the Journal. \nMcRitchie is not giving up, however. Despite this defeat, McRitchie promises to return with another amendment at Microsoft's annual vote next year. \nMicrosoft shares closed Thursday at $59.19, down 1.77%. The shares have risen 6.71% year to date, compared with a 7.20% rise in the S&P 500 ( SPX ) index. (See also: Microsoft Stock Upgraded at Goldman Sachs .)

It was a horrendous disaster that saw PC players consistently stomp all over console players due to the increased precision of a mouse over a controller, but the company thinks it could be different with Gears of War 4, and so it's trying again. \nStarting now through Monday, December 5, you can access a public Versus playlist with specific settings -- Social / TDM / Dodgeball / KOTH / All maps / Squad size 5 -- that allows you to frag it up with your gaming cousins. \nMicrosoft assures this is very much a test to see whether or not crossplay should be a permanent feature for the game. If the data says it's not, they'll abandon it. Either way, the company encourages as many people as possible to try it and help them find out.",

It premiered last night at the Game Awards and it brought the holiday feels.\nHowever, protagonist Frank West celebrates a little differently. The trailer shows a mix of gameplay and narration from West himself, check out the trailer down below.\n\nDead Rising 4 brings players back to the mall that started the franchise, William Parkview Mall. Players will once again take the role of Frank West as they experience the post-apocalyptic world 16 years later. The latest Dead Rising game acts as a soft reboot of the franchise, giving Capcom more creative freedom to push the series forward.\nThe game is a time exclusive for Microsoft, so PlayStation users might have to wait awhile before they get their hands on the game.\nDead Rising 4 is releasing on Dec. 6 for Xbox One and Windows PC.\nThe post Dead Rising 4’s Launch Trailer Bring the Holiday Feels appeared first on Gameranx .\n",

      "text": "New Technology Will Increase On-Shelf Availability and Generate Shopper Insights\nAnnapolis, MD (PRWEB) December 02, 2016\nPowershelf® and Hitachi Consulting are working with Microsoft to introduce smart shelves to US retail stores. The new Powershelf smart shelf units will be installed in 15 supermarkets of a leading Midwest supermarket chain. KING’S HAWAIIAN®, America’s leading provider of Hawaiian food, will be the first to use the new smart shelves to reduce out-of-stock incidents and ensure shoppers can find its products while shopping this holiday season. By dramatically reducing the amount of time KING’S HAWAIIAN shelves are empty, the company is making customers’ shopping experiences a little less frustrating and also limiting the revenue that can potentially be lost when shelves are empty.\nThe units consist of a series of shelves that hold and display products. Built-in Powershelf technology tracks product availability; when a shelf is empty, a restocking alert is automatically sent to store personnel. The solution utilizes Microsoft Azure and Microsoft Power BI to analyze when, where, and why products sell so fast, allowing retailers and consumer product companies to identify trends and avoid out of stocks before they ever happen.\nJohn Linehan, Executive Vice President of Strategy and Business Development at KING’S HAWAIIAN, was impressed with early pilot results and believes the technology will lead to better customer satisfaction and improved sales performance. “Improving out of stocks is an important strategy for KING’S HAWAIIAN, and Powershelf will give us the data to manage this metric most effectively,” said Linehan. “We look forward to expanding this technology to as many of our retailers as soon as it is practical.”\nKING’S HAWAIIAN and its respective retailers and distributors will be able to access data gathered by the units—including historical out-of-stock incidents and loss of potential sales—in real-time through the Internet of Things (IoT) with a customized digital dashboard co-developed by Microsoft and Hitachi Consulting.\n“We have spent years working with our partners to develop this IoT solution that helps to solve out of stocks, and I am excited to see it introduced in time for this holiday shopping season,” said Larry McWilliams Co-CEO of Powershelf. “By making more products available we are providing shoppers with a more positive shopping experience, while reducing the cost of restocking. This is a powerful first step into the future of retail.”\nBrendan O'Meara, Managing Director of Worldwide Retail at Microsoft, explained why the data gathered by these units is so valuable. “Our collaboration with Powershelf enables us to leverage the Microsoft Cloud to combine a retailer’s inventory data with the data Powershelf sensors gather from the store floor and visualize it using Power BI tools,” said O’Meara. “Decision makers can use their custom dashboard to see the state of their stores and supply chains in real-time and react much faster than in the past.”\nAbout Powershelf\nPowershelf is a leading provider of retail technology solutions. The patented technology—the Powershelf system—provides constant power and two-way communications to software-enabled applications and devices that deliver a variety of advertising, merchandising and pricing services to customers. Powershelf is designed to address the critical, ongoing challenges faced by retailers and CPG manufacturers around the world.

      "text": "Igor Bonifacic \nDecember 2, 2016 11:02am \nIf you missed Microsoft’s Black Friday deals , the company plans to hold one more sales event before the end of the year. \nStarting on Monday, December 5th, microsoftstore.ca is hosting a 12 Days of Deals event. As the name implies, each day starting at 12am ET, the company will post a new deal, discounting a different item or set of items found on its online store. Each deal will be available for 24 hours or until supplies last. \nAll orders include free shipping and returns, and starting on December 16th, Microsoft will even throw in free expedited shipping. For those that prefer to do their shopping in person, local Microsoft Stores will — with one exception, the December 13th Oculus deal — have the same promotions. Retail stores will also have special door crasher promotions each day. \nNotable deals include 50 percent off select Xbox One titles, including Battlefield 1 and Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare, on December 7th and $100 promo code, extended warranty and sleeve with purchase of select Surface Book models on December 8th. On the final day of the sale, consumers can get a free Type Cover (valued at $170) and sleeve when they buy a Surface Pro 4 two-in-one. \nSee the full list of deals in the source link below.",

      "text": "Microsoft Suspends Windows 10 Builds to Prepare New Windows Update System GO New PC builds no longer available in Fast and Slow rings Dec 3, 2016 06:52 GMT · By Bogdan Popa · Share: ​Microsoft has temporarily suspended the delivery of new Windows 10 builds to insiders enrolled in the Fast and Slow rings, as the Windows team is internally working on the new Unified Update Platform that the company announced earlier this year. Dona Sarkar, head of the Windows Insider program, said they are planning to internally test the new UUP system internally before shipping it to users who are part of the Insider program, so it’s not clear how long this is going to take. What’s important to know is that users can no longer download new builds in the Fast and Slow rings for PCs. Mobile users are not affected. “We are getting ready to start releasing PC builds to Insiders using UUP. To prepare for this, we are going to pause all PC builds for both the Fast and Slow rings starting this evening (Friday 12/2). We will begin flighting the latest builds via UUP starting with our internal rings first then to Insiders based on each ring’s promotion criteria. We’re excited to be able to release builds for PC to Insiders using UUP! Mobile builds are not impacted by this,” Dona explained. What’s UUP? For those who missed Microsoft’s original announcement on the Unified Update Platform, this is a new updating system that speeds up update checks and dramatically cuts the size of updates by only downloading the bits that you need, and not full new builds. The delivery of large OS updates would thus be significantly faster, Microsoft says, as your computer would have to get only the files that have changed since the previous version, and not a complete image of the OS. Furthermore, the update checking would be performed server-side, so it would be faster. “Because more processing is being done by the service, this will lead to faster checks for update operations. It’s important to note that with UUP, nothing will look or behave differently on the surface, UUP is all underlying platform and service optimization that happens behind the scenes,” Microsoft says. The UUP system would be tested with help from insiders in the coming months, while everyone else would get it with the Creators Update in early 2017.",

      "text": "Sat Dec 03, 2016 10:21 Lenovo: If You Value Your Server, Block Microsoft's November Security Update Tweet TEHRAN (FNA)- Lenovo server admins should disable Windows Update and apply a UEFI fix to avoid Microsoft’s November security patches freezing their systems. The world’s third-largest server-maker advised the step after revealing that 19 configurations of its x M5 and M6 rack, as well as its x6 systems are susceptible. Lenovo’s machines are crashing upon installation of Microsoft's Security Update MS16-140 for Windows Server 2016, 2012 R2 and 2012, we're told. The server manufacturer warns here : \"Do not install the Microsoft Windows Server 2016, 2012 R2 or 2012 November update before applying fixed UEFI firmware as specified in the 'Solution' section. Replacing the system board will not fix the issue.\" Lenovo has advised sysadmins to head off Microsoft's November update at the pass by turning off Windows Update. Then they should download and apply new UEFI firmware for their system on Lenovo’s list. Only then is it safe to apply Microsoft's security update, Lenovo said. The root of the problem appears to be a clash with Microsoft's software and the systems' UEFI firmware, which is used for Secure Boot. Lenovo's systems running Windows Server 2012 and 2012 R2 configured to run with secure boot are exposed to the boot-up problem. Its systems running Windows Server 2016 are exposed regardless of the secure boot configuration. The Reg asked Lenovo to identify the cause of the bug or confirm if planned to update the UEFI on future systems. It did not respond at time of writing. Microsoft would not detail the exact technical cause of the problem or say whether it planned changes to November's security update to prevent a re-occurrence of this problem. In a statement, a Microsoft spokesperson told The Reg: \"Lenovo released a firmware update to address this, and we recommend customers contact Lenovo for more information.”",

      "text": "​Microsoft has temporarily suspended the delivery of new Windows 10 builds to insiders enrolled in the Fast and Slow rings, as the Windows team is internally working on the new Unified Update Platform that the company announced earlier this year. Dona Sarkar, head of the Windows Insider program, said they are planning to internally test the new UUP system internally before shipping it to users who are part of the Insider program, so it’s not clear how long this is going to take. What’s important to know is that users can no longer download new builds in the Fast and Slow rings for PCs. Mobile users are not affected. “We are getting ready to start releasing PC builds to Insiders using UUP. To prepare for this, we are going to pause all PC builds for both the Fast and Slow rings starting this evening (Friday 12/2). We will begin flighti...",

The 3D Builder app also works with Kinect, allowing you to scan in items directly within the app.\nDownload 3D Builder \n",

      "title": "Microsoft to use AI to automatically describe images for the blind",
      "text": "Microsoft to use AI to automatically describe images for the blind December 3, 2016 - 12:35   Microsoft on Friday, December 2 said that, starting in early 2017, its Word and PowerPoint applications will be able to automatically come up with descriptions of photos that users add into documents. Office 365 subscribers will see it first in Word and PowerPoint for PCs, VentureBeat reports. \nOrdinarily, if you drop a photo into PowerPoint you can type out an “Alt Text” title and description for the photo. But not everyone does that when they’re making slide decks. Then, when a blind person opens the slide deck, they won’t be able to understand what’s going on in the picture, which could make the slide or the entire deck more difficult to fully grasp. \nMicrosoft wants to change that. So it’s chosen to automate the process of making Alt Text for photo, drawing on its Cognitive Services Computer Vision application programming interface (API). “Through machine learning, this service will keep improving as more people use it, saving you significant time to make media-rich presentations accessible,” John Jendrezak, accessibility lead and partner director of program management for Microsoft’s Office Engineering team, wrote in a blog post. To use this feature, you’ll simply have to right-click on a photo and select “Automatic Alt Text.” \nThe technology uses a type of artificial intelligence (AI) called deep learning to recognize objects in photos and then figure out the best words to explain the photos in its entirety. From there, operating systems’ screen readers can read the captions aloud. \nDeep learning generally involves training artificial neural networks on lots of data, such as photos, and then getting the neural networks to make inferences about new data. This is a method that has caught on at Apple, Facebook, Google, and Twitter, as well as Microsoft. \nIn fact, earlier this year Facebook did something similar to what Microsoft is doing. It started automatically generating captions of photos that people share so that when blind people are scrolling through the News Feed on iOS, the VoiceOver screen reader embedded in iOS can quickly read out automatically generated captions. As a result, blind people can then understand what people are talking about in the text that people include with the pictures they post, as well as the comments that users make. \nTwitter recently made it possible for users to manually write captions for images they post. While Twitter does do deep learning research, it hasn’t offered to automatically generate captions for images. \nAlso in the blog post Jendrezak noted that Microsoft will be merging the separate fields for title and description. That way, he wrote, “you have no confusion about where to enter alt-text.” Currently to add that information to an image, you have to open the Format pane, choose the Size & Properties tab (in PowerPoint; if you’re using Word, the tab is called Layout & Properties), and select the Alt Text dropdown.

This feature is compatible only on Windows 10 PCs including All-In-Ones and 2-in-1’s with touch screens. This has all the feature just like Amazon Echo and Google Home with an additional screen, which make things more approachable. \nThe software giant is also planning to integrate sharing features, new user interfaces, always-listening Cortana, and apps that take advantage of new APIs, to make it more compelling. Additionally, this functionality will be extended to other platforms including Android, iOS, and Windows 10 Mobile. \nMoreover, the company is also planning to manufacture All-in-Ones specifically for Home Hub with other OEMs like Lenovo and HP. However, the project has been delayed due to more refinement and improvements that need to be made to Windows 10.",

      "text": "\nOne of the interesting apps in Windows 10 is the 3D Builder app which comes pre-installed with every PC running the OS. Today, Microsoft is bringing the 3D Builder app to Windows 10 on other devices — allowing users to build, design and print 3D objects right from their Windows 10 Mobile device or Xbox One console.\nIf you are into 3D, this app will be very useful for you as it includes all of the basic features. According to Microsoft, the app provides “everything you need to make any 3D content printable.” The app can also utilize your device’s camera to turn any real-life object into a 3D object — but the quality isn’t anything close to amazing. You can, of course, load images and turn them into 3D objects. And lastly, you can also open 3D files as the app supports 3MF, STL, OBJ, PLY, and WRL (VRML) files.\nGallery Microsoft has also teamed up with i.materialise to allow users to 3D print their creation from the 3D Builder app. Once you create something and it’s ready to be printed, you can simply click on the print button in the app and Microsoft will redirect you to i.materalise which is where you can get the creation printed and delivered to your house. And if you happen to have a 3D printer at your home, you can also directly print the 3D content from 3D Builder with your printer — but do keep in mind that only a selected number of 3D printers are supported at the moment.\nIf you want to go ahead and give the 3D builder app a try on your Windows 10 smartphone or Xbox One, you can download it from the link below:\nWP-Appbox: 3D Builder (Free, Windows Store) → ",

      "text": "by ATL Leerssens I’ve been using CoRD for years and now that it has more or less dropped out of support and crashes frequently on El Capitan, I moved on to this app after finding it in the App Store. A few things annoy me right out of the gate, and documentation is sparse so I’m not sure if there is a way to reslove them:- With CoRD, Commnd-K integrated so that I could quickly connect to a remote server without having to do a bunch of configuation.- This version of Remote Desktop forces a new connection into Spaces, which seems to be configurable but the option to turn it off is grayed out.Other than that, cut/paste work as expected, which is huge when working with multiple OSes on different windows. Hopefully this app will get some love and improve over time. Works great by SMXSteve I’ve use the Windows version for years and have been using this on my Macbook for four years now. I love it! I can always access my servers and Windows PCs. In fact, I have one Window 7 PC which I use strictly for development. I just remote into it from my Macbook and it works flawlessly! This app needs some resources put to it by SentiBlue I know MS doesn’t pay much attention to this app but for God’s sake it’s like a high school project!There must have been over 100 updates to this app, but the top of the app has always been “My Desktops” without any ability to create groups.I’m a system architect who manages hundreds of Linux servers and dozens of windows. I find it particularly unuseful to have an app that cannot categorize.The app has a minimum width that is much wider than what I wanted it to be because of the “Azure RemoteApp” and “Remote Resources” buttons…The “New” dialog doesn’t have a button… you just fill in and hit close… that doesn’t seem like MS. Where did “Apply” and “OK” go? What if I wanted to “Cancel”?",

      "text": "Microsoft Surface Pro 4 launched by Microsoft VP Panos Panay on October 6, 2016 (Photo : Andrew Burton / Staff) Advertisement \nTech giant Microsoft is planning to upgrade the existing model, Surface Pro 4 with Surface Pro 5 and expected to launch a new smartphone \"Surface Phone\" in MWC 2017. \nMicrosoft Surface Pro 4, the hybrid gadget, launched in October 2015, was a big hit for Microsoft, which helped showcase its prowess in the Tech world. Like its sibling, Microsoft Surface Pro 5, is also expected to outperform in specs and features to take on its rivals head-on. \nAs per Mobipicker , Microsoft Surface Pro 5 is rumored to be embedded with Intel Seventh Generation Kaby Lake processor supported by a whopping 16GB RAM. The hybrid laplet will run on the latest Windows 10 Redsotne2 to be released in 2017. Though sources indicate that display of 4K resolution is on the cards, but at least will stimulate the fans with stunning 2K resolution. \nSurface Pro 5 also believed to come up with a new Surface Pen and USB Type-C connector, bidding adieu to USB-3 of Surface Pro 4. The device is expected address the haunting battery draining issue of Surface Pro 4. The 2-in-1 hybrid device is expected to launch with a price tag of $899 for i5 model and $1599 for top end i7 model. \nMicrosoft Surface Phone hints at the Surface Phone could offer stellar specs like the advanced Qualcomm® Snapdragon® 830 processor supported by 3GB/6GB/8GB RAM, which will enthrall users with high multi-tasking performance while consuming less power, giving more juice for the device. \nIn an interview to the Australian Financial Review , Microsoft CEO, Satya Nadella Said \"We will continue to be in the phone market not as defined by today's market leaders, but by what it is that we can uniquely do in what is the most ultimate mobile device\". This indicates that Microsoft Surface Phone will be nothing short of a world-class phone. \nMicrosoft threw water on fans expectations in October 2016 when devices didn't show up for a probable launch. But, both devices are highly likely to have a synchronous launch in Spring 2017. Windows fans, don't forget to keep a date for that upcoming event. Stay tuned with us for more updates!!

      "text": "\nWhile the Xbox One was once considered to be losing the console wars almost before they started, it appears Microsoft has reversed those struggles. The company had been making headway before this year, though it was slow going.\nSince 2016 kicked off, Microsoft has been making up ground on Sony much quicker thanks in large part to initiatives like its backwards compatibility program. This summer, the Xbox One sold more units than Sony sold PS4s for the first time since the two consoles launched in the US.\nThen Microsoft did it again. Since the launch of the Xbox One S, Microsoft has touted the Xbox One S as the best selling console in the UK. The comeback the console has made is one that Microsoft is clearly quite happy about. Company representatives appear 2016 is the tipping point and they are on more solid footing when it comes to the competition with Sony’s PS4.\n“Since launch, Xbox One S is Britain’s best-selling console in 2016,” Xbox UK marketing director Harvey Eagle stated in an interview with GamesIndustry .\n“I put that down to a combination of things. Firstly, it is a great product with a great design, and the 4K proposition is resonating very strongly. I think we have a great selection of console bundles for those buying for the first time – particularly with FIFA , Minecraft and Battlefield as the core three options.\n“I think we have a great exclusive line-up again this year. Forza Horizon 3 is a great game and really highly rated on Metacritic, and Gears of War 4 is another great example of an exclusive game.\n“And with all of that at a price point that has opened us up to being more attractive to more families than ever before.”\n“Momentum is really important in this business, because it gives confidence to retailers, publishers and to consumers. We are giving them confidence that they have made a right point. I think we’ll look back on 2016 as a tipping point for Xbox One. And as I look forward to 2017, we have some really great things to look forward to that will help us sustain and build on this momentum, including games like Halo Wars 2 and Sea of Thieves, and of course a new Xbox One console in Project Scorpio.”\nThoughts on this?

      "text": "The Microsoft Surface Pro 5 is rumored to feature many improvements over its predecessor, the Surface Pro 4. One such improvement is that the Surface Pro 5 is said to be coming with storage of up to 512 GB. ( Microsoft ) Advertisement \nThe Microsoft Surface Pro 5 is among the best upcoming tablets of 2017 , as the release of the 2-in-1 device that will be the successor to the Surface Pro 4 is long overdue. \nThe rumor mill has been busy churning out reports regarding the Surface Pro 5, and the latest one reveals that the tablet will have many improvements over its predecessor. Microsoft Surface Pro 5 With 512 GB Storage \nAccording to recent rumors, the Surface Pro 5 will pack up to 512 GB of storage , which is double the capacity of the Surface Pro 4 with only up to 256 GB of storage. \nIt has previously been expected that the Surface Pro 5 will also be released with up to 256 GB of storage, in line with the Surface Pro 4, but if this rumor turns out to be true, it seems that Microsoft is looking to take the Surface Pro 5 on an entirely new level, along with the other rumored improvements for the device. Microsoft Surface Pro 5 Improvements \nIn addition to the rumored increase in storage from 256 GB to 512 GB, the Surface Pro 5 is also said to feature better overall performance, including the latest Intel Kaby Lake processor and better battery life compared with the Surface Pro 4. Its predecessor came with several battery drain issues , so this improvement would be a welcome one for fans of the device. \nThere have also been rumors that Microsoft will be adding a USB Type-C port to the Surface Pro 5, which will also be including Thunderbolt 3. \nThe Surface Pen is also said to be coming with improvements, with the accessory to receive wireless charging capabilities from its magnetic dock instead of the replaceable battery in the past. Microsoft Surface Pro 5 Rumors \nMicrosoft is said to be releasing the Windows 10 Redstone 2 operating system in 2017, and it is possible that the Surface Pro 5 would be running it right out of the box. \nAs for the device's RAM, there has so far been no news that Microsoft will be making further improvements to the 16 GB of RAM found in the Surface Pro 4. \nAs for the release date of the Surface Pro 5, a specific date has not yet been determined. It is rumored that the tablet will launch in spring 2017, possibly even as early as January , with the delay in the release date due to Microsoft waiting for Intel to release the Kaby Lake processor that is expected to come out at the end of this year.

      "text": "0 0 \nMicrosoft just released the new Preview build 14977 for Windows 10 Mobile . The build is currently only available for Mobile devices, so Insiders on PC will have to wait some more time to get the new build. \nAs always, Microsoft revealed the list of known issues that build 14977 causes. However, problems listed by Microsoft are not the only problems bothering Insiders. Microsoft’s Jason [MS] said on Microsoft’s forums that some Lumia devices are having problems downloading the new build. \n“Hello Insiders, \nWhile attempting to install build 14977 for Mobile, you may hit an error: 8007007B \nUnfortunately if you hit this error, you will not be able to install 14977. There is no workaround. You’ll need to wait for our next Mobile build release. \nThis issue does not affect all devices and there is no long-term harm from encountering it. The device will simply fail the install and boot back to your current OS build. \nWe’re already working on a resolution so all applicable devices may receive the next update. \nThank you as always, \nJason” \nMicrosoft is currently investigating the issue and the solution should be released soon. This is, so far, the only problem caused by build 14977 we’ve managed to find. Despite that, users are generally unsatisfied. First, the build is late on PC and even Mobile Insiders are having troubles installing it. \nAs soon Microsoft releases a solution, we’ll let you know about it. Also, we’re going to write our traditional report article as soon as users report more problems. \nHave you tried to install the build on your Windows 10 Mobile device yet? Or you’ve encountered some other problems? Let us know in the comments. \nRELATED STORIES YOU NEED TO CHECK OUT:",

      "text": "0 0 \nMicrosoft just released the new build 14977 for Windows 10 Mobile . Unlike the majority of Windows 10 builds, this one was released for Mobile only. Reportedly, the PC release is delayed because a bug that could result in breaking apps. As soon as Microsoft resolves the issue, the build will be released for PC as well. \nThe biggest highlight of Windows 10 Mobile Insider build 14977 is the introduction of an EPUB reader for Microsoft Edge. Beginning with this release, Insiders will be able to read unprotected EPUB books in their default mobile browser. This feature is already available on Windows 10 . \nThe default EPUB reader also has some customization options. Users are able to change font size and themes and there are three themes available: light, sepia, and dark. \nThe EPUB reader for Microsoft Edge is the only major new feature introduced with this build. Microsoft also addressed a huge number of known issues and bugs in build 14977. However, as iss normally the case, the new build also causes some issues to Insiders who install it. \nHere’s the complete list of improvements and bug fixes: “We’ve changed the rendering technology used for many types of UWP app content, so please provide feedback through the Feedback Hub if you notice any new visual glitches in UWP apps. Alarms sent by 3rd party alarm apps will now break through Cortana’s Quiet Hours – we appreciate all the app developers who logged feedback requesting this, keep it coming! We’ve removed the top-level option in Notification Settings to disable alarms on the lock screen – alarm reliability is a top priority for us, and we’ve found this setting was frequently enabled accidentally, without awareness that it would stop alarms from waking the phone when the phone was locked. For those who still wish to enable this setting, it’s will continue to be available under the per-app notification settings. Notifications from Settings can now be customized or disabled – option is available under Settings > System > Notifications > Settings We have enabled OAuth support for Yahoo Mail accounts. This will improve sync reliability for those accounts, and provide a secure experience while browsing your email. We fixed an issue where disconnecting and reconnecting a wired headset while watching a video might result the audio no longer working. We fixed an issue Insiders may have experienced where certain music apps would unexpectedly stop playing music after a single song. We fixed an issue where closing a tab in Microsoft Edge, exiting the app, and then relaunching it would sometimes result in Edge opening to a blank page with the closed tab’s web address in the URL bar. We fixed an issue where the Start Settings page wasn’t rendering when opened on external screen while using Continuum. We’ve made a number of translation improvements, including, for French (France and Canada) speakers, fixing a grammatical error in the “Don’t Forget!” text seen when shutting down the phone so it now says “N’oubliez pas”, and for Chinese speakers, fixing an issue where the option to clear the Chinese Input Method Editor’s input history was displaying in English rather than Chinese. If you see any other translations that aren’t as you’d expect, please log feedback – we’re listening! We fixed an issue where, if the setting to show notifications above lock had been turned off, booting the device and immediately checking the Action Center while the phone was locked could result in the Action Center not displaying any notifications after the phone had been unlocked. We fixed an issue Insiders may have experienced where the Camera app might not appear after using the hardware camera button while the screen was off or while on the Glance screen. We fixed an issue where Bangla (Bangladesh) keyboard text prediction might stop working after entering character followed by a vowel mark.” \nHere’s the complete list of known issues in Windows 10 build 14977: “Please avoid attempting to install new languages, keyboards, and speech packs on your phone. There is a chance these downloads may get stuck and not finish downloading. If you have existing languages, keyboards, and speech packs installed – they will carry over when you update to new builds. You can use Windows Device Recovery Tool to go back to Windows Phone 8.1 or Windows 10 Mobile, install any languages, keyboards, and speech packs you need and then update to the latest build in the Fast ring as a workaround. Windows 10 phones with 8GB of internal storage such as the Lumia 550 will likely receive an 0x800700b7 error when attempting to update to this build. For more details, head over to this forum post. System related notification toasts (e.g. Bluetooth, USB/Autoplay, etc.) do not work.” \nAs for the PC release, we don’t know when will Microsoft introduce it nor if it will bring any new features. As soon as we have more information, we’ll make sure to let keep you updated. \nIn case you’ve already installed build 14977 on your Windows 10 Mobile device, let us know about your experience using it so far. \nRELATED STORIES YOU NEED TO CHECK OUT:",

      "text": "0 0 \nMicrosoft seems to have started giving Office 365 users a notice that their unlimited OneDrive storage will revert back to 1TB beginning on March 1, 2017. Blogger Paul Thurrott posted on Twitter what he claimed to be a screenshot of said notice shared by a reader of his blog. \nThe software giant announced the unlimited OneDrive storage offering for all subscribers of both the consumer and business version of Office 365 in October 2014. Prior to that, Office 365 users only got a maximum of 1TB storage on Microsoft’s cloud-based offering. But in November of last year, the Redmond company retracted its promise due to what it described as an abuse on the part of consumers who used the service for limitless storage. \nMicrosoft lamented then that premium users had used OneDrive as a backup for PCs and huge collections of movies. To stem the supposed abuse, Microsoft decided to scale the unlimited storage offering back to just 1TB and replace the 100GB and 200GB premium plans with a 50GB plan at $1.99 per month. \nPart of backtrack is also the removal of the 15GB bonus for saving camera roll in OneDrive. Then Microsoft gave Office 365 users a one-year grace period to keep their storage beyond 1TB. Come March 1 of next year, users will have to cut back to below 1TB. Many users unhappy with the backtrack \nAlthough many expected the scale-back to come one day, not everyone will surely welcome the move. Some users find it “pathetic” that Microsoft should retract its promise to all subscribers just because of the perceived abuse by a few users. Others believe Microsoft should never have made the announcement to begin with, knowing that consumers would take the company’s word for it and use the unlimited storage. \nOnce the backtrack takes effect, OneDrive users will need to back up their data somewhere else, though they will receive pro-rated refund.

      "text": "Next Generation Communications Week in Review: Microsoft, Nokia, Pareteum December 03, 2016 By Paula Bernier , Executive Editor, TMC \nNokia ( News - Alert ) and Pareteum made headlines this week in Next Generation Communications news. \nAs contributing writer Steve Anderson explained in a piece posted yesterday, Nokia – which once led the way in the cell phone market – is making another significant push to expand its presence in this important space via a new agreement with HMD Global Oy . That entails various transactions between Foxconn Technology Group, HMD, and Microsoft ( News - Alert ) that allow HMD to be the new home of Nokia devices for the next decade. \n“We've been overwhelmed by the enthusiasm shown around the world for the return of the Nokia brand to smartphones,” said Nokia Technologies' interim president Brad Rodriguez. “The HMD Global team has the ambition, talent, and resources to bring a new generation of Nokia branded phones to market, and we wish them every success. I'm sure our millions of Nokia fans will be excited to see their new products!” \nThe smartphone arena as a whole is something of a mixed bag, as Anderson wrote in a different piece this week. He noted IDC ( News - Alert ) data showing that smartphone shipments were up .6 percent this year, but noted that’s much slower growth from the previous years, when shipments were up 10.4 percent between 2014 and 2015. Nonetheless, it should be noted that this year more than one billion smartphones will ship, according to IDC, so this remains an enormous market. \nAnderson this week also wrote about the new demand for test equipment that coming 5G networks are expected to create. And, in a separate story, he talked about Nokia’s efforts in Scandanavia . That includes the company’s work on fixed broadband in Denmark and its collaboration with Finnish operator Elisa ( News - Alert ) on mobile voice services indoors and out. \nAs for Pareteum , I talked to the company at the recent TMC ( News - Alert ) Editors’ Day in Santa Clara, Calif. There, the company’s CEO, Vic Bozzo, told me about the company’s work in the Internet of Things. The company, formerly called Elephant Talk, provides mobile virtual network operators and mobile network operators with cloud-based mobile communications infrastructure, operating software, and managed services.

      "title": "Xbox Games With Gold December 2016 list, news: Microsoft announces four new games free for this month",
      "text": "  \n(YouTube/Xbox) Inset is a gameplay screenshot of \"Sleeping Dogs\" from Xbox's announcement of Xbox Games With Gold December 2016 free games. \nBefore November ended, Microsoft announced four new free games - two each for Xbox One and Xbox 360 players - which can be played for the rest of the holiday season. \nFor the whole month of December, Xbox One players with Games With Gold membership can access \"Sleeping Dogs: Definitive Edition\" for free. The main game was originally released in 2012. It is an open world action-adventure game developed by United Front Games and Square Enix where players get to control the Chinese-American main character named Wei Shen. \nWei is a police officer who needs to go undercover to infiltrate an infamously renowned criminal organization called the Sun On Yee Triad. The Definitive Edition, which comes free this month, is the remastered version of the game for Xbox One. \nThe survival horror game \"Outlast\" goes up for free on Xbox One from Dec. 16 to Jan. 15. The game is played in first-person mode and lets players assume the character of an investigative journalist named Miles Upshur. Advertisement \nWhat separates \"Outlast\" from other survival horror games is the fact that players have no access to weapons. Miles' only options are to run and hide from the creepy elements that reside in the asylum he decided to investigate. \nOn the other hand, Xbox 360 players can access the two-dimensional platform game \"Outland\" from the 1st of December until Dec. 15. In the game, players will use weapons made up of Light and Dark energies which are characterized as rays of blue and red, respectively. Meanwhile, on Dec. 16 through the end of the year, the 2008-released racing video game title \"Burnout Paradise\" will be accessible for free. \nXbox One players can access the free Xbox 360 titles through the Backward Compatibility program. \nXbox Live programming head Larry \"Major Nelson\" Hryb reminds Xbox players: \"Titles are available as free downloads for qualifying Xbox Live Gold members in all markets where Xbox Live is available. Some regions may offer different titles depending on market availability.\" Copyright © 2016 Ecumenical News",

      "text": "  \n(Microsoft) Shown in the photo is the Surface Pro 4. Rumor has it that Microsoft will unveil the Surface Pro 5 at the Mobile World Congress 2017, which is happening from February 27 to March 2, 2017. \nAlthough there is still no certainty as to when the Surface Pro 5 will arrive in the market, the latest in the rumor mill claims that the upcoming Microsoft tablet-laptop hybrid will awe the tech and gadget world because of its impressive specs and features that are a definite upgrade from the current version of the device. \nPrior to the Microsoft event last October, it was believed that the Surface Pro 5 will be one of the devices that the brand will unveil in the said event. However, to the disappointment of many, the Surface Pro 5 was not even mentioned at the event as it cast the spotlight on the Surface Pro i7 and the Surface Studio only. \nNonetheless, despite the uncertainty on when the Surface Pro 5 will be unveiled, rumors about its possible specs and features continue to surface online. While there are many rumors attached to the upcoming device, the latest unconfirmed reports claim that the Surface Pro 5 will boast of a longer battery life, sharper screen, and a rechargeable stylus pen. \nTech Radar suspects that the Surface Pro 5 will have a longer battery life as compared to the Surface Pro 4. The online publication opines that the upcoming device may be capable of video playback for 7 hours, roughly 2 hours longer than the current 5 hours and 15 minutes of the current Surface Pro. Advertisement \nIt is also believed that the upcoming Surface Pro 5 will boast of 4K screen resolution that will make it more ideal for entertainment purposes. If the device is, indeed, to come with 4K screen resolution, it can even be ideal for work as well as it can be perfect for editing photos or videos, too. \nWhile it's true that the current Surface Pro already comes with a Surface Pen, it is said that the one to come with the Surface Pro 5 is rechargeable. Allegedly, the accessory will automatically charge when it is docked to the device magnetically. \nMeanwhile, rumors claiming that Microsoft is unveiling the Surface Pro 5 along with the alleged Surface Phone in the upcoming Mobile World Congress (MWC) happening in Barcelona, Spain from Feb. 28 to March 2, 2017 have surfaced. If this turns out to be true, only then can it be confirmed whether the rumored specs and features of the Surface Pro 5 are true or otherwise. Copyright © 2016 Ecumenical News",

      "text": "Microsoft Surface 5 specs rumors point to increased storage and Intel Kaby Lake processors Microsoft Surface 5 specs rumors point to increased storage and Intel Kaby Lake processors Posted: Tags : Windows - Windows + Microsoft - Microsoft + Tablets - Tablets + When maxed out, the Surface Pro 4 is a productivity force to be reckoned with, as it features an Intel chip, 16GB of RAM, and 256GB of fast storage. However, the tablet, released in October last year, is positively due for a refresh. According to the most recent data, Microsoft is preparing various hardware and software upgrades for its fifth-generation tablet. First of all, the SSD storage of the top-line model could be increased to a massive 512GB.Performance-wise, the tablet should benefit from Intel's Kaby Lake processor line-up, offering number crunching and battery life improvements. Microsoft might also upgrade connectivity with USB Type-C and Thunderbolt 3 ports, letting the tablet talk with the most recent of peripherals. Speaking of peripherals, the Surface Pen stylus will be awarded wireless charging capabilities with an included magnetic charging dock. There are speculations that the display resolution might be increased to 4K, as Intel's Kaby Lake architecture offers native 4K video support. But this doesn't mean that Microsoft will ride the ultra high-resolution train just yet, as all that pixel pushing will inevitably strain the hardware.Still, MS could upgrade the screen with a built-in fingerprint scanner, as it has patented the required technology years ago. Scheduled for a possible release come Spring next year, the Surface Pro 5 is expected to run Windows 10 Redstone 3 right out of the box. The upcoming operating system will be focused on unifying the platform across all Windows devices, including the HoloLens virtual realty device. However, previous reports have suggested that Redstone 3 will be released Fall 2017, so we'd rather take this particular rumor with a grain of salt.",

      "text": "Powershelf® and Hitachi Consulting are working with Microsoft to introduce smart shelves to US retail stores. The new Powershelf smart shelf units will be installed in 15 supermarkets of a leading Midwest supermarket chain. KING’S HAWAIIAN®, America’s leading provider of Hawaiian food, will be the first to use the new smart shelves to reduce out-of-stock incidents and ensure shoppers can find its products while shopping this holiday season. By dramatically reducing the amount of time KING’S HAWAIIAN shelves are empty, the company is making customers’ shopping experiences a little less frustrating and also limiting the revenue that can potentially be lost when shelves are empty. The units consist of a series of shelves that hold and display products. Built-in Powershelf technology tracks product availability; when a shelf is empty, a restocking alert is automatically sent to store personnel. The solution utilizes Microsoft Azure and Microsoft Power BI to analyze when, where, and why products sell so fast, allowing retailers and consumer product companies to identify trends and avoid out of stocks before they ever happen.\nJohn Linehan, Executive Vice President of Strategy and Business Development at KING’S HAWAIIAN, was impressed with early pilot results and believes the technology will lead to better customer satisfaction and improved sales performance. “Improving out of stocks is an important strategy for KING’S HAWAIIAN, and Powershelf will give us the data to manage this metric most effectively,” said Linehan. “We look forward to expanding this technology to as many of our retailers as soon as it is practical.”\nKING’S HAWAIIAN and its respective retailers and distributors will be able to access data gathered by the units—including historical out-of-stock incidents and loss of potential sales—in real-time through the Internet of Things (IoT) with a customized digital dashboard co-developed by Microsoft and Hitachi Consulting.\n“We have spent years working with our partners to develop this IoT solution that helps to solve out of stocks, and I am excited to see it introduced in time for this holiday shopping season,” said Larry McWilliams Co-CEO of Powershelf. “By making more products available we are providing shoppers with a more positive shopping experience, while reducing the cost of restocking. This is a powerful first step into the future of retail.”\nBrendan O'Meara, Managing Director of Worldwide Retail at Microsoft, explained why the data gathered by these units is so valuable. “Our collaboration with Powershelf enables us to leverage the Microsoft Cloud to combine a retailer’s inventory data with the data Powershelf sensors gather from the store floor and visualize it using Power BI tools,” said O’Meara. “Decision makers can use their custom dashboard to see the state of their stores and supply chains in real-time and react much faster than in the past.”\nAbout Powershelf\nPowershelf is a leading provider of retail technology solutions. The patented technology—the Powershelf system—provides constant power and two-way communications to software-enabled applications and devices that deliver a variety of advertising, merchandising and pricing services to customers. Powershelf is designed to address the critical, ongoing challenges faced by retailers and CPG manufacturers around the world.

      "title": "Xbox Scorpio vs Xbox One S",
      "text": "Video game consoles like Microsoft’s Xbox One owe their popularity to simplicity. To let PC gamers tell it, piecing together a gaming computer is something that everyone can and wants to do, but that’s simply not true. A PC that’s robust enough to offer a great gaming experience doesn’t come cheap, even if barebones PCs are dropping in price. They’re also forgetting how complicated maintaining a gaming PC is. Every week there’s new drivers to install. Every day there’s some new report of a graphics card bug or game issue that prevents some gamers from getting the most out of their newly purchased title. Microsoft knows all this, which is why it’s creating the Xbox Scorpio .\nAdvertisement\nThe Xbox Scorpio is Microsoft trying to capitalize on the strengths of PC gaming and console gaming. Everyone won’t buy a gaming PC, but a vocal group of dedicated gamers want the best visuals possible. What’s more, they’re willing to pay more than the average cost of a video game console to get those improved visuals. At the same time that it’s embracing these elite gamers, the company is doubling down on the core mission of video game consoles in general.\nGamers might be ready to pay more for the best graphics, but it’s a sure bet they’ll appreciate not having to worry about graphic driver updates or whether their controller will work with the game they just purchased. Microsoft is betting that they still want effortless multiplayer over Xbox Live.\nRead: Xbox Scorpio Release Confirmed: What You Need to Know\nAdvertisement\nSet to arrive in 2017, the Xbox Scorpio is the most exciting and ambitious thing to come out of Xbox since the first Xbox One, and it’ll be sold alongside today’s Xbox One S. Here’s how the two compare.\nAdvertisement\nXbox Scorpio vs Xbox One S: How They’re the Same You may not know this, but Microsoft announced two new video game consoles at the Electronic Entertainment Expo back in June. One of these was the Xbox Scorpio, and the other was the Xbox One S.\nThe Xbox One S is basically an all-new Xbox One. It’s a streamlined, albeit slightly upgraded, version of the Xbox One that shoppers have been able to buy since November of 2013. The console is a lot smaller than the previous Xbox, but don’t be fooled. It’s meant for the same kind of shopper: someone that’s looking to play the latest games with as little hassle as possible. Shoppers choose their storage size, with 1TB, 2TB and 500GB options available worldwide. This console does come with an upgraded Xbox Wireless Controller and support for television sets with High-Dynamic Range color contrast and 4K Ultra HD resolutions. Videos play at 4K resolution, but games are up-scaled to 4K.\nRead: Xbox One S vs PS4 Slim: Which is Better for 4K & HDR Video Games?\nAdvertisement\nThink of the Xbox One S as a starting point for the Xbox Scorpio. We don’t know what storage options Microsoft will offer, but we do know that Scorpio is a variant of the Xbox One. It’ll use the same apps, the same Xbox Live Gold subscription for multiplayer and offer the same games. We’re not sure how much storage the console will pack yet.\nXbox Scorpio vs Xbox One S: How They’re Different Unlike the Xbox One and Xbox One S, Microsoft is aiming to create the best machine at the lowest price possible. When it designed the Xbox One and Xbox One S, the company had to stick to a price that families could stomach. Visuals and features were big concerns, but not as big as creating a machine that the masses could afford and not empty their savings account.\nThe Xbox Scorpio is for those that want the best graphics. Hardware upgrades inside allow it to handle games with higher resolutions than what the Xbox One and Xbox One S offer. Games won’t get scaled up from lower resolutions on 4K televisions. Games that offer 4K support will look better on the Xbox Scorpio than the Xbox One S on a 4K television for sure.\nAdditionally, all that processing power will allow Microsoft to explore new features the current Xbox One consoles can’t offer because of their internals. Maybe you’ve heard of the Gear VR from Samsung or Facebook’s Oculus Rift VR? Technology companies are betting big on virtual reality headsets that allow you to feel like you’re in a game. Pulling this off requires some serious internal horsepower that the Xbox One S and Xbox One don’t offer.\nAdvertisement\nIf the original Xbox One was good for gaming and the Xbox One S is great for gaming, the Xbox Scorpio will be the best at gaming, with a price that’s sure to reflect that.\nXbox Scorpio vs Xbox One S: What We Don’t Know About Scorpio Microsoft likes to telegraph its next hardware moves in advance, giving it time to react to feedback from the community and tune its message. The company revealed the Xbox Scorpio at E3 2016, but hasn’t said anything new about the console since. There are rumors out there about the console, but nothing that’s been substantiated.\nSpeculation of the Xbox Scorpio’s price hasn’t stopped since the reveal.. Truth is, we only know that it’ll certainly cost more than the Xbox One S. It starts at $299.99. We’re also pretty sure that the Xbox Scorpio will be physically bigger than the Xbox One S, but that’s more physics than confirmed tidbit. Microsoft has yet to reveal what the console looks like.\nAdvertisement\nXbox Scorpio vs Xbox One S: Should You Wait to Buy an Xbox One? Should you purchase an Xbox One S or wait for the Xbox Scorpio? That’s the question everyone is asking.\nIf you’re one of the millions that own a first generation Xbox One, you absolutely want to wait. Sure, if you have a 4K television, maybe upgrading to Xbox One S and not waiting around to see what the Scorpio has to offer is a good idea, but that’s a pretty narrow group of people. You probably don’t have a 4K television.\nThose that value low-cost over graphics should also buy the Xbox One S now. There’s no reason for you to wait.\nIf you’ve yet to purchase a video game console, but are sure that you want the best graphics possible, definitely wait until at least this June. By July, we’ll likely have more info about the console. Microsoft is expected to talk more about Scorpio at the Electronics Entertainment Expo trade show in June.",

      "text": "Microsoft to intensify partnership with Ghana to combat cybercrime By GNA Previous | Next \nBy Iddi Yire, GNAAccra, Dec. 3, GNA - Microsoft will continue to intensify its support for Ghana in combating cybercrime, Ms Angela Ng'ang'a, Microsoft's Corporate Affairs Lead for East and South Africa, has said. \nShe said the fight against cybercrime required the collective efforts of stakeholders through information sharing, awareness creation, capacity building and putting in place the right technical mechanism. \nShe lauded Ghana for the passage of the Data Protection Act, 2012 (Act 843) to safeguard personal information. \nThe law provides for the process by which one could obtain, hold, use or disclose personal data while the Data Protection Commission has been established as an independent body to regulate and implement its provisions. \nSpeaking to the Ghana News Agency in Accra on the sidelines of a Cybersecurity Conference, Ms Ng'ang'a said there was the need for governments and corporate leadership to greatly improve their cybersecurity programmes in order to enhance their preparedness to combat cybercrime. \nThe conference was organised by the National Information Technology Agency (NITA) in collaboration with Microsoft as part the 2016 National Cybersecurity Week Celebration. \nThe Security Week Celebration was to create awareness on computer security incident response teams and their role in ensuring cybersecurity. \nCybersecurity is the body of technologies, processes and practices designed to protect networks, computers, programmes and data from attack, damage or unauthorised access. \nMs Ng'ang'a said the Digital Crime Unit of Microsoft had been working with governments in Africa to come out with modalities to combat cybercrime. \nShe said in February, this year, Bangladesh nearly lost $101 million through cybercrime. \nMs Ng'ang'a said there were about one billion Microsoft uses worldwide and that the Cyber Defence Operation Centre of Microsoft received over 300 million heists or signals intending to commit crime daily. \nShe, however, explained that some cyber threats recorded might be due to malfunctioning personal computers (PCs). \nShe cited October 31 to November 6 when Microsoft recorded over 8,434 heists from Ghana alone; adding that in the week before it recorded 8,300 cases. \nMs Ng'ang'a said on the average there were about one million heists sent from Ghana on weekly basis with the intention to commit cybercrime. \nShe said worldwide 63 per cent of organisations were not having the capacity to know that their system had been breached. \nShe said statistics showed that in 2015 it took 220 days for most organisations to know that their cybersecurity system had been breached. \nDigital risk assessment and employing the right people were critical elements for organisations in the fight against cybercrime, she said. \nGNA",

      "text": "by Brandon Hill   Microsoft Pauses Windows 10 Insider Preview Builds As It Preps For Unified Update Platform If you’re a Windows Insider that loves to see a steady stream of preview builds of Windows 10 come through via the Fast ring , things are about to slow down a bit. Microsoft announced yesterday that it will “pause” the release of Windows 10 Insider Preview builds on both the Fast and Slow rings.\nMicrosoft’s Dona Sarkar broke the news in a blog posting concerning the release of Windows 10 Mobile Insider Preview Build 14977: \nWe are getting ready to start releasing PC builds to Insiders using UUP. To prepare for this, we are going to pause all PC builds for both the Fast and Slow rings starting this evening (Friday 12/2). We will begin flighting the latest builds via UUP starting with our internal rings first then to Insiders based on each ring’s promotion criteria. We’re excited to be able to release builds for PC to Insiders using UUP! Mobile builds are not impacted by this. \nMicrosoft first announced the UUP (Unified Update Platform) in early November , and it brings a number of new features to Windows 10 that makes retrieving the latest updates more efficient. UUP uses differential downloads to dramatically reduce the package size for updates on both PC and mobile platforms. “This will eventually be impactful for PCs where users can expect their download size to decrease by approximately 35% when going from one major update of Windows to another,” wrote Microsoft’s Bill Karagounis in November. \nUUP also makes checking for updates more efficient, reducing the amount of data that is sent to the client and processing times required, since the actual Windows Update service determines which updates are needed. These performance benefits will make a much larger impact on Windows 10 Mobile users than those using Windows 10 on PCs. \nMicrosoft has also made the OS upgrade process for those running Windows 10 Mobile easier and more in line with what takes place on the PC. “On your phone, we would sometimes require you to install in two-hops (updates) to get current,” added Karagounis. “With UUP, we now have logic in the client that can automatically fallback to what we call a ‘canonical’ build, allowing you to update your phone in one-hop, just like the PC.” \nThe Insider Preview builds of Windows 10 Mobile have had UUP support baked in since November, so we should see the functionality move over to the PC side once Microsoft hits the “resume” button.",

But now a newer Anniversary update CU build, 14393.573 has appeared on the site BuildFeed , that tracks internal builds under testing at Microsoft. The Build 14393.573 has been compiled on November 30. It marks a big jump in sub-version number over the last Windows 10 Mobile release Build 14393.448 to non-insiders .

      "text": "» News & Magazin-Redakteur Neu aufgetauchte Gerüchte zum Nachfolger des Surface Pro 4 besagen, dass Microsoft wohl einige von vielen sehnlichst erwartete Verbesserungen vornehmen dürfte. So werden die Skylake-Prozessoren im Surface Pro 4 gegen Vertreter der neuen Kaby Lake-Generation ausgetauscht. Weiters dürften 512 GB Speicher zum Standard werden und endlich ein USB-C-Port mit Thunderbolt 3-Unterstützung inkludiert werden. Ob das auf Kosten des Full-Size USB 3.0 Ports geht, ist leider nicht bekannt. Der Surface Pen dürfte statt der austauschbaren Batterie zukünftig Wireless Charging unterstützen. Ob Microsoft die Auflösung des PixelSense-Displays erhöhen wird, ist umstritten, zumal UHD-Auflösung die Batterielaufzeit reduzieren wird, die sich stattdessen aber im nächsten Modell insgesamt verbessert haben soll. Dem Vernehmen nach könnte Microsoft aber einen Windows Hello kompatiblen Fingerabdrucksensor unterhalb des Displays verbauen, ein entsprechendes Patent besitzt der Hersteller schon seit einigen Jahren. Vermutlich wird Microsoft das Surface Pro 5 nach der Präsentation des Windows 10 Creator's Updates im Frühjahr 2017 vorstellen und das neue Surface-Modell dann schon damit ausliefern. Tests",

      "text": "0 0 \nMany Microsoft fans wonder what the future holds for Windows phones. Satya Nadella recently offered an answer to that question, but without giving too many details. At the annual shareholder meeting in Bellevue, Washington, Nadella confirmed once again that Microsoft isn’t stepping away from supporting Windows phones . \nActually, this is an old line. Microsoft keeps on repeating it from time to time, trying to reassure fans that everything is going according to plan. However, we all know that the popularity of Windows phones is dropping by the day. \nOf course, this causes much worry among Microsoft’s shareholders. Actually, one shareholder bluntly asked Nadella was his vision on Windows phone was. You can read his answer below. Microsoft won’t give up on Windows phones \nIn other words, we think about the mobility of the human being across all of the devices, not just the mobility of a single device. That said we are not stepping away or back from our focus on our mobile devices. \nWhat we are going to do is focus that effort on places where we have differentiation. If you take Windows Phone, where we are differentiated in Windows phone is it’s manageability, it’s security, it’s continuing capability that is the ability to have a phone that in fact can even act like a PC. So, we are going to double down on those points of differentiation. In fact, the HP X3, which came out recently, is perhaps a great example of a differentiated device built using the Windows phone platform and that sort of points for the direction. We will keep looking at different forms, different functions that we can bring to mobile devices, while also supporting our software across a variety of devices. So, that’s the approach you will see us take. \nWe are not stepping away from supporting our Windows phone users. But at the same time, we are recognizing that there are other platforms in mobile that have higher share and we want to make sure that our software is available on that. Will this strategy be successful? \nOnly time will tell if Microsoft’s differentiation-based strategy will work in the long term. For the time being, this strategy isn’t working very well. The HP Elite X3 is only on the 19th place in the top of the most popular Windows 10 Mobile phones. Of course, this device has the potential of becoming more popular. Nevertheless, taking into account the publicity it benefited from, it’s fair to say everybody expected the HP X3 to be more popular than it is. \nWhat do you think about Nadella’s statement? Do you think this differentiation-based approach will be successful? Would you adopt a different strategy if you were in Microsoft’s CEO’s place? \nRELATED STORIES YOU NEED TO CHECK OUT:",

      "title": "Why I’m Leaving Apple for Microsoft: Switching as a Photographer",
      "text": "\nApple, we had a good run… Through the many iPads, iPhones, MacBooks, Mac Pros, heck, even the Apple Watch, it was a good run indeed. However, times have changed, and that beauty that was once your innovation has now been covered up with the makeup that is nice marketing.\nDon’t get me wrong, I am writing this on iMac number three, but like all other Apple products, it will soon be slower and barely usable due to some OS update that, while not mandatory, will show me an “update” banner ruthlessly until I succumb. But as I look back on the good times, I start to see what our relationship really was.\nI was young and easily influenced. I didn’t just like Apple products, I looked up to them, for they were what professional photographers used. But now that my career as an advertising photographer is no longer new, I find the “need” that once existed is no longer there. When I get asked by strangers how I can get by as a photographer without having an iPhone, the reality of the relationship is drawn into complete focus.\nIt all started with a MacBook Air…\nI was just out of college, and starting this career that is photography. I didn’t have a lot of money, but knew I wanted an Apple computer since they were made for creatives. Watching the keynote where Steve Jobs pulled the MacBook Air out of an envelope, I was smitten. \n\nUnfortunately for me, I had to wait until I could buy a used one on Craigslist because the price new was too much. Creepy/shady transaction aside, there I stood with my first Apple product. It was perfect in every way, from the battery life, to the size of it, to how it felt to type on it. Over the years, many a blog post would be written on that little laptop and some incredible photo shoots would see their files transferred on its hard drive as I flew home.\nHowever, as time went on, it got slower and slower. Through the latest and greatest OS updates that claimed to make it “faster,” my little MacBook Air would barely run Safari. But not to worry, I had been fortunate to have some success in this career, so I could buy a new MacBook that ran like the old one used to. On top of that, I could get a powerful laptop on which I could do all my editing while on set.\nEnter the MacBook Pro…\nImmediately upon taking it out of the box I remember thinking, it’s a bit big, but it’s like having a desktop that I can take with me everywhere. This argument fought in my brain, only to be quelled by the words of Jonathan Ive telling us that the fans were not symmetrical in it so it would be quieter. I carried around the MacBook Pro to every shoot for years, even to set with me as recently as last week. However, I have yet to ever edit a file on it, sans a quick resize.\nWhile it may be possible to adjust files from smaller DSLRs, the idea of manipulating a 100 megapixel file on it is humorous at best. In short, my laptop has been what I have always wanted it to be, a file transportation system that I can write blog posts on.\nSo with that in mind, I began to crave the return of the MacBook Air. It was small, light and easy to chuck files on before getting on a plane. However, what we got was a new laptop that costs more to have less buttons (but at least we can select emojis on the keyboard). Herein lies my concern about Apple and the reason for my change.\n\nIn the past, the support for the creative community by Apple was obvious. They made the products that kept people that craved uniqueness, unique. The OS was smooth as to not inhibit creativity, and it WAS the only option we had, for Microsoft was for accountants, paper pushers, and grey cubicles.\nI drank the punch — hell, I served it too (I may have spoken for Apple once or twice). However, this “uniqueness” starts to lose its shine after I spent the better half of a day trying to teach my parents and grandparents how to use an iPhone. No longer is it just the product that creatives use to create, it is now the product that elderly people in Arizona stare at while driving off roads trying to figure out why Siri won’t listen. \nFor Apple, everyone using their products is actually a great thing. Unfortunately, it came at a cost. What was once a beautiful platform that creative professionals craved has now become a series of comprises in a walled garden ecosystem that only adds to the grind. In an effort to make products for everyone, Apple has begun neglecting the market that has always stood behind them: artists.\nOver the last couple years, I have become weary of Apple — no longer jaded, I guess. I got rid of my iPhones and Apple Watches and slowly began to see that I didn’t miss them much at all. Beyond the subtle purge of iOS devices, I also found I was becoming unfazed by the marketing hype around each product. This was the turning point. It was at this moment that I looked at Microsoft products objectively.\nI didn’t look at it and think, “Hmm, it doesn’t have a slider bar at the bottom for me to adjust critical hue on a photo,” because I know that in no universe would I ever do that. I started a checklist of things I wanted in a computer and was finding that they existed in both platforms. To my surprise, I even found things like a built-in SD card reader to be on some of the Windows laptops whereas Apple has removed them and almost every other port from their newest line (not to mention taking away MagSafe!).\nBeyond the ports and processors, there was the recurring question in my mind of “What do I need?” versus “What does Apple tell me I need?” The answer to this one is tricky, because it’s personal and doesn’t apply equally across photography. So for the purpose of keeping this one personal, I will go with “What do I need?” And the answer to that question is, “not much.”\n\nTo be honest, I just need a hard drive, screen, keyboard and card reader. Photoshoots for advertising campaigns will never be run off of laptops and usually have one to two people on crew just to run the digital village (the computers and monitors for clients to preview images and for retouchers to comp). Within this part of the set, the only computers are desktop monsters as they now have to burn through 100MP files like they were small JPEGs.\nSo removing the need to edit or shoot to my laptop, I am left with needing a computer to do the day-to-day work with and transfer files. The latter of which is even low on the priority list as the digital village usually puts out two sets of hard drives (one for the client, one for the photographer) when leaving the set. However, knowing that I have the hero files on a third location helps me to sleep better.\nBy now you are starting to see that my “needs” versus the what I “should have” from Apple’s marketing are in significant contradiction. On one hand, I had a company (Apple) that was “for creatives,” and on the other a company (Microsoft) for the accountants… and then I saw the Surface Studio.\n\nWhat Microsoft did in the video debuting the Surface Studio was show me not just a computer that looked quite unique, but support for a community, artists. I guess they out-Apple’d, Apple. While I still haven’t decided on whether or not to grab a Surface Studio, I immediately ordered a Windows OS laptop. Time will tell how theory and application apply to a complete crossover to Microsoft, but in practice over the past few weeks there has been a lot of promise.\n\nWhat sticks with me is how much I, and many other photographers, would push the iPhone’s camera with the line of, “the camera doesn’t make the photographer.” Then in the same heartbeat would say something like, “creatives only use Apple.” Were we all trying to be so unique that we ended up amalgamating into one?\nOver the next few photography campaigns I am going to take the new laptop with me and integrate it into my workflow. Whether it works remains to be seen. However, there is a certain freedom in self-expression, and for a quiet creative like myself, that expression is choice.\nAbout the author : Blair Bunting is a commercial advertising photographer based out of Phoenix, Arizona.

An anonymous reader writes: This week saw the first proof of concept for Node.js API (or NAPI for short), \"making module maintainers' lives easier by defining a stable module API that is independent from changes in [Google's JavaScript engine] V8 and allowing modules to run against newer versions of Node.js without recompilation .\" Their announcement cites both the efforts of the Node.js API working group and of ChakraCore, the core part of the Chakra Javascript engine that powers Microsoft Edge. And there was also a second announcement -- that the Node.js build system \"will start producing nightly node-chakracore builds , enabling Node.js to be used with the ChakraCore JavaScript engine. \"These initial efforts are stepping stones to make Node.js VM-neutral, which would allow more opportunities for Node.js in IoT and mobile use cases as well as a variety of different systems.\" One IBM runtime developer called it \"a concrete step toward the strategic end goal of VM neutrality,\" and the Node.js Foundation believes that the API will ultimately result in \"more modules to choose from, and more stability with modules without the need to continually upgrade.\" ",

      "text": "In a new report from The Intercept , 8 out of 9 major technology firms either gave no reply or took no position when asked if they would cooperate with the incoming Trump administration in building a national registry of Muslims. Only a spokesperson for Twitter made clear the company would not cooperate.\nMicrosoft said it was \"not going to talk about hypotheticals at this point,\" while pointing to company statements on security collaboration between government and the tech industry.\nGet Data Sheet , Fortune 's technology newsletter.\nBooz Allen Hamilton declined to answer the question. IBM , Apple , Google , Facebook, SRA International, and Canada's CGI did not respond to The Intercept's inquiry.\nThe Intercept says it sought answers for two weeks, reaching out to companies via phone and email.\nPresident-Elect Donald Trump and his transition team have waffled on several of his campaign promises, but they seem to still be considering a registry of immigrants from Muslim countries, and possibly of Muslim Americans. Under such a system, immigrants or citizens in a database could be subject to interrogations and other forms of monitoring.\nHow exactly such a system would work is still unclear, but it's easy to imagine information harvested from social media, big data analytics, and large-scale database infrastructure being attractive tools for anyone trying to build it.\nFor more on privacy and security, watch our video. \nIt's a bit surprising to see that Apple did not provide a reply to the inquiry, considering the months-long legal battle it waged against the FBI over providing tools to access an iPhone used by a terrorist attacker. The same could be said for Google, whose longtime motto \"Don't Be Evil\" was often interpreted as a promise to act responsibly with users' data.\nAs The Intercept's Sam Biddle made clear, providing no answer isn't the same as \"tacitly endorsing\" a Muslim registry. But the hesitancy of normally pro-privacy companies to take a position could be seen as an index of a political landscape that has shifted massively.",

      "text": "\n© 2016 Time Inc. All rights reserved. Facebook, Google, Microsoft, IBM, and Apple Don’t Rule Out Helping Track Muslims \nIn a new report from The Intercept , 8 out of 9 major technology firms either gave no reply or took no position when asked if they would cooperate with the incoming Trump administration in building a national registry of Muslims. Only a spokesperson for Twitter made clear the company would not cooperate. \nMicrosoft said it was “not going to talk about hypotheticals at this point,” while pointing to company statements on security collaboration between government and the tech industry. Get Data Sheet , Fortune ’s technology newsletter. \nBooz Allen Hamilton declined to answer the question. IBM , Apple , Google , Facebook, SRA International, and Canada’s CGI did not respond to The Intercept’s inquiry. \nThe Intercept says it sought answers for two weeks, reaching out to companies via phone and email. \nPresident-Elect Donald Trump and his transition team have waffled on several of his campaign promises, but they seem to still be considering a registry of immigrants from Muslim countries, and possibly of Muslim Americans. Under such a system, immigrants or citizens in a database could be subject to interrogations and other forms of monitoring. \nHow exactly such a system would work is still unclear, but it’s easy to imagine information harvested from social media, big data analytics, and large-scale database infrastructure being attractive tools for anyone trying to build it. For more on privacy and security, watch our video. \nIt’s a bit surprising to see that Apple did not provide a reply to the inquiry, considering the months-long legal battle it waged against the FBI over providing tools to access an iPhone used by a terrorist attacker. The same could be said for Google, whose longtime motto “Don’t Be Evil” was often interpreted as a promise to act responsibly with users’ data. \nAs The Intercept’s Sam Biddle made clear, providing no answer isn’t the same as “tacitly endorsing” a Muslim registry. But the hesitancy of normally pro-privacy companies to take a position could be seen as an index of a political landscape that has shifted massively. ",

      "text": "Blocked Unblock Follow Following Node.js Foundation is a collaborative open source project dedicated to building and supporting the Node.js platform. https://nodejs.org/en/ 4 days ago IBM, Intel, Microsoft, Mozilla and NodeSource Join Forces on Node.js API; Node.js Build System will Start Producing Nightly node-chakracore Builds Part of Node.js Foundation’s mission is growing Node.js everywhere. The Node.js platform is already available on a variety of VMs, like Samsung’s JerryScript , a lightweight JavaScript engine for the Internet of Things. While many steps are needed to allow Node.js to work in VM environments outside of V8, the work the Node.js API working group and ChakraCore are doing are important steps to offer greater choice. Today, we are excited to announce several initial milestones in these efforts. The first is centered around Node.js API (ABI Stable Module API or NAPI for short), which is focused on defining a stable module API that is independent from changes in V8. Today, the first proof of concept in these efforts will be on display at Node.js Interactive North America . Arunesh Chandra, senior program manager for ChakraCore at Microsoft, is demoing the NAPI during his talk at 4:10 pm CT in Salon 6. All talks recorded at Node.js Interactive will be available after the event on our YouTube page . The second milestone, outside of the Node.js API work, is with ChakraCore. The Node.js build system will start producing nightly node-chakracore builds, enabling Node.js to be used with the ChakraCore JavaScript engine. Arunesh Chandra will also discuss the progress of this work in his presentation. These initial efforts are stepping stones to make Node.js VM-neutral, which would allow more opportunities for Node.js in IoT and mobile use cases as well as a variety of different systems. NAPI: Creating a Stable API for the Module Ecosystem The Node.js module community is massive with more than a billion weekly package downloads. The initial work from the Node.js API group is focused on making module maintainers’ lives easier by defining a stable module API that is independent from changes in V8 and allowing modules to run against newer version of Node.js without recompilation. These initiatives will also drastically help the experience of those using Node.js as they will have more modules to choose from and more stability with modules without the need to continually upgrade. This will all result in more choice and a more vibrant ecosystem to drive future innovation. “This work on the Node API is exciting for the community because it will lead to greater stability in the module ecosystem due to independence from Node.js version changes, giving the developer greater flexibility as new Node.js versions are introduced,” said Michael Dawson, runtime developer at IBM, “Furthermore, this enhancement is a concrete step toward the strategic end goal of VM neutrality. Together these provide significant value and expanded choice to the enterprise by allowing them to more easily leverage the broad range of capabilities available through the module ecosystem.” “A large part of the Foundation’s work is focused on improving versatility and confidence in Node.js,” said Mikeal Rogers, community manager of the Node.js Foundation. “Node.js API efforts support our mission of spreading Node.js to as many different environments as possible. This is the beginning of a big community web project that will give VMs the same type of competition and innovation that you see within the browser space.” A more detailed roadmap for the work on the Node.js API is available here . We encourage you to be a part of this project by experimenting with this new API, testing it with your environments and reporting back any fixes or improvements you need. Node.js and ChakraCore The Node.js build system will start producing nightly node-chakracore builds, enabling Node.js to be used with the ChakraCore JavaScript engine. “Allowing Node.js to work on multiple engines enables Node.js to run on a variety of different systems in a highly optimized way — including the IoT systems,” said Arunesh Chandra, senior program manager for ChakraCore at Microsoft. “We are working closely with the open source community and contributors from many companies, and believe this collaboration allows for more innovation and creates more choice for Node.js developers, which will spur new use cases in the future.” “Huge strides have been made in improving the technical state of how Node.js interacts and manages expectations with the underlying JavaScript VM,” said Dan Shaw, CTO and Co-Founder of NodeSource. “The fully open source nature of ChakraCore makes testing new features extremely easy. We look forward to continuing our efforts with both of these initiatives.” Node-ChakraCore also is continuing to improve debugging in Node.js with Time-Travel debugging, which allows developers to easily capture traces for post mortem debugging and step back in time using a supported debugger. All of these technologies and topics will also be discussed during Arunesh’s presentation. More information can be found here on Microsoft’s blog. What is VM Neutrality? What is the benefit of VM Neutrality? VM neutrality describes a state of Node.js where Node Core is neutral to the JS Engine that is powering it via open standards and open APIs. The idea is to create a more formal interface between Node.js and its VM. In a VM-neutral world, the Node.js ecosystem, especially the native modules, continues to seamlessly work on different JS VMs on a variety of different devices and workloads. With VM neutrality, Node.js will be able take advantage of new devices and workloads; give developers the ability to extend the reach of the Node.js ecosystem, so they can reuse code to target more devices and workloads; and standardize multi-VM efforts from already existing forks. Boost to Node.js As The Platform for IoT IoT is a high-growth market with the spend growing from $591.7 billion in 2014 to $1.3 trillion in 2019. The install base of IoT endpoints is expected to grow to more than 25.6 billion in 2019, hitting 30 billion in 2020, according to Verizon’s recent Internet of Things report . Node.js has increasingly become the platform of choice for IoT applications and embedded devices, and VM neutrality will encourage even more Node.js growth in this area, according to Rogers. With many VM vendors optimized for different hardware profiles, Node.js will be able to extend to various VM platforms giving JavaScript and Node.js users alike the flexibility to use this language and platform anywhere and everywhere. Developers will also be able to use the smaller, focused runtime of Node.js without a full VM, which will drastically improve performance in this environment. VM Neutrality To Benefit Mobile App Developers Once Node.js is untethered from a specific VM, developers will be able to pair it with different VMs for the particular needs of mobile applications, extending the benefits of Node.js (ease of use, higher density coding, performance) to more mobile app developers. How Can I Get Involved? If you want to get more involved with the Node.js API efforts, please: Convert a native module to use ABI stable APIs and report issues on conversion and performance; Port ABI stable APIs to your fork of Node and let us know if there are gaps; Review the roadmap and see how can you can help accelerate this project.

      "text": "\nDespite a slight increase in market share for it’s latest operating system, Microsoft can’t seem to replicate that level of success with it’s Edge browser. Despite browser improvements with the release of Windows 10 Anniversary update , including extension support, “Paste and Go”, and swipe to go back and forward, Edge still seems incapable of catching on for the average user.\nFor the month of November, Edge had only 5.21% of the browser market share, down from 5.26% from the previous month. Microsoft Edge came in fourth place behind Google’s Chrome browser, which had 55.83%, Microsoft’s other, now unsupported browser Internet Explorer, with 21.66%, and Mozilla’s Firefox browser, with 11.91%. Trailing Microsoft Edge was only Apple’s Safari browser, with 3.61%, and Opera with 1.36%.\n\nIt seems that IE is actually doing better, since it has the advantage of being able to be installed on multiple different versions of Windows, while Edge is exclusively available on Windows 10, with no plans to actually bring it to other platforms. Ever since Microsoft announced that it would no longer provide support for IE , users have been migrating to other readily available browsers, and Google’s Chrome browser has benefited the most from this. Right now, Chrome is installed on over half the world’s PCs, this according to Netmarketshare .\nMicrosoft is looking to change its luck with the new Creators Update , which should being even more features to Edge, including a tab browser option, a session manager, as well as 3D support. Couple that with some stability improvements and Microsoft may actually be competing in the browser market in no time.",

      "title": "Microsoft Surface Pro 5 rumors: Thunderbolt 3, Kaby Lake and more",
      "text": "  New rumors surfaced recently that suggest, that the successor to the Surface Pro 4 by Microsoft might receive some welcome enhancements in many aspects of the device. Lets start with the processor. Instead of the trusted Skylake CPU's Microsoft will upgrade the Surface Pro 5 to Intel Kaby Lake processors. We are also expecting the next version of the surface tablet to come with at least 512 GB of storage as standard. A lot of users will be happy to hear that Microsoft is said to finally integrate a USB-C port with full Thunderbolt 3 functionality. Instead of featuring a replaceable battery, the Surface Pen might charge wirelessly next time around. We are unsure if Microsoft will increase display resolution because that might impact battery life, which is said to be better on the Surface Pro 5 compared to its predecessor. However, we are hearing rumors, that Microsoft might put a patent to good use, that holds the key to integrating a fingerprint sensor under the display for a seamless Windows Hello login procedure. Microsoft is expected to introduce the Surface Pro 5 in Spring of 2017 after the release of the Windows 10 Creators Update.  ",

      "text": "Home Technology Microsoft Surface Phone, Windows 10 Pro 5, Studio Could Be Shipping Through Amazon Microsoft Surface Phone, Windows 10 Pro 5, Studio Could Be Shipping Through Amazon 2 \nThe Microsoft Surface Phone news is determined to be the ultimate mobile device, which people are waiting to preorder. With Windows, Pro 5 and Microsoft Studio, the company is heading into a direction that will make its products hot, and some skeptics say Amazon might be the way to order the Surface Phone once a shipping date has been announced. \nIt’s been a depressing year for many Windows 10 Mobile fans, with our dreams of a new frontier of W10M hardware being shot down at every turn. \nThis week’s events, however, give us reason to hope again. In an interview with the Australian Financial Review, Satya Nadella said “We will continue to be in the phone market not as defined by today’s market leaders, but by what it is that we can uniquely do in what is the most ultimate mobile device.” This could mean a million different things, but news later in the week has us excited about its implications. \nPossible Microsoft Surface Phone specs leak \nThis is what got us buzzing about what seemed to be a passing comment from Satya Nadella. Not long after that interview, we got information about the possible specifications of the Surface Phone. \nIf the leak is to be believed, we’re looking at a Snapdragon 835 processor, 6 GB of RAM, and a 5.5 inch display. This is all supposedly from prototypes, though, so we wouldn’t put too much stock in the specifics. The leak tells us that the Surface Phone is slated for a late 2017 release, looking to line up with Redstone 3. \nMicrosoft looks to implement new “NEON” design language with Redstone 3 \nHere’s one that Windows 10 Mobile users across all devices can get excited about. NEON seems like it’s going to be Microsoft’s new design language, giving Windows 10 a fresh new look. \nThe project is being referred to in some circles as “Metro 2.0,” because it’s going to be trying to accomplish the same sort of interface revolution that Metro accomplished. \nWe don’t know much about how NEON is going to behave, but we do know that it’s supposedly very fluid, and focuses greatly on animation as a key point. Whether or not NEON is an internal codename or the shipping name for the feature is yet to be seen. \nShare improvements coming soon to Insider builds \nThere are plenty of people who seem to have problems with Windows 10’s limitations to sharing. One disgruntled Twitter user went to Twitter to complain, and got a response from Microsoft’s Peter Skillman saying that “Share improvements [are] coming to WIP builds soon.” \nWe don’t have any specifics about what these improvements are going to be, or how significant they’re going to be, but hopefully they address some of the issues people are complaining about. \nThanks for joining us. If you want all of the news as it happens, keep an eye on our Windows 10 Mobile articles.",

      "text": "Home Technology Microsoft AI Features In Word, PowerPoint, Office Apps Microsoft AI Features In Word, PowerPoint, Office Apps John Lester Dec 03, 2016 Technology Comments Off on Microsoft AI Features In Word, PowerPoint, Office Apps 1 \nMicrosoft is doing some innovative features for most of its software by adding Artificial Intelligence (AI) in Office apps like Word and PowerPoint to be “digital assistants.” \nFor example, the feature will automatically suggest image and slide deck captions, called alt-text, using AI algorithms. That way, when those files are presented to blind users, computer tools designed to translate the information onscreen into audio have text descriptions to work with. \nThe idea sounds crazy, but it’s very useful, especially people with disabilities. \nMicrosoft is accomplishing this feat with its Computer Vision Cognitive Service, which uses neural networks trained with deep learning techniques to better understand and describe the contents of images. \n“We will offer you automatic suggestions for alt-text when you insert a photographic image that can be recognized with high confidence,” writes the Office 365 team in a blog post. “Through machine learning, this service will keep improving as more people use it, saving you significant time to make media-rich presentations accessible.” \nFacebook also announced a similar feature for photo captions back in April, and much of the tech industry is using these AI techniques to both improve accessibility and better parse images and videos for valuable data. \nThe AI feature will be available in Office and PowerPoint on PC starting next year for Office 365 subscribers. \nMicrosoft also says it will be releasing accessible templates that for Office apps that are “structured to ensure ease of navigation with a screen reader and keyboard and use fonts and colors that are easy to read with low vision or color blindness.” \nFor those who choose to customize their documents or slide decks, Microsoft says it has released an accessibility checker for Office PC apps that will review the file and fix any issues that make it difficult for users with disabilities to access the information. \nMicrosoft and Facebook continues to adopt new technologies that will change the way people use their products.",

      "text": "Home Technology Microsoft Surface Phone, Windows Surface Phone Pro 5 Has Bigger Screen Microsoft Surface Phone, Windows Surface Phone Pro 5 Has Bigger Screen \nThere’s been a lot of information being said about Microsoft’s latest Surface Phone \nProtos Display Size, processor, RAM, OS emerge from our sources. A bit of information about the latest Surface Phone photos emerge from our trusted sources yet again. There are more than one Surface Phone protos in testing at Microsoft and here is what we have learned, \nSurface Phone Specs & features: The protos that we have information about run Snapdragon 835 and support Quick charging 4.0 Windows 10 Mobile architecture on them is already 64-Bit and one of them has 6 GB RAM What is most interesting is the information that the one proto with 6 GB RAM can already run X86 apps in Continuum. We have heard a lot about Microsoft working on X86-on-ARM64 emulation and this may be one of the implementations. Sources however tell us that Protos can’t run X86 apps by themselves yet, but can install them. Once connected via Continuum you can run any X86 apps. The earlier reported Laptop Accessory is still a thing and we hear Microsoft is seriously purusing the 3-in-1 form factor. One of the Protos is said to have 4 GB RAM and still runs Snapdragon 835. It does have 64-Bit Windows 10 Mobile version but can’t run X86 apps in Continuum. That may be just a version thing or Microsoft may be planing one consumer and one enterprise-oriented Surface Phone variant. Display-size wise we hear both are said to have a 5.5-inch, QHD display, but this is just a guess having a look at the display and not actual measurement. \nRedstone 3 and Release Date: Protos of-course run a Windows 10 Mobile version from different branch. Redstone 3 will be relatively much bigger update than Redstone 2. For Redstone 3 development cycle Windows team is prioritizing Mobile as Windows 10 development target. Our sources have confirmed that Surface Phone launch is delayed now to late 2017. It will now come running Windows 10 Mobile focused Redstone 3 out of the box. \nThis info comes from one of our trusted sources with good accuracy. But Companies have been known to launch different configurations than seen on protos in retail products. Also features vary with OS versions and final release OS version may or may not have all the features seen in protos.",

      "text": "Microsoft hopes your Windows PC can replace an Amazon Echo A leaked Home Hub feature would let a shared computer stand in for smart speakers. Share Save \nIf rumors are true , Microsoft may be one of the few major consumer tech giants that doesn't have a smart, voice-guided speaker in the works... but that doesn't mean it's sitting on its thumbs. In an expansion of recent code discoveries , Windows Central sources claim that Windows 10 is getting a Home Hub feature that will turn supporting PCs into rivals for the Amazon Echo and Google Home . You'd have a shared, login-free desktop that shares family resources like calendars and shopping lists, and a smart home app that would make it easy to control all your connected devices. And as you might surmise, the Cortana voice assistant would play a much, much more important role. \nUnder Home Hub, Cortana would have access to both shared content as well as that of individual users who are signed in. That would tackle one of the biggest issues with devices like Google Home -- that they're frequently limited to supporting a single user's account. Supporting PCs would also be much more Cortana-friendly. You could use voice commands from a greater distance, and wake up the PC with voice alone. Home Hub-ready systems could even tout light and motion sensors to wake up whenever someone enters the room. \nProvided the leak is accurate, it could be a while before you see every element of Home Hub. It's reportedly scheduled to arrive through three significant Windows 10 updates (nicknamed Redstone 2, 3 and 4) that would start arriving in 2017. And if you want a PC designed for the feature from the ground up, you may have to wait until the very end of the year. Microsoft is said to be asking vendors (including HP and Lenovo) to step up with Home Hub-optimized all-in-one PCs in late 2017. \nThere's no certainty that everything will pan out as planned. WC is quick to warn that delays and cancellations could change features and timelines, assuming Home Hub ships at all. However, it's easy to see the incentive for Microsoft to make this a reality. In some ways, Echo-like speakers reduce the need for a family computer -- you can't do your homework through a speaker, but you can accomplish tasks that would normally require breaking out your phone or sitting at a desk. Home Hub would keep the PC relevant for homes where a shared machine makes sense, and might even provide an edge over smart speakers by offering the visual, multi-user info that you don't get right now .

      "text": "up vote 3 down vote favorite \nSo I've been attempting to use Microsoft Deployment Toolkit with Windows Deployment Services to deploy images on a client. The deployment server is running Server 2012 and is both the Domain Controller and the deployment server. I am able to import Windows 7 enterprise, office 2013, some drivers, etc. Then I added a task sequence according to this article: \nhttp://prajwaldesai.com/deploying-windows-7-using-microsoft-deployment-toolkit-part-1/ \nMost of the process of setting up the deployment share was either the same or very similar to that article. \nNow, when I PXE boot to the right image on the deployment share, I get a prompt to login, etc. Eventually I come to a task sequence page, where, in order to continue, I must select a task sequence to execute. Only no task sequences appear. I checked back in MDT, and the task sequence is there and enabled. The task is supposed to format the hard drive and install windows 7. \nSo I was wondering, as I am still quite new and inexperienced with MDT+WAIK+WDS, is this task sequence supposed to be hidden? \nI read a few forum threads about task sequences which had previously been visible suddenly dissapearing, but that doesn't seem to describe my problem. \nAlso, I tried deleting the task sequence and creating a new one, but the same issue occured. I also noticed that the Task Sequence ID of 001 was no longer available. Are these IDs only one-time uses per deployment share? \nThis domain is a small cluster of computers set up specifically to test this deployment solution to see if it would be appropriate to implement for the entire lab, so any other solutions which might be appropriate would be appreciated. The goal is to deploy images of windows 7 with standard applications. Every year this image is rebuilt with updated applications and re-captured using Ghost, which we are trying to ditch. Being able to re-create the image using MDT would make things a lot easier, and would increase flexibility if, for example, I had to add an application in after the image has been deployed. \nSo another update, I apologize, but I keep hitting my head against the wall trying to figure this out. \nI still am unable to see the Install OS Task Sequence when I PXE boot the client. In MDT I have 4 task sequences, each performing a specific function. It seems like I can see any task sequence which does not deploy an OS. So I have a sequence which wipes the disk, installs windows, installs office, and then syspreps and captures the image. Only I am unable to run the OS Deployment TS in the LTI image. Everything I am running is 64 bit, so I do not believe architecture mismatch is the problem, and in MDT the TSs are enabled and visible. Deployment share is updated and is unrestricted in terms of permissions. The client now has a completely empty, unformatted hard drive. Does anyone know why this task sequence won't show up? \nIn MDT under the components tab WAIK still isn't listed under \"Installed\", but it is listed under \"Downloaded\". I have reinstalled, refreshed, rebooted, etc. But WAIK still doesn't seem to want to be listed as Installed. I googled this, and several other users have this issue, but MDT still seems to work fine, so I'm not convinced that's the problem, or if it is, its not all of the problem. \nAgain, I really do appreciate the help.",

      "text": "Microsoft offers IIT grads ₹70 lakh a year mumbai Updated: Dec 02, 2016 11:33 IST Musab Qazi Hindustan Times According to sources, pay packages offered by companies like Goldman Sachs ranged from Rs 25 to 30 lakhs, while Blackstone offered around Rs35 lakh. (HT File Photo) \nWorld information technology giant Microsoft and financial services firms, Blackstone and Goldman Sachs, offered some of the highest salary packages during the first slot on the first day of placements at the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay (IIT-B). \nThe day-time slot, which stretched till 6pm instead of the scheduled 4pm, saw seventeen companies making around 60 job offers, at the time of going to the press. Microsoft selected five candidates and offered jobs based in the US as well as within the country. Sources confirmed that the pay packages offered for the US-based job profiles ranged between Rs70-80 lakh a year but it’s not clear if the amount was only the base salary. \nAccording to sources, pay packages offered by companies like Goldman Sachs ranged from Rs 25 to 30 lakhs, while Blackstone offered around Rs35 lakh. While the former reportedly selected seven students, the latter made two offers. \nThe first day was dominated by companies from the engineering and financial sector. Most of the companies offered base salaries to the tune of Rs 14-15 lakh, in addition to joining bonuses and other benefits. The ITC group, which is said to have selected three students, offered a package of Rs 17 lakh and Rs 2 lakh as joining bonus. Other notable companies to offer jobs during the first slot include Google, public sector company Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) and Procter and Gamble (P&G), which made one, six and three offers, respectively. App-based aggregator Uber, which made its IIT debut this year, was slated for the night slot. \nThe first phase of placements will go on till December 15 and will be attended by more than 300 companies this year. \nRead ",

      "title": "Customers took a stand against Windows 10’s aggressive upgrades – and won",
      "text": "Jesse Worley threatened to sue Microsoft. He’s not the first to take on the Redmond company, but his move to take legal action had a purpose. He wanted Microsoft to acknowledge that aggressively pushing the Windows 10 update was a problem. Customers weary of the Windows 8 disaster were unwilling to take the upgrade leap; Microsoft was, he reasoned, ignoring their fear of heights.\nWorley built a Windows 7 machine for his grandfather, who has Alzheimer’s Disease, in 2013. Because of this, Worley customized the machine to look like Windows XP, an operating system his grandfather still remembered well. Since Windows 7 will still receive patches until 2020, he wanted to keep the machine on Windows 7 until he got around to building a PC with Windows 10, using the fake Windows XP interface.\nBut thanks to Microsoft’s persistent Windows 10 upgrade program, Worley’s grandfather unknowingly initiated the Win 10 upgrade by clicking the “X” to close an upgrade window – which gave permission by not explicitly refuting the update. For the last 21 years, that X has been used to close programs in Windows. Microsoft chose to change that function.\nIt didn’t turn out well.\nA surprising upgrade “Surely I’m not the only one to face surprise updates, or to spend time and money fixing them,” Worley said in email correspondence with Digital Trends. “Microsoft’s culpability most certainly isn’t limited to those suffering from Alzheimer’s Disease or their families either. I’m not a litigious person, and one of the things I dislike most are people taking a sort of perverse profit from the suffering of others.”\n“I’m an IT tech whose grandfather’s computer was updated through subterfuge, which made life harder for him and his caretakers until it was fixed.”\nWith Windows 10, Microsoft fixed the mistakes made in Windows 8 by bringing the desktop interface back to the forefront, while retaining the app-based structure. The result is a combined environment with the benefits of a tablet-like experience spicing up the desktop we’ve come to rely on for decades.\nIt’s a great operating system, but Windows 10 is not without issue. Privacy advocates dislike it, as Microsoft collects data such as voice input, text input, website history, and more. There are ways to limit the personal information Microsoft receives, but these steps likely aren’t known by the average Joe. The growing privacy concerns have called out security experts, the Electronic Frontier Foundation , and even France’s National Data Protection Commission.\nIs this data-mining the fuel that powered Microsoft’s aggressive Windows 10 upgrade program?\nMore: How to use Windows 10 without giving up your privacy\n“The tactics Microsoft employed to get users of earlier versions of Windows to upgrade to Windows 10 went from annoying to downright malicious,” the EFF said in August. “Some highlights: Microsoft installed an app in users’ system trays advertising the free upgrade to Windows 10. The app couldn’t be easily hidden or removed, but some enterprising users figured out a way. Then, the company kept changing the app and bundling it into various security patches, creating a cat-and-mouse game to uninstall it.”\nChange isn’t always for the best Aside from the privacy issues, many people simply don’t want to jump on the Windows 10 bandwagon. Most holdouts rely on Windows 7, which is currently the most-used operating system on the market. Many don’t like the Windows Store, Cortana, or the tweaked Start Menu. Others simply need their PC to function the same as it always has, for various reasons.\nFor Jesse Worley and his grandfather, a familiar OS was a must-have. The change from a simulated Windows XP environment to Windows 10 was disrupting, and cost time and money to undo the damage. As Worley pointed out in his email, he’s likely not the only one who suffered from Microsoft’s seemingly malicious upgrade scheme.\nJesse Worley More Jesse Worley\n“I’m just the IT tech, so I fought my fight,” he said. “I don’t want to say that because my grandparents suffered, now I understand personally how someone with Alzheimer’s Disease — or bad eyesight, or a small monitor, or who was conditioned to repeatedly press ‘no’ to the GWX popup, or any of a million other reasons for not clicking the fine print in GWX and de-scheduling the update — personally suffered.”\nWhen he threatened Microsoft over the Windows 10 upgrade, he wrote the company a letter of his intent as requested in Microsoft’s EULA for Windows 10, which states that “we hope you’ll mail a Notice of Dispute and give us 60 days to try to work it out, but you don’t have to before going to small claims court.” (The company even provides a Notice of Dispute form .)\nSurprisingly, Microsoft has admitted that the upgrade pop-up window was misleading, and customers who faced the Windows 10 upgrade beast and failed can strike back. Worley did so and received $650. He wanted Microsoft to pay him for his time and donate to any Alzheimer’s charity, but the company only agreed to pay for his time, given that Microsoft donates to charities already.\nWorley took the money and donated it to alz.org .\nCustomers should come together Ultimately, Worley hopes people impacted by the forced Windows 10 upgrade will write a complaint to Microsoft demanding a settlement for their wasted time and money in repairing the device. He wants Microsoft to vow it will never use an aggressive promotion again, and for the victims to donate their rewards to Alzheimer’s research if they don’t need the money “in case Microsoft doesn’t take the hint.”\n“I want those people to fight their fight,” he said. “I know they can win those fights. Some of them are big fights that cost a lot of money, and some, like mine, are little fights worth less money.”\nWorley isn’t the only individual who has gone after Microsoft over its Windows 10 upgrade tactics. California travel agent Teri Goldstein sued Microsoft in small claims court in June and won $10,000. She didn’t authorize the update, and the install failed. After that her computer, which she uses to manage her business, was unusable. Microsoft couldn’t fix the PC, so she went to small claims court instead.\nMore: Will privacy concerns drive Windows customers to the Mac?\nMicrosoft appealed the court’s decision, which compensated Goldstein for replacing the PC and lost wages. But the company reportedly dropped its appeal so it wouldn’t have the expense of continuing the litigation. The whole story can be read in Goldstein’s ebook “ Winning Against Windows 10 : How I Fought Microsoft and Won.”\n“Teri and I both believe that legislation which criminalizes software companies that use aggressive or misleading tactics to trick their own users into dangerous updates is necessary,” Worley said. “While we might take separate approaches toward accomplishing that shared goal in California and Texas, we know that this fight would be significantly easier with Microsoft reps at the table as opposed to sticking their fingers in their ears and writing checks against their ethical shortcomings.”\nUpdates are a part of software, and they usually result in better, more stable, more secure software. But companies should be upfront with them rather than slipping updates in on the sly. Microsoft’s efforts to force upgrades to Windows 10 shows that aggressive updates can indeed go too far, and is a rare example of users getting relief for a PC that suddenly breaks – through no fault of their own.\nFord’s 2017 F-150 gets a slight fuel economy boost with new 10-speed automatic Man sets out to sue Microsoft over Windows 10 upgrade nag screen, gets some cash",

      "text": "Latin American grads say Google is the dream Top students seek jobs at Google, Microsoft Posted: Dec 03, 2016 07:58 PM EST Updated: Dec 03, 2016 07:58 PM EST No more US flag at Hampshire College \nNEW YORK (CNNMoney) - The dream for Latin America's top students: Snag a job at Google or Microsoft. \nA survey of business and engineering students conducted by Universum, a research and consulting firm, found Google to be the most attractive employer for both majors. Microsoft came in second. \nThese results aren't surprising -- Google also topped Universum's annual survey of grads in Europe and Asia. \n\"Google and Microsoft are basically popular around the world,\" said Andre Valias Siqueira, the director of Latin America at Universum. \"They really communicate and they show their value.\" \nThat value is expressed by promoting innovation and flexibility at work, Siqueira said. \nCompanies that sell consumer goods, such as Coca-Cola, Unilever and L'Oréal, are also very popular among business students in the region. They far outrank consulting companies such as McKinsey & Company, which is the third most coveted employer among Asian business students. \n\"I see the consumer industry invest strategically in Latin America,\" Siqueira said. \nSpain's Santander is the only bank to make the top 10 list for business students. But that's not because Latin American graduates are eschewing financial institutions, Siqueira said. \nA full 40% of business graduates said their preferred industry was banking and financial services. They just prefer local banks, which don't always show up in regional survey results, Siqueira said. \nJ.P. Morgan is the only U.S. bank listed among the top 30 preferred employers for business students. \nMore broadly, Latin American graduates said they prioritize opportunities for professional training and development when looking for work. \n\"We've seen a lot of change and a lot of volatility in different countries in Latin America, and that's reflected in the desire for future success,\" said Kat Lynn, a Universum spokeswoman. \"The students in the region are invested in building a career for their futures.\" \nDISCLAIMER FOR COMMENTS: The views expressed by public comments are not those of this company or its affiliated companies.

Presented by Microsoft at its hardware event in October, the 3D Builder app on Windows phones allows users to design and print a 3D object only with a mobile device, and comes with a few options that make the whole process a lot more convenient. First and foremost, 3D Builder on Windows phones makes it possible for users to scan an object and create a 3D replica using the mobile device’s camera. This means that you only need to take a few shots of the object that you want to re-create in 3D and the app takes care of everything, including processing of the photos. 3D printing support",

      "title": "Windows 10 Creators Update: Symlinks without elevation",
      "text": "Microsoft announced a change in Windows 10's most recent Insider Build recently that improves the handling of symlinks -- symbolic links -- on Windows 10.\nSymbolic links have been part of Windows since Vista, and are a mighty useful feature of the operating system.\nA symbolic link can best be described as a pointer that redirects to another file or folder. They are used by the operating system, may be used by applications, and may also be added and managed manually by users.\nOne basic example: Say your main hard drive is filling up with files and you have little space left. While you could go ahead and uninstall some programs or games to free up space -- after running various clean-up operations -- you could make use of symbolic links instead.\nSo, instead of uninstalling the game or program, you would make use of symbolic links to move it to another hard drive. Symbolic links would point to the new location from the old, and for Windows and all programs involved, the program or game would still reside in the original directory.\nTip : You can display the symbolic links on your Windows machine with NTFS Links View . Interested in how Linux handles links? Here you go .\nSymlinks without elevation \nSymbolic links are created on Windows using mklink , a command line tool. Developers have created various programs, many with a graphical user interface, to improve the usability and functionality.\nThere is Junction by SysInternals for instance, or Link Shell Extension which can be used right from Windows Explorer.\nUp until now, mklink required Windows users to run the command from an elevated command prompt. According to Microsoft, this requirement caused symbolic links to be used less frequently on Windows than on *nix machines. It had the effect that \"many modern cross-platform development tools\" worked \"less efficiently and reliably on Windows\".\nStarting with the Windows 10 Insider Build 14972, and coming to all users in March 2017 when the Windows 10 Creators Update is released, this requirement is no longer set in stone.\nYou need to enable Developer Mode on the Windows 10 machine, and if you do, any user on the machine may run mklink without elevation to create and change symbolic links.\nThe main drive for the change was the rise of development tools like git or package managers like npm which support and use symlinks.\nMany popular development tools like git and package managers like npm recognize and persist symlinks when creating repos or packages, respectively. When those repos or packages are then restored elsewhere, the symlinks are also restored, ensuring disk space (and the user’s time) isn’t wasted.\nEnable Developer Mode \nDo the following to enable Developer Mode on the Windows 10 machine:\nUse the shortcut Windows-I to open the Settings application. Navigate to Update & Security > For Developers. Switch from \"Windows Store apps\" to \"Developer Mode\" on the screen. Now You : Do you make use of symbolic links?\nGhacks needs you.
