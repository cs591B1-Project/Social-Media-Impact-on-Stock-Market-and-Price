      "text": "Apple said to fly drones to improve maps data and catch Google [video]   1:30 PM Mark Gurman, Alan Levin - Bloomberg \nApple plans to use drones and new indoor navigation features to improve its Maps service and catch longtime leader Google, according to people familiar with the matter. \nThe Cupertino, California-based company is assembling a team of robotics and data-collection experts that will use drones to capture and update map information faster than its existing fleet of camera-and-sensor ladened minivans, one of the people said. \nApple wants to fly drones around to do things like examine street signs, track changes to roads and monitor if areas are under construction, the person said. The data collected would be sent to Apple teams that rapidly update the Maps app to provide fresh information to users, the person added. \nApple is also developing new features for Maps, including views inside buildings and improvements to car navigation, another person familiar with the efforts said. The people asked not to be identified talking about private projects. An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment. \nFive years after Google Maps launched on the iPhone, Apple's mapping app was introduced in 2012 with glaring errors like a grocery store marked as a hospital and an incorrect airport address. Apple lacked the technology needed to quickly suck in data from many different sources to evaluate and change the digital maps. \n\"There's a huge data-quality issue there, and I don't think we initially appreciated all the kinds of technology we would need to do that on an ongoing basis,\" Craig Federighi, Apple's senior vice president of software engineering, told Fast Company earlier this year. \nDigital maps are crucial tools for Apple and Google to attract developers that build popular travel, ride-sharing, and retail apps and services that integrate with the companies' mobile operating systems. Collecting accurate data is the most important part of digital map building and Apple's latest moves could help it match the prodigious capabilities of Google in this field. \nSince Apple Maps launched, the company has improved the app by more quickly updating data, adding a mode for navigating public transit systems, improving search results, and opening the platform to outside services such as Uber ride-hailing and OpenTable restaurant reservations. The drone initiative is a continuation of this effort and is unlikely to be related to a commercial Apple drone product. \nApple filed for an exemption on Sept. 21, 2015, from the Federal Aviation Administration to fly drones for commercial purposes, according to documents obtained by Bloomberg News. At that time, exemptions were required to commercially operate drones. In a response dated March 22, 2016, the FAA granted Apple approval to \"operate an unmanned aircraft system to conduct data collection, photography, and videography,\" according to one of the documents. \nApple's application told the FAA that it would use a range of drones sold by companies such as SZ DJI Technology Co. and Aibotix to collect the data. \nOfficial guidelines for commercial drone operation were instated in August, restricting flying to mostly daytime hours and requiring licensed pilots to operate the equipment while keeping the drones in their line of sight. Apple committed to these guidelines, according to the FAA documents. \nThe current rules restrict commercial drones from flying over people and buildings, potentially limiting Apple's initiative for the time being. Apple could meanwhile fly the drones in the U.S. within FAA guidelines and fly without restriction in countries without commercial drone regulations. \nApple has hired at least one person from Amazon.com Inc.'s Prime Air division to help run the drone team, one of the people said. Prime Air is Amazon's initiative to quickly deliver packages via drones. The Apple team is being assembled in Seattle, the same city as Amazon's headquarters, the person said. \nBeyond better data collection, Apple is developing an indoor mapping view that would allow users to navigate airports, and other high-traffic buildings like museums using iPhones, according to another person. \nApple acquired startup Indoor.io last year to help bring its indoor mapping project to market, according to another person familiar with the matter. Apple confirmed the purchase, but declined to say why it did the deal. The company also bought WiFiSlam in 2013, another startup with indoor navigation expertise. \nIndoor location tracking is achieved via a combination of technologies inside the latest iPhones, including pressure sensors, GPS, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth. Apple is also working on a feature that provides better guidance for changing lanes while driving, one of the people said. Both features are planned for release next year but could be held back, the person said. \n---",

      "text": "Photo Illustration by Monica Nickelsburg, GeekWire, original photo by Dan Hershman, via Flickr. Apple is doubling down on its Maps app , assembling a team of robotics and data-collection experts to quickly update conditions using drones and add new features. And that team will be based in Seattle, according to a report from Bloomberg. \nGeekWire found several listings on Apple’s jobs site for software engineers focused on maps in Seattle, as well as one for a GIS analyst. Bloomberg reports that Apple has already hired away at least one person from Amazon’s Prime Air drone delivery team to help run its drone projects.\nApple will use drones to document changes to roads, such as construction projects, and increase the speed of map updates. Today, the company uses a fleet of sensor-equipped mini-vans to capture conditions.\nApple is also reportedly working on adding new Maps capabilities, including views from inside buildings and navigation improvements. All these moves are part of an attempt to catch up with maps leader Google.\nApple filed for an exemption with the Federal Aviation Administration last year to fly commercial drones, Bloomberg reports. FAA granted that exemption, Bloomberg reported, but new regulations on drone flights could slow Apple’s mapping ambitions. Among the new rules are restrictions on flying near people and buildings. That would preclude most flights within cities, though the FAA has said most of the rules can be waived through an application process “if the applicant demonstrates that his or her operation can safely be conducted under the terms of a certificate of waiver.”\nApple launched its Maps app in 2012, but it wasn’t up to snuff out of the gate. Things started so bad that Apple CEO Tim Cook publicly apologized for the app’s shortcomings — including geographical errors, glitchy rendering and a lack of transit maps — saying the company “fell short” on its commitment to deliver the best user experience to its customers. But Apple has quietly improved its Maps app over the years, adding transit mapping in many cities and other features.\nApple has increased its presence in Seattle after quietly opening an engineering center in Seattle in 2014. A year later, Apple inked a lease for two floors in a downtown Seattle office tower with room to grow.\nApple may be getting ready to ramp up its influence here in Seattle. Rumors flew over the summer that Apple was looking for a big chunk of office space , and it made a big acquisition in August, dropping more than $200 million on Seattle-based machine learning company Turi. Following the acquisition, Apple hinted at plans to base its machine learning division in Seattle.\n ",

      "text": "Apple said to fly drones to improve maps data and catch Google [video]   1:30 PM Mark Gurman, Alan Levin - Bloomberg \nApple plans to use drones and new indoor navigation features to improve its Maps service and catch longtime leader Google, according to people familiar with the matter. \nThe Cupertino, California-based company is assembling a team of robotics and data-collection experts that will use drones to capture and update map information faster than its existing fleet of camera-and-sensor ladened minivans, one of the people said. \nApple wants to fly drones around to do things like examine street signs, track changes to roads and monitor if areas are under construction, the person said. The data collected would be sent to Apple teams that rapidly update the Maps app to provide fresh information to users, the person added. \nApple is also developing new features for Maps, including views inside buildings and improvements to car navigation, another person familiar with the efforts said. The people asked not to be identified talking about private projects. An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment. \nFive years after Google Maps launched on the iPhone, Apple's mapping app was introduced in 2012 with glaring errors like a grocery store marked as a hospital and an incorrect airport address. Apple lacked the technology needed to quickly suck in data from many different sources to evaluate and change the digital maps. \n\"There's a huge data-quality issue there, and I don't think we initially appreciated all the kinds of technology we would need to do that on an ongoing basis,\" Craig Federighi, Apple's senior vice president of software engineering, told Fast Company earlier this year. \nDigital maps are crucial tools for Apple and Google to attract developers that build popular travel, ride-sharing, and retail apps and services that integrate with the companies' mobile operating systems. Collecting accurate data is the most important part of digital map building and Apple's latest moves could help it match the prodigious capabilities of Google in this field. \nSince Apple Maps launched, the company has improved the app by more quickly updating data, adding a mode for navigating public transit systems, improving search results, and opening the platform to outside services such as Uber ride-hailing and OpenTable restaurant reservations. The drone initiative is a continuation of this effort and is unlikely to be related to a commercial Apple drone product. \nApple filed for an exemption on Sept. 21, 2015, from the Federal Aviation Administration to fly drones for commercial purposes, according to documents obtained by Bloomberg News. At that time, exemptions were required to commercially operate drones. In a response dated March 22, 2016, the FAA granted Apple approval to \"operate an unmanned aircraft system to conduct data collection, photography, and videography,\" according to one of the documents. \nApple's application told the FAA that it would use a range of drones sold by companies such as SZ DJI Technology Co. and Aibotix to collect the data. \nOfficial guidelines for commercial drone operation were instated in August, restricting flying to mostly daytime hours and requiring licensed pilots to operate the equipment while keeping the drones in their line of sight. Apple committed to these guidelines, according to the FAA documents. \nThe current rules restrict commercial drones from flying over people and buildings, potentially limiting Apple's initiative for the time being. Apple could meanwhile fly the drones in the U.S. within FAA guidelines and fly without restriction in countries without commercial drone regulations. \nApple has hired at least one person from Amazon.com Inc.'s Prime Air division to help run the drone team, one of the people said. Prime Air is Amazon's initiative to quickly deliver packages via drones. The Apple team is being assembled in Seattle, the same city as Amazon's headquarters, the person said. \nBeyond better data collection, Apple is developing an indoor mapping view that would allow users to navigate airports, and other high-traffic buildings like museums using iPhones, according to another person. \nApple acquired startup Indoor.io last year to help bring its indoor mapping project to market, according to another person familiar with the matter. Apple confirmed the purchase, but declined to say why it did the deal. The company also bought WiFiSlam in 2013, another startup with indoor navigation expertise. \nIndoor location tracking is achieved via a combination of technologies inside the latest iPhones, including pressure sensors, GPS, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth. Apple is also working on a feature that provides better guidance for changing lanes while driving, one of the people said. Both features are planned for release next year but could be held back, the person said. \n---",

      "text": "Apple is taking to the skies.\nThe company plans to use drones to collect aerial information to improve its Maps app, Bloomberg reported Dec. 1.\nApple was granted permission to fly drones by the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in March, after applying in Sept. 2015. The company’s original application to the FAA does not go into much detail about what it specifically intended to with its drones, saying just that they would do “aerial data collection, photography, and videography,” but that fits within the mapping ambitions Bloomberg reported today.\nApple’s 2015 application says it intends to use 11 different models of drones—some quadcopters, some fixed-wing drones—to capture information. The list includes three models made by the Chinese market leader DJI—a company referred to as the “ Apple of drones “, one from Intel’s AscTec , and three from French manufacturer Parrot’s commercial subsidiary, senseFly. (Apple sells drones manufactured by DJI and Parrot in its stores , but not of the same mapping caliber.)\nThere is no indication that Apple intends to build its own drones, as other technology giants like Google and Facebook are doing.\nBloomberg points out that Apple, like Google, previously used cars filled with sensors to capture information about roadways for its maps. Sources told the publication that drones could drastically speed up the time it takes to collect data, since they don’t have to follow the rules of the road.\nHowever, the FAA is still working on nailing down rules for letting drones fly over people. For now, that means Apple’s drones will only fly over sparsely populated areas, and must stay below 400 feet.\nIt’s not clear whether Apple has actually started flying yet, or if it’s already flying in another other countries. The company wasn’t immediately available to comment on its activity.\nApple Maps was originally so poorly received that CEO Tim Cook issued an apology in 2012, and may have fired the former head of its mobile operating system division, Scott Forstall over refusing to apologize for the software’s bugs. In years since, Apple has played catch-up to Google Maps, offering additional functions with every new operating system release, and even winning over some critics.\nBut there are few features that Apple Maps offers that Google Maps doesn’t. If Apple can find a novel way to provide information—perhaps by offering virtual flyovers of every city in the US—then it might be able to win more users over, and into its ecosystem.\nApple is selling fewer iPhones than it has in years. Some believe it might make up for this by locking users more deeply into its world of paid apps, videos and services. Whether drones and maps will help remains to be seen. After all, it could end up being just buzz.",

      "text": "up vote 2 down vote favorite \nTL;DR: How do I get the 2560x1600 @60fps resolution from my Apple 30\" Cinema Display? \nEdited : Startech.com confirms the HDMI-to-DVI-D adaptor is dual channel. I don't have enough reputation to give more than 2 links in this, but the product number is HDDVIMF8IN and can be found on amazon.com. \nI recently completed my first build, designed around my Apple 30\" Cinema Display. This uses a DVI-D dual-channel cable, and has an optimal resolution of 2560x1600. Specs here . PartPicker Build Part list here . \nI am using \"trusty\": No LSB modules are available. Distributor ID: Ubuntu Description: Ubuntu 14.04.3 LTS Release: 14.04 Codename: trusty \nMy intention was that the build be able to drive the screen at its optimal resolution of 2560x1600. I was disappointed that I misread the Motherboard specs, and the DVI-I port only drives 1920x1200 @ 60fps. Indeed, using the computer with the DVI-I port only gives 1280x800 resolution. \nHowever, the HDMI ports do drive 2560x1600 @ 60fps. Subseqently, I purchased a Startech.com HDMI to DVI-D video adaptor, with the intention of plugging this into an HDMI port,so that I can get 2560x1600 resolution. \nMy problem: I can't get the screen, connected now with the HDMI-to-DVI cable, to give me any better (or, even different) than 1280x800 @60fps resolution. In this hardware configuration, the hardware doesn't recognize any but the 1280x800 default screen resolution. I've used cvt and xrandr to define 1920x1600 @45 fps resolution (to be safe) and 2560x1600 @ 60fps resolution, and all I get is the screen goes black. \nExample of what I'm inputting: \nrutledge@sekhmet:~$ cvt 1920 1200 \\# 1920x1200 44.91 Hz (CVT) hsync: 55.42 kHz; pclk: 141.00 MHz >Modeline \"1920x1200_45.00\" 141.00 1920 2032 2232 2544 1200 1203 1209 >1234 -hsync +vsync xrandr --newmode \"1920x1200\" 141.00 1920 2032 2232 2544 1200 1203 1209 >1234 -Hsync +Vsync >xrandr --addmode HDMI3 “1920x1200” \nOutput of xrandr is: Screen 0: minimum 8 x 8, current 1280 x 800, maximum 32767 x 32767 HDMI1 disconnected (normal left inverted right x axis y axis) HDMI2 disconnected (normal left inverted right x axis y axis) HDMI3 connected primary 1280x800+0+0 (normal left inverted right x axis y >axis) 641mm x 401mm 1280x800 59.9* 1920x1200 44.9 VGA1 disconnected (normal left inverted right x axis y axis) VIRTUAL1 disconnected (normal left inverted right x axis y axis) \nI can then set display resolution using \"System Settings...Screen Display\",and the screen goes black. Same thing if I do 1920x1200 @ 60fps or 2560x1600 @ 60 fps. \nFinally, I should mention that I placed a .conf file into /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d which contains: Section \"Device\" Identifier \"Configured Video Device\" Option \"AllowDualLinkModes\" EndSection \nSo, does anyone have any insight as to how I can drive this screen at the desired resolution? \nPossible sources of the problem which I can still identify: \nxrandr isn't working properly on my computer \nThere are some default settings which should have been set, but aren't, and I have no idea what they are. \nThank you for your help!",

      "text": "A Must-Try for Fall: Apple Grilled Cheese Sandwich A Must-Try for Fall: Apple Grilled Cheese Sandwich November 29, 2016 Recipes 0 Comments \nWe can’t get over how much this recipe screams autumn. The sweet and tangy apples (bonus points if you’ve picked them !) balance the rich and savory cheddar cheese in this sensational fall-inspired Cheddar Apple Grilled Cheese sandwich. A baby kale salad studded with crunchy pumpkin seeds makes the ideal accompaniment to help offset some of the richness. \nRECIPE TIPS \nThe heat is intensified under the grilled cheese when it’s pressed down, resulting in evenly crisp bread and melty cheese. INGREDIENTS 4 teaspoons Dijon mustard, divided 6 teaspoons mayonnaise 8 ounces shredded white Cheddar cheese, divided 5 ounces baby kale mix ⅓ cup pumpkin seeds 10″ heavy medium pan or plate INSTRUCTIONS Halve lemon. Peel apples. Halve, remove and discard cores, and cut into ½-inch cubes. 2. Make Compote In a small pot over medium-high heat, bring spice mix, juice of 1 lemon, apples, ⅔ cup water, and ¼ teaspoon salt to a boil. Once boiling, cook until liquid is reduced by about half, about 7 minutes. Reduce heat to medium and simmer, breaking up apple with a spoon, until compote is smooth, about 3 minutes more. Remove pot from heat and set aside to cool slightly. 3. Make Dressing While compote cools, in a large bowl, whisk together sugar, Champagne vinegar, ½ packet mustard, ⅛ teaspoon salt and pepper as desired. Whisking continuously, slowly add 2 tablespoons olive oil until fully combined. Set aside. 4. Assemble Grilled Cheese Spread mayonnaise on 1 side of each bread slice. Lay 3 bread slices on a clean, dry surface, mayonnaise-side down, and spread remaining packets mustard evenly over tops. Sprinkle over half of Cheddar, dividing evenly. Spoon apple compote over cheese, then sprinkle remaining Cheddar over compote. Top with remaining bread mayonnaise-side up. 5. Cook Grilled Cheese Add sandwiches to a large nonstick pan over medium heat, working in batches if needed, and place a medium pan or large plate on top, pressing down on sandwiches (see Recipe Tip). Cook until bread is golden and cheese is melted, about 4 minutes per side. 6. Plate Grilled Cheese Add baby kale and pumpkin seeds to bowl with dressing, toss to coat, and divide among 3 plates. Serve with Cheddar apple grilled cheese and share with a fellow cheese lover. To discover even more seasonally inspired  ",

      "title": "Donald Trump Wants Apple to Start Manufacturing in the US",
      "text": "Comment An Apple manufacturing facility in China. Inhabitat. \nWith President-elect Donald Trump's campaign call to \"make America great again,\" he wants Apple to move their manufacturing site from China to the US in the hopes of creating more jobs. Trump has directed his request to long-time Apple CEO Tim Cook. \nTrump is quoted into saying to Cook, \"Tim, you know one of the things that will be a real achievement for me is when I get Apple to build a big plant in the United States, or many big plants in the United States.\" Trump says this in connection with Apple's multibillion-dollar annual revenue and its employment of millions of people around the globe. \nTrump is also willing to offer Apple tax break and reduced regulatory incentives, as long as they are able to move manufacturing back to the US. \nCook replies with acknowledging the request, but has denied giving further public comments. \nThis move may be great for Americans in terms of opening job opportunities, with analysts saying Apple is currently employing 1.6 million people within its supply chain. Apple's products are all assembled in China although it is \"designed by Apple in California\" as all its devices say, and its components are manufactured in China, Japan and Taiwan. \nHowever, it is not as straightforward as it seems. \nSeungjin Whang, a Stanford Business School supply chain management professor, says that the US can never compete with China being the global mainstay of manufacturing and supply. He says that it is so easy to find good suppliers in China that asking for quotations in Shenzhen, China is never a problem. Even with hard-to-find supplies, he says \"you can find at least 10 suppliers within a day.\" \nThis kind of business environment does not exist in the US, and with a steady supply chain already established in China, it is going to be impractical for Apple to move their facility to the US. And it can be financially detrimental. This is the sentiment of Jason Dedrick, professor at Syracuse University's School of Information Studies. He says that with all the time and energy needed to move manufacturing from China to the US, other competitors from Korea and China can have time to catch up . He also says that once Apple decides to start manufacturing in the US, $30-$40 per device should be added to compensate for all the investment and higher labor costs. \nBut Trump is not fazed, and so are many Americans who want their jobs back. As Trump said on his campaign speech back in January, \"We're going to get Apple to build their damn computers and things in this country instead of in other countries.\"",

      "text": "(Before It's News)\nApple officials have been secretly meeting with the Food and Drug Administration over the past few years, discussing diagnostic apps and other unreleased health products.\n“And he causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive a mark in their right hand, or in their foreheads: And that no man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name.” Revelation 13:16,17 (KJV)\nEDITOR’S NOTE: Apple’s sales, in the absence of idea man Steve Jobs, continue their downward slide as has its stock price . They need something really big, something as revolutionary as the iPhone once was. The one area that no one has yet broken into is human implantable devices that will eventually replace handheld mobile devices. The first step was getting the computer in front of you, second step was getting it on you, third and last step will be putting it inside you. We are just about there.\nThe conversations suggest that Apple has significant ambitions in health technology far beyond the nascent services it has publicly released so far — ambitions that may lead to new products that require government regulation as health devices.\nThe secret meetings were not listed on FDA public calendars. They were discovered and reported by Mobi Health News , which obtained emails between Apple and FDA officials through a Freedom of Information Act request.\nWhat they talked about In the sometimes redacted emails seen by Mobi Health News , Apple officials discuss several unreleased products including:\nTwo “possible (and related) products in the cardiac space” A diagnostic app for Parkinson’s disease. Fast Company previously reported that Apple was working on an app to monitor Parkinson’s. The “cardiac space” products are interesting, though the emails seen by Mobi Health News don’t have more details. The reporters speculate that it might have to do with an EKG attachment for the Apple Watch. AliveCor , a startup, makes a similar product called Kardia Band.\nIt’s also possible that Apple is planning to integrate better heart-rate tracking into future versions of the Apple Watch.\nPlus, there have been rumors from earlier this year that Apple is working on a health-focused hardware device. And Apple CEO Tim Cook has hinted that a regulated medical device is something the company would be interested in. source\nThe post FOIA Requests Reveal That Apple May Be Secretly Developing An Human Implantable Mobile Device appeared first on Now The End Begins .",

      "text": "You are using an outdated browser. Please upgrade your browser to improve your experience. DirecTV Now is Another Viable Way for Apple TV Users to Cut the Cord A subscription starts at $35 per month by Brent Dirks December 1, 2016 \nIn just the span of a few weeks, cord cutting has gotten much more viable for anyone with Apple devices. Sony’s PlayStation Vue launched earlier this month and DirecTV Now has just thrown its hat into the ring this week. Starting at $35 per month Starting at $35 per month \nAlong with the Apple TV, you can access the streaming service on your iPhone or iPad and other outlets as well. \nA subscription starts at $35 per month, and there are pricing tiers that go all the way to $70 monthly. You can add premium channels HBO and Cinemax for $5 each per month, which is a very nice deal. \nMy colleague Bryan M. Wolfe ran down all of the important information about subscribing , so we also wanted to take a closer look at the service so you can determine if it’s right for you. Home sweet home A look at the main screen. On the home screen, you can see what's on now along with a look at other on-demand content and movies. Suggested content Playing catchup. The on-demand content is also split into a number of different sections to help find what you like to watch. You can also view programming by network. A guided tour If you're looking for a more traditional view of what's on TV, there's a great guide section. The channels are shown alphabetically, and you can see what's on now or in the future. You can also select specific channels to appear on a guide of favorites. How it compares \nCompared to Sling TV and PlayStation Vue, DirecTV Now has some serious catching up to do. There is no DVR service of any kind, something already available to Vue users and coming soon to at least some devices connecting to Sling TV . \nAlso, you can only access DirecTV Now on two devices at the same time, less than the five device limit on PlayStation Vue and the three devices allowed on Sling TV’s Blue option. \nThe lack of major channels available through the other services like CBS, NFL RedZone, Showtime, and others is also a big downside. The amount of local channels you’ll receive is dependent on your location as well, and looks to be problematic. \nEven though the DirecTV Now site said I would receive my local NBC station, it was conspicuously absent on the Apple TV version even though I could access it on my iPhone. \nI wasn’t exactly wild about the layout on DirecTV Now, much preferring UI on both Sling TV’s and PlayStation Vue on the Apple TV. A few perks A few perks \nPrepay for three months of any DirecTV now and receive a free, fourth-generation Apple TV. That's a great offer if you still haven't made the move to Apple's latest streaming device. \nBut there are still a few reasons to look at DirecTV Now. To celebrate the launch, for a limited time, the Go Big package will be $35 per month instead of its usual $60 monthly price tag. Subscribers will be able to keep that rate as long as they continue with the service. \nAlso, if you’re still in the market for a new Apple TV, you can prepay for three months of service and receive the set-top box for free . You can also sign-up for a free, seven-day trial. \nAnd anyone who is a current AT&T mobile customer can stream from the service without it counting against their data limits, which could be a big perk for some possible subscribers. \nBut for now, take a look at Sling TV and PlayStation Vue first if you’re wanting to say goodbye to the cable company once and for all. \nDownload the app now",

      "text": "Apple said to fly drones to improve maps data and catch Google [video]   1:30 PM Mark Gurman, Alan Levin - Bloomberg \nApple plans to use drones and new indoor navigation features to improve its Maps service and catch longtime leader Google, according to people familiar with the matter. \nThe Cupertino, California-based company is assembling a team of robotics and data-collection experts that will use drones to capture and update map information faster than its existing fleet of camera-and-sensor ladened minivans, one of the people said. \nApple wants to fly drones around to do things like examine street signs, track changes to roads and monitor if areas are under construction, the person said. The data collected would be sent to Apple teams that rapidly update the Maps app to provide fresh information to users, the person added. \nApple is also developing new features for Maps, including views inside buildings and improvements to car navigation, another person familiar with the efforts said. The people asked not to be identified talking about private projects. An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment. \nFive years after Google Maps launched on the iPhone, Apple's mapping app was introduced in 2012 with glaring errors like a grocery store marked as a hospital and an incorrect airport address. Apple lacked the technology needed to quickly suck in data from many different sources to evaluate and change the digital maps. \n\"There's a huge data-quality issue there, and I don't think we initially appreciated all the kinds of technology we would need to do that on an ongoing basis,\" Craig Federighi, Apple's senior vice president of software engineering, told Fast Company earlier this year. \nDigital maps are crucial tools for Apple and Google to attract developers that build popular travel, ride-sharing, and retail apps and services that integrate with the companies' mobile operating systems. Collecting accurate data is the most important part of digital map building and Apple's latest moves could help it match the prodigious capabilities of Google in this field. \nSince Apple Maps launched, the company has improved the app by more quickly updating data, adding a mode for navigating public transit systems, improving search results, and opening the platform to outside services such as Uber ride-hailing and OpenTable restaurant reservations. The drone initiative is a continuation of this effort and is unlikely to be related to a commercial Apple drone product. \nApple filed for an exemption on Sept. 21, 2015, from the Federal Aviation Administration to fly drones for commercial purposes, according to documents obtained by Bloomberg News. At that time, exemptions were required to commercially operate drones. In a response dated March 22, 2016, the FAA granted Apple approval to \"operate an unmanned aircraft system to conduct data collection, photography, and videography,\" according to one of the documents. \nApple's application told the FAA that it would use a range of drones sold by companies such as SZ DJI Technology Co. and Aibotix to collect the data. \nOfficial guidelines for commercial drone operation were instated in August, restricting flying to mostly daytime hours and requiring licensed pilots to operate the equipment while keeping the drones in their line of sight. Apple committed to these guidelines, according to the FAA documents. \nThe current rules restrict commercial drones from flying over people and buildings, potentially limiting Apple's initiative for the time being. Apple could meanwhile fly the drones in the U.S. within FAA guidelines and fly without restriction in countries without commercial drone regulations. \nApple has hired at least one person from Amazon.com Inc.'s Prime Air division to help run the drone team, one of the people said. Prime Air is Amazon's initiative to quickly deliver packages via drones. The Apple team is being assembled in Seattle, the same city as Amazon's headquarters, the person said. \nBeyond better data collection, Apple is developing an indoor mapping view that would allow users to navigate airports, and other high-traffic buildings like museums using iPhones, according to another person. \nApple acquired startup Indoor.io last year to help bring its indoor mapping project to market, according to another person familiar with the matter. Apple confirmed the purchase, but declined to say why it did the deal. The company also bought WiFiSlam in 2013, another startup with indoor navigation expertise. \nIndoor location tracking is achieved via a combination of technologies inside the latest iPhones, including pressure sensors, GPS, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth. Apple is also working on a feature that provides better guidance for changing lanes while driving, one of the people said. Both features are planned for release next year but could be held back, the person said. \n---",

      "text": "News Apple now takes your old Apple Watch for free recycling You can send your old Apple Watch as part of the Apple Renew program, but don't expect a gift card in return. Staff Writer, Macworld | Dec 1, 2016 11:02     \nAfter upgrading to the Apple Watch Series 2, people now have another option for what to do with their old smartwatches. \nThis week, Apple added the Apple Watch to the Apple Renew program , which aims to get people to send their old devices to be recycled properly free of charge. But Apple is not offering store credit or a gift card in exchange for sending in an old Watch. \nTypically, customers who trade in iPhones, iPads, and Macs via Apple Renew receive a credit for the Apple Store. For example, recycling an iPhone 6s Plus with 128GB can get you a $300 gift card, and sending in a working MacBook is valued at about $450 in Apple Store credit. It seems that the Apple Watch trade-ins, like the iPod, don’t receive anything in return—well, except for the peace of mind that you’re helping out the environment. \nApple uses a third party, Sims Recycling Solutions , to manage the new Apple Watch recycling program. Sims has “a zero-landfill policy and proven sustainability,” and it’s linked directly from the Apple Renew website. \nThe impact on you: Of course, there are more lucrative ways to get rid of your old Apple Watch if it’s still working. Most iPhone trade-in sites like Nextworth , Maxback , and Stopoint will accept an Apple Watch and help you resell it. The trade-in value of a 38mm Apple Watch with Milanese Loop currently ranges from $60 on Nextworth to $158 on Stopoint.  ",

      "text": "News The mysteries of the GPU in Apple's iPhone 7 are unlocked Apple's GPU in the A10 Fusion chip used in the iPhone 7 is based on the same architecture used in the A9 chip, with tweaks for the speed boost U.S. Correspondent, IDG News Service | Dec 1, 2016 11:42 AM PT Email a friend Use commas to separate multiple email addresses From Your message has been sent. Sorry There was an error emailing this page. \nThe iPhone 7 has strong graphics capabilities. Credit: Apple Mingis on Tech: Google rolls out the hardware \nUsers have praised the performance of Apple's A10 Fusion chip in the iPhone 7, but its underlying graphics architecture may not be so new after all. \nThe GPU in the iPhone 7 uses a custom version of the PowerVR GT7600 GPU, which is based on the same graphics processor architecture as in last year's iPhone 6S and 6S Plus , according to an analysis by The Linley Group, which specializes in semiconductors. \nApple has claimed that the A10 Fusion CPU is two times faster than its predecessor, the A9, and the GPU about 50 percent faster. \nBenchmarking has revealed a mixed bag for A10 Fusion GPU's performance, according to the analyst firm. Some benchmarks supported Apple's GPU performance gain claims, and others fell way off. But the high levels of GPU performance are only temporary. \nThe big problem is Apple's GPU can't sustain its peak performance for long without concerns of overheating, Linley Gwennap, founder and principal analyst at Linley Group, said in a research note this week. \nApple has been amassing in-house graphics experts to improve the GPU technology in mobile devices. Apple made tweaks in the PowerVR GT7600 GPU architecture -- which it licensed from Imagination Technologies -- to improve performance. \nGwennap estimates Apple increased clock speed by 50 percent to get those performance gains. The custom Apple GPU blows away competitors when operating at peak speed, but it can't sustain that performance. \n\"We believe the iPhone 7, to avoid overheating, throttles back from its top GPU speed after a minute or less, preventing it from achieving a high score for all users,\" Gwennap said. \nThe A10 Fusion GPU has six cores and operates at around 900MHz. It cranks up the frequency to reach peak speed. \nThe next advance in Apple's GPUs would be to adopt the architecture underlying Imagination's next-generation PowerVR Series8 GPU Family. Imagination has released PowerVR Series8XE GPUs for low-cost devices but hasn't released a high-performance successor, which in theory would be based on the same architecture. \nThat raises questions about how Apple will proceed with its next custom GPU. The underlying PowerVR Series8 architecture has many structural changes from its predecessor, the Series7. Series8 is tuned for VR and other emerging applications, and it supports the latest APIs like Vulkan. Apple has shown no interest yet in Vulkan, which is becoming a standard in game development. \nLinley Group placed the Adreno 530 GPU in Qualcomm's Snapdragon 820 ahead of the Apple's latest GPU in overall size, power efficiency, and performance metrics. \nThe size of the chip is an important metric because it \"controls both cost and power, so Adreno’s efficiency edge should benefit both customers and end users,\" Gwennap said. \nDavid Kanter, an analyst for Real World Technologies, also detailed some advances in Apple's GPU on his website. The tweaks differentiate Apple GPUs from generic PowerVR GPU designs. Apple formerly licensed generic PowerVR designs for earlier A-series chips until it started tweaking the underlying architecture that defines those GPUs. \nApple's tweaks ensure the A10 Fusion GPU can calculate faster and also ensures harmony with Apple's Metal API, which brings better special effects and visuals to the company's iPhones, iPads, Macs, and Apple TV. \nThe A10 Fusion GPU offers superior 16-bit floating-point performance and data conversion functions. The company also uses a custom shader compiler and graphics driver. \n\"The proprietary design enables Apple to deliver best-in-class performance for graphics, and other tasks that use the GPU, such as image processing and machine learning,\" Kanter wrote. \nApple is trying to make a GPU that works best with its hardware and software, much like it has done with its CPU, Kanter said. It's taken tighter control of its entire product stack, and customizing the GPU was the next logical step. This benefits users, who get a better gaming and graphics experience. \nBenchmark results vary depending on the test performed, and device-specific tweaks may not measure well. But as a graphics architecture, PowerVR is falling out of favor with mobile device makers, and Apple's tweaks to the underlying chip design may ultimately hold the key to the architecture's future. \nApple previously was in talks to acquire Imagination Technologies, but the negotiations went nowhere.

Drones \nby Chris Smith Read Comments \nLet us preface by saying this; Apple Maps is way improved in iOS 10 . The new interface, the easy to access shortcuts, the integration of apps, the ability to book an Uber and the Parked Car feature are all worthy additions. \nHowever, it’s still far from perfect, which is why Apple is still looking to improve its stock mapping solution for iOS devices. \nAccording to Bloomberg sources the solution lies in drones, which will be used to examine street signs and ensure changes in road layouts are captured so they can be reflected in Maps. \nRelated: Apple Maps debacle means we now get iOS public betas \nThe report says Apple is “assembling a team of robotics and data collection experts that will use drones to capture and update map information faster than its existing fleet of camera and sensor ladened minivans.” \nApple has been trailing Google Maps ever since it replaced Mountain View’s long-trusted app in iOS 6 with a largely derided homebrewed option. \nThe initial failings, which removed landmarks like the Statue of Liberty from maps, and let poor drivers onto airport runways, cost longtime iOS chief Scott Forstall his job. \nVideo: iOS 10 Tips & Tricks \nAccording to today’s reports Apple filed for permission to fly drones for commercial purposes over a tear ago. \nPermission was granted back in March, so the efforts to use drones to improve Maps may already be underway. \nThe Bloomberg sources say at least one member of Amazon’s Prime Air team has been poached to assist Apple with the development and deployment of the drone fleet. \nAre you an Apple Maps convert or is the first thing you do with a new iPhone still a Google Maps download? \nShare your thoughts in the comments below. \nWatch The Refresh: The best tech gossip and reviews every week 0 shares",

Is Apple already killing the iPhone 7 and going all-in on the iPhone 8? \nby Chris Smith \nWhen Apple released the iPhone 7 back in September, there was intense debate about whether it was worth buying or waiting until the iPhone 8, a potentially much larger overhaul. \nWell, according to reports on Thursday, Apple may have determined enough customers are playing the long game. \nDigitimes reports (via MacRumors ) Apple is trimming orders from suppliers amid waning demand for this year’s devices. \nRelated: Apple iPhone 8 - What you need to know \nThose loose-lipped supply chain sources have been speaking out of turn again, this time claiming the initial flurry to obtain those Jet Black iPhone 7 Plus models is starting to fade . \nThe sources say, suppliers have ‘been shifting their focus’ towards the next-generation, 10th anniversary iPhone which will arrive next autumn. \nRumours have suggested Apple will revamp the phone’s design, with edge-to-edge OLED displays, glass casing as well as finally introducing the ability to wirelessly charge the device. \nWhile we can’t verify the accuracy of today’s report, we find it unlikely that Apple has given up on the iPhone 7 with three quarters still to go until the next launch cycle begins. \nAlso, the 7 Plus models are still pretty difficult to come by with most models on back order in the run up to Christmas. \nHowever, there’s no doubting the iPhone 7, minus a headphone jack and with a new click-less Home button, has endured a tough critical reception. \nA couple of months back we debated the merits of purchasing the iPhone 7 now or hanging fire until the all-important iPhone 8? \nYou can see that conversation in the video below and share your own feelings in the comments. \nHead to Head: Should you buy an iPhone 7 or wait for the iPhone 8?

      "text": "Mobile & Wireless The mysteries of the GPU in Apple's iPhone 7 are unlocked Apple's GPU in the A10 Fusion chip used in the iPhone 7 is based on the same architecture used in the A9 chip, with tweaks for the speed boost U.S. Correspondent, IDG News Service | Dec 1, 2016 11:30   \nThe iPhone 7 has strong graphics capabilities. Credit: Apple What is Wi-Fi beamforming and MU-MIMO? \nUsers have praised the performance of Apple's A10 Fusion chip in the iPhone 7, but its underlying graphics architecture may not be so new after all. \nThe GPU in the iPhone 7 uses a custom version of the PowerVR GT7600 GPU, which is based on the same graphics processor architecture as in last year's iPhone 6S and 6S Plus , according to an analysis by The Linley Group, which specializes in semiconductors. \nApple has claimed that the A10 Fusion CPU is two times faster than its predecessor, the A9, and the GPU about 50 percent faster. NEWSLETTERS: Get the latest tech news sent directly to your in-box \nBenchmarking has revealed a mixed bag for A10 Fusion GPU's performance, according to the analyst firm. Some benchmarks supported Apple's GPU performance gain claims, and others fell way off. But the high levels of GPU performance are only temporary. \nThe big problem is Apple's GPU can't sustain its peak performance for long without concerns of overheating, Linley Gwennap, founder and principal analyst at Linley Group, said in a research note this week. \nApple has been amassing in-house graphics experts to improve the GPU technology in mobile devices. Apple made tweaks in the PowerVR GT7600 GPU architecture -- which it licensed from Imagination Technologies -- to improve performance. \nGwennap estimates Apple increased clock speed by 50 percent to get those performance gains. The custom Apple GPU blows away competitors when operating at peak speed, but it can't sustain that performance. \n\"We believe the iPhone 7, to avoid overheating, throttles back from its top GPU speed after a minute or less, preventing it from achieving a high score for all users,\" Gwennap said. \nThe A10 Fusion GPU has six cores and operates at around 900MHz. It cranks up the frequency to reach peak speed. \nThe next advance in Apple's GPUs would be to adopt the architecture underlying Imagination's next-generation PowerVR Series8 GPU Family. Imagination has released PowerVR Series8XE GPUs for low-cost devices but hasn't released a high-performance successor, which in theory would be based on the same architecture. \nThat raises questions about how Apple will proceed with its next custom GPU. The underlying PowerVR Series8 architecture has many structural changes from its predecessor, the Series7. Series8 is tuned for VR and other emerging applications, and it supports the latest APIs like Vulkan. Apple has shown no interest yet in Vulkan, which is becoming a standard in game development. \nLinley Group placed the Adreno 530 GPU in Qualcomm's Snapdragon 820 ahead of the Apple's latest GPU in overall size, power efficiency, and performance metrics. \nThe size of the chip is an important metric because it \"controls both cost and power, so Adreno’s efficiency edge should benefit both customers and end users,\" Gwennap said. \nDavid Kanter, an analyst for Real World Technologies, also detailed some advances in Apple's GPU on his website. The tweaks differentiate Apple GPUs from generic PowerVR GPU designs. Apple formerly licensed generic PowerVR designs for earlier A-series chips until it started tweaking the underlying architecture that defines those GPUs. \nApple's tweaks ensure the A10 Fusion GPU can calculate faster and also ensures harmony with Apple's Metal API, which brings better special effects and visuals to the company's iPhones, iPads, Macs, and Apple TV. \nThe A10 Fusion GPU offers superior 16-bit floating-point performance and data conversion functions. The company also uses a custom shader compiler and graphics driver. \n\"The proprietary design enables Apple to deliver best-in-class performance for graphics, and other tasks that use the GPU, such as image processing and machine learning,\" Kanter wrote. \nApple is trying to make a GPU that works best with its hardware and software, much like it has done with its CPU, Kanter said. It's taken tighter control of its entire product stack, and customizing the GPU was the next logical step. This benefits users, who get a better gaming and graphics experience. \nBenchmark results vary depending on the test performed, and device-specific tweaks may not measure well. But as a graphics architecture, PowerVR is falling out of favor to mobile device makers, and Apple's tweaks to the underlying chip design may ultimately hold the key to the architecture's future. \nApple previously was in talks to acquire Imagination Technologies, but the negotiations went nowhere.

      "text": "Apple apologizes for iCloud calendar invite spam, actively identifying and blocking send 9TO5MAC Some Apple users have been plagued with iCloud calendar invite spam in recent weeks, with calendar periods being blocked up with unsolicited events from anonymous senders (usually with Chinese names). It is thought that the spammers are mass targeting any iCloud email account it can find on the web, rather than targeting specific users. Apple has now acknowledged the issue in a statement to iMore, starting with an apology to anyone who has received iCloud calendar spam. The company says it is actively identifying and blocking suspicious senders to try and stem the arrival of the junk messages. iCloud calendar spam has been a long-running issue but peaked in recent weeks with a fresh wave of spammers exploiting the holiday shopping season. As any person can send an invite to an arbitrary email address, these unscrupulous senders are simply trying any email address they can find, hoping a real person is on the other end of it. Heres Apples full statement, as provided to iMore. We are sorry that some of our users are receiving spam calendar invitations. We are actively working to address this issue by identifying and blocking suspicious senders and spam in the invites being sent. Recipients of the spam invites are left in a confusing situation as there isnt a clear-cut solution for the problem. Users can Decline the invites, which will remove the event from their calendar, but will not prevent the spammers from sending more invites in future and alerts the sender that the email address is active and has a real person on the other end of it. Therefore, pressing Decline can do more harm than good. Calendar on iOS and Mac currently lacks any way to block these invites. In the absence of an official feature, there is a convoluted workaround to use in the meantime but isnt simple or convenient. A definitive comprehensive answer to the question how to fix iCloud calendar spam? doesnt really exist. Perhaps in a future software release, Apple will add a feature to limit the scope of people that can invite an account. Until something like this arrives, the simplest option is to just ignore the spam events. Its basically harmless as long as you dont click on the links in the messages. As mentioned in the statement, the company is currently attacking the issue from the server-side. It is employing spam-detection techniques to prevent the invites from going out in the first place. Time will tell if this strategy is effective and/or sufficient. fat_boyy21",

      "text": "Will Apple's push to collect mapping data with drones help build out and support an ad-targeting network?\nThe iPhone maker will reportedly use drone technology to accelerate data collection and improve the accuracy of locations. There are parallels to Google Wave, but rather than using human intervention to report on changing road conditions, Apple will do it with drones to examine street signs, track changes to roads and monitor whether areas are under construction. The drones would transmit the information to Apple's Map team, who would update information to users.  \nThe new Maps platform will offer the ability to view inside buildings and have improved car navigation features. The report comes with information about Apple's September 2015 filing with the Federal Aviation Administration, asking permission to fly drones for commercial purposes. In a response dated March 2016, the FAA granted Apple approval to operate an unmanned craft to collect data, and take still photos and video.\nThe issue for mapmakers is to keep map coverage up to date, said Mike Dobson, president at telemapics.com, which he founded after working at Rand McNally as chief technologist for more than a dozen years. Very accurate data is required to improve ad targeting platforms with the ability to identify exact locations of streets, buildings, transportation targets and more, Dobson said.\nHaving extremely current mapping data, similar to what drones can offer, could certainly help Apple with ad revenue, but Apple and ad revenue do not seem synonymous to Dobson. He said it seems more realistic to think about how the data will help Apple catch up with Google's Mapping platform.\n\"The mere consequence of the friction of distance limits how frequently and how much information companies can gather from diverse geographic areas to update maps more quickly,\" he said.",

      "text": "Tiny Wings update adds more levels, iPhone 6 resolution, Apple TV app Honestly, I did not see this one coming share In some of the most unexpected App Store news of the year, Tiny Wings — the classic iPhone game originally released in 2011 — has been updated, with new levels and support for the larger resolutions of Apple's newer iPhone 6 and 6 Plus screens. Additionally, developer Andreas Illiger announced a separate $2.99 Apple TV version of the game, Tiny Wings TV , that's also out today. It allows for the same iconic hill-sliding gameplay on a larger screen. It also permits two-player split-screen, using an iPhone as a second controller. The Apple TV version also syncs progress with the iOS app, so you won’t need to clear the challenges a second time. this is only the third time the game has been updated since its 2011 launch Some context: Tiny Wings is one of the single greatest games ever released for the iPhone, ranking up there with titles like Angry Birds . Developed solely by Illiger, it's an amazingly fun game that still holds up today, even though it came out more than five years ago. And while it looked like the game was being abandoned to quietly age to obsolescence, today's update brings new life to the game's future. This is only the third time the game has been updated — several new levels were added in August 2014, and an update added iPhone 5 support from back in October 2012. Here's hoping we won't be waiting until 2018 for the next one. In the meantime, I know what I'll be playing on my commute home. Next Up In Gaming ",

      "text": "Retail Opportunities For Apple In Asia Abound Dec. 1.16 \nIncreasing but small proportion of Apple's retail footprint is in Asia. \nGreater retail presence will strengthen ecosystem as well as just selling more products. \nThis retail investment will be good use of a small proportion of Apple's huge offshore cash pile. \nNumerous surveys show that Asia is where both the world's main retail growth and smartphone growth will come from in the next few years. \nIncreased retail presence essential for whole range of products, not just for the iPhones. Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) has the most successful retail operation in the world on the usual measure of dollars sold per square foot. Most of this is concentrated in the USA and Europe. Yet, the company's biggest growth is coming from Asia. Population and economic growth would suggest this trend is only likely to accelerate. The company has US$216 billion sitting offshore as of the Q4 2016 results . Putting more of this money to use by expanding retail in Asia is a very good use of funds. This can be done without significantly raising the company's capital expenditure figures. These are already forecast to rise to US$16 billion in fiscal 2017. That cost is mainly taken up by tooling/manufacturing costs and projects such as Campus 2 in California, rather than on retail. The growth potential in Asia for Apple in general, and through retail in particular, is greater than many analysts have recognized. Apple Retail Geographical Breakdown Apple's full list of retail stores can be found here. Of the 488 stores, 297 are in the USA and Canada, and 111 are in Europe. So 61% are in North America and 23% are in Europe. In 2015, the Americas in general accounted for 40.2% of revenue, and Europe for 21.5%. On that basis, one could say that North America is over-represented and Europe is about right. In Asia, Apple has rightly focused initially on China (36 stores) and Australia (22 stores). Elsewhere, there are eight stores in Japan, six in Hong Kong, and that's it. The roll-out in China is set to continue and is important. A Shanghai store is thought to be the single busiest store anywhere. The recent gains in that market made by local smartphone manufacturers Oppo and Vivo have been achieved on the back of their strong regional sales networks. Apple's stores in the country will have doubled this year, though there will still be less stores there than there are in California. Apple's management has expressed confidence for its next iPhone cycle. The iPhone 8 is likely to come with a curved screen, glass backing and wireless charging. Suppliers have expressed optimism there could be huge demand in the second half of 2017 for this. Forecasts that a radical redesign will boom in China in fiscal 2017 are probably correct. Apple needs a retail base which is as strong as possible to take advantage of this. Of course, this will not just accelerate iPhone sales, but a whole retail suite. This includes the Apple Watch, computers, Home Kit products and air pods. Apple in fact has the opportunity to expand its luxury retail footprint in Asia as well. One thinks especially of signature editions of the Apple Watch. A survey by Bain & Co. supports this. Based on 2015 sales, it found that Asia now represents 31% of luxury purchases. This compares to 24% for Americans and 18% for Europeans. For instance, when the special Premium Gold Watch was first launched, six out of the 15 first countries were in Asia. Last year, the company produced a limited edition Chinese New Year watch. This was sold in China, Singapore, Malaysia, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Beats also produced a special wireless headphone for Chinese New Year. In September, the company introduced the special edition Apple Watch Hermes, pictured below: Click to enlarge This was made available immediately in China, Hong Kong, Japan, Macau, Australia, Singapore and Taiwan. It had a starting price of US$1,149. This is not high-end luxury but is quite high cost. For luxury watches in general, China is the fastest-growing market in the world and India the third largest. Apple does not break down its Watch sales figures, but it is thought that 22% of sales are currently in China. A greater retail presence is definitely the best way to increase sales of this product, especially for the more upmarket versions. A visual representation of store concentration is as below: The map above also would seem to indicate that S-E Asia and South Asia are the best potential areas for future organic growth in Apple's retail footprint. The other main areas with few stores, Africa and South America, have many political and economic barriers to overcome. The 72 stores in Asia represent 15% of the total. Yet, in 2015, revenues for Asia accounted for 38.3% of the company's total. Despite the recent slide in iPhone sales in China, Asia is likely to increase in importance for Apple year-by-year in dollar terms. The company is moving in the right direction it seems. In Q3 2011, it had 72% of its stores in the USA. By Q2 2016, this had reduced to 55%. Apple Retail Ethos The company's tremendous retail success has been well documented. The graphic below shows how successful it is on the metric of dollar sales per square foot in the USA: What happens next is less certain. Apple recruited ex Burberry CEO Angela Ahrendts at great expense a couple of years ago. She recently gave details of her plans. These include a \"town square\" concept by which to enrich lives rather than just sell things, including lessons for children. The emphasis will be on the community. Stores will be geared to be \"vibrant gathering places\". There is also a new \"Creative Pro\" position within retail stores. These complement the Genius Bar, which is being re-flagged as \"Genius Grove.\" Her own title has been shortened from \"Senior Vice President of Retail & Online Stores\" to \"Senior Vice President of Retail.\" These changes strike me as largely cosmetic and PR driven, but the reader can decide for himself. Physically the stores are definitely changing under a U.S. renovation process. There is a new emphasis on wide open spaces. This was headlined in its Union Square Store in San Francisco, pictured below, with its massive 42ft glass doors. Click to enlarge Retail Plans for Asia The roll-out of stores in China is set to continue, and this can only be a good use of Apple's money. Elsewhere, the picture is less clear. Apple has been focusing on establishing Apple Pay around Asia as I detailed in an article some months ago. This most recently went online in Japan in October. Japan is one of the company's best markets anywhere in the world. Shopping is well known as a pastime of choice around Asia. Yet, there is currently no retail store in many of the continent's big and more affluent cities where the Apple brand is strong and growing stronger. At the recent Q4 2016 earnings call, for instance, company executives emphasized the \"very strong revenue growth\" in Thailand and Vietnam. One could cite just as an example: Singapore (5.6 million people). Bangkok (8.5 million people). Affordability will of course always be a problem, as the graphic below from iPrice confirms: There are however less expensive options than the new iPhone 7. These include refurbished iPhones and older models which Apple keeps on, but at lower prices. The Apple SE did well upon launch in China. In fact, in China, part of the attraction for consumers is that they show they can afford an iPhone. There are limits to what price the market will bear however. Apple's Q4 2016 year-on-year revenue comparisons came in for much negative comment from analysts. Much of this was to do with difficult comparisons from the outstanding Q4 2015. If one looks at sequential comparisons to Q3 2016 the picture is better: China -1% Japan +23% Rest of Asia Pacific +13% The retail roll-out around Asia does seem to be starting, but has been quite slow. It may well accelerate through 2017. It is believed the first store in Seoul in Korea is planned but with no firm date. Customers there have complained about poor service from third-party retailers. Apple did well in the country when launching the iPhone 6 in 2014, but market share is reported to have declined to about 10% at present. The recent troubles of Samsung ( OTC:SSNLF ) would have made this an opportune time to strike in its home market. Apple Music was recently launched in Korea. The case is similar in Singapore, where, in its early days, the company had a factory. A store was first announced in October 2015. It has no firm opening date yet, but is thought to be imminent. In Taiwan, the company is reportedly planning a retail store, though details are not released as yet. Job listings have been posted by the company so it is probably also imminent. Australia is a market where Apple does have a strong and successful retail presence with 22 stores in the country. It is reportedly planning a new iconic major store in Melbourne, where there are already three Apple stores. The iPhone is the biggest smartphone brand in Australia with 3.43 million units sold in 2015. Samsung is the number two brand. iOS has a 46% market share. So this could be seen as justification for the retail investment. Of course, it is not easy for Apple to rush such stores through internationally. The company needs to get well-qualified personnel, and the stores have to be iconic and architecturally impressive. The lack of stores has given the company reputational problems around Asia though. A recent example of this was the so-called \"Staingate.\" This even has its own Facebook site. This is where the protective coating on certain MacBooks has been peeling off, as pictured below: In countries where there is an Apple Store, the company has replaced the screen with no questions asked. Around Asia though re-sellers have often tried to run away from the problem. This has caused some bad publicity for the company. In conjunction with its retail expansion plans in Asia, Apple has been looking to set up development and technical centers around the continent. It already has these in China (in Beijing and Shanghai), Japan (Yokohama) and Taiwan (Longtan). It has been in discussions with authorities in Malaysia and in Vietnam. This fits with Apple's recent increases in spending on R&D operations and property expenditures. Apple in India The list of countries without Apple stores leaves out the whole of the Indian sub-continent. This represents about 1.6 billion people, but where there is perhaps not the income level yet to justify many stores. Despite this, Apple has been looking at retail stores for India, but come crunching up against the country's bureaucracy. Firstly , retail approval was turned down because the products are manufactured outside the country. Then, when Apple applied for exemption under a \"state of the art\" clause, it was turned down. Then it was turned down when applying to sell refurbished second-hand phones in the country. It seems India's local manufacturers successfully lobbied with the government on that issue. Long term, it looks like Apple will be investing heavily in the country. There have been reports for some time that Apple's main manufacturing partner in Asia, Foxconn ( OTC:FXCOF ), would be setting up factories in the country. Apple itself has opened a technology center in Hyderabad and is planning a design and development center in Bengaluru. Apple's iPhone has been gaining sales rapidly in India, albeit from a small base. iPhone sales were up over 50% in fiscal 2016. At the Q4 earnings call, Tim Cook cited the bullish factors. He listed the growing middle class, the young population (50% under the age of 25), and the roll-out of 4G which makes smartphones more desirable (These factors could in fact be cited in just about every country in Asia). Recent statistics seem to give the lie to those who say Apple is not doing well in the country. A study by Counterpoint Research estimated that in October Apple got 66% market share of what it called the \"premium phone\" market. This was well above Samsung, the traditional market leader for upmarket phones in India. The market for smartphones is growing at about 30% annually in India. The bureaucracy and rampant corruption in the country indicate it may be some time before an Apple store ever appears there. However, Tim Cook's recent visits to the country and investment plans there mean the company is well placed long term to replicate its success in China. Back in September 2014, my article predicted huge growth for Apple in China. There was an onslaught of responses that Apple could never make it big there, which of course have been proved to be wrong. There is no reason the same cannot happen in India, though probably at a less rapid pace than happened with China. Conclusion Apple's retail business accounts for 18% of the company's US$233.7 billion in sales. It is a vital part of cementing the ecosystem, providing better service, and promoting the brand. A recent survey by JLL found that of the 20 cities in the world experiencing the fastest growth for world retail brands, 12 are in Asia. Eight of these 12 are in China. The survey also found that the fastest-growing next cities will also be in Asia. It mentioned specifically Ho Chi Minh City (Vietnam), Jakarta (Indonesia) and Bengaluru (India). A recent report by Strategy Analytics named the next five countries where it expected rapid smartphone growth to take place. Four of these were in Asia: namely Indonesia, Thailand, the Philippines and Vietnam (the fifth was Nigeria). In a previous article I detailed an Ogilvy & Mather survey predicting where the biggest rise in middle-class spending will occur over the next decade. These were in Pakistan, Bangladesh, Myanmar, Indonesia and the Philippines. The current population of these countries alone is 750 million amongst Asia's total of 4.3 billion. Another survey, the annual 2016 Asia Top Brands for Consumers, found Apple the second most popular brand, behind Samsung, and ahead of Sony (NYSE: SNE ). So Apple is well positioned to get growth from secular trends in both retail growth and smartphone growth in Asia. This will be the most likely way to expand its bottom line and continue revenue growth in the next few years. An ever-increasing dollar amount in bricks and mortar around Asia to back this up would be money well spent. Disclosure: I am/we are long AAPL.

      "text": "Apple said to fly drones to improve maps data and catch Google [video]   1:30 PM Mark Gurman, Alan Levin - Bloomberg \nApple plans to use drones and new indoor navigation features to improve its Maps service and catch longtime leader Google, according to people familiar with the matter. \nThe Cupertino, California-based company is assembling a team of robotics and data-collection experts that will use drones to capture and update map information faster than its existing fleet of camera-and-sensor ladened minivans, one of the people said. \nApple wants to fly drones around to do things like examine street signs, track changes to roads and monitor if areas are under construction, the person said. The data collected would be sent to Apple teams that rapidly update the Maps app to provide fresh information to users, the person added. \nApple is also developing new features for Maps, including views inside buildings and improvements to car navigation, another person familiar with the efforts said. The people asked not to be identified talking about private projects. An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment. \nFive years after Google Maps launched on the iPhone, Apple's mapping app was introduced in 2012 with glaring errors like a grocery store marked as a hospital and an incorrect airport address. Apple lacked the technology needed to quickly suck in data from many different sources to evaluate and change the digital maps. \n\"There's a huge data-quality issue there, and I don't think we initially appreciated all the kinds of technology we would need to do that on an ongoing basis,\" Craig Federighi, Apple's senior vice president of software engineering, told Fast Company earlier this year. \nDigital maps are crucial tools for Apple and Google to attract developers that build popular travel, ride-sharing, and retail apps and services that integrate with the companies' mobile operating systems. Collecting accurate data is the most important part of digital map building and Apple's latest moves could help it match the prodigious capabilities of Google in this field. \nSince Apple Maps launched, the company has improved the app by more quickly updating data, adding a mode for navigating public transit systems, improving search results, and opening the platform to outside services such as Uber ride-hailing and OpenTable restaurant reservations. The drone initiative is a continuation of this effort and is unlikely to be related to a commercial Apple drone product. \nApple filed for an exemption on Sept. 21, 2015, from the Federal Aviation Administration to fly drones for commercial purposes, according to documents obtained by Bloomberg News. At that time, exemptions were required to commercially operate drones. In a response dated March 22, 2016, the FAA granted Apple approval to \"operate an unmanned aircraft system to conduct data collection, photography, and videography,\" according to one of the documents. \nApple's application told the FAA that it would use a range of drones sold by companies such as SZ DJI Technology Co. and Aibotix to collect the data. \nOfficial guidelines for commercial drone operation were instated in August, restricting flying to mostly daytime hours and requiring licensed pilots to operate the equipment while keeping the drones in their line of sight. Apple committed to these guidelines, according to the FAA documents. \nThe current rules restrict commercial drones from flying over people and buildings, potentially limiting Apple's initiative for the time being. Apple could meanwhile fly the drones in the U.S. within FAA guidelines and fly without restriction in countries without commercial drone regulations. \nApple has hired at least one person from Amazon.com Inc.'s Prime Air division to help run the drone team, one of the people said. Prime Air is Amazon's initiative to quickly deliver packages via drones. The Apple team is being assembled in Seattle, the same city as Amazon's headquarters, the person said. \nBeyond better data collection, Apple is developing an indoor mapping view that would allow users to navigate airports, and other high-traffic buildings like museums using iPhones, according to another person. \nApple acquired startup Indoor.io last year to help bring its indoor mapping project to market, according to another person familiar with the matter. Apple confirmed the purchase, but declined to say why it did the deal. The company also bought WiFiSlam in 2013, another startup with indoor navigation expertise. \nIndoor location tracking is achieved via a combination of technologies inside the latest iPhones, including pressure sensors, GPS, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth. Apple is also working on a feature that provides better guidance for changing lanes while driving, one of the people said. Both features are planned for release next year but could be held back, the person said. \n---",

Photo by Andrew Hoyle/CNET \nApple is reportedly putting together a fleet of drones to take to the skies in order to improve its Maps service, Bloomberg reported . \nThe drones will be used to examine street signs, track changes in road layouts and update the database with areas of construction, Bloomberg's source explained. Using drones to track the changes in the landscape would produce faster results than using cars fitted with cameras and sensors, which is how the company currently updates its service. \nApple is also said to have been granted approval to fly drones for commercial purposes by the US Federal Aviation Administration, and has reportedly hired at least one person from Amazon's drone delivery service Prime Air.

Apple is said to have hired a member of Amazon's Prime Air team to help with the data collection. \nApple is also developing new features for Maps that include views inside buildings. Bloomberg reported last year that Apple acquired startup Indoor.io to launch indoor maps, which could help people navigate airports, museums, and other buildings. \nIf all goes to plan, Apple is expected to launch the new Maps features in 2017. Apple is said to be focused on improving in-car navigation, as well. One feature will offer better guidance for changing lanes while driving, Bloomberg said.",

Apple's 2016 MacBook Pro & Linux Don't Mix Written by Michael Larabel in Computers on 1 December 2016. Page 1 of 3 . 7 Comments \nLast month I shared that Linux tests of the 2016 MacBook Pro would be coming and now I've finally managed to complete a few, but I highly encourage you not to get the new MacBook Pro if you plan on using anything other than macOS as the experience is a wreck. This is one laptop I don't mind seeing returned! \nI had a few days to have hands-on time with the 2016 MacBook Pro 15-inch with Touch Bar prior to needing to return it to a client/sponsor. While some years back I had used a MacBook Pro with Linux (and at times when the Linux battery performance was piss poor, VM'ed Linux), this 2016 MBP is a mess with current Linux distributions not supporting the hardware and with other vendors producing laptops with great build quality and specs that excite me, the MBP is no longer appealing. \nFor those not familiar with the new Apple MacBook Pro, it comes equipped with a new multi-touch Touch Bar, only USB-C / Thunderbolt 3 for connectivity ports, a reported 10 hour battery life, a brighter and thinner display, and much better performance over the older MacBook Pro laptops. \nYou've likely heard already others trialing Ubuntu and other distributions on the 2016 MacBook Pro and failing, and it's indeed certainly a mess. In order to boot Ubuntu 16.10 or other distributions, \"intremap=nosid\" has to be set by GRUB... Then after that, on some times when loading Ubuntu 16.10 via USB, the screen would be garbled... \nThat seems to most often happen when rebooting from macOS to Ubuntu, but if going from a cold boot the driver initialization appears fine. \nBut if you do manage to get to a working desktop, the 2016 MacBook Pro keyboard and touchpad aren't working... So I ended up doing all of my tests with an external USB keyboard/mouse.",

      "text": "HP \nChromebooks are so close.\nApple’s Mac lineup appears set for the foreseeable future, but with no refresh to the aging MacBook Air , there's no one up-to-date notebook that costs less than $1,299.\nThe momentum behind super affordable Windows laptops, meanwhile, has faded — and what is available for less than $400 is typically marked by flimsy hardware, slow processors, and ugly displays.\nThat means there’s still an opportunity for Google’s low-cost laptops to swoop in and attract budget buyers. Not everyone wants a tablet. And Chrome OS, the lightweight operating system at the heart of all Chromebooks, remains supremely efficient and perfectly competent for many people.\nNo, it doesn’t do Photoshop, but if you think about the things most people do with a laptop — read websites, watch videos, write papers — there’s little that Google’s Chrome browser doesn’t enable. I’ve used one as my main machine for the past two years, and I’ve been surprised at how little I’ve missed.\nPlus, Chrome is fast here. It’s not the heavy breathing memory hog it can be on Mac or Windows; it is Chrome OS, and its commitment to the line of Chromebooks means it stays fast, even on lesser hardware. Meaning: Done right, Chromebooks can be good and cheap at the same time.\nHP Right now, though, nobody’s really doing it right. Yes, there are good Chromebooks . The Asus Chromebook 13 has a 1080p display. The Lenovo ThinkPad 13 Chromebook has a comfy keyboard. The Acer Chromebook R11 is convertible and lightweight. And so on.\nBut for every aspect Chromebooks like these get right, there’s always some fundamental annoyance that’s just difficult to live with.\nThe Asus’ full HD screen is too dim, and the whole thing gets just a bit too slow over time. The Lenovo’s display has mediocre colors. The Acer’s 11-inch display is low-resolution, and likely too small for some. A 13-inch model can't multitask comfortably. \nUp until a few months ago, the Toshiba Chromebook 2 was the clear standout. It cost $300, and it had everything important. But Toshiba recently quit the consumer laptop game, and now that laptop looks to be gone for good.\nToday, there is one Chromebook that ticks all the boxes, and that’s the Dell Chromebook 13. Its keyboard is great, its battery lasts more than 10 hours, it looks sharp, it feels sturdy, and it’s plenty fast enough.\nHP But it’s just too expensive. If you’re okay dropping a minimum of $429 on a Chromebook, by all means buy the Dell and don’t look back. But even if Chrome OS is more useful than most people think, paying this sort of premium for a computer that cannot run desktop apps is a tough ask, no matter how nice it is.\nGoogle is aware of this shortcoming, though, and aims to address it by porting over the app store from its other OS, Android. We tested a beta version of this in June — it’s buggy and awkward, but with some polish, it should be an easy way to add the offline (and gaming) abilities Chrome OS is lacking.\nGoogle has taken longer to roll out the Google Play Store to Chromebooks than it initially promised, but things are (slowly) moving , and now the plan is to release it en masse “later in 2016/2017.”\nUnfortunately, it’s going to make the search for a balanced Chromebook even harder, since Android apps play much nicer with a touchscreen, and not every notebook has that. In Dell’s case, you can get one for $629. That’s too much.\nHP There are two clouds hanging over all this.\nThe simple one is that CES is next month. With Android apps mostly on the horizon, it wouldn’t be a shock to see a wave of flexible, touchscreen Chromebooks pop up. Whether those will be any good, who knows; Chromebooks’ growth is still coming from schools more than the general public, so the price hike that comes with adding a touchscreen may not be worth it.\nThe second cloud hanging over Chromebooks is Andromeda, the long-rumored fusion of Chrome OS and Android. Android Police reported in September that Google is working on a high-end “Pixel 3” laptop that will run that blended operating system, arrive in Q3 2017, and start at $799. That’s a lot of money, but if Google is about to combine Chrome OS and Android, rather than shove the latter into the former, that might explain why the current Chromebook market is so underwhelming.\nAll of that is for the future, though. Today, in the thick of the holiday season, it’s hard to point to any one Chromebook and confidently say, “put your money toward this.” You can get something good, but it's hard to get something great. If you can wait for a great Chromebook, do that instead.\nNOW WATCH: The ‘Apple of China’ just unveiled a phone that’s more powerful and better looking than the iPhone \n",

      "title": "Apple Using Drones for Apple Maps",
      "text": "Images via Apple A report suggests Apple's going to use drones to improve its Maps application. \nApple Maps has come a very long way from its error-riddled beginnings . In fact, with iOS 10, the app is downright useful —and looks good, too. Apparently, it's still playing catchup to competitor Google Maps, but thanks to a recent acquisition and a new plan for capturing aerial data, its Maps app could finally surpass its competitor. According to Bloomberg, Apple plans for a robotics and data-collection team to use drones to collect aerial map information for Maps. This would let the company update its mapping data more quickly than with the sensor-covered vans it uses to get 3D street view information. (These vans caused a flurry this summer when Apple deployed them around San Francisco and they were mistaken for self-driving cars .) \nThe drones would monitor for road changes, check for new or changing construction conditions, and get a closer look at street signs. That information could then be rapidly integrated into the app and its turn-by-turn navigation directions. \nApple also recently acquired company named Indoor.io , which conducts indoor mapping. Apple Maps already offers extensive indoor directions for public transit centers (so, if you're taking the subway in New York, you know which entrance and exit to use to get to most easily get to your destination). Apple could likely use this company's abilities to help it track other public spaces indoors as well, such as malls, airports, or museums. \nIt's unclear if Google currently employs drones for any of its Maps street view or 3D imagery (we reached out for clarification), but Apple's competitor is using drones for something else : testing drone-based deliveries. We doubt Apple's going to jump on that any time soon.",

      "text": "Mobile The mysteries of the GPU in Apple's iPhone 7 are unlocked Apple's GPU in the A10 Fusion chip used in the iPhone 7 is based on the same architecture used in the A9 chip, with tweaks for the speed boost U.S. Correspondent, IDG News Service | December 1, 2016 Email a friend Use commas to separate multiple email addresses From Your message has been sent. Sorry There was an error emailing this page. \nThe iPhone 7 has strong graphics capabilities. Credit: Apple 27% off WakaWaka Solar-Powered Flashlight and Smartphone Charger - Deal Alert \nUsers have praised the performance of Apple's A10 Fusion chip in the iPhone 7, but its underlying graphics architecture may not be so new after all. \nThe GPU in the iPhone 7 uses a custom version of the PowerVR GT7600 GPU, which is based on the same graphics processor architecture as in last year's iPhone 6S and 6S Plus , according to an analysis by The Linley Group, which specializes in semiconductors. \nApple has claimed that the A10 Fusion CPU is two times faster than its predecessor, the A9, and the GPU about 50 percent faster. [ Best Bluetooth speakers: We'll help you find the best wireless speakers for pairing with your smartphone or tablet—whatever your budget, and whatever music floats your boat. ] \nBenchmarking has revealed a mixed bag for A10 Fusion GPU's performance, according to the analyst firm. Some benchmarks supported Apple's GPU performance gain claims, and others fell way off. But the high levels of GPU performance are only temporary. \nThe big problem is Apple's GPU can't sustain its peak performance for long without concerns of overheating, Linley Gwennap, founder and principal analyst at Linley Group, said in a research note this week. \nApple has been amassing in-house graphics experts to improve the GPU technology in mobile devices. Apple made tweaks in the PowerVR GT7600 GPU architecture -- which it licensed from Imagination Technologies -- to improve performance. \nGwennap estimates Apple increased clock speed by 50 percent to get those performance gains. The custom Apple GPU blows away competitors when operating at peak speed, but it can't sustain that performance. \n\"We believe the iPhone 7, to avoid overheating, throttles back from its top GPU speed after a minute or less, preventing it from achieving a high score for all users,\" Gwennap said. \nThe A10 Fusion GPU has six cores and operates at around 900MHz. It cranks up the frequency to reach peak speed. \nThe next advance in Apple's GPUs would be to adopt the architecture underlying Imagination's next-generation PowerVR Series8 GPU Family. Imagination has released PowerVR Series8XE GPUs for low-cost devices but hasn't released a high-performance successor, which in theory would be based on the same architecture. \nThat raises questions about how Apple will proceed with its next custom GPU. The underlying PowerVR Series8 architecture has many structural changes from its predecessor, the Series7. Series8 is tuned for VR and other emerging applications, and it supports the latest APIs like Vulkan. Apple has shown no interest yet in Vulkan, which is becoming a standard in game development. \nLinley Group placed the Adreno 530 GPU in Qualcomm's Snapdragon 820 ahead of the Apple's latest GPU in overall size, power efficiency, and performance metrics. \nThe size of the chip is an important metric because it \"controls both cost and power, so Adreno’s efficiency edge should benefit both customers and end users,\" Gwennap said. \nDavid Kanter, an analyst for Real World Technologies, also detailed some advances in Apple's GPU on his website. The tweaks differentiate Apple GPUs from generic PowerVR GPU designs. Apple formerly licensed generic PowerVR designs for earlier A-series chips until it started tweaking the underlying architecture that defines those GPUs. \nApple's tweaks ensure the A10 Fusion GPU can calculate faster and also ensures harmony with Apple's Metal API, which brings better special effects and visuals to the company's iPhones, iPads, Macs, and Apple TV. \nThe A10 Fusion GPU offers superior 16-bit floating-point performance and data conversion functions. The company also uses a custom shader compiler and graphics driver. \n\"The proprietary design enables Apple to deliver best-in-class performance for graphics, and other tasks that use the GPU, such as image processing and machine learning,\" Kanter wrote. \nApple is trying to make a GPU that works best with its hardware and software, much like it has done with its CPU, Kanter said. It's taken tighter control of its entire product stack, and customizing the GPU was the next logical step. This benefits users, who get a better gaming and graphics experience. \nBenchmark results vary depending on the test performed, and device-specific tweaks may not measure well. But as a graphics architecture, PowerVR is falling out of favor to mobile device makers, and Apple's tweaks to the underlying chip design may ultimately hold the key to the architecture's future. \nApple previously was in talks to acquire Imagination Technologies, but the negotiations went nowhere.

      "title": "Review: ZENS Power Bank Will Charge Your iPhone and Apple Watch",
      "text": "Review: ZENS Power Bank Will Charge Your iPhone and Apple Watch Thursday December 1, 2016 1:07 PM PST by Juli Clover ZENS recently debuted its latest product, an iPhone/Apple Watch Power Bank that has a built-in Apple Watch charging puck and a USB port, allowing you to charge all of your devices at once. Priced at âŹ69.99 (or $78.00) the 4,000 mAh ZENS Power Bank is about the size and shape of a chocolate bar, though perhaps a bit wider. Because it's neither short nor particularly flat, it doesn't fit well in a pocket, but it's a good size for a backpack or bag when traveling. The Power Bank is sturdy and well-made, constructed from a soft-finish black plastic material. At one end, there's an Apple Watch charging puck built into the device, and at the top, there's a USB port for plugging in an iPhone or other USB-powered device, and a micro-USB port that's used for charging. There's a single button that's used as an on/off switch, which needs to be pressed whenever the Apple Watch is placed on top of it to activate charging. The Power Bank has a single blue LED next to the micro-USB port so you can tell if it has charge left, but because there aren't multiple LEDs, there's no way to tell exactly how much charge is remaining. Due to the flat, skinny shape of the ZENS Power Bank, I sometimes had trouble getting my Apple Watch situated just right so it would charge, and a knock was enough to dislodge it if I happened to hit it when reaching for something on my nightstand in the middle of the night. That said, it does work with multiple bands and it's no less convenient than using the Apple Watch charger on its own. I took the ZENS iPhone/Apple Watch Power Bank with me on a trip recently, and I can confirm that at 4,000 mAh, it has enough juice to keep an Apple Watch charged for a week. I used it for nine days straight to keep my 38mm Apple Watch charged, but I wasn't draining it every single day. As for the iPhone, the ZENS Power Bank can do just about one full iPhone 7 Plus charge and one full Apple Watch charge, but that eats up a lot of the capacity because it's limited to 4,000 mAh, which is on the small side for portable iPhone batteries. I was able to get it to charge my iPhone 7 Plus and my Apple Watch, but it was essentially drained after that. I don't have an iPhone 7 to test, but you could potentially get two charges out of the Power Bank because the iPhone 7 has a lower-capacity 1,960 mAh battery inside. It's worth noting that the Power Bank offers 2-amp charging, so the iPhone will charge at a decent speed. Because it can only deliver a single charge to an iPhone 7 Plus and an Apple Watch simultaneously, this is only going to work for day trips when you need a little extra juice. Conferences, a long day at Disneyland, and a night camping will all work fine, but don't buy this for a longer trip unless you only need to charge your Apple Watch. If you just want something to power the Apple Watch, this will work for a solid week of standard Apple Watch use. A little more if you're not using much battery, and a little less if you're draining your watch every day. At home, the Power Bank is nice if you want an Apple Watch charger that has no cords and only needs to be charged once a week from a computer or USB power adapter (it doesn't come with one). It can sit on a desk without taking up too much room, and its neutral design will match most decor. Bottom Line The ZENS iPhone/Apple Watch Power Bank costs approximately $78, which is not a great price for a 4,000 mAh battery pack. On Amazon, you can get a smaller 5,200 mAh battery pack for $15.99, or a 10,000 mAh battery pack for $30, but it won't have the built-in Apple Watch charger that's in the ZENS Power Bank. If you don't want to carry around an Apple Watch charger and want a built-in solution, the ZENS iPhone/Apple Watch Power Bank will deliver it, but personally, I'd rather pay much less for more power, especially if I'm seeking something that's got enough juice to charge my iPhone. You're going to be carrying a micro-USB charging cord and a Lightning cord to charge the iPhone if you use the ZENS Power Bank anyway, so I'm not sure how much of a convenience factor it's adding. If you want a cord-free desktop Apple Watch charging solution or need a way to power an Apple Watch alone for a week, however, the ZENS iPhone/Apple Watch Power Bank could be worth checking out. Pros: Can keep Apple Watch charged for a week Built-in Apple Watch charging puck Cons:",

Staff Writer, Macworld | Dec 1, 2016 11:10 AM PT Email a friend Use commas to separate multiple email addresses From Your message has been sent. Sorry There was an error emailing this page. Credit: Apple The first fashion shoot with the iPhone 7 Plus Portrait mode \nApple has been working to dramatically improve its Maps app ever since it’s botched launch back in 2012 . And it’s been successful: Maps is now packed with great features , thanks in part to Apple’s fleet of minivans capturing on-the-ground data. But it’s still not Google Maps, so Apple has a new plan. \nAccording to Bloomberg , the company is reportedly planning to use drones to quickly update Maps with fresh data, like road conditions, street sign changes, and construction updates, and other information that car cameras would have difficulty photographing. \nLast fall, Apple applied for permission from the Federal Aviation Administration to fly its drones for commercial purposes, back when that was restricted. Now the FAA has guidelines in place for commercial drones, but the rules prevent companies from flying drones over buildings or people. New Maps features coming soon \nApple isn’t just trying to beat Google at its own outdoor mapping game. The company is also trying to compete with indoor mapping, which would let you use your iPhone to find your way around large, busy buildings like airports and museums. The technology comes courtesy of indoor mapping startup Indoor.io, which Apple bought last year. \nApple has been interested in indoor location-tracking for years, using the iBeacon protocol with indoor positioning to allow venues to send notifications when you’re near a physical Bluetooth touchstone (and have Bluetooth turned on with the venue’s app installed). We saw this in action with MLB’s At the Ballpark app at Citi Field , home of the New York Mets, back in 2013. \nGoogle Maps already offers indoor maps, and it’s unclear if Apple’s will be more sophisticated or simply on par with the competition. Either way, Apple’s rumored Maps upgrades are significant, and a sign that Tim Cook and co. really are betting big on services—even ones that don’t contribute outright to the company’s bottom line.

      "text": "Apple said to fly drones to improve maps data and catch Google [video]   1:30 PM Mark Gurman, Alan Levin - Bloomberg \nApple plans to use drones and new indoor navigation features to improve its Maps service and catch longtime leader Google, according to people familiar with the matter. \nThe Cupertino, California-based company is assembling a team of robotics and data-collection experts that will use drones to capture and update map information faster than its existing fleet of camera-and-sensor ladened minivans, one of the people said. \nApple wants to fly drones around to do things like examine street signs, track changes to roads and monitor if areas are under construction, the person said. The data collected would be sent to Apple teams that rapidly update the Maps app to provide fresh information to users, the person added. \nApple is also developing new features for Maps, including views inside buildings and improvements to car navigation, another person familiar with the efforts said. The people asked not to be identified talking about private projects. An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment. \nFive years after Google Maps launched on the iPhone, Apple's mapping app was introduced in 2012 with glaring errors like a grocery store marked as a hospital and an incorrect airport address. Apple lacked the technology needed to quickly suck in data from many different sources to evaluate and change the digital maps. \n\"There's a huge data-quality issue there, and I don't think we initially appreciated all the kinds of technology we would need to do that on an ongoing basis,\" Craig Federighi, Apple's senior vice president of software engineering, told Fast Company earlier this year. \nDigital maps are crucial tools for Apple and Google to attract developers that build popular travel, ride-sharing, and retail apps and services that integrate with the companies' mobile operating systems. Collecting accurate data is the most important part of digital map building and Apple's latest moves could help it match the prodigious capabilities of Google in this field. \nSince Apple Maps launched, the company has improved the app by more quickly updating data, adding a mode for navigating public transit systems, improving search results, and opening the platform to outside services such as Uber ride-hailing and OpenTable restaurant reservations. The drone initiative is a continuation of this effort and is unlikely to be related to a commercial Apple drone product. \nApple filed for an exemption on Sept. 21, 2015, from the Federal Aviation Administration to fly drones for commercial purposes, according to documents obtained by Bloomberg News. At that time, exemptions were required to commercially operate drones. In a response dated March 22, 2016, the FAA granted Apple approval to \"operate an unmanned aircraft system to conduct data collection, photography, and videography,\" according to one of the documents. \nApple's application told the FAA that it would use a range of drones sold by companies such as SZ DJI Technology Co. and Aibotix to collect the data. \nOfficial guidelines for commercial drone operation were instated in August, restricting flying to mostly daytime hours and requiring licensed pilots to operate the equipment while keeping the drones in their line of sight. Apple committed to these guidelines, according to the FAA documents. \nThe current rules restrict commercial drones from flying over people and buildings, potentially limiting Apple's initiative for the time being. Apple could meanwhile fly the drones in the U.S. within FAA guidelines and fly without restriction in countries without commercial drone regulations. \nApple has hired at least one person from Amazon.com Inc.'s Prime Air division to help run the drone team, one of the people said. Prime Air is Amazon's initiative to quickly deliver packages via drones. The Apple team is being assembled in Seattle, the same city as Amazon's headquarters, the person said. \nBeyond better data collection, Apple is developing an indoor mapping view that would allow users to navigate airports, and other high-traffic buildings like museums using iPhones, according to another person. \nApple acquired startup Indoor.io last year to help bring its indoor mapping project to market, according to another person familiar with the matter. Apple confirmed the purchase, but declined to say why it did the deal. The company also bought WiFiSlam in 2013, another startup with indoor navigation expertise. \nIndoor location tracking is achieved via a combination of technologies inside the latest iPhones, including pressure sensors, GPS, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth. Apple is also working on a feature that provides better guidance for changing lanes while driving, one of the people said. Both features are planned for release next year but could be held back, the person said. \n---",

      "text": "  The next Apple Watch could have a circular display A newly published Apple patent shows the company is thinking about giving the Apple Watch a round facelift. Sarah Tew/CNET \nThe Apple Watch design may come full circle. Apple patents published Thursday indicate that the California tech company may give the Apple Watch a circular display. Enlarge Image Photo by Apple \nBoth the original Apple Watch and the Apple Watch Series 2 feature a similar rectangular display as the watch face, almost as if you took an iPhone, shrunk it down and strapped it to your wrist. Other wearables like the Samsung Gear S3 and Huawei Watch opt for a circular display, making the devices look more like a traditional watch. So while circular smartwatches are nothing new, it would be interesting to see Apple switch up its design. \nThe patent dates as far back as June 2015, not too long after the original Apple Watch was launched. When the Apple Watch Series 2 was released over a year later it featured only minor design changes from the original. Despite the patent filing, it is unknown if Apple will ever bring this design into fruition. Apple is notorious for patenting all sorts of things ( remember the paper bag? ) and not all are followed through on. If Apple does opt for the circular display, it would have to retool the rectangular case and the hardware. \nEven though the Apple Watch is still the most popular wearable out there, the smartwatch market has slowed down compared to last year . As the market leader, a lot of attention is paid to every move Apple makes with the Watch, its only wearable. So far, design changes have come in the form of collaborations with fashion brands such as Hermes and Nike . If we want to see bigger changes, we'll have to wait. \nApple did not immediately respond to CNET's request for comment. Share your voice",

The Nasdaq 100 has seen better days. \nThe index, which is composed of the 100 largest nonfinancial companies in the broader Nasdaq composite, fell more than 1.5 percent Thursday, erasing its post-U.S. election gains, as shares of Apple and the so-called FANG stocks ( Facebook , Amazon , Netflix and Google parent Alphabet ) all fell. \nThe Nasdaq 100's decline began Wednesday, when it dropped 1.3 percent. Entering Wednesday's session, the index had gained 2.4 percent. As of 3 p.m. ET Thursday, the Nasdaq 100 was down about half a percent since Nov. 8.\nNasdaq 100 since Nov. 8 Source: FactSet \nKim Forrest, senior equity analyst at Fort Pitt Capital, said the index was being pressured by rising interest rates in the U.S. On Thursday, U.S. Treasury yields soared to levels not seen since 2015 as a meeting in which the Federal Reserve is likely to tighten monetary policy approached.\n\"Everything points to a rates increase and the bond market is foretelling that,\" she said. \"As the yields increase, that drives the [earnings] multiple lower in those stocks.\"",

      "text": "Apple TV owners generally have a few things in common, without fail. They enjoy the Apple ecosystem, and they probably own one or more other Apple devices as well. Another thing they have in common, however, is that they have almost certainly lost the tiny little remote control that comes with the Apple TV at some point, and been forced to buy a new one from Apple. That wasn’t the worst thing in the world in the past, but now the new Siri Remote that comes with the Apple TV costs $79 to replace. $79! Well guess what: for $20, you can buy a simple accessory that should come in the box with every Apple TV that ships. Use it, and you’ll never lose your Apple TV remote again.\nHere are some key details:\nCOMPATIBILITY: Works with Apple TV (Siri remote), iPhone, iPad mini, Wireless keyboard, Magic mouse. DESIGN: The D Stand Docking station has convenient Lightning cable management, designed to create a more elegant, yet simple apperance in your home.

MATERIAL: The elago D stand middle cylinder is made of solid aluminum to create a sturdier base. The top and bottom are made from scratch-free silicone to prevent damage to your Apple products, and to prevent it from moving around while resting on a surface.

      "text": "12/01/16 AT 4:16 PM Close \nMost mapping is done from the ground level, but Apple is taking to the air. According to a report from Bloomberg , the Cupertino company will utilize drones to improve its Maps service. \nAccording to the report, Apple is in the process of assembling a team of experts in the fields of robotics and data collection who will be tapped to lead the drone initiative. The group will use the unmanned aircrafts to capture landscape and road information from above. \nApple plans to use the drones to pick up additional details like street signs. The company will also use the hovering crafts to keep track of changes to streets and monitor stretches of road that are under construction. \nThe data collected by drones will be used to update the available information in the Apple Maps app. The process is said to be significantly faster for updated information than the company’s current fleet of vehicles , which are regularly sent around the country to capture road information via cameras and sensors. \nApple seems to have been planning on rolling out drones for this purpose for some time; it filed for an exemption with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in September 2015 to use drones for commercial purposes. \nAccording to Bloomberg , the FAA granted approval to Apple on March 22 of this year. The approval gave Apple permission to operate unmanned aircraft for the purposes of data collection, photography and videography. Related Stories Google Vs Apple Maps: App Powered By Google Maps Removed From Store \nIn addition to the adoption of drones, Apple will also start looking inside of buildings to provide more accurate mapping of popular destinations with high foot traffic. \nFor the project, Apple is tapping the team behind the startup Indoor.io, which the computing giant acquired last year. The technology behind Indoor.io uses pressure sensors, GPS, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth—all features available in most smartphones—to track movement inside a confined area. \nThe data gleaned from the indoor tracking project could help Apple craft maps and directions for areas like airports and museums, with the hope of helping people find their gate or destination just like they would with standard car navigation. \nThe investment in new means of data collection could mark a major improvement for Apple Maps, which was widely panned when first released but has been built into a considerable competitor for Google Maps .

Apple will also add new features that improve car navigation and show the inside of buildings, according to Bloomberg. \nApple's Tim Cook was forced to apologize for Apple's Maps function in 2012 when its rollout included glitches and failed to live up to rival Google. Since then, Apple has focused more intensely on its software and services division for mobile users, and is said to be working on software that may one day be used in autonomous vehicles.",

      "text": "Fallen smartphone brand Nokia challenges Apple, Samsung again >> Reuters Published: 2016-12-02 01:31:45.0 BdST Updated: 2016-12-02 01:31:45.0 BdST Women look at their mobile phones in London, Britain October 6, 2016. Reuters People look at their mobile phones at Piccadilly Circus in London, Britain October 6, 2016. Reuters Pedestrians look at their mobile phones near Brick Lane in London, Britain October 5, 2016. Reuters Previous Next Nokia smartphones are poised for a comeback after former managers at the Finnish company licensed the handset brand from Microsoft and struck up partnerships with Google and phone manufacturer Foxconn. \nNokia was once the world's dominant mobile-phone maker but missed the shift to smartphones and then chose Microsoft's unpopular Windows operating system for its \"Lumia\" range. \nNokia quit smartphones in 2014 by selling its handset activities to Microsoft to focus on mobile network equipment. Microsoft continued selling Lumia smartphones under its own name but this year largely abandoned that business, too. \nHMD Global, led by Nokia veteran Arto Nummela, wants to launch its first Nokia smartphone in the early part of next year using Google's Android operating system. People look at their mobile phones at Piccadilly Circus in London, Britain October 6, 2016. Reuters Success will require a dash for scale by stealing business from Apple, Samsung and dozens of other players in a cut-throat industry.\n\"Consumers may be carrying different smartphones now, but are they really in love and loyal to those brands?\" said Nummela in an interview. \nThe Nokia consumer brand lives on as the badge on cheaper, entry-level \"feature phones\" sold mainly in Asia, India and Eastern Europe, though Microsoft invested little to market the name in recent years. Smartphones typically cost anywhere from 10 to 30 times as much as these basic phones, which sell for as little as $20. \n\"For a new entrant, having an established brand provides it with an instant on-ramp,\" said mobile phone analyst Ben Wood of CCS Insight, who suggested that phone vendors with weaker brands should not take the new challenge lightly. \n\"The barriers to entry for the Android phone space are low,\" said Wood. \"What HMD has is the Nokia brand and management experience. The key to its success will be driving scale.\" \nCEO Nummela, who was once responsible for Nokia's sales and product development, does not lack ambition. \n\"We want to be one of the key competitive players in the smartphone business,\" he told Reuters. \nHMD President Florian Seiche previously worked at Siemens, Orange, HTC and Nokia. Chief Marketing Officer Pekka Rantala is a former CEO of Rovio, the maker of the Angry Birds game, as well as a Nokia veteran. \n\"We are not going to skip any markets in the long term,\" Seiche said, adding that HMD had already set up offices in 40 locations around the world. \nNo funding from Nokia Corp \nHMD is owned by Smart Connect LP, a private equity fund run by Jean-Francois Baril, who was once in charge of Nokia's world-leading supply chain management system. Other HMD managers have put in money of their own. Pedestrians look at their mobile phones near Brick Lane in London, Britain October 5, 2016. Reuters HMD on Thursday took over the feature phone business that Nokia Corp sold to Microsoft. It has a licensing deal with Nokia giving it sole use of the brand on mobile phones and tablets for the next decade. It will pay Nokia royalties for the brand and patents, but Nokia has no direct investment in HMD.\nHMD is building its smartphone operating system in partnership with Google and all its Nokia devices will be manufactured by Foxconn of Taiwan, the world's largest contract manufacturer. \nNummela says his team's enduring relationships with phone service providers and retailers could help HMD quickly convince owners of Nokia feature phones to upgrade in markets like India, Indonesia and Russia. \nThe Nokia name is still on a tenth of the feature phones sold around the world, though in recent years it ceded ground to Samsung and TCL, maker of Alcatel-brand phones, as well as smaller players, according to market research firm Strategy Analytics. \nShipments of Nokia feature phones plunged 40 percent in fiscal year 2015 and HMD must reverse that decline while trying to break back into the smartphone market, where hundreds of vendors compete by selling phones that can be hard to distinguish. \n\"The feature phone is the essence of the business,\" Wood said. \"Don't be under any illusions that this market is over.\"",

      "text": "3 hours ago \nApple is taking to the skies. \nThe company plans to use drones to collect aerial information to improve its Maps app, Bloomberg reported Dec. 1. \nApple was granted permission to fly dronesby the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in March, after applying in Sept. 2015. The company’s original application to the FAA does not go into much detail about what it specifically intended to with its drones, saying just that they would do “aerial data collection, photography, and videography,” but that fits within the mapping ambitions Bloomberg reported today. \nApple’s 2015 application says it intends to use 11 different models of drones—some quadcopters, some fixed-wing drones—to capture information. The list includes three models made by the Chinese market leader DJI—a company referred to as the “ Apple of drones “, one from Intel’s AscTec , and three from French manufacturer Parrot’s commercial subsidiary, senseFly. (Apple sells drones manufactured by DJI and Parrot in its stores , but not of the same mapping caliber.) \nThere is no indication that Apple intends to build its own drones, as other technology giants like Google and Facebook are doing. \nBloomberg points out that Apple, like Google, previously used cars filled with sensors to capture information about roadways for its maps. Sources told the publication that drones could drastically speed up the time it takes to collect data, since they don’t have to follow the rules of the road. \nHowever, the FAA is still working on nailing down rules for letting drones fly over people. For now, that means Apple’s drones will only fly over sparsely populated areas, and must stay below 400 feet. \nIt’s not clear whether Apple has actually started flying yet, or if it’s already flying in other countries. The company wasn’t immediately available to comment on its activity. \nApple Maps was originally so poorly received that CEO Tim Cook issued an apology in 2012, and may have fired the former head of its mobile operating system division, Scott Forstall over refusing to apologize for the software’s bugs. In years since, Apple has played catch-up to Google Maps, offering additional functions with every new operating system release, and even winning over some critics. \nBut there are few features that Apple Maps offers that Google Maps doesn’t. If Apple can find a novel way to provide information—perhaps by offering virtual flyovers of every city in the US—then it might be able to win more users over, and into its ecosystem. \nApple is selling fewer iPhones than it has in years. Some believe it might make up for this by locking users more deeply into its world of paid apps, videos and services. Whether drones and maps will help remains to be seen. After all, it could end up being just buzz. Read full story",

      "text": "Apple said to fly drones to improve maps data and catch Google [video]   1:30 PM Mark Gurman, Alan Levin - Bloomberg \nApple plans to use drones and new indoor navigation features to improve its Maps service and catch longtime leader Google, according to people familiar with the matter. \nThe Cupertino, California-based company is assembling a team of robotics and data-collection experts that will use drones to capture and update map information faster than its existing fleet of camera-and-sensor ladened minivans, one of the people said. \nApple wants to fly drones around to do things like examine street signs, track changes to roads and monitor if areas are under construction, the person said. The data collected would be sent to Apple teams that rapidly update the Maps app to provide fresh information to users, the person added. \nApple is also developing new features for Maps, including views inside buildings and improvements to car navigation, another person familiar with the efforts said. The people asked not to be identified talking about private projects. An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment. \nFive years after Google Maps launched on the iPhone, Apple's mapping app was introduced in 2012 with glaring errors like a grocery store marked as a hospital and an incorrect airport address. Apple lacked the technology needed to quickly suck in data from many different sources to evaluate and change the digital maps. \n\"There's a huge data-quality issue there, and I don't think we initially appreciated all the kinds of technology we would need to do that on an ongoing basis,\" Craig Federighi, Apple's senior vice president of software engineering, told Fast Company earlier this year. \nDigital maps are crucial tools for Apple and Google to attract developers that build popular travel, ride-sharing, and retail apps and services that integrate with the companies' mobile operating systems. Collecting accurate data is the most important part of digital map building and Apple's latest moves could help it match the prodigious capabilities of Google in this field. \nSince Apple Maps launched, the company has improved the app by more quickly updating data, adding a mode for navigating public transit systems, improving search results, and opening the platform to outside services such as Uber ride-hailing and OpenTable restaurant reservations. The drone initiative is a continuation of this effort and is unlikely to be related to a commercial Apple drone product. \nApple filed for an exemption on Sept. 21, 2015, from the Federal Aviation Administration to fly drones for commercial purposes, according to documents obtained by Bloomberg News. At that time, exemptions were required to commercially operate drones. In a response dated March 22, 2016, the FAA granted Apple approval to \"operate an unmanned aircraft system to conduct data collection, photography, and videography,\" according to one of the documents. \nApple's application told the FAA that it would use a range of drones sold by companies such as SZ DJI Technology Co. and Aibotix to collect the data. \nOfficial guidelines for commercial drone operation were instated in August, restricting flying to mostly daytime hours and requiring licensed pilots to operate the equipment while keeping the drones in their line of sight. Apple committed to these guidelines, according to the FAA documents. \nThe current rules restrict commercial drones from flying over people and buildings, potentially limiting Apple's initiative for the time being. Apple could meanwhile fly the drones in the U.S. within FAA guidelines and fly without restriction in countries without commercial drone regulations. \nApple has hired at least one person from Amazon.com Inc.'s Prime Air division to help run the drone team, one of the people said. Prime Air is Amazon's initiative to quickly deliver packages via drones. The Apple team is being assembled in Seattle, the same city as Amazon's headquarters, the person said. \nBeyond better data collection, Apple is developing an indoor mapping view that would allow users to navigate airports, and other high-traffic buildings like museums using iPhones, according to another person. \nApple acquired startup Indoor.io last year to help bring its indoor mapping project to market, according to another person familiar with the matter. Apple confirmed the purchase, but declined to say why it did the deal. The company also bought WiFiSlam in 2013, another startup with indoor navigation expertise. \nIndoor location tracking is achieved via a combination of technologies inside the latest iPhones, including pressure sensors, GPS, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth. Apple is also working on a feature that provides better guidance for changing lanes while driving, one of the people said. Both features are planned for release next year but could be held back, the person said. \n---",

      "text": "What is Wi-Fi beamforming and MU-MIMO? \nApple said it took \"courage\" to remove the audio jack port from the iPhone 7 and replace it with wireless audio. Microsoft hasn't yet mustered the courage to cut the aging port. \nMicrosoft has retained the headphone jack as a minimum hardware requirement for Windows 10 Mobile smartphones. The company declined to comment if it would make the headphone jack an optional port. \nThe headphone jack port isn't a requirement for other Windows devices, including laptops, desktops, tablets, or IoT devices. NEWSLETTERS: Get the latest tech news sent directly to your in-box \nApple gave several reasons for removing the port, saying it was old technology, and it blocked the integration of newer technologies in the already compact iPhone 7. \nBefore Apple, Android phone makers like LeEco and Lenovo also cut headset jacks from some mobile devices to move on from legacy technology. \nWindows Mobile phone makers could still include wireless audio alongside headphone jacks. But the phone makers will lose opportunities to make devices thinner and experiment with new technologies to replace the headset jack. \nBeyond wireless audio, there's a big push to make the USB-C port the replacement to headphone jacks. Pushing audio through USB-C port and removing audio jacks will allow smartphones to be thinner. \nIt's important to move on to newer technologies, but Microsoft's hesitance to remove the headphone jack requirement has technical and financial merits, said Bob O'Donnell, principal analyst at Technalysis Research. \nThere was a user backlash when Apple removed headphone jacks from the iPhone 7. People were upset at being forced with the extra cost of buying a wireless headset. Moreover, the wireless headsets have to be charged. \nThe quality of wireless audio isn't as reliable as it is on headphone jacks, O'Donnell said. Apple has, however, developed a special wireless audio chip that delivers audio from the iPhone 7 to the AirPod using three separate communications protocols. That ensures continued high-quality audio streaming. \nMicrosoft still sells Windows phones but has been cryptic about their future. Other Windows phone makers include HP, Acer, Alcatel, and Lenovo. \nSmartphones with Windows have been taken a beating at the hands of iOS and Android. Shipments of Windows phones totaled 1.48 million in the third quarter of 2016, plunging from 5.87 million units in the same quarter a year ago. \nThe market share for Windows Mobile reached a rock-bottom 0.4 percent during the second quarter, declining from 1.7 percent a year ago, according to a report released by Gartner last month. By comparison, Android's market share was 87.8 percent, and iOS's share was 11.5 percent during the third quarter.

      "text": "Apple said to fly drones to improve maps data and catch Google [video]   1:30 PM Mark Gurman, Alan Levin - Bloomberg \nApple plans to use drones and new indoor navigation features to improve its Maps service and catch longtime leader Google, according to people familiar with the matter. \nThe Cupertino, California-based company is assembling a team of robotics and data-collection experts that will use drones to capture and update map information faster than its existing fleet of camera-and-sensor ladened minivans, one of the people said. \nApple wants to fly drones around to do things like examine street signs, track changes to roads and monitor if areas are under construction, the person said. The data collected would be sent to Apple teams that rapidly update the Maps app to provide fresh information to users, the person added. \nApple is also developing new features for Maps, including views inside buildings and improvements to car navigation, another person familiar with the efforts said. The people asked not to be identified talking about private projects. An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment. \nFive years after Google Maps launched on the iPhone, Apple's mapping app was introduced in 2012 with glaring errors like a grocery store marked as a hospital and an incorrect airport address. Apple lacked the technology needed to quickly suck in data from many different sources to evaluate and change the digital maps. \n\"There's a huge data-quality issue there, and I don't think we initially appreciated all the kinds of technology we would need to do that on an ongoing basis,\" Craig Federighi, Apple's senior vice president of software engineering, told Fast Company earlier this year. \nDigital maps are crucial tools for Apple and Google to attract developers that build popular travel, ride-sharing, and retail apps and services that integrate with the companies' mobile operating systems. Collecting accurate data is the most important part of digital map building and Apple's latest moves could help it match the prodigious capabilities of Google in this field. \nSince Apple Maps launched, the company has improved the app by more quickly updating data, adding a mode for navigating public transit systems, improving search results, and opening the platform to outside services such as Uber ride-hailing and OpenTable restaurant reservations. The drone initiative is a continuation of this effort and is unlikely to be related to a commercial Apple drone product. \nApple filed for an exemption on Sept. 21, 2015, from the Federal Aviation Administration to fly drones for commercial purposes, according to documents obtained by Bloomberg News. At that time, exemptions were required to commercially operate drones. In a response dated March 22, 2016, the FAA granted Apple approval to \"operate an unmanned aircraft system to conduct data collection, photography, and videography,\" according to one of the documents. \nApple's application told the FAA that it would use a range of drones sold by companies such as SZ DJI Technology Co. and Aibotix to collect the data. \nOfficial guidelines for commercial drone operation were instated in August, restricting flying to mostly daytime hours and requiring licensed pilots to operate the equipment while keeping the drones in their line of sight. Apple committed to these guidelines, according to the FAA documents. \nThe current rules restrict commercial drones from flying over people and buildings, potentially limiting Apple's initiative for the time being. Apple could meanwhile fly the drones in the U.S. within FAA guidelines and fly without restriction in countries without commercial drone regulations. \nApple has hired at least one person from Amazon.com Inc.'s Prime Air division to help run the drone team, one of the people said. Prime Air is Amazon's initiative to quickly deliver packages via drones. The Apple team is being assembled in Seattle, the same city as Amazon's headquarters, the person said. \nBeyond better data collection, Apple is developing an indoor mapping view that would allow users to navigate airports, and other high-traffic buildings like museums using iPhones, according to another person. \nApple acquired startup Indoor.io last year to help bring its indoor mapping project to market, according to another person familiar with the matter. Apple confirmed the purchase, but declined to say why it did the deal. The company also bought WiFiSlam in 2013, another startup with indoor navigation expertise. \nIndoor location tracking is achieved via a combination of technologies inside the latest iPhones, including pressure sensors, GPS, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth. Apple is also working on a feature that provides better guidance for changing lanes while driving, one of the people said. Both features are planned for release next year but could be held back, the person said. \n---",

(© AP Images) \nApple Corporation is marking World AIDS Day by giving more than 400 of its stores a makeover in red. \nThe U.S. tech giant says stores on five continents are turning their logos red or featuring red window decals on December 1 to raise visibility for World AIDS Day . The logo remake and new product launches support (Red), a multibrand effort to raise money to fight the spread of AIDS in Africa. One focus of the campaign is to end mother-to-child transmission of the disease, thereby achieving a generation that is AIDS-free at birth. \nApple is adding four new (Red)-themed products to its lineup, including iPhone cases and Beats headphones. Apple’s App Store is offering (Red)-themed purchases. The company says it will donate up to $1 million to (Red) from money raised through Apple Pay. \nAccording to the Washington Post , Apple’s partnership with (Red) is part of Apple chief executive Tim Cook’s efforts to expand the company’s philanthropic reach . (Red) was founded by Irish rock star Bono , lead singer of the band U2, and U.S. philanthropist Bobby Shriver in 2006. TAGS",

      "text": "Google Maps is the leader in mobile navigation , thanks to Street View and its early implementation of mass transit maps. Apple, however, could close the gap with a newly approved fleet of drones working by its side.\nAccording to Bloomberg , the iPhone maker is purportedly constructing an arsenal of drones to capture aerial footage in an effort to improve its native Maps app. The drones will be able to better scan street signs and traffic changes in comparison to the fleet of camera-equipped minivans Apple previously utilized.\nApple Maps on the iPad Source: Peter Macdiarmid/Getty Images The report said Apple took the necessary steps to secure approval from the Federal Aviation Administration to collect data with the drones. Apple has yet to say anything about this — Mic has reached out and will update with any comment.\nThe photos and videos captured by Apple's drones could prove invaluable for its navigation software. A source close to the situation told Bloomberg the drones' information would be sent to Apple's team for swift and accurate updates to the Maps app utilized by iOS users all over the world.\nApple suffered early setbacks following the launch of Maps back in 2012. A number of errors and inaccuracies were reported, while Google's app continued to excel. Since then, Apple has steadily improved its program and the application of these drones could further refine its product going forward.",

      "title": "Aero Flux vs Apple AirPods: Which wireless earbuds should you get?",
      "text": "It was recently revealed that Apple is gearing up to ship the highly anticipated AirPods in time for Christmas . Initial excitement for the new device died down after months of delays , but the wireless earbuds are bound to be a hit given Apple's reputation. But perhaps it's not wise to toss your money to the company on the basis of its prestige alone — there are other options, and the Aero Flux wireless earbuds are a prime contender.\nAero Flux vs. Apple AirPods — which are better? Aero Flux wireless earbuds are billed as a cheaper alternative to the AirPods — founder Jack Kim said as much in a profile with Digital Trends . His product is currently available to pre-order for $89 , nearly half of Apple 's $159 AirPods price tag. For the average consumer, that dip in cost will be enticing.\nBut can the Aero Flux stand up to AirPods performance-wise? The two products share a number of similarities: Both utilize a Bluetooth connection to wirelessly transmit sound. Both come equipped with portable charging cases. And both feature intuitive CPUs that pause audio whenever you remove the earbuds. That being said, there are some distinctions that set the two apart.\nA case for the Apple AirPods Apple AirPods Source: Marcio Jose Sanchez/AP The Aero Flux can certainly challenge the AirPods, but the latter has a number of advantages. Most notable is the AirPods' inclusion of Siri , which makes them significantly more useful. With nothing but your voice, you can instruct Siri to place phone calls, adjust volume or search for directions — without ever touching your iPhone .\nThe AirPods also feature some minor spec advantages over the Aero Flux. You get five hours of playback on a single AirPods charge compared to four with the Aero Flux. Additionally, using the charging case will net you 24 hours of total playback; the Aero Flux only grants you 16. And in a pinch, 15 mins of charging can power the AirPods for three hours. Aero Flux hasn't indicated its charging speed, but it's likely its charger won't be able to top that impressive pace.\nLast, but not least, the AirPods will naturally sync with other Apple devices, providing an unparalleled level of convenience.\nA case for the Aero Flux Aero Flux Source: Gadgetsin It's hard to compete with an industry leader like Apple, but the Aero Flux has a few things going for it. For one, these earbuds are water resistant , which will come in extreme handy whenever traveling through inclement weather. Another neat feature is the Aero Flux's ability to connect to two separate devices — one on each earbud. In terms of the sound quality, Aero Flux might have Apple beat. Its \"AeroBoost\" increases bass by up to two times compared to traditional earphones.\nOf course, the primary advantage of the Aero Flux is its cheaper cost. Granted, the earbuds' price will rise to $129 after the pre-order period, but the current $89 price tag is very alluring. You'll get solid wireless audio for a fraction of the AirPods' cost.\nApple AirPods vs. Aero Flux: The verdict When deciding on these two products, it ultimately comes down to what you value the most. Do you want access to a personal assistant and need to seamlessly connect to all of your Apple devices? AirPods are for you. Do you want an affordable pair of Bluetooth earbuds with water resistance? Go with the Aero Flux. Either way, you're acquiring a decent set of headphones for an increasingly wireless world.",

But all of those decisions have valid (if small) design benefits for Apple, so we'll let them stand.\nOne thing that's difficult to explain away is the Pro's lack of graphical power. For a laptop that's supposed to be aimed at creative professionals -- the people who made Macs desirable in the first place -- the Pro is woefully inadequate for video editing, photographers, or anyone who needs more than a glorified netbook.\nContinue reading... \nTrending right now: \nHow to tell if Apple owes you a new iPhone battery 10 paid iPhone apps on sale for free today A 75-year-old’s excellent Tweet may be the only good thing in 2016 ",

      "text": "  Retail Stores Sporting Red Logos for World AIDS Day   2:25 pm PST by Juli Clover Over 400 Apple retail stores around the world have red logos today , in recognition of World AIDS Day. The logos, which Apple has put up at its stores for the last several years on December 1, are meant to raise awareness for the global fight against AIDS. Earlier this week, Apple announced plans to donate $1 to partner charity (RED) for every Apple Pay purchase made at an Apple Store, on Apple.com, or through the Apple Store app as part of a World AIDS Day campaign. Apple has pledged to donate up to $1 million during the event, which will last until December 6. Bank of America is also making a donation for every Apple Pay transaction made using its cards from December 1 to December 7, with plans to donate up to $1 million. In addition to its Apple Pay promotion, Apple has released several new PRODUCT(RED) items over the course of the last month, including an iPhone 7 Smart Battery Case , an iPhone SE case , a Beats Pill+ Portable Speaker , and Beats Solo3 Wireless Headphones . Throughout the year, a portion of the proceeds from PRODUCT(RED) sales goes to The Global Fund to put a stop to AIDS. Several App Store apps are also offering limited-edition custom (RED) content for World AIDS Day, and all in-app purchase proceeds will be donated. Participating apps include popular titles like Best Fiends, Boom Beach, Clash of Clans, Candy Crush Jelly Saga, Farm Heroes Saga, PewDiePie's Tuber Simulator, Hay Day, Plants vs. Zombies Heroes, and more. — (RED) (@RED) December 1, 2016 The (RED) initiative has raised more than $365 million to date to stop AIDS in Ghana, Kenya, Lesotho, Rwanda, South Africa, Swaziland, Tanzania, and Zambia. Funds raised by (RED) are donated to The Global Fund, a group that works to end AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria as epidemics. Apple is one of (RED)'s biggest contributors and has donated nearly $120 million over the last 10 years.",

      "text": "Will Apple's push to collect mapping data with drones help build out and support an ad-targeting network?\nThe iPhone maker will reportedly use drone technology to accelerate data collection and improve the accuracy of locations. There are some parallels to Google Wave, but rather than using human intervention to report on changing road conditions, Apple will do it with drones to examine street signs, track changes to roads and monitor whether areas are under construction. The drones would transmit the information to Apple's Map team, who would update information to users.  \nThe new Maps platform will offer the ability to view inside buildings and have improved car navigation features. The report from Bloomberg comes with information about Apple's September 2015 filing with the Federal Aviation Administration, asking permission to fly drones for commercial purposes. In a response dated March 2016, the FAA granted Apple approval to operate an unmanned craft to collect data, and take still photos and video.\nThe issue for mapmakers is to keep map coverage up to date, said Mike Dobson, president at telemapics.com, which he founded after working at Rand McNally as chief technologist for more than a dozen years. Very accurate data is required to improve ad targeting platforms with the ability to identify exact locations of streets, buildings, transportation targets and more, Dobson said.\nHaving extremely current mapping data, similar to what drones can offer, could certainly help Apple with ad revenue, but Apple and ad revenue do not seem synonymous to Dobson. He said it seems more realistic to think about how the data will help Apple catch up with Google's Mapping platform.\n\"The mere consequence of the friction of distance limits how frequently and how much information companies can gather from diverse geographic areas to update maps more quickly,\" he said.",

      "text": "Apple Allegedly Reduces iPhone 7 Orders as Sales Momentum Starts to Fade [Report] LIKE MORE Posted 50 minutes ago by iClarified · 597 views · Translate Apple has allegedly started to reduce iPhone 7 orders as sales momentum begins to fade, reports DigiTimes. Sources in Taiwan tell the site that initial demand was driven by the new jet black iPhone 7 models and the recalled Samsung Galaxy Note 7. Demand for the iPhone 7 devices in China and other markets has scaled down significantly since their launch less than three months ago, the sources noted. Notably, component suppliers and consumers are said to have already begun shifting focus to the next generation iPhone. Market rumors have indicated that the next generation iPhone will come with OLED displays, glass cases, dual-lens cameras, enhanced CPUs, and advanced sensors, while supporting mixed reality (MR) and wireless charging technologies. Due to the high expectations for Apple's tenth anniversary iPhone, suppliers are conservative on iPhone 7 shipments for the first half of 2017. It's expected that shipments during this period will be at least 5 million less than those shipped in the last half of 2016.We've been hearing reports for some time that the 10th anniversary iPhone will be a major update. It will purportedly have a front glass cover and chassis, joined by a metal bezel and an edge-to-edge display that has no bezels on the top and bottom. Additionally, the front camera, Touch ID, speaker, and other sensors will apparently be embedded into the display . Another report claimed that the device would be a clear piece of glass with a next-generation OLED screen. More recently, Apple is said to have be equipping the phone with wireless charging and a 3D camera .Are you holding off on the iPhone 7 in favor of the next year's new model?

      "text": "12/01/16 AT 6:55 PM Close \nVideo may have killed the radio star, but radio is looking for its revenge. iHeartMedia, the largest terrestrial radio company in the United States, announced two new streaming services that will go head-to-head with the biggest names in digital music. \nThe new services, which entered beta on Thursday, offer listeners two tiers of listening options. The first is iHeartRadio Plus, a $5 per month subscription service that acts as a sort of souped-up version of the existing radio streaming app. \nWith Plus, users will have the option of replaying songs heard on their favorite stations before jumping back into the live station. Users will also have the ability save individual songs and full artist radio stations to listen offline. Plus members will be granted unlimited skips to blow past songs they don’t want to hear on artist stations. \nIn addition to the Plus tier, there’s the $10 per month iHeartRadio All Access. Powered by Napster, All Access goes directly at the biggest competitors in the streaming music space: Spotify and Apple . \niHeartRadio All Access provides a full music library that can be accessed at any time. It’s linked seamlessly to the existing radio app so when a listener hears a track they enjoy on the radio, a single tap immediately adds that song to their music collection. \nAll Access also offers offline listening and complete control over playlist building, and no limitations on music playback—all fairly standard features for a streaming service in 2016. \nFor iHeartRadio All Access, the killer feature is really the interconnectivity between the radio and the streaming library. In a 2015 study by Edison Research and Triton Digital , 69 percent of people reported still using the radio as their primary method of music discovery. Tying that directly to the streaming service, so users can quickly tag a song they like as they hear it on a radio broadcast, may be a standout option for prospective listeners. Related Stories Give The Gift Of Streaming Music \nApple has tried to create a similar service, building out its own radio station with Beats 1 Radio . The computing giant grabbed top name talent to host shows on the platform and makes it easy to find songs played on the station in the linked Apple Music app, but it’s a singular station. \niHeartRadio allows listeners to browse through any of the 850 radio stations in 150 markets that are encompassed under the iHeart umbrella. \nThe streaming library of Napster will make iHeartRadio competitive with Apple and Spotify for the most part, though we don’t know exactly what songs will be available—iHeartRadio simply announced it was “ millions .” Where iHeartRadio may struggle is with exclusive songs, albums, and artists . Apple, Spotify, and Tidal are in constant competition for new music in hopes of hosting it on their own platform first or exclusively. \nHowever, the connection to the radio may help work around this problem slightly. Music that is only available to stream on specific platforms would still be available to listen to via iHeartRadio’s actual radio stations, and users would be able to reply those songs when heard on the radio.

      "text": "Apple developing iCar to rival Tesla’s electric SUVs By Harsh Soni Dec 01, 2016 01:31 PM EST Advertisement Apple is hinting about the iCar, their brand's electric sports car.(Photo by Tomohiro Ohsumi/Getty Images) \nAdvertisement \n\nReports are suggesting that Apple is developing an electric iCar to rival Tesla. Apple Inc., manufacturer of the ever so popular iMac, Macbook Pros, iPods and iPads, have been rumored to be developing a new smart car, codenamed Project Titan. \nSince February of last year, various reports leaked about the development of iCar and fans have been speculating for a while now. Advertisement \nWhether Apple is developing an iCar to rival Tesla electric sedans and SUVs is still a source of energetic discussions since there is still no official statement from Apple. Rumors have it that parts of the iCar will be developed in Berlin, according to Trusted Reviews . \nAccording to the German media, Apple has been in touch with companies that specialize in manufacturing car charging stations. \nBloomberg reported that Apple and \"Project Titan\" team also hired a number of former BlackBerry engineers as part of a new Canadian office in Kanata, a suburb of Ottawa. This will help in strengthening many people's belief that an Apple iCar is really in the making. \nDuring the Apple Q4 2016 financial results, Apple CEO Tim Cook replied on the question regarding the Apple Car by saying, \"Always looks for ways that we can improve the experience and the customers' experience on different sets of products.\" \n\"We are always looking at new things, and the car space, in general, is an area that it's clear that there is a lot of technologies that will either become available or will be able to revolutionize the car experience,\" he added. \nVarious rumors suggest that the iCar will be completed on 2019 and will be due for release by 2021 . \nMeanwhile, Nvidia already had talks of having tie-ups with Tesla, a move by both companies can make their lead even further in smart car. Corning, the manufacturer of the Gorilla Glass, is also contributing in smart car production as well. They are integrating their technology that will provide the Gorilla glass for smart car windshields.",

      "text": "Advertisement Apple iMac 2017: Features include Intel Kaby Lake or Xeon chip, 27-inch 5K Display with VR support By Rida Dec 01, 2016 12:22 PM EST Apple iMac 2017 to boast Intel Kaby Lake or Xeon chip and 27-inch 5K Display with VR support. Advertisement Apple iMac enthusiasts are indeed waiting for the new update over its previous model. Earlier rumored to be iMac 2016 is now speculated to be the iMac 2017. Many reports hitting the internet, indicates that the new iMac likely to be launched in the next Apple event of 2017. Earlier, it was speculated that the Apple will launch its iMac 2016 in any of the three events held in this year. However, no single word was mentioned about the iMac 2016. Some rumors suggested that Apple knowingly delayed the iMac computers as a result of delay in the Intel's new chipset Kaby Lake processor. Advertisement According to Christian Times , it is reported that Apple new iMac computer is rumored to feature Intel Xeon processor instead of Kaby Lake processor. It is reported that the Intel's Xeon processors have been widely used as a common processing chip for high-end workstations and servers. The ability of the Intel Xeon processor is reportedly the best one which supports error-correcting code memory. This feature paves way for an extremely enhanced computing performance. Other report indicates that the iMac 2017 will feature the Intel Core i7 Kaby Lake 7700 processor and the leaked benchmark tests shows the results are exciting. So, the enthusiasts need to wait until Apple makes an official statement on which processor likely to fit-in the new iMac 2017. Another major challenge to Apple Inc. is the Microsoft Surface Studio with the 28-inch screen having fold down ability in-order to make it easier for artists to draw on it. Plus, the Surface makes use of touch input, a stylus and the Dial. Surface Studio is the attraction in the current tech market with respect to the segment of desktop computers. Advertisement According to The BitBag , It is reported that the new iMac 2017 will have a high-end 27-inch variant featuring a 5K display with virtual reality (VR) support, a newly introduced organic light-emitting diode (OLED) Touch Bar as seen in the MacBook Pro 2016. Thus, a final statement from Apple Inc. is indeed important for the rumors to become a reality. © 2016 HNGN , All rights reserved. Do not reproduce without permission.",

      "text": "The China Consumer Association has asked Apple to step up efforts to replace problematic iPhone models, particularly on the iPhone 6s smartphones. Apple is replacing batteries for iPhone 6s models that shut down unexpectedly. Apple had said that the issue affects a very small number of units . The replacement batteries were offered only for phones manufactured between September and October 2015.\nThe China Consumer Association does not agree though, and says that it received lots of calls from frustrated consumers who were facing problems with their phones, according to a report in Shanghai Daily .\nThe association has asked Apple to increase its efforts at replacing iPhone 6, iPhone 6 plus and the iPhone 6S plus models as well. The association disagrees with Apple on the number of devices affected, and has asked Apple to make the process easier for its customers. Apparently a customer in a Shanghai store was asked to go to the US to get a replacement.\nThe move comes just after Apple initiated a repair program for phones suffering from “ touch disease ,” a problem where the screen of the phone turns unresponsive, starts flickering, and has issues with multi-touch. The iPhone 6 Plus model was affected by the touch disease. Apple has replaced batteries on earlier phone models as well. Some Apple iPhone 5 units, a limited series number according to Apple, were running out of battery life rapidly, requiring frequent recharges. The exchange program was active till this year. \nThe post China Consumers Association asks Apple to escalate battery replacement appeared first on Tech2 .",

      "title": "Apple Reportedly Using Drones to Improve Maps Data and Catch Google",
      "text": "Apple Reportedly Using Drones to Improve Maps Data and Catch Up With Google Apple is said to deploy its own drones to better its Maps service Apple Maps was introduced in 2012 Apple filed for an exemption on Sept. 21, 2015, from the FAA \nApple plans to use drones and new indoor navigation features to improve its Maps service and catch longtime leader Google, according to people familiar with the matter. \nThe Cupertino, California-based company is assembling a team of robotics and data-collection experts that will use drones to capture and update map information faster than its existing fleet of camera-and-sensor ladened minivans, one of the people said. \nApple wants to fly drones around to do things like examine street signs, track changes to roads and monitor if areas are under construction, the person said. The data collected would be sent to Apple teams that rapidly update the Maps app to provide fresh information to users, the person added. \nApple is also developing new features for Maps , including views inside buildings and improvements to car navigation, another person familiar with the efforts said. The people asked not to be identified talking about private projects. An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment. Five years after Google Maps launched on the iPhone, Apple's mapping app was introduced in 2012 with glaring errors like a grocery store marked as a hospital and an incorrect airport address. Apple lacked the technology needed to quickly suck in data from many different sources to evaluate and change the digital maps.\n\"There's a huge data-quality issue there, and I don't think we initially appreciated all the kinds of technology we would need to do that on an ongoing basis,\" Craig Federighi, Apple's senior vice president of software engineering, told Fast Company earlier this year. \nDigital maps are crucial tools for Apple and Google to attract developers that build popular travel, ride-sharing, and retail apps and services that integrate with the companies' mobile operating systems. Collecting accurate data is the most important part of digital map building and Apple's latest moves could help it match the prodigious capabilities of Google in this field. \nSince Apple Maps launched, the company has improved the app by more quickly updating data, adding a mode for navigating public transit systems, improving search results, and opening the platform to outside services such as Uber ride-hailing and OpenTable restaurant reservations. The drone initiative is a continuation of this effort and is unlikely to be related to a commercial Apple drone product. \nApple filed for an exemption on September 21, 2015, from the Federal Aviation Administration to fly drones for commercial purposes, according to documents obtained by Bloomberg News. At that time, exemptions were required to commercially operate drones. In a response dated March 22, 2016, the FAA granted Apple approval to \"operate an unmanned aircraft system to conduct data collection, photography, and videography,\" according to one of the documents. \nApple's application told the FAA that it would use a range of drones sold by companies such as SZ DJI Technology Co. and Aibotix to collect the data. \nOfficial guidelines for commercial drone operation were instated in August, restricting flying to mostly daytime hours and requiring licensed pilots to operate the equipment while keeping the drones in their line of sight. Apple committed to these guidelines, according to the FAA documents. \nThe current rules restrict commercial drones from flying over people and buildings, potentially limiting Apple's initiative for the time being. Apple could meanwhile fly the drones in the US within FAA guidelines and fly without restriction in countries without commercial drone regulations. \nApple has hired at least one person from Amazon.com Inc.'s Prime Air division to help run the drone team, one of the people said. Prime Air is Amazon's initiative to quickly deliver packages via drones. The Apple team is being assembled in Seattle, the same city as Amazon's headquarters, the person said. \nBeyond better data collection, Apple is developing an indoor mapping view that would allow users to navigate airports, and other high-traffic buildings like museums using iPhones, according to another person. \nApple acquired startup Indoor.io last year to help bring its indoor mapping project to market, according to another person familiar with the matter. Apple confirmed the purchase, but declined to say why it did the deal. The company also bought WiFiSlam in 2013, another startup with indoor navigation expertise. \nIndoor location tracking is achieved via a combination of technologies inside the latest iPhones, including pressure sensors, GPS, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth. Apple is also working on a feature that provides better guidance for changing lanes while driving, one of the people said. Both features are planned for release next year but could be held back, the person said. \n© 2016 Bloomberg L.P.",

      "text": "Unlike most of its other products, Apple had an infamous launch of its Maps, marred by faulty software that irked users, and it probably helped elevate the popularity of the Google Maps even further. It has been over four years, and Apple is now planning to deploy drones to beat Google when it comes to Maps.\nSo, Apple plans to use drones along with some new indoor features to help improve its Maps service, Bloomberg reports , citing people familiar with the matter. Apple has also acquired a startup Indoor.io for interior mapping project. Needless to say, Google has been working on indoor mapping for sometime now.\nNow, Apple is said to be assembling a team that will build drones along with data collection experts.The drones will update the map information faster than the current fleet minivans that do so using cameras and sensors. Interestingly, Apple is also working on new features such as better car navigation and improved indoor navigation too.\nApple launched its mapping app while Google Maps was available for iOS users. The Maps weren’t efficient , and in fact, quite erroneous. Some flaws of the Maps app were outright dangerous. For instance, an Airfield, a 35-acre estate with working farm and café in centre of his constituency in Dundrum, Ireland, has been labelled as an actual airfield, which could be very dangerous for pilots. The Maps showed so much erroneous data that users went ahead and created a Tumblr blog sarcastically named The Amazing iOS 6 Maps on which many had posted screenshots of the errors.\nToday, Maps make an important tool to assist in our digital lives. It is important for companies like Google and Apple to attract developers to build services such as ride-sharing, retail apps and so on. And, with this move, Apple wants to ensure it beats Google at the game.\nThe post Apple deploys drones to collect data and beat Google Maps appeared first on Tech2 .",

      "text": "Apple iPhone 7 Plus \nApple Pay is Apple’s contactless payment service, and it’s available to the iPhone 6/6S, 6/6S Plus , iPhone SE , and the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus . The service, like Android Pay, requires stores to have NFC terminals at checkout so that you can simply tap your phone to make a payment. \nWhile Apple was hardly the first with contactless payments, the company’s solution has banks, stores, and companies jumping on the bandwagon and pledging their support for Apple Pay. It seems as if new partners are joining every day, so we’ve put together this handy list of all the major partners, which we’ll update as more are added. Here are all the brands and countries that support Apple Pay. Apple Pay around the world \nInitially, Apple Pay only worked in the United States, but Apple is interested in bringing the service to users in many countries. Apple has to prioritize which countries it will reach first, as the company has to take several factors into account. Apple evaluates credit and debit card penetration, the current infrastructure in place for mobile payments, and the popularity of iPhones in each country. \nWhether or not Amex and Visa cards are accepted in each country is also part of the vetting process, because both credit card providers are partners with Apple Pay. Their presence in any given country speeds up Apple Pay adoption. Indeed, that’s likely why so many countries kick off Apple Pay launches with limited support for Amex and Visa cards only. \nSpain \nSpain is the latest country to get Apple Pay support, and you can add credit or debit cards from Carrefour, American Express, Banco Santander, and Ticket Restaurant. The service also supports Mastercard. \nApple says more than 25 major vendors accept Apple Pay, including Media Markt, Starbucks, Bershka, Zara, Repsol, and Pull & Bear. \nSingapore \nApple users in Singapore have been able to use Apple Pay since the summer of 2016, but now HSBC customers can use it as well. The banking institution is offering a promotion for its customers that use Apple Pay — link an HSBC credit card to get $5 off every transaction that’s $10 or more. This offer will last until January 15. \nOther banks in Singapore that support Apple Pay are United Overseas Bank, Standard Chartered, OCBC Bank, POSB Bank, American Express, and DBS Bank. \nJapan \nOne of the rockier rollouts took place in Japan , where Apple Pay debuted after much anticipation on Oct. 25. Commuters had a difficult time loading their train passes onto their iPhones on the morning after major railways began accepting Apple Pay. Luckily, most services were restored after a couple hours. East Japan Railway Co. noted that much of the disruption was due to “the large number of attempts to access the service,” so it certainly looks as though Apple Pay has come to an eager audience. \nAt Apple’s September 7 event, the company announced that it was bringing Apple Pay to Japan. Of course, in Japan, they actually use a different technology to NFC, so along with the launch of Apple Pay in the country, Apple will also be selling the iPhone 7 with support for a technology called Felica — it’s very similar to Bluetooth, but the broader point is that the iPhone will now support Apple Pay in Japan. \nThe list of supported institutions are too great to mention, but you can check them out here . \nRussia \nOn Oct. 4, 2016, Apple Pay expanded its services to Russia . Mastercard is supported, and you can add cards from Alfa-Bank, Bank “Otkritie”, Bank Saint-Petersburg, MDM Bank, MTS Bank, Otkritie, Raiffeisenbank, Rocketbank, Russian Standard Bank, Sberbank, Tinkoff Bank, Tochka, VTB 24, and Yandex.Money. \nFrance \nApple launched support in France in July 2016. Apple Pay works with Visa and MasterCard, and you can add credit and debit cards from Carrefour Banque, Banque Populaire, Caisse d’Épargne, Edenred (Ticket Restaurant cards), Boon, and Orange Cash. \nSwitzerland \nIn July 2016, Switzerland got Apple Pay support. The service works with credit cards issued by Bonus Card, Cornercard, Swiss Bankers, and Swisscard. \nHong Kong \nIn Hong Kong, Apple Pay is compatible with Mastercard, Visa, and American Express accounts. Supported banks within the country include the Bank of China, Hang Seng Bank, HSBC, The Bank of East Asia, Standard Chartered, DBS Bank, HSBC, HKT Payment Limited, and “soon” Tap & Go. Apple Pay launched in the country in August 2016. \nAustralia and New Zealand \nApple is having some trouble getting major banks in Australia to sign up for the service, but at least ANZ is supported. American Express cards are also supported, as well as those from other institutions such as The Bank of Sydney, Bank Australia, The Mac, and more. You can read the full list here . \nANZ is the only supported bank in New Zealand at the moment. \nCanada \nApple Pay came to Canada late last year, but it only available to a handful of banks. A bigger expansion in early 2016 made the service more prevalent . American Express cards are supported, as well as ones from banks like ATB, Bank of Montreal, Canadian Tire, CIBC, Desjardins, President’s Choice, the Royal Bank of Canada, Scotiabank, Tangerine, and TD. \nU.K. \nThe U.K. was the first country to get Apple Pay after it launched in the U.S. It’s compatible with American Express cards, and more than 20 banks currently support the service including Barclays, Bank fo Scotland, Halifax, HSBC, Lloyds, Barclaycard, Boon, Cash Passport, Clydesdale Bank, First Direct, M&S Bank, MBNA, Metro Bank, Nationwide Building Society, NatWest, Royal Bank of Scotland, Santander, Tesco Bank, The Co-operative Bank, TSB, Ulster Bank, and Yorkshire Bank. \nChina \nAlthough cracking the Chinese payments market is considered extremely tough, Apple Pay got a boost from the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, which is the biggest lender in the country, Reuters reported. In total, Apple has 19 of China’s biggest banks on-board, and around 80 percent of Chinese credit and debit cards will work on the service from the get-go. The main disadvantage Apple faces in the country is the prevalence of other mobile payment services like Alibaba’s AliPay, WeChat, and UnionPay. You can see the full list of supported banks here .",

      "title": "Public Access - Apple Removes The SD Card Slot On New Macbook Pro, But Does It Really Matter?",
      "text": "Share Save After years of rumors, Apple finally unveiled a new Macbook Pro in October 2016. The devices went on sale soon after the initial announcement. Apple made a variety of changes and upgrades to its popular device family, and not everyone is happy about them. For instance, a touchscreen is still absent on the company's non-tablet machines. Many consumers are upset about the lack of upgradeable internals as well. Key Specifications Three models of the Macbook Pro are available to consumers, including two 13-inch models and one 15-inch model. Both 13-inch models come standard with current-generation \"Skylake\" Intel Core i5 processors and 8GB of RAM. On the other hand, the high-end 15-inch Macbook Pro features a Core i7 processor and 16GB of RAM. Internal storage options include 256 and 512GB solid-state drives, or a 1TB SSD. The New Touch Bar Consumers have complained for years about the lack of a touchscreen on Macbooks. To appease consumers somewhat, Apple included a Touch Bar and TouchID fingerprint sensor. The Touch Bar, an OLED touch strip, replaces the function keys above the keyboard. Options on the Touch Bar change based on on-screen context, giving users more ways to interact with the Macbook Pro. However, Touch Bar is absent on the base 13-inch model. What else is \"wrong\" with the new Macbook Pro? Nonetheless, the biggest issue for some seems to involve the SD card slot. Previous generations of the Macbook Pro featured this particular port. The newest Macbook Pros feature nothing more than two or four USB-C ports and a headphone jack. Therefore, users must rely upon USB-C or wireless data transfers, including cloud storage. Most users won't care about this change, but it does matter for many individuals. Apple deemed the SD card slot ugly and cumbersome, so it removed the popular port. Average consumers won't think twice about the port's disappearance. For power users and storage hogs, a missing SD card slot could mean countless headaches. 256GB of internal storage isn't that much, and 1TB isn't beyond the realm of being filled up. An SD card allows for easy file transfers and act as extra storage space for users. Photographers and video editors will suffer the most from this change. They're constantly filling up storage drives and attempting to transfer files. Likewise, a music lover could find themselves without a convenient music storage and transfer option. Serious Macbook Pro users, also known as those most likely to buy a Macbook Pro, could see themselves sticking with the laptop they have instead of upgrading. A Move That Makes Sense Nonetheless In the end, Apple axing the SD card slot makes sense from the company's perspective. SD cards sticking out the side of the Macbook Pro look ugly, and Apple loves a clean hardware look. Removing the slot cleans things up from a design perspective and allows the company to turn a profit through sales of higher-end Macbook Pro models (with more storage). Without a doubt, such moves will anger a segment of Macbook users, but that's par for the course with Apple, and that's not necessarily a bad thing. 0 Shares ",

      "title": "Researchers bypass Apple's iOS Activation Lock on iPhone and iPad",
      "text": "Researchers bypass Apple's iOS Activation Lock on iPhone and iPad   09:25 pm PT (12:25 am ET) Researchers in a pair of reports that surfaced this week claim to have successfully bypassed Apple's Activation Lock security feature using a heretofore unknown bug, potentially leaving iPad and iPhone devices open to attack. Security researcher Hemanth Joseph was first to document the vulnerability in November , saying he stumbled across the bug while trying to bypass Activation Lock on an iPad he purchased from eBay. In short, Joseph discovered a method of crashing the security software layer by entering an excessively long string of characters in iPad's Wi-Fi setup text fields. Activation Lock was designed and deployed with iOS 7 to prevent thieves or other unauthorized users from accessing a stolen or lost iOS device. Enabled automatically when Find My iPhone is activated, the system stores an owner's Apple ID on an offsite activation server for later verification. Once enabled, any user wishing to gain device access, turn off Find My iPhone, erase the device or reactivate it must input the correct credentials. Since the deactivation process cross-checks Apple ID and password information with Apple's servers, an internet connection must first be established. This is where Joseph discovered a workaround of sorts. When a locked device is turned on, iOS will prompt a user to connect to a nearby Wi-Fi network. Joseph was able to create an overflow error in the Activation Lock layer by selecting \"Other Network\" and entering a long string of text in the \"Name,\" \"Username\" and \"Password\" fields, each of which contains no character limit. A single overflow error, which freezes iOS, is apparently not enough to bypass Activation Lock. However, Joseph was able to crash the security app layer completely by closing and opening iPad's Smart Cover, which in turn granted him access to the device home screen. Apple remedied Joseph's Activation Lock bypass with the release of iOS 10.1.1 in October, but SecurityWeek reports researchers at Vulnerability Labs were able to recreate the exploit using iOS screen rotation and Night Shift mode. In the proof of concept video above, the bypass variant only allows home screen access for a brief moment, but Vulnerability Labs founder Benjamin Kunz-Mejri said that time window can be extended by quickly pressing the power button. Further, Kunz-Mejri claims the Activation Lock workaround also works on iPhone. Whether Apple is aware of the bypass and subsequently closed the security hole in its upcoming iOS 10.2 release is unknown at this time. Topics:",

      "text": "Apple dresses up stores with red logos, employees wear red shirts for World AIDS Day   05:18 pm PT (08:18 pm ET) Apple on Thursday tinted red the iconic backlit logos installed outside brick-and-mortar stores around the world, continuing a long-standing tradition in support of World AIDS Day, which falls on Dec. 1. Fifth Avenue Apple store logo dressed in red. | Source: Instagram user way2sexy4u As in years past, more than 400 Apple outlets from New York to China are now fronted with red signage, while employees inside wear red shirts instead of the standard blue uniform. The changes commemorate Apple's partnership with the Project(RED) charity, an initiative cofounded by U2's Bono to raise awareness and funds to stop the spread of HIV/AIDS in Africa. Apple, along with a number of other major product makers and retailers, creates special Product(RED) branded items and donates a portion of the purchase price to The Global Fund. Apple first collaborated with the charity in 2006 , later mandating the annual store logo color change in 2012 . This year Apple launched a few new accessories and special edition devices as part of the effort. Headlining the 2016 Product(RED) lineup are red versions of the Beats Solo3 Wireless headphones and Pill+ Bluetooth speaker. Apple is also marketing a red iPhone 7 Smart Battery Case and red leather-backed iPhone SE Case. In addition to hardware, the company is donating $1 —up to a cap of $1 million —for every Apple Pay transaction made at an Apple store, on Apple.com, or through the Apple Store app from now through Dec. 6. Bank of America is making an identical pledge for every Apple Pay transaction involving its various credit cards. For its digital stores, Apple partnered with app makers to deliver (RED) branded in-app purchases for 20 popular games, while iTunes is accepting direct donations. Music act The Killers is also donating proceeds of its holiday album \"Don't Waste Your Wishes\" and their cover of \"I'll Be Home for Christmas\" to the (RED) initiative. Apple CEO Tim Cook in an interview this week defended the company's Product (RED) promotions against assertions that the charitable partnership was born out of pure self-interest . \"We'll always help the most people through our products, because they empower people to do great things themselves,\" Cook said. \"But this (RED) partnership allows us to touch a group of people we normally wouldn't. Sub-Saharan Africa is not a big marketplace for us. This is about trying to lift people up.\" Topics:",

      "text": "apple pay partners news wwdc roundup More Apple Pay is Apple’s contactless payment service, and it’s available to the iPhone 6/6S, 6/6S Plus , iPhone SE , and the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus . The service, like Android Pay, requires stores to have NFC terminals at checkout so that you can simply tap your phone to make a payment.\nWhile Apple was hardly the first with contactless payments, the company’s solution has banks, stores, and companies jumping on the bandwagon and pledging their support for Apple Pay. It seems as if new partners are joining every day, so we’ve put together this handy list of all the major partners, which we’ll update as more are added. Here are all the brands and countries that support Apple Pay.\nApple Pay around the world Initially, Apple Pay only worked in the United States, but Apple is interested in bringing the service to users in many countries. Apple has to prioritize which countries it will reach first, as the company has to take several factors into account. Apple evaluates credit and debit card penetration, the current infrastructure in place for mobile payments, and the popularity of iPhones in each country.\nWhether or not Amex and Visa cards are accepted in each country is also part of the vetting process, because both credit card providers are partners with Apple Pay. Their presence in any given country speeds up Apple Pay adoption. Indeed, that’s likely why so many countries kick off Apple Pay launches with limited support for Amex and Visa cards only.\nSpain\nSpain is the latest country to get Apple Pay support, and you can add credit or debit cards from Carrefour, American Express, Banco Santander, and Ticket Restaurant. The service also supports Mastercard.\nApple says more than 25 major vendors accept Apple Pay, including Media Markt, Starbucks, Bershka, Zara, Repsol, and Pull & Bear.\nSingapore\nApple users in Singapore have been able to use Apple Pay since the summer of 2016, but now HSBC customers can use it as well. The banking institution is offering a promotion for its customers that use Apple Pay — link an HSBC credit card to get $5 off every transaction that’s $10 or more. This offer will last until January 15.\nOther banks in Singapore that support Apple Pay are United Overseas Bank, Standard Chartered, OCBC Bank, POSB Bank, American Express, and DBS Bank.\nJapan\nOne of the rockier rollouts took place in Japan , where Apple Pay debuted after much anticipation on Oct. 25. Commuters had a difficult time loading their train passes onto their iPhones on the morning after major railways began accepting Apple Pay. Luckily, most services were restored after a couple hours. East Japan Railway Co. noted that much of the disruption was due to “the large number of attempts to access the service,” so it certainly looks as though Apple Pay has come to an eager audience.\nAt Apple’s September 7 event, the company announced that it was bringing Apple Pay to Japan. Of course, in Japan, they actually use a different technology to NFC, so along with the launch of Apple Pay in the country, Apple will also be selling the iPhone 7 with support for a technology called Felica — it’s very similar to Bluetooth, but the broader point is that the iPhone will now support Apple Pay in Japan.\nThe list of supported institutions are too great to mention, but you can check them out here .\nRussia\nOn Oct. 4, 2016, Apple Pay expanded its services to Russia . Mastercard is supported, and you can add cards from Alfa-Bank, Bank “Otkritie”, Bank Saint-Petersburg, MDM Bank, MTS Bank, Otkritie, Raiffeisenbank, Rocketbank, Russian Standard Bank, Sberbank, Tinkoff Bank, Tochka, VTB 24, and Yandex.Money.\nFrance\nApple launched support in France in July 2016. Apple Pay works with Visa and MasterCard, and you can add credit and debit cards from Carrefour Banque, Banque Populaire, Caisse d’Épargne, Edenred (Ticket Restaurant cards), Boon, and Orange Cash.\nSwitzerland\nIn July 2016, Switzerland got Apple Pay support. The service works with credit cards issued by Bonus Card, Cornercard, Swiss Bankers, and Swisscard.\nHong Kong\nIn Hong Kong, Apple Pay is compatible with Mastercard, Visa, and American Express accounts. Supported banks within the country include the Bank of China, Hang Seng Bank, HSBC, The Bank of East Asia, Standard Chartered, DBS Bank, HSBC, HKT Payment Limited, and “soon” Tap & Go. Apple Pay launched in the country in August 2016.\nRead More Australia and New Zealand\nApple is having some trouble getting major banks in Australia to sign up for the service, but at least ANZ is supported. American Express cards are also supported, as well as those from other institutions such as The Bank of Sydney, Bank Australia, The Mac, and more. You can read the full list here .\nANZ is the only supported bank in New Zealand at the moment.\nCanada\nApple Pay came to Canada late last year, but it only available to a handful of banks. A bigger expansion in early 2016 made the service more prevalent . American Express cards are supported, as well as ones from banks like ATB, Bank of Montreal, Canadian Tire, CIBC, Desjardins, President’s Choice, the Royal Bank of Canada, Scotiabank, Tangerine, and TD.\nU.K.\nThe U.K. was the first country to get Apple Pay after it launched in the U.S. It’s compatible with American Express cards, and more than 20 banks currently support the service including Barclays, Bank fo Scotland, Halifax, HSBC, Lloyds, Barclaycard, Boon, Cash Passport, Clydesdale Bank, First Direct, M&S Bank, MBNA, Metro Bank, Nationwide Building Society, NatWest, Royal Bank of Scotland, Santander, Tesco Bank, The Co-operative Bank, TSB, Ulster Bank, and Yorkshire Bank.\nChina\nAlthough cracking the Chinese payments market is considered extremely tough, Apple Pay got a boost from the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, which is the biggest lender in the country, Reuters reported. In total, Apple has 19 of China’s biggest banks on-board, and around 80 percent of Chinese credit and debit cards will work on the service from the get-go. The main disadvantage Apple faces in the country is the prevalence of other mobile payment services like Alibaba’s AliPay, WeChat, and UnionPay. You can see the full list of supported banks here .\nRelated: Tim Cook says money will be forgotten by history, thanks to Apple Pay\nWe’ll keep you updated as more countries support Apple Pay.\nMore and more banks support Apple Pay Apple inked deals with the four major U.S. credit and debit card providers early on: Visa, Mastercard, Discover, and American Express. Apple also has the support of more than 1,500 banks and credit unions in the U.S. as of December, 2016 . Users can even send money transfers from Apple Pay at Western Union locations.\nIn August 2016 , Apple added a ton of both traditional banks and credit unions to the list of supported Apple Pay partners, including smaller banks like the Bank of St. Francisville and the Billings Federal Credit Union. Safe to say with these additions, Apple wants everyone in the U.S. to be able to experience Apple Pay.\nIn October 2016 , Apple again added to its ever-growing roster of banks and credit unions in the U.S., and also announced support for Visa and debit cards for Canadian Desjardins customers. Apple Pay has been made available to 26 new banks in the U.S., as well as The Co-operative Bank and Metro Bank in the U.K., bringing the British total to 22. Taiwan looks to be up next for Apple Pay domination, as the four largest financial institutions in the nation appear to be preparing for the contactless payment service.\nIn November 2016, Apple updated its list of supported Apple Pay banks to include nine newcomers in China, four in Russia, and more than 30 in Australia. Twenty-eight additional banks and credit unions in the U.S. were also added. F or a full list of supported banks, check out Apple’s website .\nRelated: Apple Pay: What is it and how do I use it? We explain\nBack in February 2015 at the White House Summit on Cybersecurity and Consumer Protection , CEO Tim Cook announced that Apple Pay will soon support government employees’ credit cards, federal benefit cards for veterans, and social security benefit cards. According to Bloomberg , the government’s deal with Apple Pay includes the Direct Express payment network and government cards from GSA SmartPay.\nAt the summit, Cook also hinted that Apple Pay will replace every card in your wallet one day — even drivers’ licenses.\n“We can imagine a day the not-so-distant future when your wallet becomes a remnant of the past,” he said. “Your passport, your driver’s license, and other important documents can be digitally stored in a way that’s safe, secure, and easy to access.”\nNon-traditional banking and payment companies are also pledging support for the system. Jack Dorsey, the CEO of Square, told CBC that Square will support Apple Pay and Bitcoin payments on its newest registers. Square’s registers are widely used by artists, small indie shops, and other stores, especially in large cities. Alternative registers from First Data’s Clover and others like Poynt, already support Apple Pay.\nApple Pay works at 2 million locations Apple started out with just 220,000 locations back in September 2014, and the number has grown month after month, despite initial resistance from competing mobile payment platforms.\nSurprisingly making its debut a couple months ahead of schedule is the MTA eTix app, which supports Apple Pay for train-riding commuters in and around New York City. On October 4 , New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced that Apple Pay technology had been added to the “mobile ticketing app that enables Metro-North Railroad and Long Island Rail Road customers to purchase their tickets anywhere, anytime.” That means that Apple Pay can now be used by New Yorkers to buy one-way, round-trip, ten-trip, and weekly, CityTickets — as well and monthly passes — for the two busiest trains in North America: the Metro-North Railroad and the Long Island Railroad.\n“We have worked tirelessly to rebuild and reimagine New York’s transit system for the 21st century and a key part of those efforts is to incorporate the amenities that modern day riders demand,” Governor Cuomo said of the new app and its mobile payment feature. “By adding the use of cutting edge technology like Apple Pay … we are not only making mass transit easier to use, but are also improving the overall experience of riders.”\nIn early February 2016, the company announced that its mobile payment service now works in more than 2 million locations in the United States. Crate & Barrel, Chick-fil-A, and Au Bon Pain are the most recent additions to the long list of retail partners who support Apple Pay.\nRite Aid, a founding member of the exclusionary, rival CurrentC consortium, has reversed course and announced its support for Apple Pay and other contactless transaction methods soon. Several big box retailers support Apple Pay, including Best Buy . Target is also reported to have plans for Apple Pay in the pipeline. Target CEO Brian Cornell told Recode the retailer will add Apple Pay eventually.\nOn Apple’s website, the company lists its own store, Bloomingdales, Macy’s, Duane Reade, McDonald’s, Sephora, Petco, Panera Bread, Staples, Nike, Walgreens, Subway, Whole Foods, Marriott , and more as participating stores. Other businesses, such as Crate & Barrel, Chick-fil-A, Cinnabon, Chili’s, Domino’s, JC Penney, KFC, and Starbucks should add support for Apple Pay sometime this year. Also, chances are, if you see the NFC mobile payments symbol on a cash register, Apple Pay will work at that store, too.\nRelated: Apple Watch uses skin contact to secure mobile payments\nApple Pay is rolling out to 100,000 Coke machines. Also, thanks to an earlier deal with USA Technologies, 200,000 vending machines, and self-service terminals will now support Apple Pay. You’ll be able to tap-to-pay at vending machines, laundromats, parking terminals, and other automated check out systems with your iPhone instead of pulling out quarters and crinkled dollar bills.\nIn September 2014, iPhone users will be able to pay admission to national parks with Apple Pay, Tim Cook announced at the White House Summit on Cybersecurity and Consumer Protection .\n@SingAsana To clarify, Chevron is working alongside Apple to integrate Apple Pay at the pump, but a timeline is not set.\n— Chevron (@Chevron) December 29, 2014\nYou can already pay for your gas with Apple Pay at many gas stations, but you have to go inside to do so. Since most customers prefer to pay at the pump, Chevron announced via Twitter that it’s working with Apple to bring Apple Pay to the pump.\nApple Pay More Apple Pay will also branch out to more large venues and tourist attractions, such as amusement parks and stadiums. The mobile payment service already works in select stadiums’ concession stands around the country. In late December 2014, WDMagic revealed that a few Disney World locations accept Apple Pay. The vast majority of stores, quick service restaurants, bars, and ticket sales booths for rides and other attractions will accept mobile payments from the start. Full-service, sit-down restaurants will receive the technology later on.\nKohl’s is the first company to offer reward points on Apple Pay. Dunkin’ Donuts, JCPenney, Panera, Wegman’s, and Whole Foods are all set to do the same in the near future.\nYou can use Apple Pay with the Apple Watch and select apps, too Seeing as the Apple Watch has NFC technology built-in, it too can tap to pay. With the Apple Watch, you don’t have to physically tap it against the terminal, you just need to get close enough for it to register. A tap of the side button will bring up your credit card, and then you’re good to go.\nOnline shoppers will also be pleased to note that Apple Pay works with several apps, and more will be added shortly. The Apple Store, Target, AirBnB, Uber, Lyft, Groupon, Instacart, OpenTable, Panera Bread, Sephora, Spring, Starbucks, Tickets.com, and other apps all work with the new system.\nWe’ll continue to update this article as more partners are announced.\nMalarie Gokey, Kyle Wiggers, Rob Nazarian, Andy Boxall, Julian Chokkattu, and Christian de Looper all contributed to this report. Updated on 12-01-2016 by Julian Chokkattu: Added news that Singapore gets HSBC support for Apple Pay and the service comes to Spain.\nEverything you need to know about Android Pay Everything you need to know about Samsung Pay Samsung Pay gains new loyalty features, Masterpass integration, and more",

      "text": "Apple to establish centralized distribution center in India, report says   10:00 pm PT (01:00 am ET) According to a report published Friday, Apple is looking to consolidate its logistics operations in India, and thus gain more control over regional sales channels, by establishing a centralized distribution center in the country. Mumbai, India Citing industry officials familiar with Apple's plans, The Economic Times reports Apple has tapped European logistics firm and global operating partner DB Schenker to build and manage a distribution facility in Bhiwandi. With the center in place, Apple hopes to streamline product distribution across its various brick-and-mortar and online sales channels. The move should ensure stable retail availability and cut down on stockouts, the report said. In addition, a single point of entry should help stabilize product prices across the country. Currently, Apple wares are subject to varying VAT rates because they are imported through airports in Chennai, Bengaluru, Mumbai, Chandigarh, New Delhi and Hyderabad, the report said. \"The distribution centre will allow Apple to stock its products adequately, will ease operations and streamline its logistics and supply chains,\" said one unnamed source. \"It will also help in maintaining uniform price for its products, which will become much easier under the Goods and Services Tax regime.\" Further, the distribution center will allow Apple the flexibility to market custom configured hardware to enterprise customers. Due to India's direct foreign investment regulations, with which Apple is in a continuous struggle, the only way to purchase a build-to-order Mac is through the company's official online store. Apple is looking to expand into India as sales in the company's main growth market of China falter. The strategy appears to be bearing fruit, as data from Counterpoint Research this week found Apple's iPhone accounted for 66 percent of smartphone sales in India for the month of October. Topics:",

      "text": "Apple Pay is Apple’s contactless payment service, and it’s available to the iPhone 6/6S, 6/6S Plus , iPhone SE , and the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus . The service, like Android Pay, requires stores to have NFC terminals at checkout so that you can simply tap your phone to make a payment.\nWhile Apple was hardly the first with contactless payments, the company’s solution has banks, stores, and companies jumping on the bandwagon and pledging their support for Apple Pay. It seems as if new partners are joining every day, so we’ve put together this handy list of all the major partners, which we’ll update as more are added. Here are all the brands and countries that support Apple Pay.\nApple Pay around the world Initially, Apple Pay only worked in the United States, but Apple is interested in bringing the service to users in many countries. Apple has to prioritize which countries it will reach first, as the company has to take several factors into account. Apple evaluates credit and debit card penetration, the current infrastructure in place for mobile payments, and the popularity of iPhones in each country.\nWhether or not Amex and Visa cards are accepted in each country is also part of the vetting process, because both credit card providers are partners with Apple Pay. Their presence in any given country speeds up Apple Pay adoption. Indeed, that’s likely why so many countries kick off Apple Pay launches with limited support for Amex and Visa cards only.\nSpain\nSpain is the latest country to get Apple Pay support, and you can add credit or debit cards from Carrefour, American Express, Banco Santander, and Ticket Restaurant. The service also supports Mastercard.\nApple says more than 25 major vendors accept Apple Pay, including Media Markt, Starbucks, Bershka, Zara, Repsol, and Pull & Bear.\nSingapore\nApple users in Singapore have been able to use Apple Pay since the summer of 2016, but now HSBC customers can use it as well. The banking institution is offering a promotion for its customers that use Apple Pay — link an HSBC credit card to get $5 off every transaction that’s $10 or more. This offer will last until January 15.\nOther banks in Singapore that support Apple Pay are United Overseas Bank, Standard Chartered, OCBC Bank, POSB Bank, American Express, and DBS Bank.\nJapan\nOne of the rockier rollouts took place in Japan , where Apple Pay debuted after much anticipation on Oct. 25. Commuters had a difficult time loading their train passes onto their iPhones on the morning after major railways began accepting Apple Pay. Luckily, most services were restored after a couple hours. East Japan Railway Co. noted that much of the disruption was due to “the large number of attempts to access the service,” so it certainly looks as though Apple Pay has come to an eager audience.\nAt Apple’s September 7 event, the company announced that it was bringing Apple Pay to Japan. Of course, in Japan, they actually use a different technology to NFC, so along with the launch of Apple Pay in the country, Apple will also be selling the iPhone 7 with support for a technology called Felica — it’s very similar to Bluetooth, but the broader point is that the iPhone will now support Apple Pay in Japan.\nThe list of supported institutions are too great to mention, but you can check them out here .\nRussia\nOn Oct. 4, 2016, Apple Pay expanded its services to Russia . Mastercard is supported, and you can add cards from Alfa-Bank, Bank “Otkritie”, Bank Saint-Petersburg, MDM Bank, MTS Bank, Otkritie, Raiffeisenbank, Rocketbank, Russian Standard Bank, Sberbank, Tinkoff Bank, Tochka, VTB 24, and Yandex.Money.\nFrance\nApple launched support in France in July 2016. Apple Pay works with Visa and MasterCard, and you can add credit and debit cards from Carrefour Banque, Banque Populaire, Caisse d’Épargne, Edenred (Ticket Restaurant cards), Boon, and Orange Cash.\nSwitzerland\nIn July 2016, Switzerland got Apple Pay support. The service works with credit cards issued by Bonus Card, Cornercard, Swiss Bankers, and Swisscard.\nHong Kong\nIn Hong Kong, Apple Pay is compatible with Mastercard, Visa, and American Express accounts. Supported banks within the country include the Bank of China, Hang Seng Bank, HSBC, The Bank of East Asia, Standard Chartered, DBS Bank, HSBC, HKT Payment Limited, and “soon” Tap & Go. Apple Pay launched in the country in August 2016.\nAustralia and New Zealand\nApple is having some trouble getting major banks in Australia to sign up for the service, but at least ANZ is supported. American Express cards are also supported, as well as those from other institutions such as The Bank of Sydney, Bank Australia, The Mac, and more. You can read the full list here .\nANZ is the only supported bank in New Zealand at the moment.\nCanada\nApple Pay came to Canada late last year, but it only available to a handful of banks. A bigger expansion in early 2016 made the service more prevalent . American Express cards are supported, as well as ones from banks like ATB, Bank of Montreal, Canadian Tire, CIBC, Desjardins, President’s Choice, the Royal Bank of Canada, Scotiabank, Tangerine, and TD.\nU.K.\nThe U.K. was the first country to get Apple Pay after it launched in the U.S. It’s compatible with American Express cards, and more than 20 banks currently support the service including Barclays, Bank fo Scotland, Halifax, HSBC, Lloyds, Barclaycard, Boon, Cash Passport, Clydesdale Bank, First Direct, M&S Bank, MBNA, Metro Bank, Nationwide Building Society, NatWest, Royal Bank of Scotland, Santander, Tesco Bank, The Co-operative Bank, TSB, Ulster Bank, and Yorkshire Bank.\nChina\nAlthough cracking the Chinese payments market is considered extremely tough, Apple Pay got a boost from the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, which is the biggest lender in the country, Reuters reported. In total, Apple has 19 of China’s biggest banks on-board, and around 80 percent of Chinese credit and debit cards will work on the service from the get-go. The main disadvantage Apple faces in the country is the prevalence of other mobile payment services like Alibaba’s AliPay, WeChat, and UnionPay. You can see the full list of supported banks here .\nRelated: Tim Cook says money will be forgotten by history, thanks to Apple Pay\nWe’ll keep you updated as more countries support Apple Pay.\nMore and more banks support Apple Pay Apple inked deals with the four major U.S. credit and debit card providers early on: Visa, Mastercard, Discover, and American Express. Apple also has the support of more than 1,500 banks and credit unions in the U.S. as of December, 2016 . Users can even send money transfers from Apple Pay at Western Union locations.\nIn August 2016 , Apple added a ton of both traditional banks and credit unions to the list of supported Apple Pay partners, including smaller banks like the Bank of St. Francisville and the Billings Federal Credit Union. Safe to say with these additions, Apple wants everyone in the U.S. to be able to experience Apple Pay.\nIn October 2016 , Apple again added to its ever-growing roster of banks and credit unions in the U.S., and also announced support for Visa and debit cards for Canadian Desjardins customers. Apple Pay has been made available to 26 new banks in the U.S., as well as The Co-operative Bank and Metro Bank in the U.K., bringing the British total to 22. Taiwan looks to be up next for Apple Pay domination, as the four largest financial institutions in the nation appear to be preparing for the contactless payment service.\nIn November 2016, Apple updated its list of supported Apple Pay banks to include nine newcomers in China, four in Russia, and more than 30 in Australia. Twenty-eight additional banks and credit unions in the U.S. were also added. F or a full list of supported banks, check out Apple’s website .\nRelated: Apple Pay: What is it and how do I use it? We explain\nBack in February 2015 at the White House Summit on Cybersecurity and Consumer Protection , CEO Tim Cook announced that Apple Pay will soon support government employees’ credit cards, federal benefit cards for veterans, and social security benefit cards. According to Bloomberg , the government’s deal with Apple Pay includes the Direct Express payment network and government cards from GSA SmartPay.\nAt the summit, Cook also hinted that Apple Pay will replace every card in your wallet one day — even drivers’ licenses.\n“We can imagine a day the not-so-distant future when your wallet becomes a remnant of the past,” he said. “Your passport, your driver’s license, and other important documents can be digitally stored in a way that’s safe, secure, and easy to access.”\nNon-traditional banking and payment companies are also pledging support for the system. Jack Dorsey, the CEO of Square, told CBC that Square will support Apple Pay and Bitcoin payments on its newest registers. Square’s registers are widely used by artists, small indie shops, and other stores, especially in large cities. Alternative registers from First Data’s Clover and others like Poynt, already support Apple Pay.\nApple Pay works at 2 million locations Apple started out with just 220,000 locations back in September 2014, and the number has grown month after month, despite initial resistance from competing mobile payment platforms.\nSurprisingly making its debut a couple months ahead of schedule is the MTA eTix app, which supports Apple Pay for train-riding commuters in and around New York City. On October 4 , New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced that Apple Pay technology had been added to the “mobile ticketing app that enables Metro-North Railroad and Long Island Rail Road customers to purchase their tickets anywhere, anytime.” That means that Apple Pay can now be used by New Yorkers to buy one-way, round-trip, ten-trip, and weekly, CityTickets — as well and monthly passes — for the two busiest trains in North America: the Metro-North Railroad and the Long Island Railroad.\n“We have worked tirelessly to rebuild and reimagine New York’s transit system for the 21st century and a key part of those efforts is to incorporate the amenities that modern day riders demand,” Governor Cuomo said of the new app and its mobile payment feature. “By adding the use of cutting edge technology like Apple Pay … we are not only making mass transit easier to use, but are also improving the overall experience of riders.”\nIn early February 2016, the company announced that its mobile payment service now works in more than 2 million locations in the United States. Crate & Barrel, Chick-fil-A, and Au Bon Pain are the most recent additions to the long list of retail partners who support Apple Pay.\nRite Aid, a founding member of the exclusionary, rival CurrentC consortium, has reversed course and announced its support for Apple Pay and other contactless transaction methods soon. Several big box retailers support Apple Pay, including Best Buy . Target is also reported to have plans for Apple Pay in the pipeline. Target CEO Brian Cornell told Recode the retailer will add Apple Pay eventually.\nOn Apple’s website, the company lists its own store, Bloomingdales, Macy’s, Duane Reade, McDonald’s, Sephora, Petco, Panera Bread, Staples, Nike, Walgreens, Subway, Whole Foods, Marriott , and more as participating stores. Other businesses, such as Crate & Barrel, Chick-fil-A, Cinnabon, Chili’s, Domino’s, JC Penney, KFC, and Starbucks should add support for Apple Pay sometime this year. Also, chances are, if you see the NFC mobile payments symbol on a cash register, Apple Pay will work at that store, too.\nRelated: Apple Watch uses skin contact to secure mobile payments\nApple Pay is rolling out to 100,000 Coke machines. Also, thanks to an earlier deal with USA Technologies, 200,000 vending machines, and self-service terminals will now support Apple Pay. You’ll be able to tap-to-pay at vending machines, laundromats, parking terminals, and other automated check out systems with your iPhone instead of pulling out quarters and crinkled dollar bills.\nIn September 2014, iPhone users will be able to pay admission to national parks with Apple Pay, Tim Cook announced at the White House Summit on Cybersecurity and Consumer Protection .\n@SingAsana To clarify, Chevron is working alongside Apple to integrate Apple Pay at the pump, but a timeline is not set.\n— Chevron (@Chevron) December 29, 2014\nYou can already pay for your gas with Apple Pay at many gas stations, but you have to go inside to do so. Since most customers prefer to pay at the pump, Chevron announced via Twitter that it’s working with Apple to bring Apple Pay to the pump.\nApple Pay More Apple Pay will also branch out to more large venues and tourist attractions, such as amusement parks and stadiums. The mobile payment service already works in select stadiums’ concession stands around the country. In late December 2014, WDMagic revealed that a few Disney World locations accept Apple Pay. The vast majority of stores, quick service restaurants, bars, and ticket sales booths for rides and other attractions will accept mobile payments from the start. Full-service, sit-down restaurants will receive the technology later on.\nKohl’s is the first company to offer reward points on Apple Pay. Dunkin’ Donuts, JCPenney, Panera, Wegman’s, and Whole Foods are all set to do the same in the near future.\nYou can use Apple Pay with the Apple Watch and select apps, too Seeing as the Apple Watch has NFC technology built-in, it too can tap to pay. With the Apple Watch, you don’t have to physically tap it against the terminal, you just need to get close enough for it to register. A tap of the side button will bring up your credit card, and then you’re good to go.\nOnline shoppers will also be pleased to note that Apple Pay works with several apps, and more will be added shortly. The Apple Store, Target, AirBnB, Uber, Lyft, Groupon, Instacart, OpenTable, Panera Bread, Sephora, Spring, Starbucks, Tickets.com, and other apps all work with the new system.\nWe’ll continue to update this article as more partners are announced.\nMalarie Gokey, Kyle Wiggers, Rob Nazarian, Andy Boxall, Julian Chokkattu, and Christian de Looper all contributed to this report. Updated on 12-01-2016 by Julian Chokkattu: Added news that Singapore gets HSBC support for Apple Pay and the service comes to Spain.\nEverything you need to know about Android Pay Everything you need to know about Samsung Pay Samsung Pay gains new loyalty features, Masterpass integration, and more",

      "text": "December 1, 2016 5:22pm \nEven for those who have an iPhone, Google Maps is likely the go-to option for navigation purposes. \nApple reportedly wants to change that. Bloomberg reports that the Cupertino-based tech giant will likely use indoor navigation techniques and drones to improve its proprietary Maps service. \nThe company is reportedly assembling a team of robotics and data mining specialists to employ drones to capture and update map information faster. Currently, the company employs a network of “camera and sensor-ladened minivans.” \nThe purpose of the drones will be to fly around and read street signs, track changes to roads and monitor areas under construction, and promptly send that data to the Maps team for updating. Some of the upcoming new features for Maps could include inside views of buildings and improvements to car navigation. \nApple launched its Maps service in 2012, five years after Google Maps launched on the iPhone. However, the initial launch was riddled with errors such as incorrect signage and addresses. \nDigital maps are more significant to the future of Google and Apple than their current functionalities would lead one to believe. In addition to helping users find their way, navigation services can help propel tech companies into areas such as retail, ride sharing and other travel related services. \nSince 2012, Apple has improved the service by more quickly updating data, adding public transit navigation tools and opening the platform to outside services like Uber and OpenTable. \nIn September, 2015 Apple filed for an exemption from the Federal Aviation Administration to commercially fly drones. The FAA granted the tech giant approval to operate an unmanned aircraft system for the purpose of data collection in March, 2016. \nIn addition to employing drones for data collection, the company acquired the startup Indoor.io last year to help bring its indoor mapping features to market. This feature will likely allow users to navigate high-traffic buildings like airports and museums.",

Check on Apple's Website 10 Comments Now you can find out if the company is willing to give you a new battery for free, before making a trip to the store. \nDoes your iPhone 6s randomly shut off before the battery is fully drained? Apple last week launched a repair program for this issue, and now it's easy to check if you're eligible for a free battery. \nAs MacRumors notes , Cupertino's new tool lets you enter your phone's serial number and find out if the company is willing to give you a new battery for free, before making a trip to the store. You can get your phone's serial number by tapping on Settings > General > About. \nAs Apple notes on the page, the problem affects \"a very small number of iPhone 6s devices.\" While this is a battery issue, rest assured that Apple says it's \"not a safety issue,\" so don't worry about any Galaxy Note 7 -like explosions. Related Apple iPhone 7 vs. iPhone 6s: Should You Upgrade? \nIf you are eligible for a new battery, you can take your phone to an Apple retail store or one of the company's authorized service providers to get it fixed. Wireless carriers aren't participating in the program, so don't waste your time taking your phone there. \nBefore heading in for a fix, Apple recommends backing up your data to iTunes or iCloud, turning off the \"Find my iPhone\" feature, and erasing data and settings in Settings > General > Reset > Erase all Content and Settings. \nNote that if your phone has another issue that interferes with a battery replacement—if the screen is cracked, for example—Apple won't replace the battery unless you agree to have that fault repaired as well, which won't be free.

The activation lock in iOS, for example, makes it very hard for someone other than the owner to wipe an iPhone or iPad and set it up as a new device. Very hard, but not impossible. Image: Pexels \nTwo different bugs have recently been discovered that could allow someone to bypass Apple's activation lock. One impacts devices running iOS 10.1 and another on the most current version of the software, iOS 10.1.1. \nThe first was found by Hemanth Joseph , a security researcher who works out of Kerala, India. Joseph's workaround exploited a weakness in the iOS device setup process, and he tested it on a locked iPad he purchased from eBay. When asked to choose a WiFi network, he simply chose 'other network' and then proceeded to fill its name and a WPA2-enterprise key in with thousands of characters. His thought was that enough data in those fields would cause the device to freeze, and he was right. \nAfter figuring out how to freeze the iPad, he began to work on a way to make the setup process fail and drop him on the home screen. Pressing the sleep/wake button merely restarted the wizard, but with a little help from the magnetic catch in Apple's Smart Cover and some practice to perfect the timing, Joseph succeeded. He demonstrated the bypass in a video uploaded to Google Drive . \nResearchers at Vulnerability Lab discovered the iOS 10.1.1 bug. Like Joseph, the team began by overloading the WiFi setup fields and employed a smart cover. There's one minor difference: they rotate the device in their video demo to display the home screen. \nIn both cases, the home screen only appears for an instant and then it's gone. Vulnerability Labs founder Benjamin Kunz-Mejri told Security Week that pressing the sleep/wake button quickly allowed his team to keep it open. The danger, of course, is that a criminal who can replicate the attack could wipe a stolen iPhone or iPad and set it up as a new device. It's not clear from the videos, however, whether the home screen that appeared is fully functional and it's even possible to access the reset screen. \nThe bug discovered by Joseph was reportedly fixed in an iOS update on November 16. The second appears to be unpatched, though that could change with the arrival of iOS 10.2 which is currently being beta tested. ",
