Apple's $159 AirPods, which run on Bluetooth, are prohibitively expensive. Still, the iPhone 7 and the larger 7 Plus ship with a Lightning adapter to hook up regular headphones. \nOtherwise, the iPhone 7 has a few new tricks and the usual power upgrades. Apple iPhone 7 capacity starts at 32 GB, which is especially useful for business. It's rated IP67 for dust, water and splash resistance, so it should easily survive an accidental dunk or trip in the rain. The 7 Plus also has a dual-camera setup, enabling a new array of photo tricks. Rumor has it Apple is saving its big upgrades and a major redesign for 2017, the iPhone's 10 th anniversary.

      "text": "iPad sales have been trending downward for quite some time but Apple has no intention of giving up on its iconic tablet just yet. Per a new Barclays Research report obtained by MacRumors , Apple is currently planning to launch three new iPad models this coming March, one of which might very well revitalize Apple's beleaguered tablet lineup.\nDON'T MISS: Best Buy and Target have iPhone 7 Black Friday deals you shouldn’t miss\nPer sources in Apple's supply chain, the new report claims that two of Apple's new iPads will be refreshed versions of the current 9.7-inch and 12.9-inch iPad Pro models. As for the third, Apple is reportedly planning to release an iPad model that may provide us with a sneak peak at what Apple has in store for us with the iPhone 8 . Specifically, Apple this March plans to roll out a 10.9-inch iPad with an edge to edge display, a similar design to what the company may showcase on its next-gen iPhone.\n[Barclays] said the 10.9-inch model's borderless design will allow for it to be the same physical size as the current-generation 9.7-inch iPad Pro. That means the display itself will need to have an edge-to-edge design, possibly signaling the removal of the Home button.\nIf this rumored iPad model pans out, it could be just the thing Apple needs to inject a bit of life into an iPad lineup that has seen better days. During Apple's most recent earnings report covering the company's September quarter, iPad sales hit a new five year low. And though Tim Cook still likes to claim that the iPad is the future of computing, it's hard to look at the cold hard data and agree.\nThat notwithstanding, a rumored design refresh could help boost sales and provide existing iPad owners with more of an incentive to upgrade than ever before. Incidentally, Apple's iPad Mini 4 will likely not receive a refresh anytime soon.\nTrending right now:\nLeak suggests the iPhone 8 will finally get the redesign it deserves Best Buy and Target have iPhone 7 Black Friday deals you shouldn’t miss Best Buy has a great Black Friday Galaxy S7 deal you can use right now See the original version of this article on BGR.com",

      "text": "print \n(Adds Monsanto, Marathon Oil Corp) \nNEW YORK, Nov 10 (Reuters) - Dan Loeb's Third Point hedge fund took new share stakes in Apple Inc, Visa Inc and Dell Technologies Inc during the third quarter, according to regulatory filings late on Thursday. \nThird Point, closely followed in the investment community because of its pattern of delivering strong returns, took a 2.5 million stake in Apple, a 2.1 million class A share-stake in Visa and a 2.3 million share-stake in Dell Technologies. \nIn early November, Loeb told clients that Third Point's bets on corporate debt issued by Dell and Sprint Corp ranked among the year's top winners for the firm. \nThrough the end of September, the Third Point Offshore fund gained 7.2 percent, beating the average fund's 4 percent return. \nLoeb's Third Point also increased its share stake in Facebook Inc by 45.3 percent to 5.5 million class A shares, according to regulatory filings. In addition, the fund increased its stake in Alphabet Inc by 37.5 percent to 550,000 class A capital stock shares, the filings said. \nThird Point upped its stake in Monsanto Co by 85 percent to 3.7 million shares, while the hedge fund dissolved its share stake in Marathon Oil Corp during the third quarter, filings said. \nThird Point also took a 2.6 million sponsored ADS stake in Alibaba Group Holding Ltd, according to the regulatory filings. \nThe quarterly disclosures of manager stock holdings, in what are known as 13F filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, are always intriguing for investors trying to divine a pattern in what savvy traders are selling and buying. \nBut relying on the filings to develop an investment strategy comes with some peril because the disclosures are backward looking and come out 45 days after the end of each quarter. \nStill, the records offer a glimpse into what hedge fund managers saw as opportunities to make money on the long side. The filings do not disclose short positions, bets that a stock will fall in price. And there is also little disclosure on bonds and other securities that do not trade on exchanges.

      "text": "\n* Google lawyer says EU ignored Apple in its market assessment \n* Company faces billion euro fine if found guilty (Adds details) \nBy Foo Yun Chee \nBRUSSELS, Nov 10 (Reuters) - Google's Android mobile operating system enhances competition rather than hurts it, the company's general counsel said on Thursday in a rebuttal of EU antitrust charges that it uses the platform to crush rivals. \nThe comments by Google general counsel Kent Walker on a blog came a week after the U.S. technology group rejected another EU accusation of unfairly promoting its shopping service and blocking competitors in online search advertising. \nThe Android case could potentially be the most damaging for Google. Android has made about $31 billion in revenue and $22 billion in profit for Google since its release in 2008, an Oracle lawyer told a U.S. court in January. \nAndroid's market share in Europe is above 90 percent, according to the European Commission. \nWalker said the Commission has got the whole case wrong, ignoring both the fierce rivalry with iPhone maker Apple , the demands from apps developers and the dangers of modified versions of Android. \n\"The response we filed today shows how the Android ecosystem carefully balances the interests of users, developers, hardware makers, and mobile network operators. Android hasn't hurt competition, it's expanded it,\" he said. \nThe case is distorted because the EU competition enforcer does not see Apple's iOS as a rival to Android, he said. \n\"To ignore competition with Apple is to miss the defining feature of today's competitive smartphone landscape,\" Walker said. \nThe company also dismissed the regulator's concern about the bundling of some of its apps and products, saying that this allows it to offer the package for free instead of charging upfront licensing fees. \nCommission spokesman Ricardo Cardoso confirmed receipt of Google's response. \nThe EU antitrust enforcer intends to hit the company with deterrent fines in the Android and shopping cases, according to charge sheets seen by Reuters. \nGoogle faces fines of $7.4 billion, or 10 percent of its global turnover, for each case if found guilty of breaching EU rules.

      "text": "Kim McLendon \nApple and iPhone innovator Steve Jobs left this world five years ago in 2011 but did he really. His words and his example still inspire a world hungry for everything Jobs stood for. Steve’s bodily absence is compensated in the legacy of thoughts and ideas he left this world. \nSteve Jobs, the father of Apple, iPhone, and iOS, was a versatile man, forever caught in the balance of enlightenment and ambition. Caught in a decision between joy and effort he forged a way to have both. He leaves a legacy of ideas for those willing to read, listen and learn from his example. \nApple, iPhone, and iOS almost never happened. It is a little-known fact that Steve Jobs almost chose enlightenment over ambition. Read more in this Inquisitr story. If that had happened, iPhone would be nothing except perhaps an occasional typo. \nSteve Jobs almost decided to devote his life to spiritual questing in India. He was ready to join an Ashram, but in the end, ambition won out over enlightenment, or did it? Steve Jobs, in fact, learned to use his spiritual nature and his ambition to gift the world with a new means of innovation. \nSteve Jobs created iPhone. built Apple as a brilliant company and developed iOS as a platform of infinite creative possibilities. These are the things Jobs did, but why and how are the important questions to ask. \nSteve Jobs believed in what he was doing. Jobs believed in a formula based on feeling passion, changing the world and breaking all the rules. How else can one individual make a mark on the world? \n1. Steve Jobs Endorsed Passion Above All, As The Deciding Factor Of Success <noscript><iframe width=\"500\" height=\"375\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/gxo2rGr7Yfg?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></noscript> \nFor Steve Jobs, Apple was all about Passion. Passion is the first principle of success according to Jobs. Everything else depends on having a Jobs-level passion. Successful people do what they love, and then it is easier to continue loving what they do. Entrepreneur quotes Jobs. \n“People with passion can change the world for the better.” \nSteve Jobs is quoted in DIY Genius , revealing the secrets behind Apple’s success. \n“People say you have to have a lot of passion for what you’re doing and it’s totally true. And the reason is because it’s so hard that if you don’t, any rational person would give up. It’s really hard. And you have to do it over a sustained period of time.” \nSteve Jobs felt there were two kinds of workers in this world who create two different types of work for themselves. There are those who work out of need, responsibility and obligation, and no matter what those people do it is drudgery. Then there are those who work out of a passion for making everything better with their efforts. Those people excel while the others fail or barely hang on. \n“So if you don’t love it, if you’re not having fun doing it, you don’t really love it, you’re going to give up. And that’s what happens to most people, actually. If you really look at the ones that ended up, you know, being “successful” in the eyes of society and the ones that didn’t, oftentimes, it’s the ones who were successful loved what they did so they could persevere when it got really tough.” \nSteve Jobs felt so strongly about this that he suggested prospective entrepreneurs without passion take a menial ordinary job to gain experience until passion struck them with a calling in life, one that would fuel their real ambitions. Without true passion and only a sense of duty and drudgery, entrepreneurship will always fail, and so will any but the most menial and rudimentary of jobs. \nAccording to Apple founder, Steve Jobs people just have the wrong idea about working. They think they are supposed to hate it, to get tired of it and take time off, without even giving it a thought during the time they are away. They are supposed to compartmentalize their job definition and keep it separate from their real life. That’s not how it works for successful people. It takes passion. \n“A good answer to the question ‘What time do you leave work?’ is to say, ‘Never, since my work is my passion.’ But it takes a genius to continue by saying, ‘And by the way, my passion is design.'” \nFinally, The Apple guru advises to always follow your heart according to Clickhole. \n“Whatever you do, you must never let the voice in your head control the brain in your heart.” \n2. Steve Jobs On Changing The World <noscript><iframe width=\"500\" height=\"375\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/gO6cFMRqXqU?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></noscript> \nSteve Jobs, the father of Apple and creator of the iPhone, once told John Sculley then President of Pepsi Cola Company he needed a bigger vision for change, according to Entrepreneur. \n“Do you want to spend your life selling sugar water or do you want to change the world?” \nApple had one purpose in Steve Jobs mind. To change the world. He wanted to make life better for everyone. He was an innovator who always wanted a brighter future and what was best for the world. So how can just anyone make a difference? \nSteve Jobs would tell people, dream bigger, and get the message of your dream out there so people can understand it. They want to know what Apple iPhone, for example, can do for them. They don’t usually care about all the technical stuff the company did. They want to know what the product, service or idea does for them. \nTherefore, Steve Jobs believed in designing in a way that improved lives. From the beginning of the creative process to the end of the sale and beyond to customer service, it has to be about what people need. Good ideas are about benefiting others, not just making money. \nOf course, Steve Jobs cared about money. Sure he had to eat, just like everyone else. He provided rather well for himself by anyone’s definition, but he knew when he went into business that the customers don’t buy because of the CEO’s needs or the employee’s needs. \nApple customers buy iPhones, iPads, and etc. because the products being offered meet their needs. Therefore, the customers need comes first, and in the end, it is all about making the world better for those customers. It is really all about a universal spiritual principle of putting others first, but that principle works very well in business. \n3. Steve Jobs on Breaking The Rules <noscript><iframe width=\"500\" height=\"375\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/8rwsuXHA7RA?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></noscript> \nApple founder Steve Jobs seemed to be born hating the status quo, and loving the troublemakers. Jobs is quoted from an iconic Apple commercial seen in the video above. \n“Here’s to the crazy ones. The misfits. The rebels. The troublemakers. The round pegs in the square holes. The ones who see things differently. They’re not fond of rules. And they have no respect for the status quo. You can quote them, disagree with them, glorify or vilify them. About the only thing, you can’t do is ignore them.” \nThen Steve Jobs goes on to explain why. This bit of advertising explains another secret of success. \n“Because they change things. They push the human race forward. While some may see them as the crazy ones, we see genius. Because the people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world, are the ones who do.” \nApple founder Steve Jobs encouraged crime, not the type that breaks laws or hurts people but he definitely thought the world was full of rules to be broken. \n“Be a criminal. Commit crimes. I’m not talking about crimes against the law. Those aren’t the important ones. You can commit a crime against boredom. Or a crime against ignorance. Commit crimes against bad ideas, and against the people who have them. Then go commit crimes for innovation and for design. Above all, realize that the product itself isn’t the product. The crime is the product.” \nSteve Jobs is pointing out there are many ways to do things, and those blind enough to believe that only one way is the right way, are the real menace to society. Innovation dictates there is always a better way, but sometimes that means breaking rules and traditions that keep all mankind in a rut. \n4. Steve Jobs on Being prepared to Fail and Fail Big Steve Jobs is responsible for fonts on computers, iPhones, iPods and iPads [Image by Anton Ivanov/Shutterstock] \nApple founder Steve Jobs recognized that fear of failure is paralyzing. It keeps people from doing anything, right or wrong. People cannot be so afraid to make mistakes they fail because they don’t act. Refusal to take action is a guarantee of failure. \n“Most people never pick up the phone and call, most people never ask, that’s what separates the people that do things from the people who just dream about them. You’ve got to act. You’ve got to be willing to fail. You’ve got to be willing to crash and burn.” \nThe willingness to move forward, even if an attempt fails is part of business. Of course, there are times when one can’t afford to fail, that is where no comes in. For all his positivity, Steve Jobs believed in the power of saying no to bad ideas, but he also believed in saying yes to the right idea at the right time. Making a strong move, without hesitation is part of the path to success. \n5. Steve Jobs on Design Apple logo as design [Image by Kena Betancur/Shutterstock] \nThe most important word in the world to Steve Jobs was design, but he never, ever meant appearance. To Jobs, everything was part of design. One idea would flow into another based on a tremendous base of everyday experiences that were all material for design. \n“Most people make the mistake of thinking design is what it looks like. People think it’s this veneer — that the designers are handed this box and told, ‘Make it look good!’ That’s not what we think design is. It’s not just what it looks like and feels like. Design is how it works.” \nApple was always largely about design. iPhones are not all that different on the outside, and one might think, what design, but the design of what it does is simply amazing. The form gives way to function as design. \nRELATED REPORTS FROM THE INQUISITR",

      "text": "Apple's wireless Bluetooth AirPods might not launch until early next year Apple's wireless Bluetooth AirPods might not launch until early next year Posted: Tags : Accessories - Accessories + iOS - iOS + Apple - Apple + Earlier this month, sources said that the wireless in-ear Apple AirPods would still be released in 2016 . In October, Apple had announced that it would be delaying the release of the Bluetooth powered product. Back then, Apple said that while the early response to the AirPods was incredible, \"we don’t believe in shipping a product before it’s ready, and we need a little more time before AirPods are ready for our customers.\"Now, it appears as though we might not find the AirPods available for sale until early 2017. That is the word from Barclay's Research. Analysts working for the banking firm say that supply chain sources don't expect the AirPods to go through the assembly line for another three to four weeks. Sadly for Apple, this means that the AirPods will miss out on the 2016 holiday shopping season. Priced at $159, the wireless Bluetooth earphones would have helped Apple generate a decent amount of additional revenue during the holiday quarter.Not all of the anticipated holiday quarter AirPods' sales will migrate to the subsequent quarter. After all, some consumers might decide to ante up a little more for Samsung's Gear IconX wireless Bluetooth earbuds . The latter is priced at $199.99, $40 or 20% more than the cost of the Apple AirPods.Barclays says that Apple will have a small initial production run of 10 million to 15 million AirPods next month. That sets up the product for a fast sell out, and extended shipping dates weeks in the future. That's nothing you haven't seen before from Apple, especially during iPhone launch season.",

      "text": "Save Google Pixel Review – Disneyworld Edition We've all seen Apple's messaging become more pronounced. It's getting to be ridiculous. I don't need to see a skateboarder taking pictures on an iPhone while riding through 60 mph hurricane winds on a sailboat surfacing on the crest of a 200 foot tall wave in the Atlantic Ocean to know whether or not I want your phone. This review isn't an iPhone comparison. It's intended to test whether or not the Pixel is capable. It's intended to test whether the Pixel, in the most dire circumstances, wouldn't leave me wishing I had an iPhone. Which brings me to Disneyworld. Disneyworld is an endurance test for people. How many times can you listen to the Frozen soundtrack? Can you smile for one week straight without breaking? Can you refrain from scolding a stranger's child for acting like a complete lunatic with no regard for the rest of the world's comfort? If a new significant other can handle Disneyworld with the whole family, you can take them anywhere. The same is true of your phone. So, I put the Pixel through a nontraditional examination of stability, endurance, and power at Disneyworld. The Pixel left me impressed. Very impressed. The Frozen Ever After Test: Performance and Speed I've been in line for Frozen Ever After with my girlfriend's family. We're in the town of Arendelle. Like all Disney attractions, before getting on the ride you need to wait for 2 hours in a refrigerated warehouse modeled to look like the set of a movie. In the movie Frozen, Arendelle is known for becoming a winter wonderland after Elsa has a panic attack. In Epcot, it's known as the fourth rehash of Frozen songs and characters you've seen in the past 3 hours. A phone can make or break you in Arendelle. The Pixel needs to perform here. My Pixel zipped around the Internet while other devices struggled with Arendelle's connectivity. My Pixel zipped around the Internet while other devices struggled with Arendelle's connectivity. I downloaded an application. I purchased a live Google maps case for my new Pixel and had it shipped to my house from the Chrome browser. I used music.ly with my girlfriend's nine-year-old sister. I responded to emails and checked my grades in my graduate school classes. It's 2016. Your phone can retrieve specific information from around the world for you on request. But if it takes over 1 second for your phone to defy the laws of space, time, and information – you are pissed. Hiccups like this can make you wish you had an iPhone. But you won't notice the difference in speed between the Pixel and the iPhone 7. In the land of granted wishes, not one wish for an iPhone surfaced from my subconscious while was in line. The Pixel's performance is a snap. Results: A– The Disney Fun Facts Test – Google Assistant. Unlike most smartphone assistants, Google Assistant packs the power of Google. And it shows. Google Assistant knows more than any assistant I've ever used on a smart device. Something about walking through theme parks makes me want to have the answers to stupid questions – to have knowledge of fun facts. When was that ride built? What's the name of that actress? Did she voice the character at the attraction, or just the character in the movie? Google Assistant didn't have the answer to all of my questions. But it provided more for me than any other smartphone assistant has. It's integrated well. It specializes in unprompted and timely delivery of relevant information. It's integrated well. It specializes in unprompted and timely delivery of relevant information. When I set foot in any of Disney's parks, I'm prompted with a notification containing general information, facts, and maps to help me familiarize with my surroundings. It does the same thing for malls, airports, hotels, restaurants, and other points of interest. You can silence or eliminate these notifications, but I like them. It's passive listening feature allows me to say 'OK Google' to get its attention when my phone is locked. It's linked to my personal Google account (Gmail), so it already knows a lot about me. It feeds me news and information that I want in an unobtrusive way. The assistant is a conversationalist. It's one step closer to being able to communicate in natural language with our computers because it's actively engaged in conversation with you. If you've just asked it for today's weather, you can ask it something with some continuity, like 'What about tomorrow?' Google Assistant will remember that you're talking about the weather and give you the right information. Google Assistant is the type of AI that one day will make your phone the only thing you need. Wherever you are, the Pixel is able to provide you with contextual information, facts, and actions relevant to your surroundings. And it is wonderful. Results: B+ The Sightseer Test – Camera Performance To boot up the Pixel camera, all you need to do is double tap the power button. You can also press and hold the camera app icon to reveal quick actions (take a selfie, take a video, etc.) like Apple's 3D touch. Every Google app has shortcuts like these. The camera loads faster than you need it to with the power button double tap. You won't miss a photo. The picture quality is better than most. The color is vivid, it handles low light situations with grace, and it captures detailed, textured photographs. I included Pixel photos of Disney landmarks for your judgement. You'll see differences in the iPhone and Pixel in the way they handle different lighting situations, but neither camera feels or looks significantly better than the other. The video stabilization feature works as advertised. It does make most videos look like Buffalo Bill walking through his basement at the end of Silence of the Lambs – it's almost a little too steady. It's a victim of it's own competence. The Pixel also features unlimited photo storage capabilities. The Pixel also features unlimited photo storage capabilities. No more 'insufficient storage space' notifications. This isn't a feature; it's a lack of an annoyance. I have to remind myself of the times when I would load up my iPhone's camera and receive the buzz-killing no storage notification. I needed to go back into my photos app to delete memories before capturing what was in front of me. It was never practical. You will never have to do that with your Pixel. The Pixel also utilizes Google Assistant to automatically create albums, stylized photos, collages, animations, and slideshows from your photos. It's a fun feature. It also requires no effort to utilize. The Pixel implements the camera and photos app better than the iPhone. When the camera app was loaded up on the Pixel, I never wished I had an iPhone in my hands. In fact, I was glad I didn't have an iPhone. Results: A– The Splash Mountain Test – Water Resistance What are you crazy? I didn't take my Pixel on Splash Mountain. Even it my phone was waterproof, I'm not sure I'd risk it. The Pixel is not fully waterproof like the iPhone 7. It'd be nice if it was, but it's not. It will likely come with the next iteration of the phone. I've lived my entire life without waterproof phones and so have you. Another year or two won't hurt me. With that said, I'd be less stressed if knew I was never at risk for water damage. This is definitely a negative for the Pixel. Results: C The Boardwalk Test – Battery Life The days are longer in Disneyworld. They just are. The Pixel lasted just about the entire day in moderate use cases. I replied to my emails and browsed the web. I texted, called, retrieved information. I took pictures and videos frequently. To me, the battery icon on the Pixel is misleading. It looks like you have less battery than you do. A swipe down from the top of the phone reveals notifications and quick actions. Press and hold the battery icon and you're usually pleasantly surprised with your actual battery life (given in hours). The Pixel didn't die on me once during the trip. I plugged it in each night before bed and I carried it around the parks with me everywhere (except Splash Mountain). Results: A– The Verdict – The Pixel won't leave you disappointed. After waiting two hours for Frozen Ever After, I was pleasantly surprised. The ride wasn't disappointing, despite the 2 hour wait. As I watched Elsa reach for me and sing \"Let It Go\" as our vessel slid backwards down a magical waterfall, I was reminded of my new phone purchase. I waited a while for a worthy competitor to the iPhone. I waited a while for a worthy competitor to the iPhone. We all have. Now I'm at the end of the wait. Just like my Frozen Ever After experience, I find myself pleasantly surprised. The Pixel ships with a cord you can plug directly into your iPhone to extract everything that matters and leave iOS in the dust. The Pixel is a way to leave iOS and be happy with your decision. It's not complicated, it's not hard to use, and it's the other mobile operating system that's socially acceptable to use. Dissonance was my greatest fear with this decision because a phone purchase only happens once every 12-24 months. I'm happy to say farewell to iOS in hopes that some hearty competition will keep the smartphone space interesting. Ah - and when I arrived home Google Assistant had already created an album of the entire trip, clipping out duplicates and similar photos. I touched the share button, added in everyone who went on the trip, closed my eyes and went to bed. Overall Results: A– Google Pixel Review – Disneyworld Edition 0 Shares ",

      "title": "Public Access - 5 Ways Apple Could Beat Samsung Next Year",
      "text": "Share Save \nWe've all been privy to the annual battle between Apple and Samsung, the clash of two titans. Year in and year out, they release new mobile devices and software to compete with and outdo one another. It's all one big blowout over who gets to be the temporary king. I'm not complaining. My pocket certainly isn't. But it seems that over the last two years, Samsung has held that crown (and lost it, just after a few short months. Now Apple wears it, by default.) No doubt, these two are both responsible for innovating technology, even outside of their respective products. Even gaming consoles and handheld devices owe a lot to these two. \nThe tide seems to be changing and now that technology seems to be influencing mobile technology , from a certain standpoint. Apple needs to up its game if it hopes to win the next round which begins in a few months. To breathe new life into what is turning out to be a rather stale affair, so to speak. There are a few ways they could do it, to completely change what has come before. Here are five ways Apple could potentially beat Samsung in 2017: \n1) VIRTUAL REALITY Something that's been rumoured for some time is Apple's own take on Virtual Reality, a response to Samsung's very own \" Samsung Gear VR \". Virtual Reality is rapidly taking over the world, it's being implemented into a wide variety of technology, from gaming all the way to the treatment of mental health disorders. It's becoming more than just a fad, an idea or tech from old sci-fi movies, it's real, and quite frankly, it is better and more useful than imagined. Apple's own take on this cannot afford to be an afterthought. It has to bring something new to the experience, and I think they're reputable enough to meet that demand. If they create a headset that is more cost effective than the competition, can offer more interactivity with apps and provide compelling social experiences than they might have this one in the bag. 2) BATTERY POWER You can say that this is what caused Samsung's defeat in 2016, but this just means Samsung is going to come back with something more improved next year and Apple cannot let their guard down. How reliable is a phone's battery, really? Not at all. And each year, a new phone comes out with better hardware and software and this requires more battery power and the battery power, unfortunately, doesn't measure up. Here is where Apple can innovate. They could either implement better batteries or somehow design their next products to consume a considerably smaller amount of battery power and highlight that as a selling point. 3) A STRONGER SCREEN This is the area where Samsung is the clear victor. Apple's phones are notorious for how fragile their screens are, and Apple has ignored your pleas for over 6 years! It's one of the reasons why people avoid iPhones, so if they fix this issue, it will do wonders for their sales. 4) SCREEN RESOLUTION While we're on the topic of screens, another aspect that Apple can improve upon for next year's iPhone is the screen resolution. Samsung's phones have a much higher screen resolution and a higher amount of megapixels and this puts Samsung ahead with regards to picture quality. It's an often overlooked aspect in an Apple product, but Apple needs to be more competent in this area in order to improve. While their phones do offer great video recording and image quality, it is far behind and it is a problem. 5) BRING BACK THE HEADPHONE JACK This is the primary reason that people were turned off by the iPhone 7—it did not have a headphone jack. Now, whilst Apple is not likely to bring this back in favour of wireless earphones (which people of this decade have not yet and will not adjust to), they should at least include it in the future as an option. People still love their earphones. And so the game continues into 2017. If Apple listens to their customer base more intensively, they can improve greatly and outclass Samsung in the future. 1 Shares ",

      "text": "Phone Comparison: Apple iPhone 7 Plus vs Google Pixel XL November 11, 2016 - Written By Cory McNutt \nIntroduction \nDo we have a good one for you today – no, let’s make that a great one today. The pride of Apple, the iPhone 7 Plus takes on the newest flagship from Google, the Pixel XL . There are many readers that just do not understand why we compare and iOS phone to an Android phone and it just blows my mind. Why they wouldn’t want to see just what Apple is offering on their devices and how it stacks up to ours. This is an Android website, so naturally, we believe in our OS and the freedom that Android offers over the iOS environment. I just know if I owned a new Camaro that I would want to see how it stacks up to a Mustang and if I owned a Google Pixel XL, I would surely want to know how it compares to its chief rival. These two devices couldn’t be more different in their specifications or design philosophy, but let’s take a look and see just what common threads we can find. \nWhen it comes to specifications the iPhone 7 Plus and Google Pixel XL could not be further from each other, but the way they perform is a whole other story. Physically, they are very close to the same size, although the slightly larger iPhone weighs an extra 20 grams even though they both have a 5.5-inch display. The displays use different technology and different resolutions. The iPhone 7 Plus uses its own Apple A10 Fusion processor, and the Google Pixel uses the Snapdragon 821 quad-core processor. They both have non-expandable internal memory – the iPhone offers 32GB, 128GB, or 256GB while the Google Pixel XL offers a 32GB or 128GB model. The primary cameras are very close in size as are the front-facing cameras (FFC) and both take excellent photos; although DxOMark gave the Google Pixel models the highest score ever given to a mobile camera. They both offer non-removable batteries, but the Pixel’s is much larger and offers rapid charge. They both provide a fingerprint sensor for unlocking the phone and authorizing mobile payments – Apple Pay only on the iPhone. They have the usual suspects – WiFi, Bluetooth v4.2, GPS, and NFC (the iPhone’s is only good for Apple Pay), and they each have a connector for charging and data transfer but the Apple plug is proprietary, and the Google Pixel uses a standard Type-C reversible port. \nPlease take a careful look at the detailed Specifications Comparison chart below and here you will see just how these two great devices stack up against one another – click on the “View Full Comparison” link at the end of the chart to expand the details. After that, we will look at each device in greater depth and point out some of its pros and cons. From all of this information, we will try to determine the winner based on specs and execution of design and functions. \nSpecifications SpecOut | Graphiq \nApple iPhone 7 Plus \nThe new iPhone 7 Plus looks very similar to its predecessor, the iPhone 6s Plus, with enhancements throughout. The antenna positioning was moved to its outside edges for a cleaner look, and the old Home button is more like a touch button with no moving parts. Apple improved the 3D Touch and Display Zoom, improved the processor, added IP67 dust and water resistance and added a dual camera on the iPhone 7 Plus only. Let’s take a look and see just how that new iPhone 7 Plus holds up to the new Google Pixel XL. \nThe Apple iPhone 7 Plus sports a 5.5-inch LED-backlit IPS LCD display with a Full HD resolution of 1920 x 1080 pixels and 401 pixels-per-inch (PPI.) It features an improved Apple’s 3D Touch that allows the user to make multiple selections with one press of the finger and varying degrees of force. The processor is their new Apple A10 Fusion quad-core clocked at 2.23HGz, coupled with 3GB of DDR4 RAM and either 32GB, 128GB, or 256GB of non-expandable storage – it is nice that the 16GB model was dropped from the lineup. The GPU uses six-core graphics. \nApple did make some considerable changes in its camera area, in particular on the iPhone 7 Plus – it’s a shame that Apple did not use the same camera of both models like the Google Pixel and Pixel XL. The iPhone 7 Plus uses a new dual 12MP sensor – one for wide-angle (f/1.8) and one for telephoto (f/2.8). Then it adds phase detection autofocus (PDAF), Quad-LED True Tone flash, and OIS for its primary camera. For its FFC the iPhone 7 Plus uses a 7MP sensor with an aperture of f/2.2 for selfies and video chatting (AppleTalk) in their nomenclature. It uses a 2900mAh non-removable battery to supply power. \nThe new Apple iPhone 7 Plus comes with many refinements – dual-camera, improved camera lens, Quad LED flash, improved 3D Touch, improved stereo sound, improved Home button, IP67 dust and water resistance, and 3GB of RAM with 32GB of non-expandable memory now being the smallest available. They did remove the 3.5mm headphone jack and supplied an adapter, although Bluetooth earphones are also an option. In what appears to be an increasing trend, Apple, and the Moto Z line has lost their 3.5mm earphone plug. The iPhone Plus measures 158.2 x 77.9 x 7.3mm and weighs in at 188 grams. Pricing starts out at $770 for the 32GB model. \nGoogle Pixel XL \nThis time of year, it seems strange not comparing the new Nexus phones with other models, but Google is making a huge move to create an Apple-like ecosystem. In this ecosystem, Google Pixel owners can communicate directly with their new Home products and Chromecast Ultra. We will be looking at the Google Pixel XL this time around to see just how this newly designed Pixel XL with its polished glass and metal construction holds up to the all-metal Apple iPhone 7 Plus. \nThe Google Pixel XL sports a 5.5-inch QHD AMOLED display with a resolution of 2560 x 1440 pixels with 531 PPI. It is using the newest Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 quad-core processor with a dual-core clocked at 1.6GHZ and a dual-core clocked at 2.15GHz. The Snapdragon 821 is 10-percent quicker than the original Snapdragon 820 according to Qualcomm. The 821 is packaged with an Adreno 530 GPU to take on any graphics you can throw its way. It packs 4GB of DDR4 RAM and 32GB or 128GB of the faster UFS memory, and there are no means to expand the built-in memory. It uses a large 3450mAh non-removable battery for power and has rapid charge capabilities. \nThe same Pixel camera is used on both models, and it does not have impressive looking specifications. It comes with a 12.3MP sensor for the primary camera along with an aperture of f/2.0, phase detection autofocus (PDAF,) a dual-tone LED flash, and no OIS. However, when tested by DxOMark it received a score of 89 – the highest rating yet for a smartphone camera. The Pixel XL provides a large 8MP FFC that comes with a f/2.0 aperture, a 1.4µm pixel size, and 1080p. This combination of specs offers up great selfies and video chatting. \nThe Pixel XL measures in at 154.7 x 75.7 x 8.6mm and weighs in at 168 grams. There are three different colors available: Quite Black, Very Silver, and Really Blue (a limited edition color.) A rear-mounted fingerprint sensor will allow you to unlock your device or authorize mobile payments and will have access to Android Pay. The Pixel XL has Google Assistant built in that will work with other Google products. It will be running Android 7.1 Nougat out of the box. The Pixel XL is IP53 rated against dust and splashing water and the 32GB model will cost you about $770. \n…And The Winner Is… \nThe Final Word \nNot only because this is an Android website, but because it seems to offer more for the same amount of money I must pick the Google Pixel XL as the winner of this comparison. \nWe are not implying that the iPhone 7 Plus is not a beautiful looking device. We are not saying that it doesn’t take great pictures or videos. We are not saying that it doesn’t run as smooth as butter with its A10 processor. What we are saying is that the iPhone 7 Plus does not have quite the specifications nor the users the freedom to customize their device like the Google Pixel XL. \nWhile the displays are the same size, the Pixel XL uses the better AMOLED display technology, and it has a higher resolution than the iPhone 7 Plus – 401 PPI versus 534 PPI. The Pixel XL has 1GB more RAM, which helps with its multitasking abilities. Its camera is excellent. It can use mobile payments other than places that must buy a special reader for Apple Pay. There are no proprietary plugs or cords needed. You can customize your display with widgets that directly open the app when you press them, and you can still plug your headphones into a 3.5mm jack.

Follow our live coverage. SHARE Apple Music Thanks \nWe're wrapping up our live coverage of Apple's annual iPhone event. In the days ahead, we'll have more coverage, analysis and reviews. \nNo matter how splashy, product launches are a form of marketing. But that doesn't mean they aren't significant -- especially for a company that has fine-tuned event planning and made it a part of the company's value. That matters not only to customers, but to investors. \nThanks again for visiting.

If you feel like doing the reading yourself, you simply turn the feature off and swipe through pages manually with the Apple TV remote. \nApple promises the StoryTime app will give families a “different way to experience classic kids’ books and discover new favorites.” The app is pretty dang convenient: You can purchase a book from iBooks on any device (i.e. your phone) and the book will sync automatically to your Apple TV.\nA photo posted by 絵本収集が趣味です (@azalea.violet_dwe) on Nov 11, 2016 at 4:23pm PST \niBooks StoryTime is free (heck yes, am I right?) and includes one free book ( Dora’s Big Buddy Race Read-Along Storybook) so you can try it out before you invest in more sstories. Other books available for purchase include Lava , based on the Pixar short, Green Eggs and Ham , and Goodnight Moon .\nYay to literature in all its forms!\nThe post This awesome app from iBooks brings children’s stories to your TV appeared first on HelloGiggles .",

      "text": "Youtube Apple iPhone Lightning Dock Unboxing – Black \nApple introduced official iPhone dock in white color, featuring a lightning connector last year. It recently introduced black version of the dock to match the black iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus models. Here we have the unboxing. \nThe box only has the dock, and doesn’t come with a connector. The dock has a matte finish, but there is no glossy black version yet. Since the dock is upright, you can unlock iPhone or use Touch ID without having to remove it from the dock. \nThe Lightning Dock has two ports at the back, one for Lightning to support charging or data when connected to Mac or PC, and one 3.5mm stereo headphone jack to support audio out. \nThe Apple iPhone Lightning Dock is priced at $49 (Rs. 3310 approx.) in the U.S. Apple Store and also comes in Silver, Gold, Space Gray and Rose Gold colors.

      "text": "The new company, focused on creating the most innovative and intuitive Apple accessories in the world, released an Apple-compatible all-in-one music lamp and charging dock for pre-order this holiday season\nLos Angeles, CA, United States – November 11, 2016 /MarketersMedia/ —\nThe WySky Music Lamp , launched this month on Kickstarter, is an all-in-one solution for mobile music streaming inside the home. Designed for all new Apple products, the WySky Music Light is a one stop shop for playing music, charging your phone, and setting the mood all at the same time.\n“As music lovers, we’ve always loved speaker systems that plug directly into your phone while it charges, but we thought something was missing.” says founder Jeff Wu. “When you listen to music, so much of the pleasure and the experience depends on mood and lighting. So we wanted to combine the sound of music with the ambient lighting of the room, all in a single device. It’s a great way to unwind during dinner, at a party, or with a book or a partner after a long day.”\nMost lamps have a set color — either warm white light, cold white light, or a colored light. WySky is the first lamp that allows you to blend any color together, which means you can choose the precise shade and color that is best suited to your room or mood. The lamp is fully integrated with iOS 10 (iOS 6.1 and newer), is MFi-approved by Apple, and works with iPhone, iPad, and iPod. The team has gone through several iterations of this product to be able to provide the highest quality sound and light. It includes a 4 inch full-range speaker to fill the room with hi-definition audio and 81 LEDs that won’t burn out or get hot to the touch, and a software interface which allows for selection within a 16 million color spectrum.\nThe WySky Music Lamp is designed to complement and enhance a mindful lifestyle. It was inspired by the founders’ love of music, design, Apple products, and having a quiet and beautiful space to relax every single day.\nIn exchange for pledging to the project, backers can choose from five different styles of varying colors, starting at $99. Each lamp comes will the full range of lighting options, an alarm clock feature, and a 4” full range speaker. Backers have until Wednesday, November 23rd to pre-order and can expect to receive their Music Lamps in January 2017.\nFor more information, visit the Kickstarter page, or contact Scott Hughes at wyskytech@gmail.com .\nAbout WySky:\nWySky is an upcoming lifestyle brand and design studio based in Shanghai and Los Angeles, focused on creating the most innovative and intuitive Apple accessories in the world.\nFor additional information:\nKickstarter Campaign\nPress Kit\nFor more information, please visit http://h0cn.fnd.to/wysky\nContact Info:\nName: Scott Hughes\nEmail: wyskytech@gmail.com\nOrganization: WySky\nVideo URL: http://h0cn.fnd.to/wysky\nSource: http://marketersmedia.com/wysky-an-la-based-lifestyle-brand-and-design-studio-specializing-in-multi-function-apple-accessories-launches-on-kickstarter/145537\nRelease ID: 145537\n ",

      "text": "Youtube Apple iPhone 8 could sport 5-inch and 5.8-inch bezel-less design with curved edges \nThe next generation Apple iPhone is said to sport a larger screen with bezel-less design and curved edges, according to Barclays Research analysts Blayne Curtis, Christopher Hemmelgarn, Thomas O’Malley and Jerry Zhang. \nThe iPhone 8 will feature a 5-inch screen while iPhone 8 Plus will sport a 5.8-inch display. Next generation iPhones are already rumored to come with OLED display and the Barclays analysts also seconded the report but said only the 5.8-inch model will use OLED display technology. If this is true, it will be the first time that Apple will go with OLED display for its iPhones as until now sport LCD display. \nEarlier in March, KGI analyst Ming-Chi Kuo also said that the next fen iPhone will come with curved panels on the front and back with metal on the sides and sport an AMOLED screen. \nIt must be noted that nothing is confirmed and Apple has not made anything official about the next generation iPhone. However, Apple is expected to bring major design changes to iPhones next year as it is will be company’s 10th anniversary. \nvia Author: Sneha Bokil Sneha Bokil is a tech enthusiast and is currently using Nexus 5X but she still treasures her Nokia N70 (M).

      "text": "Hundreds of fake retail and product apps have popped up in Apple’s App Store in recent weeks — just in time to deceive holiday shoppers. The counterfeiters have masqueraded as retail chains like Dollar Tree and Foot Locker, big department stores like Dillard’s and Nordstrom, online product bazaars like Zappos.com and Polyvore, and luxury-goods makers like Jimmy Choo, Christian Dior and Salvatore Ferragamo. “We’re seeing a barrage of fake apps,” said Chris Mason, CEO of Branding Brand, a Pittsburgh company that helps retailers build and maintain apps. Some of them appeared to be relatively harmless — essentially junk apps that served up annoying pop-up ads, he said. In practice, however, Apple focuses more on blocking malicious software and does not routinely examine the thousands of apps submitted to the iTunes store every day to see whether they are legitimately associated with the brand names listed on them. With apps becoming more popular as a way to shop, it is up to brands and developers themselves to watch for fakes and report them, much as they scan for fake websites, said Ben Reubenstein, CEO of Possible Mobile, a Denver company that makes apps for JetBlue Airways and the PGA Tour, among others. In September, Apple also embarked on a campaign to review all 2 million apps in the App Store and remove “apps that no longer function as intended, don’t follow current review guidelines or are outdated.”",

      "title": "Apple's iPad, iPhone Will Reportedly Get Major Changes in 2017",
      "text": "Apple’s iPhone and iPad could deliver some major improvements next year, analysts say.\nThe tech giant’s next iPhone, which could be known as the iPhone 8, will ship with bigger screen sizes, Barclays analysts Blayne Curtis and Christopher Hemmelgarn said in a note this week. They say the iPhone 8 will offer a 5-inch screen and iPhone 8 Plus will deliver a 5.8-inch display, according to Business Insider, which obtained a copy of the note. The iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus offer 4.7- and 5.5-inch screen sizes.\nThe larger screens would be offered if Apple decides to offer a “bezel-less design” in the iPhone 8, according to the report. Rather than stop the screen before the left and right edges, Apple AAPL is expected to offer a design that has the iPhone 8’s display spill over the sides, creating an end-to-end touch surface. On the left and right side, the iPhone 8’s screen would curve, similar to the “edges” in the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge.\nGet Data Sheet , Fortune’s technology newsletter\nIn order to deliver that feature, the iPhone 8 will need to ship with organic light-emitting diode (OLED) screen technology. It would be the first from Apple to offer OLED. All iPhone versions through the iPhone 7 have run on LCD technology.\n“By using a plastic OLED screen, the screen can bend at the edges to allow a curved bezel-less edge,” the analysts reportedly told investors.\nTheir comments come after several rumors have surfaced saying Apple is working on an OLED-based curved screen. However, Apple has yet to even confirm it’s working on a new smartphone , let alone new display technology, and the analysts acknowledged that the company hasn’t yet made a final decision on the next iPhone’s screen. But evidence suggests Apple’s next iPhone will come with a big display update.\nIn regards to Apple’s iPad, the analysts said that the company will release new tablets in March. Like the iPhone, the new iPads are expected to come with a “bezel-less” design and offer displays that stretch from one side to another. The 9.7-inch model would become the “low-price” version and complement the higher-end 12.9-inch iPad Pro. What’s more, Apple could announce a new 10.9-inch iPad that would feature the bezel-less design.\nApple currently sells 7.9-, 9.7- and 12.9-inch versions of its iPad. Some had anticipated Apple updating the tablets this year, but the company focused instead on a new iPhone and new MacBook Pro.\nThere is some debate over when a bezel-less iPad might surface. Although the Barclays analysts say it’s only a matter of months, a KGI Securities analyst said in a research note recently that Apple likely wouldn’t offer OLED and thus, a curved display, in the iPad until 2018.\nFor more about Apple’s iPhone 7, watch:\nApple hasn’t confirmed any of the rumors and did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",

To see how this plays out in real life, AppleInsider pit the new entry-level MacBook Pro against last year's 13-inch MacBook Air.

      "text": "AirPods Might Only Be Shipping In December  34 PST \nBack in October, Apple announced that the AirPods headphones announced alongside the new iPhones would be delayed . No new shipping date was provided, which led to speculation that we could only see the headphones launched in 2017. There was claims that there could be something wrong with the manufacturing process, hence the delay. \nHowever a couple of days ago, a new report surfaced that claimed that the AirPods would be seeing a release this month . To be more specific, it would be released on the 18th of November, at least that’s according to a retailer in Europe. Now it seems that might no longer be the case . \nAccording to a report from Barclay Research analysts, they are claiming that the AirPods will only be available in December, which if true isn’t so bad since it’s still within 2016. Apparently Apple has been having a hard time managing channel inventory as the company has been reportedly trying to get batch discounts so as to keep their component costs low. \nThe report claims that because of this, Apple’s AirPods will be skipping the Black Friday deals and will probably only see a release late in December, but hopefully in time for the holidays. \nFiled in Apple > Audio > Gadgets .

      "text": "Reddit \nRemember when USB-C was a bad word? It wasn’t long after the original 12-inch MacBook landed that we began our love-hate relationship with USB-C. It was universal, which is great, but without the lineup of our favorite ports on the MacBook, many started to consider life a dongled hell. With the new MacBooks Pro, Apple did its best to change all of that, and its famed reality distortion field helped assuage much of our contempt for USB-C. \nPay close attention, and you’ll notice that the term USB-C was muttered only once during Apple’s MacBook unveiling. Phil Schiller said it, and it was only in reference to the connector’s for-factor. \nInstead, Apple turned the term ‘USB-C’ into ‘Thunderbolt 3,’ which is much more alluring and magical. We tend to think of Thunderbolt as a high-end data transfer port capable of ungodly things — mostly because it’s really that good. \nWith Thunderbolt 3, we’re getting even more good stuff. 40Gbps data transfer is insane, even though it commands a special (expensive!) cable to get there. \nApple’s own website leaves USB-C out of the mix, except to discuss the port’s form-factor. Instead, those connection points on a MacBook are now Thunderbolt. Seeing the trend? Reality distortion. A touch of genius. \nThis isn’t a new strategy, and to be fair — Apple’s not wrong , or lying . The ports are Thunderbolt 3 capable inlets; we’re talking distortion, not lies. \nApple has done this before, too. The original Thunderbolt ports used the same connection type as Mini DisplayPort, but we didn’t really call them that. Like the new Pros, the former had Thunderbolt ports. \nBut we didn’t have such vitriol surrounding Mini DisplayPort, and it wasn’t in use on smartphones or peripherals. Nobody was calling for Apple to make it universal across mobile and desktop. \nBut Thunderbolt — that’s desktop-class, and a technology many equate to Apple anyway. And once again, Apple is spinning things to make them palatable to a wider audience. If we stop thinking of it as USB-C, and stop calling it USB-C — it’s Thunderbolt. Then it’s special . It’s Apple . \nAnd then we stop complaining, and start paying a premium for accessories and dongles because we’ve conditioned ourselves to. Suddenly, and perhaps without even realizing it, everything about the future Apple has pushed us into with these new USB-C Thunderbolt 3 ports seems very normal.",

By: Sumit Chakraborty | Published: November 11, 2016 5:28 PM iOS 10 vs Android Nougat 7.0: Google is leaving no stone unturned to take up Apple’s innovations and take it further, one step at a time. (Source: Reuters) \niOS 10 vs Nougat 7.0: In the battle of operating systems, Google seems to be taking small steps to win the war. It is leaving no stone unturned to take up Apple’s innovations and take it further, one step at a time. And undoubtedly, these steps are bearing fruits as the popularity of Android keeps on increasing each month. According to reports almost 9 out of 10 smartphones in the world have Android, while the rest are divided between Apple iOS, Blackberry, and Windows. The Apple iOS 10 was launched after the unveiling of Apple iPhone 7 lineup. Google rolled out the Android Nougat 7.0 to the Nexus series and then the brand new flagship Google Pixel series. There have been a number of debates on which OS is better. Here is a comparison: User Interface and notifications: \nBoth iOS and Android have long been trying to reach various aspects of each other when it comes to user interface. They have been vying to achieve similar aesthetics of design as that of the other. For starters, this year Android has redesigned its user interface, and the most notable feature is its minimalistic borders. The icons occupy the width of the screen along with smaller fonts. It will be safe to say the Android looks more like iOS this year. iOS too is not far behind, by using the 3D Touch and implementing widgets to the home screen, it has tried to go the Android way here as well. Operating system updates: \nAndroid has long been untethered from its stock applications and has been implementing the updates faster than iOS. This helps because Google doesn’t have to update every default apps each time the main OS is updated, which makes it quicker. But now iOS has made it possible to delete the stock apps, and it may help Apple to push in faster updates. Stock applications and Delete \nNow, its is possible in both iOS 10 and Nougat to delete stock apps. But what the feature does is, it just hides the app instead of deleting it from the device, and that too not all. Photo app \niOS 10 now offers a feature which Google has been providing to its users for a year. It uses machine learning and identifies places and people in the image and users can use it to search as well. Like, if one searches for ‘mountains’ the app with automatically return with images features mountains. The app also creates slideshows with the user’s best images. Hence when it comes to this feature, both of them are going neck to neck. Music applications: \nAlthough Apple has revamped its Music app in iOS 10 with a more simplified navigation and user interface, yet Android has better options. While Apple offers a good streaming option, Google goes one up for its music fans by giving an app which along with streaming also allows the user to store and play music. \nAlso read | OnePlus One & OnePlus 2 to get Android Nougat 7.0, 7.1 Personal assistants Siri and Google Now: \nAccording to reports, Apple has massively improved upon its virtual personal assistant Siri. Siri has better features, and although late, has allowed developers all over the world to provide suggestions with an aim to improve the build. It will be a tough task to compete with Google’s algorithms, in its Google Now, yet the competition can get interesting. Verdict: \nWith the launch of several new high-end smartphones including tech giants like Apple and Samsung, the virtual war has reached very interesting times. Apple and Google’s major operating systems – Android and iOS are fighting it out as well. It is interesting to note that both the platforms have borrowed features from each other and are eventually becoming more similar than ever before. Apart from the platform’s fragmented nature, the update cycles look to be a bit problematic for most parts of the Android Nougat, added with the fact that often only new handsets can receive the updates leaving out most old phones. The problem occurs as the Google’s platform is used by other manufacturers, and they in order to sell new hardware neglect the previous versions of smartphones in a vast majority. Consumers generally have to update their hardware each year. Apple, with its top-down management, has complete control of both its hardware and software. The adoption of latest iOS is very high as the updates are available as soon as it arrives in the market. Please Wait while comments are loading... Trending Now ",

By: FE Online | Published: November 11, 2016 1:10 PM In such uncertain times, agreeable with Donald Trump or not, the CEOs will have to look for opportunities, but at the moment they needed to assure their employees. But is that what most of these CEOs did by taking a middle ground? (Source: Reuters) \nDonald Trump winning the US presidential elections, shocked the world as he defeated Hillary Clinton to head the most powerful country in the World. The 2016 US presidential election is arguably one of the most convoluted and hateful ones ever, with the maximum divide between the people. As a matter of fact, reports have suggested, both Clinton and Trump were the most unpopular presidential candidates ever. After Trump’s win, people reacted in extremes, giving conflicting reasons. This has prompted the heads of top tech giants to address the win and the employees. In such uncertain times, the sentiment is quite evident in the addresses of the tech executives. Trump, according to his earlier campaign speeches has an ‘American-centric’, and it is expected that companies which outsource jobs to countries like China, India and others, will have to pay higher corporate taxes. So, in an uncertain situation, agreeable or not, the CEOs will have to look for opportunities, but at the moment they needed to assure their employees. But is that what most of these CEOs did by taking a middle ground? \nFacebook co-founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg in a Facebook post wrote: “Holding Max, I thought about all the work ahead of us to create the world we want for our children. This work is bigger than any presidency and progress does not move in a straight line. The most important opportunities of Max’s generation — like curing all disease, improving education, connecting everyone and promoting equal opportunity — will take a long-term focus and find new ways for all of us to work together, sometimes over decades. We are all blessed to have the ability to make the world better, and we have the responsibility to do it. Let’s go work even harder.” \nAlso read | Is Facebook responsible for Donald Trump becoming the President? Here’s how it influenced the US election results \nApple CEO Tim Cook, wrote a memo to Apple employees: “We have a very diverse team of employees, including supporters of each of the candidates. Regardless of which candidate each of us supported as individuals, the only way to move forward is to move forward together. While there is a discussion today about uncertainties ahead, you can be confident that Apple’s North Star hasn’t changed. Our company is open to all, and we celebrate the diversity of our team here in the United States and around the world — regardless of what they look like, where they come from, how they worship or who they love.” \nMicrosoft CEO Satya Nadella, in a LinkedIn post, said: “Yesterday we witnessed the democratic process in action here in the US. The results are of importance around the world, and I know that interest is shared among Microsoft employees. We congratulate the president-elect and look forward to working with all those elected yesterday. Our commitment to our mission and values are steadfast, and in particular fostering a diverse and inclusive culture. With that in mind and looking to the future, Brad Smith today outlined in a blog Microsoft’s thoughts and recommendations for the new Administration and Congress .” Please Wait while comments are loading...

      "text": "The next-year iPhone is expected to bring a major overhaul of the existing design, as Apple will celebrate the 10th anniversary of the device, and an analyst now claims that Cupertino is also planning some changes in terms of display size. Barclays forecasts, citing sources from the supply chain, that the iPhone 8 will come with curved screens that will use 5.0-inch and 5.8-inch panels, which means that Apple will increase the size of the iPhone from the existing 4.7- and 5.5-inch models. The iPhone 8 will also adopt a new design, with Apple planning to offer a phone with no bezels, the analyst says. While there’s no confirmation of such a thing, this isn’t the first time we’re hearing about such a plan, with Apple also believed to be working on integrating all front-facing parts into the screen.

Designed for all new Apple products, the WySky Music Light is a one stop shop for playing music, charging your phone, and setting the mood all at the same time. \n“As music lovers, we’ve always loved speaker systems that plug directly into your phone while it charges, but we thought something was missing.” says founder Jeff Wu. “When you listen to music, so much of the pleasure and the experience depends on mood and lighting. So we wanted to combine the sound of music with the ambient lighting of the room, all in a single device. It’s a great way to unwind during dinner, at a party, or with a book or a partner after a long day.” \nMost lamps have a set color -- either warm white light, cold white light, or a colored light. WySky is the first lamp that allows you to blend any color together, which means you can choose the precise shade and color that is best suited to your room or mood. The lamp is fully integrated with iOS 10 (iOS 6.1 and newer), is MFi-approved by Apple, and works with iPhone, iPad, and iPod. The team has gone through several iterations of this product to be able to provide the highest quality sound and light. It includes a 4 inch full-range speaker to fill the room with hi-definition audio and 81 LEDs that won’t burn out or get hot to the touch, and a software interface which allows for selection within a 16 million color spectrum. \nThe WySky Music Lamp is designed to complement and enhance a mindful lifestyle. It was inspired by the founders’ love of music, design, Apple products, and having a quiet and beautiful space to relax every single day. \nIn exchange for pledging to the project, backers can choose from five different styles of varying colors, starting at $99. Each lamp comes will the full range of lighting options, an alarm clock feature, and a 4” full range speaker. Backers have until Wednesday, November 23rd to pre-order and can expect to receive their Music Lamps in January 2017. \nFor more information, visit the Kickstarter page, or contact Scott Hughes at . \nAbout WySky: WySky is an upcoming lifestyle brand and design studio based in Shanghai and Los Angeles, focused on creating the most innovative and intuitive Apple accessories in the world. \nFor additional information:",

      "text": "Shutterstock April 27, 2016 | 11:22AM PT \nUPDATED : An Apple employee was found dead in a conference room at the tech giant’s headquarters in Cupertino, Calif., on Wednesday. \nThe employee — 25-year-old Edward Thomas Mackowiak, identified as a software engineer in a LinkedIn profile that has since been taken down — committed suicide, dying of a self-inflicted gunshot to the head, police said Thursday night. \n“The Medical Examiner determined the manner of death was suicide and the cause was a gunshot to the head,” the Santa Clara County Sheriff’s Office said in a statement. \nA spokesperson with the Santa Clara County Fire Department told Variety on Wednesday that the fire department was dispatched to Infinite Loop at 8:30 a.m. in regards to a man with a head wound, but were told to stand down upon arrival. \nSgt. Andrea Urena from the Santa Clara County Sheriff’s Department confirmed during a press conference on Wednesday afternoon that the man found dead was an Apple employee. There were no other people involved and no one else is at risk, Urena added. She could not provide further details or comment on whether a weapon was found at the scene of the crime. \n“We are heartbroken by the tragic loss of a young and talented coworker,” Apple said in a statement on Wednesday night. “Our thoughts and deepest sympathies go out to his family and friends, including the many people he worked with here at Apple.” \nAccording to police scanner audio obtained by TMZ , a call came in to dispatch as a “possible suicide.” According to the audio, a female employee was involved in an argument and sustained a head wound, possibly from a gunshot. Cops describe a body being found in a conference room and say that person had a gun, at one point in the call. \nHere’s the full audio: \nAt Apple campus Infinite Loop, for a 1056 attempt… female employee bleeding with a head wound to the head… possibly has a gun. Her… looks like security was escorting the employee down and the Westside units are just now arriving… I do have further… they are advising that there’s a body in one of the conference rooms with a gun so we’re not really sure if there’s multiple people involved.

      "text": "Target Black Friday ad arrives with huge discounts for Apple’s iPad Pro, iPad Air 2 By Marrianne Ledesma Nov 11, 2016 01:32 PM EST An Apple iPad Air photographed on a white background, taken on November 6, 2013. Advertisement \nMany people could not wait for the Black Friday deals especially for the discounts in different gadgets. \nIn a WCPO report, Target has already released its 2016 Black Friday ad. Target will not be participating the anti-Thanksgiving crowd. Instead, they will be opening at 6 p.m. on the Thanksgiving Day this year. \nTarget will be having an \"Early Access\" sale, which will allow customers to grab great Black Friday deals today. All of their deals will change each day as part of their \"10 Days of Deals\". \nGood thing that we got the latest updates here in HNGN! \nTarget will highlight the three Apple tablets. According to ZDNet , iPad Pro will be included in the highlights but will still be sold for its regular price at $599. \nGood thing that this 9.7-inch model will be $150 less during the Black Friday. Well, Target will also highlight the iPad 3 for $274, which is $125 less than the regular price! \nMoreover, iPad Mini 2 will only be sold for $200 ($199.79) or almost less than $70 than the original price. \nMeanwhile, Target also got other Black Friday deals as they will be joining with BJ's wholesale and staples. Through this, they will be offering Amazon's Kindle Fire 7-inch on sale for $33.33 at 6 p.m. Also, BJ's wholesale will offer a cheaper Android option which is the 10.1-inch Polaroid with a Bluetooth for only $59.99. \nAlso, for laptop followers, Target has its line up by offering an HP 15-ba042nr notebook with an AMD A10 quad-core processor, 4GB of RAM, a terabyte hard drive, 15.6-inch display and a built-in DVD for only $259.99, or a discount of $140 from the current price. \nUltimately, Target will offer direct discounts in every purchase and not just sell tablets then give out some gift cards, which could be a form of enticement for the customers. \n",

      "text": "Customers who were quick to put in orders for Apple's new Touch Bar equipped MacBook Pros may be receiving their devices a tad earlier than expected . While the initial delivery window for early buyers ranged from November 17 to November 25, we're now seeing reports that Apple is preparing some units for delivery as early as November 11.\nDON'T MISS: Target Black Friday 2016 ad leaks: Huge iPhone 7, Xbox One S, TV, and other tech deals\nThat being the case, we can expect some early adopters to start receiving Apple's revamped MacBook Pro as early as this weekend with many more deliveries expected to arrive on doorsteps before November 17.\nOver the last few weeks, Apple's new MacBook Pro has been absolutely eviscerated from developers and professionals. From complaints about the device's USB C ports and lack of an SD Card reader to complaints about a 16GB RAM limit and less than impressive internals, one would be forgiven for thinking that Apple's next-gen notebook was destined to be a flop.\nThe reality, though, is that most Mac users appear to be excited for Apple's new Touch Bar MacBook Pro. To this point, Apple's Phil Schiller said earlier this month that Apple has seen \"more orders for the new MacBook Pro than any other pro notebook before.\"\n“So there certainly are a lot of people as excited as we are about it,\" Schiller added.\nOn a related note, early figures from Slice Intelligence suggest that the new MacBook Pro is selling like hotcakes. We'll of course no more once Apple releases its earnings report in January, but for now it would appear that the Mac is not only far from dead, but may be thriving.\nView photos\nTrending right now:\nBest Buy has a great Black Friday Galaxy S7 deal you can use right now Best Buy Black Friday 2016 ad: iPhone 7, PS4 Pro bundle, TVs, and other huge deals Target Black Friday 2016 ad leaks: Huge iPhone 7, Xbox One S, TV, and other tech deals See the original version of this article on BGR.com",

      "text": "By David Morgan\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - Donald Trump's White House victory moves Apple <AAPL.O>, Pfizer <PFE.N>, Microsoft <MSFT.O> and other big U.S. corporations much closer than they have been in years to winning a big tax break on $2.6 trillion in foreign profits.\nTax reform is shaping up as among the most fruitful areas for cooperation between Trump and his fellow Republicans, who held control in Tuesday's elections of both the House of Representatives and the Senate.\nTrump and congressional Republicans have separate, but similar, tax reform plans. Both would slash tax rates on businesses, simplify and cut individual taxes, and let companies bring overseas profits into the country at a low tax rate, raising prospects for a sweeping deal on taxes.\nBipartisan support for corporate tax reform has been growing as multinational companies have amassed tax-deferred profits abroad and brought continuous lobbying pressure over a decade for a tax break on them.\n\"On tax policy, he's basically adopted the House blueprint as his approach,\" said Rohit Kumar, co-leader of the tax policy services practice at Big Four accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers [PWC.UL].\n\"There's a better chance that something happens next year than there has been at any point in the last several years.\"\nAt the heart of the issue is a law that lets U.S. companies hold foreign profits overseas without paying U.S. corporate tax on them, unless and until those profits are brought into the United States, which is known as repatriation.\nCorporations have $2.6 trillion stashed abroad under this law. That money could be repatriated any time, but businesses choose not to because it would incur the 35 percent statutory corporate income tax.\nTrump and House Republicans, including Speaker Paul Ryan, would still need to agree on how to pay for lower corporate tax rates and on whether U.S.-based multinationals should pay U.S. taxes on future foreign profits.\nTrump and congressional Republicans would also need support for tax reform from Democrats if they intend to present the package as a benefit for the country as a whole, analysts say.\nSuch proposals have stumbled before on Democrats' objections that they are corporate give-away, and on Republicans' insistence that they be paired with a cut in the corporate income tax rate.\nDemocrats could still block legislation they dislike from reaching the floor of the Senate, which requires a super majority of 60 votes to advance a measure, but there are procedural maneuvers Republicans could use to bypass them.\nThe one-time surge in revenue that would result from repatriation could help fund another cornerstone of Trump's campaign platform -- a pledge to boost the economy through big investments in U.S. highways, roads, bridges, airports and seaports.\nInfrastructure spending was not a campaign priority for congressional Republicans. But a new job-creating program could appeal to Democrats and be valuable to lawmakers in the 2018 mid-term elections.\nThe four companies with the largest profits held overseas are: Apple Inc ($200 billion), Pfizer Inc ($194 billion), Microsoft Corp ($108 billion) and General Electric Co <GE.N> ($104 billion), according to March estimates by Citizens for Tax Justice, a corporate income tax watchdog group in Washington. (Graphic: http://tmsnrt.rs/2eBx2BO).\nThe European Commission in August hit Apple with a 13 billion euro ($14.3 billion) bill for back taxes, fanning concerns among other U.S. multinationals and U.S. officials that their untaxed foreign revenues could be vulnerable to further European penalties.\nApple CEO Tim Cook told an interviewer in September that he expects to repatriate billions of dollars in global profits to the United States in 2017 but did not say how. He said in another interview that the company would not bring money back unless there was \"a fair rate\" and said he was optimistic that tax reform would occur next year.\nBUSINESS SUPPORT\nThe House tax plan, which Ryan and other leading Republicans promoted throughout the campaign, would lower the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 20 percent, force multinationals to repatriate existing foreign earnings and adopt a \"territorial\" system that would largely end taxation of U.S. companies' foreign income.\nTrump is calling for a steeper rate cut to 15 percent, and he has proposed a 10 percent tax rate for repatriated overseas profits held in cash, payable over a decade.\nSome are optimistic that those differences can be overcome.\n\"In the end, there are no differences that can't be solved on the tax issue,\" said Republican Representative Tom Cole.\nThe House Republican plan has had significant support from business.\nKumar's PwC advises the Alliance for Competitive Taxation, which lobbies on tax reform for over 40 companies ranging from Alcoa Inc <AA.N> and Cisco Systems Inc <CSCO.O> to Alphabet's Google Inc <GOOGL.O>, Procter & Gamble Co <PG.N> and Wal-Mart Stores Inc <WMT.N>.\n\"We know what we want,\" said Dorothy Coleman, a tax policy expert at the National Association of Manufacturers, referring to a lower corporate tax rate, adopting a \"modern, competitive\" territorial system, and a permanent R&D credit among other wishes.\nThe House's corporate tax plan would cut revenues by more than $890 billion over 10 years, according to the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center. The same research group says Trump's corporate plan would reduce revenues by $2.6 trillion.\nTrump and Republicans in Congress view tax reform as a way to jump-start economic growth and job creation.\nBusiness lobbyists say that higher tax revenues from a growing economy would address much of the House plan's shortfall. Trump advisers say revenue erosion posed by the president-elect's plan would be overcome by growth and policy initiatives including a more aggressive approach to trade.\n(Additional reporting by Susan Cornwell; Editing by Kevin Drawbaugh and Stuart Grudgings)",

      "text": "Product Details \nThe iPhone 6 represents Apple's second largest departure in terms of design since the iPhone 4, and ushers in an era of rounded aesthetics. Equipped with a 4.7-inch display, the iPhone 6 is also much larger than its predecessor, the iPhone 5s, but Apple has managed to trim some extra fat in order to make the new iPhone even thinner, at 0.27 in (6.9 mm). The innards of the iPhone 6, too, went through improvements. The home-grown dual-core A8 processor is the third consecutive Apple chip to be custom-designed, and offers performance improvements of up to 25% and 50% in the of CPU and GPU departments respectively. The 8-megapixel, 1/3” iSight camera also received several upgrades, mostly on the software side, and now offers faster, phase detection auto focus, plus support for super-smooth 720p clips at the industry-leading 240 frames per second. \nNote: Enlarge images for color naming.

      "text": "Product Details \nThe 11.6\" MacBook Air Notebook Computer from Apple is an ultraportable notebook computer with a thin and lightweight design. Apple's engineers have leveraged the lessons they learned in designing the miniaturized iPad and applied them to the design of this 2.38-pound computer. MacBook Air is powered by the fourth-generation Haswell Intel Core i5 processor. \nThis ultra-efficient architecture was designed to use less power and still deliver high performance. This means not only can you do whatever you want - you can keep doing it for longer than before. In addition, the new Intel HD Graphics 5000 offers up to 40 percent faster graphics - performance you'll especially notice with games and other graphics-intensive tasks. MacBook Air now supports ultrafast 802.11ac Wi-Fi. \nWhen connected to an 802.11ac base station - including the new AirPort Extreme and AirPort Time Capsule - wireless performance is up to 3x faster than with the previous generation of MacBook Air. And Your Wi-Fi range improves as well. With Bluetooth technology, you can connect MacBook Air to Bluetooth-enabled devices like speakers and headphones. Corner to corner and pixel by pixel, the MacBook Air display is both an engineering feat and a design breakthrough. The display measures a mere 4.86 millimeters (0.19 inch) thin, yet its resolution makes you feel like you're looking at a larger screen. The 11.6\" MacBook Air features a native resolution of 1366 by 768 pixels. LED backlighting makes colors bright and vibrant from edge to edge. SKU: ",

      "text": "Ever since Apple introduced its new MacBook Pro about two weeks ago, the chorus of detractors who have been quick to point out everything that's wrong with Apple's new notebook has been incessant and deafening. By and large, developers and professionals are unhappy with the fact that they patiently waited for years for a meaningful MacBook Pro upgrade only to see Apple deliver a machine that uses the 'Pro' moniker rather loosely.\nDON'T MISS: Best Buy has a great Black Friday Galaxy S7 deal you can use right now\nThat notwithstanding, it is entirely possible that the controversy surrounding Apple's new MacBook Pro is much ado about nothing. Sure, a small minority of pro users who absolutely need 32GB of RAM no questions asked may be unhappy, but for the majority of customers who will end up buying the machine, it would appear that the new MacBook Pro is a lot more compelling than some are giving it credit for.\nSpeaking to this point, professional video editor Thomas Carter recently took to The Huffington Post where he penned a mini-review of Apple's new MacBook Pro and came away rather impressed. For some additional context, Carter said that he's been using Apple's new Touch Bar equipped MacBook Pro for about a week on actual work-related video projects.\nAs for the specs, which some critics have understandably called disappointing, Carter suggests we have nothing to worry about.\nFirst off, It’s really fast. I’ve been using the MacBook Pro with the new version of FCP X and cutting 5k ProRes material all week, it’s buttery smooth. No matter what you think the specs say, the fact is the software and hardware are so well integrated it tears strips off “superior spec’d” Windows counterparts in the real world.\nOf course, what people are mostly interested in is whether or not the vaunted Touch Bar is a gimmick or if it's actually huge step forward in usability. To this point, Carter leans towards the latter in what is the best encapsulation of the Touch Bar's utility I've seen yet.\nFor years we’ve had single mouse inputs on a graphical user interface. Over time we’ve added more buttons and scroll wheels, trackpads with gestures. The Touch Bar takes this step further by allowing multiple inputs at the same time and combines well with the trackpad. The more I’ve used it the more I’ve replaced certain keyboard shortcuts. Why would I use dual-hand/multi-finger shortcuts if the button was there in front of me? And it’s contextual. It changes depending on what I’m doing. I’m editing picture; it shows me relevant trimming shortcuts. I’m editing titles; it shows me font, formatting and colour options. All without the need to open other menus. It works, it’s faster and it’s more productive.\nSo while hardcore developers and professionals who need insanely tricked out machines may be understandably bummed by Apple's new MacBoo Pro, it really looks as if most everyone else will be more than thrilled with the machine. Indeed, Phil Schiller last week said that orders for Apple's new MacBook Pro with the Touch Bar are higher than what Apple has seen for \"any other pro notebook before.”\n“So there certainly are a lot of people as excited as we are about it,” Schiller added.\nCarter's full take on the MacBook Pro can be seen via the source link below.\nTrending right now:\nBest Buy has a great Black Friday Galaxy S7 deal you can use right now Best Buy and Target have iPhone 7 Black Friday deals you shouldn’t miss Target Black Friday 2016 ad leaks: Huge iPhone 7, Xbox One S, TV, and other tech deals See the original version of this article on BGR.com",

      "text": "About two weeks ago, Apple said that the company's new AirPods weren't going to hit store shelves as early as anticipated. Without getting into too much detail, Apple issued a prepared statement indicating that the company needed a \"a little more time before AirPods are ready for our customers.” Recently, an optimistic, albeit sketchy, rumor hinted that Apple might begin shipping AirPods to retail outlets as early as late next week. Unfortunately, the rumor now appears to be off-the-mark in light of a new research report which claims that AirPods production might not even begin until December. And as if that weren't frustrating enough, the initial production run is said to be for just limited quantities.\n\nDON'T MISS:  Leak suggests the iPhone 8 will finally get the redesign it deserves \nCiting sources close to Apple's supply chain, analysts from Barclays Research write that AirPods won't even hit the production line for at least another three to four weeks at best. What remains unclear, though, is when in December Apple is hoping to begin production. Apple would ideally like to have AirPods packaged and ready for purchase in time for the holiday shopping season, but that's starting to look less and less likely with each passing week. In fact, we wouldn't be surprised in the slightest if AirPods don't start shipping until early January of 2017.\nMacRumors reports :\n\nBarclays said the initial production run will be \"fairly small,\" totaling between 10 million and 15 million AirPods to start. Depending on demand, the limited supply could result in a scenario where AirPods stock is quickly depleted upon launch, resulting in extended shipping estimates akin to a new iPhone launch.\nAll in all, this isn't a good look for Apple. While it's one thing to give users a sneak peek at an upcoming product, promising a launch in October only to delay said launch for as much as two to three months is something that Apple observers used to mock other tech companies for.\nTrending right now: \nThe best feature of AT&T’s new $35 TV subscription might be illegal Leak suggests the iPhone 8 will finally get the redesign it deserves Best Buy and Target have iPhone 7 Black Friday deals you shouldn’t miss See the original version of this article on BGR.com",

The list is not limited to the iPhone and iPad only, since a MacBook could also be seen in the screenshot. Moreover, there’s an option that states “Get help with other products,” so the app could also have information about Apple’s other products aside from its smartphones, tablets and MacBooks. \nApple Support app screenshot Photo: The Netherlands App Store \nAccording to Engadget , reports about a standalone Apple support app have been circulating the web since last year, but it is only this week that the rumored app is materialized.

Cut top off each apple; scoop out and discard core and seeds, using knife and spoon to hollow out each apple. 2 In small bowl, mix pie filling and cinnamon. Spoon filling into each apple. Filling should be slightly mounded; do not overfill. 3 Unroll pie crust, and cut into fourths (one for each apple). Cut each piece of crust into 1/2-inch strips. Lay strips of dough on top of each apple. Alternate weaving of another dough strip over and under strips already in place. Repeat until top of each apple is covered. Trim excess pie crust around edges with knife. 4 Place apples in ungreased 8-inch square (2-quart) baking dish; pour 1/4 inch water in baking dish around apples.

But since apples vary in size, just make sure to mound filling slightly; do not overfill. To make your own apple filling: In 10-inch nonstick skillet, melt 3 tablespoons butter over medium heat. Add 3 cups peeled, cored, chopped Granny Smith apples, 1/3 cup packed brown sugar and 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon. Cook 8 to 10 minutes, stirring frequently, until apples are tender.

      "text": "  \n(Reuters/JONATHAN ALCORN) Residents shop at Walmart as the store prepares for Black Friday in Los Angeles, California. \nAmericans everywhere are gearing up for Black Friday — the one day a year when shoppers can go crazy because of the massive discounts from retailers. People usually flock to the tech aisle during this time because that's where they get the most bang for their buck. And one particular brand of choice is Apple. \nThere is no denying that Apple products are very popular and extremely sought after. And with huge price slashes, it's hard to say no to a new iPad or MacBook. But what stores offer the best deals ? \nWalmart is one of the largest retailers in the country. And this year, customers can get an iPhone 5s for only $99, which is $50 cheaper than its original price. They can also buy an iPad Mini 2 for only $199. Apart from that, the retailer is also going to offer a $0 down on any iPhone bought through AT&T Next or Verizon Device Payment. A $250 gift card is also included. \nFor Best Buy customers, Apple products like the iPad Pro, iMac, MacBook Air, and the new iPhone 7 will be discounted. Customers can purchase the 9.7-inch iPad Pro for $125 less, while selected MacBook Air models will be slashed by $200. The iPhone SE can be bought for $160 off, with a $10 monthly installment. Apple's iMac will also be available for only $900, while the 27-inch Retina 5K iMac will be available for $1,599.99. A $50 discount can also be found with the Apple Watch series 1. Finally, Best Buy will give out gift cards for iPhone 7 purchases. Advertisement \nAnother big name in the retail industry is Target. Customers can get the new iPhone 7 or iPhone 7 Plus free of charge with a selected network plan of Sprint, Verizon, or AT&T. iPad Air 2 variants will get a $126 price slash, while iPad Mini 2 models will have $70 off, with the 32 GB iPad Mini 2 at $199 instead of $269. The iPad Pro, on the other hand, can be purchased for only $499. \nOf course, since Black Friday falls on Thanksgiving week, some stores have different operating hours and others will start early with their sales.

      "text": "In the smartphone wars, the two biggest players are Samsung and Apple. Samsung has had some problems lately, and the hype for the iPhone isn’t what it used to be. Electronics testers at Consumer Reports measure lots of features on every phone they test, including battery life, ease of use, and video and photo quality. \nIf a long-lasting battery is important to you, the Galaxy S7 beats the iPhone 7, with more than 20 hours of talk time. The iPhone 7 provides only 8 hours of talk time. You’ll get 13 hours with the larger iPhone 7 Plus.\nIn Consumer Reports’ camera testing, the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus both did well. Apple had claimed there would be a performance improvement in low-light photography over the 6S, but testing didn’t find much difference. After all its testing, CR says the camera on the Galaxy S7 rated higher because it takes better images and videos. \nApple has gotten a lot of attention for dropping the iPhone headphone jack. That’s something you’ll still find on the Samsung Galaxy S7. Consumer Reports says don’t worry about losing sound quality with the iPhones’ new lightning-connected headphones or even the headphone adapter included in the box.",

      "text": "Reddit \nWith no previous announcement, Apple has debuted a new tvOS app for the latest fourth-gen Apple TV that helps kids read along to some of their favorite books. Called iBooks StoryTime , the app, available for free on the App Store, displays interactive books on the TV screen with the Read-Aloud feature, as well as lets pages be flipped with the Siri Remote’s touch pad. \nRead-Aloud features narration for the books, along with displaying subtitles on-screen to read along to. For supported books, things like sound effects and highlighted words are shown, and multiple character voices are used. When this mode is enabled, pages will automatically turn as the narration progresses. \nThere’s also the option to turn Read-Aloud off, allowing pages to be turned with a swipe on the remote. This is designed to be used when a parent reads to a child themselves, or the child wants to practice reading themselves. \n“iBooks StoryTime gives your family a different way to experience classic kids’ books and discover new favorites. With Read-Aloud narration and beautiful illustrations, every handpicked title in the app transforms the Apple TV.” \nAmong the supported Read-Along titles are Green Eggs and Ham , The ABCs of Cookies , The Little Red Hen , Goodnight Moon , Meet Tracker , Big Brother Daniel , and Chicka Chicka ABC . These can be purchased from iBooks on any iOS device, and they’ll automatically sync to the Apple TV. The iBooks StoryTime app also comes with Dora’s Big Buddy Race Read-Along Storybook for free, so Apple TV users can give it a try before buying anything.",

      "text": "The tenth anniversary of the iPhone range comes next year, and Apple is expected to launch something outstanding in order to mark the occasion. Thus, the iPhone 8 could be the revolutionary smartphone that Apple fans have desired for some time. Recent iPhone releases have been somewhat conservative, and followers of the iconic smartphone series are hoping for something more ambitious when the iPhone 8 launches.\nImage Credit: Veniamin Geskin / Twitter While the iPhone 7 has sold pretty well for Apple, The next generation smartphone will be expected to make real strides forward over this release. So how will Apple build on the iPhone 7 and how will the iPhone 8 compare to the previous generation? Here is the latest news on the most important smartphone release of 2017.\niPhone 8 vs. iPhone 7 – Design Early rumors on the iPhone 8 suggest that Apple may completely redesign the smartphone for release next year. Despite the iconic nature of the iPhone design, this is probably overdue, with recent iPhone releases having been rather similar.\nIn order to fulfil this remit, Apple may consider slimming down the bezels included in the iPhone 8. Some of the more radical suggestions have indicated that Apple could completely eliminate bezels from the device, producing an edge-to-edge display .\nApple could remove the Home button from the iPhone 8 and rely on touch-based functionality instead. There have also been reports suggesting that Apple could consider switching to non-aluminum casing when the iPhone 8 is released. Ming-Chi Kuo, the infamous analyst with KGI securities, is among the sources that have suggested this.\nMeanwhile, president of display firm Sharp, Tai Jeng-wu, also an executive of Foxconn, recently made a speech to students at Tatung University, in which he suggested that switching to OLED is essential for Apple to halt declining sales. He described the situation as “a crisis, but also also an opportunity”.\nDisplay Apple could do away with the traditional LCD display when the iPhone 8 is released, finally switching to the OLED technology which has been linked with the range in recent years. This screen technology has proved particularly popular in Samsung Galaxy devices, and it is possible that the Korean corporation will even be enlisted to provide OLED displays for the iPhone 8.\nThese reports solidified recently, with Apple Insider noting that the multinational banking and financial services giant J.P. Morgan had uncovered some interesting information on this matter. J.P. Morgan apparently discovered a leaked purchase order for $4 billion, coinciding with a similar order uncovered in the third quarter, believed to be related to Apple outsourcing panels from Samsung in order to deliver OLED in the iPhone 8.\nWireless and super-fast charging Apple has yet to support wireless charging in the iPhone range, but this is expected to alter when the iPhone 8 is released. Reports have been multiplying which suggest that Apple will finally introduce a wireless charging system in the iPhone 8 generation, and that the corporation has also been working on ultra-fast charging technology in order to ensure that this is more convenient for consumers.\nIt is notable that the iPhone 7 Plus requires 3 hours and 30 minutes to fully charge, considered a lengthy period in comparison to competitors such as the Pixel XL and the Galaxy S7 Edge. Apple may utilize both software and hardware improvements in order to close the gap, and even supersede, competitors.\nUSB Type-C The overwhelming likelihood is that Apple will introduce USB Type-C with the iPhone 8, ensuring that the device is on par with numerous rival devices. The iPhone 7 featured conventional USB connectors.\nImage Source: daptr.com Camera Apple has somewhat concentrated on camera upgrades in recent iPhone releases, and this is expected to continue when the iPhone 8 is released. Perhaps central to this process will be the inclusion of a dual-lens snapper in all iPhone 8 devices.\nThe California corporation is also likely to bump up the megapixel rating of the camera, and could even consider some of the more outlandish suggestions from the past, such as a DSLR lens or the unique periscope design which has been linked with the iPhone series.\nWhat is certain is that the photographic capabilities of the iPhone 8 will be improved over the previous generation device. This is considered increasingly essential in the smartphone niche, and one way that manufacturers can particularly set aside new releases from previous generations.\nProcessor and RAM We can expect the iPhone 8 to include 3GB of RAM when it is released, improving on the 2GB included in the iPhone 7. Apple had previously claimed that the A10 processor included in the iPhone 7 was the most powerful chip ever utilized by a smartphone. But the next generation processor will further update the iPhone concept, with the iPhone 8 likely to include the first ever true quad-core processor in Apple smartphone history.\nColors Apple has placed a particular emphasis on customization options in recent device releases, and this is expected to extend to the iPhone 8 when it hits the stores next year. Central to this process will be the introduction of new colors, with a Deep Blue color option particularly mooted. Apple introduced two new colors for the iPhone 7, Jet Black and Black, So Apple may once again choose to make two new iPhone colors available in 2017. Alongside the Deep Blue, we could see some of the color schemes utilized in the Apple Watch range made available for iPhone users.\nModels Another recent report has suggested that Apple will introduce a five-inch iPhone 8 model in 2017, as the company continues to diversify its key product range in order to meet consumer demand. This would mean that there would be four separate iPhone models available on the market, with 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch standard iPhone 8 units accompanied by the 4-inch iPhone SE released earlier this year.\niPhone X Finally, a few reports have rather outlandishly suggested that Apple could decide to brand the iPhone 8 as the iPhone X, to acknowledge the tenth anniversary of the iPhone range. An unlikely nation, but one to keep an eye on as the release date of the device nears.\nThe post iPhone 8 vs. iPhone 7: What New Features Will Apple Include? appeared first on ValueWalk .\n",

      "title": "How to use iMessage on iOS 10",
      "text": "Apple iPhone 7 Plus \nWith the release of iOS 10, Apple completely revamped its iMessage platform, transforming it from a simple SMS replacement to a feature-packed messaging experience. We love it, and we’re sure you do as well, but are you aware of all the little features it contains, and how to access them? Maybe not, because although Apple is usually good at making its software rather easy to use, iMessage makes use of new techniques that may not be familiar. Whether you’re an iOS newbie or a seasoned veteran, here’s how to get the most from iMessage on your iPhone. Getting started with iMessage Does it work on my phone? \nTo use the new iMessage platform, you need to have iOS 10 installed on your phone, and so do the people you’re messaging. It’s worth mentioning, for those completely unfamiliar with iMessage, that it’s purely Apple-to-Apple, and you can’t send an iMessage to an Android phone (or vice versa). \nYou can send iMessages to iPhones, iPads, iPods, and MacOS installed on laptops and desktop computers, provided you’re signed in to the same iCloud account on all devices. There are a few settings to enable on each device to make this happen. It’s also easy to know whether you’re exchanging iMessages with someone, given the chat balloons are blue instead of the green that denotes SMS messages. Enabling iMessage \nOn your iOS device, ensure iMessage is activated by checking the following: \nGo to Settings > General , and scroll down to Messages . The iMessage slider should be in the on position. One other important thing to note is that if you have Reduce Motion turned on, then the animations don’t work. Go to Settings, General , and Accessibility to turn the feature off if they’re not working. \nIn MacOS, find the Messages icon in the Dock, open it, and open Accounts from the Messages menu in the top-left portion of the screen. Here, enter your associated Apple ID and password, then click Sign In . Your messages and contacts should then sync. The difference between the two is that not all iOS 10’s super effects, apps, and GIFs show up on your Mac, nor can they be sent out via your computer. Use iMessage on your iPhone \nSending and receiving iMessages is no different than sending and receiving SMS message, and it’s all done through the default Messages app installed in iOS. If you’ve used iMessage before and this is your first time using the new app, you’ll notice some changes. The most obvious are the three icons in the bottom left of the screen, which are the gateway to most of iMessage’s new features. Text effects \nWe’ll dig into iMessage’s cool features in a moment — let’s deal with sending messages first. To send a message, simply enter what you want to say into the text field in iMessage and tap the blue arrow to send it. Before you do, however, hold down the arrow to bring up additional options. \nThe first of two menu screens will appear, giving you the chance to add a new effect to your message. Slam , Loud , Gentle , and Invisible Ink all see your words accompanied by the corresponding effect, which gives them more impact and allows you to convey an emotion. Just tap which one you want to apply the effect and send your message. \nIf none of the aforementioned text effects seem appealing, tap the Screen option and select a screen effect. You can use balloons, fireworks, lasers, confetti, or a shooting star to alter the look of the screen when the message arrives. If none of these are suitable, just tap “X” to return to the standard message view. Reactions \nReactions are another fun feature. Rather than add an emoji after a message comes through, how about adding your reaction to the message itself? Say you get a message you agree with, and you want to give it the thumbs up. Long press the message, and a series of reactions will appear. These include a heart, a thumbs up or down, an exclamation point, a question mark, and a “Haha.” Simply tap the appropriate reaction to affix it to the message balloon.",

      "text": "Nov 12, 2016 7:00 AM \nSomeone has found a video of Steve Jobs saying words! Quick, to the Opiniontron! \nWriting for Quartz , Mike Murphy says “Steve Jobs would probably be rather upset with what Apple has become today.” (Tip o’ the antlers to Bob Copus.) \nIt is continually amazing how those who best knew Steve Jobs were not the ones who worked with him day in and out to build Apple into the company it’s become but instead the pundits who critique the company. \nWhich, duh, right? Seems so obvious now that it’s in front of our faces but somehow it seemed counter-intuitive before. \n…the company released a new iPhone that looked much like the last two it put out… \nIt doesn’t matter if it has new “features”, what matters is it kinda looks the same as the previous version. \nNote that this is considered a plus for Apple’s competitors. “Looks just like an iPhone!” \n…and its other notable innovations of late have been making its products in different sizes and unleashing a sea of dongles on the world. \nSteve Jobs never ditched old technology in favor of new despite the fact that it would create temporary inconvenience. \nUh… \nIn an old interview that’s making the rounds online today, former CEO Steve Jobs explained, in his mind why companies like Xerox, a company that once had one of the most innovative research labs in the world, failed. \nOoh, look! A video of Steve Jobs saying stuff! Let’s see if we can use it to hit Apple over the head! Which, admittedly, is what we try to use everything for. \nThat time we tried to hit them over the head with pudding was a real mess. \n“If you were a product person, you couldn’t change the course of that company very much,” Jobs said. “So who influenced the success of PepsiCo? The sales and marketing people… \nDoes anyone really think for even a second that sales and marketing at Apple drove the decision to remove the headphone jack? \n“When you have a monopoly market share, the company’s not any more successful.” \n… \nApple doesn’t technically have a monopoly on smartphones or laptop computers or the other categories of products it produces. But… \nBut laser kittens are eating my undershorts. \nApple is the only company that is failing because it has a laughably small market share compared to its competitors but, eh, they’re also kind of a monopoly because mumble mumble, honk-honk, seltzer spray, throws down smoke grenade and escapes. \nWhen you have to stretch Jobs’s words so far to get this around Apple, it’s like grabbing a Sharpie and adding your own globs to a Rorschach test. \n“There. Now it looks like a bunny. A bunny that hates Apple.” \n…its notoriously rapturous marketing-speak about upgrades that merely bring its products up to par with competitors is wearing thin with its critics. \nUh-huh. Well, except in the explosion department and the looks-like-an-iPhone-but-isn’t-water-resistant department . \nTruth is, we don’t know what Apple would be like right now if Steve Jobs were still alive and running the company. It experienced some downturns under his watch as well. We do know that he told the people he worked with not to worry about what he’d do. It’s a shame pundits don’t take that to heart, too.

      "text": "New iPads might be coming...in March 2017.\nApple's iPads are rumored to be getting refreshed in the spring, according to a Barclays Research note obtained by MacRumors .\nSEE ALSO: iPhone 8 rumored to have larger, curved screens that extend to the edges\nAnalysts there believe that Apple is currently considering three differently sized displays for new iPads. In addition to 9.7- and 12.9-inch screens, Apple's reportedly considering a larger iPad with a 10.9-inch display.\nA new iPad with a larger 10-inch screen has been the source of previous rumors , although those pegged a new the screen to be 10.1 or 10.5 inches .\nIf true, it would be ahuge departure\nThe most interesting part of Barclays' note is that the new 10.9-inch iPad might be \"bezel-free,\" meaning the screen would stretch edge-to-edge. The iPad's physical dimensions reportedly won't change, just the screen.\nIf true, it would be a huge departure for Apple to remove the Home button/Touch ID sensor. Such a design could also serve as a glimpse at the iPhone 8, which is also rumored to have bezel-free screens.\nAnother nugget from the report states the iPad mini 4 will remain, but won't be updated, which is the complete opposite of another rumor from last month that said Apple might be working on an iPad Mini Pro.\nLastly, the analysts claim the 12.9-inch iPad Pro will get the 9.7-inch's quad microphones and superior TrueTone display and improved 12-megapixel iSight camera and True Tone flash.\nWith no new iPads coming by the end of the year, next spring seems like a good bet to see refreshes.",

      "text": "Inside this laundromat there's a coding school Programmers are in hot demand. Tech companies are especially eager to grab talent as fast as they can find it. \"We're interviewing people every week,\" said Neha Jain, a senior software engineer with LinkedIn. \"Every time we get a great idea at LinkedIn, the question is always -- who will work on that project?\" \nBut there's a problem: Businesses want to bring on more engineers but the pipeline isn't always market ready. Many young software graduates don't get hired because they don't have on-the-job experience. \nTo help streamline the process of finding stronger candidates, Jain serves as a mentor at the Holberton School, based in San Francisco. \nDora Korpar, currently a Holberton student, was recently hired by San Francisco--based data storage firm Scality. It's a a new two-year college-alternative course for programmers that shuns teacher-led instruction and students for the workplace in half the time of a formal college. \nCo-founded in 2016 by Sylvain Kalache -- also software engineer and a former colleague of Jain's -- the school offers training you'd typically at a workplace. \nRelated: In Charleston, underserved kids get coding classes in a neighborhood laundromat \n\"Software engineering is a craft,\" Kalache said. \"You're better at it the more you practice. At a four-year college, you're passively listening to teachers and improving your mind but maybe not your application skills.\" \nTech knowledge can also become obsolete by graduation. \n\"Technology moves so fast,\" he said. \"What you learned in your freshman and sophomore year is redundant two years later.\" \nAlmost half of Holberton's students are women and more than half are minorities. \nWith no formal instruction, the school's objective is to teach students how to learn both on their own and from peers, similar to what occurs at an office. \nThe course is split into three parts: Nine months of training on software engineering fundamentals, a six month internship and nine more months focused on specialization. \nThe school launched with a small cohort of 30 students and offered free tuition. Newer students who don't pay upfront tuition are now charged a percentage of their salary (17%) after they land a job. \n\"We don't care about age, race, gender, past professional experience or school experience,\" he said. \"We removed every kind of human bias from the selection process.\" \nInstead, candidates are evaluated by how they problem solve, collaborate with others and their eagerness to learn. There's also an in-person interview with the founders. \nThe school in down San Francisco is set up like a startup, with communal work stations meant to facilitate collaboration., About 40% of students are women and more than half are minorities. Students vary in age -- from 18 to 58 -- as well as experience. \n\"Some have no prior programming knowledge,\" said Kalache. \"We actually prefer it that way.\" \nThe school, which keeps its facilities open 24/7, features classrooms that resemble a startup environment to simulate real-life work scenarios. \nRelated: Baltimore is paying kids to code \nDora Korpar, a 25-year-old student who previously worked an entry-level job at Trader Joe's, said the program helped her land a lucrative programming job after graduation. \n\"It was an eye-opening experience,\" said Korpar, who didn't have prior coding knowledge. \nTraits, such as being a sharp problem solver and strong math and logical thinking skills, helped her get in to Holberton. Less than a year into the program, Korpar interviewed with a Silicon Valley tech firm and was hired. \nRelated: Shipping containers turned into mobile tech labs for schoolkids \nMeanwhile, two of her peers were hired by Apple ( AAPL , Tech30 ) after just nine months at the school. One was previously a cameraman with no programming experience, and the other was a help desk representative. \nAbout half of the first cohort of students now have full-time jobs or internships at top tech institutions, including at Dropbox, Docker and NASA. \nHolberton School co-founders Julien Barbier and Sylvain Kalache. The school also offers a rotating panel of pro-bono mentors -- like Jain -- from companies such as Apple, LinkedIn and Google ( GOOGL , Tech30 ) . \nKalache hopes to open more branches in San Francisco and eventually internationally. \n\"If the U.S. wants to remain competitive in tech, companies like LinkedIn ( LNKD , Tech30 ) , Google, Facebook ( FB , Tech30 ) have to be able to hire local talent quickly,\" he said. \"If they can't, they will go to India and China to grow their workforce.\" \nCNNMoney (New York) First published November 12, 2016: 9:32 AM ET",

Trading turkey for tech advice is a time-honored and always-awful ritual for anyone under the age of 30 who still has parents.

      "text": "Apple leaks reveal massive 2017 iPhone SE cancellation By Cristina Limpiada | Nov 11, 2016 07:36 PM EST facebook tweet Get   (Photo : Credit: Gonzalo Arroyo Moreno / Stringer) MADRID, SPAIN - SEPTEMBER, 16: An Iphone 7 is displayed at Puerta del Sol Apple Store the day the company launches their Iphone 7 and 7 Plus on September 16, 2016 in Madrid, Spain. The iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus has been launched on Friday September 16th in more than 25 countries. Customers have started to queue 38 hours before the opening of the store placed in the center of Madrid. Ming-Chi Kuo, the KGI Securities Analyst confirmed earlier that Apple has decided to cancel the annual upgrade of the most successful iPhone in 2016. As per Forbes , Kuo said that it was Apple who has decided to cancel the release of the 2017 update of the iPhone SE. This is merely a sad news to all economic buyers, as this iPhone SE is one of the cheapest yet reliable and affordable iPhones. Advertisement Additionally, there are twofold reasons why the cancellation is made possible. The first one is to increase margins on the 2016 iPhone SE as its older components reduced in price. And secondly, to reduce the risks of cannibalization that a 2017 iPhone SE could have on sales of the more profitable iPhone 7. Advertisement Meanwhile, according to GameNGuide , Kuo's decision to single out totally the iPhone SE upgrades is very reasonable due to its great impact on the sales of the iPhone 7, for customers always prefer to buy the Apple's budget-friendly models. Also, the total shipment of the volume of iPhone 7 will decline early on 2017 due to the small demand of this Apple variant in Asian countries. After all, the iPhone shipments will be more likely to drop at the edge of 10% in the second quarter of 2017 with the sales at circa 35M compared on the 2016 40.4M sales in the second quarter. That is why; Kuo noted that in order to save the 2017 sales for the second quarter, it is best to cancel the marketing of iPhone SE models. To recall, this iPhone SE was first introduced in the market back in March 2016. And this iPhone SE stands out due to its built-in and such powerful features that can last and drop jaws of the customers aside from its notable low price, making it more cost-effective. And now, no more iPhone SE anymore, for the entire marketing was canceled.",

      "text": "From GE to Apple, fresh pledges for diversity in Trump era By Richard Clough,Jeff Green and Laura Colby, Bloomberg Published: November 12, 2016 9:35 AM CDT Updated: November 12, 2016 11:05 AM CDT 0 shares facebook twitter email comments × \nChief executive officers at some of the largest U.S. companies, from General Electric to Apple, are reassuring employees they support workplace diversity as a salve to anxieties caused by the bruising presidential election. \nJeffrey Immelt affirmed GE's commitment to \"people of all races, genders and sexual orientations\" in an internal blog post Wednesday musing on the election. That echoed Apple CEO Tim Cook's message to workers that the tech giant welcomes everyone, \"regardless of what they look like, where they come from, how they worship or who they love.\" Oscar Munoz of United Continental Holdings said in a message to employees that they represent \"every creed and conviction, background and belief.\" \nDiversity issues have come to the fore as the presidential campaign exposed and deepened bitter divisions on matters such as the treatment of women and minorities; the rights of lesbian, gay, bi-sexual and transgender workers; and gender disparities on the job. Following Donald Trump's surprise victory over Hillary Clinton this week, companies now are grappling with how to ease tensions and move forward. \nThousands of people in cities including Boston, Chicago, Seattle and New York have marched, shut down highways and burned effigies of Trump to protest the electoral shift to the right. \n'Areas of Angst' \nStarting about midnight on Tuesday, Karyn Twaronite, global diversity and inclusiveness officer at consulting and accounting firm EY, said she received hundreds of emails from employees \"raising concerns, thoughts and observations\" as well as \"areas of angst.\" \n\"I'm actually hopeful, because there's so much dialog. We've been able to have conversations about subjects people never talked about before, like racism and sexism,\" Twaronite said, adding that about two-thirds of EY's employees are millennials. \nThere's still cause for concern. Advocates of diversity see major changes in workplace regulations if Trump follows through with his pledge to rescind Barack Obama's executive orders, which could include the ones in the table below. And it's still legal in 28 states to fire workers because they are gay. DATEEXECUTIVE ORDERJuly 21, 2014Amendments to Equal Employment Opportunity Executive Orders 11478 substituting \"sexual orientation, gender identity\" for \"sexual orientation\" and to 11246, substituting \"sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, or national origin\" for \"sex, or national origin\"Aug. 18, 2011Establishing a coordinated government-wide initiative to promote diversity and inclusion in the federal workforceMar. 11, 2009Creating the White House Council on Women and Girls: Includes assisting women-owned businesses to compete internationally and working to increase participation of women in the science, engineering and technology workforce\nTrump will appoint his own attorney general and can name a new general counsel and chairman for the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, as well as change the leadership of the Department of Labor and National Labor Relations Board. The NLRB exerts broad influence over workplace issues, and the Department of Justice wrote key guidelines this year requiring the government to treat sexual orientation and gender identity as protected under the Civil Rights Act. \nDuring Obama's two terms, the Justice Department and EEOC have taken the lead on discrimination cases involving religion, gender identity, sexual orientation and race -- including high-profile diversity lawsuits against McDonald's Corp., Abercrombie & Fitch Co. and AutoZone Inc. \nAggressive Enforcement \n\"The biggest effect will be in the agencies -- the NLRB, DOL and EEOC -- that have all been very aggressive in enforcing the laws,\" said Cliff Palefsky, a civil-rights lawyer at McGuinn Hillsman & Palefsky in San Francisco. \"I suspect we're going to go back eight years, to when those agencies actually worked to undermine the laws. That's unfortunate.\" \nMatt Maloney, head of food-delivery company GrubHub Inc., generated controversy after the election with an email to employees decrying \"the nationalist, anti-immigrant and hateful politics of Donald Trump\" and said workers who don't support a culture of inclusiveness should \"reply to this email with your resignation because you have no place here.\" In a statement posted Thursday on the company's website, he clarified that GrubHub welcomes people of all political affiliations and the initial message was not meant as an attack on Trump voters. \nMove Past Rancor \nMany CEOs sidestepped specific comments on Trump and instead asked workers to try to move past the partisan rancor of the campaign. Starbucks Corp.'s Howard Schultz, who endorsed Clinton, told employees in a letter that \"we have a choice in how we treat one another,\" regardless of which candidate they supported. \nCompanies increasingly recognize the need for employees to reflect their customers, and recruiting more women, minorities and people of different sexual orientations can help them stay competitive and innovative. \n\"It's a business imperative,\" said George Nichols, senior vice president of government affairs at New York Life Insurance Co. \"Businesses that don't invest in diversity efforts will increasingly be at a competitive disadvantage, regardless of the political landscape.\" \nThe company held a town-hall meeting Thursday at which CEO Ted Mathas reiterated its commitment to a diverse workforce, Nichols said. \nTimothy Ryan, U.S. chairman at PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, encouraged employees to talk about their feelings the day after the election. \"We're doubling down\" on diversity, he said in an interview. Some 44 percent of the new partners PwC named this year were women or minorities, while 47 percent of its workforce is female and 33 percent are minorities, he added. \nMore Innovation \n\"We and other companies understand the importance of diversity and inclusiveness to get more innovation, better answers to problems and to reach more customers -- and that's not going to change,\" he said. \nTrump's candidacy inflamed racial tensions as he demonized Mexicans as rapists and Muslims as terrorists while also expressing support for police practices such as \"stop and frisk,\" which some consider a form of racial profiling disproportionately targeting blacks and Hispanics. Trump also was criticized on gender grounds, particularly following the release of a recording in which he makes vulgar comments about groping women. \nCorporate boards have been unforgiving with some top officials who engaged in arguably less crude behavior that could paint the company in a bad light or put it at legal risk. \nRead more: Sex, the C-Suite and Trump \nWhile the tone from the campaign was \"disturbing,\" it may not stop the progress toward a more diverse workforce, said Natasha Lamb, director for equity research and shareholder engagement at Boston-based Arjuna Capital, who filed nine diversity-related shareholder resolutions at technology companies this year. \n\"Investors are part of a greater groundswell that is emboldening corporations to plot a more diverse and successful future,\" she said. Following the election, \"our work on gender equity is more important now than ever.\" \n(Updates with GrubHub comment in 11th paragraph.) \n--With assistance from Carol Hymowitz To contact the reporters on this story: Richard Clough in New York at rclough9@bloomberg.net, Jeff Green in Southfield, Michigan at jgreen16@bloomberg.net, Laura Colby in New York at lcolby@bloomberg.net.

In addition, the fund increased its stake in Alphabet Inc by 37.5 percent to 550,000 class A capital stock shares, the filings said. \nThird Point also took a 2.6 million sponsored ADS stake in Alibaba Group Holding Ltd, according to the regulatory filings. \n(Reporting By Jennifer Ablan; Editing by Sandra Maler) © Thomson Reuters 2016 All rights reserved.

      "text": "This school helps inexperienced programmers land jobs at Apple By Parija Kavilanz, CNN | Posted Nov 12th, 2016 @ 3:27pm 0  \nNEW YORK (CNNMoney) — Programmers are in hot demand. Tech companies are especially eager to grab talent as fast as they can find it. \n\"We're interviewing people every week,\" said Neha Jain, a senior software engineer with LinkedIn. \"Every time we get a great idea at LinkedIn, the question is always -- who will work on that project?\" \nBut there's a problem: Businesses want to bring on more engineers but the pipeline isn't always market ready. Many young software graduates don't get hired because they don't have on-the-job experience. \nTo help streamline the process of finding stronger candidates, Jain serves as a mentor at the Holberton School, based in San Francisco. \nIt's a a new two-year college-alternative course for programmers that shuns teacher-led instruction and students for the workplace in half the time of a formal college. \nCo-founded in 2016 by Sylvain Kalache -- also software engineer and a former colleague of Jain's -- the school offers training you'd typically at a workplace. \n\"Software engineering is a craft,\" Kalache said. \"You're better at it the more you practice. At a four-year college, you're passively listening to teachers and improving your mind but maybe not your application skills.\" \nTech knowledge can also become obsolete by graduation. \n\"Technology moves so fast,\" he said. \"What you learned in your freshman and sophomore year is redundant two years later.\" \nWith no formal instruction, the school's objective is to teach students how to learn both on their own and from peers, similar to what occurs at an office. \nThe course is split into three parts: Nine months of training on software engineering fundamentals, a six month internship and nine more months focused on specialization. \nThe school launched with a small cohort of 30 students and offered free tuition. Newer students who don't pay upfront tuition are now charged a percentage of their salary (17%) after they land a job. \n\"We don't care about age, race, gender, past professional experience or school experience,\" he said. \"We removed every kind of human bias from the selection process.\" \nInstead, candidates are evaluated by how they problem solve, collaborate with others and their eagerness to learn. There's also an in-person interview with the founders. \nAbout 40% of students are women and more than half are minorities. Students vary in age -- from 18 to 58 -- as well as experience. \n\"Some have no prior programming knowledge,\" said Kalache. \"We actually prefer it that way.\" \nThe school, which keeps its facilities open 24/7, features classrooms that resemble a startup environment to simulate real-life work scenarios. \nDora Korpar, a 25-year-old student who previously worked an entry-level job at Trader Joe's, said the program helped her land a lucrative programming job after graduation. \n\"It was an eye-opening experience,\" said Korpar, who didn't have prior coding knowledge. \nTraits, such as being a sharp problem solver and strong math and logical thinking skills, helped her get in to Holberton. Less than a year into the program, Korpar interviewed with a Silicon Valley tech firm and was hired. \nMeanwhile, two of her peers were hired by Apple after just nine months at the school. One was previously a cameraman with no programming experience, and the other was a help desk representative. \nAbout half of the first cohort of students now have full-time jobs or internships at top tech institutions, including at Dropbox, Docker and NASA. \nThe school also offers a rotating panel of pro-bono mentors -- like Jain -- from companies such as Apple, LinkedIn and Google. \nKalache hopes to open more branches in San Francisco and eventually internationally. \n\"If the U.S. wants to remain competitive in tech, companies like LinkedIn, Google, Facebook have to be able to hire local talent quickly,\" he said. \"If they can't, they will go to India and China to grow their workforce.\" \nCopyright 2016 Cable News Network.

      "text": "Apple is About to Fall Far from the Tree ... Again By 0 \nWhile most investors, and members of the great herd of humanity, are betting that this is the buying opportunity in Apple (AAPL) shares, odds are high and rising that they're seeing the tree without a view of the forest itself. Using our decision support engine (DSE), let's explore what some objective indicators are telling us. \nAs readers of these pages likely remember, the DSE has been ahead of trend changes in AAPL, and many other shares, for the past year, highlighting the great exits that the $120s continue to be for those with long exposure to this name. As recently as May, we were able to point out the short-term buying opportunity as AAPL tested the high $80s, forecasting a return to $115 (plus or minus $10). The October peak reached $118, and has reversed sharply, suggesting that the entire bounce is over, and the larger forecast is back in force....294 more words left in this article.

      "text": "\"Hey, while you're here, would you just mind checking my iPhone? It's been doing this 'updating' thing recently. Oh, and my emails keep on not sending, could you take a look at that? And this wireless printer never does what I want it to.\"\nYes, it's that time of the year again. Trading turkey for tech advice is a time-honored and always-awful ritual for anyone under the age of 30 who still has parents. This year, Apple has seen the oncoming tide of woe, realized it needs to curry favor with young people to keep iPhones hip, and has launched an app to help.\nDON'T MISS: The best feature of AT&T’s new $35 TV subscription might be illegal\nThe app gives you information about how to use your Apple products (assuming you can install the app in the first place!), schedule appointments at the Apple Store, or live-chat with a support rep. For most situations, and with a little training, it can replace your phone number in your grandparents' book for tech support.\nEven better, it knows what devices you have registered with your Apple account. Rather than having to explain the difference between A1701 and A1702 to someone, you can just ask them to log into the Support app and see documentation.\nThe app is available in most app stores apart from the US store, strangely. Hopefully, it should be rolling out state-side in the next few days, just in time for you to visit home.\nTrending right now:\nThis tiny Wi-Fi router is probably better than yours, and it’s less than $11 9 new movie trailers you need to watch from this past week 11 paid iPhone apps on sale for free for a limited time See the original version of this article on BGR.com",

      "text": "(Before It's News)\nApple is hoping its “two-step” password security will ensure the safety of credit card details for around 500 million accounts. 7:25am UK, Saturday 23 March 2013\nApple has boosted security on iCloud and iTunes accounts with a new password system designed to stop hackers.\nThe technology giant has followed Google’s example with a system that sends a code to a user’s mobile phone whenever they sign in from a new computer or make a purchase.\nThe “two-step” authentication should stop hackers accessing private information even if they have the password.\nThe move comes amid the high-profile hacking of government agencies and major companies.\nThe popularity of Apple’s iTunes and Amazon, as well as storage services like iCloud, Dropbox and Google Drive are an incentive for companies to provide more advanced protection for personal and financial data.\nApple, along with Facebook, Twitter and Microsoft, was hit by a security breach in January after hackers exploited a weakness in Oracle’s Java web-browsing software.\nThe iPad maker holds credit card details for some 500 million iTunes and App Store customers, making it a rich target for hackers who are becoming ever more proficient at using information from social networks to phish for passwords.\nApple users can update their profile to the new two-step system on the Password and Security section of Apple’s website.\nThe company said: “Apple takes customer privacy very seriously. Two-step verification is an even more robust process to ensure our users’ data remain protected.”\nServices that already use the two-step system include Facebook, Google, PayPal and Microsoft’s Xbox Live.\nApple’s move may put pressure on Amazon to introduce similar technology.\nSome 24 million customers with Zappos, an Amazon-owned shoe company, had their details compromised by a hack in 2012.\nhttp://news.sky.com/story/1068549/apple-boosts-icloud-and-itunes-security",

      "text": "(Before It's News)\nSciTechPress.org (Subscribe via Email)\n(CNN) — It’s called “Apple picking,” a growing wave of crime in which thieves target mobile devices, particularly iPhones and iPads.\nNow the company that gave the crime its name is taking a step to stop it, with a “kill switch”-style update aimed at making the mobile gadgets less valuable to thieves.\nActivation Lock will be part of iOS 7, the latest version of Apple’s mobile operating system expected to roll out in the fall. The feature will require an Apple ID and password before the phone’s “Find My iPhone” feature can be turned off or any data can be erased.\nAt a keynote address opening its annual Worldwide Developers Conference , the company said the same ID and password will be needed to reactivate a device after it’s been remotely erased.\n“We think this is going to be a really powerful theft deterrent,” said Craig Federighi, a senior vice president at Apple.\nAs mobile devices become more popular, stealing them has become a unique sort of crime that has law enforcement and government officials taking notice.\nIn New York, a special police unit has been created to deal with stolen mobile devices.\nThe overall crime rate in the city increased 3% last year — but “if you subtracted just the increase in Apple product thefts, we would have had an overall decrease in crime in New York,” Deputy Police Commissioner Paul Browne said.\nAdvocates have been calling for so-called kill switch tools in all mobile devices for some time.\nApple’s announcement came the same week that George Gascon, the district attorney in tech hub San Francisco, plans to meet with the New York state attorney general and representatives of cell phone companies to discuss ways of discouraging mobile-device robberies.\nIn a letter last year to the Federal Communications Commission chairman, the wireless industry’s trade association released details of a voluntary effort to “help law enforcement deter smartphone theft.”\nA major plank of that effort is the creation of a database for smartphones reported stolen. Phones on the database, which is scheduled to be up and running at the end of November, could not be activated and would not work on an LTE network in the United States.\nhttp://www.cnn.com/2013/06/11/tech/mobile/iphone-ios7-kill-switch/index.html",
