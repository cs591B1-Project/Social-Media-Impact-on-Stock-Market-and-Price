Photograph: Dan Powers/AP Monday 14 November 2016 23.19 GMT Last modified on Monday 14 November 2016 23.25 GMT Share on Messenger \nThree months after overturning his conviction, a Wisconsin judge on Monday ordered that Brendan Dassey, one of the subjects in Netflix’s documentary series Making a Murderer , be released from prison, under supervision. \nThe order by US magistrate Judge William Duffin was immediately challenged by Wisconsin’s attorney general, Brad Schimel, whose office announced it would file an emergency motion to stay the decision . \nDuffin cast doubt in his ruling on the state’s chances of success in appealing against his earlier decision to overturn Dassey’s conviction and said there was “no indication” that Dassey “has the inclination much less the means to flee”. \n“Dassey has offered a detailed release plan that was prepared with the assistance of a clinical social worker with experience in similar cases,” the judge wrote. “That social worker would remain involved in assisting Dassey as he adjusts to freedom following his decade in prison.” \nDassey, 27, has been incarcerated since 2007 over the murder of Teresa Halbach, a local photographer. Dassey and his uncle, Steven Avery, were found guilty in Halbach’s 2005 death in separate trials. \nIn his August decision to overturn Dassey’s conviction, Duffin called the conduct of the then teenager’s attorney “indefensible”. The attorney, Len Kachinsky, initially represented Dassey before being removed from the case before trial. In his first three weeks representing Dassey, Duffin wrote, Kachinsky spent 10 hours speaking to reporters and only one hour with the teen. Controversial Making a Murderer lawyer: 'I don't get Netflix at home' Read more \nThe judge also took aim at investigators who, he said, elicited an “involuntary” confession from Dassey, who was 16 at the time of Halbach’s murder. Dassey’s attorney told the Guardian last year that his remarks to police “fit the profile of a [false] confession to an absolute T”. The officers, for example, suggested he would receive leniency for complying and fed facts “to get Brendan to say how Ms Halbach died”, said the attorney, Laura Nirider. \nDuffin agreed. \n“These repeated false promises, when considered in conjunction with all relevant factors, most especially Dassey’s age, intellectual deficits, and the absence of a supportive adult, rendered Dassey’s confession involuntary under the fifth and 14th amendments,” Duffin wrote in his 91-page ruling. \nThe story drew notoriety for Avery’s connection. Before his arrest over Halbach’s murder, he was seen as the face of a US judicial system that can unfairly convict someone: for 18 years, Avery was jailed for a rape he didn’t commit. Eventually, he was exonerated through DNA evidence. \nIn the order issued on Monday, Duffin outlined numerous conditions to be imposed on Dassey upon his release and pending the effort by Wisconsin’s attorney general to appeal against the judge’s decision to overturn his conviction. Avery’s appeal remains pending. \nDassey will be supervised by the US probation office in Wisconsin , Duffin ruled, saying it has “experts in addressing issues that Dassey is likely to face upon being released after more than a decade in prison”. \nDuffin also said that Dassey cannot contact Avery or any family members of Halbach. If Dassey violates any terms of the order, the judge said, he may be returned to custody pending the outcome of the prosecution’s appeal.",

      "text": "Comment The Crown is set to debut on Netflix this November 4th in the US as well as in the UK. Netflix \nAfter The Crown's Season 1 success, the much awaited sequel has been confirmed by Netflix. However, to fans' dismay, they would have to wait for its launch by late 2017. Although no air date has been confirmed just yet, Netflix has hinted that it will be launched between fall and winter of 2017. As others speculate, it most probably will be in November. \nAlthough Season 2 will also have Claire Foy playing Queen Elizabeth, and Matt Smith as Prince Philip, Season 3 will have them replaced by a new cast . This is a shock for many fans who found both Foy and Smith fitted perfectly for their roles. \nSeason 2 is set to show 60 episodes that will showcase Queen Elizabeth's royal journey beyond 1956, which includes important points in history such as after Winston Churchill's waging war against the Axis forces. This was a period when the Queen's presence became even more influential. \nAs can be remembered, Season 1 ended with Elizabeth, then 25 years old, being crowned as the Queen of England. \nThe Crown was launched on Netflix on November 4, 2016. The series was created by Director Stephen Daldry and Screenwriter Peter Morgan. It was also produced with Left Bank Pictures in cooperation with Sony Pictures Television. \nThe series is based on a play entitled \"The Audience,\" penned by Peter Morgan. Morgan was said to be inspired by Queen Elizabeth's regular meetings with the Prime Minister which happened every week, without fail, for 60 years. The story also covered Elizabeth and her family's historical highlights from 1947 to 1956. \nThe Crown Season 1 gained raving reviews despite it being quite short at 10 episodes with one hour each. With an already powerful screenplay, the series also had a big production budget behind it estimated to be at $125 million . As of date, it is the most expensive TV series budget in history. \nMany fans commend Foy's maturity in the role, saying that she was able to deliver Elizabeth's transition from a nervous and coy teenager, to someone with sophistication and the strength to ascend the throne. Foy's role as Queen Elizabeth shows her diversity as an actress, given that she previously played as Anne Boleyn in the series Wolf Hall . Foy's performance has also been compared with Helen Mirren, who once played the role of Queen Elizabeth and won an Oscar for it. \nOther cast members are also commended, especially Jared Harris who critics say fared way better than Colin Firth on his The King's Speech George VI role. Harris did a defining performance when he provided a backdrop of ironies against Prince Phillip's serious role. \nSmith, playing as Prince Philip, surprised the audience with his often coy yet authoritative depiction of the Prince. Smith also had the works of a prince-turned-king, with his looks, build, and gentlemanly disposition. \nOne of the highlights of The Crown Season 1 is on its depiction of Elizabeth and Philip's royal wedding. While originally the wedding took place at Westminster Abbey, the series had it staged at Ely Cathedral. ",

      "text": "Republish our articles for free, online or in print, under Creative Commons licence. Netflix \nThe Crown, Netflix’s most ambitious and expensive original drama, had a reported budget of over US$100 million . The ten-part series charts the ascension of Elizabeth Windsor to the throne as Queen Elizabeth II, and follows the young monarch as she settles into her role as ruling monarch and bearer of the crown. This is a role that sets up a fundamental push and pull between the private and the public roles of a woman, a mother, a wife and a queen. \nSuch an enormous budget and high-profile subject ensured that the series was met with significant fanfare. Most reviews have hailed the lavish production as a milestone for TV mega-series, but a number focused instead on The Crown as “ history ”. \nThis misses the point. The Crown might be based on historic events and on real people, but this is costume drama at its most lavish and meticulously researched, not history. The British royal family are famously restrictive as regards open access both to the monarch and her family. This reticence extends in particular to laying open the complex emotional relationships between members of the royal family, the court and their interaction with agencies such as the British government. Claire Foy as Elizabeth and Matt Smith as Philip. Netflix \nThe Crown, with its gentle, and carefully paced storytelling, draws much of its narrative impact from focusing on the relationships between the series’ protagonists, especially Claire Foy’s Queen Elizabeth and Matt Smith’s Prince Philip. Needless to say, much of this relationship is fictionalised and visualises intensely private moments between the couple, such as Philip breaking the news of her father’s death to Elizabeth while on safari in Kenya. Historical sources all report on this sequence of events, but where the sources give no account of emotions and reactions and interactions, in The Crown, the viewer can witness Elizabeth’s sorrow and grief for her father, and the dawning realisation that this signals the end of any semblance of a private life she may have had as she steps into the footsteps of the King. \nOne of the most compelling themes threading through the ten instalments of the series is this persistent tension between the public and private persona of the monarch. Queen Elizabeth II, in common with her female royal predecessors, Victoria (herself the subject of a recent TV serialisation ) and Elizabeth I, remains defined by her gender and the seeming impossibility of a woman being able to rule “like a man”. Kingship, rulership, and leadership remain defined as fundamentally male characteristics and prerogatives, and in conflict with social expectations of women as wives and mothers. The weighty crown. Netflix \nQueen Elizabeth I, “the Virgin Queen”, refused marriage to a range of possible suitors. This arguably allowed her a very distinctive approach to self-fashioning. In images such as the Armada Portrait , Queen Elizabeth I is depicted centrally, dominating the image, drawing the eye of the beholder to her person as the instigator of the events unfolding around her. \nShe is flanked by images retelling the events of the failed Spanish Invasion of 1588, the crowning military achievement of her reign, while resting her hand on a globe and pointing to the new dominions of America she is colonising. She is every inch the thrusting, militarily aggressive leader, she is the self-contained Virgin Queen, the powerful monarch of masculine energy and force, the body politic contained in a female but androgynous body. \nBut no such image suits a monarch at the cusp of their reign and of significant social change. Tudor England and Great Britain in the 1950s are very different places: one celebrating the ascendancy of a new Imperial power, the other the harsh reality of the busted flush of imperial power. The Crown plays on these notions of transformation and the creation of the public image of a new kind of monarch. \nThe struggle sensitively and powerfully depicted by a superb Foy is the search for the identity of a female monarch for whom the “crown” necessarily becomes the “firm” – an role in which duty and public performance sit uneasily next to the more intimate, private life of a happily married wife and mother. Much of the appeal of The Crown for viewers (especially female viewers?) comes from the ability to recognise these struggles about identity, familiar in their own working lives, in the young woman they are watching on the screen. Foy here succeeds in injecting warmth and humanity into the very need for aloofness and performance of the monarch. Family life. Netflix \nSome of the most powerful exchanges centre on Foy and Smith at moments where their public and private worlds collide, for example at moments of intense grief and immense elation. The reticence and restraint expected of both in the performance of their official role conflicts with a more natural expression of these feelings. The series here often plays with settings and costume, with the action shifting from formal set pieces such as the coronation sequence in Westminster Abbey to the wild moors of Scotland. Space, either restricted, or wide open and seemingly without constraints, often sets the narrative tone. \nThe budget is lavish, the locations are to die for, the wardrobe and settings are meticulously researched and the cast are stellar and uniformly superb – The Crown is as good a period drama as it gets. Hilary Mantel, the grand doyenne of historical fiction, defined one of the requirements of historical fiction as “conjecture [that is] plausible and grounded in the best facts one can get”. This is where The Crown excels. It certainly isn’t history, but historical fiction of the finest and most entertaining.",

      "text": "Twitter \nAccording to ScreenRant.com , Disney is considering purchasing Netflix. Netflix was originally a DVD mailing service, but has shifted in recent years to become focused on streaming their content straight to viewers. Lately, Netflix has been producing a lot of original TV shows and movies, feeding right into their mission statement of making over half their content original. \nDisney already owns companies like Pixar, Marvel, and Lucasfilm, but owning Netflix would give them an even easier way to distribute their own content. ScreenRant comments that purchasing Netflix would allow Disney to tap into an already proven content algorithm for assessing how audiences watch content. \nNetflix already has a large number of subscribers on their own, but joining up with Disney would only help in competition with other sites like Amazon Prime. \nThese are all just rumors for now, but their strength has been increasing since AT&T purchased Time Warner last month.",

      "text": "Jeff Spry  21am \nIs Disney about to open Mickey's bank account and buy up Netflix? Stranger things have happened! According to a new report from TechCrunch, the recent $85 billion merger of AT&T and Time Warner has instigated Disney brass to seek out a possible counterstrike to bolster their online entertainment battleship and the popular streaming service seems to be directly in their crosshairs. The Disney empire is home to such sterling brands as Disney Studios, the ABC Network, ESPN Network, Disney Animation Studios, Lucasfilm, Marvel and Pixar. Speculation in the potential acquisition rumors include the fact that Disney CEO Bob Iger is set to retire in two years, opening the door for Netflix CEO and billionaire mastermind, Reed Hastings to assume the throne. \nThis would give Disney an instant foothold in the streaming service's home entertainment delivery service as well as its digital roster of heavy-hitting original content programs like Daredevil, Jessica Jones, Luke Cage, Black Mirror, Stranger Things , and the previously-partnered upcoming Defenders and Iron Fist comic-book series. \nIt seems a smart strategic move with unlimited upside and a sweet fit for the House of Mouse in an age of diminishing returns from its ESPN arm and increased competition striking from all directions. Disney just crushed Wall Street's quarterly earnings expectations with another record year, but in Hollywood it's all about 'what have you done for me lately.' And with Hastings' bold plan to grow Netflix's original content by 50%, Disney and its deep pockets could be its perfect soul mate. \nWhether this will all turn out to be a clever round of corporate gamemanship to settle the ravenous shareholder demands or a certified steal, only time will tell. What do you think of a possible marriage between Disney and Netflix and do you think it might infringe upon some antitrust laws put in place by wiser men to prevent monopolies? Will Netflix keep Disney The Happiest Place on Earth or just the wealthiest?",

      "text": "By Megan Vick, Brendan Dassey, one of the subjects of Netflix's controversial documentary series Making a Murderer , may finally be getting his release.\nDassey's conviction was overturned in August of this year and the state of Wisconsin had 90 days to release him. Now the same judge who overturned the conviction has officially ordered for Dassey's release -- but the state of Wisconsin can potentially still hold up the process with an appeal, according to Milwaukee Journal Sentinel .\nAttorney for Making a Murderer 's Steven Avery Has New Suspects\nDassey, now 27, has been in prison since 2007 for the murder of photographer Teresa Halbach. He and his uncle Steven Avery were the center of the Netflix series about the trial. Though Dassey was convicted on three counts for the crime -- first-degree intentional homicide, second-degree sexual assault and mutilation of a corpse -- Making a Murderer speculated that his confession to helping Avery with the murder was coerced by the Manitowoc County police. His release will be under supervision and pending further court developments. Avery is still serving a life sentence for the crime.\nThis is a big break in the case and Netflix has already promised that more episodes of Making a Murderer are being produced to document the updates in both Dassey's and Avery's appeal.\nOther Links From TVGuide.com\nMaking a Murderer\nView the original article on TVGuide.com",

      "text": "Lauren Graham and Alexis Bledel (Credit: Netflix) More Where the Gilmore Girls lead, we will follow! It’s been nine long years since super mother-daughter duo Lorelai and Rory Gilmore drank all the coffee in Stars Hollow, gorged on junk food and Chinese takeout, fell in and out of love, and dropped every pop culture reference imaginable in their rapid-fire banter. Now the Gilmores are back to drink even more coffee, talk even faster, and charm us more than ever in Netflix’s continuation of the series, which premieres Nov. 25. In four 90-minute episodes, titled “Winter,” “Spring,” “Summer,” and “Fall,” Lorelai (Lauren Graham), Rory (Alexis Bledel), and grandmother Emily (Kelly Bishop) all face big changes in their lives. To get ready for the revival, we’re highlighting all the things we love about the show with our official Return to Stars Hollow coverage, from the wacky supporting characters to the insanely clever dialogue to the girls’ complicated love lives. Check back here every day until Nov. 25 to obsess with us over all things Gilmore. – – – – – – – – Brew up a big batch (or few) of coffee and pull out the doughnuts, candy, pizza, and Chinese food! The Gilmore Girls are back! The beloved dramedy returns nine years after its broadcast series finale for a six-hour revival on Netflix. And that means more rapid-fire banter, more winking pop cultural references, more zany small-town antics, more romance, more laughter, more tears, and of course … lots more coffee. Here’s everything you need to know about Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life : When, Where, and How Do I Watch? All four 90-minute episodes (or as creator Amy Sherman-Palladino prefers to call them, minimovies) will be available to stream on Netflix in the U.S. at 12:01 a.m. Pacific Time on Friday, Nov. 25, aka the day after Thanksgiving. The four episodes are titled “Winter,” “Spring,” “Summer,” and “Fall” (a nod to the show’s theme song “Where You Lead” by Carole King). Who’s Back for the Revival? Alexis Bledel, Scott Patterson, Kelly Bishop, and Lauren Graham (Credit: Netflix) More Original series stars Lauren Graham (Lorelai), Alexis Bledel (Rory), Kelly Bishop (Emily), Scott Patterson (Luke), Keiko Agena (Lane), Liza Weil (Paris), David Sutcliffe (Christopher), and Melissa McCarthy (Sookie) all reprise their roles. All three of Rory’s boyfriends are also back: Jared Padalecki as Dean, Milo Ventimiglia as Jess, and Matt Czuchry as Logan. Milo Ventimiglia and Scott Patterson (Credit: Netflix) More And Stars Hollow will be bursting with the usual lovable townspeople, including: Sean Gunn (Kirk), Yanic Truesdale (Michel), Todd Lowe (Zach), Jackson Douglas (Jackson), Sally Struthers (Babette), Liz Torres (Miss Patty), Michael Winters (Taylor), Emily Kuroda (Mrs. Kim), Sebastian Bach (Gil), Rose Abdoo (Gypsy), Mike Gandolfi (Andrew), Rini Bell (Lulu), Grant-Lee Phillips (Troubadour), and Carole King (Sophie). Other familiar faces include Danny Strong (Doyle), Gregg Henry (Mitchum Huntzberger), Tanc Sade (Finn), Alan Loayza (Colin), Vanessa Marano (April), Dakin Matthews (Headmaster Charleston), Chris Eigeman (Jason aka Digger), and Paul Anka the dog. Who’s NOT Coming Back? Make of it what you will, but these cast members will not be returning: Scott Cohen (Max Medina), Kathleen Wilhoite (Liz), Wayne Wilcox (Marty), Devon Sorvari (Honor Huntzberger), and Nicolette Collier (Gigi). And of course, sadly, the great Edward Herrmann passed away in 2014 and will not be reprising his role as Gilmore patriarch Richard. But he will make an impact on the revival. Read More Related: 26 of the Greatest ‘Gilmore Girls’ Guests Who’s New? The revival features small roles or cameos by Sutton Foster (she starred in Sherman-Palladino’s series Bunheads ), Mae Whitman (who played Graham’s daughter in Parenthood ), Christian Borle ( Smash ), Stacey Oristano ( Friday Night Lights ), and Dan Bucatinsky ( Scandal ). What’s It All About? The first episode, “Winter,” picks up four months after Richard’s death, though it will feature a memorial for him. At that point, all three Gilmore girls — Lorelai, Rory, and Emily — will face major life changes. Kelly Bishop, Lauren Graham, and Alexis Bledel (Credit: Netflix) More As seen in the trailer , Rory is a journalist, but struggling with her career and living a bit aimlessly. Lorelai is still running the Dragonfly Inn and in a relationship with Luke but seems to be at a crossroads. And Emily is trying to figure out what her life looks like now that Richard is gone. What’s Lorelai’s Deal? As previously mentioned, Lorelai is with Luke, but they aren’t married — yet. Rumors are flying that the revival features a wedding, but even if true, it might not be for L&L. The trailer hints that Lorelai undergoes a midlife crisis. We might start to see a whole new Lorelai. In the trailer, she’s seen hiking (what?!) and talking to a therapist (whoa!). “ I thought I knew exactly what I wanted, and where I was going, but lately, I don’t know, things seem hazier,” she muses. Uh-oh, does that spell trouble for her relationship with Luke? Scott Patterson and Lauren Graham (Credit: Netflix) More But one relationship that might improve is the bond with her mother, Emily. As Graham told TV Line, “ The healing that happens between Lorelai and Emily is such a long time coming. And because Richard’s absence is such a big part of our story, it really meant a lot to me to grow their relationship a little bit.” What’s the Deal With Rory? And Who Does She End Up With? Rory is reportedly single and dating, but the inclusion of all three of her exes is eyebrow-raising. She is clearly on friendly terms with Jess in the trailer, but her relationships with Dean and Logan are unknown. It is interesting that quite a few characters tied to Logan — the Life & Death Brigade crowd and his father — will make appearances. But Rory’s journey in A Year in the Life isn’t all about romance. Sherman-Palladino insisted to Time , “ It’s a small part of who Rory is. Rory didn’t spend her days thinking, ‘Who am I going to end up with?’ Rory was much more concerned about ‘How do I get that interview at the New York Times?’” Alexis Bledel (Credit: Netflix) More Rory is living a nomadic life as she deals with upheaval in the journalism business. She moves back home from New York for a while, joking in a clip shown at EW’s Popfest, “ Lena Dunham’s just going to have to get along without me.” What’s Emily’s Deal? Richard’s death is a huge turning point for Emily, as she puts together the pieces of her life without him. “ She has different adventures, some of them are funny, some of them are sad,” Bishop told People . “She’s just kind of plodding along trying to find herself, how she does it now, what it means.” Alexis Bledel and Kelly Bishop (Credit: Netflix) More Apparently, as seen in the trailer, it means commissioning an oversized portrait of Richard, cleaning house, and wearing jeans — jeans! What’s Happening in Stars Hollow? The town is putting on “Stars Hollow: The Musical,” and guest stars Foster and Borle (both Tony winners) will take part in that. Liz Torres, Sally Struthers, Alexis Bledel, and Lauren Graham (Credit: Netflix) More There are reportedly two town meetings (one of which is glimpsed in the trailer), and an international food fair (a photo shows Lane and Rory manning a Korean food stall). Emily Kuroda, Keiko Agena, and Alexis Bledel (Credit: Netflix) More What Are Those Four Words? Ah, the infamous last four words. Back in 2006, Sherman-Palladino revealed she had long planned the end of Gilmore Girls and that it involved four words. Then, due to contractual issues, she was ousted as showrunner for the seventh and final season. And fans didn’t get the four words. Now, the revival will put a bow on that outstanding issue. “Fall” will end with those four words. All anyone knows for sure about them is that they are spoken by Lorelai and Rory. Sherman-Palladino has pleaded with fans not to skip ahead to the ending to hear the words, nor spoil them for anyone else online. Alexis Bledel and Lauren Graham (Credit: Netflix) More “ I do think that it’s going to mean a lot more if you’ve taken the journey, and it’s going to mean a lot less if you just flip to the last page,” Sherman-Palladino told journalists last summer. “That being said, what can I do? I would hope that people would want to take the whole trip. It’s a fun trip. It’s worth it. There’s peanuts.” Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life premieres Nov. 25 on Netflix.",

      "text": "By Megan Vick, Brendan Dassey, one of the subjects of Netflix's controversial documentary series Making a Murderer , may finally be getting his release.\nDassey's conviction was overturned in August of this year and the state of Wisconsin had 90 days to release him. Now the same judge who overturned the conviction has officially ordered for Dassey's release -- but the state of Wisconsin can potentially still hold up the process with an appeal, according to Milwaukee Journal Sentinel .\nAttorney for Making a Murderer 's Steven Avery Has New Suspects\nDassey, now 27, has been in prison since 2007 for the murder of photographer Teresa Halbach. He and his uncle Steven Avery were the center of the Netflix series about the trial. Though Dassey was convicted on three counts for the crime -- first-degree intentional homicide, second-degree sexual assault and mutilation of a corpse -- Making a Murderer speculated that his confession to helping Avery with the murder was coerced by the Manitowoc County police. His release will be under supervision and pending further court developments. Avery is still serving a life sentence for the crime.\nThis is a big break in the case and Netflix has already promised that more episodes of Making a Murderer are being produced to document the updates in both Dassey's and Avery's appeal.\nOther Links From TVGuide.com\nMaking a Murderer\nView the original article on TVGuide.com",

      "title": "Is Disney going to try to buy Netflix in the world's biggest entertainment merger?",
      "text": "Amid rumours that Netflix is struggling to compete with newer multi revenue-streamed business models on the market such as Amazon Prime and Hulu, is a Disney/Netflix merger possible? The idea is hypothesised on TechCrunch following the announcement that AT&amp;T has made an $85 billion acquisition of telecom company, Time Warner, ready to repackage all Time Warner content (including Warner Bros. and HBO) and make it available on its soon-to-launch $35 per month DirecTV Now service. Should the deal be completed, what this effectively means is that DirecTV Now service that will showcase live, premium channels that Netflix can't offer its subscribers, like Game of Thrones. This could be quite a hurdle for Netflix, who may struggle to offer their subscribers premium content as they focus on their recently-announced goal to have at least 50% of its available content be original programming. So with a major deal that threatens to challenge their own streaming service offerings on the verge of closing, what's a giant like Netflix going to do to fight back? Well, that's where Disney comes in, as the massive media company is apparently looking to buy an OTT distribution service of their own, and Netflix is one of the biggest and most universal out there. Of course, Disney already has their own Netflix-rivalling streaming service in DisneyLife, but TechCrunch argues that a form of merger between the two companies would actually benefit them both: Netflix would give Disney an undeniable lead in the OTT world, while Disney's content library — in volume alone — would be tough for any competitor to beat. The biggest cause of speculation that a deal could be made between the two companies, though, lies with Disney CEO Bob Iger and Netflix co-founder Reed Hastings. As Iger is set to retire in 2018, the Disney board has been searching for his possible replacement, and Hastings is a name that's been linked to the position in a bid to bring the company up-to-date with the new media world. Whether or not any of this actually happens is, of course, still very much up in the air for now. Netflix is still making a profit, even if it isn't meeting its projected subscriber numbers, and the company has admitted itself that it's growing \"but not as fast as we would like\". Disney, meanwhile, is having a great year, with hits like Captain America: Civil War and Finding Dory already taking its 2016 box office total into the billions of dollars - and that's before Rogue One: A Star Wars Story is released in December. And here all we were hoping for from Netflix was offline viewing. Want up-to-the-minute entertainment and tech news?

      "text": "Lauren Graham and Alexis Bledel (Credit: Netflix) More Where the Gilmore Girls lead, we will follow! It’s been nine long years since super mother-daughter duo Lorelai and Rory Gilmore drank all the coffee in Stars Hollow, gorged on junk food and Chinese takeout, fell in and out of love, and dropped every pop culture reference imaginable in their rapid-fire banter. Now the Gilmores are back to drink even more coffee, talk even faster, and charm us more than ever in Netflix’s continuation of the series, which premieres Nov. 25.\nIn four 90-minute episodes, titled “Winter,” “Spring,” “Summer,” and “Fall,” Lorelai (Lauren Graham), Rory (Alexis Bledel), and grandmother Emily (Kelly Bishop) all face big changes in their lives. To get ready for the revival, we’re highlighting all the things we love about the show with our official Return to Stars Hollow coverage, from the wacky supporting characters to the insanely clever dialogue to the girls’ complicated love lives. Check back here every day until Nov. 25 to obsess with us over all things Gilmore.\n– – – – – – – –\nBrew up a big batch (or few) of coffee and pull out the doughnuts, candy, pizza, and Chinese food! The Gilmore Girls are back!\nThe beloved dramedy returns nine years after its broadcast series finale for a six-hour revival on Netflix. And that means more rapid-fire banter, more winking pop cultural references, more zany small-town antics, more romance, more laughter, more tears, and of course … lots more coffee.\nHere’s everything you need to know about Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life :\nWhen, Where, and How Do I Watch? All four 90-minute episodes (or as creator Amy Sherman-Palladino prefers to call them, minimovies) will be available to stream on Netflix in the U.S. at 12:01 a.m. Pacific Time on Friday, Nov. 25, aka the day after Thanksgiving.\nThe four episodes are titled “Winter,” “Spring,” “Summer,” and “Fall” (a nod to the show’s theme song “Where You Lead” by Carole King).\nWho’s Back for the Revival? Alexis Bledel, Scott Patterson, Kelly Bishop, and Lauren Graham (Credit: Netflix) More Original series stars Lauren Graham (Lorelai), Alexis Bledel (Rory), Kelly Bishop (Emily), Scott Patterson (Luke), Keiko Agena (Lane), Liza Weil (Paris), David Sutcliffe (Christopher), and Melissa McCarthy (Sookie) all reprise their roles.\nAll three of Rory’s boyfriends are also back: Jared Padalecki as Dean, Milo Ventimiglia as Jess, and Matt Czuchry as Logan.\nMilo Ventimiglia and Scott Patterson (Credit: Netflix) More And Stars Hollow will be bursting with the usual lovable townspeople, including: Sean Gunn (Kirk), Yanic Truesdale (Michel), Todd Lowe (Zach), Jackson Douglas (Jackson), Sally Struthers (Babette), Liz Torres (Miss Patty), Michael Winters (Taylor), Emily Kuroda (Mrs. Kim), Sebastian Bach (Gil), Rose Abdoo (Gypsy), Mike Gandolfi (Andrew), Rini Bell (Lulu), Grant-Lee Phillips (Troubadour), and Carole King (Sophie).\nOther familiar faces include Danny Strong (Doyle), Gregg Henry (Mitchum Huntzberger), Tanc Sade (Finn), Alan Loayza (Colin), Vanessa Marano (April), Dakin Matthews (Headmaster Charleston), Chris Eigeman (Jason aka Digger), and Paul Anka the dog.\nWho’s NOT Coming Back? Make of it what you will, but these cast members will not be returning: Scott Cohen (Max Medina), Kathleen Wilhoite (Liz), Wayne Wilcox (Marty), Devon Sorvari (Honor Huntzberger), and Nicolette Collier (Gigi).\nAnd of course, sadly, the great Edward Herrmann passed away in 2014 and will not be reprising his role as Gilmore patriarch Richard. But he will make an impact on the revival.\nRead More Related: 26 of the Greatest ‘Gilmore Girls’ Guests\nWho’s New? The revival features small roles or cameos by Sutton Foster (she starred in Sherman-Palladino’s series Bunheads ), Mae Whitman (who played Graham’s daughter in Parenthood ), Christian Borle ( Smash ), Stacey Oristano ( Friday Night Lights ), and Dan Bucatinsky ( Scandal ).\nWhat’s It All About? The first episode, “Winter,” picks up four months after Richard’s death, though it will feature a memorial for him. At that point, all three Gilmore girls — Lorelai, Rory, and Emily — will face major life changes.\nKelly Bishop, Lauren Graham, and Alexis Bledel (Credit: Netflix) More As seen in the trailer , Rory is a journalist, but struggling with her career and living a bit aimlessly. Lorelai is still running the Dragonfly Inn and in a relationship with Luke but seems to be at a crossroads. And Emily is trying to figure out what her life looks like now that Richard is gone.\nWhat’s Lorelai’s Deal? As previously mentioned, Lorelai is with Luke, but they aren’t married — yet. Rumors are flying that the revival features a wedding, but even if true, it might not be for L&L.\nThe trailer hints that Lorelai undergoes a midlife crisis. We might start to see a whole new Lorelai. In the trailer, she’s seen hiking (what?!) and talking to a therapist (whoa!).\n“ I thought I knew exactly what I wanted, and where I was going, but lately, I don’t know, things seem hazier,” she muses. Uh-oh, does that spell trouble for her relationship with Luke?\nScott Patterson and Lauren Graham (Credit: Netflix) More But one relationship that might improve is the bond with her mother, Emily. As Graham told TV Line, “ The healing that happens between Lorelai and Emily is such a long time coming. And because Richard’s absence is such a big part of our story, it really meant a lot to me to grow their relationship a little bit.”\nWhat’s the Deal With Rory? And Who Does She End Up With? Rory is reportedly single and dating, but the inclusion of all three of her exes is eyebrow-raising. She is clearly on friendly terms with Jess in the trailer, but her relationships with Dean and Logan are unknown. It is interesting that quite a few characters tied to Logan — the Life & Death Brigade crowd and his father — will make appearances.\nBut Rory’s journey in A Year in the Life isn’t all about romance. Sherman-Palladino insisted to Time , “ It’s a small part of who Rory is. Rory didn’t spend her days thinking, ‘Who am I going to end up with?’ Rory was much more concerned about ‘How do I get that interview at the New York Times?’”\nAlexis Bledel (Credit: Netflix) More Rory is living a nomadic life as she deals with upheaval in the journalism business. She moves back home from New York for a while, joking in a clip shown at EW’s Popfest, “ Lena Dunham’s just going to have to get along without me.”\nWhat’s Emily’s Deal? Richard’s death is a huge turning point for Emily, as she puts together the pieces of her life without him.\n“ She has different adventures, some of them are funny, some of them are sad,” Bishop told People . “She’s just kind of plodding along trying to find herself, how she does it now, what it means.”\nAlexis Bledel and Kelly Bishop (Credit: Netflix) More Apparently, as seen in the trailer, it means commissioning an oversized portrait of Richard, cleaning house, and wearing jeans — jeans!\nWhat’s Happening in Stars Hollow? The town is putting on “Stars Hollow: The Musical,” and guest stars Foster and Borle (both Tony winners) will take part in that.\nLiz Torres, Sally Struthers, Alexis Bledel, and Lauren Graham (Credit: Netflix) More There are reportedly two town meetings (one of which is glimpsed in the trailer), and an international food fair (a photo shows Lane and Rory manning a Korean food stall).\nEmily Kuroda, Keiko Agena, and Alexis Bledel (Credit: Netflix) More What Are Those Four Words? Ah, the infamous last four words. Back in 2006, Sherman-Palladino revealed she had long planned the end of Gilmore Girls and that it involved four words. Then, due to contractual issues, she was ousted as showrunner for the seventh and final season. And fans didn’t get the four words.\nNow, the revival will put a bow on that outstanding issue. “Fall” will end with those four words. All anyone knows for sure about them is that they are spoken by Lorelai and Rory. Sherman-Palladino has pleaded with fans not to skip ahead to the ending to hear the words, nor spoil them for anyone else online.\nAlexis Bledel and Lauren Graham (Credit: Netflix) More “ I do think that it’s going to mean a lot more if you’ve taken the journey, and it’s going to mean a lot less if you just flip to the last page,” Sherman-Palladino told journalists last summer. “That being said, what can I do? I would hope that people would want to take the whole trip. It’s a fun trip. It’s worth it. There’s peanuts.”\nGilmore Girls: A Year in the Life premieres Nov. 25 on Netflix.",

      "text": "by Gina Carbone \nWill there be more \"Gilmore Girls\" after \"A Year in the Life\" ? The Netflix revival leaves room for another return, but the Gilmore girls themselves seem to think this should be the end. At least for now. TVLine talked to Lauren Graham and Alexis Bledel in a video chat before the November 25 debut of \"Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life.\" The stars were asked if they got a sense of closure from this experience, knowing that fans are already begging for more. \"We can't go through this heartache again,\" Graham said with a laugh. Bledel said she feels a sense of a \"bookend,\" in a way. \"Because we got to revisit the series after so long, it wasn't necessarily easy for this to come together, it was kind of a long time coming, so just to get a chance to do it seems conclusive enough.\" Graham added, \"Isn't that enough?\" Bledel continued, \"In a way it feels more special to have one sort of reunion as opposed to it never-ending.\" Graham joked about Rory visiting Lorelai in an old folk's home on \"Grandma Girls,\" which sounds awesome. Graham said, for her part, she definitely feels a sense of closure: \"It was complete and utter — for me as an actor and a character — closure. I don't think the show itself closes. It's like, when in a horror movie, everyone is fine and then there's one last [scary] thing and you're like, 'I guess they could go on.' That's a little bit how it feels to me.\" However, Graham said this is how Amy Palladino always wanted to end the series, so if they returned it wouldn't be because the creator still didn't get a chance to say what she wanted to say. However, Bledel said she thinks there's a part of Palladino that would like \"Gilmore Girls\" to never end. Graham agreed, adding, \"I get both sides, but I think we [Alexis and I] both feel very proud of what we got to do and I think we'd like to just enjoy that for a minute.\" Yeah, no rush. It is important to keep this \"special\" instead of risking disappointment or just apathy, although there are plenty of fans out there who would be thrilled to watch these characters decades from now on \"Grandma Girls.\" Watch their video at TVLine . \"Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life\" will be available for streaming next Friday, November 25.

      "text": "The Gilmores and the Bravermans are colliding!\nWith the premiere of Netflix's Gilmore Girls revival just a few short weeks away, we're eagerly waiting to reunite with old friends, and welcome some new faces to Stars Hollow. Earlier this year, it was confirmed that Lauren Graham 's on-screen daughter from Parenthood , Mae Whitman , will be making a special appearance at some point in the four-part episode event.\nTo help get you even more excited for this Braverman family reunion, we caught up with Graham to get the exclusive behind-the-scenes scoop on what it was like to have her two on-screen daughters together on the same show.\n\"It was wonderful!\" the brunette beauty gushed to ET at the Television Critics Association summer press tour.\nMORE: 'Gilmore Girls' Revival: Mae Whitman Cast in Mystery Role\nFor those of you (like us!) who were hoping that Whitman would have a significant role in the Gilmore Girls revival, Graham was quick to reveal the truth. \"Mae is in the show for about 40 seconds,\" she admitted with a laugh. \"And she was extremely ill that day [we were shooting], so she was throwing up in between takes. Am I allowed to say that? Is that a spoiler?\"\n\"No, cause it's behind-the-scenes stuff,\" Alexis Bledel assured her TV mom. Phew!\nSpoilers aside, Graham was candid about the vibe on set during Whitman's short-but-sweet cameo \"While it was joyous, it was not anybody's best, easiest workday,\" she said.\nEXCLUSIVE: Lauren Graham Spills on Having Melissa McCarthy Back in 'Gilmore Girls' Revival\nGilmore Girls fun fact: This wasn't the first time that Graham's two TV daughters met. In 2015, Whitman and Bledel came face-to-face at Gilmore Girls ' 15-year reunion celebration at the ATX Television Festival in Austin and they shared the hilarious daughter v. daughter moment.\n\"AT LONG LAST WE MEET #drawyourswords #breaktheinternet,\" Whitman captioned the Instagram photo of Graham caught between Amber Braverman (Whitman) and Rory Gilmore (Bledel).\nGraham added that it was \"great\" to be able to welcome Whitman to Stars Hollow since the two have not acted side-by-side since Parenthood 's series finale in 2015. \"We live in a very small world,\" the 49-year-old actress said. \"I'm so proud to know both of these women, and I love it when worlds collide. It's always funny and fun.\"\nGilmore Girls ' four-part event premieres Friday, Nov. 25 on Netflix.\nRelated Articles\nJenna Dewan Tatum Shows Off Toned Abs Chrissy Teigen Goes Makeup-Free Jennifer Garner Slays On The Red Carpet",

      "text": "Black Mirror has found its spiritual home. The move from England's channel 4 to Netflix seems as inevitable as the choose-your-own-dystopias the show lays out for us. Netflix , after all, is a service that has made bingeing acceptable, so where better to house Black Mirror , an addictive show that tackles the fears we have about society.\nThe newest season of Black Mirror is so bleak (except for this episode!) that we formed a PCMag support group on Slack , where each week we'll chat about an episode from Black Mirror's third season; here are our chats about episode one , two , and three . This week, Jordan Minor, Rob Marvin, Matthew Buzzi, Chandra Steele, Victoria Song, Eric Griffith, and Pete Haas discuss our universally favorite episode \"San Junipero.\"\n\nMinor [10:28 AM]\nOOH BABY DO YOU KNOW WHAT THAT'S WORTH pic.twitter.com/KtGBBOw6kI \n— Jim Trinca (@Jim_Trinca) November 13, 2016 \n\n\nMarvin [10:30 AM]\n^I really like this new tweet format\n\nBuzzi [10:31 AM]\nPeople, an episode was actually...uplifting!\n\n[10:31]\nI mean don't get used to it or anything\n\nSteele [10:31 AM]\nCan we only talk about this episode every week?\n\nSong [10:31 AM]\nWho knew a Belinda Carlisle song would be the anthem of hope in 2016?\n\nSlackbot [10:31 AM]\n¯\\_( ? )_/¯\n\nSteele [10:32 AM]\nUpload ourselves to San Junipero, the streaming version\n\nGriffith [10:32 AM]\nafter last week, we need episode 4\n\nHaas [10:32 AM]\nthey could've made the central tech in this episode into something dark and I'm glad they decided to go in the opposite direction\n\nSong [10:32 AM]\nI bet they don't worry about garbage elections in San Junipero.\\\n\nBuzzi [10:32 AM]\nEven though it had some generally sad themes throughout, managed to be heartwarming\n\nSong [10:32 AM]\nPoignant.\n\nHaas [10:33 AM]\nyou have to turn off your brain a little and just surrender to the 80s cheerfulness of it\n\nSteele [10:33 AM]\nJust like the song Girlfriend in a Coma\n\nGriffith [10:33 AM]\nThey can revisit this future a lot for other stories. the tech is right out of Ready Player One (soon to be a Spielberg blockbuster)\n\nSong [10:34 AM]\nYou know what was cool? This was simultaneously a futuristic and period piece.\n\n[10:34]\nThat's some creative storycraft.\n\nMinor [10:34 AM]\nCalling this the best episode of the season or even the show kind of seems like an understatement since it's so different from the M.O.\n\nGriffith [10:34 AM]\nIt's a \"very special episode\"\n\nHaas [10:34 AM]\nwhat's fascinating is that the rest of the series now feels like a setup for this episode\n\nBuzzi [10:34 AM]\nContrast with how episode 3 was the worst because it was hardly part of the show\n\nHaas [10:34 AM]\nbecause you're expecting something horrible to happen the entire time\n\nSong [10:35 AM]\n:Puts on omniscient voice: There is a clear reason San Junipero is smack dab in the middle!\n\nGriffith [10:35 AM]\nimagine what the trolls in that service would do to the kid in episode 3 when he logged in.\n\nSteele [10:35 AM]\nYou have the power of foresight\n\n[10:35]\nI am watching week to week as we do this\n\nSong [10:35 AM]\nPretty sure lots of people would've quit halfway through the elongated season given how bleak the rest of the episodes are\n\n[10:35]\nwith the exception of Nosedive\n\n[10:35]\nThink it was massively strategic to put Nosedive first and San Junipero right when you're ready to just give up.\n\n[10:35]\nTHEY PULL YOU BACK IN.\n\nBuzzi [10:36 AM]\nReally just 2 harsh ones then, which isn't exactly out of line with the rest of the show\n\nSong [10:36 AM]\nNot to foreshadow episodes 5 & 6, but this is really just a contained oasis.\n\nMarvin [10:36 AM]\nSan Junipero is definitely the only episode so far that's left me with that same complete feeling of awe/wonderment that I got from a few of the standout episodes in earlier seasons\n\n[10:37]\nJordan's right, it's because the M.O. is so different\n\nSong [10:37 AM]\nIt's also hitting on a lot of the things the tech industry as a whole are talking about right now--virtual reality, life extension.\n\nGriffith [10:37 AM]\nand that inevitable plug into the brain we all should have by now\n\nMarvin [10:37 AM]\nIt was the right balance of atmosphere and a really relatable sci-fi tech future\n\nGriffith [10:37 AM]\nand there was love!\n\nMarvin [10:38 AM]\nA lifelong paralyzed woman got a new life!\n\nMinor [10:38 AM]\nHow many more 80s-set prestige dramas can Cameron Mackenzie be in?\n\nSong [10:38 AM]\nOriginally, I read that the story was meant to be a man and a woman; so it's a nice twist and a nod to the diversity in S3 that it got changed to an interracial LGBTQ couple.\n\nSteele [10:38 AM]\nShe really has the face for it\n\nSong [10:39 AM]\nAnd Yorkie's story feels a whole lot more tragic and relevant given the current climate because of it.\n\nSteele [10:39 AM]\nMaybe Cameron is actually visiting us from the 80s\n\nSong [10:39 AM]\n(Halt and Catch Fire is really good too...)\n\nMinor [10:40 AM]\nThe virtual fantasy becomes even more powerful when it's something actively discouraged in the real world\n\nSteele [10:40 AM]\nThis is one of the most distinctly un-British of the new Black Mirror episodes\n\n[10:41]\nEpisode 1 was the dark side of American optimism\n\n[10:41]\nAnd this is the best of it\n\n[10:41]\nLast week when we had American optimism\nMarvin [10:41 AM]\nSo were people rooting for Kelly to choose San Junipero at the end or to join her husband in the analog afterlife/nothingness?\n\nSteele [10:41 AM]\nNow it's just dead and living in San Junipero\n\nSong [10:41 AM]\nI don't think that's a binary choice. I think...she ended up having both.\n\n[10:41]\nBecause, her brain and body are dead. Her consciousness lives on in a server, but who knows how long that is.\n\n[10:42]\nAnd whether or not that uploaded consciousness is actually you, or a clone of you.\n\nSteele [10:42 AM]\nSo not both simultaneously?\n\nSong [10:42 AM]\nSo I don't see why she can't have both stayed with her husband and daughter, as well as Yorkie.\n\nHaas [10:42 AM]\nI was definitely rooting for her to choose san junipero. as she said, she didn't even believe in heaven. she was just punishing herself by not choosing to give this VR afterlife a chance\n\nSong [10:42 AM]\nA rare case where I think you can have your cake and eat it too.\n\n[10:42]\nAlso I think there's a line where Yorkie hints you can opt to \"delete\" yourself\n\nGriffith [10:42 AM]\nthey should make multiple copies, she could live all over!\n\nSong [10:42 AM]\nI could be wrong\n\nHaas [10:43 AM]\nyeah, they do mention being able to remove yourself\n\nMarvin [10:43 AM]\nCan you take vacations from San Junipero to visit other VR communities in the datacenter/world? I hope so\n\nSong [10:43 AM]\nThere's a plane!\n\n[10:43]\nIn the end credits scene!\n\nMinor [10:43 AM]\nI liked the detail that you could visit other decades\n\nMarvin [10:43 AM]\nRight, and that you had to guess which decade each person was most at home in\n\nSong [10:44 AM]\nAlso, can we just say that 80s fashion montage Yorkie goes through? That was just plain fun.\n\nSteele [10:44 AM]\nThe Addicted to Love look was fantastic\n\nGriffith [10:44 AM]\nhaving lived through the 80s (AHEM) I watched those fashions and thought... well, it wasn't quite that... vivid.\n\n[10:44]\nthat should have been my clue it was in-game\n\n[10:44]\nso to speak\n\nSong [10:44 AM]\nOr the hints about midnight and only having a few hours.\n\nBuzzi [10:45 AM]\nI was wondering what happens when whatever funding is keeping their virtual worlds running goes down....\n\nMinor [10:45 AM]\nDidn't Kelly have a line about people taking their styles from what they probably saw in movies? That they were overdoing it?\n\nGriffith [10:45 AM]\nSeriously, that company needs better data centers.\n\nSong [10:45 AM]\ngovernment subsidies! taxes! heaven is a place on earth buzzi!\n\nSteele [10:45 AM]\nI did keep thinking about how much this would cost\n\nBuzzi [10:45 AM]\nUntil they pull funding or the company goes out of business!\n\nMinor [10:45 AM]\nForfeit your social security for your San Junipero ticket\n\nSteele [10:45 AM]\nOr a natural disaster destroys the data center\n\nSong [10:46 AM]\nDeath is inevitable guys. You can delay it with virtual reality heaven, but you're still gonna die.\n\nMarvin [10:46 AM]\nThe corporate angle definitely stuck with me after. Like wringing out a family's savings to get their consciousness a spot in the community...but wait it's a SaaS model so you've got to pay yearly to keep their digital selves alive\n\nGriffith [10:46 AM]\nas long as my consciousness is on a USB drive I AM IMMORTAL\n\nSong [10:46 AM]\nWell, maybe the company was also funding it through other types of research.\n\n[10:46]\nThey were using it as a type of cognitive treatment for preventing dementia.\n\n[10:46]\nhence the 5 hour limit\n\nSteele [10:47 AM]\nIf they figured out the Singularity, it seems weird that they couldn't cure diseases\n\nMarvin [10:47 AM]\nOh, not to mention the company is probably collecting and using all the cerebral data of its \"residents\"\n\nSong [10:47 AM]\nOK YOU GUYS\n\nGriffith [10:47 AM]\ndoctors gave up on curing disease when they could spend all day dancing to the 80s tunes\n\nSong [10:47 AM]\nARE YOU TRYING TO MAKE IT INTO A MORE BLACK MIRROR EPISODE\n\nMarvin [10:47 AM]\nbut that's cynical business journalist talkin'. This episode was lovely\n\nSong [10:47 AM]\nCAN WE JUST BE HAPPY\n\nSteele [10:47 AM]\nWe should take it for what it is\n\nBuzzi [10:47 AM]\nData Mining The Dead: My Column\n\nSteele [10:47 AM]\nLike San Junipero itself\n\nMinor [10:47 AM]\nanother great detail, people doing the most indulgent things they could find to feel anything again\n\nSong [10:47 AM]\nI can't even with you Buzzi right now.\n\nHaas [10:48 AM]\nright, there are a lot of potential downsides to the VR itself. also we know that there are some people who are kind of miserable there, which is why they spend time going to that weird oil refinery/sex club to try and actually feel\n\nMinor [10:48 AM]\nvery relatable\n\nBuzzi [10:48 AM]\nthat Mad Max spinoff town\n\nHaas [10:48 AM]\ncan we talk about how fucking weird that place looked? my god\n\nSong [10:48 AM]\nWell...I guess you would get bored if you had nothing to do with eternity\n\nMarvin [10:49 AM]\nSan Junipero's main attractions: cheesy disco or dungeon sex barn!\n\nSong [10:49 AM]\nNo jobs. No new content.\n\nMinor [10:49 AM]\nand when you consider they're all old, it's like the final evolution of Swingers\n\nSong [10:49 AM]\nJust an endless stroll through memory lane.\n\nSteele [10:49 AM]\nBuzzi would be writing content\n\nHaas [10:49 AM]\ntrue, and not everyone found a special someone to enjoy this virtual after-life with\n\nGriffith [10:49 AM]\nthey need a Westworld narrative\n\nMarvin [10:49 AM]\nlike sad James Dean knockoff guy\n\nHaas [10:49 AM]\nI'd be that goddamn dweeb in the arcade\n\nSong [10:49 AM]\nlol pete noo\n\n[10:50]\nwe can all vouch you dress better\n\n[10:50]\nand do not lurk sipping soda weirdly\n\nBuzzi [10:50 AM]\nhe struck out in like 3 different decades, that has to be a record\n\nSteele [10:50 AM]\nHe kept going with the same look\n\nGriffith [10:50 AM]\nSan Junipero is, essentiall, Second Life. a \"game\" with nothing to do but interact.\n\nSteele [10:50 AM]\nIf you're going to bother to switch decades, change up your style\n\nGriffith [10:51 AM]\nit would absolutely need a narrative to keep people interested.\n\nSong [10:51 AM]\nGugu Mbatha-Raw :raised_hands:\n\n[10:51]\nShe looked real good in all the decades.\n\nGriffith [10:51 AM]\nthats why Second Life is dead and Warcraft is still clinging to life.\n\nSteele [10:51 AM]\nShe really did, even in present time\n\n[10:51]\nOr whatever time\n\nMarvin [10:51 AM]\nGugu slayed\n\nHaas [10:51 AM]\nshe had a lisa turtle thing going in the 80s\n\nMinor [10:51 AM]\nAnyone ever see Beyond the Lights?\n\nMarvin [10:52 AM]\nYes!\n\nSong [10:52 AM]\nLove that little purple blazer with the shoulderpads.\n\n[10:52]\nGod the shoulderpads.\n\nSteele [10:52 AM]\nAnd the earrings\n\nMinor [10:52 AM]\nShe's great at \"I act care-free but am actually harboring deep pain\"\n\n[10:52]\ngreat aesthetic\n\nSong [10:53 AM]\nIt did make me wonder whether I'd go to San Junipero though.\n\n[10:53]\nBut that might be young hubris talking.\n\nSteele [10:53 AM]\nI'm inclined to think I wouldn't\n\nSong [10:54 AM]\nIf I were older, the chance to be young again would be so tempting.\n\nGriffith [10:54 AM]\nit's a place you go once. not over and over.\n\nBuzzi [10:54 AM]\nAlmost weird how they even include the depressing club in the universe--I guess everyone can pick their poison, so to speak, but it's like, 'hey come be sad at this place forever'\n\nSong [10:54 AM]\nYou guys—youth is wasted on the young!\n\n[10:54]\nI mean, maybe the options for what you can do at San Junipero are limited, but if you could do whatever you wanted?\n\n[10:55]\nLike you can in life? Literally live after you're dead, forever and eternally young until you get bored?\n\nMarvin [10:55 AM]\nI mean for someone like Yorkie it was literally a new life\n\nSong [10:55 AM]\nSheet. All that free time not worrying about how I'm gonna pay rent.\n\nMinor [10:55 AM]\nLimitations or not, you can party and play video games and have sex. Pretty good options!\n\nMarvin [10:55 AM]\nBut I suppose there was that option to just delete yourself if you've had enough\n\nSteele [10:55 AM]\nYeah, if you lived a full and complete life like Kelly, that decision is definitely harder\n\nBuzzi [10:55 AM]\nDelete your account\n\nSong [10:56 AM]\nOy. Dying a second death.\n\nSteele [10:56 AM]\nThat would be the worst thing you could say to someone there\n\nBuzzi [10:56 AM]\nI'd probably go. Dying for good is for squares\n\nHaas [10:56 AM]\nI mean, they have to acknowledge that this heaven is what you make of it. and hey, maybe some of those people at Exxon Valdez Sexorium like it\n\nBuzzi [10:56 AM]\n:laughing:\n\nMarvin [10:56 AM]\nPete just made us all audibly crack up\n\nSong [10:57 AM]\n\"Exxon Valdez Sexorium\"\n\nHaas [10:57 AM]\nI'd give san junipero a shot. I like video games so why not?\n\n[10:57]\nI would not be surprised at all if it went horribly wrong though\n\nBuzzi [10:57 AM]\nNone of those trash arcade games though\n\nSteele [10:58 AM]\nYou couldn't play Pac-Man for eternity?\n\nSong [10:58 AM]\nI'd want to go if you could travel to other places in San Junipero; why else would you have all those roads and planes\n\nHaas [10:58 AM]\nbuzzi spending his virtual afterlife smashing 2D arcade games\n\nMarvin [10:58 AM]\nI think I would go, and then try to keep jet-setting around the virtual universe like King Candy from Wreck-It Ralph\n\nBuzzi [10:58 AM]\nyeah that is actually my version of hell, trapped with old 2D games\n\nMinor [10:58 AM]\nDon't worry Buzzi, they have the rare Destiny arcade cabinet\n\nBuzzi [10:58 AM]\nI could literally play Destiny forever\n\nMinor [10:58 AM]\nfamous game with enough content to last eternity\n\nSong [10:58 AM]\n...\n\n[10:58]\nUnplug yourself\n\nBuzzi [10:58 AM]\nThink how many Civilization campaigns I could complete\n\nSong [10:59 AM]\nMy god.\n\nHaas [10:59 AM]\noh! I had a question: who works in san junipero? do you think the bartenders are staffers at those retirement homes?\n\nGriffith [10:59 AM]\ndid that guy at the arcade hitting on Yorkie ever find love?\n\nMinor [10:59 AM]\nPete The same people working as bank tellers in EVE Online\n\nSong [10:59 AM]\nWho knows. Maybe they're AI. Like NPCs.\n\nGriffith [10:59 AM]\nHosts.\n\nBuzzi [10:59 AM]\nHah, some people just get burdened with the manual labor jobs in their afterlives\n\n[10:59]\nDrew the short straw\n\nSteele [11:00 AM]\nIt was a nice touch to have Tucker's be the corporation, minus all the vowels of course\n\nSong [11:00 AM]\nOr maybe they're all aspiring mixologists\n\n[11:00]\nNow if you saw a janitor in San Junipero, then i'd be sad.\n\nMarvin [11:00 AM]\nMaybe if you don't have the money to pay for San Junipero outright, it's like an indentured servitude kind of thing? Cook french fries for a few million years and then you can stay\n\n[11:01]\npayment plan\n\nSong [11:01 AM]\nI can't imagine Yorkie was rich.\n\nSteele [11:01 AM]\nLike Max's view of traveling to Mars\n\nGriffith [11:01 AM]\nSan Junipero is the new Social Security\n\nMinor [11:01 AM]\nI do not believe that Elon Musk is hatching an evil scheme to become a space dictator . But I have concerns.\n\nMarvin [11:01 AM]\nI would like to think that social security or government subsidy pays for it. For once, let's hope it's not just the elite that get to play with the cool toys for eternity\n\nSong [11:01 AM]\nMaybe it's covered by health insurance. In the future timeline where Obamacare wasn't repealed but improved upon.\n\nMinor [11:02 AM]\nMaybe something good could happen\n\nSong [11:02 AM]\nYorkie and Kelly didn't strike me as super rich types\n\n[11:02]\nso that gives me hope\n\nHaas [11:03 AM]\nright, I was waiting for one of them to have an \"oops, your insurance doesn't cover this\" scene\n\nBuzzi [11:03 AM]\nI remember hope\n\nHaas [11:03 AM]\nor \"oops, you're gonna be working in the san junipero sewers\"\n\nSong [11:03 AM]\nDo you even need sewers in San Junipero\n\nMarvin [11:03 AM]\nOh and it took me a while to realize why the names with little lights in the data center gave me the creeps but maybe fellow hebrew @Steele can back me up on this...did it remind you of the little mourning lights and name plaques they put up in synagogues?\n\nSteele [11:04 AM]\nIt is like that!\n\nBuzzi [11:04 AM]\nOne clear takeaway is that we have a LOT of unanswered questions about San Junipero infrastructure\n\nHaas [11:04 AM]\nI mean, I'd want to take showers in VR\n\nBuzzi [11:04 AM]\nSewers, wait staff, all the exciting stuff\n\nSteele [11:04 AM]\nBut with robot arms\n\nSong [11:04 AM]\nYeah but it's all a virtual world. If you can imagine it, it's there.\n\n[11:04]\nClearly given how fast they can change clothes.\n\nSteele [11:04 AM]\nAside from the essentially living forever, that was my favorite part\n\nSong [11:05 AM]\nI imagine you could take a shower if you wanted but since it's all imaginary, you don't need an actual sewer system or the messier aspects of a human body.\n\nBuzzi [11:05 AM]\nI'm wondering about that in relation to things, buildings, and places. Did someone wish the Sexorium into existence, or do they get a prebuilt world and that's that?\n\nMarvin [11:05 AM]\nYeah the degree to which you can change your surroundings and warp the reality around you is really interesting. Wasn't enough time to delve that far of field in the ep\n\nSong [11:05 AM]\nMaybe it's a mix of both.

      "text": "  Netflix's 'Making a Murderer's' subject Brendan Dassey ordered to be freed from jail Netflix's famous documentary: 'Making a Murderer's' subject Brendan Dassey was recently ordered by the court to be released from the prison By Soutrik Das , EnStars on Nov 16, 2016 01:25 AM EST Making a Murderer nephew Brendan Dassey freed by judge (Photo : Flickr/Sarah Winstton) Advertisement \nA judge in Wisconsin has ordered that Brendan Dassey who is a subject of Netflix documentary series 'Making A Murderer', to be freed from the prison. It should be noted that his trial for murder was the actual plot of Netflix's reality based documentary series \nAccording to NPR , in August 2016, Judge William Duffin examined Dassey's conviction for killing a woman in 2005 and ordered that he must be released within the period of 90 days unless prosecutors file an appeal. Wisconsin's attorney general did file a notice of appeal in September, calling the August decision \"wrong on the facts and wrong on the law.\" \nBut on the grounds of his innocence and good behavioral impact, Dassey's lawyers tabled a petition in the court to release him despite the appeal, In addition, his lawyers also said that he did not pose any danger to the society and the community and was not likely to run away. According to CNN , Duffin ruled in court that Dassey, who is now 27, is to be freed under the supervision of the US Probation Office under certain conditions. It should be noted in this context that he was prisoned at the age of 16 when he confessed murder photographer Teresa Halbach. \nDassey was convicted majorly on his statement to police authorities that he had helped to rape and kill the woman. Therefore, under Wisconsin's sex offender registry law, Dassey may also be required to register himself as a sex offender as well. Wisconsin's Attorney General Brad Schimel later said that he would file an appeal on the grounds of emergency regulations to prevent Dassey's release. It should be noted that Dassey's uncle, whom he actually associated to rape and murder that lady, is currently serving a life sentence after being convicted in a separate trial. \n ",

      "text": "shows Share this article \nNot that long ago, Netflix graced us with their new original series, Stranger Things . Easily the most binge-watchable, nail biting show streaming to date. If you haven’t watched this show, stop reading this article and watch it! So far we have only been blessed with season one, but luckily, season two is set to be released next year. However, season one has left us with many questions… \nWARNING: SPOILER ALERT \n1. Will Eleven ever learn that Eggos are better served with butter and syrup? \nI mean I get that Eggos are much easier to eat with your hands, but it’s a little savage, Eleven… \n2. Are we ever going to learn about 001–010? Who were/are those people? \nIt’s safe to assume that there were/are 10 others of whatever the hell Eleven is. \n3. Did Lucas and Dustin’s parents even care that they were never home? \nDO THEIR PARENTS NOT LOVE THEM? I would totally adopt Lucas. Lil nugget! \n4. Is Barb really dead? \nNot that anyone would care since no one even batted an eye that she was missing in the first place. \n5. Is Brenner actually Eleven’s father or does she just call him Papa because he’s the main man in her life? \nI, personally, believe that Brenner is a freakin’ weirdo that has brainwashed Eleven into thinking so, but he isn’t really. Who would bone him? \n6. Is Dr. Brenner actually dead? \nAs great as that would be, we only saw the Demogorgon potentially swallow him, but, from the angle they showed us, nothing is definitive. \n7. Who is in charge of that freakish, government lab now that Brenner is “dead”? \nAlthough Brenner might not actually be dead, it’s a fair question. \n8. Why does Eleven’s nose bleed when she controls anything with her mind? \nThis doesn’t seem very healthy… \n9. Did the Demogorgon ACTUALLY die? \nI mean it just evaporated, but did it teleport somewhere else because it’s the Demogorgon and it can do some crazy shit? \n10. What does the monster want anyways?! \nLike what’s his deal? \n11. Is that ACTUALLY Will, or an Upside Down version of Will? \nIt would be like an evil, demented Will now after the Upside Down messed with him. \n12. Why is Eleven’s language so limited? \nShe understands Dr. Brenner, but she doesn’t seem to understand most other people. \n13. How did Will survive in the Upside Down for so long? \nI would hope he wasn’t eating those weird slugs all that time. \n14. HOW THE HELL did Will’s mom and Chief Hopper get out of the Upside Down? \nSince the Upside Down is a literal prison and all. \n15. What deal did Hopper make with those government people after they rescued Will? \nIt must’ve been pr tty big. \n16. How are they going to explain to everyone else in town that Will is actually alive? \nSome resurrection shit. \n17. Is Eleven still alive? \nGoing to answer this one myself because it's the most important question of them all. In the finale, we see Hopper leaving out some Eggo’s in the middle of the woods (typical Eleven). It’s safe to say that she is, as many sources have set this claim. \nWe can't wait for season two of Stranger Things !",

      "text": "Miffed that Stewart Lee’s Comedy Vehicle is no more ? Vexed that Live at the Apollo and its ilk offer barely a glimpse of the creative diversity of live comedy? Salvation may be at hand in the form of NextUp , a new live comedy streaming service (a “Netflix for new British comedy,” says the press officer), which launches this week.\nNextUp’s stated aim is to find a wider audience for the many fine shows that populate the Edinburgh fringe each year, tour if they’re lucky, then – for want of production resources or a DVD deal – sink without trace. Now, with NextUp’s help, they’ll be available to all of us; the channel’s roster at its launch includes shows from big-hitting acts like Stewart Lee , Miles Jupp and Luisa Omielan , and up-and-comers including Fern Brady , Alfie Brown and Ben Target.\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Fern Brady, one of the launch comedians for NextUp. Photograph: James Robertson\nThe theory is that creative comedy has a sizable potential audience out there that seldom gets to see it. Co-founder Sarah Henley says: “The idea arose because we as a team found it exceptionally sad that we’d come to the fringe every year and see incredible, lovingly crafted shows, which would … then disappear completely. We personally know hundreds of people who would love to see those shows but couldn’t make it to the fringe or don’t live in the towns the tours visit – and our research tells us there are thousands more who feel the same.” They can now access the site ’s vault of fringe comedy for a monthly subscription of £3.50 ($4.20); there’s also a 30-day free trial.\nFounded by the team behind YouTube channel and live comedy night ComComedy – and working with Stuart Snaith, formerly of BBC Worldwide – NextUp is a gamble, Henley admitted on launch day. Who knows how large the audience really is for the bubbling-under standups (Brennan Reece, Lou Sanders, Pat Cahill) whom NextUp will showcase? Is there really enough quality to go around? The channel’s Twitter feed bigs up its shows as “epic”, “incredible” and “hilarious”, which is setting the bar pretty high.\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Might broadcast exposure affect comedians’ stage earnings? Photograph: Sergio Azenha / Alamy/Alamy\nIt’s obviously a gamble for the comics too. Their material is their livelihood – submitting it for broadcast might shorten its stage shelf-life. Participating acts are promised 50% of NextUp’s income, divvied up according to share of downloads. But Henley has made no projections for what actual sums might be involved.\nActs have been releasing parts of shows on YouTube; to have it professionally curated has made it sit more comfortably\nSarah Henley, NextUp\nWhile acknowledging that comics are rightly protective of their material, Henley tells me that “the paywall has allayed their fears. And the industry is going that way anyway. Acts have been releasing their shows, or parts of their shows, on YouTube. So to now have it done professionally and in a curated way has made it sit more comfortably.” NextUp has an audience-development agenda, too: it encourages viewers to buy tickets for its acts’ live shows. Which is an important emphasis, because the most exciting live shows are exciting partly because they’re happening live rather than on a screen. At any rate, comedians have been universally positive about the project, Henley tells me – although their agents have been less forthcoming. “Some are wedded to the DVD model and traditional commissioning formats. There has been a bit of ‘let’s wait and see …’”\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Stewart Lee’s Comedy Vehicle: the standup’s sets will be available to stream. Photograph: BBC\nNextUp’s first batch of shows inspire confidence in its curation: I’ll seize the chance to catch up with sets by Lou Sanders, Sean McLoughlin and Jordan Brookes that I missed on the fringe. “We’re trying to get a wide variety,” Henley told me. “We’re looking for lovingly crafted hours rather than gag-heavy 20 minutes; shows with a narrative or through-line that shows how much work has gone into them. Live at the Apollo is a great vehicle for comics to get well known. But the industry is broader than that: if you’re a storytelling comic, that format might not work.”\nNextUp has its own issues with variety to resolve, mind you. There aren’t many non-white acts visible on the current bill – although you could say the same about the Edinburgh fringe. And, while character acts such as Anna Mann and Marcel Lucont feature, and there’s one double-act (Twins), sketch comedy is conspicuous by its absence. “It is mainly solo standups at the moment,” admits Henley. “Sketches are harder to produce.”\nThe company partners with Turtle Canyon Comedy to produce its content, and Henley is keenly aware that, when it comes to production standards in broadcast comedy, expectations have rocketed lately. “You don’t want to watch shoddy content. When we produce gigs, we make sure there’s a large audience, we have five cameras on it, there are audience mics. Quality has to be to DVD standard.”\nUntil recently it was an article of faith that “standup doesn’t work on TV”. Live at the Apollo, Michael McIntyre’s Roadshow – and even Stewart Lee’s Comedy Vehicle – have changed all that, but barely changed the narrow parameters of what live comedy is considered to be. NextUp’s new initiative can now test whether there’s a hidden audience for the offbeat, less mainstream acts that make live British comedy such a creative place to spend time. Good luck to them.\nThree to see\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Brendon Burns, heading out on tour with his show Black Comedian.

If you did too, there are two chances to redeem yourself, as the Chortle best newcomer nominee brings his reportedly tricksy nugget of meta-comedy to London.\n• Museum of Comedy, London , 16 and 17 November. Box office: 020-7534 1744.\nBrendon Burns\nNestled on the Free Fringe in August, Aussie veteran Burns scored a quietly impressive hit with Dumb White Guy, one of a handful of standup shows interrogating white privilege – here, in the context of Australia’s relationship with its indigenous population. Now renamed Black Comedian, the show tours the UK.\n• Hobos, Bridgend , 17 November. Box office: 01656 769576; Le Pub, Newport, 18 November. Box office: 01633 221477. Then touring the UK until 1 December.\nJenny Eclair\nAnother ex-Perrier champ continues to tour, with her How to Be a Middle Aged Woman (Without Going Insane) set. “Tackling the grey areas of the ageing process,” it hits London’s Royal Festival Hall this weekend, among other venues.\n• Royal Spa Centre, Leamington Spa , 16 November; Braintree Arts Centre, 19 November.

      "text": "How Netflix's New Parental Leave Policy Will Impact The Economy And The Gender Wage Gap \nAcross the nation, more than 100 million employees have no access to paid family leave, and one in four new mothers goes back to work just 10 days after giving birth. Only 13% of private-sector employees have access to paid family leave, and that number drops to 6% for low-wage employees. \nFurthermore, the PL+US study found that low-wage workers are often left out of family leave policies, though they are often the ones who need the financial support the most. For example, Walmart, the U.S.'s largest employer, confirmed that they provide paid leave to salaried employees, but not to hourly employees. The Business Case For Paid Leave \nAn earlier study by the Center for Economic and Policy Research found that 89% of business owners in California reported either positive or no negative effects on productivity after the state guaranteed six weeks of paid time off for new mothers. Furthermore, 93% agreed it had a positive or no negative impact on turnover, and 99% said the same about employee morale. At the same time, parental leave policies can help level the playing field for new moms and dads, and allow employees to return to work less stressed out and better rested, which ultimately works in the employer's favor. \n\"The several months it would take to find a replacement, along with the cost of manpower to recruit and interview, heavily outweighs the cost of providing this benefit,\" ZestFinance's chief people officer, Sonya Merrill, told Fast Company earlier this year, shortly after the company extended its paid parental leave policy to six months. \nThe U.S. and Papua New Guinea currently remain the only industrialized nations in the world that don't offer guaranteed paid leave of any kind, which was a key talking point for candidates of both major parties during the presidential election. President-elect Donald Trump proposed a policy that would offer six weeks of paid maternity leave to new mothers whose employers do not provide coverage, but some experts have suggested it will be up to employers to set the social policy standards in this deeply divided political landscape. \n\"What's likely to happen in 2017, as more and more companies go down that path of setting what that standard is, it will set a de facto social policy,\" Brian Kropp, the human resources practice leader for CEB, recently told Fast Company . Kropp explained that many have given up hope in the government stepping in to expand family leave policies nationwide, and are instead looking to private companies to take the matter into their own hands. \"That will have a bigger impact on social policy than what government can accomplish in a dysfunctional Washington,\" he said. \nBut with a majority of the U.S.'s top employers offering no leave, unbalanced policies, or refusing to disclose their family leave policies publicly, it's difficult to remain hopeful that the private sector will move any quicker on the issue.

      "text": "Netflix 'A Series Of Unfortunate Events' New Trailer: Neil Patrick Harris Hints Teaser Drop, Daniel Handler Releases Cast Photos By Amanda Moore ,   16, 05:00 am Neil Patrick Harris is Count Olaf in \"A Series of Unfortunate Events\" on Netflix.(Photo : Netflix US & Canada/YouTube) \nNetflix subscribers looking forward to \"A Series of Unfortunate Events\" are in for a treat this week as Neil Patrick Harris has hinted of a new teaser drop this Thursday, Nov. 17. Author Daniel Handler, who also serves as executive producer of the television series, teased fans with a handful cast photos as well. Advertisement \nOn his Twitter , Neil Patrick Harris, who plays Count Olaf on the show, has been sharing photos of his character's many disguises on \"A Series of Unfortunate Events.\" As of press time, he has shared the looks of Captain Sham from the story's third book \"The Wide Window\" and Stefano from the second book \"The Reptile Room.\" \nNeil Patrick Harris also said that he's anticipating the release of a new trailer for \"A Series of Unfortunate Events\" on Thursday. So far, Netflix has already unleashed fan excitement for the show by showing two teasers within the last couple of months. I'm giving you sneaks peeks all week counting down to the @Unfortunate trailer release on Thursday. Prepare to swoon: Here's Captain Sham. pic.twitter.com/SNvyzb1sFW — Neil Patrick Harris (@ActuallyNPH) November 14, 2016 My @Unfortunate sneak peeks continue in anticipation of Thursday's new trailer. Revel in my rakish Reptile Room ruse - I present... Stefano: pic.twitter.com/nsrX41K4TZ — Neil Patrick Harris (@ActuallyNPH) November 15, 2016 \nMeanwhile, book series author and the real Lemony Snicket, Daniel Handler, also released a bunch of photos of the different characters on \"A Series of Unfortunate Events.\" On his Twitter , he posted photos of Catherine O' Hara as Dr. Georgina Orwell and Joan Cusack as Justice Strauss. He also asked fans to guess the roles of Don Johnson and Aasif Mandi in another Twitter post . \nJoan Cusack is Count Olaf's neighbor who will be introduced to the Baudelaire orphans in the beginning of \"A Series of Unfortunate Events.\" On the other hand, Catherine O'Hara's character is part of the fourth book, \"The Miserable Mill,\" who hypnotizes the children upon Olaf's request. \nAccording to Entertainment Weekly , O'Hara actually played Justice Strauss in the 2004 ASOUE movie adaptation with Jim Carrey. As for the other mysterious roles teased by Handler for \"A Series of Unfortunate Events,\" fans are guessing that Don Johnson will play Sir from the Lucky Smell Lumbermill and Aasaf Mandi will play Uncle Monty, the orphans' other guardian. \nSlash Film notes that because of these photo releases, there's a good chance these are the characters whom fans will see in the new trailer for \"A Series of Unfortunate Events\" on Thursday.

      "text": "I have things to do that are more important to me than Netflix. Photo credit: slgckgc , CC BY 2.0. If there’s anything Americans can agree on right now, it’s that we want social change. Well, there’s probably a fraction of people who are so privileged that they couldn’t care less, but most of us are looking for transformation in some form or another. I am a queer, Black woman, so you can probably guess what type of change I want. (Hint: it involves treating marginalized people with respect and as valuable human beings.)\nThe movements I support have been in the works for decades, even centuries. Some days it feels like we’ll never prosper. Other days it feels like, with a little more time, we’ll finally cross the threshold. On the evening of November 8, however, it felt like any chance of progress had been smashed. On November 9, I could only mourn. I was a teary mess and sent defeatist texts to my family and friends when they tried to help me feel better. I didn’t accomplish anything except eating an entire frozen pizza from Trader Joe’s. On November 10, however, I woke up angry. No more tears. I was a hot poker. Underneath all that anger, I felt something else stirring. Hope. Is it too soon for that?\nThat was an important day for me because my despair had morphed into a renewed resolve to fix what was wrong. Something had to change in America, and I was determined to help. I started by making some changes of my own.\nNetflix The first change was getting rid of Netflix. Cutting streaming services when you feel finances are tight isn’t anything new. And yes, my finances are tight. I’m already pretty frugal, so there’s not much else I can cut out from my budget. But that’s not the only reason I cut Netflix.\nI cut Netflix because it’s a distraction. I think it will take big ideas to make a social change, and those ideas will require an investment of time. I can’t use up all that time watching Netflix.\nI don’t really have anything against Netflix. It’s just that right now I have things to do that are more important to me than Netflix, such as getting through my reading list of books about understanding and changing society. In the future, if I want to watch a movie, I’ll borrow it from my local library. They’re more likely to have what I want to watch anyway. I keep checking for Lost in Translation because it reminds me of how I felt when I first moved to Japan for a study abroad program. But Netflix hasn’t had Lost in Translation since June 2014. My library has it on DVD for free, and it’s available right now. Y’all, I love my local library. Cutting Netflix will also encourage me to show my library more support.\nShould there be a moment when I just really need to tune into something and don’t have time to go to the library, I can watch a show on Amazon Prime, which I use to save on shipping, or rent a movie for $3.99, which is still cheaper than Netflix.\nUber I don’t own a car. I spend $78 on a St. Louis metro pass every month for unlimited access to the bus and MetroLink. I actually really like public transit and wish it were as strong in more cities as it is in New York City, DC, and San Francisco. Public transit in St. Louis is lacking, so I use Uber to get to places that are transit-inaccessible or would take much longer to travel to via transit. Over the past five months, I’ve spent $553.71 on Uber rides.\nI’ve been avoiding Uber lately. Unfortunately, this change is less empowering than getting rid of Netflix, because it is a change rooted in fear. I was already taking risks by using Uber. In March, a Kalamazoo Uber driver went on a shooting spree. There are cases of Uber drivers assaulting female passengers. Uber still has the same race discrimination problem that taxis do, just in a digital form. All these risks are now compounded by the fact that the recent election results have emboldened many racist, sexist, and violent people.\nStudy Finds Racial Discrimination by Uber and Lyft Drivers \nSo I don’t feel safe taking Uber anymore. Not when my visible identities make me a target. I plan to avoid Uber as much as possible. If Uber is unavoidable, I will use the “share trip details” feature to let family members know where I am.\nIncome This isn’t just about not spending money. I need to be earning money too. If we have no money, we have no power. But the ways in which I choose to earn that money have changed.\nDiverse representation has always been something I’ve championed, but I think now we especially need art/writing/products produced by marginalized people in the forefront. And I really mean the forefront. Put the spotlight on the people who have been made invisible, because not everybody will search for them otherwise. It’s time for me to start supporting these communities in meaningful ways. That’s why I’ve decided that 7 percent of what I earn from people supporting me as an artist will go into a Support The Others fund. I will use this fund to buy from or financially support LGBT/POC writers, artists, and entrepreneurs.\nI’m doing 7 percent because I need to be saving up money to be less poor, but maybe someday I’ll be able to increase that amount. Maybe someday I’ll have lots of money and will be able to throw large fistfuls of it at LGBT/POC artists. For now, 7 percent.\nI’m really excited about this for several reasons:\nI get to take action! I get to support people who don’t receive the recognition they deserve! There are a lot of cool people making cool stuff, and I get to treat myself to it. This forces me to focus on my own creativity. I’m not allowed to use day job money for this. If I don’t earn money as an artist, I can’t add money to the fund, which means I’m not supporting other artists and businesses the way I want to. In the past few days alone I’ve seen so many people rally together to help improve the lives of others. I’m hoping we can keep this up. I’m hoping that things do get better.\nDera Luce is a writer and Japanese translator living in St. Louis.

No topic is too controversial for the comedian who gets political in the first trailer for the comedy event. \n“There's a lot of tension in this country and it needs to be addressed. Let's do it right now,” Che says at the top of the clip. “Blacks and cops aren't getting along – I don't know if you've seen the news in the last 400 years.” He goes on to share his doubts about the state of the economy saying, “They're starting to legalize marijuana everywhere. It's only when you get down to your last dollar that you start thinking, 'Yo, we should start selling weed.'” Guns, freedom of speech, Donald Trump, white girls, Hitler and Black Lives Matter are among the other topics that Che addresses during the show, which was filmed live at the Greenpoint Terminal Warehouse in Brooklyn. \nChe's touring schedule is currently open, as he is busy working on “Saturday Night Live,” where he has served as co-anchor of “Weekend Update” since 2014. In the past, he has headlined comedy shows all over the world and performed at such notable events as the Oddball Comedy and Curiosity Festival Tour, Bonnaroo Music Festival, The Moontower Comedy Festival, The Melbourne International Comedy Festival and many more. He is currently based in New York City where he picks up sets at local – and legendary – comedy clubs. \nPrior to becoming a fixture on “Saturday Night Live,” Che worked as a correspondent on Comedy Central's Emmy Award-winning series “The Daily Show with Jon Stewart.” He also became the first-ever stand-up comedian to perform on “Late Night with Seth Meyers” in 2014. Other hilarious shows on which Che has appeared include “The Late Show with David Letterman,” “Jeff Ross Presents Roast Battle,” “Gotham Comedy Live” and many more. He also filmed his first stand-up special in conjunction with Comedy Central's “The Half-Hour” series. \nChe has an impressive filmography, as well. “Top Five” and “Lyle” are among the popular movies in which he has appeared. \nCheck out the trailer for “Michael Che Matters” above and head over to MichaelChe.com to stay up-to-date on the comedian's tour dates and appearances.

      "text": "Tweet Is Lucifer on Netflix? - Picture Copyright FOX \nOne of Fox’s biggest shows on air at the moment is the series Lucifer. The comedy drama that airs each Monday, the first season was met with critical success which led to be renewed for a supersized second season and that looks set to continue into the future. So our question and probably yours to, is Lucifer streaming on Netflix? Let’s take a look. \nTom Ellis who stars as Lucifer Morningstar, a supernatural demon who goes into business with the Los Angeles Police Department as he has several abilitiese such as telling peoples hidden desires and other super powers such as strength, speed and invulnerability. \nSeason 2 which was renewed for a bumper season upping the episodes from 13 to 22 sees our unlikely hero hunting down his mom who escaped hell. \nAs you may have already worked out, Lucifer is not streaming on Netflix US and actually, that goes the same for every region of Netflix in the world. That’s odd considering Netflix does have a good relationship with FOX with regards to its animated sitcoms in particular but let’s have a look as to why in a few key regions. \nFor the US, FOX has chosen to use its own streaming service and Hulu (for which it part owns) to host the show exclusively. This will be a continuing trend unless Netflix puts in a bid to buy out the show exclusively. \nFor the United Kingdom, Sky has bought out exclusivity for the show meaning you’ll only be able to stream if you have a NowTV subscription. \nAs for other regions, Netflix clearly doesn’t have any intention of getting it there either as most first seasons of the show are added to Netflix just a few days before the next season begins to drum up anticipation and new viewers. \nAre you sad that Netflix has chosen not to get the license for Lucifer?

      "text": "Comment Teaser image for Netflix's ''Longmire'' series. YouTube / Netflix U.S. & Canada \nFans, rejoice! Netflix has just announced its renewal of Longmire, a crime-drama series that's been running its Season 5 since September 23 of this year. While fans are happy, many critics find the launch of the next season too soon given that Longmire stands poorly compared to other Netflix series such as the highly acclaimed Narcos , featuring Colombia's infamous Pablo Escobar. \nLongmire Season 6 will start airing from March 2017. Contrary to its Seasons 1 through 5 shot in Northern New Mexico, the 10 episodes of Season 6 will be filmed in Santa Fe, Pecos, Los Alamos, and Las Vegas. As Executive Producers Hunt Baldwin, John Coveny and Greer Shephard say in a press release , \"We are grateful to Netflix for the opportunity to compose a closing chapter for these beloved characters that inspire lasting memories.\" \nJust last month, Longmire's public relations team took their engagement to social media where they encouraged fans to \"post, share, tweet, and retweet about Longmire Season 6.\" Fans were asked to use the hashtag \"#LongmireS6\" and the tag \"@Netflix\", when making a post about their thoughts of the series. The online event was formally launched on October 30 at 9 p.m. (EST) and ran for one hour. \nThe press team sent out this invitation on Twitter : \nJoin the Stampede Sunday night @ 9ET/6PT. Why do you want to see #Longmire S6 on @netflix ? Please retweet! @LouDPhillips @kateesackhoff pic.twitter.com/Va8HglyzFY \n- Longmire Posse (@LongmirePosse) \nWhile Season 6 is on its way this spring, cast spin-offs, if any, haven't been confirmed just yet. Many have expressed that they would want to see the same cast , with Robert Taylor as Walt Longmire, Katee Sackhoff as Vic Moretti, and Lou Diamond Phillips as Henry Standing Bear. \nSome speculate that this early announcement of renewal appears odd, given that Netflix is known to make only two shows a year. And given that Longmire is not on top of Netflix charts, some believe that these stories are part of the plan to give out an impression of \"false excitement and attention.\" \nNot too long ago, Longmire, which was then being aired on the A&E Network from 2012, was rejected for renewal by 2014. It was at this stage that Netflix took the role of airing the series from then on. It is then not surprising for a similar renewal backlash to happen. \nFor now, viewers can enjoy all 53 episodes from Longmire Seasons 1 to 5 available for streaming on Netflix. ",

      "text": "share Netflix On November 25, just after midnight on the West Coast, Netflix will release all four episodes of Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life , the highly anticipated revival of the WB series Gilmore Girls , which ran from 2000 to 2007. A Year in the Life consists of four 90-minute episodes, each covering a single season, beginning with “Winter” and ending with “Fall.” It’s helmed by Amy Sherman-Palladino , who created the show and ran the first six seasons of the seven-season broadcast run. To whet your appetite, we’re offering you a few tidbits about what you can expect from the revival. We can’t tell you anything major, like The Final Four Words, but we have five minor spoilers for you below. Stop reading now if you want to go into the revival completely cold. We’ll publish a full review of Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life closer to the release date. 1. Amy Sherman-Palladino is retconning away that bar from season 7 Gilmore Girls obsessives will recall that in season seven — the only season not run by Amy Sherman-Palladino — Stars Hollow suddenly acquired a bar called K.C.’s. It’s where Jackson and Christopher went to “bond,” and where Lorelai sang “I Will Always Love You” to Luke on karaoke night. K.C.’s was functional, but it lacked the aggressive quirk of the rest of Stars Hollow: It’s a pretty standard, generic bar, without a single colorful character to its name. Sherman-Palladino is having none of this colorless lack of quirk. In A Year in the Life , we learn that there is only one bar in all of Stars Hollow, and it’s definitely not K.C.’s. It’s called The Secret Bar, and it has, to quote Babette, color coming out of its yin-yang. 2. Luke and Lorelai are not engaged as the show opens One of the burning questions fans had after the end of the broadcast series was, of course, what happened to Luke and Lorelai. They were engaged all of the sixth season but never made it to the altar, and after they spent season seven estranged and barely talking, all the finale had to offer as hope for the future was a single, ambiguous kiss. So Luke and Lorelai shippers breathed a sigh of relief back in April, when Entertainment Weekly reported that Luke and Lorelai are engaged but not yet married . But in the first episode, “Winter,” Luke and Lorelai are happily committed to one another, living together, but not married or engaged — a state of affairs on which Emily Gilmore, as always, has strong opinions. 3. The first episode begins four months after Richard’s death The brilliant Edward Herrmann passed away in 2014 , so it’s always been clear that Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life would have to find some way to deal with Richard Gilmore’s absence. Just howit planned to do so wasn’t quite so clear, but now we know that as “Winter” begins, Richard has been dead for four months, and our main characters are beginning to emerge from the first stages of their grief. That doesn’t mean we don’t see Richard’s funeral, though. It’s shown in flashbacks. And speaking of those flashbacks… 4. The pacing is very different Gilmore Girls has always had a flexible relationship with time. There are a lot of weeks with multiple Friday nights so that Rory and Lorelai can have multiple Friday night dinners with Emily and Richard; the timeline of Rory and Lorelai’s life before the show begins skitters wildly around so that in some episodes they’ve lived in Stars Hollow since Rory was 6 and in some since she was 12. Time follows story beats on Gilmore Girls , not the other way around, and it’s no surprise that A Year in the Life follows suit. But A Year in the Life handles the pacing very differently than the show did in its broadcast run. Instead of covering a few weeks in 45 minutes, every episode of A Year in the Life covers three months in 90 minutes, so it has to develop an entirely new vocabulary for how to express the passage of time and how to keep character beats on track. So we get flashbacks, which is a convention that the show only tried its hand at once over the course of the broadcast run; we skip whole weeks at a time and cover other weeks in minute detail. The effect is jarring — it’s just not the way Gilmore Girls usually feels — but not necessarily unpleasant. 5. That Netflix money shows onscreen Netflix reportedly spent $6 billion on original productions in 2016 , and boy can you see it on A Year in the Life . The video is of higher quality than it ever was. The tiny little WB backlot that serves as Stars Hollow has never looked so well-dressed. The soundtrack features expensive and iconic music. And there are multiple enormous production numbers that show off showrunner Amy Sherman-Palladino’s theatrical roots, with elaborate lighting, costuming, and choreography. If you ever thought Gilmore Girls really needed a few more dance numbers, A Year in the Life has you covered. Was this article helpful?",

      "text": "MORE >> \nSure, Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life won’t be available on Netflix for another week or so, but while you wait, you can check out what the experts are saying about the new four-part revival! \nLike fellow revival Fuller House , the forthcoming return to Star’s Hollow looks like it intends to give fans more of what they love; in Gilmore ’s case, that’s witty dialogue, the charms of small-town life, and loads of romance! \n“It benefits from having been gone long enough for many of us to miss it. And it returns, in all its dreamy, slightly loopy, generally optimistic lightness, at a time when many of us could use an escape, and TV could undoubtedly use a break from the grim, violent, conspiracy-laden dramas that currently dominate the landscape.” \n-Robert Bianco [ USA Today ] \n“Breathe a sigh of relief: The Gilmore Girls we knew and loved is back, and at its best, it’s the equivalent of a platter of powdered donuts and extra-crispy french fries. Maybe it’s a little too much at times — and rapid consumption of the four 90-minute episodes Netflix commissioned is not advised — but when it relies on the notable strengths of its core ensemble, it is television at its most warm and reassuring.”",

      "text": "in Thirst Trap \nWhen scrolling through Netflix on your weekly (or daily) movie night, it can be difficult to choose which film to watch. With so many options, how could one possibly decide? \nWell, fortunately, I have some humble film suggestions which will definitely satisfy you in more ways than one. And by that I mean: they prominently feature some serious man meat. After all, if you’re going to watch a movie, you might as well watch something that has a few thirst traps, right? \nHere is a brief compendium of just a few movies where an attractive male bulge is featured on camera — and a few of them definitely haven’t been formatted to fit your screen (* wink wink *). \nAnd no, before you get all indignant, Jon Hamm is not on this list because Mad Men ISN’T CONSIDERED A MOVIE, OKAY? 16. Tom Cruise in Magnolia. \nI have no idea if this is real or not, but if it is, then I have severely underestimated Tom Cruise. 15. Henry Cavill in every Superman movie. \nThey tried to make Cavill’s bulge less pronounced on screen, but certain angles just couldn’t hide what was going on downstairs. 14. Matt Bomer in Magic Mike. \nI mean, yeah. He’s wearing a thong. What more can you possibly say? 13. Actually, all of the guys in Magic Mike . \nYou’re doing the Lord’s work here, boys. 12. David Bowie in Labyrinth . \nLet’s be real, these tights were borderline obscene. 11. Ryan Gosling in Blue Valentine . \nHm, that isn’t a bulge — OH HOLY SHIT, YES IT IS. 10. Jamie Foxx in Django Unchained . \nWho knew pantaloons were so * ahem * clingy? 9. Daniel Craig in Casino Royale . \nGratuitous and soaking wet. Check and check. 8. Jake Gyllenhaal in Love & Other Drugs . \nThere’s like … some real definition happening here. 7. Chris Evans in What’s Your Number? \nWHOA. I had no idea Captain America was such a deviant. 6. Mark Wahlberg in Boogie Nights . \nIt certainly doesn’t compare to the shot of his “actual” (read: fake) schlong, but this is really Marky Mark in his element. 5. Michael Fassbender in Shame . \nWatch the entire movie if you want to check out what that bulge actually looks like (trust me, you do). 4. Ryan Gosling in The Place Beyond The Pines . \nFair warning: this is from a deleted scene. Yet another reason to spring for the DVD with extra features. 3. Zac Efron in Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates. \nThat singlet leaves precisely zero to the imagination. 2. … And also, Zac Efron in The Paper Boy . \nAll Zac does in this movie is walk around half-naked. It’s great. 1. Oh, and Zac Efron in Neighbors , too. \nOkay, Zac flashes some bulge in pretty much any movie that he’s in. He is clearly the successor to Jon Hamm’s Bulge Throne (which sounds grosser than it is). \nAnd if you’re at the end of this list and find yourself wanting more, never fear — this is simpy Part I in the Bulge Series.",

      "text": "Email \nWhen The CW announced its winter and spring premieres Wednesday, it also noted that first-year series “Frequency” and “No Tomorrow” wouldn’t be going beyond their initial 13-episode orders. \nThe network didn’t come right out and say that, of course. It only noted that the two shows would have their season finales in January (the 17th for “No Tomorrow” and the 25th for “Frequency”). Both shows have underperformed in the ratings vs. their respective time periods last season, so ending after 13 isn’t a surprise for either one. \nNormally, this kind of non-announcement would be a death knell for a show — and that may end up being the case for “Frequency” and “No Tomorrow” as well. Both shows are averaging just a 0.3 rating in adults 18-49, and they don’t get much of a lift with delayed viewing either (“Frequency” rises to a 0.5 after three days of DVR and on-demand catchup, “No Tomorrow to a 0.4). \nThere’s a new-era wrinkle to the story of The CW shows, however — and to a degree “Crazy Ex-Girlfriend” as well, as it’s ending in early February. As part of a new-ish streaming deal with Netflix , full seasons of CW shows will be available just eight days after their season finales. No more waiting until after the full TV season has ended. \nNetflix doesn’t share streaming data publicly, but presumably it does with partners to whom it’s paying hundreds of millions of dollars for their content. That means The CW will have a good three months to see whether people discover “Frequency” or “No Tomorrow” or “Crazy Ex-Girlfriend” (whose first season is already on the service) on Netflix and whether, based on that, new seasons for any of them in 2017-18 make sense.

      "text": "Netflix, working with Havas Singapore, launched a large-scale outdoor and ambient campaign, for the month of November, to promote The Crown, a television drama series. The showcases the story of Buckingham Palace and 10 Downing Street, and offers an intimate look at the personal history of Queen Elizabeth, while documenting her rise to the throne.\nThe key insight behind the campaign was whilst the Queen is one of the most famous people in the world, the audience knows very little about her. Therefore, adopting an unconventional media approach, the campaign has been built around uncommon knowledge about the Queen at a variety of touch points spread across Singapore.\nFeaturing more than 30 customised ambient and outdoor executions, the locations ranged from bus shelters and taxi stands, to supermarket shelves, bar tops, home furnishing stores, elevator doors, post boxes, hawker stalls, and even a parade of corgis down Orchard road.\n“After a fair bit of digging, we uncovered a wide variety of insights about the real Elizabeth and what makes her tick,” said Andrew Hook, group ECD at Havas Singapore. “From the fact she was a mechanic in the war before being crowned, to the story of her paying for her wedding dress with ration coupons. These insights build together to create a rich, fascinating portrait of her life and character.”\nMoreover, in a special collaboration with Robinsons Orchard at The Heeren, a street window display showcases actual costumes from the show, including the wedding outfits from Princess Elizabeth and Prince Philip, alongside other signature pieces peppered throughout the store.\n ",

      "text": "MISHICOT, Wis. (WBAY) — After Netflix’s ‘Making a Murderer’ threw Manitowoc County into the national spotlight, another documentary series is hoping to attract the same attention detailing a different case that involves a convicted serial killer.\nChillers Bar in Mishicot was just a pit-stop for a Los Angeles based film crew in the process of filming a docu-series called “It Was Him: The Many Murders of Ed Edwards.”\n“It’s essentially about us traveling around to look into some various crimes that may have been committed by my grandfather,” said Wayne Wolfe, the grandson of Ed Edwards.\nWolfe said his grandfather was a convicted serial killer that was only discovered in the last few years.\n“He died in prison, waiting death row, for the crimes he was charged for,” said Wolfe.\nIn the docu-series press release , it said Edwards was convicted of five grisly murders over a 20 year period, all involving kidnapping, shootings, stabbings and torture, but some believe he may have been linked to even more murders.\n“With the help of retired police detective John Cameron, we are traveling around looking into potential connections to some pretty prolific crimes in our country,” said Wolfe.\nIn the release, it said Cameron has evidence that could link Edwards to other murders, including the Zodiac Killer, Laci Peterson and many more.\nAnd when asked if they stopped in Mishicot Wednesday night because of the documentary “Making a Murder,” which details the murder trial of Steven Avery and his nephew Brendan Dassey, he said he couldn’t get into specifics.\n“I can’t comment on any specifics of one case but that is what we are doing here, we are looking for truthful answers and we are trying to find answers for anyone who could be affected by it, as well as, my own father,” said Wolfe.\nWolfe said they have been on the road for the past couple of months filming the documentary and they don’t have an air date yet. However, he did say it would air sometime next year on Spike T.V.\nIf you would like to know more about Edwards, visit coldcasecameron.com .",

      "text": "According to a new report from The Information , Apple over the last few months held talks with Chris Rock’s management team about bringing exclusive new material from the famed comedian to the Apple ecosystem. The negotiations ultimately fell through, with Netflix ultimately swooping in and signing Rock to a record-setting deal worth $40 million for two new specials.\nDON’T MISS: Walmart will give you a chance to buy the NES Classic every day this week\nAccording to the report, Apple is wary of getting into bidding wars with companies like Netflix, Hulu and Amazon over original content. Instead, Apple has curiously signaled its intention to sign off on content that no one is really excited about. In addition to a reality show based on app development, Apple this past July also purchased the rights to James Corden’s “Carpool Karoke” bit from late-night TV.\nIn effect, Apple’s strategy in the TV space isn’t much of a strategy at all, and as we highlighted just a few weeks ago, Apple’s lack of vision and leadership in this area is dumbfounding and embarrassing.\nAll the while, Apple seems more than happy to strike deals for exclusive launch windows for movies, such as Michael Moore’s upcoming documentary Trumpland .\nApple got the right to offer “TrumpLand” on iTunes earlier than other online video services, in exchange for prominently promoting it on the iTunes homepage, according to a person involved in the discussions. Having Apple’s promotional commitment is significant enough to help get a movie financed, this person said.\nOne would think that Apple would have learned by now, given its experience with Apple Music, that exclusive launch windows for content that can eventually be found elsewhere falls far short of being a competitive advantage.\nReading that Apple contemplated inking a deal with Chris Rock before letting the deal slip through its fingers is disappointing. There are few names in the entertainment industry capable of bringing in an avalanche of eyeballs. Chris Rock is one of those names, and the fact that Apple, a company not hurting for cash, is wary of getting into a bidding war for A-level content is indicative of a company with no real direction in the TV space.\nTrending right now:\nSam’s Club full Black Friday 2016 ad leaked: Here are the best deals Best Buy just released an updated Black Friday ad: Here’s what’s new Massive Pokemon Go December update will reportedly bring Pokemon trading and PvP battles See the original version of this article on BGR.com",

      "text": "Can Netflix, Inc.’s Stock Surge Continue? (NFLX) Our metrics provide a mixed picture for NFLX stock heading into 2017 Nov 17, 2016, 9:45 am EST | By , Zacks Investment Research View All \nIt has been about a month since the last earnings report for Netflix, Inc. ( NFLX ). Shares have added about 13.61 % in the past month, easily outperforming the S&P 500 in that time frame. \nWill the recent positive trend continue leading up to their next earnings release, or is the stock due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let’s take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers. \nNetflix Gains on Solid Q3 Earnings, Subscriber Growth Netflix reported earnings of 12 cents per share in the quarter, well ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 6 cents per share. In the prior-year quarter, the company had reported earnings of 7 cents a share. Netflix’s total revenue rose 31.7% year over year to $2,290 million driven by higher revenues from both International and Domestic Streaming. Revenues also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2,280 million. International Streaming revenues (37.3% of revenues) soared 65.1% year over year to $853.5 million driven by an increase in paid members. Domestic Streaming revenues (57% of revenues) improved 22.6% from the year-ago quarter to about $1,304.3 million. However, DVD revenues (5.8% of revenues) declined 16% year over year to $132.4 million. Updated NFLX Subscriber Base Figures In the quarter, Netflix recorded 3.57 million new members, bringing the total to approximately 86.7 million subscribers across the globe (guided range was 85.5 million). Paid streaming members totaled 83.3 million, up from 66 million in the prior quarter. In the Domestic Streaming segment, Netflix’s subscriber base totaled 47.5 million, up from 47.1 million in the last quarter. Paid members increased to 46.5 million from 46 million in the last quarter. In the International Streaming segment, the company recorded 39.2 million members compared with 36.5 million in the prior quarter. Paid members were approximately 36.8 million, up from 33.9 million at the end of the last quarter. Consolidated contribution profit margin (revenues minus the cost of revenues and marketing cost) from the streaming business was 18.8% compared with 17.5% in the year-ago quarter. Operating income (for both streaming and DVD business) surged 43.2% year over year to $106 million. Operating margin increased 50 basis points to 4.7%. Net income was $52 million compared with $29 million in the year-ago quarter. A Look at NFLX’s Balance Sheet Cash used in operations in the quarter was $462 million compared with $196 million cash used in operations in the prior-year quarter. The company reported free cash outflow of $506 million. Netflix’s total streaming content obligations increased to $14.4 billion from $10.4 billion in the year-ago quarter. Netflix’s Outlook Looks Promising For the fourth quarter of 2016, management forecasts earnings of $0.13 per share and net income of $56 million. Domestic and international streaming revenues are expected to be $1.4 billion and $947 million, respectively. Total streaming revenues are expected to be $2.34 billion. Management expects to add 1.45 million subscribers in the domestic streaming segment and 3.75 million subscribers in the international segment. Domestic streaming contribution profit is expected to be $515 million. International streaming loss is expected to be $75 million due to higher marketing spend. Netflix estimates U.S. contribution margin to be around 36.9% in the quarter. Netflix forecasts operating income of $125 million for the quarter. How have NFLX estimates been moving since then?",

      "text": "Last year, Making a Murderer proved to be a massive - and massively surprising hit for Netflix.\nPart of the reason the documentary series' success was so unexpected was that never offered viewers a traditional hero to root for:\nVirtually nothing is revealed about murder victim Teresa Halbach, and the filmmakers are less focused on her than on the circumstances of her death.\nSteven Avery - even if innocent of the major crimes that have led to him spending most of his adult life behind bars - is admittedly a deeply troubled man prone to animal cruelty and fits of extreme rage.\nThe attorneys tasked with protecting Avery from what at times seemed to be an obvious frame-up were lauded for their efforts, but they ultimately failed to secure a not guilty verdict.\nThe series has spurred intense debates on social media with regard to who was responsible for Halbach's death and whether or not justice was served, but all viewers seem to watch Murderer without feeling profound sympathy for Avery's then-teenage nephew, Brendan Dassey.\nNow 27, Dassey has been serving a life sentence since 2007 after being convicted of aiding Avery in Halbach's murder.\nDassey was just .... when he was arrested and had been diagnosed with several moderate to severe intellectual impairments.\nMurderer featured footage in which investigators coerce a confession from Dassey, telling the teen that they won't be able to \"protect\" him unless he signs a statement accepting responsibility for Halbach's death.\nDassey clearly doesn't understand the implications of his confession, and maintains, even while signing the statement that he was in no way involved with the murder.\nBack in August a judge ordered that Dassey be released from prison after serving nearly a decade behind bars.\nAt the time, it was determined that prosecutors would have 90 days in order to decide if they wished to challenge the ruling and re-try the case.\nThe state of Wisonsin filed a motion to prevent Dassey's release earlier this week, but they were overruled by U.S. Magistrate William Duffin, who has ruled that Dassey is to be released by 8 pm on Friday night.\n\"In the motion to stay the respondent largely re-argues the same points already considered and rejected by the court in deciding Dassey’s motion for release,\" Duffin wrote in his decision.\n\"The court finds that reconsideration of these arguments yields the same conclusion. The respondent’s motion to stay is denied.\"\nView Slideshow: 19 Celebrities Who May Have Killed People Dassey's mother not stopped fighting for his release, and family insiders say she has been excitedly preparing his bedroom and planning his favorite meal for Friday evening.\nAs for Avery, he filed an appeal in January and will go to trial with a new attorney in the months to come.\nA second season of Making a Murderer featuring the many developments in the case is reportedly in the works.",

      "text": "The Gilmore Girls are finally back (Picture: Netflix) Finally, after nine long years, Gilmore Girls returns to our TV screens.\nThe show was a hit in the early 2000s and followed the trials and tribulations of a young mother and her daughter, and the small town they settle down in, Stars Hollow.\nGilmore Girls’ Lauren Graham and Alexis Bledel ‘shocked’ after discovering the show’s biggest secret It was a show made up of low stakes drama – and in a recent interview with Metro.co.uk, star Lauren Graham admitted that ‘one of the reasons we are here is because it doesn’t fit’ with the current TV mould, in fact, she suggests it ‘didn’t fit back then’.\nBut thank God it didn’t because it’s back – and we have all the information you need about the return of the show…\nWhen is it back on then? November 25, 2016.\nBook the day off work, cuddle up with a cup of coffee and a blanket, and settle in with the girls.\n\nWhat’s it going to be about? We’re catching up with the Gilmores’ nine years later and in that time a lot has changed.\nThe formidable Edward Hermann, who played the patriarch of the family Richard Gilmore, passed away in December 2014, and so within the show, his family are now having to deal with their loss – as well wife Emily and daugher Lorelai finally attempting to come to terms with their fractious relationships which have never improved over time.\nKelly Bishop is back as Emily (Picture: Netflix) Rory meanwhile is feeling lost as her career in journalism has yet to take off, and she finds herself listless, crashing on friend’s couches and travelling the world.\nHow many episodes are there? The revival is split into four 90-minute episodes, beginning with Winter, and moving through Spring, Summer, and Fall (following the lyrics from the theme song, Carole King’s Where You Lead.)\nBut is it any good? &&&&& To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video \nMetro.co.uk have seen the first two episodes and we can confirm that watching Gilmore Girls nine years on feels exactly like coming home.\nLauren and Alexis Bledel have fallen straight back into the show’s fast-paced dialogue, riffing off each other and making as many pop culture references as they possibly can in the shortest amount of time.\nStars Hollow’s best and brightest are also back (Picture: Netflix) Kelly Bishop returns as matriarch EmilyGilmore, and other familiar faces will include Scott Patterson (Luke), Keiko Agena (Lane), Liza Weil (Paris), Yanic Truesdale (Michel), Matt Czuchry (Logan), Milo Ventimiglia (Jess), and Sean Gunn (Kirk).\nThere are also a ton of cameos – some already known and some that will remain secret.\n&&&&& To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video \nIs it too late to watch the first seven seasons? No, as long as you have five days in the next eight days free and don’t plan on sleeping or leaving the sofa.\nThere are seven seasons, with the first one made up of 21 episodes and the following six made up of 22.\n\nAt 42 minutes an episode, that’s 6,426 minutes, which breaks down into just over four and a half days.\nGood luck.\nHow can I watch it? The show will drop on Netflix at 7.01am UK time on Friday November 25.\nYou can sign up for Netflix here – and you have your first month free.\nMORE: Netflix’s leading women wrote moving letters to their younger selves \nMORE: Here’s how you can find out what the very first thing you ever watched on Netflix was ",

The lineup includes “The Mack,” “Foxy Brown,” “Shaft,” “Super Fly,” “Dolemite,” “Cotton Comes to Harlem,” “Uptown Saturday Night,” “Cooley High,” “Three The Hard Way,” “Coffy,” “Black Caesar,” “Five on the Black Hand Side,” “Cleopatra Jones,” “Mandingo,” “Willie Dynamite,” “Which Way is Up?”, “Car Wash” and “The Original Gangstas.” \nBrown Sugar is available for smartphones and tablets in Apple’s iTunes App Store and the Google Play Store and on the web at brownsugar.com . The service offers a one-month free trial period for subscribers with a retail price of $3.99 per month thereafter. \nBrown Sugar groups films into themed collections such as War in Harlem (“Cotton Comes to Harlem,” “The Black Godfather,” “Across 110th Street”), Foxy Mamas (“Foxy Brown,” “Coffy,” “Cleopatra Jones,” “Friday Foster,” “Sheba Baby”), Righteous Revenge (“Dolemite,” “Black Caesar,” “Hell Up in Harlem,” “Hammer”), Stickin’ it to The Man (“The Mack,” “Black Gunn,” “Three the Hard Way”) and Jive-Ass Turkeys (“I’m Gonna Git You Sucka,” “Car Wash,” “Uptown Saturday Night”).

I’ve always just been an against-the-grain type of dude, what can I say? Anyway, these books are fire. It’s like a mystery-thriller for children. What I remember about these books, maybe more than any other book I’ve read in my life, is how easily I was able to visual the world. Lemony Snicket did a remarkable job of painting a distinctly vidid picture of the hell of a world that the Baudelaire children were living in.\nAnd let’s just talk about the casting for a second. Neil Patrick Harris is a homerun. This dude’s is one of the best at playing against type. I mean, as a gay man, he played the world’s biggest bro for like a decade and crushed it. I can’t wait to see what his does with a creep crusty piece of shit like Count Olaf.\n\nWATCH: A Series Of Unfortunate Events Netflix Teaser Fun fact: there are 13 books in A Series Of Unfortunate Events, and this guy CLICK HERE TO READ MORE → ",

Bill Bradley Entertainment Editor \nIn an unfortunate event in 2015, a supposedly fake teaser for Netflix’s new “Lemony Snicket” series went viral. Well, your fortunes have changed. \nThe Baudelaire children are back in the new, official, real trailer for “ Lemony Snicket’s A Series of Unfortunate Events .” Count Olaf, played by Neil Patrick Harris, is back, too, and he’s more slimy than ever. (Olaf is the conniving troublemaker after the Baudelaires’ inheritance.) \nBased on the video, the eight-episode series looks to capture the same beats from the books and the 2004 Jim Carrey movie. Despite that, or possibly because of it, Netflix posted the trailer with a message warning viewers not to watch when the series drops on Friday, Jan. 13: \nDear Viewer,The world is vast and full of wonders. So on Friday, the 13th of January, please ... watch something else. \nAfter all the anticipation, if fans do refrain from viewing, that’d be truly unfortunate.

Our role in S.T.E.A.M needs to be bigger. We don’t do that to diminish the role of men, but it’s important for us to embrace women. We can still keep that femininity and wear four-inch heels going to work. I like how diverse we are. There’s not just one type of beauty — beauty comes in all shapes, colors, sizes. That’s what makes our world beautiful, because of the diversity in it.”\nThe show’s third season, which premiered on Oct. 14, encourages a new generation of girls to continue to explore, dream, create and, most importantly, be their true selves.",

      "title": "What Gilmore Girls' Critics Are Saying About The Netflix Show",
      "text": "By jessica rawden 31 minutes ago \nNetflix has had a variety of new series hit the schedule in the last year. Some of the have satisfied critically, but some of them have not . With Gilmore Girls: A Year In The Life set to hit the schedule next week, we've taken a look at what the early critic reviews are saying about the 4-part series, which will bring Lorelei, Rory and all of Stars Hollow together one more time. It should be noted that each of these four parts will last 90 minutes, so they are more like movies than a standard season of television. But like Sherlock before it, the Gilmore Girls revival will be viewed as a series than as standalone parts that make up a whole. \nSo what did they think? You can check out a sampling, below. \nTo begin, a lot of people who have caught the Gilmore Girls revival have been lucky enough to like it at least to some degree. There are a lot of reviews out there talking about how the nostalgia factor mostly works. Jeff Jensen's review in EW was pretty positive and provided an emotional argument for the series. I like to imagine this review being spoken very quickly, much like the Gilmore gals themselves . He noted: \nIt provides a welcome dose of hilarious and humane escapism that satisfies like a nostalgia trip even while subverting it. It tells a story about grief and change, rootlessness and restlessness. The show is basically a reboot about the struggle of rebooting. \nUproxx 's Alan Sepinwall seems to praise the \"self-awareness\" of the show and is happy the Netflix series is a project that exists, but he clearly has some problems with some of the other things that Gilmore Girls is trying to do: \nBecause of that fundamental shift in the dynamic, because the Palladinos are trying to squeeze nearly every significant Gilmore character --- not to mention exposition about what they've been up to since we last saw them --- into four double-sized episodes that each cover an entire season of the calendar, and because TV reunions almost always feel out of sync from the shows that spawned them, it's not a surprise that A Year in the Life is frequently a mess. \nOverall, critical reception for Gilmore Girls: A Year In The Life has overwhelmingly been positive---it's running at 100% positive on Rotten Tomatoes with only a few reviews up, but even within the good reviews there are things that are turning the critics off. Vulture 's Jen Chaney mostly likes the series, but does have some clear ideas about what she doesn't enjoy in the revival. \nBut even mother and daughter, at times, come across as more judgmental and petty than they did before. (They make some unnecessary fat jokes, for example, that should be beneath their characters.) \nYou can tune in and decide if Gilmore Girls is one for the TV ages or if it's a total wreck when A Year in the Life hits the schedule on Friday, November 25 at 12:01 a.m. PT. To find out what else the subscription streaming service has coming up on its schedule, check out our Netflix TV premiere schedule . And as a lot of these reviews also noted, a lot of characters are making a comeback from the original series.

      "text": "Jeff Spry  35pm \nCompeting with Fantastic Beasts and Where To Find Them and Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculair Children in the lengthy fantasy title department, here comes a new extended trailer for the Netflix original series based on the beloved Daniel Handler books, Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunte Events. In this outrageous TV outing, Neil Patrick Harris replaces Jim Carrey's feature film version of the diabolical Count Olaf, and regardless of your feelings for Harris's previous performances, the man does display some nimble comedic timing. \nHere's the official synopsis: Based on the internationally best-selling series of books by Lemony Snicket (aka Daniel Handler) and starring Emmy and Tony Award winner Neil Patrick Harris, Lemony Snicket’s A Series of Unfortunate Events recounts the tragic tale of the Baudelaire orphans — Violet, Klaus, and Sunny – whose evil guardian Count Olaf will stop at nothing to get his hands on their inheritance. The siblings must outsmart Olaf at every turn, foiling his many devious plans and disguises, in order to discover clues to their parents’ mysterious death. The eight-episode series is a Netflix original production, executive produced by Emmy Award winner Barry Sonnenfeld and Daniel Handler, and also stars Patrick Warburton, Joan Cusack, Malina Weissman and Louis Hynes. \nEnter into the demented domain of Count Olaf and tell us if this oddball series fits nicely on the ambitious streaming service's creative platter.

You are now subscribed Subscribe for the latest gaming news \nNetflix has released the first trailer for its take on A Series of Unfortunate Events . The eight-episode series is set to premiere on the streaming service on January 13. \nThe trailer gives us our first look at Neil Patrick Harris as Count Olaf in motion. The overall tone and aesthetic of the series looks very similar to the 2004 movie of the same name. However, Harris's character seems a lot more grounded than the version played by Jim Carrey. There are still plenty of jokes, though. You can watch the trailer below. \nThe show's synopsis is as follows: \" A Series of Unfortunate Events recounts the tragic tale of the Baudelaire orphans--Violet, Klaus, and Sunny--whose evil guardian Count Olaf will stop at nothing to get his hands on their inheritance. The siblings must outsmart Olaf at every turn, foiling his many devious plans and disguises, in order to discover clues to their parents' mysterious deaths.\" \nIn addition to Harris, A Series of Unfortunate Events stars Malina Weissman ( Supergirl ), Louis Hynes ( Barbarians Rising ), K. Todd Freeman ( The Dark Knight ), Aasif Mandvi ( The Proposal ), Joan Cusack ( Toy Story 3 ), and Patrick Warburton ( Family Guy ). The series is executive produced by Barry Sonnenfeld ( Men in Black ) and Daniel Handler, who wrote the Unfortunate Events books under the pseudonym Lemony Snicket. \nDid you enjoy this article?

      "text": "college Share this article \nI don’t know about you, but I am beyond excited for the Netflix revival of Gilmore Girls this November! It will be so great to see all of the classic characters reunited for a few episodes of nostalgic bliss. To get you in the mood for this event, you can find out which character would live in your dorm! \nSutherland Hall: Rory Gilmore \nWhere else would Rory be other than the honors dorm? This dorm would be perfect for her. Not only would she be among other studious students, she could meet student athletes, like Dean, who would be living just across the way in Sutherland East. Maybe Jess would even be living on her floor in Sutherland West and the rivalry would start freshman year. Also, she could use the spacious Sutherland rooms to store her copious book collection. \nTowers: Lorelai Gilmore \nLorelai would definitely be in the most well-known freshman dorms on Pitt’s campus. Her eclectic personality and ability to go with the flow would make her a perfect candidate for Towers. She would definitely be obsessed with the amount of food right at her fingertips. From late market runs, to the huge selection at Market to Go, Lorelai would be set. Also, there is a Starbucks right downstairs – enough said. \nHolland Hall: Lane Kim \nIf Lane was even allowed to go to Pitt, Ms. Kim would make sure she was in the all girls freshman dorm, Holland Hall. However, once at school, Lane would take every opportunity to join a band on campus and get involved. Holland’s close proximity to all of the main campus buildings would help her meet potential bandmates. \nNordenberg: Emily and Richard Gilmore \nEmily and Richard Gilmore would only stay in Nordenberg if they were at Pitt, since it is the newest and nicest dorm with the best amenities. The Gilmores would pay whatever it took to be in such a prime location. They would require special treatment with the promise that they would be excellent alumni and donate millions to the school and maybe even an astronomy building for their favorite granddaughter! Now that’s something to toast to. \nMcCormick: Sookie St. James \nAs a budding chef, Sookie would want to have access to a kitchen but still be able to go to market to work on the perfect stir fry combination. McCormick would be the ideal location with it’s apartment-style living and proximity to the events of campus. Sookie would also need to stay close to Student Health as because of her clumsiness in the kitchen. \nAmos: Kirk Gleason \nSo you might be asking yourself: Wait! Isn’t Amos only sorority suites? You’d be correct. Kirk, however, wouldn’t know this. He would sign up for housing way too late and would accidentally write down Kim instead of Kirk. So, somehow he would get placed in the Kappa Delta suite in Amos, and being Kirk, he’d make the best of it. After all, he has lived with his mother for all of his life and that counts for something, right? \nBouquet: Paris Geller \nAh, Paris… The normal rules of the housing lottery would not apply to her. Paris would do whatever it took to get Bouquet Gardens her junior year. She would make sure that she got the best option for upperclassman on-campus housing that Pitt has to offer. And, inevitably, she would make sure Rory got there as well (with the help of Richard and Emily, of course). Yes, Paris would find a way to work the system. \n\nAnd there you have it! Some classic Gilmore Girls to Pitt comparisons to get you through less than a month of waiting for the best revival ever.",

      "text": "November 17, 2016 2:15 pm Netflix \nOn the Burbank, California, set of Netflix’s Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life , the studio backlot has been transformed into the quaint Connecticut town of Stars Hollow. The fictional hamlet’s most notable residents, mother-daughter duo Lorelai and Rory Gilmore (Lauren Graham and Alexis Bledel), are decked out in bright swim gear for a scene at the municipal pool. But beneath the sunny surface, the vibe is anything but relaxed. \nIn an effort to keep pretty much every plot point under wraps until the November 25 premiere, the entire operation is cloaked in secrecy, rendering the cast members—renowned for their hypercaffeinated verbal volleys on camera—uncharacteristically mum. When asked about the gag order, creator Amy Sherman-Palladino is matter-of-fact. “We’ve worked very hard,” she says, “and we want the audience to experience this on the air, as it happens.” \nRELATED: Gilmore Girls : A Look at Rory Gilmore's Boyfriends and Why None of Them Are Right For Her \nBesides, just because you’re paranoid doesn’t mean they aren’t after you. Since news broke that the beloved dramedy, which aired on The WB and then The CW from 2000 to 2007, would return, the production has been tracked with breathless fervor. (Per Netflix tradition, the four 90-minute installments, dubbed “Winter,” “Spring,” “Summer” and “Fall,” will be released simultaneously.) Fans converged online to trumpet each new casting—yes, the core crew, including icy Gilmore matriarch Emily (Kelly Bishop), Lorelai’s cantankerous soulmate, Luke (Scott Patterson), and scores of townies, is back—and pore over behind-the-scenes pics on social media in search of potential spoilers. (An Instagram shot of a prop affixed with a “Wedding” label prompted in-depth speculation over which Girl may be tying the knot.) “We couldn’t have predicted the level of excitement,” Bledel admits. “It’s certainly wonderful, and it makes me feel confident in this decision.” Netflix “The scene where Lane sees Rory is very sweet,” says Agena (center, with Emily Kuroda and Bledel) \nGilmore Girls 2.0 has been a long time coming. Before the series’ final season, Sherman-Palladino and her husband, Daniel Palladino, stepped down as executive producers. Consensus was that the show’s life force left with them, and devotees felt robbed of closure. “Questions would come up about a reunion, but we never thought it would happen,” says Keiko Agena, reprising her role as Rory’s feisty BFF, Lane. In June 2015, Bledel, Graham and others gathered at the ATX Television Festival in Austin, setting off a tidal wave of nostalgia. By then, a suitable platform for crafting a proper send-off had presented itself. “The bottom line is that we needed a Netflix,” says Sherman-Palladino. “It ended up happening organically.” \nZero arm-twisting was required to get the actors on board. “We didn’t have to convince anybody,” says Palladino. “We wanted to include even more characters, but we were lucky to squeeze in the ones that we did.” After some uncertainty, even movie star Melissa McCarthy fit in an appearance as chef Sookie. “That took a minute to come together,” says Graham. “Had it not, I don’t think this would have been so complete and satisfying.” (A few newbies, such as Younger ’s Sutton Foster and Smash ’s Christian Borle, join the ranks.) \nAny lingering nerves vanished at the first table reading. “My heart was pounding. There was the emotion of seeing people again, plus wanting this to be what everybody was hoping for,” Graham says. “And then it just clicked.” Gilmore Girls ’ trademarks—like the densely packed monologues and wide-reaching pop-culture references—made that a given, Bledel says. “The show has such a specific sound and cadence and speed that as soon as you start saying the words, it’s like you never left.” \nWell, almost. “After nine years, everyone had a lot to catch up on,” Patterson notes. “Some of us, like me, have kids, and before we didn’t.” (Bledel, who’s married to Mad Men ’s Vincent Kartheiser, also became a parent.) “It was like a high school reunion,” says Yanic Truesdale, aka Michel, the eternally stroppy concierge at Lorelai’s Dragonfly Inn. “There’s a French word, febrile , that means a cross between excitement and nervousness, which I think sums up the feeling.” Netflix Bledel, Patterson, Bishop and Graham at a Gilmore family dinner. \nBut there is one glaring absence: Edward Herrmann, who portrayed patriarch Richard, died from brain cancer in 2014. His passing is felt keenly on screen and off. “We all miss Ed. He was such a big presence,” says Bledel. The first episode, “Winter,” features Richard’s memorial service and finds Rory, Lorelai and Emily struggling with their grief. “In some ways, this will bring them together, and in some ways, it will break them apart,” Graham says. “We’ll all be dealing with it differently, which speaks to the different stages women go through in terms of love, career and transitions.” \nRELATED: The Gilmore Girls: A Year In The Life Trailer Is Here, and It's Pretty Darn Glorious (VIDEO) \nWhen things pick up, business at the inn is booming, and Lorelai’s diner-owner squeeze Luke is still in the picture—for the moment. But late-fortysomething Lorelai has a case of arrested development that could spell trouble. “Let’s just say she will be facing issues in terms of her maturity,” says Graham. \nAt least she and her daughter have maintained their tight bond, though Rory has been far from the nest for some time. (In the series finale, the Yale grad set off to cover Barack Obama’s presidential campaign.) “Rory has been working as a journalist and traveling a lot,” says Bledel. “She’s living a wayward lifestyle, and coming back is going to be a fairly intense check-in for her.” Her year will no doubt involve romantic entanglements, and with her three significant exes—first love Dean (Jared Padalecki), rebel Jess (Milo Ventimiglia) and blue blood Logan (Matt Czuchry)—all in the mix, the possibilities are plentiful. \nWho Rory will or won’t wind up with is being guarded as closely as the mystery of the fabled “final four words.” The critical dialogue that Sherman-Palladino had forever envisioned finishing out the series will finally be unveiled. “I’ve always had those words in my head and known how the show is going to end,” she says. And in what state might they leave fans? Sherman-Palladino pauses, then replies carefully. “I would say I hope the fans feel like they got to come home again.” Cue the febrile . \nGilmore Girls: A Year in the Life , Series premiere, Friday, Nov. 25, Netflix Related Stories",

      "text": "American International Pictures\nThere are a lot of streaming services out there, and to watch everything you’re “supposed” to watch, you need to have access to them all. Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon Video have the most acclaimed original series; Seeso is a comedy lover’s dream; and Crackle has Joe Dirt 2: Beautiful Loser , if that’s your thing. If it’s not, then you might be interested in Brown Sugar, Bounce TV’s subscription-based streaming option that’s like Netflix, “only blacker.” \nBrown Sugar is home to over 100 classic blaxploitation films, including Foxy Brown , Shaft , Super Fly , Cooley High , Blacula , Cleopatra Jones , I’m Gonna Git You Sucka , Mandingo , Willie Dynamite , and The Mack . “These movies are entertaining and fun,” Sheba, Baby icon Pam Grier said, “but they were also empowering to the black community as they depicted African-Americans as strong leading characters and heroes for the first time.” Grier is a so-called “ambassador” alongside actor Fred “The Hammer” Williamson, who added, “There’s a lot of people who want to see these movies. This gives them an opportunity to sit at home and watch the films they have heard about.”\nThe films are separated into collections: War in Harlem, Foxy Mamas, Righteous Revenge, Stickin’ It to The Man, and my personal favorite, Jive-Ass Turkeys. Just in time for Thanksgiving. Brown Sugar is available through iTunes and Google Play, or the streaming service’s website , for $3.99/month.\nYou can dig it (four bucks) out of your pocket.\n(Via Variety )\n",

      "title": "The New Streaming Service Brown Sugar Is Like Netflix, 'Only Blacker'",
      "text": "The New Streaming Service Brown Sugar Is Like Netflix, 'Only Blacker' Josh Kurp More American International Pictures There are a lot of streaming services out there, and to watch everything you’re “supposed” to watch, you need to have access to them all. Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon Video have the most acclaimed original series; Seeso is a comedy lover’s dream; and Crackle has Joe Dirt 2: Beautiful Loser , if that’s your thing. If it’s not, then you might be interested in Brown Sugar, Bounce TV’s subscription-based streaming option that’s like Netflix, “only blacker.” Brown Sugar is home to over 100 classic blaxploitation films, including Foxy Brown , Shaft , Super Fly , Cooley High , Blacula , Cleopatra Jones , I’m Gonna Git You Sucka , Mandingo , Willie Dynamite , and The Mack . “These movies are entertaining and fun,” Sheba, Baby icon Pam Grier said, “but they were also empowering to the black community as they depicted African-Americans as strong leading characters and heroes for the first time.” Grier is a so-called “ambassador” alongside actor Fred “The Hammer” Williamson, who added, “There’s a lot of people who want to see these movies. This gives them an opportunity to sit at home and watch the films they have heard about.” Related Links: The 25 Best Horror Movies On Netflix Right Now, Ranked The films are separated into collections: War in Harlem, Foxy Mamas, Righteous Revenge, Stickin’ It to The Man, and my personal favorite, Jive-Ass Turkeys. Just in time for Thanksgiving. Brown Sugar is available through iTunes and Google Play, or the streaming service’s website , for $3.99/month. You can dig it (four bucks) out of your pocket.",

      "text": "Getty Images When a relationship gets serious, we start to share more of our lives. We borrow each other's cars. We move in together. Inevitably, we start sharing each other's technology and even our passwords. \nBut your device says a lot about you: Your pastimes, your taste in music, your curiosities and the things you shop for. So how do you maintain your privacy online, even with the people who are closest to you? \nMore from USA Today: \nCybersecurity experts offer advice for incoming Trump administration \nSpaceX looks to the skies to bring faster Internet \nAirbnb hosts can now also make money as tour guides \nHere are a few simple tricks to help you keep your secrets under wraps. (Note: Apps and websites do not always work the same across all devices and operating systems. If something isn't located in the menus precisely as I say, look around for a similar action.) \nAmazon \nAmazon tracks not only what you have purchased, but also what you have browsed. If you share an Amazon account, both can pose a major problem especially this time of year. \nThe good news is that you can easily cover your tracks. To erase your browsing history, from your account settings, look for Personalization. Go to Personalized Content >> View and Manage Your Browsing History. Here, you have a few options. You can remove only certain items or all items as well as turn off browsing history, so you never have this issue again. \nLet's say you want to make it more difficult for someone to find out what you have ordered. Amazon will not completely delete your order history, but you can archive individual orders. Casual snoops will have a harder time seeing what you have purchased. From your account settings, go to Your Orders. Select the item you wish to hide and select Archive order. \nYou can use the Amazon app as an additional holiday security measure. Suppose you have purchased a pair of shoes for your spouse, you've archived the order, and now you're waiting for the package to arrive. But you're receiving so many boxes this time of year, how do you know which delivery to open and wrap? \nWith the Amazon app, you can scan the barcode on the box to immediately find out what's inside. It works like a charm – unless your spouse has secretly ordered something for you! \nGoogle \nGoogle often auto-completes your search terms based on personal information, such as your location and previous searches. Anyone looking over your shoulder or borrowing your device might be surprised by the guesses Google makes. Google products that collect your information include Chrome, Google Maps, and YouTube. \nTo delete your search history on Google, you need a Google account. Just log in, go to My Activity, and remove items individually. \nBetter yet, take control of the data Google saves about you. Click here for step-by-step instructions on how to stop Google from collecting data about you. \nMost browsers have a similarly easy way to delete your browsing history, and the controls tend to be in your browser's preferences. Keep this in mind, especially if you're researching something a little unusual. \nFacebook \nFor many of us, Facebook is like a sprawling digital yearbook. Maybe you have a family computer, and you usually forget to log out of Facebook. Other people use the same computer, they stumble into your Facebook account, and they notice your conspicuous search history. \nYour significant other may wonder why you've become so curious about the person you once invited to the prom, no matter how innocent your interest. \nThe easiest way to avoid an awkward conversation is to open your Activity Log. Select More >> Search >> Clear Searches. Or you can remove each search item one by one. \nYour Facebook Activity Log stores a lot of data about you. Click here for tips to clean it up and prevent things from coming back to haunt you. \nNetflix \nWe all have our guilty pleasures, especially when it comes to movies. You may have privately viewed Lars Von Trier's \"Nymphomaniac\" and thought it was a great work of art-house cinema, but that could be hard to explain to a roomful of people. \nIf you want to hide past screenings, just go to My Account >> Viewing History. Be advised that items aren't always deleted immediately; it may take 24 hours for your lists to update on all devices. \nNetflix also allows you to create multiple profiles. Many households don't bother with this unless they have children, but if you want to keep your viewing history private, you can create a personal profile and protect it with a password. Click here to learn how to do this as well as access secret Netflix categories. \nGo incognito \nEvery major web browser including Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Internet Explorer, Safari, and Opera has private, or incognito, browsing settings. Turning this feature on means your browser will ignore cookies including ad-tracking cookies and won't record your browsing history. It's almost like you weren't online. Click here to learn how to enable this simple step to keep your browsing history a secret. \nMaintaining privacy is one of my favorite themes. To learn other ways to protect your information, be sure to listen or download my podcasts, or click here to find it on your local radio station. You can listen to the Kim Komando Show on your phone, tablet or computer. From buying advice to digital life issues, click here for my free podcasts.",

      "text": "Glass November 17, 2016 \nAmazon’s biggest new show, The Grand Tour, premieres today, with the team formerly of the BBC’s Top Gear traveling in expensive cars around the world. It is rumored to cost a whopping £4.5 million ($5.6 million) a show—and Jeremy Clarkson is reportedly making $12.4 million a year to host. \nHe’s not the only streaming-video star taking home a hefty paycheck. The Hollywood Reporter notes that Amazon is paying Robert De Niro $750,000 for each of the 20 episodes of an upcoming series. Jonah Hill and Emma Stone will get $350,000 per episode to star in an upcoming Netflix show called Maniac. Back on premium cable, Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson makes $450,000 per episode on the HBO comedy Ballers. (HBO, it should be noted, is trying to be more like Netflix .) \nThese figures are insane, sure. Netflix, Amazon, and HBO are digging deep into their pockets to secure the best talent. HBO is expected to spend about $1.8 billion this year, 20% more than in 2015, while Netflix plans to spend a staggering $6 billion on content next year and Amazon has boosted its content budget too. \nBut these platforms also pay more for talent upfront, because actors and creators miss out on the ancillary income they would typically get from syndication—when a show is sold on to other networks. That has all changed with streaming. Netflix, in particular, has kept an iron grip on the global rights to most of its programming, rarely releasing it outside of the platform , which means actors don’t get their usual cut of other revenue streams that would have come down the road. \nAn example: the US sitcom Friends still makes about $1 billion a year in syndication revenue for Warner Bros. Each of the show’s core cast members—Jennifer Aniston, Courteney Cox, Lisa Kudrow, Matt LeBlanc, Matthew Perry, and David Schwimmer—takes home about 2% of that, which translates to roughly $20 million per year in syndication income. Each. And that’s for a show that ended 12 years ago. \nDe Niro’s flat fee of $15 million for 20 episodes at Amazon seems like a bargain in comparison. \nStreaming services like Netflix and Amazon account for that when they negotiate deals. Most of Netflix’s deals now have a flat “buy out,” according the Hollywood Reporter. “That’s why the checks are so big,” Netflix’s chief content officer Ted Sarandos reportedly said. “We are negotiating for what the backend would be.” \nThe same is true with films, an earlier Hollywood Reporter story showed. Few Netflix movies go to theaters and those that do are released online the same day, which limits the audience who will pay to see them in theaters. When Netflix is negotiating for the rights to films, it often buys out the cut that actors and creators would get from box-office profits, which is known as profit participation. Amazon offers a small, exclusive window for its theatrical releases, so it likely doesn’t have to buy out the profit participants. \nThis means that Netflix and Amazon’s deep pockets are driving up costs for everyone. Why would someone like De Niro wait for his $15 million when he can get it upfront and work with other A-list talent? Read full story ",

      "text": "What to Watch on Netflix During Thanksgiving Grab the sweatpants. Twitter \nEveryone knows that there are two main rules for going home for the holidays. One, eat as much as possible. Two, be as lazy as possible. It’s basically a mandate that you have to wear sweatpants, keep your hair in a messy bun, and unwind as much as possible. After all, 2017 will be here before we know it, and soon it will be time to hustle once more. The holidays are a time for relaxing and unplugging. \nThanks to Netflix , Hulu, Amazon Prime, and the premium channels, there’s an endless array of movies and TV shows to watch while you’re eating and wearing sweatpants. We're all for family bonding, but sometimes you just need leftovers and your shows, you know? Here are 12 things you should definitely stream this holiday season, from hot new TV shows to everyone’s favorite holiday staples. (Remember, you're allowed to get festive exactly 15 minutes after Thanksgiving is over. String up the lights and say it's a homage to Stranger Things ; we'll be right there with you.) 1. The Crown (Netflix) \nIf Downton Abbey is your jam, you will be obsessed with The Crown . The series follows Queen Elizabeth II as a young woman in her mid-20s when she first takes the throne. It offers everything from drama to royalty to secrets — and tons of passive-aggressive staring for minutes at a time. We’re in. 2. Miracle on 34th Street (Netflix) \nNo matter how many times you watch this Christmas classic, it just never gets old. It speaks to those childhood dreams of wishing and hoping that Santa was actually real. There’s been a couple of remakes, but the 1947 original will always go down in history as the best, despite the fact that Mara Wilson is endlessly adorable in the 1994 version. 3. Gilmore Girls: A Year In the Life (Netflix) \nIt goes without saying that one of the most exciting things happening this holiday season is the Gilmore Girls reboot which is set to hit Netflix on November 25. Between reuniting with all of our faves, not to mention finally learning who Rory will end up with, we’re pretty much counting the days. (No matter what, we’re #TeamRory.) 4. Love Actually (Netflix) \nPretty sure that it’s a law of the holiday season that one must watch Love Actually at least one time. Maybe twice. There’s just something about the format of intertwined plots that make this movie a necessary holiday staple. To us, you are perfect, Love Actually . 5. Bridget Jones’s Diary (Amazon Prime) \nAnother law: you can’t watch Love Actually without also watching Bridget Jones . And while it isn’t exactly a holiday movie, it sure feels like one. Maybe that’s because of the ugly sweater scenes and all the snow on the ground in the outside shots. Bridget Jones’s dry and snarky humor will always make us laugh, and her character will never not feel relatable. 6. The Fosters (Netflix) \nIf you need a show to bond over with your parents, try introducing them to The Fosters . All four seasons of the show are currently on Netflix, so if you get your family hooked, you’ll have plenty to keep watching. 7. Paddington (Netflix) \nThrow it back to your childhood with this total gem. I mean, you don’t get much more adorable than a stuffed teddy bear who is searching for a home in the city of London. Also, Ben Whishaw of The Danish Girl and the new Mary Poppins movie is the voice of Paddington. 8. Hairspray (Netflix) \nConsidering that Hairspray Live! is headed to TV on December 7, it seems like a good idea to spend Thanksgiving break brushing up on your lyrics to “You Can’t Stop the Beat.” Luckily, the 2007 film is on Netflix, waiting for you to sing along. 9. The Holiday (Amazon, iTunes) \nBefore Airbnb was a thing, The Holiday made us want to swap homes with a total stranger. Also, Kate Winslet and the elderly filmmaker she befriends are literal friendship goals in this movie. 10. The Best Man Holiday (Amazon, iTunes) \nThis 2013 film was a sequel to the 1999 film called Best Man . It basically answered the question of – what would happen if a whole bunch of friends got together for the first time ever in 14 years...on Christmas? It sounds like a good idea, but also a recipe for plenty of drama. 11. Fuller House (Netflix) \nNovember will bring us Gilmore Girls , and December will give us the second season of Fuller House . Season 2 is scheduled to drop on Netflix on December 9 – which means there’s plenty of time to refresh your memory with season 1. 12. Beethoven’s Christmas Adventure (Neftlix) \nOkay, maybe this is the best way to throw it back to your childhood. Beethoven’s Christmas Adventure was a straight-to-video holiday movie, but, uh, still totally amazing. It featured everyone’s favorite fluffy Saint Bernard and his adventures with holiday elves. Sometimes you just have to watch a talking dog and not feel bad about it.",

      "title": "Black Mirror: San Junipero review",
      "text": "Netflix\n\"Black Mirror\" is known for dystopian visions of our tech-enhanced future. The episode everyone is talking about, though, is different.\n\"San Junipero\" is the fourth episode of the Netflix-produced third season of the short film series.\nPut it on and you may be struck, first, by the retro feel. Second, you may wonder what is sci-fi about it: the first act features no world-changing tech, only subtle hints in dialogue, music, and scenery that there's more than meets the eye. Finally, the ending is unlike any other in the series.\nWe've pulled highlights from the opening below. See if you can tell what's going on.\nView As: One Page Slides The episode opens in 1987, with a theater playing \"The Lost Boys,\" a movie about two brothers who realize their California town is filled with vampires. Is that a clue? From \"Black Mirror\" San Junipero A car radio is playing the contemporary hit, \"Heaven is a Place on Earth.\" From \"Black Mirror\" San Junipero Enter our protagonist, Yorkie, played by Mackenzie Davis from \"Halt and Catch Fire.\" From \"Black Mirror\" San Junipero \"Am I dreaming?\" asks a guy on a TV display. From \"Black Mirror\" San Junipero In walks the other lead, Kelly, played by Gugu Mbatha-Raw, with a guy hassling her. He says: \"Could you please stop? We’ve only got a couple of hours so let’s use it.\" She replies: \"I am using it.\" From \"Black Mirror\" San Junipero Moments later in a club, Kelly sits down next to Yorkie to try to lose that guy. \"Go along with whatever I say,\" Kelly says. From \"Black Mirror\" San Junipero \"I need to talk with my friend here, ok?\" Kelly says. \"She’s sick. Like 'sick months to live' sick.\" Yorkie chimes in: \"five, actually.\" From \"Black Mirror\" San Junipero The two women get a drink. Kelly says she likes Yorkie’s glasses: \"People try so hard to look how they think they should look. They probably saw it in some movie. But I like these. They’re authentically you.\" From \"Black Mirror\" San Junipero \"So you’re new here?\" Kelly asks. \"Wow, ok! Oh my God! We have to dance to this.\" From \"Black Mirror\" San Junipero Yorkie lasts about 20 seconds on the dance floor before running outside. From \"Black Mirror\" San Junipero Kelly joins her: \"Sorry I pushed you into it,\" she says. \"Saturday night’s once a week. It’s like no time. I get impatient.\" From \"Black Mirror\" San Junipero Yorkie says everyone was looking at them—two girls dancing. Kelly tells her people are less uptight than they used to be. Yorkie confesses that she’s never been on a dance floor before, that she never does anything fun, and that she is engaged. From \"Black Mirror\" San Junipero But her fiancé isn’t here. \"Wanna go to bed with me?\" Kelly asks. \"We could be back at mine in like [snap].\" From \"Black Mirror\" San Junipero Yorkie, clearly torn, says she can’t. From \"Black Mirror\" San Junipero Yorkie walks alone in the rain. From \"Black Mirror\" San Junipero The camera pans down to a full moon in a puddle and cuts. From \"Black Mirror\" San Junipero The show jumps forward in time. From \"Black Mirror\" San Junipero 13 minutes have passed, and we still have almost no idea what’s going on. Yet there's an engaging story and something mysterious happening. As the show continues, we see how radically different this world is from ours—yet how realistic it might be. From \"Black Mirror\" San Junipero The other unusual thing about this episode? It's got an optimistic ending.\n\"I really wanted to create something that felt different from what we’re used to at the moment, and I think that’s what’s really refreshing about it,\" director Owen Harris told The Hollywood Reporter . \"It’s this world where you’re allowed to dance around to Belinda Carlisle, it’s a world of guilty pleasures but, because of the look and the feel of it, it’s larger than life, which makes everything a little bit more optimistic.\"\nSimply said, we wouldn't mind if someone really made San Junipero.\nSEE ALSO: Futurist explains what \"San Junipero\" gets wrong about tech (warning: spoilers!)

      "text": "Its new show with the former stars of Top Gear is part of the plan + READ ARTICLE \nNetflix has had the global streaming-video market more or less to itself for some time now, apart from a few tentative steps made by smaller players such as HBO. But now it is getting a major competitor, and one with even deeper pockets. Amazon is said to be close to rolling out its Prime Video service worldwide. \nThe Wall Street Journal said that the e-commerce giant is expected to expand its video offering into about 200 countries. It is currently only available in the U.S., U.K., Germany, Austria, and Japan. \nThe impending roll-out was also leaked on Twitter TWTR by Jeremy Clarkson, star of Amazon’s new show The Grand Tour and former host of the popular Top Gear car series on BBC. Clarkson and his co-hosts left the British network last year after Clarkson’s contract was not renewed, following a physical altercation with a BBC producer. \nClarkson said in a series of tweets that fans would be able to see his new show in 200 countries starting in December. So. People of Ireland, Canada, Australia and pretty well everywhere else. You WILL be able to watch the Grand Tour. Amazon has gone global. \n— Jeremy Clarkson (@JeremyClarkson) November 16, 2016 \nNetflix NFLX expanded its global reach in January, launching simultaneously in 130 countries for a total of more than 190 nations and territories. China is one of the only major markets where the service is unavailable. The online rental giant recently announced that it would license its content to Chinese services because the regulatory environment in that country is too hostile to outsiders. \nIn the months following its international launch, Netflix’s subscriber growth was weaker than many analysts expected, and many argued that this was partly because broadband Internet access is not as widespread in many developing countries. But in the most recent quarter, the company added 60% more international customers than it had been projecting. \nAmazon has been bulking up its Prime Video service for some time, bidding aggressively at places like the Sundance Film Festival and in Hollywood for new movie rights, TV shows, and other content. And with a market value of $380 billion and $18 billion in cash on hand, the company clearly has the financial resources to keep that up almost indefinitely. \nNetflix’s spending habits, on the other hand, have been the subject of some concern among investors and analysts. As the company has moved away from licensing the rights to existing shows and begun creating more of its own content, its costs have skyrocketed. \nNext year, Netflix is expected to spend upwards of $6 billion producing more than 1,200 hours of movies, TV shows, documentaries, and children’s television programs. It has been able to finance all of that using its shares, but if the stock drops, doing this could become problematic. Last year, its cash flow was negative $500 million. \nAmazon has shown that it is more than happy to lose money for years in pursuit of a market that it believes is worth the investment. And it has a massive source of cash in its Amazon Web Services data-hosting platform, which generates roughly $10 billion in revenue every year. \nAs the e-commerce giant steps up the competition, Netflix could feel increasing pressure to find an acquirer with deep pockets to help it grow. Both Apple and Disney DIS -1.04% have been reported as potential buyers , although at $50 billion, it would be a large mouthful for either one.",

      "text": "“There WIll Be Blood” accompanied by a live orchestra Richie Clarke \nLater tonight, close to 2,000 moviegoers will fill Howard Gilman Opera House in Brooklyn to watch Terrence Malick ’s “Tree of Life,” set to a live score played by a 110-piece orchestra and choir. It’s the seventh live score production by the New York-based Wordless Music Orchestra, which has previously staged live music productions of other modern day classics like “There Will Be Blood” and “Under the Skin.” \nFor the founder of Wordless Music, Ronen Givony, the need to create a heightened sense of occasion with a live event is vital in the age of Netflix and Spotify. \nREAD MORE: Howard Shore, Composer for Cronenberg, ‘Spotlight’ and Scorsese, on the Creation of Diverse Scores \n“I think it’s fair to say that whether it’s an orchestra concert or a rock concert or a movie, it seems like especially in New York, the simple act of going out and seeing a movie in a theater with complete strangers sometimes seems like an increasingly endangered activity,” said Givony in a recent interview with IndieWire. “We are trying to emphasize the sense of the occasion and the rarity of seeing a film made by a great artist.” “There Will Be Blood” with Live Score Richie Clarke \nFor Joseph Melillo, the Executive Producer at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, who is responsible for all artistic programming at BAM, watching a film with a live music enhances the audience’s appreciation of the movie itself. \n“Harnessed together, film and live music become a theatrical event,” wrote Melillo. “You cannot escape that you are experiencing musicians performing the musical score while you are engaged in the storytelling of the film.” \nStarted in 2006, Wordless Music was created in an effort to get younger audiences to appreciate classical music through contemporary musicians. \n“We were seeking out audiences that do not normally attend orchestra and classical music concerts,” said Givony. “We wanted to show them that although they may not be listening to John Cage and Steve Reich, they are listening to Radiohead, Bjork, and David Byrne, who are closer to classical music than they might know.” \nREAD MORE: How ‘Neon Demon’ Composer Cliff Martinez Balanced Humor, Horror & Bernard Herrmann Temp Tracks \nPutting someone like Radiohead’s Jonny Greenwood on stage alongside the music of composer Gavin Bryars, Wordless has been staging unique musical performance at special venues — ranging from the Guggenheim Museum to the Good Shepherd Faith Church — around the world for 10 years. \n“A curious, intellectually hungry individual really just needs to be intelligently welcomed,” said Givony. “It doesn’t need to be explained to how great the music they’re listening to is, it’s a matter of just putting it in front of them and letting them judge it on the merits.” \nIn 2013, Givony decided to extend his experiment by collaborating with director Benh Zeitlin and his co-composer Dan Romer to put together an outdoor screening of “Beasts of the Southern Wild.” \nAs you can see in the video clip above, the event was an enormous success, leaving Givony, a self-proclaimed “film dork,” knowing he wanted to do more live score screenings. He also knew from working with Romer and Zeitlin, a close collaboration with filmmaking team was essential. \nPart of this is pure logistics. To pull this off, Wordless needs a print of the movie that has the music removed from the soundtrack , something a distributor is more likely to supply if supported by Paul Thomas Anderson or Terrence Malick. There are also gaps that sometimes need to filled in. \nREAD MORE: Focus Features Buys Paul Thomas Anderson and Daniel Day-Lewis’ Fashion Drama, Eyes Late 2017 Release \n“‘Punch Drunk Love’ for example, that film was made right on the transitional point to when everything was digitized and a lot of the sheet music that Sony provided us with did not align at all with what ended up on the soundtrack, because in the studio they would mess with it,” explained Givony. \nIn translating the score to a live performance, including the mix and instrumentation, Givony doesn’t always feel comfortable making decisions without the original artists’ participation. “Punch Drunk Love” The Criterion Collection \n“The only thing [all the films we do] really have in common is that they’re made by total artists,” said Givony. “It’s not a coincidence that Zeitlin wrote half that score and was playing banjo on stage. It’s not a coincidence that Paul [Thomas Anderson] was standing at the sound stage saying ‘bring up the effects,’‘bring up the dialogue,’ and stood at the sound board for every performance.” \nREAD MORE: ‘Punch Drunk Love’ Composer Jon Brion Explores Film’s Musical Rhythms, Compares It To An Old Hollywood Musical \nThis idea of a filmmaker being so rigorous and precise about the use of music is also certainly true of Terrence Malick. \n“Terence Malick, in addition to being the director, is also the defacto music supervisor, sound editor, and he deals with every audio decision that goes into his movies,” said Givony. \nYet unlike Anderson or Zeitlin, Givony didn’t have a way of connecting with the director known for staying far out of the public eye. After getting permission from Fox to do “Tree of Life,” Givony was eventually able to get in contact with Malick, a classical music aficionado, who had a long list of questions wanting to know about everything about rehearsals, the venue, print quality, and screen size. Terrrence Malick \n“Another big question was about who our singers would be, as this is a very vocal heavy score,” explained Givony. “We have a soprano who was just at the Park Avenue Armory. There is also a pretty prominent boy-soprano part in the score, so we had to find this American boy choir school in Princeton [where we discovered] this amazing six-year-old singer, and of course his name is Charles Love, because what else would it be for a Terrence Malick movie.” \nREAD MORE: Why Terrence Malick Still Believes You Should See Movies On the Big Screen \nReaching Malick and getting his blessing, was just a small part of why tonight’s “Tree of Life” performance took three years to put together and was such a massive production compared to previous Wordless events. The film’s soundtrack includes twenty-plus composers . The film also has an original score, which is a small percentage of the music in the film, written by the composer Alexandre Desplat, who requested it not be played live. Wordless then had to work with Fox to identify the sixty-plus music cues that needed to be removed and the Deplat ones that would remain. \nGivony also hired a young composer to go through all the music in the film, figuring out what pieces of music from contemporary composers they would need obtain permission, while also generating sheet music for what is essentially a mixtape of the greatest composers of all time. \n“This is all just to say that it was a little more involved than just playing Jonny Greenwood’s cues,” joked Givony. The Audience at Wordless Music’s Live Orchestra Screening of “There Will Be Blood” Richie Clarke \nThe classical music all required a orchestra two to four times bigger than previous Wordless productions, which made funding the event stressful, especially because Givony was worried “Tree of Life” might not be as big a draw as their previous films. \n“Obviously, when you’re doing a popular film like ‘There Will Be Blood’ with someone like Jonny Greenwood on stage, you can count on a certain number of tickets being sold,” said Givony. \nBAM will be a packed house tonight and Saturday, which for the Wordless team feels like vindication of their larger mission and three-year journey to put it all together.",

      "text": "The Workplace 5 workplace takeaways from 'The Crown' The new Netflix series about a young Queen Elizabeth II offers relatable lessons on how to take charge of your career and be more self-possessed, assertive and poised in your professional interactions. Tweet \nWhen I was little, I loved to play dress-up. One of my favorite activities was to put on a movie, dress up as the heroine and act out the story as the movie played. \nIt has been 20+ years since I last dressed up as Mary Poppins and tried to fly by jumping off the staircase with an umbrella, but the memory came rushing back to me after recently watching \" The Crown \" on Netflix. \n\"The Crown\" is about Queen Elizabeth II's early days as monarch, and her journey from shy, timid newlywed to strong, confident queen. The series provides poignant lessons about projecting confidence, demonstrating authority and establishing yourself in the workplace. \nWhether you're just beginning your career or are a seasoned pro in need of a pep talk, here are some lessons from the series on how to be more confident at work. Get ready to feel empowered, motivated and inspired to don a crown. \n1. Ask yourself, \"Why not me?\" \nDo you ever feel like you're one day away from being found out? That if you ask one silly question or make one simple mistake you'll lose all credibility? \nIf so, I have news for you: Most people feel this way. \nIn episode 8 of \"The Crown,\" Elizabeth and her husband, Prince Philip, are deciding whether to make a particular stop on a royal tour. Philip and her advisors don't want the couple to make the stop for safety reasons, but Elizabeth insists. \n\"I am aware that I am surrounded by people who feel they could do the job better,\" the monarch says. \"Strong people with powerful characters, more natural leaders, perhaps better suited to leading from the front, making a mark. But for better or worse, the crown has landed on my head. And I say we go.\" \nRather than give in to others' (and her own) doubts, she embraces her position and takes charge. \nYou've worked hard to be where you are, and you deserve to be there. Ask yourself, \"Why can't I be the one to solve this problem?\" or \"Why wouldn't someone come to me to discuss this issue?\" When you frame situations in this way, you'll probably find that you are the only person holding you back. [ RELATED: Join us at Facebook's headquarters for the Facebook Leadership Communications Summit. ] \n2. Define your personal brand. \nAfter Elizabeth learns of her father's death, one of the first orders of business she must address is what her regal name will be. She says, quite practically: \"What's wrong with my name? Let's not overcomplicate matters unnecessarily. My name is Elizabeth.\" She doesn't think twice about her identity. \nDo you have the same confidence in your personal brand? Identify what are you're good at, what you enjoy and what you want to be known for. Know who you are and what you stand for, and strive every day to live that brand. \n3. Know what you value. \nMany of the queen's most difficult decisions force her to choose between what Parliament wants and what her family and her own moral code encourage her to do. \nWhen her sister, Princess Margaret, announces that she wants to marry a divorced man, Parliament and the Archbishop of Canterbury tell Elizabeth that, as queen, she cannot allow such a match. Elizabeth struggles between her love and loyalty for her sister, and what the role of queen demands. Much to the dismay of Princess Margaret, Elizabeth decides to act as monarch, not sister, and does not allow the match. \nThe decisions you make in the workplace probably do not pit you against your family, but some might still be difficult to make. Know what you value, and have opinions. When you know what you stand for, decision making becomes significantly easier. \n4. Acknowledge what you don't know, and find a way to learn it. \nYou can't possibly know everything about your industry, and no one expects you to, but don't let that hold you back from learning as much as you can. As they say, knowledge is power. \nIn episode 7, Elizabeth reveals her insecurity around politicians, because she thinks they are much smarter than she. To enable herself to keep up with them, she hires a tutor. \n\"I spend so much time with politicians and statesmen. You know, I live in dread of being left alone with them,\" she says. \"It'd be nice to think that one could, if not hold one's own, then at least not have to steer the conversation away to dogs and horses every time.\" \nAcknowledge when you don't know something, and strive to become as knowledgeable as you can. Even if you can't participate in a conversation today, that doesn't mean you can't learn about it and have a cogent opinion tomorrow. \n5. Don't trivialize your experience. \nIn episode 7, the queen discovers that Prime Minister Winston Churchill had suffered a minor stroke, which prevented him from meeting with U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower—and that he lied to her about it. \nShe's furious at Churchill for doing so, but she is too intimidated to tell him. \n\"I can't just summon the brightest, most formidable men in the country and give them a dressing down like children,\" she says to her tutor. \"They're far more intelligent than I am. In any confrontation, they'd out-debate me, out-think me and out-maneuver me.\" \n(Does this sounds like your own inner dialogue sometimes?) \nElizabeth's tutor tells her that she should stand up for herself. Thanks to her childhood education, she knows the Constitution better than Churchill or any other politician, and that is \"the only education that matters,\" he says. \nElizabeth follows her tutor's advice and gives Churchill a good dressing down—which earns her significant respect. \nMaybe you've only been in the workforce for a few years. Or perhaps you've been working for a decade, but you just took a job in a new industry. It doesn't matter how little experience you have—you bring a perspective that no one else has, and that counts for something. What other advice do you have for becoming more confident at work?",

(Netflix photo) Netflix \nFrom left: Kelly Bishop, Lauren Graham and Alexis Bledel in \"Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life.\" Netflix Saeed Adyani/Netflix \nFrom left: Scott Patterson, Lauren Graham Alexis Bledel in \"Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life.\" Netflix \nFrom left: Lauren Graham, Sally Struthers and Rose Abdoo in \"Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life.\" Netflix TownNews.com Content Exchange \nNot much will get done in some homes on Friday. That’s the day the sun comes up again in Stars Hollow, the impossibly quaint little Connecticut town we left, wiping away tears, almost a decade ago. \nSome of us may even nap on Thanksgiving day so we can stay up late Thursday to binge on “Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life,” arriving at midnight Pacific time (2 a.m. Friday in St. Louis), on Netflix. \nNothing has changed, but everything has, since the “Gilmore Girls” faithful said goodbye to Lorelai and Rory Gilmore on May 15, 2007. \nWe thought the goodbye was forever. “Gilmore Girls” had run seven seasons and 153 episodes, first on the WB and then on the consolidated CW, but the finale was tainted by the departure, a year earlier, of creator Amy Sherman-Palladino, whose dazzling writing made Stars Hollow such a magical place. \nThe finale, written by David S. Rosenthal, who had replaced Sherman-Palladino, closed with mother and daughter Lorelai and Rory sharing coffee at Luke’s Diner, just as they had in the first episode. But nostalgia was overlaid with sadness that the last scene didn’t include the four final words with which Sherman-Palladino had always planned to end the show. \nWe moved on, but lots of us — daughters, mothers, sisters, friends and hey, some “Gilmore” guys, too — never really let go. We didn’t have to. \nWith televised repeats (episodes currently air on Freeform), DVDs and streaming (every episode is on Netflix), we could check back in whenever we liked and also bring newcomers into the fold. And many of us did. \nThat’s because “Gilmore Girls” was more than a television show. It was a cultural touchstone for a segment of viewers who don’t always feel catered to. It deeply explored mother-daughter relationships, celebrated friendship and the families we create for ourselves, and always empowered girls and young women to aspire higher and be proud to be smart. \n“Gilmore Girls” was heartfelt and touching but also unfailingly witty and irreverent, with dialogue so snappy and fast-paced that even several viewings couldn’t catch every great line. It reminded us regularly that there’s no place like home, no matter how annoying the inhabitants might be. \nNo wonder “Gilmore Girls” was such a great candidate for watching and rewatching, a phenomenon ideal for the age of streaming. \nThe first talk was about a possible movie, and fans held our collective breath that it would ever happen. When all seven seasons arrived on Netflix in the fall of 2014, that turned out to be an important step ahead. \nA cast reunion at the ATX television festival in Austin, Texas, in June of 2015 confirmed the fervor with which fans still viewed “Gilmore Girls,” blowing up social media with responses. \nRevival-crazy Netflix was clearly the ideal venue for a new “Gilmore Girls,” and on Jan. 29, the streaming giant made it official, confirming that Sherman-Palladino and her husband and producing partner, Daniel Palladino, were both committed to a revival. \nLauren Graham (Lorelai), Alexis Bledel (Rory), Scott Patterson (Luke) and Kelly Bishop (Emily Gilmore) were listed initially as being on board, but since then the cast has grown to include virtually every other regular, with even Melissa McCarthy (who was Sookie before she was a breakout movie star) making time to drop in. 4 movies, 6 hours \nFans were thrilled enough even before learning that, instead of a movie, they would be getting four movies, each representing a season of “Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life.” \nFour movies. Six hours. Arguably, that’s the perfect binge length. \nSherman-Palladino initially opposed the “binge” model. “I told them I was going to hang myself from a shower curtain if they put them all out,” she recalled as part of a “Gilmore Girls” Netflix panel with TV critics this summer. \nShe lost. \n“It’s such a journey, and it’s such a build to the last four words,” she said. Also, “we live in an age where I knew people were going to go right to the last four words and then put it on the internet and possibly spoil it for people who are going to take the journey. However, you know, you don’t always get what you want.” \nNevertheless, “The good outweighs the bad in the sense that this is a wonderful place to be able to create things and do things in a different way. So, you know, shower curtain will wait.” \nGraham, who starred in “Parenthood” on NBC post-“Gilmore,” was one of the first to sign on for the revival — and one of the happiest. \n“It was literally like no time had passed,” she said. “It just feels like such a perfect fit. I just couldn’t believe I got to do it again.” \nBledel agreed. “It really was as if no time had passed.” \n“Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life” will be set in the four seasons. Two major plots find Rory adrift, struggling with where her career should go, and all the Gilmores mourning the loss of patriarch Richard. (Edward Herrmann died in 2014.) \nThe show’s other mother and daughter, Emily and Lorelai, still have issues, but new ones. \nAs Sherman-Palladino put it, “I really feel like the (stuff) in your family never gets worked out. That, to me, is what’s so great about family. It’s a constant evolution. ... That’s why this show was such a great show to write, because you’re never going to run out of conflict.” \nShe doesn’t look back on what might have been if she and her husband hadn’t left “Gilmore Girls” when they did, in a contract dispute. She considers the Netflix show very much its own thing. “When we left ‘Gilmore,’ we left ‘Gilmore.’” \nTen years ago, Netflix didn’t exist as we know it today. “When Netflix popped up and decided to storm the world and just take over overnight, we thought, well, what a great opportunity to delve into a different form, to tell stories in a different way using characters that we loved. And we get to get back into a room with these actors and be able to go at it again, but in a completely different way.” \nThe different way, Sherman-Pallacino said, includes the fact that “you’re writing not (for) commercials or to sell soap or tampons. ... It’s really just there to tell stories.” \nSherman-Palladino isn’t actually too worried that, hours or even minutes after the new episodes hit Netflix, the “four last words” she’s kept secret so long will be everywhere and that some people might actually watch the end first. \n“It would be great if people who wanted to see the last four words first got some therapy before it actually aired and got rid of that inclination,” she said. \n“It really is a journey leading up to the last four words, and I do think it’s going to mean a lot more if you’ve taken the journey and a lot less if you just flip to the last page. That being said, what can I do? I would hope that people would want to take the whole trip.” What “Gilmore Girls: A Ye ar i n the Life” • When Available for stream ing at 10 p.m. Thursday • Where Netflix • More info netf lix.com \nGail Pennington • 314-340-8136",

      "text": "Will there be a second season of The Crown on Netflix? Will Claire Foy and Matt Smith's royal Netflix drama be back?   Sarah Doran  16AM \nNetflix drama The Crown only covers the first few years of Queen Elizabeth II's (Claire Foy) reign so surely there's room for a second series? \nThe good news is, YES, there is indeed. A second series is already on order at Netflix, and is already in pre-production. Will Claire Foy and Matt Smith be back for a second series of The Crown? \nThey've confirmed that they won't play The Queen and Prince Philip forever, but Foy and Smith can confirm they'll be back for series 2. \nIn fact, they're already in rehearsals for another 8 month shoot - at least that's what they told RadioTimes.com at a recent Netflix event in New York. How many episodes will there be in The Crown series 2? \nProducer Andrew Eaton says we can probably look forward to another 10 episodes of royal drama from Peter Morgan's pen. When will The Crown be back for series 2? \nA launch date on Netflix has yet to be confirmed but watch this space - we'll keep you posted. \nThe Crown is available to stream on Netflix now",

      "text": "Divines review – exhilarating urban thriller froths with joie de vivre Read more \nDespite the seemingly limitless resources at its disposal, Netflix has shown little interest in forging a brand identity. Instead, with its burgeoning parade of Netflix Originals, the platform has attempted to simultaneously appeal to everyone, from nostalgic thirtysomethings ( Stranger Things ) to excitable tweens ( Haters Back Off ) via the terminally masochistic (high-octane Kevin James romp True Memoirs Of An International Assassin , now streaming!).\nAbout the only demographic Netflix has failed to reach are those sophisticated torch-holders of the seventh art, the French. The platform faced massive resistance after launching in France in 2014, thanks to the incompatibility of its tricksy tax arrangements with the country’s commitment to reinvestment in the film industry. Its catalogue was also hamstrung by local customs: a French regulation prohibits films from streaming until 36 months after their cinema release.\n  \nEager to break through in the world’s seventh biggest film market, Netflix continued to enthusiastically court French viewers, and this year it struck at the very heart of French cinephilia by acquiring a raft of titles at the Cannes film festival. First out of the gate is Houda Benyamina’s Divines, winner of the festival’s Caméra d’Or prize, which began streaming yesterday.\nThe film follows 15-year-old Dounia as she navigates the Paris banlieues in search of an escape from the monotony of school life and a reprieve from the poverty of her small shanty town. If that sounds like the perfect framework on which to hang cliches, you won’t be surprised to hear that Dounia soon falls in with a charismatic but sporadically terrifying drug dealer and takes a shine to a tough but sensitive dancer.\n\nDivines director Houda Benyamina: 'It's better to make a film than a bomb' Read more \nFamiliar tropes aside, the film is a commanding coming-of-age story, thanks to its forthright refusal to deny the pressures exerted by gender and race in every aspect of Dounia’s existence, and its low-key understanding of the particulars of contemporary youth culture. For my money, Divines is never more alive than in the not-insignificant portions of its running time that take the form of triumphant, youthful Snapchats.\nThe film feels like just the thing to heal the bad blood between Netflix and France’s reluctant industry gatekeepers, but if Divines does represent an attempt to woo French detractors with content tailored directly to them, the platform must be playing the long game. As per government policy, the film won’t be available to stream in its home country until August 2019 .",

      "text": "Netflix releases second trailer for Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life Staff writers, News Corp Australia Network November 20, 2016 1:33am \nGood news for those fans who just can’t wait another week for the Netflix release of Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life . The streaming service has released a new trailer ahead of the show’s hotly anticipated return on November 25. \nThe new trailer sees Rory (Alexis Bledel) and her mum Lorelai (Lauren Graham) back together in Stars Hollow. Rory, who’s now a journalist, is not thrilled with Babette’s (Sally Struthers) assertion that she’s “back” for good. New Gilmore Girls trailer \n“You know about the thirty-something gang?” Babette tells Rory in the trailer. “It’s a group of kids, all about your age, they’ve been to college, then out in the real world, and it spit ‘em out like a stale piece of gum, and now they’re all back in their old rooms, like you.” media_camera No one drinks coffee better than Lorelai and Rory. Picture: Netflix \n“I’m not back!” says Rory. Maybe not, but there’s still plenty that’s up in the air in Rory’s life. “I’m feeling very lost these days,” she tells Milo Ventimiglia’s Jess. “I have no job. I have no credit. I have no underwear.” \nThe much loved show, which wrapped after seven seasons in 2007, returns as a four part feature-length series. \nIn an interview with Entertainment Tonight , Graham spoke about being reunited with her onscreen daughter, Bledel. media_camera Alexis Bledel and Lauren Graham address a fan event to promote the new season of the Netflix series Gilmore Girls in Berlin. Picture: AFP/dpa/Britta Pedersen/Germany OUT \n“You know, the way these things come together is so circuitous and she’s so busy,” Graham said. “Then we all were together on set and it was just great. [We] got to hang out after and it’s like [Alexis was] saying, you have a foundation with these people, so anything else is just icing on the cake.” \n“It was the final piece of the puzzle to make sure that the show felt whole,” she continued. “That all of its important players were there, except for [the late] Ed [Herrmann who played Richard Gilmore], but it was great to have her there.” media_camera",

      "text": "When Netflix announced that Gilmore Girls was returning to Netflix for four feature length episodes, entitled A Year in the Life, we had a sneaking suspicion that it was going to be a reunion and a farewell. When we spoke to the Girls themselves, Lauren Graham and Alexis Bledel, they were coy about whether it was curtains for the show. Now, in an interview with The Hollywood Reporter, showrunners Dan Palladino and Amy Sherman-Palladino have been more concrete about their opinion on the matter. \"We really had a very specific journey in our minds,\" said Amy Sherman-Palladino, \"and we fulfilled the journey. So to us, this is the piece that we wanted to do. \"And the whole thought about, 'Is there more? Is there more?! Is there more?!!' - this has to go out into the universe now. \"We've got to put this to bed. I can't look at this show anymore.\" We're pretty sure this doesn't mean that Amy hates her own show, more that she can't keep working away at it anymore, but she does seem very definitive about finding closure. HOWEVER, earlier in the interview the couple talked about bringing the show back in the first place, and Dan said: \"When people talk about, 'Are there going to be more?' - in this world, you can't say no to anything. We wouldn't say no to anything.\" \"I would say no to being in the Trump administration,\" added Amy. So there you go - it looks like this could be the end of Gilmore Girls but, given the duo's inability to say no (most of the time), who knows? ",

      "title": "'Stranger Things' Season 2: Plot Details Remain Secret But Millie Bobby Brown Wants to Play Young Princess Leia in Future Star Wars Film | Gospelherald.com",
      "text": "Comment Millie Bobby Brown plays Eleven in Netflix’s hit paranormal thriller series ‘Stranger Things.’ Photo: Netflix \nActress Millie Bobby Brown has revealed that she dreams of playing a younger Princess Leia in future ‘Star Wars’ movies. \nBrown, who plays Eleven in the hit Netflix series ‘Stranger Things,’ made an appearance at the Rhode Island Comic Con where she was asked regarding future roles she would want to take . \nThe twelve-year-old star reportedly responded with: “Princess Leia. If they made – I think they are making another ‘Star Wars’– I would love a role like that. Because I want to do something far from Eleven or Madison.” \nNetflix already confirmed that ‘Stranger Things’ has been renewed for a second installment. Season 2 is expected to be comprised of nine episodes, having one more than the previous installment. A teaser video already disclosed the titles of the upcoming episodes and dropped a hint that ‘Stranger Things’ season 2 will be set in 1984, a whole year after the first season’s storyline ended. \nBrown is expected to make a comeback for the series’ next installment, recently taking to social media and posting a photo on Instagram of her and actor David Harbour, who portrays police chief Jim Hopper. The actress wrote the following caption: “S @dkharbour don’t say a word! #s02 #strangerthings @netflix @strangerthingstv.” \nThe number of episodes Brown will be featured in remains unclear; nonetheless, TVLine reported that she will become a regular character on the series once more. \nEven the rest of the ‘Stranger Things’ cast reunited for the second season, posting an image of the “upside down world” version of the actors. \nMeanwhile, director Shawn Levy remains mum about the storylines for the next installment, which will air in 2017. In the first season, ‘Stranger Things’ placed the spotlight on the dark and mysterious circumstances faced by a town with an alternative universe known as the “Upside Down.” \nSpeaking to Screen Rant , Levy was asked if he could drop a couple of hints about the second season, which is currently being developed. \n“All I’m going to tell you about season two… Look, as much as people are dying to know what happened, I think the reason Stranger Things has become the phenomenon it has is because no one knew what was coming,” the director shared. “I think there’s this delicious torture in not knowing.” \nNonetheless, actor Charlie Heaton, who takes on the role of Jonathan Byers, described the upcoming season as “darker” and “bigger” compared to the previous. \nNew actors have been added to the ‘Stranger Things’ season 2 cast, including Sean Astin (‘The Goonies’). \nLevy insisted that, despite remaining tight-lipped about the new installment, fans of the series will give thanks to him for not giving out even in a few details. \n“What I will say is, having heard the first half of the season at our table read at the end of last week, that I’m very excited even as I’m trying to tune out a lot of the news of the culture and just focus on our instincts, our actors, or… directorial instincts that brought us to this table,” the helmer shared. \n“We want to follow the same guidelines we were following last year when we made this show that no one knew about and no one cared about. But I will say we have some very interesting ideas cooking for season two,” Levy added. \nThe ‘Stranger Things’ season 2 premiere is set for a release in 2017. ",

Elsewhere, Emily mourns the death of Richard, while Lorelai seems uncertain about her life with Luke. \nAlso in the trailer? Excessive takeout food (duh), magical winter snowfall (Lorelai’s favorite) and coffee.

Tweet Jane the Virgin Season 3 / Copyright The CW \nJane the Virgins season 3 has taken the series to the next level this year with Jane actually committing the deed and for most, that means you’ll be desperately wanting to watch or rewatch the whole of season 3 on Netflix. We’re here with good news about the season 3 release date of Jane the Virgin on Netflix as it’ll be coming to Netflix sooner than the previous seasons. \nThe CW series which first premiered in 2014 has been a staple and frankly a change of pace for The CW which is more commonly known for its superhero adaptations and supernatural shows. The CW hoped to grab the attention of the same people that watches The Vampire Diaries and that they certainly did. \nSeason 3 of the show actually dropped the last two words of the title, well technically they crossed them out. The show revolves around Jane who gets pregnant after a swab test gets mixed up. It’s all about how she deals with that in a deeply religious family. \nOnce again, the series started airing on The CW in October meaning there’s no change in the shows schedule making it much easier to predict its Netflix arrival. Under normal circumstances, we’d be getting new episodes in July but this year we think it could be even earlier. \nThe CW over the summer signed in a new contract with Netflix that states it’ll be bringing its shows earlier to Netflix than normal. In some instances, we could have new seasons arrive just eight days after their season finale airs. If this is indeed the case for Jane the Virgin, it’s safe to say that we’ll be getting season 3 drop on Netflix in late May 2017 or early June 2017. That’s excellent news and will give you plenty of times to rewatch the series over and over before the inevitable season 4 in fall 2017. \nAre you happy about getting Jane the Virgin on Netflix sooner than normal?

If you find out that your date doesn’t do well with heights, stick to the kiddie rides. Amusement parks are so fun whether you’re on a date or not. So, why not go? Get the cotton candy, do the Ferris wheel – go all out. Plus, it’s a good way to get the adrenaline and hormones working. Now that’s one of the most fun things to do on a date! \n#3 Coffee walk. This is a perfect date during fall or winter. It’s a little nippy outside, but you’re both bundled up with a hot cup of coffee or tea. Walk around the city and admire the falling leaves or Christmas decorations. You don’t have to dish out a lot of cash to have a good date. It’s all about the company – am I right? [Read: What to do on a date to have a perfect first date ] \n#4 Festivals. Maybe there’s a Christmas festival or a Jamaican food festival going on. Why not check it out? You can walk around the stands, grab some yummy dishes from food trucks, and watch the live entertainment. It’ll be fun, and if you two have both never been to this festival, it’s a new experience that you’re sharing together. \n#5 Bowling . I personally hate bowling, so I don’t think it’s one of the fun things to do on a date. But, shockingly, lots of people actually like bowling. I think it’s because you have the opportunity to touch your date without coming off like a pushy sleaze bag. Whatever. If you like bowling, then I highly recommend you try it out with your date. Preferably at a place that serves alcohol. \n#6 Dinner out . Okay, dinner is the go-to idea for a date. However, you can have fun with this one. Why not try a fondue place or hot pot restaurant? It forces you to be more interactive with your food, and it’s not formal and stiff. You want to be able to laugh and enjoy yourself, not worried if you’re eating with the right fork. [Read: Top 50 amazing first date ideas to wow your date ] \n#7 Cooking class . If you don’t want to do a traditional dinner, then why not go to a cooking class? If you guys don’t hit it off and there’s no second date, at least you’ll have a new skill to show the next person you go out with. See? Win-win! \n#8 Burlesque show . I highly recommend this idea – it’s one of the best things to do on a date. I went on a date where we went to a burlesque show and it was the best date I’ve ever been on. Don’t go if your date is more conservative, because it might freak them out. But burlesque shows are amazing and so fun to watch.

But, salsa or any other kind of dance class is a great way to interact with your partner and show them your moves. You also get to touch them… hehe… that’s right. \n#10 Go-karting . I have road rage, so I almost killed my date. However, I had a great time. Go-karting is so fun, and although it’s not super personal, it’s fun. \nYou’ll have something to talk about after and then you can go for a beer or for food. Plus, it’s a great way to unleash your rage – just make sure your date doesn’t see you becoming too possessed behind the wheel. [Read: 15 of the most memorable things to do on a first date ] \n#11 Stargazing. This is a really romantic idea – one that I’ve tried out. I highly recommend it. Bring a blanket, perhaps a bottle of wine, and just stare the stars. You don’t need a lot of money to do this, and it’s a very good idea if you really want to get to know them. Maybe even sneak in a kiss or two. Now that’s one of the most romantic things to do on a date. [Read: Creatively cheap – 12 perfect date ideas to have fun on a budget ] \n#12 Kayaking . If your date is into the outdoors, why not go kayaking? It’s exciting – you may even get to see some whales or seals. But it’s a great way to see nature while getting to know your date. And if there’s some silence, it’s okay, you two are admiring the view. \n#13 Flea market . Flea markets are busy and hectic – they’re full of life. You can bargain and pick up some great stuff. So, wake up early and meet your date at the flea market. You guys can walk around and chat about what you’re seeing. Then go for breakfast. [Read: Things you should never do on a first date ] \n#14 Go for a hike . Strap on your hiking boots, grab a backpack, and fill it with water and snacks. Head on a hike with your date. It doesn’t have to be a 6-hour hike. Just an easy and enjoyable hike that’ll give you some time to admire nature and get to know each other. \n#15 Check out a museum . When you live in your city, you probably don’t think about visiting a museum. I mean, you live there, so you have time to see it. But let’s be honest, you’re not going to visit the museum for no reason. So, why not check it out with your date? If they’re artsy, then it’s even better. This is one of the more heady things to do on a date. \n#16 Drive-in movie. This is a really cute and romantic way to watch a movie. See if your city has a drive-in movie theater. Watch a movie on the big screen from your car. You can bring your own snacks and hang out. This is a better way to watch a movie without giving off the impression that you’re expecting something to happen.

You can take a class together that is out of your comfort zone. Maybe you decide on clay-making or painting – who cares what the class is about? The point is to have fun. \n#18 The beach. Why not have a picnic on the beach? If the weather is warm, you two can even go for a swim. It’s relaxing and isn’t built up as some major event. Which is a great way to reduce the anxiety and awkwardness of first dates. \n#19 See a live show . Is there a band in town that your date likes? Or even better, a show that you both have never heard of? Why not check it out? Sure, it may suck, but that’s what will make it fun.

      "text": "‘Limitless’ To Continue On Netflix? Here's What Showrunner Says By Danny Wilson  30 am “Limitless” Season 2 was officially cancelled by CBS Entertainment last May 2016, but critics and spectators might be finding some pinch hope from another network which could potentially pursue the show – Netflix.(Photo : Celebified / YouTube) \nSeveral months ago, CBS decided to cancel \"Limitless\" Season 2 because of various reasons. The ratings of \"NCIS,\" another crime series from the network eventually overpowered the now-canceled show and reportedly hurt the station. Advertisement \nSome good news awaken the interest of the people surrounding the \"Limitless\" Season 2 cancellation. Glenn Geller, president of CBS Entertainment made an official response about the matter that \"Limitless\" Season 2 could potentially go to another network, Deadline reported. \nOne of the potential networks as perceived by CBS to continue \"Limitless\" Season 2 is Netflix. The popular streaming network has been critically known to pursue movies and series which they see potentials. \nShowrunner Craig Sweeney said via Twitter that the he was saddened by the announcement but still positive about the potentials of \"Limitless.\" This was made in conjunction of the ratings of the \"Limitless\" Season 1 which only earned 1.2 percent in contrast to \"NCIS\" which has 2.2 percent and \"NCIS: New Orleans\" which has 1.8 percent, Hollywood Reporter noted. I'm truly sad to report that #Limitless will not continue on any platform. Thanks so much to everyone who watched. \n— Craig Sweeny (@CraigSweeny) May 25, 2016 \n\"Limitless\" is based from the movie with the same title released in 2014 with Alex Kurtzman and Bob Orci as executive producer. The movie starred Bradley Cooper who is now serving as the Executive Producer and recurring guest star of the series. \n\"Limitless,\" just like its movie version follows a man with an enhanced brain capacity because of a drug he took. The story basically evolves on the same story line with an expanded plot. \nIn total, CBS canceled four out of its seven new shows. Aside from \"Limitless,\" CBS also called off the comedy series \"Angel From Hell\", \"Supergirl\" (now moved to The CW) and \"Rush Hour\" while renewing the shows \"Life in Pieces,\" \"Code Black\" and \"Criminal Minds: Beyond Borders.\" \nThe fans are anxious of what will be the fate of \"Limitless.\" Can we expect a \"Limitless\" Season 2 from Netflix?

      "text": "What's on Netflix > Other > When is Season 4 of Velvet on Netflix? When is Season 4 of Velvet on Netflix? Tweet \nVelvet is among the biggest Spanish-speaking shows on Netflix, and we’ve been inundated with massive amounts of requests looking for the Netflix release date for season 4 of the show which started up in October. Let’s take a look at when Velvet season 4 will be on Netflix. \nVelvet on Netflix is especially valuable at the moment given the other big Spanish show, Gran Hotel, just left Netflix in November 2016. It’s unlikely we’ll see Velvet leave too but it’s still valued more now than ever. \nThe show, which stars one of the biggest stars from Sense8, focusses on a young man called Alberto who’s running a store called Velvet in the 50’s and 60’s and his relationship with one of the seamstresses who works there. It’s rarely available across the world and Netflix carries complete English subtitles for the show too. \nTo determine the season 4 release date of Velvet on Netflix, we first have to look at the previous years and this years release schedule for the show. As of right now, the show is still airing in Spain so it’ll take some time for it to come to Netflix. Season 4 began airing on October 5th, 2016 and is scheduled to wrap up 14th December, 2016. Last year the series aired a little bit earlier but we don’t envision it conflicting with any Netflix release date. \nOn Netflix US, season 3 of Velvet was adding midway through the summer in June 2016 and given how a lot of Netflix contracts working in yearly cycles we can safely predict that the same will happen again this year. So with that said, we can safely say we’ll see season 4 of Velvet on Netflix in June 2017 . \nDo you watch Velvet? Can you wait this long before season 4 airs on Netflix?

      "text": "It might be indelicate to protest in the streets after the Gilmore Girls revival airs on Netflix, but I'm already making signs because I know I won't get the one thing I want: Dave Rygalski.\nDave, played by Seth Cohen Adam Brody, dated Lane for a brief, phantasmagoric spell of Season 3, before Brody sold his soul to Fox for The O.C. and set fire to long string of dynamite which eventually destroyed Lane's entire character arc.\nWe spent too little time with him, yet he remains the best boy any fictitious teenage girl could date — or any very real adult.\nsee also\nDave first showed up in the Season 3 episode \"Application Anxiety\" as part of what would become Lane's band for well beyond Dave's time as a character. They start riffing immediately, talking about obscure bands before he gives her a demo tape with nerdy equipment.\n\"I think a love song's in their future,\" says Rory, before holding hands with Dean and canceling all love songs.\nThe love is a slow-burn; After that first meeting, we glimpse one band practice, and then there is no Dave until episode 7, when Lane anxiously awaits his phone call at the Gilmores' house (Dean is present, displaying all the sensitivity of — well, of Dean).\n\"I'm gonna love him forever,\" says Lane, speaking for all of us.\nThe episode ends with some major moments in Rory's love life (content warning: this is the dance marathon episode), but more importantly, a Dave revelation. He shows up at the dance marathon singing the praises of Mrs. Kim's sandwiches and concocting an elaborate tale about his parents and Bible study.\nThere are some key points made in this scene:\n1) Dave is a great improviser and quick on his feet.\n2) HE IS AMAZING WITH MOMS.\nAs a first generation kid whose friends used decidedly Lane-esque measures to sneak around, I cannot overstate the importance of a boy who looks your immigrant mother in the eye and praises her cooking.\nIn \"A Deep-Fried Korean Thanksgiving,\" Dave goes the extra mile by spending his special day playing hymns for the Kims' luncheon, eating Tofurkey and eventually coming back to retrieve a pocket bible. This of course leads to their first kiss and to the iconic \"BIBLE KISS BIBLE\" page of 2002 that I have sent to multiple friends in my adult life.\nImage: netflix/warner bros.\nDave puts up with a lot for his love of Lane, including fake flyers and Lane's dummy dates with eligible Korean bachelors (remember when he ran a mile because he was jealous of Yiung Chui?). He once read the entire Bible from cover-to-cover in one night, a feat achieved only thrice by Mrs. Kim. He demonstrates an emotional maturity unparalleled by most adult men, and certainly not by the romantically plebeian contemporaries dated by Rory.\nLater in the season, Jess refers to Dave as a \"cool guy,\" which is basically a marriage proposal from 17-year-old Jess Mariano. We tragically never get a Rory-Jess-Lane-Dave double date because Dave and Lane's love is a dirty little secret and Jess isn't allowed to attend the prom. Would Dave's magical presence have made a difference in Rory and Jess's tragically doomed romance? Absolutely yes.\nMy prediction: In the world of Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life , Dave is basically Lane's Sk8er Boi. Not that he wasn't good enough, but now he's a super star, slamming on his guitar, and Lane is the mother of Zack's children, her musical career in limbo. I predict a secret fifth episode of Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life (\"Global Warming\") which follows Dave from the end of Season 3 through to adulthood and his triumphant reunion with Lane (preferably in an airport — or the Stars Hollow gazebo).\nJess attends the wedding. He cries.",
