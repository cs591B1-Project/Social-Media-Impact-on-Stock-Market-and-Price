      "text": "Home | International Business | Trump Hits Out At IBM For Shifting Out Jobs From Minnesota Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has accused American tech giant IBM of laying off 500 workers in Minneapolis and shifting their jobs to India and other countries. Press Trust of India | Last Updated: November 08, 2016 08:06 (IST) Press Trust of India EMAIL COMMENTS Donald Trump said he will levy a 35 per cent tax on companies shifting jobs from US. \nWashington: Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has accused American tech giant IBM of laying off 500 workers in Minneapolis and shifting their jobs to India and other countries, saying he will levy a 35 per cent tax on companies doing so. \"IBM laid off 500 workers in Minneapolis and moved their jobs to India and other countries. A Trump Administration will stop the jobs from leaving America, and we will stop the jobs from leaving Minnesota,\" Trump said in his speech in Minneapolis, as part of efforts to woo voters in Minnesota state which has been a Democrat stronghold. \"If a company wants to leave Minnesota, fire their workers and move to another country and then ship their products back into the United States, we will make them pay a 35 per cent tax. We will also unleash American energy including shale oil, natural gas and clean coal,\" he said. Trump said he will cancel all harmful Obama regulations that hurt Minnesota farmers, workers and small businesses. \"We will become a rich nation once again. But to be a rich nation, we must also be a safe nation,\" he said. He claimed that Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton wants a 550 per cent increase in Syrian Refugees pouring into the US wants virtually unlimited immigration and refugee admissions from the most dangerous regions of the world. \"Her plan will import generations of terrorism, extremism and radicalism into your schools and communities. When I'm elected President, we will suspend the Syrian Refugee Program and we will keep Radical Islamic Terrorists out of our country,\" he added. \"Here, in Minnesota, you've seen firsthand the problems caused with faulty refugee vetting, with large numbers of Somali Refugees coming into your state without your knowledge, support or approval and with some then joining ISIS and spreading their extremist views,\" Trump said. He asserted that a Trump administration will not admit any refugees without the support of the local community where they are being placed. \"And we will pause admissions from terror-prone regions until a full security assessment has been performed, and until proven vetting mechanisms have been established,\" he said. A Trump administration will also secure and defend the borders of the United States, he said reiterating that he will build a wall along the Mexico border. \"Hillary supports totally open borders, and strongly supports Sanctuary Cities like San Francisco where Kate Steinle was murdered by an illegal immigrant deported 5 times. Thousands of Americans would be alive today if not for the open border policies of Obama-Clinton,\" Trump said.

      "text": "Comment 0 \nNext week at WGSN Futures Australia in Melbourne , Andrew Grill from IBM will offer his high-level global perspective on the major influences that are driving digital disruption in retail and across other industries. He’ll also offer his advice about what those companies need to do to stay relevant in this ever-changing landscape. Ahead of our event, we asked him to provide a snippet of what our audience can look forward to, enjoy! \nHere’s 4 key ways that businesses can thrive in this digital landscape, and yes switching your mentality to think more like a start-up business is key: \n1. Stay ahead of the digital disruption curve. \nWe’ll look at why in order to “get digital” you have to “think digital”, and examine how other industries have responded and take advantage of employees who are “born digital” along with those who are “digital ready”. We’ll also look at some disruptive technologies such as cognitive computing and blockchain and explain how you can utilise these in your industry for maximum effect. \n2. Think like a start-up \nHaving run 6 start-ups over the last 12 years both in Australia and the UK, I’ll provide the audience with some insights on how to “think like a start-up”, with some practical tips and tricks to develop an agile culture and put the consumer at the front of all design decisions using a technique known as “design thinking”. \n3. Tame Social Media \nAnother topic that my clients ask me about all the time is about how to tame social media data and turn it into insight. \nOne of my most tweeted quotes from the stage during presentations is the following: \n“Social media is the best piece of market research you NEVER commissioned” \nI’ll provide those at the Melbourne event the reason behind my thinking on this quote and show a live demonstration of the IBM Watson’s personality insights tool to show what intelligence you can derive from the tweets of your customers, celebrities and even your competitors. \n4. Influencers: sort fact from fiction. \nHaving been the CEO of social influencer platform Kred from 2011 – 2013, I have unique experience and exposure to the world, and psychology of influencers. What I saw first-hand and continue to see now is people who TELL you they are influential, and demand a lot of money to promote your products. This has evolved greatly over the last few years and has reached a point where influencers can appear to be as important as celebrities and the press and getting your message out. I’ll help you determine who is truly influential, and who is just noisy. A recent article in the Economist examined what influencers are paid on various platforms. This research is fascinating and shows the sway that influencers now hold with brands. This part of the session is not to be missed. \n\nAndrew Grill is Global Managing Partner for IBM Social Consulting and has spent the last 20+ years working for Australian Telcos, and technology start-ups and now advises IBM’s largest clients on how to become digital. More of Andrew’s thought leadership can be found at LondonCalling.co or on Twitter @AndrewGrill \n\nWGSN Futures Australia is a must-see summit for Retail executives, Marketers, Buyers, Merchandisers and Designers. We will be presenting in Sydney in November 15th and Melbourne in November 18th – don’t miss out. \n",

      "text": "Listen \nThe thousands of young people graduating from Atlantic Canada’s colleges and universities every year shouldn’t have to look for work outside the region’s borders now that technology has made it so much easier for the world to come to them, says Dino Trevisani, president of IBM Canada. Story continues below \nWhile it’s true the region continues to lose young people to out-migration, IBM’s decision to create a series of entrepreneurial hubs with the help of provincial governments, colleges and universities has helped stem the tide of lost talent, Trevisani said in a speech Monday to a group of academics, business leaders and politicians gathered at the Halifax Central Library. \nREAD MORE: Which province lost the most jobs in July? \n“You have 20,000 graduates coming out of colleges and universities every year, and that’s music to our ears when we hear about that kind of talent,” he said. “What better environment to work in than to look out at the bay and participate in the culture, the history and the beauty of this environment – not to mention the lobster. That’s what people are looking for. They’re looking for that lifestyle.” \nTrevisani, who is originally from Hamilton, Ont., said IBM’s Client Innovation Centre in Halifax, which opened in 2013, serves as a good example of how the best talent doesn’t always gravitate to the big cities. \nWhen the centre opened, it had 70 employees and three local clients. A little over three years later, the centre employs 500 people serving more than 30 clients from around the world. \n“That centre is the best performing delivery centre for IBM in the world,” he said. “That’s where our market is. It’s the world. And we want to serve that market from right here with our talented people.” \nHe said the workers in Halifax are young, well-educated, loyal to the company and well paid. \n“They want to stay here and be part of the community,” the senior executive said. “I’m sitting in Toronto saying, ‘They don’t need to come here.’ We can create jobs and opportunities for them there.” \nTrevisani also pointed to the company’s cyber security research and customer support centre in Fredericton, which was established in 2011 after IBM acquired Q1 Labs. Its QRadar security intelligence platform was developed in Fredericton, in partnership with the University of New Brunswick. \nThe acquisition prompted IBM to form its security division, which has grown into a $2-billion business employing 7,500 researchers, developers and security experts in 36 locations worldwide. \n“QRadar is the hottest cyber security product in the world – and it’s built in Fredericton,” said Trevisani. \nThe Fredericton office started with 40 employees. It now has 400. \nTrevisani also cited top-notch work being done in St. John’s, N.L., at the Centre for Health Informatics and Analytics, which was developed in partnership with Memorial University of Newfoundland. \nTrevisani’s 28-year career at IBM has included stints in finance, business management, sales and marketing and global executive assignments. He holds MBAs from both Queen’s University’s School of Business in Kingston, Ont., and Cornell University’s Johnson School of Management in Ithaca, N.Y. \nREAD MORE: Program aims to keep N.S. job seekers in the province \nHe told the crowd his parents left Italy and arrived at the Port of Halifax to start a new life in Canada in 1952. His mother picked fruit and later worked as a cook, and his father worked at the Stelco steel mills in Hamilton. \n“I wish I could have stayed in Hamilton and had a career there,” he said. \nWhen he was hired in early 2015 to oversee IBM Canada’s 14,000 employees, he said he noticed that far too many Canadians were having to uproot themselves to succeed in high-tech. \n“My ambition, when I came here, was to change that,” he said. “That’s been my inspiration.” \nHe said most Canadian universities are doing their part to help, and most provincial governments have stepped up to do the same. \nAs for IBM, he said the company is committed to building entrepreneurial networks by making technology available to universities and colleges, giving students potential access to global markets. \n“That way, they never have to leave Canada … That’s my vision and that’s my aspiration.” © 2016 The Canadian Press ",

The multinational also has data centres in Portsmouth and Chessington. \nIt's currently unclear as to where and when IBM's new data centre will be built. \nThe New York-headquartered company uses a network of data centres worldwide to power its cloud business. \nIBM is building the new UK data centre to meet increasing demand from customers in the region, a source said. \nAlmost all of the major US tech companies now have data centres in the UK or Ireland. Microsoft, Google, Facebook, and Amazon have all opened facilities within the last few years to help them deliver a quicker and smoother experience for heir European users. \nApple is one of the few large US tech companies that is yet to open a data centre in the UK or Ireland. However, it's hoping to build one just outside the small Irish town of Athenry near the west coast of Ireland. \nIBM declined to comment.",

      "text": "Blockchain in Healthcare: IBM at ONC/NIST Blockchain Challenge Workshop November 8, 2016 | Written by: Tony Trenkle \nCategorized: Healthcare Industry Insights Lately there has been a great deal of buzz about Blockchain and its potential uses in various sectors of the economy. Healthcare has been one of the industries that is well-suited to the integration of Blockchain because of the need for strong non-repudiation, clear audit path, and other features that Blockchain offers. The application of Blockchain technology to healthcare took a major step forward recently at a two day workshop at the end of September ( Use of Blockchain in Healthcare and Research Workshop ) co-chaired by the National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST) and the Department of Health Human Services’ (HHS) Office of the National Coordinator (ONC) in Washington, D.C. The sessions were attended by almost two hundred people representing government, industry, and academia. The workshop mainly focused on winning papers from a recent Blockchain challenge, sponsored by the two agencies. IBM was one of the winners of the challenge, with our paper Blockchain: The Chain of Trust and its Potential to Transform Healthcare – Our Point of View . This paper was presented at the workshop by IBM’s Srini Attili, Vice President & Partner, Application Innovation Consulting, US Public Sector & Healthcare and Shahram Ebadollahi, Vice President, Innovations & Chief Science Officer, IBM Watson Health. The major points of the paper are: Blockchain facilitates trust and validates identity without intermediate third parties, enabling an Internet of Value. In healthcare, new research is seeking to apply Blockchain’s distributed ledger and decentralized database solutions to the critical issues of interoperability, security, record universality, and more. Like every technology, Blockchain has limitations and is not suited for application to all scenarios. It is not well suited for high performance (millisecond) transactions involving just one participant with no business network involved, or for replicated database replacement. It is also not useful as a transaction-processing replacement nor for low-value, high-volume transactions. However, as described in the paper, there are many applications where Blockchain has a lot of potential to create great value including: Pre-authorization for health services, counterfeit drug prevention and detection, and clinical trials results. A link to IBM’s paper can be found here . In addition to the IBM presentation, the workshop highlighted a number of innovative Blockchain technologies and other potential use cases. Here is a link to all of the workshop presentations and challenge papers. It is impossible to provide a succinct summary of the workshop but there were several major themes: Blockchain has a lot of potential to create major change in healthcare. The work on use cases in healthcare is very early. Multiple technologies will be part of the overall solutions, depending the use case and the community being served. Today, a large part of the challenge is to bring awareness of Blockchain and its possible uses to the larger healthcare community. Many still have not heard of Blockchain or have only a vague idea of what the technology is. ONC and NIST look at the effort as a public-private partnership and will be following up to continue the education and movement forward. IBM fully supports the efforts of ONC and NIST to explore and promote the vast potential of Blockchain to create major changes in the healthcare industry. We invite you to work with us, ONC, NIST, public and private entities, and academia to bring the promise to fruition.

      "text": "Read More \n\"Once patients show up [at the centre], they are highly complex to get a handle on and we are busy for a couple of days just reviewing the paperwork,\" Schäfer said. \"It is clear to us that either we keep that old way of huge amounts of information on paper and work through it for days and days or weeks, or we set up a new system, where IT support screens the findings and gets out the information.\" \nThe aim in future is to feed all that information into Watson, and let the system crunch the data before arriving at a differential diagnosis -- a list of potential illnesses that all fit the patient's symptoms -- which will be handed to human medical staff to work out which of those conditions the patient has. And, if Watson spots a seemingly anomalous result amongst all the data, it can highlight it so that doctors can follow it up (or disregard it and carry out the test again). \nWhile Watson could theoretically aid further in the diagnosis by weighting each of the illnesses that make up the differential diagnosis according to their likelihood, Schäfer says there may be pitfalls to such an approach. \n\"We are currently discussing if we are going to use this, but this is a risky thing: that if you say this or that is the most likely [condition the patient has], you will focus on this first. But that doesn't help the patient if he is the one percent of patients that have the other [condition]. We need to be sure that if Watson would supply the likelihood, there is a concern that at the end the physician gives up thinking. 'It's 90 percent that it's a myocardial infarction, that's good enough,\" but if it's a one percent chance that it's an aortic dissection, which is also a deadly disease, you take the risk that no one thinks about this. We are discussing currently if we want to use this feature.\" \nThe centre aims to take the Watson system live over the coming months. To help facilitate its diagnoses, the centre will introduce a 1,200-question digital questionnaire that patients fill in. The information they give will be fed into the IBM system to give it an extra insight into factors that could affect the diagnosis, from their symptoms and family history, to the environment they live in, and their jobs. The data will be anonymised before being fed into the IBM Bluemix cloud for processing. Watson will also be able to translate the information provided from German to English to cross reference it against medical information in the language. In future, the system may also be used to make suggestions of further tests that could be carried out to pinpoint the diagnosis by ruling in or out certain conditions. \nCurrently, the system is being tested retrospectively on patients who have already visited the clinic and had their conditions identified to see how it fares. \nThe pilot will last for 12 months and if it proves successful it could be rolled out further across the five sites that Rhön Klinikum owns -- including the University Hospital, the healthcare provider is responsible for 5,300 beds -- in fields potentially including neurology, oncology, or emergency care. \n\"In the long run we are going to apply this in the emergency rooms or the admissions office of all our hospitals, so if patients would show up with certain complaints, there would be maybe 20 or 30 questions that could be answered very quickly to find if they have a life-threatening illness -- do they have shortness of breath, or chest pain, or being unconscious? With this information, in the emergency room, the door would be wide open... if they have chest pain or the signs of a stroke, once we have this information, the system could trigger and page the cardiologist or the neurologist and the radiologist to clear the CT so there are no time lags with these highly critical patients.\" \nPotentially, such remotely managed IT systems could be used as a starting point for the treatment of patients from remote areas where medical personnel are few and far between, or locations that don't have the right specialist for their conditions. Schäfer maintains however that IT systems are a support for highly-trained, enthusiastic physicians, not a replacement for them. \n\"We have more than 6,000 patients on our waiting lists, and we are a rather small centre. We work very long hours. I would say I don't need many more physicians, we need more sophisticated IT support to get a hand on these very special issues. I would never say we don't need any physicians, but I would say where there are things that we can replace these days with technology, we should replace it,\" Schäfer said. \n\"We wouldn't say Watson is better than a physician, we would say Watson is a good help for us, but we are in charge at the end of the day. We have to take care of our patients.\" Read more about IBM Watson",

The “ Accelerating innovation with cloud-native ” page has been changed to include related DevOps architecture and toolchain diagrams and quick-start applications for the cloud.\nBluemix is an implementation of IBM’s Open Cloud Architecture that uses Cloud Foundry to enable the rapid prototyping, deployment and management of cloud applications.\nIBM seeks to give businesses integrating DevOps — the practice of closing the gap between development (Dev) and operations (Ops) teams by emphasizing collaboration and automation — a top-down organizational view of how BlueMix can be used to build cloud-native apps.\nImage credit: Courtesy of IBM, Bluemix Garage Method tracks and practices\nThe updated page includes an interactive quick-reference diagram of the architecture, which guides developers and management through a visualized explanation of how implementations emerge. The diagram includes flow between different modules including “Runtime and containers,” “Monitoring and metrics,” “Alert notifications,” “Build, test and continuous integration,” “Deployment orchestration” and many other milestones in the DevOps toolchain.\nAfter the DevOps team has gotten an understanding of the top level DevOps architecture and it’s time to get down to developing code, the pages also provide sample code. For example, immediately available is a DevOps Tutorial Toolchain sample code set . For more advanced work, developers can also find tutorial code for a “ Sample toolchain ” and for “ Cloud-native toolchain for microservices .”\nThe above toolchain contains everything needed and extendable sample application code written in Node.js Express 4. In the tutorial, developers will also learn how to configure the toolchain and use cloud-native development with DevOps Services on Bluemix.\nIBM also announced plans to continue expanding the Bluemix cloud implementation pages with further guided tutorials on how to use these toolchains, tools and practices in order to develop enterprise-ready solutions.\nFeatured image credit: leyrlo☂ Computer_stock via photopin (license) ",

      "text": "Summary \nIBM introduced new all-flash storage solutions for the development of cognitive applications. \nThe company is depending on storage to boost the adoption of its software suites to a significant extent. \nUnless the company makes its IaaS offerings strong enough, it will deviate from its original goal of becoming a cloud and analytics player. IBM (NYSE: IBM ) has unveiled new all-flash media and software-defined storage solutions for making its storage offerings more compatible with hybrid cloud. The company believes this will help users store data flexibly according to their requirements, i.e., either on-premises, or as software-defined storage, or as a cloud service. IBM's emphasis on storage is an interesting topic, given that IBM's position in the cloud IaaS market is not very strong. Although IBM claims that it is primarily a software company in the field of cloud and analytics, hardware is still a significant part of its business. The business model is somewhat uncoordinated. In this article I will reevaluate IBM's business model in light of the fast changing cloud market dynamics. Data Floodgates Opening: Is IBM Making Right Move? According to Cisco, global datacenter traffic will increase from 3.4 zettabytes in 2014 to 10.4 zettabytes in 2019 (see the Cisco infographic presented below). Dearth of storage capacity in space-constrained datacenters is offering storage vendors significant growth opportunities in the coming years. Image Credit: Cisco The picture was different even couple of years ago, when the use of all-flash storage solutions at the enterprise level was primarily driven by speed, not capacity. However, with the enormous rise of cloud, analytics and artificial intelligence-driven computing, capacity has also become a determining factor today for using all-flash storage solutions in enterprises. According to IDC : \nSpending on all flash deployments continues to grow and help drive the market. The decreasing cost of flash media, coupled with increasing use cases, high density deployments, and availability of flash-based storage products, have resulted in rapid adoption throughout the market. Big Blue is trying to take its storage business to a new level with the launch of all-flash media and software-defined storage solutions. The company started this initiative earlier this year by launching its new Storwize all-flash storage platform targeted at enterprises using the storage solutions of Dell (NYSE: DVMT ) and EMC. IBM was aiming to help them migrate to its own platform at a time when the future of Dell and EMC was uncertain due to their upcoming merger. Despite the company's storage initiative, and given the fact that the cost of all-flash storage products is consistently declining, it increasingly seems that IBM is deviating from its original goal of becoming a cloud and analytics-based software company. What Will Drive IBM's Storage Business? Of course, market demand will drive the company's storage business. However, it's not that simple. Instead of asking what will drive IBM's storage business, we should focus on the rationale behind the company's venture into storage. According to Gartner's Magic Quadrant for IaaS (Infrastructure-as-a-Service), Amazon's (NASDAQ: AMZN ) AWS and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) are two clear leaders in the cloud IaaS market, with IBM mentioned as a niche player. I analyzed the positioning of the two leading players and their opportunities in the market in a previous article . What really is IaaS? According to Gartner : \nInfrastructure as a service (IaaS) is a standardized, highly automated offering, where compute resources, complemented by storage and networking capabilities are owned and hosted by a service provider and offered to customers on-demand. Although IBM is putting an emphasis on storage, which is a significant part of IaaS, beyond SoftLayer IBM's IaaS offering is insignificant. However, IBM's PaaS (Platform-as-a-Service) and SaaS (Software-as-a-Service) services are topnotch; I have no doubt about that. For cost-effectively distributing the services, the company is depending on its incomplete IaaS offerings with strong storage lineup and relatively weak compute and networking lineup. However, I don't believe matching the cost economics of Amazon and Microsoft (they also offer similar PaaS and SaaS products) will be possible for IBM in the long run unless it makes its IaaS offerings complete. IBM's Storage Venture: Is The Future Really Bright? Like every question, there are two sides to this question. As far as competing with storage vendors like Hewlett Packard Enterprise (NYSE: HPE ), EMC and Dell are concerned, I believe IBM's market positioning isn't too bad, which I discussed in a previous article . IBM will leverage storage as a driving force to boost the adoption of its PaaS and SaaS products, as mentioned above. To that end, I don't believe the future of its storage business is too bright. IBM is making huge investments in storage. The company said in 2015 that it will invest $1 billion over the next five years in software-defined storage. In sharp contrast, Microsoft is consistently investing in cloud infrastructure for strengthening its presence in the global IaaS space. I believe IBM should invest in advancing and improving SoftLayer's feature sets instead of making huge investments in storage. SoftLayer is generally used by SMB (small and medium-sized business) customers. Although SoftLayer offers single-tenant and multi-tenant virtualized and bare-metal servers as computing service, the company's bare-metal computing service enjoys more demand, particularly in the SMB space. The bare-metal service is based on open technologies developed by the OpenPOWER Foundation and specialized server technologies developed by Supermicro (NASDAQ: SMCI ). IBM is more interested in offering compute via hardware, i.e., physical servers like System z mainframes, LinuxONE and Power Systems, as part of its hybrid cloud model. In contrast, Amazon and Microsoft don't sell physical servers. As far as networking is concerned, which is an essential part of IaaS, IBM's SoftLayer offers basic networking services for supporting bare-metal environments. IBM's goal is boosting the adoption of its cloud software suites by selling hardware, although the company doesn't explicitly express it. Let me explain with an example. Its Spectrum Storage suite comes with an opportunity to test its hybrid cloud and cognitive applications for free and with a reduced cost of up to 40% for integrated software compared to non-integrated software. Recently IBM announced that it will expand and advance its storage services in late 2017 via offering storage solutions on Bluemix based on Intel's (NASDAQ: INTC ) 3D XPoint SSDs, which is a kind of storage-class non-volatile memory. IBM's announcements nowadays are more focused on Bluemix, and less on SoftLayer. As a long-term IBM investor, I would love to see IBM talking more about SoftLayer than Bluemix. Conclusion With the rising adoption of CaaS (Compute-as-a-Service) as a part of IaaS driven by FPGAs and GPUs, the demand for IBM's physical servers isn't expected to see much growth going ahead. Unless Big Blue takes IaaS, particularly CaaS, seriously, its storage endeavor won't be able to make it a complete player in the field of cloud and analytics.

      "title": "How to flash a LSI SAS 3008 HBA (e.g. IBM M1215) to IT mode",
      "text": "by Patrick Kennedy November 8, 2016 \nIf you are looking to get a new host bus adapter (HBA) the LSI SAS3008 controller is perhaps the most popular 12gbps SAS controller on the market. It supports features such as the LSI DataBolt which lets you utilize higher bandwidth uplinks with compatible SAS expanders and 6gbps drives. It also features significantly better performance than the SAS2008 and SAS2308 generations when using the HBA with 8x SSDs. Although there are many “RAID” enabled (IR) SAS 3008 controllers out there, oftentimes what you want is a simple HBA. For applications with software managing redundancy such as ZFS, md raid, and Ceph you will want IT firmware. IT firmware essentially allows the controller to present attached disks to the system and stops the hardware controller from getting in the way. \nFor this guide, we are going to use the IBM/ Lenovo M1215 adapter. These are popular OEM SAS HBAs that have SAS 3008 controller chips onboard. They are usually flashed to IR mode so they do need to be updated to the latest firmware. Although they are essentially equivalent to the LSI SAS9340-8i and functionally equivalent to the LSI SAS 9300-8i save for different connector orientation, they are much less expensive. We commonly find the IBM M1215 for under $100 while the SAS 9340-8i and 9300-8i commonly sell for over $260. In systems where you are using three cards per chassis, that is a $450 savings for completing these simple steps that will take under 5 minutes per card. This is very similar to what we saw years ago with the SAS2008 generation and the IBM M1015 . \nWarning: Before proceeding, do note that this is a risky process. Issues with firmware flashes can render your card “bricked” and unusable/ unrecoverable. We will not be held responsible if this happens to your card. By following this guide, you accept all risks of damaging your card. Step 1: Getting the Files \nCurrently, we are using the Broadcom/ Avago/ LSI P13 firmware for our HBAs which is the latest available. Many users prefer P10 firmware due to it being older and better known. You can simply replace P13 with P10 if you want to flash P10 firmware instead. Since LSI was acquired by Avago which merged with Broadcom, the download pages seem to change often. If the download links change, you should look for the SAS 9300-8i downloads. Currently, that is located here . SAS3_UEFI_BSD_P13 \nThe key files you want to end up with are: sas3flsh.efi or sas3flash.efi SAS9300_8i_IT.bin (you do NOT want to use the IR bin) mptsas3.rom mpt3x64.rom \nTake these three files and copy them to a USB thumb drive. We are going to use an UEFI shell to perform the flash so there is no need to use a DOS boot disk. Place that USB thumb drive in a USB port of the server you will use to flash. \nPlease note, if you have sas3flsh.efi instead of sas3flash.efi remove the “a” from the following commands. You should also be able to utilize tab autocompletion after “sas3f” which will make that difference moot. You can also rename sas3flsh.efi to sas3flash.efi if you want to follow the below exactly. Step 2: Preparing the Adapter \nThe first step we need to do is to put a jumper on J6 we want to reset the firmware and ensure we have a successful flash. Here is the jumper you need to connect: IBM M1215 LSI SAS3008 HBA Jumper On And Off \nOne other tip we have is to use your mobile phone to take a picture of the SAS Address sticker usually located on the rear of the card. We will show another way to get the SAS address but this is useful in the event you forget it later. Example LSI SAS3008 SAS Address Sticker \nAfter this is in place, take the controller and place it in the motherboard. Although we are going to need to access it again, ensure that it has proper cooling. Step 3: Booting the Server and Resetting the Adapter \nBoot the server you are using to an UEFI shell. Most major manufacturers include this option in their BIOS boot menu. \nOnce in the UEFI shell you will change to the USB drive (in our case “fs1:”). You will likely want to note the SAS address first. \nsas3flash.efi -list \nThat will give you output similar to the following. If it does not, we may suggest using your smartphone for a quick picture as noted in Step 2. SAS 3008 Flash Sas3flash List Result \nNote the SAS Address as we will use it later. If you took a picture of the SAS address sticker, you may not need this. \nsas3flash.efi -f SAS9300_8i_IT.bin -noreset UEFI LSI SAS 3008 Reset Adapter \nThe process will take a minute or two to complete. When it is done, power down the server. \nNow that this is complete, you should remove the J6 jumper installed on Step 2. Step 4: Flashing the Controller \nAgain, boot the server to the UEFI shell. Now you can navigate back to the USB drive. The first command we will use is erasing the flash region on the card. Here is the command you will need. \nsas3flash.efi -o -e 7 UEFI LSI SAS 3008 Flash Erase Current \nNow it is time to flash the controller. We are also going to flash the BIOS files in the event we want to boot from the device later. \nsas3flash.efi -f SAS9300_8i_IT.bin -b mptsas3.rom -b mpt3x64.rom UEFI LSI SAS 3008 Flash Firmware \nFinally, you will likely want to add the SAS address back to the controller. If you were to do sas3flash.efi -list now you would see the SAS address represented as all zeros. To do this we use the SAS address from the photo in Step 2 or using the old -list output in Step 3. Replace the address string without dashes or spaces: \nsas3flash.efi -o -sasadd 50060 UEFI LSI SAS 3008 Sasadd \nAfter this is complete, you can do sas3flash.efi -list and see the card is reported as a SAS 9300-8i with the proper address. Congratulations, you are ready to go after a reboot. LSI SAS 3008 IT Mode Success! Final Words \nNow that the controller is ready to go, it is suitable to be used for ZFS storage platforms such as FreeNAS, ZFS on Linux, napp-it plus OmniOS or others. This is also the preferred mode if you are using scale-out storage systems such as Ceph. Overall, this is a great way to save money on HBAs which can get quite expensive across many nodes and in large single nodes. With the current pricing of SAS3 HBAs we are starting to recommend them over their SAS2 counterparts. They are better able to handle the IOPS of several SSDs and provide more host bandwidth as well as more bandwidth to attached drives and drives located on expanders. \nWe will note that depending on your distribution, you may want to start with P10 firmware. It is much easier to upgrade firmware than it is to downgrade firmware. Check with the distribution of your choice and find the recommended LSI firmware version. \nOur current pick of the IBM M1215 for under $100 is based on the fact that they are readily available, inexpensive, basically identical to the 9340-8i and are straightforward to flash. There are some other options out there but this is a good bet given those factors. If you have a more generic card such as a LSI brand 9300-8i or 9340-8i in IR mode you can skip steps 2 and 3. \nRelated posts:",

      "title": "IBM's CEO Rometty Touts Transparent Governance for Blockchain",
      "text": "IBM's CEO Rometty Touts Transparent Governance for Blockchain   Ginni Rometty , CEO of IBM , calls for a system of transparent governance for blockchain in a recent Wall Street Journal Commentary . Rometty predicts that blockchain, once widely adopted, will transform the world. She notes what readers of this blog already know, that financial institutions have become the early adopters of distributed ledger technologies. However, blockchain’s potential is much, much greater than in fintech alone. For example, IBM has estimated that applying blockchain to global supply chains could result in more than $100 billion in annual efficiencies. She describes projects in which blockchain is used in car leasing and ride-sharing in order to speed up the transactions and cut out newly-redundant intermediaries like Uber and Lyft. In order for us to achieve all of the vast potential of blockchain, Rometty argues that the new technology needs a system of transparent governance developed by not-for-profit groups similar to the way the internet was developed in the 1990s. She notes that IBM and more than 600 firms have joined or applied to join the Linux Foundation’s Hyperledger , an open source collaborative effort created to advance cross-industry blockchain technologies. Hyperledger is attempting to create communities of software developers building blockchain frameworks and platforms to ensure the transparency, longevity, interoperability and support needed to bring blockchain into mainstream commercial adoption. Rometty believes this effort will give businesses the confidence to widely adopt blockchain. Rometty’s final challenge to readers is to ask themselves, are they going to be the disrupter or the disrupted when it comes to blockchain.

      "text": "Data Centers In the future of the data center, IBM is betting big on cognitive computing IBM's Mac Devine spoke at the 2016 Structure Conference on how IoT, big data, and cognitive computing are changing the way that enterprises are approaching their infrastructure. By Conner Forrest | November 8, 2016, 1:36 PM PST Google Plus Image: iStockphoto/Petrovich9 \nIBM is known for its cognitive computing platform, Watson, and its work on the Jeopardy game show. However, IBM's Mac Devine explained at the 2016 Structure Conference on Tuesday, that IBM's efforts in cognitive computing, big data, and IoT go beyond mere fun and games, and have real impact in the data center. \nPart of this is driven by what Devine called the \"move from data centers to centers of data.\" People have traditionally used the data center as a large data repository, upon which they can then use data science and analysis. But, he said, IBM wants to extend that and leverage new technologies to create a \"cognitive loop,\" where they can generate more insights at the edge and in real time. \nWatson is IBM's brand through which they provide some of those cognitive insights. Currently, IBM Watson has 12 primary industry verticals for which they provide insights and services. \nSEE: IBM Watson: The smart person's guide \nThe traditional legacy client-server model was a North-South data pattern, but a smarter connected world moves to an East-West data pattern as more servers and machines continue to communicate with each other, Devine said. Additionally, he noted, communication needs to increasingly be done in real time or near real time. \nWhen you look at business today, Devine said that there is a lot of subjectivity that creates blind spots where certain industry segments have their data segmented from their backend systems. Cognitive solutions need to help remove the blind spots, so all businesses can get rid of their subjectivity and get better insights from their data. Data Center Must-Reads",

Credit: IBM Use   IDG News Service | Nov 8, 2016 12:39 PM   \nGoogle, Amazon and Facebook can magically recognize images and voices, thanks to superfast servers equipped with GPUs in their mega data centers. \nBut not all companies can afford that level of resources for deep learning, so they turn to cloud services, where servers in remote data centers do the heavy lifting. \nMicrosoft has made such cloud services trendy with Azure and is one of the few companies offering remote servers with GPUs, which excel in machine-learning tasks. But Azure uses older Nvidia GPUs, and it now has competition from Nimbix, which offers a cloud service with faster GPUs based on the Nvidia's latest Pascal architecture. \nAfter renting time on the cloud service, customers get a virtual machine with access to bare-metal server hardware. Nimbix offers customers cloud services that run on Tesla P100s -- which are among Nvidia's fastest GPUs -- in IBM Power S822LC servers. \nThere are other advantages to the cloud service. On the server side, a high-speed NVLink interconnect links the GPU to the CPU and other components at speeds 2.5 times faster than PCI-Express 3.0. \nMicrosoft's Azure offers cloud services with servers running Nvidia's Tesla K80, which is based on the older Kepler architecture, and Tesla M40, which is based on Maxwell, a generation behind Pascal. \nTypically, machine-learning tasks use many servers, and faster CPUs and GPUs return faster results. The IBM Power S822LC servers have two Power8 CPUs, four Pascal GPUs, and half a terabyte of system memory. \nThe Nimbix cloud service is targeted more toward high-performance computing applications. It also supports Caffe, Torch and Theano deep-learning frameworks. Pricing starts at $5 per hour. RELATED TOPICS",

      "text": "Virtuozzo has announced a new CEO in the shape of 48-year old former SoftLayer and IBM executive George Karidis, who assumes his first leadership role.\nVirtuozzo came into being as a standalone company after spinning out of Parallels International GmbH. Last year, and offers a complete portfolio of open-source and commercial virtualization products, including an optimized KVM hypervisor, software-defined storage and container offerings.\nThe growth of virtualization, cloud, and now, containers has made enterprise IT increasingly complex. As such, it’s difficult for a company like Virtuozzo to accurately position its products, which are essentially competing against the hypervisor offerings of companies like VMware Inc. and others. And that’s what Karidis intends to work on, he said in an interview with Geekwire .\n“The focus for me over the next few months is locking in our message,” the new CEO said. “We have to show why our view of the world is different and why our enterprise accounts have adopted our technology — for the isolation, the security, the ability to control how elements get deployed in a much more seamless way (than with hypervisors).”\nTo that end, Karidis is hoping to leverage the renewed energy and buzz around software containers to expose his new company to different partners, and get its virtualization products into new hands.\n“The container phenomenon has opened up a huge and disruptive opportunity in the virtualization market, and Virtuozzo is at the heart of it with its proven, production-ready containers, and new solutions for virtual machines and storage,” Karidis said in a statement. “I’m thrilled to join the team and look forward to the journey ahead with our people, partners and customers.”\nPrior to joining Virtuozzo, Karidis served as president of cloud technology services at CompuCom Systems Inc. He ran the firm’s cloud business unit for around 18 months after leaving IBM, which he joined when Big Blue acquired SoftLayer back in 2013. At SoftLayer, Karidis served as the company’s Chief Operating Officer and Chief Strategy Officer.",

Credit: IBM Use commas to separate multiple email addresses From Your message has been sent. Sorry IDG News Service | Nov 8, 2016 12:17 PM PT RELATED TOPICS Comments \nGoogle, Amazon, and Facebook can magically recognize images and voices, thanks to superfast servers equipped with GPUs in their mega data centers. \nBut not all companies can afford that level of resources for deep learning, so they turn to cloud services, where servers in remote data centers do the heavy lifting. \nMicrosoft has made such cloud services trendy with Azure and is one of the few companies offering remote servers with GPUs, which excel in machine-learning tasks. But Azure uses older Nvidia GPUs, and it now has competition from Nimbix, which offers a cloud service with faster GPUs based on the Nvidia's latest Pascal architecture. \n[ Download the State of the CIO 2016 report ] \nAfter renting time on the cloud service, customers get a virtual machine with access to bare-metal server hardware. Nimbix offers customers cloud services that run on Tesla P100s -- which are among Nvidia's fastest GPUs -- in IBM Power S822LC servers. \nThere are other advantages to the cloud service. On the server side, a high-speed NVLink interconnect links the GPU to the CPU and other components at speeds 2.5 times faster than PCI-Express 3.0. \nMicrosoft's Azure offers cloud services with servers running Nvidia's Tesla K80, which is based on the older Kepler architecture, and Tesla M40, which is based on Maxwell, a generation behind Pascal. \nTypically, machine-learning tasks use many servers, and faster CPUs and GPUs return faster results. The IBM Power S822LC servers have two Power8 CPUs, four Pascal GPUs, and half a terabyte of system memory. \nThe Nimbix cloud service is targeted more toward high-performance computing applications. It also supports Caffe, Torch, and Theano deep-learning frameworks. Pricing starts at US$5 per hour. RELATED TOPICS",

      "title": "Polsat TV Speeds Up Content Delivery With IBM Cloud’s Aspera Technology",
      "text": "Contact(s) information \nWarsaw, Poland - 09 Nov 2016: IBM (NYSE: IBM ) announced today that -Telewizja Polsat has selected IBM Aspera to provide a complete set of solutions that will significantly improve the way content is ingested from local producers and global correspondents to their broadcast station. IBM Aspera has replaced using external media, like tapes, hard disks and DVD's and other slow and ineffective methods of transfers. Telewizja Polsat, established in 1992, is the biggest commercial broadcaster in Poland. The company broadcasts more than 30 channels and belongs to Cyfrowy Polsat Group, the biggest media-and -telecommunications group in Poland. Telewizja Polsat collaborates with 40 Polish production houses and content producers that submit programs, series and movies in a specific HD format for transmission every day. In addition, the broadcaster works closely with global news and sports producers, which also send the latest up-to date reports and announcements from all over the world. One hour of TV content alone usually consists of 25 GB of data, reaching approximately 12 TB of content every month. \nPreviously, this volume of content was delivered on external media, such as tapes, hard disks and DVDs, or transferred using FTP. However, after deploying a tapeless production and broadcast system several years ago, Telewizja Polsat realized their previous transfer methods were too slow and ineffective, involving too many people carrying out the work manually. In addition, its past transfer methods had become impractical due to the growing size of digital media, as well as additional new locations and signed contracts with new content providers. \nThat's when Telewizja Polsat started to look for software-based alternatives of delivering digital content in a fast, reliable and secure manner. After an initial evaluation, Telewizja Polsat decided to deploy IBM Aspera technology at the studio’s headquarters in Warsaw. Today IBM Aspera provides an integral solution for gathering TV content, enabling high-speed transfer of multi-gigabyte digital assets and real-time collaboration with geographically distributed news and sports correspondents. The intuitive web interface enables new content providers and correspondents to start transferring files immediately without the need to learn a complicated system. \n\"Our broadcast depends on IBM Aspera every day,” says Andrzej Szymański, IT/TV manager at Telewizja Polsat. “Sometimes content comes in within days of a planned broadcast, which previously require a long process of acceptance and control to be performed in a very short time frame. Aspera drastically reduces the time it takes for us to receive the content, shortening the end-to-end workflow and ensuring we can have content ready to go in time for transmission on our channels,” adds Andrzej Szymanski. \nBased on the patented FASP® high-speed file transport technology, the IBM Aspera solution enables Telewizja Polsat to handle the daily file uploads, ingest and sharing workflows with greater speed, security and efficiency. Aspera Connect Server powers high-speed file transfers from local content producers and global correspondents to Telewizja Polsat, while Aspera’s Web-based Console provides a comprehensive management environment for monitoring and prioritizing content transfers. \n\"Broadcasters like Telewizja Polsat are always striving to deliver the highest quality programming.”–says Michelle Munson, CEO and co-founder Aspera.„Faster content acquisition and shorter end-to-end workflows with the IBM Aspera technology allows them to meet their tight production schedules and broadcast news and reports when they are still relevant to their growing audiences ”. \nWith IBM Aspera technology, globally dispersed correspondents at Telewizja Polsat in the US, Russia, Germany, Italy, Belgium and around the world, can submit raw and final shots via their mobile devices directly to Polsat for automatic transfer to newsrooms or sports production systems. Aspera’s intuitive email-style interface allows individual contributors to quickly upload large video files without requiring any technical expertise. The integrated notifications alert team members when content has been successfully delivered and downloaded. \nAbout Telewizja Polsat \nTelewizja Polsat was the first commercial television station in Poland and today is one of Poland’s two leading private television groups in terms of revenue and share in the TV advertising market. POLSAT, its flagship channel, is one of Poland’s leading channels in terms of audience share. It airs a broad variety of movies, Polish and foreign series, great music events, talent shows realized based on license agreements as well as sports offer and became one of the Polish audience most favorite TV stations. \nOwing to a very attractive program offer which reaches audiences in more than 98% of households Polsat has one of the most valuable and recognizable brand in Poland. The strongest foundations of the broadcaster are: perfect entertainment, fascinating film offer, reliable and fast news as well as exciting sport. \nAbout Aspera \nAspera, an IBM company, is the creator of next-generation transport technologies that move the world's data at maximum speed regardless of file size, transfer distance and network conditions.

      "title": "IBM Launches Experimental Platform for Embedding Watson into Any Device",
      "text": " 00 AM EST IBM Launches Experimental Platform for Embedding Watson into Any Device \nSAN FRANCISCO , Nov. 9, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- IBM (NYSE: IBM ) today unveiled the experimental release of Project Intu, a new, system-agnostic platform designed to enable embodied cognition. The new platform allows developers to embed Watson functions into various end-user device form factors, offering a next generation architecture for building cognitive-enabled experiences. \nProject Intu, in its experimental form, is now accessible via the Watson Developer Cloud and also available on Intu Gateway and GitHub . \nProject Intu simplifies the process for developers wanting to create cognitive experiences in various form factors such as spaces, avatars, robots or other IoT devices, and it extends cognitive technology into the physical world. The platform enables devices to interact more naturally with users, triggering different emotions and behaviors and creating more meaningful and immersive experience for users. \nDevelopers can simplify and integrate Watson services, such as Conversation, Language and Visual Recognition, with the capabilities of the \"device\" to, in essence, act out the interaction with the user. Instead of a developer needing to program each individual movement of a device or avatar, Project Intu makes it easy to combine movements that are appropriate for performing specific tasks like assisting a customer in a retail setting or greeting a visitor in a hotel in a way that is natural for the end user. \nTypically, developers must make architectural decisions about how to integrate different cognitive services into an end-user experience – such as what actions the systems will take and what will trigger a device's particular functionality. Project Intu offers developers a ready-made environment on which to build cognitive experiences running on a wide variety of operating systems – from Raspberry PI to MacOS, Windows to Linux machines, to name a few. As an example, IBM has worked with Nexmo, the Vonage API platform, to demonstrate the ways Intu can be integrated with both Watson and third-party APIs to bring an additional dimension to cognitive interactions via voice-enabled experiences using Nexmo's Voice API's support of websockets. \nThe growth of cognitive-enabled applications is sharply accelerating. IDC recently estimated that \"by 2018, 75 percent of developer teams will include Cognitive/AI functionality in one or more applications/services.\" * This is a dramatic jump from last year's prediction that 50 percent of developers would leverage cognitive/AI functionality by 2018. \n\"IBM is taking cognitive technology beyond a physical technology interface like a smartphone or a robot toward an even more natural form of human and machine interaction,\" said Rob High , IBM Fellow, VP and CTO, IBM Watson. \"Project Intu allows users to build embodied systems that reason, learn and interact with humans to create a presence with the people that use them – these cognitive-enabled avatars and devices could transform industries like retail, elder care, and industrial and social robotics.\" \nProject Intu is a continuation of IBM's work in the field of embodied cognition, drawing on advances from IBM Research, as well as the application and use of cognitive and IoT technologies. Making Project Intu available to developers as an experimental offering to experiment with and provide feedback will serve as the basis for further refinements as it moves toward beta. \nAbout IBM Watson: Pioneering a New Era of Computing Watson represents a new era in computing called cognitive computing, where systems understand the world in a way more similar to humans: through senses, learning, and experience. Watson continuously learns from previous interactions, gaining in value and knowledge over time. With the help of Watson, organizations are harnessing the power of cognitive computing to transform industries, help professionals do their jobs better, and solve important challenges. As part of IBM's strategy to accelerate the growth of cognitive computing, Watson is open to the world, allowing a growing community of developers, students, entrepreneurs and tech enthusiasts to easily tap into the most advanced and diverse cognitive computing platform available today. Watson solutions are being built, used and deployed in more than 45 countries and across 20 different industries. \nFor more information on IBM Watson, visit: ibm.com/Watson and ibm.com/press/watson .

      "text": " 00 AM EST IBM and Topcoder Bring Watson to More than One Million Developers \nSAN FRANCISCO , Nov. 9, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- At the IBM (NYSE: IBM ) Watson Developer Conference, IBM announced a partnership with Topcoder, the premier global software development community comprised of more than one million designers, developers, data scientists, and competitive programmers, to advance learning opportunities for cognitive developers who are looking to harness the power of Watson to create the next generation of artificial intelligence apps, APIs, and solutions. This partnership also benefits businesses that gain access to an increased talent pool of developers through the Topcoder Marketplace with experience in cognitive computing and Watson. \nTopcoder challenges are submitted to the community, and collaboration, competition and peer review ensure the best innovations and solutions rise to the top. Topcoder hosts 7,000 code challenges a year and has awarded $80 million to its community. This disruptive model for learning and delivering new solutions is highly regarded by developers and businesses alike for its ability to motivate through competition and peer review, resulting in coding confidence and new career opportunities for individuals. \nThe IBM and Topcoder partnership will make Watson and IBM Cloud services available to the Topcoder Community. Through Topcoder-run hackathons and coding competitions, participants can easily access a range of Watson services – such as Conversation, Sentiment Analysis or speech APIs – to build powerful new tools with the help of cognitive computing and artificial intelligence. Developers will have the opportunity to showcase and monetize their solutions on the IBM Marketplace , while businesses will be able to access a new pipeline of talent experienced with Watson. \n1 According to Forrester VP and Principal Analyst JP Gownder, by 2019, automation will change every job category by at least 25 percent. Additionally, IDC predicts that 75 percent of developer teams will include cognitive/AI functionality in one or more applications by 2018 2 . The industry is driving toward a new level of computing potential not witnessed since the introduction of Big Data. \n\"The potential of Watson to transform the way we work and live is unlimited. The artificial intelligence revolution presents developers, entrepreneurs and mid-career programmers with an opportunity to create innovation at a level we've never seen before,\" said Willie Tejada , IBM Chief Developer Advocate. \"This partnership expands the Watson Developer Community and Watson's capabilities to the more than 1 million Topcoder contributors, creating a collaborative and competitive environment where individuals can learn and advance their careers while accelerating next-generation technology development for all.\" \nThis partnership continues IBM's commitment to equip developers with the educational resources they need. In addition to a variety of academic partnerships, IBM recently announced the introduction of an AI Nanodegree program with Udacity, to help developers establish a foundational understanding of artificial intelligence. In addition, IBM offers the IBM Learning Lab , which features more than 100 curated online courses and cognitive uses cases from providers like Codeacademy, Coursera, Big Data University, and Udacity. As well as, IBM DeveloperWorks , which offers how-to tutorials and courses on IBM tools and open standard technologies for all phases of the app development lifecycle. \n\"Since 2008, Topcoder and IBM have successfully collaborated on innovative technology initiatives that reflect a shared commitment to disrupting the norm, and serve as a positive catalyst for change to the people, processes and industries we touch,\" said Mike Morris , CEO for Topcoder. \"The extension of our relationship through 2019 demonstrates continued support for the Topcoder and IBM communities that lead the world in cognitive computing and artificial intelligence skills. That high caliber of development talent is what's required today in order for customers to develop the most progressive industry solutions for tomorrow.\" \nTopcoder provides leading companies with on-demand access to the people and skills needed to stay ahead.

      "text": "IBM Launches Experimental Platform for Embedding Watson into Any Device Developers can extend Watson speech, language, vision and empathy capabilities to new form factors  00   SAN FRANCISCO , Nov.   IBM (NYSE: IBM ) today unveiled the experimental release of Project Intu, a new, system-agnostic platform designed to enable embodied cognition. The new platform allows developers to embed Watson functions into various end-user device form factors, offering a next generation architecture for building cognitive-enabled experiences. Project Intu, in its experimental form, is now accessible via the Watson Developer Cloud and also available on Intu Gateway and GitHub . Project Intu simplifies the process for developers wanting to create cognitive experiences in various form factors such as spaces, avatars, robots or other IoT devices, and it extends cognitive technology into the physical world. The platform enables devices to interact more naturally with users, triggering different emotions and behaviors and creating more meaningful and immersive experience for users. Developers can simplify and integrate Watson services, such as Conversation, Language and Visual Recognition, with the capabilities of the \"device\" to, in essence, act out the interaction with the user. Instead of a developer needing to program each individual movement of a device or avatar, Project Intu makes it easy to combine movements that are appropriate for performing specific tasks like assisting a customer in a retail setting or greeting a visitor in a hotel in a way that is natural for the end user. Typically, developers must make architectural decisions about how to integrate different cognitive services into an end-user experience – such as what actions the systems will take and what will trigger a device's particular functionality. Project Intu offers developers a ready-made environment on which to build cognitive experiences running on a wide variety of operating systems – from Raspberry PI to MacOS, Windows to Linux machines, to name a few. As an example, IBM has worked with Nexmo, the Vonage API platform, to demonstrate the ways Intu can be integrated with both Watson and third-party APIs to bring an additional dimension to cognitive interactions via voice-enabled experiences using Nexmo's Voice API's support of websockets. The growth of cognitive-enabled applications is sharply accelerating. IDC recently estimated that \"by 2018, 75 percent of developer teams will include Cognitive/AI functionality in one or more applications/services.\" * This is a dramatic jump from last year's prediction that 50 percent of developers would leverage cognitive/AI functionality by 2018. \"IBM is taking cognitive technology beyond a physical technology interface like a smartphone or a robot toward an even more natural form of human and machine interaction,\" said Rob High , IBM Fellow, VP and CTO, IBM Watson. \"Project Intu allows users to build embodied systems that reason, learn and interact with humans to create a presence with the people that use them – these cognitive-enabled avatars and devices could transform industries like retail, elder care, and industrial and social robotics.\" Project Intu is a continuation of IBM's work in the field of embodied cognition, drawing on advances from IBM Research, as well as the application and use of cognitive and IoT technologies. Making Project Intu available to developers as an experimental offering to experiment with and provide feedback will serve as the basis for further refinements as it moves toward beta.

      "text": "IBM and Topcoder Bring Watson to More than One Million Developers IBM bridges skills gap in artificial intelligence through hands-on hackathons and coding competitions  00   SAN FRANCISCO , Nov.   At the IBM (NYSE: IBM ) Watson Developer Conference, IBM announced a partnership with Topcoder, the premier global software development community comprised of more than one million designers, developers, data scientists, and competitive programmers, to advance learning opportunities for cognitive developers who are looking to harness the power of Watson to create the next generation of artificial intelligence apps, APIs, and solutions. This partnership also benefits businesses that gain access to an increased talent pool of developers through the Topcoder Marketplace with experience in cognitive computing and Watson. Topcoder challenges are submitted to the community, and collaboration, competition and peer review ensure the best innovations and solutions rise to the top. Topcoder hosts 7,000 code challenges a year and has awarded $80 million to its community. This disruptive model for learning and delivering new solutions is highly regarded by developers and businesses alike for its ability to motivate through competition and peer review, resulting in coding confidence and new career opportunities for individuals. The IBM and Topcoder partnership will make Watson and IBM Cloud services available to the Topcoder Community. Through Topcoder-run hackathons and coding competitions, participants can easily access a range of Watson services – such as Conversation, Sentiment Analysis or speech APIs – to build powerful new tools with the help of cognitive computing and artificial intelligence. Developers will have the opportunity to showcase and monetize their solutions on the IBM Marketplace , while businesses will be able to access a new pipeline of talent experienced with Watson. 1 According to Forrester VP and Principal Analyst JP Gownder, by 2019, automation will change every job category by at least 25 percent. Additionally, IDC predicts that 75 percent of developer teams will include cognitive/AI functionality in one or more applications by 2018 2 . The industry is driving toward a new level of computing potential not witnessed since the introduction of Big Data. \"The potential of Watson to transform the way we work and live is unlimited. The artificial intelligence revolution presents developers, entrepreneurs and mid-career programmers with an opportunity to create innovation at a level we've never seen before,\" said Willie Tejada , IBM Chief Developer Advocate. \"This partnership expands the Watson Developer Community and Watson's capabilities to the more than 1 million Topcoder contributors, creating a collaborative and competitive environment where individuals can learn and advance their careers while accelerating next-generation technology development for all.\" This partnership continues IBM's commitment to equip developers with the educational resources they need. In addition to a variety of academic partnerships, IBM recently announced the introduction of an AI Nanodegree program with Udacity, to help developers establish a foundational understanding of artificial intelligence. In addition, IBM offers the IBM Learning Lab , which features more than 100 curated online courses and cognitive uses cases from providers like Codeacademy, Coursera, Big Data University, and Udacity. As well as, IBM DeveloperWorks , which offers how-to tutorials and courses on IBM tools and open standard technologies for all phases of the app development lifecycle. \"Since 2008, Topcoder and IBM have successfully collaborated on innovative technology initiatives that reflect a shared commitment to disrupting the norm, and serve as a positive catalyst for change to the people, processes and industries we touch,\" said Mike Morris , CEO for Topcoder. \"The extension of our relationship through 2019 demonstrates continued support for the Topcoder and IBM communities that lead the world in cognitive computing and artificial intelligence skills. That high caliber of development talent is what's required today in order for customers to develop the most progressive industry solutions for tomorrow.\" Topcoder provides leading companies with on-demand access to the people and skills needed to stay ahead.

      "title": "IBM’s Project Intu brings Watson’s capabilities to any device",
      "text": "IBM is beefing up its cognitive computing efforts with the launch of a new system-agnostic platform called Project Intu that’s designed to enable what it calls “embodied cognition” in a range of devices.\nIn IBM’s parlance, “cognitive computing” refers to machine learning. The idea behind Project Intu is that developers will be able to use the platform to embed the various machine learning functions offered by IBM’s Watson service into various applications and devices, and make them work across a wide spectrum of form factors.\nSo, for example, developers will be able to use Project Intu’s capabilities to embed machine learning capabilities into pretty much any kind of device, from avatars to drones to robots and just about any other kind of Internet of Things’ device. As a result, these devices will be able to “interact more naturally” with users via a range of emotions and behaviors, leading to more meaningful and immersive experiences for users, IBM said.\nOne of the best examples of where Project Intu might be able to help out developers is in the area of conversation, language and visual recognition. Here, developers can integrate Watson’s abilities with a device’s capabilities to effectively “act out” interactions with users. So, rather than the developer having to program each device or avatar’s individual movements, Project Intu does it for them, combining movements that are appropriate for the specific task the device or avatar is performing, such as greeting a visitor at a hotel, or helping out a customer in a retail store.\n“IBM is taking cognitive technology beyond a physical technology interface like a smartphone or a robot toward an even more natural form of human and machine interaction,” said Rob High, an IBM Fellow, and vice president and chief technology officer of Watson. “Project Intu allows users to build embodied systems that reason, learn and interact with humans to create a presence with the people that use them – these cognitive-enabled avatars and devices could transform industries like retail, elder care, and industrial and social robotics.”\nWhat’s more, because Project Intu is system-agnostic, developers can use it to build cognitive experiences on a wide range of operating systems, be it Raspberry PI, MacOS, Windows or Linux.\nProject Intu is still an experimental platform, and it can be accessed via the Watson Developer Cloud , the Intu Gateway and also on GitHub . IBM is hoping developers will play around with the platform and provide feedback before launching it as a fully-fledged beta in the near future.\nPhoto Credit: NVIDIA Corporation Flickr via Compfight cc ",

      "text": "Polish Broadcaster Accelerates Sharing of 12 TB of TV Series, Movies, and News Each Month Select a topic or year \nWarsaw, Poland - 09 Nov 2016: \nIBM (NYSE: IBM ) announced today that -Telewizja Polsat has selected IBM Aspera to provide a complete set of solutions that will significantly improve the way content is ingested from local producers and global correspondents to their broadcast station. IBM Aspera has replaced using external media, like tapes, hard disks and DVD's and other slow and ineffective methods of transfers. \nTelewizja Polsat, established in 1992, is the biggest commercial broadcaster in Poland. The company broadcasts more than 30 channels and belongs to Cyfrowy Polsat Group, the biggest media-and -telecommunications group in Poland. Telewizja Polsat collaborates with 40 Polish production houses and content producers that submit programs, series and movies in a specific HD format for transmission every day. In addition, the broadcaster works closely with global news and sports producers, which also send the latest up-to date reports and announcements from all over the world. One hour of TV content alone usually consists of 25 GB of data, reaching approximately 12 TB of content every month. \nPreviously, this volume of content was delivered on external media, such as tapes, hard disks and DVDs, or transferred using FTP. However, after deploying a tapeless production and broadcast system several years ago, Telewizja Polsat realized their previous transfer methods were too slow and ineffective, involving too many people carrying out the work manually. In addition, its past transfer methods had become impractical due to the growing size of digital media, as well as additional new locations and signed contracts with new content providers. \nThat's when Telewizja Polsat started to look for software-based alternatives of delivering digital content in a fast, reliable and secure manner. After an initial evaluation, Telewizja Polsat decided to deploy IBM Aspera technology at the studio’s headquarters in Warsaw. Today IBM Aspera provides an integral solution for gathering TV content, enabling high-speed transfer of multi-gigabyte digital assets and real-time collaboration with geographically distributed news and sports correspondents. The intuitive web interface enables new content providers and correspondents to start transferring files immediately without the need to learn a complicated system. \n\"Our broadcast depends on IBM Aspera every day,” says Andrzej Szymański, IT/TV manager at Telewizja Polsat. “ Sometimes content comes in within days of a planned broadcast, which previously require a long process of acceptance and control to be performed in a very short time frame. Aspera drastically reduces the time it takes for us to receive the content, shortening the end-to-end workflow and ensuring we can have content ready to go in time for transmission on our channels, ” adds Andrzej Szymanski. \nBased on the patented FASP® high-speed file transport technology, the IBM Aspera solution enables Telewizja Polsat to handle the daily file uploads, ingest and sharing workflows with greater speed, security and efficiency. Aspera Connect Server powers high-speed file transfers from local content producers and global correspondents to Telewizja Polsat, while Aspera’s Web-based Console provides a comprehensive management environment for monitoring and prioritizing content transfers. \n\"Broadcasters like Telewizja Polsat are always striving to deliver the highest quality programming.”–says Michelle Munson, CEO and co-founder Aspera.„Faster content acquisition and shorter end-to-end workflows with the IBM Aspera technology allows them to meet their tight production schedules and broadcast news and reports when they are still relevant to their growing audiences ”. \nWith IBM Aspera technology, globally dispersed correspondents at Telewizja Polsat in the US, Russia, Germany, Italy, Belgium and around the world, can submit raw and final shots via their mobile devices directly to Polsat for automatic transfer to newsrooms or sports production systems. Aspera’s intuitive email-style interface allows individual contributors to quickly upload large video files without requiring any technical expertise. The integrated notifications alert team members when content has been successfully delivered and downloaded. \nAbout Telewizja Polsat \nTelewizja Polsat was the first commercial television station in Poland and today is one of Poland’s two leading private television groups in terms of revenue and share in the TV advertising market. POLSAT, its flagship channel, is one of Poland’s leading channels in terms of audience share. It airs a broad variety of movies, Polish and foreign series, great music events, talent shows realized based on license agreements as well as sports offer and became one of the Polish audience most favorite TV stations. \nOwing to a very attractive program offer which reaches audiences in more than 98% of households Polsat has one of the most valuable and recognizable brand in Poland. The strongest foundations of the broadcaster are: perfect entertainment, fascinating film offer, reliable and fast news as well as exciting sport. \nAbout Aspera \nAspera, an IBM company, is the creator of next-generation transport technologies that move the world's data at maximum speed regardless of file size, transfer distance and network conditions.

      "text": "IBM Launches Experimental Platform for Embedding Watson into Any Device Developers can extend Watson speech, language, vision and empathy capabilities to new form factors November 9, 2016 09:00 AM EST Blog This \nSAN FRANCISCO , Nov. 9, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- IBM (NYSE: IBM ) today unveiled the experimental release of Project Intu, a new, system-agnostic platform designed to enable embodied cognition. The new platform allows developers to embed Watson functions into various end-user device form factors, offering a next generation architecture for building cognitive-enabled experiences. \nProject Intu, in its experimental form, is now accessible via the Watson Developer Cloud and also available on Intu Gateway and GitHub . \nProject Intu simplifies the process for developers wanting to create cognitive experiences in various form factors such as spaces, avatars, robots or other IoT devices, and it extends cognitive technology into the physical world. The platform enables devices to interact more naturally with users, triggering different emotions and behaviors and creating more meaningful and immersive experience for users. \nDevelopers can simplify and integrate Watson services, such as Conversation, Language and Visual Recognition, with the capabilities of the \"device\" to, in essence, act out the interaction with the user. Instead of a developer needing to program each individual movement of a device or avatar, Project Intu makes it easy to combine movements that are appropriate for performing specific tasks like assisting a customer in a retail setting or greeting a visitor in a hotel in a way that is natural for the end user. \nTypically, developers must make architectural decisions about how to integrate different cognitive services into an end-user experience – such as what actions the systems will take and what will trigger a device's particular functionality. Project Intu offers developers a ready-made environment on which to build cognitive experiences running on a wide variety of operating systems – from Raspberry PI to MacOS, Windows to Linux machines, to name a few. As an example, IBM has worked with Nexmo, the Vonage API platform, to demonstrate the ways Intu can be integrated with both Watson and third-party APIs to bring an additional dimension to cognitive interactions via voice-enabled experiences using Nexmo's Voice API's support of websockets. \nThe growth of cognitive-enabled applications is sharply accelerating. IDC recently estimated that \"by 2018, 75 percent of developer teams will include Cognitive/AI functionality in one or more applications/services.\" * This is a dramatic jump from last year's prediction that 50 percent of developers would leverage cognitive/AI functionality by 2018. \n\"IBM is taking cognitive technology beyond a physical technology interface like a smartphone or a robot toward an even more natural form of human and machine interaction,\" said Rob High , IBM Fellow, VP and CTO, IBM Watson. \"Project Intu allows users to build embodied systems that reason, learn and interact with humans to create a presence with the people that use them – these cognitive-enabled avatars and devices could transform industries like retail, elder care, and industrial and social robotics.\" \nProject Intu is a continuation of IBM's work in the field of embodied cognition, drawing on advances from IBM Research, as well as the application and use of cognitive and IoT technologies. Making Project Intu available to developers as an experimental offering to experiment with and provide feedback will serve as the basis for further refinements as it moves toward beta. \nAbout IBM Watson: Pioneering a New Era of Computing Watson represents a new era in computing called cognitive computing, where systems understand the world in a way more similar to humans: through senses, learning, and experience. Watson continuously learns from previous interactions, gaining in value and knowledge over time. With the help of Watson, organizations are harnessing the power of cognitive computing to transform industries, help professionals do their jobs better, and solve important challenges. As part of IBM's strategy to accelerate the growth of cognitive computing, Watson is open to the world, allowing a growing community of developers, students, entrepreneurs and tech enthusiasts to easily tap into the most advanced and diverse cognitive computing platform available today. Watson solutions are being built, used and deployed in more than 45 countries and across 20 different industries. \nFor more information on IBM Watson, visit: ibm.com/Watson and ibm.com/press/watson .

      "text": "Tweet \nIBM's Watson project has been a leader in cognitive computing, enabling machines to understand the world in a similar way to humans. \nToday the company is unveiling the experimental release of Project Intu, a new, system-agnostic platform designed to allow developers to embed Watson functions into various end-user device form factors, offering a next generation architecture for building cognitive-enabled experiences. \nUsing Project Intu developers can simplify and integrate Watson services, such as Conversation, Language and Visual Recognition, with the capabilities of the 'device' to, in essence, act out the interaction with the user. Instead of a developer needing to program each individual movement of a device or avatar, Project Intu makes it easy to combine movements that are appropriate for performing specific tasks like assisting a customer in a retail setting or greeting a visitor in a hotel in a way that is natural for the end user. \n\"IBM is taking cognitive technology beyond a physical technology interface like a smartphone or a robot toward an even more natural form of human and machine interaction,\" says Rob High, IBM Fellow, VP and CTO of IBM Watson. \"Project Intu allows users to build embodied systems that reason, learn and interact with humans to create a presence with the people that use them -- these cognitive-enabled avatars and devices could transform industries like retail, elder care, and industrial and social robotics\". \nThe announcement came as part of IBM's inaugural Watson Developer Conference . Project Intu, in its experimental form, is now accessible via the Watson Developer Cloud and also available on Intu Gateway and GitHub .",

      "text": "Monday, November 7, 2016 By Will Alexander \nFrank Skoviera, a project manager for IBM, was finishing a meeting in 2001 when he felt something like a feather brushing his neck. Upon touching the area, Skoviera found that the right side of his chin and jaw were numb. A few days later, pain would explode through his gums in response to touch, off and on for days at a time. Feelings of numbness and pain spread across the right side of his face. \n“The right side of my face could not be touched without causing intense burning, and electrical shock-like pain,” said Skoviera. “This condition makes things like eating, talking, or brushing your teeth so difficult and painful that you have to change your life.” \nSudden, severe pain has been an inescapable part of Skoviera’s life ever since. It forced Skoviera, who has since retired, to take extended leaves of absence from work. Normally an outgoing person, Skoviera withdrew from socializing because of the agony that could be caused by a conversation or a gentle breeze. Even Skoviera’s family relationships were tested, as Skoviera found himself turning down requests from his son or wife to go out to eat, go for a walk, or even have a conversation because of the intense pain those activities could cost. \n“I can tell you as being a patient for fifteen years, there’s no area of my life that has not been touched by having this disease,” Skoviera said. \nSkoviera has trigeminal neuralgia, a chronic pain condition caused by damage to the trigeminal, or 5th cranial nerve, that supplies feeling to the face and head. The trigeminal nerve conducts feelings and pain from the most sensitive parts of the body, including the eyes, the living insides of teeth, and the dura mater, the protective layer inside the skull that can feel detect stimuli involved in headaches. \nSo when something--usually a nearby blood vessel rubbing against the nerve, but sometimes complications from conditions like stroke, multiple sclerosis, or a tumor, causes the trigeminal nerve to misfire, the results can be excruciating pain, said Wolfgang Liedtke, MD, PhD, a Duke neurologist specializing in headache and facial pain, both clinically and in his basic science research lab. \n“The trigeminal system evolved to provide sentinel information from the head and face, the location where animals have evolved to detect danger. If that system malfunctions, it can cause some of the most devastating pain that humans can suffer,” Liedtke said. \nHistorically, trigeminal neuralgia, or tic douloureux , was labeled a “suicide disease,” Liedtke said, because people with the condition would sometimes kill themselves to end their suffering. \nThe symptoms of trigeminal neuralgia have been recorded since the late 18th century, but significant progress in its treatment has only been made in recent decades. Today, anticonvulsants, antidepressants, and opioids are sometimes used in treatment. Recently, botox injections have also been applied to reduce the pain. Other options include delicate forms of neurosurgery that can literally insert a tiny sponge between the trigeminal nerve and the abutting artery, vein, or tumor, or gamma-knife radiosurgery that scars the nerve and eventually keeps it from violent misfiring. \nBut much more progress needs to be made, Liedtke said. Medications help some people, but for others, like Skoviera, they may only reduce the pain, work intermittently, or cause side effects such as dizziness, nausea, or confusion; and since that arterial or other compression of the nerve cannot always be verified, surgical options aren’t an option for everyone. \n“We may have kept people from killing and maiming and harming themselves, but it doesn't mean we have a truly effective treatment at hand for this devastating disease,” Liedtke said. “If we did, we wouldn’t have Frank driving around.” \n“Driving around” is literally what Frank Skoviera is doing to help people with trigeminal neuralgia. Since retiring from IBM, he has become the volunteer communications director for the Facial Pain Research Foundation, a nonprofit group funding research for new treatments and possible cures for trigeminal neuralgia. \nThis October, Skoviera and his service dog Maxwell left their home in Tampa, Florida to start driving across the continental United States to talk with researchers, clinicians, patients, people affected by trigeminal neuralgia, and people who have never heard of the condition. Skoviera hopes to raise awareness of the condition, comfort people suffering from it, and talk with clinicians and researchers like Liedtke about finding new treatments in each of the 48 contiguous states. \nSkoviera recently stopped at Duke, where he met with Liedtke as well as other national experts in pain, including Tim Collins, MD, and the Center for Translational Pain Medicine’s Ru-rong Ji, PhD, Jongbae Jay Park, KMD, PhD, and Aurelio Alonso, PhD, DDS. \nSkoviera, left, and Liedtke, right, pose at the Duke Neurological Disorders Clinic at Morreene Road. \nSkoviera shared his own experience with the condition with the Duke team, toured Duke clinics that treat trigeminal neuralgia and related conditions, and discussed a pilot award given to Liedtke to investigate a path to significantly improve treatment for trigeminal neuralgia. \n“In addition to being a world-renowned pain specialist, Dr. Liedtke is a very compassionate individual,” Skoviera said. “He is very caught up in the suffering of patients and understands the intensity of their pain.” \nSkoviera’s silver SUV is decorated with a large “Drive away the pain” teal wrap as well as more than 20 signed decals from the locations he has visited so far. He and Maxwell have already traveled the east coast from southern Florida to Vermont. “I will go anywhere and speak to anyone,” Skoviera said. \nAnd while medications aren’t always reliable for Skoviera, Maxwell is. “I know for sure he senses that I don’t feel well a lot of the time. If I’m hurting, he’ll come right over and put his body right next to mine. Just having him with me on the trip has been a wonderful source of comfort and support,” Skoviera said. \nSkoviera hopes to raise $10,000 through his travels.

      "text": "  \nBangkok, Thailand - 09 Nov 2016: IBM (NYSE: IBM ) today announced it is working with one of Thailand’s largest banks, Kasikornbank Public Company Limited (KBank), to build a new blockchain network designed to help simplify procedures for the bank's corporate credit business. Using Bluemix, IBM’s cloud platform, the bank will create the foundation for a blockchain business network which will allow credit requestors, credit beneficiaries and KBank to fast-track traditionally lengthy procedures such as Letters of Guarantee for clients. Banks require better visibility on the number of Letters of Guarantee processed and the status of each. Currently these take days to complete. Through tapping the transparency of blockchain, KBank is looking to expedite the application process, enrich the customer experience, and make the process more cost-effective for both clients and the bank. \nBlockchain is rapidly fueling a new generation of accountable, transparent transactions which can help streamline business processes across a number of industries, including banking, financial services, shipping and logistics. \n“ Kasikornbank Business Technology Group ( KBTG), a K Company Group with IT expertise, recognizes the importance of blockchain technology and has built a model for an original document certification service suitable for both corporate and retail customers. Placing emphasis on data storage security and authorization to access the data for related parties via a private blockchain, the new service helps reduce operational procedures of organizations and related parties. The blockchain technology is able to verify data with transparency, security and auditability,” said Mr. Somkid Jiranuntarat, vice chairman of KBTG. “The new technology is used for an original document certification service as part of the bank’s pilot project using the blockchain infrastructure built on the Hyperledger Fabric. It has been designed for applications in diverse organizations with a common standard, swift service and the unique features of private blockchain.” \nBuilt in the Singapore location of IBM’s Bluemix Garage network, the project uses the IBM Blockchain service on Bluemix. With eight locations globally, IBM Bluemix Garages serve as a hub where developers, designers and product managers can come together to build on Bluemix. \nWith the Bluemix Garage team, KBank is designing a blockchain network using an agile and lean startup approach. Blockchain will provide a system that collects customer information and associated credit application data in the cloud to improve trust in the network, replacing the manual process of posting records and validating applications. As security is a key priority for the bank, it will begin testing the high-security business network delivered via Bluemix, designed specifically for organizations that handle sensitive data with its additional levels of security that help protect against unauthorized access and tampering. \n“Blockchain and cloud have the potential to play a critical role in improving business transactions. This project demonstrates considerable benefits for the financial services sector and beyond,” said Parnsiree Amatayakul, managing director of IBM Thailand. “KBank is a leading financial institution known for continuously adopting advanced technologies to enhance customer experience. We are delighted to continue to support KBank’s important initiatives in blockchain and the significant value these projects will bring to the bank.” \nKBank provides commercial banking services including personal and commercial banking, international trade, and investment banking services to its customers throughout Thailand. The Bank has foreign branches in Los Angeles, Hong Kong, Cayman Islands, and Shenzhen, and representative offices in Shanghai, Beijing, and Kunming. \nIBM is rapidly expanding its blockchain consulting services and capabilities, and actively working with clients to understand what it takes to make blockchain ready for business. Through its open source contributions to the Hyperledger fabric and its blockchain services on IBM Bluemix, developers can develop applications rapidly and easily while testing security, availability, and performance of a permissioned blockchain network. \n  about IBM Blockchain, visit www.ibm.com/blockchain . \n  about IBM Cloud, visit www.ibm.com/cloud-computing .

      "text": "IBM Payments Gateway Placed as Leader in The Forrester Wave: Global Commerce Payment Providers, 4Q 2016 report November 9, 2016 | Written by: David Nicol \nCategorized: Articles | eCommerce & Merchandising | Payments \nThe first ever The Forrester Wave™: Global Commerce Payment Providers, 4Q 2016 report has been released and Forrester has placed IBM Payment Gateway solution as a Leader in its evaluation. This report underscores for us the importance merchants are placing on their payments acceptance systems to meet the high expectations of shoppers, dependable data security, and to deliver excellence in customer service by orchestrating complex payment processing scenarios, in any channel. \nForrester’s evaluation notes that our approach enables maximum global acquirer flexibility. IBM Payments Gateway does not require a specific merchant banking relationship, and in fact, supports multiple merchant accounts simultaneously. Forrester recognizes IBM’s extensive number of acquiring partners, payment methods and country support. It states that clients who already use IBM commerce products will like the single point of contact and managed integration. IBM Payments Gateway is a part of the Watson Commerce family of solutions that encompasses the entire customer journey lifecycle, and is pre-integrated to companion solutions like Order Management and WebSphere Commerce. The report states that IBM Watson and Safer Payments (through IRIS Analytics acquisition) bring additional services to extract customer insights and combat fraud respectively. Forrester says that IBM excels at communicating our vision and product roadmap to clients, and provides them a simple tiered pricing and billing model that is transparent and detailed. \nForrester’s analysis and evaluation spanned a comprehensive set of criteria grouped by category: \n\nIBM Payment Gateway solution was ranked a LEADER based on the rigorous assessment across these dimensions, earning among the highest scores in core technology infrastructure, commercial terms, product and service vision, and global presence and support criteria. \nRead the detailed report, The Forrester Wave™: Global Commerce Payment Providers, 4Q 2016 for an explanation of these scores and the evaluation criteria. \nWe believe we achieved these results through a laser focus on continuous innovation and improvement in all areas of payments execution and customer experience. \nForrester calls out four key components necessary for providers to deliver value to merchants: Unlocking retailers from channel-specific and siloed views of customers Optimizing payment processing for global expansion Cultivating security and fraud solutions to tackle evolving risks Delivering unique revenue-generating, value-added solutions \nIBM Watson Commerce and the IBM Payments Gateway deliver on those goals by providing a complete end-to-end commerce solution with integrated payments to our customers as they evolve through generational stages of omni-channel maturity. By doing so, we have ensured that our solutions are essential to our customers’ success. We feel this recognition by experts in the analyst community serves as a reminder about the leadership and value we bring to a wide set of industries and business models.",

Through tapping the transparency of blockchain, KBank is looking to expedite the application process, enrich the customer experience, and make the process more cost-effective for both clients and the bank. \nBlockchain is rapidly fueling a new generation of accountable, transparent transactions which can help streamline business processes across a number of industries, including banking, financial services, shipping and logistics. \n“ Kasikornbank Business Technology Group ( KBTG), a K Company Group with IT expertise, recognizes the importance of blockchain technology and has built a model for an original document certification service suitable for both corporate and retail customers. Placing emphasis on data storage security and authorization to access the data for related parties via a private blockchain, the new service helps reduce operational procedures of organizations and related parties. The blockchain technology is able to verify data with transparency, security and auditability,” said Mr. Somkid Jiranuntarat, vice chairman of KBTG. “The new technology is used for an original document certification service as part of the bank’s pilot project using the blockchain infrastructure built on the Hyperledger Fabric. It has been designed for applications in diverse organizations with a common standard, swift service and the unique features of private blockchain.” \nBuilt in the Singapore location of IBM’s Bluemix Garage network, the project uses the IBM Blockchain service on Bluemix. With eight locations globally, IBM Bluemix Garages serve as a hub where developers, designers and product managers can come together to build on Bluemix. \nWith the Bluemix Garage team, KBank is designing a blockchain network using an agile and lean startup approach. Blockchain will provide a system that collects customer information and associated credit application data in the cloud to improve trust in the network, replacing the manual process of posting records and validating applications. As security is a key priority for the bank, it will begin testing the high-security business network delivered via Bluemix, designed specifically for organizations that handle sensitive data with its additional levels of security that help protect against unauthorized access and tampering. \n“ Blockchain and cloud have the potential to play a critical role in improving business transactions. This project demonstrates considerable benefits for the financial services sector and beyond, ” said Parnsiree Amatayakul, managing director of IBM Thailand. “KBank is a leading financial institution known for continuously adopting advanced technologies to enhance customer experience. We are delighted to continue to support KBank’s important initiatives in blockchain and the significant value these projects will bring to the bank.” \nKBank provides commercial banking services including personal and commercial banking, international trade, and investment banking services to its customers throughout Thailand. The Bank has foreign branches in Los Angeles, Hong Kong, Cayman Islands, and Shenzhen, and representative offices in Shanghai, Beijing, and Kunming. \nIBM is rapidly expanding its blockchain consulting services and capabilities, and actively working with clients to understand what it takes to make blockchain ready for business. Through its open source contributions to the Hyperledger fabric and its blockchain services on IBM Bluemix, developers can develop applications rapidly and easily while testing security, availability, and performance of a permissioned blockchain network.

      "text": "Tweet Share SAN FRANCISCO, Nov. 9, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- IBM (NYSE: IBM ) today unveiled the experimental release of Project Intu, a new, system-agnostic platform designed to enable embodied cognition. The new platform allows developers to embed Watson functions into various end-user device form factors, offering a next generation architecture for building cognitive-enabled experiences. IBM Corporation logo More Project Intu, in its experimental form, is now accessible via the Watson Developer Cloud and also available on Intu Gateway and GitHub . Project Intu simplifies the process for developers wanting to create cognitive experiences in various form factors such as spaces, avatars, robots or other IoT devices, and it extends cognitive technology into the physical world. The platform enables devices to interact more naturally with users, triggering different emotions and behaviors and creating more meaningful and immersive experience for users. Developers can simplify and integrate Watson services, such as Conversation, Language and Visual Recognition, with the capabilities of the \"device\" to, in essence, act out the interaction with the user. Instead of a developer needing to program each individual movement of a device or avatar, Project Intu makes it easy to combine movements that are appropriate for performing specific tasks like assisting a customer in a retail setting or greeting a visitor in a hotel in a way that is natural for the end user. Typically, developers must make architectural decisions about how to integrate different cognitive services into an end-user experience – such as what actions the systems will take and what will trigger a device's particular functionality. Project Intu offers developers a ready-made environment on which to build cognitive experiences running on a wide variety of operating systems – from Raspberry PI to MacOS, Windows to Linux machines, to name a few. As an example, IBM has worked with Nexmo, the Vonage API platform, to demonstrate the ways Intu can be integrated with both Watson and third-party APIs to bring an additional dimension to cognitive interactions via voice-enabled experiences using Nexmo's Voice API's support of websockets. The growth of cognitive-enabled applications is sharply accelerating. IDC recently estimated that \"by 2018, 75 percent of developer teams will include Cognitive/AI functionality in one or more applications/services.\" * This is a dramatic jump from last year's prediction that 50 percent of developers would leverage cognitive/AI functionality by 2018. \"IBM is taking cognitive technology beyond a physical technology interface like a smartphone or a robot toward an even more natural form of human and machine interaction,\" said Rob High, IBM Fellow, VP and CTO, IBM Watson. \"Project Intu allows users to build embodied systems that reason, learn and interact with humans to create a presence with the people that use them – these cognitive-enabled avatars and devices could transform industries like retail, elder care, and industrial and social robotics.\" Project Intu is a continuation of IBM's work in the field of embodied cognition, drawing on advances from IBM Research, as well as the application and use of cognitive and IoT technologies. Making Project Intu available to developers as an experimental offering to experiment with and provide feedback will serve as the basis for further refinements as it moves toward beta. Read More About IBM Watson: Pioneering a New Era of Computing Watson represents a new era in computing called cognitive computing, where systems understand the world in a way more similar to humans: through senses, learning, and experience. Watson continuously learns from previous interactions, gaining in value and knowledge over time. With the help of Watson, organizations are harnessing the power of cognitive computing to transform industries, help professionals do their jobs better, and solve important challenges. As part of IBM's strategy to accelerate the growth of cognitive computing, Watson is open to the world, allowing a growing community of developers, students, entrepreneurs and tech enthusiasts to easily tap into the most advanced and diverse cognitive computing platform available today. Watson solutions are being built, used and deployed in more than 45 countries and across 20 different industries. For more information on IBM Watson, visit: ibm.com/Watson and ibm.com/press/watson .

      "text": "  @03:00PM from the ai-revolution dept. IBM has launched a new system-agnostic platform called Project Intu with which it aims to bring \"embodied cognition\" to a range of devices . From a report on SiliconAngle: In IBM's parlance, \"cognitive computing\" refers to machine learning. The idea behind Project Intu is that developers will be able to use the platform to embed the various machine learning functions offered by IBM's Watson service into various applications and devices, and make them work across a wide spectrum of form factors. So, for example, developers will be able to use Project Intu's capabilities to embed machine learning capabilities into pretty much any kind of device, from avatars to drones to robots and just about any other kind of Internet of Things' device. As a result, these devices will be able to \"interact more naturally\" with users via a range of emotions and behaviors, leading to more meaningful and immersive experiences for users, IBM said. What's more, because Project Intu is system-agnostic, developers can use it to build cognitive experiences on a wide range of operating systems, be it Raspberry PI, MacOS, Windows or Linux. Project Intu is still an experimental platform, and it can be accessed via the Watson Developer Cloud , the Intu Gateway and also on GitHub .",

The platform enables devices to interact more naturally with users, triggering different emotions and behaviors and creating more meaningful and immersive experience for users. \nDevelopers can simplify and integrate Watson services, such as Conversation, Language and Visual Recognition, with the capabilities of the “device” to, in essence, act out the interaction with the user. Instead of a developer needing to program each individual movement of a device or avatar, Project Intu makes it easy to combine movements that are appropriate for performing specific tasks like assisting a customer in a retail setting or greeting a visitor in a hotel in a way that is natural for the end user. \nTypically, developers must make architectural decisions about how to integrate different cognitive services into an end-user experience – such as what actions the systems will take and what will trigger a device’s particular functionality. Project Intu offers developers a ready-made environment on which to build cognitive experiences running on a wide variety of operating systems – from Raspberry PI to MacOS, Windows to Linux machines, to name a few. As an example , IBM has worked with Nexmo, the Vonage API platform, to demonstrate the ways Intu can be integrated with both Watson and third-party APIs to bring an additional dimension to cognitive interactions via voice-enabled experiences using Nexmo’s Voice API's support of websockets. \nThe growth of cognitive-enabled applications is sharply accelerating. IDC recently estimated that “by 2018, 75 percent of developer teams will include Cognitive/AI functionality in one or more applications/services.” * This is a dramatic jump from last year’s prediction that 50 percent of developers would leverage cognitive/AI functionality by 2018. \n“IBM is taking cognitive technology beyond a physical technology interface like a smartphone or a robot toward an even more natural form of human and machine interaction,” said Rob High, IBM Fellow, VP and CTO, IBM Watson. “Project Intu allows users to build embodied systems that reason, learn and interact with humans to create a presence with the people that use them – these cognitive-enabled avatars and devices could transform industries like retail, elder care, and industrial and social robotics.” \nProject Intu is a continuation of IBM’s work in the field of embodied cognition, drawing on advances from IBM Research, as well as the application and use of cognitive and IoT technologies. Making Project Intu available to developers as an experimental offering to experiment with and provide feedback will serve as the basis for further refinements as it moves toward beta. \nAbout IBM Watson: Pioneering a New Era of Computing Watson represents a new era in computing called cognitive computing, where systems understand the world in a way more similar to humans: through senses, learning, and experience. Watson continuously learns from previous interactions, gaining in value and knowledge over time. With the help of Watson, organizations are harnessing the power of cognitive computing to transform industries, help professionals do their jobs better, and solve important challenges. As part of IBM’s strategy to accelerate the growth of cognitive computing, Watson is open to the world, allowing a growing community of developers, students, entrepreneurs and tech enthusiasts to easily tap into the most advanced and diverse cognitive computing platform available today. Watson solutions are being built, used and deployed in more than 45 countries and across 20 different industries. \nFor more information on IBM Watson, visit: ibm.com/Watson and ibm.com/press/watson .

      "text": "up vote 3 down vote favorite \nI am running an IBM Domino 9.0.1 (64-bit) server on a Windows Server 2008 R2. \nThe problem is that the IMAP server task is not displaying the IP address of the connecting client in the console and log. \nHere's an example from the console log: \n2016-01-08 04:13:14 nimap: edd [] authentication failure using internet password 2016-01-08 04:13:16 nimap: easter [] authentication failure using internet password 2016-01-08 04:13:19 nimap: felicity [] authentication failure using internet password \nBetween the brackets [] there should be the IP address. For some reason it is not being output. \nIn contrast, the SMTP server task displays the IP of the connecting client properly, so I don't expect it to be a DNS or similar network configuration issue. \nIn order to get more details, I've created an event monitor tied to this event, which runs an agent that saves the details of the event in a document. Here is one such document (displayed as a table of field names/values) . As you see, it doesn't contain any useful info about the client's IP. \nSo, how can I get to know the IP of the connecting client without resolving to TCP monitoring tools? \nTIA",

      "text": "Share By Mary Bellis \nIn July of 1980, IBM representatives met for the first time with Microsoft's Bill Gates to talk about writing an operating system for IBM's new hush-hush \"personal\" computer. \nIBM had been observing the growing personal computer market for some time. They had already made one dismal attempt to crack the market with their IBM 5100 . At one point, IBM considered buying the fledgling game company Atari to commandeer Atari's early line of personal computers. However, IBM decided to stick with making their own personal computer line and developed a brand new operating system to go with. IBM PC aka Acorn The secret plans were referred to as \"Project Chess\". The code name for the new computer was \"Acorn\". Twelve engineers, led by William C. Lowe, assembled in Boca Raton, Florida, to design and build the \"Acorn\". On August 12, 1981, IBM released their new computer , re-named the IBM PC. The \"PC\" stood for \"personal computer\" making IBM responsible for popularizing the term \"PC\". IBM PC Open Architecture The first IBM PC ran on a 4.77 MHz Intel 8088 microprocessor. \ncontinue reading below our video 5 Ways to Improve Your Credit Score The PC came equipped with 16 kilobytes of memory, expandable to 256k. The PC came with one or two 160k floppy disk drives and an optional color monitor. The price tag started at $1,565, which would be nearly $4,000 today.\nWhat really made the IBM PC different from previous IBM computers was that it was the first one built from off the shelf parts (called open architecture) and marketed by outside distributors (Sears & Roebucks and Computerland). The Intel chip was chosen because IBM had already obtained the rights to manufacture the Intel chips. IBM had used the Intel 8086 for use in its Displaywriter Intelligent Typewriter in exchange for giving Intel the rights to IBM's bubble memory technology. IBM PC Man of the Year Less than four months after IBM introduced the PC, Time Magazine named the computer \"man of the year\"",

      "text": "Profile of a Computer Manufacturing Giant IBM History - Samuel Palmisano, Current President and CEO. Getty Images By Mary Bellis Updated August 06, 2016 . IBM or International Business Machines is a well known known American computer manufacturer, founded by Thomas J. Watson (born 1874-02-17). IBM is also known as \"Big Blue\" after the color of its logo. The company has made everything from mainframes to personal computers and has been immensely successful selling business computers. IBM History - The Beginning On June 16, 1911, three successful 19th century companies decided to merge, marking the beginnings of IBM history .\nThe Tabulating Machine Company, the International Time Recording Company, and the Computing Scale Company of America joined together to incorporate and form one company, the Computing Tabulating Recording Company. In 1914, Thomas J. Watson Senior joined CTR as CEO and held that title for the next twenty years, turning the company into the multi-national entity. \nIn 1924, Watson changed the company’s name to International Business Machines Corporation or IBM. From the beginning, IBM defined itself not by selling products, which ranged from commercial scales to punch card tabulators, but by its research and development. \ncontinue reading below our video 5 Ways to Improve Your Credit Score Learn More Timeline IBM History & Technological Achievements IBM History - Business Computers IBM began designing and manufacturing calculators in the 1930s, using the technology of their own punch card processing equipment. In 1944, IBM together with Harvard University financed the invention of the Mark 1 computer , the first machine to compute long calculations automatically. By 1953, IBM was ready to completely produce their own computers, which began with the IBM 701 EDPM , their first commercially successful general-purpose computer. And the 701 was just the beginning.

      "title": "IBM Introduces Developers to Embodied Cognition With Project Intu",
      "text": "IBM's new Project Intu enables developers to apply its Watson cognitive computing technology to different form factors and devices. Just two weeks after hosting its World of Watson conference in Las Vegas, IBM kicked off its Watson Developer Conference in San Francisco to further advance its Watson cognitive computing platform among developers. At the developer conference, IBM launched the experimental release of its Project Intu, a new system-agnostic platform designed to enable embodied cognition . Embodied cognition is the application of artificial intelligence to form factors, such as robots, devices or other objects. Project Intu enables developers to embed Watson functions into various end-user device form factors to create new cognitive-enabled experiences. \"IBM is taking cognitive technology beyond a physical technology interface like a smartphone or a robot toward an even more natural form of human and machine interaction,\" Rob High, IBM Fellow, vice president and CTO of IBM Watson, said in a statement. \"Project Intu allows users to build embodied systems that reason, learn and interact with humans to create a presence with the people that use them—these cognitive-enabled avatars and devices could transform industries like retail, elder care, and industrial and social robotics.\"The new IBM project is available on the Watson Developer Cloud , Intu Gateway and GitHub .With roots in IBM Research, Project Intu is an effort to extend cognitive technology into the physical world in form factors like robots, avatars, spaces and internet of things (IoT) devices. Developers can tap into Watson services like the Conversation, Language and Visual Recognition APIs to apply different cognitive behaviors to devices. The goal of Project Intu is to provide developers with a simplified environment for creating embodied cognition experiences on a variety of operating systems. The project supports Raspberry PI, Mac OS, Windows and Linux environments, among others. \"IBM's Project Intu is after a different sort of game,\" said Charles King, principal analyst at Pund-IT. \"First and foremost, the company hopes to use the effort to broaden Watson's use and appeal across numerous development environments. But more fundamentally, Project Intu is designed to humanize user interfaces and interactions within IoT environments. If IBMs Project Intu succeeds, it could go a long way toward normalizing IoT use cases and solutions.\" Steve Abrams, IBM vice president of Watson Developer Advocacy, wrote in a recent blog post , \"Our philosophy at IBM is to put our technology in the hands of developers, because for every good idea we have, we know they're thinking up thousands more.\" Abrams then went on to highlight several projects where developers are using Watson to deliver cognitive solutions. He noted that IBM also expanded access to Watson for developers through partnerships with third-party platforms such as the Twilio Marketplace, which is comprised of more than 1 million developers. In October, IBM introduced the Watson Application Development Certification program , which is designed to help developers globally build and validate their skills as well as connect with companies looking to leverage their unique talents, Abrams said. \"We also launched an AI Nanodegree in conjunction with Udacity and a new partnership with Kivuto Solutions to provide students and academics around the world with free access to the complete IBM Bluemix porfolio.\"",

      "text": "IBM Launches Experimental Platform for Embedding Watson into Any Device [November 09, 2016] Tweet \nSAN FRANCISCO , Nov. 9, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- IBM (NYSE: IBM ) today unveiled the experimental release of Project Intu, a new, system-agnostic platform designed to enable embodied cognition. The new platform allows developers to embed Watson functions into various end-user device form factors, offering a next generation architecture for building cognitive-enabled experiences. \nProject Intu, in its experimental form, is now accessible via the Watson Developer Cloud and also available on Intu Gateway and GitHub . \nProject Intu simplifies the process for developers wanting to create cognitive experiences in various form factors such as spaces, avatars, robots or other IoT devices, and it extends cognitive technology into the physical world. The platform enables devices to interact more naturally with users, triggering different emotions and behaviors and creating more meaningful and immersive experience for users. \nDevelopers can simplify and integrate Watson services, such as Conversation, Language and Visual Recognition, with the capabilities of the \"device\" to, in essence, act out the interaction with the user. Instead of a developer needing to program each individual movement of a device or avatar, Project Intu makes it easy to combine movements that are appropriate for performing specific tasks like assisting a customer in a retail setting or greeting a visitor in a hotel in a way that is natural for the end user. \nTypically, developers must make architectural decisions about how to integrate ifferent cognitive services into an end-user experience – such as what actions the systems will take and what will trigger a device's particular functionality. Project Intu offers developers a ready-made environment on which to build cognitive experiences running on a wide variety of operating systems – from Raspberry PI to MacOS, Windows to Linux machines, to name a few. As an example, IBM has worked with Nexmo, the Vonage API platform, to demonstrate the ways Intu can be integrated with both Watson and third-party APIs to bring an additional dimension to cognitive interactions via voice-enabled experiences using Nexmo's Voice API's support of websockets. \nThe growth of cognitive-enabled applications is sharply accelerating. IDC recently estimated that \"by 2018, 75 percent of developer teams will include Cognitive/AI functionality in one or more applications/services.\" * This is a dramatic jump from last year's prediction that 50 percent of developers would leverage cognitive/AI functionality by 2018. \n\"IBM is taking cognitive technology beyond a physical technology interface like a smartphone or a robot toward an even more natural form of human and machine interaction,\" said Rob High , IBM Fellow, VP and CTO, IBM Watson. \"Project Intu allows users to build embodied systems that reason, learn and interact with humans to create a presence with the people that use them – these cognitive-enabled avatars and devices could transform industries like retail, elder care, and industrial and social robotics.\" \nProject Intu is a continuation of IBM's work in the field of embodied cognition, drawing on advances from IBM Research, as well as the application and use of cognitive and IoT technologies. Making Project Intu available to developers as an experimental offering to experiment with and provide feedback will serve as the basis for further refinements as it moves toward beta. \nAbout IBM Watson: Pioneering a New Era of Computing Watson represents a new era in computing called cognitive computing, where systems understand the world in a way more similar to humans: through senses, learning, and experience. Watson continuously learns from previous interactions, gaining in value and knowledge over time. With the help of Watson, organizations are harnessing the power of cognitive computing to transform industries, help professionals do their jobs better, and solve important challenges. As part of IBM's strategy to accelerate the growth of cognitive computing, Watson is open to the world, allowing a growing community of developers, students, entrepreneurs and tech enthusiasts to easily tap into the most advanced and diverse cognitive computing platform available today. Watson solutions are being built, used and deployed in more than 45 countries and across 20 different industries. \nFor more information on IBM Watson, visit: ibm.com/Watson and ibm.com/press/watson .

      "text": "Next month, IBM plans to roll out updated Spectrum Virtualize software to give customers expanded options to deploy hybrid clouds, new higher density flash enclosures and additional converged infrastructure choices.\nThe December upgrade to IBM Spectrum Virtualize will include software functionality and support for Amazon Simple Storage Service, OpenStack Swift and IBM Cloud APIs to enable users to tier data from on-premises block storage systems to off-premises cloud storage.\nThe hybrid cloud capabilities will be available in IBM's Storwize, FlashSystem V9000, SAN Volume Controller (SVC) and VersaStack systems -- all of which are based on the IBM Spectrum Virtualize software. The cloud functionality will also be available by extension to the nearly 400 third-party storage systems the Spectrum software can virtualize , according to IBM.\n\"We're bringing hybrid cloud capability to storage that clients already have so they don't have to rip and replace their existing storage to put in storage that has hybrid cloud capability,\" said Chris Saul, marketing manager for the IBM Spectrum Storage family.\nSaul said IBM has been adding hybrid cloud support to its entire Spectrum Storage software family , which also includes Spectrum Scale (based on IBM's General Parallel File System ), Spectrum Accelerate (based on IBM's XIV Storage System) and Spectrum Protect (based on Tivoli Storage Manager).\nWe're bringing hybrid cloud capability to storage that clients already have so they don't have to rip and replace their existing storage to put in storage that has hybrid cloud capability. Chris Saul marketing manager, IBM Spectrum Storage \"Where you really see them going as a strategy is focused on software-defined storage as a flexible technology or data layer to enable organizations to transform their data center and move to a hybrid cloud architecture,\" said Scott Sinclair, a senior analyst at Enterprise Strategy Group.\n\"They support cloud tiering without requiring an external gateway,\" wrote Eric Burgener, a research director at International Data Corp., in an email. \"Given that hybrid cloud is the future, this is an important capability for managing high data growth while keeping cost low. They're not the only ones to do this, but they're also not the last ones.\"\nIBM Spectrum Virtualize 7.8 is due to become generally available on Dec. 9. The upgrade is free for existing Spectrum Virtualize customers who have a current subscription and support agreement with IBM.\nNext month, IBM will also make a new policy-based cloud data sharing capability available with Spectrum Scale. The Spectrum Scale 4.2.2 update will enable replication and automatic synchronization of file and object data across on-premises and cloud storage.",

      "text": "0 \nMicrosoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) and IBM (NYSE: IBM) are frequently cited as \"mature\" tech stocks that you buy for income and stability instead of growth. Both stocks have outperformed the S&P 500's 4% gain -- Microsoft is up 9% for the year, and IBM has climbed about 13%. But is either stock still worth buying today with the market near all-time highs? The Surface Pro Studio. Image source: Microsoft. The similarities between Microsoft and IBM \nAt first glance, Microsoft and IBM are very different companies. Microsoft generates most its revenue from licensing and subscription fees for Windows and Office. It generates additional revenue from sales of its Azure cloud platform Dynamics CRM, Surface hardware, Xbox consoles, and search-based ads. IBM's core business is split between business services, technology services, hardware systems, and enterprise software. \nBut Microsoft and IBM both face two similar challenges -- slower enterprise spending, and the technological shift toward mobile and cloud-based solutions. Sluggish enterprise spending causes companies to stick with older versions of Windows and Office, and to spend less on IBM's IT services, hardware, and software. Both companies are also struggling to remain relevant in a mobile world . That's why Microsoft's revenue fell 2% last year, while IBM's top line declined 12%. \nNeither Microsoft nor IBM has a meaningful presence in mobile hardware, but both companies are pivoting their businesses toward higher-growth cloud solutions to offset declines in other older businesses. Microsoft's core strategy in that market revolves around growing its commercial cloud business (Office 365, Dynamics, Azure), which achieved an annual run rate of $13 billion last quarter. \nIBM's plan is similar -- to grow its \"strategic imperatives\" businesses (cloud, analytics, mobility, security, and social) at a faster rate than its older businesses. IBM's cloud \"as a service\" business, which can be compared to Microsoft's commercial cloud business, hit an annual run rate of $7.5 billion last quarter. IBM Watson Element for Educators. Image source: IBM. How fast are Microsoft and IBM growing? \nMicrosoft has posted positive single-digit annual sales growth for three consecutive quarters. IBM, however, has posted annual sales declines for 18 consecutive quarters. Looking ahead, analysts expect Microsoft's revenue to rise 2% this year, but IBM's to decline 2%. That's partly because Microsoft's business (mostly software) was easier to pivot toward higher-growth cloud businesses than IBM's complex mix of business software, hardware, and IT services. \nIBM slimmed down its hardware business over the past few years with the sale of its PC business, low-end servers, and its chipmaking unit. But the hardware business remains a dead weight on Big Blue's top line, causing its Systems revenue (8% of sales) to fall 21% annually last quarter. Its core business and technology services are also losing ground to nimbler rivals . \nBoth companies rely heavily on inorganic growth to strengthen their ecosystems. Microsoft's acquired LinkedIn to gather more employer and employee data for its analytics business, and to widen Dynamics' moat against Salesforce 's market-leading CRM platform. IBM has been acquiring smaller cloud, mobile, and security businesses to strengthen its strategic imperatives. Both companies have adequate cash to continue that strategy -- Microsoft generated nearly $27 billion in free cash flow over the past 12 months, while IBM generated over $14 billion. Dividends and buybacks \nMicrosoft currently pays a forward yield of 2.6%, which is supported by a payout ratio of 69%. IBM pays a higher forward yield of 3.7%, yet has a lower payout ratio of 44%. From an income investor's perspective, IBM might seem like a better pick. \nMicrosoft spends more cash on buybacks than IBM. Over the past 12 months, it spent nearly $15 billion on buybacks, but Big Blue spent just over $3 billion. However, IBM intentionally started reducing those buybacks last year to conserve its free cash flow for investments and acquisitions in its higher-growth businesses. Profitability and valuations 5 charts that predict the Fed's intentions on interest-rate hikes \nMicrosoft's earnings, lifted by buybacks and its shift toward higher-margin cloud businesses, are expected to rise 6% this year. IBM's earnings are expected to fall 10% due to its ongoing sales declines, increased investments, and reduced buybacks. \nMicrosoft currently trades at 29 times earnings, which matches the industry average of 29 for business software and services companies. IBM trades at 13 times earnings, which is lower than the industry average of 21 for IT services companies. Those metrics indicate that investors could be a bit too excited about Microsoft, while ignoring IBM's cheap valuation. The winner: IBM \nMicrosoft initially looks like a better buy than IBM -- it clearly has better sales and earnings growth, and its turnaround efforts are producing more visible results. But IBM's higher dividend, lower payout ratio, and lower P/E ratio indicate that it's the better pick at current prices. Microsoft has lots of growth potential -- especially with new products like HoloLens, VR headsets , and Xbox Scorpio on the way -- but I'd like to see a higher yield and a lower P/E before I start a position. \nA secret billion-dollar stock opportunity \nThe world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology. And we think its stock price has nearly unlimited room to run for early in-the-know investors! To be one of them, just click here . \nLeo Sun owns shares of Salesforce.com .

      "text": "Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) and IBM (NYSE: IBM) are frequently cited as \"mature\" tech stocks that you buy for income and stability instead of growth. Both stocks have outperformed the S&P 500's 4% gain -- Microsoft is up 9% for the year, and IBM has climbed about 13%. But is either stock still worth buying today with the market near all-time highs?\nContinue Reading Below\nThe Surface Pro Studio. Image source: Microsoft.\nThe similarities between Microsoft and IBM At first glance, Microsoft and IBM are very different companies. Microsoft generates most its revenue from licensing and subscription fees for Windows and Office. It generates additional revenue from sales of its Azure cloud platform Dynamics CRM, Surface hardware, Xbox consoles, and search-based ads. IBM's core business is split between business services, technology services, hardware systems, and enterprise software.\nMore From Fool.com Motley Fool Founders Issue New Stock Buy Alert Forget GE! Heres how to play the largest growth opportunity in history Forget Apple! Heres a Better Stock to Buy He Made 21,078% Buying Amazon. Heres His New Pick But Microsoft and IBM both face two similar challenges -- slower enterprise spending, and the technological shift toward mobile and cloud-based solutions. Sluggish enterprise spending causes companies to stick with older versions of Windows and Office, and to spend less on IBM's IT services, hardware, and software. Both companies are also struggling to remain relevant in a mobile world . That's why Microsoft's revenue fell 2% last year, while IBM's top line declined 12%.\nNeither Microsoft nor IBM has a meaningful presence in mobile hardware, but both companies are pivoting their businesses toward higher-growth cloud solutions to offset declines in other older businesses. Microsoft's core strategy in that market revolves around growing its commercial cloud business (Office 365, Dynamics, Azure), which achieved an annual run rate of $13 billion last quarter.\nContinue Reading Below",

      "text": "By Transparency Market Research Nov 10, 2016 Inclusion body myositis (IBM) is an age related muscle disorder, which is most common among aged individuals and it may lead to severe disability due to its incurable nature. This muscle disorder is mainly characterized by inflammatory myopathy that slowly progresses and causes weakness of the limbs, least or no reflexes from deep tendons, mixing of neurogenic and myopathic changes in electromyography as well as dysphasia. Many a times, IBM remains under-diagnosed as it occurs mainly in the aged individuals, with several co-morbidities, and hence, often misdiagnosed with polymyositis. People over 50 years of age suffering from polymyositis mostly suffer from inclusion body myositis. Get the Exemplified Analysis of Inclusion Body Myositis Worldwide Trends: http://bit.ly/2eHvMR4Major structural features of IBM include cytoplasmic vacuolation, inflammatory infiltrate and tubo-filamentous inclusions within the nuclei and cytoplasm of the muscle cells. For proper and effective management of IBM, adoption of appropriate diagnostic and therapeutic procedure is essential. Some routine tests can also be adopted for early detection of IBM, such as, tests for full blood count (FBC), calcium and phosphate, creatine kinase, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and fasting glucose among others. Some of the specific tests include, nerve conduction tests, electromyography, muscle biopsy (for beta-amyloid and ubiquitin) and electron microscopy. However, there is no therapeutic procedure that has been proved effective in curing IBM. Several therapies are in different stages of clinical trials by different manufacturers worldwide.Some of the major driving factors for the growth of IBM market, include, high prevalence of the disorder, growing geriatric population, rising demand for advance therapeutics for specific and effective treatment of IBM and increasing number of drugs for IBM treatment in the pipeline. IBM is the most prevalent muscle disorder that mainly affects people over 50 years of age, but people may suffer from this disorder between 20 to 80 years of their ages. According to the estimates of patient.co.uk, it was found that a population of 10.7 individuals per million in the U.S. are suffering from this disorder. The disease prevalence was least in the Netherlands in Europe with a population of 4.9 individuals per million. It was also found that people over 50 years of age in the least disease prevalent nations like Netherlands and Sweden have shown a prevalence of 16 individuals per million. Also, men are more prone to IBM with 4:1 to 3:1 ratio compared to the female population. Thus, high prevalence along with high geriatric population will contribute towards the growth of this market. Rising demand for advanced therapeutics and increasing number of drugs in the pipeline will contribute towards the growth of this market in future.Geographically, North America and Europe are expected to dominate the global inclusion body myositis market in future. Some of the key factors responsible for their dominance in this market can be the presence of high geriatric population along with high demand for advanced therapeutics for effective treatment of this disorder in these regions. However, emerging economies, such as, China, India, Russia, Brazil, South Africa, Turkey, Indonesia, Mexico and others from Asia-Pacific, Middle East, LATAM and African regions will experience rapid growth in future. Some of the key factors responsible for their growth in this market in future are high economic growth, increasing healthcare awareness, developing healthcare infrastructure and rising affordability of the people in these regions. Some of the key players having their drugs in different phases of clinical trials in this market are Gradalis, Inc., New Zealand Pharmaceuticals Ltd., Nobelpharma Co., Ltd., and Novartis AG.

      "text": "CAMBRIDGE, Mass. , Nov. 10, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- IBM Watson Health (NYSE: IBM ) and the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard today announced a research initiative aimed at discovering the basis of cancer drug resistance. The five year, $50 million project will study thousands of drug resistant tumors and draw on Watson's computational and machine learning methods to help researchers understand how cancers become resistant to therapies. The anonymized data will be made available to the scientific community to catalyze research worldwide. \nWhile a growing number of cancer treatments can hold cancers in check for months or years, most cancers eventually recur. This is in part because they acquire mutations that make them drug resistant. The development of drug resistance is a major cause of nearly 600,000 annual cancer deaths in the United States alone (1) . In a limited number of cases, scientists have discovered the cause of drug resistance, allowing the development of new drugs to overcome resistance. In most cases, however, the causes of drug resistance are not fully understood. \nTo help understand how cancers become resistant to specific therapies, Broad Institute will generate tumor genome sequence data from patients who initially respond to treatment but who then become drug-resistant. Broad will use new genome-editing methods to conduct large-scale cancer drug resistance studies in the laboratory, to help identify tumors' specific vulnerabilities. IBM scientists will use Watson to analyze this data and identify genomic patterns that may help researchers and clinicians predict drug sensitivity and resistance. \nThis new partnership is expected to help lay a new foundation for understanding the basis of drug resistance in cancer - especially the genetic mechanisms observed in patients - and accelerate research across the cancer community to turn knowledge of resistance mechanisms into therapies.",

      "text": "Contact(s) information \nLONDON - 10 Nov 2016: IBM (NYSE: IBM ) announced today that it is working with Travis Perkins PLC to extract value by moving key business processes into the cloud, improving data quality and reaching customers through every channel. This provides the British builders' merchant and home improvement retailer with a competitive advantage in the industry’s crowded market. Travis Perkins PLC, which is a Group of 21 businesses, is using IBM Business Process Manager (iBPM) on Cloud via an IBM Cloud data centre in London to better manage multiple data governance processes for data collection, coordination and approvals. This cloud solution is part of Travis Perkins’\"Highway to Cloud\" initiative, which aims to move all key applications to the cloud within the next three years. By improving data quality and connecting multiple, diverse sets of product information, the retailer can better manage and optimize its data collection to be more efficient and agile.\n“Before managing our business processes and data collection using iBPM on Cloud, we lacked visibility of change requests and data validation, which is needed to ensure that our customers get the best possible data to inform shopping experience,\" said David Todd, Group Data Director, Travis Perkins. \"IBM iBPM on Cloud gives us more flexibility, scalability and performance options to deliver a better solution to improve our data processes and support our in-store colleagues across our 2,000-plus UK stores.\" \nCustomers will also soon be able to use Travis Perkins’ new click-and-collect service to place orders online and then pick up those products from their closest branch. This is particularly useful for builders and DIYers using mobile devices to order supplies from job sites. Click-and-collect services are hugely popular [1] in the UK with almost 3 in 4 online shoppers – 73 percent – saying they have used click-and-collect services last year, and another 10 percent of British consumers intending to use such services in the near future. Travis Perkins hopes to continue improving its customer experience by expanding its use of data analytics and cognitive technologies to identify buying trends and customer behaviours to create more customized target marketing campaigns. \n“More clients like Travis Perkins are turning to IBM Cloud to help transform their business,” says Sebastian Krause, General Manager, Cloud, IBM Europe. “By combining analytics solutions like business processes with the IBM Cloud, Travis Perkins can address its customers’ ever-increasing requirements with greater levels of personalisation both online and offline.

      "text": " Google+\nAFP/Getty Images\nIBM’s Watson supercomputer gets better at analyzing data over time .\nBy Priyanka Dayal McCluskey Globe Staff November 10, 2016\nThe tech giant IBM Corp. is team up with one of Cambridge’s top research institutitons for a $50 million study on why so many cancer patients become resistant to drugs.\nThe Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard plans to collect genetic data from the tumors of about 10,000 patients from across the country over five years. That data will be analyzed by lab scientists at Broad, then crunched by IBM’s Watson supercomputer.\nAdvertisement\nThe goal, IBM and Broad executives said, is to scour the data to help answer one of the most difficult questions about cancer treatment: why some cancers respond to certain treatments, and why some don’t. Drug resistance contributes to the 600,000 cancer deaths in the United States each year.\nSometimes patients don’t respond to a treatment at all. Sometimes the drug works for a while, then stops being effective. Scientists believe that genetic differences can explain why drugs work in some cases but not others.\nGet Business Headlines “You get people through the first phase of treatment, and the cancer mutates, and all of a sudden you’re trying to play whack-a-mole,” said Kathy McGroddy-Goetz, vice president of partnerships and solutions for IBM Watson Health , which is headquartered in Cambridge.\nIBM and Broad said this is the largest study of its kind. Eventually, the research could help doctors prescribe more effective combinations of drugs for cancer patients.This could also help reduce spending on ineffective drugs, which can cost tens of thousands of dollars per patient.\n“If you put somebody on a treatment and it doesn’t work,” McGroddy-Goetz said, “you‘ve spent a whole lot of money, and now you have to start all over.”\nAdvertisement\nAt Broad, as many as 100 people -- including genomic experts, computational biologists, and physicians -- will be involved in the research project with IBM.\nDr. Todd Golub, chief scientific officer at the Broad Institute, said researchers will obtain the “genomic fingerprints” of tumors and compare them before patients are treated, and again after the tumors develop resistance to drugs. The molecular differences between the two tumor samples will help provide clues about why resistance occurs, he said.\nThe problem is common among patients who have skin, colon, lung, ovarian, and other cancers. “Unfortunately, it appears that this problem of drug resistance is not an exception, it’s more the rule. So we really need to understand it better,” Golub said.\nBroad will enroll patients in the study with the help of hospitals and cancer centers throughout the country. The data that researchers develop will be shared with the broader scientific community, a concept that many experts consider key to helping accelerate cancer research.\nIBM will use the research data to develop software that it can sell to the doctors and hospitals. The New York-based company launched its Watson Health unit last year and has been quickly ramping up the business. Watson is a supercomputer that is constantly updated with new information, so its analyses improve over time. IBM uses Watson to sort through tomes of health care data, developing recommendations that can help doctors sift through drugs, clinical trials, and medical images.\nPriyanka Dayal McCluskey can be reached at priyanka.mccluskey@globe.com .

      "text": "IBM PureData System for Hadoop \nBig Data is a phrase used to mean a massive volume of both structured and unstructured data that is so large it is difficult to process using traditional database and software techniques. In most enterprise scenarios the volume of data is too big or it moves too fast or it exceeds current processing capacity. \nBig Data has the potential to help companies improve operations and make faster, more intelligent decisions. This data, when captured, formatted, manipulated, stored, and analyzed can help a company to gain useful insight to increase revenues, get or retain customers, and improve operations. Is Big Data a Volume or a Technology? \nWhile the term may seem to reference the volume of data, that isn't always the case. The term Big Data, especially when used by vendors, may refer to the technology (which includes tools and processes) that an organization requires to handle the large amounts of data and storage facilities. The term is believed to have originated with Web search companies who needed to query very large distributed aggregations of loosely-structured data. An Example \nAn example of Big Data might be petabytes (1,024 terabytes) or exabytes (1,024 petabytes) of data consisting of billions to trillions of records of millions of people—all from different sources (e.g. Web, sales, customer contact center, social media, mobile data and so on). The data is typically loosely structured data that is often incomplete and inaccessible. Types of Business Datasets \nWhen dealing with larger datasets , organizations face difficulties in being able to create, manipulate, and manage big data. Big Data is particularly a problem in business analytics because standard tools and procedures are not designed to search and analyze massive datasets. \nAs research from Webopedia parent company QuinStreet demonstrates, big data initiatives are poised for explosive growth. QuinStreet surveyed 540 enterprise decision-makers involved in big data and found the datasets of interest to many businesses today include traditional structured databases of inventories, orders, and customer information, as well as unstructured data from the Web, social networking sites, and intelligent devices. \nBig Data may also be called enterprise Big Data or big data.",

      "text": "Leading retailer chooses IBM Business Process Manager on Cloud as part of transformational “Highway to Cloud” strategy Select a topic or year \nLONDON - 10 Nov 2016: IBM (NYSE: IBM ) announced today that it is working with Travis Perkins PLC to extract value by moving key business processes into the cloud, improving data quality and reaching customers through every channel. This provides the British builders' merchant and home improvement retailer with a competitive advantage in the industry’s crowded market. \nTravis Perkins PLC, which is a Group of 21 businesses, is using IBM Business Process Manager (iBPM) on Cloud via an IBM Cloud data centre in London to better manage multiple data governance processes for data collection, coordination and approvals. This cloud solution is part of Travis Perkins’ \"Highway to Cloud\" initiative, which aims to move all key applications to the cloud within the next three years. By improving data quality and connecting multiple, diverse sets of product information, the retailer can better manage and optimize its data collection to be more efficient and agile. \n“Before managing our business processes and data collection using iBPM on Cloud, we lacked visibility of change requests and data validation, which is needed to ensure that our customers get the best possible data to inform shopping experience,\" said David Todd, Group Data Director, Travis Perkins. \" IBM iBPM on Cloud gives us more flexibility, scalability and performance options to deliver a better solution to improve our data processes and support our in-store colleagues across our 2,000-plus UK stores. \" \nCustomers will also soon be able to use Travis Perkins’ new click-and-collect service to place orders online and then pick up those products from their closest branch. This is particularly useful for builders and DIYers using mobile devices to order supplies from job sites. Click-and-collect services are hugely popular [1] in the UK with almost 3 in 4 online shoppers – 73 percent – saying they have used click-and-collect services last year, and another 10 percent of British consumers intending to use such services in the near future. Travis Perkins hopes to continue improving its customer experience by expanding its use of data analytics and cognitive technologies to identify buying trends and customer behaviours to create more customized target marketing campaigns. \n“More clients like Travis Perkins are turning to IBM Cloud to help transform their business,” says Sebastian Krause, General Manager, Cloud, IBM Europe. “By combining analytics solutions like business processes with the IBM Cloud, Travis Perkins can address its customers’ ever-increasing requirements with greater levels of personalisation both online and offline.

      "title": "IBM Watson Health and Broad Institute Launch Major Research Initiative to Study Why Cancers Become Drug Resistant",
      "text": "Related resources \nCAMBRIDGE, MA - 10 Nov 2016: IBM Watson Health (NYSE: IBM ) and the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard today announced a research initiative aimed at discovering the basis of cancer drug resistance. The five year, $50 million project will study thousands of drug resistant tumors and draw on Watson’s computational and machine learning methods to help researchers understand how cancers become resistant to therapies. The anonymized data will be made available to the scientific community to catalyze research worldwide. While a growing number of cancer treatments can hold cancers in check for months or years, most cancers eventually recur. This is in part because they acquire mutations that make them drug resistant. The development of drug resistance is a major cause of nearly 600,000 annual cancer deaths in the United States alone (1) . In a limited number of cases, scientists have discovered the cause of drug resistance, allowing the development of new drugs to overcome resistance. In most cases, however, the causes of drug resistance are not fully understood.\nTo help understand how cancers become resistant to specific therapies, Broad Institute will generate tumor genome sequence data from patients who initially respond to treatment but who then become drug-resistant. Broad will use new genome-editing methods to conduct large-scale cancer drug resistance studies in the laboratory, to help identify tumors’ specific vulnerabilities. IBM scientists will use Watson to analyze this data and identify genomic patterns that may help researchers and clinicians predict drug sensitivity and resistance. \nThis new partnership is expected to help lay a new foundation for understanding the basis of drug resistance in cancer – especially the genetic mechanisms observed in patients – and accelerate research across the cancer community to turn knowledge of resistance mechanisms into therapies. \n“Defeating cancer involves playing a high-stakes game of biological chess. When we make a move with a therapy, cancer often responds with a counter-move by finding a way to become resistant. The key will be learning from clinical experience, so that we know cancer’s moves in advance and can plan strategies to cut off its escape routes,” said Eric Lander, founding director of the Broad Institute. “Knowing how cancers can become resistant will ultimately require learning from hundreds of thousands of patients’ experiences. We’re proud to work with IBM to make an important start toward this goal, and to make the information broadly available to the scientific community.” \n“The Broad Institute is leading the industry in areas of cancer biology, genomics and computational biology, and we are proud to bring Watson’s data prowess to help researchers learn more about one of most important medical challenges that too often stands in the way of effective cancer treatment,” said John Kelly III, senior vice president, Cognitive Solutions and IBM Research. “Watson is already being used in the clinic to aid clinicians in cancer care. Our hope is that this effort, if successful, could eventually lead to significant breakthroughs. Someday, patients who would not otherwise have options in their battle against cancer may have reason for hope.” \n“Currently, cancer researchers have access to genomic information from only a few hundred drug-resistant cancers samples. In addition to the goals of this specific study, IBM and Broad are committed to advancing cancer research by sharing the data from thousands of tumor samples with the scientific community to accelerate progress everywhere against cancer,” said Todd Golub, M.D., chief scientific officer and founder of the cancer program at the Broad Institute. “What we and many others will learn with this information will have important implications for the future of cancer precision medicine and cancer diagnostics.” \nEarlier this month, IBM and Quest Diagnostics launched IBM Watson Genomics from Quest Diagnostics , a service available to oncologists nationwide to help advance precision medicine by combining cognitive computing with genomic tumor sequencing. The collaboration with the Broad Institute announced today is the latest application of Watson for Genomics to help researchers and clinicians tackle the challenges and opportunities of cancer genomics. \nAbout IBM Watson Health \nWatson is the first commercially available cognitive computing capability representing a new era in computing. The system, delivered through the cloud, analyzes high volumes of data, understands complex questions posed in natural language, and proposes evidence-based answers. Watson continuously learns, gaining in value and knowledge over time, from previous interactions. In April 2015, the company launched IBM Watson Health and the Watson Health Cloud platform. The new unit will help improve the ability of doctors, researchers and insurers to innovate by surfacing insights from the massive amount of personal health data being created and shared daily. The Watson Health Cloud can mask individual identities and allow this information to be shared and combined with a dynamic and constantly growing aggregated view of clinical, research and social health data.

The Broad Institute seeks to describe all the molecular components of life and their connections; discover the molecular basis of major human diseases; develop effective new approaches to diagnostics and therapeutics; and disseminate discoveries, tools, methods, and data openly to the entire scientific community. \nFounded by MIT, Harvard, Harvard-affiliated hospitals, and the visionary Los Angeles philanthropists Eli and Edythe L. Broad, the Broad Institute includes faculty, professional staff, and students from throughout the MIT and Harvard biomedical research communities and beyond, with collaborations spanning over a hundred private and public institutions in more than 40 countries worldwide.

      "text": "Tech giant IBM handily describes APIs as “the building blocks of transformation” and “the digital glue that links services, applications and systems”.\nNB: This is an article written by Tnooz in conjunction with Sabre . It follows on from a special report “ Mobile in Travel – The End-to-End Impact ”.\nIBM estimates the API economy will be worth $2.2 trillion in 2018 .\nIn the same way that digital commerce has moved beyond ecommerce and is increasingly about mcommerce (mobile commerce), APIs have adapted as well and are pivotal to the continuing development of mcommerce.\nA critical part of mobile’s role in travel is its role in last minute bookings, in turn boosting mobile’s conversion rate. A Phocuswright report revealed that conversion via mobile for OTAs has often been double that of desktop (5% vs. 2.2%).\nAnd while more than half of all mobile flight bookings are made within seven days of travel, only 18% of searches occur within that timeframe.\nDeveloping the connection \nThe joy of the API economy is the connectivity it facilitates. In 2015, IBM issued a free beginners’ guide to APIs under the Wiley’s “For Dummies…” brand , which used a travel example to highlight how they should be part of your end-to-end business design.\n“Consider a traveler who shares her experiences on social channels. One day, she tweets about a really bad experience with Airline A. Ten minutes later, she receives an email from the airline that says: “We’re sorry about your bad experience. Here is what we can do for you.\n“The next week, she has a great travel experience with Airline B, and as usual, she tweets about it. Five minutes later, that airline retweets her tweet with this added text: “Happy you had a good experience. See you next time.”\n“Both these airlines considered in advance how to weave social channels, through the use of APIs, into their overall business operating models.”\nThis bundling of sector-specific APIs with other travel suppliers will drive future innovations. There is also a wealth of generic public APIs such as Twitter and Facebook, mapping, EventBrite, all of which can be positioned in a travel context.\nConnecting the developers \nThe proliferation of hackathons taking place around the world is as clear a sign as any that the API economy has become mainstream. It’s proven to be a great way to show what APIs can do and for a state-of-the-nation summary of APIs in travel.\nJulian Macagno is director of the developer experience at Sabre Travel Network, giving him a dual insight into the world of APIs – the APIs themselves and the developers who work with the APIs.\nLast month Sabre ran its Destination Hack in Singapore. “We had nearly thirty teams with developers from fifteen countries, and more than half of them worked on chatbots, so it’s clearly a space that developers want to be in,” says Macagno.\nLinking up a chatbot API with a travel API is made possible by tech giants opening up their APIs to the developer community.\n“Apple has opened up its iMessage API, as Google has done with Allo. This along with Facebook Messenger, SnapChat and WeChat, enables developers to connect APIs, such as ours, with new mediums to create new travel experiences. This is the next wave of travel tech.”\nFor example, Chat Planner, one of the Destination Hack challenge winners, linked up Sabre APIs with Expedia APIs to create a chatbot engine that identifies travel conversations and turns them into actionable plans.\nWhile developers get excited about chatbots, there is still enough room for innovation across the entire mobile travel space. APIs are driving that innovation. “We’re seeing a lot of ideas coming through based around geo-location and mapping. Lots of projects link Sabre APIs with the public APIs released by Google and Facebook and we’re seeing some clever ideas in the works.”\nThe development of REST APIs – easy to consume and optimized for modern development technologies – has brought a new level of functionality to mobile. Sabre has introduced a number of APIs recently , which address and answer some of the most complex situations specific to travel and serve as an example of how APIs are changing the travel game.\nThe shift towards mobile-optimized APIs is driven by the need to filter the content based on implicit or implied preferences – on any mobile platform. It is about the quality of what is delivered, not the quantity. “This means that the results returned to the device can be personalized more easily to what the user wants at the same time as speeding up the response times, another demand from users.” Macagno explained.\n“When people are looking for travel options on mobile, what happens behind the scenes needs to be fast and powerful and this is where mobile APIs come in. Google talks about impatience, the idea that people are flicking between apps on their phones and aren’t prepared to wait for data to load.”\nOver the past few years, that front-end innovation in terms of the products mobile users see has been supercharged by back-end innovation. “So what Sabre has done is aggregate and orchestrate multiple APIs into one, which improves performance on the mobile device,” he said.\n“For example, our Create Passenger Name Record API bundles several functions and operations to create an air reservation through a single call. This optimizes development efforts and operational efficiencies while providing the faster response times needed for mobile.”\n“Less is more” is a recurring phrase in conversations around mobile, and mobile-optimized APIs are helping that happen. The ultimate goal of Sabre APIs, Macagno said, “is to remove the complexities of travel. We handle that so the developers can build a better experience for the end-user, the traveler, which is what the GDSs have always been about.”\n\nNB1 : This is an article written by Tnooz in conjunction with Sabre as part of Tnooz’s sponsored content initiative .

      "text": "November 10, 2016 at 09:00 AM EST Niara Receives IBM PartnerWorld's Ready for IBM Security Intelligence Validation, Joins IBM Security App Exchange Community \nSUNNYVALE, CA -- (Marketwired) -- 11/10/16 -- Niara, an innovator in the use of machine learning for precision attack detection and accelerated incident response, today announced it has received IBM PartnerWorld's Ready for IBM Security Intelligence designation for Niara's User and Entity Behavior Analytics solution. As a result, Niara UEBA has been validated to integrate with IBM Security products to help better protect customers around the world. \nThe new Niara User and Entity Behavior Analysis for IBM QRadar reduces alert white noise and accelerates response time by utilizing QRadar data to provide a new dimension of analytics, enabled by over 100 rule-less machine learning models designed to detect attacks that have evaded real time defenses while providing detailed forensic visibility. \n\"The power of Niara's advanced analytics and consolidated forensic data within QRadar's security intelligence platform will enable security analysts to focus on critical alerts and cut down incident investigations from hours and days to minutes,\" said Larry Lunetta, VP Business Development for Niara. \nThe Ready for IBM Security Intelligence alliance is designed to promote technology collaboration and integration to expand and enhance security coverage, collapse silos of information, and increase situational awareness and insights. With the PartnerWorld program and Ready for Security Intelligence validation, IBM supports collaboration with its Business Partners to enable the integration of product capabilities and improved security capabilities for mutual customers. \nThe new application is freely available to the security community through IBM Security App Exchange, a marketplace where developers across the industry can share applications based on IBM Security technologies. As threats are evolving faster than ever, collaborative development amongst the security community will help organizations adapt quickly and speed innovation in the fight against cybercrime. \nThe Niara UEBA QRadar application leverages IBM QRadar, the company's security intelligence platform which analyzes data across an organization's IT infrastructure in real-time to identify potential security threats. Leveraging QRadar's new open application programming interfaces (API), Niara UEBA for QRadar allows Niara to provide IBM customers on-console QRadar access to precision alerts built from Niara's machine learning models, designed specifically to find and interpret small changes in behavior that often signal a slowly-gestating attack. \nRunning on a Spark/Hadoop Big Data platform, the solution also continuously updates a risk score for a user, system or IP address along with a complete record of security activity down to the packet level. With this streamlined access to a complete forensic record, Niara customers have measured up to 30 hours of savings per incident investigation, a benefit that QRadar customers can now also experience. \nAbout Niara \nNiara's behavioral analytics platform automates the detection of attacks and risky behaviors inside an organization and dramatically reduces the time and skill needed to investigate and respond to security events. The solution applies machine learning algorithms to data from the network and security infrastructure to detect compromised users, entities, and negligent or malicious insiders, reduce the time for incident investigation and response, and speed threat hunting efforts by focusing security teams on the threats that matter. Headquartered in Sunnyvale, Calif., the company is backed by NEA, Index Ventures and Venrock. For more information, visit www.niara.com . \nPress Contact:",

      "text": "Bank Castles Of Sand: Blockchain Edition (Seeking Alpha) \nInternational Business Machines Corp. (NYSE: IBM ) has been making significant investments in M&A and restructuring. With the pace of these investments expected to decline and IBM poised to benefit from these efforts, the company faces “multiple levers to drive earnings growth in 2017,” Bank of America Merrill Lynch’s Wamsi Mohan said in a report. \nMohan upgraded the rating on the company from Neutral to Buy, while raising the price target from $170 to $185. Reasons For Upgrade \nMohan mentioned ten reasons for upgrading IBM to Buy: Earnings seem to have stabilized, and large negative revisions are unlikely. Cash flow per share would likely be flat or up in 2017. IBM’s dividend yield of 3.6 percent appears attractive “when accounting for the optionality of success in growth markets like Artificial Intelligence.” The company would face tailwinds in 2017 from lower restricting charges and savings from restructuring efforts. IBM is unlikely to increase its pace of investments, resulting in benefits from increased utilization SaaS revenues would begin contributing to a higher percentage of growth. The slowdown in IBM’s constant currency organic growth is likely to moderate and could turn to positive in 2018. Mainframe cycle in 2017 could drive a recovery in transactional revenues. “CIO survey suggests IBM gaining mindshare in business intelligence, analytics and Watson .” The company’s shares are currently trading at a discount on earnings to peers. \nMinutes after Thursday's opening bell, IBM was up 2.51 percent at $158.70.
