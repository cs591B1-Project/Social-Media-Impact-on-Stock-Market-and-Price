      "text": "Apple Grabs 66% Of Premium Smartphone Sales In India  05 PST \nWith Apple’s iPhones being so expensive and are probably the most expensive smartphones in the market today, we’re sure some are wondering how on earth is Apple going to survive in emerging markets such as India? Turns out that there was nothing to worry about as Apple seems to be doing just fine. \nAccording to the latest numbers , it seems that Apple has managed to grab 66% of premium smartphone sales in the country. This means that more than half of the premium smartphone sales in India have gone to Apple. The company’s closest and fiercest rival, Samsung, only managed 23%, while Google only accounted for 10%, and the remaining 1% is attributed to all other brands. \nApple has seen this coming as back in October during the company’s earnings call, CEO Tim Cook told analysts, “Our iPhone sales in India were up over 50 percent in fiscal 2016 compared to the prior year, and we believe we’re just beginning to scratch the surface of this large and growing market opportunity.” \nHe also added, “The truth is there’s going to be a lot of people there and a lot of people in the middle class that will really want a smartphone, and I think we can compete well for some percentage of those.” \nFiled in Apple > Cellphones .

REUTERS/Steven Saphore \nNovember 29, 2016 \nSYDNEY (Reuters) – Three of Australia’s four biggest banks will be barred from collectively bargaining with Apple Inc <AAPL.O> in relation to its mobile digital payments system, under a draft decision released by the antitrust regulator on Tuesday. \nThe Australian Competition and Consumer Commission said letting banks collectively offer their own integrated digital wallets in Apple iPhones, in competition with Apple’s Apple Pay system, would reduce each bank’s ability to negotiate with the U.S. firm. \n“While the ACCC accepts that the opportunity for the banks to collectively negotiate and boycott would place them in a better bargaining position with Apple, the benefits are currently uncertain and may be limited,” commission chairman Rod Sims said in a statement. \nThe decision is a setback for the banks’ hopes to bypass Apple’s in-house payments system and roll out their own versions free of competition from the Silicon Valley giant, which has the biggest smartphone market share in Australia. \nIt also sets a precedent which may solidify Apple’s dominance of the digital wallet system globally, since the Australian banks had mounted the first challenge to it. \nApple Pay allows users to register credit cards on devices such as iPhones, and pay for goods and services by swiping the devices over contactless payment terminals. Apple charges card providers for transactions via the service, which it introduced to Australia last year. \nCommonwealth Bank of Australia <CBA.AX>, Westpac Banking Corp <WBC.AX>, National Australia Bank Ltd <NAB.AX> and smaller Bendigo and Adelaide Bank Ltd <BEN.AX>, which jointly have two-thirds of the Australian credit card market, argued that letting Apple restrict use of mobile wallets was anti-competitive. \nApple argued that it had not granted access to its digital wallet technology to third-parties anywhere in the world because it would undermine customers’ privacy and data security. \nA representative for the banks behind the application was not immediately available for comment. \nThe ACCC said it would consult further and give a final decision in March 2017. \nAustralia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd <ANZ.AX>, Australia’s fourth biggest bank by market capitalisation, has its own digital wallet agreement with Apple. \n(Reporting by Jamie Freed and Byron Kaye; Editing by Richard Pullin and Stephen Coates)",

      "text": "best apple watch bands ullu band gall More Apple made it very easy to change the strap on your Apple Watch Series 1 and Series 2, but it made the official straps it sells very, very expensive. Beautiful though they are, there’s no need to be limited to Apple’s range of replacement bands, regardless of how much you have to spend.\nRelated: Ten annoying Apple Watch problems, and how to fix them\nLike putting your phone inside a case, changing the strap on your watch is the quickest way to give it an entirely new look, and it’s easy to build up a collection that goes with different outfits, or for when you’re doing certain activities. The choice is huge, so we’ve gathered together a list of our favorite straps and bands for the Apple Watch here.\nSouthern Straps Nato Strap ($25) A more textured nylon strap than the Nyloon example below, the Southern Straps band also has stitching running down each section, giving it a different look. It feels very hard-wearing, and has been double bonded and heat sealed to make sure it doesn’t just fall apart under tough conditions. We love the khaki and red version seen here, which comes with a choice of colors for the Apple Watch connectors, and in either 38mm or 42mm sizes. Let down slightly by the strap loop, which sometimes pinched wrist hairs.\nBuy one now from:\nAmazon Southern Straps\nNyloon Watch Band ($39) Nyloon’s nylon watch band feels like it’ll last a while and withstand some rough treatment, which is just what you need from this popular style. We’ve been wearing the Napier design, which comes in navy blue and red, and found it comfortable and stylish. The shiny hardware is attractive, and the Apple Watch adapter pieces have spring-loaded bars, so you can swap out the strap for another 20mm or 22m version of your own choice.\nBuy one now from:\nNyloon\nNomad Leather Strap ($60) Nomad’s classic leather strap, found elsewhere on our list, is available at a lower cost at the moment, but its new version has a more modern style. It loses the stitching for a sleeker, flatter look. We particularly love Nomad’s straps due to the custom designed Watch adapters, which change the look of the Watch’s face considerably. Both the adapters and the buckle have a matt finish and also come in black, ready to match your Watch model. It’s still quite a masculine design, but less so than the previous strap. The Horween leather is wonderfully supple out of the box and needs only a few hours to bed in.\nBuy one now from:\nNomad\nNomad Vulcanized LSR Silicone Strap ($40) If you like the stylish custom Nomad Watch adaptors, but don’t want a leather strap, then its new silicone strap may appeal. Incredibly soft, completely waterproof, and friendly to the skin, it’s the ideal accompaniment to the new swim-proof Apple Watch Series 2. The hardware comes in sliver or black, and the latter attached to a black watch gives a very cool stealth look. Unlike some silicone straps, the Nomad doesn’t get sweaty thanks to a special channel on the underside of the strap, but it did catch the hair on my arm occasionally.\nBuy one now from:\nNomad\nPad & Quill Field Strap ($100) Pad & Quill’s Field Strap is an interesting take on the fabric Watch strap, combining very hard wearing Cordura fabric with classy and comfortable leather, along with nickel hardware. The leather is stitched to the fabric on the underside, making the strap very easy to wear. Leather is also incorporated into other areas to give the band some visual excitement. The black and gray color combo is our pick, as it’s versatile enough to match most outfits and situations. Next to Nomad’s silicone strap, this is one of the most comfortable Apple Watch straps we’ve worn recently.\nBuy one now from:\nPad & Quill\nUllu Watch Band ($100+) Ullu Apple Watch Strap More Read More Using sustainable leather sourced from Italy, Thailand, Africa, and the U.S., these handcrafted leather bands are beautiful, and come in a wide range of rich colors. Available for both Apple Watch sizes, there’s a choice between premium or hand-colored leather, or moving up to the more expensive options of ostrich, stingray, or alligator leather. You can pick a case for your iPhone or iPad in the same color, for a complete matching look.\nBuy one now from:\nUllu Shop\nLunatik Epik Apple Watch Kit ($46+) Lunatik Epic Bike Lifestyle More If just changing the strap isn’t enough to transform the look of your Apple Watch, how about wrapping the body up in a chunky case at the same time? That’s the solution provided by Lunatik and its crazy Epik watch straps. The body is made from aluminum and protects the Apple Watch, while still allowing the sensors room to work, and the strap is made from silicone. It all works and fits together as one, giving your Watch a look like no other.\nBuy one now from:\nAmazon\nIncipio Premium Leather Band ($30+) View photos\nIncipio Premium Leather Band More Made from leather with stainless steel metalwork, Incipio’s Watch strap is more subtle than many other leather options, with a slimmer, sleeker profile. Made for the 38mm and 42mm watches, the strap comes in a choice of two shades of brown, or a darker black color. Incipio’s smartphones cases are great, and this strap has a classic design that’s sure to appeal to anyone who doesn’t want too much flash on their wrist.\nBuy one now from:\nAmazon\nBurkley Soft Leather Band ($60) Burkley Soft Leather Band More You’ll love the look and feel of these soft, genuine leather straps for the Apple Watch. Burkley is expert at fashioning leather accessories, and these straps come in a choice of different finishes and with different buckle styles. The antique coffee finish with the classic buckle gets our vote, but you can pick whatever suits you. The clasp is included, for your chosen size. You’ll find the natural leather ages, so it looks even better when it’s worn in.\nBuy one now from:\nAmazon Burkley\nPad & Quill Lowry Leather Cuff ($130) Pad and Quill Lowry Cuff Apple Watch Strap More Renowned for its high quality, great looking leather Apple accessories, Pad & Quill makes three different straps for the Apple Watch, but we’ve singled out the Lowry Leather Cuff. Made from full grain leather in black, chestnut, or tan colors, with hand finished stitching and nickel buckles, the look is rugged yet classy. Suede on the underside of the strap makes it comfortable to wear. The one problem? It’s only for the 42mm Apple Watch.\nBuy one now from:\nPad & Quill\nMonowear Design Nylon Strap ($48) View photos\nMonowear Design Nylon Strap More Monowear Design has a wide range of straps for the Apple Watch, but its Nylon range stands out as good value, plus there are several customization options to ensure it perfectly matches your own watch. The strap comes in various colors, while the buckle and adaptors come in stainless steel, silver, space black, rose gold, or gold. Straps are sold for the 38mm and 42mm Apple Watch.\nBuy one now from:\nAmazon\nForm Function Form Button Stud Band ($48+) View photos\nForm Function Form Button Stud Band More If you want something a little different, then take a look at Form Function Form’s funky Button Stud strap, which does away with any type of buckle or clasp. Instead, it has a stainless steel stud that holds a long, leather band in place. The stud and adaptor can be ordered in the color to suit your Apple Watch, just make sure you check the length to ensure the overall fit is correct. The company even provides lifetime, free size adjustments if you buy one.\nBuy one now from:\nBirchBox Form Function\nHyperLink Bracelet ($30) HyperLink Bracelet More A design classic, this stainless steel bracelet costs a fraction of Apple’s version, yet is made from the same material. It looks fantastic, has a cool clasp, and promises not to catch hair or skin even when worn all day. We tried an early version, and had no issues with it at all. Available in silver or a specially produced space black to match your Watch, you can buy the HyperLink bracelet for either the 38mm or 42mm watch.\nBuy one now from:\nHyperLink\nClessant Nubuck Buffalo ($115) View photos\nClessant Nubuck Buffalo More Hardwearing leather straps are everywhere, but nubuck straps are far less common. Clessant sells three in different colors, with the same glorious textured nubuck finish that’s soft on the skin and very easy on the eye. Buffalo leather is apparently more resistant than other types of nubuck leather, so it should stay looking good for longer. We’re partial to the purple version, which comes in 38mm or 42mm sizes, and a choice of adaptor colors.\nBuy one now from:\nClessant Nubuck Buffalo\nArrow & Board Triple Tour Strap ($120) View photos\nArrow & Board Double Tour Split Strap More Apple’s partnership with fashion house Hermes popularized the double tour style strap amongst Watch owners, but picking up a genuine version is very expensive. Arrow & Board’s option is far more reasonable, and comes with a split strap so it can be worn in three different ways. Made to order, it’s finished in tanned leather with hand stitched features and a series of brass loops and a buckle to keep the strap in place.\nBuy one now from:\nArrow & Board\nNomad Strap ($150) Nomad is well-known for its attractive Apple accessories, and its own Apple Watch strap is no exception. The Italian leather is chunky, and the oversize stainless steel buckle and wide loops give the strap a strong, rugged look. The draw here is the untreated leather, which means it’ll age in a way other straps may not, gaining its own character over time. It’s sold for the 38mm and 42mm Apple Watch, comes in three colors, and a choice of black or silver metalwork.\nBuy one now from:\nNomad\nThe best deals on accessories for the iPad, iPhone, and Apple Watch How to order the new iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus, Apple Watch Series 2, and Nike+ Apple Watch Twenty-five cases to keep your iPhone SE looking like new",

      "text": "Apple captured 66% of India's premium smartphone market in October Apple captured 66% of India's premium smartphone market in October Posted: Tags : iOS - iOS + Apple - Apple + With iPhone sales declining in China, we've mentioned that India has become Apple's next big target for its iconic smartphone . Figures from Counterpoint Research, cited in a story published in the India Times , says that in October Apple captured 66% of India's premium handset market. But the truth is that the premium end of the market is not large in the country. That's because the average Indian earns the equivalent of $3.10 USD a day. 70% of the smartphones sold in India last year were priced at under $150.The India Times story noted that Google took a 10% share of the premium smartphone market in India with its new Pixel handsets. Part of the reason for this was due to the removal of the Samsung Galaxy Note 7 from the market place. With Google said to have shipped 33,000 Pixel units into the country during October, Apple's 66% market share converts into approximately 218,000 iPhone units shipped into India last month. \nApple CEO Tim Cook has his eyes focused on India Apple CEO Tim Cook told analysts at Apple's latest quarterly earnings conference call last month that Apple iPhone sales were up 50% year-over-year in India during fiscal 2016. He added that, \"we believe we're just beginning to scratch the surface of this large and growing market opportunity.\" To that end, Apple wants to open Apple Stores in India. However, a law in the country would require 30% of the goods in the store to be produced locally. Back in June, an anonymous source said that the government was mulling over the idea of giving Apple a grace period of two to three years before enforcing the local law.Depending on the source, India is either going to be the second largest smartphone market next year, or it already has achieved that status. So obviously this is an important market for all handset manufacturers including Samsung. The latter is currently second in India's premium market with a 23% share. That puts it ahead of Google, but behind Apple. Here is a good reason why India is Apple's new China. According to Piper Jaffray analyst Gene Munster, the company could add 62 million iOS users in the country by having the same presence in India that it has in China. Getting those Apple Stores put up in India would be one way for Apple to get this process started. \"The truth is there's going to be a lot of people there and a lot of people in the middle class that will really want a smartphone, and I think we can compete well for some percentage of those. And Given our starting point, even though we've been growing a lot, there's a lot of headroom there in our mind. So, we're working very hard to realize that opportunity.\"-Tim Cook, CEO, Apple PhoneArena is on Instagram . Follow us to stay updated with fresh news and flashy media from the world of mobile!",

      "text": "Tweet Share Apple staff are silhouetted through the glass front of Australia's flagship store in the minutes leading up to the first sale of the iPhone 7 and Apple Watch Series 2 in Sydney, September 16, 2016. REUTERS/Steven Saphore More SYDNEY (Reuters) - Three of Australia's four biggest banks will be barred from collectively bargaining with Apple Inc (AAPL.O) in relation to its mobile digital payments system, under a draft decision released by the antitrust regulator on Tuesday. The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission said letting banks collectively offer their own integrated digital wallets in Apple iPhones, in competition with Apple's Apple Pay system, would reduce each bank's ability to negotiate with the U.S. firm. \"While the ACCC accepts that the opportunity for the banks to collectively negotiate and boycott would place them in a better bargaining position with Apple, the benefits are currently uncertain and may be limited,\" commission chairman Rod Sims said in a statement. The decision is a setback for the banks' hopes to bypass Apple's in-house payments system and roll out their own versions free of competition from the Silicon Valley giant, which has the biggest smartphone market share in Australia. It also sets a precedent which may solidify Apple's dominance of the digital wallet system globally, since the Australian banks had mounted the first challenge to it. Apple Pay allows users to register credit cards on devices such as iPhones, and pay for goods and services by swiping the devices over contactless payment terminals. Apple charges card providers for transactions via the service, which it introduced to Australia last year. Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA.AX), Westpac Banking Corp (WBC.AX), National Australia Bank Ltd (NAB.AX) and smaller Bendigo and Adelaide Bank Ltd (BEN.AX), which jointly have two-thirds of the Australian credit card market, argued that letting Apple restrict use of mobile wallets was anti-competitive. Apple argued that it had not granted access to its digital wallet technology to third-parties anywhere in the world because it would undermine customers' privacy and data security. A representative for the banks behind the application was not immediately available for comment. The ACCC said it would consult further and give a final decision in March 2017. Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd (ANZ.AX), Australia's fourth biggest bank by market capitalisation, has its own digital wallet agreement with Apple.

REUTERS/Steven Saphore More SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's antitrust regulator said on Tuesday it was planning to deny some banks authorization to collectively bargain with Apple Inc (AAPL.O) in relation to its mobile digital payment system. The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission said letting banks collectively offer their own integrated digital wallets in Apple iPhones, in competition with Apple's \"Apple Pay\" system, would reduce each individual bank's ability to negotiate with the U.S. technology giant. \"While the ACCC accepts that the opportunity for the banks to collectively negotiate and boycott would place them in a better bargaining position with Apple, the benefits are currently uncertain and may be limited,\" commission chairman Rod Sims said in a statement.

      "text": "Australian regulator to block collective bank bargaining on Apple payment system Reuters Reuters Photo: \nSYDNEY (Reuters) - Three of Australia's four biggest banks will be barred from collectively bargaining with Apple Inc <AAPL.O> in relation to its mobile digital payments system, under a draft decision released by the antitrust regulator on Tuesday. \nThe Australian Competition and Consumer Commission said letting banks collectively offer their own integrated digital wallets in Apple iPhones, in competition with Apple's Apple Pay system, would reduce each bank's ability to negotiate with the U.S. firm. \n\"While the ACCC accepts that the opportunity for the banks to collectively negotiate and boycott would place them in a better bargaining position with Apple, the benefits are currently uncertain and may be limited,\" commission chairman Rod Sims said in a statement. \nThe decision is a setback for the banks' hopes to bypass Apple's in-house payments system and roll out their own versions free of competition from the Silicon Valley giant, which has the biggest smartphone market share in Australia. \nIt also sets a precedent which may solidify Apple's dominance of the digital wallet system globally, since the Australian banks had mounted the first challenge to it. \nApple Pay allows users to register credit cards on devices such as iPhones, and pay for goods and services by swiping the devices over contactless payment terminals. Apple charges card providers for transactions via the service, which it introduced to Australia last year. \nCommonwealth Bank of Australia <CBA.AX>, Westpac Banking Corp <WBC.AX>, National Australia Bank Ltd <NAB.AX> and smaller Bendigo and Adelaide Bank Ltd <BEN.AX>, which jointly have two-thirds of the Australian credit card market, argued that letting Apple restrict use of mobile wallets was anti-competitive. \nApple argued that it had not granted access to its digital wallet technology to third-parties anywhere in the world because it would undermine customers' privacy and data security. \nA representative for the banks behind the application was not immediately available for comment. \nThe ACCC said it would consult further and give a final decision in March 2017. \nAustralia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd <ANZ.AX>, Australia's fourth biggest bank by market capitalisation, has its own digital wallet agreement with Apple. \n(Reporting by Jamie Freed and Byron Kaye; Editing by Richard Pullin and Stephen Coates) Related Links",

      "title": "21 best iPhone 7 Plus cases to protect your Apple phone",
      "text": "best iphone plus cases mujjo More No one likes a bruised apple, and if you drop your new iPhone 7 Plus it could end up scraped, scarred, or worse. The smart play is to invest in some protection. There are lots of different cases out there; some safeguard against drops, some are all about the style, and some add extra functionality. We’ve been checking out your options and these are some of the best iPhone 7 Plus cases you can buy right now.\nRelated : The best iPhone 7 screen protectors to shield your phone’s big, beautiful display\nSnakehive Vintage Leather Wallet ($24) Made from European cowhide nubuck leather, the Snakehive Leather Wallet is one you’ll just want to hold in your hand, it feels so good. It’s all thanks to a wonderfully soft texture on the outside, which has been smoothed out for extra protection on the inside. The iPhone is held in a slim, clear plastic case, with wide cutouts for the volume and power buttons, along with the speakers and charging port too. Opposite are three card slots and a pocket for cash, plus a magnetic clasp that keeps the case closed. The folio case can fold out into a stand for your iPhone 7 Plus, for watching video. Don’t miss this super stylish, real leather folio available in the burgundy seen here, or in chestnut brown and navy colors, at an excellent price.\nBuy one now from:\nSnakehive\nSena Lugano Wallet ($54+) Sena’s Lugano Wallet case covers all the key bases for your iPhone. It protects the body with hard wearing leather and reinforced plastic, along with softer silicone surrounds for the buttons and speakers, plus there’s a herringbone design lining to keep the phone free from scratches when it’s inside the case. The edge is raised to keep the screen away from the surface if placed face down, and the case provides rugged shock absorption. There are also three credit card slots built into the case. Available in cognac, black, and denim colors for the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus for $60.\nBuy one now from:\nAmazon Sena Cases\nSena Wallet Book ($80) This case gives you all the protection offered by Sena’s Lugano Wallet case, but with a folio design that doubles as a hands-free stand for your phone. The folio cover keeps the screen safe from harm and contains space for two credit cards, cash, and an identification card. The herringbone design lining and Heritage leather ensures your iPhone is protected from all angles and sides. It’s also pleasingly easy to fit and remove the phone, however, the case does add considerable size and bulk. It comes in cognac, black, denim, and praline colors for $80.\nBuy one now from:\nEtsy Sena Cases\nVRS Design Duo Guard ($30) It’s called Duo Guard because the case is made from both polycarbonate and TPU plastic, providing MIL-810G standard protection against drops. It looks classier than the usual military-standard protective case, due to a brushed metal effect rear cover, and a metal kickstand built into the case itself. It’s spring-loaded and held closed by a magnetic catch. We like the raised edge to protect the screen, and the grippy sides, which make this a comfortable and secure case to hold. It comes in a range of colors, including the cool silver seen here, for $30.\nBuy one now from:\nVRS Design\nPad & Quill Bella Fino Case ($80) Made from a single piece of leather and embossed with the Pad & Quill name and logo, this is a folio case for the iPhone 7 Plus, that instead of clipping your phone into a built-in case, has a sticky pad to keep it in place. The pad is made by 3M, and leaves no residue if you decide to remove it in the future. The folio case has four credit card holders, an ID window, and space for some cash. The leather feels superb, and the stitching adds character, while the whole case stays relatively slim and lightweight. It’s quite stiff to start with, and needs a few days in a pocket before it softens up and closes properly. There are three colors available and the case costs $80.\nBuy one now from:\nEtsy Pad & Quill\nVRS Design Crystal Mixx ($25) Transparent cases are going to be huge this year, thanks to the Jet Black iPhone 7 Plus and the need for people to show off the flashy new finish. VRS Design’s Crystal Mixx case is made from see-through polycarbonate and has a raised lip to keep the screen away from any surface contact, plus a kickstand on the rear to prop the phone up for watching video. The flexible sides make fitting the case really easy too. We prefer the clear version, but there is a rose gold colored version too.\nRead More Buy one now from:\nVRS Design\nTech21 Impact Clear Case ($40) A lightweight case that still provides some drop protection, which we love because it’s see-through enough to show off our cool new iPhone 7 Plus. The sides are soft enough to make fitting the case easy, but the special protective design and strong material keeps the phone safe. The rear panel is opaque, and has subtle Tech21 branding at the bottom, while the camera cutout is raised enough to protect the iPhone’s lens bump. There’s no screen-protecting lip though, and the button covers require quite a prod to get them working.\nBuy one now from:\nTech21\nTech21 Evo Tactical Extreme Edition ($50) This is a two-piece protective case that also comes with a second section complete with a belt clip, into which the encased phone can be placed either way around, to make sure the screen is fully protected. It’s easy to fit, consisting of a clip-on front cover and an impact-absorbing wrap around case, which then slides safely into the belt clip. Once inside, your phone’s protected even in a 4-meter fall. It’s not subtle, and does add considerable size to the phone, but because it’s easy to fit, you can use it only when needed.\nBuy one now from:\nTech21\nBurkley Ultimate Snap-on Stand Case ($66) The Burkley Ultimate Snap-on Stand Case has a beautiful suede lining, that we almost wish it was on the outside too. Instead, the case is made from far more hard-wearing leather, and has a design that offers an unusual twist on traditional folio style cases. A flap with three credit card slots is hinged, then folds back to prop up your phone for watching videos. When not in use, it’s magnetically held in place. The case is very secure, and once the phone’s in place, it’s not coming out very quickly. There are various leather styles to choose from, and it costs $66.\nBuy one now from:\nBurkley Case\nSkech Matrix ($28+) and Matrix Sparkle ($40) Skech’s unusual combination of soft silicone-style case and impact resistance makes the Matrix case feel like soft, slightly sticky rubber. We like the honeycomb effect on the standard Matrix version, but others will really love the glittery sparkles inside the Matrix Sparkle. There’s also plenty of screen protection from the raised lip on the front, and a very large camera lens cutout on the rear. However, the buttons are quite hard to push.\nBuy one now from:\nMatrix Matrix Sparkle\nSkech Polo Book ($40) A combination of classy folio case, protective hard case, and a handy stand, the Polo Book is suitable for all occasions. The hard case has a leather-look rear panel and a soft lining, but be aware, it’s made of very stiff plastic and once it’s on your phone, it’s a struggle to get it off. It magnetically clips to the folio section, which has two credit card slots and an ID window, plus the whole things folds back to make a stand for the phone. The versatility of only using the folio section when needed, but still protecting your phone with a hard shell case, makes the Polo Book standout.\nBuy one now from:\nAmazon\nGrovemade Walnut & Leather Wallet Case ($140) View photos\nGrovemade Walnut & Leather Wallet Case More Crafted in Portland from gorgeous natural materials, Grovemade’s cases are a bit special. This one combines a walnut wood frame with a full grain leather cover that wraps around the screen. There are tactile button covers and openings for the switch, port, and camera. Open it up, and you’ll find space for a couple of cards and bills. Because it’s wood and leather, this case is going to age and it’s not really designed for drop protection, though it will deflect scrapes and bumps. It does also add some bulk, but it looks fantastic.\nBuy one now from:\nGroveMade\nMujjo Leather Wallet Case ($50) View photos\nMujjo Leather Wallet Case More If you don’t want a folio-style case, but you’re still keen to leave the wallet at home, then this offering from Mujjo could be the one for you. There’s a tough shell to hold your iPhone 7 Plus in place and it’s covered in full grain, vegetable-tanned leather. On the back, you’ll find an angled pocket that’s just right for a card and a bill. The openings are large and offer easy access to all buttons, the port, and the camera. It’s comfortable to hold, but it won’t provide much drop protection. You can get it in black, gray, or tan.\nBuy one now from:\nAmazon\nMoshi Overture Wallet Case ($50) View photos\nMoshi Overture Wallet Case More The cases from Moshi are always beautifully turned out. The Overture combines a solid protective shell with a vegan (fake) leather exterior. The shell provides good drop protection and when you open the cover, you’ll find four slots for cards and IDs and a larger money pocket, as well as a handy Neato microfiber pad to help keep the screen clean. There are button covers for volume and power, and generous openings for the camera, port, and switch, so your iPhone 7 Plus can be used easily while it’s wearing this case. It comes finished in cream, pink, or black with neat stitching and a small metallic Moshi logo.\nBuy one now from:\nMoshi\nDistil Union Wally Wallet Case ($50) View photos\nDistil Union Wally Wallet Case More Here’s a smart design to keep your cash and cards hidden away, but easily accessible when you need them. The shock-absorbent, TPU bumper safeguards your iPhone 7 Plus from impact damage and it’s covered in high-quality leather. On the back, there’s an unobtrusive pocket that can hold up to four credit cards and two folded bills. When you want to get at them, simply pull the red tab and they’ll slide out. The buttons are covered, but there are cut-outs for the camera, port, and switch. You can get this case in black, brown, gray, or red.\nBuy one now from:\nDistil Union\nOtterBox Strada Series Folio Case ($60) View photos\nOtterBox Strada Series Folio Case More You can count on the drop protection you get from OtterBox cases, and it’s rare to find rugged drop protection in a folio or wallet style case like this. The Strada comprises a tough polycarbonate shell with a real, premium leather skin on the top. There’s a cover that closes with a metal latch and when you open it up, you’ll find a single slot for an ID or credit card. This case is tough, stylish, and practical. It comes in two-tone brown or green, or plain black.\nBuy one now from:\nOtterbox\nTech21 Evo Elite Case ($50) View photos\nTech21 Evo Elite Case More The Evo Elite is one of Tech21’s most protective iPhone 7 Plus case and it offers drop protection from up to 6.6 feet. By developing a special shock absorbing material and designing impact absorption into the frame, Tech21 has managed to deliver a really rugged case that isn’t massively bulky, like its Evo Tactical Extreme Edition. If you want a crystal clear option to show the iPhone off, then you’ll need to go for the Impact Clear case instead, but the gold and rose gold versions of the Evo Elite do have clear back panels. Your final option is the Evo Elite in brushed black, which is tinted with a black surround and button covers. The fit is perfect and the openings are generous, offering uninterrupted access to all iPhone features.\nBuy one now from:\nTech21\nNodus Shell Case ($74) View photos\nNodus Shell Case More Leather is a great material for cases because it’s comfortable to hold, it looks great, and it’s pretty durable, but you may not necessarily want to have a wallet case. Nodus offers vegetable-tanned Italian leather in a traditional shell style with this case. The core is polycarbonate, but it’s covered in brown, black, teal, gray, or yellow leather with a soft microfiber lining inside. The case hugs the corners, but there are large cut-outs top and bottom and openings for the switch and camera. Subtly defined button covers mark the volume and power keys. This case is also compatible with the magnetic mounting system for easy docking.\nBuy one now from:\nNodus\nFlexishield Gel Case ($8) View photos\nFlexishield Gel Case More Sometimes you just want a simple, slim covering to add some grip and basic protection. The translucent Flexishield is a good choice in that case and it certainly won’t break the bank. It’s made from a soft gel material, so it’s very easy to fit and it adds grip. There are thin button covers for volume and power and accurate cut-outs for the camera, port, and switch. There’s a slightly raised lip around the screen, but don’t expect rugged protection. It comes in gold, black, blue, and pink.\nBuy one now from:\nMobile Fun\nVRS Design High Pro Shield Case ($30) View photos\nVRS Design High Pro Shield Case More This stylish case has a brushed metal design on the back and a handy kickstand for propping your iPhone 7 Plus in landscape view. The main shell is flexible and shock absorbent and there’s a harder plastic frame that goes on top and sports the kickstand, held in place magnetically. The openings for camera, ports, and switch are generous and the button covers work just fine. There’s also a cut-out on the back for the Apple logo. The inner layer is always black, but you can combine it a frame in black, gold, blue, silver, or rose gold.\nBuy one now from:\nVRS Design\nTerrapin Slim Hard Case ($8) View photos\nTerrapin Slim Hard Case More If you’re looking for a slim, cheap case, but you’d prefer something hard, then check this one out. Terrapin’s cases are devoid of detail, you just get a soft-touch matte finish that’s comfortable to hold and in a plain block color. There are openings for the ports, camera, and controls and the polycarbonate case snaps onto your iPhone 7 Plus for a snug fit. It’s only going to provide very limited protection, but it does add some grip. This case comes in red, purple, or black.\nBuy one now from:\nAmazon\nHere are the 5 best deals HP is serving up for Cyber Monday Check out 20 of the best iPhone 7 cases and covers for your shiny new phone Best iPhone 7 Plus screen protectors to shield your big, beautiful display",

Photo: Reuters Tweet Published: 8:20 AM, November 29, 2016 \nSYDNEY - Australia's antitrust regulator said on Tuesday it was planning to deny some banks authorization to collectively bargain with Apple Inc <AAPL.O> in relation to its mobile digital payment system. \nThe Australian Competition and Consumer Commission said letting banks collectively offer their own integrated digital wallets in Apple iPhones, in competition with Apple's \"Apple Pay\" system, would reduce each individual bank's ability to negotiate with the U.S. technology giant. \n\"While the ACCC accepts that the opportunity for the banks to collectively negotiate and boycott would place them in a better bargaining position with Apple, the benefits are currently uncertain and may be limited,\" commission chairman Rod Sims said in a statement.

      "text": "Hear more from AT&T 's CEO, Randall Stephenson, at Business Insider's IGNITION: Future Of Digital this December in New York City . Tickets On Sale Now » \nAT&T CEO Randall Stephenson at the WSJD Live conference in Laguna Beach, California. Thomson Reuters \nAT&T is giving away free Apple TVs and Amazon Fire TV Sticks with its new streaming TV service, DirecTV Now. \nDirecTV's new service comes in several packages, starting at 60 channels for $35 per month, and going up to a $70 per month package with 120 channels, the company announced on Monday . \nCurrently, DirecTV is offering a 100 channel tier for $35 per month, although it said that offer is available for a limited time. \nMake no mistake: This is a monster giveaway. \nUsers who pay ahead of time for three months of DirecTV Now can receive the latest Apple TV for free, which retails for $149. \nAT&T will also give away an Amazon Fire TV Stick for free if customers pay for 1 month of DirecTV Now, AT&T said in a press release. \nDirecTV Now's least expensive package is only $35 a month, which means AT&T is asking for just a $105 commitment. An Apple TV alone costs $150 at retail. And if you don't want to commit to three months of DirecTV Now, you can sign up for one month ($35) and get a free Amazon Fire TV Stick. That would cost you about $40 at retail. Making waves \nAT&T \nAT&T made waves in the industry earlier this year when it announced that DirecTV Now would provide more than 100 channels for a mere $35 a month, undercutting many rivals on price. (Wall Street was expecting it to cost about $50 a month, according to analysts at Macquarie.) \nAT&T says it will be able to make the economics work at that price in part by cutting out legacy equipment like satellite dishes. DirecTV Now will be delivered over the internet, eliminating the need for cable or satellite but, to watch it on a TV, requiring a streaming box (like an Apple TV) or a smart TV. \nNot everyone, however, has a streaming box ready to go. With this promotion, it seems as if AT&T is trying to bridge the \"streaming gap\" for customers by simply giving them a free streaming box. The best channels \nDirecTV now will have a lot of commonly-requested channels. AT&T has already signed deals with HBO, Discovery, NBCUniversal, Turner, Viacom, Disney, AMC, Scripps, Starz, and more. So it seems as if all the big guns will be signed up for launch, except for CBS, which will not be included.. HBO will cost an additional $5 per month. \nThe company has not yet revealed which channels are in which packages. \nAnother major advantage to DirecTV Now is that it will have a \"72-hour catch-up window,\" according to Variety, which will let you watch shows on-demand for three days after they air. But there may be limitations on this feature — ESPN isn't on that catch-up list, for instance. DirecTV Now will also have an on-demand library of \"up to 14,000 titles,\" according to Variety. \nFor those who don't want to start paying before testing it out, DirecTV Now will let you have a seven-day free trial, AT&T said on Monday. The future is streaming \nAT&T has big plans for DirecTV Now and thinks it will be the company's primary TV platform by 2020 , according to Bloomberg. \nIn the immediate time period, a recent report from MoffettNathanson estimated that DirecTV Now could snag 11 million subscribers. \nHere's the potential breakdown: 2 million cannibalized from DirecTV, 6 million from other pay TV, and 3 million \"cord-cutters.\" \nThe 2 million subscribers transferred from DirecTV's traditional packages would be of concern to AT&T. Eleven million is a huge number, however, especially considering Sling TV is the market leader after only recently reaching 1 million subscribers, according to Bloomberg . \nIf you're ready to cut the cord, DirecTV is offering a 100 channel tier for $35 per month, although it said that offer is available for a limited time. But if you sign up now, you can have the deal grandfathered, the company said on Monday.",

More videos Banks, Apple in stoush over digital wallets \nA draft decision from the ACCC denies several of the big banks from negotiating as a bloc with Apple for access to its NFC technology. \nOn Tuesday, the ACCC proposed to deny the request, which the banks had claimed would benefit consumers by pressuring Apple to provide more open access to its near-field communications (NFC) hardware, which allows contactl​ess payments. \nUnlike Google, Apple allows apps to access the hardware on iPhones that makes tap and go payments only if they sign up to Apple Pay, which requires banks to surrender some of their credit card revenue. Related Content Macquarie fires up digital banking push \nBanks had claimed that if they launched a collective boycott of Apple, consumers would be the ultimate winners, because it might lead to greater choice of digital wallets. \nBut the regulator said such benefits were uncertain, while there was a downside to consumers from allowing the banks to team up. Advertisement \nApple does not allow any entity around the world to access the iPhone's NFC hardware in the way the banks want, and it has said it will not change its approach in Australia. \n\"This is currently a finely balanced decision. The ACCC is not currently satisfied that the likely benefits from the proposed conduct outweigh the likely detriments,\" ACCC chairman Rod Sims said. SHARE",

The battery usage list doesn’t give any reason for the battery’s shortened life.

My phone is lasting about 3 hours now. Instead of the battery shutting down at 70% it is now shutting down at 85%. I cannot tell you how many calls I have been bumped from. BTW, when it happens my phone is essentially dead for about 10 minutes before I can use it again.” Some users who have enrolled in Apple’s beta program have reported 10.1.1 (14B150) solves the battery draining issue, but others have said it doesn’t.

      "text": "ACCC rejects banks' Apple bargaining bid National Business Breaking News Business Date Print \nCommonwealth Bank, Westpac and National Australia Bank look to have failed to secure permission to collectively bargain with Apple to allow iPhone users to make mobile payments from their' own digital wallets, rather than Apple Pay. \nANZ is the only major Australian bank to sign up with the California-based tech giant which restricts contactless payments on Apple devices to its own Apple Pay platform. \nThe other three major banks - CBA, Westpac and NAB - along with Bendigo and Adelaide Bank want the competition watchdog's authorisation to bargain together with Apple, but the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission on Tuesday said it expects to deny their request. \nThe banks also want Apple to remove restrictions stopping them passing on Apple's fees. Advertisement \nACCC chairman Rod Sims says allowing the banks to bargain collectively could reduce or distort competition in a number of markets. \n\"Apple Wallet and other non-bank digital wallets could represent a disruptive technology that may increase competition between the banks by making it easier for consumers to switch between card providers and limiting any 'lock in' effect bank digital wallets may cause,\" Mr Sims said in a statement. \n\"Authorisation would allow the banks to agree to not sign up to Apple Pay for three years,\" Mr Sims said in the ACCC's draft determination, which will now be subject to further public consultation ahead of a final decision in March. \nThe ACCC also frowned upon any boycott of Apple by CBA, NAB, Westpac and Bendigo. \n\"This is a significant period of uncertainty and would result in decreased choice for consumers whose banks engage in this conduct.\"",

      "text": "1 Study Highlights a Bull Case for Apple Stock What if Apple's biggest product segment is doing better than you think? Daniel Sparks ( TMFDanielSparks ) Nov 28, 2016 at 8:02PM \nA quick look at Apple 's ( NASDAQ:AAPL ) recent business performance might lead some investors to conclude that Apple stock's low price-to-earnings ratio of just 13.5 is completely justified. After all, both revenue and EPS are down in the trailing 12 months. But some perspective highlighted by a recent Consumer Intelligence Research Partners (CIRP) study shows some reasons for investors to remain bullish on the stock. Image source: The Motley Fool. Consumers still love iPhone \nWith declining iPhone sales during Apple's fiscal 2016 dragging revenue and EPS lower, it might look like Apple products are falling out of popularity with consumers. But this isn't the case. Indeed, Apple has been seeing a high rate of customers switching from Android to iOS, and its newest iPhone is seeing exceptional adoption rates. \nThese trends are made particularly clear by CIRP's recent research (via 9to5Mac ). Consider these two important takeaways from CIRP's study. \n1. Android switchers: An impressive 18% of iPhone buyers in the first month of iPhone 7 availability are switching from Android, according to CIRP. While this is worse than a 26% Android switcher rate for the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus, it's still notable, especially considering it's up significantly from the 12% of iPhone buyers switching from Android during the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus launch two years ago. \nApple's own data on iPhone buyers switching from Android confirms the high level of Android switchers observed by CIRP. In Apple's most recent quarterly earnings call, CEO Tim Cook said the company saw more customers switch from Android to iPhone than ever before in 2016. \n2. High adoption: If the percentage of customers choosing Apple's September-launched iPhone 7 and 7 Plus over other iPhone models is any indication of how the new phone will fair in the marketplace in fiscal 2017, this could be a good year for the new phone. \n\"The combined share for the 7 and 7 Plus launch is up slightly from the 71% share for the iPhone 6S and 6S Plus in 2015,\" said CIRP partner and co-founder Josh Lowitz about the percentage of iPhone buyers buying the newest models during the first month of availability. \nWith Apple's android switchers and adoption rates still faring well with the company's latest iPhone, it's difficult to argue that the tech giant's devices are falling out of favor in the minds of consumers. Why Apple's iPhone is key \nApple's ability to attract Android switchers and compel iPhone buyers to upgrade to the company's newest iPhone are very important to an investing thesis in Apple stock for several reasons. iPhone 7. Image source: Apple. \nFirst, Apple's iPhone accounts for the majority of the company's revenue and profits. At about 60% of revenue and an even larger portion of operating profits, the closest product segment is Apple's services segment, which accounts for about 13.5% of revenue. The iPhone's popularity with consumers, therefore, is critical to Apple's success. \nSecond, in light of Apple's conservative price-to-earnings ratio of 13.5, a return to growth for Apple's iPhone business could make the stock's price today look like a bargain in retrospect. So, studies showing an optimistic market response to the latest iPhone help make a case for an outlook for the future Apple's most important product and, subsequently, the stock. \nInvestors should keep an eye on the rate of iPhone buyers switching from Android and purchasing the latest version. Fortunately, since Apple tends to provide commentary on these trends during earnings calls, investors should be able to get a quarterly update on how the iPhone business is resonating with customers. For now, though, the important product segment is certainly looking good enough to merit the stock's cheap valuation. \nDaniel Sparks owns shares of Apple.

      "text": "apple mac app store scammers cleaning report macbook inch touch pad More Bill Roberson/Digital Trends\nThe app stores provided by Microsoft, Google, and Apple are meant to be safe havens for consumers seeking out software for their devices. All three companies have safeguards in place to keep the malicious junk off their online markets, but the systems aren’t 100 percent foolproof, and sneaky developers find a way to slip inside and cause a little ruckus. Even more, apps may not be malicious in nature, but listed in such a way as to scam unsuspecting customers out of their hard-earned cash.\nApple’s “walled” storefronts for iOS and MacOS are seemingly impervious to malicious hackers, but How-To Geek took a look at what scammers are doing on the latter Mac App Store platform. The site discovered that scammers are not only making money from misleading listings, but Apple is getting its portion, too. Microsoft Excel is a perfect example, as there are a number of listed products that are seemingly the real deal, but instead are add-ons that require Microsoft Excel already installed.\nMore: Apple is looking at many options for the upcoming iPhone 8\nAs an example, one listing the report highlights is the Office Bundle for $30, which pulls up when searching for “Microsoft Excel” and described as “the easiest way to create high-quality Word documents, Excel spreadsheets, and PowerPoint presentations.” Following that description is a bullet list of general Microsoft Office features and a small message at the bottom stating that iOffice has nothing to do with Microsoft. The software is actually a template bundle, but its listing says nothing of the sort.\nAdding to the problem is that Microsoft Office Suite isn’t offered on the Mac App Store, and many consumers are likely not aware of this. Armed with this knowledge, scammers are throwing up similar template bundles disguised as Microsoft applications. There are even listed apps that charge $20 or more for providing Microsoft’s free online version of Office into a dedicated browser, and paid Office editors with “Microsoft” in their names based on open-source software.\nThe problem doesn’t reside with just Office-related clones. This method is used across a wide variety of well-known brands. Perform a search for Adobe’s popular InDesign publishing software and Mac users won’t find the actual tool, but bundles of tutorial videos with icons that closely resemble the official InDesign logo. Search for “Firefox” or “Chrome” and users will find suspicious software called “Fast Browser” for $1. The How-To Geek report even points to an uncanny amount of listed disk cleaners and memory cleaners Mac users simply don’t need.\nOverall, the point of the report is that scammers are mimicking official branding and literature to lure in unknowing customers to make some cash. Many are not listing the true nature of their apps, and are locking down search terms and figuring out a way to come out on top in search results to get the unsuspecting end-user’s attention first. Thus, based on the report, the Mac App Store should be Apple’s next project once it has completed the huge task of purging the outdated and broken apps from its App Store for iOS devices.\n2016 Macbook Pros becoming more versatile as Touch Bar receives more app support New to MacOS?

      "title": "Some iPhones experience reduced battery life following iOS 10.1.1 update",
      "text": "iphone battery life apple store More Adrianhancu/123RF\nIt looks like Apple is suffering through yet another botched iOS update. While iOS 10.1.1 promises to bring bug fixes and stability improvements, it seems it might bring another, much less welcome new feature — reduced battery life.\nA report from PCMag highlights the iPhone battery drain. There’s also an active discussion on the Apple support site, with some users saying that the iPhone 6 and iPhone 5S is now unable to last a day without a charge. Some even say that the iPhone is dying with 30 to 50 percent battery life still remaining.\nMore: T-Mobile is giving away free iPhone 7 storage upgrades for Cyber Monday\nThe iPhone has been suffering through a few battery issues of late — last week, Apple announced that it would be replacing a number of malfunctioning batteries in some iPhone 6S models free of charge, but the latest issues seem to pop up in more than just the iPhone 6S.\nSome people have also said that they’ve found a solution — turning off the Raise the Wake feature on some iPhone models seems to help. Not everyone, however, has been able to get their phones to work normally again.\nIt’s largely expected that Apple will release another update that serves as a patch to this issue. Apple rolled out iOS 10.1 on October 31, and it was replaced with iOS 10.1.1 on November 9, which was only available to those who hadn’t already updated. Currently, iOS 10.2 Beta 3 is also available to those who are part of Apple’s beta program.\nThis isn’t the first time Apple has released a buggy iOS update. For example when iOS 9 was first released, some users experienced the inability to use the “Slide to Upgrade” screen — in fact, once on the screen, the phone was totally unresponsive. On top of that, users were unable to connect to Wi-Fi, or found that Wi-Fi often disconnected.\nWhich smartphone OS wins 2016?

      "text": "An Apple iPhone 6 with Apple Pay is shown in this photo illustration in Encinitas, California, U.S. June 3, 2015. REUTERS/Mike Blake/File Photo More SYDNEY (Reuters) - Three of Australia's four biggest banks will be barred from collectively bargaining with Apple Inc in relation to its mobile digital payments system, under a draft decision released by the antitrust regulator on Tuesday.\nThe Australian Competition and Consumer Commission said letting banks collectively offer their own integrated digital wallets in Apple iPhones, in competition with Apple's Apple Pay system, would reduce each bank's ability to negotiate with the U.S. firm.\n\"While the ACCC accepts that the opportunity for the banks to collectively negotiate and boycott would place them in a better bargaining position with Apple, the benefits are currently uncertain and may be limited,\" commission chairman Rod Sims said in a statement.\nThe decision is a setback for the banks' hopes to bypass Apple's in-house payments system and roll out their own versions free of competition from the Silicon Valley giant, which has the biggest smartphone market share in Australia.\nIt also sets a precedent which may solidify Apple's dominance of the digital wallet system globally, since the Australian banks had mounted the first challenge to it.\nApple Pay allows users to register credit cards on devices such as iPhones, and pay for goods and services by swiping the devices over contactless payment terminals. Apple charges card providers for transactions via the service, which it introduced to Australia last year.\nCommonwealth Bank of Australia , Westpac Banking Corp , National Australia Bank Ltd and smaller Bendigo and Adelaide Bank Ltd , which jointly have two-thirds of the Australian credit card market, argued that letting Apple restrict use of mobile wallets was anti-competitive.\nApple argued that it had not granted access to its digital wallet technology to third-parties anywhere in the world because it would undermine customers' privacy and data security.\nA representative for the banks behind the application was not immediately available for comment.\nThe ACCC said it would consult further and give a final decision in March 2017.\nAustralia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd , Australia's fourth biggest bank by market capitalisation, has its own digital wallet agreement with Apple.\n(Reporting by Jamie Freed and Byron Kaye; Editing by Richard Pullin and Stephen Coates)",

      "text": "It looks like Apple will win this fight between Goliaths\nIn a case of financial giants versus technology giant, Australia's consumer watchdog released a draft decision Tuesday indicating it would deny a request from some of Australia's top banks to negotiate collectively with Apple over mobile payments.\nSEE ALSO: Apple's 'spaceship' campus looks like a futuristic, solar-powered fortress in new drone video\n\"While the ACCC accepts that the opportunity for the banks to collectively negotiate and boycott would place them in a better bargaining position with Apple, the benefits are currently uncertain and may be limited,\" ACCC Chairman Rod Sims said in a statement.\nThe saga started in July, when Commonwealth Bank, National Australia Bank and Westpac, along with Bendigo and Adelaide Bank, applied to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) arguing that Apple's strict control of its hardware undermined innovation and competition in the fintech space.\nCurrently, ANZ is the only bank out of Australia's \"big four\" to offer Apple Pay.\nThe fight centred on the iPhone's near-field communication (NFC) technology, which Apple generally prohibits access to for third-party apps. The hardware enables secure tap-and-go mobile payments.\nThe banks wanted to force Apple to open up NFC to their own banking apps, a proposal the technology giant protested vigorously.\nCalling the banks a \"cartel,\" Apple said in its own August submission to the ACCC that to do so would undermine security. \"Our hardware, software and services are built in a deeply integrated manner so we can provide the highest possible security,\" it wrote.\nThe ACCC did not fully accept Apple's security argument Tuesday, but noted the banks' ability to offer their own competing mobile payment apps with or without NFC access, and on the competing Android platform.\n\"There will be no competition against Apple for mobile payments on the iPhone.\"\nThe banks were also unhappy with the fees charged by Apple for use of its digital wallet. They wanted to negotiate the ability to pass that cost on to consumers.\n\"On balance,\" the ACCC found consumer interest would not be served by granting the banks' application, particularly given it could distort competition between the banks in supplying mobile wallets for iPhone.\nAlso noting that giving the banks the go-ahead would allow them not to sign up to Apple Pay for three years, \"the ACCC is not currently satisfied that the likely benefits from the proposed conduct outweigh the likely detriments,\" Sims said.\nA spokesperson for the banks said they were disappointed with the draft result.\n\"Our application is not just relevant to Australia — the same issues around consumer choice and the freedom to offer genuine competition against Apple Pay arise globally,\" he said in an emailed statement.\nThe ACCC will now receive further submissions on the issue before its final ruling.\nApple has been contacted by Mashable for comment.\nBONUS: We played around with the new MacBook Pro — and here are our 3 favorite features",

      "text": "Also today: A YouTube star makes the jump to CNN, and work can wait; check out our comprehensive Cyber Monday shopping guide. More Subscribe on YouTube\nPieces of Eight\nIt’s Monday, November 28th, and let’s hop right into the latest iPhone 8 new, or news/rumors. According to Business Insider , Apple has more than ten different iPhone 8 test mules on their workbenches. Why so many iPhone 8 prototypes? Well, 2017 marks the 10-year anniversary of the first iPhone, introduced by late Apple co-founder Steve Jobs back in 2007.\nAnd as the smartphone technology race continues to escalate, Apple is finding itself in the unusual position of also-ran as other companies push the pace of innovation with curved 4K screens, bigger batteries, higher-spec cameras and so on. Apple’s iPhone 7 and 7 plus are hot sellers, but more and more, it looks like the iPhone 8 will be a major revamp for the iconic device, with the top-tier phone possibly featuring a curved OLED screen.\nWhatever happens, 2017 will be an interesting year for the smartphone market, as Apple’s competitors will certainly try to one-up a company known to take tech to the next level. And that’s going to be fun for everyone.\nSuddenly, CNN gets a lot more interesting\nYouTube fixture Casey Neistat , that guy that’s always doing crazy stuff while rocking sunglasses and a t-shirt, has an odd new home for his video shenanigans and his social video app: CNN .\nThe app is called Beme (“beam”), and it’s basically a short video sharing app sort of like Vine and such. CNN has bought the app and brought crazy Casey into the fold, where he’ll be the new White House correspondent. OK, no, he won’t, but he will be in-house at CNN doing something that will hopefully bring the network some millennial eyeballs. As for Beam, it’s gotten a recent refresh so maybe check it out.\nDeals over here, deals over there, cyber deals everywhere\nLike we said, it’s Monday, but it’s that special Monday we love known as Cyber Monday, so if you didn’t melt your credit cards down to nothing on Black Friday, then today’s the day to snap up some of the deals you might have missed.\nWe’ve scoured the vast interwebs for the best deals on the hottest tech out there, so hit our buyers guide at this link here.\nT-Mobile’s Cyber Monday deal may be one of the best iPhone 7 promotions yet iPhone 7S and iPhone 8 rumors Get the best tech at the lowest prices with our favorite Cyber Monday deals",

      "text": "Apple's new iPads may ditch the home button and become almost bezel-less when they hit this upcoming spring , according to a recent report by Japanese Mac blog Macotakara .\nThe 9.7-inch iPad Pro is a cute little powerhouse tablet.\nPhoto by Sarah Tew/CNET Macotakara has previously reported Apple's plans to unveil three new iPads next year , a rumor supported by various other analysts as well ( here and here ). The general consensus among these groups is that the iPads will come in sizes ranging from a 9.7-inch model, a 12.9-inch model, and a 10.9-inch (or 10.5-inch ) model. The analysts also see a bezel-less future for the iPad, which seems to be all the rage among manufacturers .\nThe future iPads could mostly do away with the border, making the tablet all-screen except for a narrow strip supporting the front-facing FaceTime camera. That means the home button would be long gone.\nMacotakara's unnamed source also says that the new 10.9-inch model will be the same size as the current 9.7-inch iPad Pro , suggesting that you could get a little more screen for the size. The blog expects the 10.9-inch model to come in at 7.5mm tick, the same as the iPad Air or iPad Mini 2 . It also expects the new 12.9-inch model to be 7.2mm thick, which is a gain of 0.3mm from its current model -- possibly to store the battery an other components.\nThe reports expect new iPads to launch sometime next March, putting it ahead of the 10th anniversary iPhone unveiling -- assuming Apple sticks to its usual schedule. By introducing an iPad with a borderless screen and no home button early in the year, Apple could be testing waters for even bigger changes for the annual iPhone. But, of course, we'll have to wait until next year to find out.\nApple did not respond to a request for comment.\n ",

      "text": "By Tiernan Ray J.P. Morgan ’s Rod Hall , who is generally bullish on Apple ( AAPL ) stock, offers up a slightly unsettling prospect today, the notion margins may end up being lower for the “ iPhone 8 ,” which is what most people are expecting to come out next September, because of a higher cost to make the thing.\nHall offers up a research report from his colleague Narci Chang , who covers supply-chain firms such as Catcher Technology ( 2474TW ) of Taiwan.\nChang, without citing sources, writes that investors have thought the forthcoming iPhone might have a lower average selling price because it is expected to have an exterior that is “all glass,” in contrast to the current metal frame.\n“We think the market believes that the reduction in viewable metal area implies a lower ASP,” writes Chang.\nBut Chang describes how an all-glass design is likely to involve more expensive “machining” of the iPhone’s metal support frame under the glass:\nFor the 3.5” iPhone 4 glass sandwich casing, the stainless metal middle frame ASP was not low to begin with. The metal casing cost has risen for each generation since iPhone 5 (the only exception being the iPhone 5C plastic casing). Based on our latest forecasts that (1) 4” iPhone SE model may be phased out next year, (2) 5.5” LCD model and 5.8” OLED model may both adopt stainless middle frame, representing ~50% of total volume in 2H17 vs. only ~40% for the iPhone 7 Plus model this year and (3) the new metal middle-frame may carve out more metal to reduce the signal interference with wireless charging, leading to 20% increase in CNC machine hours, we think the ASP for the next iPhone metal casing will stay at similar level to iPhone 7/7 Plus on a like-for-like basis, but the “blended” ASP will rise as blended size becomes bigger. \nHall, without going into detail, concludes for his part that “there is growing evidence that Apple will be forced to take lower margins on next year’s phone – an idea that has been percolating since the use of supply constrained OLED displays was reported.",

      "title": "Apple: Black Friday, Cyber Monday Should Pay Off Well, Says Drexel",
      "text": "By Tiernan Ray Drexel Hamilton tech analyst Brian White today writes that Apple ( AAPL ) should be among the biggest beneficiaries of an upbeat buying environment for gadgets, citing data from the National Retail Federation and the Consumer Technology Association .\nThe frenzy continues today with the “ Cyber Monday ” shopping stunt.\nWhite, who has a Buy rating on Apple shares, and a $185 price target, notes that both organizations held conference calls yesterday to discuss the trends they determined in their respective surveys of holiday buy behavior.\n“Both the NRF and CTA calls were upbeat,” writes White, “highlighting trends that are consistent with both groups’ holiday sales expectations.”\n“We believe Apple remains one of the best positioned tech companies to benefit from spending trends this holiday season,” he continues, “with a well-received iPhone 7/7 Plus, new Apple Watches and a new MacBook Pro.”\nCTA said more people were spending on gadgets this year than last, and data from Adobe ( ADBE ), writes White, back up the notion lots of Apple products took part in the shopping orgy:\nDuring the CTA conference call, the group was also upbeat on trends during the Black Friday Week and this supports their prior forecast for total tech spending over the holiday season to increase by 3.1% (vs. up 1.4% in 2015). CTA’s 2016 Post Black Friday Survey describes this as a “record year for tech” with 61.7 million American adults that “have bought or plan to buy tech products over the course of the holiday shopping week” and up from the 56.9 million in 2015. • Among these 61.7 million American adults, CTA listed the top-ten most popular tech purchases during the Black Friday Week to include: 1) TVs; 2) tablets; 3) smartphones; 4) video game consoles; 5) tech accessories; 6) laptops; 7) headphones; 8) DVD or Blu-ray disc players; 9) portable Bluetooth speakers; and 10) digital toys. As expected, 4K UHD TVs sold well during the Black Friday Week. For emerging technology, CTA called out strength in digital assistant devices, virtual reality and drones. Moreover, Cyber Monday kicks off today and CTA estimates 49.4 million U.S. adults (20%) will shop today, a new record. • Over the weekend, Adobe announced an estimated $5.27 billion was spent online during Black Friday ($3.34 billion) and Thanksgiving Day ($1.93 billion) and up 17.7% YoY. The top-five selling electronics products on Black Friday included Apple iPads, Samsung 4K TVs, Apple MacBook Air, LG TVs and Microsoft Xbox. \nApple shares today are down 4 cents at $111.75.\nSee also: Amazon, et al.

      "text": "By Tiernan Ray Here are some things going on today in your world of tech :\nToday, of course, is Cyber Monday , the U.S. shopping orgy that follows Black Friday , and some Street folks are trying to gauge what it means for the electronics world.\nThe National Retail Federation says shoppers spent $289.19 per person, on average, over the four-day Black Friday weekend — down 3.5% from the prior-year period, with a 4.2% increase in the number of online consumers, versus a 3.7% drop in bricks-and-mortar shoppers.\nNeil Doshi with Mizuho put out at note to clients arguing that Amazon ( AMZN ), eBay ( EBAY ), and Alphabet ’s ( GOOGL ) Google “ should benefit from the strong start in eCommerce sales from Thanksgiving,” given that “Thanksgiving and Black Friday eCommerce sales appear flat-to-up YoY.”\n“We were expecting some deceleration so this was a positive surprise to us.”\nAmazon shares are down $12.72, or 1.6%, at $767.65.\nAnd Piper Jaffray ’s Gene Munster , who has an Overweight rating on Amazon shares, writes that according to data from Adobe ( ADBE ), sales on Thanksgiving and Black Friday rose by 18%, year over year, to $5.27 billion, and that he thinks “that Amazon is likely outstripping other online retailers due to the growth in Prime membership, Prime-only deals, the rollout of Prime Now (free 2-hour delivery), discounting on items ordered through Amazon Echo … and generally speaking the best eCommerce experience offered online.”\nInstinet ’s Romit Shah reiterates a Buy rating on shares of Intel ( INTC ), writing that the company is on track to spending much more of its money saved from restructuring, so investors “should be asking the company, ‘Which projects is Intel investing in that it didn’t contemplate in April? And why?’”\nHe offers some possibilities, among which are that Intel is stepping up spending to support Apple ( AAPL ), perhaps if the latter wants to build iPhone s in the U.S. at some point, as recently rumored to be a possibility.\nIntel shares are up 6 cents at $35.50.\nShares of IT services firm Cognizant Technology Solutions ( CTSH ) are up $4.51, or almost 9%, at $57.76, after activist fund Elliott Management this morning published a letter it sent to the company’s board, calling for the company to undertake a $2.5 billion accelerated share repurchase program, to be completed in the first half of fiscal ’17, and to implement a 1.5% dividend.\nShares of fiber optics component vendor Finisar ( FNSR ) are $1.23, or 3.6%, at $33.99, after Needham & Co .’s Alex Henderson this morning raised his rating on the shares to Strong Buy from Buy, and raised his price target to $42 from $38, writing that the company’s earnings report on December 8th, after market close, should be a “strong beat and raise,” given “sharply ramping 100G,” or 100-gigabit-per-second, networking components.\nFor Ciena, whose shares Henderson rates a Buy, with a $30 target, he’s a little concerned about the company’s October quarter, given what he thinks is “spending tightness at AT&T ( T )” and also AT&T’s preoccupation with trying to buy Time Warner ( TWX ).\nThe Wall Street Journal ’s Juro Osawa and Ryan Knutson report on the obstacles facing China’s privately held Huawei in trying to get its recently introduced flagship phone, the “ Mate 9 ” into U.S. distribution, with carriers reluctant to work with the company “because of its low brand recognition and security concerns associated with its networking equipment.”",

      "text": "ZDNet Japan ACCC moves to deny Australian banks collective bargaining rights against Apple The Australian regulator has issued a draft proposal to deny authorisation for banks to collectively bargain with and boycott Apple Pay. | Topic: Banking \nAn Australian banking consortium may lose its fight to collectively bargain with Apple and boycott Apple Pay, with the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) issuing a draft determination proposing to deny authorisation on Tuesday. \nThe Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA), Westpac Banking Corporation, the National Australia Bank (NAB), and Bendigo and Adelaide Bank have been seeking regulatory approval to collectively negotiate with third-party mobile providers such as Apple on conditions relating to competition, best practice standards, and efficiency. \nThe banks want access to the near-field communication (NFC) controller in iPhones, as Apple currently does not allow any entity direct access. The group has been arguing that access would enable the banks to offer their own integrated digital wallets to iPhone customers in competition with Apple's digital wallet without using Apple Pay -- which is what Apple wants to avoid. Latest Australian news NBN AU$19.5b loan will improve Budget position: Communications Department \nAdditionally, the banks want the removal of the restrictions Apple imposes on banks that prevent them from passing on fees that Apple charges the banks for use of its digital wallet. \nCore to the banks' argument is that the public will benefit if Apple is forced to hand over its NFC hardware, highlighting it would increase competition and consumer choice in digital wallets in Australia, increase innovation and investment in digital wallets and other mobile applications using NFC technology, provide greater consumer confidence leading to increased adoption of mobile payment technology in Australia, and provide cost-based benefits for consumers. \n\"This is currently a finely balanced decision. The ACCC is not currently satisfied that the likely benefits from the proposed conduct outweigh the likely detriments,\" ACCC chairman Rod Sims said in a statement. \n\"While the ACCC accepts that the opportunity for the banks to collectively negotiate and boycott would place them in a better bargaining position with Apple, the benefits are currently uncertain and may be limited.\" \nThe four banks initially requested interim authorisation within 28 days of their initial request on July 27 for the ACCC to allow them to commence collective negotiations while the regulator considered the application for final authorisation. \nThe ACCC refused to grant the banks interim authorisation to collectively negotiate on the basis it needed more time to come to a decision. \nGiven the infancy of digital wallets and mobile payments, Sims said on Tuesday he is concerned with how competition may develop with possible future innovations and that the proposed conduct could reduce or distort competition in a number of markets. \nIn its first submission, Apple accused the banks of wanting to control the market , saying that collective negotiation with the banks \"would harm consumers, lead to less competition and less innovation, and create a troubling precedent\". \n\"The present application is only the latest tactic employed by these competing banks to blunt Apple's entry into the Australian market,\" it said. \nApple also accused the banks of having a \"limited understanding\" of Apple Pay. \nIn August, Apple claimed that collectively negotiating with Australian banks would \" undermine the availability, security, and privacy \" its customers expect when using Apple devices to make payments. \n\"If granted, the authorisation would harm consumers, lessen competition, and reduce innovation in the banking sector, of which the payments system is a core part. It would also create a troubling precedent. Apple expects that banks and third-party mobile wallet providers will continue innovating and developing new and better solutions,\" Apple wrote in its submission. \nThe banks then argued in its joint submission to the ACCC that Apple's arguments against collective negotiation are \"unconvincing\" and \"superficial\" . \nThe regulator also said in its draft proposal to deny authorisation on Tuesday it believes collective bargaining rights would reduce the competitive tension between the banks individually negotiating with Apple, which could reduce competition between the banks in the supply of mobile payment services for iPhones. \n\"Apple Wallet and other non-bank digital wallets could represent a disruptive technology that may increase competition between the banks by making it easier for consumers to switch between card providers and limiting any 'lock in' effect bank digital wallets may cause,\" Sims said. \nThe ACCC also said it considers the conduct could also distort competition between mobile operating systems.

      "text": "Australian regulator opposes collective bank bargaining on Apple Pay Reuters By Jamie Freed and Byron Kaye Photo: \nBy Jamie Freed and Byron Kaye \nSYDNEY (Reuters) - Three of Australia's four biggest banks will be barred from collectively bargaining with Apple Inc <AAPL.O> over its mobile digital payments system, under a draft decision released by the antitrust regulator on Tuesday. \nAllowing banks to collectively offer their own digital wallets in Apple iPhones, in competition with Apple's Apple Pay system, would reduce each bank's ability to negotiate with the U.S. firm, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) said. \nThe decision is a setback for the banks' hopes to bypass Apple's in-house payments system and roll out their own versions free of competition from the Silicon Valley giant, which has the biggest smartphone market share in Australia. \nIt also sets a precedent which may solidify Apple's dominance of the digital wallet system globally, since the Australian banks had mounted the first challenge to it. \n\"While the ACCC accepts that the opportunity for the banks to collectively negotiate and boycott would place them in a better bargaining position with Apple, the benefits are currently uncertain and may be limited,\" commission Chairman Rod Sims said in a statement. \nApple Pay could fuel competition by making it easier for customers to switch between card providers and limiting the \"lock-in\" effect of separate bank digital wallets, he added. \nApple Pay allows users to register credit cards on devices such as iPhones, and pay for goods and services by swiping the devices over contactless payment terminals. Apple charges card providers for transactions via the service, which it introduced to Australia last year. \nCommonwealth Bank of Australia <CBA.AX>, Westpac Banking Corp <WBC.AX>, National Australia Bank Ltd <NAB.AX> and smaller Bendigo and Adelaide Bank Ltd <BEN.AX>, which jointly have two-thirds of the Australian credit card market, argued that letting Apple restrict use of mobile wallets was anti-competitive. \nApple has argued that third-parties should not have access to its digital wallet technology because it would undermine customers' privacy and data security. The company's representatives did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Tuesday. \nA representative for the banks behind the application, Lance Blockley, said there would be effectively no competition against Apple for mobile payments on the iPhone if the draft determination stood. The banks would continue to argue their case with the ACCC, he said. \nThe ACCC said it would consult further and give a final decision in March. \nAustralia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd <ANZ.AX>, Australia's third-biggest bank by market capitalization, is the only one of Australia's \"Big Four\" banks to have a digital wallet agreement with Apple. \n(Reporting by Jamie Freed and Byron Kaye; Editing by Stephen Coates) Related Links",

      "text": "Home Technology Apple Watch Discounts End As Cyber Monday Kicks Off More Sales Apple Watch Discounts End As Cyber Monday Kicks Off More Sales Like \nThere are a lot of deals going on for the Apple Watch as the company tries to sell it for $198 during its Black Friday deals. But there is a catch. \nWell, it’s Black Friday 2016 and the new Apple Watch is on sale for $198 at Target, falling below the $200 price point for the first time during the holiday season. \nEvery other day but Black Friday weekend, this iWatch normally sells for $270. That’s a $72 discount on the refreshed Apple Watch. \nNow, it’s not the Apple Watch 2, but it’s also not the Apple Watch 1. This is the newer Apple Watch Series 1 that comes with the Apple Watch 2 dual-core processor. \nThat means it’s just as fast as the Apple Watch 2 at $369, which doesn’t have a Black Friday deal anywhere we have seen. It’s our recommended Apple Watch for most people. You’re just missing out on GPS and waterproofing, so unless your a running or a swimmer, this shouldn’t matter very much. \nNot surprisingly, this is a limited-time Black Friday deal, as it expires at the end of the day on Saturday, as soon as Cyber Sunday begins. \nThere’s no telling if Target or any other US retailer will keep the Apple Watch on sale through Cyber Monday. It may come as another deal, or go back to full price, but include a gift card bonus. \nYour best bet is to order the new Apple Watch Series 1 right now, see if the deal gets sweeter (which it likely won’t, according to Black Friday deal history) and either keep, cancel or return your new Apple Watch. That way, you’re sure to get the best Apple Watch price no matter what.",

But some perspective highlighted by a recent Consumer Intelligence Research Partners (CIRP) study shows some reasons for investors to remain bullish on the stock.\n\nImage source: The Motley Fool.\nContinue reading ",

      "text": "New Footage Provides Another Look at Apple's Spaceship Campus New Footage Provides Another Look at Apple's Spaceship Campus 10 Comments Apple CEO Tim Cook previously boasted that the massive structure will be the greenest building on the planet. \nNew aerial video captured by a drone reveals a giant spaceship nearing completion at Apple's headquarters in Cupertino, Calif. \nUnlike the space ambitions of other private companies , Apple's design won't actually fly. Instead, it's a massive office complex dreamed up by the company's former CEO Steve Jobs, and it has been under construction since 2013. \nThe new drone footage, uploaded to YouTube by Sexton Photography on Nov. 25, reveals details of the nearly finished buildings, including several open atriums as well as an underground garage and auditorium. As you'd expect for a Silicon Valley headquarters, there's also a massive employee fitness center separate from the main building. \nThe shape and exterior finishes of the main building — a perfect circle — are reminiscent of both the Death Star from Star Wars and the Pentagon. Apple has previously shared details of its spaceship campus, which will accommodate up to 14,000 employees. So other than offering a clear view of the nearly finished construction, the Sexton footage doesn't reveal any big surprises. // Related Articles Apple Spaceship Campus: Greenest Building on the Planet? \nWhile the spaceship's architecture may be intimidating, the footage shows that Apple is making at least some efforts to tread lightly on nature, like solar panels that cover nearly the entire roof and few roads or other paved surfaces. But hiding the parking garage underground doesn't change the fact that many Apple employees will still find it easier to arrive at the massive suburban campus by driving on the Bay Area's congested roads and highways instead of using public transportation. \nApple CEO Tim Cook talked up the new campus's environmentally friendly features in 2014, including a plan to offer various transportation options. \n\"We're building a new facility that I think will be the greenest building on the planet,\" he said.",

      "title": "Is your iPhone charger a fire hazard?",
      "text": "Apple says 'counterfeit' chargers can cause fires , , John Matarese 7:26 PM, Nov 28, 2016 39 mins ago Apple says some fake chargers have major design flaws that can cause overheating and fires. KNXV ABC15 Copyright 2016 Scripps   Show Caption Previous Next \nIt's one of the first things we do in the morning--pull the cell phone off the charger. \nWell if yours is a knock off, it could be a fire hazard. \nKatie Skerchock found that out first hand when she unplugged her phone from its charger and says she heard an explosion. \n\"I stopped a second, and I look down and see the sparks,\" she says. \nShe says a metallic covering over her USB cord shorted out. \nIn a recent lawsuit posted by tech blog patentlyapple.com , Apple claims that it purchased and tested more than \"100 iPhone devices, apple power products, and lightning cables sold as genuine by sellers on Amazon.com.\" \nThe company says 90 percent were fakes with design flaws that create \"..risks of overheating, fire, and electrical shock.\" \nSo how can you tell if your charger is really Apple certified? \nThe company says for products made by a third party, the proof is in the packaging. \nApple certified accessories always have the \"made for\" or \"MFi logo\" on the packaging. \nGenuine Apple lightning USB cables will show the words \"Designed by Apple in California\", and either \"Assembled in China,\" \"Assembled in Vietnam,\" or \"Indústria Brasileira\" \nThat information will be followed by a 12-digit serial number. \nNeed my help? \nCall volunteers with the Assistance League of Phoenix at 855-323-1515, email me at or contact me on Facebook or Twitter .

      "text": "Search for: For Apple and others, tin supply chain has ties to rebel-held Myanmar mine A tin mine is seen in Man Maw in ethnic Wa territory in northeast Myanmar, October 5, 2016. REUTERS/Soe Zeya Tun/File Photo \nNovember 29, 2016 \nBy Yimou Lee and Joel Schectman \nYANGON/WASHINGTON (Reuters) – From a remote corner of northeastern Myanmar, an insurgent army sells tin ore to suppliers of some of the world’s largest consumer companies. \nMore than 500 companies, including leading brands such as smartphone maker Apple, coffee giant Starbucks and luxury jeweler Tiffany & Co, list among their suppliers Chinese-controlled firms that indirectly buy ore from the Man Maw mine near Myanmar’s border with China, a Reuters examination of the supply chain found. \nThe mine is controlled by the United Wa State Army (UWSA), which the United States placed under sanctions for alleged narcotics trafficking in 2003. The seven companies extracting tin from the mine are all owned or controlled by Wa military and government leaders, Wa officials and people with close ties to UWSA leadership told Reuters. \nThis potentially puts companies, which also include industrial conglomerate General Electric, at risk of violating sanctions that forbid “direct or indirect” dealings with blacklisted groups, according to a former and a serving U.S. official and lawyers with expertise in sanctions enforcement. \nSeveral sanctions experts said the U.S. government was unlikely to fine companies who unwittingly used the Myanmar tin. Still, it may force them to shift to new suppliers, they said. \nA Treasury Department spokeswoman said U.S. sanctions “generally prohibit U.S. companies from engaging in any direct or indirect transactions or dealings with individuals or entities” on a blacklist, but declined further comment on specific circumstances. \nThe situation illustrates the difficulties facing multinationals in monitoring supply chains that have grown increasingly complex. \nFollowing a 2012 U.S. regulation, companies have spent billions of dollars scrutinizing whether certain minerals used in their products come from mines controlled by armed groups in Central Africa. \nBut the regulations do not require them to assess the origins of minerals from other conflict zones. \nApple, Tiffany and GE, and other companies contacted by Reuters, said that to fulfill those regulations they looked to an audit program designed by the industry group Conflict Free Sourcing Initiative (CFSI). \nA CFSI program director said the group was “aware of tin exports from Myanmar to other countries and of security and human rights issues in Myanmar”. The group said it was updating its audit requirements to include “a broader definition of conflict-affected and high-risk areas”. \nTin supply chain expert at monitoring group Global Witness, Sophia Pickles, said companies must not wholly outsource due diligence responsibility to a scheme that has exclusively focused on central Africa. \n“Companies, not schemes, bear the primary responsibility for ensuring that supply chains are responsible,” she said. \nCIVIL WAR \nMost of the tin mined globally is used as solder in electronics, for making batteries and plating. \nThe Man Maw mine roiled the global tin market when huge quantities of high grade ore were discovered around 2013. Annual production is now estimated at about 33,000 tons of tin concentrate, more than a 10th of global output of the metal. \nThe mine is controlled by the UWSA, the strongest of the myriad armed groups that have kept Myanmar in a state of near-perpetual civil war for decades. Reuters visited the remote mine last month, the first international media organization to do so. \nInterviews with officials running the mine, UWSA leaders and executives at Asian tin suppliers, together with an examination of public disclosures of suppliers made by companies in regulatory filings, indicate Wa tin likely ends up in an array of products made by U.S. and other international companies. \nTin from Man Maw provides revenue critical to the survival of the self-proclaimed Wa State and its rulers, who have refused to disarm or participate in Myanmar’s peace process. “There are dozens of trucks carrying tin ore to China every morning,” the head of the Wa territory foreign affairs office, Zhao Guo An, told Reuters. “Tin mining is the pillar of our economy. It’s the biggest source of income.” \nWhile Washington has lifted most sanctions on Myanmar, some have been kept in place, including those aimed at the UWSA. The group and several of its leaders are blacklisted under the Kingpin Act over accusations of trafficking in heroin and methamphetamine. UWSA leaders deny involvement in narcotics, saying the accusations are a smear by political opponents. \nPeter Kucik, a former senior sanctions advisor at the U.S. Treasury Department, said the findings highlighted the need for thorough due diligence. \n“The facts suggest potential sanctions risk for the parties involved,” Kucik said. \nTwo companies in Apple’s supply chain, the world’s No. 1 tin producer Yunnan Tin Co Ltd and leading Taiwan-based solder maker Shenmao Technology, told Reuters that some tin they bought was from the Wa mine. \nMandy Gan, a tin analyst from China’s leading mineral research company, Asian Metal, and another tin expert, both of whom visited the UWSA mine this year, said many other Chinese smelting firms supplying global consumer goods makers also bought tin from the Man Maw mine. \nSanctions experts said even the indirect use of the tin might be considered a violation of U.S. sanctions law, which does not require authorities to prove intent. A U.S. government official involved in Myanmar policy consulted on Reuters’ findings said the government was likely to investigate any ties to the UWSA. \nStill, Washington-based sanctions attorney Erich Ferrari said it was unlikely the Treasury Department would initiate an enforcement action against companies for an issue so deep in the supply chain. Once the ties were publicized, however, authorities could impose penalties if the companies did not wind down the transactions and find new suppliers, he said. \nSUPPLY CHAIN \nThe chain connecting some of the world’s best known brands with a mine in one the most inaccessible corners of Southeast Asia has many links. ((For a GRAPHIC, click on: http://tmsnrt.rs/2giJmcq)) \nOne key intermediary is state-owned Yunnan Cultural Industry International (YCII), based in Yunnan, southwestern China, which said in a statement on its website that it enjoys “a long-term, stable strategic partnership” with the UWSA statelet. \nYCII declined several interview requests. \nYCII is, in turn, a major supplier of tin to the world’s top producer, Yunnan Tin, also based in Yunnan. \nYunnan Tin supplies many companies, including big contract manufacturers such as Foxconn Technology Co and, indirectly, Pegatron Corp, whose clients include Apple. It also supplies major solder makers such as Shenmao Technology, also a supplier to Pegatron. \n“Myanmar is not considered a conflict-affected area by CFSI…As long as smelters present a certified sourcing document, that’s acceptable for us,” said Tim Lin, an executive overseeing sourcing at Taiwan-based Shenmao, who said about a quarter of its supply of the metal came from Yunnan Tin. \nIn the last two years, Yunnan Tin has also shipped more than 12,000 tons of metal to the United States, according to shipment data from U.S.-based trade tracking company Panjiva. \nMore than 500 publicly traded companies in the United States say their suppliers use tin from Yunnan Tin or Yuntinic Resources, its San Mateo, California-based division, according to a review of the supply chain disclosures consumer companies make to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. \nTwo members of Yunnan Tin’s board, vice chairwoman Yang Yimin and secretary and vice general manager Pan Wenhao, confirmed in interviews that a “portion” of the company’s tin came from the UWSA-operated mine. “We certainly buy tin indirectly from Myanmar,” Pan told Reuters. “We don’t specifically pay attention to where they source their materials from.” \nYunnan Tin mixes the Wa tin with metal from mines in central and southwestern China, said Pan, before processing it into products such as tin paste. \nThat means it is impossible to say for certain which shipments from the company contain Wa tin, but Pan estimated Yunnan Tin’s purchases from the mine account for about a third of its total annual tin consumption, or at least 16,500 tons. \nApple said in a statement it worked with suppliers to help them meet stringent standards, “and those who are ultimately unable or unwilling to comply are removed from our supply chain”. \n“While we have no evidence of illegal tin from Myanmar in our products, we’ll continue to investigate, address any issues we find and do all we can to raise standards and protect human rights,” it said. Foxconn said it “enforced stringent supplier management requirements in accordance with international and local conflict minerals legislation and has proactively communicated these requirements to our suppliers”. \nIt added that less than 1 percent of its tin was procured from Yunnan Tin, all of which was used in products for a “single, non-U.S.-based customer”. Pegatron Corp said it carried out “annual due diligence on suppliers and encourage them to source from validated conflict-free supply chains”. \n“Pegatron will continue working with customers and international organizations to investigate and source minerals responsibly,” the company added. FROM JEWELLERY TO APPLIANCES \nCompanies that sell consumer products in the United States are required by the Dodd-Frank Act to publish their suppliers of tin and other minerals. \nAmong the companies listing Yunnan Tin, Tiffany said one of its suppliers had indirectly sourced a “very small amount of tin” from the Chinese smelter for use in silver solder for jewelry and hollowware. \nThe company added that, as Yunnan Tin was certified as conflict-free by the CFSI, “use of this smelter by our vendors is consistent with our Conflict Minerals Policy”. \nStarbucks said small amounts of Yunnan Tin metal, sourced from second or third party suppliers, went into the ovens in its coffee shops. The company had received no information indicating it was using minerals from Myanmar, a spokeswoman said, but was pushing suppliers for more detailed sourcing disclosures. A GE spokesman said the company strived to use ethical sourcing in its mineral supply chain, adding it had “noted the concerns raised by Reuters and will address them through our internal process and with our external partners”. A spokeswoman from discount retailer Target said in a statement it was “committed to responsible business conduct”. “We take these allegations very seriously, and we are looking into this,” the statement said. \n(Additional reporting by Antoni Slodkowski in Yangon, JR Wu in Taipei, Jussi Rosendahl in Helsinki and Helena Soderpalm in Stockholm, Paul Carsten in Beijing and Sijia Zhang in Hong Kong; Editing by Alex Richardson)",

      "text": "Bankruptcy News | Mon Nov 28, 2016 | 10:26pm EST Former regulatory official seeks to take over TransAsia - Apple newspaper \nTAIPEI Nov 29 A group led by a former Taiwanese aviation regulatory official is seeking to take over TransAsia Airways Corp which last week said it would wind down operations, local newspaper Apple said in its online edition. \nFailing to recover from two plane crashes in almost three years, Taiwan's third-largest carrier said it had no choice but to seek to dissolve the company and would suspend all scheduled flights. \nChang Kuo-cheng, a former head of the island's Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA), told the Apple daily that his team would be interested in helping TransAsia through this difficult time - comments that come just hours before the government is due to rescind the carrier's right to operate flights. \nChang could not be reached for comment. Representatives for TransAsia and the CAA were not immediately available for comment. \n(Reporting by Faith Hung; Editing by Edwina Gibbs) Next In Bankruptcy News",

      "text": "mine@\n* United Wa State Army blacklisted by U.S. over drug trafficking\n* Mine run by armed group in \"Wa State\" is a major producer of tin\n* Top smelter Yunnan Tin indirectly buys big quantities of Wa tin\n* Many international companies list Yunnan Tin as a supplier\n* Sourcing tin from mine puts firms at risk of sanctions breach\n(Updates with new headline)\nYANGON/WASHINGTON, Nov 29 (Reuters) - From a remote corner of northeastern Myanmar, an insurgent army sells tin ore to suppliers of some of the world's largest consumer companies.\nMore than 500 companies, including leading brands such as smartphone maker Apple, coffee giant Starbucks and luxury jeweler Tiffany & Co, list among their suppliers Chinese-controlled firms that indirectly buy ore from the Man Maw mine near Myanmar's border with China, a Reuters examination of the supply chain found.\nThe mine is controlled by the United Wa State Army (UWSA), which the United States placed under sanctions for alleged narcotics trafficking in 2003. The seven companies extracting tin from the mine are all owned or controlled by Wa military and government leaders, Wa officials and people with close ties to UWSA leadership told Reuters.\nThis potentially puts companies, which also include industrial conglomerate General Electric, at risk of violating sanctions that forbid \"direct or indirect\" dealings with blacklisted groups, according to a former and a serving U.S. official and lawyers with expertise in sanctions enforcement.\nSeveral sanctions experts said the U.S. government was unlikely to fine companies who unwittingly used the Myanmar tin. Still, it may force them to shift to new suppliers, they said.\nA Treasury Department spokeswoman said U.S. sanctions \"generally prohibit U.S. companies from engaging in any direct or indirect transactions or dealings with individuals or entities\" on a blacklist, but declined further comment on specific circumstances.\nThe situation illustrates the difficulties facing multinationals in monitoring supply chains that have grown increasingly complex.\nFollowing a 2012 U.S. regulation, companies have spent billions of dollars scrutinizing whether certain minerals used in their products come from mines controlled by armed groups in Central Africa.\nBut the regulations do not require them to assess the origins of minerals from other conflict zones.\nApple, Tiffany and GE, and other companies contacted by Reuters, said that to fulfill those regulations they looked to an audit program designed by the industry group Conflict Free Sourcing Initiative (CFSI).\nA CFSI program director said the group was \"aware of tin exports from Myanmar to other countries and of security and human rights issues in Myanmar.\" The group said it was updating its audit requirements to include \"a broader definition of conflict-affected and high-risk areas.\"\nTin supply chain expert at monitoring group Global Witness, Sophia Pickles, said companies must not wholly outsource due diligence responsibility to a scheme that has exclusively focused on central Africa.\n\"Companies, not schemes, bear the primary responsibility for ensuring that supply chains are responsible,\" she said.\nCIVIL WAR\nMost of the tin mined globally is used as solder in electronics, for making batteries and plating.\nThe Man Maw mine roiled the global tin market when huge quantities of high grade ore were discovered around 2013. Annual production is now estimated at about 33,000 tons of tin concentrate, more than a 10th of global output of the metal.\nThe mine is controlled by the UWSA, the strongest of the myriad armed groups that have kept Myanmar in a state of near-perpetual civil war for decades. Reuters visited the remote mine last month, the first international media organization to do so.\nInterviews with officials running the mine, UWSA leaders and executives at Asian tin suppliers, together with an examination of public disclosures of suppliers made by companies in regulatory filings, indicate Wa tin likely ends up in an array of products made by U.S. and other international companies.\nTin from Man Maw provides revenue critical to the survival of the self-proclaimed Wa State and its rulers, who have refused to disarm or participate in Myanmar's peace process.\n\"There are dozens of trucks carrying tin ore to China every morning,\" the head of the Wa territory foreign affairs office, Zhao Guo An, told Reuters. \"Tin mining is the pillar of our economy. It's the biggest source of income.\"\nWhile Washington has lifted most sanctions on Myanmar, some have been kept in place, including those aimed at the UWSA. The group and several of its leaders are blacklisted under the Kingpin Act over accusations of trafficking in heroin and methamphetamine. UWSA leaders deny involvement in narcotics, saying the accusations are a smear by political opponents.\nPeter Kucik, a former senior sanctions advisor at the U.S. Treasury Department, said the findings highlighted the need for thorough due diligence.\n\"The facts suggest potential sanctions risk for the parties involved,\" Kucik said.\nTwo companies in Apple's supply chain, the world's No. 1 tin producer Yunnan Tin Co Ltd and leading Taiwan-based solder maker Shenmao Technology, told Reuters that some tin they bought was from the Wa mine.\nMandy Gan, a tin analyst from China's leading mineral research company, Asian Metal, and another tin expert, both of whom visited the UWSA mine this year, said many other Chinese smelting firms supplying global consumer goods makers also bought tin from the Man Maw mine.\nSanctions experts said even the indirect use of the tin might be considered a violation of U.S. sanctions law, which does not require authorities to prove intent. A U.S. government official involved in Myanmar policy consulted on Reuters' findings said the government was likely to investigate any ties to the UWSA.\nStill, Washington-based sanctions attorney Erich Ferrari said it was unlikely the Treasury Department would initiate an enforcement action against companies for an issue so deep in the supply chain. Once the ties were publicized, however, authorities could impose penalties if the companies did not wind down the transactions and find new suppliers, he said.\nSUPPLY CHAIN\nThe chain connecting some of the world's best known brands with a mine in one the most inaccessible corners of Southeast Asia has many links.\nOne key intermediary is state-owned Yunnan Cultural Industry International (YCII), based in Yunnan, southwestern China, which said in a statement on its website that it enjoys \"a long-term, stable strategic partnership\" with the UWSA statelet.\nYCII declined several interview requests.\nYCII is, in turn, a major supplier of tin to the world's top producer, Yunnan Tin, also based in Yunnan.\nYunnan Tin supplies many companies, including big contract manufacturers such as Foxconn Technology Co and, indirectly, Pegatron Corp, whose clients include Apple. It also supplies major solder makers such as Shenmao Technology, also a supplier to Pegatron.\n\"Myanmar is not considered a conflict-affected area by CFSI...As long as smelters present a certified sourcing document, that's acceptable for us,\" said Tim Lin, an executive overseeing sourcing at Taiwan-based Shenmao, who said about a quarter of its supply of the metal came from Yunnan Tin.\nIn the last two years, Yunnan Tin has also shipped more than 12,000 tons of metal to the United States, according to shipment data from U.S.-based trade tracking company Panjiva.\nMore than 500 publicly traded companies in the United States say their suppliers use tin from Yunnan Tin or Yuntinic Resources, its San Mateo, California-based division, according to a review of the supply chain disclosures consumer companies make to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.\nTwo members of Yunnan Tin's board, vice chairwoman Yang Yimin and secretary and vice general manager Pan Wenhao, confirmed in interviews that a \"portion\" of the company's tin came from the UWSA-operated mine.\n\"We certainly buy tin indirectly from Myanmar,\" Pan told Reuters. \"We don't specifically pay attention to where they source their materials from.\"\nYunnan Tin mixes the Wa tin with metal from mines in central and southwestern China, said Pan, before processing it into products such as tin paste.\nThat means it is impossible to say for certain which shipments from the company contain Wa tin, but Pan estimated Yunnan Tin's purchases from the mine account for about a third of its total annual tin consumption, or at least 16,500 tons.\nApple said in a statement it worked with suppliers to help them meet stringent standards, \"and those who are ultimately unable or unwilling to comply are removed from our supply chain.\"\n\"While we have no evidence of illegal tin from Myanmar in our products, we'll continue to investigate, address any issues we find and do all we can to raise standards and protect human rights,\" it said.\nFoxconn said it \"enforced stringent supplier management requirements in accordance with international and local conflict minerals legislation and has proactively communicated these requirements to our suppliers.\"\nIt added that less than 1 percent of its tin was procured from Yunnan Tin, all of which was used in products for a \"single, non-U.S.-based customer.\"\nPegatron Corp said it carried out \"annual due diligence on suppliers and encourage them to source from validated conflict-free supply chains.\"\n\"Pegatron will continue working with customers and international organizations to investigate and source minerals responsibly,\" the company added.\nFROM JEWELLERY TO APPLIANCES\nCompanies that sell consumer products in the United States are required by the Dodd-Frank Act to publish their suppliers of tin and other minerals.\nAmong the companies listing Yunnan Tin, Tiffany said one of its suppliers had indirectly sourced a \"very small amount of tin\" from the Chinese smelter for use in silver solder for jewelry and hollowware.\nThe company added that, as Yunnan Tin was certified as conflict-free by the CFSI, \"use of this smelter by our vendors is consistent with our Conflict Minerals Policy.\"\nStarbucks said small amounts of Yunnan Tin metal, sourced from second or third party suppliers, went into the ovens in its coffee shops.\nThe company had received no information indicating it was using minerals from Myanmar, a spokeswoman said, but was pushing suppliers for more detailed sourcing disclosures.\nA GE spokesman said the company strived to use ethical sourcing in its mineral supply chain, adding it had \"noted the concerns raised by Reuters and will address them through our internal process and with our external partners.\"\nA spokeswoman from discount retailer Target said in a statement it was \"committed to responsible business conduct.\"\n\"We take these allegations very seriously, and we are looking into this,\" the statement said.\n(Additional reporting by Antoni Slodkowski in Yangon, JR Wu in Taipei, Jussi Rosendahl in Helsinki and Helena Soderpalm in Stockholm, Paul Carsten in Beijing and Sijia Zhang in Hong Kong; Editing by Alex Richardson)",

Apple charges card providers for transactions via the service, which it introduced to Australia last year. \nCommonwealth Bank of Australia, Westpac Banking Corp, National Australia Bank Ltd and smaller Bendigo and Adelaide Bank Ltd, which jointly have two-thirds of the Australian credit card market, argued that letting Apple restrict use of mobile wallets was anti-competitive. \nApple has argued that third-parties should not have access to its digital wallet technology, because it would undermine customers' privacy and data security. The company's representatives did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Tuesday. \nA representative for the banks behind the application, Lance Blockley, said there would be effectively no competition against Apple for mobile payments on the iPhone if the draft determination stood. The banks would continue to argue their case with the ACCC, he said. \nThe ACCC said it would consult further and give a final decision in March. \nAustralia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd, Australia's third-biggest bank by market capitalisation, is the only one of Australia's \"Big Four\" banks to have a digital wallet agreement with Apple.

      "text": "After its official announcement of the new MacBook Pro in October, an Apple reseller in India has reported that the first stocks of the MacBook Air have finally begun to trickle in. First reported by Gadgets360 , an Apple Reseller in Kerala, going by the name of IT Net Infocomm tweeted out last evening that the new MacBook with the Touch Bar feature is now in stock and price starts at Rs 1,55,900.\nNew MacBook Pro Models With Touchbar Available .. Only Limited Stocks .. Call / Whatsapp us at 9895336171 pic.twitter.com/hWh29SO1km \n— ITNET (@itnetinfocom) November 28, 2016 \n\nAnd that would be for the 13-inch model with Touch Bar. Too small? Be prepared to shell out Rs 2,05,900 for the 15-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar. While India (and the rest of the globe) seem deprived of the MacBook Pro with Touch Bar since launch, it now appears that the stocks have just started to reach major retailers. The same reseller also pointed out that stocks are limited so you may want to take a look at the tweet in case you want to get one booked immediately.\nNow that the new MacBook has begun reaching resellers, it will only be a short while until Apple announces the availability of the refreshed MacBook Pro officially.\n\nApple went with a complete redesign to make its new MacBook Pro lighter, thinner and more powerful than the previous ones. The new MacBook Pro will be available in three flavours, a 13-inch new MacBook Pro with traditional function keys, a 13-inch MacBook Pro with the new Touch Bar and the bigger and more powerful 15-inch model. The Touch Bar also features an integrated Touch ID sensor.\n\nThe 13-inch Touch Bar base model features a 13.3-inch LED backlit IPS display with 2560×1600 native resolution and supports the wide colour gamut (P3). You can start with a 2.9GHz dual-core Intel Core i5 (Skylake) with Turbo Boost up to 3.3GHz and 4MB shared L3 cache. There’s a 256GB onboard SSD, 8GB RAM and Intel Iris Graphics 550 support. You get 4 Thunderbolt (USB-C) ports, 802.11ac Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 4.2 and 720p FaceTime camera which sits above the display. There are 3 microphones (instead of two) and you also get the 3.5mm headphone jack. A built-in 49.2-watt-hour lithium-polymer battery completes the package.\n\nMoving to the base model of the 15-inch MacBook Pro, you get a 15.4-inch LED backlit IPS display with 2880×1800 native resolution that supports the wide colour gamut (P3). The base version features a 2.6GHz quad-core Intel Core i7 (Skylake), Turbo Boost up to 3.5GHz, with 6MB shared L3 cache. There’s a 256GB PCIe-based onboard SSD coupled with 16GB of RAM. You also get a discreet Radeon Pro 450 with 2GB memory and an Intel HD Graphics 530 (automatic switching). You get 4 Thunderbolt (USB-C) ports, 802.11ac Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 4.2 and 720p FaceTime camera which sits above the display. Similar to the 13-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar, you get three microphones. A built-in 76.0-watt-hour lithium-polymer battery powers the 15-inch laptop.\nAs many have pointed out , the SSDs inside the new MacBook Pro are soldered on to the board and cannot be upgraded. So choose your weapons wisely!\nThe post Apple MacBook Pro with Touch Bar now available in India starting at Rs 1,55,900 appeared first on Tech2 .",

      "text": "0 \nNow that the iPhone 7 is in consumers’ hands, the rumor mill is turning its attention to 2017 and the iPhone 8. \nApple is reportedly asking its suppliers to increase their output of “thinner organic light emitting displays” and to give Apple prototype displays with higher resolution than Samsung’s displays. That’s according to sources speaking to the Wall Street Journal , who add Apple is currently considering 10 prototypes for its next iPhone. \nCurved displays are growing in popularity lately. Samsung’s Galaxy S7 edge is perhaps the most well-known model, and Samsung also added a curved display to the Note 7 before that device was discontinued. We’re seeing curved display phones from other manufacturers, too, including BlackBerry and Xiaomi . As such, it’s no surprise to hear that Apple is considering adding a curved display to the iPhone 8, which could help to minimize the device’s screen bezels. \nIt’s worth noting again that Apple is said to be prototyping this curved display, so it’s possible that the next iPhone won’t have a curved display. \nHave you used a device with a curved display like the S7 edge or Note 7? If so, do you like curved displays? Source:",

The update is available from the Apple Developer Center and should be rolling out over the air, too. This update comes to us two weeks after the beta 3 release . \nThe update to iOS 10.2 includes several small tweaks. Perhaps the most notable one is new emoji, like a fox and an avocado, but there are also new wallpapers as well as Apple’s new TV app for Apple TV owners. \nThere’s no word yet on when iOS 10.2 will be released to the public, but we could see it sometime before 2016 is up. Meanwhile, public testers in the Apple Beta Software Program could see iOS 10.2 beta 4 as soon as tomorrow. \nApple today released watchOS 3.1.1 beta 4 , so if you’re testing watchOS 3.1.1, go grab that update, too.

      "title": "Antitrust regulator bars Australian banks from collectively bargaining on Apple Pay",
      "text": "Three of Australia’s four biggest banks will be barred from collectively bargaining with Apple Inc over its mobile digital payments system, under a draft decision released by the antitrust regulator on Tuesday.\nAllowing banks to collectively offer their own digital wallets in Apple iPhones, in competition with Apple’s Apple Pay system, would reduce each bank’s ability to negotiate with the U.S. firm, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) said. The decision is a setback for the banks’ hopes to bypass Apple’s in-house payments system and roll out their own versions free of competition from the Silicon Valley giant, which has the biggest smartphone market share in Australia.\nIt also sets a precedent which may solidify Apple’s dominance of the digital wallet system globally, since the Australian banks had mounted the first challenge to it. “While the ACCC accepts that the opportunity for the banks to collectively negotiate and boycott would place them in a better bargaining position with Apple, the benefits are currently uncertain and may be limited,” commission Chairman Rod Sims said in a statement.\nApple Pay could fuel competition by making it easier for customers to switch between card providers and limiting the “lock-in” effect of separate bank digital wallets, he added. Apple Pay allows users to register credit cards on devices such as iPhones, and pay for goods and services by swiping the devices over contactless payment terminals. Apple charges card providers for transactions via the service, which it introduced to Australia last year.\nCommonwealth Bank of Australia, Westpac Banking Corp, National Australia Bank Ltd and smaller Bendigo and Adelaide Bank Ltd, which jointly have two-thirds of the Australian credit card market, argued that letting Apple restrict use of mobile wallets was anti-competitive. Apple has argued that third-parties should not have access to its digital wallet technology because it would undermine customers’ privacy and data security. The company’s representatives did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Tuesday.\nA representative for the banks behind the application, Lance Blockley, said there would be effectively no competition against Apple for mobile payments on the iPhone if the draft determination stood. The banks would continue to argue their case with the ACCC, he said. The ACCC said it would consult further and give a final decision in March.\nAustralia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd, Australia’s third-biggest bank by market capitalisation, is the only one of Australia’s “Big Four” banks to have a digital wallet agreement with Apple.\nReuters \nThe post Antitrust regulator bars Australian banks from collectively bargaining on Apple Pay appeared first on Tech2 .",

      "text": "Share Tweet \nBy Yimou Lee and Joel Schectman \nYANGON/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - From a remote corner of northeastern Myanmar, an insurgent army sells tin ore to suppliers of some of the world's largest consumer companies. \nMore than 500 companies, including leading brands such as smartphone maker Apple, coffee giant Starbucks and luxury jeweler Tiffany & Co, list among their suppliers Chinese-controlled firms that indirectly buy ore from the Man Maw mine near Myanmar's border with China, a Reuters examination of the supply chain found. \nThe mine is controlled by the United Wa State Army (UWSA), which the United States placed under sanctions for alleged narcotics trafficking in 2003. The seven companies extracting tin from the mine are all owned or controlled by Wa military and government leaders, Wa officials and people with close ties to UWSA leadership told Reuters. \nThis potentially puts companies, which also include industrial conglomerate General Electric, at risk of violating sanctions that forbid \"direct or indirect\" dealings with blacklisted groups, according to a former and a serving U.S. official and lawyers with expertise in sanctions enforcement. \nSeveral sanctions experts said the U.S. government was unlikely to fine companies who unwittingly used the Myanmar tin. Still, it may force them to shift to new suppliers, they said. \nA Treasury Department spokeswoman said U.S. sanctions \"generally prohibit U.S. companies from engaging in any direct or indirect transactions or dealings with individuals or entities\" on a blacklist, but declined further comment on specific circumstances. \nThe situation illustrates the difficulties facing multinationals in monitoring supply chains that have grown increasingly complex. \nFollowing a 2012 U.S. regulation, companies have spent billions of dollars scrutinizing whether certain minerals used in their products come from mines controlled by armed groups in Central Africa. \nBut the regulations do not require them to assess the origins of minerals from other conflict zones. \nApple, Tiffany and GE, and other companies contacted by Reuters, said that to fulfill those regulations they looked to an audit program designed by the industry group Conflict Free Sourcing Initiative (CFSI). \nA CFSI program director said the group was \"aware of tin exports from Myanmar to other countries and of security and human rights issues in Myanmar\". The group said it was updating its audit requirements to include \"a broader definition of conflict-affected and high-risk areas\". \nTin supply chain expert at monitoring group Global Witness, Sophia Pickles, said companies must not wholly outsource due diligence responsibility to a scheme that has exclusively focused on central Africa. \n\"Companies, not schemes, bear the primary responsibility for ensuring that supply chains are responsible,\" she said. \nCIVIL WAR \nMost of the tin mined globally is used as solder in electronics, for making batteries and plating. \nThe Man Maw mine roiled the global tin market when huge quantities of high grade ore were discovered around 2013. Annual production is now estimated at about 33,000 tons of tin concentrate, more than a 10th of global output of the metal. \nThe mine is controlled by the UWSA, the strongest of the myriad armed groups that have kept Myanmar in a state of near-perpetual civil war for decades. Reuters visited the remote mine last month, the first international media organization to do so. \nInterviews with officials running the mine, UWSA leaders and executives at Asian tin suppliers, together with an examination of public disclosures of suppliers made by companies in regulatory filings, indicate Wa tin likely ends up in an array of products made by U.S. and other international companies. \nTin from Man Maw provides revenue critical to the survival of the self-proclaimed Wa State and its rulers, who have refused to disarm or participate in Myanmar's peace process. \"There are dozens of trucks carrying tin ore to China every morning,\" the head of the Wa territory foreign affairs office, Zhao Guo An, told Reuters. \"Tin mining is the pillar of our economy. It's the biggest source of income.\" \nWhile Washington has lifted most sanctions on Myanmar, some have been kept in place, including those aimed at the UWSA. The group and several of its leaders are blacklisted under the Kingpin Act over accusations of trafficking in heroin and methamphetamine. UWSA leaders deny involvement in narcotics, saying the accusations are a smear by political opponents. \nPeter Kucik, a former senior sanctions advisor at the U.S. Treasury Department, said the findings highlighted the need for thorough due diligence. \n\"The facts suggest potential sanctions risk for the parties involved,\" Kucik said. \nTwo companies in Apple's supply chain, the world's No. 1 tin producer Yunnan Tin Co Ltd and leading Taiwan-based solder maker Shenmao Technology, told Reuters that some tin they bought was from the Wa mine. \nMandy Gan, a tin analyst from China's leading mineral research company, Asian Metal, and another tin expert, both of whom visited the UWSA mine this year, said many other Chinese smelting firms supplying global consumer goods makers also bought tin from the Man Maw mine. \nSanctions experts said even the indirect use of the tin might be considered a violation of U.S. sanctions law, which does not require authorities to prove intent. A U.S. government official involved in Myanmar policy consulted on Reuters' findings said the government was likely to investigate any ties to the UWSA. \nStill, Washington-based sanctions attorney Erich Ferrari said it was unlikely the Treasury Department would initiate an enforcement action against companies for an issue so deep in the supply chain. Once the ties were publicized, however, authorities could impose penalties if the companies did not wind down the transactions and find new suppliers, he said. \nSUPPLY CHAIN \nThe chain connecting some of the world's best known brands with a mine in one the most inaccessible corners of Southeast Asia has many links. ((For a GRAPHIC, click on: http://tmsnrt.rs/2giJmcq)) \nOne key intermediary is state-owned Yunnan Cultural Industry International (YCII), based in Yunnan, southwestern China, which said in a statement on its website that it enjoys \"a long-term, stable strategic partnership\" with the UWSA statelet. \nYCII declined several interview requests. \nYCII is, in turn, a major supplier of tin to the world's top producer, Yunnan Tin, also based in Yunnan. \nYunnan Tin supplies many companies, including big contract manufacturers such as Foxconn Technology Co and, indirectly, Pegatron Corp, whose clients include Apple. It also supplies major solder makers such as Shenmao Technology, also a supplier to Pegatron. \n\"Myanmar is not considered a conflict-affected area by CFSI...As long as smelters present a certified sourcing document, that's acceptable for us,\" said Tim Lin, an executive overseeing sourcing at Taiwan-based Shenmao, who said about a quarter of its supply of the metal came from Yunnan Tin. \nIn the last two years, Yunnan Tin has also shipped more than 12,000 tons of metal to the United States, according to shipment data from U.S.-based trade tracking company Panjiva. \nMore than 500 publicly traded companies in the United States say their suppliers use tin from Yunnan Tin or Yuntinic Resources, its San Mateo, California-based division, according to a review of the supply chain disclosures consumer companies make to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. \nTwo members of Yunnan Tin's board, vice chairwoman Yang Yimin and secretary and vice general manager Pan Wenhao, confirmed in interviews that a \"portion\" of the company's tin came from the UWSA-operated mine. \"We certainly buy tin indirectly from Myanmar,\" Pan told Reuters. \"We don't specifically pay attention to where they source their materials from.\" \nYunnan Tin mixes the Wa tin with metal from mines in central and southwestern China, said Pan, before processing it into products such as tin paste. \nThat means it is impossible to say for certain which shipments from the company contain Wa tin, but Pan estimated Yunnan Tin's purchases from the mine account for about a third of its total annual tin consumption, or at least 16,500 tons. \nApple said in a statement it worked with suppliers to help them meet stringent standards, \"and those who are ultimately unable or unwilling to comply are removed from our supply chain\". \n\"While we have no evidence of illegal tin from Myanmar in our products, we'll continue to investigate, address any issues we find and do all we can to raise standards and protect human rights,\" it said. Foxconn said it \"enforced stringent supplier management requirements in accordance with international and local conflict minerals legislation and has proactively communicated these requirements to our suppliers\". \nIt added that less than 1 percent of its tin was procured from Yunnan Tin, all of which was used in products for a \"single, non-U.S.-based customer\". Pegatron Corp said it carried out \"annual due diligence on suppliers and encourage them to source from validated conflict-free supply chains\". \n\"Pegatron will continue working with customers and international organizations to investigate and source minerals responsibly,\" the company added. FROM JEWELLERY TO APPLIANCES \nCompanies that sell consumer products in the United States are required by the Dodd-Frank Act to publish their suppliers of tin and other minerals. \nAmong the companies listing Yunnan Tin, Tiffany said one of its suppliers had indirectly sourced a \"very small amount of tin\" from the Chinese smelter for use in silver solder for jewelry and hollowware. \nThe company added that, as Yunnan Tin was certified as conflict-free by the CFSI, \"use of this smelter by our vendors is consistent with our Conflict Minerals Policy\". \nStarbucks said small amounts of Yunnan Tin metal, sourced from second or third party suppliers, went into the ovens in its coffee shops. The company had received no information indicating it was using minerals from Myanmar, a spokeswoman said, but was pushing suppliers for more detailed sourcing disclosures. A GE spokesman said the company strived to use ethical sourcing in its mineral supply chain, adding it had \"noted the concerns raised by Reuters and will address them through our internal process and with our external partners\". A spokeswoman from discount retailer Target said in a statement it was \"committed to responsible business conduct\". \"We take these allegations very seriously, and we are looking into this,\" the statement said. \n(Additional reporting by Antoni Slodkowski in Yangon, JR Wu in Taipei, Jussi Rosendahl in Helsinki and Helena Soderpalm in Stockholm, Paul Carsten in Beijing and Sijia Zhang in Hong Kong; Editing by Alex Richardson)",

      "text": "Apple to introduce ‘iPhone Pro’ in 2017 with curved OLED display   9:38 pm - Author Matthew Wilson \nIt looks like Apple may be looking to release its first curved iPhone next year as according to reports this week, the iPhone 8 lineup will feature a new top-tier model known as the iPhone Pro, which will have a different design, incorporating a high-resolution curved display and some higher specs compared to the standard and Plus models. \nThis particular rumour comes from sources speaking with The WallStreet Journal , who claim that the new third-tier of iPhone will be introduced next year and will be distinguished by its curved OLED display, while the standard and Plus models will feature the same IPS-LCD tech we see now. \nThis ties in well with previous rumours we have been hearing since before the iPhone 7 even launched. At the moment, all reports seem to be indicating that we will see an OLED iPhone next year. However, the curved display is slightly newer information and it is likely that this curve will resemble the Samsung Edge line up smartphones with two curved sides. \nAccording to the report, Apple’s suppliers have recently been asked to increase the output of thinner OLED displays and submit prototype screens with higher resolutions than Samsung’s current offerings. \nKitGuru Says: We’ve been hearing about Apple experimenting with OLED for a long time now. However, it is worth noting that at one point, all signs pointed to Apple moving on to Sapphire Glass displays too so not every persistent rumour turns out to be true- just most of them.",

      "text": "The key role of four companies from the title of this article (Facebook, Apple, Netflix, Google) starts to resemble situation from the end of the ’60s and beginning of the ‘70s. This is when American market was stormed by fashionable firms like Nifty Fifty. Investors were convinced about the limitless potential of several companies and it led to very painful crashes. How will the history end this time?\nNifty Fifty \nAt the turn of the ‘60s and ‘70s, American stock exchange received a lot of attention with investment funds being on the rise. With the money from investors they were buying promising companies with solid fundamentals. This group among others consisted of industrial leaders, healthcare and even high-tech firms. Soon these companies got themselves a nickname – ‘Nifty Fifty’.\nThe key element of the Wall Street fashion was the belief in great perspectives. A decision to buy Kodak, Polaroid or Upjohn Company was motivated by a motto of ‘buy and hold forever’. Choosing amazing company’s stock should give profits over the incoming decades and not only years or months.\nIf a stock is ‘doomed’ for eternal growth then no price is too high. The result was radical overpricing and the first Nifty Fifty peak was in 1969, second in 1972/73. In the latter P/E for the most popular companies reached respective numbers: Polaroid – 95, McDonald’s – 86, Walt Disney – 82, Digital Equipment – 56, Eastman Kodak – 44. On many occasions, investors could not count on living long enough only to receive the amount they invested but no one seemed to care.\nVery good summary of this situation is a chart below. It shows the scale of the overpricing of American stocks relative to the rest of the world. Clearly, the highest levels were reached during 1969 but also pay attention where are we today!\n\nSource: www.zerohedge.com\nIn the beginning of 1969, the reality checked the prices of McDonald’s, Walt Disney and others and made it obvious that all these hopefuls will not rise until kingdom comes. Below you can see the size of the collapse (CPI adjusted).\n\nSource: Marc Faber\nSince the burst of a bubble in 1969, the market lost 66% with another bottom in 1982. Stock prices were going down for over a decade. Far from any surprise, Nifty Fifty were on sale. Polaroid, Avon, Xerox lost 91%, 86% and 71% respectively. Many of those bearing the nickname never returned to their previously privileged position (Sears, Kresge, JC Penney). There were those who end up bankrupt (Polaroid, Eastman Kodak).\nFacebook, Amazon, Netflix, Google \nWhy we talk about Nifty Fifty today? First and foremost the shared belief of companies doomed to succeed and their infinite potential for growth. Looking back at the ’60s and ‘70s we see that the number of favoured companies is ten times lower. Four companies – FANG – are responsible for 90% of S&P 500 capitalisation since 2015.\n\nSince 2015 FANG added 630 billion USD while the rest of S&P 500 added only 45 bn USD. We can say that the growth of this index is based on the popularity of few companies.\nSimilar to fashionable Nifty Fifty also FANG had to reach extreme heights of P/E. Netflix reached 318, Amazon 178, Facebook 46 and Google 29. This is dramatically different than the market itself – 21.2 – which itself is a bubble level. During last 12 months, we had 204 instances when insiders (management, board of directors, people with high-level access) sold their stocks and NONE purchase transactions.\nApart from the acronym companies there is also Tesla. The corporation which only bleeds money while trying to overestimate their income. Soon Tesla will have to compete with huge competitors like Volkswagen or Toyota and this only raises questions about today’s price of Tesla.\nMaybe some critics will say that comparison between FANG and Nifty Fifty does not make any sense and this case is rather about popular stocks regularly falling from grace. An example of GoPro fits here as many were hopeful for this fashionable company.\n\nOf course, individual cases such as GoPro are completely normal but when we see only a few overpriced stocks being the main engine of the market – this is showing very weak fundamentals of the market.\nSummary \nThe psychology of the crowd is a major factor in both examples of Nifty Fifty and FANG. Good performance of some equities make investors interested and ensuring voices of ‘experts’ only add to this hype. Soon in the environment like this prices are disconnected from essential data.\nHow to diagnose if we are seeing maniacal buying spree? Again, we go back to basics – P/E, CAPE, P/S – they are entry level tools easy to obtain. Another red flag is overly optimistic forecasts of ‘experts’, as one of Forbes authors wrote about FANG, to paraphrase “why should we care about the environment and the market where other companies are losing money if our price is going up?”\nInformation about FANG in this article exposes S&P 500 being evidently dependable on few very popular stocks. Central banks have their part in all this as the SNB put billions in Facebook, Google and other huge corporations. Investors should now either join the crowd, hope for these gains to continue forever or look for undervalued assets. We still believe that miners, commodities and Russian and Chilean equities are far more attractive.\nDuring mania everything is ok until the red colour enters the room with catastrophic results. When investors start questioning limitless growth small drop is due. Tense atmosphere makes everyone ask themselves – who will leave next? When the panic starts there are a lot of sellers and a deficit of buyers. The Nifty Fifty history shows that 90% sale is possible. Unaware investors have to realise that in order to compensate for such loss price must jump up by 1000%.\n \nIndependent Trader Team \nThe post FANG – stocks the street buys appeared first on ValueWalk .\n",

      "text": "You are using an outdated browser. Please upgrade your browser to improve your experience. AT&T's DirecTV Now Streaming Service Will Launch Wednesday on the Apple TV, iOS Devices and More Anyone who prepays for three months of service will receive a free Apple TV by Brent Dirks November 28, 2016 \nThere’s a new way for Apple device users to say goodbye to the cable company. AT&T has just unveiled its new DirecTV Now live TV streaming service. It will officially launch on Wednesday, Nov. 30 and be available on the Apple TV, iOS devices, a Mac, and many other outlets. Starting at $35 per month \nThe different packages are taken from DirecTV’s traditional satellite TV service. Here are the available plans. Live a Little – $35 / month (60+ channels) Just Right – $50 / month (80+ channels) Go Big – $60 / month (100+ channels) Gotta Have it – $70 / month (120+ channels) \nHBO and Cinemax fans can add those channels to their service for an additional $5 each per month. \nTo celebrate the launch, for a limited time, the Go Big package will be $35 per month. Subscribers will be able to keep that rate as long as they continue with the service. \nIf you’re still in the market for a new Apple TV, you can prepay for three months of service and receive the set-top box for free, more than likely the 32GB model that retails for $149. \nAT&T mobile customers can also access the DirecTV Now service without it counting against their existing data limits. \nAnyone interested in checking it out can sign up for a free, seven-day trial . And make sure to keep it here at AppAdvice as we will offer our first take after the launch and let you know how it compares to two other services available on the Apple TV, iPhone, and iPad – PlayStation Vue and Sling TV .

      "text": "Apple cider vinegar \nThis healthy salad dressing ingredient is also reputed to be a great natural toner for your skin due to its antimicrobial and anti- inflammatory properties. Note: be sure to mix one part ACV to two parts water (it’s very strong!). \nVerdict: Great spot treatment that you can feel (and smell) working its antimicrobial magic. \n“This is the one DIY acne treatment that I felt gave me instant results. Although the smell is quite intense—maybe don’t try this one if you’re sharing a bed with your S.O.—it felt the most like a spot treatment for my troubled areas at night. When I applied in the morning, my skin stayed matte for much longer—even on super humid days. Now if someone can just invent odor-free ACV….” — Katie Maguire, Associate Editor \n“Although the smell was quite unpleasant, I felt like it truly killed all of the acne-causing bacteria on—and underneath—my skin. Nothing’s noticeable after wiping your face with it, but I woke up with less redness on my acne spots and didn’t get any new breakouts after I used it for almost a week—which speaks volumes considering my very temperamental complexion. If you just get past the odor, you can pretty much kiss all store-bought toners goodbye.” — Rachel Lapidos, Assistant Editor 3/7 Spearmint tea \nDrinking two to three cups a day reportedly has anti-inflammatory powers, and a study done last year by the American Academy of Dermatology found that two cups a day greatly reduced breakouts . It’s also known to help regulate your acne-causing hormones (called androgens). \nVerdict: Aids in a brighter glow (and keeps you hydrated). \n“I happened to have a really terrible breakout right when this experiment started, so I seemed to heavily rely on these frequent daily cups of tea. That said, my skin didn’t exactly clear any faster than a normal breakout would, but I do think that overall my complexion looked brighter and healthier than normal. Perhaps because it helped me avoid my afternoon caffeine fallback in favor of a healthier, more hydrating tea.” — Katie Maguire, Associate Editor \n“It’s hard to say whether or not the spearmint played a powerful role in keeping my skin clear, but I will say this: It was a refreshing way to get me to keep refilling my mug at work—and hydration is crucial in keeping skin looking glowy. For that alone, it was worth adding in to my tea rotation, alongside a.m. green tea and evening chamomile.” — Rebecca Willa Davis, Deputy Editor 4/7 Honey and turmeric mask \nI’ve had excellent results replacing my facial cleanser with honey (which is antimicrobial), and turmeric is a super-power anti-inflammatory spice that’s said to aid in skin health —so mixed together, they’re a pretty powerful face mask. But I wanted to see if my colleagues had the same success. \nVerdict: Seriously soothes any redness. \n“Judging by what turmeric does to my fingertips (and my bamboo utensils) when I’m cooking—AKA deeply stains them bright yellow—I was afraid to put it anywhere near my face. Good news: No staining! And the other good news: After rinsing the honey mixture off each night (FYI warm water gets the sticky job done much faster), my skin felt smoother, calmer, and deeply cleansed. Not only was I not bright yellow, but my tendency toward redness was corrected. Pro tip: Don’t put it on too thick, since the heat of your skin melts the honey and thins it out—sending drips down your face, your neck, and beyond. Your couch will thank you!” — Erin Hanafy, Senior Editor, Articles & Special Projects \n“I really wanted this to do wonders to my skin—honey and all-powerful turmeric ? Please work your magic. Although I do think the honey helped to calm my face, I don’t think the turmeric was as anti-inflammatory on my skin as it is in my food. Plus, it was a little messy—as in, it dripped down my tank top. And honey, no matter how powerfully healthy, is pretty sticky and hard to clean off of fabric!” — Katie Maguire, Associate Editor 5/7 Graphic: Katherine Sokolova Papaya \nThis lovely smoothie ingredient and immunity-boosting fruit contains papain, an enzyme that’s been said to be an effective treatment for mild to moderate acne . \nVerdict: Not worth the mess. \n“This one was a bit tedious to prepare. I scooped out most of the seeds and put the papaya pulp into the food processor before applying it to my face. Inevitably there were still seeds in my DIY face mask. The papaya kept sliding off my face, but I managed to get enough on there and after about 10 minutes, I could feel it tighten on my face. Bonus points: It smelled great. But after keeping the face mask on for about 25 minutes, the only difference I noticed afterwards was that my skin felt dry. It was actually the opposite of what I expected!” — Emily Laurence, Food Editor \n“I’ve admittedly never sliced open a papaya before, so working with its texture was new to me. After mashing it up, it still didn’t really stay on my skin—chunks kept sliding off, so this is a really messy endeavor. The worst part? It didn’t do anything for my breakouts. My skin didn’t feel particularly soft or look glowy—instead, it was a bit dry to the touch, and my red spots were still pretty angry-looking. I’d recommend saving this for your smoothies.” — Rachel Lapidos, Assistant Editor 6/7 Graphic: Katherine Sokolova Yogurt \nThe probiotic-packed snack’s not just good for your gut; studies have shown it to be helpful in achieving that natural glow. What happens when you slather it all over your face, as if it’s a mask? \nVerdict: Firming and good for redness, but smelly. \n“I was surprised initially at just how cold the yogurt was when I put it on my face—yes, I knew it was refrigerated but the feeling was less ‘at-home spa’ and more ‘how long do I have to do this?’ And in terms of a sensory experience, cold wasn’t the only drawback. The scent was…earthy. After sitting on my face for a couple minutes, the yogurt began to smell like milk approaching its sell-by date. But when the 20 minutes was up, the results were impressive: My skin was lightly exfoliated—reportedly due to the lactic acid (a type of alpha-hydroxy acid) that yogurt naturally contains. It was noticeably smoother and firmer, with no redness added, and my pores had seriously gone bye-bye. Amazing! That smell, though. I’ll definitely try this again but I’ll need to do some essential oil experiments—neutralizing the stank is a must.” Erin Hanafy, Senior Editor, Articles & Special Projects “I stay away from dairy as much as possible since it causes inflammation, so the idea of putting Greek yogurt on my face was a little iffy to me. (I always thought dairy caused acne ?) And perhaps because of my preconceived notions, it wasn’t my jam. The smell grossed me out the whole 20 minutes it was on my face. So, was it worth the results? Real talk: I only did this mask one time because I missed my yummy-smelling normal face mask so much, but I was mildly surprised by the results of the yogurt. Even though the texture is nothing like clay, it still had the same firming effect.” — Emily Laurence, Food Editor 7/7 Graphic: Katherine Sokolova Potato slices \nThis one may sound out-there, but nothing will stand in the way of clear skin—not even rubbing the starchy tuber on our faces. Potatoes have been used as a plant-based acne treatment , and some say swiping slices of it on your face helps keep oily skin under control. \nVerdict: Moisturizing and helps with pigmentation, but requires regular use. \n“Potato slices are cucumber slices’ less glamorous, starchy cousin. And the same goes for their effect on your skin: Though they felt really moisturizing (almost creamy) as I rubbed them on my problem areas, it didn’t have an immediate noticeable benefit. But that’s not to say it didn’t do anything— I was shocked, but my acne did seem less angry, and my skin seemed like a moisturizer was just applied all over it. I only did it several times, but I think with habitual potato rubbing, my skin would look more even.” — Rachel Lapidos, Assistant Editor \n“I was really surprised by the whole process. For one thing: potatoes are actually pretty juicy! (Who knew?) I sliced a bunch, thinking I’d go through them quickly, but one was more than enough to coat myself in potato juice. (Yup, it smelled exactly how you’d think.) Another thing: It almost felt like I was applying a serum on my face, which was very unexpected. While I wouldn’t recommend trying this out if you’re in the midst of a serious flare-up—rubbing something solid on top of a breakout is not a great idea—it could be good post-breakout, when you’ve got an ex-pimple spot on your face. (Potato is said to help with pigmentation, but I didn’t use it enough to see a huge difference.)” — Rebecca Willa-Davis, Deputy Editor \nNot ready to rely on just your smoothie ingredients for skin care? Try these acne-fighting facial oils —and yes, oils give you glowing skin, not zits . You May Also Like",

      "title": "Five Great Ideas Apple 'Borrowed' and Made Wildly Popular",
      "text": "Apple wasn’t the first to invent many features its products have today Apple didn't invent Wi-Fi or touch screens, but popularised them Apple's success lies in popularising these ideas beyond the originals \nApple is seen by many as a cutting edge technology company that has to set the trend, but that's actually not often the case. There are some exceptions - for instance when Steve Jobs demonstrated Wi-Fi for the first time on a laptop (the iBook G3), or the time when a high-DPI ‘Retina’ Display was shown for the first time on a smartphone. But usually, what Apple does best is find great ideas, refine them with its implementation, and make them the norm, where they were wild ideas to begin with. Apple has picked up many such features over the years, and made them the de facto standard. Here are our five favourites. \n1) Capacitive screens Most touchscreen phones used to be bundled with a stylus, before the iPhone came along. That’s because most phones from the pre-iPhone era sported resistive touchscreen panels, and weren't really meant to be used with our fingers. But note the use of the word \"most\". Although Apple may have popularised the usage of finger-friendly, multi-touch-enabled capacitive touch screens since 2007, the LG Prada KE850 beat Apple to the title of \"the first phone with a capacitive screen\", being released in December 2006.\nSo why is Apple is remembered more than anybody else for capacitive screens? The answer lies in the way the iOS (then iPhone OS) user interface was designed - it was much more intuitive and easy to be used with fingers than any phone seen before it. Fast-forward to today - and almost every touchscreen you’ll use today operates similarly to how the iPhone first did in 2007, and practically every phone comes with a finger-friendly capacitive display. \n2) Virtual assistants Virtual Assistants have been around in some form or the other long before the arrival of Siri on the iPhone 4s in 2011. One could think of Microsoft’s much-loathed ‘Clippy’ Office Assistant in MS Office, for example. Then there was Google’s Voice Search, and Apple’s own Voice Control, prior to Siri, which used voice recognition to process simple commands like making calls or playing music. \nBut Siri paved the way to make virtual assistants truly useful by understanding the way humans naturally speak. Instead of dispensing monotone commands, you could have a conversation with an artificially-intelligent assistant, capable of interpreting the meaning behind the words. The real jump was moving from a rigid list of commands, to actual language processing to understand the user's intent in a normal sentence. \nToday, every virtual assistant from Microsoft’s Cortana , to the new Google Assistant , are based on the same conversational, person-emulating nature that Siri made the norm. But just because Apple was instrumental in popularising this, doesn’t mean it’s still the best at it - we found Google’s voice recognition and knowledge-base to be superior to Siri in many ways. \n3) Fingerprint scanners Fingerprint scanners aren't exactly new technology. Smartphones such as the Toshiba Portege G500 have had it since 2007, while the Motorola Atrix was the first Android phone to have a fingerprint scanner, back in 2011. Apple didn't introduce this technology until 2013, when it introduced Touch ID with the iPhone 5s . So what was the special sauce with Touch ID? \nOlder fingerprint scanners required you to swipe on the embedded reader to operate. It was clunky, and not always convenient to do so. With Touch ID on the other hand, you could simply rest your finger on the sensor of an iPhone, making it easier to use. Next, the placement of the scanners on phones prior were at awkward positions, which made that swipe gesture even harder to perform. Again, on the iPhone, Touch ID was easier to use because it was conveniently placed in the home button of the device. Although the placement isn't completely standard across devices (many Android phones have it at the back), Apple's method of operation is now the norm. \n4) Contactless mobile payments Among the long list of things that the smartphone has already replaced (like MP3 Players), our wallet has been on the radar for some time now. Contactless payments are not new at all - it's been big in Japan since as early as 2004 . Google also made an attempt in 2011 with Google Wallet , but didn’t see meaningful adoption. \nIn 2014, built into the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus , Apple Pay was the Cupertino-based company’s foray into mobile payments. Working in tandem with the Touch ID fingerprint authentication mechanism and the standardised NFC protocol, Apple Pay offered security and convenience over typical debit or credit cards while transacting. \nNext year, Google deprecated the mobile payments feature on the Google Wallet app, instead creating Android Pay - a separate brand that works similar to the way Apple’s system does. Samsung also came up with Samsung Pay after acquiring a startup called LoopPay the year after Apple Pay was launched - bringing advantages like compatibility with regular swipe machines, not just the NFC-compatible contactless ones. \nWith payments, Apple is far from the market leader right now, in an area that is still developing. Despite this, the company was able to fine tune existing systems and come up with a solution that is now the de facto standard. \n5) Dynamic function keys on computers The Touch Bar that replaces the Function key row on the new MacBook Pro isn’t a new idea. The Thinkpad X1 Carbon in 2014 showcased a similar adaptive function key row, though it’s not really as vivid as a proper touchscreen used for the Touch Bar and had limited functionality. Safe to say that the idea didn’t really take off for Lenovo back then. \nMicrosoft’s prototype ‘Adaptive Keyboard’, which was shown even earlier, in 2010, appeared to be more feature-rich than Apple’s Touch Bar, as the entire keyboard was adaptive, not just the top area, but it never made it to production. Although Touch Bar on the new MacBook Pro is getting mixed reviews as of now, given Apple’s track record of well-planned feature implementations, it might just be the most popular dynamic function key row implementation we’ll see for long. And if it ends up working for many people, maybe we will see other PC makers implement Apple’s take on this feature, just like they ended up doing for all the ones above.",

      "text": "International Business Australian regulator set to oppose collective bank bargaining on Apple Pay Australia's antitrust regulator said on Tuesday it is likely to deny four local banks permission to collectively bargain with Apple Inc in relation to its mobile digital payments system. Posted 29 Nov 2016 08:10 Updated 29 Nov 2016 14:10 Apple staff are silhouetted through the glass front of Australia's flagship store in the minutes leading up to the first sale of the iPhone 7 and Apple Watch Series 2 in Sydney, September 16, 2016. REUTERS/Steven Saphore A \nSYDNEY: Australia's antitrust regulator said on Tuesday it is likely to deny four local banks permission to collectively bargain with Apple Inc in relation to its mobile digital payments system. \nBut the preliminary decision was \"finely balanced\" and could be reversed if the banks make a convincing case before a final opinion is due in March, Australian Competition and Consumer Commission Chairman Rod Sims told Reuters. \nLosing the case would be a setback to the banks' hopes of bypassing Apple's in-house payments system and rolling out their own iPhone versions free of competition from the Silicon Valley giant, which has the biggest smartphone market share in Australia. \nUnder Australian law, bargaining cartels can be formed as long as they have permission from authorities, and the banks are seeking the ability to offer their own digital wallets in Apple iPhones - the first major challenge to Apple Pay of its kind. \nCommonwealth Bank of Australia , Westpac Banking Corp , National Australia Bank Ltd and smaller rival Bendigo and Adelaide Bank Ltd also want to bargain with Apple over charging customers extra fees for transactions made through Apple Pay. \nA successful application would allow the banks - which jointly have two-thirds of the Australian credit card market - to collectively boycott Apple Pay for up to three years as a negotiating tactic. \nApple has argued that third parties should not have access to its digital wallet technology because it would undermine customers' privacy and data security. The company's representatives did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Tuesday. \nApple Pay allows users to register credit cards on devices such as iPhones, and pay for goods and services by swiping the devices over contactless payment terminals. Apple charges card providers for transactions via the service, which it introduced to Australia last year. \nIn their application, the banks argue that there is an information imbalance weighted in Apple's favor due to the secret nature of the terms Apple has agreed with competitors over the use of Apple Pay, including fees. \nSims said that if the ACCC determines that the heart of the banks' complaint lies with fees, then it would be difficult for them to win the case. But if it is more about access to Apple's contactless payment technology, then they had a stronger case. \nA representative for the banks behind the application, Lance Blockley, said there would be effectively no competition against Apple for mobile payments on the iPhone if the draft determination stood. The banks would continue to argue their case with the ACCC, he said. \nAustralia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd is the only one of Australia's \"Big Four\" banks to have a digital wallet agreement with Apple, betting that being one of the first to offer the service would help bring in more customers. \n(Reporting by Jamie Freed and Byron Kaye; Editing by Stephen Coates and Edwina Gibbs) - Reuters",

Apple’s calendar app allows invites to be sent by unauthenticated users and pushed directly to a handset, a report in Forbes said. “You get a bubble alert on the calendar app, text in your inbox you have to read and depending how you have set up your device you might get a ‘useful’ notification that you have no choice but to read and clear,” the report pointed out.

      "text": "TEL AVIV (Reuters) - Cellcom, Israel's biggest mobile phone operator, said on Monday it will offer Apple TV as it launched its new Cellcom TV app.\nCellcom said it will be the first in Israel to offer its multi-channel television, including broadcast channels and video on demand content, on Apple TV's streaming service at no extra charge.\nCellcom is a newcomer to the Israeli television market. Seeking new streams of revenue, it launched a low price, Internet-based service last year that competes with cable company HOT and satellite TV firm YES, a subsidiary of Bezeq.\nCellcom has now surpassed 100,000 subscribers, still well below YES and HOT. But Cellcom added 12,000 subscribers in the last quarter while the other two services lost clients.\n\"We had a mission to change the TV market,\" Cellcom Chief Executive Nir Sztern told a news conference. \"This move enables clients to disconnect from the set-top box. We need to bring broadcast over IP (Internet protocol).\"\nIn the United States, Time Warner offers some customers the option to swap their cable box for a Roku streaming player.\n(Reporting by Tova Cohen)",

The MacBook Pro Touch Bar comes in two size variants of 13.3-inch and 15.3-inch and is priced at Rs 155,900 and Rs 205,900 respectively. Apple also launched a 13.3-inch MacBook Pro variant without the Touch Bar. While Apple did reveal the India pricing for the MacBook Pro Touch Bar, it did not share any details of its arrival. The MacBook Pro without the Touch Bar made its way to the Indian market during mid-November, and now the MacBook Pro Touch Bar has also arrived. \nIT Net Infocomm, an Apple reseller in Kerala, on its Twitter handle announced the availability of the new Macbooks along with price details. The tweet is also accompanied by a detailed sheet of the different variants available, including the one without the Touch Bar as well. The 13-inch variant of the MacBook Pro Touch Bar with 256GB storage is priced at Rs 155,900, while the 512GB storage variant is priced at Rs 172,900. The 15-inch variant of the MacBook Pro Touch Bar with 256GB storage is priced at Rs 205,900, while the 512GB storage variant is priced at Rs 241,900. Both the variants are available in the two color options of Silver and Space Grey. As for the MacBook Pro without the Touch Bar, it is available in Silver and Space Grey colors at a price of Rs 129,900. New MacBook Pro Models With Touchbar Available .. Only Limited Stocks .. Call / Whatsapp us at 9895336171 pic.twitter.com/hWh29SO1km \n— ITNET (@itnetinfocom) November 28, 2016 \nBGR India reached out to a few stores in Delhi to find out about the availability of the new MacBook series. While one of the retailers didn’t have the stock right now, but said it will be available in next 10-15 days. Though, iWorld in Kamla Nagar said they had the new MacBook devices. \nApple’s new MacBook Pro created a lot of stir with the Touch Bar, which includes a set of interchangeable buttons. The on-screen buttons can also be configured to show a range of different shortcuts, and they do so based on the app being used. For example, if one is working on a Word document, the on-screen buttons will change into shortcuts like copy, paste, and other related tools. The same goes for Photoshop, which would bring shortcuts like brush adjustment, and more. The Touch Bar along with Quick Type and deep learning also helps in typing easier by offering contextual word recommendations. ALSO READ: Apple now wants to sell you an adapter to connect the iPhone to your new MacBook Pro \nThere’s a Touch ID power button located above the Delete key which is embedded with a fingerprint scanner. This allows the user to login directly to the system. Using Apple’s latest macOS Sierra, the Apple Pay integration on the latest MacBook Pro has taken a notch higher. The Touch ID button authentication allows the user to make payments on online transactions. While all this sounds exciting, there is a disappointing factor as well with the MacBook Pro Touch Bar. ALSO READ: MacBook Pro Touch Bar teardown reveals it is impossible to repair \nApple has replaced the USB ports with Thunderbolt 3.0 ports, which have the same connector as USB Type-C. This means that an adapter will be required to connect anything with the MacBook including an iPhone or an iPad. Along with that, the MagSafe power connector and the SD card slot are also removed. Interestingly, Apple has kept the 3.5mm audio jack, which is not available in the latest iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. ALSO READ: Phil Schiller explains why Apple dropped SD card slot but retained 3.5mm audio port on the new MacBook Pro Apple MacBook Pro with Touch Bar specifications \nThe base 13-inch variant of the MacBook Pro with Touch Bar features an LED-backlit display with IPS technology, 2560×1600 native resolutions with 227 pixels. It is powered by Intel Core i5 dual-core processor clocked at 2.9GHz (Turbo Boost up to 3.3GHz) with Intel Iris Graphics 550. It comes with 8GB of RAM and storage options of 256GB and 512GB. \nThe 15-inch variant of the MacBook Pro with Touch Bar is powered by Intel Core i7 quad-core processor and paired with Radeon Pro 456 graphics. It comes with 16GB of RAM and storage options of 256GB and 512GB. The 256GB variant’s processor is clocked at 2.6GHz, while the 512GB variant’s processor is clocked at 2.7GHz. \nThe two variants of the MacBook Pro with Touch Bar come with pressure sensitive Force Touch feature to simulate a click. The connectivity options offered include Wi-Fi 802.11ac and Bluetooth 4.2. For photography, the new MacBook Pros come with a 720p FaceTime HD camera and both run on Apple’s latest macOS Sierra. The 13-inch variant is charged with a 49.2-watt battery and the 15-inch variant with a 76.0 watt battery which Apple says will give 10 hours of battery life as in the older MacBook Pros.",

      "title": "WSJ: iPhone 8 with curved OLED display may launch next year",
      "text": "Apple’s iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus are the best-selling smartphones in the world by a significant margin, regardless of whether or not sales are measuring up to analysts’ guesstimates. Apple’s manufacturing partners still haven’t even come close to building enough iPhone 7 Plus supply to meet demand, and the smaller iPhone 7 is thought to be selling quite quickly as well. Strong iPhone 7 and 7 Plus sales are even more impressive when you consider the fact that Apple reused the same hardware design for a third consecutive year in 2016 — people still want to upgrade to these powerful new iPhones even though they look almost identical to iPhones released all the way back in 2014.\nNow, imagine what demand will be like if Apple releases a completely redesigned iPhone 8 with a new curved OLED display.\nDEAL ALERT: The best Cyber Monday sale of the season is happening right now!\nThe Wall Street Journal published a lengthy report on Monday morning suggesting that Apple might launch a new iPhone in 2017 with a curved OLED display. Unfortunately, there aren’t many firm details in the report, despite its length.\nA few claims stand out. First, WSJ says that Apple is currently testing more than 10 different prototypes for next year’s new iPhone 8, and it has not yet decided which new design will be featured on the final version of the phone. According to the paper’s sources, at least one of the 10+ prototypes in testing features a curved OLED display, but it’s not clear if that is the version of the iPhone 8 that will debut next year.\nApple has supposedly asked its suppliers to increase OLED output, and it has also requested prototypes of OLED screens that feature “better resolution than ones from Samsung,” in an effort to “differentiate its models.” This claim sounds dubious at best.\nSamsung’s current OLED panels feature 2K resolution. It’s entirely possible that Apple is testing higher-resolution screens for its next iPhones, but there is no chance that the motivation behind upping the resolution of its displays has anything to do with Samsung or its phones. Apple has stayed with comparatively low-resolution displays on its recent iPhones — 720p on the iPhone 7, 1080p on the iPhone 7 Plus — because on displays of this size, pixel count doesn’t have a huge impact on image quality once you hit a certain threshold. If Apple is toying with 4K displays, interest surrounding virtual reality applications would be a far more likely explanation.\nWSJ also reiterated an earlier report from KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, suggesting that the OLED iPhone 8 will be just one of several new iPhone models that will be released in 2017. Other models will probably still utilize LCD displays, and the OLED iPhone will likely carry a higher price tag.\nTrending right now:\nBest Buy Cyber Monday 2016 deals: Huge savings on TVs, computers and more Walmart’s Cyber Monday sale kicks off right now – here are Sunday’s best deals Two of eBay’s most popular Black Friday 2016 deals are still available today See the original version of this article on BGR.com",

      "text": "Companies Back-dated receipts used for Apple iPhone sales after demonetisation: Report Though handsets are registering a dip in sales when compared to the same period last year, iphone sales in November are said to have grown by 20-30 percent. Pranshu Rathi November 29, 2016 14:07 IST A salesman checks a customer's iPhone at a mobile phone store in New Delhi, July 27 2016. Reuters file \nSale of Apple iPhones spiked immediately after the announcement of the demonetisation move on November 8 as scores of customers rushed to buy the phones with their banned currency and some stores even booked sales through back-dated receipts. \nOver 1 lakh iPhones were sold around the time, allowing the company to become the only phone maker to meet sales target in November, according to Economic Times, which cited trade estimates to conclude the ballpark figure. The figure of one lakh makes 3/4th of the company's average monthly iPhone sales. Gold prices continue on downward spiral \nEven though handset sales as a whole across the industry are registering a dip when compared to their sales in the same period last year, iphone sales in November are estimated to have grown by 20-30 percent. \n\"iPhones were sold out in most of the neighborhood stores after demonetisation. In fact, on that night (of November 8) itself, several stores sold iPhones till midnight. Some even sold them at a premium,\" the owner of a leading cellphone store in New Delhi was quoted as saying to the Times of India. \nThe surge in sales in the first few days following the scrapping of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes on the evening of November 8 was similar to the demand witnessed for high-value luxury items, such as gold, gems, and other precious metals. \nOther reasons suggested for the surge in sales include a decline in grey market deals, easy availability of consumer finance and wider acceptance of credit cards and digital payment at stores. \nIn October also, iPhone beat other rivals, such as Samsung, in the sale of their premium/flagship models. Apple led with a 66 percent share of sales, and was trailed by Samsung, which accounted for 23 percent of the total sales from Galaxy S7 and similar phones. Google registered 10 percent of the sales, and only 1 percent was attributed to other makers. \n\"Our iPhone sales in India were up over 50 percent in fiscal 2016 compared to the prior year, and we believe we're just beginning to scratch the surface of this large and growing market opportunity,\" chief executive Tim Cook told analysts in October during Apple's quarterly earnings call. \nWhile Samsung still sells more basic smartphones worldwide and in India than Apple, with a hefty price tag of Rs 60,000 to Rs 92,000 for models such as iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, Apple is able to generate sustainable profits due to their high cost.

      "text": "Last Updated: NOV 29, 2016 New Delhi Email Author \nThe latest MacBook Pro from Apple has been announced in India. All three models of the 2016 edition of MacBook Pro - two 13 inch and one 15 inch are now available in the country, with prices starting from Rs 1,55,900 for the Touch Bar variants and Rs 1,29,900 for ones without it. \nA Kerla based Apple reseller tweeted the availability of the new laptops with their price list. It also reveals that two color variants of all the models - silver and space grey, will be available in India. â€” ITNET (@itnetinfocom) November 28, 2016 \nApple announced the new MacBook Pro last month with significant changes in its design. Though Apple is touting Touch Bar to be its most innovative feature, the notebook has also been made lighter and thinner. The 13 inch model houses the integrated Intel Iris Graphics with Core i5 processor while the 15-inch has switchable Radeon Pro graphics with Core i7 processor, making them over twice as fast as the previous models. Base variants of three models have SSDs accounting for the total 256GB storage onboard, while higher end models house 512GB SSD. \nTwo of the three models announced carry a Touch Bar and power button with Apple Touch ID that can be used for securing the laptop with your fingerprints and is integrated with Apple Pay. The Touch Bar, on the other hand, is a touch sensitive strip placed above the keyboard that allows for easy navigation, photo or video editing and browsing, among other things. More shortcut keys can be put on Touch Bar for use as desired. \nThe laptops use USB-C ports instead of the standard ones and Thunderbolt 3 ports instead of the Thunderbolt 2 that will enable almost double the transfer speeds. That would make a few connectors and drives redundant (you would need adapter for Thunderbolt 3), but on a user-friendly note the new ones can be attached in either way as they are reversible. The MacBook Pro supports 5K display output and two displays can be connected simultaneously using the new Thunderbolt 3 interface. Also Read: MacBook Pro: 6 things it lacks. For some this will be deal-breaking \nApple claims a battery backup of 10 hours on the new MacBook Pro. Other upgrades include a brighter Retina display with wider color spectrum, redesigned dual speaker system that is louder, a larger force touch trackpad and keyboard with second generation \"butterfly mechanism\".

Akin to an iPhone, the physical home button works in the same manner on the iPad. However, if rumors are to be believed, Apple could experiment with the Touch ID sensor layered beneath the display glass or replace the button with a virtual button or gestures. Without the home button, the purported iPad is set to become the first iOS device to undergo this radical design change. At 10.9-inches, the iPad will then sit in the same category as the current 9.7-inch iPad. According to a report on 9to5Mac, the purported tablet could",

      "text": "ACCC rejects banks' Apple bargaining bid Australian Associated Press X \nCommonwealth Bank, Westpac and National Australia Bank look to have failed to secure permission to collectively bargain with Apple to allow iPhone users to make mobile payments from their' own digital wallets, rather than Apple Pay. \nANZ is the only major Australian bank to sign up with the California-based tech giant which restricts contactless payments on Apple devices to its own Apple Pay platform. \nThe other three major banks - CBA, Westpac and NAB - along with Bendigo and Adelaide Bank want the competition watchdog's authorisation to bargain together with Apple, but the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission on Tuesday said it expects to deny their request. \nThe banks also want Apple to remove restrictions stopping them passing on Apple's fees. \nACCC chairman Rod Sims says allowing the banks to bargain collectively could reduce or distort competition in a number of markets. \n\"Apple Wallet and other non-bank digital wallets could represent a disruptive technology that may increase competition between the banks by making it easier for consumers to switch between card providers and limiting any 'lock in' effect bank digital wallets may cause,\" Mr Sims said in a statement. \n\"Authorisation would allow the banks to agree to not sign up to Apple Pay for three years,\" Mr Sims said in the ACCC's draft determination, which will now be subject to further public consultation ahead of a final decision in March. \nThe ACCC also frowned upon any boycott of Apple by CBA, NAB, Westpac and Bendigo. \n\"This is a significant period of uncertainty and would result in decreased choice for consumers whose banks engage in this conduct.\" ",

      "text": "A drone's eye view of Apple's new core \nRecently released drone video shows the new campus of Apple Inc. located in Cupertino, California. \nIn a brochure mailed out to local residents in 2012, Apple said the new 176-acre campus would include wooded walking areas, restaurants and a 100,000 square foot fitness centre. \nOn the company's website, Apple says it expects to move in around 12,000 of its employees when the project is complete in early 2017. \nThe campus will become the company's new headquarters and is located about one mile east of its current headquarters in Cupertino. \nThe website also says the facility will run on 100 per cent renewable energy. \nApple bought most of the land for the campus from Hewlett Packard, where late Apple co-founder Steve Jobs got one of his first summer jobs after calling HP founder Bill Hewlett to ask for spare parts. \nJobs personally showed the architectural plans for the new campus to the Cupertino city council in 2011, despite being ill at the time. \n\"It's a little like a spaceship landed,\" Jobs had said of the circular building with its massive interior courtyard. \nThe main building spans 2.8 million square feet and is more than four stories high. There is also an underground 1000-seat auditorium. ",

      "title": "LG’s crazy high-resolution 5K 27-inch display arrives in December through Apple",
      "text": "lg inch ultrafine k display listed apple More LG Electronics originally introduced its new UltraFine 27-inch 5K display at the end of October, a desktop panel cramming in 218 pixels per inch to create a crazy 5,120 x 2,880 resolution. It’s based on In-Plane Switching display technology that’s best known for its huge color depth and wide viewing angles, which is ideal for creative professionals needing a screen at this size. LG’s 5K display was previously available to pre-order directly from Apple , but it now appears that the display is currently unavailable, and will again be offered for sale in “December.”\n“The color reproduction capabilities of the UltraFine 5K display allow it to cover 99 percent of the P3 color space,” LG stated last month in its reveal . “What’s more, the monitor’s advanced IPS display technology minimizes color shift and color loss from any viewing angle, ensuring that users see the original content as it was meant to be seen.”\nHere are the specs pulled from Apple’s listing:\nSize (diagonal): 27 inches Resolution: 5,120 x 2,880 Number of pixels: Over 14.7 million Brightness: 500 nits Color gamut: P3 color space Built-in camera: Yes Built-in microphone: Yes Speakers: 2x Stereo Size: 18.3” (H) x 24.6” (W) x 9.4” (D) Weight: 18.7 pounds Ports: 1x Thunderbolt 3\n3x USB 3.1 Type-C As the specs show, we don’t have the finer details such as how many times the screen’s max resolution is refreshed per second (refresh rate) or how fast in milliseconds the pixels can change from fully white to completely black to white again (response time). However, Apple states that the included Thunderbolt 3 port provides up to 85 watts of charging power for MacBook Pro models with Thunderbolt 3 Type-C ports.\nThe P3 color space supported by this panel is typically used by digital movies here in the United States, and was defined by the Digital Cinema Initiatives (DCI) organization. It has the same blue primary color used by the Adobe RGB and sRGB color spaces, but has a different red primary than the other two. Thus, P3 provides more color than sRGB, and is seemingly equal in size to Adobe RGB. However, P3 has more reds and less blues and greens when compared to Adobe RGB.\nMore: LG is offering owners full refunds for a Nexus 5X hardware malfunction\nAccording to Apple, this upcoming 5K display is ideal for photo and video editing, working with a huge number of on-screen windows, and watching high-resolution videos. To use this panel, customers need MacOS Sierra 10.12.1 or later, and a Mac with a Thunderbolt 3 port. It comes with a 6.56-inch Thunderbolt 3 cable, a power cord, and a VESA cover for disconnecting the screen from its stand and mounting it on the customer’s preferred VESA mounting solution.\nRight now, Apple only lists the month of December as the display’s availability: an actual date isn’t provided. Even more, the “Add to Bag” button is currently grayed out, indicating that Apple may already be filled up on pre-orders for now. The price is a surprisingly low $974, but that may be for a limited time only as an introductory price.\nSurface Studio vs. iMac: Which all-in-one does it all best? Cinema Display fans will have to wait as Apple shows off LG 5K screen instead Eizo’s new 27-inch ColorEdge monitors target hobbyists, prosumers, and real pros",

      "text": "Post by Mark \nBack before the iPod came out and Apple became popular, there was an Apple store located across the street from Salhiya. As a teenager I used to walk by the store and dream about owning a Power Mac which I thought back then was one of the hottest looking computers on the market. Fast forward around a decade later and that Apple store was abandoned. I ended up taking some photos of it in that abandoned state and published them online as part of my Miskan project. The photos got picked up by the likes of Engadget and Gizmodo since the store was like a time capsule. After my 15 seconds of fame that was it.. until this week. \nSomehow the photos have started making their rounds around the internet again, they first got posted on reddit and then the popular YouTuber EverythingApplePro who has like 3 million subscribers shared the photos in his latest video. Gotta love the internet. My pictures make it in his video above at the 2:10 mark but you can check out all the photos I had taken back then [ Here ] \nI eventually ended up getting the vinyl ‘Think Different’ campaign banners that are in the photos. I still have them tucked away in my closet and from what I’ve been able to gather, they’re now worth a nice penny or two.",

      "text": "Alibaba's YunOS a Threat to Apple's iOS in China (BABA, AAPL) By Richard Saintvilus | November 28, 2016 — 10:11 AM EST \nYunOS, the mobile operating system developed by Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding Limited ( BABA ), has its sights set on Apple, Inc.'s ( AAPL ) iOS to become second largest mobile operating system in mainland China. \nA report by CNBC Monday noted that YunOS could secure 14% market share of smartphone shipments in China by the end of this year. This would be enough to surpass Apple. Although it was unconfirmed, Alibaba claimed earlier this year that YunOS had already surpassed iOS in China in the three months that ended March 31. (See also: Alibaba's Cloud Set to Take On Microsoft, Amazon .) \nAt Alibaba's cloud computing conference in October, YunOS product director Aiden Yong said, \"We want YunOS to be the 'go-to' operating system for China's smart industry.\" But how significant would that achievement be? Mark Li, senior analyst at Bernstein, downplayed the growth prospects of YunOS, telling the South China Morning Post – a publication owned by Alibaba – that growth prospects for YunOS outside of China would be limited to \"cheap or subsidized smartphones.\" \nCNBC noted that YunOS' top smartphone suppliers include Alibaba-backed Meizu, XiaoLaJiao and Doov. Together, they are projected to help YunOS surpass 100 million units in total smartphone shipments. Bernstein, however, pointed out on Friday that the key motivation for hardware manufacturers to adopt YunOS is the subsidies from Alibaba. Without these subsidies, YunOS would not be as popular. (See also: Alibaba Stock Gets Support From Analysts .) \nBeyond smartphones, Alibaba is also developing YunOS to work for television set-top boxes, smart home appliances, tablets and internet-connected smart TVs, reports CNBC. The company is reportedly giving subsidies from 20 to 60 yuan per set-top box to encourage the adoption of YunOS. \nIn other words, despite the strong strides made by YunOS, surpassing Apple in terms of market share may yield little in terms of profits for Alibaba, given the subsidies. And given the attention Apple pays to its profit margins , Alibaba's subsidy model is not a business Apple would care to compete with. (See also: Apple's 5 Most Profitable Lines of Business .)

      "text": "ACCC denies authorisation to Australian banks over Apple Pay negotiation By Rian Boden   29 November 2016, 09:21 • Last updated 29 November 2016, 09:21 \nThe group of Australian banks seeking better negotiation powers over the arrival of third party mobile wallets have been denied authorisation to do so in a draft determination by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC). The banks sought authorisation to bargain with Apple in particular, wanting access to the NFC technology within the company’s iPhones. \nThe ACCC is “concerned that the proposed conduct could reduce or distort competition in a number of markets” and would “reduce the competitive tension between the banks individually negotiating with Apple, which could reduce competition between the banks in the supply of mobile payment services for iPhones”. \n“There may also be detriments to competition in digital wallets arising from the proposed conduct,” ACCC says. “Authorisation would allow the banks to agree not to sign up to Apple Pay for three years — this is a significant period of uncertainty and would result in decreased choice for consumers whose banks engage in this conduct. \n“The ACCC considers that the conduct could also distort competition between mobile operating systems. Apple’s iOS platform is a differentiated offering that competes globally against other operating systems, such as Android. ‘Distorts competition’ \n“One of the features each system provides to consumers is mobile payment services and digital wallets. To the extent that the proposed conduct leads to an alteration of the offering that Apple is able to make available on the iOS platform, the proposed conduct distorts competition between these operating system providers.” \n“This is currently a finely balanced decision,” says ACCC Chairman Rod Sims. “The ACCC is not currently satisfied that the likely benefits from the proposed conduct outweigh the likely detriments. \n“While the ACCC accepts that the opportunity for the banks to collectively negotiate and boycott would place them in a better bargaining position with Apple, the benefits are currently uncertain and may be limited. Uncertain development \n“However, banks can already offer competing digital wallets on iPhones without direct access to NFC, through their own apps using Apple Pay payment technology or using NFC tags. Banks can also offer digital wallets on the Android platform.” \n“Digital wallets and mobile payments are in their infancy and subject to rapid change,” Sims adds. “In Australia, consumers are used to making tap and go payments with payment cards, which provide a very quick and convenient way to pay. It is therefore uncertain how competition may develop with the availability of mobile payments and possible future innovations.” \nThe ACCC is seeking submissions on its draft determination before making a final decision. \nApple Pay launched in Australia in November 2015 with support from American Express. The company met with resistance from the banks before ANZ became the first of the country’s big four to add support for the service in April 2016. Timeline",

More Subscribe on YouTube\nPieces of Eight\nIt’s Monday, November 28th, and let’s hop right into the latest iPhone 8 new, or news/rumors. According to Business Insider , Apple has more than ten different iPhone 8 test mules on their workbenches. Why so many iPhone 8 prototypes? Well, 2017 marks the 10-year anniversary of the first iPhone, introduced by late Apple co-founder Steve Jobs back in 2007.\nAnd as the smartphone technology race continues to escalate, Apple is finding itself in the unusual position of also-ran as other companies push the pace of innovation with curved 4K screens, bigger batteries, higher-spec cameras and so on. Apple’s iPhone 7 and 7 plus are hot sellers, but more and more, it looks like the iPhone 8 will be a major revamp for the iconic device, with the top-tier phone possibly featuring a curved OLED screen.\nWhatever happens, 2017 will be an interesting year for the smartphone market, as Apple’s competitors will certainly try to one-up a company known to take tech to the next level. And that’s going to be fun for everyone.\nSuddenly, CNN gets a lot more interesting\nYouTube fixture Casey Neistat , that guy that’s always doing crazy stuff while rocking sunglasses and a t-shirt, has an odd new home for his video shenanigans and his social video app: CNN .\nThe app is called Beme (“beam”), and it’s basically a short video sharing app sort of like Vine and such. CNN has bought the app and brought crazy Casey into the fold, where he’ll be the new White House correspondent. OK, no, he won’t, but he will be in-house at CNN doing something that will hopefully bring the network some millennial eyeballs. As for Beam, it’s gotten a recent refresh so maybe check it out.\nDeals over here, deals over there, cyber deals everywhere\nLike we said, it’s Monday, but it’s that special Monday we love known as Cyber Monday, so if you didn’t melt your credit cards down to nothing on Black Friday, then today’s the day to snap up some of the deals you might have missed.\nWe’ve scoured the vast interwebs for the best deals on the hottest tech out there, so hit our buyers guide at this link here.\nCNN taps YouTube sensation Casey Neistat for new media venture aimed at millennials iPhone 7S and iPhone 8 rumors Get the best tech at the lowest prices with our favorite Cyber Monday deals",
