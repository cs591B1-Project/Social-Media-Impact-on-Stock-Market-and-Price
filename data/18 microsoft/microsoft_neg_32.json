      "text": "Read Comments \nMicrosoft has changed the rules of traditional console cycles with Project Scorpio. First revealed at E3, the console features more powerful hardware and 'seamless' software, Scorpio marks a new beginning for Microsoft's role in the gaming space. \nThe Xbox One S , on the other hand, provides an smaller, more incremental upgrade, bringing HDR gaming and 4K entertainment thanks to its 4K Blu-ray player. In a nutshell, it's a smaller, prettier and more efficient Xbox One. \nWatch our Xbox One S video review Xbox Scorpio release date: When can you buy one? \nThe Project Scorpio console will be available in the holiday season of 2017, Microsoft has confirmed. For previous console launches, this has been around November, so barring any delays it’s safe to assume that’s when you’ll be getting your hands on one. \nPhil Spencer recently confirmed via Twitter that both Xbox Scorpio games and hardware are already in production. With the console due out in just over a year, it's hardly surprising, but nonetheless very exciting. Xbox Scorpio: The end of console generations? \nIn an interview with Engadget , Xbox head of games marketing Aaron Greenberg said that the Xbox Scorpio marks the beginning of the end of traditional console life cycles for Microsoft. \n\"We think the future is without console generations,\" Greenberg said. \"we think that the ability to build a library, a community, to be able to iterate with the hardware -- we're making a pretty big bet on that with Project Scorpio. \n\"We're basically saying, 'This isn't a new generation; everything you have continues forward and it works.' We think of this as a family of devices.\" \nGreenberg goes on to say that, is the Scorpio is a success, then it will \"change the way we think about the future of console gaming.\" Xbox Scorpio is VR-capable, but... \nThe Xbox Scorpio is capable of running games in virtual reality, however Xbox boss Phil Spencer is not yet sold on the technology. \nSpeaking to Stevivor , Spencer says that while he's a fan, he doesn't feel the tech or games are quite there yet, and that will affect its availability on Scorpio. \nRelated: PS4 Pro review \n\"I love the technology behind VR. I have a[n HTC] Vive, I have an Oculus [Rift]. I’ve used the PlayStation [VR] device a lot in demos and stuff,\" he said. \n\"I think VR will find its spot in gaming; I would make that bet,” he continued. “We designed Scorpio as a VR-capable console. Whether that happens this year, next year or the year after… like I said, I still think the creative community has to get its arms around what are these new tools, and this new feeling — this new immersion. \n“What experiences do you put in people’s hands to have a long term engagement? Most of these things I’m playing now feel like demos and experiments, which I actually think it’s absolutely the right thing to have happened. That’s not a criticism at all, but should be happening. But I think it will take time.” \nSpencer believes for VR to become a mainstream success, it needs to be wireless. \n\"In the long run, we need untethered solutions. You need to have the compute capability not be wired to my display that’s on my head. That means I either have some kind of high-bandwidth wireless HDMI or I have compute here. With the HoloLens we’ve chosen to put compute in the HMD itself, so it’s right there. The other thing I think most people who look along in this technology is a mixed reality world where I have a head mounted display that’s able to go from a fully enclosed, opaque world that is VR to a fully transparent world where I’m seeing augmentation in my world makes sense. I should have one device that spans both.\" Xbox Scorpio games: Will there be exclusives? \nInitially, Microsoft stated that Scorpio wouldn't have platform exclusives, but that position isn't as clear cut as we first thought. All current Xbox One games will work on the upgraded console, but Microsoft isn't ruling out exclusives. \nSpeaking in an interview , a senior Microsoft spokesperson said it was 'up to developers' to decide if they want to develop games exclusively for Project Scorpio. \n\"I don't know about that. We'll see. It's up to the game development community; what do they want to do,\" said Shannon Loftis, GM of Game Publishing at Microsoft. \nRelated: PS4 Pro vs Xbox Scorpio \nSince the original announcement, CNET published an interview with Xbox's Head of Operations Dave McCarthy, station that Microsoft is looking for a 'seamless' experience for developers, with developers able to work easily across Xbox One, Scorpio and Windows 10. \nMcCarthy has previously said that the Scorpio would 'wipe out' the console upgrade cycle, with games working across platforms. This makes complete sense when you consider that the Xbox Play Anywhere scheme entitles gamers who buy games digitally through Microsoft's own stores to play them on both PC and Xbox One. \nWe can safely assume this approach will also apply to the Scorpio, making it look even more likely that actual hardware upgrade cycles will get much shorter, like that of PC components, but with consumers able to stick with their current console for multiple years before it's gradually phased out. All speculation of course, but a logical step nonetheless. Xbox Scorpio performance: How powerful is Project Scorpio? \nProject Scorpio will have an 8-core CPU from an unknown manufacturer and a graphics card with 6TFLOPs (trillion floating point operations per second) of power. It’ll also have 320GB/s of memory bandwidth. \nIn simple terms, the graphics core will be more than capable of going toe-to-toe with today’s top-end graphics card – comparison, the brand-new Nvidia GeForce GTX 1070 has 6.5TFLOPs of performance. By the time Scorpio launches, it’ll be equivalent of a mid-range PC in 2017, which is how most consoles tend to launch. \nThis is a console made for VR. In the announcement video, Fallout 4 VR was clearly mentioned, as well as the fact that the console would be capable of playing games in 4K resolutions at 60Hz. This makes total sense, as 4K TVs are becoming the standard for buyers looking to invest in high-end equipment. \nPhil Spencer, the head of Xbox at Microsoft, told The Verge that Scorpio will feel like a new generation in terms of graphical fidelity. \n\"I actually think the upgrade to Scorpio in terms of visual fidelity will feel as dramatic of a change as we're used to seeing in new generations,\" said Spencer. \nThis is a bold claim to make, especially since all future games will run on both the Xbox One and Xbox One S. \nBuy Now: Xbox One S with Battlefield 1 at Amazon.com from $299.99 Best Deals for Microsoft Xbox One S \nFollowing the full reveal of the PS4 Pro, Microsoft has gone on a full offensive regarding how Sony's new hardware stacks up with Scorpio. In a recent interview , head of Xbox Albert Penello claimed that the PS4 Pro won't be able to hit native 4K, whereas Xbox Scorpio will. \n\"I think there are a lot of caveats they're giving customers right now around 4K,\" he said. \"They're talking about checkerboard rendering and up-scaling and things like that. There are just a lot of asterisks in their marketing around 4K, which is interesting because when we thought about what spec we wanted for Scorpio, we were very clear we wanted developers to take their Xbox One engines and render them in native, true 4K. \n“That was why we picked the number, that's why we have the memory bandwidth we have, that's why we have the teraflops we have, because it's what we heard from game developers was required to achieve native 4K.” \nIt's clear Microsoft is coming out strong in the battle for console supremacy against Sony, and the new consoles will play a big part in deciding a winner. What about Xbox One? \nMicrosoft has fended off all your questions before you even asked them: Xbox as a platform won’t change. \n“We add to the capabilities of the Xbox One and Xbox family without forcing gamers to abandon all the games and the community they love so much,” the announcement video said. \nThe firm added that accessories and games would continue to work on Scorpio. However, it wasn’t clear whether all new games launched would get both an Xbox One version and a Scorpio version. \nBased on Microsoft’s strategy of making games available for Xbox and Windows 10, it would make sense for the company to continue releasing games for both, essentially creating a mini ecosystem of devices with different specifications for people on different budgets. \nRelated: Xbox One S vs Xbox One: What's the difference? Xbox Scorpio price: How much will Project Scorpio cost? \nNothing has been announced so far. The console is so far away it’s hard to predict, but considering the specifications and assuming Microsoft will sell it with narrow profit margins, we’re looking at a console costing in the region of £500 or around $600. \nSpeaking on Twitter, Phil Spencer has said Project Scorpio is making \"amazing progress\" at Microsoft. \n\"There is a lot of time to go, but we feel good about how the things are coming together,\" he said. \"The teams understand the performance spec that we're building. We went through some of the high-level specs at E3 in the video. And it gives the teams time to make sure that they're targeting that performance for their games. Luckily so many of both our internal teams and partners are also building on PC,\" Spencer explained. \nIf this optimistic schedule continues, we may see Scorpio sooner rather than later. Xbox Scorpio – How has Sony responded? \nThe most interesting fallout of Microsoft's bold new direction for console gaming has been how Sony has responded. Following the PlayStation Meeting, both company's cards are now on the table, and it's clear Sony is taking a different tact to its biggest rivals. With the unveiling of the PS4 Pro, a more powerful console than the PS4, but one which pales in comparison to the Scorpio, Sony is looking to offer what it considers to be the pinnacle of the current console generation. However, it is not looking to blur the lines between generations. \nOne phrase consistently used by lead system architect Mark Cerny was this: \"PS4 Pro is not the start of a new console generation, nor is it a console that is going to blur the lines between generations\". This is interesting, as the phrasing use shows a clear demarcation from the Microsoft strategy. But as things stand, the Scorpio is set to be the most powerful console on the market by the end of 2017. Will Sony respond with a third console refresh? We don't know, but it's a very interesting time for gaming. \nDid we miss anything out? Let us know in the comments. Latest Deals From Ebay",

      "text": "By Himanshu Goenka @HimGoJourno On 11/22/16 AT 5:18 AM Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella speaks at a live Microsoft event in the Manhattan borough of New York City, Oct. 26, 2016. Photo: REUTERS/Lucas Jackson \nMicrosoft Corp. made itself a household name with personal computers and the ubiquitous Windows operating systems that came with them. And after being at the forefront of the development of digital computing (bugs notwithstanding) for about three decades, the technology giant is now trying to push a new frontier — quantum computing. \nIn a blog post Sunday, the company said it “is doubling down on its commitment to the tantalizing field of quantum computing, making a strong bet that it is possible to create a scalable quantum computer using what is called a topological qubit.” \nQubit is the quantum counterpart of a digital bit, which is the building block of modern computers used to store and process data. Bits are expressed in binary and exist as either 0 or 1. Qubits, on the other hand, can exist as 0 and 1 simultaneously, allowing for processing information at speeds orders of magnitude faster than classic computing. \nTodd Holmdahl, corporate vice president of Microsoft’s quantum program, said in the blog post the years of research by the company has created a “clear roadmap” for a scalable quantum computer. “I think we’re at an inflection point in which we are ready to go from research to engineering,” he said. \nThe research is necessary because qubits are difficult to manage, since quantum systems they are part of are unstable and collapse when disturbed by heat or electric charge. Therefore, quantum computers need to be built in really cold and sterile environments. According to Holmdahl, “a topological design is less impacted by changes in its environment.” Related Stories ‘Artificial Atom’ In Graphene Holds Promise \nThe company is working not only on quantum computing hardware, but also software that will run on those machines to create systems that can solve highly complex problems. It has already hired some of the world’s leading figures in the field, and some more are coming aboard soon. \nThe vast processing power that quantum computers could unleash has applications in many fields. Such computers could emulate entire physical systems, and increase our understanding of various complex phenomenon manifolds. \n“There is a real opportunity to apply these computers to things that I’ll call material sciences of physical systems. A lot of these problems are intractable on a classical computer, but on a quantum computer we believe that they are tractable in a reasonable period of time,” Holmdahl said.

      "text": "Tweet \nEarlier today, Microsoft sent out a promotional email for Dead Rising 4. The pitch was some zombies singing Christmas Carols, and the email had the subject line \"NNNNGGGHHHAAAA\". \nThe intent was obviously to put into text the kind of noise a zombie makes, but when you arrange those letters together and say them out loud, you get something... else. \nNobody is saying Microsoft did this intentionally. It's just a dumb/unfortunate combination of letters, something company PR man Larry Hryb acknowledged on Twitter: Today we sent a DR4 email where a zombie roar was interpreted by many as a racial slur. We apologize and promise to do better next time. \n— / Larry Hryb / + 1m (@majornelson) November 22, 2016 \nI do not recommend reading the replies to that Tweet. \nGoing forwards, Xbox email team, may I propose the following zombie sound effects that do not share pronunciation with a racially-charged term: \n",

Furthermore, Microsoft uses these ads to downplay Google Chrome, explaining that Edge browser is a much faster and more secure option that Google’s. Microsoft has been saying the same thing for many months, as it’s investing massively in Edge browser, but adoption of the new app continues to be below expectations, mostly because of its limited availability. Microsoft Edge is exclusively available in Windows 10, and Redmond has no plans to launch it on any other Windows version or on a non-Windows operating system, be it desktop or mobile.

      "text": "Reddit \nIt’s hard to deny the effect that Microsoft’s Surface Pro tablets have had on the computing landscape. Despite a rocky start, the “tablet that can replace your laptop” has created a new category that now everyone is trying to emulate or compete with, including, to some extent, Apple. There is, however, always room for something better, which is what Finnish startup Eve Tech is proposing with the Eve V. And, unlike Microsoft, the Eve V was designed right from the start with consumers on the co-pilot seat. \nThere is no shortage of Surface Pro rivals, and even clones, but how many of those involved consumers and potential buyers in the development of the device. Given the business risks and complicated processes, none. Except the Eve V. The company actually crowdsourced the feature list for this portable computer, with the specs finalized just a few days ago. And it’s a list that would make computer users, especially tablet believers, drool. \n• CPU: Intel 7th gen Core m3 or i5 or i7 • RAM: 8 or 16 GB LPDDR3 • Storage: 128 or 256 or 512 GB SSD • Dispaly: 12.3-inch 2736×1824 IGZO LCD • Battery: 48 Wh, 12 hours • Connectivity: 2×2 MU-MIMO, Bluetooth 4.2 • Ports: 1x Thunderbolt 3, 1x USB-C, 2x USB 3.1, 1x 3.5 mm audio • Sensors: Fingerprint, Hall, Gravity, Gyro, Light • Accessories: Wired and wireless backlit keyboard, N-Trig V Pen with1,024 levels of pressure \nShort of Microsoft coming out with a Surface Pro 5, this easily outranks the current Surface Pro 4 titleholder. And that’s just in the raw specs of the tablet. Other features, like an iPad Pro-esque quad speaker setup, fingerprint scanner on the tablet itself, not the detachable keyboard, zero bloatware Windows 10 installation, and that popular Scandinavian design, make the Eve V an even more compelling buy. \nWell, not exactly buy, as the Eve V is still at Indiegogo. Given the support it received during the crowdsourcing stage, it’s really no surprise that the campaign already raised 7 times its $75,000 goal in just a day. And that’s thanks to yet another unique thing about this campaign. \nEve V’s Indiegogo run is using a reservation system so that you won’t have to pay the full price of the device in one go. You can “reserve” or lock down a slot for a third of the full amount. The remaining balance will be charged in January when Eve Tech starts purchasing the components for production. Before then, backers can still back out and refund their full pledge.",

      "text": "Apple launched the new MacBook last month with a Touch Bar that provides users with a unique input method, but it appears that Microsoft itself was this close to bringing in production its very version of a keyboard with a secondary screen. A patent spotted by MSPU shows that Microsoft designed a technology that allowed a keyboard to be fitted with a secondary screen which could have played several roles, including offering text suggestions to improve typing in a way that’s similar to smartphones. Called “Keyboard with input-sensitive display device,” this patent was filed on July 25, 2016, but this doesn’t necessarily mean that Microsoft thought of it fir...",

There’s now a new Windows Defender Hub available to download in the Windows Store. \nWindows Defender Hub basically provides you with an easy way to open Windows Defender (click the button and the front end for the software will appear immediately), and in addition to that the Hub provides security tips, information on how to get the most from Windows Defender, and security news. \nClick on any story, and it will open directly in the Hub -- rather than opening a page in your browser. \nIt’s a little disappointing that you can’t do more with the Hub, such as configure Windows Defender settings, but maybe this will come in a future update.",

      "text": "$299 Microsoft Windows 10 VR Headset Low Minimum PC Requirements Announced 10:51 am By Julian Horsey \nNext month Microsoft is expected to release more details about its upcoming new virtual reality headsets which the company has been designing for its Windows 10 operating system and are expected to be priced from $299 upwards. \nThis week Microsoft has revealed details about the minimum specifications your PC will require to be able to enjoy the virtual reality experience provided by the Microsoft VR headset. Luckily they are pretty low and will allow most PC systems to engage in a little VR support. \nMicrosoft says that your PC will require a minimum of a : \n• Quad-core processor • At least 4GB of RAM • Graphics card with support for DirectX 12 • USB 3.0 \nObviously you will also need a certain amount of disk space to install the Microsoft virtual reality software to be able to use the VR headset, but at the current time Microsoft has not unveiled any specific details. The new Microsoft virtual reality application is included in the Windows 10 Insider Preview Build 14971, and Windows 10 Holographic can be tested before the launch of the Microsoft VR headsets by attaching an Oculus Rift, HTC Vive, or another VR headset if you fancy giving it a whirl.",

      "text": "Microsoft\nAt an event to announce its feature-packed Creators Update for Windows 10, Microsoft revealed that it’s working with hardware makers to release PC-tethered VR headsets that’ll start at $299 – a lot cheaper than existing options like the Oculus Rift and HTC Vive.\nThe trouble with the current generation of headsets is that they not only cost a lot on their own, but also require high-end PCs to VR experiences on them – raising the price of admission to at least $1,500. The Verge reports that Microsoft’s cheaper offerings won’t be all that demanding.\nIt noted that a “Windows Holographic First Run” app for testing compatibility with Microsoft’s upcoming VR platform is included in the latest test builds of Windows 10, and it revealed the minimum hardware requirements for VR experiences:\n4GB of RAM USB 3.0 port A graphics card with DirectX 12 support 4 CPU cores, including dual-core processors with hyperthreading That’s not scary at all, and it should be possible for most folks with modest PCs to give VR a try. Of course, we’ll have to wait and see what sort of apps run on such machines.\nPlus, Alex Kipman, who heads the HoloLens project at Microsoft, said that the upcoming range of VR headsets will offer different classes of experiences across numerous price points. He explained, “There is a difference if you want to play Halo or you want to play Solitaire. The entry to play anything was a $1,500 PC; that’s what we lowered.”\nMicrosoft is also expected to share more information about how the headsets will work next month , when it hosts a couple of Windows Hardware Engineering Community (WinHEC) events – the first will be in Shenzen, China, on December 8-9; the second will be in Taipei, Taiwan from December 14-15.\nRead the original article on The Next Web .

      "title": "No, You Don't Need A PC Powerhouse To Use Microsoft's $300 Windows 10 VR Headsets: Minimum System Requirements Revealed",
      "text": "Microsoft's Windows 10 VR headsets and platform won't need a high-end PC to work, and according to the minimum system requirements, you only need a midrange computer. ( Microsoft ) Advertisement \nMicrosoft has revealed the minimum system requirements to run VR experiences on Windows 10 by way of the Windows Holographic First Run application, which came with the recently released Insider Preview build 14971. \nThat said, everyone now has a better idea of what the Redmond company has in store aside from the VR headsets starting at $300 — and that a slew of different brands from Acer to Lenovo will manufacture them — and support for the Windows Holographic VR platform arriving via the Windows 10 Creators Update next year. Windows Holographic First Run Shows That Modest Computers Can Handle Windows 10 VR \nFirst reported by Tom Warren of The Verge, the minimum system requirements include 4 GB worth of RAM, a graphics card that supports DirectX 12, a USB 3.0 port and four CPU cores, which a dual-core processor with hyper threading can take the place of. \nMicrosoft will likely give out the exact details in the foreseeable future, including the CPU and GPU speeds. \nAt any rate, that means practically anyone with a midrange PC and at least $300 to spare for a headset can jump right on the VR bandwagon without burning a hole through their pockets. \nHowever, the problem is, it's still unclear what kind of apps and games can be developed following that low level of processing power. \nAlso, take note that meeting the minimum system requirements doesn't necessarily equal to a fluid experience, as it's just the baseline to run the platform. A Short Comparison With The Oculus Rift And The HTC Vive \nIt's no mystery that the Oculus Rift and the HTC Vive can deliver great and detailed VR experiences, and needless to say, their minimum system requirements are on a different level compared with what Microsoft is bringing to the table. \nOn that note, users will need at least an Intel Core i5 4590 or AMD FX 8350 and an Nvidia GeForce GTX 970 or AMD Radeon R9 290. \nWhile the Oculus Rift requires 8 GB of RAM and two USB 3.0 ports, the HTC Vive only needs 4 GB of RAM and one USB 2.0 port. \nHowever, it should be pointed out that Oculus recently rolled out Asynchronous Spacewarp, a technology that lets the VR headset compatible with more affordable rigs, making it work with a GTX 1060 or any AMD RX 400 series GPU and a Core i3 chip. Wrapping Up The Windows 10 VR \nThe low specifications needed to support Microsoft's Windows 10 VR platform are a good way for enthusiasts on a budget to step into the VR scene, and even though there still aren't that many details yet, the company is expected to provide more info at an event in December.

Microsoft has come out to reveal that the rumor is baseless. Project Scorpio will create Xbox Scorpio that will continue along with the other current consoles from the company. Spencer assured the players that the Xbox One would exist with the latest Xbox Scorpio. \nThe accessories of Xbox One will also support the Xbox Scorpio. The different gaming titles that work on Xbox One will work on Xbox Scorpio and vice versa. The backward compatibility of the high-end console will surely make a difference to the market performance of Xbox Scorpio. \nGiven the high price of Xbox Scorpio, the gamers are trying to figure out if the console would be worth the money. According to Christian Today, marketing head of Xbox, Aaron Greenberg spoke about some of the specs that gamers can expect in Xbox Scorpio during the Xbox FanFest. \nThe console will be one of the most powerful gaming consoles in the market. Greenberg said that the Xbox One would provide gamers with the 4K experience along with some amazing visuals. The visuals in Xbox Scorpio will be better than anything that the players have seen previously. \nAccording to rumors, Xbox Scorpio will also have the octa-core processor with 6TFLOPS along with a 230 GB internal memory. Apart from 4K resolution and excellent graphics, the Xbox Scorpio will also come with VR and HDR game support. \nMobile & Apps reported that Xbox Scorpio would also have 8 CPU cores along with a memory bandwidth of 320 GB/s.

Noise Get updates Get updates Blocked Unblock Follow Following Creator of Ruby on Rails, Founder & CTO at Basecamp (formerly 37signals), NYT Best-selling author of REWORK and REMOTE, and Le Mans class-winning racing driver. 2 hrs ago Microsoft reboots war on sleep A few years ago, Microsoft launched a Office 365 campaign with the slogan of #GetItDone. The basic premise was fitting more work into more places of your life. Well, not so much just fitting as shoving, cramming, and crunching it into every damn nook and cranny of your existence. Like, why shouldn’t you check up on that Excel spreadsheet with the latest TPS numbers from the bathroom? Or take that conference call from your kid’s soccer game? Or fake presence with your spouse reviewing Word revisions while watch a show “together”? Seriously. I’m not making these scenarios up. Microsoft’s campaign included all of them, complete with stats to alleviate the guilt of living such a shackled life. See, everyone is doing it! And Microsoft 365 makes it easier!! Fuck. That. Shit. We tried to push back against Microsoft’s #GetItDone back in 2013 with #WorkCanWait . That lead to a whole series of features in Basecamp 3 to encourage the exact opposite of what Microsoft wanted the future of work to look like. Basecamp 3 has a literal feature called Work Can Wait , which ensures that work stays out of your kid’s soccer game or your family’s movie night. Anyway, that was then. I kinda thought Microsoft would have wised up since. In 2013, you could at least excuse the company somewhat since the dancing buffoon was still in charge. But in 2016? No. No, you cannot excuse that any more. So watch this: Oh yeah, that’s just Microsoft putting a chipper fucking jingle to an ideal of work that’s literally presented as “14 hour days, 7 days a week, for decades”. Say what now? In what alternate universe is that an ideal you want to endorse? Maybe that’s what the new Surface is all about. Perfect for sweatshops like Marvel to churn out yet another superhero rehash. Just so everyone else who’s working death shift after death shift for decades can escape the hell that is their life in make-believe fantasy. Swell. But hey, THIS IS THE FUTURE OF WORK, right? The Surface Pro 4 is just here to enable the inevitable transition to this glorious paradise of productivity. Your life: 14 hours a day, 7 days a week, running Microsoft gear. Wouldn’t you want this too? Isn’t this aspirational? No. It’s death. Sleep is good . Sleep works . Fuck companies and products that endorse skimping or skipping it as some kind of superpower. Fuck the Surface Pro 4’s marketing team. I seriously hope that this is just Microsoft temporarily slipping up, not a trend worthy of retracting forgiveness for. ",

      "text": "Microsoft Also Considered a Keyboard with a Screen Like Apple’s Touch Bar GO Patent shows Redmond had this in mind earlier this year Nov 22, 2016 11:00 GMT · By Bogdan Popa · Share: Apple launched the new MacBook last month with a Touch Bar that provides users with a unique input method, but it appears that Microsoft itself was this close to bringing in production its very version of a keyboard with a secondary screen. A patent spotted by MSPU shows that Microsoft designed a technology that allowed a keyboard to be fitted with a secondary screen which could have played several roles, including offering text suggestions to improve typing in a way that’s similar to smartphones. Called “ Keyboard with input-sensitive display device ,” this patent was filed on July 25, 2016, but this doesn’t necessarily mean that Microsoft thought of it first. Apple only launched the Touch Bar-equipped MacBook Pro last month, but the company was most likely working on it since the last year, as planning and development usually take quite a lot of time. How text correction could work In the summary section of the patent, Microsoft explains the way its keyboard equipped with a secondary screen could have worked: “Other aspects of the invention involve a method for input correction. The method includes displaying, on a secondary display, a first text unit, such as a character or a word, which corresponds with a second text unit shown on a primary display screen of a computing device. The method further involves receiving user selection of the first text unit and replacing the second text unit with the first text unit. The secondary display may include a touch sensitive display screen and the step of receiving the user selection of the first text unit may include sensing the user touching the touch sensitive display screen.” As you can see in the drawing, however, the keyboard wasn’t necessarily build to be used on laptops, but more on desktop computers, so there’s still a chance to see it in production at some point in the future. Of course, there’s no doubt that if Redmond ever launches such a product, it’s probably just a matter of time until someone accuses Microsoft of copying Apple’s idea, and this doesn’t align with its strategy of “inventing new product categories.” ",

      "text": "Microsoft Claims Edge Is Faster and More Secure than Google Chrome in New Ads GO Redmond rolls out new Microsoft Edge browser ads Nov 22, 2016 10:24 GMT · By Bogdan Popa · Share: Microsoft has just published two new Edge browser ads in order to highlight some of the features of its app, including performance security. Furthermore, Microsoft uses these ads to downplay Google Chrome, explaining that Edge browser is a much faster and more secure option that Google’s. Microsoft has been saying the same thing for many months, as it’s investing massively in Edge browser, but adoption of the new app continues to be below expectations, mostly because of its limited availability. Microsoft Edge is exclusively available in Windows 10, and Redmond has no plans to launch it on any other Windows version or on a non-Windows operating system, be it desktop or mobile. Chrome running on more than 50 percent of the desktops worldwide Third-party statistics show that Microsoft Edge currently has a market share of nearly 5 percent, while Google Chrome tops the charts with more than 50 percent. This means that 1 in 2 PCs is running Google Chrome, regardless of the operating system. Microsoft, on the other hand, promises to make Edge a truly powerful alternative to third-party browsers and looks at Google Chrome as the main rival, for one reason or another. The firm barely mentions Firefox in its ads or benchmarks, even though Mozilla’s browser also has more users than Microsoft Edge. Edge itself received major updates earlier this year with the debut of the Windows 10 Anniversary Update, including support for extensions. Furthermore, the software giant promised to continue working on Edge in the coming OS updates, and the next important milestone is the arrival of the Windows 10 Creators Update due in March 2017. Of course, it’ll take longer to see Microsoft Edge becoming a rival to Google Chrome, especially given the market shares of the two, but Redmond is very confident that more users will discover the benefits of its Windows 10 browsers thanks to its marketing push, such as today’s ads.",

      "text": "Microsoft’s Boss Pokes Fun at Apple’s “Converged Refrigerators and Toasters” GO Nadella proud that Apple copied Microsoft’s Surface 2-in-1 Nov 22, 2016 09:45 GMT · By Bogdan Popa · Share: ​ Apple was one of the companies that laughed at Microsoft’s investments in the Surface lineup from the very beginning, with CEO Tim Cook himself poking fun at the idea of mixing tablets and keyboards. And now, the iPhone maker itself is focusing on 2-in-1 devices with the iPad Pro, which gives Microsoft the opportunity of goofing on its rival for copying a strategy that it didn’t believe it can work. Microsoft’s CEO Satya Nadella is the latest high-profile Redmond executive who did that, as the Steve Ballmer successor talked about the success of the Surface in an interview with AFR . “Three years ago, the two-in-one as a form factor was questioned,” he said. “Does anybody need one? And now guess what, even our competition has decided that it's not a refrigerator and a toaster, but it's actually a two-in-one.” The Surface success Truth be told, the Surface series has become very successful these days, acting as a catalyst for the Redmond software giant to continue investing in products that “invent new categories,” as the firm’s executives said on several occasions. In this context, Tim Cook’s statement that “you can converge a toaster and a refrigerator, but those things are probably not going be pleasing to the user” doesn’t make much sense and only gives Microsoft the chance to remind everyone that it’s the actual inventor of the 2-in-1 category that even Apple believes in these days. The battle between the two companies doesn’t seem to extend to laptops and desktops, or at least not for the time being. While Microsoft is investing at a fast pace in touch-capable laptops and all-in-one PCs, Apple prefers to stick with a traditional approach, explaining that mice and keyboards need to remain the main input method for everyone working with such devices. Microsoft is very sure that more partners would embrace its latest ideas, so nobody in Redmond would be too surprised to see Apple itself launching an iMac with a touchscreen.",

      "text": "Microsoft CEO Says Windows Phones Will Be “Ultimate Mobile Devices” GO Satya Nadella hints at innovative smartphone coming Nov 22, 2016 08:14 GMT · By Bogdan Popa · Share: Microsoft itself admitted that it failed in the mobile business, but the firm is still not willing to give up on phones entirely and is still looking into ways to innovate in this side of the market. Inventing new product categories seems to be Microsoft’s new thing after the Surface and the Surface Studio, and now the company is trying to do the same thing with Windows phones. In an interview with the Australian Financial Review , Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella emphasized that the software giant doesn’t want Windows phones to be similar to Android devices and iPhones, but to come with unique features that align with its new strategy. “We don’t want to be driven by just envy of what others have,” he said. “The question is, what can we bring? That’s where I look at any device form factor or any technology, even AI.” Here comes the Surface Phone Nadella went to explain that he wants Windows phones to be “ultimate mobile devices,” hinting that something big is indeed in the works at Microsoft. “We will continue to be in the phone market not as defined by today’s market leaders, but by what it is that we can uniquely do in what is the most ultimate mobile device,” he continued, “Therefore [with Nokia assets], we stopped doing things that were me-too and started doing things, even if they are today very sub-scale, to be very focused on a specific set of customers who need a specific set of capabilities that are differentiated and that we can do a good job of.” The secret feature that could help Microsoft at least get closer to the idea of an ultimate mobile device is the possibility of running x86 apps on smartphones, a feature that the company seems to be working on right now. Microsoft is believed to be developing an emulator that would launch in Windows 10 Redstone 3 and which would allow x86 apps to run on ARM processors that are available on Windows phones . This could coincide with the release of the Surface Phone, which according to people familiar with the matter might take place in the fall of 2017 as well, just like the Redstone 3 update.",

      "text": "2 downloads File size: 1.7 MB Manufacturer: Microsoft Added on: November 22nd, 2016 The package provides the installation files for Microsoft Surface UEFI Driver version 90.1380.768.0. If the driver is already installed on your system,   various issues,   just upgrade to the available version. Take into consideration that is not recommended to install the driver on Operating Systems other than stated ones. In order to manually update your driver, follow the steps below (the next steps): 1. Extract the .cab file to a folder of your choice 2. Go to Device Manager (right click on My Computer, choose Manage and then find Device Manager in the left panel), or right click on Start Menu for Windows 10 and select Device Manager 3. Right click on the hardware device you wish to update and choose Update Driver Software 4. Choose to select the location of the new driver manually and browse to the folder where you extracted the driver 5. If you already have the driver installed and want to update to a newer version got to \"Let me pick from a list of device drivers on my computer\" 6. Click \"Have Disk\" 7. Browse to the folder where you extracted the driver and click Ok About USB Driver: When tablets, e-readers or similar devices are connected, Windows platforms usually apply a generic driver that allows the system to recognize the device, exchange files, and make use of basic functions. Still, to use the full range of features available, proper USB drivers must be installed. The installation procedure shouldn’t be much of a hassle since each manufacturer intends to make it as easy as possible. So all you have to do is make sure that the current version is compatible with the product(s) you own, such as computer OS, tablet model, USB technology, run the setup, and follow the instructions displayed on-screen. Bear in mind that, even if other OS might be suitable, we do not recommend that you apply this release on platforms other than the highlighted ones. Also, after the installation is complete, you should perform a system reboot so that all changes take effect properly. That being said, click the download button, get the package and apply it on your system. In addition to that, check our website constantly to stay “updated one minute ago.”",

We apologize and promise to do better next time. \n— / Larry Hryb / + 1m (@majornelson) November 22, 2016 \nFellow members of the Twitterverse quickly flocked to complain about today’s overly sensitive culture: @ANTxDAxRULER @majornelson @aarongreenberg Lol when I saw it I did a double take: “Nnngggaaahh” \nI was like ‘What did that zombie call me??”",

      "text": "Digital Trends ^ | 11/21/16 | Mark Coppock \nPosted on 11/22/2016 4:21:17 AM PST by LibWhacker \nMany companies and researchers are investigating quantum computing as one of the next major steps in the evolution of computers. The spooky effects of quantum physics, it is hoped, will enable the creation of computers that operate on certain tasks at unprecedented levels of performance. \nMicrosoft is one of those companies, and it has been looking at quantum computing for some time now. Today, however, the company is taking the next step of actively investing in the creation of a real, scaleable quantum computer that can be used to tackle real-world problems, as the company outlines on the official Microsoft blog. \nMore: MITs newest quantum computer puts us one step closer to defeating modern encryption \nAs Microsoft executive Todd Holmdahl puts it, I think were at an inflection point in which we are ready to go from research to engineering. The executive has some experience within Microsoft of bringing pie-in-the-sky projects to the market, having been involved in the development of the Xbox, Kinect, and the HoloLens  all projects that started out as mere research projects and made it all the way to consumer products. \nMicrosoft will be drawing on the skills and knowledge of two prominent quantum computing researchers in moving the initiative outside of the lab and into a real product. Charles Marcus is Villum Kann Rasmussen Professor at the Niels Bohr Institute at the University of Copenhagen and also serves as director of the Danish National Research Foundation-sponsored Center for Quantum Devices. Joining him at the center of Microsofts efforts is Leo Kouwenhoven, distinguished professor at Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands and founding director of QuTech, the Advanced Research Center on Quantum Technologies. \nBoth researchers have been working with Microsoft on their quantum computing tech for some time, and now the company is funding more work on basic research in the lab. Both scientists will retain their titles and affiliations after joining Microsoft and will continue working with their respective teams. At the heart of their efforts will be the ultimate goal of bringing a quantum computer into the real world. \nAccording to Marcus, I knew that to get over the hump and get to the point where you started to be able to create machines that have never existed before, it was necessary to change the way we did business. We need scientists, engineers of all sorts, technicians, programmers, all working on the same team. \nMore: Researchers in Australia develop more stable qubits for quantum computers \nMicrosoft hasnt announced any firm plans to deploy a product, but its focus will be on the type of qubit, which stands for a unit of quantum information, call the topological cubit. Qubits are used as the key building blocks in a quantum computer, and could allow them to determine multiple solutions to a problem at once, in contrast to todays sequential computers. \nThe company will have a number of obstacles to overcome in building a quantum computer. For example, the devices will require incredibly cold and static environments to avoid external influence on the systems quantum state, as that will disturb the state and disrupt processing. According to Microsoft, qubits are less susceptible to heat and electrical noise, meaning they can be used to maintain quantum states for longer periods of time. \nClearly, the challenge will be a significant one. At the end, however, will be the creation of a quantum computer that can dramatically reduce the time to develop new drugs and study biological processes, to take two examples. A quantum-powered intelligent cloud would exceed existing computers in power in the same way that the smartphone exceeds the first cell phones. Holmdahl expanded on the opportunity, saying, There is a real opportunity to apply these computers to things that Ill call material sciences of physical systems. A lot of these problems are intractable on a classical computer, but on a quantum computer we believe that they are tractable in a reasonable period of time. \nOne day, a quantum computer might help delve into the secrets of quantum physics itself. Its conceivable that questions about dark matter and other mysteries of the universe might one day be solved on a Microsoft quantum computer running the companys own specialized software.",

      "text": "  07:00 AM EST D-Link to partner with Microsoft to bring 'Super Wi-Fi' to developing regions \nD-Link joins a force to provide wireless infrastructure to world's underserved regions \nMISSISSAUGA, ON , Nov. 22, 2016 /CNW/ - D-Link, Canada's leader in home networking, will partner with Microsoft in a landmark project aiming to deliver the next generation of Wi-Fi, known as \"Super Wi-Fi,\" to rural communities across the globe, announced D-Link Chairman John Hsuan as part of his D-Link Future Strategy during a press conference at the company's Taipei headquarters on Monday. \nBy aiming to tackle some of the world's greatest technology gaps, and laying down a future network in currently underdeveloped areas, the Microsoft-led mission would give communities a foundation for an enriched digital future. \nA first-phase pilot is commencing in a US state, with a further three potential countries for future stages, and is the culmination of years of research and development already invested by Microsoft and partners. \n\"Microsoft was founded on the idea of democratizing access to technology. Microsoft's current mission is to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more. For that reason, Microsoft is working with public and private sector partners around the world to develop technologies and business models that will make it easier for billions more people to affordably get online. In furtherance of these goals, Microsoft is excited to be working with D-Link on developing Super Wi-Fi technologies and an ecosystem leveraging lower-frequency TV white spaces,\" said Paul Garnett , Director of Affordable Access Initiatives, Microsoft. \nD-Link Canada President, Lou Reda , said that the company is excited to be collaborating toward the goal of connecting more of the world well into the future. \n\"We are very excited to be part of this initiative with Microsoft\", said Mr. Reda. \"Our goal as a company is to help all people better connect, locally and globally. Leveraging our 30 years of expertise and global footprint to help deliver Super Wi-Fi to the world's underdeveloped regions is a huge step in accomplishing this goal.\" \nCurrently, the fastest commercial Wi-Fi standards are based on the 802.11ac prototype, with \"11ad\" announced by some manufacturers. Super Wi-Fi is set to be based on \"11af,\" representing a protocol with a huge leap in range. \nThe Super Wi-Fi campaign aims to exploit unused bandwidth in the lower-frequency white spaces between television channel frequencies, where signal travels further than at higher frequencies. \nAbout D-Link \nCelebrating its 30th anniversary in 2016, D-Link is a global leader in connecting people, businesses and cities. We aim to connect more homes, small businesses, medium to large-sized enterprises, and service providers. D-Link implements and supports unified network solutions that integrate capabilities in switching, wireless, broadband, storage, IP surveillance, and cloud-based network management.

      "text": "Microsoft Offers EU Concessions over Outlook Access November 22, 2016, 07:32:  By Natalia Drozdiak \nBRUSSELS--In a bid to win European Union antitrust approval of its $26 billion acquisition of LinkedIn Corp., Microsoft has proposed concessions that would allow rival professional social networks access to its Outlook programs, according to people familiar with the matter. \nMicrosoft has offered to allow other professional social networks access to its Outlook add-in program and Outlook APIs (or application programming interface, which allow various programs to communicate with one another) following its merger with LinkedIn, the people said. Some of the rival networks already have access to those Outlook programs, they added. \nIn addition, Microsoft has pledged to allow manufacturers such as Dell Inc. and Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co. to disable the LinkedIn shortcut on desktop devices, the people said. An EU antitrust decision in 2004 condemned Microsoft for bundling products into its Windows software. \nNone of the remedies, however, would offer rivals direct access to LinkedIn's pool of data--a condition Salesforce.com Inc., which lost to Microsoft in its bid for LinkedIn, has publicly pressed for. However, no outside entity currently has unlimited access to LinkedIn's data trove, people familiar with the matter have said. \nThe European Commission, the bloc's antitrust regulator, has sought comment from rivals after Microsoft submitted the remedies last week. \nThe EU's current deadline to complete the review is set for Dec. 6 but that could be extended if the regulator still has concerns about the deal and decides to open an in-depth investigation. \nThe EU's antitrust authority, which has said it would scrutinize mergers involving large amounts of data more closely, sent out questionnaires to rivals in October posing questions about the rough value of LinkedIn's data and whether rival sites can replicate it. \nMicrosoft has argued that much of the user data on LinkedIn is also found on other social-networking sites, including Facebook Inc., which should therefore also be considered as part of the same market in the EU's review process. \nWrite to Natalia Drozdiak at natalia.drozdiak@wsj.com  160732ET  ",

In the contrite, the Windows-maker clarified the email wasn’t intended to be offensive, but also took a chance to acknowledge it could’ve phrased the subject line differently to avoid the issue altogether.

      "text": "EXCLUSIVE: \nMetacert has raised $1.2 million for its messaging app security and bot solutions, the company told VentureBeat.\nThe Metacert Security Bot detects malware, phishing, and pornography in direct messages and Slack channels and works on Slack, Hipchat, and soon Skype, Microsoft Teams, and Facebook Messenger, Metacert cofounder Paul Walsh told VentureBeat in a Skype interview.\n“The problem is that phishing is typically thought of as a problem in email…But if a lot of people are using [messaging] instead of email, then it stands to reason that the future of malware and phishing attacks is also going to take place inside these messaging services, and that’s why Metacert exists,” Walsh said.\nOn Hipchat, the person who administers the bot can choose to block specific links beyond the more than 700 million Security bot already blocks. Each URL added on Hipchat is only blocked for that specific company.\n\nIn addition to security, the bot has an analytics dashboard that lists all links and files shared on enterprise chat platforms and places each link into one of 60 categories, info that can be useful for reasons that go beyond security.\n“This is good for two reasons: one for security compliance, and then, secondly, it’s useful if you just want to go back and [you] think ‘Hey I know that Sheila actually posted this link but I don’t know where the link is or what it’s called’. It gives you some high-level user statistics at the top, and we find that pretty much every customer that gets security also opts for this,” he said.\nSlack lists Security bot as part of the Brilliant Bot section of the Slack App Directory .\nMetacert is primarily focused on security but is also maker of bCRM , a marketing management bot to send messages to Slack users and Facebook page fans. Developer.metacert.com allows any developer to add security to their app to protect users from malicious links.\nSince 2012, Metacert has provided a Chrome extension and iPad web browser for web browsing free of malicious content or pornography.\n“We started building security integrations into bots two years ago, and we started with HipChat,” Walsh said. “We see a world where you’re not afraid of opening the wrong link. In that context, we built the world’s most advanced content classification platform so that we can protect companies and users from malicious links that appear inside applications. And we are focused now primarily on messaging service applications.”\nThe $1.2 million round was led by Moneta Ventures, with participation from Shaked Ventures, Sierra Angel Network, and Monta Vista Capital.\nSign up for Funding Daily : Get the latest news in your inbox every weekday.

      "text": "By Andy Weir Senior News Editor Neowin LLC @gcaweir · 8 minutes ago with 1 comment \nEarlier this month, European antitrust regulators voiced their concerns to Microsoft over its $26.2 billion of professional networking platform LinkedIn , which it announced in June. The European Commission said last week that Microsoft had responded to those concerns by proposing 'concessions' , the first details of which have now emerged. \nA deal as large as this one requires approval from regulators, who must assess its potential impact upon rivals and the wider market, but the EU has not yet ruled on the LinkedIn acquisition. \nAccording to Reuters , Microsoft is hoping to gain that approval by assuring the European Commission of the following: Microsoft will continue to provide rivals with access to key APIs after the acquisition, ensuring that functionality currently available to those companies will not be removed Device manufacturers will be able to pre-install LinkedIn on their devices, rather than restricting LinkedIn availability to Microsoft's own devices Manufacturers will also be free to pre-install rival professional/social networking apps on their devices \nThe proposed concessions are an attempt to demonstrate that Microsoft won't use the acquisition to try to stifle competition, or to 'punish' partners who choose to favor rival networks over its own offering. \nMicrosoft's competitors have until today to provide feedback, or to raise any objections, regarding the acquisition. Salesforce is among those to have already done so, calling for a full investigation into the deal in October . The European Commission is expected to deliver its ruling on or before December 6.",

      "text": "Technology Vivaldi becomes first browser to control your home lighting; here’s how it is taking on Google, Mozilla and Microsoft Vivaldi becomes first browser to control your home lighting; here’s how it is taking on Google, Mozilla and Microsoft In the game of browsers like Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Apple Safari and Mozilla Firefox, a new browser Vivaldi with it's latest version seems to have entered a totally novel playing field. By: Sumit Chakraborty | Updated:  16 PM Vivaldi is the brainchild of Jon Von Tetzchner the creator of the Opera browser. Vivaldi makes no qualms about the fact that it aims for the ‘power’ user.

Vivaldi is the brainchild of Jon Von Tetzchner the creator of the Opera browser. Vivaldi makes no qualms about the fact that it aims for the ‘power’ user. It even goes with the tagline: Powerful and Personal. Vivaldi is a free browser which runs across all platforms like Mac, Windows and Linux. It is very powerful and heavily customised software which appeals to users who want the maximum out of a browser. Users who love to work with many processes simultaneously will be very happy. Vivaldi is clearly aimed at users who use browsers for much more than such surf the social media wave. With its interface customisations, its trademark feature, it stands out in the area flooded with plenty of similar software. \nThe customisability of Vivaldi makes it possible to stack several open tabs in a folder-like manner which makes it easier to handle multiple websites. A post on the company’s download website says, “We at Vivaldi believe in making software that lets you do things your way. We adapt to you! With Vivaldi, you can customise the browser the way you want.” This will be the first instance where Vivaldi will go on an adventurous journey as it allows the browser to control Internet of Things. It integrates with Philips Hue colour lights which enable the user to control lights in the smart home. Synchronising the colours of the web with the physical surrounding, essentially also means that users will be able to know about the Facebook notifications with the change in lights of a room. \nVivaldi’s Sync service will allow users to synchronise passwords, history, setting and more. The browser also allows customisation of the user interface like the theme, address bar etc. The best part is, the updates will be delta updates which mean instead of downloading the entire software again, just the upgrades will be downloaded. You will also be able to view multiple websites side by side on its web panel. \nIn a world of stagnant browsers, Vivaldi surely gives the user something new. It is true that web browsers cannot earn enough direct revenue but they do so indirectly through market expansion, ads and online search royalties. What tech giants like Apple and Google do with Safari and Chrome is that they use the user data to attract them to their other products, that makes heavy users want for more from browsers. They cannot afford to even use ad blocks as it will be against the very foundation for an indirect revenue model. \nThis makes us come to the point, that initially, such browsers like Vivaldi will have to come free of cost and then try to figure out a way to earn money. These new browsers’ main focus is on privacy and security, making browsing more secure than ever. \nBy integrating software and physical space, Vivaldi is mixing the two extremes which browsers aim for feature richness and minimalism, which were earlier a compromise in effect.

In fact, Tim Cook is on record saying about hybrid devices that can be used both as a laptop and as a tablet that \"you can converge a toaster and a refrigerator, but you know those things are not going to be probably be pleasing to the user. \" Well, Microsoft's CEO begs to differ, pointing out that Apple actually has a device similar to its Surface concept, and it is called iPad Pro , which Apple now bills as a computer in ads like the one you see below. \" I mean, take even Surface. Three years ago, the two-in-one as a form factor was questioned. Does anybody need one? And now guess what, even our competition has decided that it's not a refrigerator and a toaster but it's actually a two-in-one ,\" quips Satya Nadella. Well, if you have to tack on a keyboard cover with a stand to a thin device with a touchscreen to make it work like a laptop, you might as well get an ultrabook these days, as they now have similar battery life but are more powerful and offer more storage plus proper keyboards and ports for similar prices, but we digress. On the topic of phone development, Microsoft's CEO was more obscure: We don't want to be driven by just envy of what others have, the question is, what can we bring? That's where I look at any device form factor or any technology, even AI... We will continue to be in the phone market not as defined by today's market leaders, but by what it is that we can uniquely do in what is the most ultimate mobile device. Therefore [with Nokia assets], we stopped doing things that were me-too and started doing things, even if they are today very sub-scale, to be very focused on a specific set of customers who need a specific set of capabilities that are differentiated and that we can do a good job of. Thus, it seems that Microsoft is really planning to focus on artificial intelligence, Android or iOS apps, virtual reality and cloud computing, gnawing on the mobile industry from the sides, rather than trying to compete with Apple or Samsung in the phone business with devices directly, which is probably the smarter move at this point.",

      "text": "Turn on 2-factor authentication to secure your Microsoft account. Click to enlarge \nThe default settings for Windows 10 strongly encourage you to sign in with a Microsoft account. Although it's easy enough to switch to a local account , there are good reasons for connecting that Microsoft account, including the ability to easily sync settings between devices. \nBut that powerful account is potentially a source of headaches if your credentials are stolen or phished. To protect yourself, I recommend that you turn on Microsoft's additional security features, which require a second form of authentication if someone tries to use those credentials on an unknown device. \nThe option is buried deep in the web interface for a Microsoft account. Fortunately, there's an easy-to-remember shortcut: \nhttps://account.live.com/proofs/ \nSigning in with your Microsoft account at that page gives you access to three advanced security settings: Two-step verification forces you to provide a second proof of identity when you sign-in on an untrusted device. That code can be sent to an email address, delivered as a text message to your mobile phone, or generated by an authenticator app on your mobile phone The trusted devices list lets you skip the second factor on a device you own after you successfully prove your identity. If a device is stolen or you suspect you;ve been compromised, you can clear this list and force a 2FA prompt. A r ecovery code is worth printing out and saving in a secure location as a way to regain access if you lose access to other verification options. \nNote that if you turn on two-step verification, you'll need to generate app passwords for signing in to an Xbox console, to Microsoft Outlook, and to third-party apps that can't receive a 2FA code. \nGiven the havoc that a hacked account can cause, I strongly recommend visiting this page and tightening up your Microsoft account security. \nNext week: Another Windows 10 tip from Ed Bott see all of ed bott's Windows 10 Tips",

When APIs get added in to the OS and SDK, any developer can start updating their app. Once the next release of Windows is available, any app that want to use these new features will be able submit an update to the Store.\nNow at long last the profile is available to developers in the 14965 build SDK , which should mean companies which rely on the profile to notify wearables of events will be able to develop and test solutions which make their devices more compatible with Windows 10 Mobile.\nDevelopers like Fitbit have been waiting for years to get GATT server support on Windows. Once Microsoft adds this support to all users early next year, developers like Fitbit can update their apps to support SMS/Call notifications on wearable devices. This still unfortunately means a long wait for Fitbit users, but fortunately due to the UWP app Windows 10 remains well supported by the company, so we are confident it will eventually arrive.",

      "title": "SQL Server 2016: Parallel Processing for Microsoft R Server Part I",
      "text": "SQL Server 2016: Parallel Processing for Microsoft R Server Part I Nov 22 , 2016 Dan Buskirk Part I: Setting Up the System In several previous blogs, we have talked about installing Microsoft R Server as a part of a SQL Server 2016 installation, and we have called attention to the fact that the SQL Server 2016 installation disk provides for a standalone installation of R Server. What we have not discussed is that this standalone installation provides you will all the tools (well, almost all the tools) to get started with parallel programming in R. To be sure, if you are serious about parallel programming in a Windows environment you should build a Microsoft HPC cluster. However, if you just wish to explore parallel programming with R, you can get started immediately using MPI, the Message Passing Interface. If you have not already installed R Server, you can install it from the same setup program that installs SQL Server itself. On the installation tab, near the bottom, there is a selection for a standalone installation of R Server. The installation process for R Server installs Microsoft’s implementation of MPI. It also installs a launch service for MPI processes. By default, this service is set for manual start. To work with MPI, this service must be running on all participating machines. You might wish to simply set the service start mode to ‘automatic’. Once the installation is complete, you will need to go to the folder where R lives. Copy the full path and use it to update the Windows ‘Path’ environment variable. As long as you you may as well create a desktop shortcut for yourself. Whether you create a shortcut or not, start the R GUI with Administrative privilege so you can install the Rmpi package for everyone, not just you. Once the R GUI starts, we will want to install Rmpi, the R package that provides an interface between R and the MPI libraries. You must choose a mirror site from which to download if you have not already done so, and then choose Packages | Install Package(s)… and select Rmpi from the list. You can test MPI on multiple processes running on a single machine, but the real benefit lies in distributing processing over multiple machines. The process we have just described will have to be repeated for each machine that will participate in your R cluster. Configuring Rmpi You will need to choose a working directory for your R MPI studies; you must use the same folder on all machines participating in the cluster. I have used my folder in the Windows “Users” folder, but you are free to choose wherever you like. While we won’t be making use of it here, in general it is convenient to choose a folder that can be shared among machines as a UNC folder. MPI does not make use of this, but it is convenient if you wish to copy R scripts to all the machines participating in the cluster, as well as copy input and output data files. Once you have chosen your folder, you must go to the Rmpi folder in the R library folder. There you will find a file named Rprofile. This file contains information that will be read by the Rmpi library at runtime to provide necessary configuration information. Copy this file to your chosen working directory. After you have copied this file, you must rename it to “.Rprofile”. The Windows File Explorer does not seem to want you to create a filename with a leading punkt, so you will have to rename the file at the command line: rename Rprofile .Rprofile . Since we will want to be launching R while in this directory, you should add “C:\\Program Files\\Microsoft SQL Server\\130\\R_SERVER\\bin\\x64” to your Path environment variable. Testing the Installation When I am finished an installation, I don’t want to read more, I want to run something. Let’s start up four MPI R processes to confirm our installation was successful. Open a command prompt in the same folder you chose as your working directory, in other words, the folder containing the file “.Rprofile”. If you have read other blogs on the web about R and MPI, you will likely have seen references to loading the Rmpi library in R and then calling mpi.spawn.Rslaves( ) . Forget it. This is a Linux thing and will not work in Windows. Because of some differences in how threads and processes are spawned, in Windows we do not start MPI from R, we start R from MPI. At the command prompt, type mpiexec -n 4 “Rterm.exe”–no-save -q This example creates four R terminal processes on the local machine. it takes a while to start, since you are waiting for much of R to be loaded. You should then see something like this: MPI has created four processes. We are working at an R prompt in the master, and in this case there are three slaves. We can send commands to the slaves as so: > result <- mpi.remote.exec(sample(1:100,1))",

      "text": "Do you have Microsoft Edge , Internet Explorer, Mozilla's Firefox , and Google Chrome all installed in Windows 10 ? You can use any of them them to open Web pages, but you must specify which specific browser opens what.\nMeanwhile, Windows has always allowed you to set a default app to launch particular files, but Windows 10 offers some handy and helpful new features to do so. Let's see how this works.\nTo set the default apps for your key software programs, click on the Start button > Settings > System > Default apps.\nThe right pane of the Default apps screen lists some of your core Windows 10 app categories with the name of the app currently set as the default. For example, your default email app may be the built-in Mail app. Your Music Player may be Groove Music. And your Web browser may be Microsoft Edge.\n\nTo change the default app for any of these categories, click on the category, and from the pop-up list, select the app you wish to use. For example, you may want to change your default Web browser from Edge to Internet Explorer.\n\nFurther, you can search for an app not listed by clicking \"Look for an app in the Store.\"\n\nDoing so launches the Microsoft Store app, which displays a list of apps that can open the associated file type.\n\nFrom there, you can click on and install a particular app, which then becomes available if you want to set it as the default.\n\nLet's go back to the Default apps screen. Should you change your mind and wish to revert back to all of the core Windows 10 default apps, click the Reset button.\n\nOkay, well, that takes care of the core apps in Windows. But what if you want to set the default apps for other file categories. You can do that a number of ways. Click on the link to \"Choose default apps by file type.\"\n\nYou'll see a l ng list of file extensions and descriptions along with their current default apps. To change the default app for a particular file type, click on the current default app and choose another one from the list. If you're not sure about a specific file type and app, search for them on the Web to make sure you choose a suitable default app.\n\nNext, go back to the Default apps screen and click on the link to \"Choose default apps by protocol.\"\n\nThis is a more widespread way of setting a default app by category. Most of these you won't want to change. But with some, such as your Web browser, just click on the existing default app to change it to a different one.\n\nFinally, jump back to the Default apps screen and click \"Set defaults by app.\"\n\nHere, you can choose the app that you want to set as the default for a particular type of file. Click on the name of an app, and you have two choices.\n\"Set this program as default\" sets the default app for all file types associated with a particular category. For example, setting Paint as the default means it will open all graphic file types, including GIF, JPG, PNG, and TIF.\n\n\"Choose defaults for this program\" lets you choose the file types you want to open with this app. For example, you can choose to open GIF and JPG files with Paint but open PNG and TIF files with the Windows Photo Viewer.",

      "text": "  8:20am CST | by IANS , in News | Latest Business News Photo Credit: Getty Images \nMore than $10 million has been saved every year and emissions reduced by the equivalent of 7.5 million tonnes of carbon dioxide through investments in energy efficiency, green power and carbon offset community projects, software giant Microsoft says in a new report. Don't Miss: The Black Friday 2016 Deals on Sale Now \nThe company, which set a voluntary internal carbon fee four years ago, says its carbon-neutral initiatives have impacted more than 3.2 million people in emerging nations. \nIt has purchased more than 10 billion kilowatt-hours of 'green power' for lighting up its offices since July 2012. \nThese facts came to light in its white paper that was released at the just concluded COP-22 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Marrakech in Morocco. \n\"We seek to serve as a model in our commitment to environmental sustainability by delivering on our carbon neutrality commitment and uncovering new ways technology can help us better understand our planet,\" says the paper, quoting Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella. \nIt says the company's goal is to reach a point where all greenhouse gas emissions are safely absorbed by healthy forests, soils, and other natural or nature-based infrastructure. \n\"Since we implemented the carbon fee (July 2012), we have reinvested a portion of the carbon fee investment fund into our company through a range of internal carbon reduction initiatives, such as lighting equipment upgrades and e-waste recycling,\" says the paper. \n\"Specifically, part of the cost of energy that we consume from carbon-based sources is ultimately redirected to invest in projects that reduce the environmental impact of our operationally controlled facilities.\" \nThe paper says that since the launch of the programme, the company has funded over 60 projects in 23 countries by investing more than $2 million. \nTo establish the price on carbon, the company has a Carbon Neutral Council, a cross-corporate group that provides feedback on and buy-in to the programme. \nTo retire its e-waste appropriately, the company has recycled over 400,000 assets and reused over 350,000 assets in the US alone. \nThe programme also supports additional recycling and reuse in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, Asia Pacific and Latin America. \nTo light up its offices, the company is switching over to renewable sources. \nIn November 2013, the company signed a long-term agreement with RES Americas to purchase 100 percent of the energy from the Keechi Wind Project, a 110-megawatt facility in Texas. Similar pacts were also signed with other renewable companies. You May Like",

      "text": "Home » News » Computer News » Microsoft saves $10mn yearly through carbon offset Microsoft saves $10mn yearly through carbon offset 35 minutes ago | 22-11-2016 | Vishal Gulati IANS New Delhi, Nov 22 : More than $10 million has been saved every year and emissions reduced by the equivalent of 7.5 million tonnes of carbon dioxide through investments in energy efficiency, green power and carbon offset community projects, software giant Microsoft says in a new report. The company, which set a voluntary internal carbon fee four years ago, says its carbon-neutral initiatives have impacted more than 3.2 million people in emerging nations. It has purchased more than 10 billion kilowatt-hours of 'green power' for lighting up its offices since July 2012. These facts came to light in its white paper that was released at the just concluded COP-22 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Marrakech in Morocco. \"We seek to serve as a model in our commitment to environmental sustainability by delivering on our carbon neutrality commitment and uncovering new ways technology can help us better understand our planet,\" says the paper, quoting Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella. It says the company's goal is to reach a point where all greenhouse gas emissions are safely absorbed by healthy forests, soils, and other natural or nature-based infrastructure. \"Since we implemented the carbon fee (July 2012), we have reinvested a portion of the carbon fee investment fund into our company through a range of internal carbon reduction initiatives, such as lighting equipment upgrades and e-waste recycling,\" says the paper. \"Specifically, part of the cost of energy that we consume from carbon-based sources is ultimately redirected to invest in projects that reduce the environmental impact of our operationally controlled facilities.\" The paper says that since the launch of the programme, the company has funded over 60 projects in 23 countries by investing more than $2 million. To establish the price on carbon, the company has a Carbon Neutral Council, a cross-corporate group that provides feedback on and buy-in to the programme. To retire its e-waste appropriately, the company has recycled over 400,000 assets and reused over 350,000 assets in the US alone. The programme also supports additional recycling and reuse in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, Asia Pacific and Latin America. To light up its offices, the company is switching over to renewable sources. In November 2013, the company signed a long-term agreement with RES Americas to purchase 100 percent of the energy from the Keechi Wind Project, a 110-megawatt facility in Texas. Similar pacts were also signed with other renewable companies. vg/vm/hs/dg",

      "text": " 30 AM EST Wovenware Expands Partnership with Microsoft, Becomes Cloud Solution Provider Firm Leverages Azure Platform to Build Complex Smart-Apps, High-Value Custom Solutions \nSAN JUAN, PUERTO RICO--(Marketwired - November 22, 2016) - Wovenware, a nearshore provider of smart software solutions, today announced that it has expanded its partnership with Microsoft, becoming one of the first software engineering services firms in Puerto Rico to be an authorized Microsoft Cloud Solution Provider (CSP). The company will leverage the Microsoft Azure platform to address the growing market for cloud-based solutions, as well as complex smart applications, such as machine learning tools and chatbots, for mutual customers. The company will also leverage Open Source capabilities on Microsoft Azure. \nAdditionally, Wovenware announced that its first customer implementation under this new partnership is the development, deployment and management of a cloud-based sporting tournament management solution for Sports Alternative, a sports management firm. \nUnder the CSP partnership, Wovenware will build and manage customized Azure environments for customers in the U.S. and around the world, provisioning the required Azure services to build high-value customer-specific applications. \n\"Our Microsoft CSP partnership not only allows us to further support our customers' application modernization initiatives, but it also provides access to new technologies that we can use to build and deploy smart scalable solutions,\" said Carlos Meléndez, COO and co-founder, Wovenware. \n\"As smart, cloud-based solutions continue to gain traction in the marketplace, Cloud Solution Providers such as Wovenware are leveraging the Microsoft Azure platform to more quickly build innovative solutions that become critical components of customers' IT strategies,\" said Herbert Lewy, Microsoft Territory Manager for Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic. \"As our trusted technology partner, we look forward to working together to bring these benefits to companies.\" \nSports Alternative Implementation \nAs its first customer implementation under the Microsoft CSP partnership, Wovenware built the cloud-based solution, Eventiu, for Puerto Rico-based Sports Alternative. The system automates the management of basketball and volleyball tournaments, calculating and assigning team brackets, as well as the process for moving on to new rounds of play. Originally deployed in Amazon Web Services (AWS), Eventiu was moved to the Azure platform to take advantage of its Open Source offerings and automatic scaling technologies, which were crucial to the success of the solution. \n\"Since our original application was not cloud-based, nor built to scale, it was not able to handle the volume of activity that was required, which caused it to constantly fail,\" said Luis Aguila, president, Sports Alternative. Leveraging the Microsoft Azure platform, Wovenware developed a secure web application with updated technology and an infrastructure with a decoupled front-end and back-end that allows scalability and external tools integration. \"With the new cloud-based solution, the application response time has been improved by up to 50 percent from its original performance,\" added Aguila. \nEventiu's future plans include developing smart applications, such as chatbots, to answer fans' and participants' questions regarding scores, winning teams and rankings. \nAbout Wovenware \nWovenware delivers customized smart software solutions that create measurable value for customers. Through its nearshore capabilities, the company has become the partner of choice for organizations needing to re-engineer their systems and processes to increase profitability, realize efficiencies and seize new market opportunities. Wovenware's team of expert software engineers understand the unique business needs of customers to leverage complex technologies, such as AI, chatbots and cloud-based solutions, and it works closely with them to develop and manage solutions that align with their business goals. Headquartered in Puerto Rico, Wovenware works with customers in North America and around the world.

      "text": "4K Netflix on Windows 10 Requires Kaby Lake Chip and Microsoft Edge 4K Netflix on Windows 10 Requires Kaby Lake Chip and Microsoft Edge 10 Comments Your PC probably needs a processor upgrade to stream Netflix at 4K. \nBlack Friday will be the perfect opportunity to pick up a 4K TV at a healthy discount applied, but it's not just TVs that have embraced 4K resolutions, monitors have, too. However, you may be surprised to find that owning a 4K monitor doesn't necessarily mean you can watch 4K content on your PC. And in the case of Netflix, chances are you probably can't. \nThis week, Netflix and Microsoft are rolling out support for 4K streaming on Windows 10 . But your current PC, however powerful, probably won't be compatible. As The Verge points out , in order for Netflix 4K streams to work you're going to need Intel's latest 7th-gen Kaby Lake processor. You'll also need to watch using Microsoft's Edge browser. \nSuch restrictions may seem overly harsh, but it's not just Netflix that imposed them. The blame also lies with Hollywood. Netflix uses the 10-bit HEVC video compression standard, also known as H.265, and Hollywood insists on DRM wrapped around its content. \nH.265 is a successor to the widely used H.264 video compression standard. It offers double the data compression rate of H.264 while retaining the same video quality, or much higher quality video at the same compression. So you can see why Netflix embraced it. \nAny platform wishing to play H.265 content requires hardware decoding support. Intel's Kaby Lake processors are the first to offer full hardware acceleration support for encoding and decoding. Older processors can decode the streams, but in order to do so they use significantly higher CPU utilization and therefore power. Kaby Lake offers the required power efficiency missing from previous Intel chips as well as 10-bit HEVC support. // Related Articles Netflix Considers Offline Streaming \nThe Microsoft Edge requirement is due to the use of digital rights management (DRM) to protect the streams from being recorded and copied. Edge fully supports this protection. \nIntel's Kaby Lake processors are not widely available yet, making streaming Netflix at 4K on your Windows 10 PC a very niche appeal right now. There's also much easier ways to unlock 4K Netflix streaming using a dedicated streaming device . Your 4K TV may already support it, and if not, then devices including the Chromecast Ultra, Roku 4, and Xbox One S are among a growing list of devices that do. Netflix publishes a regularly updated list of supported hardware.",

Google is joining not just the .NET foundation but the steering committee, alongside RedHat and Samsung, which is supporting .NET code on all of its Tizen devices, from smart TVs to wearables and IoT devices, running on ARM. The preview of SQL Server on Linux is ready for IT teams to try out and it has key security and data warehouse features, not just the basics. A version of Microsoft’s premier development tool, Visual Studio, has even come to Mac OS. \nSurprised? You shouldn’t be. Microsoft has been moving to this cross-platform, collaborative, open source world for several years. In 2008, Microsoft started contributing to Hadoop. In 2012, Scott Guthrie (now the executive vice president of Microsoft’s Cloud and Enterprise group), announced what was then the new Windows Azure cloud by setting up Linux VMs from a Mac. And in 2014, Microsoft made .NET open source and cross platform. PowerShell followed in 2016. And for containers, one of the key emerging technologies for microservices, Microsoft chose to take a dependency on Docker, an open source project that started on Linux — not just for Azure but for Windows Server 2016 as well. \n[Also on CIO.com: What you need to know about microservices ] \nWhat does all this mean to you? Mitra Azizirad, corporate vice president for Microsoft’s developer and data division, says it’s about giving developers what they want on the platform of their choice. “We really are taking a big step forward in showing developers how we're really making it easier for them to build apps at unprecedented scale.

      "text": "Microsoft comes under fire for a new Dead Rising 4 email advertisement that is accused of featuring a racial slur, prompting Major Nelson to issue an apology to fans. Anyone that is signed up for Microsoft’s newsletters should be used to receiving emails from the company promoting its upcoming games. It appears as though Microsoft is largely footing the bill for marketing the PC and Xbox One timed-exclusive Dead Rising 4 as well, as it recently set out an email to Xbox owners hyping the game and its holiday theme by showing Frank West with his arms around a couple of costumed zombies. Unfortunately, there was an oversight with the email, prompting Xbox’s Major Nelson to release an official apology on Twitter.\nThe body of the email is a picture of Frank West and a pair of zombies that states “All We Want for the Holidays” with a zombie Christmas carol written below it. However, the subject of the Dead Rising 4 email reads “NNNNGGGHHHAAA,” which some believe sounds like a racial slur. In his tweet, Major Nelson insists that it is supposed to be interpreted as a zombie roar, but acknowledges where people could take it as a racial slur. Phonetically, it does sound like the slur in question, and so Nelson apologized and promised to “do better next time.”\nHowever, one has to wonder how this marketing blunder even made it to the public in the first place. Its potential to offend seems obvious, but perhaps the Xbox marketing team are overwhelmed with the holiday season and the impending Black Friday sales , resulting in this email slipping through the cracks.\n\nWhatever reason the email was released, all Microsoft can do now is apologize (as Major Nelson has already done), and do its best to avoid similar situations in the future. After all, the company wouldn’t want a reputation of consistently making these glaring mistakes, as it could end up costing Microsoft sales if enough people are offended by its marketing materials.\nContinued issues could also see Capcom question its relationship with Microsoft. With Microsoft handling the publishing and marketing duties for Dead Rising 4 , Capcom is entrusting its IP to the company, and expecting it to preserve its reputation. If these mistakes continue, it’s possible that we may see future Dead Rising games showcased during PlayStation’s presentation at E3 in the future, as opposed to popping up during Microsoft’s E3 conferences .\nIn the future, expect Microsoft to be a bit more cautious before it sends out emails to the public. And in the short-term, it will be interesting to see if this controversy has a negative impact on Dead Rising 4 ‘s sales, or if its promise of letting players return to the iconic Willamette Mall will be too much to pass up.\nDead Rising 4 will be available on December 6, 2016 for PC and Xbox One.\nSource: VG 24/7 ",

      "text": "Posted: Nov 22 2016, 9:06am CST | by Sumayah Aamir , in News | Latest Science News Microsoft executive Todd Holmdahl will lead the scientific and engineering effort to create scalable quantum hardware and software. Photo by Scott Eklund/Red Box Pictures via Microsoft Blog Microsoft makes an even Stronger Commitment towards Quantum Computing Microsoft has made an even stronger commitment towards research regarding quantum computing. \nMicrosoft is making a dash for its quantum computing experiments. It wants to excel in this field. The firm is going to specialize and make bets regarding this endeavor. The goal is a scalable quantum computer that employs a topological qubit. Don't Miss: Hatchimals in Stock at Walmart \nTodd Holmdahl who has a history of starting such extreme projects and then making them come to life will be overseeing all this. Scalable quantum hardware and software are what this is all about. \nHe said recently that the people at Microsoft are ready to make the leap of faith from pure R&D to practical engineering. He has played a crucial role in the development of Xbox, Kinect and HoloLens. \nYet despite his achievements, he concurs that there is no guarantee of the project being a success. It is all trial and error. However, he also states the obvious that the company has had a long streak of luck regarding this sort of miracle inventing. \nIt thus might just succeed this time around too. A modicum of risk-taking is a vital ingredient of the process. As the saying goes…nothing ventured, nothing gained. \nAt the current stage in Microsoft’s evolution, it can possibly manage this quantum computing job. It will take all it has got. Yet the extra effort will have been worth it in the end. Two leaders in this field have already been hired for the sake of finishing this job. \nThey have the talent and the brains to see to it that the work gets done and the final result is forthcoming. While they will be working for Microsoft, they will also continue to keep their posts at their respective universities. \nThe building of Microsoft quantum labs is the ultimate objective. It is a lofty and grand goal only worthy of a huge conglomerate like Microsoft. \nThe two leaders who have been chosen have said that joining forces with Microsoft is a dream come true and that they will be looking forward to working diligently for Microsoft. \nOne of them stated that it was pretty exciting to know that he would be working in tandem with Microsoft. The other one even mentioned that during the leisure time that will be a part of the job, he would take walks down the beach. The engineering will be hard core and it will pay off in the end in the form of many dividends. You May Like",

      "text": "How to Customize Your Default Apps in Windows 10 Updated 0 \nDo you have Microsoft Edge, Internet Explorer, Mozilla's Firefox, and Google Chrome all installed in Windows 10? You can use any of them them to open Web pages, but you must specify which specific browser opens what. \nMeanwhile, Windows has always allowed you to set a default app to launch particular files, but Windows 10 offers some handy and helpful new features to do so. Let's see how this works. \nTo set the default apps for your key software programs, click on the Start button > Settings > System > Default apps. \nThe right pane of the Default apps screen lists some of your core Windows 10 app categories with the name of the app currently set as the default. For example, your default email app may be the built-in Mail app. Your Music Player may be Groove Music. And your Web browser may be Microsoft Edge. \nTo change the default app for any of these categories, click on the category, and from the pop-up list, select the app you wish to use. For example, you may want to change your default Web browser from Edge to Internet Explorer. \nFurther, you can search for an app not listed by clicking \"Look for an app in the Store.\" \nDoing so launches the Microsoft Store app, which displays a list of apps that can open the associated file type. \nFrom there, you can click on and install a particular app, which then becomes available if you want to set it as the default. \nLet's go back to the Default apps screen. Should you change your mind and wish to revert back to all of the core Windows 10 default apps, click the Reset button. \nOkay, well, that takes care of the core apps in Windows. But what if you want to set the default apps for other file categories. You can do that a number of ways. Click on the link to \"Choose default apps by file type.\" \nYou'll see a l ng list of file extensions and descriptions along with their current default apps. To change the default app for a particular file type, click on the current default app and choose another one from the list. If you're not sure about a specific file type and app, search for them on the Web to make sure you choose a suitable default app. \nNext, go back to the Default apps screen and click on the link to \"Choose default apps by protocol.\" \nThis is a more widespread way of setting a default app by category. Most of these you won't want to change. But with some, such as your Web browser, just click on the existing default app to change it to a different one. \nFinally, jump back to the Default apps screen and click \"Set defaults by app.\" \nHere, you can choose the app that you want to set as the default for a particular type of file. Click on the name of an app, and you have two choices. \n\"Set this program as default\" sets the default app for all file types associated with a particular category. For example, setting Paint as the default means it will open all graphic file types, including GIF, JPG, PNG, and TIF. \n\"Choose defaults for this program\" lets you choose the file types you want to open with this app. For example, you can choose to open GIF and JPG files with Paint but open PNG and TIF files with the Windows Photo Viewer. \nThis article originally appeared on PCMag.com .

      "text": "Microsoft puts quantum computing higher on its hardware priority list The company is stepping up efforts to make quantum computing hardware and software U.S. Correspondent, IDG News Service | Nov 22, 2016 Email a friend Use commas to separate multiple email addresses From Your message has been sent. Sorry There was an error emailing this page. \nA superconducting quantum chip with nine qubits. Credit: Julian Kelly/Google Thinnest-ever Apple MacBook hands-on \nMicrosoft is accelerating its efforts to make a quantum computer as it looks to a future of computing beyond today’s PCs and servers. \nMicrosoft has researched quantum computing for more than a decade. Now the company’s goal is to put the theory to work and create actual hardware and software. [ Also on InfoWorld: Harness the power of Hadoop -- find out how in InfoWorld's Deep Dive report. | 18 essential Hadoop tools for crunching big data . | Get the latest insight on the tech news that matters from InfoWorld's Tech Watch blog . ] \nTo that effect, Microsoft has put Todd Holmdahl—who was involved in the development of Kinect, HoloLens, and Xbox—to lead the effort to create quantum hardware and software. The company has also hired four prominent university professors to contribute to the company’s research. \nQuantum computers, in theory, can significantly outperform today’s supercomputers. The ultimate goal is to create universal quantum computers that can run all existing programs and conduct a wide range of calculations, much like today’s computers. Early quantum computers can be used to run only a limited number of applications. \nCompanies like IBM, D-Wave, and Google are researching quantum computing. IBM researchers have said a universal quantum computer is still decades out, so their focus is on creating hardware targeted at solving specific problems. \nD-Wave and IBM have created quantum computers based on different theories, and the companies have bashed each other’s designs. D-Wave is trying to get more programmers to test its hardware so it can be used for more applications. \nIt’s not known when Microsoft’s quantum hardware will come out. Like others, Microsoft will have to make quantum circuits on which it can test applications and tackle issues like error correction, fault tolerance, and gating. Practical hardware will be released only after a number of quantum computing issues are resolved. But Microsoft is already offering a simulation of quantum computers via a software toolkit . \nConventional computers represent data in the forms of 1s and 0s, but quantum computers are far more complex. At the center of quantum computers are qubits, which can harness the laws of quantum mechanics to achieve various states. A qubit can hold a one and zero simultaneously and expand to states beyond that. \nQubits allow quantum computers to calculate in parallel, making them more powerful than today’s fastest computers. But qubits can be fragile, and interference from matter or electromagnetic radiation can wreck a calculation. \nResearchers at Microsoft are working on an entirely new topological quantum computer, which uses exotic materials to limit errors. There are still questions about the viability of such materials and outcomes, so it could take a long time for Microsoft to make practical quantum circuits. \nInterest in quantum computing is growing as it becomes difficult to manufacture smaller chips to speed up PCs and servers. Neuromorphic chips and quantum circuits represent a way to move computing into the future. \nMicrosoft’s new hires include Leo Kouwenhoven, a professor at the Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands; Charles Marcus, a professor at the University of Copenhagen; Matthias Troyer, a professor at ETH Zurich; and David Reilly, a professor at the University of Sydney in Australia. All of them are retaining their professor titles. To comment on this article and other InfoWorld content, visit InfoWorld's LinkedIn page , Facebook page and Twitter stream . Related:",

      "title": "Microsoft announces the next version SQL Server for Windows and Linux",
      "text": "November 22, 2016 Microsoft's announcement that it was bringing its flagship SQL Server database software to Linux came as a major surprise when the company first announced this in March.   Until now, the preview was invite-only, but as Microsoft announced today, anybody who wants to give it a try can now download the bits. That public preview is part of the launch of the next version of SQL Server, which will be the first one that's available for both Windows and Linux. Thanks to its support for Docker containers, even macOS users will be able to run it. Indeed, Microsoft is betting on containers as one of the main distribution mechanisms for the preview, which will soon be available on Azure Virtual Machines and the Docker Hub (though you can obviously also download RPM and APT packages for popular enterprise Linux distributions like Red Hat, Ubuntu and SUSE). \"This represents a major step in our journey to making SQL Server a true platform of choice across operating systems, development languages, data types, on-premises and the cloud,\" Microsoft writes in today's announcement. For now, the Linux version will include all the standard SQL Server management features that come with the Windows version. These include advanced features like always-encrypted and row-level security, as well as in-memory columnstores. As Microsoft corporate VP Julia Liuson told me, it won't include the business intelligence stack yet (though this part will be added over time). For users, though, what's maybe most important is that they will soon be able to run SQL Server on Linux and in Linux-based Docker containers, giving them more choice in how they want to deploy their databases (assuming they decide to go with SQL Server and not one of its competitors, of course). The new version of SQL Server will include improved support for R Services and a number of new machine learning and deep neural networking features. SQL Server for Linux is just another example of how Microsoft's view of competing platforms has changed in recent years. This move would've been unthinkable under its former CEO Steve Ballmer. Under Satya Nadella, however, the company's mission is to bring its services and tools to where its customers are, even if that's not on a Microsoft-owned operating system. In addition to the SQL Server for Linux news, Microsoft also today announced the preview of Linux support for Azure App Service. Oh, and in order to puts its money where its mouth it, Microsoft is also joining the Linux Foundation. For SQL Server users on Windows, Microsoft also today announced both the release of the first service pack for SQL Server 2016, as well as changes to its programmability features: many SQL Server users - including those using the free \"Express\" edition - will now get access to many of the developer features that were previously restricted to the Enterprise edition.

      "title": "Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella Mocks Apple iPad Pro For Trying To Imitate Surface",
      "text": "by Paul Lilly — Tuesday, November 22, 2016 Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella Mocks Apple iPad Pro For Trying To Imitate Surface History (and Hollywood movies) taught us that you shouldn't pick on the school nerd, because it's the school nerd who goes on to become a raging success and gets the girl or guy. Apple missed that lesson. While Apple CEO Tim Cook was busy throwing shade at the convertible tablet category by comparing the concept to the futility of trying to merge a toaster with a refrigerator, Microsoft was busy designing the Surface Pro. Now it's Microsoft boss Satya Nadella who is getting the last laugh.Let's go back in time, shall we? If you set the DeLorean to early 2012, you can sit in and listen to Cook talk about the state of Apple during the company's first-quarter earnings call. Windows 8 had not yet released to the public and netbooks were still a thing. The transformation at Microsoft and in the PC industry as a whole that Cook didn't see coming was right around the corner.\"You can converge a toaster and a refrigerator, but you know those things are probably not going to be pleasing to the user. So our view is that the tablet market is huge; we've said that since day one, we didn't wait until we had a lot of results... The iPad has taken off in not only consumer in a meaningful way, but in consumer, in education, enterprise, and its sort of everywhere you look now,\" Cook bragged.Cook went on to talk about shipping 67 million iPad devices during the quarter and hinted at tablets taking over the landscape from PCs in the next few years. That didn't happen. IDC, one of the market research firms Cook leaned on to make his prediction, recently reported a 14.7 percent decline in tablet shipments with worldwide shipments reaching just 39.6 million among an \"overall disinterested customer base.\" Out of those, Apple shipped 10.3 million, an 18.8 percent year-on-year decline and a far cry from the 67 million shipments that had Cook so excited about the category four short years ago.In an interview with The Australian Financial Review , Cook said the secret to competing with Apple and Amazon was to stop trying to. He also used the interview as an opportunity to throw a dig at Cook and the comments he made about detachables.\"The key in any momentum we have is that you have to have some amount of boldness in taking risk, and knowing that you are not always going to get it right,\" Nadella said. \"I mean, take Surface. Three years ago, the two-in-one as a form factor was questioned. Does anybody need one? And now guess what, even our competition has decided that it's not a refrigerator and a toaster, but it's actually a two-in-one.\"Nadella is referring to the iPad Pro , Apple's attempt to get some skin in the game that Microsoft largely created with its Surface line. But the problem with the iPad Pro is that it's still largely focused on mobile at the expense of productivity—it runs iOS rather than OS X, whereas the Surface Pro and Surface Book run a full fledged version of Windows 10.Give Microsoft credit here. The detachable category is one that is growing even while PC shipments as a whole have declined, and Microsoft is positioned to benefit from it. Who knows what the landscape will like in another four or five years, but for now, Nadella has earned the right to poke a little fun at Microsoft's rivals.",

      "text": "Microsoft down to a quarter women employees KO By Kyle O'Brien - 22 November 2016 15:33pm Credit: Microsoft \nThe number of women working at Microsoft is down to just over 25%. The latest data from the software giant, released Thursday, said that its employee base was 25.8% female at the end of September 2016, according to a story in the Seattle Times. \nThe numbers showed a second straight decline in the number of women employed, down one per cent from the previous year, and nearly four per cent from two years ago, when Microsoft was 29% female. \nAccording to GeekWire, the downward trend was due to its decision to back off of its phone hardware business, impacting the number of women employed. While that wasn’t the only reason for the decline, Microsoft did note a slight upward trend, with women in technical roles increasing by 0.6% and women in leadership roles increasing by 0.6%. \n“Our representation numbers show modest progress and a deepening commitment to advancing the work we’re doing around (diversity and inclusion) at Microsoft,” said Gwen Houston, Microsoft’s general manager of Global Diversity and Inclusion, in the GeekWire story. \n“While the 1 per cent decline that we noted in women globally is certainly disappointing, it wasn’t altogether unexpected,” she added. “We believe we are at or very near the end of that decline as that business decision comes to an end. We take some optimism in the fact that we are starting to see some positive trend lines.” \nThe Seattle Times noted that the Rev. Jesse Jackson is on an advocacy campaign to push Microsoft and other companies in the Silicon Valley and Silicon Forest to broaden the diversity in their respective workforces. The industry is male-dominated and employs few African American and Latino workers. Still, Microsoft lags behind Facebook, Apple and Google, which all have more than 30% female employees. \nThe percentage may rise for Microsoft after its acquisition of LinkedIn, the social business network which was bought for $26.2 billion, which is 42% female.",

      "text": "Microsoft Offers EU Concessions Over Outlook Access to Win Approval for LinkedIn Deal November 22, 2016, 10:06:  By Natalia Drozdiak \nBRUSSELS -- In a bid to win European Union antitrust approval of its $26 billion acquisition of LinkedIn Corp., Microsoft has proposed concessions that would allow rival professional social networks access to its Outlook programs, according to people familiar with the matter. \nMicrosoft has offered to allow other professional social networks access to its Outlook add-in program and Outlook APIs (or application programming interface, which allow various programs to communicate with one another) following its merger with LinkedIn, the people said. Some of the rival networks already have access to those Outlook programs, they added. \nIn addition, Microsoft has pledged to allow manufacturers such as Dell Inc. and Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co. to disable the LinkedIn shortcut on desktop devices, the people said. An EU antitrust decision in 2004 condemned Microsoft for bundling products into its Windows software. \nNone of the remedies, however, would offer rivals direct access to LinkedIn's pool of data -- a condition Salesforce.com Inc., which lost to Microsoft in its bid for LinkedIn, has publicly pressed for. However, no outside entity currently has unlimited access to LinkedIn's data trove, people familiar with the matter have said. \nThe European Commission, the bloc's antitrust regulator, has sought comment from rivals after Microsoft submitted the remedies last week. \nThe EU's current deadline to complete the review is set for Dec. 6 but that could be extended if the regulator still has concerns about the deal and decides to open an in-depth investigation. \nThe EU's antitrust authority, which has said it would scrutinize mergers involving large amounts of data more closely, sent out questionnaires to rivals in October posing questions about the rough value of LinkedIn's data and whether rival sites can replicate it. \nMicrosoft has argued that much of the user data on LinkedIn is also found on other social-networking sites, including Facebook Inc., which should therefore also be considered as part of the same market in the EU's review process. \nWrite to Natalia Drozdiak at natalia.drozdiak@wsj.com (END) Dow Jones Newswires 11-22-161006ET Copyright (c) 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.",

      "text": "Microsoft's Black Friday Deals Kick Off Today Bundles and games discounted 110 \nThe digital deals are coming. Is your wallet prepared? In anticipation of Black Friday/Cyber Monday, Microsoft has decided to start the assault on your spending dollars a little bit early. Starting today, you can save up to 50% off on the digital version of select titles, like Titanfall 2 and Gears of War 4 , and spend just $299 to get a 1 TB Xbox One S bundle. \nThere are a lot of titles on sale here so I definitely recommend perusing the full list . Outside of Gears of War 4 , the other standout co-op titles I see here include Forza Horizon 3 , Dying Light: The Following - Enhanced Edition , Dragon Age: Inquisition GOTY Edition , and a Master Chief Collection + Halo 5 Bundle . It's worth noting, again, that these deals are only on the digital versions of these games. The physical disc version will go on sale starting this Friday, November 24. \nThese deals are in addition to the the weekly Deals With Gold sale that's currently underway, which includes Dead Island Definitive Collection and Divinity: Original Sin - Enhanced Edition . Both the Black Friday sale and the Deals With Gold sale end on November 28, so you've got at least a little bit of time to weigh all of your options before going on that shopping spree. Tags",

      "title": "What The Flix? Netflix 4K Streaming Requires Kaby Lake, Windows 10, Edge Browser",
      "text": "by Paul Alcorn November 22, 2016 at 11:05 AM \nMicrosoft announced via its blog that Netflix will stream four new \"Gilmore Girls\" episodes (sigh) in 4K. The company further noted that you must use Windows 10, the Edge browser, and 7th Generation Kaby Lake processors, as well as a premium subscription to unlock the emotional rollercoaster. \nOf course, a desktop would have more than enough power to muscle its way through a 4K episode of \"Gilmore Girls,\" but due to the wonders of vendor lock-in and DRM, you will be able to view the content only on a Kaby-Lake powered machine. Apparently, Netflix has bandwidth concerns, because it has effectively limited the four new (and exciting!) \"Gilmore Girls\" 4K episodes to one recommended device. The Microsoft blog post links to Microsoft's list of Windows 10 machines, but only one on the list (the Lenovo Yoga 910) sports a Kaby Lake processor and 4K display. \nOf course, we expect the desktop Kaby Lake launch to start soon, but the 4K streaming begins November 25, so we will all miss the 4K \"Gilmore Girls\" launch. Microsoft did not specify an exact reason why Netflix is limiting the 4K stream to the Kaby Lake products, but it is likely due to hardware-based DRM features. Although GPUs could also support the DRM, it doesn't appear to be on the menu as of yet. \nNetflix also requires Windows 10 for 4K streaming; previous-generation operating systems will not work. It also requires the cringe-worthy Edge browser. Windows 10 isn't that onerous of a requirement, but the Edge browser accounts for only roughly 6% of the market (and declining). Therefore, even though it's by no means the most popular option, it is your only choice for 4K \"Gilmore Girls.\" Netflix did go out of its way to take a swipe at Chrome, which is the most popular browser in the world: \nWhen streaming Netflix on Microsoft Edge you can get through at least one more full episode of Gilmore Girls than when streaming on Chrome on battery*** – and you know one episode can be the difference between Chris and Lorelai casually dating and being a married couple. \nOf course, we wouldn't want to miss out on the current status of Chris and Lorelai's relationship, but the blog notes: \n***Battery life varies significantly with settings and other factors. \nIn other words, your mileage may vary, and the battery claims may not even be a true statement. Microsoft has made plenty of fast and loose claims about Edge lately. I installed Windows 10 on a new rig I built this weekend, and when I installed Chrome, Windows notified me with a pop up that Edge detects and blocks 21% more socially engineered malware (the new pop-up actually made the news, too). It also took four or five attempts before Windows 10 would accept Chrome as my default browser. I digress. \nSome of these moves aren't entirely unforeseen, as Microsoft also recently announced that it would not support Intel's Kaby Lake and AMD's Zen processors with pre-Windows 10 operating systems. We've reached out to both AMD and Intel on that topic to inquire why, and what features will not work on Windows 7 and 8. Both companies directed us to Microsoft, which refuses to comment beyond canned quotes that don't answer the questions. \nNow, if you want to stream 4K video from Netflix, you have to break out the Kaby Lake and Windows 10 combo with some Edge browser sprinkled on top. Netflix hasn't announced 4K streaming support for Zen, but it almost certainly will (it had better). Just don't hold your breath for it to work with older processors. \nIt makes one wonder if there aren't some hidden forces in the background pulling strings to ensure that the average consumer has a reason to upgrade their computers. No Windows 10 or Netflix 4K streaming for the CPU stragglers and no Netflix 4K for the Chrome lovers. \nMaybe we need to coin the term NetWintel (WintelFlix?).

Our Windows phone app also showcases similar behaviour. The MSN Weather app for its part now supports transparent tiles, I’m not certain if this is supposed to support Chaseable live tiles as well, but in theory, it should also display the last location which showed up on your live tile in a prominent position once you opened the app.\nThe MSN Weather app for its part now supports transparent tiles, I’m not certain if this is supposed to support Chaseable live tiles as well, but in theory, it should also display the last location which showed up on your live tile in a prominent position once you opened the app.\nThe apps also pick up generic improvements with “Live Tiles” and easier navigation between slideshows. Of course, the usual bug fixes and improvements are present as well.\nHere’s the changelog via the Windows Store (both are the same):\nIn this update:\nLive Tile reliability improvements – Easily navigate from slideshow to slideshow Performance, reliability and accessibility improvements – General bug fixes You can update the app from the store links below and let us know what you think in the comments below:\nWP-Appbox: MSN Weather (Free, Windows Store) → \nWP-Appbox: MSN Weather (Free, Windows Store) → ",

Microsoft Paint 3D available for preview Microsoft Paint 3D available for preview 0 shares 0 \nMicrosoft have released a preview of their upcoming Paint 3D to Windows Insiders. As confirmed last month by 3DPI , Microsoft are giving their Paint application a 3D facelift. The software will become available next year along with the free Creators Update. In order to preview Paint 3D you will have to sign up to Windows Insider and have a PC that is able to run Windows 10. We’ve taken a look at the GUI, so you don’t have to. The simple looking interface of Microsoft Paint 3D. Image via NextReality. \nMicrosoft are clearly not targeting the serious power user of 3D design software with this release, but the product seems to be an gentle first step for beginner 3D designers since there are specifically no scary intricate tool-bars to deter users. Microsoft have aimed for simplicity to engage their users and avoid intimidating with them, this particularly important for first-timers. While in its current form its use seems limited in comparison to other 3D designing software, perhaps in the future Microsoft will develop a pro version if there is demand.

Image via NextReality. \nHowever, for now the software will most likely be used by the young and those unfamiliar with 3D design software in order to get a taste for the process. The pictures show how child-friendly the software is and looks as if it will be successful in bringing 3D design into the mainstream. The real excitement with this technology should come when Paint 3D is combined with Microsoft’s other technology such as the HoloLens. This will allow users’ 3D designs to be represented in virtual reality. If this works well, it may give Paint 3D an edge over competitors.

      "title": "Microsoft Plans Valentine's Breakup With SHA-1",
      "text": "Microsoft Plans Valentine's Breakup With SHA-1 By Ionut Arghire on November 22, 2016 Tweet Starting on February 14, 2017, Microsoft’s Edge and Internet Explorer 11 web browsers will no longer load sites protected with a SHA-1 certificate, but will instead display an invalid certificate warning. Weaknesses in the 20 year-old crypto algorithm were found over a decade ago, but recent research revealing that collision attacks against SHA-1 are increasingly feasible has forced tech firms to sunset the algorithm sooner than originally planned . Starting in early 2017, most Certificate Authorities (CAs) will no longer issue certs using the SHA-1 cryptographic hash algorithm. Although the deadline to transition to the more secure SHA-2 and SHA-3 algorithms is looming, research published last week from Venafi revealed that 35% of websites still use SHA-1 certificates. These sites could face disruption in the New Year, as Internet companies and major browser providers will kill support for the algorithm too. Mozilla was the first browser maker to announce such plans a couple of weeks ago, when it revealed that, starting in Firefox 51 , the browser would display an error message when encountering a SHA-1 cert. Both Google and Microsoft followed suit last week, saying that Chrome, Edge, and Internet Explorer 11 will move ahead with deprecating support for the crypto early next year. For Edge and Internet Explorer 11 users, the change will be visible starting on Valentine’s Day, when they will be met with a warning when such insecure certificates are encountered. However, users will have the option to ignore the warning and continue to the website, Microsoft says . “The SHA-1 hash algorithm is no longer secure. Weaknesses in SHA-1 could allow an attacker to spoof content, execute phishing attacks, or perform man-in-the-middle attacks when browsing the web. Microsoft, in collaboration with other members of the industry, is working to phase out SHA-1,” Alec Oot and Jody Cloutier, Senior Program Manager, Microsoft Edge Team, reveal. They also explain that only SHA-1 certificates that chain to a Microsoft Trusted Root CA will be impacted by this change. This means that manually-installed enterprise or self-signed SHA-1 certificates won’t be affected, although all organizations are advised to migrate to SHA-256 as soon as possible. In the meantime, site admins who believe they might be impacted by the upcoming change can test how their websites will be impacted, as long as they have the latest November 2016 Windows Updates installed, Microsoft says. The company provides a set of instructions on what commands to run for that. Citing “the imminent possibility of attacks that could directly impact the integrity of the Web PKI,” Google too revealed last week that it plans to sunset the old crypto hash algorithm when Chrome 56 would arrive in late Jan. 2017. “We are planning to remove support for SHA-1 certificates in Chrome 56, which will be released to the stable channel around the end of January 2017. The removal will follow the Chrome release process, moving from Dev to Beta to Stable; there won't be a date-based change in behavior. Website operators are urged to check for the use of SHA-1 certificates and immediately contact their CA for a SHA-256 based replacement if any are found,” Andrew Whalley, Chrome Security, note d in a blog post. While Chrome 56 will display an error when encountering a SHA-1 cert, it will do so only for certificates that chain to a public CA. However, the browser won’t block certificates chaining to a locally installed trust anchor next year, support for these will be removed on Jan. 1, 2019, Whalley said. He also explained that the EnableSha1ForLocalAnchors policy that was introduced in Chrome 54 and which allows for certs that chain to a locally installed trust anchor to continue being used after support has been removed from Chrome, will become mandatory starting with Chrome 57 (March 2017). Thus, organizations will have more time to complete the transition to SHA-256.",

      "title": "Oracle Now Fully Integrated With Microsoft Office 365 via Layer2 Cloud Connector",
      "text": "  11:03 AM EST Oracle Now Fully Integrated With Microsoft Office 365 via Layer2 Cloud Connector 100+ most common IT-systems and apps like SQL, ERP/CRM are supported for Oracle data integration and sync, as well as Microsoft Office 365, SharePoint, Dynamics, Exchange, Office Groups, and Azure. Hamburg, Germany   \n​Oracle Database, produced by Oracle Corporation, is a widely used object-relational database management system. As one of the first designed databases for enterprise grid computing to store and manage structured information, Oracle is still one of the most popular databases until now. To connect and sync Oracle data queries with various external systems, the Layer2 Cloud Connector out-of-the-box comes with data providers to support a wide range of cloud-based data sources, like Microsoft Office 365, SharePoint, Exchange, Dynamics, Office Groups, Azure and also on-premises applications like RDBMS systems (SQL/ERP/CRM/CMS). \n​Using Layer2 Cloud Connector for flexible sync options, low risks and costs for integration projects \n​The Layer 2 Cloud Connector, often referred as a \"Swiss Army Knife\" for cloud data integration, optimizes collaboration and budgets by decreasing the complexity, the costs, and the risks of projects and reducing the dependency on corporate IT or other department teams. It's simple to use with no additional tools or programming required, no matter if it's hosted in public, in private clouds (e.g. Azure) or locally (as a Windows Service). \nThe setup is finished in a few minutes guided by wizards. Customers don't need to install or customize the Oracle data source or the data destination and have a wide range of flexibility due to a rich suite of already included Data Providers. While programming is generally not required, dynamic columns can be added directly in C# to cleanup data, implement data transformation and translation, or add customer specific business logic. \n\"The Layer2 products are characterized by adding additional features to the Microsoft Cloud and help customers to quickly and better work with their software without any specific data integration knowledge. The rich suite of data providers is available as ready-to-use sample connection templates, e.g. for Microsoft SharePoint, Office 365, Exchange, Dynamics, OData, and XML/SOAP web services. But the connector also works seamlessly together with already existing vendor-specific data providers, e.g. for SQL Server, SQL Azure, Oracle, MySQL, PostgreSQL, IBM AS/400, IBM DB2, Informix, SAP and 100 more. Many 3rd party data providers, e.g. for Salesforce, Google, Twitter, Facebook etc. are also supported,\" explains Frank Daske, Business Development Manager at Layer2. \nFree download after registration \n​New prospects can download a free Shareware Edition of the Layer Cloud Connector after registration on the vendor's product homepage. Existing customers, who are using the Layer2 Cloud Connector with Software Assurance profit from the new feature with a free upgrade. \nFull press release available here . \nAbout Layer2 \nAs a Microsoft Gold Certified Partner and ISV based in Hamburg (Germany), Layer2 is one of the leading providers of Microsoft Office 365, SharePoint, and Azure apps in Europe with a major focus on Data Integration, Collaborative Knowledge Management, Social Networking and Cloud Computing. Layer2 has also been known as a reliable partner to customers in Central Europe, offering additional consulting and services in the fields of SharePoint, Office 365, Azure and IT infrastructure for more than 25 years. \nContact: \nFrank Daske, Layer 2 GmbHEiffestraße 664bTel.: +49 (0) 40 / 28 41 12 - 30Fax: +49 (0) 40 / 28 41 12 - 16",

You can claim Super Dungeon Bros (Xbox One) and Far Cry 3 Blood Dragon (Xbox 360) until the end of the month, and you have until December 15 to grab Murdered: Soul Suspect (Xbox One). \nThe only things that you have to do to get these four games for free every month is to be an Xbox Live Gold member, and claim them between the specified dates. Remember, if you ever cancel your subscription, you get to keep the Xbox 360 games (which are always backward compatible), but you lose the Xbox One games. Tags",

      "text": "Microsoft made another email blunder on Monday when it sent an email promoting \"Dead Rising 4,\" the fourth installment of a zombie apocalypse game planned for release on the Xbox One gaming console in early December.\nThe email subject line attempted to imitate the moaning of the undead with the phrase “NNNNGGGHHHAAAA,” but instead was interpreted by many on social media as a racial slur.\nThe technology giant has since apologized for the mishap on Twitter, where the company’s PR representative Larry Hryb wrote: “Today we sent a DR4 email where a zombie roar was interpreted by many as a racial slur. We apologize and promise to do better next time.”\nThis is not the first time Microsoft has sent insensitive promotional email content. In July, Microsoft found itself in hot water after an email sent from a Microsoft University Recruiter encouraged interns to get “lit,” or intoxicated, on a Monday night.\nThe email also referred to the recipients as “bae,” a term of affection often reserved for a significant other as it is a shortened version of \"babe\" or \"baby.\"\nIt would appear that Microsoft has yet to learn the importance of A/B testing, a critical juncture of email marketing campaigns that can help safeguard brands from such cultural no-nos. A/B testing, or split testing, is the practice of comparing two versions of the same email (or web page or mobile application) to see what version elicits the highest and most positive engagement rates. \nWith A/B testing, marketers can test a wide variety of email components to optimize conversion rates, including the recipient’s name, subject line, email frequency and the amount of content within the body of the email itself. Jordie van Rijn, an email marketing specialist and blogger at emailmonday.com, provides a list of 150 different ways to A/B test an email.\nA recent study of more than 300 email marketers representing brands with more than 100 employees by Clutch reveals that only 23% of marketers incorporate A/B testing into their email marketing campaigns.",

      "text": "\nMicrosoft’s continuing to open up the development of their products. What originally started as the Windows Insider Program to get feedback for the development of Windows 10 began spinning off, giving us things like the Office Insider Program , Skype Insider Program , Xbox Insider Program , and now Sea of Thieves is getting its own Insider Program(me). While plenty of Microsoft produced/published games have had betas in the past, this is the first to use the Insider branding- which we can now presume will be used for the majority of (if not all) betas going forward.\nAnnounced on the Sea of Thieves blog by Bobby Lamirande, the program will let people get a look into the development of Sea of Thieves, submit feedback, and even more importantly: try out beta builds of the game. It sounds pretty familiar to anyone who’s a part of the Windows Insider Program, or has even tried out some other MMO betas in the past, but that doesn’t mean it’s without any other bonuses.\nInsiders will be given access to their very own private forum to submit feedback and talk with the team, and they’ll also have special badges on the public Sea of Thieves forums so the developers can spot their posts easily. Additionally, they’ll also be regularly sent surveys about the game’s design.\nUnlike other Microsoft Insider programs, however, not everybody will be able to try out the game. It’s still very much a closed beta, with multiple waves of invitations going out over the course of its development.\nYou can sign up for the Sea of Thieves Insider Programme here , but keep in mind that you need to be at least 18 years old to join.\nWill you be joining the Sea of Thieves Insider Programme? Let us know in the comments below! ",

      "text": "Microsoft just announced that 4K Netflix streaming in now exclusively available through its browser Microsoft Edge. marcyscreed2013 via Flickr \nHow does 4K Netflix streaming sounds on PC? You might want to skip your smart TV for your computer. Microsoft just announced that Netflix contents can now be streamed exclusively on Microsoft Edge. Specifically, the streaming media provider's 4K catalog will be available through the Windows 10 browser including the new Gilmore Girl episodes. \nMicrosoft posted that compatible Windows 10 devices will be streaming the 4K content from Netflix. That includes PCs and 2-in-1s. As for the Gilmore Girls loyal fans, you can use your Microsoft Edge browser to access the new Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life. The show is set to premiere on Nov. 25. The tech company boasts that Microsoft Edge is the \"only browser that supports Netflix 4K content\". \nLikewise, Microsoft claims that streaming on Edge will allow the viewer \"at least one more full episode of Gilmore Girls than when streaming on Chrome\" on battery. Though it has a disclaimer that the longevity of the battery differs depending on settings and other factors. \nAmong the system requirement needed for the 4K streaming on Microsoft Edge include a device with a 4K display and is powered by a seventh-generation Intel Core Processor. If you don't have a device with those specifications, you are advised to head over to Microsoft Stores. You need to purchase a new Windows 10 device that supports 4K streaming. \nAccording to the Windows Central , this is not the first time Netflix singled out Microsoft Edge. Apparently, the browser was the only browser that streamed Netflix shows in full 1080p resolution. Edge's fiercest rivals Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox were only able to support up to 720p. \nThose who are using Chrome and Firefox might have to switch to Edge. However, it remains to be seen if Microsoft's move will help Edge past Chrome and Firefox. According to Stats Counter , Google's web browser had a 50.9 percent global usage share in October. Firefox only had 7.14 percent. Edge had the lowest share at 1.58 percent. \nWith Net MarketShare , 54.99 percent of worldwide desktop browser market share was for Chrome, 11.14 percent for Firefox and a 5.26 percent for Edge. Though it should be noted that there are still a lot of people who are using Microsoft's previous browser Internet Explorer. Not everyone has upgraded and moved to the newer Edge. \nOnce IE becomes obsolete, Microsoft Edge is expected to gain market share. But it will take a lot more to get ahead of Chrome. The fact that streaming service is a growing market, Edge could capitalize on that with the 4K Netflix streaming.",

      "text": "0 0 \nSurface Studio, the very high priced Microsoft’s all-around PC solution , was launched back in October and stole the show with its impeccable specifications and design. The device managed to secure a decent number of pre-orders that Microsoft has just started fulfilling. Along with generating an email to all pre-orders, it also notified them of the shipping process . \nYour new Surface Studio is almost here. Good news, your new Surface Studio is available early. We will be processing payment and shipping your new Surface Studio the week of November 21, 2016. You will receive a shipping notification once your order is processed. \nThe shipment is to begin sometime in the coming week. For those who pre-ordered it in its launch week, they should be getting their hands on it very soon. For the rest, you can grab a brand new Surface Studio from Microsoft’s Online store starting early 2017, including the top-of-the-range configuration with 2 TB storage space, 32 GB RAM, and Intel Core i7 processor for $4,199. Pre-ordering the machine right now nets users a free Surface Dial, the revolutionary accessory that would otherwise be available separately for $99. \nA brief review: \nCritics have reviewed the device as a must-have. Acquiring mostly positive reviews, the Surface Studio possesses not just a uniquely minimalistic design, but a dynamic large screen which makes it perfect for consumers with an artistic taste. \nThe machine has everything you can expect from an All-in-One device — there’s no doubting that — but that does not make up for its steep price tag, given the fact its internal specs are nothing outstanding and there availability of devices on the market with similar or better specifications at a much more reasonable cost. Nonetheless, the device’s pen capabilities were well-developed along with several other aspects, making it one of the most powerful computers available. \nMicrosoft’s Surface Studio ships from early next year. You can pre-order it and its accessories from the links below:",

An Intel Core i3-6100 or AMD FX-4350 CPU. \nThe biggest hurdle facing virtual reality as it makes the jump from niche to mainstream is accessibility. The difference in specs has been lessened somewhat since Oculus' introduction of asynchronous spacewarp, but is still stark enough. Even with the PlayStation 4's simpler VR solution, you're looking at an $800 minimum to get rolling. The price only jumps upward from there. It's harder to offer up a single price point, but Microsoft's specs suggest that just about any computer with a DirectX 12-compatible card can run what it intends to offer. It's also worth noting that these specifications only produce a barebones experience—full-fledged PC VR still requires a Core i5 CPU and a GTX 970 graphics card. \nIt's tough to say what kind of experiences Microsoft can offer with these lower-end specs and cheaper hardware. However, with a $299 headset and these low system requirements, Microsoft may open up virtual reality as a realistic option for countless users in homes and businesses both.",

But many have commented that Azure virtual machines for common workloads don’t make much economic sense; some say it’s cheaper to run those workloads on-premises, along with all the power, cooling, and infrastructure maintenance costs. Note: Personally I find that Azure compute can be very useful for shared, online, and temporary/burst workloads, but it is hard to justify lift’n’shift of traditional 24/7 workloads to the cloud on the balance sheet.\nSponsored The other concern with Azure virtual machines is that no one (and I mean no one) ever (ever!) asks for a virtual machine with 1.75GB, 3.5GB, or 7GB RAM that the traditional VM series’ in Azure offer. People use the bit derived numbers of 2GB, 4GB, and 8GB.\nThe Av2-Series Virtual Machines The Av2-Series is the recently announced successor to the A-Series. The new series follows the paths set forth by the F-Series, and then the N- and H- families of virtual machines. Microsoft made the hardware sizes more familiar, and standardized the naming. We can tell from the name of the VM size how many virtual processors it has and, using a 2x multiplier, how much RAM it has (for non-specialized workloads), and how many data disks that it can support. For example, the A4v2 virtual machine has:\n4 virtual processors 8GB RAM Can support up to 8 data disks This naming standard will make sizing and pricing solutions easier. Standardized special designations are also used; the “M” designation signifies larger than usual memory. For example, the A4mv2 has 32GB RAM instead of 8GB in the non-M size.\nThe sizes of the Azure Av2-Series virtual machines [Image Credit: Aidan Finn]\nMicrosoft promised recently, while reducing the costs of some A-Series sizes, that the forthcoming Av2-Series would be cheaper again. A Standard A3 with 4 vCPUs and 7GB RAM costs $267.84 per month in North Europe. We can have an A4v2 with 4 vCPUs and 8GB RAM for $203.86, giving us a saving of $63.98. The prices of the Azure Av2-Series virtual machines in North Europe [Image Credit: Aidan Finn]\nMicrosoft changed more than just logistics; it also claimed to have improved overall performance over the A-Series: We have also improved our local disk random IOPS to be two to ten times faster than the existing A-series.\nSponsored So the new Av2-Series is better, easier to understand, and more affordable; that’s a win-win-win.\nThe post Azure Launches New Av2-Series VMs appeared first on Petri .\n",

      "text": "By Rich Woods Neowin LLC @@TheRichWoods · 4 minutes ago with 1 comment \nToday is Tuesday, which means that Microsoft added three more games to the Xbox One Backward Compatibility list, including Burnout Paradise , Pure , and Rayman Legends . It's worth noting that the company just announced this month's Games with Gold , and Burnout Paradise was among them. \nNew additions to the Backward Compatibility list typically show up on Tuesdays and Thursdays; however, don't expect to see any on the 24th, as it's Thanksgiving in the United States. For the same reason, Microsoft won't be releasing any Windows 10 Insider Preview builds this week . \nHere's what's new to Backward Compatibility: \nBurnout Paradise ($14.99) \nRace, jump and smash through the streets of Paradise City in muscle cars, exotics, hot rods and even supercharged SUVs designed from the ground up to look beautiful whether they’re brand new or torn to pieces! Earn your Burnout Driver’s license by competing in over 100+ events including Races, Stunt Run, Road Rages and Marked Man. Compete against your friends for Time Road Rules and tear up the streets in Showtime, the all new destructive open world crashing experience. Looking for an online challenge, seamlessly connect with up to 7 buddies instantly, drive together cooperatively in over 300 Freeburn challenges or go head to head in custom created race routes across town. Take down your friends and grab their mugshots for your trophy room using the Xbox Live Vision Camera! \nPure \nPURE is an offroad trick-racing game featuring incredible tricks and massive, vertigo-inducing jumps. Leap hundreds of feet into the air - off mountains, over lakes and across gaping chasms in epic worldwide locations. Pull off over 70 different tricks and build over 100,000 different custom quad bikes. It's all about speed, air and incredible tricks. PURE Adrenaline! \nRayman Legends ($39.99) \nThe Glade of Dreams is in trouble once again! During a 100-year nap, the nightmares multiplied and spread, creating new monsters even more terrifying than before! These creatures are the stuff of legend… Dragons, giant toads, sea monsters, and even evil luchadores. With the help of Murfy, Rayman and Globox awake and must now help fight these nightmares and save the Teensies! \nYou'll notice that there's no price next to Pure , and that's because it's not sold online. You can check it out in the Xbox Store, but if you want to play it, you'll need the disc. \nOther than Burnout Paradise , next month's Games with Gold include Sleeping Dogs Definitive Edition (Xbox One), Outlast (Xbox One), and Outland (Xbox 360). You still have time to grab some of this month's games though, with Super Dungeon Bros (Xbox One) and Far Cry 3 Blood Dragon (Xbox 360) available until the end of the month, and Murdered: Soul Suspect (Xbox One) available until December 15.

      "title": "Calculating AUC: the area under a ROC Curve",
      "text": "Calculating AUC: the area under a ROC Curve \nby Bob Horton, Microsoft Senior Data Scientist \nReceiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves are a popular way to visualize the tradeoffs between sensitivitiy and specificity in a binary classifier. In an earlier post , I described a simple “turtle’s eye view” of these plots: a classifier is used to sort cases in order from most to least likely to be positive, and a Logo-like turtle marches along this string of cases. The turtle considers all the cases it has passed as having tested positive. Depending on their actual class they are either false positives (FP) or true positives (TP); this is equivalent to adjusting a score threshold. When the turtle passes a TP it takes a step upward on the y-axis, and when it passes a FP it takes a step rightward on the x-axis. The step sizes are inversely proportional to the number of actual positives (in the y-direction) or negatives (in the x-direction), so the path always ends at coordinates (1, 1). The result is a plot of true positive rate (TPR, or specificity) against false positive rate (FPR, or 1 - sensitivity), which is all an ROC curve is. \nComputing the area under the curve is one way to summarize it in a single value; this metric is so common that if data scientists say “area under the curve” or “AUC”, you can generally assume they mean an ROC curve unless otherwise specified. \nProbably the most straightforward and intuitive metric for classifier performance is accuracy. Unfortunately, there are circumstances where simple accuracy does not work well. For example, with a disease that only affects 1 in a million people a completely bogus screening test that always reports “negative” will be 99.9999% accurate. Unlike accuracy, ROC curves are insensitive to class imbalance; the bogus screening test would have an AUC of 0.5, which is like not having a test at all. \nIn this post I’ll work through the geometry exercise of computing the area, and develop a concise vectorized function that uses this approach. Then we’ll look at another way of viewing AUC which leads to a probabilistic interpretation. Yes, it really is the area under the curve \nLet’s start with a simple artificial data set: category <- c(1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0) prediction <- rev(seq_along(category)) prediction[9:10] <- mean(prediction[9:10]) \nHere the vector prediction holds ersatz scores; these normally would be assigned by a classifier, but here we’ve just assigned numbers so that the decreasing order of the scores matches the given order of the category labels. Scores 9 and 10, one representing a positive case and the other a negative case, are replaced by their average so that the data will contain ties without otherwise disturbing the order. \nTo plot an ROC curve, we’ll need to compute the true positive and false positive rates. In the earlier article we did this using cumulative sums of positives (or negatives) along the sorted binary labels. But here we’ll use the pROC package to make it official: library(pROC) roc_obj <- roc(category, prediction) auc(roc_obj) ## Area under the curve: 0.825 roc_df <- data.frame( TPR=rev(roc_obj$sensitivities), FPR=rev(1 - roc_obj$specificities), labels=roc_obj$response, scores=roc_obj$predictor) \nThe roc function returns an object with plot methods and other conveniences, but for our purposes all we want from it is vectors of TPR and FPR values. TPR is the same as sensitivity, and FPR is 1 - specificity (see “ confusion matrix ” in Wikipedia). Unfortunately, the roc function reports these values sorted in the order of ascending score; we want to start in the lower left hand corner, so I reverse the order. According to the auc function from the pROC package, our simulated category and prediction data gives an AUC of 0.825; we’ll compare other attempts at computing AUC to this value. Plotting the approach \nIf the ROC curve were a perfect step function, we could find the area under it by adding a set of vertical bars with widths equal to the spaces between points on the FPR axis, and heights equal to the step height on the TPR axis. Since actual ROC curves can also include portions representing sets of values with tied scores which are not square steps, we need to adjust the area for these segments. In the figure below we use green bars to represent the areas under the steps. Adjustments for sets of tied values will be shown as blue rectangles; half the area of each of these blue rectagles is below a sloped segment of the curve. \nThe function for drawing polygons in base R takes vectors of x and y values; we’ll start by defining a rectangle function that uses a simpler and more specialized syntax; it takes x and y coordinates for the lower left corner of the rectangle, and a height and width. It sets some default display options, and passes along any other parameters we might specify (like color) to the polygon function. rectangle <- function(x, y, width, height, density=12, angle=-45, ...) polygon(c(x,x,x+width,x+width), c(y,y+height,y+height,y), density=density, angle=angle, ...) \nThe spaces between TPR (or FPR) values can be calculated by diff . Since this results in a vector one position shorter than the original data, we pad each difference vector with a zero at the end: roc_df <- transform(roc_df, dFPR = c(diff(FPR), 0), dTPR = c(diff(TPR), 0)) \nFor this figure, we’ll draw the ROC curve last to place it on top of the other elements, so we start by drawing an empty graph ( type='n' ) spanning from 0 to 1 on each axis. Since the data set has exactly ten positive and ten negative cases, the TPR and FPR values will all be multiples of 1/10, and the points of the ROC curve will all fall on a regularly spaced grid. We draw the grid using light blue horizontal and vertical lines spaced one tenth of a unit apart. Now we can pass the values we calculated above to the rectangle function, using mapply (the multi-variate version of sapply ) to iterate over all the cases and draw all the green and blue rectangles. Finally we plot the ROC curve (that is, we plot TPR against FPR) on top of everything in red. plot(0:10/10, 0:10/10, type='n', xlab=\"FPR\", ylab=\"TPR\") abline(h=0:10/10, col=\"lightblue\") abline(v=0:10/10, col=\"lightblue\") with(roc_df, { mapply(rectangle, x=FPR, y=0, width=dFPR, height=TPR, col=\"green\", lwd=2) mapply(rectangle, x=FPR, y=TPR, width=dFPR, height=dTPR, col=\"blue\", lwd=2) lines(FPR, TPR, type='b', lwd=3, col=\"red\") }) Adding up the area \nThe area under the red curve is all of the green area plus half of the blue area. For adding areas we only care about the height and width of each rectangle, not its (x,y) position. The heights of the green rectangles, which all start from 0, are in the TPR column and widths are in the dFPR column, so the total area of all the green rectangles is the dot product of TPR and dFPR. Note that the vectored approach computes a rectangle for each data point, even when the height or width is zero (in which case it doesn’t hurt to add them). Similarly, the heights and widths of the blue rectangles (if there are any) are in columns dTPR and dFPR, so their total area is the dot product of these vectors. For regions of the graph that form square steps, one or the other of these values will be zero, so you only get blue rectangles (of non-zero area) if both TPR and FPR change in the same step. Only half the area of each blue rectangle is below its segment of the ROC curve (which is a diagonal of a blue rectangle). Remember the ‘real’ auc function gave us an AUC of 0.825, so that is the answer we’re looking for. simple_auc <- function(TPR, FPR){ # inputs already sorted, best scores first dFPR <- c(diff(FPR), 0) dTPR <- c(diff(TPR), 0) sum(TPR * dFPR) + sum(dTPR * dFPR)/2 } with(roc_df, simple_auc(TPR, FPR)) ## [1] 0.825 Enumerating rank comparisons \nNow let’s try a completely different approach. Here we generate a matrix representing all possible combinations of a positive case with a negative case. Each row represents a positive case, in order from the highest-scoring positive case at the bottom to the lowest-scoring positive case at the top. Similarly, the columns represent the negative cases, sorted with the highest scores at the left. Each cell represents a comparison between a particular positive case and a particular negative case, and we mark the cell by whether its positive case has a higher score (or higher overall rank) than its negative case. If your classifier is any good, most of the positive cases will outrank most of the negative cases, and any exceptions will be in the upper left corner, where low-ranking positives are being compared to high-ranking negatives. rank_comparison_auc <- function(labels, scores, plot_image=TRUE, ...){ score_order <- order(scores, decreasing=TRUE) labels <- as.logical(labels[score_order]) scores <- scores[score_order] pos_scores <- scores[labels] neg_scores <- scores[!labels] n_pos <- sum(labels) n_neg <- sum(!labels) M <- outer(sum(labels):1, 1:sum(!labels), function(i, j) (1 + sign(pos_scores[i] - neg_scores[j]))/2) AUC <- mean (M) if (plot_image){ image(t(M[nrow(M):1,]), ...) library(pROC) with( roc(labels, scores), lines((1 + 1/n_neg)*((1 - specificities) - 0.5/n_neg), (1 + 1/n_pos)*sensitivities - 0.5/n_pos, col=\"blue\", lwd=2, type='b')) text(0.5, 0.5, sprintf(\"AUC = %0.4f\", AUC)) } return(AUC) } rank_comparison_auc(labels=as.logical(category), scores=prediction) ## [1] 0.825 \nThe blue line is an ROC curve computed in the conventional manner (slid and stretched a bit to get the coordinates to line up with the corners of the matrix cells). This makes it evident that the ROC curve marks the boundary of the area where the positive cases outrank the negative cases. The AUC can be computed by adjusting the values in the matrix so that cells where the positive case outranks the negative case receive a 1 , cells where the negative case has higher rank receive a 0 , and cells with ties get 0.5 (since applying the sign function to the difference in scores gives values of 1, -1, and 0 to these cases, we put them in the range we want by adding one and dividing by two.) We find the AUC by averaging these values. AUC as probability \nThe probabilistic interpretation is that if you randomly choose a positive case and a negative case, the probability that the positive case outranks the negative case according to the classifier is given by the AUC. This is evident from the figure, where the total area of the plot is normalized to one, the cells of the matrix enumerate all possible combinations of positive and negative cases, and the fraction under the curve comprises the cells where the positive case outranks the negative one. \nWe can use this observation to approximate AUC: auc_probability <- function(labels, scores, N=1e7){ pos <- sample(scores[labels], N, replace=TRUE) neg <- sample(scores[!labels], N, replace=TRUE) # sum( (1 + sign(pos - neg))/2)/N # does the same thing (sum(pos > neg) + sum(pos == neg)/2) / N # give partial credit for ties } auc_probability(as.logical(category), prediction) ## [1] 0.8249989 Testing on a bigger example \nNow let’s try our new AUC functions on a bigger dataset. I’ll use the simulated dataset from the earlier blog post , where the labels are in the bad_widget column of the test set dataframe, and the scores are in a vector called glm_response_scores . \nThis data has no tied scores, so for testing let’s make a modified version that has ties. We’ll plot a black line representing the original data; since each point has a unique score, the ROC curve is a step function. Then we’ll generate tied scores by rounding the score values, and plot the rounded ROC in red. Note that we are using “response” scores from a glm model, so they all fall in the range from 0 to 1. When we round these scores to one decimal place, there are 11 possible rounded scores, from 0.0 to 1.0. The AUC values calculated with the pROC package are indicated on the figure. roc_full_resolution <- roc(test_set$bad_widget, glm_response_scores) rounded_scores <- round(glm_response_scores, digits=1) roc_rounded <- roc(test_set$bad_widget, rounded_scores) plot(roc_full_resolution, print.auc=TRUE) ## ## Call: ## roc.default(response = test_set$bad_widget, predictor = glm_response_scores) ## ## Data: glm_response_scores in 59 controls (test_set$bad_widget FALSE) < 66 cases (test_set$bad_widget TRUE). ## Area under the curve: 0.9037 lines(roc_rounded, col=\"red\", type='b') text(0.4, 0.43, labels=sprintf(\"AUC: %0.3f\", auc(roc_rounded)), col=\"red\") \nNow we can try our AUC functions on both sets to check that they can handle both step functions and segments with intermediate slopes. options(digits=22) set.seed(1234) results <- data.frame( `Full Resolution` = c( auc = as.numeric(auc(roc_full_resolution)), simple_auc = simple_auc(rev(roc_full_resolution$sensitivities), rev(1 - roc_full_resolution$specificities)), rank_comparison_auc = rank_comparison_auc(test_set$bad_widget, glm_response_scores, main=\"Full-resolution scores (no ties)\"), auc_probability = auc_probability(test_set$bad_widget, glm_response_scores) ), `Rounded Scores` = c( auc = as.numeric(auc(roc_rounded)), simple_auc = simple_auc(rev(roc_rounded$sensitivities), rev(1 - roc_rounded$specificities)), rank_comparison_auc = rank_comparison_auc(test_set$bad_widget, rounded_scores, main=\"Rounded scores (ties in all segments)\"), auc_probability = auc_probability(test_set$bad_widget, rounded_scores) ) )",

They pulled this off in the past with the switch from 32bit to 64bit applications, with Windows on Windows emulation and porting x86 to ARM and vice versa has been a long term project at Microsoft. \nThe possible issue that comes from this eventuality is the interface. Just like in a game ported from a gaming platform to PC, moving from an ecosystem with a limited input device to a platform designed with a mouse and keyboard will cause issues. The reverse tends to be worse, for instance Skyrim's abysmal inventory system exists specifically because it was planned to be released on consoles. Now imagine Excel or file management software trimmed down and designed specifically to run on a phablet, as well as on a PC. For more on this possible nightmare, check out The Inquirer . \n\"According to Mary-Jo Foley, the font of all knowledge Windows-wise, the company is looking at x86 emulation for ARM processors. It’s not a new idea, but it's looking likely for Redstone 3.\" \nHere is some more Tech News from around the web:",

      "text": "Mozilla Wants to Drop WoSign as Trusted CA September 27, 2016 , 2:51 pm \nSHA-1 (Secure Hash Algorithm 1) has been supported by Google, Firefox and Microsoft browsers for more than a decade. But weaknesses and theoretical collisions have been demonstrated in SHA-1, exposing users to spoofing and man-in-the-middle attacks. \nThe successor, SHA-2, addresses those concerns. But the industry has a long way to go to update, according to Venafi. It estimates 35 percent of websites (out of 11 million public websites) are still using SHA-1 certificates. \nIn a blog post , Microsoft said that its transition will impact only SHA-1 certificates that chain to a Microsoft Trusted Root certificate authority. The tech giant also attempted to allay fears over the migration saying manually installed enterprise or self-signed SHA-1 certificates will not be impacted; ensuring a smooth transition for internal corporate sites mostly located behind a company’s firewall. \nMicrosoft also said that system administrators can get a jump on testing SHA-2 readiness if they are running the November 2016 Windows Updates, including the November 2016 Preview of Monthly Quality Rollups for Windows 7/Windows 8.1. Those users can use Edge and IE 11 to test how their site will be impacted by the SHA-2 migration, Microsoft said. \nAdditionally, users that visit sites that have missed the Feb. 14, 2017 migration date will also have the option to ignore the certificate error and will be able to continue to the website in question. \nMicrosoft also clarified concerns around cross-signed certificates explaining that Windows will only check if the thumbprint of the root certificate is in Microsoft Trusted Root Certificate Program. “A certificate cross-signed with a Microsoft Trusted Root that chains to an enterprise/self-signed root would not be impacted by the changes planned for February 2017,” according to Alec Oot and Jody Cloutier both senior program managers at Microsoft. Microsoft’s SHA-1 certificate error message to be displayed after Feb. 14, 2017 on Edge and IE 11 browsers. \n“Certificate security is critical to a website’s success. All web browsers use certificates to determine what can and can’t be trusted during online transactions. This is particularly critical in transactions that include sensitive data such as ecommerce and online banking,” notes Venafi’s Scott Carter in a recent post regarding SHA-1 depreciation . \nConsequences to website owners that don’t migrate include visitors being warned of visiting insecure websites and being urged to look elsewhere for content. Browsers will not display a “green padlock” in the address bar and some sites could experience performance problems, according to Venafi. \n“Either a third of websites are frantically scrambling to replace their SHA-1 certificates or they are blissfully unaware that they may still have SHA-1 certificates they have not yet located,” Carter wrote. “I doubt that many of these websites are still unaware of the consequences.” ",

      "text": "E-mail \nAfter missing the boat on the mobile revolution, Microsoft has persistently tried to get onboard. One of the major challenges is that mobile devices tend to use ARM-based processors. This has meant Microsoft has been unable to leverage their dominance in the x86 Windows space. In order to get around this issue, it looks like Microsoft may be trying the age-old work around of a built-in emulator . \nAccording to various sources close to the project, Redmond is preparing a new Windows update, Redstone 3 which is scheduled for release in late 2017. The patch will ship with an x86 emulator for Windows on ARM named Cobalt. It appears that this will run the x86 application in a hybrid x86/ARM environment, with x86 being emulated only when necessary. This may help cut down on the emulator penalty. \nBy allowing for x86 applications to run on Windows on ARM, Microsoft will be able to make the OS more competitive. One major target of course, are business users who cannot go without their custom x86 applications. It will be interesting to see just how capable of an emulator Microsoft has and if the ARM processors will have the performance to pull it off. While emulators have helped some, like Apple, make a transition, others like BB10 could not be saved.",

D-Link chairman John Hsuan announced the partnership on Monday and dubbed the project as “Super Wi-Fi”, a worldwide infrastructure program that is entering a pilot phase beginning with a yet unnamed US state as well as three other locations in other countries. \n802.11af is a 2013 amendment to Wi-Fi as an air interface for “white space” frequencies, ranging from 54MHz to 698MHz in the US, and 490 to 790MHz in Europe, having a maximum per-channel of 35.6Mbps. Unlike the 2.4GHz band, it covers a lot more ground and is designed for links up to one kilometer in range. It does not interfere with TV transmissions as well. \nThis is not the first project Microsoft has been involved in when it comes to delivering internet connectivity to unlikely and less equipped places. Earlier in 2016, the company has announced plans to connect the entirety of India using white spaces. The project into a speed bump when dealing with the Indian government, who rejected their plea to allot unused spectrum for last-mile connectivity in extremely remote regions. Local Indian telecommunication companies saw Microsoft’s project as a threat to their business and promptly pressured the Indian government to refuse the unused spectrum to be given for free. \nMicrosoft has had success using white spaces radio before in other countries , building an emergency internet to help with disaster relief in the Philippines last year. College students in Ghana and Kenya have had similar success taking advantage of TV white spaces as well through pilots backed by Microsoft.",

      "text": "| 0 Comments \nBengaluru-based developer Brigade Enterprises has tied up with tech giants Microsoft and Intel India for its real estate-focussed accelerator programme that it started in October. \nThe developer said in a statement that, as part of the association with Microsoft Accelerator, the startups selected as part of Brigade Real Estate Accelerator Programme (REAP) will benefit from Microsoft technology expertise, mentorship and access to global markets. \nMicrosoft will also extend credits in its BizSpark programme and may provide go-to-market assistance to startups whose solutions are built on Microsoft technologies. \nFor Intel India, the collaboration will help extend its engagement with the design community. “Startups from REAP have an opportunity to leverage the Intel India Maker lab, including infrastructure, technology, tools and mentoring support from Intel technologists that it offers,” said Jitendra Chaddah, senior director of operations and strategy at Intel India. \nThe Intel India Maker Lab offers technical support, mentoring, networking opportunities as well as funding through collaborations to Indian startups. \nBrigade had launched REAP in August to mentor startups whose products and services can be used in residential real estate, office, retail or hospitality segments. Startups with capabilities in Internet of Things, nanotechnology, clean-tech and renewable, virtual and augmented reality, and logistics will be considered. The accelerator programme will also focus on firms in the B2B and B2C segment. The first batch of the programme commenced in October. \nThe REAP team is led by Nirupa Shankar, who is also the director of Brigade Group’s hospitality division. Another top executive at REAP is John Kuruvilla, who was previously the managing director of Reliance Group’s GenNext Ventures. The REAP’s mentor-in-residence is Apul Nahata, who had set up GenNext Innovation Hub, the accelerator programme run by Reliance Industries Ltd. \nLike this report?

      "text": "Netflix 4K coming to a select few PCs by  12:00 PM on November 22, 2016 \nMicrosoft has announced that Netflix 4K support is coming to a small number of Windows PCs over on its Windows Blog . Owners of 4K TVs and high-end HTPCs shouldn't get too excited, since this support has some meaningful restrictions. \nFirst, Netflix 4K streaming is supported only on seventh-generation Intel CPUs, more commonly known as Kaby Lake. These chips pack hardware support for the 10-bit HEVC encoding scheme Netflix uses for 4K content, unlike past iGPUs. \nSecond, high-resolution Netflix will require playback through Microsoft's Edge browser running on the Windows 10 Anniversary Update, something that could limit market appeal, to say the least. The popular Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox browsers do not support Microsoft's PlayReady 3.0 DRM scheme at this time. \nAccording to Ars Technica , Nvidia Pascal GPUs have support for Microsoft's PlayReady 3.0 DRM and have 10-bit HEVC hardware acceleration, but are still not on the support list for Netflix 4K streaming. So far, Kaby Lake chips are only offered in recent laptop releases. Apple's recently updated MacBook Pro laptop line does not include Kaby Lake CPUs, so those running Windows on Apple hardware will apparently have to wait until the next hardware refresh. Desktop Kaby Lake CPUs are expected to arrive in early 2017. \nFor now, despite the existence of 4K Netflix support on the PC platform, most PC owners will still have to view 4K Netflix content using set-top boxes like Amazon's Fire TV , Roku Premiere , or the Nvidia Shield .",

      "text": "Microsoft CEO Hints At ‘Ultimate Mobile Device’ By Adnan Farooqui on 11/22/2016 10:16 PST \nThere has been a lot of speculation about the future of Microsoft’s mobile business as its market share continues to dip but the company’s CEO Satya Nadella has said in a new interview that Microsoft has no plans of bowing out of this market. He may have even dropped a hint about an “ultimate mobile device” that the company may or may not be working on, but it’s too soon to be sure about that right now. \nNadella said during a recent interview that Microsoft is going to continue to be in the mobile market “not as defined by today’s market leaders, but by what it is that we can uniquely do in what is the most ultimate mobile device.” \nHe adds that even after acquiring Nokia’s hardware business, the company stopped doing things that were “me-too” and starting doing things that might be very sub-scale right now but they are “focused on a specific set of customers who need a specific set of capabilities that are differentiated and that we can do a good job of.” \nNadella also said that Microsoft doesn’t want to drive its mobile business by just the envy of what its competitors have, “the question is, what can we bring? That’s where I look at any device form factor or any technology, even AI,” he said. \nFrom the looks of it, Microsoft is just happy to wait and see how it can truly make a difference in the crowded mobile market before it decides to jump in it again. There has been a lot of speculation about the company’s Surface Phone and that still remains a possibility until and unless it’s officially rubbished as a rumor by Microsoft. \nFiled in Cellphones .

      "text": "By Adam Beck   \nFor December 2016, Microsoft is bringing their A-game for their “free” game service, Games with Gold. While the last couple of months have been a little disappointing, even though you’re most likely playing one of the big new releases, December is looking a little better with its offering. \nStarting with Xbox 360, the classic racing title Burnout Paradise and the vibrant Outland will be handed out at no additional cost. For Xbox One owners, the Hong Kong crime drama, Sleeping Dogs: Definitive Edition, and the spooky Outlast (which would have been more of a fit halfway throughout October) will be added to the collection of Xbox Gold members. \nNot a bad month, especially considering the Xbox 360 games can be played on Xbox One.

      "text": " D-Link Canada\nD-Link joins a force to provide wireless infrastructure to world's underserved regions\nMISSISSAUGA, ON , Nov. 22, 2016 /CNW/ - D-Link, Canada's leader in home networking, will partner with Microsoft in a landmark project aiming to deliver the next generation of Wi-Fi, known as \"Super Wi-Fi,\" to rural communities across the globe, announced D-Link Chairman John Hsuan as part of his D-Link Future Strategy during a press conference at the company's Taipei headquarters on Monday.\nBy aiming to tackle some of the world's greatest technology gaps, and laying down a future network in currently underdeveloped areas, the Microsoft-led mission would give communities a foundation for an enriched digital future.\nA first-phase pilot is commencing in a US state, with a further three potential countries for future stages, and is the culmination of years of research and development already invested by Microsoft and partners.\n\"Microsoft was founded on the idea of democratizing access to technology. Microsoft's current mission is to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more. For that reason, Microsoft is working with public and private sector partners around the world to develop technologies and business models that will make it easier for billions more people to affordably get online. In furtherance of these goals, Microsoft is excited to be working with D-Link on developing Super Wi-Fi technologies and an ecosystem leveraging lower-frequency TV white spaces,\" said Paul Garnett , Director of Affordable Access Initiatives, Microsoft.\nD-Link Canada President, Lou Reda , said that the company is excited to be collaborating toward the goal of connecting more of the world well into the future.\n\"We are very excited to be part of this initiative with Microsoft\", said Mr. Reda. \"Our goal as a company is to help all people better connect, locally and globally. Leveraging our 30 years of expertise and global footprint to help deliver Super Wi-Fi to the world's underdeveloped regions is a huge step in accomplishing this goal.\"\nCurrently, the fastest commercial Wi-Fi standards are based on the 802.11ac prototype, with \"11ad\" announced by some manufacturers. Super Wi-Fi is set to be based on \"11af,\" representing a protocol with a huge leap in range.\nThe Super Wi-Fi campaign aims to exploit unused bandwidth in the lower-frequency white spaces between television channel frequencies, where signal travels further than at higher frequencies.\nAbout D-Link\nCelebrating its 30th anniversary in 2016, D-Link is a global leader in connecting people, businesses and cities. We aim to connect more homes, small businesses, medium to large-sized enterprises, and service providers. D-Link implements and supports unified network solutions that integrate capabilities in switching, wireless, broadband, storage, IP surveillance, and cloud-based network management. An award-winning designer, developer, and manufacturer, D-Link has grown from a group of seven friends since its founding in 1986 in Taiwan to more than 3,000 employees worldwide.\nFor more information visit dlink.ca , or connect on Facebook ( www.facebook.com/DLinkCAN ).\n ",

      "text": "By Natalia Drozdiak\nBRUSSELS -- In a bid to win European Union antitrust approval of its $26 billion acquisition of LinkedIn Corp., Microsoft Corp. has proposed concessions that would allow rival professional social networks access to its Outlook programs, according to people familiar with the matter.\nAfter the merger, the people said, rival networks would have access to Microsoft's Outlook add-ins program -- which allows third-party tools to integrate with Outlook -- and Outlook APIs -- or application programming interface, which allows discrete programs to communicate with one another. Some of the networks already have access to those Outlook programs, they added.\nMicrosoft's Outlook offers email and calendar management.\nAmong other things, the measures proposed by Microsoft would allow for the display of profiles from other sites besides LinkedIn, such as German business-professionals network XING, in an Outlook calendar entry of a meeting between two or more people.\nIn addition, Microsoft has pledged to allow computer manufacturers such as Dell Inc. and Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co. to disable the LinkedIn shortcut on desktop devices, the people said. In an earlier EU review, Microsoft had to take steps after antitrust regulators in 2004 condemned it for bundling products into its Windows software.\nNone of the remedies, however, would offer rivals direct access to LinkedIn's pool of data -- a condition Salesforce.com Inc., which lost out to Microsoft in bidding for LinkedIn, has pressed for publicly. No outside entity currently has unlimited access to LinkedIn's data trove.\nMicrosoft announced its deal with LinkedIn in June and aims to close the transaction this year. Regulators in the U.S., Canada, and Brazil have cleared the acquisition.\nThe European Commission, the bloc's antitrust regulator, has sought comment from rivals after Microsoft submitted the concessions on the acquisition last week. Following the submission, the EU extended its deadline to Dec. 6 to complete its review of the merger. That could be extended further if the regulator still has concerns about the deal and decides to open an in-depth investigation.\nThe EU's antitrust authority, which has said it would scrutinize mergers involving large amounts of data more closely, sent out questionnaires to rivals in October posing questions about the rough value of LinkedIn's data and whether rival sites can replicate it.\nMicrosoft has argued that much of the user data on LinkedIn is also available on other social-media sites, such as Facebook Inc., and that Facebook in particular should be considered as part of the same market in the EU's review process.\nHowever, Salesforce continues to press for regulatory scrutiny. \"We believe this deal raises significant antitrust and data privacy issues,\" said Burke Norton, Salesforce's chief legal officer.\nMr. Norton wrote in an October blog post that the issue is not whether Microsoft allows other service providers to integrate their offerings with its products and services, but \"the much richer and irreproducible interactivity data, or metadata, to which Microsoft alone will have access.\" Microsoft's exclusive access to that information, Salesforce contends, will confer an unfair advantage over competitors.\n--Rachael King contributed to this article.\nWrite to Natalia Drozdiak at natalia.drozdiak@wsj.com\n 13:28 ET (18:28 ",

      "text": "Microsoft announces the free Games with Gold titles for December 2016, which includes Sleeping Dogs: Definitive Edition , Outlast , and Burnout Paradise . Every month, Xbox Live Gold subscribers can look forward to four free games spread evenly across Xbox 360 and Xbox One. Microsoft has now revealed what games fans can look forward to next month, which should be a relatively strong month for the Xbox Games with Gold program with plenty of variety.\nStarting December 1st and until December 31st, Gold subscribers can download Sleeping Dogs: Definitive Edition free of charge. A remaster of the underrated open world action from the now-defunct United Front Games , Sleeping Dogs: Definitive Edition boasts generally improved gameplay, graphics, and audio when compared to the original, not to mention three story expansions that greatly expand on the experience. The demise of United Front Games means we probably won’t see a true sequel, but it’s still a game worth checking out for fans of the open world action game genre.\nFor those that are more into horror games, the game being added from December 16th to January 15th may be a bit more interesting. From those dates, Gold subscribers will have the chance to download Outlast , a creepy first-person horror game that was well-received at the time of its release. It’s possible Microsoft is making the original Outlast one of the free Games with Gold games for December to hype players for the upcoming sequel .\n\nSleeping Dogs: Definitive Edition and Outlast are solid games, but things aren’t looking too shabby on the Xbox 360 side of things either. The first game Xbox 360 owners can look forward to is Outland , an innovative side-scroller with some Metroidvania elements, which will be free to download from December 1st to December 15th. And has been the case for months now, this means that Xbox One owners will be able to download and play Outland for free in December as well.\nXbox One’s backward compatibility with Xbox 360 games also extends to the second 360 offering in December. From December 16th to December 31st, fans will have the chance to download the critically-acclaimed Burnout Paradise for free. Burnout Paradise was actually one of the first games teased for the backward compatibility lineup , so it’s nice that it’s finally debuting on the service, and that it will be free for all Gold subscribers.\nBurnout Paradise coming to the lineup of free Games with Gold games in December should go a long way in rejuvenating the game’s online multiplayer community. While they wait to jump back into the online racing world of Burnout Paradise , however, gamers should be sure to download November 2016’s free Games with Gold games before they expire.\nXbox ‘s next Games with Gold period begins on December 1st.\nSource: Xbox ",

      "text": "By Natalia Drozdiak\nBRUSSELS -- In a bid to win European Union antitrust approval of its $26 billion acquisition of LinkedIn Corp., Microsoft has proposed concessions that would allow rival professional social networks access to its Outlook programs, according to people familiar with the matter.\nMicrosoft has offered to allow other professional social networks access to its Outlook add-in program and Outlook APIs (or application programming interface, which allow various programs to communicate with one another) following its merger with LinkedIn, the people said. Some of the rival networks already have access to those Outlook programs, they added.\nThe safeguards would, for example, allow the display of profiles from other sites besides LinkedIn, such as German business professionals' network XING, into an Outlook calendar entry of a meeting between two or more people.\nIn addition, Microsoft has pledged to allow manufacturers such as Dell Inc. and Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co. to disable the LinkedIn shortcut on desktop devices, the people said. An EU antitrust decision in 2004 condemned Microsoft for bundling products into its Windows software.\nNone of the remedies, however, would offer rivals direct access to LinkedIn's pool of data -- a condition Salesforce.com Inc., which lost to Microsoft in its bid for LinkedIn, has publicly pressed for. However, no outside entity currently has unlimited access to LinkedIn's data trove, people familiar with the matter have said.\nThe European Commission, the bloc's antitrust regulator, has sought comment from rivals after Microsoft submitted the remedies last week.\nThe EU's current deadline to complete the review is set for Dec. 6 but that could be extended if the regulator still has concerns about the deal and decides to open an in-depth investigation.\nThe EU's antitrust authority, which has said it would scrutinize mergers involving large amounts of data more closely, sent out questionnaires to rivals in October posing questions about the rough value of LinkedIn's data and whether rival sites can replicate it.\nMicrosoft has argued that much of the user data on LinkedIn is also found on other social-networking sites, including Facebook Inc., which should therefore also be considered as part of the same market in the EU's review process.\nWrite to Natalia Drozdiak at natalia.drozdiak@wsj.com\n 10:06 ET (15:06 ",

      "text": "Microsoft Offers EU Concessions on Outlook Access --Update  28:  By Natalia Drozdiak \nBRUSSELS -- In a bid to win European Union antitrust approval of its $26 billion acquisition of LinkedIn Corp., Microsoft Corp. has proposed concessions that would allow rival professional social networks access to its Outlook programs, according to people familiar with the matter. \nAfter the merger, the people said, rival networks would have access to Microsoft's Outlook add-ins program -- which allows third-party tools to integrate with Outlook -- and Outlook APIs -- or application programming interface, which allows discrete programs to communicate with one another. Some of the networks already have access to those Outlook programs, they added. \nAmong other things, the measures proposed by Microsoft would allow for the display of profiles from other sites besides LinkedIn, such as German business-professionals network XING, in an Outlook calendar entry of a meeting between two or more people. \nIn addition, Microsoft has pledged to allow computer manufacturers such as Dell Inc. and Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co. to disable the LinkedIn shortcut on desktop devices, the people said. In an earlier EU review, Microsoft had to take steps after antitrust regulators in 2004 condemned it for bundling products into its Windows software. \nNone of the remedies, however, would offer rivals direct access to LinkedIn's pool of data -- a condition Salesforce.com Inc., which lost out to Microsoft in bidding for LinkedIn, has pressed for publicly. No outside entity currently has unlimited access to LinkedIn's data trove. \nMicrosoft announced its deal with LinkedIn in June and aims to close the transaction this year. Regulators in the U.S., Canada, and Brazil have cleared the acquisition. \nThe European Commission, the bloc's antitrust regulator, has sought comment from rivals after Microsoft submitted the concessions on the acquisition last week. Following the submission, the EU extended its deadline to Dec. 6 to complete its review of the merger. That could be extended further if the regulator still has concerns about the deal and decides to open an in-depth investigation. \nThe EU's antitrust authority, which has said it would scrutinize mergers involving large amounts of data more closely, sent out questionnaires to rivals in October posing questions about the rough value of LinkedIn's data and whether rival sites can replicate it. \nMicrosoft has argued that much of the user data on LinkedIn is also available on other social-media sites, such as Facebook Inc., and that Facebook in particular should be considered as part of the same market in the EU's review process. \nHowever, Salesforce continues to press for regulatory scrutiny. \"We believe this deal raises significant antitrust and data privacy issues,\" said Burke Norton, Salesforce's chief legal officer. \nMr. Norton wrote in an October blog post that the issue is not whether Microsoft allows other service providers to integrate their offerings with its products and services, but \"the much richer and irreproducible interactivity data, or metadata, to which Microsoft alone will have access.\" Microsoft's exclusive access to that information, Salesforce contends, will confer an unfair advantage over competitors. \n--Rachael King contributed to this article. \nWrite to Natalia Drozdiak at natalia.drozdiak@wsj.com  161328ET  ",
