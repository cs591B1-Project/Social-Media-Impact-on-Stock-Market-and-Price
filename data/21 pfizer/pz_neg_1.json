      "text": "No October surprise here. AbbVie’s Humira is once again the top-spending TV pharma advertiser for the month. However, maybe just a little surprising is that its spending of $39.1 million was up 85% year-over-year from last October’s list-topping $21.1 million, according to data from real-time TV ad tracker iSpot.tv.\nAbbVie has been spending aggressively for Humira on TV and in overall advertising for the past several years, in whats seems to be a lead-up to the drug's U.S. patent expiration at the end of this year. Not that the drugmaker is folding without a fight. AbbVie has already struck back at Humira’s first approved biosimilar competitor, filing a patent infringement lawsuit against Amgen in August.\nTotal TV spending for all the pharma ads in the top 10 this month was $193 million, a 62% jump over last month’s total of $140 million.\nTwo newcomers to the top group came in at the bottom on the chart--Nos. 9 and 10, both Eli Lilly drugs. At No. 9 is its new psoriasis fighter Taltz, with a TV campaign that launched in October. At No. 10 is diabetes treatment Trulicity, with new TV creative that continues the theme of the first TV campaign launched a year ago.\n1. Humira\nMovement: Stayed the same\nWhat is it?

      "text": "Pfizer's 3Q16 Earnings Surpasses Analysts' Estimates PART 3 OF 6 This Contributed to Pfizer’s Growth in 3Q16 By Mike Benson | Nov 4, 2016 7:17 pm EST Understanding growth contributors \nPfizer’s ( PFE ) key performers in the product portfolio include Lyrica, Ibrance, Xeljanz, and Eliquis from its Innovative Health business. Positive growth contributors \nPfizer saw a 2% rise in Lyrica revenues at $1.24 billion in 3Q16, as compared to $1.22 billion in 3Q15, primarily due to a 12% rise in sales in the US markets, offset by a 12% fall in sales in international markets. \nIbrance, the new blockbuster drug to treat advanced breast cancer, was launched in February 2015 and reported revenues of $550 million in 3Q16, as compared to $230 million in 3Q15, due to the strong response from the healthcare practitioners. \nXalkori and Xeljanz achieved sales of $140 million and $235 million, respectively, during 3Q16. Xalkori’s revenue grew 14% while Xeljanz’s revenue rose ~85% YoY (year-over-year) in 3Q16. Other drugs \nChantix-Champix revenues rose ~24% to $198 million in 3Q16, as compared to $159 million in 3Q15. EpiPen, one of the key products of Mylan ( MYL ) contains a drug manufactured by Pfizer. Pfizer reported a 3% rise in EpiPen revenues at $110 million for 3Q16. \nAlliance revenues rose ~20% at $419 million in 3Q16, as compared to $349 million in 3Q15. Alliance revenues include Eliques, Rebif, Spiriva, and Aricept. Overall, the Alliance revenues have fallen over past few years due to the expiration of Enbrel and Spiriva collaborations. \nKey products contribute major revenues for any pharmaceutical company. For example, Humira, a product for arthritis is the major revenue contributor for AbbVie ( ABBV ). Humalog and Cymbalta are among the seven key drugs offered by Eli Lilly ( LLY ), contributing over $1 billion revenue annually. Crestor and Nexium are among four key products offered by AstraZeneca (AZN) contributing over $1 billion revenue annually. \nTo divest risk, investors can consider ETFs like the Vanguard Health Care ETF ( VHT ), which has ~6.3% of its total assets in Pfizer. {\"metrics\":[\"Open\"],\"tickers\":[\"PFE\",\"LLY\",\"ABBV\",\"VHT\",\"AZN\"],\"ticker_names\":[\"Pfizer Inc.\",\"Eli Lilly & Co.\",\"AbbVie Inc.\",\"Vanguard Health Care ETF\",null]} X",

      "text": "Pfizer's 3Q16 Earnings Surpasses Analysts' Estimates PART 2 OF 6 Pfizer’s 3Q16 Earnings: Revenue Stream By Mike Benson | Nov 4, 2016 7:17 pm EST Pfizer’s growth rate \nPfizer ( PFE ) reported an increase of ~10% in revenues in constant currencies for 3Q16 over 3Q15. The company’s 3Q16 revenues were $13.04 billion, meeting estimates of $13.04 billion. \nThe above graph shows Pfizer’s revenue changes in each quarter. It’s clear that foreign exchange rates have had a constant negative impact on growth rate, as nearly 50% of total revenues for Pfizer are from sales outside the US. The company has over 500 subsidiaries in operations throughout the world. Revenues by segment \nThe revenue share from the Innovative Health segment rose to ~56.2% of total revenues in 3Q16, up from ~55.8% of total revenues in 3Q15. But the revenue share from the Essential Health segment fell to ~43.8% of total revenues in 3Q16, down from ~44.2% in 3Q15. \nInnovative Health’s revenues rose 10% operationally to ~$7.3 billion in 3Q16, as compared to ~$6.8 billion in 3Q15, primarily due to rising sales of Lyrica, Chantix-Champix, Xeljanz, and Xalkori as well as a strong performance of new products. \nEssential Health’s revenues rose 10% operationally to ~$5.7 billion in 3Q16, as compared to ~$5.3 billion in 3Q15. These revenues were mainly driven by rising revenues from sterile injectable pharmaceuticals, partially offset by lower sales of Celebrex and Zyvox in the US markets due to the patent expiry, and Lyrica in European markets. \nTo divest risk, investors can consider ETFs like the Vanguard Health Care ETF ( VHT ) has ~6.3% of its total assets in Pfizer, ~2.8% in Allergan ( AGN ), ~3.9% in Amgen ( AMGN ), ~2.8% in Bristol-Myers Squibb ( BMY ), and ~5.3% in Merck ( MRK ). {\"metrics\":[\"Open\"],\"tickers\":[\"PFE\",\"VHT\",\"AGN\",\"BMY\",\"MRK\"],\"ticker_names\":[\"Pfizer Inc.\",\"Vanguard Health Care ETF\",\"Allergan, Inc.\",\"Bristol Myers Squibb Co.\",\"Merck & Co., Inc.\"]} X",

By: Sajan C Kumar | Chennai | Published: November 9, 2016 6:30 AM \nUS pharmaceutical giant Pfizer has received a shot in the arm with the company securing two Indian process patents related to its blockbuster drug Etanercept, marketed under the brand name Enbrel in countries like the US. Pfizer got the grant of patents, after successfully getting past the pre-grant oppositions filed by drug companies Mylan and Biocon. Enbrel is used to treat autoimmune diseases including rheumatic arthritis. \nPfizer Ireland Pharmaceuticals, part of Pfizer, had in 2007 filed two separate applications related to patent for Enbrel, one titled ‘Production of Polypeptides’ and another for the production of Tnfr-Ig Fusion Protein. According to sources close to Pfizer, the applications were for the process patents for Enbrel and were subsequently opposed by Mylan and Biocon. \nAfter hearing the arguments of opposing pharma companies, Nilanjana Mukherjee, assistant controller of patents and designs, Delhi, dismissed the contentions put forth by both companies and granted the patents. Mylan had mainly sought the patent authority to refuse the application based on grounds including lack of novelty and obviousness. \nBiocon argued that the ‘claimed inventions’ were non-patentable and there was lack of sufficient disclosure. Biocon charged that Pfizer was trying for effecting double patenting as an attempt to secure multiple patents relating to same invention. However, in detailed separate orders for each pre-grant opposition, the assistant controller dismissed all the objections raised by Mylan and Biocon. \nOn the issue of double patenting, the patent office said the scope covered by both patent applications were different. The inventions claimed in both the applications were patentably distinct and do not involve any issue of ever greening or double patenting. Pfizer has a co-marketing tie-up with Amgen to sell Enbrel, used for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis and plaque psoriasis, in the US and Canada. \nEnbrel is a soluble form of a tumor necrosis factor receptor with a clinical efficacy and safety profile established over 15 years of collective clinical experience. The drug was first approved in 1998 for moderate-to-severe rheumatoid arthritis, in 1999 to treat moderate-to-severe polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis and in 2002 to treat psoriatic arthritis. \nSubsequently in 2003, it was approved for the treatment of patients with ankylosing spondylitis, and in 2004 to treat moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis in adults. \nRecently, Amgen announced that the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the supplemental biologics licence application for the expanded use of Enbrel (Etanercept), making it the first and only systemic therapy to treat pediatric patients between the age of 4 and 17 with chronic moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis.

      "text": "By Ben Levisohn BMO’s Alex Arfaei explains why   is good news for Pfizer ( PFE ) and other big pharmaceutical companies he covers like AbbVie ( ABBV ), Bristol-Myers Squibb ( BMY ), Eli Lilly ( LLY ), and Merck ( MRK ):\nGetty Images We view a Trump presidency , Republican controlled congress , and apparent defeat of CA Prop 61 as significantly positive developments for major Pharma because they should lead to 1) lower drug pricing pressure in the U.S., 2) potential repeal of Obamacare with more industry friendly reforms, 3) increased probability for lower corporate tax rates, and profit repatriation, which should in turn lead to increased capital returned to shareholders and more M&A. We see the news as positive for our entire coverage universe, particularly for Pfizer.\nWe see increased probability of lower corporate taxes and profit repatriation, which should lead to increased capital returned to shareholders in the form of dividends and share buybacks. Mr. Trump plans to lower corporate tax rate from 35% to 15%, keep the R&D tax credit, and allow for repatriation of profits at a one-time tax rate of 10%. The odds of progress on these proposals is higher with a Republican controlled congress. We believe that if these proposals materialize, they would also increase the probability of consolidation in BioPharma. We see these as a tailwind for our coverage universe, particularly for Pfizer, which has considerable cash ex-US and facing significant headwinds for its key growth driver.\nShares of Pfizer have jumped 7.7% to $32.32 at 11:43 a.m. today, while AbbVie has climbed 6.9% to $62.88, Bristol-Myers Squibb has rallied 7% to $56.89, Eli Lilly has gained 6% to $78.49, and Merck has risen 6.4% to $64.36.",

      "text": "Markets Today How to Trade the Most Active Stocks After Trump's Win -- Pfizer, BofA, Facebook Here's a technical look at how to trade some of the most active stocks on the market right now. Jonas Elmerraji Nov9,201612:23PMEST \nSo the election is over and Donald Trump is the president-elect. Time to put down the 10-K filings and the stock screeners and take a break from the traditional methods of generating investment ideas. Instead, let the crowd do it for you. \nFrom hedge funds to individual investors, scores of market participants are turning to social media to figure out which stocks are worth watching. It's a concept that's known as \"crowdsourcing,\" and it uses the masses to identify emerging trends in the market. \nCrowdsourcing has long been a popular tool for the advertising industry, but it also makes a lot of sense as an investment tool. After all, the market is completely driven by the supply and demand, so it can be valuable to see what names are trending among the crowd. \nWhile some fund managers are already trying to leverage social media resources like Twitter to find algorithmic trading opportunities, for most investors, crowdsourcing works best as a starting point for investors who want a starting point in their analysis. \nSo, today, we'll leverage the power of the crowd to take a look at some of the most active stocks on the market... \nBank of America Nearest Support: $16.50 Catalyst: Trump Win \nBank of America ( BAC ) is topping the list of the market's most-active stocks once again today, boosted more than 4% on huge volume this afternoon thanks to speculation that Donald Trump's presidential win could come with looser regulations on banks and more pressure on Janet Yellen and the Federal Reserve to increase interest rates at a faster pace. Bank of America is leading the rest of the financial sector higher this afternoon. \nThe outperformance from Bank of America isn't totally surprising given this stock's technical trajectory coming into today's financial sector rally. BofA has been in a well-defined uptrend since July, and shares are testing new 52-week highs at $18 this afternoon. From a relative strength standpoint, Bank of America continues to look like a stock that investors should want to own in the months ahead. Prev 0 of 7  ",

      "text": "Pfizer ($PFE) will close a couple of plants in the U.K., with more than 370 jobs on the line, but the U.S. company wants everyone to know that its exit from the U.K. has nothing to do with the U.K.’s exit from the EU.\nThe company will close a legacy Hospira aseptic services plant at Park Royal in North London , probably by next May, the company said in an emailed statement today. While 100 jobs are being cut there, a spokesperson said that workers are expected to have a shot at a “limited number of positions elsewhere within Pfizer.”\nIt also will wind down operations at a Pfizer cold-chain packaging and distribution site in Havant in the south of England by the end of 2020. It said there are 270 people currently work there and that Pfizer, where possible, will mitigate jobs losses tat that plant.\nThe company said the decision followed a review of its supply needs and specifically pointed out it had nothing to do with the changing economic and political situation there. “It is important to note that these proposals are in no way related to the result of the Brexit decision,” Pfizer said.\nThe U.K. earlier this year voted in favor of leaving the European Union, bringing concerns that some drugmakers might flee the country. U.K. based AstraZeneca ($AZN) and GlaxoSmithKline ($GSK) have both assured leaders there they intend to stay put. GSK has even announced about $360 million in investments in plants there.\nThe $15 billion buyout of sterile drug maker Hospira last year has boosted the New York-based company’s top line but Pfizer has been rejiggering its production and distribution networks since the deal to also help its bottom line. That has led to planned closure of a number of plants in the U.S. and job losses there.\nPfizer will trim legacy Hospira logistics centers in Atlanta, Dallas, Los Angeles and King of Prussia, PA, by Q2 2017 and cutting 104 jobs with those closures. Another 100 jobs will be lost by 2019 when Pfizer shutters a 50,000-square-foot Hospira manufacturing facility in Boulder, CO, that it has said is underutilized.\nPfizer is also in the process of offloading Hospira’s pumps and devices business, a unit that falls outside the scope of its traditional drug business.",

      "title": "GSK sues Pfizer for men B vaccine patent infringement in Ireland",
      "text": "A top court in Ireland will hear claims brought by GlaxoSmithKline that Pfizer’s competing meningitis vaccine infringes on its Bexsero patents, according to a local report. For GSK, the suit follows a “fantastic” quarter for its fast-growing men B shot, an important growth cog acquired in its massive Novartis asset swap.\nThe Irish Times reports that the country’s Commercial Court will hear a case brought by GSK claiming that Pfizer’s Trumenba breaches four Bexsero patents. Among other requests, the London-based pharma company has asked the court for an injunction and damages, according to the newspaper. GSK has also asked the court to force Pfizer to destroy or forfeit vaccines it's made, the publication notes.\nPfizer confirmed the action in a statement to FiercePharma , further saying it believes GSK's \"patents are invalid and not infringed.\" The New York pharma \"will pursue the action vigorously,\" according to a spokesperson. GSK didn't return a request for comment at editorial deadline.\nIn GSK’s most recent quarterly results, Bexsero more than doubled global revenues versus last year’s third quarter to £133 million ($164 million). But execs think the shot’s potential is just getting tapped, as they told analysts on a conference call. GSK is “in very, very early days of this marketplace,” CEO Andrew Witty said at the time.\nTo accommodate the vaccine’s potential--and in the face of increasing demand--GSK plans to sock money into a “multiyear” supply chain program to beef up capacity. Earlier this year, private clinics in the U.K. experienced a shortage that GSK cleared up in March.\nSo far, the U.K., Spain and Italy have been important markets for Bexsero, among other countries, Witty said on the third-quarter call.\nFor its part, Pfizer’s vaccines unit relies on the big-selling Prevnar family of vaccines much more than Trumenba, which actually beat out Novartis to securing FDA approval back in 2014. In third-quarter results, Pfizer's vaccines failed to match the growth posted by other top players in the space. Pfizer manufactures Trumenba in Ireland, according to the Irish Times report.",

      "text": "Source: Thinkstock November 9, 2016: Markets opened lower again Wednesday following the unexpected results of Tuesday’s election. Overnight DJIA futures dropped some 800 points at one point, but equities gained strength throughout the day led by financials, healthcare, and industrials. The consumer staples sector, along with real-estate and utilities, traded lower late in the day. WTI crude oil for December delivery settled at $45.27 a barrel, up 0.6% for the day. December gold dropped less than 0.1% on the day to settle at $1,273.50. Equities were headed for a higher close before the bell as the DJIA traded up 1.39% for the day, the S&P 500 traded up 1.06%, and the Nasdaq Composite traded up 0.94%.\nThe DJIA stock posting the largest daily percentage gain ahead of the close Wednesday was Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) which traded up 8.53% at $32.56. The stock’s 52-week range is $28.25 to $37.39. Volume was nearly 5 times the daily average of around 20 million shares. Unlike hospital stocks that dived on the near-certain end of Obamacare, drug stocks soared on expectations of higher pricing following Tuesday’s elections.\nCaterpillar Inc. (NYSE: CAT) traded up 7.68% at $91.18. The stock’s 52-week range is $56.36 to $93.20, and the high was posted today. Trading volume was nearly 4 times the daily average of around 4.4 million. The company had no news, but the possibility of a revivified coal industry in the U.S. put some air under the Cat today.\nMerck & Co. Inc. (NYSE: MRK) traded up 6.60% at $54.51. The stock’s 52-week range is $47.97 to $65.00, a new high set today. Volume was about double the daily average of around 9.8 million shares. Another drug company soars on election results.\nThe Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (NYSE: GS) traded up 5.91% at $192.68. The stock’s 52-week range is $138.20 to $198.93. Volume of about 6.7 million was more than double the daily average of around 2.5 million shares. Financial stocks also got a boost from Tuesday’s election results.\nOf the Dow 30 stocks 23 are on track to close higher Wednesday and 7 are set to close lower.\nI'm interested in the Newsletter Get Newsletter \nterms and conditions   ",

      "text": "By Ben Levisohn BMO’s Alex Arfaei explains why Donald Trump’s victory is good news for Pfizer ( PFE ) and other big pharmaceutical companies he covers like AbbVie ( ABBV ), Bristol-Myers Squibb ( BMY ), Eli Lilly ( LLY ), and Merck ( MRK ):\nGetty Images We view a Trump presidency , Republican controlled congress , and apparent defeat of CA Prop 61 as significantly positive developments for major Pharma because they should lead to 1) lower drug pricing pressure in the U.S., 2) potential repeal of Obamacare with more industry friendly reforms, 3) increased probability for lower corporate tax rates, and profit repatriation, which should in turn lead to increased capital returned to shareholders and more M&A. We see the news as positive for our entire coverage universe, particularly for Pfizer.\nWe see increased probability of lower corporate taxes and profit repatriation, which should lead to increased capital returned to shareholders in the form of dividends and share buybacks. Mr. Trump plans to lower corporate tax rate from 35% to 15%, keep the R&D tax credit, and allow for repatriation of profits at a one-time tax rate of 10%. The odds of progress on these proposals is higher with a Republican controlled congress. We believe that if these proposals materialize, they would also increase the probability of consolidation in BioPharma. We see these as a tailwind for our coverage universe, particularly for Pfizer, which has considerable cash ex-US and facing significant headwinds for its key growth driver.\nShares of Pfizer have jumped 7.7% to $32.32 at 11:43 a.m. today, while AbbVie has climbed 6.9% to $62.88, Bristol-Myers Squibb has rallied 7% to $56.89, Eli Lilly has gained 6% to $78.49, and Merck has risen 6.4% to $64.36.",

      "text": "Deals | Wed Nov 9, 2016 | 6:46pm EST Exclusive: Pfizer weighs sale or spin-off of consumer health unit - sources The Pfizer logo is seen at their world headquarters in Manhattan, New York, U.S., August 1, 2016. REUTERS/Andrew Kelly - RTSKM4G By Lauren Hirsch , Olivia Oran and Carl O'Donnell \nU.S. drugmaker Pfizer Inc is evaluating a potential sale or spin-off of its consumer health division that could value the unit at as much as $14 billion, people familiar with the matter said on Wednesday. \nA Pfizer exit from the consumer health business, which includes lip balm Chapstick and painkiller Advil, would be one of its biggest corporate moves since abandoning a $160 billion deal to buy Irish drugmaker Allergan Inc earlier this year. \nThe deliberations are still in a preliminary stage and the New York-based pharmaceutical company may opt to retain the business, the people said. \nThe people asked not to be named because they were not authorized to speak publicly about the matter. Pfizer declined to comment. \nPfizer earlier this year decided against splitting itself into two companies, one housing its patent-protected drug business and one containing its generics business. Pfizer began openly planning for a possible split in early 2014, as a way to simplify its portfolio. \nIn Pfizer's most recent quarterly earnings call, Chief Executive Officer Ian Read said that Pfizer was continually evaluating whether its consumer business, along with other business lines, was worth more in or outside the company. \nThe consumer business had annual sales of about $3.5 billion. \nIf a sale or spin-off went ahead, Pfizer would be the latest pharmaceutical company to sell its consumer business to slim down its portfolio. Consumer drugs sold over the counter have far lower margins than prescription drugs. \nIn 2014, Merck & Co Inc sold its consumer care business, including the MiraLAX laxative, to Germany's Bayer AG in a $14.2 billion deal. In early 2015, drugmakers GlaxoSmithKline PLC and Novartis AG agreed to merge their consumer health businesses through a joint venture, run by Glaxo as part of a $20 billion asset swap. \nReckitt Benckiser Group Plc's CEO, Rakesh Kapoor, last year said it would consider buying Pfizer's consumer unit if it were to come up for sale. \nPfizer has been one of most active acquirers in an otherwise sluggish year for pharmaceutical M&A. In August it bought cancer drugmaker Medivation for $14 billion. Earlier this year, it acquired dermatology company Anacor Pharmaceuticals for $5.2 billion. \n(Editing by Carmel Crimmins and Andrew Hay) Next In Deals",

      "text": "A \nREUTERS: U.S. drugmaker Pfizer Inc is evaluating a potential sale or spin-off of its consumer health division that could value the unit at as much as US$14 billion, people familiar with the matter said on Wednesday. \nA Pfizer exit from the consumer health business, which includes lip balm Chapstick and painkiller Advil, would be one of its biggest corporate moves since abandoning a US$160 billion deal to buy Irish drugmaker Allergan Inc earlier this year. \nThe deliberations are still in a preliminary stage and the New York-based pharmaceutical company may opt to retain the business, the people said. \nThe people asked not to be named because they were not authorized to speak publicly about the matter. Pfizer declined to comment. \nPfizer earlier this year decided against splitting itself into two companies, one housing its patent-protected drug business and one containing its generics business. Pfizer began openly planning for a possible split in early 2014, as a way to simplify its portfolio. \nIn Pfizer's most recent quarterly earnings call, Chief Executive Officer Ian Read said that Pfizer was continually evaluating whether its consumer business, along with other business lines, was worth more in or outside the company. \nThe consumer business had annual sales of about US$3.5 billion. \nIf a sale or spin-off went ahead, Pfizer would be the latest pharmaceutical company to sell its consumer business to slim down its portfolio. Consumer drugs sold over the counter have far lower margins than prescription drugs. \nIn 2014, Merck & Co Inc sold its consumer care business, including the MiraLAX laxative, to Germany's Bayer AG in a US$14.2 billion deal. In early 2015, drugmakers GlaxoSmithKline PLC and Novartis AG agreed to merge their consumer health businesses through a joint venture, run by Glaxo as part of a US$20 billion asset swap. \nReckitt Benckiser Group Plc's CEO, Rakesh Kapoor, last year said it would consider buying Pfizer's consumer unit if it were to come up for sale. \nPfizer has been one of most active acquirers in an otherwise sluggish year for pharmaceutical M&A. In August it bought cancer drugmaker Medivation for US$14 billion. Earlier this year, it acquired dermatology company Anacor Pharmaceuticals for US$5.2 billion. \n(Editing by Carmel Crimmins and Andrew Hay) - Reuters",

      "text": "REUTERS: U.S. drugmaker Pfizer Inc is evaluating a potential sale or spin-off of its consumer health division that could value the unit at as much as US$14 billion, people familiar with the matter said on Wednesday.\nA Pfizer exit from the consumer health business, which includes lip balm Chapstick and painkiller Advil, would be one of its biggest corporate moves since abandoning a US$160 billion deal to buy Irish drugmaker Allergan Inc earlier this year.\nThe deliberations are still in a preliminary stage and the New York-based pharmaceutical company may opt to retain the business, the people said.\nThe people asked not to be named because they were not authorized to speak publicly about the matter. Pfizer declined to comment.\nPfizer earlier this year decided against splitting itself into two companies, one housing its patent-protected drug business and one containing its generics business. Pfizer began openly planning for a possible split in early 2014, as a way to simplify its portfolio.\nIn Pfizer's most recent quarterly earnings call, Chief Executive Officer Ian Read said that Pfizer was continually evaluating whether its consumer business, along with other business lines, was worth more in or outside the company.\nThe consumer business had annual sales of about US$3.5 billion.\nIf a sale or spin-off went ahead, Pfizer would be the latest pharmaceutical company to sell its consumer business to slim down its portfolio. Consumer drugs sold over the counter have far lower margins than prescription drugs.\nIn 2014, Merck & Co Inc sold its consumer care business, including the MiraLAX laxative, to Germany's Bayer AG in a US$14.2 billion deal. In early 2015, drugmakers GlaxoSmithKline PLC and Novartis AG agreed to merge their consumer health businesses through a joint venture, run by Glaxo as part of a US$20 billion asset swap.\nReckitt Benckiser Group Plc's CEO, Rakesh Kapoor, last year said it would consider buying Pfizer's consumer unit if it were to come up for sale.\nPfizer has been one of most active acquirers in an otherwise sluggish year for pharmaceutical M&A. In August it bought cancer drugmaker Medivation for US$14 billion. Earlier this year, it acquired dermatology company Anacor Pharmaceuticals for US$5.2 billion.\n(Editing by Carmel Crimmins and Andrew Hay)\n- Reuters\nEmail More",

      "text": "Health | Thu Nov 10, 2016 | 5:33am IST Novartis, Pfizer cut prices to win UK approval for cancer drugs \nLONDON Novartis and Pfizer have won approval for two cancer drugs to be used routinely on Britain's National Health Service after offering bigger price discounts. \nThe National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) said on Thursday its draft guidance now recommended Novartis' Afinitor for certain breast cancer patients and Pfizer's Xalkori in lung cancer following the undisclosed \"larger\" discounts. \nThe move comes as NICE reappraises all drugs covered by the Cancer Drugs Fund, which was overhauled earlier this year. \nJapan's Eisai last week won a similar green light for its breast cancer drug Halaven after cutting the price for Britain's state health service. \n(Reporting by Ben Hirschler; Editing by Mark Potter) Next In Health J&J vaccine plus Gilead immune booster shows promise as HIV fighter \nCHICAGO An experimental HIV vaccine from Johnson & Johnson combined with an immune system booster from Gilead Sciences Inc showed promise at keeping the virus at bay in monkeys even after treatments had stopped, marking yet another step toward the development of a so-called functional cure for HIV.",

      "text": "So the election is over and Donald Trump is the president-elect. Time to put down the 10-K filings and the stock screeners and take a break from the traditional methods of generating investment ideas. Instead, let the crowd do it for you.\nFrom hedge funds to individual investors, scores of market participants are turning to social media to figure out which stocks are worth watching. It's a concept that's known as \"crowdsourcing,\" and it uses the masses to identify emerging trends in the market.\nCrowdsourcing has long been a popular tool for the advertising industry, but it also makes a lot of sense as an investment tool. After all, the market is completely driven by the supply and demand, so it can be valuable to see what names are trending among the crowd.\nWhile some fund managers are already trying to leverage social media resources like Twitter to find algorithmic trading opportunities, for most investors, crowdsourcing works best as a starting point for investors who want a starting point in their analysis.\nSo, today, we'll leverage the power of the crowd to take a look at some of the most active stocks on the market...\nBank of America\nNearest Resistance: $18 Nearest Support: $16.50 Catalyst: Trump Win Bank of America ( BAC ) is topping the list of the market's most-active stocks once again today, boosted more than 4% on huge volume this afternoon thanks to speculation that Donald Trump's presidential win could come with looser regulations on banks and more pressure on Janet Yellen and the Federal Reserve to increase interest rates at a faster pace. Bank of America is leading the rest of the financial sector higher this afternoon.\nThe outperformance from Bank of America isn't totally surprising given this stock's technical trajectory coming into today's financial sector rally. BofA has been in a well-defined uptrend since July, and shares are testing new 52-week highs at $18 this afternoon. From a relative strength standpoint, Bank of America continues to look like a stock that investors should want to own in the months ahead.",

REUTERS/Andrew Kelly \nLONDON U.S. drugmaker Pfizer said on Wednesday it had won approval from the European Union for its best-selling breast cancer drug Ibrance, making it the first medicine of its kind to reach the European market. \nThe decision, which had been expected following a positive recommendation from the European Medicines Agency in September, comes as Novartis readies a rival treatment called ribociclib. \nBoth drugs block enzymes known as cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 6. They are designed be used in combination with existing drugs in women whose tumors grow in response to oestrogen and whose cancer is not caused by the HER2 protein. \nSales of Ibrance, which was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in February 2015, are forecast by analysts to be some $2.1 billion in 2016, according to Thomson Reuters data. \nNovartis plans to file its rival medicine for approval worldwide this year, following promising clinical trial results. \n(Reporting by Ben Hirschler; Editing by Greg Mahlich) Next In Health News",

REUTERS/Andrew Kelly \nLONDON U.S. drugmaker Pfizer said on Wednesday it had won approval from the European Union for its best-selling breast cancer drug Ibrance, making it the first medicine of its kind to reach the European market. \nThe decision, which had been expected following a positive recommendation from the European Medicines Agency in September, comes as Novartis readies a rival treatment called ribociclib. \nBoth drugs block enzymes known as cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 6. They are designed be used in combination with existing drugs in women whose tumors grow in response to oestrogen and whose cancer is not caused by the HER2 protein. \nSales of Ibrance, which was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in February 2015, are forecast by analysts to be some $2.1 billion in 2016, according to Thomson Reuters data. \nNovartis plans to file its rival medicine for approval worldwide this year, following promising clinical trial results. \n(Reporting by Ben Hirschler; Editing by Greg Mahlich) Next In Health",

      "text": "Pharmalot, Pharmalittle: Pfizer may sell or spin off its consumer business Follow Print \nGood morning, everyone, and how are you today? Have you begun adjusting to the new realities that await? We hope so. To help us along, though, we are quaffing more cups of stimulation and enjoying the sunny view of the Pharmalot campus. Whether the glass is half full or half empty, we must persevere. Meanwhile, here are some items of interest. Hope your day goes well and do keep us in mind when something intriguing occurs. We accept secret documents … \nPfizer is evaluating the potential sale or spin-off of its consumer health division that could value the unit at as much as $14 billion , Reuters reports. The possibility comes less than two months after the drug maker decided against splitting itself into two companies — one for its patent-protected drug business and one containing its generics business. However, Pfizer did say at the time that still other operations may be shed at some point. \nMylan Pharmaceuticals disclosed that, as part of a Department of Justice investigation, “certain employees and a member of senior management” received subpoenas seeking additional information about the marketing, pricing, and sale of four drugs — “generic Cidofovir, Glipizide-metformin, Propranolol and Verapamil products” — and any communications with competitors, according to page 58 of a regulatory filing.   \nAnd on page 57 , Mylan also disclosed receiving a document request last month from the Division of Enforcement at the Securities and Exchange Commission seeking communications with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and documents concerning products sold to the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program. The company recently agreed to pay $465 million for shortchanging Medicaid over rebates for its EpiPen emergency allergy device. \nMeanwhile, Mylan also reported that it is working to finalize that settlement with the Justice Department . The deal, which some lawmakers say is insufficient, took a toll on Mylan finances. The drug maker booked a quarterly loss due to a charge related to the settlement. And wholesalers are buying fewer EpiPens as they anticipate the arrival of an authorized generic version that Mylan plans to sell at half the price. \nThe Indian Patent Office denied a patent for the Xtandi prostate cancer drug, paving the way for a generic version , the Economic Times reports. The patent was opposed on grounds of “lack of inventive step, lack of novelty, and lack of clarity and sufficiency.” The drug is the subject of a battle in the US, where consumer groups are urging federal officials to allow lower-cost versions to be made and exported to other markets. \nThe UK’s National Institute for Health and Care Excellence is recommending Novartis’s Afinitor for certain breast cancer patients and Pfizer’s Xalkori lung cancer treatment after the drug makers offered undisclosed larger discounts , PMLive writes. The move comes as NICE reappraises all drugs covered by the Cancer Drugs Fund, which was overhauled earlier this year. \nValeant Pharmaceuticals received an investigative subpoena from the California Department of Insurance in September over its ties to pharmacies and marketing, Reuters informs us. \nUS public health programs will use lower-dose vaccines administered over longer periods from 2017 if President elect Donald Trump adheres to a plan he outlined last year, inPharma-Technologist says. \nThe Senate plan to pass its version of the 21st Century Cures Act and speed new drugs and devices to market may get derailed now that President-elect Donald Trump is entering the White House, STAT writes. \nAll India Drug Action Network went to court to block a government plan to dismantle the National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority and remove or dilute price controls on essential medicines, the Economic Times reports. \nChinese regulators released guidance for the investigational new drug review process that is expected to speed approvals, according to FDA News . \nThe UK’s NICE rejected Amgen’s Kyprolis in second line multiple myeloma treatment in first draft guidance, citing uncertainties over long-term survival benefits, Pharmaphorum tells us. \nAn experimental HIV vaccine from Johnson & Johnson combined with an immune system booster from Gilead Sciences showed promise at keeping the virus at bay in monkeys even after treatments had stopped, Reuters says.

      "text": "Tweet Share LONDON, Nov 10 (Reuters) - U.S. drugmaker Pfizer said on Wednesday it had won approval from the European Union for its best-selling breast cancer drug Ibrance, making it the first medicine of its kind to reach the European market. The decision, which had been expected following a positive recommendation from the European Medicines Agency in September, comes as Novartis readies a rival treatment called ribociclib. Both drugs block enzymes known as cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 6. They are designed be used in combination with existing drugs in women whose tumours grow in response to oestrogen and whose cancer is not caused by the HER2 protein. Sales of Ibrance, which was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in February 2015, are forecast by analysts to be some $2.1 billion in 2016, according to Thomson Reuters data. Novartis plans to file its rival medicine for approval worldwide this year, following promising clinical trial results. (Reporting by Ben Hirschler; Editing by Greg Mahlich) Reblog",

      "text": "Stocks turned mixed after a soft start Wednesday as Wall Street digested news of a Trump win.\nAfter plunging more than 700 points overnight, the Dow Jones industrial average was mostly unchanged. The Nasdaq lost 0.5% and the S&P 500 eased 0.3%.\nEarly leaders in the Dow, included Pfizer ( PFE ), Caterpillar ( CAT ) and Merck ( MRK ). JPMorgan ( JPM ) and Goldman Sachs ( GS ) also outperformed.\nIBD'S TAKE : The election result was described as \"shocking\" and an upset, but the IBD/Tipp presidential tracking poll ultimately had it right .\nThe 10-year Treasury yield soared 11 basis points to 1.97%. December gold rallied around 1% to $1,286.50 an ounce.\nDrugmakers, a campaign target of Democrat Hillary Clinton due to pricing, traded generally higher. In Pfizer's industry group, Mallinckrodt ( MNK ), Shire ( SHPG ) and Allergan ( AGN ) led with gains of more than 8%.\nHospital operators, which stand to lose if President-elect Trump acts on promises to repeal the Affordable Care Act, dove deeper into their early losses. Tenet Healthcare ( THC ) toppled 26%, HCA Holdings ( HCA ) skidded 15% and Universal Health Services ( UHS ) dropped 10%.\nCoal mining stocks soared with Consol Energy ( CSX ) up 12%. Arch Coal ( ARCH ) added 8%.\nCement and construction aggregates suppliers surged, possibly on an early commitment to infrastructure and other large-scale projects by Trump. Vulcan Materials ( VMC ) and Martin Marietta ( MLM ) each swept 10% higher. Martin Marietta gapped out of a cup-shaped base with a 206.46 buy point. Vulcan gapped out of a cup-shaped base with a 127.30 buy point. Both stocks were still in buy range in early trading.\nEarly gainers in the IBD 50 included HealthEquity ( HQY ) and Eagle Materials ( EXP ) with gains of around 9%. PRA Health Sciences ( PRAH ) and Morgan Stanley ( MS ) added 5%.\nRELATED :\nClinton Vs.

      "text": "By David Morgan | WASHINGTON \nDonald Trump’s White House victory moves Apple, Pfizer, Microsoft and other big U.S. corporations much closer than they have been in years to winning a big tax break on $2.6 trillion in foreign profits. \nTax reform is shaping up as among the most fruitful areas for cooperation between Trump and his fellow Republicans, who held control in Tuesday’s elections of both the House of Representatives and the Senate. \nTrump and congressional Republicans have separate, but similar, tax reform plans. Both would slash tax rates on businesses, simplify and cut individual taxes, and let companies bring overseas profits into the country at a low tax rate, raising prospects for a sweeping deal on taxes. \nBipartisan support for corporate tax reform has been growing as multinational companies have amassed tax-deferred profits abroad and brought continuous lobbying pressure over a decade for a tax break on them. \n“On tax policy, he’s basically adopted the House blueprint as his approach,” said Rohit Kumar, co-leader of the tax policy services practice at Big Four accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers [PWC.UL]. \n“There’s a better chance that something happens next year than there has been at any point in the last several years.” \nAt the heart of the issue is a law that lets U.S. companies hold foreign profits overseas without paying U.S. corporate tax on them, unless and until those profits are brought into the United States, which is known as repatriation. \nCorporations have $2.6 trillion stashed abroad under this law. That money could be repatriated any time, but businesses choose not to because it would incur the 35 percent statutory corporate income tax. \nTrump and House Republicans, including Speaker Paul Ryan, would still need to agree on how to pay for lower corporate tax rates and on whether U.S.-based multinationals should pay U.S. taxes on future foreign profits. \nTrump and congressional Republicans would also need support for tax reform from Democrats if they intend to present the package as a benefit for the country as a whole, analysts say. \nSuch proposals have stumbled before on Democrats’ objections that they are corporate give-away, and on Republicans’ insistence that they be paired with a cut in the corporate income tax rate. \nDemocrats could still block legislation they dislike from reaching the floor of the Senate, which requires a super majority of 60 votes to advance a measure, but there are procedural maneuvers Republicans could use to bypass them. \nThe one-time surge in revenue that would result from repatriation could help fund another cornerstone of Trump’s campaign platform — a pledge to boost the economy through big investments in U.S. highways, roads, bridges, airports and seaports. \nInfrastructure spending was not a campaign priority for congressional Republicans. But a new job-creating program could appeal to Democrats and be valuable to lawmakers in the 2018 mid-term elections. \nThe four companies with the largest profits held overseas are: Apple Inc ($200 billion), Pfizer Inc ($194 billion), Microsoft Corp ($108 billion) and General Electric Co ($104 billion), according to March estimates by Citizens for Tax Justice, a corporate income tax watchdog group in Washington. (Graphic: tmsnrt.rs/2eBx2BO ). \nThe European Commission in August hit Apple with a 13 billion euro ($14.3 billion) bill for back taxes, fanning concerns among other U.S. multinationals and U.S. officials that their untaxed foreign revenues could be vulnerable to further European penalties. [nL8N1BB32W] \nApple CEO Tim Cook told an interviewer in September that he expects to repatriate billions of dollars in global profits to the United States in 2017 but did not say how. [nS8N1BD000] He said in another interview that the company would not bring money back unless there was “a fair rate” and said he was optimistic that tax reform would occur next year. \nBUSINESS SUPPORT \nThe House tax plan, which Ryan and other leading Republicans promoted throughout the campaign, would lower the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 20 percent, force multinationals to repatriate existing foreign earnings and adopt a “territorial” system that would largely end taxation of U.S. companies’ foreign income. \nTrump is calling for a steeper rate cut to 15 percent, and he has proposed a 10 percent tax rate for repatriated overseas profits held in cash, payable over a decade. \nSome are optimistic that those differences can be overcome. \n“In the end, there are no differences that can’t be solved on the tax issue,” said Republican Representative Tom Cole. \nThe House Republican plan has had significant support from business. \nKumar’s PwC advises the Alliance for Competitive Taxation, which lobbies on tax reform for over 40 companies ranging from Alcoa Inc and Cisco Systems Inc to Alphabet’s Google Inc, Procter & Gamble Co and Wal-Mart Stores Inc. \n“We know what we want,” said Dorothy Coleman, a tax policy expert at the National Association of Manufacturers, referring to a lower corporate tax rate, adopting a “modern, competitive” territorial system, and a permanent R&D credit among other wishes. \nThe House’s corporate tax plan would cut revenues by more than $890 billion over 10 years, according to the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center. The same research group says Trump’s corporate plan would reduce revenues by $2.6 trillion. \nTrump and Republicans in Congress view tax reform as a way to jump-start economic growth and job creation. \nBusiness lobbyists say that higher tax revenues from a growing economy would address much of the House plan’s shortfall. Trump advisers say revenue erosion posed by the president-elect’s plan would be overcome by growth and policy initiatives including a more aggressive approach to trade. \n(Additional reporting by Susan Cornwell; Editing by Kevin Drawbaugh and Stuart Grudgings) Share This:",

Well, the markets are still figuring out the new world under President-elect Donald Trump, as Wall Street ran at two speeds on Thursday. A rally in financials sent the Dow Jones Industrial Average to close at records, while a selloff in tech sank the Nasdaq.\nSo while the markets, investors, dealmakers and hedge funds watched the indicies run off in either direction, TheStreet and its affiliates were watching key earnings from Disney ( DIS ) , Macy's ( M ) , Nvidia ( NVDA ) , SolarCity ( SCTY ) and a host of other companies, as well as Pershing Square's investor day and OPEC's production cap that doesn't seem to actually be happening. Pfizer ( PFE ) is reportedly looking to sell a swath of over-the-counter products , including its Advil and Chapstick franchises, that could net the company $14 billion, and there was a big dip in U.S. Treasuries that could present a buying opportunity for some.\nBut that wasn't all to report today as we all continued to adjust to the post-election markets. Here are the highlights from TheStreet and its affiliates:\nMannKind is Still Too Heavy to Avoid the Afrezza Crash Landing\nMannKind ( MNKD ) bulls—the rainbow-hued unicorns of the investment world—believe the company's marketing efforts will succeed.

      "text": "A potential sale or spinoff of Pfizer's ( PFE ) consumer health unit looks like a sound move for Ian Read's pharmaceutical company after scrapping plans to split into two public companies. Such a move would likely command interest from a number of Big Pharma companies looking to bulk up their own over-the-counter units.\nPfizer's consumer health business, which operates as part of the Pfizer Innovative Health segment and is home to brands including Chapstick and Advil, could fit with a lot of pharmaceutical companies that already encompass consumer units.\nAt the same time, such a move could theoretically add to the pharma giant's existing war chest for potential transformative M&A, which looks more likely following a Republican sweep that increases the likelihood that offshore profits are repatriated to the U.S.\nThe potential buyer pool for the consumer health unit likely includes GlaxoSmithKline ( GSK ) , Johnson & Johnson ( JNJ ) and Sanofi ( SNY ) , said Damien Conover of Morningstar.\nEDITOR'S NOTE: This article was originally published by The Deal, a sister publication of TheStreet that offers sophisticated insight and analysis on all types of deals, from inception to integration. Click here for a free trial.\nGermany's Bayer ( BAYRY ) , which spent $14.2 billion for Merck's ( MRK ) unit in 2014 to add brands including Claritin allergy medication and Dr. Scholl's footcare products, would also be a logical buyer if it weren't still working to complete its $66 billion deal for Monsanto ( MON ) , he added. Meanwhile, Glaxo and Novartis ( NVS ) in 2015 fused their consumer health businesses through a joint venture to be run by Glaxo.\n\"It's one of the better consumer units out there,\" Conover said in an interview Thursday, describing the unit as solidly positioned but not \"critical\" for the New York pharma to retain. \"It's going to get a solid valuation.\"\nPfizer shares rallied about 4.7% to $33.64 Thursday after Reuters reported late Wednesday that the company is evaluating a potential sale or spinoff of its consumer health division that could value the unit at as much as $14 billion.\nPfizer spokeswoman Sally Beatty told The Deal Thursday the company doesn't comment on speculation, but noted by email that Read's comments about the unit on Pfizer's Nov. 1 third-quarter earnings call stand true.",

      "text": "WASHINGTON Donald Trump's White House victory moves Apple ( AAPL.O ), Pfizer ( PFE.N ), Microsoft ( MSFT.O ) and other big U.S. corporations much closer than they have been in years to winning a big tax break on $2.6 trillion in foreign profits.\nTax reform is shaping up as among the most fruitful areas for cooperation between Trump and his fellow Republicans, who held control in Tuesday's elections of both the House of Representatives and the Senate.\nTrump and congressional Republicans have separate, but similar, tax reform plans. Both would slash tax rates on businesses, simplify and cut individual taxes, and let companies bring overseas profits into the country at a low tax rate, raising prospects for a sweeping deal on taxes.\nBipartisan support for corporate tax reform has been growing as multinational companies have amassed tax-deferred profits abroad and brought continuous lobbying pressure over a decade for a tax break on them.\n\"On tax policy, he's basically adopted the House blueprint as his approach,\" said Rohit Kumar, co-leader of the tax policy services practice at Big Four accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers [PWC.UL].\n\"There's a better chance that something happens next year than there has been at any point in the last several years.\"\nAt the heart of the issue is a law that lets U.S. companies hold foreign profits overseas without paying U.S. corporate tax on them, unless and until those profits are brought into the United States, which is known as repatriation.\nCorporations have $2.6 trillion stashed abroad under this law. That money could be repatriated any time, but businesses choose not to because it would incur the 35 percent statutory corporate income tax.\nTrump and House Republicans, including Speaker Paul Ryan, would still need to agree on how to pay for lower corporate tax rates and on whether U.S.-based multinationals should pay U.S. taxes on future foreign profits.\nTrump and congressional Republicans would also need support for tax reform from Democrats if they intend to present the package as a benefit for the country as a whole, analysts say.\nSuch proposals have stumbled before on Democrats' objections that they are corporate give-away, and on Republicans' insistence that they be paired with a cut in the corporate income tax rate. \nDemocrats could still block legislation they dislike from reaching the floor of the Senate, which requires a super majority of 60 votes to advance a measure, but there are procedural maneuvers Republicans could use to bypass them.\nThe one-time surge in revenue that would result from repatriation could help fund another cornerstone of Trump's campaign platform -- a pledge to boost the economy through big investments in U.S. highways, roads, bridges, airports and seaports.\nInfrastructure spending was not a campaign priority for congressional Republicans. But a new job-creating program could appeal to Democrats and be valuable to lawmakers in the 2018 mid-term elections.\nThe four companies with the largest profits held overseas are: Apple Inc ($200 billion), Pfizer Inc ($194 billion), Microsoft Corp ($108 billion) and General Electric Co ( GE.N ) ($104 billion), according to March estimates by Citizens for Tax Justice, a corporate income tax watchdog group in Washington. (Graphic: tmsnrt.rs/2eBx2BO ). \nThe European Commission in August hit Apple with a 13 billion euro ($14.3 billion) bill for back taxes, fanning concerns among other U.S. multinationals and U.S. officials that their untaxed foreign revenues could be vulnerable to further European penalties.\nApple CEO Tim Cook told an interviewer in September that he expects to repatriate billions of dollars in global profits to the United States in 2017 but did not say how. He said in another interview that the company would not bring money back unless there was \"a fair rate\" and said he was optimistic that tax reform would occur next year.\n\nBUSINESS SUPPORT\nThe House tax plan, which Ryan and other leading Republicans promoted throughout the campaign, would lower the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 20 percent, force multinationals to repatriate existing foreign earnings and adopt a \"territorial\" system that would largely end taxation of U.S. companies' foreign income.\nTrump is calling for a steeper rate cut to 15 percent, and he has proposed a 10 percent tax rate for repatriated overseas profits held in cash, payable over a decade.\nSome are optimistic that those differences can be overcome. \n\"In the end, there are no differences that can't be solved on the tax issue,\" said Republican Representative Tom Cole. \nThe House Republican plan has had significant support from business. \nKumar's PwC advises the Alliance for Competitive Taxation, which lobbies on tax reform for over 40 companies ranging from Alcoa Inc ( AA.N ) and Cisco Systems Inc ( CSCO.O ) to Alphabet's Google Inc ( GOOGL.O ), Procter & Gamble Co ( PG.N ) and Wal-Mart Stores Inc ( WMT.N ).\n\"We know what we want,\" said Dorothy Coleman, a tax policy expert at the National Association of Manufacturers, referring to a lower corporate tax rate, adopting a \"modern, competitive\" territorial system, and a permanent R&D credit among other wishes.\nThe House's corporate tax plan would cut revenues by more than $890 billion over 10 years, according to the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center. The same research group says Trump's corporate plan would reduce revenues by $2.6 trillion.\nTrump and Republicans in Congress view tax reform as a way to jump-start economic growth and job creation. \nBusiness lobbyists say that higher tax revenues from a growing economy would address much of the House plan's shortfall. Trump advisers say revenue erosion posed by the president-elect's plan would be overcome by growth and policy initiatives including a more aggressive approach to trade.\n\n(Additional reporting by Susan Cornwell; Editing by Kevin Drawbaugh and Stuart Grudgings)",

REUTERS/Andrew Kelly By Kate Kelland | LONDON \nLONDON U.S. pharmaceuticals giant Pfizer is to offer its pneumococcal vaccine at the lowest possible price to non-governmental organizations seeking to protect vulnerable people from illness in humanitarian crises. \nIn what it called a major expansion of its humanitarian assistance work, the drugmaker said its Prevenar 13 shot, which protects babies and children against pneumonia and other diseases, would be offered in a new multi-dose vial at the lowest prevailing global price, currently $3.10 per dose. \n\"In addition, given the acute need for aid on the ground, Pfizer will donate all sales proceeds for the first year of this program to humanitarian groups undertaking the difficult work of reaching vulnerable populations in emergency settings,\" the company said in a statement. \nThe move follows a similar one by the British drugmaker GlaxoSmithKline, which said in September it would cut the price of its pneumococcal vaccine, Synflorix, to $3.05 when it is used in humanitarian crises. \nThe World Health Organization said last month it was seeking to establish an emergency vaccine supply system aimed at getting vital shots to vulnerable people in crises such as wars or natural disasters. \n(Editing by Greg Mahlich)",

REUTERS/Andrew Kelly By Kate Kelland | LONDON \nLONDON U.S. pharmaceuticals giant Pfizer is to offer its pneumococcal vaccine at the lowest possible price to non-governmental organizations seeking to protect vulnerable people from illness in humanitarian crises. \nIn what it called a major expansion of its humanitarian assistance work, the drugmaker said its Prevenar 13 shot, which protects babies and children against pneumonia and other diseases, would be offered in a new multi-dose vial at the lowest prevailing global price, currently $3.10 per dose. \n\"In addition, given the acute need for aid on the ground, Pfizer will donate all sales proceeds for the first year of this program to humanitarian groups undertaking the difficult work of reaching vulnerable populations in emergency settings,\" the company said in a statement. \nThe move follows a similar one by the British drugmaker GlaxoSmithKline, which said in September it would cut the price of its pneumococcal vaccine, Synflorix, to $3.05 when it is used in humanitarian crises. \nThe World Health Organization said last month it was seeking to establish an emergency vaccine supply system aimed at getting vital shots to vulnerable people in crises such as wars or natural disasters. \n(Editing by Greg Mahlich)",

      "text": "A \nLONDON: U.S. pharmaceuticals giant Pfizer is to offer its pneumococcal vaccine at the lowest possible price to non-governmental organizations seeking to protect vulnerable people from illness in humanitarian crises. \nIn what it called a major expansion of its humanitarian assistance work, the drugmaker said its Prevenar 13 shot, which protects babies and children against pneumonia and other diseases, would be offered in a new multi-dose vial at the lowest prevailing global price, currently US$3.10 per dose. \n\"In addition, given the acute need for aid on the ground, Pfizer will donate all sales proceeds for the first year of this program to humanitarian groups undertaking the difficult work of reaching vulnerable populations in emergency settings,\" the company said in a statement. \nThe move follows a similar one by the British drugmaker GlaxoSmithKline, which said in September it would cut the price of its pneumococcal vaccine, Synflorix, to US$3.05 when it is used in humanitarian crises. \nThe World Health Organization said last month it was seeking to establish an emergency vaccine supply system aimed at getting vital shots to vulnerable people in crises such as wars or natural disasters. \n(Editing by Greg Mahlich)",

      "text": "Home » News & Media » Press Releases » Pfizer Announces Major Expansion of Humanitarian Assistance Program Pfizer Announces Major Expansion of Humanitarian Assistance Program \nPrevenar 13® Vaccine Will Be Available at Lowest Price for Humanitarian Emergencies \nPfizer to Donate Sales Proceeds to Organizations Supporting the Refugee Crisis \nFriday, November 11, 2016 - 6:00am EST \nPfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) announced today a major expansion of its humanitarian assistance program enabling broader access to its vaccine, Prevenar 13, in humanitarian emergency settings by offering its new multi-dose vial (MDV) at what will be the lowest prevailing global price, currently $3.10 per dose. In addition, given the acute need for aid on the ground, Pfizer will donate all sales proceeds for the first year of this program to humanitarian groups undertaking the difficult work of reaching vulnerable populations in emergency settings. Today’s announcement of a new and specific pricing tier for civil society organizations (CSOs) working in emergency settings builds on Pfizer’s longstanding support for humanitarian emergency relief around the world. \nIn the immediate term, Pfizer will meet humanitarian emergency needs through a short-term donation of the single-dose vial of Prevenar 13, which is available for expedited delivery. \nStarting in 2017, refugees can receive the newest version of Prevenar 13, the MDV. This presentation is scheduled to be introduced early next year and contains four doses of Prevenar 13 in the same-sized vial that currently contains a single dose. This four-in-one vial is specially designed to address the unique conditions and challenges experienced in developing world settings and can help health workers in humanitarian emergencies. The MDV offers reduced cold storage and transportation requirements, helping to enable vaccination of children in humanitarian emergency situations more quickly. It has also been prequalified by the World Health Organization. \n“Pfizer is proud of the significant impact that our Prevenar 13 vaccine and our partnerships with many humanitarian organizations have had on public health across the globe. Only by putting the needs of refugees at the center, can we all work collaboratively to help prevent disease in some of the world’s most vulnerable populations,” said Susan Silbermann, President and General Manager, Pfizer Vaccines. “Our new MDV presentation is an important vaccine technology, and in combination with our expanded humanitarian assistance program, will provide critical help in addressing the potential burden of pneumococcal disease in these populations that might otherwise go unreached. We are especially pleased to donate all proceeds from these sales to civil society organizations for the first year to support the significant additional needs these groups have on the ground.” \nPfizer Humanitarian Assistance Programs \nRecognizing the critical need in settings requiring relief and emergency humanitarian assistance, Pfizer has a three-part approach which includes product donations, cash grants and other access solutions. Pfizer donations are focused on specific diseases and designed to address the needs of people in a coordinated manner. The Company works with a range of local and global partners, including governments, health care experts, and CSOs to address the most pressing unmet medical needs and determine the most effective way for a donation to meet the needs of affected communities. Pfizer supports a number of organizations working on providing relief and emergency humanitarian assistance to address refugee crises. The Pfizer Foundation provides cash grants to organizations working around the world to provide health care and other critical support to vulnerable populations. Pfizer works closely with governments and CSOs to help provide access to its vaccines and regularly engages in discussions with partners on potential new access approaches to reach as many people as possible in emergency humanitarian situations. \nFor more information on Pfizer’s Humanitarian Assistance Programs please visit http://www.pfizer.com/responsibility/global-health/relief-and-emergency-humanitarian-assistance . \nAbout Prevenar 13 ® \nPrevenar 13 ® *(pneumococcal polysaccharide conjugate vaccine [13 – valent, adsorbed]) was first approved in the European Union (EU) in December 2009 for use in infants and young children to help protect against invasive pneumococcal disease.

      "text": "By Kate Kelland\nLONDON (Reuters) - U.S. pharmaceuticals giant Pfizer is to offer its pneumococcal vaccine at the lowest possible price to non-governmental organizations seeking to protect vulnerable people from illness in humanitarian crises.\nIn what it called a major expansion of its humanitarian assistance work, the drugmaker said its Prevenar 13 shot, which protects babies and children against pneumonia and other diseases, would be offered in a new multi-dose vial at the lowest prevailing global price, currently $3.10 per dose.\n\"In addition, given the acute need for aid on the ground, Pfizer will donate all sales proceeds for the first year of this program to humanitarian groups undertaking the difficult work of reaching vulnerable populations in emergency settings,\" the company said in a statement.\nThe move follows a similar one by the British drugmaker GlaxoSmithKline, which said in September it would cut the price of its pneumococcal vaccine, Synflorix, to $3.05 when it is used in humanitarian crises.\nThe World Health Organization said last month it was seeking to establish an emergency vaccine supply system aimed at getting vital shots to vulnerable people in crises such as wars or natural disasters.\n(Editing by Greg Mahlich)",

      "text": "Back in July, I was positive on shares of Pfizer ( PFE ) . I thought the company was executing exceptionally well. Then, the stock took a dive.\nNow what?\nIn early August, Pfizer reported an OK quarter. The company said it earned 64 cents per share, 2 cents better than the consensus estimate. Revenue rose 10.9% to $13.15 billion. Management reaffirmed guidance for fiscal 2016. The stock dipped because management didn't provide any update on its Essential Health spinoff. Then, on Aug. 22, the company announced it would acquire Medivation ( MDVN ) , a biotech company focused on commercializing small molecules for oncology. Pfizer paid $81.50 a share in cash for a total of $14 billion -- a stiff 38 times 2017 estimates for the company. Management hopes the deal will jump-start its growth.\nThe high price Pfizer paid for Medivation only confirmed investors' view that Pfizer is desperate for growth . Investors freaked out and hit the sell button on the news.\nThen, a few weeks later, management really dropped a bomb. The company said it would not split its Essential Health unit from its Innovative Health division. The two divisions operate separately and investors had expected the company to spin off the slower-growing, lower-margin EH business.\nEssential Health is Pfizer's portfolio of older products and generic treatments. Off-patent drugs like Lipitor saw sales drop 8% to $422 million and Premarin sales fell 7% to $244 million. Last quarter, the EH unit posted sales of $5.7 billion, up 7%, but that includes $3.4 billion of \"other\" sales that were up 24%.",

      "text": "[ - ] Text [ + ] \nBy Lauren Hirsch, Olivia Oran and Carl O'Donnell \n(Reuters) - U.S. drugmaker Pfizer Inc is evaluating a potential sale or spin-off of its consumer health division that could value the unit at as much as $14 billion, people familiar with the matter said on Wednesday. \nA Pfizer exit from the consumer health business, which includes lip balm Chapstick and painkiller Advil, would be one of its biggest corporate moves since abandoning a $160 billion deal to buy Irish drugmaker Allergan Inc earlier this year. \nThe deliberations are still in a preliminary stage and the New York-based pharmaceutical company may opt to retain the business, the people said. \nThe people asked not to be named because they were not authorized to speak publicly about the matter. Pfizer declined to comment. \nPfizer earlier this year decided against splitting itself into two companies, one housing its patent-protected drug business and one containing its generics business. Pfizer began openly planning for a possible split in early 2014, as a way to simplify its portfolio. \nIn Pfizer's most recent quarterly earnings call, Chief Executive Officer Ian Read said that Pfizer was continually evaluating whether its consumer business, along with other business lines, was worth more in or outside the company. \nThe consumer business had annual sales of about $3.5 billion. \nIf a sale or spin-off went ahead, Pfizer would be the latest pharmaceutical company to sell its consumer business to slim down its portfolio. Consumer drugs sold over the counter have far lower margins than prescription drugs. Continued... ",

      "title": "Stocks Open With Dow At Record High; Pfizer, Taser, Kohl's Climb |",
      "text": "Stocks opened higher Thursday as earnings reports and a dip in weekly jobless claims fed into early trade.\nThe Dow industrials opened 0.7% higher and at a new record high. The Nasdaq and S&P 500 climbed 0.6. Small caps excelled in early trade, with the Russell 2000 up about 3%.\nSteel makers, coal miners, drugmakers and construction materials stocks soared Wednesday, after President-Elect Donald Trump's victory in Tuesday's U.S. presidential election. Most polls had Trump losing, but the IBD/TIPP poll correctly pointed to a Trump win.\nOn Wednesday, hospitals, solar energy stocks, alcohol distributors and electrical utilities were among the industries that saw steep losses.\nThe Nasdaq was tracking toward its first weekly gain in three weeks, up nearly 4.1%. The S&P 500 enters Thursday's session with a 3.8% gain for the week. The advance returned both indexes to above their 50-day moving averages, triggering a positive change in the market's status .\nIn Motion: Monster, Taser, NetEase, Kohl's Things had settled a bit on the Dow. Pfizer's ( PFE ) gained 4%.\nEarnings reports came back into play, with Kohl's ( KSS ) up 11%. The department store chain reported a solid third-quarter beat, confirming prior full-year guidance and increasing its share buyback initiative to $2 billion.\nTaser International ( TASR ) surged 15% as third-quarter earnings met, and revenue blew past analyst views in a report late Wednesday. The company announced Chief Financial Officer Dan Behrendt plans to exit the company following the completion of this year's 10-K filing. Taser's stock has been working to fashion a bottom in a three-month-old consolidation.\nShares of Monster Beverage ( MNST ) were adjusting to a 3-for-1 stock split that was effective at the end of trade Wednesday.\nAmong hospital operators, Tenet Healthcare ( THC ) jumped 2% as it took back a piece of Wednesday's 25% sell-off.\nIBD 50 stock NetEase ( NTES ) dropped almost 5% at the open. The China-based online games provider reported mixed third-quarter results , with a 38% gain in revenue not quite meeting analysts' targets. Morgan Stanley lifted its price target on the stock to 233, from 195, and maintained its overweight rating. The stock slid below its 50-day moving average.\nCopper Rallies, Nikkei 225 Retakes Lost Ground Oil futures slipped 1%, pulling West Texas Intermediate back below $45 a barrel, up about 3% so far for the week and steering toward the first gain in three weeks. Gold edged up to above $1,275 an ounce, but remained down 1.8% for the week. Copper prices continued to rally, up 3% for a 12% gain so far this week.\nThe dollar regained Wednesday's lost ground vs. the yen and was effectively flat against the euro. Bonds eased, lifting the 10-year yield another 4 basis points to 2.10% -- its highest level since January.\nOverseas markets were busy, with China's Shanghai Composite booking a 1.4% gain and Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index up 1.9%. In Japan, Tokyo's Nikkei 225 roared back from Wednesday's steep losses, sweeping up a 6.7% gain.\nIn Europe, stocks backed away from highs and turned mixed in afternoon action. The CAC 40 in Paris climbed held a 0.6% gain, Frankfurt's DAX was up 0.4% and the FTSE 100 in London slipped 0.3%.\nOn the economic front, weekly jobless claims declined to 254,000 in the week ended Nov. 5, the Labor Department reported. The 4% drop vs. the prior week was far below analyst estimates for only a slight decrease. The four-week moving average dropped to 259,750 -- its first decline in four weeks.\nThe Treasury Department delivers its October budget report at 2 p.m. ET. St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank President James Bullard speaks at 9:15 a.m. ET.",

      "text": "Trades from $ 3 \nAlthough some big names like AstraZeneca ( AZN - Free Report ) and Mylan ( MYL - Free Report ) reported Q3 results this week, earnings reports were overshadowed by the run-up to the Presidential election and the surprise win of Donald Trump. In fact, the pharma sector responded favorably to Trump’s victory on hopes that there will be fewer drug pricing headwinds considering Trump was not as vocal as Hillary Clinton about rising drug prices and excessive price hikes. Trump’s pro-business stand is also expected to benefit the sector. Major pharma companies should gain from Trump’s proposed tax plan and proposal to repatriate corporate profits held offshore at a one-time tax rate of 10%. Recap of the Week’s Most Important Stories Crestor Generics Hit AstraZeneca Revenues: AstraZeneca’s third quarter results were mixed with the company beating on earnings but falling short on revenues. In addition to cost management, earnings benefited from a non-recurring inter-government tax agreement as well. Shares were down following the release of Q3 results with sales being impacted by the genericization of Crestor. AstraZeneca also said that it was not likely to seek approval for its experimental immuno-oncology treatment, durvalumab, for second-line head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) based on the phase II HAWK study. The single arm study was initially designed as a potential fast-to-market opportunity for the second line indication but the company’s changed plans were based on the recent changes in the HNSCC landscape including the approval of Merck’s ( MRK - Free Report ) Keytruda for this patient population. Moreover, durvalumab was placed on partial clinical hold by the FDA in late October for HNSCC. Valeant Q3 Results Disappoint: Valeant ( VRX - Free Report ) reported disappointing Q3 results missing both earnings and revenue estimates. Valeant also slashed its outlook for 2016 (Read more: Valeant Pharma Q3 Earnings Miss, Slashes Guidance ). The company is facing several headwinds apart from the drug pricing issue and ongoing investigations into its pricing policy. Generic competition for some products, soft performance of the dermatology business, a 3-month delay in the FDA action date for brodalumab (severe psoriasis), quality challenges related to manufacturing issues (Valeant got a warning letter for its Rochester, NY site from the FDA), product recalls, and back orders are some of the issues being faced by the company. Moreover, B+L international is facing challenges in Europe due to weakness in Poland and the Middle East, especially Turkey and Egypt. Not surprisingly, earnings estimates for Valeant are seeing downward revisions following the release of Q3 results. Is Pfizer Contemplating Sale of Consumer Healthcare Unit? According to a Reuters article, Pfizer ( PFE - Free Report ) is considering the sale or spin-off of its consumer health segment for as much as $14 billion. The company’s consumer healthcare segment, which brought in sales of $2.5 billion in the first nine months of 2016, is known for products like Advil, Centrum and Chapstick among others.We remind investors that earlier this year, Pfizer had decided against splitting up its business. However, on the third quarter call on being asked about the consumer business, CEO Read had said that the company evaluates all its businesses and subjects them to tests to see whether they are worth more inside or outside Pfizer.Meanwhile, Pfizer was also in the news for the EU approval of Ibrance for a specific type of breast cancer. This makes Ibrance the first medicine in a new class of anti-cancer treatments, CDK 4/6 inhibitors, to be approved in Europe and also the first new medicine to be approved for the treatment of women with this particular type of metastatic breast cancer in the first-line setting in almost 10 years. Ibrance is one of the most promising new products in Pfizer’s portfolio and EU approval was expected considering the CHMP had issued a positive opinion in September. Ibrance sales were $1.5 billion in the first nine months of 2016.Pfizer is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here . Mylan & Partner Biocon File Herceptin Biosimilar: Mylan, which missed Q3 estimates (Read more: Mylan Q3 Earnings & Revenues Miss on EpiPen Woes ), announced the submission of a regulatory application for a biosimilar version of Roche’s ( RHHBY - Free Report ) Herceptin (trastuzumab) in the U.S. This is Mylan’s first FDA biosimilar submission, and the company believes it has the potential to be the first to seek approval for a biosimilar version of Herceptin in the U.S. Bristol-Myers Provides Updates on Opdivo, Signs Deal with Nitto: Bristol-Myers ( BMY - Free Report ) came out with several updates this week. The company gained FDA approval for its immuno-oncology treatment Opdivo for use in head and neck cancer.Opdivo also met the primary endpoint in a late-stage study for unresectable advanced or recurrent gastric cancer refractory to, or intolerant of, standard therapy. This is good news for the company as Opdivo is the first and only immuno-oncology agent to demonstrate overall survival advantage in this patient population.The company also announced a 5-year research collaboration with Johns Hopkins University for the identification of mechanisms of response and resistance in patients whose cancer is being treated with checkpoint inhibitor-based immunotherapies, including Opdivo monotherapy, or Opdivo in combination with Yervoy or other investigational immunotherapies.A clinical trial agreement was also signed with Infinity for Opdivo plus Infinity’s IPI-549 in patients with advanced solid tumors.The company has also signed an exclusive worldwide license agreement with Nitto Denko for the development and commercialization of Nitto’s investigational siRNA molecules targeting heat shock protein 47 (HSP47) in vitamin A containing formulations. The collaboration includes Nitto’s lead asset ND-L02-s0201, currently in early-stage development for the treatment of advanced liver fibrosis.The agreement will see Bristol-Myers shelling out $100 million upfront and making subsequent payments in the form of clinical and regulatory milestone payments, royalties, sales based milestone payments as well as option exercise payments for lung and other organ fibrosis. This deal once again shows pharma’s interest in developing treatments for fibrotic diseases and to develop therapies for patients living with advanced non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and cirrhosis due to NASH. Performance \nLarge Cap Pharmaceuticals Industry Price Index \nThe NYSE ARCA Pharmaceutical Index recorded a gain of 7.6% over the last five trading days reflecting a positive response to Trump’s win. Moreover, Proposition 61, California’s ballot measure to ensure that the State of California is able to negotiate with drug companies for drug prices that do not exceed the price paid for the same drugs by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, was shot down by voters.Among major pharma stocks, both Pfizer and Bristol-Myers shot up more than 12% while AstraZeneca was down slightly on Q3 results. Over the last six months, Bristol-Myers declined 20.8% while Merck was up 18.8% (See the last pharma stock roundup here: Pfizer, Allergan Q3 Results Fall Short, Insulin Drugmakers under Pricing Pressure ). \nWhat's Next in the Pharma World? Companies like Bristol-Myers will be showcasing data at the annual meeting of the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) and the Association of Rheumatology Health Professionals (ARHP) in the coming days. Bristol-Myers will also be presenting data along with Pfizer on Eliquis at the American Heart Association (AHA) Scientific Sessions 2016.

      "text": "Although some big names like AstraZeneca ( AZN - Free Report ) and Mylan ( MYL - Free Report ) reported Q3 results this week, earnings reports were overshadowed by the run-up to the Presidential election and the surprise win of Donald Trump. In fact, the pharma sector responded favorably to Trump’s victory on hopes that there will be fewer drug pricing headwinds considering Trump was not as vocal as Hillary Clinton about rising drug prices and excessive price hikes. Trump’s pro-business stand is also expected to benefit the sector. Major pharma companies should gain from Trump’s proposed tax plan and proposal to repatriate corporate profits held offshore at a one-time tax rate of 10%.\n\nRecap of the Week’s Most Important Stories \n\nCrestor Generics Hit AstraZeneca Revenues: AstraZeneca’s third quarter results were mixed with the company beating on earnings but falling short on revenues. In addition to cost management, earnings benefited from a non-recurring inter-government tax agreement as well. Shares were down following the release of Q3 results with sales being impacted by the genericization of Crestor. AstraZeneca also said that it was not likely to seek approval for its experimental immuno-oncology treatment, durvalumab, for second-line head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) based on the phase II HAWK study. The single arm study was initially designed as a potential fast-to-market opportunity for the second line indication but the company’s changed plans were based on the recent changes in the HNSCC landscape including the approval of Merck’s ( MRK - Free Report ) Keytruda for this patient population. Moreover, durvalumab was placed on partial clinical hold by the FDA in late October for HNSCC.\n\nValeant Q3 Results Disappoint: Valeant ( VRX - Free Report ) reported disappointing Q3 results missing both earnings and revenue estimates. Valeant also slashed its outlook for 2016 (Read more: Valeant Pharma Q3 Earnings Miss, Slashes Guidance ). The company is facing several headwinds apart from the drug pricing issue and ongoing investigations into its pricing policy. Generic competition for some products, soft performance of the dermatology business, a 3-month delay in the FDA action date for brodalumab (severe psoriasis), quality challenges related to manufacturing issues (Valeant got a warning letter for its Rochester, NY site from the FDA), product recalls, and back orders are some of the issues being faced by the company. Moreover, B+L international is facing challenges in Europe due to weakness in Poland and the Middle East, especially Turkey and Egypt. Not surprisingly, earnings estimates for Valeant are seeing downward revisions following the release of Q3 results.\n\nIs Pfizer Contemplating Sale of Consumer Healthcare Unit? According to a Reuters article, Pfizer ( PFE - Free Report ) is considering the sale or spin-off of its consumer health segment for as much as $14 billion. The company’s consumer healthcare segment, which brought in sales of $2.5 billion in the first nine months of 2016, is known for products like Advil, Centrum and Chapstick among others.\n\nWe remind investors that earlier this year, Pfizer had decided against splitting up its business. However, on the third quarter call on being asked about the consumer business, CEO Read had said that the company evaluates all its businesses and subjects them to tests to see whether they are worth more inside or outside Pfizer.\n\nMeanwhile, Pfizer was also in the news for the EU approval of Ibrance for a specific type of breast cancer. This makes Ibrance the first medicine in a  new class of anti-cancer treatments, CDK 4/6 inhibitors, to be approved in Europe and also the first new medicine to be approved for the treatment of women with this particular type of metastatic breast cancer in the first-line setting in almost 10 years. Ibrance is one of the most promising new products in Pfizer’s portfolio and EU approval was expected considering the CHMP had issued a positive opinion in September. Ibrance sales were $1.5 billion in the first nine months of 2016.\n\nPfizer is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here .\n\nMylan & Partner Biocon File Herceptin Biosimilar: Mylan, which missed Q3 estimates (Read more: Mylan Q3 Earnings & Revenues Miss on EpiPen Woes ), announced the submission of a regulatory application for a biosimilar version of Roche’s ( RHHBY - Free Report ) Herceptin (trastuzumab) in the U.S. This is Mylan’s first FDA biosimilar submission, and the company believes it has the potential to be the first to seek approval for a biosimilar version of Herceptin in the U.S.\n\nBristol-Myers Provides Updates on Opdivo, Signs Deal with Nitto: Bristol-Myers ( BMY - Free Report ) came out with several updates this week. The company gained FDA approval for its immuno-oncology treatment Opdivo for use in head and neck cancer.\n\nOpdivo also met the primary endpoint in a late-stage study for unresectable advanced or recurrent gastric cancer refractory to, or intolerant of, standard therapy. This is good news for the company as Opdivo is the first and only immuno-oncology agent to demonstrate overall survival advantage in this patient population.\n\nThe company also announced a 5-year research collaboration with Johns Hopkins University for the identification of mechanisms of response and resistance in patients whose cancer is being treated with checkpoint inhibitor-based immunotherapies, including Opdivo monotherapy, or Opdivo in combination with Yervoy or other investigational immunotherapies.\n\nA clinical trial agreement was also signed with Infinity for Opdivo plus Infinity’s IPI-549 in patients with advanced solid tumors.\n\nThe company has also signed an exclusive worldwide license agreement with Nitto Denko for the development and commercialization of Nitto’s investigational siRNA molecules targeting heat shock protein 47 (HSP47) in vitamin A containing formulations. The collaboration includes Nitto’s lead asset ND-L02-s0201, currently in early-stage development for the treatment of advanced liver fibrosis.\n\nThe agreement will see Bristol-Myers shelling out $100 million upfront and making subsequent payments in the form of clinical and regulatory milestone payments, royalties, sales based milestone payments as well as option exercise payments for lung and other organ fibrosis. This deal once again shows pharma’s interest in developing treatments for fibrotic diseases and to develop therapies for patients living with advanced non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and cirrhosis due to NASH.\n\nPerformance \nLarge Cap Pharmaceuticals Industry Price Index \n\nLarge Cap Pharmaceuticals Industry Price Index \nThe NYSE ARCA Pharmaceutical Index recorded a gain of 7.6% over the last five trading days reflecting a positive response to Trump’s win. Moreover, Proposition 61, California’s ballot measure to ensure that the State of California is able to negotiate with drug companies for drug prices that do not exceed the price paid for the same drugs by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, was shot down by voters.\n\nAmong major pharma stocks, both Pfizer and Bristol-Myers shot up more than 12% while AstraZeneca was down slightly on Q3 results. Over the last six months, Bristol-Myers declined 20.8% while Merck was up 18.8% (See the last pharma stock roundup here: Pfizer, Allergan Q3 Results Fall Short, Insulin Drugmakers under Pricing Pressure ).\n\nWhat's Next in the Pharma World? \n\nCompanies like Bristol-Myers will be showcasing data at the annual meeting of the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) and the Association of Rheumatology Health Professionals (ARHP) in the coming days. Bristol-Myers will also be presenting data along with Pfizer on Eliquis at the American Heart Association (AHA) Scientific Sessions 2016.\n\nNow See Our Private Investment Ideas \n\nWhile the above ideas are being shared with the public, other trades are hidden from everyone but selected members.

      "text": "November 11, 2016 10:38 AM Pfizer lowers cost of Prevnar vaccine for some charity use The Associated Press Order Reprint of this Story \nDrugmaker Pfizer says it's reducing what it charges humanitarian groups for its blockbuster vaccine against pneumonia, ear and blood infections. \nPfizer Inc.'s move to reduce Prevnar 13's price to $3.10 per dose — but only for the groups' use with refugees and in other emergency settings — follows pressure since 2009 by groups such as Doctors Without Borders. \n\"This is definitely a step in the right direction and will help to protect millions of vulnerable children,\" the charity said. \nThe biggest U.S. drugmaker previously preferred tax-deductible donations, which don't impact Prevnar's much-higher price. Pfizer's top-selling product, which requires three doses, brings it some $5 billion a year. \nBritain's GlaxoSmithKline Plc in September reduced the price of its rival Synflorix pneumococcal vaccine to $3.05 per dose for use in humanitarian emergencies.
