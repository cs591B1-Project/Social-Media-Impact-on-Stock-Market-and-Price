      "text": "John chalekson was recently restricted from linkedin.com. Please follow me on Facebook. 7 mins ago In the wake of this month's political devastation, a lot of sad, demoralized people are understandably arguing that the Democrats need to win back the white working class, and that the best way to do that is by pushing a more explicitly leftwing economic agenda. Krugman is right to call for skepticism here. While the idea seems to make sense, the problem is there isn't much evidence that the white working class actually supports policies like single payer healthcare, universal daycare, progressive taxation, or free college. Those are priorities for college-educated voters, not for the white working class. HRC's platform, shaped in part by Bernie voters, was the most economically progressive agenda the Democrats have ever put forward. She openly advocated higher taxes on the rich to pay for social programs, a far more progressive stance than Obama had in 2008, when he merely advocated that parts of the Bush tax cuts be \"allowed to expire.\" HRC's policies would have provided enormous benefits to the white working class, but she still lost them decisively, even as she generally improved on Obama's 2012 performance among upper-income suburban voters. This points to one of the central paradoxes of modern times. Across the West, as center-left parties have absorbed more upper-income voters in urban and suburban areas, they have counter-intuitively moved to the left on economic issues. Income inequality turns out to be a big issue among college-educated liberals, not the white working class. The poster child for this trend is the left-wing Spanish party PODEMOS, whose support comes overwhelmingly from the upper middle class and which performs weakest in the poorest, most culturally conservative parts of Spain. The key to winning back working-class districts probably doesn't have much to do with a left-wing economic agenda. In the U.S., as Matthew Yglesias pointed out recently on The Weeds, there are dozens of Democratic congressmen who represent districts that are almost entirely composed of working-class whites (one of them is Tim Ryan, a broad-shouldered white dude from the Akron area who is challenging Nancy Pelosi to become minority leader). Contrary to what you might expect, these legislators are UNIFORMLY more conservative on economic issues than HRC or Nancy Pelosi. Their constituents are far more skeptical of Obamacare and other government programs than voters in urban districts. (While they support increases in the minimum wage, they do so, if I recall correctly, with less enthusiasm than the median Democrat). So why do we keep hearing that Donald Trump won the rust belt by embracing \"economic populism\"? Because \"economic populism\" in this campaign did not mean the same thing as \"economic progressivism.\" It's true that Trump embraced economic policies popular with white working class voters, especially on trade, coal, and immigration. Being against free trade, though, is only dimly related to left-wing economics. It's much more strongly correlated with resenting foreigners. Enthusiasm for coal, and corresponding skepticism about global warming, bears some relation to jobs and employment in certain areas, but its pocket-book impact on most white working-class voters is minuscule compared to something like Obamacare, which lifts everyone up. Coal is a cultural issue for the white working class, not primarily an economic issue. This isn't to say that the Bernie wing of the Democratic party is wrong. Bernie Sanders might well have won the election by winning more working-class whites in states like Michigan and Wisconsin. If he had, though, it likely wouldn't have had anything to do with free college or single payer. It would have been because of his opposition to free trade, his relative softness on gun control and immigration, his effective use of rhetorical anger, and his persuasive claim to being an outsider. That's not to say that progressive rallying cries like single payer couldn't have been crucial to a Sanders victory. If they had, though, it would have been because those issues are popular with college-educated millennials, whose support for Hillary was tepid. I'm someone who thinks that economic progressivism should be part of the Democratic platform. It think it might even be essential to winning elections, if victory is to be had by running up the score among college-educated voters. Winning back the white working class, though, is a separate, almost unrelated project. The Democratic candidate who wins back the white working class is more likely to be a gun freak than someone focused on redistribution of wealth.",

The message is now very clear to those who think they will continue to misrule Cuba through oppression and fear. Enough is enough. The Cuban people have been shortchanged for too long to continue down this reviled path. \nThose who still rule Cuba with an iron grip may attempt to delay the island’s liberation, but they cannot stop it.” \nRep.

      "text": "50 Very good point! Facebook can’t have it both ways: either they curate information (in the form of a ‘feed’) or they don’t; since Facebook already obviously curates information, it is a blatant abdication of their inherent editorial ethical responsibility as an ‘editor’ to continue to spread misinformation. That Facebook does not generate the content is inconsequential to the argument; by curating and displaying information (user’s posts, in this case), Facebook is engaging in the roles of editor (curator of your news feed) and publisher (by hosting media content on sub-domains of facebook.com or via the Facebook API, which then displays that media on the app you have on your phone). The publishing industry in Western societies has evolved from an information free-for-all just after the invention of the Gutenberg press in the 16th century to a set of social norms in 20th century publishing where readers could expect a reasonable amount of veracity in the texts they were reading. Like it or not, contemporary citizens have come to expect veracity in published material available for public consumption (or at least they did prior to connecting to the internet for the 1st time). While the internet has done much to increase transparency in governments and to give voice to marginalised groups as adoption has increased since the 1990's, we have only achieved this remarkable growth by effectively ‘erasing’ the social function of editors and publishers; that is, we no longer have anyone ensuring that quality, truthful content is published and purposeful misinformation is not given a platform to be replicated and amplified through our media. It is time to bring editors back into publishing. And while those editors may now take the form of algorithms or humans (or possibly algorithms with a ‘human in the loop’), we need to recognise that writing and publishing has been – and continues to be – a collaborative human enterprise, consisting both of writers (who initially produce the content) and editors, who improve the content until it is valuable enough to deserve being shared – which includes weeding out misinformation before publishing that content for others' consumption. It is time to recognise the value that editors bring to the cultural activity of writing and sharing information – regardless of whether that content is published through traditional publishing houses, or is published on a ‘collaborative authorship platform’ (which is commonly referred to as ‘social media’). Whether in old or new media, we all pay for the lack of quality content generated in the absence of a good editor.",

      "text": "Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg is willing to try just about anything to get his company back into China. Publicly, he launched a charm offensive that included learning Mandarin and offering Chinese President Xi Jinping the chance to name his first child (he declined). Less publicly, but no less important, the New York Times reports that his company has developed tools to prevent sensitive posts from appearing in Facebook feeds in \"specific geographic areas.\"\nIt's a bold move that underscores just how hard Facebook is hunting for its next billion users. But even if the new tools convinced China's government to lift its ban on Facebook, the country's 700 million internet users have little reason to join. They have plenty of social networks of their own, most of them more advanced and more convenient. As Zuckerberg surely knows, the business case for a move onto the mainland looks dismal.\nSo why is Facebook still so interested?\nHistory would certainly suggest caution. In 2008, when Facebook launched a Chinese-language version, it managed to attract a mere 285,000 mainland members -- out of an internet population of more than 225 million. Meanwhile, competing platforms, especially Tencent's QQ, were signing up tens of millions. The next year, Facebook was blocked by the government, obliterating any chance to catch up with China's online entrepreneurs.\nEven worse (for Facebook) was that its Chinese rivals started innovating: Sina Weibo, once derided as a Twitter knock-off, instead became Twitter done better, embedding comment threads and videos long before the San Francisco-based service had contemplated doing the same.\nBut the most revolutionary service was Tencent's WeChat, released in 2011. At first glance, it looked like just another social network and messaging service. Yet it quickly morphed into something much richer, offering a free video-chat system, a taxi-hailing service, a bill-paying portal and a vast shopping environment. Today it's possible to bank on the system and send money to anyone. Invoking \"The Lord of the Rings,\" some users joke that it's the \"one app to rule them all.\" It now has more than 700 million users, including nearly everyone with internet access in China -- and another 70 million overseas.\nCompared to WeChat, Facebook is a desert, with little allure to Chinese users. There aren't any public statistics on how many mainlanders use Facebook, but in my experience they're mostly Chinese who have lived or worked in the West, want to maintain friendships overseas, and have access to the technical means to avoid government blockades. For those without such connections, Facebook's only theoretical appeal is that it provides access to news, posts and videos that are otherwise censored. If and when Facebook is reintroduced, those advantages will disappear -- and so will the most obvious argument for joining.\nBut Facebook still has one thing going for it, which is surely on Zuckerberg's mind: Technology and social media evolve rapidly in China.\nOnly two years ago, Sina Weibo was China's biggest and most popular social-media platform. Then, after a government crackdown, it lost its political edge and many of its most popular users, and was left for dead. Even as the eulogies were being written, however, Weibo was reinventing itself. It soon became a platform for live-streaming bloggers and celebrity self-promotion, and it boomed once again, boosted by an astonishing 10 million live broadcasts between April and June of this year -- a 116-fold increase over the previous quarter. Today, Weibo is approaching 300 million users and its most popular live-streamers get multi-million dollar endorsements.\nIt's too late for Facebook to jump on the live-streaming bandwagon. But Zuckerberg and his colleagues are certainly taking note that a politically neutered site, focused on celebrities and short videos, can command the attention of hundreds of millions of Chinese -- and thereby remake a beleaguered, left-for-dead social network. Zuckerberg's charm offensive, in other words, may pay off yet.\n\n_ Minter is based in Asia, where he covers politics, culture, business and junk.\n\nFor more columns from Bloomberg View, visit http://www.bloomberg.com/view.\n ",

      "text": "Order Reprint of this Story \nTwo days after Donald Trump’s election, Mark Zuckerberg was in the hot seat. \nAt a tech conference, an interviewer grilled Facebook’s chief executive about the fake news that proliferates there, suggesting it swayed the election toward Trump. \nZuckerberg scoffed, calling it “a pretty crazy idea.” \nBut since then, under fire (including from President Barack Obama), Facebook has taken positive steps. \nLast Friday, Zuckerberg posted that he grasps the seriousness of the problem and outlined how Facebook might deal with it. He mentioned third-party verification services; better ways for users to flag hoaxes; and efforts to keep fake websites from getting rich on advertising dollars. \nNow it’s time for a bolder move: Facebook should hire a top executive editor and give that person the resources, power and staff to make sound editorial decisions. \nZuckerberg may not want to call this person an editor, since he has insisted Facebook isn’t a media company. And indeed, Facebook does not produce news itself. \nThat’s fine. Whatever the title, Facebook needs someone who can distinguish a Pulitzer Prize-winning photograph from child pornography and who can tell a lie from a thoroughly vetted investigative story. \n“Engagement” rules on Facebook. To oversimplify: The more an item is shared by friends, the more likely you are to see it. \nClearly, that’s not enough. What’s needed is sound judgment. \nFacebook is a big news source – for some demographics, the leading one. Its influence will only grow. \nUnderstandably, Facebook doesn’t want to turn into the world’s censor. It shouldn’t and doesn’t have to. \nZuckerberg said recently identifying truth is hard. Ben Smith, Buzzfeed’s chief editor, had a ready answer: \nThat might be so, he said, “for algorithms and epistemologists. But it’s something that professional journalists are asked to do every day, and it’s not actually that complicated.” \nIt comes down to judgment - the kind that can’t be done by code or by relying on well-intentioned but vague “community standards.” \nThe need for editorial judgment at Facebook didn’t start with this post-election finger-pointing. It’s been growing for many months. \nLast summer, for example, Diamond Reynolds livestreamed a horrific scene on Facebook: Her boyfriend, Philando Castile, had been fatally shot by a Minnesota police officer. Her post was removed for about an hour – Facebook said due to a technical glitch – then restored. \nIn September, Facebook deleted Nick Ut’s Pulitzer Prize-winning photograph of a Vietnamese girl fleeing a napalm attack because it violated the platform’s standards on nudity and child pornography. When global outrage followed, it too was restored. \nEmily Bell, director of the Tow Center for Digital Journalism at Columbia University, has called on Zuckerberg to change his mind about Facebook’s role in the media ecosystem and implored Facebook to “play a more active part in editing...and hiring actual people to do so.” \nEditors, of course, are far from infallible. But this would put someone in charge at a high level who could help journalists and technologists talk to one another and who could make decisions based on sound judgment. \nIt wouldn’t stop all fake news. But Facebook’s appointment of an executive editor would be a step forward, bringing accountability and good sense where it’s sorely needed. It would also set an example for other tech companies and social platforms grappling with the same problems. \nAnother “pretty crazy idea”? Maybe so. But one whose time has come.",

Like it or not, contemporary citizens have come to expect veracity in published material available for public consumption (or at least they did prior to connecting to the internet for the 1st time).\nWhile the internet has done much to increase transparency in governments and to give voice to marginalised groups as adoption has increased since the 1990's, we have only achieved this remarkable growth by effectively ‘erasing’ the social function of editors and publishers; that is, we no longer have anyone ensuring that quality, truthful content is published and purposeful misinformation is not given a platform to be replicated and amplified through our media.\nIt is time to bring editors back into publishing. And while those editors may now take the form of algorithms or humans (or possibly algorithms with a ‘human in the loop’), we need to recognise that writing and publishing has been – and continues to be – a collaborative human enterprise, consisting both of writers (who initially produce the content) and editors, who improve the content until it is valuable enough to deserve being shared – which includes weeding out misinformation before publishing that content for others' consumption.\nIt is time to recognise the value that editors bring to the cultural activity of writing and sharing information – regardless of whether that content is published through traditional publishing houses, or is published on a ‘collaborative authorship platform’ (which is commonly referred to as ‘social media’). Whether in old or new media, we all pay for the lack of quality content generated in the absence of a good editor.",

      "title": "Deal Alert: Oneworld Business Class to Europe From $1,389 RT",
      "text": "Want to see the latest flight deals as soon as they’re published? Follow The Points Guy on Facebook and Twitter , and subscribe to text message alerts from our deals feed, @ tpg_alerts . \nAirfare deals are typically only available on limited dates. We recommend that you use Google Flights to find dates with cheap fares, then head to Norwegian’s website to enter the promotion code and book with the discount. \nAnd the amazing Black Friday airfare deals keep rolling in…\nBritish Airways just launched a business-class fare sale to Europe. You’ll need to book travel for two people in order to take advantage of these fares , so this sale isn’t ideal for business travel. Travel dates are from December 10 through January 14, 2017 , and again from June 20 through August 29, 2017 , so this could be a good option for summer travel to Europe.\nWe found the lowest fares (starting at $1,389 round-trip per person) from New York, but you can also originate in Boston or Washington, D.C. Chicago, Miami and other cities appear to be available for a few hundred dollars more. European destinations include London, Paris, Barcelona, Madrid, Amsterdam, Rome, Venice and more.\nNote that you’ll need to be an AARP member in order to take advantage of the fares below , though anyone can join starting at $16 per year. The $400 AARP discount is only valid through March 2017, so you’ll pay more for summer departures. However, the 10% Visa discount (which only applies to BA and OpenSkies flights) is valid through the end of 2017 . See this post for booking instructions.\nAirline: British Airways and Oneworld partners (American, Iberia and OpenSkies)\nRoute: Flights to Europe\nDeal: $1,389+ round-trip in business class\nDates: December 10, 2016 through January 14, 2017, and June 20 through August 29, 2017\nBooking Link: British Airways (and AARP ) \nPay With: The Platinum Card from American Express ( 5x on airfare ), Chase Sapphire Reserve , Premier Rewards Gold Card from American Express , Citi Prestige (3x on airfare) or Chase Sapphire Preferred (2x on travel)\nHere are a few examples of what you can book (note that the fares below are for two passengers):\nNew York to Barcelona (BCN) for $1,389 round-trip in business class on British Airways: \n\nNew York to Barcelona (BCN) for $1,480 round-trip in business class on American: \n\nNew York to Paris (ORY) for $1,397 round-trip in business class on OpenSkies: \n\nNew York to Madrid (MAD) for $1,485 round-trip in business class on Iberia: \n\nWashington, D.C. (IAD) to London (LHR) for $1,525 round-trip in business class on British Airways: \n\n\nBoston (BOS) to London (LHR) for $1,593 round-trip in business class on British Airways: \n\nMaximize Your Purchase \nDon’t forget to use a credit card that earns additional points on airfare purchases, such as the American Express Platinum Card ( 5x on flights booked directly with airlines or American Express Travel ), Chase Sapphire Reserve , American Express Premier Rewards Gold or Citi Prestige (3x on airfare) or the Chase Sapphire Preferred Card (2x on all travel purchases).

How about get emotionally invested in the honest truth. I’ve lost respect for many of you \"truth seekers\" who when met with facts cry like the liberal left. Snowflakes and safe spaces for lots of you. All these people keep telling me they know what’s going on and yet they themselves haven’t even been out there. Much like we saw from people on the Oregon standoff. Keyboard warriors. If this is such an important issue for you. Go there and make a stand. Stop typing out the bullshit you get from democracy now and Jill Stein. I got people on the ground who have been there since day 1 and it doesn’t fit what the left is putting out what so ever. Seems like so many people hate the mainstream media fake news until it fits their personal agenda.",

      "text": "By Lux Alptraum \nThe holidays are upon us, and for many Americans that means traveling to spend time with family that you haven’t seen in weeks or months. Chances are you’ll find yourself making small talk about your jobs or friends or living situation. But you might be able to dodge one of the classic forms of family interrogation: Thanks to Facebook, your family—along with the hundreds (or thousands) of other people you call “friends”—already know whether you’re seeing someone. And they may know a whole heck of a lot about that relationship, too. \nWe’ve all read the think pieces and studies arguing that Facebook and the like have caused us to be too public about our love lives, to overshare all the minute details, in ways that aren’t always healthy . From couples publicly documenting every relationship milestone to elaborately staged proposal videos gone viral, the TMI culture of social media has led to an explosion of romantic oversharing, one that’s intensified as internet and social media use has evolved from a fringe pastime to a fixture in the lives of more than a billion people around the globe. \nBut while widespread social media use may be new, the urge to crow publicly about our relationships isn’t. History is littered with analog rituals intended to publicly proclaim our connection to another person, from the ‘50s-era ritual of “pinning” to the longstanding tradition of wedding rings. And what are weddings themselves if not an IRL status update conducted in front of a few dozen (or hundred) of your closest friends and family? \nSocial media has forced us to navigate new, sometimes tense relationship dynamics. \nIn some ways, the very foundations of monogamy are built on the public announcement of a relationship. Many of the things we take for granted as symbols of love and commitment are, in their own ways, a method of telling the world about our private lives. Sure, wedding rings are a personal reminder of a deeply intimate connection, but they’re also a way of communicating that you’re “ taken .” As long as we’ve been creating exclusive commitments, we’ve been finding ways to talk to others about them. \nBut even if the desire to publicize our intimate relationships or mark others as our own isn’t unprecedented, there’s no denying that social media has forced us to navigate new, sometimes tense relationship dynamics. \nFor starters, it’s easier than ever to make a public declaration of love: There’s no need to buy a ring, or gather your closest friends together in a room, or even send an announcement to your local paper—just post a photo on Facebook or a “She said yes.” As the effort required to announce our affections has decreased, the impact and reach has dramatically increased. A wedding might mean declaring your love in front of a few people, but putting the photos, or video, online amplifies the reach of that public declaration to a broad network of thousands–or, in the case of a particularly popular wedding video , millions. \nAnd those public declarations are also more permanent, as anyone who’s had an ex pop up in their Facebook memories can confirm. That combination of permanence and publicity can create some pretty awkward situations when a relationship ends, or even changes. “When partner and I changed [our relationship status] from ‘married’ to ‘open relationship,’ acquaintances messaged us with condolences,” says Chris, a web developer from North Carolina. \nSocial media has exacerbated a divide between more public people and those who’d rather keep a veil of secrecy over their domestic life. \nSocial media also seems to have exacerbated an existing divide between more public people and those who’d rather keep a veil of secrecy over their domestic life. For those who value a public declaration of love, the effortlessness of announcing your affections on social media can make a hesitant partner seem callous or cruel—as if they consider the relationship a dirty little secret. John, a New Jersey-based comedian, told me that the Facebook relationship status question was “a big point of contention” in a previous relationship. When his then-girlfriend, who he notes was “super anti-social media,” refused to confirm their relationship status online, “it made me feel like she was ashamed of me.” \nIf you aren’t already sold on the joys of telling the world about your relationship, the potential negatives of publicizing a relationship can seem overwhelming. Josh, a software developer based in the Pacific Northwest, cites privacy concerns as a major reason for keeping relationships offline. “Talking about your partner assumes a great deal of consent on their part,” he says. “I’ve found out the hard way things you might think are endearing about another person are considered very, very personal and private.” Unlike offline recognition of relationships, “Facebook has made it nearly impossible to create that sense of intimacy due to its slack privacy controls.” \nBut as frustrating as it can be to negotiate these new norms, perhaps we should be grateful to the internet for forcing the discussion. For many of us, it’s easy to default to what society expects out of our relationships—to board the “relationship escalator” and never look back, following a path more because it’s expected than because it’s something we actually want. By upping the stakes on what it means to be “public” about our relationships, in thinking through how much sharing counts as oversharing, we’re getting off that escalator and actively making decisions about how to structure our romantic engagements. The very fact that we’re making a choice about what we share on Facebook is, itself, important—regardless of what choice we end up making. Story Tags",

      "text": "John chalekson was recently restricted from linkedin.com. Please follow me on Facebook. 18 mins ago Castro was basically what some politicians today would look like without opposition: he dissolved the banks, took the wealth of the 1%, limited consumer choices, instituted \"free\" healthcare, got rid of big business, made bigger safety nets for the poor, spent lots of money on education programs and shunned capitalism. He was able to come to power because people were angry at Batista, a corporatist who doled out money and favors to a corrupt network of CEO cronies much like we see today. Niether the corrupt cronie corporatist system of the current USA or Basista nor the broken dead end road of death of Castro / Guevara is a solution. The common theme with the two failed models is that both rely on big government: Batista or the US to take stuff from the poor and working class and give it to corporate cronies or Castros model which takes from everyone to reward government cronies. Solution: stop supporting those who promise you the moon in exchange for more power and control. People who are mad now are right but the solution isn't more government. Cuba is a great illustration of both extremes.",

Later that day, an essay, “ Invisible Talent ,” circulated across my social-media feeds and Slack back channels. “I haven’t even started my first full-time job yet and I’m already so tired of feeling erased and mistreated by the tech industry,” it read.\nSee the rest of the story at newyorker.com \nRelated:\nPeter Thiel’s Oddly Conventional Defense of Trump \nThe Real Soylent Sickness \nThe Hidden Benefits of Not Taking a Compliment ",

      "text": "Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg is willing to try anything to get his company back into China. Publicly, he launched a charm offensive that included learning Mandarin and offering Chinese President Xi Jinping the chance to name his first child (he declined). Less publicly, but no less important, the New York Times reports that his company has developed tools to prevent sensitive posts from appearing in Facebook feeds in “specific geographic areas”.It’s a bold move that underscores just how hard Facebook is hunting for its next billion users. But even if the new tools convinces China’s government to lift its ban on Facebook, the country’s 700 million internet users have little reason to join. They have plenty of social networks of their own, most of them more advanced and more convenient. As Zuckerberg surely knows, the business case for a move onto the mainland looks dismal.\nSo why is Facebook still so interested?\nHistory would certainly suggest caution. In 2008, when Facebook launched a Chinese-language version, it managed to attract a mere 285,000 mainland members — out of an internet population of more than 225 million. Meanwhile, competing platforms, especially Tencent’s QQ, were signing up tens of millions. The next year, Facebook was blocked by the government, obliterating any chance to catch up with China’s online entrepreneurs.\nEven worse (for Facebook) was that its Chinese rivals started innovating: Sina Weibo, once derided as a Twitter knock-off, instead became Twitter done better, embedding comment threads and videos long before the San Francisco-based service had contemplated doing the same.\nBut the most revolutionary service was Tencent’s WeChat, released in 2011. At first glance, it looked like just another social network and messaging service. Yet, it quickly morphed into something much richer, offering a free video-chat system, a taxi-hailing service, a bill-paying portal and a vast shopping environment. Today it’s possible to bank on the system and send money to anyone. Invoking The Lord of the Rings, some users joke that it’s the “one app to rule them all”. It now has more than 700 million users, including nearly everyone with internet access in China — and another 70 million overseas.\nCompared to WeChat, Facebook is a desert, with little allure to Chinese users. There aren’t any public statistics on how many mainlanders use Facebook, but in my experience they’re mostly Chinese who have lived or worked in the West, want to maintain friendships overseas and have access to the technical means to avoid government blockades. For those without such connections, Facebook’s only theoretical appeal is that it provides access to news, posts and videos that are otherwise censored. If and when Facebook is reintroduced, those advantages will disappear — and so will the most obvious argument for joining.\nBut Facebook still has one thing going for it, which is surely on Zuckerberg’s mind: Technology and social media evolve rapidly in China.\nOnly two years ago, Sina Weibo was China’s biggest and most popular social-media platform. Then, after a government crackdown, it lost its political edge and many of its most popular users, and was left for dead. Even as the eulogies were being written, however, Weibo was reinventing itself. It soon became a platform for live-streaming bloggers and celebrity self-promotion, and it boomed once again, boosted by an astonishing 10 million live broadcasts between April and June of this year — a 116-fold increase over the previous quarter. Today, Weibo is approaching 300 million users and its most popular live-streamers get multi-million dollar endorsements.\nIt’s too late for Facebook to jump on the live-streaming bandwagon, but Zuckerberg and his colleagues are certainly taking note that a politically neutered site, focused on celebrities and short videos, can command the attention of hundreds of millions of Chinese — and thereby remake a beleaguered, left-for-dead social network. Zuckerberg’s charm offensive, in other words, may pay off yet.\n— Washington Post\nAdam Minter is based in Asia, where he covers politics, culture, business and junk.

      "text": "(Before It's News)\nFollow TIS on Twitter: @Truth_is_Scary & Like TIS of Facebook- facebook.com/TruthisScary\nWIRED\nCautious computer users put a piece of tape over their webcam. Truly paranoid ones worry about their devices’ microphones—some even crack open their computers and phones to disable or remove those audio components so they can’t be hijacked by hackers. Now one group of Israeli researchers has taken that game of spy-versus-spy paranoia a step further, with malware that converts your headphones into makeshift microphones that can slyly record your conversations.\nResearchers at Israel’s Ben Gurion University have created a piece of proof-of-concept code they call “Speake(a)r,” designed to demonstrate how determined hackers could find a way to surreptitiously hijack a computer to record audio even when the device’s microphones have been entirely removed or disabled. The experimental malware instead repurposes the speakers in earbuds or headphones to use them as microphones, converting the vibrations in air into electromagnetic signals to clearly capture audio from across a room.\n“People don’t think about this privacy vulnerability,” says Mordechai Guri, the research lead of Ben Gurion’s Cyber Security Research Labs. “Even if you remove your computer’s microphone, if you use headphones you can be recorded.”\nIt’s no surprise that earbuds can function as microphones in a pinch, as dozens of how-to YouTube videos demonstrate . Just as the speakers in headphones turn electromagnetic signals into sound waves through a membrane’s vibrations, those membranes can also work in reverse, picking up sound vibrations and converting them back to electromagnetic signals. (Plug a pair of mic-less headphones into an audio input jack on your computer to try it.)\nBut the Ben Gurion researchers took that hack a step further. Their malware uses a little-known feature of RealTek audio codec chips to silently “retask” the computer’s output channel as an input channel, allowing the malware to record audio even when the headphones remain connected into an output-only jack and don’t even have a microphone channel on their plug. The researchers say the RealTek chips are so common that the attack works on practically any desktop computer, whether it runs Windows or MacOS, and most laptops, too. RealTek didn’t immediately respond to WIRED’s request for comment on the Ben Gurion researchers’ work. “This is the real vulnerability,” says Guri. “It’s what makes almost every computer today vulnerable to this type of attack.”\nTo be fair, the eavesdropping attack should only matter to those who have already gone a few steps down the rabbit-hole of obsessive counter-intelligence measures. But in the modern age of cybersecurity, fears of having your computer’s mic surreptitiously activated by stealthy malware are increasingly mainstream: Guri points to the photo that revealed earlier this year that Mark Zuckerberg had put tape over his laptop’s microphone . In a video for Vice News, Edward Snowden demonstrated how to remove the internal mic from a smartphone . Even the NSA’s information assurance division suggests “hardening” PCs by disabling their microphones , and repair-oriented site iFixit’s Kyle Wiens showed MacWorld in July how to physically disable a Macbook mic . None of those techniques—short of disabling all audio input and output from a computer—would defeat this new malware. (Guri says his team has so far focused on using the vulnerability in RealTek chips to attack PCs, though. They have to determine which other audio codec chips and smartphones might be vulnerable to the attack, They have to determine which other audio codec chips and smartphones might be vulnerable to the attack, but believe other chips and devices are likely also susceptible.)\nIn their tests, the researchers tried the audio hack with a pair of Sennheiser headphones. They found that they could record from as far as 20 feet away—and even compress the resulting recording and send it over the internet, as a hacker would—and still distinguish the words spoken by a male voice. “It’s very effective,” says Guri. “Your headphones do make a good, quality microphone.\nThere’s no simple software patch for the eavesdropping attack, Guri says….\nREAD MORE….",

      "text": "100 years after Jack London's death, hearing his call by Juan Vidal | NPR Share on Facebook ullstein bild/Getty Images \nJack London, who died 100 years ago this week, occupies a space in which few writers can set foot. Although it's not especially unique for writers' lives to be marked by sickness and excess, London was prolific despite these constant threats to his productivity. Even as illness loomed, he managed to publish over 50 books and hundreds of articles in the last 16 years of his life. \nAt a young age, London developed a hard discipline for writing — often jotting down as many as 1,000 words a day and getting by on little sleep. \"All I wanted,\" he said once , \"was a quiet place in the country to write and loaf in and get out of Nature that 'something' which we all need.\" For much of his career, financial strains didn't afford him the luxury of slowing down. But in time, that work ethic literally paid off, and made him the first American author to earn a million dollars in his lifetime. (It also likely contributed, however indirectly, to his untimely death at the age of 40.) \nWhen Mrs. Foster-Grant, my 11th grade creative writing teacher, passed out copies of The Call of the Wild , I was immediately uninterested. Its cover — a large dog howling against a backdrop of the full moon — wasn't enough to make me care. Weeks went by before I even cracked the thing open; I got by on assignments with the help of smart neighbors whose shoulders I could see over without a problem. But life has a strange way of ensuring you give specific books their proper due. \nAround that time, I was listening to a track by a rap group called L.A. Symphony when one of the MC's unleashed an odd couplet that gave me pause: \"Slip to the right and then left/My name is Jack London and I got bad breath.\" I replayed it over and over to make sure I was hearing correctly. While I figured the lyric was just an attempt at being provocative and didn't hold any deeper meaning, it got my attention. I fetched the book from my knapsack and dug in to see what the big deal was. \nAnd that's when I finally heard the call of the wild. There is a melancholy that runs through books like The Call of the Wild and White Fang , London's biggest books. The novels are rich and expansive, easily the most insightful novels ever to star dogs. They are also notably different in scope: One is about transformation and the power of embracing one's true self, while the other revolves around the reality of oppression and allowing oneself, at least to some extent, to be tamed for the purpose of peace and harmony. Both books can be uniquely difficult to read at points, their violence and cruelty taking center stage and revealing harsh truths about the cost of survival. And about their author. \nIn a 1913 interview with the Milwaukee County Leader , London shed some light on his approach to life and work: \n\"You may wonder why I am a pessimist. I often wonder myself. Here I have the most precious thing in the world — the love of a woman; I have beautiful children; I have lots and lots of money; I have fame as a writer; I have many men working for me; I have a beautiful ranch — and still, I am a pessimist. I look at things dispassionately, scientifically, and everything appears almost hopeless; after long years of labor and development, the people are as bad off as ever. There is a mighty ruling class that intends to hold fast to its possessions. I see years and years of bloodshed. I see the master class hiring armies of murderers to keep the workers in subjection, to beat them back should they attempt to dispossess the capitalists. That's why I am a pessimist. I see things in the light of history and the laws of nature.\" \nSure, that kind of pessimism can seem too emotionally taxing. But the ability to look at certain areas of society \"dispassionately,\" as London puts it, can be beneficial in sparking change, and creating art that considers the variety of human experience and suffering. \nOn the last day of my 11th grade year — after also having devoured The Sea-Wolf and other London short stories — I left Mrs. Foster-Grant a burned copy of the L.A. Symphony CD with \"Jack London Has Bad Breath\" written in Sharpie. I provided no explanation beyond that. Each one teach one, I thought to myself. \nJuan Vidal is a writer and critic for NPR Books.

      "text": "John chalekson was recently restricted from linkedin.com. Please follow me on Facebook. 3 mins ago Puppet Masters he with the gold, rules. The public assumes a broad ownership of corporations and media outlets, when the opposite is true. A very few individuals control the wealth of the world, install politicians to their pleasing, create global conflicts and create or destroy the fortunes of countries as well as individuals in the chess games they play with their control, and thus operate as Puppet Masters during the cover-up. Their agenda is to retain control, retain their position, and thus as their gold rules, they want minimal impact to their financial stature. No bank failure. No drop in stock value. No corporate bankruptcies. And as they assume this would occur if knowledge of a rogue planet in the inner solar system were to be broad, they consider hiding this as long as possible of prime importance. PuppetsPromised wealth, power, security, and opportunities outside of what their natural talents would afford them, puppets invariably allow their strings to be pulled. They are chosen because they can be controlled, by blackmail, by bribery, by intimidation, and if disappointed with the role they are assigned, they are alternately threatened and placated by their puppet masters, else eliminated. Puppets run amuck of their masters when they sense their world will not continue, and make demands. Occasional restless puppets are expected, with alternatives waiting in the wings, but when puppets panic en mass, malfunction, are absent, and many replacements are happening simultaneously, the chess game the puppet masters play does not go as planned. We then have the masters emerging to act, without cover, as in the takeover of Yokos stock by Jacob Rothchild when the Russian oil appeared lost. This makes the puppets nervous, as they sense they are dispensable. Comfortable ClassAccustomed to being secure due to ownership of goods and the power this brings, the upper class or moneyed class will react with more than shock when their property, whether corporate interests or stocks and bonds or real property, is flushed down the toilet during the increasing changes pummeling the Earth. Insurance companies will go under when their insured base surpasses their wealth, corporate bankruptcy will ensue when all but the corporate name have been washed or blown away, and clutching jewels and artwork, they will stand and wail. Banking empires, government security blankets, all run by puppets of the puppet master, will receive demands to do something to return the comfortable class to their comfort. Simultaneous demands on nervous and malfunctioning puppets creates an explosive situation. More malfunction. More naked hand of the puppet master exposed. Wailing all around. Working ClassAt the base of the pyramid, the working man and woman observe the drama. From their standpoint, they are living in the Land of Oz, where nothing is as it has been pronounced, the good guys doing bad deeds, the economic recovery putting them out of their homes and jobs, and no one explaining why the Sun and Moon and seasons are not where they are supposed to be. The point of working for the comfortable class is for food and a roof over one’s head, and when both seem tenuous, loyalty fails. The working class is thus simply not where expected to be, not the drones and robots anticipated, and the comfortable class now switches from simply wailing to panic. Insecurity translates to autocracy, so strong arm tactics against the working class are the first armament. This of course backfires when cities are collapsing and the leadership proven inept, so the working class becomes the rebelling class, and is absent even more.",

      "text": "0 Comments \nEver since the earliest days of democracy, the candidates with the most money have been best placed to sway elections their way. Today, that no longer holds true. It’s the side with the best data that has the upper hand. Money helps, but without sophisticated analysis of the right data, it’s squandered. \nThe importance of data has been known for some time, but it’s only in the past year or so that its potency has become clear. A few straws showed which way the wind was blowing after last year’s unexpected victory for the right-wing Conservative party in Britain’s general election — more on that later. But it has been this year’s Brexit vote in June, followed by victory for the Trump campaign in the US presidential elections, that has confirmed the power of data analytics. \nAt the fulcrum of this transformation in our democracy is a British data analysis firm that only works with right-wing clients. As the New York Times revealed last weekend : \nCambridge Analytica worked on the ‘Leave’ side of the Brexit campaign. In the United States it takes only Republicans as clients: Senator Ted Cruz in the primaries, Mr Trump in the general election. Cambridge is reportedly backed by Robert Mercer , a hedge fund billionaire and a major Republican donor; a key board member is Stephen K Bannon, the head of Breitbart News who became Mr Trump’s campaign chairman and is set to be his chief strategist in the White House. \nCambridge Analytica assembles data on US voters by collating large volumes of publicly available information together with the results of short personality quizzes taken by tens of thousands of Facebook users. Analyzing this data makes it possible to assess sentiment in very precisely targeted demographic segments. It can then target highly personalized Facebook newsfeed messages to sway individual voters based on their demographic and pyschographic profile. Elections turn on GOTV \nThis matters because of an aspect of elections that political geeks understand very well but which the average person in the street doesn’t think about — and which is at the root of the shock victories by the Brexit and Trump campaigns. It’s the GOTV operation — how you organize to Get Out The Vote. \nIn a close election — especially in first-past-the-post elections or yes/no referendum votes — if one side has a better GOTV operation than the other, it can move the margins enough to clinch unexpected victory. It all comes down to differential turnout — you may be lagging 2% in the polls, but if you can do a 5% better job of getting your supporters to turn out than the other side, you’ll turn that into a winning margin. In the US electoral college system, you don’t even need to win the popular vote outright — you just need enough of an edge in GOTV to sway a few swing states in your favor (which, as we now know, is how Trump triumphed). \nThe Brexit and Trump secret weapon was a digital GOTV operation that could motivate voters who had barely voted in decades. Because they had no track record of voting, the opinion pollsters were giving no weight to their voting intentions. \nEven more crucially, the Clinton campaign’s GOTV operation was ignoring these hidden voters in favor of people with a track record of voting, because that’s how every previous election had been won or lost. But Trump’s campaign had a new way of reaching people that it knew were motivated to vote for the first time in their lives. As the New York Times article explains: \nWhile Hillary Clinton spent more than $140 million on television spots, old-media experts scoffed at Trump’s lack of old-media ad buys. Instead, his campaign pumped its money into digital, especially Facebook. \nThat money was better spent than the Clinton campaign’s millions — though it didn’t come cheap. NBC reports that the Trump campaign spent $5 million with Cambridge Analytica in September alone . Vote Leave’s data science \nIn the Brexit referendum, while Cambridge Analytica gave its services to another of the leave campaign groups, the official Vote Leave campaign set up its own data science operation. In a blog post last month, Vote Leave’s director Dominic Cummings spelt out how it rejected traditional electoral campaign methods to build its own digital alternative (which is now available as open source). \nOne of our central ideas was that the campaign had to do things in the field of data that have never been done before. This included a) integrating data from social media, online advertising, websites, apps, canvassing, direct mail, polls, online fundraising, activist feedback, and some new things we tried such as a new way to do polling (about which I will write another time) and b) having experts in physics and machine learning do proper data science in the way only they can — ie, far beyond the normal skills applied in political campaigns. We were the first campaign in the UK to put almost all our money into digital communication then have it partly controlled by people whose normal work was subjects like quantum information … \nIn the official 10 week campaign we served about one billion targeted digital adverts , mostly via Facebook and strongly weighted to the period around postal voting and the last 10 days of the campaign. We ran many different versions of ads, tested them, dropped the less effective and reinforced the most effective in a constant iterative process. Beating the establishment \nCummings takes pleasure in how his campaign went against the grain of establishment thinking: \nMany bigshot traditional advertising characters told us we were making a huge error. They were wrong. It is one of the reasons we won … \nPhysicists and mathematicians … can successfully invade politics and devise things that rout those who wrongly think they know what they are doing. \nI personally saw early signs of the potency of digital campaigning in last year’s British general election. The right-wing Conservative party unexpectedly won an overall majority by a digital GOTV effort that targeted voters most likely to switch with messages their data told them would be persuasive. While Labour lost seats to the SNP in Scotland, the Conservatives piled on seats largely by building on the collapse in votes for the Liberal Democrats who had been part of the Coalition government — those wins proved enough to deliver the Conservatives a majority. \nI happen to live in the only consituency in southern England that retains a Liberal Democrat MP. He knows he would have lost his seat if the Conservatives had plowed the same resources they did into neighbouring seats. Those campaigns in other seats are currently the target of a Channel 4 News investigation into whether the Conservative party broke election law by spending so much on their campaigns in swing seats. The data was guiding the allocation of resources, but while there was some very effective Facebook advertising going on, the campaigns were also relying on more traditional and labor-intensive GOTV methods. My take \nThere’s a substantial irony here in that the technologies Silicon Valley champions have been deployed most effectively in recent elections by those who oppose the values it upholds. It was the non-conformist Brexit and Trump campaigns that thought out-of-the-box while the establishment was left floundering with tried-and-tested processes that no longer worked. The disruptive innovation meme of the technology industry has been repurposed to further a politically conservative agenda. \nThe power of data is incontrovertible, but it’s unevenly spread and that’s skewing our democracy. Should the outcome of an election depend on who has access to the best data algorithms? In the UK, the use of money to influence election results has been regulated since the nineteenth century, and candidates have to adhere to strict expenditure limits during the campaign. One response to recent events might be to regulate the use of data to influence election votes. But that shouldn’t be necessary so long as the losing side learns its lessons and forges a digital strategy in time for the next big electoral test. If Silicon Valley wants to see its values regain the ascendancy, it must quickly teach its political allies how to disrupt themselves. \nImage credit - Person holding smartphone with online voting concept © maicasaa - Fotolia.com \nDisclosure - The author is a longstanding member of the Liberal Democrats.",

      "text": "John chalekson was recently restricted from linkedin.com. Please follow me on Facebook. 2 mins ago Castro's bodycount: proportional to his victim pool, equivalent to a US dictator murdering 2 to 5 million Americans. \"The Harvard-trained scholar Armando Lago, in his book The Black Book of Communism, first published in French, (1997) then in English 1999, made an attempt to list Castro’s deaths since 1959. So far the deaths of 97,000 persons have been named, each confirmed by at least two sources. Some 30,000 executed by firing squad, 2,000 extra-judicial assassinations, 5,000 deaths in prison due to beating by guards and denial of medical care and 60,000 deaths while trying to escape Cuba by sea. According to Dr. Lago's and his ongoing-research partner, Cuba Archive President Maria Werlau, 78,000 innocents may have died trying to flee the dictatorship. Another 5,300 are known to have lost their lives fighting communism in the Escambray Mountains (mostly peasant farmers and their children) and at the Bay of Pigs. Another estimated 14,000 Cubans were killed in Fidel's revolutionary adventures abroad, most notably his dispatch of 50,000 soldiers to Angola in the 1980s to help the Soviet-backed regime fight off the Unita insurgency. Their 2005 total ranges between 90,827 and 102,722 deaths. The estimates of Cubans killed range from 35,000 to 141,000 (1959-1987) according to and available on the site of R. J. Rummel-University of Hawaii, “Power Kills.”\" 97,000 would be 1.5% of his victim pool -- Cuba's 1959 population being 6.7m. So if his victim pool were today's US, amounts to 5 million dead, 2 million by firing squad alone.",

Trump on the Ridiculous Green Party Recount Request \"The people have spoken and the election is over, and as Hillary Clinton herself said on election night, in addition to her conceding by congratulating me, 'We must accept this result and then look to the future.' \"It is important to point out that with the help of millions of voters across the country, we won 306 electoral votes on Election Day - the most of any Republican since 1988 — and we carried nine of 13 battleground states, 30 of 50 states, and more than 2,600 counties nationwide - the most since President Ronald Reagan in 1984. \"This recount is just a way for Jill Stein, who received less than one percent of the vote overall and wasn't even on the ballot in many states, to fill her coffers With money, most of which she Will never even spend on this ridiculous recount. All three states were won by large numbers of voters, especially Pennsylvania, which was won by more than 70,000 votes. \"This IS a scam by the Green Party for an election that has already been conceded, and the results of this election should be respected instead of being challenged and abused, which is exactly what Jill Stein is doing.\"",

(Facebook photo) STAMFORD, CT (WFSB) - \nA tribute ceremony will be held Saturday for a Stamford man who was murdered in New York City. \nThe ceremony will be held shortly before the West Hill alumni game at Terry Connors Ice Rink at 3:30 p.m. \nThe event is in memory of Joey Comunale, 26, of Stamford, who was stabbed to death in New York earlier this month. \nComunale, 26, was last seen alive on Saturday at a party in the Upper East Side area of the city. \nHis body was found in Ocean Point, NJ Wednesday morning, 60 miles away from the Grand Sutton Condo building where he was partying. \nPolice charged 25-year-old James Rackover, of New York, NY and 28-year-old Lawrence Dilione, of Jersey City, NJ with second-degree murder, concealment of a human corpse and tampering with physical evidence. Dilione was also charged with first-degree hindering prosecution. \nComunale is believed to have been stabbed in the chest 15 times. \nFormer members of the hockey team who played with Comunale are encouraged to sign up and play in honor of him. \nThere will be no admission fee for fans who attend. \nCommemorative wrist bands will be available to honor Comunale. \nCopyright 2016 WFSB (Meredith Corporation).

      "title": "What Facebook knows about you and how to change it",
      "text": "SHARE Posted: 6:00 p.m. 0 \nGoogle and Facebook have amassed a sizeable profile of your likes and interests, a portfolio used to present you with ads and suggested content. But what if they have it wrong? Here's how to find out what Facebook thinks it knows about you, and how to change it if they've gotten it wrong. \nYou may not realize it, but every time you like a post, share a news story or video, or comment on a public post, Facebook is watching and using your actions to compile a detailed profile about you. In fact, sites like Facebook and Google even track your activities when you aren't actively logged into the site. \nEvery time you visit a website online, your computer stores a cookie with data about your activity on that site (assuming you haven't blocked cookies). These little data files store your login data (so you don't have to constantly re-login to sites that you frequent), preferences, even your shopping history and items you've searched for recently. While this can be helpful for your own seamless internet surfing, that data is also shared with Google and Facebook every time you click on a webpage's like or follow button or engage with that company on Facebook. In fact, simply visiting a website that has a \"like us on Facebook\" button gives Facebook a heads up that you may be interested in whatever that site is about. \nYou may be wondering what the point of all this tracking and meticulous profile compiling is. It all comes down to money. Marketers want to reach a specific audience with their message. Dog leash companies want to reach active dog owners, not retirement home residents or teenagers. They'll pay more for their ad to be presented to a \"targeted\" group of Facebook or Google visitors, so these sites have made it their business to segment users into categories that marketers are interested in. \nAll this data is termed \"meta data,\" and it has privacy experts concerned. While meta data is currently used for more effective marketing, Facebook receives an ever increasing number of requests by the government to turn over user data — Facebook received nearly 20,000 requests for user data in the second quarter of 2015 alone. See Facebook's report for specifics: http://bit.ly/2aICDHg \nWhat happens when the profile that's been compiled about you is incorrect? Not only will you likely see irrelevant ads, you could find yourself grouped into categories you may not want made public should the meta data one day be accessed and linked directly to you. Some users have even found that their \"interests\" erroneously included groups linked with terrorism: imagine if the government at some point utilized privately collected meta data to determine watch lists or investigation targets. Incorrect meta data could have dire consequences, should the separation between privately compiled meta data and the government become less distinct. \nLet's review a few examples. Facebook doesn't ask users for their ethnicity, and yet the site has likely assigned you an \"ethnic affinity\" based on your online activity. Interesting note: there is no \"white\" or \"Caucasian\" affinity. Apparently, that's the default. But because Facebook doesn't differentiate between \"interest in\" and \"belonging to,\" this is a category that's often incorrect. \nFacebook also assigns you a political leaning based on your online activity — do you \"like\" or comment on primarily conservative posts and share stories from conservative organizations? You'll likely find that you've been categorized as politically conservative. The primary concern with Facebook's political category is that the site controls the stories that you see in your news feed. While you'll still see stories and posts shared by friends regardless of your political leaning, you'll see sponsored stories that generally fall \"in line\" with what Facebook has determined to be your political affiliation. \nAccording to a recent report by Pew Research Center, nearly 62 percent of Americans say they depend on Facebook for news. If the site is only showing you stories that fall in line with what it believes to be your political leaning, you won't get a well-rounded view of current events. \nIf you'd like to see what Facebook thinks it knows about you, you're in luck. Visit your profile's ad preference page by logging in to Facebook and going to https://www.facebook.com/ads/preferences. Scroll through categories to see what sites and interests Facebook has linked you to. These are broken into categories like \"Lifestyle and Culture\" (the one with its determination of your ethnic and political affiliations) and Business and Industry, etc. \nInterest that you feel are inaccurate can be de-selected by hovering over the listing and then clicking the X in the upper right corner. While this won't eliminate your meta data history, it may stop you from seeing ads because the marketing agency in charge of its placement wished to target users with that particular interest. \nAds that seem off base, or that you find unappealing, can be manually blocked or you can find out what it is about your profile that has that particular ad targeting you. Just click the drop down arrow in the upper right corner and choose \"why am I seeing this?\" You'll see information about the audience that the marketer is targeting to see why you're being shown the ad. For example, a recent ad I was seeing for guarded trampolines reported: \n\"There may be other reasons you're seeing this ad, including that JumpSport Trampolines wants to reach people ages 25 to 44 who live or were recently in the United States. This is information based on your Facebook profile and where you've connected to the internet.\" \nThere's no real way to get around that one if I had a particular dislike for trampolines, other than blocking the ad itself. However, if I was tagged by Facebook as having an interest in bouncing, and that interest showed as one of the targets JumpSport wants to reach, de-selecting \"bouncing\" may reduce the likelihood that I'd see that ad again in the future.",

Post to Facebook Jeremy Lin created his own ‘Linology’ stats This is interesting.  //usat.ly/2g4Omn3   Jeremy Lin created his own ‘Linology’ stats Alysha Tsuji , USA TODAY 10:32 p.m. EST November 26, 2016 1 Shares \nBrooklyn Nets guard Jeremy Lin (left) looks on next to Brooklyn Nets center Brook Lopez (right) during the second half against the Phoenix Suns at Talking Stick Resort Arena. The Nets won 122-104. (Photo: Joe Camporeale-USA TODAY Sports) \nThat clipboard that Jeremy Lin has been seen writing on during games as he hangs out on the bench while out with a hamstring injury is Lin's way of staying involved with what's happening on the court. And it's not an ordinary stats sheet. \nIn the New York Times' Scott Cacciola's story about Brooklyn Nets head coach Kenny Atkinson, the coach revealed that Lin has created his own \"self-styled version of offensive-efficiency statistics.\" \nLin, the team's starting point guard, has remained involved by manning a clipboard on the bench during games so he can chart a self-styled version of offensive-efficiency statistics. \n\"Linology,\" Atkinson said. \"It's beautiful. It's his way of showing he cares. He asked me if he could do it, and I said, 'Yeah, sure.' And he just does it, and he hands it to me after every game, and then I hand it to - you know, I'm not exactly sure where it goes.\" \nWhile it's sad Atkinson isn't sure what happens to the stats after each game, it's an interesting piece of information about the Harvard grad. The Nets are struggling and off to a 4-11 start, but Lin has found a unique way to contribute something , even if he can't play (and even if his coach may not use it). \nAlthough, no matter how beautiful Lin's stats skills are, the Nets would definitely much rather have him back out on the court. \n(Thanks to Complex Sports for sharing.)

      "text": "Internet pranksters known as Trollstation have posted a video on Facebook claiming they were the ones behind Honey G's X Factor stage invasion on Saturday night (November 26). Four men were involved in storming the stage after Honey G had finished her first performance. The video posted shows them in the audience before the incident happened, with one member promising he would be making his debut on the show tonight. Trollstation also posted a video on their Twitter account claiming ownership of the prank. The video shows the full extent of what happened on stage, which looks like it would have been pretty terrifying for the rapper. X factor invasion pic.twitter.com/uBBNtoLGc9 — TrollStation (@TrollstationYT) November 26, 2016 Simon Cowell leapt to her side while Nicole Scherzinger stared at the stage in shock. The camera remained firmly on the judges while security were called to the stage to remove the pranksters. The invaders in question appeared to try and remove her signature hat and sunglasses. After the men had been removed, Honey G appeared shaken saying: \"I was a bit worried there, I thought it was a stunt.\" An X Factor spokesman has said: \"There was a stage invasion by four men, with one further person in support. All five had been in the audience. \"They were spoken to by police and security and have now been removed from the studio.\" There are no plans for further action at this stage. What's wrong w/ people that was not planed by the producers of @TheXFactor arrests have been made. For god sake I had to tweet to get info!! — Kelly! (@KellyOsbourne) November 26, 2016 Kelly Osbourne tweeted after the incident denying that it was staged, after Twitter erupted into debate. According to The Sun, the pranksters were jailed in May after scaring people with a fake art heist at the National Portrait Gallery. They have reported that five members of the gang were jailed for a total of 72 weeks after pleading guilty to two counts of using threatening behaviour and causing fear of unlawful violence. Quite heroically, Honey G went on to perform her second song and did one of the best Mannequin Challenges we've seen so far – even the judges got involved. The X Factor continues tomorrow night (November 24), when we will find out who will be leaving the competition next. ",

The airport's flying saucer-like \"Theme Building\" and signature LAX welcome sculpture are familiar sights for many Americans. And LAX has grown to become the USA's second- busiest airport in terms of passenger traffic this decade, trailing only Atlanta.\nLAX also is a popular spot for aviation buffs, who can witness a lineup of international airlines and range of aircraft types not seen at many other U.S. airports. Among U.S. airlines, American, Delta, United and Alaska Airlines each operate a hub or focus city there and all four have been adding new flight options at LAX in recent years. Southwest also has a significant presence at LAX.\nFor those wanting a closer look at LAX, check out the above \"Behind the scenes\" photo gallery. Most of the pictures comes from photojournalist and Today in the Sky contributor Jeremy Dwyer-Lindgren , who put together the above collection after spending a recent day roaming the grounds at LAX.

      "title": "How a tiny team in Tokyo is taking on Oculus and Sony",
      "text": "Most of the virtual reality headsets on the market are backed by huge companies: Facebook has its Oculus Rift and Sony makes the PlayStation VR, for example.\nBut a tiny Tokyo-based company, founded by former Sony game designer Yuka Kojima and Lochlainn Wilson, is taking them all on with its own high-end VR headset, and it even includes a new technology that the rest of the industry doesn't have yet.\nIn the next few months, Fove will start shipping its $599 headset (Fove 0) to people who preordered it. It requires a powerful Windows computer.\nIf you want one, you can preorder one for $599 on Fove (this version of the headset is aimed at game creators and enthusiasts though). You should get it in the next few months, depending on when Foxconn finishes production. \nThe most important feature of Fove, and what makes it a worthy competitor to Oculus and HTC Vive, is that it tracks your eyes. No other commercially sold VR headset does that at this point, although the competitors are trying to catch up quickly. (Google bought an eye tracking startup for $20 million last month.)\n\"When I was working at Sony Entertainment, one of my main passions was bringing more human and emotional reactions to video games,\" Kojima said in an email to Business Insider. \"I can’t wait to see what interactive narrative designers do with eye-tracking, or how VR worlds will seem more connected and real with characters that intelligently make eye contact and know where you are looking.\"\nEye tracking means that Fove can tell where you're looking while you're in virtual reality, which it turns out unlocks several important new possibilities.\nI got to try one of Fove's most advanced prototypes out last month. It was extremely cool. I played a \"Space Invaders\" style game, and I didn't have a gamepad. I simply glanced at the spaceships I wanted to shoot — these looks really could kill (digital space ships and aliens.) \nThere's one other big way that Fove differs from other virtual reality companies — the Tokyo-based company was cofounded by a Japanese woman in the mostly-male, largely-American world of virtual reality. \n\"To be honest, there are not a great deal of advantages to being a woman in the VR industry. What matters most is that you have the right tech and you have the right timing. We think we have both,\" Kojima said. \"I don’t think too much about being a female founder in tech, though, I prefer to focus my energy on the next task at hand.\"\nWhy does eye tracking matter?  Fove Fove launched as a Kickstarter  in 2014. At the time, it blew past its goal, becoming the 2nd most successful VR Kickstarter of all time, only behind a small project called Oculus Rift, which was eventually bought by Facebook for $2 billion. \nThe reason why Fove caught the interest of the virtual reality community is that it promised \"foveated rendering,\" or a next-gen VR concept that is poised to become a very big deal. \nIf you look inside the Fove headset, you'll see a few little specs of technology near where your eyes rest inside the headset.\nFove These are infrared sensors, and they track where the pupil of your eye is looking. It's not as easy as it sounds — your eye darts from place to place, your gaze wanders and doesn't go in a straight line, and to really make eye tracking useful, it needs to be extremely fast and extremely accurate.\nBut if you can track where the user is looking, what you can do is make sure the spot on the screen where they're looking is extremely detailed, and spend less time and power drawing super detailed parts of the scene in the users' peripheral vision. \nThat's foveated rendering, and it's an important technology because it's believed to reduce the power requirements for VR so that you won't need a powerful computer hooked up to the headset. $4.5 billion headset startup Magic Leap uses foveated rendering as one of its core technologies, for example. \n\"We’re planning to combine our eye tracking with facial tracking to fully immerse people into VR,\"  Kojima said. \nPreviously, high-end eye tracking was only available in research contexts, and required expensive machines. Now Fove is selling a capable eye-tracking headset for $599. \nWhat's next?  Fove Fove is very clear that its headset is not for everyday consumers. On its pre-order page, the company makes clear that the first Fove is \"for developers, researchers, and creators.\" \nAdd one more target market: the company is actively looking to outfit video arcades and internet cafes with Fove headsets, Fove director of strategy  Jim Preston told Business Insider. VR arcades are a booming business , especially in Asia, Preston said.  \nFor explorers who do end up buying a Fove, there also isn't a lot of software available for gamers yet. The Fove headset ships with a few demos, and it also supports a few open-source gaming engines, but the company is small and doesn't have the big developer budget of a company like Facebook. \nThe company does expect to get an influx of money in the spring when it raises a Series B. The company already raised $11 million in a Series A earlier this year, primarily from Asian investors, including Foxconn, which is manufacturing the Fove. \nPreston said in the upcoming round it's soliciting investment from Western, Silicon Valley-oriented venture capitalists as well, although it's too early to announce anything. \nFove expects to continue refining the Fove headset, but it also knows it has technology that other companies might like to use in its virtual reality and augmented reality projects. Licensing its eye-tracking tech is possible in the company's future, Preston said. \nNOW WATCH: A mysterious cloud moving 700,000 mph is going to collide with our galaxy — here's what will happen \n",

      "text": "The Social Internet Thoughts about sharing our lives via Twitter, Tumblr, Facebook, and Wordpress I often spend the quieter moments of each day on the internet — as an escape from the mayhem that generally surrounds me. Late on an evening the internet has provided a reminder that there is a bigger world than the kids, the school, our house, and our jobs.\nHere’s the thing though — I can’t remember the last time I sat down and read a book. It’s almost impossible at home because there’s always something going on — unless you count reading in bed. The last time I tried to read in bed my other half woke me as she turned in for the night — propped up, chin on my chest, book fallen to my side.\nThe interesting thing to me is that each major internet social platform is not social in it’s own special way.\nFacebook is best suited to family, friends, and psychotic people you once knew or went to school with who you will one day “un-friend”, and receive hate mail from. If you’re going to share anything vaguely aspirational, you better be ready for the ensuing pissing competition among your acquaintances.\nWordPress is perfect for long rambling tomes of navel gazage. If you’ve always wanted to write a novel about yourself in 20,000 parts, this is the place to do it. You can enable all manner of social sharing gadgetary, but it will not be used because in reality you’re the only person remotely interesting in your own life.\nWhile feeling good about yourself, Tumblr is the perfect place to invest time in order to realise that no, you do not matter. No matter how creative you think you might be, a re-blogged photo of a kitten, or some model’s backside is always going to attract far more attention than your insightful commentary about the day.\nIf Tumblr is shallow, Twitter is positively vacuous. Think of it as the perfect place to drip meaningless content into a vast, fast flowing river. You are one voice among millions, and even if thousands follow you, nobody is really listening, because the stream is filled with soap-box demonstrators investing just enough effort to type 140 characters, but nothing more towards the causes they promote.\nAnybody that follows my Instagram feed probably wonders what the hell I’m playing at — posting photos of wine glasses, coffee cups, railway platforms, and such like. I guess in many ways it’s a reaction against the narcissists.\nI get it. I get why people post their face over and over again on Tumblr, Instagram, and Snapchat. It’s validation. Validation that we’re not that bad — that somebody out there likes us. I’ve always felt there’s kind of a line in the sand though — and you slowly learn that some people are only out there to attract attention — not to forge a friendship. You essentially become statistics on a graph to them. Not everybody — just more than I have ever been comfortable with.\nYou might wonder why I bother with the social internet at all, if I’m so opposed to so many of the people that use it. Fox Mulder once said that all of the evidence to the contrary isn’t entirely dissuasive. I think the same is true of people on the internet. If you can stand being in the middle of the mayhem for a while, you notice the quieter people on the periphery. The people that don’t typically get their chance in the sun, because all the ass-hats stole the sun-loungers. The quiet people have been the only thing that has made the social internet persuasive for me for some time.\nWe share thoughts, hopes, and dreams with each other. We confide in each other. We will likely never meet each other, and yet we count each other as closer friends than those we know in the real world. We have shared each other’s secrets and fears. We catch each other when down. We become a significant part of the reason to keep going each day — to keep getting up — to keep going to work — to keep putting one foot in front of the other.\nWhat am I saying here? Maybe that while the social internet is flawed in all sorts of ways — perhaps not by design, but by the nature of the way people use it — the people are also the reason to persevere with it. Among the ass-hats, idiots, and morons, there are truly wonderful people, and if we don’t notice them, our lives might never be enriched by their presence.",

      "text": "How social media is shaking the world \n’s outcome. In response, both Google and Facebook altered their advertising policies to explicitly prohibit sites that traffic in fake news from making money off lies. That’s very likely a worthwhile fix, even if it comes too late. The internet has loosened our collective grasp on the truth, and efforts to fight that dismaying trend are obviously worth pursuing.Yet it would be a mistake to end this investigation at fake news. In fact, the dangers posed by fake news are just a symptom of a deeper truth now dawning on the world: With billions of people glued to Facebook, WhatsApp, WeChat, Instagram, Twitter, Weibo and other popular services, social media has become an increasingly powerful cultural and political force, to the point that its effects are now beginning to alter the course of global events.The election of Donald Trump is perhaps the starkest illustration yet that across the planet, social networks are helping to fundamentally rewire human society. They have subsumed and gutted mainstream media. They have undone traditional political advantages like fundraising and access to advertising. And they are destabilising and replacing old-line institutions and established ways of doing things, including political parties, transnational organisations and longstanding, unspoken social prohibitions against blatant expressions of racism and xenophobia.Most important, because these services allow people to communicate with one another more freely, they are helping to create surprisingly influential social organisations among once-marginalised groups. These ad hoc social movements range widely in form, from “alt-right” white supremacists in the United States to Brexiters in Britain to the Islamic State in the Middle East to the hacker collectives of Eastern Europe and Russia. But each in its own way is now wielding previously unthinkable power, resulting in unpredictable, sometimes destabilizing geopolitical spasms.“You now have billions of people on the internet, and most of them are not that happy with the status quo,” said Ian Bremmer, the president of the Eurasia Group, a research firm that forecasts global risks. “They think their local government is authoritarian. They think they’re on the wrong side of the establishment. They’re aggrieved by identity politics and a hollowed-out middle class.”Many factors accounted for Trump’s win: middle-class economic anxiety in the industrial Midwest; an inchoate desire for some kind of change in the national direction; and some mix of latent racism, xenophobia and sexism across the electorate. But as even Trump acknowledged in an interview with “60 Minutes” aired Sunday, social media played a determining role in the race.In the past, Bremmer said, the concerns of Trump’s supporters might have been ignored, and his candidacy would almost certainly have foundered. After all, he was universally written off by just about every mainstream pundit, and he faced disadvantages in money, organisation and access to traditional political expertise. Yet by putting out a message that resonated with people online, Trump hacked through every established political order.“Through this new technology, people are now empowered to express their grievances and to follow people they see as echoing their grievances,” Bremmer said. “If it wasn’t for social media, I don’t see Trump winning.”For people who like an orderly, predictable world, this is the scariest thing about Facebook; not that it may be full of lies (a problem that could potentially be fixed), but that its scope gives it real power to change history in bold, unpredictable ways.But that’s where we are. It’s time to start recognising that social networks actually are becoming the world-shattering forces that their boosters long promised they would be — and to be unnerved, rather than exhilarated, by the huge social changes they could uncork.This should come as no surprise. In a way, we are now living through a kind of bizarro version of the utopia that some in tech once envisioned would be unleashed by social media.Over much of the past decade, we have seen progressive social movements powered by the web spring up across the world. There was the Green Revolution in Iran and the Arab Spring in the Middle East and North Africa. In the United States, we saw the Occupy Wall Street movement and the #BlackLivesMatter protests.Social networks also played a role in electoral politics — first in the ultimately unsuccessful candidacy of Howard Dean in 2003, and then in the election of the first African-American president in 2008. Yet now those movements look like the prelude to a wider, tech-powered crackup in the global order.In Britain this year, organising on Facebook played a major role in the once-unthinkable push to get the country to leave the European Union. In the Philippines, Rodrigo Duterte, a firebrand mayor who was vastly outspent by opponents, managed to marshal azzz huge army of online supporters to help him win the presidency.The Islamic State has used social networks to recruit jihadis from around the world to fight in Iraq and Syria, as well as to inspire terrorist attacks overseas.And in the United States, both Bernie Sanders, a socialist who ran for president as a Democrat, and Trump, who was once reviled by most members of the party he now leads, relied on online movements to shatter the political status quo.Why is this all happening now? Clay Shirky, a professor at New York University who has studied the effects of social networks, suggested a few reasons.One is the ubiquity of Facebook, which has reached a truly epic scale. Last month the company reported that about 1.8 billion people now log on to the service every month. Because social networks feed off the various permutations of interactions among people, they become strikingly more powerful as they grow. With about a quarter of the world’s population now on Facebook, the possibilities are staggering.“When the technology gets boring, that’s when the crazy social effects get interesting,” Shirky said.One of those social effects is what Shirky calls the “shifting of the Overton Window,” a term coined by the researcher Joseph P Overton to describe the range of subjects that the mainstream media deems publicly acceptable to discuss.From about the early 1980s until the very recent past, it was usually considered unwise for politicians to court views deemed by most of society to be out of the mainstream, things like overt calls to racial bias (there were exceptions, of course, like the Willie Horton ad). But the internet shifted that window.“White ethnonationalism was kept at bay because of pluralistic ignorance,” Shirky said. “Every person who was sitting in their basement yelling at the TV about immigrants or was willing to say white Christians were more American than other kinds of Americans — they didn’t know how many others shared their views.”Thanks to the internet, now each person with once-maligned views can see that he’s not alone. And when these people find one another, they can do things — create memes, publications and entire online worlds that bolster their worldview, and then break into the mainstream. The groups also become ready targets for political figures like Trump, who recognise their energy and enthusiasm and tap into it for real-world victories.Shirky notes that the Overton Window isn’t just shifting on the right. We see it happening on the left, too. Sanders campaigned on an anti-Wall Street platform that would have been unthinkable for a Democrat just a decade ago.Now, after Hillary Clinton’s loss, the way forward for Democrats will very likely be determined as much by collectives on Facebook as by elites in Washington — and, as a result, we’re likely to see more unlikely candidates and policy positions than we would have in the past. The upshot is further unforeseen events.“We’re absolutely going to get more of these insurgent candidates, and more crazy social effects,” Shirky said.Trump is just the tip of the iceberg. Prepare for interesting times.",

      "text": "Facebook twitter Google November 27, 2016 China's new mach 6 hypersonic missile has over twice the range of best US air to air missile and new drones could create a stealth plane targeting network A Chinese J-16 strike fighter recently test-fired a mach 6 hypersonic missiles to successfully destroying the target drone at a very long range. The hypersonic missile has a range of between 200-310 miles. The U.S. military’s own longest-range air-to-air missile, the AIM-120 Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missile. The AMRAAM is just 12 feet long and seven inches in diameter. The latest version of the American missile, the AIM-120D, reportedly boasts a maximum range in excess of 90 miles. Launched by a fighter flying as high as 50,000 feet, the Chinese missile could climb to an altitude of around 100,000 feet and glide in the thin air for more than a hundred miles before descending to strike its target Beijing’s VLRAAM reportedly features an active electronically-scanned array seeker with optical back-up and mid-course satellite guidance—truly state of the art for an air-to-air missile. The AIM-120D makes do with an older-style, and less effective, mechanically-steered radar. VLRAAM missile on J-16 The Chinese military is apparently working on a solution to the identification problem, and has proposed building a targeting network around the high-flying Divine Eagle sensor drone. A Divine Eagle could pass targeting data to a VLRAAM-armed fighter—and potentially even to the missile itself, provided any operational version of the munition incorporates a datalink. Divine eagle drones The Divine Eagle is a low observable, high altitude UAV meant detect stealth aircraft at long ranges, using special purpose radars. China's giant UAV has been getting a lots of international attention. With its giant, double bodied design, carrying high performance anti-stealth radars, the drones are a potential key part of China's offensive and defensive military strategy in the coming years. Formations of Divine Eagle UAVs are expected to provide an early warning line to detect threats to China's airspace, like cruise missiles and stealth bombers, as well as be able to take on such missions as hunting for aircraft carriers in the open waters of the Pacific. By using the single deck bus in the background (probably 3.2 meters tall, like most buses of its type) as a very crude visual yardstick, a very rough comparison suggests that the Divine Eagle is about 6 meters tall, and 15 meters long (since most high altitude large UAVs have a wingspan to body length ratio of 2.5:1 to 3:1, the wingspan of the Divine Eagle is likely its be 35 to 45 meters across). With a maximum take off weight of at least 15 tons, the Divine Eagle is the world's largest UAV, edging out the RQ-4 Global Hawk. Author:",

People like Jill Stein are glorifying him, and CNN ran “tribute pieces” on the tyrant leader as if he were actually going to be missed. My god, you idiot liberals – people fled for their lives to escape this madman. Yet, liberals are treating a Communist tyrant like a folk hero. Typical progressive mentality. ….and they wonder why they lost the election? Marco Rubio, a Cuban-American, reminds liberals that Castro was a BRUTAL dictator and his death does not change the way Cuba is ruled since Castro’s brother has been running the country for the past decade.",

      "title": "Anne Rice Is Making Her Own 'Vampire Chronicles' Series & She's The Perfect Woman For The Job",
      "text": "By Loretta Donelan just now \nIn a Facebook post on Saturday, writer Anne Rice revealed that a Vampire Chronicles series might be coming soon. Rice, who wrote the first installment of the bestselling series in 1976 , revealed on Facebook that she had the books' rights and intention to create a TV show out of them. It's a thrilling announcement from the beloved author, and fans should start getting excited about the upcoming show. Wrote Rice on Facebook, The theatrical rights to the Vampire Chronicles are once again in my hands, free and clear! I could not be more excited about this! --- A television series of the highest quality is now my dream for Lestat, Louis, Armand, Marius and the entire tribe. In this the new Golden Age of television, such a series is THE way to let the entire story of the vampires unfold. \nFor those unfamiliar with The Vampire Chronicles , Rice wrote Interview with the Vampire, the first book in the series, in 1976. The series follows French vampire Lestat de Lioncourt and his fellow vampires over the course of 11 books and counting. You might be familiar with the 1994 movie adaptation of Interview with the Vampire, which starred Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt. Other film versions of the series have been made, and in 2014, Universal Pictures acquired the series' rights with the intention to develop them into films. However, Rice's post clarified that that deal didn't work out. \"It is,\" she explained, \"more than ever, abundantly clear that television is where the vampires belong.\" [Embed] \nRice and her son Christopher Rice will serve as executive producers and write the pilot script on the new series. The author explained her intention to include all the many scenarios, characters, and plots in the books in a \"Game of Thrones style faithful rendering of this material.\" She also described herself as \"filled with optimism this morning about the future for my beloved Brat Prince.\" [Embed] \nIt's great to see Rice so enthusiastic about her upcoming creation, especially considering the influence she's already had on pop culture throughout her career. The \"sympathetic vampire\" phenomenon that has manifested in massive hits like Twilight, True Blood, The Vampire Diaries, and more likely would not exist without Rice's books, but until now, the author herself hasn't been directly involved with any of the more modern vampire films and TV shows. \nWith the new show, though, she'll not only get to be involved, but she'll be in a position of power where she has a say in what happens (Rice was reportedly not particularly happy with the movie adaptation of Interview, as she hated Tom Cruise's casting ). Writers don't always get the chance to be so involved in the adaptations of their creations, and sadly, women don't often get the chance to write or executive produce TV shows. Female auteurs are far too rare , and I hope that a series created by a woman as talented and beloved as Rice can become the next Game of Thrones. Must Reads ",

      "text": "John chalekson was recently restricted from linkedin.com. Please follow me on Facebook. 13 mins ago What a shitshow that was. Jill Stein is irrelevant Jill Stein is asking for recounts in Democrat states, even Michigan which has already recounted votes. Wisconsin has agreed to recount the votes and don’t be shocked if they find thousands of Democrat votes. Republicans better monitor this closely. Stein has collected $4.8 million plus but won’t promise the money will go to a recount.The fine print reads: We cannot guarantee a recount will happen in any of these states we are targeting. We can only pledge we will demand recounts in those states. If we raise more than what’s needed, the surplus will also go toward election integrity efforts and to promote voting system reform. Does anyone believe that the woman who garnered less than 1% of the vote is getting this money from the grassroots? She’s not. Read on. Remember when Hillary said she wanted Trump to accept the election results? Well Hillary’s lawyer just said she will join Stein in asking for the recount. Hillarys lawyer said today that she is behind the recount. Some are saying she shouldn’t have conceded when she did but reportedly received a phone call from Barack Obama telling her to concede. The left has not given up on putting Hillary in the White House and this is a threat, not to be taken lightly. There is already evidence that death threats were sent to multiple electors, but that didn’t work. Many believe Soros and Podesta are behind this. An investigative journalist reports donations to Jill Stein’s recount campaign are being made programmatically at a steady rate of $160,000 per hour A post on Reddit citing an investigative journalist reads as follows: Jim Stone says he discovered a Soros bot funding Stein’s recount campaign. According to the post, donations to Jill Stein’s election recount campaign are being made at a steady rate of $160,000 on the hour every hour of the day. The constant rate of donation, 24 hours a day, suggest that a computer program is being used to post the donations as opposed to real people making grassroots donation. However, the donations are being reported as grassroots donations from a myriad of online supporters to help her verify the integrity of the election. Be alert! This is no small matter. These people don’t care if they start a revolution. They are angry and they don’t give up power easily.",

      "text": "(Before It's News)\nMost people who use social media have figured out that Facebook and Google are in cahoots with the government, for those who are well aware of the issues it’s high time you switched over to Seen.life . It is a website that is similar to Facebook but without all the censorship.\nSeveral flashpoints could erupt into a global conflict involving the US, China and Russia, it is claimed.\nTHE world is closer to a catastrophic and bloody World War III than at any other point in the past 60 years, experts have warned.\nRussia and China, both of which are pumping vast amounts of money into their militaries, could soon rival the US in terms of power and prestige.\nPotential WWIII triggers are located in Poland, Syria and the South China Sea\nExperts believe there are a number of trigger points that could set off WWIII\nAll three nations want to remain a global superpower – if not the only one – and are preparing for war, it is claimed.\nBut they oppose each other on a swathe of issues across the globe, creating a delicate political balance that could collapse and engulf nuclear states and alliances such as NATO.\nA range of experts have identified several flashpoints across the globe which are today the most likely triggers for such a war.\nThe proximity of NATO and Russian bombers flying over Syria, Vladimir Putin’s aggression in eastern Europe, and China’s movements in the South China Sea are among them.\nMORE -RED ALERT:War Is Coming, The Whole World Knows It Except The People Of The United States.Wake Up People!\nExperts have also raised concerns about the instability of nuclear-power Pakistan as extremist factions and terrorist groups within the country grow in power.\nAdding to this is these groups’ sworn opposition to neighbouring India – which holds its own much-coveted nuclear arsenal.\nBritain’s Admiral Lord West told The Sun Online: “Basically none of us know what is going to happen but we are in a more dangerous, chaotic and unpredictable time than any other in my 50 years in the force.\nNorth Korean soldiers march through Pyongyang during a military parade last year carrying nuclear-marked backpacks\n“I believe that because of Brexit, I think Europe is very flaky, I think it is unfortunate that we didn’t stay in, because they actually need our military expertise.\n“I can see bits of Europe breaking up and when Europe gets into a mess, twice in the past we’ve had to go in there and clear it up with immense loss of blood and lives.”\nHe warned that Britain was not sufficiently investing in its defence – and in particular, its Royal Navy.\nThe investment required to maintain its strength had not materialised in the years since the Falklands War, he said, leaving Britain in a precarious place.\nRussian army soldiers sit on a military vehicle in Palmyra, Syria. Putin has used the conflict as a test-run for his new weaponry\nRUSSIA AND THE BALTIC STATES In July, a 25-page report by the US-based think tank Atlantic Council warned of Russia’s growing threat to NATO.\nNATO has been Europe’s primary military alliance since WWII – all 28 member states have sworn to respond as a group if a single member is attacked.\nThe council’s report warned that Russia was an “existential threat to the Baltic states and Poland” and an annexation could be implemented “with great speed”.\nIt continued: “This might come at a time NATO and the EU are distracted by another crisis, or it might relate to some particular high profile event, the outcomes of which Moscow wants to shape.\nRussia’s Vladimir Putin is becoming increasingly aggressive towards the NATO-aligned Baltic states.\n“It might also result from a misperception of NATO’s activities and a miscalculation of the Alliance’s resolve.”\nAdmiral Lord West also said: “Russia under Putin is becoming quite aggressive, it’s spending a large amount of money on its military capabilities.\n“Putin has said he believes in using tactical nuclear weapons if there is a war. That is highly dangerous.\n“There’s little debate that he thinks of the Baltic states and possibly Poland as a Russian sphere of influence. They are NATO countries – I find that extremely dangerous.”\n“I think people like Putin understand robust responses, they understand military power. I think he thinks he’ll pick (the Baltic states) off one-by-one.”\nRussian soldiers bearing no identifying insignia march through a Ukrainian naval base during their annexation of the region in 2014\nExperts warn Putin may be planning more surprise invasions of other Baltic states\nCLASHES OVER SYRIA Another point of simmering tensions is Syria, where US and Russia are both carrying out airstrikes in support of opposing groups.\nWhile they share a common foe in ISIS , the US has backed Kurdish and moderate Syrian rebel groups against President Bashar al-Assad.\nRussia, on the other hand, is backing al-Assad against the rebels.\nWith both countries carrying out air raids across the relatively small area, the chances of accidental clashes and misperceptions is high.\nMORE- KIM JONG UN Is Ready For Nuclear War-KIM JONG UN IS HELL-BENT ON A NUCLEAR WAR WITH THE U.S.\nPeter W. Singer, a leading expert on future war, wrote in The Daily Telegraph last year: “As in the past, it is perfectly possible that a third world war could start with a small event, or even by accident.\n“One of the many Russian bomber planes now probing NATO’s borders could collide with an RAF Typhoon, prompting an aerial skirmish the likes of which the world has not seen for decades.\nA Russian fighter jet was shot down by Turkey last year in a frightening example of how small incidents can quickly escalate\nThe downing of the jet triggered a massive diplomatic fallout between the two countries\n“Indeed, the skies over Syria are starting to get dangerously crowded, with Russian jets flying near US planes on bombing runs, and sparring with NATO air defences in neighbouring Turkey.”\nSuch an incident – albeit on a much smaller scale – was seen in November when Turkey downed a Russian jet it claimed it had encroached on its airspace during raids in Syria.\nThe incident led to a collapse in diplomatic relations between the two countries and sparked weeks of mudslinging between Ankara and Moscow.\nWith neither side prepared to lose face, their military posturing only came back from the brink after a Russian soldier was photographed travelling through the Bosphorus Strait brandishing a rocket launcher.\nTHE SOUTH CHINA SEA In the past few years China has moved aggressively to dominate the South China Sea with the construction of artificial islands containing fighter jet bunkers.\nThe move has alarmed countries such as Vietnam, Malaysia and the Philippines who dispute its territorial claims in the region.\nFuthermore, it has aggravated Japan and South Korea – two key members of a Pacific bloc the US has sworn to protect.\nA photograph taken by the Philippines Department of Defence shows a Chinese ship cruising through the disputed territory\nChina has aggressively built artificial islands, such as this one pictured, where it will base fleets of jet planes\nPeter W. Singer is also among those to suggest World War III could be triggered when “a Japanese or American ship scrapes paint with its Chinese Navy counterpart amid the reefs in the Pacific that are being militarized as part of Asia’s current arms race”.\nIndeed, Chinese military commanders – who are pushing ahead with new submarine deployments into the US’s Pacific sphere – believe this to be a genuine and legitimate scenario.\nAfter a close call last year, China’s naval commander Admiral Wu Shengli warned his US counterpart: “If the United States continues with these kinds of dangerous, provocative acts, there could well be a seriously pressing situation between frontline forces from both sides on the sea and in the air, or even a minor incident that sparks war.”\nMORE- WW III EMP USA Russian Navy To Be Sunk? Diego Garcia Air Attack Aleppo No Fly Zone Syria\nTHE COLLAPSE OF NUCLEAR PAKISTAN Experts have long feared the collapse of nuclear-armed Pakistan – a country rife with instability, terror groups and with a sworn hatred of neighbour India.\nThe concern is that its nuclear arsenal could fall into the hands of non-state groups ready to use it against the West, or other proxy groups.\nIt is feared nuclear-armed Pakistan is too unstable to keep its atomic bombs secure from extremists\nNotably, Pakistan was the birthplace of the Taliban – a fundamentalist Islamic group that spread into Afghanistan and ran the country following its war with the Soviet Union.\nA British Ministry of Defence report released in January earmarked the region as one that will continue to generate threats to the UK.\nIt also warned that “inter-state conflict and internal instability” were possible.\nA March report by Harvard Kennedy School stated the “risk of nuclear theft in Pakistan appears to be high”.\nThe Quote: : “The trend seems to be toward increasing risk, as Pakistan’s nuclear arsenal expands and shifts toward tactical nuclear weapons, while adversary capabilities remain extremely high.\n“Over the longer term, the possibilities of state collapse or extremist takeover cannot be entirely ruled out.”\nPakistan is home to a powerful faction of the Taliban (pictured) who run rampant in the country’s north\n‘BE READY FOR WAR’: LEADING EXPERT’S DIRE WARNING George Friendman, the founder of geopolitical forecaster STRATFOR, has warned: “Be ready for war.”\nMr Friedman has written extensively about emerging trends and international affairs.\nHe recently told Business Insider that interstate war – such as that seen during World War I and II, is a recurring characteristic of politics.\n“There has never been a century that has not had a systemic war — a systemic war, meaning when the entire system convulses.\n“Do you want to bet this will be the only century that doesn’t have one? I’ll take that bet.\n“When you have the countries like Germany, China, and Russia decline, and be replaced by others, that’s when systemic wars start.\n“That’s when it gets dangerous, because they haven’t yet reached a balance. So Germany united in 1871 and all hell broke loose.\n“Japan rose in the early 20th century, and then you had chaos.",

      "text": "  \"Adrian Granat to fight on March 18\" Facebook \nAfter the top heavyweight prospect Adrian Granat landed a stunning victory over German boxer Franz Rill by way of KO in round 6 on October 15th, a growing crowd of international boxing experts around the globe have now started paying serious attention to the 25 year old Swedish rising star of the heavyweight division. \nHowever the reputation does not only have a positive impact as the Promoter Erol Ceylan explains: \n“To be honest, people are getting respect for Adrian Granat right now. The way he knocked out Rill in the last fight, knowing exactly where and when to land his heavy punches at Rill, made it very clear to everyone that it was not just a lucky punch that ended the fight. Adrian really ceased his opportunity. Furthermore rumours have also started to circulate about how well Adrian performed at both the training camp of Vladimir Klitschko before Vladimir´s fight against Fury and at the training camp of Povetkin. Added to that the fact that Adrian has basically knocked out all of his opponents in the opening rounds in 13 of his 14 fights makes it difficult to find a competitive opponent for Adrian now, as a matter of fact several top fighters who we have contacted have turned down our offer. However there is another top prospect that did not turn down our offer; Bogdan Dinu (16-0-0, 12 KO`s), who expressed an interest in fighting Granat and therefore we are currently negotiating with his team – negotiations which are going well so far “. \nAs Adrian Granat´s Manager Christer Enqvist recently visited Malmö to establish the first contacts for the upcoming “Home Coming Fight Night” event, he was positively surprised; \n“ I was overwhelmed by the genuine enthusiasm of the people in Malmö since hearing the rumours of Adrian Granat possibly fighting in Malmö in the near future. In Malmö people follow professional boxing and the incredible progress of Adrian Granat on the world rankings. Especially the employees of the City of Malmö were really happy of professional boxing returning to their home town and that through their native professional heavyweight boxer Adrian Granat. Everybody has really given us a friendly and warm welcome for this upcoming event ”. \nAlso two other famous native Malmö fighters will fight at the “Home Coming Fight Night” – Sven Fornling and Simon Henriksson, both who are very promising fighters, well recognized in Sweden and now having their chance in a life time to prove themselves in their home town in front of an enthusiastic home crowd. \nAn official press conference with these 3 Swedish boxers attending will be held on December 5, 2 PM at the Malmö Arena Hotel – Sky Bar, and the sale of tickets will start in December.

Please follow me on Facebook. 5 mins ago #RonPaul Rages At Washington Post's McCarthyist Accusations: \"Expect Such Attacks To Continue\" #WashingtonPost #BoycottAmazon #JeffBezos #BoycottWashingtonPost #RonPaulInstitute \"The Washington Post has a history of misrepresenting Ron Paul’s views. Last year the supposed newspaper of record ran a feature article by David A. Fahrenthold in which Fahrenthold grossly mischaracterized Paul as an advocate for calamity, oppression, and poverty — the opposite of the goals Paul routinely expresses and, indeed, expressed clearly in a speech at the event upon which Fahrenthold’s article purported to report. Such fraudulent attacks on the prominent advocate for liberty and a noninterventionist foreign policy fall in line with the newspaper’s agenda. As Future of Freedom Foundation President Jacob G. Hornberger put it in a February editorial, the Post’s agenda is guided by “the interventionist mindset that undergirds the mainstream media.” On Thursday, the Post published a new article by Craig Timberg complaining of a “flood” of so-called fake news supported by “a sophisticated Russian propaganda campaign that created and spread misleading articles online with the goal of punishing Democrat Hillary Clinton, helping Republican Donald Trump and undermining faith in American democracy,” To advance this conclusion, Timberg points to PropOrNot, an organization of anonymous individuals formed this year, as having identified “more than 200 websites as routine peddlers of Russian propaganda during the election season.” Look on the PropOrNot list. There is the Ron Paul Institute for Peace and Prosperity’s (RPI) website RonPaulInstitute.org listed among websites termed “Russian propaganda outlets.”",

Please follow me on Facebook. 8 mins ago Trump’s Video Is Evidence that Liberty Is Winning #PresidentElectTrump Trump doesn't need the #Media which technology is making irrelevant. \"Now this is very interesting. The president-elect in a transition might normally address the American people through network television. This is how it has normally been done. Donald Trump took another path. His transition team snagged a free YouTube channel, set up a camera, and pushed out a 2-and-a-half minute video on his transition priorities (which didn’t include health care, by the way). It’s had a million views in less than 24 hours. Think of the significance of this. The incoming president is using exactly the same technology that you and I have in our pocket. What a transformation! FDR ruled the American mind through his special access to radio (his “fireside chats”). This continued through the rise of network television. The monopoly was only recently smashed. \"",

That's good - glad he's our quarterback.\" Belichick on Brady \"A quarterback's job is to win, he's won a lot, glad he's our quarterback.\" #Patriots pic.twitter.com/WdvBEiC1wg — Chad Amaral (@chad_amaral) November 28, 2016 \nSounds about right. \nBrady passed for 286 yards and two touchdowns in the Patriots' 22-17 win over the Jets.

      "text": "Share How to Get Recruited for College Swimming on Facebook \nThis little guy was originally posted over at YourSwimBook.com . Join Olivier’s weekly motivational newsletter by clicking here. \nIn this post I am going to share with you how to get recruited for college swimming . For many high school athletes it’s the dream – getting their post-secondary education paid for while competing for a top-tier university program. Gone will be the days where you had to fundraise to go to meets, car-pool in your buddy’s rusty old wagon to get meets, and into the days of luxury transportation (coach bus?), free gear and the chance to compete at the NCAA Championships, one of the fastest competitions on the planet. \nThe reality, of course, is a little more muddled. \nHere are 8 tips to help clear things up and make your chase towards attaining that dream of getting recruited a reality— \n1. Let the NCAA know your intent. \nBack in my day it was known as the the NCAA clearinghouse (sounds more like a sweepstakes, and for some athletes, it takes on that type of importance…), these days it is referred to as the NCAA Eligibility Center. To declare eligibility head on over and register online here: http://www.eligibilitycenter.org . It costs $70 if you are an American or Canadian student, $120 for other international students. \n2. Make sure you are taking the right classes. \nSeems like a no-brainer, but you would be amazed by how many students believe they can get by on their athletic prowess alone. \nAs per the 2015/2016 NCAA eligibility requirements, here is the bare bones list of courses student-athletes looking to play Div 1 athletes must possess: Graduate from high school (duh) Finish 16 core courses within four consecutive academic years: 4 years of English 2 years of natural or physical science 1 supplemental year of English, math, or science 2 years of social science 4 years of bonus courses from any of the above categories or a foreign language, comparative religion or philosophy. \n3. Swim your butt off. \nEverything else on this list – while important – isn’t as critical as this and school. It’s as simple as this – the faster you swim, the harder you are going to be recruited. \n4. Be mindful of your social media presence. \nWe live in a world where our personal lives are splashed across vast social networks. Be attentive to what people will find when they Google of enter your name into Facebook. Having a profile picture that shows how fun and awesome you are is great and fine, but keep in mind that programs aren’t looking to bring on party-animals, they are looking for smart, intelligent and responsible young people. \nMarketing companies call this type of thing “reputation management.” I call it “Don’t post embarrassing pictures of yourself doing compromising crap on Facebook.” \n5. Build a list of schools you have a crush on. \nHere’s the fun part. Day-dreaming about the awesome schools that you want to attend. Grab a pen, a piece of paper (okay, okay – a tablet will do as well) and let’s get to day-dreaming.Break your list down by— The dream schools. The realistic, yet still also quite dreamy schools. The fall-backs. \nThere will be overlap between all three, but knowing which schools you want to attend will help you narrow your activities moving forward. Write it out, tape it up to your wall, and have that list visible on those nights where you don’t feel like doing your homework. \n6. Check out the schools. \nResearch is a lot easier these days with the whole interweb thing. Beyond the official site for college teams, swim news sites also carry stats, news and results for your prospective schools. The coach’s profile on athletics department websites are almost always fairly thorough as their website is also used as a recruiting and promotional tool for their programs. \nLooking at the line-up on the current squad can also give you an idea of what their coach will be looking for next year. Let’s say that you are a freestyler. If school A has three senior freestylers not coming back next season you know that program is going to be on the hunt for a new freestyler whose name might just rhyme with yours. \nAnother benefit of ye olde interweb is that it is easy to reach out to former and current swimmers from the school and get the low-down. Building those connections into referrals down the road can help you appear even more attractive to coaches. Approaching them is simple – let them know you are considering going to their alma matter and to see if they have any hints, tips or pointers they’d be willing to share. Sometimes this is a good way to get a peak under the hood of the program, especially the unvarnished parts you don’t see on a brochure or on the website. \n7. Visit the school. \nOfficial visits are paid for by the institution, including transportation and room and board. Each institution does this step differently, but while you are there take the opportunity to talk to fellow athletes and view the common areas of the campus (student union building, etc) as well as the pool and strength training facilities. \n8. Make the call. \nIn your senior year you will get the opportunity to choose the school and program you are going to attend and represent. By now you should have a fair indication of which schools are down to bring you on, which are on the lukewarm side, and which have showed no interest (you’ll show ‘em!). \nThe over-riding component of your decision at this point will probably be the financial package that is being offered. Full ride? Partial ride? While finances are crucial, balancing this with the opportunities the coach and swim team bring. A partial ride might be worth it if you get to train with a top tier program, and vice versa if the swimming isn’t that important and the education is priority 1 through 3. \nAt the end of the day, your decision should be rooted on getting a kick-butt education and setting yourself up for the next stage of your life, whatever that may be. One way to consider your decision is to ask yourself, “If something happens to my swimming career where it ends or I retire before I finish school, is this still an institution that I would want to attend?” Ready to Take Your Swimming to the Next Level? \nYourSwimBook is a log book and goal setting guide designed specifically for competitive swimmers. It includes a ten month log book, comprehensive goal setting section, monthly evaluations to be filled out with your coach, and more.",

      "text": "Turn on tldr \nFacebook might have over a billion daily active users. But in an attempt to drive mass adoption of Facebook Live, it has turned to TV, becoming a major advertiser there in the process. \nLast month, the company launched the largest TV-advertising campaign in its history, airing over 20 different commercials more than 1,700 times, and it wasn’t exactly airing them between infomercials: Ads for Facebook Live have run during the 2016 World Series, as well as numerous NFL Sunday and nationally televised college football games. Facebook has spent enough on the spots – an estimated $16.4 million, according to iSpot.tv – to vault itself into the top-70 biggest-spending advertisers on TV over this period. \nThat investment blows past the $14.1 million Facebook spent advertising on digital media through the first half of 2016, according to Kantar data; the total amount of money Facebook’s spent advertising on digital over that period is close to flat year-over-year. Advertisement \n“TV buys are innately accompanied by a sense of comfort and clout,” said Evan Walker, a media supervisor at GSD&M. “There is no doubt that TV brings mass reach and drives awareness.” \nThe TV buy might be an expensive lever, but it’s hardly the only one Facebook has pulled to promote Live. It invested $50 million in yearlong contracts with some 140 celebrities and publishers to produce Facebook Live content, agreements that yielded an exploding watermelon and a man trying to destroy a vase. \nIt also quietly began testing ads that would allow brands and publishers to promote Live content in readers’ news feeds at the moment of the broadcast. \nFacebook is not the only platform to spend money to promote its features on TV – Twitter shelled out for a Moments campaign last year – and it has done product-specific TV ad campaigns before. It has also run numerous brand campaigns on TV, including some heartstring-tuggers produced by agencies including Wieden + Kennedy Portland and Whirled. Its own in-house production agency, The Factory at Facebook, has in the past tapped top-shelf directors including Mike Mills (“Thumbsucker”) for campaigns. \nBut Facebook is investing substantially at a time when Facebook and Instagram, which it also owns, are pushing hard to build audience for its video products. Facebook needs more people to go live not only because growing video consumption is the only way it can increase ad load but also because it continues to feel heat from Snapchat, which was producing upwards of 10 billion video views per day this summer, despite having an audience barely a tenth the size of Facebook’s. \n“Facebook is losing market share within the younger demographic to Snapchat,” said Andrew Gerhart, the COO of mobile video ad exchange AerServ, said of Facebook’s motivation for investing in TV advertising. Facebook’s full-court advertising press, he said, “is the response to the rise in popularity of the same type of video production and consumption on Snapchat, and their desire to have users produce video content and drive more video views.” \nFacebook Live is only a couple months old, and everybody, from its regular users to its top media agencies, is still figuring out how to use it. But after a quick surge of people trying Live out when it debuted in April, growth in the number of Facebook accounts using the Live feature began slowing down this summer, growing 2 percent to 529,000 accounts in June, according to data from Tubular Labs. It’s unclear whether this trend has continued; a spokesperson from Tubular said the company was unable to provide more current data. Related",

      "text": "Home / Internet / Latest Internet News / Facebook sends out invites to June 20 event; plans to launch new product Facebook sends out invites to June 20 event; plans to launch new product Admin 3 hours ago Latest Internet News Facebook sends out invites to June 20 event \nS eems like there’s never a dull moment for the team at Facebook. After a particularly eventful week – during which it introduced hashtag support, started its first servers outside the US and made it okay for post-mastectomy photos to stay , Facebook is reportedly bracing for an out of the blue “June 20 event” at its California headquarters. The social networking giant plans to show off a new product at the event, and sent out invitations to reporters informing them about it. ABCNews received one such invite and has quoted the text in the invite: “A small team has been working on a big idea. Join us for coffee and learn about a new product.” Facebook sends out invites to June 20 event; to launch new product \nABCNews said the invite was concealed in a white envelope. Interestingly, the report says that the invite reached them via mail, quite unlike Facebook’s usual way of sending invites. \nWhile there’s no saying as to what the “new product” could be, Facebook may have hinted of its plans earlier this week. One of the bigger Facebook releases this week has to be the introduction of hashtags. A word or a phrase that starts with a “#” symbol will now become clickable on Facebook, taking you to a page dedicated to it. This page will contain all the posts that people have put up, appended with the hashtag. The other social network, aka Google Plus, too uses hashtags in a similar way and so do Tumblr and Pinterest. Facebook Product Manager Greg Lindley put out a detailed blog post on the occasion, and did not miss saying that Facebook will be rolling out more features “in the coming weeks and months”. \nAll said, June 20 is when the suspense will finally break, and it is only then that we’ll know of Facebook’s plans.

      "text": "If it’s not provocation, it’s useless! — A love letter to satire. As seen on my Facebook newsfeed Maybe I should warn you that this won’t be an objective essay on satire and caricatures. This blogpost won’t be full of well-balanced pro and con arguments supporting both sides of the discourse. I’m sorry, I know we’ve all learned it differently at school. But I am way too much of a fan of satire to stay objective. So this post will rather be my exuberant explanation of why I think satire is incredibly important to our society and why it should be allowed to say everything, yes, everything. Apparently, this is a quite upsetting time to be alive, with wars all over the place, populists regaining power in one country after the other and the (more or less) given risk of terror attacks. To sum it up, there is a lot of horrible and alarming things going on. Although many of these things stage in countries far away, they still have an impact on our lives, one way or the other. With thousands and thousands of refugees fleeing warzones and our economies being connected due to globalisation, it’s also on us to inform ourselves on what is happening and then act responsibly. Now, a major problem that I and many others have faced is that all this information at some point weighs so heavily on our shoulders that we’re just fed up with all this negativity and choose to rather not care. And this is where satire kicks in. The mission of caricaturists is to point out contradictions, identify weak spots in society and politics and hit nerves, again and again  — with wit, sarcasm and humour as their weapons. Satire is constructed of several elements. First of all, there is the obvious joke that catches our attention and is simply fun. We just love being entertained and having a good giggle. Then, however, we need to look beyond the joke and figure out the problem. Wherever there is a joke in satire, there also is a problem. Now, the potential of satire is to break down complex contents concisely and pointedly and to use these shortcuts to shed light on truths. This way it becomes much easier and more pleasant to wrap our head around controversial topics and to care about them. Of course, being provocative and dishing out insults in every direction leads to controversy and, naturally, to people disagreeing with the caricature or satirical text. However, an open society should be capable of a differentiated debate. In the worst case though, people feel so offended by satire, that they physically attack its source, as seen during the terror attacks on Charlie Hebdo in 2006 after having published Mohammed caricatures. The point is that we don’t have to agree with everything said in satire, we don’t have to like it. But we need to understand that satire is crucial to our society because it addresses problems that others are too afraid to address. Caricatures have to be provocative, if not, they are useless! I think that satire is the expression of an enlightened, liberal society and although we might not always like what is being portrayed, we need to accept and defend our right to free speech.",

      "text": "James Gunn is putting his money where his mouth is.\nOn Facebook Thursday, the Guardians of the Galaxy director fielded a question about a much sought-after Easter egg in the 2014 Marvel film, with a fan asking if he plans on ever revealing it. Gunn responded that he had no plans on revealing the Easter egg, which the director first teased two years ago and so far nobody has found.\nThis answer prompted another fan to cry foul: \"He won't reveal it because it doesn't exist. The ultimate troll.\"\nGunn brought out the big guns in his response, vowing to pay the commenter $100,000 if there is no Easter egg.\n\"If there is no Easter egg I will give you a hundred thousand dollars,\" Gunn wrote on Facebook.\nNews of the mystery Easter egg first came to light in November 2014, when Gunn was doing press for the Guardians of the Galaxy Blu-ray.\n\"There's definitely one really big thing that people haven't seen, but they may never see it - we'll see. There's other things, too,\" Gunn told ComicBook.com (which also spotted the $100,000 offer.)\nSome fans have misunderstood what the $100,000 offer entails, thinking Gunn will pay money for people who spot the Easter egg. Gunn has tried to dispell this incorrect interpretation:\nI never offered anyone 100k for the Easter Egg. I told a guy I'd give him 100k if it doesn't exist (which I would, but it does). https://t.co/K37UZCoM1Z\n- James Gunn (@JamesGunn) November 18, 2016\nNO I DID NOT. I said I'd give 100k if there was no Easter Egg (there is). This is gonna haunt me… https://t.co/HEEPnq9pzk\n- James Gunn (@JamesGunn) November 18, 2016\nGunn maintains a close relationship with fans thanks to his active social media accounts, where questions about this Easter egg pop up often (though not as much as requests to know when the Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 trailer will arrive.)\nGuardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 will hit theaters May 5, 2017. Follow Heat Vision on Facebook and Twitter for the latest from the MCU.\nNov. 18, 3:15 p.m. Updated with Gunn's tweets.",

      "text": "November 28, 2016 7:58 AM Facebook's latest foray into China just might work \nBy Adam Minter Order Reprint of this Story \nFacebook's Mark Zuckerberg is willing to try just about anything to get his company back into China. Publicly, he launched a charm offensive that included learning Mandarin and offering Chinese President Xi Jinping the chance to name his first child (he declined). Less publicly, but no less important, the New York Times reports that his company has developed tools to prevent sensitive posts from appearing in Facebook feeds in \"specific geographic areas.\" \nIt's a bold move that underscores just how hard Facebook is hunting for its next billion users. But even if the new tools convinced China's government to lift its ban on Facebook, the country's 700 million internet users have little reason to join. They have plenty of social networks of their own, most of them more advanced and more convenient. As Zuckerberg surely knows, the business case for a move onto the mainland looks dismal. \nSo why is Facebook still so interested? \nHistory would certainly suggest caution. In 2008, when Facebook launched a Chinese-language version, it managed to attract a mere 285,000 mainland members — out of an internet population of more than 225 million. Meanwhile, competing platforms, especially Tencent's QQ, were signing up tens of millions. The next year, Facebook was blocked by the government, obliterating any chance to catch up with China's online entrepreneurs. \nEven worse (for Facebook) was that its Chinese rivals started innovating: Sina Weibo, once derided as a Twitter knock-off, instead became Twitter done better, embedding comment threads and videos long before the San Francisco-based service had contemplated doing the same. \nBut the most revolutionary service was Tencent's WeChat, released in 2011. At first glance, it looked like just another social network and messaging service. Yet it quickly morphed into something much richer, offering a free video-chat system, a taxi-hailing service, a bill-paying portal and a vast shopping environment. Today it's possible to bank on the system and send money to anyone. Invoking \"The Lord of the Rings,\" some users joke that it's the \"one app to rule them all.\" It now has more than 700 million users, including nearly everyone with internet access in China — and another 70 million overseas. \nCompared to WeChat, Facebook is a desert, with little allure to Chinese users. There aren't any public statistics on how many mainlanders use Facebook, but in my experience they're mostly Chinese who have lived or worked in the West, want to maintain friendships overseas, and have access to the technical means to avoid government blockades. For those without such connections, Facebook's only theoretical appeal is that it provides access to news, posts and videos that are otherwise censored. If and when Facebook is reintroduced, those advantages will disappear — and so will the most obvious argument for joining. \nBut Facebook still has one thing going for it, which is surely on Zuckerberg's mind: Technology and social media evolve rapidly in China. \nOnly two years ago, Sina Weibo was China's biggest and most popular social-media platform. Then, after a government crackdown, it lost its political edge and many of its most popular users, and was left for dead. Even as the eulogies were being written, however, Weibo was reinventing itself. It soon became a platform for live-streaming bloggers and celebrity self-promotion, and it boomed once again, boosted by an astonishing 10 million live broadcasts between April and June of this year — a 116-fold increase over the previous quarter. Today, Weibo is approaching 300 million users and its most popular live-streamers get multi-million dollar endorsements. \nIt's too late for Facebook to jump on the live-streaming bandwagon. But Zuckerberg and his colleagues are certainly taking note that a politically neutered site, focused on celebrities and short videos, can command the attention of hundreds of millions of Chinese — and thereby remake a beleaguered, left-for-dead social network. Zuckerberg's charm offensive, in other words, may pay off yet. \n— Minter is based in Asia, where he covers politics, culture, business and junk. \nFor more columns from Bloomberg View, visit http://www.bloomberg.com/view Related content",

      "text": "Going through old pictures of myself on Facebook, I found one of me as a teenager where I’m making a silly pouty face and wearing striking eye make-up — silver eyeshadow and thick inky black eyeliner. Teen Jennifer didn’t have a clue that grown up Jennifer would still find happiness in thick inky black eyeliner (silver eyeshadow, not so much) and all the treats that the make-up world has to offer. That picture reminded me of just how much fun playing around with make-up is.\nPerfecting that cat-eye flick, trying on new blush, swiping on a new shade of lipstick — they make having electricity bills to pay and dirty dishes to wash more bearable.\nBut more than being a guilty pleasure, the make-up world has become a multidimensional and magical place, and one of the more inclusive things to be interested in. That world is now trying to see beyond conventional aesthetics and embrace people of all ages, sizes, skin tones and skin textures, and even gender. Make-up is truly for everyone and there is so much to explore, try out and experiment with.\nWith this column I’m hoping to not only talk about the latest make-up and skincare, but to share my honest experiences with products, talk about the everyday woman’s relationship with beauty and self-image, and just be real about something that is seen an superficial.\nSo catch me every week in Gulf News tabloid! for my take on beauty.",

Follow The Points Guy on Facebook and Twitter , and subscribe to text message alerts from our deals feed, @ tpg_alerts . \nAirfare deals are typically only available on limited dates. We recommend that you use Google Flights to find dates to fly, then book through an online travel agency, such as Orbitz or Expedia , which allows you to cancel flights without penalty by 11pm Eastern Time within one day of booking. However, if you’re using the American Express Platinum Card , you’ll need to book directly with the airline or through Amex Travel portal to get 5x MR points .

Fares are valid for departures from January through May 2017, but availability is somewhat limited.

      "text": "Share on Facebook A lot of films claim to be based on true stories, but how can we be certain? Did anything from David Byrne's 1986 film True Stories actually take place? Why are there people dumb enough to wonder if The Curious Case of Benjamin Button actually happened ? We may not have answers to those questions just yet, we do have some data on other films thanks to the folks at Information Is Beautiful . The online hub has launched a mini site called \"Based on a True True Story?\" where they scrutinize scenes from recent Hollywood films that were advertised as truthful. Readers can click through the movies and discover scenes that are True, True-ish, False-ish or False. Of the films on display, Selma has been determined to be 100 percent true. Similarly, The Big Short is considered 91.4 percent true. On the other side of the scale, American Sniper barely passes the truth test, sitting at 56.9 percent true. The Imitation Game , meanwhile, is an imitation of reality — it's only 41.4 percent true. To check out the (spoiler-filled) breakdowns, head over to Information Is Beautiful here . Thanks to the Guardian for the tip.",

      "text": "Originally postet on Facebook on 14.12.2014 \"►APH-Adventskalender ⑭ - Bayern/Bavaria◄ O Tannenbaum, O Tannenbaum (O Christmas Tree, o christmas tree)~♪♫ Every christmas, people all around the world take part in a tradition they know/got from Germany. Are you interested in knowing why? The story of these special trees is quite fascinating, but probably not the best to tell in a facebook-post xD So, if you wanna know more, I highly recommend to google yourself a bit~ In summary, the use of a decorated tree hasn't got a historically verifiable beginning but originated in customs of different cultures (and I'm talking like Ancient Rome/Middle Ages here). However, the modern Christmas tree originated during the Renaissance of early modern Germany and that's where it spread from. So I'm concentrating on this now. In 1521 the christmas tree was mentioned in an account book of the Humanist Library in Schlettstadt (Just fyi, I guess xD It's old, okay?). By the early 18th century, the custom had become common in towns of the upper Rhineland, but it had not yet spread to rural areas. So, how did the rest of the world found out about it? Easy: Britain! At the time of the personal union with Hanover, George III's German-born wife, Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, introduced a Christmas tree at a party she gave for children in 1800. Queen Victoria as a child was familiar with it and a tree was placed in her room every Christmas. After Victoria's marriage to her German cousin Prince Albert, by 1841 the custom became even more widespread as wealthier middle-class families followed the fashion. And on and on it went. Long story short, you can imagine how the rest happened, right? Like I said, there's much to learn, but I... can't write it all x'D What's important is, that now, people from many, many different countries put up a christmas tree and decorate it. I always thought that this is something incredible and beautiful (Wow, that sounded kinda cheesy xP). Well, whatever.. enjoy your Christbaum~! \" h! I mean- Uh, it's Bavaria. (°- ° )And he's blonde, my gawd. xD Another thing I changed rather quickly after upoloading the picture. I just couldn't resist giving him a smirk like that. Other than that I, of co rse, tried to stay neutral while drawing my beloved home state. (u-u) R ght.. The Christmas tree was a pain in the ass.. orz Hetalia © 日丸屋秀和 / Hidekaz HimaruyaBavaria (based on the \"official design\") & Art © No comments have been added yet. Add a Comment:",

      "text": " Share Share on Facebook + Comments \nGary Kubiak made a call last night that cost his team the game and if it was Mike Tomlin, most people would be asking for his head this morning. He called for a 62 yard field goal instead of a punt the gave KC a very short field to win the game. There are bad coaching decisions and stupid coaching decisions and last night was plain stupid. \nHe was in full view of the cameras making the call and you could see he was totally undecided...if in doubt punt I say.

      "text": "Wes Anderson. Image credit: Tullio M. Puglia/Getty. Like us on Facebook \nThe work of Wes Anderson isn’t hard to identify if you know what to look for: He has a soft spot for smooth tracking shots, festive color palettes, and quality hats. All of this is on display in the short film \"Come Together,\" a new holiday commercial from H&M directed by the iconic filmmaker. \nThe piece stars one of Anderson’s go-to actors, Adrien Brody. Here the star of Darjeeling Limited (2007) finds himself on a train once more, this time as the conductor. After announcing to passengers on the \"H&M Lines Winter Express\" that train delays will interfere with their holiday plans, he invites everyone for hot cocoa in the cafe car. The scene ends with the train’s unaccompanied minor walking into a makeshift winter wonderland as John Lennon’s “Happy Xmas” plays in the background. \nCommercials may seem like a departure for the accomplished auteur, but the H&M project is hardly his first: He’s also directed ads for Hyundai, IKEA, and American Express.

      "text": "Promotion for Smith SJP’s “Anti-Colonial Thanksgiving” event. Photo: Facebook.\nA Thanksgiving gathering to protest the “physical and psychological violence of imperialism and colonialism” in Israel and the US was hosted by a Smith College student group last Sunday, Campus Reform reported.\nAccording to the report, the event — entitled “Anti-Colonial Thanksgiving: Water, Land and Self-Determination from Standing Rock to Palestine” — was organized by the Massachusetts-based school’s Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP) chapter, to mark what it views as similar struggles going on between Palestinians in Gaza with Israel and the Standing Rock Sioux in South Dakota with the US government.\nSmith SJP claimed Israel actively targets Gaza’s water supply — a theory that has been widely debunked , but continues to be pushed by anti-Israel activists — in the same way that the US targets the water supply of the Standing Rock Sioux through the planned construction of an oil pipeline that would traverse the Native American tribe’s land.\nOn the event’s Facebook page , Smith SJP invited attendees to “give thanks to the water protectors in Standing Rock and the Gaza Strip,” as both groups are engaged in “fighting to protect their water tables from the poison of capitalist imperialism.”\nThe featured speaker at the event was Lina Morales , a youth coordinator for the far-Left Jewish Voices for Peace (JVP) Boston, who, her biography notes, has been “active in Palestinian solidarity work since after she took a liberal birthright tour to Israel/Palestine in 1998.” Morales is also listed as a member of the JVP working group promoting the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement.\nSJP, as The Algemeiner has reported , is a national anti-Israel student movement that mobilizes support for BDS and the delegitimization and demonization of Israel. JVP, a Jewish organization, has come under scrutiny for providing SJP what campus watchdog groups and antisemitism experts have called a “cloak of legitimacy” against charges of antisemitism.\nSmith’s “Anti-Colonial Thanksgiving” is not the first holiday that SJP has exploited for anti-Israeli purposes. As The Algemeiner reported , its chapter at the University of Michigan’s held a Halloween bake sale — titled “Zionism is Scary” — which featured cookies and cakes with Palestinian flag icing, and a board filled with out-of-context or distorted Quote: s from Israeli leaders, labeled, “From the Zionist mind.”",

      "text": "Facebook twitter Google November 28, 2016 Entirely new theoretical method for factoring numbers using quantum simulation could lead to a theory of numbers that is based on physical quantum systems Twitter Researchers introduced new concepts and arithmetic functions that could play a significant role in the quantum factorization problem. The Factorization Ensemble is the main one; it allows us to bind the hamiltonian of a quantum factoring simulator. Although the researchers have not yet built a quantum simulator, they show that the prime factors of large numbers would correspond to the energy values of the simulator. Measuring the energy values would then give the solutions to a given factoring problem, suggesting that factoring large numbers into primes may not be as difficult as currently thought. \"The work opens a new avenue to factor numbers, but we do not yet know about its power,\" Rosales told Phys.org. \"It is very striking to find a completely new way to factor that comes directly from quantum physics. It does not demonstrate that factoring numbers is easy, but finding new ways to factor certainly does not add to the strength of algorithms based on its assumed complexity.\" For now, the researchers do not know the technical complexity of building such a device, or whether it would even be possible to factor very large numbers. \"We have shown that a quantum simulator able to factor numbers exists and, in principle, it could be built,\" Martin said. \"Whether the simulator is feasible with current technology in a way that it can factor numbers of the same size as the ones used in cryptography remains to be seen, but the avenue is now open. The prospect of building such a device before a quantum computer is built is something to be pondered seriously.\" Besides the potential for practical applications, the results are also interesting on a more fundamental level. \"In our opinion, the contributions of the paper have two sides: in pure mathematics and in applied cryptography,\" Rosales said. One of the most mathematically interesting aspects of the new work is that it involves redefining the factorization problem by introducing a new arithmetic function that could then be mapped onto the physics of the quantum simulator and correspond to the energy values. In a sense, the researchers are rewriting the math problem in terms of physics. \"The manuscript tries to bridge number theory with quantum physics,\" Rosales said, noting that researchers have been trying to do this for several decades. \"Nowadays with the development of quantum information and computation and the discovery of Shor's algorithm, the connection seems more intriguing and important than ever.\" In the long-term, this type of investigation could ultimately lead to a quantum number theory—a theory of numbers that is based on physical quantum systems. Feynman's prescription for a quantum simulator was to find a hamiltonian for a system that could serve as a computer. P\\'olya and Hilbert conjecture was to demonstrate Riemann's hypothesis through the spectral decomposition of hermitian operators. Here we study the problem of decomposing a number into its prime factors, N=xy, using such a simulator. First, we derive the hamiltonian of the physical system that simulate a new arithmetic function, formulated for the factorization problem, that represents the energy of the computer. This function rests alone on the primes below N−−√. We exactly solve the spectrum of the quantum system without resorting to any external ad-hoc conditions, also showing that it obtains, for x≪N−−√, a prediction of the prime counting function that is almost identical to Riemann's R(x) function. It has no counterpart in analytic number theory and its derivation is a consequence of the quantum theory of the simulator alone. Arxiv - Quantum Simulation of the Factorization Problem To develop a quantum number theory, what we need is a quantum system (at least a theoretical one) to able to reproduce the prime numbers,\" Martin said. \"In the paper, our take was to try to obtain a system able to factorize a number into its primes. The method is 'analogue' in the sense that it is not like Shor's algorithm, which is programmable in a quantum computer following the gate model. Instead, it is the measurement of a carefully set quantum system that provides the answer. \"To carry out this program, we need to first devise an arithmetic formulation of the factorization problem that is amenable to be quantized. We have to find an arithmetic function, eventually related to a Hamiltonian, and set up the quantum-mechanical problem such that its solution corresponds to the solution of the factorization problem. In the work we succeeded in carrying out these ideas. We found the correct arithmetic function, defined the factorization set to bind the Hamiltonian and obtained the solution of the quantum-mechanical problem. To the best of our knowledge, this has not been achieved before, although ours was not the first attempt. \"As it is always done in physics, to validate the results, we have to prove its predictive capabilities, so we did predictions with them: obtained a factorization algorithm that is completely new, with no similitude to any other factorization algorithm that we know of, and thoroughly checked the statistics of the solution against the prime number theorem. \"The results left us really astounded. To demonstrate this, in the paper we show how the spectrum reproduces the prime counting function and is almost identical to the Riemann's. This is obtained as a direct consequence of the quantum mechanical theory and has no counterpart in number theory. Carrying this to the extreme, this could be even considered the physics underlying the Riemann hypothesis [one of the most important open problems in number theory] in the sense that the Hamiltonian is naturally bounded, without any further assumptions.\" The researchers explain that, in this paper, they just hinted that the results have deeper mathematical implications, and they plan to further investigate these possibilities in the future. They are also looking into what it would take to build a quantum simulator. Read more at: http://phys.org/news/2016-11-quantum-physics-factor.html#jCp Author:",

Sgt. Kerry Schmidt says police got a call late Saturday night about a vehicle that was \"all over the road\" on Highway 400 in Vaughan, Ont. Schmidt says officers caught up with the vehicle as it left the northbound highway to head southbound, and when they did pull it over the driver took off. After more officers arrived, Schmidt says they were able to bring the car — which accelerated to more than 120 km/h at one point — to a stop without a collision. When officers got the driver out of the vehicle Schmidt says he was \"shockingly, an 11-year-old kid.\" Schmidt says the boy had been playing the \"Grand Theft Auto\" video game at home and \"wanted to see what it was like to drive a car.\" \"Here we have an influence of a video game making kids try things without their parents' knowledge or consent,\" Schmidt said Sunday. \"An absolute tragedy waiting to happen.\" ",

      "text": "Facebook \nA 26-year-old lady has revealed what she went through after trying to find greener pasture in Libya. \nIn a long but absolutely shocking story, the National Diploma certificate holder revealed how she was sweet-tongued into believing the streets of Tripoli was “flowing with milk and honey’’, how they were all forced into extreme prostitution, and many more in her two-year sojourn there. Sad black woman \nRead the mindblowing true life account below: \nMiss Peju Akins (pseudonym) was offered a poisoned chalice in a Lagos church in January, 2015; she embraced it hook, line and sinker! \nA lady she met during Sunday service painted the rosy picture of Libya, with the streets of Tripoli “flowing with milk and honey’’, and the promise that after making money in the North African country, she would easily migrate to Europe. \n“I’m lucky to be back in Nigeria alive; many died during the one-month trip through the desert, especially between Agadez in Niger Republic and the Libyan capital, Tripoli. My ‘burger’ (trafficker) succeeded in convincing another lady to make the trip with us from Lagos. We were seeking better life, but it was a regrettable trip and a waste of almost two years of my life.’’ \nPeju, 26, holds a National Diploma in business administration from a polytechnic in Nigeria’s South-West. She says the first leg of the ill-fated trip, from Lagos to Kano, was fun. Then the next call between Kano and Agadez in Niger Republic, a distance of 715 kilometres, was stressful as they had no travelling documents. \n“Border officials exploited us; checkpoints mounted by Nigerien gendarmes did the same. But, the horror started in Agadez. Any semblance of a road network ended at Agadez; all I could see was endless sand dunes like I have seen water at the ocean shore in Lagos. The heat and the dust were horrible. \nREAD ALSO: How I was forced to make love with dogs and horses – 24-yr-old lady \n“In addition, we were considered as mere merchandise over which people haggled for prices that could favour them. We spent five days in Agadez because the trip through the desert starts from there only on Mondays. In Agadez, our group met hundreds of black people from across the ECOWAS sub-region, assembled for the suicidal desert trip to Libya.’’ \nAccording to Peju, only four-wheel-drive, double-cabin pick-up vans are being used for the desert trip, with each taking between 20 and 30 migrants. She says they were loaded in the cargo cabin of each pick-up van, with most of their bodies hanging out of the van, each hapless traveller holding on to a stick tied to a rope in the cabin, to stop them from falling off during the bumpy ride. \n“Between Agadez and Qatroun, (in Niger Republic) and Sabha in the middle of Libya, we were kidnapped many times by militia groups that raped some of the ladies. There was so much shooting, though nobody in my vehicle was hit. We were told of rotting corpses littering some areas of the desert, but our driver must have avoided such spots so as not to further scare us. Each kidnapping meant being locked up in ‘prison’ until ransom was paid. My human trafficker saw to the negotiations.’’ \nPeju finally got to Tripoli, after covering about 3,500 kilometres of road, mostly uncharted desert. \n“I thought my nightmare was over when we got to Tripoli; little did I know it had just begun. I and my fellow church member were allowed to scrub off the smell and dirt of the desert in a bathroom, and a change of dress, before being driven to a large compound they call ‘connection house’. The ‘connection house’ is the alias for a brothel. Without much hesitation, two elderly ladies, a Yoruba and an Ibo from Nigeria, casually asked if we would like to start with ‘one-round’, ‘short time’ or ‘all-night’ patrons’’. \nPAY ATTENTION: Get all the latest gossips on NAIJ Gossip App \nShe says she later understood that ‘one-round’ means having sex with a man once for the equivalent of N1,000 in Libya dinar, ‘short-time’ means three hours of sex for N3,000 equivalent, while ‘all-night’ means copulation from dusk to dawn for N6,000. \n“We both protested that we would not do ‘asewo’ (commercial sex work) and that our ‘burger’ (trafficker) only promised to get us housemaid jobs. The next five days was hell as the two of us were locked up in a room, without food and water, and constantly beaten up. \n“Close to death on the fifth day, they called in a nurse to clean us up, feed us and allow us to change clothes. Then they told us we had to contact our families in Nigeria to wire N500,000 each to them or we would be drugged and forced into prostitution.’’ \nPeju says they were then allowed to have a mobile phone and alerted families back home in Nigeria of their predicament. \n“The Yoruba woman spoke with my father in Lagos and in tears, he promised to send the money within a week. My father begged them not to harm or force me into prostitution. My co-traveller was the first to control (wire) money from Nigeria. My daddy finally sent my ransom — which he borrowed here and there. \n“The matron then converted me to her salesgirl. I was in charge of selling brandy and whisky, condoms, diapers, creams and other materials the ‘asewos’ needed for their carnal jobs. Yes, there are no babies in need of diapers, but the absorbent in them were being removed, creamed and forced down the private parts of the commercial sex workers to protect their womb (cervix) from being ruptured by their clients.’’ \nPeju says the absorbents were usually ‘popped’ out by the girls after sex, washed and creamed for reuse. She says this is because the men coming to sleep with them usually take sex enhancers that prolong the act and often bruise the girls to the extent that they bleed from their private parts. \n“The men who come to the brothel use cocaine, ‘tramadol’, hashish (the Arab equivalent of marijuana), and many other illicit drugs, so that they can punish the girls who stay four in a room, separated by mere curtains. I spent five months in the brothel, but not into prostitution. I was sleeping on a bare floor all the while, disturbed by the groaning and crying of the sex workers. \n“One night, a girl was screaming — more than usual — and the matrons have to burst into her bed-space. An over-drugged man was stuck to her like dogs in mating! He had to be physically ‘removed’ from the girl and his money refunded! Another girl ran mad and was defecating everywhere and putting the mess in her mouth. Her legs and face were swollen; she was always murmuring. She later died and was secretly taken to the desert for burial in an unmarked shallow grave. Her death was not even relayed to her family in Nigeria.’’ \nPeju left her vendor’s job at the brothel to become a khaddamah (a maid) and she was paid the equivalent of N60,000 a month by a kind Arab family. \n“But my main problem was the language barrier. Even though I could then understand and speak a few Arabic words, I was making mistakes when sent on errand within the house. I was with the family for about six months as maid; I saved most of my salary. \n“I then became a seller of African (mostly Nigerian) foodstuffs, such as beans, gari, seasoning cubes, etc, being ferried across the desert by Nigerian businessmen from Kano. I was sharing an apartment with a Nigerian family.’’ \nREAD ALSO: SAD! Nigerians return from Libya with gunshot wounds \nHowever, she finally reconsidered her stay in Libya when her apartment was raided one night by gun-toting Libyan officials and all the residents locked up in jail for being illegal immigrants. \n“The raid happened when I had started making money; I was free and I even had a Yoruba boyfriend, an engineer, who was always going to Malta (Europe) by boat to fix doors, POP ceilings and other building materials. We were put in jail and after some days, asked to pay the equivalent of N100,000 each to secure our freedom. I’ve had enough; so, refused to pay and told them I wanted to go back to Nigeria. From then on, they never allowed me to get back to my apartment and properties.’’ \nPeju says the Libyan immigration allowed her to purchase temporary travelling documents and escorted her to the airport to board a plane for Niamey in Niger Republic. \n“All the money my friends were able to raise while I was in jail was spent on travelling documents and the one-way flight to Niamey. I spent two days at the motor park in Niamey before I met a kind Nigerian man who gave me 25,000 francs (CFA) with which I came back to Lagos. The jogging trouser and blouse I wore to bed the night I was arrested were all the possession I came back with in mid-November 2016. Giant mosquitoes feasted on me so much in Libyan prison that I was pockmarked as if I had measles.’’ \nPeju never contemplated being smuggled across the Mediterranean Ocean to Europe again because her eyes had opened to the mass death suffered by those who dared. \n“I am appealing to Nigerian youngsters to dissuade their minds from planning to get to Europe through Libya, especially taking the desert routes. Yes, there is more money in Libya than Nigeria for hustlers, so is death in the desert or in the Mediterranean Sea. Besides, the suffering the girls go through in the brothels is worse than death.’’ \nUnlike migrants’ drowning in the Mediterranean that is often documented by European navies and coastguards, death through shooting, starvation and dehydration in the vast desert is largely unaccounted for. Only a small fraction of those who dare will make it to Europe. \n– Dele Bodunde/News Agency of Nigeria",

Follow The Points Guy on Facebook and Twitter , and subscribe to text message alerts from our deals feed, @ tpg_alerts . \nAirfare deals are typically only available on limited dates.

      "text": "Share on Facebook \nCo-authored by Allison Cazalet \nHas the topic of personalization come up within your organization recently? Chances are that personalization not only comes up, it’s also a foremost priority: 68% of the firms we surveyed in our Q1 2016 Digital Experience Delivery Online Survey said personalization was one of the most important initiatives for their business today. Why? Because personalization is one of the best ways to contextually engage with customers across a variety of touch points. But many organizations we speak with today struggle to get initiatives off the ground and struggle to prove the business value of personalization. \nTo help organizations get started on their personalization program, my colleague Ted Schadler and I researched how best-in-class organizations today have operationalized personalization. The most successful firms we spoke with created a four-pronged personalization program that Forrester calls POST: P eople – Before doing anything else, successful firms ask and answer this question: Which customers am I trying to reach and serve? In order to implement a successful personalization program, you will need to do the same by researching your customers in their context so that you know which ones to prioritize. O bjectives – The next step to a successful personalization program is to make sure you and your personalization team have an in depth understanding of what you are trying to accomplish. You must keep this simple. Determine what business outcome you are optimizing, the experiences you will personalize, and what data you need to make it all happen. S trategy – At this point, you need to know how you are going to meet your objectives. Without a well thought out plan, your personalization program is in jeopardy. You’ll need to figure out who is going to do what, how much money you have to spend, and how to get cross-business stakeholders involved. T echnology – Identifying the technology you will need to set you up for success will be your final step. A multi-channel approach that encompasses commerce, content, presentation/delivery, and analytics is critical in selecting technology solutions for personalization. \nOur recent report, Create A Pragmatic Personalization Program , expands on how to use our four pronged approach to achieve personalization success. We provide tips and real life examples of how companies have successfully gotten up and running with a personalization program. We also encourage Forrester customers to do an inquiry if they have any lingering questions after reading the report.",

      "text": "Share on Facebook \nThe next generation of great space telescopes is heading into its final round of ground tests. The nearly $9 billion James Webb Space Telescope will replace the aging Hubble Space Telescope . It's designed to provide unprecedented images of the earliest stars and galaxies that formed in the universe. \nBut before the telescope can get to work, there are still a lot of engineering challenges to overcome. \nFor example, the Webb telescope is designed to look at the infrared wavelengths of light given off by stars. Infrared is needed to see some of the earliest stars and galaxies that formed billions of years ago. \nBut to work properly, infrared telescopes have to be kept cold — very cold. So engineers had to design a multilayered sun shield to protect the telescope from the sun's heat. \n\"That's like a big umbrella — beach umbrella — so, we keep that facing the sun and the Earth so it dissipates all the heat through all the layers,\" says Begoña Vila , an astrophysicist and systems engineer at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, in Greenbelt, Md. \"That allows all the instruments to cool to the temperatures that we need.\" \nNow, the sun shield is big, about the size of a tennis court, and for launch it has to fit into a much smaller space — about the size of a school bus. So engineers had to come up with a way to fold it up. They also had to design a way to fold up the main mirror, and several other critical instruments. An artist's rendering of the James Webb Space Telescope. The telescope's silver, umbrella-shape heat shield will be the size of a tennis court, engineers say. It's crucial to keep cool the instruments that detect infrared light from distant stars. Northrop Grumman/NASA \nThen, after launch, everything has to unfold in a carefully choreographed sequence of steps over two weeks. You can see that sequence in this video . \nMany of the steps are absolutely crucial. A failure would compromise the telescope's functionality and could render it useless. For the army of scientists and engineers who have been working on the telescope for nearly two decades, the deployment phase will be nerve-wracking. \n\"Yes, I think that scares all of us,\" says Vila. But there's no way around it. \"We do as much testing as we can.\" \nThe Webb telescope has had a difficult history. It is over budget and behind schedule, and Congress nearly killed the project earlier in the decade. The telescope is scheduled to launch in October 2018. We should know later that year whether the engineering challenges were successfully cleared. Copyright 2016 NPR. To see more, visit http://www.npr.org/. \n ",

      "text": "Over the long weekend, one nightmare traveler — documented by Emma Baum on Facebook — sparked calls for a Delta airlines boycott. The man celebrated Thanksgiving with an unhinged rant that included clapping and whooping to celebrate Donald Trump’s win: “We got some Hillary bitches on here. Come on, baby. Trump! He’s your president, every goddamn one of you. If you don’t like it, too bad.” This shall be his last Delta-bound rant.\nAfter much social media ruckus, Delta was quick to issue an apology and an acknowledgement that this was not ideal behavior and shouldn’t have happened on one of its planes. Now, Delta CEO Ed Bastian has effectively banned (for life!) the “disruptive passenger on DL248.” In a memo to staff, Bastian thanks staffers for serving customers through the hectic and stressful holiday weekend and says he supports his staff through “heightened tension in our society.” However, he does make clear that this behavior won’t be tolerated by staff who witness it :\n“This individual displayed behavior that was loud, rude and disrespectful to his fellow customers. After questioning the customer, our team members made the best decision they could given the information they had and allowed him to remain on the flight. However, if our colleagues had witnessed firsthand what was shown in the video, there is no question they would have removed him from the aircraft. He will never again be allowed on a Delta plane.”\nDelta can’t be thrilled with fallout from this passenger’s rant, especially after they came under fire this summer for booting a Muslim couple (the man was “sweating,” and the woman was wearing a headscarf) when a crew member felt “uneasy” after overhearing the word “Allah.” However, at least the airline chose to ban the unruly, ranting man for life. No word on whether the man continued his ranting over Thanksgiving dinner. Probably so.\n(Via Delta & Washington Post )\n",

      "title": "Morally Decent Trump Supporters",
      "text": "MORE Source: Gage Skidmore, CCL \nI did not vote for Donald Trump. As my Facebook friends, friends IRL, and others can attest, I was strongly opposed to his candidacy and did not want him to become President of the United States. I don't have a particular political perspective that underlies my opposition to Trump. I have been a Democrat, Republican, and Independent since I first registered to vote back in the 1980s. I’ve voted for members of both major parties in a variety of elections. \nI am a Christian, and offered some arguments against Trump from that perspective. I’m also a moral philosopher, and offered an argument against Trump from a more general ethical point of view . I am very concerned about the influence that some members of the “Alt-Right” appear to have in his administration. And I believe some (I have no idea how many) of Trump’s supporters are racist and support him for reasons related to these views. I have no interest in defending Trump, his policies, or these kinds of supporters. \nHowever, many Trump supporters are not racist, they are not sexist, they are not homophobic, they are not nationalists. They have genuine moral concerns that led them to vote for Donald Trump. They are morally decent people who care about their country, their communities, and their families. I think they were deeply mistaken in voting for Trump. And I don’t agree with all of the perspectives I’m about to describe. But as I teach my students, one crucial ability that we need to develop is being able to stand in the shoes of others and try to see things from their perspective, without demonizing them. \nHere is a glimpse into some of these perspectives to consider: The small business owner who can’t afford health care for himself, and who believes that his business may not survive due to the costs and regulations related to Obamacare. The nurse who thinks the motivation behind Obamacare is good, but who also sees how the regulations and costs associated with it are harmful to many. The teacher who is deeply convinced that abortion is immoral, because she believes that the the unborn are human persons who have the right to life. She cannot imagine voting for a pro-choice candidate. The small business owner who, for reasons of her conscience , does not want to be forced to bake a wedding cake for a gay couple, because she thinks it will make her complicit in this. In addition, because of her faith and views about the dignity of all human beings, she would give her life if required to save the lives of that couple. The ex-Marine (if anyone is really ever an “ex”-Marine), who believes that we are making a grave mistake with some of our policies related to terrorism, and thinks Trump will make us more secure. The many who are tired of being painted as bigots by the media and many on the left because they are concerned about terrorism and national security, believe in a traditional sexual ethic, don’t think that welfare should be abused in the ways that it is, and so on. Poor white males who have little to no economic prospects, who are told by parts of the media and others that society is structured to their advantage. They wonder how this can be so, when they have little to no hope of escaping poverty. \nRegardless of our political perspectives, we need to find as much common ground as possible, and fight together for the common good of both the United States and the rest of the globe. An important first step in this direction is to try to see things from perspectives that differ from our own, rather than lumping all of those who disagree with us into a large category by which we can easily dismiss them and their beliefs. \nI don’t believe that Donald Trump is the answer to what ails us, but neither do I believe that the way forward is to demonize all of his supporters. We can do better, and we ought to do better. There will be some bitter political fights in the next 4 years, but if we can identify first as Americans, with a shared belief in life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness for all of us , we have a better chance of moving ahead in at least some positive directions.",

USATODAY.com: http://usat.ly/2gaWeDB   Join the Nation's Conversation To find out more about Facebook commenting please read the Conversation Guidelines and FAQs FTW: What makes Winston the NFL's best young QB Steven Ruiz , USATODAY 10:08 a.m. EST November 28, 2016 170 Shares \n(Photo: Aaron Doster-USA TODAY Sports) \nNFL Media analyst and former pro scout Daniel Jeremiah ran a Twitter poll last week asking voters to pick the young quarterback they would choose to build a team around. The choices were Dak Prescott, Marcus Mariota, Carson Wentz and Jameis Winston. \nIt wasn't much of a surprise that Prescott finished first. He's put up the best numbers, and the Cowboys have one of the bigger fan bases in the NFL. It was surprising, however, that Winston, the most hyped quarterback prospect since Andrew Luck, finished in last place with only 12% of the vote. Our poll question of the day-- Which QB would you choose to build your team around? — Daniel Jeremiah (@MoveTheSticks) November 21, 2016 \nWinston should have finished at the top of that list. Not only has he shown off a skillset more refined than Mariota, Prescott and Wentz have, but he's also the youngest of the four - by a full year. Because Winston has been in the spotlight for so long, it's easy to forget that he's only 22. He should be a senior in college. Instead, he's carrying an undermanned team to a winning record and doing so in an offense built for a veteran quarterback. \nWinston's raw numbers are not overly impressive. His quarterback rating is sitting just below the league average. His completion percentage is sitting just over 60%. And only three quarterbacks have thrown more interceptions. \nBut evaluating quarterbacks from a purely statistical standpoint is a flawed practice. There are just too many factors outside the control of the quarterback himself contributing to those numbers. A passer's statline is not just a reflection of the player - it's a reflection of the pass protection, the play-calling and the receivers catching the passes. \nWinston has always been a playmaker, but the knocks against him have been his low completion percentage and high turnover numbers. In order to properly interpret those numbers, you have to take into account what the Buccaneers are asking him to do. \nIn short, Tampa is asking a lot of its young quarterback, in terms of both volume and degree of difficulty. Winston has attempted near 200 more passes than Mariota has through two seasons. Coming into the weekend, he led the league in average pass length, according to the NFL's in-house stat keeping. At the same time, only Luck has been pressured on a higher percentage of dropbacks than Winston, per Football Outsiders. \nQuick recap: Winston is being asked to carry the Bucs offense on his back and make the toughest throws in the NFL with some of the worst pass protection you will find in the league. \nConsidering all that, it's remarkable that Winston is anywhere close to producing a league-average statline. And that's not even taking into account how young he is. Only one quarterback who has started multiple games this season is younger than Winston: Jared Goff. \nIf you watch Winston play, it's shocking that he is so advanced given his age. Quarterbacks that young are not supposed to be this poised in the pocket. \nHe has an innate ability to feel pressure and has the spatial awareness to avoid it and navigate the pocket while keeping his eyes downfield. This is the kind of pocket play you expect from guys like Tom Brady, Philip Rivers and Drew Brees, not some 22-year-old kid who was just thrown in the deep end and expected to swim from the start of his career. \nThat presence in the pocket is a big reason why Winston has taken fewer sacks and performed better than Mariota despite facing more pressure, according to ESPN.com : \nDespite being pressured at a much higher rate, Winston has been sacked at a far lower rate than Mariota, 4.9 percent to 6.9 percent. When under pressure, Winston completes a higher percentage of passes than Mariota, and he has thrown an interception on 1.6 percent of his attempts, compared with 3.7 percent for Mariota. Winston's Total QBR when under pressure is 64.6 for his career, the highest among qualified quarterbacks in that span. Mariota is at 16.5, which ranks 28th. \nAnother reason is Winston's ability to anticipate his receivers coming open. First- and second-year passers typically need to see a receiver get open before releasing a pass. Not Winston. His ability to read coverages allows him to to get rid of the ball before the receiver even gets into his break. \nOn the play above, Winston subtly steps to the side as a free rusher approaches and starts his throwing motion before Cameron Brate turns around. That's a sack for about 90% of Winston's peers. He avoids it by knowing the coverage and knowing how to beat it within a matter of seconds. \nWinston's youth does show up a handful of times per game. He'll make at least one mind-boggling decision per game. He'll also miss some throws due to wonky footwork. But you live with these mistakes because (a) he's a young quarterback doing things some veterans haven't figured out and (b) these are the kinds of issues that hard-working quarterbacks clean up with more experience. Winston is still about five years away from hitting his prime. If he's still throwing inexplicable interceptions and sailing throws in in two season, then those are legitimate concerns. Until then, it's just nitpicking. \n(Winston's turnover problems are overblown, anyway. The 22-year-old has combined for 39 interceptions and fumbles in 27 career games, or 1.44 per game. Mariota - who plays a more conservative brand of football - has combined for 35 in 24 career games, or 1.45 per game. If Winston has a problem protecting the football, then so does Mariota.) \nIn addition to all of his talent Winston's leadership ability, which doesn't matter unless you can play (sorry, Tebow), are beyond rare. The dude was born to be a quarterback. Jameis really is the greatest of all time. pic.twitter.com/7CAawPHp8F — Henry (@seminole4life22) November 21, 2016 \nThe Buccaneers have no running game. Outside of Mike Evans, you can't name another receiver on the active roster. The defense is giving up 24 points a game. Despite all that, Winston has led the Buccaneers to a 6-5 record and has pulled them within a half-game of the final Wild Card spot in the NFC after upsetting the Seahawks on Sunday. What else would you expect from the best young quarterback in the league? Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2gaWeDB Most Popular",

      "text": "Facebook twitter Google   approves $36 billion of subways and other links to reduce commutes over an area twice the size of South Korea from several hours to mostly 60 minutes or less China has approved a 247-billion-yuan ($36-billion) railway plan to improve transport links between the capital Beijing, the port city of Tianjin, and the neighboring province of Hebei, part of plans to integrate the three areas into a mega-city. The plan will span nine projects that total 1,100 km (683 miles) in length, the country's powerful economic planner, the National Development and Reform Commission, said in an online statement on Monday. The projects will be built over the years to 2020, and are part of a wider plan that will stretch to 2030, it added. The current population of the three areas is estimated at around 110 million, and by the time the plan is complete, the so-called Jing-Jin-Ji project will span 212,000 sq km (82,000 sq miles), or more than twice the size of South Korea. The expanding railway networks have cut commute time in the region significantly, said Steven McCord, research head at real estate service firm Jones Lang LaSalle (JLL). \"It was not possible to go all the way from Beijing to Binghai and that's a one-hour trip now. It's now also possible to go between Tianjin and Tangshan in less than 30 minutes, which was previously several hours' drive,\" he said. SOURCES- Reuters",

      "text": "It's been a long 47 years for Jets fans. Robert Melofchik, Facebook Photo: \nIn a year where the Chicago Cubs ended their ‘Curse of the Billy Goat,’ the New York Jets are no closer to the cessation of their own personal journey through the wilderness. In fact, they may be further away from the Super Bowl then at any time in the past decade. \nThe argument could be made that it is even worse than that and that the team is as rudderless as it has ever been. \nAll of which brought several dozen Jets fans together at the now infamous Lot L7 tailgate on Sunday. The fans chose to “exorcise” the demons of their own past prior to a heart-wrenching home loss to the New England Patriots. And the exorcism had a very New England flavor to it. \nThis is a New England franchise, after all, that had been through its own personal hell prior for much of its existence to the 2000 season. And their recent fortunes have come at the expense of the Jets, who saw a Hall of Fame head coach slip through their fingers in embarrassing fashion. \nThe fans chose to burn a mocked-up version of the note that Patriots head coach Bill Belichick scrawled on a napkin prior to a press conference where he was supposed to be announced as the next head coach of the Jets in 2000. Instead, Belichick went on to win four Super Bowls with the Patriots and has his team headed for yet another AFC East title. He cited his lack of comfort with the direction of the Jets as his reason to resign. \nThe other item offered up as a sacrifice to the football gods was a photo of Mo Lewis, the former Jets linebacker, who infamously injured former Patriots quarterback Drew Bledsoe. The hit ushered in the Tom Brady era and now Brady and Belichick are arguably the best quarterback-head coach duo in NFL history. \nAt the tailgate, the fans dropped the mock resignation note from Belichick and a photo of the Bledsoe hit into a bucket. The contents of the bucket were then ignited and the fans did a ceremonial drink. \nOn Sunday, Brady got career win No. 200, tied for most all-time. The Jets sunk to 8-8, ensuring that they won’t have a winning record for the fifth time since they went 11-5 in the 2010 season. It is also the last time that the Jets have made the playoffs, something they’ve done just six times since 2000. \nThe Patriots have made the playoffs 13 times since hiring Belichick and are primed for another appearance this season, likely as the top seed in the AFC.",

Post to Facebook Dwight Howard restrained in argument with Lakers fan Lakers fans are still angry.  //usat.ly/2gBbhn6   Dwight Howard restrained in argument with Lakers fan Andrew Joseph 3:49 p.m. EST November 28, 2016 1 Shares \nSunday night was far from Dwight Howard's first game against the Lakers since that dramatic 2012-13 season in Los Angeles, but it doesn't appear that time has healed any wounds for Lakers fans. \nAfter three seasons in Houston, Howard played his first game in Los Angeles as a member of the Atlanta Hawks. Just as he was with the Rockets, Howard was met with hostility Sunday night at Staples Center. \nAt one point, Howard had to be restrained while confronting a heckling fan who had cursed at him. \nThe Hawks lost 109-92 to the Lakers, and after the game, Howard was asked about the reception in Los Angeles. TMZ's video of the altercation wasn't released until the following day. \nHoward told the Los Angeles Times that he didn't hear the boos. \n\"I closed my ears,\" he said. \nThe heckling started early in the night for Howard, as a request for a Snapchat shoutout turned into a fan repeatedly screaming \"Kobe\" at Howard. \nHe was booed each time his name was announced. \nHoward finished the game with 19 points and 9 rebounds.

Use AdviceIQ's steps to overcome your apprehension and effectively negotiate your salary. (Photo: BakiBG, Getty Images/iStockphoto) \nIt's the end of the year, time for holidays, gifts, parties — and annual reviews. \nWhile not the highlight of the season, they are a reality: The Society for Human Resource Management finds that nearly three-quarters of organizations conduct annual performance appraisals. Another 16 percent perform them semi-annually and only 3 percent of organizations reported that they did not conduct formal reviews. \nThese reviews can directly impact your financial well-being, as they're often the basis for raises or bonuses. Here are a few tips for making the most of the process: \nPREPARE \nIt's critical to prepare, and ideally you've been keeping track of your accomplishments all year. An easy way to do this is to keep a file of key successes as the year goes on. Make a note each time you meet a key sales goal, receive an email with kudos from a client or earn congratulations from your boss on a project. That way you'll have all the information in one place when it comes time to prepare. \n\"It's easier to not have to wrack your brain,\" said Rick Gibbs, a performance specialist at human resources company Insperity. \"And often it's an uplifting experience because you forget about some things you did. If you forgot about them, your supervisor likely forgot them too.\" \nReacquaint yourself with how the performance appraisal is conducted to equip yourself with the information you might need. \nTHINK BIG \nThink about the big picture. Review your job description to remind yourself where you fit into the company's structure. And look over the company's larger goals such as its mission, how it makes money and its priorities for the year to get a good handle on what you are doing to help meet those objectives. \nACT OBJECTIVELY \nIt can be tough to get feedback, good or bad, says Gibbs. It puts you in the spotlight and that makes many people uncomfortable. But try to remain calm and cool throughout the process. \nIf you are on the receiving end of bad news, try not to take it too personally or make it confrontational. Ask for more information to understand the situation and if appropriate, counter with your own supporting evidence. \nPLAN AHEAD \nOften a portion of the performance review is forward looking, where an employee and manager can discuss future goals. Don't miss out on this chance to help shape your future. \n\"This is a prime opportunity for the employee to share ideas, show initiative and value to the manager,\" Gibbs said. \"We don't get many of these opportunities.\" CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE",

      "text": "Share on Facebook Canadian singer-songwriter Danny Michel recently gave us the ins and outs of recording his latest album in the Canadian Arctic aboard a Russian icebreaker , and now more details on his latest effort have surfaced. Titled Khlebnikov , the album will arrive in late January. Running 10 tracks in length, the album was recorded aboard the Russian vessel (named Kapitan Khlebnikov ) as part of Canadian astronaut Col. Chris Hadfield's Generator Arctic expedition, which saw scientists, photographers, writers, videographers and musicians travel the Arctic Ocean and capture their experience to share with the rest of the world through their respective disciplines. As far as Michel's recording process went, he created the record in a makeshift studio aboard the ship built from camera tripods, hair ties and gaffing tape. Col. Hadfield features on the LP singing in Russian, while Michel also incorporated found sound through recording the ship kitchen's dishwasher. Along with the announcement, Michel has shared album cut \"24,000 Horses,\" which was inspired by a beautiful moment in nature that took place in the early hours of the morning. \"One evening at 4 a.m. I woke to massive muffled booms and thuds of the Khlebnikov lurching through the Arctic ice,\" Michel recalled in a statement. \"Too curious to sleep I put on all of my gear and went outside to see what was happening. There alone, at the bow I witnessed one of the most glorious moments of my life. Under an endless sky and midnight sun, I watched pieces of ice the size of tennis courts break, flip, and bounce around like bowling pins under the hull of the mighty Khlebnikov . Later that day I wrote '24,000 Horses'\" ​Khlebnikov arrives on January 20, but listeners in Western Canada will have a chance to take in songs from Michel's new LP on a short run of dates next month. You can find those, along with the tracklisting and lyric video for \"24,000 Horses,\" below. Khlebnikov :",

      "text": "Like us on Facebook \nby James Hunt \nWhen it's hot outside, few things are more inviting than a tall glass of ice-cold water—unless you're my grandmother, who swore that the best way to cool down on a hot day was to drink a piping hot cup of tea. \nYou've probably heard other people say the same thing, but is it just an old wives' tale, or is there any truth in it? If you're trying to stay cool, should you reach for the fridge or the kettle? \nCommon sense suggests that ice water would be the better option. Getting a near-freezing cold beverage into your body should lower your core temperature and offer temporary respite from the blazing heat around you. That's just physics: cold water naturally draws heat from the warmer body tissue around it. \nAlthough some people suggest that the body responds to a cold stimulus by trying to heat up, there's no real evidence for any real effect from that. \nBut the evidence for drinking hot beverages to cool down isn’t straightforward either, suggests research from the University of Ottawa . At least one study found that drinking even a small hot drink triggered a disproportionately high sweat response without significantly raising your core temperature. And since sweating cools you down, that means a hot drink is actually better at cooling you down than a cold one. \nOf course, there are some catches. One is that you won't feel the effects until your sweat has evaporated fully, contrasting with the instant effect of an ice water hit. The other, much bigger one is that it only works under certain conditions. If it's humid, if you're sweating a lot already, or if you're wearing clothes that trap moisture on you then there's bad news: drinking a hot drink is only going to make you hotter. \nThe ultimate explanation for this phenomenon was provided by Peter McNaughton, a professor of pharmacology at King's College London. His research revealed that the TRPV1 heat receptors in your tongue and throat react to heat stimuli by causing you to sweat, regardless of your core temperature. These heat sensors are actually the same reason you break out in a sweat when you eat spicy foods. \nSo while it seems counterintuitive, having a hot drink on a hot day actually can cool you down. Turns out my grandmother knew better than all of us. Let's raise a steaming mug of tea to her memory. \nHave you got a Big Question you'd like us to answer? If so, let us know by emailing us at .  ",

      "text": "(Before It's News) Most people who use social media have figured out that Facebook and Google are in cahoots with the government, for those who are well aware of the issues it’s high time you switched over to Seen.life . It is a website that is similar to Facebook but without all the censorship. PREPARED NOW FOR A COLLAPSE OF EPIC PROPORTION\nON FUTURE FOR THE WORLD ECONOMIC COLLAPSE CONFIRMED! – PREPPARED NOW FOR A COLLAPSE OF EPIC PROPORTION. This is a tough topic, because people either don’t won’t to believe it or are not capable because they lack the knowledge to comprehend what is being said. When you understand that our country can only operate based on debt/credit, not physical dollars, you finally see that the USA is a huge Ponzi scheme built on nothing more that our ability to borrow money. Our status as the world reserve currency has allowed us to borrow money that we do not have.\nThe government says that there are 10 trillion dollars sitting in the US Banking system that we can go and easily withdrawal. How can that be true when there only exists 1.4 trillion of real money in circulation (dollars and coins) and more than one half of that is outside the US.\nThis doesn’t include the 10s of trillions more that we owe other countries that have purchased our debt. If our creditors were to all come and ask for their money at one time there would be less than $1 dollar for every $1000 dollars owed.\nThe world economy collapses. All Great empires based on fiat currencies end in this way. People I talk to like my wife and friends have no clue what is coming. This is a long video and I have edited it to half of its original length. It is the single most logical and credible documentary I have ever watched on the future of the US economy. It makes be sick that the Fed decided to bailout the corrupt bankers instead of the US citizens. Instead of bailing out the banks, the Fed could have paid off every consumer debt in the country and freed up trillions of dollars for the consumer.\nInstead they padded the pockets of the banking elite. I wanted to puke. Now they are setting things up to try one last historic cash grab. Driving the stock market to all time highs so then can short the hell out of it. I think Trump will snuff if he is not assassinated first. I am 58 years old and a registered professional engineer in Maryland. I have owned 3 very different types of businesses over the past 30 years. I am now retired. I have watched hundreds of videos on the economy and done years of research into past financial failures going as back before the Roman Empire. Dr. Paul Roberts is one of my followers and referenced me in a video I produced on Sandy Hook.\nPeople do not want to acknowledge that the fall of fiat currencies is nothing new and that the US has made it this far ONLY because we are the default reserve currency of the world. There have been 440 economies based on fiat currencies in modern history…. They have all come to the same demise, FAILURE. Having an education in Engineering with a minor in mathematics I do not believe that the US is exempt from the natural laws of economics.\nAre you worried about your future? Are you worried by the many disasters that you face in your everyday life? Worry no more. The Lost Ways comes in to solve your woes . This program was created by Davis Claude and its major role is to prepare and teach you how to handle worst-case scenarios using the least independence. This program will therefore motivate you to protect your family and friends during the worst period without the help of the modern technology.\nPlease watch the video and prepare as you deem appropriate. You may want to research “normalcy bias”; it explains why people have a hard time excepting the true outcome of a situation that has played out the same way again and again throughout history. I keep hearing from my friends and family that the US is different. That is true. The US is in much deeper shit than any country in history. If you doubt that watch the entire video. You cannot deny the logic.\nPrepare Now For A Collapse of Epic Proportions\nFor the second time in the space of ten years, the powerful Bilderberg group is plotting to trigger a financial collapse, with elitists already positioning themselves to profit from the next economic meltdown.\nAs we reported back in 2006 during the Bilderberg Group’s meeting in Ottawa, Canada, leaked information from an American delegate revealed that insiders were preparing for the housing bubble to burst and a global market crash.\nOver the course of the next two years, that exact scenario played out, culminating in the collapse of Lehman Brothers and a worldwide recession.\nAs the global financial picture begins to look increasingly bleak, with worries about a Chinese stock market collapse triggering a wider panic, Bilderberg is once again scheming to benefit from the fallout, while the “precariat,” those who are living paycheck to paycheck, are set to suffer the most.\nMainstream news outlets are already starting to use the phrase “economic collapse” to describe what is going on in some areas of our world right now.\nThis video explains the steps one should take to prepare for an Economic Collapse\nFor many Americans this may seem a bit strange, but the truth is that the worldwide economic slowdown that began during the second half of last year is starting to get a lot worse. In this article, we are going to examine evidence of this from South America, Europe, Asia and North America. Once we are done, it should be obvious that there is absolutely no reason to be optimistic about the direction of the global economy right now. The warnings of so many prominent experts are now becoming a reality, and what we have witnessed so far are just the early chapters of a crushing economic crisis that will affect every man, woman and child in the entire world.\nMeanwhile, things are actually much worse in Venezuela than they are in Brazil. Food and basic supplies are in short supply, the inflation rate has hit 720 percent, and crime is completely out of control. G7 in Japan ignored a dire warning issued by Prime Minister Shinzo Abe about the perilous state of the global economy and the risk “of the re-emergence of a Lehman-scale crisis.”\nThe collapse and bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers in 2008, at the time the fourth-largest U.S. investment bank, was the seminal event of the subprime financial crisis. Its implosion resulted in the loss of more than $10 trillion in market capitalization from global equity markets.\nselloffs are occurring in Spain, Italy, Greece and Germany. Economic troubles are intensified by an uncertain geopolitical situation in the Middle East and tensions between the United States, Russia and China.\nInstead of focusing on a looming economic catastrophe, the G7 leaders warned against a Brexit. UK voters will decide on leaving the union during a referendum scheduled for June 23. Why is George Soros selling stocks, buying gold and making “a series of big, bearish investments”?\nWhat is a ‘Global Recession’\nAn extended period of economic decline around the world. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) uses a broad set of criteria to identify global recessions, including a decrease in per-capita gross domestic product worldwide. According to the IMF’s definition, this drop in global output must coincide with a weakening of other macroeconomic indicators, such as trade, capital flows and employment.\nRecessions are caused by several factors. These include:\nHyper Inflation\nDeflation\nProlonged Fall in Exchange Rates\nCredit Crunches\nCollapsing Consumer Confidence\nCollapsing Asset Prices\nCollapsing Global Trade\nBust following Excessive Speculation – e.g., Property Market in Japan -1989\nEvidence so far Leading up to 2016: Collapsing Commodity Prices:\nRecessions caused by deflation see massive collapses in asset prices. There has been a well over 50% plunge in the prices of industrial commodities such as copper and oil.\nThe end of the world as we know it is coming, or at the very least a long period of lawlessness, total anarchy and every-man-for-himself savagery. You are aware of this and want to prepare. One of the things you need to cover (aside from an ample supply of firearms) is food. What food do you stockpile?\nTop Ten Things to Disappear from Grocery Shelves in Crisis\nBottled water (learn the bottled waters to avoid.)\nSoft drinks (learn the 8 kinds of drinks to hoard in crisis).\nBread\nChips and crackers (American’s eat 1.2 billion pounds of\npotato chips annually according to National Geographic).\nSnack bars and energy bars\nMedications\nDiapers\nAlcohol\nCigarettes\nGarbage bags (used to loot the wares).\nWhat Will You Use for Money When the SHTF After the Collapse?\nIt is critically important for preppers to engage with barter and to network with the the growing underground economy. This is how you will survive the dollar crisis and the on-going economic collapse for years to come. Here is what you need to be accumulating this NOW.\nWill you be hoarding food and supplies? Preppers have the right to gather supplies for their survival. The United States Constitution guarantees this right. Arm yourself with knowledge! The Fourth Amendment prohibits unreasonable\nsearch and seizure for concerned citizens of the United States of America. Have the constitution on hand to defend your rights.\nRELATED : BEST BARTERING ITEMS WHEN DISASTERS STRIKE\nFood & Water Storage\nIt is true that the updated order gives the government authority to redistribute food. However, this doesn’t mean that the government can take your food storage.\nThe order is made to make preparations before an emergency and gives the government power to redistribute food during a crisis .\nFood resources is defined in the order as “all commodities and products, (simple, mixed, or compound), or complements to such commodities or products, that are capable of being ingested by either human beings or animals, irrespective of other uses to which such commodities or products may be put, at all stages of processing from the raw commodity to the products thereof in vendible form for human or animal consumption.\n‘ Food resources ‘ also means potable water packaged in commercially marketable containers, all starches, sugars, vegetable, and animal or marine fats and oils, seed, cotton, hemp, and flax fiber, but does not mean any such material after it loses its identity as an agricultural commodity .” ( Read the Executive Order )\nMost people who use social media have figured out that Facebook and Google are in cahoots with the government, for those who are well aware of the issues it’s high time you switched over to Seen.life . It is a website that is similar to Facebook but without all the censorship.\nRELATED : Pioneer Lessons From The Past That Can Save Your Life In The Future\nSOURCE : http://www.prepperfortress.com/economic-collapse-erupting-planet-global-leaders-begin-panic-preppared-now-collapse-epic-proportion/",
