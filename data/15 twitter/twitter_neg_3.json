      "text": "Dream Kardashian already has a Twitter account because of course she does Angelica Florio More By now you have all heard the news that Rob Kardashian and Blac Chyna’s baby, Dream Renee Kardashian, arrived on Thursday. And just at the tender age of… Erm… two days, Dream Kardashian already has a Twitter account. Yes, on Saturday morning, Dream (totally sure that she is the one behind all this) sent out her first tweet that has us all saying, “aww” and also, “hell yeah!” The tweet features a gorgeous up-close shot of Blac Chyna breastfeeding her newborn babe , an image that was also posted on Dream Kardashian’s Instagram, because of course she also is on ‘the Gram!’ It’s no surprise that baby Kardashian is already raking in the followers. The Kardashians’ social media content is often both newsworthy and entertaining . Hopefully baby Dream is ready to join her cousins as their proud parents and relatives share her cuteness for the rest of the world to see. Morning — Dream Kardashian (@dreamkardashian) November 12, 2016 This first one was captioned, “Morning, Bonding time with mommy.” Rob Kardashian is already proudly sharing Dream’s posts on his own Instgram account, sharing a picture of his daughter all bundled up in blankets, with the caption “It was all a DREAM, Haha I love her.” Obviously the family is super excited for her arrival and her eventual social media fame — just like her aunts. Well, internet famous or not, we can’t wait for more hilarity from the Chyna/Kardashian camp like that crazy mid-labor mannequin challenge and sweet shots like this one. Congrats to the happy family!",

      "title": "Are ‘Overwatch’ actors just like their characters? This Twitter video finds out",
      "text": "Overwatch's cast of characters appear to be no different in real life, as a Twitter video post by \"Lúcio\" shows. Just don't try to get McCree to give you the time unless it's actually high noon. More Actors are very rarely anything like the characters they portray in movies and television shows, and with voice actors in video games sometimes recording in dozens of productions a year, this is even more true. But Overwatch appears to be the exception to the trend, at least according to a new video from Blizzard headquarters.\nLúcio runs into Overwatch Characters. @PlayOverwatch @matthewmercer @SilverTalkie @CaraTheobold @carolinaravassa pic.twitter.com/7rfchgJtrA\n— Jonny Cruz (@JonnyCruzzz) November 8, 2016\nIn a Twitter video posted by “Lúcio” actor Jonny Cruz, we see the enthusiastic actor walk around the campus searching for other members of the Overwatch cast. After spotting “Torbjörn” actor Keith Silverstein, they argue over the pronunciation of the character’s name, as well as the disparity between his in-game height versus reality.\n“You … must forgive yourself, brother,” says “Genji” actor Yoshihisa Kawahara in a separate section of the video. His eyes stare into the abyss just as you’d expect from a cybernetic ninja betrayed by those closest to him.\nMore: Overwatch ‘s Sombra is finally official, and Blizzard goes big on the game’s esports scene\n“McCree” actor Matthew Mercer, however, refused to utter his most famous phrase, “ It’s high noon .” This is probably for the best, so as to not send everyone else at Blizzard diving for cover, though Silverstein did act as a substitute.\nNewcomer Carolina Ravassa, the voice of Sombra, also made an appearance to “boop” Cruz on the nose. The gesture has become something of a meme following the latest Overwatch animated short, and it will soon be included in the game as a voice line.\nIt’s as good a time as ever to get back into Overwatch , assuming you ever stopped playing at all. Sombra is now playable in the PC version’s PTR servers, adding an edgy, offensive ’90s hacker character to the already impressive cast, and changes to “quick” matches and the introduction of arcade modes should keep things feeling both fresh and fair.\nNow, “did someone say, ‘peanut butter?'”\nBlizzard appears to accidentally leak a second 'Overwatch' Sombra image First image of new 'Overwatch' character Sombra leaked via internal Blizzard site Long-awaited new heroes and game modes are coming to ‘Overwatch’",

      "text": "UFC 205: Miesha Tate retires after loss, leaving Twitter stunned By Cody Williams/Fansided Nov 12, 2016 at 11:00p ET 0Shares Miesha Tate stunned everyone by announcing her retirement following her loss at UFC 205 and Twitter expressed their shock. \nThe last time that Miesha Tate went into the Octagon, she walked into UFC 200 as the UFC Women’s Bantamweight Champion. Though she didn’t leave with the belt after being dominated by Amanda Nunes, she had her moment at the pinnacle of women’s MMA. Moreover, everyone expected her to come back and rebound in Madison Square Garden at UFC 205 against Raquel Pennington. \nUnfortunately, that didn’t happen. From the first round and throughout, Tate simply looked outmatched and almost uninspired. She survived some close calls, but ultimately lost to Pennington by unanimous decision in the end. When Joe Rogan interviewed her following the bout, though, that’s when Tate dropped the bomb on everyone. \nSaying that this wasn’t “her time” anymore, the 30-year-old Miesha Tate announced her retirement. Despite two consecutive losses, it’s a bit stunning to see a woman who was the champ in her weight division just a few months ago decide to walk away from MMA. \nNeedless to say, fight fans were stunned by the announcement and took to Twitter to express their shock: Wow. Unexpected retirement. Congrats to Miesha Tate on a great career. Sad to see her go. #UFC205 #UFCNYC \n— Doric Sam (@doricsam83) November 13, 2016 Miesha really just announced her retirement I'm so hurt",

In September he went on a an overnight rant against former Miss Universe Alicia Machado, calling her \"disgusting\" after Machado criticized him for past comments.\nPHOTOS: Donald Trump becomes president-elect of the United States \n\nTrump retweeted an unflattering photo of Ted Cruz 's wife during the primary campaign, which was condemned by Cruz and others. He later admitted it was a mistake .\nPresident Barack Obama mocked Trump a day before Tuesday's election, saying Americans could not trust the GOP nominee with the nuclear codes if his aides could not expect him to exercise self-control with his Twitter account.\nIn the \"60 Minutes\" interview, Trump credited social media with his some of his success in the election.\n\"The fact that I have such power in terms of numbers with Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, et cetera, I think it helped me win all of these races where they're spending much more money than I spent,\" Trump said. \"And I won. I think that social media has more power than the money they spent, and I think maybe to a certain extent, I proved that.\"\nThe interview will air on \"60 Minutes\" Sunday at 7 p.m.",

      "text": "By Tom Jensen \nPublished November 13, 2016 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 Email Print If there's been a shocker so far this weekend at Phoenix International Raceway, it's this: Many of the fastest drivers aren't among the eight still fighting for the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series championship.\nSunday's Can-Am 500 at PIR will determine which two drivers will join Jimmie Johnson and Carl Edwards in the championship finale at Homestead-Miami Speedway on Nov. 20.\nBut there are plenty of non-Chasers who want to grab some glory of their own at PIR. And they don't care one bit who's racing for a championship.\nMore from FoxSports NXS: Kyle Busch Dominates - Phoenix 2016 NXS: Blake Koch Wrecks Bubba Wallace Jr. - Phoenix 2016 NXS: Alex Bowman Catches on Fire - Phoenix 2016 Kelley Earnhardt Miller had a crush on Davey Allison | OFF TRACK The top three qualifiers for the race are Alex Bowman, Kyle Larson and Chase Elliott, none of whom is in the Chase.\nIn Saturday's final Happy Hour practice, seven of the nine fastest single-lap speeds were set by drivers outside the Chase.\nAnd in best 10 consecutive lap average speeds during Happy Hour, nine of the top 11 were non-Chasers.\nThis isn't going to be a race where guys just move out of the way, either.\nBowman, the pole-sitter, doesn't have a ride for next year. A win on Sunday might turn his career around. By earning a pole this year, he is now eligible for next year's Sprint Unlimited the weekend before the Daytona 500.\n\"I told Greg (Ives, crew chief) that I just bought a house that has a shop attached to it,\" said Bowman. \"We could take one of their (Hendrick Motorsports) backup speedway cars, call it Greg Ives Racing and go from there.\"\n\"It would be big for anyone to win,\" agreed Larson, who'll start on Row 1 alongside Bowman.\nAnd so, on Sunday at Phoenix, it likely will be a mix of drivers up front -- eight with title aspirations and many others who just want to win the race, Chase be damned.\nWe'll see who prevails.",

      "text": "By Cameron DaSilva \nPublished November 13, 2016 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 Email Print The long-awaited NFL debut for Jared Goff could come relatively soon, and it likely hinges on the play of Case Keenum.\nAccording to ESPN's Adam Schefter , Goff could start as early as next Sunday against the Miami Dolphins. The determining factor will be Keenum's performance against the New York Jets this week.\nIf Keenum -- who's thrown eight interceptions in his last four games (all losses) -- continues to struggle, head coach Jeff Fisher would consider turning to Goff against the Dolphins. The Rams have already lost four in a row, and a fifth loss would significantly hurt their already-slim playoff chances.\nMore from FoxSports Midday Minute NFL edition: Dolphins aim for another W; Bucs, Jags try to halt skids Playoffs, 1st round: Khalil Shakir takes this punt right back where it came from Will the Steelers stop the Cowboys winning streak? | SPEAK FOR YOURSELF Hue Jackson has the most secure job in the NFL | SPEAK FOR YOURSELF A debut next week would make sense, since it's at home -- where fans have been calling for him to start -- and against a not-so-daunting secondary. It appears to be a matter of time before we see Goff, whether that's next week or sometime in the near future.",

(Source: @RealDonaldTrump/Twitter via CNN) More on the Web More>> Friday, November 11 2016 8:00 AM EST 2016-11-11 13:00:42 GMT Updated: Friday, November 11 2016 11:01 AM EST 2016-11-11 16:01:01 GMT \nIt was a brief return to form as the divisive candidate, following two-plus days of positivity in the few tweets Donald Trump posted since the election. More >> \n(CNN) - President-elect Donald Trump took to Twitter on Sunday morning to blast one of the country's biggest news outlets - the New York Times . \nTrump sent out three tweets within about an hour of each other separated by mentions of high-profile figures who called to congratulate him on winning election, such as both former president Bushes and Mitt Romney. \nOne of the barbs directed at the Times alleges it \"is losing thousands of subscribers because of their very poor and highly inaccurate coverage of the 'Trump phenomena.'\" Wow, the @nytimes is losing thousands of subscribers because of their very poor and highly inaccurate coverage of the \"Trump phenomena\" — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 13, 2016 \nThe Times, however, disputes Trump's claims. \nIn a statement to CNN, the news outlet says it has seen a surge in subscriptions to its online product since Election Day. \nAnother Trump tweet called the paper \" dishonest \" in response to a recent article. Trump tweeted the Times said he believes \"more countries should acquire nuclear weapons\" and states that he never said that. \nDuring the campaign, Trump seemed to suggest Japan should be allowed to have a nuclear weapon to protect itself from North Korea. \n\"Wouldn't you rather, in a certain sense, have Japan have nuclear weapons when North Korea has nuclear weapons?\" Trump said to Anderson Cooper. The @nytimes states today that DJT believes \"more countries should acquire nuclear weapons.\" How dishonest are they. I never said this! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 13, 2016 \nThe comments come after Trump recorded an interview CBS' 60 Minutes set to air Sunday night in which he said he will be more \"restrained\" on Twitter now that he's been elected president. \nTrump's campaign was marked by repeated attacks on the media, with the New York Times being a frequent target. He also promised to change laws regarding what the media will be allowed to report. \nThe third tweet alleges the Times apologized in a letter to readers for its coverage. A copy of that letter was shared to Twitter, but it does not contain an apology. The @nytimes sent a letter to their subscribers apologizing for their BAD coverage of me. I wonder if it will change - doubt it? — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 13, 2016 Letter to NYT readers from Arthur Sulzberger Jr. and Dean Baquet pic.twitter.com/jORqzx3BA9 — Sydney Ember (@melbournecoal) November 11, 2016 \nCopyright 2016 CNN.

(Source: @RealDonaldTrump/Twitter via CNN)     8:00 AM EST 2016-11-11 13:00:42  01 AM EST 2016-11-11 16:01:01 GMT \nIt was a brief return to form as the divisive candidate, following two-plus days of positivity in the few tweets Donald Trump posted since the election. Full Story > \n(CNN) - President-elect Donald Trump took to Twitter on Sunday morning to blast one of the country's biggest news outlets - the New York Times . \nTrump sent out three tweets within about an hour of each other separated by mentions of high-profile figures who called to congratulate him on winning election, such as both former president Bushes and Mitt Romney. \nOne of the barbs directed at the Times alleges it \"is losing thousands of subscribers because of their very poor and highly inaccurate coverage of the 'Trump phenomena.'\" Wow, the @nytimes is losing thousands of subscribers because of their very poor and highly inaccurate coverage of the \"Trump phenomena\" — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 13, 2016 \nThe Times, however, disputes Trump's claims. \nIn a statement to CNN, the news outlet says it has seen a surge in subscriptions to its online product since Election Day. \nAnother Trump tweet called the paper \" dishonest \" in response to a recent article. Trump tweeted the Times said he believes \"more countries should acquire nuclear weapons\" and states that he never said that. \nDuring the campaign, Trump seemed to suggest Japan should be allowed to have a nuclear weapon to protect itself from North Korea. \n\"Wouldn't you rather, in a certain sense, have Japan have nuclear weapons when North Korea has nuclear weapons?\" Trump said to Anderson Cooper. The @nytimes states today that DJT believes \"more countries should acquire nuclear weapons.\" How dishonest are they. I never said this! — Donald J.

He also promised to change laws regarding what the media will be allowed to report. \nThe third tweet alleges the Times apologized in a letter to readers for its coverage.

      "text": "By Cameron DaSilva \nPublished November 13, 2016 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 Email Print Cam Newton helped make the dab famous last season as he performed the dance move after just about every touchdown a year ago. He vowed to retire it in 2016, and he did so for the first nine weeks of the season.\nThat changed on Sunday.\nNewton brought back the dab after he scored his first touchdown of the game, which he showed remarkable power on. He bowled over a handful of defenders en route to the end zone before preparing the home crowd for his dab.\nMore from FoxSports Ben Roethlisberger offers advice to Dallas Cowboys QB Dak Prescott| FOX NFL SUNDAY Rob Riggle writes letters as Bill Belichick for his Riggle's Picks during Week 10 | FOX NFL SUNDAY Jay Glazer has the latest updates on full-time officials in the NFL | FOX NFL SUNDAY Cooper Manning eats Tuna with Jarvis Landry #MANNING HOUR | FOX NFL KICKOFF 1.

      "text": " 00   Twitter impresses advertisers with US polls livestream 0 Copy this link Reuters \nTwitter Inc said it was able to deliver more viewers than promised to advertisers on a US election night livestream, good news for the microblogging site as it tries to ward off growing competition for ad dollars from Snapchat and Instagram. \nTwitter partnered with BuzzFeed to host an election night broadcast on Tuesday and attracted major advertisers, including Paramount Pictures, Amazon.com Inc's “Man in the High Castle,” Activision Blizzard Inc's “Call of Duty,” Johnnie Walker and Izod. \nSan Francisco-based Twitter declined to say how much it charged brands to be included in the livestream, but said by email that it overdelivered between two to three times on its live ad impressions that were guaranteed. \nVideo from advertisers fetches higher rates than text and photo-based ads and is seen as key revenue source for Twitter. Snapchat has been building up its ad sales team ahead of next year's IPO and Instagram will take a larger role in growing Facebook Inc's ad revenue.  ",

(Source: @RealDonaldTrump/Twitter via CNN) Trump's Twitter takes shots at New York Times More>> Friday, November 11 2016 8:00 AM EST 2016-11-11 13:00:42 GMT Updated: Friday, November 11 2016 11:01 AM EST 2016-11-11 16:01:01 GMT \nIt was a brief return to form as the divisive candidate, following two-plus days of positivity in the few tweets Donald Trump posted since the election. more>> \n(CNN) - President-elect Donald Trump took to Twitter on Sunday morning to blast one of the country's biggest news outlets - the New York Times . \nTrump sent out three tweets within about an hour of each other separated by mentions of high-profile figures who called to congratulate him on winning election, such as both former president Bushes and Mitt Romney. \nOne of the barbs directed at the Times alleges it \"is losing thousands of subscribers because of their very poor and highly inaccurate coverage of the 'Trump phenomena.'\" Wow, the @nytimes is losing thousands of subscribers because of their very poor and highly inaccurate coverage of the \"Trump phenomena\" — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 13, 2016 \nThe Times, however, disputes Trump's claims. \nIn a statement to CNN, the news outlet says it has seen a surge in subscriptions to its online product since Election Day. \nAnother Trump tweet called the paper \" dishonest \" in response to a recent article. Trump tweeted the Times said he believes \"more countries should acquire nuclear weapons\" and states that he never said that. \nDuring the campaign, Trump seemed to suggest Japan should be allowed to have a nuclear weapon to protect itself from North Korea. \n\"Wouldn't you rather, in a certain sense, have Japan have nuclear weapons when North Korea has nuclear weapons?\" Trump said to Anderson Cooper. The @nytimes states today that DJT believes \"more countries should acquire nuclear weapons.\" How dishonest are they. I never said this! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 13, 2016 \nThe comments come after Trump recorded an interview CBS' 60 Minutes set to air Sunday night in which he said he will be more \"restrained\" on Twitter now that he's been elected president. \nTrump's campaign was marked by repeated attacks on the media, with the New York Times being a frequent target. He also promised to change laws regarding what the media will be allowed to report. \nThe third tweet alleges the Times apologized in a letter to readers for its coverage. A copy of that letter was shared to Twitter, but it does not contain an apology. The @nytimes sent a letter to their subscribers apologizing for their BAD coverage of me. I wonder if it will change - doubt it? — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 13, 2016 Letter to NYT readers from Arthur Sulzberger Jr. and Dean Baquet pic.twitter.com/jORqzx3BA9 — Sydney Ember (@melbournecoal) November 11, 2016 \nCopyright 2016 CNN.

(Photo by Norm Hall/Getty Images) \nThe Arizona Cardinals may not be winning many games this season, but they're still having fun on Sundays.\nCarson Palmer came out for warmups prior to Sunday's game against the 49ers wearing an American-themed onesie. He wasn't sporting it as a part of the league's Salute to Service campaign but because he lost yet another quarterback challenge during the week.\nThis isn't the first time he's lost the weekly bet, of course.

      "text": "Published November 13, 2016 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 Email Print Jacksonville Jaguars wide receiver Marqise Lee (11) makes a reception over Houston Texans free safety Andre Hal (29) during the first half of an NFL football game in Jacksonville, Fla., Sunday, Nov. 13, 2016. (AP Photo/Stephen B. Morton) \nJACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) -- Brock Osweiler threw two touchdown passes, Kareem Jackson returned an interception 42 yards for a score and the Houston Texans handed the Jacksonville Jaguars another home loss, 24-13 Sunday.\nThe Texans (6-3) scored on offense and defense and set up another score with special teams, a complete team effort that led to their first road win of the season and kept them perfect (3-0) against the AFC South. They won their fifth in a row against Jacksonville.\nThe Jaguars (2-7) lost their fourth straight and fell to 0-4 at home. Coach Gus Bradley's team rallied late, with Blake Bortles hitting Allen Robinson for a touchdown and again for a 2-point conversion.\nMore from FoxSports Officials handled the Aaron Rodgers late hit 'properly' Matt Ryan delivers 76-yard bomb for the touchdown against the Eagles New York Jets score TD on perfectly run hook and ladder against Rams Watch Qualcomm Stadium get flipped from an Aztecs game to a Chargers game overnight But the Texans converted a third-and-5 play with 2 minutes to play, essentially ending the game. It dropped Bradley's record to 14-43 in four seasons and prompted even the most loyal supporters to question why owner Shad Khan hasn't made a change.\nHouston had been downright dismal on the road this season, scoring just one touchdown in lopsided losses at New England, Minnesota and Denver. The Texans found Jacksonville to be much more hospitable, especially on the opening drive.\nOn the fifth play of the game, Jackson stepped in front of Allen Hurns, tipped the ball up, bobbled it, secured it and sauntered down the sideline before juking Bortles and high-stepping into the end zone.\nOsweiler made it 14-7 later in the first quarter with a 1-yard pass to wide-open tight end Ryan Griffin. Punt returner Tyler Ervin did most of the work on Houston's third touchdown, weaving his way for 57 yards and setting the Texans up at the 7-yard line. Osweiler hooked up with Stephen Anderson on the next play.\nNick Novak, who missed two field goals earlier in the game, connected on a 51-yarder with 8:32 remaining that gave Houston some breathing room.\nThe Jaguars struggled to move the ball consistently all afternoon and added to their lowlight reel in the second quarter when Bortles did the most Bortles thing of his career.\nUnder heavy pressure and trying to ground the ball near tightly covered running back T.J. Yeldon, Bortles hit Yeldon in the foot. The ball bounced up and landed in linebacker Whitney Mercilus' hands for an interception. It was Bortles' second pick of the day and his sixth in the last five games.\nMISSING MEN \nEven though it came against dysfunctional Jacksonville, Houston's victory was somewhat impressive considering how many key players the team was without.\nStarting receiver Will Fuller (knee), run-stuffing nose tackle Vince Wilfork (groin) and cornerback A.J. Bouye (ankle) were inactive. So was fellow receiver Jaelen Strong, leaving the Texans with just three healthy wideouts (DeAndre Hopkins, Braxton Miller and Keith Mumphrey). Houston turned to its tight ends for help.\nDROUGHT CONTINUES \nThe Jaguars failed once again to score a touchdown on their opening possession, extending the NFL's longest current TD drought to open games.\nJacksonville's streak is now at 23 games after Bortles' interception. The Jaguars haven't found the end zone on their opening drive since Week 2 of the 2015 season against Miami. Since then, they have 17 punts, three field goals and three turnovers -- all interceptions this season -- in their initial possessions. Bortles also threw opening-drive picks against Green Bay and Chicago.",

He earned Comeback Player of the Year and put together a stellar Pro Bowl season. His outstanding play has carried over into 2016.\nOn Sunday against the Panthers, he picked off Cam Newton and ran it back for a touchdown on what was arguably the best pick-six of the season. He made seven Panthers miss -- including Newton -- on his way to the end zone, pulling the Chiefs to within three points after the two-point conversion.\nOH. MY. GOODNESS. @Stuntman1429 picks off Cam...\nAnd SOMEHOW finds paydirt.\nUnbelievable. #ChiefsKingdom #KCvsCAR https://t.co/LcTYHfwwxb \n— NFL (@NFL) November 13, 2016 More from FoxSports Washington Redskins defeat Minnesota Vikings, 26-20 Officials handled the Aaron Rodgers late hit 'properly' Matt Ryan delivers 76-yard bomb for the touchdown against the Eagles New York Jets score TD on perfectly run hook and ladder against Rams The Chiefs would go on to beat the Panthers 20-17 after scoring 17 points in the fourth quarter, capped off by a game-winning field goal by Cairo Santos. Berry's pick-six was the biggest play of the game and is the reason Kansas City got the win.",

      "text": "Published November 13, 2016 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 Email Print PHILADELPHIA (AP) Ryan Mathews ran for 108 yards and two touchdowns, a tenacious defense held down the league's highest-scoring offense and the Philadelphia Eagles beat the Atlanta Falcons 24-15 on Sunday.\nCarson Wentz threw for 231 yards and led the Eagles (5-4) to a comeback victory for the first time this season. Caleb Sturgis made three field goals, including a clutch kick from 48 yards to seal the win late.\nMatt Ryan threw a 76-yard touchdown pass to Taylor Gabriel in the fourth quarter to give Atlanta (6-4) a 15-13 lead, but Philadelphia answered.\nMore from FoxSports Officials handled the Aaron Rodgers late hit 'properly' Matt Ryan delivers 76-yard bomb for the touchdown against the Eagles New York Jets score TD on perfectly run hook and ladder against Rams Watch Qualcomm Stadium get flipped from an Aztecs game to a Chargers game overnight Mathews ran in from the 5 and also converted the 2-point conversion for a 21-15 lead with 7:14 left in the game.\nOn Atlanta's ensuing possession, Julio Jones dropped a pass on third-and-12 and the Falcons punted away. Jones couldn't make a difficult catch on fourth-and-5 on Atlanta's next drive.\nJones, sporting fashionable cleats to support the NFL's Salute To Service, had 10 catches for 135 yards.\nThe Falcons came in averaging 33.8 points. But they settled for field goals of 38, 43 and 46 yards by Matt Bryant before Ryan connected with Gabriel.\nMathews had just nine carries combined in the past two games while 33-year-old Darren Sproles was featured. But coach Doug Pederson made a point to establish the run right away. Mathews carried seven times for 34 yards on the first drive, taking it in from the 4 for a 7-0 lead.\nRookie Wendell Smallwood had 70 yards rushing and Philadelphia finished with a season-high 207 on the ground.\nRyan was 18 of 33 for 267 yards, one TD and one interception.\nHOME DOMINANCE: The Eagles are 4-0 at home, including convincing wins over the Steelers and Vikings.\nDOUBLE DUTY: Bryant had two decent punts after Matt Bosher left with a hamstring injury in the fourth quarter.\nDRIVE-STOPPERS: Vic Beasley Jr. had two sacks, including a strip that forced Wentz to fumble and the Falcons recovered at their own 42. Philip Wheeler stopped Mathews at the 1 and Paul Worrilow tacked Mathews for a 1-yard loss on the next play to force a field goal in the fourth quarter.\nPLAYING DEEP: On consecutive plays to end the first half, Jones and then Eagles wide receiver Dorial Green-Beckham played deep safety to defend potential desperation passes.\nINJURIES: Eagles CB Nolan Carroll left the game late in the first half after sustaining a concussion. ... Falcons CB Desmond Trufant, RB Tevin Coleman and TE Jacob Tamme sat out with injuries. Eagles LG Allen Barbre missed his second straight game.\nUP NEXT: The Falcons host the Arizona Cardinals, while the Eagles visit the Seattle Seahawks.\n---\nhttp://www.pro32.ap.org and -http://www.twitter.com/AP-NFL\n---\nFollow Rob Maaddi on Twitter: https://twitter.com/AP-RobMaaddi",

      "text": "‘Very poor & highly inaccurate’: Trump picks Twitter fight with NY Times Published time: 13 Nov, 2016 22:08 Get short URL U.S. President-elect Donald Trump © Jonathan Ernst / Reuters On the same day he promised a more “restrained” approach to social media, Donald Trump fired off a series of tweets directed at the New York Times. The paper says that it reported on both candidates “fairly” during the race, but Trump does not agree. Trends US Elections 2016 \n“Wow, the @nytimes is losing thousands of subscribers because of their very poor and highly inaccurate coverage of the ‘Trump phenomena’ [sic],” tweeted Trump on Sunday afternoon. Wow, the @nytimes is losing thousands of subscribers because of their very poor and highly inaccurate coverage of the \"Trump phenomena\" — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 13, 2016 \nThe New York Times has denied Trumps allegations, telling Politico that Trump misrepresented its latest circulation figures. While the print edition is selling more poorly, this has been offset by an even higher number of digital subscriptions. \n“The @nytimes sent a letter to their subscribers apologizing for their BAD coverage of me. I wonder if it will change – doubt it?” The @nytimes sent a letter to their subscribers apologizing for their BAD coverage of me. I wonder if it will change - doubt it? — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 13, 2016 \nIn an email to staff, sent on Friday by NY Times publisher Arthur O. Sulzberger Jr, the newspaper, which both endorsed Hillary Clinton, and predicted her win, said that it “reported on both candidates fairly during the presidential campaign,” but questioned if “Donald Trump’s sheer unconventionality lead us and other news outlets to underestimate his support among American voters?” \n“As we reflect on this week’s momentous result, and the months of reporting and polling that preceded it, we aim to rededicate ourselves to the fundamental mission of Times journalism,” promised the publisher. We're proud of our election coverage & we will continue to \"hold power to account.\" Here's what we told our employees & our subscribers: pic.twitter.com/dcaTrAS4mU — NYTCo Communications (@NYTimesComm) November 13, 2016 \nIn a final tweet, Donald Trump wrote that “The @nytimes states today that DJT believes ‘more countries should acquire nuclear weapons.’ How dishonest are they. I never said this!” The @nytimes states today that DJT believes \"more countries should acquire nuclear weapons.\" How dishonest are they. I never said this! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 13, 2016 \nTrump did appear open to the possibility that more countries should or will get their hands on nuclear missiles, although stopped short of saying he would assist this process as President. \n“Well I think maybe it’s not so bad to have Japan – if Japan had that nuclear threat, I’m not sure that would be a bad thing for us,” Trump told the NY Times itself in March. Read more ‘Trump won White House via social media; mainstream media never saw it coming’ \nHe also said he would not be unduly alarmed if South Korea and Saudi Arabia acquired nuclear missiles, telling CNN, also in March, that “it’s going to happen anyway, it’s only a question of time.” \nIn a pre-recorded interview with CBS’ 60 Minutes, which aired on Sunday night, Trump promised that his outbursts on social media would become less frequent. \n“I’m going to be very restrained, if I use it at all, I’m going to be very restrained,” the president-elect said about posting on Twitter once he assumes power. \nAt the same time Trump was not shy in crediting social media with propelling him over the line in an election where his “ground game” appeared to lag behind, while most media were dismissive. \n“The fact that I have such power in terms of numbers with Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, et cetera, I think it helped me win all of these races where they're spending much more money than I spent,” Trump said. “And I won. I think that social media has more power than the money they spent, and I think maybe to a certain extent, I proved that.”",

      "text": "By Cameron DaSilva \nPublished November 13, 2016 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 Email Print The Kansas City Chiefs are the most underrated team in the NFL.\nThere, I said it. They're more overlooked than the Raiders, the Lions, the Texans -- heck, even the Falcons get more attention than them. Yet, all the Chiefs do is win football games, and win a lot of them.\nThey're 17-2 in their last 19 regular-season games. No team is even close to that mark, which is remarkable. Not even the Patriots can match that, going 14-5 in their last 19 regular-season games. The Chiefs nearly knocked them out of the playoffs last year in their 27-20 loss in the divisional round, but they'd certainly relish the opportunity to do so again this season.\nMore from FoxSports Jimmy Johnson explains why QB Cousins should get paid this offseason | FOX NFL SUNDAY Michael Strahan with high praise for the Eagles defense after Week 10 win | FOX NFL SUNDAY Rams' Hekker pins Jets deep with 78-yard punt Washington Redskins defeat Minnesota Vikings, 26-20 As it stands right now, the Chiefs are the Patriots' biggest threat in the AFC. They own the second-best record in the conference thanks to the fact that they've allowed just 168 points in nine games -- third-best in the AFC.\nWhat makes the Chiefs so dangerous is the fact that they can get it done in so many different ways. Alex Smith went down for a game and a half, giving way to Nick Foles as the quarterback. He came in and executed Andy Reid's game plan to near-perfection, completing 65.5 percent of his passes for 410 yards and three touchdowns.\nHe didn't turn it over once in 55 pass attempts, showing glimpses of his 2013-self when he threw 27 touchdowns and two interceptions. Not many teams have a backup capable of putting up those sorts of numbers, and it's a testament to Reid's quarterback-friendly offense.\nIt wasn't just Smith who's gotten hurt either. Jamaal Charles has played exactly three games during the Chiefs' remarkable 19-game run. He's been placed on IR and is likely out for the season, but the Chiefs haven't missed a beat. Since the Chiefs began this hot streak in Week 7 of last season, Charles has rushed for 40 yards. Granted, he's been injured, but how many teams would win 17 of 19 games with its starting running back essentially non-existent? Not many. Just look at the Vikings as an example.\nEven with Charles' injury, Smith's brief absence and Jeremy Maclin's recent injury, as well, the Chiefs have remained productive on offense -- against a couple of playoff contenders, too.\nThey blew out the Raiders 26-10, beat the Saints 27-21, dominated the Colts 30-14, and beat the resurgent Panthers 20-17 on Sunday. They also beat the Chargers in Week 1 thanks to a remarkable comeback in the fourth quarter and overtime.\nGranted, those aren't the best teams in the league, but they're fairly talented in their own rights. They've beaten the teams they should've -- usually in dominant fashion -- and lost to two teams with playoff aspirations (Texans and Steelers).\nWhat makes the Chiefs so dangerous is their defense. Justin Houston, an elite pass rusher, hasn't played a game all season. He was there for only five games during the Chiefs' 10-game winning streak last season, yet they continued to dominate without him. They've gotten production from unlikely players like Dee Ford (10 sacks this season) and Phillip Gaines (one interception, two forced fumbles). And even when they seem to be out of the game, the defense comes up big.\nWith the Chiefs trailing 17-3 in the fourth quarter, they fought back with outstanding play on defense. Eric Berry picked off Cam Newton and returned it 42 yards for a touchdown after making just about the entire Panthers offense missed. That pulled the Chiefs to within three.\nOH. MY. GOODNESS. @Stuntman1429 picks off Cam...\nAnd SOMEHOW finds paydirt.\nUnbelievable. #ChiefsKingdom #KCvsCAR https://t.co/LcTYHfwwxb \n— NFL (@NFL) November 13, 2016 After tying it with a field goal later on, Newton and the Panthers had a chance to win it with a game-winning drive. On the first play of the possession, the Chiefs got a huge play from their biggest playmaker: Marcus Peters. He ripped the ball away from Kelvin Benjamin with just 29 seconds remaining. He returned it to Carolina's 29-yard line, setting up a victory-clinching field goal after an 11-yard rush by Spencer Ware.\nHe ripped him! @MarcusPeters rips it right out of Kelvin Benjamin's hands.\nGoing the other way! #KCvsCAR https://t.co/ufUPaDLmYE \n— NFL (@NFL) November 13, 2016 It's plays like those that keep the Chiefs in games, even when they're out-possessed 35:12 to 24:48.\nThe Panthers even went on a 20-play, 10-minute drive that ended with a punt thanks to a crucial 12-yard sack on third down from the 28-yard line. Without that timely sack, the Panthers get at least three points out of it and change the complexion of the game.\nThe Chiefs don't do one thing better than every other team in the NFL, but they do a whole bunch of things extremely well. They protect the football, move the chains in a variety of ways, and run the ball with great efficiency. Oh, not to mention, they have one of the best defenses in football … without Justin Houston. When he returns, watch out.\nThe Patriots better watch out for the Chiefs, as should every other team in the NFL. They're scorching hot and playing as well as anyone. It's time for everyone to stop overlooking them.",

      "text": "0 via Twitter Donald Trump's election has spurred a variety of responses. There have been protests (and even the occasional riot ), increased hate crimes from newly emboldened racists, and more. One other response has been people wearing safety pins. The safety pin has become a symbol meant to show the wearer's solidarity with victims of racism. It grew out of a similar practice in the U.K. that developed in the wake of Brexit. But now, one jewelry maker has decided to take this humble symbol to the next level. Rebecca Cullen is advertising gold safety pin necklaces on her Etsy store . While they were not originally created with Trump in mind (they date to 2008), the ad copy explains that for the low price of $335, you can show that you are \"[a] gainst homophobia, racism, xenophobia, sexism and ablism.\" More than a few Twitter users thought it strange (and even a little distasteful) that a simple anti-racist symbol was being turned into a big money-maker. If anyone is tempted by a fucking $300 safety pin necklace you could spend $10 on BLM pin & give $290 to groups working to make people safe. — sparklefists mcgee ( @emilytheslayer ) November 13, 2016 Tacky tacky tacky. Shame on you, Rebecca Cullen. Just shameful. https://t.co/ 480cB05raJ — sb in the nyc ( @saibellanyc ) November 14, 2016 Rebecca Cullen Jewelry better be donating 300 of those dollars to good causes or that's some shit https://t.co/ HwBU5cDtaU",

Trump has pioneered the way candidates can use social media to get their message to voters. Credit: (Courtesy Photo) IN FOCUS: David Gerzof Richard prev next comments David Gerzof Richard, a professor of communication sciences at Emerson College and founder of BIGfish Communications, said President-elect Donald Trump, who amassed a Twitter following well before announcing his run, pioneered ways a candidate can use the social media platform to stir support, hone a message, and take the public’s pulse:\n“Twitter provided him with a 24/7 focus group to be able to put a message out there, very short, succinct message, and get feedback for it in relatively simple terms — number of re-tweets, number of @ mentions.\nIf you actually look back, he was tweeting these things long before he was saying them. The reason he was so good with his message is he had such a long time to be able to work and refine it. This is a strategy that worked really well. He basically single-handedly took on the entire Clinton team and won. Yes, he used it to campaign to win the presidency, but now he has to campaign to do other things.\nIf he wants to build a wall, he’s going to need to campaign for it. If he wants to invest in infrastructure, he’s going to need to campaign for it. And I truly believe that what he’s going to do is similar to what he did to anyone that obstructed his way to the White House — bulldoze them on Twitter.\nI can see him doing the exact same thing as president, trying to get something passed and having a senator or a congressman stand in the way. There’s a strong likelihood they would find themselves getting the Twitter spotlight put on them. And everybody that is Trump’s constituency, will probably get behind that and amplify that message. Literally, he could call out any obstructionist he wants on Twitter, and instantly everybody’s going to re-tweet that, and sparks will start flying out of that person’s phone.\nTo go from one or two mentions a day, to suddenly the entire application of Trump’s Twitter army coming after you, it’s quite attention-getting. I don’t necessarily know that alone would change someone’s mind, but it would certainly give them pause. To say, ‘Is this really something that I want to get into?’ It’s basically the smoke before the fire of what’s coming down the pipe at you.\nIronically, Twitter is a huge winner in the election. If you look at Twitter, it’s been on the decline. They’ve been having a really difficult time growing the platform, getting new users. With a president that uses Twitter as a main communication platform, all of a sudden at least half of America needs to follow him.\nThere’s a lot of people that I think did not want to hear his messages and decided, ‘I’m not going to follow him, I’m not going to give him that one extra number on his followers.’ Now, a lot of America is going to tune in to follow him. Suddenly there’s going to be countries waking up and being like, ‘What is this Twitter thing? We need to get on this, we need to follow this guy.’ ”",

Officers said they tried to stop the vehicle but it sped off... A search ensued. When officers eventually managed to catch up with the speeding car, it was found that Malema had been on the passenger side. His driver was arrested instead.

Stickers, which are small images that can be added to photos you tweet, can be used on mobile devices with the Twitter app.\nThe stickers are promotional for the upcoming Pokémon Sun and Moon, which release on November 18. As seen in the short video below, you can add Pokémon Sun and Moon's Rowlet, Litten, Popplio to your images, or just a simple Pokéball. If you want to use stickers, just click on a photo you want to upload to twitter and then press the smiley face to see the full list of stickers. \nNow you can be the very best, with featured @Pokemon #Stickers ! pic.twitter.com/wdQ5UMY3bq \n— Twitter (@twitter) November 13, 2016 \nFor more on Pokémon Sun and Moon, check out our interview with series producer, director and composer Junichi Masuda where we asked all our burning questions.",

      "text": "A Chinese ship docked at Pakistan's newly built Gwadar port. (Photo: Twitter) Islamabad : Pakistan’s top civilian and military leaders travelled to the country’s southwest on Sunday to open a new international trade route by seeing off a Chinese ship that’s exporting goods to the Middle East and Africa from the newly built Gwadar port.\nThe first convoy of Chinese trucks carrying goods for sale abroad has arrived in Pakistan amid tight security using a road linking Gwadar to China’s northwestern Xinjiang region, the government said in a statement.\nPrime Minister Nawaz Sharif said that Pakistan will provide best possible security to foreign investors to enable them to use the Chinese-funded port for international trade.\nAmid security concerns for foreign workers, the Pakistani army has created a special force to guard the new trade routes and the port, which is located in insurgency-wracked Baluchistan province where an overnight blast at a shrine killed nearly 50 people.\nThe attack was claimed by the Islamic State group and Pakistani officials said it was aimed at harming the Chinese-funded projects in the southwest and elsewhere in the country.\nChina is building a network of roads and power plants under a project known as China-Pakistan Economic Corridor that is expected to absorb $46 billion in Chinese investment in the coming decades.\nChina and Pakistan have long maintained close political and military relations, based partly on mutual antipathy toward neighbor India. Gwadar port is located on the Arabian Sea and it occupies a strategic location between South Asia, Central Asia and the Middle East. The port is also located at the mouth of the Persian Gulf, just outside the Straits of Hormuz.\nChina is seeking convenient and reliable access to the Arabian Sea and the Indian Ocean. Chinese ships now use the Strait of Malacca, a narrow passage between the Malay Peninsula and Indonesia. The proposed new route would give China access to the Persian Gulf region and the Middle East.",

      "text": "Published November 14, 2016 Reuters Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print A company logo is seen at a Pfizer office in Dublin  (Copyright Reuters 2016) \nNEW ORLEANS –   Pfizer Inc's Celebrex arthritis drug was shown to be at least as safe as the widely used prescription-strength versions of painkillers ibuprofen and naproxen, and does not appear to cause heart problems that spurred the withdrawal of rival Vioxx, according to a large 10-year study presented on Sunday.\nThe study of arthritis sufferers is likely to raise eyebrows, given long-held concerns about Celebrex. Some 100 million prescriptions were written in the United States in 2013 alone for the type of painkiller known as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or NSAIDS, to which all three drugs belong.\nMore on this...

      "text": " Google+\nJosh Haner/The New York Times/file\nDonald Trump demonstrated the Twitter app on Samsung phone in his New York office in 2015.\nBy Matt Rocheleau Globe Staff November 14, 2016\nIf President Barack Obama’s mobile communication privileges are any indication, Donald Trump, once he takes over as the world’s most powerful leader, may no longer be able to use Twitter via cellphone as easily as he can now.\nWhen Obama’s presidency began in 2009, some of his advisers, White House lawyers, and Secret Service officials urged him to go without a cellphone, for security reasons and so that his personal communications wouldn’t be the target of public records requests or subpoenas, the New York Times reported then .\nAdvertisement\nHowever, Obama pushed back, and won — kind of . He reached a compromise in which he was allowed to continue using a BlackBerry, the brand of device he’d grown obsessed with, the Times reported. But he had to use a specially-made device that came with beefed-up security courtesy of the National Security Agency . There were also severe restrictions on how the device could be used.\nEarlier this year, Obama revealed in a television interview that he’d upgraded to a new smartphone. But again, the device’s capabilities were severely limited, for security purposes.\nGet Fast Forward “I was this cool high-tech guy when I got there, right. And I was the first president to have a BlackBerry,” Obama said during an appearance on The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon in June . “Finally, this year, they said ‘Good news, Mr. President, we’re going to give you a smartphone instead of a BlackBerry.’”\n“I get the thing and they’re all, like, ‘Well, Mr. President for security reasons — this is a great phone, state-of-the-art — but it doesn’t take pictures, you can’t text, the phone doesn’t work, you know, you can’t play music on it,” Obama added. “So basically it’s like, does your 3-year-old have one of those play phones?”\nBut were Obama’s no-frills phones capable of tweeting?\nAdvertisement\nIt’s not entirely clear.\nIn May 2015, when Obama sent out the inaugural tweet from the @POTUS handle, he used a different cellphone than the one he was regularly using at the time, BuzzFeed reported then. But it was unclear why he used a different phone, and White House officials declined to say specifically what features Obama’s mobile phone was equipped with, including whether it was capable of sending tweets.\nAt least some tweets from the @POTUS handle recently have come from mobile devices, including cellphones and tablets. Perhaps those are Obama’s devices, perhaps they belong to his aides, or are shared among staffers in the office. It’s not clear.\nTweets from Trump’s handle @realDonaldTrump have also come from phones. Trump has tweeted that he uses smartphones and he told CNN in April that his tweets are his own words, noting that sometimes he actually types the tweets himself and other times he has staffers do it.\nIn an interview with the New York Times last fall , Trump demonstrated his mobile tweeting skills. However, a report by Bloomberg in June said that he doesn’t carry a mobile phone with him.\nIt’s possible that Trump will curtail his Twitter use, anyway. He told “60 Minutes” in an interview that aired Sunday on CBS, “I’m going to be very restrained, if I use it at all, I’m going to be very restrained.” At the same time, he hailed Twitter as a “modern form of communication,” and said it was “tremendous” and gave him a “method of fighting back” against what he feels is negative or inaccurate coverage in the media.\nTrump will be inaugurated Jan. 20, and when that happens existing social media accounts now run by Obama and his staff, will be made available to Trump and his team. The @POTUS Twitter handle, for example, will retain its more than 11 million followers but start with no tweets on the timeline, White House officials said recently . Tweets from the Obama administration will be archived on a new handle, @POTUS44 .\nQuestions about the digital communication restrictions that presidents face, including ones about Obama and Trump, were referred by a Secret Service spokesman to the White House. A White House spokesman referred questions to Trump’s team. Officials from Trump’s team, as well as from the NSA and Twitter, did not respond.\nMatt Rocheleau can be reached at matthew.rocheleau@globe.com . Follow him on Twitter @mrochele",

Then, after they disclosed her address, he threatened to kill her, kidnapped her children, and subjected her to an horrific rape that left her needing an abortion, reports  MailOnline .\nEYE FOR AN EYE? IRANIAN THUG BLINDED FOR THROWING ACID IN 4-YEAR-OLD GIRL'S FACE \nLubna, who was brought up in the north of England in a middle-class family, reportedly was sexually and physically abused by her husband – who she joined with under an arranged marriage.\nBut after he left her to pursue a new life in America with a new woman, Lubna decided she would file for divorce through the British legal system.\nWOMEN UNITE TO TAKE 'HONOR' OUT OF KILLING IN PAKISTAN \nShe was given a restraining order to protect her from her furious husband – who had returned to the UK to fight the split – and was granted custody of their children.\nHer nightmare began however when her estranged husband told a prayer meeting at her local east London mosque that she was a “loose women being pimped out by her widowed mother”.\nAlthough at least one imam knew the horrific background to her marriage, a group from the mosque visited her family to persuade her to return. When that failed, the imam, an old family friend, put more pressure on Lubna to go to the Sharia court near London’s Regent’s Park.\nTo avoid shaming her devout Muslim mother Lubna agreed but the “judges” didn’t care about the plight she’d suffered at her violent ex’s hands and repeatedly told the young woman and her mother to be “silent”.\nSpeaking to the One Law for All campaign which is working to ban Sharia courts to improve Muslim women’s rights, Lubna said: “The court was incredibly difficult. My mother and I were repeatedly told to be silent. None of the information from the civil proceedings, including non-molestation orders, was admissible in the Sharia court.\n“When my ex-husband said he wanted a reconciliation, the judges said I should comply.\nMore from The Sun Lottery winner allegedly throttled wife and beat child after claiming win would make 2016 a ‘great year for his family’",

      "text": "Published November 14, 2016 Reuters Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print CT scans of skulls.  (iStock) \nDoctors in the Netherlands say they have successfully tested an implantable computer-brain interface that allowed the mind of a \"locked-in\" patient to spell messages at the rate of two letters per minute.\nThe system was tested on a 58-year-old woman in the late stages of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or ALS. Unable to speak or move her muscles, she had to identify the letters by imagining that she was moving her right hand. Previously, her only method to communicate was through eye movements and blinks.\n\"We've built a system that's reliable and autonomous that works at home without any extra help. There's not a single system that even comes close to this,\" chief author Nick Ramsey of the Rudolf Magnus Brain Center at the University Medical Center Utrecht told Reuters Health by phone.\nVikash Gilja, a professor of electrical and computer engineering at the University of California San Diego, who was not connected with the research, said the system used by the Ramsey team \"does not push the envelope of performance, but that was not the purpose of the study. The news here is they have developed a system they fitted to one individual over a long time period and that individual was able to use it on their own without a lot of technical support.\"\n\"Those are major accomplishments,\" he told Reuters Health by phone. \"It takes us a big step closer to real worldwide-scale clinical translation of an implanted brain-machine interface.\"\nThe hope is that such systems could eventually help others who can't move but whose brains are still capable of thought and communication, such as some stroke victims.\nThe new research, presented November 12 at the annual meeting of the Society for Neuroscience in San Diego and published online by the New England Journal of Medicine, was an attempt to find a method that could be used continuously at home without discomfort or disfigurement.\nDetecting brain signals can be challenging because the brain generates a lot of electrical noise, and screening out the important signals can be a challenge.\nIn this case, four sensor strips for detecting discharges from the cortex were placed over the hand region of the brain's left motor cortex. The surgery was done through four burr holes drilled through the skull. Each strip had four electrodes. The leads were tunneled under the skin to an amplifier and transmitter anchored in the woman's chest. An antenna placed outside the body near the transmitter picked up the signals and conveyed them to the computer. Placement of the implanted equipment required two surgeries lasting a total of just under eight hours.\nTesting was done over 28 weeks. The researchers then moved to a training period where, for example, the woman tried to hit a target on a video screen by thinking about moving and relaxing her hand. There was also a key task where the woman tried to accomplish the equivalent of clicking on a mouse button trying to move her hand for about 1 second.\nWhen it came time to spell words, letters would be highlighted on a computer screen and the woman would try to \"click\" on the one she wanted.\nIt took the researchers several months to refine their algorithms to inhibit unintended brain clicks. Results from eye tracking were used to confirm what the volunteer typed.\nInitially, the woman needed 52 seconds to identify one letter. \"The time required dropped to 33 seconds per letter when word prediction was used,\" the researchers reported. At times, she can do up to four letters per minute.\n\"The speed is not that important. It's the certainty with which you can express yourself,\" said Ramsey, who explained that the woman has come to rely on the system when she goes outdoors, where her eye tracking equipment doesn't always work.\nMore on this...

      "text": "Published November 14, 2016 FoxNews.com Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print   \nDonald Trump is defying tradition in more ways than one.\nThe most unconventional president-elect in modern times, who happens to be “really rich,” says he has no plans to take the presidential salary to which he’s entitled.\nPlus, advisers reportedly say the billionaire businessman wants to continue to spend time at his penthouse apartment in downtown Manhattan when he can – and might return to Trump Tower and other locations he calls home on weekends, working from the White House during the week.  \nTrump gave a direct answer when asked about the presidential salary of $400,000.\n“I'm not going to take the salary. I'm not taking it,” he told CBS’ “60 Minutes.”\nHe said he thinks he has to take $1 by law, “so I’ll take $1 a year.”\nPredictions Map See the Fox News 2016 battleground prediction map and make your own election projections. See Predictions Map → \nTrump said he didn’t even know what the salary was, before CBS’ Lesley Stahl told him.\nMeanwhile, The New York Times reports that the family is still working out the particulars of where they’ll live and work. Melania Trump is expected to move to Washington, but it’s unclear when that will happen since their young son Barron is in the middle of a school year.\nTrump reportedly is talking to advisers about splitting his time between the White House and New York.\nAccording to the report, advisers said Trump might spend most of the week at the White House, and return to Trump Tower or Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach or even his New Jersey golf course in Bedminster on the weekends.\nWhile members of Congress often travel home on weekends, and modern presidents often travel occasionally back to their home cities or states, it would be unusual for a president to routinely leave on the weekends.\nAs noted by Heat Street , George W. Bush often brought his staff to the “Western White House” in Crawford, Texas. But he and other presidents were still full-time Washington residents.",

      "text": "By Cameron DaSilva \nPublished November 14, 2016 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 Email Print The Tampa Bay Buccaneers had a field day against Jay Cutler and the Chicago Bears on Sunday, beating them 36-10 at home. The Bucs defense picked off Cutler twice and allowed just one touchdown on a Hail Mary at the end of the first half, dominating in every facet of the game.\nFor as big of a win as it was, no one was happier than Chris Conte. He picked off Cutler and returned it 20 yards for a touchdown, while also adding seven total tackles.\nAfterward, he expressed just how happy he was to beat his former team after it opted not to re-sign him following the 2014 season.\nMore from FoxSports The 2016-17 Pittsburgh Steelers have big problems after their Week 10 loss | THE HERD Seahawks QB Russell Wilson is the best big game QB in the NFL - Colin explains why | THE HERD NFL Debate: The 2 best teams in the NFL (Week 10, 2016-17 NFL season) | UNDISPUTED Packers lost to the Tennessee Titans in Week 10 - What is wrong in Green Bay? | UNDISPUTED \"I hate to make it personal, but for me it is personal,\" he said, via the Chicago Tribune . \"It feels great. I don't want to say, '(Expletive) you, Chicago.' But, I want to say, '(Expletive) you, Chicago.' \" \nIt was nothing personal against Cutler. Conte actually had kind words for the Bears quarterback.\n\"I have a ton of respect for Jay Cutler,\" Conte said. \"I think he's a great quarterback, and I think he gets a bad rap in Chicago, like a lot of people do, including me.\"\nConte obviously relished the chance to make his former team pay for letting him walk. He kept the football from his pick-six in his locker after the game, showing just how much the win meant to him.\nAs for the interception, he called it \"a gift\" thanks to the pressure Tampa Bay got on Cutler. Gift or not, Conte couldn't have asked for a better time to score his first career touchdown.",

      "text": "2 \nOver the past few years, Twitter has worked diligently to establish itself as one of the leaders in the technology sector. Unfortunately, the company has hit a few roadblocks along the way. Despite doing a number of things right, Twitter just cannot seem to turn the corner and begin generating a consistent revenue. At this point in time, Twitter is right where it needs to be; a good acquisition. The social media outlet has gained enormous popularity during the presidential event and thanks to its decision to begin streaming live sporting events. Presidential candidate Donald Trump is commonly known to take to Twitter to insult his opponents. \nThis has encouraged new growth for the social network. It has been noted that Twitter’s NFL streaming is off to a good start. The Twitter NFL stream has proven to be very reliable and it may very well be responsible for the NFL’s dwindling ratings. Unfortunately, it is unknown how much the venture has really helped the failing social network. It is believed that Twitter has been unable to monetize the stream effectively and this could result in unsatisfying earnings. Of course, Twitter isn’t going to disappear off of the Internet. On the contrary, it is highly likely that Twitter will be acquired by a much more successful company, such as Google or Disney. And, Twitter will live on in a whole new form. \nTwitter’s Periscope feature, which has been compared to a modern Kande Photo Booth Rental that can go viral, has managed to attract a lot of users. Nonetheless, that isn’t going to help current Twitter staff. According to recent reports , Twitter will reduce its staff by as much as 8% and this could happen during this week! In total, that will equate to a loss of approximately 300 jobs. This is not the first time the company has been forced to lay off staff. Just a year ago, CEO Jack Dorsey made a similar cut. At the time, the goal was to cut costs, while trying to finally generate a revenue. Nonetheless, Yahoo was recently acquired by Verizon, so there is hope for Twitter. \nTwitter has experienced some setback as of late, with a slower growth pattern and grim earnings. The company has considered selling itself, but the experts are wondering who would be the best candidate. Twitter was launched 10 years ago, and as of 2012, there were over 100 million users , posting an average of 340 million tweets on a daily basis. However, the company’s future is still in question, but there is hope at the end of the tunnel. Disney and Salesforce were mulling over the decision of whether or not to invest in Twitter. Both companies pulled out, leaving Microsoft, Verizon, and Apple to decide Twitter’s fate. \nTwitter might not be able to make a profit, but it is still a powerful force in the tech industry. The Periscope feature has proven to be great and has given people all around the world a platform to make their voices heard. Plus, Twitter has been impactful during the presidential election. Suffice to say, Twitter isn’t going anywhere anytime soon, but it may be forced to change.

      "text": "Fans troll Luke Shaw after Man Utd star posts video to Twitter [Tweets] Published 24/7 \nLuke Shaw's season started off well, the England left back returning from a lengthy injury lay off to impress in the first few weeks of the campaign. \nHowever, in recent times, the Manchester United star has been in the headlines for the wrong reasons after being called out by Jose Mourinho on more than one occasion. \nThe latest, after the Red Devils' 3-1 win over Swansea City earlier this month, because he apparently refused to play through pain in his rehabilitated knee. Article continues below \nPerhaps Shaw had his manager's criticism in mind, then, when he posted a video to his official Twitter account which showed him \"ticking over\" on his weekend off with a gym workout. \nIndeed, with Mourinho supposedly unimpressed with the defender's work ethic since in recent weeks, it certainly seems like Shaw was trying to send a not so subtle message to the Portuguese manager. Article continues below Spain’s XI that beat England 1-0 in 2007: Where are they now? \nHowever, judging by some of the responses from United fans to the above video, Shaw may have misjudged just how much support he has amongst the Red Devils fan base. \nStill only 21-years-old, Shaw undoubtedly has a bright future ahead of him. However, the past 18 months or so have certainly been difficult for the former Southampton man. \nRed Devils fans may be a little frustrated with him right now, but there is no doubt that they will be hoping he can turn around his fortunes over the next few weeks and months. \nWith sensational rumours linking him to Liverpool, the last thing they would want to do would be to hound Shaw out of the club and into the hands of their fiercest rivals. \nAs for changing Mourinho's mind? The best way to do that would probably be to impress in training rather than show off that you are doing some exercises in your garage. \nDo YOU want to write for GiveMeSport?

      "text": "Sunday Night Football used bizarre Tom Brady photos, and Twitter had a field day Posted by Andrew Bucholtz on Nov 14, 2016 17:00 \nThe selection of photos used for a NFL broadcast can provoke significant comment, as with Fox’s bad photoshops of Sam Bradford’s head onto Teddy Bridgewater’s body and then Bradford’s head onto Matt Cassel’s body . NBC drew some significant commentary of their own for the photos of Tom Brady they utilized during this week’s Patriots-Seahawks Sunday Night Football broadcast yesterday, so much so that Twitter turned it into one of their curated moments . Here are some highlights from that. Umm… what is going on with Tom Brady in this photo? pic.twitter.com/w7iyFU39VH \n— Tanner Stines (@T_Stines) November 14, 2016 Brady #snf photo game on point.

Last week, the bureau hired Dataminr, a Twitter-linked analytics firm, to provide an “advanced alerting tool” to over 200 users. Twitter owns a 5 percent stake in Dataminr and provides it with exclusive access to the full “firehose” of live tweets, making it a valuable resource for anyone looking for illegal activity on the service.\n\n“Twitter is used extensively by terrorist organizations and other criminals to communicate, recruit, and raise funds for illegal activity,” the FBI wrote in a contracting document. “With increased use of Twitter by subjects of FBI investigations, it is critical to obtain a service which will allow the FBI to identify relevant information from Twitter in...",

Mounib, leader of the Federation of the Democratic Left, campaigned across Morocco ahead of Oct. 7 parliament elections. Mounib is the country’s most high-profile female politician and is seen as a trailblazer in a region where men still dominate politics. (AP Photo/Karin Laub)  (The Associated Press) \nPrevious Next CASABLANCA, Morocco –   The polls have just closed. In a room decorated with posters and leftist slogans, Nabila Mounib is surrounded by activists who take selfies with her and wish her luck.\nShe's keenly aware of the stakes. Mounib, a 56-year-old endocrinology professor, is Morocco's most high-profile female politician, and this election marks her debut on the national stage as a party leader. After two weeks of campaigning across the country in a cramped mini-bus, she will find out the next day if she has succeeded in getting her party into parliament and winning a seat herself.\nIt's a moment she's worked for all her adult life, while raising three children. Even now, in the anxiety-tinged bustle, she's caught in the push-pull of a working mother. She excuses herself to rush home and help her 16-year-old son Haroune with his science homework.\n\nEDITOR'S NOTE: This story is part of a series of profiles of Arab women fighting for change in different countries and areas of life.\n\nMounib is still a rarity in the Arab world — a female politician in a leadership position. When it comes to the gender gap in politics, Morocco ranks 97th out of 145 countries, according to the World Economic Forum. Many Arab countries score even lower.\nDespite her relatively privileged upbringing as the daughter of a diplomat, Mounib says she learned early on that women have to outperform men to prove their worth. She is guarded about her personal life, but speaks passionately about the role of women.\n\"Women have to struggle extra hard in every aspect of what they do,\" she says. \"The main reason I decided to pursue politics was to reach these heights, to reach these ceilings, and to shatter them for other women...I want to create an example, a historic example, a successful example.\"\n\nON THE TRAIL\nDespite the hopes raised by the Arab Spring five years ago, women in the region still hold only 17.6 percent of seats in parliament. That's the second lowest regional score in the world, although still not far from the global average of 22.8 percent, according to the Inter-Parliamentary Union.\nIn Morocco, it's 20.5 percent, mainly because of a women's quota.\nIn this election, Mounib's Unified Socialist Party is allied with two others to form the Federation of the Democratic Left. The alliance is a first for a notoriously fractured progressive movement that presents itself as an alternative to pro-monarchy and Islamist parties.\nThe campaign kicks off in Marrakesh, the country's fourth largest city. Mounib is accompanied by four young volunteers, including her 25-year-old daughter Dounia. The white bus is covered with large posters of Mounib smiling confidently.\nHer work ethic shows, with meetings often running late into the night because she won't turn away supporters. During long rides, she conducts phone interviews with Moroccan and French media outlets.\nThe mood is casual. Mounib insists that the driver eat with the team. He is almost instantly transformed from a random stranger into an ardent supporter, sitting in the front row when she delivers her daily stump speech.\nDuring stops, a smiling Mounib — often dressed casually in jeans, a white campaign T-shirt and orange sneakers — steps off the bus for photos. The crowd, almost all men, respectfully call her \"ustada,\" or professor. She calls women to the front.\nHer calm only rarely gives way to flashes of irritation, such as a raised voice, mostly over planning mishaps. Mounib routinely runs late to meetings or rallies because of bad roads and unforeseen stops. \"Honestly, I do feel this pressure,\" she later says about leading a national campaign.\nSuccess is far from a shoo-in. The Federation has struggled to extend its appeal beyond urban, educated Moroccans. It can't rely on the patronage networks of the pro-monarchy parties and lacks the Islamists' deep roots in poorer urban areas.\nMounib tries to reach rural audiences with demands for social justice --narrow the wealth gap, fight nepotism, improve education.\nIn Guelmim, a town of more than 100,000 people near the Western Sahara, the crowd of about 200 — mostly men — listens without heckling or interruptions, a display of politeness fairly typical at such rallies in Morocco. The audience bursts into applause when she alludes to sex scandals involving senior members of another party.\nThe husky-voiced Mounib is lively and confident, gesturing as she delivers her speeches in earthy Darija, Morocco's colloquial language. In years of public speaking, she's learned to slip in a joke or jab at an opponent to reel back a drifting audience. She took up karate when she was younger — a sport she says helped with concentration and public speaking.\n\"Our society teaches us to be shy and keep to ourselves,\" she says of women in Morocco. \"I've always been outspoken.\"\n___\nIN THE FAMILY\nMounib grew up in Casablanca as the seventh of nine children.\nWhen she was 14, her father was assigned to a diplomatic posting in neighboring Algeria. There, she studied civics in school for the first time, a subject then not taught in Morocco.\nThe six oldest siblings remained in Morocco to continue their studies. In Algeria, Mounib was now the oldest.\nIt was a turning point. Her father encouraged her interest in politics, answering questions and giving her books. He also invited her to his office, where he received dignitaries. In a patriarchy, a supportive father is the key to a girl's confidence, she says.\nHer world view began to take shape. Mounib embraced socialism as a vehicle for change.\nAfter high school, she studied geology and biology in Morocco, and earned a doctorate in endocrinology at Montpellier University in France.\nAfter her return to Casablanca in the 1980s, she became a university lecturer, eventually rising to the leadership of the regional chapter of the professors' union. She also became active in leftist politics, joining precursors of what eventually became the PSU and the Federation.\nDaughter Dounia says there was no need to preach gender equality in her home because her parents lived it. Her father, 58-year-old Youssef Hajji, who works in insurance, often fixed meals as her mother dashed off to meetings. Some of her girlfriends, even in their upscale Anfa district, would often be asked to serve their brothers, Dounia says.\nHer older sister Imane, 30, also works in insurance, but Dounia caught the political bug. She ran in local elections last year and lost. Now the lanky, confident young woman in aviator glasses is in graduate school, studying political communication.\nHer mother is a role model, even if there's some friction. At one point on the trail, Mounib snaps at Dounia when she criticizes a decision on a social media post. The tension quickly dissipates.\n\"Just the fact that you see this woman being in charge of something this big makes you believe in anything,\" says Dounia. \"You see yourself in her.\"\n___\nA JOLT OF HOPE\nIt's eight days until the election, and Mounib is campaigning in Outat Elhaj, a town of 20,000. Morocco does not allow polling during campaigns, so she has no idea how she is doing.\nIn rural communities like this, where men control the public space, Mounib's presence gives a jolt of hope to women. She steps onto a stage overlooking a market street lined by male-only coffee shops.\nChenna Hadhoum, a 38-year-old municipal clerk, watches from the sidelines. Many women in this community still have to ask their husbands for permission to leave the house, she says. She can come and go freely since her husband is educated and a PSU supporter, but she keeps her head down in public to avoid gossip, taking detours to stay clear of the coffee shops.\nMounib \"gives strength to women because she is capable and equal to a man,\" Hadhoum says.\nAfter the rally, Hadhoum wrestles with her shyness, and then walks up to Mounib and asks for a photo. Later, she waits near the campaign bus to catch another glimpse of Mounib. She says it's been a day she will remember for a long time.\nMounib says she has encountered sexism even in a progressive movement like her own, with a relatively high number of female activists.\n\"Just because we were in the party as women, it does not mean they laid down the red carpet for us,\" she says.\nIn her first year as party leader, she faced repeated challenges, mostly from male colleagues, and at times considered resigning. At one point, they tried to override her decision to consult the rank and file on a key issue, but she stood firm. At another time, they suggested she let one of the ostensibly more experienced men handle media interviews.\nHer standing improved after her first appearance on national media, which gave her higher visibility. She says she is no longer challenged, but the possibility of failure is clearly on her mind. She resolves not to seek re-election as party leader if the Federation does poorly.\n\"If we fail, I'm going to go back and put on my sneakers, and get back to the grassroots,\" she says.\nShe believes it's rare to see men willing to step aside voluntarily.\n\"Men have made so many mistakes, and they have made disastrous decisions, and you still find them in the same positions,\" she says.\nFemale lawmakers in the ruling Islamist party argue that it's been a more effective champion for women's advancement than secular groups, including by getting more women into parliament. Emna Ma Al Ainaine, an Islamist candidate and former high school philosophy teacher, dismisses the Federation as marginal and claims Mounib comes off as elitist.\n\"We had debates,\" she says. \"Me, I am open, I am ready to listen to everyone .... But with Nabila, she believes she has the truth, just her, in Morocco.\"\nDounia says her mother has been skewered on Facebook for owning a pair of expensive sunglasses. And a French publication noted in a recent profile that Mounib drove to the interview in a Volvo.\nCampaign manager Nada Harif says such criticism reflects widespread misogyny.\n\"She will be attacked because she has sunglasses and a good car, to avoid talking about the real subjects,\" Harif says. She adds that Mounib takes the sunglasses off when talking in poorer communities.\n___\nA REBIRTH?\nIt's early on Oct. 8th, and the election results are starting to come in.\nAt first, euphoria erupts at campaign headquarters, because the federation has secured two of 305 seats in district races. An additional 90 seats for women and candidates under 40 are chosen in a national vote, and those results won't be known for a few more hours.\nMounib stands beside Mustapha Chennaoui, the winner in a Casablanca district, who has tears of joy in his eyes. She joins him in a victory chant: \"I'm neither sold nor bought. I'm a leftist and proud!\"\nBut the two seats fall far short of the 10 to 12 Mounib had hoped for.\nAnd a few hours later, she hears on television that the federation did not cross the 3 percent threshold for the national vote. This means she won't get into parliament. The Islamists are once again the largest party in parliament, followed by a pro-monarchy faction.\nMounib takes a few days to deal with the disappointment. She suspects widespread election fraud but cannot prove it.\nA week after the election, she's back at party headquarters. She won't resign from the party, but also — as promised — won't seek re-election as its leader.\nShe hopes Morocco will one day be a parliamentary democracy that celebrates diversity.\n\"I want a Morocco where equality between a man and a woman means that a woman can walk outside in a hijab or in shorts,\" she says, \"and be happy about being a woman.\"",

      "text": "Published November 15, 2016 FoxNews.com Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print This is a RUSH transcript from \"The O'Reilly Factor,\" November 14, 2016. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.\nWatch \"The O'Reilly Factor\" weeknights at 8 p.m. and 11 p.m. ET! \nO'REILLY : Thanks for staying with us, I'm Bill O'Reilly. \"Personal Story\" segment tonight, President Obama held a press conference this afternoon. Here's the highlight.\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) \nOBAMA : But incoming administration doesn't have to put out a huge number of fires. They may want to take the country in a significantly different direction. But then you have time to consider what exactly they want to achieve. And that's a testament to the tremendous work that my team has done over the last eight years.\n(END VIDEO CLIP) \nO'REILLY : Joining us now from Washington, Charles Krauthammer. Do you think Trump is going to feel that way that, hey, you know, the President's handing me off a pretty under controlled situation. I can take my time about doing what I want to do. I mean, that's what Mary Anne and Katie were just saying, well, you know, I don't have to rush into the sanctuary cities. He can do all this Congressional stuff which, of course, will take years. I think Trump's going to go in there and shake it up pretty fast. What say you?\nCHARLES KRAUTHAMMER, SYNDICATED COLUMNIST: Well, I mean Obama is saying, I did such a good job.\nO'REILLY: Yes.\nKRAUTHAMMER: And the country is in such great shape. I'm sure they are going to make a few changes here and there. But, if that's the case, how come his party, he and his party got crushed? This is a man who said, I'm not on the ballot but my legacy is. If you don't go out and support me, I will treat it as a personal insult. Well, he has just been delivered one of the biggest personal insults in the history of American politics. And he is pretending that everything is okay. It's not. And that's the reason his side lost and it's larger -- this is sort of overlooked.\nThere are a lot of reasons Trump's political instincts, of course, Hillary being the worse candidate we have seen in a generation. But I think what's been overlooked is the Obama legacy is really such a disaster that it was very easy for people to reject them. This is no different from 2010 and 2014 when Obama himself was at the top of the ticket. In `08 and 12, he wins because he is a charismatic candidate, a great campaigner. And an attractive guy. But when he runs and he is not on the ticket, he is running on his policies in the midterms and, of course, last week, his side has gotten shellacked each time.\nO'REILLY : Okay. At the beginning of the program and I want to get your opinion on this in the Talking Points, I said that one of the reasons that Trump won was that more than 60 million Americans did not feel included in the Obama administration's policies. And it's ironic because the protesters now going oh, we're afraid that we're not going to have inclusion anymore and they don't even know that half the country wasn't included in the first place. Am I crazy?\nKRAUTHAMMER : No. I think -- look, everybody has their own left and right have different definitions of inclusion. What happened was this huge constituency, the white working class, in particular, the ones who delivered to him the three states, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, and Michigan that put him over the top. Traditionally Democratic. This white working class felt excluded.\nO'REILLY : Yes.\nKRAUTHAMMER : They felt that the Democrats are running a country with favoritism, affirmative action here. Political correctness there. Sort of controlling speech, controlling favors all for minorities, which you can argue was justified in some cases because of historical discrimination, et cetera. But nonetheless, the one constituency in the country that was being economically crushed and kind of socially demoted was the white working class and that was the appeal of Trump. That's how he won. So in a sense, they were excluded in that sense.\nO'REILLY: Yep. That's right.\nKRAUTHAMMER : Not deliberately but by default. Everybody else got promoted and they were left.\nO'REILLY: It was delivered in some of the social issues like late term abortion and things like that. And the ObamaCare mandate that everybody had to follow what they wanted.\nKRAUTHAMMER : And also in a very aggressive secularism that marginalized and squeezed and con descended to the ledge just folks.\nO'REILLY: Mocked them even.\nKRAUTHAMMER : Who were also the ones. I mean, if you look at the one characteristic that divides -- that divides Democrats from Republicans, it's church attendance. That's the easiest way to divide them.\nO'REILLY : All right. I'm glad you agree with me finally on this exclusionary stuff, because I really felt that was an important memo. Thank you, Charles.\nKRAUTHAMMER : Look, over time, you will event actually stumble on the truth, and it just happened again this week.\nContent and Programming Copyright 2016 Fox News Network, LLC.

      "text": "FBI using Twitter's raw 'firehose' data to monitor users With Dataminr, the bureau has \"near real-time\" access to live tweets. Save AP Photo/Patrick Semansky \nThe FBI is using a Twitter tool called Dataminr to track criminals and terrorist groups, according to documents spotted by The Verge . In a contract document, the agency says Dataminr's Advanced Alerting Tool allows it \"to search the complete Twitter firehose, in near real-time, using customizable filters.\" However, the practice seems to violate Twitter's developer agreement, which prohibits the use of its data feed for surveillance or spying purposes. \nIt's not clear if Twitter has authorized the bureau to access Dataminr, but Engadget has reached out for comment. It cut off another company, Geofeedia , for using its raw feed to track users in a similar way. However, Twitter has a closer relationship with Dataminr; it owns five percent of the firm and has given it a virtual monopoly on its data feed. As the FBI points out in a \"limited source justification\" document, \"Dataminr is the only certified Official Twitter Data Partner with direct proprietary access to the full 'Twitter firehose' which allows it to provide near real-time alerts of breaking news and events.\" \nUS intelligence owns a venture capital firm called In-Q-Tel that invested in Dataminr and other social media analytics firms. Twitter reportedly authorized a pilot program that let the CIA and other agencies scan users, but cut access off after it ended. Like Apple, Google and other US tech companies, it wanted to avoid being associated with spying on both foreign and domestic users, according to the WSJ . \nDataminr is the only certified Official Twitter Data Partner with direct proprietary access to the full 'Twitter firehose' which allows it to provide near real-time alerts of breaking news and events. \nDuring his campaign, President-elect Donald Trump promised to force social media companies to give law enforcement the encryption keys needed to access to private user data. US tech companies, especially Apple, have argued vociferously against that, saying it would undermine confidence in their platforms. Foreign regions like Europe are especially sensitive to US spying after discovering that the NSA used server back doors and other tricks to spy on its citizens ( and leaders ). \nIt's not far-fetched for entire nations to ban a social network, as Russia cut off 5 million LinkedIn users just last week. And the European Union is increasingly wary of Facebook, Google and other US tech firms.",

Post to Facebook Twitter says it's cracking down on hate speech The effort comes as one watchdog says hate speech on Twitter is 'out of control.'  //usat.ly/2fVq4KC   Join the Nation's Conversation To   Twitter says it's cracking down on hate speech Jessica Guynn , USA TODAY 9:04   Twitter headquarters in San Francisco (Photo: Josh Edelson, AFP/Getty Images) \nSAN FRANCISCO — With public backlash growing, Twitter says it's taking steps to crack down on hate speech, from making it easier to report alleged incidents on the social media service to educating moderators on what kind of conduct violates the rules. \nTwitter users will also gain more control over their experience on Twitter with the ability to mute words and phrases, even entire conversations, if they don't want to receive notifications about them, said Del Harvey, Twitter's head of safety. \nThe effort comes as an uptick in biased graffiti, assaults and other incidents have been reported in the news and on social media since Election Day, prompting president-elect Donald Trump to call for people to \"stop it\" during a 60 Minutes interview on Sunday night. The FBI reports that hate crimes rose 7% in 2015, led by attacks on Muslim Americans. \nIt's also in response to escalating concern about abuse and harassment on Twitter that has stalled growth among users and advertisers alike. \nUnder chief executive Jack Dorsey, Twitter has pledged that \"trust and safety\" is among its top priorities. Earlier this year, the company improved its abuse reporting system and convened outside advisers on safety issues. \nYet little has changed. Watchdog groups say Twitter has for years failed to provide effective tools for its 317 million users to combat abuse, causing hate speech to spread on the platform. \n\"Hate speech is out of control on Twitter,\" said Heidi Beirich, spokeswoman for the Southern Poverty Law Center. Jack Dorsey hasn't fixed the trouble with Twitter \nIn one of the highest-profile incidents, Twitter banned Milo Yiannopoulos, a technology editor at the conservative news site Breitbart , in July for engaging in a campaign of abuse in which hundreds of anonymous Twitter accounts bombarded Ghostbuster actress Leslie Jones with racist and sexist taunts. \nA report in October from The Anti-Defamation League documented the rise in anti-Semitic tweets targeting journalists who covered Trump, the Republican presidential candidate. Words that appear frequently in the profiles of these Twitter accounts: Trump, nationalist, conservative, white. \nAfter the election, the neo-Nazi website The Daily Stormer published a list of more than 50 Twitter users who had expressed fear about the outcome of the 2016 election, urging its readers to \"punish\" them with a barrage of tweets that would drive them to suicide. \nJennifer Soto Segundo, a Clinton supporter in Orlando, Fla., says she expressed her dismay at Hillary Clinton's loss on Twitter, only to be greeted the next day by violent tweets — one from a user urging her to step into a gas chamber and another calling for her deportation. \n\"We are nothing but frustrated with Twitter,\" Beirich said. \"I am glad they're putting out new policies but, given their past history, there's not a lot to make me hopeful about Twitter unfortunately.\" 'Massive rise' in hate speech on Twitter during presidential election \nHarvey, who has run safety at Twitter for eight years, says she's had a \"front row seat\" for the evolution of abuse and harassment on the social media service. \nWith the latest updates to its policies and features, Twitter is attempting to preserve free speech while drawing a hard line at \"behavior that is intended to silence others,\" Harvey said. \n\"While we have taken steps over the years to try to combat abuse and harassment, we haven't moved as quickly as we would have liked or we haven't always done as much as we would have liked because we have tried to make sure we are not making decisions that have unintended, negative consequences and ramifications,\" she said. White supremacists urge trolling Clinton supporters to suicide \nHOW IT WORKS \nFirst, Twitter users will now be able to report \"hateful conduct\" as a separate option. \"Our hope is by having it as an explicit reporting option, it will make it easier for people to flag it to us and for us to take action on it as we can,\" Harvey said. \nSeparately, reporting hateful conduct will also help Twitter better process reports from bystanders, alleviating the burden on the person being subjected to the abuse, Harvey said. \nSecond, Twitter has retrained support teams, offering sessions that teach the cultural and historical context to help moderators recognize hate speech, and has put in place an ongoing program to refresh employees on abuse and update them on new forms of it, Harvey said. \n\"As we looked at the instances were were missing...one consistent theme has been: This is something where the person reviewing the report just didn't have the framework or the background to understand what it was referencing,\" she said. \"So in order to address that, we actually developed really tailored resources to provide historical, cultural contextualization, for a lot of the common themes or phrases or terms that we were seeing and that we were seeing people not recognize.\" \nIn addition, Twitter is making changes to notifications, allowing users to mute words, phrases, emojis, even entire conversations, because, Harvey says, abuse \"is acutely felt in notifications.\" Eventually, Twitter will expand the mute function to everywhere users see tweets. Twitter already allows users to mute accounts they don't want to see tweets from. \n\"Just to be clear: We are not saying by any means that as soon as this launches, the abuse issue will be solved on Twitter or that we are never going to get anything wrong again,' Harvey said. \"This is sort of just another step for us on this path but we do think it's a really important one for people to have the ability to control the experience and shape it more.\" \nBelow is an edited Q&A with Harvey. \nQ: Have you seen the volume of hate speech increase during the Trump candidacy? \nA: The thing is that Twitter, there's just a lot of tweets on Twitter. It would be difficult to have any sort of measurement of it. The thing that we keep coming back to is that numbers don't matter, in that if there is the perception that there is an increase or if people feel like they are being subjected to more, that's something we have to fix no matter what. \nQ: The Anti-Defamation League documented a rise of anti-semitism against journalists on Twitter. Are you saying that you don't have the ability to measure that? \nA: I am saying that there are a whole bunch of different ways that you can measure these things and there's no one agreed upon way. I don't think we would feel we had succeeded just because we had some number go down. People have to feel safe and people have to feel like they have recourse available to them if they are being abused. That's what we have to try for. What we are trying to look at is how we can make sure that people know what is available to them and how they can make their experience the way they want it to be. \nQ: Have you measured it? \nA: What would you measure exactly? Because not all uses of a word are negative. We see a tremendous amount of counter speech on these concepts. We certainly look at volumes. We certainly look at trends. The data that's there has not actually been something that has been clear enough for us to use, as compared to, let's look at behavior, let's look at the actual words that you use. \nQ: We noticed on election day that accounts people flagged that were trying to keep immigrants and people of color away from the polls were being suspended very quickly. Was there a special effort on election day? \nA: We absolutely did do some work around combating some voter suppression type stuff that was happening, sure. And that's certainly an aspect of the work we have been doing. This is an ongoing effort. It's not as though, with the election now over, we're done, or it won't be a continued focus. This is an ongoing challenge and it's one we are going to keep pushing on. \nQ: How do you deal with the presence, influence and increased activity of the alt right? \nA: Honestly the way we are trying to address these challenges isn't specific to any group. If someone is engaged in behavior that violates our rules, around abuse and harassment or around hateful conduct, we're going to take action on them. That's independent of political affiliation or belief or anything else. Twitter, as you know, is a worldwide platform and there are challenges like this around the world in all sorts of forms. None of it is unique to any one party. CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE",

      "text": "Facebook, Google, and Twitter urge Trump to support encryption and immigration reform Internet Association outlines policy positions in a letter to the president-elect share Spencer Platt/Getty Images \nA group of tech companies including Facebook, Google, and Twitter has called on President-elect Donald Trump to protect encryption, reform immigration policy, and curtail surveillance during his administration. The Internet Association, whose members also include Uber, Amazon, and Netflix, outlined its policy positions in a letter published on Monday. \nTech executives have been wary and sometimes openly critical of Trump, in part due to the president-elect's divisive campaign rhetoric and positions on immigration and encryption. In June, more than 100 Silicon Valley leaders said in a letter that a Trump presidency would be a \" disaster for innovation .\" The letter released Monday strikes a more optimistic tone. \n\"The internet industry looks forward to engaging in an open and productive dialogue,\" the letter reads. \n\"Support for strong encryption makes America more secure.\" \nDuring the Republican primary, Trump called for a boycott of Apple products after the company refused an FBI order to unlock an iPhone that belonged to one of the San Bernardino shooters. He dismissed the company's argument that unlocking the phone would threaten the privacy and security of all iPhone users, saying in a February interview: \"Who do they think they are?\" The Internet Association hopes he'll reconsider. \n\"Laws that require companies to engineer vulnerabilities into products and services harm personal privacy and endanger national security,\" the letter reads. \"Support for strong encryption makes America more secure.\" \nThe letter also calls on Trump to support net neutrality and implement stronger reforms on government surveillance programs. Trump has been critical of net neutrality in the past, and his transition team includes two prominent defenders of the National Security Agency (NSA). But he may be more sympathetic to some of the Internet Association's other policy priorities, including its calls to ease regulation of the sharing economy and lower regulatory barriers in Europe. \nOn immigration, the Internet Association wants Trump to \"expand and improve the green card program,\" and to create a green card system for science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) graduates. Trump built much of his candidacy around a hardline anti-immigration position, and although his position on expanding the H1-B visa program for skilled workers remains vague , there are concerns that the program could be curtailed under his administration. \nYou can read the Internet Association's full letter and list of policy priorities here .",

      "text": "What to expect in 2017, according to Twitter What to expect in 2017, according to Twitter Social Cues: Trends on social media include the sexiest man alive and yet another viral challenge. What to expect in 2017, according to Twitter 0 Share: \nHere's a headline you can probably expect to see in 2017. Photo by Screenshot via The Simpsons \nThe unpredictability of 2016 means all bets are off for 2017. Twitter users have created a hashtag to predict next year's news. The results are pretty wild. \nMeanwhile, Facebook users are conquering a new challenge. The mannequin challenge is so last week. \nSocial Cues is our guide to what people are talking about on Facebook and Twitter. Here's what is trending on social media this Tuesday: \n#HeadlinesFor2017 : People are already looking toward the new year. Let's face it, 2016 has had its share of downers. With the deaths of icons like David Bowie , Prince and Harambe , 2016 can't end sooner. Twitter has some ideas about what's ahead. The hashtag predicts California's secession , a memorial for Harambe and everyone's nightmare scenario: 2016 repeating itself . What are your #Headlinesfor2017? \n#SexiestManAlive : Despite my constant lobbying, I did not win the prestigious title (again). This year the honor went to Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson , who, I must admit, is a worthy opponent. The accolade comes atop Johnson's status as the highest paid actor in the world . You apparently can have it all. \n#UNameItChallenge : Another week, another viral challenge. The food-themed dance challenge comes just in time for Thanksgiving. The \"song\" is a remix of gospel singer Shirley Caesar listing off all the food she's making for Thanksgiving -- you name it, she's got it. Facebook users have taken on the challenge with their own videos of the catchy tune, mashing it up with videos of Beyonce or making their own versions. Even R&B superstar Chris Brown jumped in on the fun on Instagram . \n#BlackBarbies : Rapper Nicki Minaj dropped a surprise track on Tuesday in a remix to Rae Sremmurd 's \"Black Beatles.\" Sremmurd's track is already topping charts thanks to the Mannequin Challenge . Her fans on Twitter quickly helped the song become the top trending topic there with more than 12,000 tweets shortly after its release. \nRudy Giuliani : We almost made it through a full Social Cues without referencing politics. Former New York mayor and Donald Trump advocate Rudy Giuliani is rumored to be the president-elect's choice for secretary of state . More than 99,000 people were talking about Giuliani on Facebook in the hour since the news started trending Tuesday . \nBe sure to check out Social Cues' weekly roundup called T.GIF.

      "text": " 00AM from the fixing-things dept. With public backlash growing, Twitter says it's taking steps to crack down on hate speech , from making it easier to report alleged incidents on the social media service to educating moderators on what kind of conduct violates the rules. From a report on USA Today: Twitter users will also gain more control over their experience on Twitter with the ability to mute words and phrases, even entire conversations, if they don't want to receive notifications about them, said Del Harvey, Twitter's head of safety. The effort comes as an uptick in biased graffiti, assaults and other incidents have been reported in the news and on social media since Election Day, prompting president-elect Donald Trump to call for people to \"stop it\" during a 60 Minutes interview on Sunday night. The FBI reports that hate crimes rose 7% in 2015, led by attacks on Muslim Americans.",

      "text": "Twitter rolls out tool to curb online abuse, bullying November 15, 2016 tweet Twitter Twitter on Tuesday said it was rolling out a new tool to help users filter out harassment and abusive conduct on the messaging platform. “The amount of abuse, bullying, and harassment we’ve seen across the internet has risen sharply over the past few years,” Twitter said in a statement. “These behaviors inhibit people from participating on Twitter, or anywhere. Abusive conduct removes the chance to see and share all perspectives around an issue, which we believe is critical to moving us all forward. In the worst cases, this type of conduct threatens human dignity, which we should all stand together to protect.” The new tool expands a “mute” feature that enables users to block accounts sending inappropriate messages. “Now we’re expanding mute to where people need it the most: in notifications,” the statement said. “We’re enabling you to mute keywords, phrases, and even entire conversations you don’t want to see notifications about, rolling out to everyone in the coming days. This is a feature we’ve heard many of you ask for, and we’re going to keep listening to make it better and more comprehensive over time.” The move comes after a series of complaints and high-profile instances of abuse on the social network. In July, “Ghostbusters” star Leslie Jones briefly quit Twitter after what she claimed was a stream of abuse fueled by comments from an editor at the conservative news site Breitbart. The rise in online vitriol has forced social networks to balance questions of harassment with freedom of expression. Twitter’s statement said that the platform is “open to everyone and every opinion” while noting that “we’ve seen a growing trend of people taking advantage of that openness and using Twitter to be abusive to others.” The statement added: “We don’t expect these announcements to suddenly remove abusive conduct from Twitter. No single action by us would do that. Instead we commit to rapidly improving Twitter based on everything we observe and learn.” AFP",

Richard Drew | AP 2013 \nTwitter, long criticized as a hotbed for online harassment, is expanding ways to curb the amount of abuse users see and making it easier to report such conduct. \nTwitter says it is expanding a \"mute\" function that lets users mute accounts they don't want to see tweets from. Now, users will be able to mute keywords, phrases and conversations they don't want to get notifications about. Users who decide to mute things won't see them. \nBut these words, phrases and conversations will continue to exist on Twitter, and anyone who doesn't mute it will continue to see it. \nBut Twitter Inc. said Tuesday it is also making it easier to report hateful conduct. It says also re-trained its support teams about its policies and hateful conduct. \nThe news on your schedule from MPR News Update Email Address* MPR News Update AM Edition MPR News Update PM Edition \nSee our Privacy Policy .

      "text": "Twitter rolls out tool to curb online abuse, bullying \n  10:09 AM Tweet \nWASHINGTON, United States (AFP) — Twitter on Tuesday said it was rolling out a new tool to help users filter out harassment and abusive conduct on the messaging platform. \n\"The amount of abuse, bullying, and harassment we've seen across the internet has risen sharply over the past few years,\" Twitter said in a statement. \n\"These behaviours inhibit people from participating on Twitter, or anywhere. Abusive conduct removes the chance to see and share all perspectives around an issue, which we believe is critical to moving us all forward. In the worst cases, this type of conduct threatens human dignity, which we should all stand together to protect.\" \nThe new tool expands a \"mute\" feature that enables users to block accounts sending inappropriate messages. \n\"Now we're expanding mute to where people need it the most: in notifications,\" the statement said. \n\"We're enabling you to mute keywords, phrases, and even entire conversations you don't want to see notifications about, rolling out to everyone in the coming days. This is a feature we've heard many of you ask for, and we're going to keep listening to make it better and more comprehensive over time\". \nThe move comes after a series of complaints and high-profile instances of abuse on the social network. \nIn July, \"Ghostbusters\" star Leslie Jones briefly quit Twitter after what she claimed was a stream of abuse fuelled by comments from an editor at the conservative news site Breitbart. \nThe rise in online vitriol has forced social networks to balance questions of harassment with freedom of expression. \nTwitter's statement said that the platform is \"open to everyone and every opinion\" while noting that \"we've seen a growing trend of people taking advantage of that openness and using Twitter to be abusive to others\". \nThe statement added: \"We don't expect these announcements to suddenly remove abusive conduct from Twitter. No single action by us would do that. Instead we commit to rapidly improving Twitter based on everything we observe and learn\". ADVERTISEMENT",

      "title": "Twitter is finally taking abuse seriously",
      "text": "By Kristen V. Brown \nOver the years, Twitter has become the unfortunate example of what happens on the internet when you govern your territory like the Wild West. On Twitter, the least civil parts of society not only persist, but flourish. There, even unassuming punctuation marks are just waiting to evolve into viral racial epithets. \nBut a set of new features may go a long way toward fighting the network’s ever-evolving abuse. On Tuesday, the company officially unveiled a new set of tools that will allow users to mute specific words and phases from appearing in notifications, as well as entire conversations. Eventually the feature will expand beyond just notifications, meaning users won’t see certain tweets at all if they don’t want to. Twitter \n“The forms that abuse can take can vary tremendously,” said Del Harvey, Twitter’s VP of Trust and Safety. “Sometimes exactly the same phrase can be abusive between two people and not abusive between two others. There’s all these layers of meaning and intent. Plus there’s your own sensitivities.” \nThis new muting feature is similar to one Instagram released earlier this year. It is an excellent strategy that approaches thoughtfully the balance of safety and freedom of expression. Allowing users to decide for themselves what kind of commentary is taking it too far ensures that when one user expresses a view that may be hurtful to another, other users don’t have to suffer the effects. Twitter gets to avoid making strict, blanket rules for what kind of speech is acceptable and allows for its internet harassment targeting strategies to adapt at the speed of internet trolls. \nThe company seems to be trending toward a strategy that allows individual users to set more and more rules for themselves. In August, Twitter introduced a quality filter, along with a setting to allow users to limit who they receive notifications from. \nOver the past two years, Twitter has taken many steps to curb harassment: It has banned revenge porn , issued new anti-harassment rules , established a trust and safety council , and de-verified high-profile users that it considers abusive. But those efforts seem to have not worked very well. Of 1,600 Twitter accounts that have sent out thousands of anti-Semitic tweets targeted at journalists over the past year, Twitter suspended just 21% of them, according to a recent Anti-Defamation League report. Frequently, users report that even threats of death and rape—clear violations of Twitter’s policies—are met with inaction. \n“You know when you see that tweet going around that says ‘Really Twitter, this wasn’t a violation of your rules?’ with a screenshot of a tweet?,” said Harvey. “Usually we look and say, ‘Yep, that’s definitely a violation of our rules.’ All of that doesn’t really do us any good, if we’re not catching the conduct that’s actually abusive.” \nThe company also hopes to bolster the ability of its own moderators to respond appropriately to troublesome content. So Twitter has created a new option to report hateful conduct, as well as undertaking a retraining of its staff to help those reviewing flagged content to understand historical and cultural context. \nForthcoming, Harvey said, are tools that will allow Twitter to more easily identify repeat offenders and those trying to get around suspensions through strategies such as creating duplicate accounts. \nThe big realization here, Harvey told me, is that empowering the user may go the farthest in curbing abuse, something Twitter’s critics have long argued for. \n“It is unrealistic that we will be able to predict everything people will consider harassing, every way that they will want their experience to be,” Harvey told me. “The more we can put tools in the hands of users to manage their own experience, the better.” \nThe necessary tradeoff is that such strategies risk turning Twitter into even more of a self-censored bubble. \nBut when I asked Harvey about how free speech advocates might respond to their new muting tools, she dismissed the concerns. \n“Frankly one of the things I’ve come to realize over the years is I am probably striking the right balance if no one is happy with me,” she said. \nOn Nov. 15, we’re discussing strategies like this that actually might help make the internet a nicer place at the Real Future Fair in Oakland.

(Photo: Richard Drew / AP) \nNew York — Twitter, long criticized as a hotbed for online harassment, is expanding ways to curb the amount of abuse users see and making it easier to report such conduct. \nTwitter says it is expanding a “mute” function that lets users mute accounts they don’t want to see tweets from. Now, users will be able to mute keywords, phrases and conversations they don’t want to get notifications about. Users who decide to mute things won’t see them. \nBut these words, phrases and conversations will continue to exist on Twitter, and anyone who doesn’t mute it will continue to see it. But Twitter Inc. said Tuesday it is also making it easier to report hateful conduct. It says also re-trained its support teams about its policies and hateful conduct. \n //detne.ws/2fujqfW TOP VIDEOS",

      "text": "Donald Trump just lashed out on Twitter over criticisms that he lost the popular vote 9:24 a.m. ET \nIt's been nearly a full week since Donald Trump was officially declared America's president-elect. But he wants America to know he could have \"won even bigger and more easily.\" \nIn a tweet Tuesday morning, Trump argued that he would've paid more attention to reliably blue states like New York, Florida, and California if the election weren't based on the Electoral College. Trump won the Electoral College 290-232, with Michigan's 16 electoral votes still in play, but lost the popular vote to Hillary Clinton by roughly 800,000 votes and counting . Clinton's popular vote victory has prompted millions of her supporters to demand that she be awarded the presidency, despite America's longstanding Electoral College rules. If the election were based on total popular vote I would have campaigned in N.Y. Florida and California and won even bigger and more easily \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 15, 2016 \nWhile Trump repeatedly railed on America's \"rigged\" electoral system ahead of Election Day, he indicated Tuesday that he's since rethought things. As it turns out, the Electoral College system he once called \"a disaster for a democracy\" is what he has to thank for his White House win. Becca Stanek The Electoral College is actually genius in that it brings all states, including the smaller ones, into play. Campaigning is much different! Justin Sullivan/Getty Images \nDonald Trump has never held a public office, but that hasn't exactly shaken his confidence that he will make a great president. Trump's close allies, though, are apparently feeling a little less sure that their outsider status will make them good at running the country. \nRetired neurosurgeon Ben Carson originally had his eyes on the Oval Office, running against Donald Trump in the Republican primary. After that failed to pan out, Carson came on as a close Trump ally and appeared to be in a position to get his pick of an office in the incoming administration. Nevertheless, Carson reportedly won't be joining the new administration, his close friend Armstrong Williams told The Hill . \n\"Dr. Carson feels he has no government experience, he's never run a federal agency,\" Williams said. \"The last thing he would want to do was take a position that could cripple the presidency.\" \nCarson had been rumored for secretary of education , and Williams reports the position of health secretary was floated as well. \"Dr. Carson was never offered a specific position, but everything was open to him,\" Williams explained. Carson has already reportedly told Trump that he isn't interested. \nThat doesn't mean Carson plans to stay uninvolved entirely: Williams said the former neurosurgeon may continue to help out a Trump administration as an unofficial adviser. Jeva Lange \nFormer Bush official warns diplomats to stay away from Trump's 'angry, arrogant' transition 11:05 a.m. ET \nA former counselor to the Department of State under former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice posted an ominous warning Tuesday about President-elect Donald Trump's transition team. Eliot A. Cohen, now a professor at Johns Hopkins University, indicated in a tweet Tuesday morning that he'd changed his mind about possibly giving Team Trump a chance; citing a bad \"exchange\" of sorts with the president-elect's transition team, Cohen advised everyone to run far, far away: After exchange w Trump transition team, changed my recommendation: stay away. They're angry, arrogant, screaming \"you LOST!\" Will be ugly. \n— Eliot A Cohen (@EliotACohen) November 15, 2016 \nThough Cohen was a big player in rallying Republicans against Trump, he wrote in an encouraging article for The American Interest after Election Day that Trump might \"not be as awful as we think.\" In the article published Nov. 10, Cohen did not discourage his \"younger friends\" from turning down government jobs so long as they said \"yes out of a sense of duty rather than mere careerism.\" \nIt seems that a mere five days later, Cohen has already lost faith. Becca Stanek iStock \nCongratulations, New York: You are officially every frequent flyer's worst enemy. The New York City area's three main airports — ­JFK, ­LaGuardia, and ­Newark — were ranked the worst among the nation's 30 busiest flight hubs, according to travel website ThePointsGuy​.com. The airports scored badly in terms of timeliness, accessibility, and amenities. LaGuardia came in dead last thanks to frequent flight cancellations, the second longest drive time among those ranked, and \"extortionate\" parking prices ($29 a day or higher), TIME reports. JFK had the longest drive time (over an hour from downtown) and the longest security lines (17 minutes on average). Newark was simply \"lackluster\" across the board. \nPhoenix's airport was rated number one, earning its stripes for reliability, food, light-rail access, and free Wi-Fi.

Kelly Gonsalves \nMorning Joe 's Joe Scarborough tears into Rudy Giuliani: 'He is way out of control' 10:16 a.m. ET \nFormer New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani's latest remarks left Morning Joe co-host Joe Scarborough wondering whether he could actually handle the role of secretary of state, should President-elect Donald Trump tap him for the nation's highest diplomatic post as has been rumored. \"What is he doing?\" Scarborough said during Tuesday's episode of Morning Joe , after playing a clip of Giuliani's appearance Monday at The Wall Street Journal 's CEO Council in Washington, D.C. \"He's way out of control,\" he added. \nIn the sit-down, Giuliani publicly breathed a sigh of relief that he would not be attorney general and thus wouldn't have to deal with decisions about, say, big mergers. \"I can escape that one,\" Giuliani said, making it clear he passed on the the job. He then proceeded to angle for a spot as Trump's secretary of state. \"You know, he's a little over his skis,\" Scarborough said. \"I think he thinks he won the election and not Donald Trump.\" \nFurthermore, Scarborough said, Giuliani's \"blabbering\" about who Trump will probably select as attorney general and \"about what's going on inside these very serious deliberations\" brings his fitness for the role of secretary of state into question. \"That's not a guy you want to go on a delicate mission to South Korea talking about North Korea,\" Scarborough said, noting that a president wants a secretary of state that \"knows his place.\" \nWatch the Morning Joe panel critique Giuliani's conduct below.

Bloomberg reported Tuesday that former House Intelligence Committee Chairman Mike Rogers left the team Tuesday morning in an \"abrupt departure\" that apparently \"came at the request of team officials.\" The former Michigan congressman had been selected to serve as the transition team's national security adviser. \n\"It was a privilege to prepare and advise the policy, personnel, and agency action teams on all aspects of the national security portfolio during the initial pre-election planning phase,\" Rogers said , per the Washington Examiner . \"Our work will provide a strong foundation for the new transition team leadership as they move into the post-election phase, which is naturally incorporating the campaign team in New York.\" \nRogers will pass off his work to Vice President-elect Mike Pence, who replaced New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie as the head of Trump's transition team last week. The Washington Examiner noted Rogers' departure comes amid reports about \"tensions on the Trump transition team.\" Becca Stanek \nRudy Giuliani dismisses anti-Trump protesters as 'goons and thugs' 9:23 a.m. ET \nFormer New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani appeared at The Wall Street Journal 's CEO Council in Washington, D.C., on Monday, set to offer his perspective on American leadership and how the U.S.'s role in the world will evolve under Donald Trump. During his talk, however, the former mayor and vice chair of President-elect Trump's transition team segued into a discussion on domestic policy, particularly Trump's plans for the African-American community. \n\"They have a president of the United States that not only doesn't have a prejudiced bone in his body … but who [also] has a real commitment to trying to help the African-American community,\" Giuliani said of Trump. He then began lambasting cities that have \"deteriorated under Democrats\" before an audience member who had apparently initially questioned Giuliani interjected to demand an answer to her actual query, about Trump's response to the hate crimes and harassment of minorities being perpetuated in his name . \nWhile the panel moderator mentioned that Trump had directly condemned the incidents in an interview with 60 Minutes that aired Sunday night, Giuliani went a step further to compare Trump's lack of influence over any supporters wreaking havoc to President Obama and Hillary Clinton's responsibility for the \"goons and thugs\" taking to the streets to protest Trump's election: Rudy Giuliani on anti-Trump demonstrators: \"goons and thugs\" https://t.co/LBQEPRkoqW #WSJCEOCouncil pic.twitter.com/JhTPAqIuBd \n— Wall Street Journal (@WSJ) November 15, 2016 \nGiuliani was mayor of New York City from 1994 to 2001, a period during which crime dropped dramatically in the city — but which also saw the birth of controversial policing policies like stop-and-frisk, which disproportionately targeted minorities . Kimberly Alters \nMegyn Kelly says her 5-year-old daughter is afraid of Donald Trump 8:23 a.m. ET \nFox News host Megyn Kelly says one of the \"lowest points\" of her year was when her 5-year-old daughter asked her what a \"bimbo\" was. Donald Trump, then still a candidate for president, had reposted a tweet in which Kelly was called a \"bimbo\" and also published a tweet himself insisting that he would not \"call Megyn Kelly a bimbo because that would not be politically correct.\" \nTrump's tweeting followed the first Republican presidential primary debate, during which Kelly hit Trump with a tough question about his lewd remarks about women. Kelly said her daughter attended the debate. \"That's when she told me she was afraid of Donald Trump,\" Kelly said. \"I had never revealed to her any of the things that Trump had done. But she is five, and she hears things in this world.\" \nThis was one of the many challenges Kelly said she faced during the election as Trump came after her \"like a dog with a bone.\" \"It was a test of me as a person and a professional,\" Kelly said, noting that Trump caused \"security issues in my life and the life of my family.\" \nBut, Kelly said, she made it through and she learned something important about America's next president along the way. \"My own experience with him proves he's able to let things go if he so chooses,\" Kelly said, referencing their conciliatory meeting at Trump Tower after months of feuding. However, she noted, she didn't apologize at that meeting — \"nor did he apologize to me.\" \nYou can catch Kelly talk about how the election affected her daughter below.

      "text": "Twitter rolls out tool to curb online abuse, bullying November 15, 2016 Twitter says that the platform is \"open to everyone and every opinion\" while noting that it has seen \"a growing trend of people taking advantage of that openness and using Twitter to be abusive to others.\" \nTwitter on Tuesday said it was rolling out a new tool to help users filter out harassment and abusive conduct on the messaging platform. \n\"The amount of abuse, bullying, and harassment we've seen across the internet has risen sharply over the past few years,\" Twitter said in a statement. \n\"These behaviors inhibit people from participating on Twitter, or anywhere. Abusive conduct removes the chance to see and share all perspectives around an issue, which we believe is critical to moving us all forward. In the worst cases, this type of conduct threatens human dignity, which we should all stand together to protect.\" \nThe new tool expands a \"mute\" feature that enables users to block accounts sending inappropriate messages. \n\"Now we're expanding mute to where people need it the most: in notifications,\" the statement said. \n\"We're enabling you to mute keywords, phrases, and even entire conversations you don't want to see notifications about, rolling out to everyone in the coming days. This is a feature we've heard many of you ask for, and we're going to keep listening to make it better and more comprehensive over time.\" \nThe move comes after a series of complaints and high-profile instances of abuse on the social network. \nIn July, \"Ghostbusters\" star Leslie Jones briefly quit Twitter after what she claimed was a stream of abuse fueled by comments from an editor at the conservative news site Breitbart. \nThe rise in online vitriol has forced social networks to balance questions of harassment with freedom of expression. \nTwitter's statement said that the platform is \"open to everyone and every opinion\" while noting that \"we've seen a growing trend of people taking advantage of that openness and using Twitter to be abusive to others.\" \nThe statement added: \"We don't expect these announcements to suddenly remove abusive conduct from Twitter. No single action by us would do that. Instead we commit to rapidly improving Twitter based on everything we observe and learn.\" Twitter unveils features to filter tweets, notifications August 19, 2016 \nTwitter has announced two new settings that will allow users to control what they see in their feeds and what notifications they receive. Twitter acts to curb 'abusive,' 'hateful' content December 29, 2015 \nTwitter said Tuesday it was taking new steps to stem \"abusive behavior and hateful conduct\" on the global messaging platform. Twitter adding mute button for unwanted posts May 12, 2014 \nTwitter on Monday began letting users 'mute' posts from people they are not interested in hearing from at the popular one-to-many messaging service. Instagram lets users filter offensive comments September 12, 2016 \nInstagram on Monday began letting users tackle online abuse by creating lists of words that would have comments hidden from sight at the popular photo and video-sharing service. December 2, 2014 \nTwitter is trying to make it easier for victims and witnesses of online harassment to report it. Twitter moves to stem violent threats, abuse April 21, 2015 \nTwitter on Tuesday began implementing a new policy aimed at curbing use of the social network to incite violence, and to crack down on abuse and harassment on the service.

Now, users will be able to mute keywords, phrases and conversations they don't want to get notifications about. Users who decide to mute things won't see them. \nThe words, phrases and conversations will continue to exist on Twitter, and anyone who doesn't mute them will continue to see them. But the company is also making it easier to report hateful conduct, and said it has re-trained its support teams about its policies and hateful conduct. \nAbuse can easily spread on Twitter due to its public, real-time nature, where tweets are easily amplified by retweets and users can easily and openly attack others. While Twitter prohibits \"specific conduct that targets people on the basis of race, ethnicity, national origin, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, religious affiliation, age, disability, or disease,\" this policy has not been enough to stomp out abuse. \nNot even celebrities are immune.

Unable to look within the corrupt machinations of their own party to search out blame, their sights are set outward. Besides Trump voters themselves, Clinton supporters are attacking third-party backers for handing Clinton a loss in a particularly tight election. The problem with this thinking is that it is simply not true.\nIt is true Libertarian nominee Gary Johnson and Green Party nominee Jill Stein awarded their respective parties with the best showings either notched. Johnson got over 4 million votes and Stein received over 1 million, which comes out to 3 percent of the popular vote going to Johnson and 1 percent going to Stein.

Now, users will be able to mute keywords, phrases and conversations they don't want to get notifications about. Users who decide to mute things won't see them. \nBut these words, phrases and conversations will continue to exist on Twitter, and anyone who doesn't mute it will continue to see it. But Twitter Inc. said Tuesday it is also making it easier to report hateful conduct. It says also re-trained its support teams about its policies and hateful conduct. More Headlines",

      "text": "\nOne of Twitter’s biggest problems has been the inability to counter the constant harassment that happens on its platform. Online harassment is not news in social media sites, but Twitter has been found consistently not to provide people with tools that allow people to filter out these offenders effectively.\nTo Twitter’s credit, we have tools that help us combat harassment on the platform and these are the mute and block buttons. They have helped users to a degree in weeding out the offenders but it is still not enough still. That is why Twitter today announced changes that will help you have more control over the content in your profile.\nThe first big change is on the mute button. Currently on the official apps and website, you are able to mute a person but now you will be able to do more. Twitter will extend that functionality into notifications so that you will be able to mute practically anything; from keywords to phrases and also entire conversations. Twitter improved on the block button’s functionality a while ago and it was only a matter of time they expanded the mute button’s functionality too.\nThe next step is a move by the company to stem out abuse according to the various categories of people on Twitter. The company will now allow you to report such abuse directly, either for yourself or for another person so that it they will be able to process the request faster.\nThe final move is on Twitter’s side that deals with the enforcement of these guidelines. “We’ve retrained all of our support teams on our policies, including special sessions on cultural and historical contextualization of hateful conduct, and implemented an ongoing refresher program,” the company explained on the blog. Also, they have improved their internal tools and systems in order to deal effectively when they receive reports.\nThe company says that features like the expanded functionality of the mute button will be rolled out to everyone in the coming days. They also iterated that we shouldn’t expect these announcements to have a instant impact to remove abusive conduct from the platform, but it is commendable they are working on improving on one of their biggest problems right now.\nRead On Web → Twitter Is Boosting Its Filtering Tools To Curb Abuse \n",

      "text": "Twitter adds new options to curb abuse, harassment Posted: By BARBARA ORTUTAYAP Technology Writer \nNEW YORK (AP) - Twitter, long criticized as a hotbed for online harassment, is expanding ways to curb the amount of abuse users see and making it easier to report such conduct. \nTwitter said Tuesday that it is expanding a \"mute\" function that lets people mute accounts they don't want to see tweets from. Now, users will be able to mute keywords, phrases and conversations they don't want to get notifications about. Users who decide to mute things won't see them. \nThe words, phrases and conversations will continue to exist on Twitter, and anyone who doesn't mute them will continue to see them. But the company is also making it easier to report hateful conduct, and said it has re-trained its support teams about its policies and hateful conduct. \nAbuse can easily spread on Twitter due to its public, real-time nature, where tweets are easily amplified by retweets and users can easily and openly attack others. While Twitter prohibits \"specific conduct that targets people on the basis of race, ethnicity, national origin, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, religious affiliation, age, disability, or disease,\" this policy has not been enough to stomp out abuse. \nNot even celebrities are immune. Over the summer, \"Ghostbusters\" star Leslie Jones publicly abandoned Twitter after becoming the target of sexist and racist abuse on the service. She has since returned. \nTwitter has been trying to get a handle on its Wild West reputation as a haven for online harassment and abuse while still holding onto its commitment to free speech. It's been tricky, to say the least. \n\"We don't expect these announcements to suddenly remove abusive conduct from Twitter,\" Twitter Inc. said in a blog post . \"No single action by us would do that. Instead we commit to rapidly improving Twitter based on everything we observe and learn.\" Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
