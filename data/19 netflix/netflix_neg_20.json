      "text": "Dave Chappelle's comeback to television continues with three Netflix specials By Elahe Izadi The Washington Post Nov 28, 2016 ( … ) \nComedy fans were elated when word came earlier this month that Dave Chappelle would be hosting “Saturday Night Live.” The elusive and popular stand-up comic hadn’t told jokes for a television audience in years, and his post-election episode brought in season-high ratings. \nIt turns out his “SNL” monologue was just a teaser for more material: Netflix announced that it will release three new stand-up specials from the comedy giant. \nOne of them, an original special recorded specifically for Netflix, has no set premiere date, but in 2017 the streaming service will release a pair of unseen concert specials from Chappelle’s “personal comedy vault.” They were filmed at Austin City Limits and the Hollywood Palladium. \n“Dave Chappelle is a legendary voice in comedy — searing, vital, and now more than ever, essential,” Lisa Nishimura, Netflix vice president of original documentary and comedy, said. “Dave’s three new specials promise to be some of the most anticipated events in comedy, and we are honored he will mark his global return on Netflix.” \nHis last special, “Dave Chappelle: For What It’s Worth,” was released in 2004 and directed by Stan Lathan, who will direct all the new Netflix specials. \nChappelle, considered one of the greatest active stand-up comics, famously began performing as a teenager in Washington. He became a masterful comic, recorded several stand-up specials and landed various movie roles, including a part in the 1998 movie “Half Baked,” a cult favorite that he co-wrote. \nBut he catapulted to fame in the early 2000s with his wildly popular sketch comedy show, “Chappelle’s Show.” The Comedy Central series was marked by Chappelle’s unabashed and biting approach to joking about race and racism. But as the show took off, he became more uncomfortable with how the public was receiving his work. \nChappelle reportedly walked away from a $50 million deal to film a third and fourth season, and his departure to South Africa fueled rumors about his well-being. He told Time in 2005 that he had gone overseas for solitude and quiet. \nHe also explained his decision to walk away from the show in 2006, telling Oprah, “I was doing sketches that were funny, but socially irresponsible. I felt like I was deliberately being encouraged and I was overwhelmed. It’s like you’re being flooded with things, and you don’t pay attention to things like your ethics.” \nChappelle has been absent from the small screen since, but he has been performing. If you wanted to see his new material, you had to see it live. Tags",

      "title": "A Possible Explanation For Why Rory Gilmore Is The Worst In Netflix’s ‘Gilmore Girls’ Revival",
      "text": "\nNetflix\nI was already finished with high school when I started watching Gilmore Girls on DVD, years after the series moved from the WB to the CW and was subsequently canceled. And by the time I finished, I was a college graduate. (It took me awhile to get through the whole thing, which is still further than creator Amy Sherman-Palladino made it .) My timeline rarely matched with Rory Gilmore’s: I laughed at her Chilton drama, but I would have cringed had I also been 16, when whatever happens in high school is the most important thing ever . Our paths were roughly the same — I’m a writer, she’s a writer; I enjoy stuffing my face with a comical amount of junk food, she enjoys stuffing her face with a comical amount of junk food — but they didn’t cross. \nThey did for millions of other viewers, though, who related with blue-eyed, rosy-cheeked Rory — they cheered when she got into Yale at the same time they were applying for schools, and cried when she cried at the end of “They Shoot Gilmores, Don’t They?” (Okay, I cried, too, but not because I went through a similar situation.) But that divide between myself and Rory no longer exists, because we’re both adults with grown-up problems, like when I’m unsure if I can afford my monthly trip to London to have sex with my ex-boyfriend, even though he’s engaged and I’m currently seeing someone.\nNetflix’s Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life is, overall, a success: Lauren Graham and Alexis Bledel still have that indescribable spark, the flashback funeral is one of the most emotionally resonant scenes in the entire series, and Emily and Paris remain the best. But there are problems, like the fake Chad Michael Murray, the endless Stars Hollow: The Musical (I’m all for Sutton Foster in everything, but her bit with Christian Borle just kept going), and the fat-shaming “jokes” in “Summer,” the weakest of the four episodes. \nBut my biggest issue with the miniseries is Rory Gilmore. I’m not the only one.\nYoung journalists, some free advice for you: Rory Gilmore is the worst freelancer of all time; do the opposite of whatever she does.\n— Ed Yong (@edyong209) November 28, 2016 \n\n\nIn “Winter,” we learn that Rory had a piece published in T he New Yorker , which has led to countless compliments but no job leads. In other words, she’s a freelance writer — it takes real commitment and courage to live (measly) paycheck to (measly) paycheck, and to learn to live with rejection for the love of the craft. Unfortunately, after a brief success, Rory lacks that commitment. She’s no longer the same person who quit Yale because a rich jerk told her she wasn’t good enough, that she doesn’t have “what it takes” to make it. \nShe’s worse. In A Year in the Life , Rory:\n-Forgets to break up with poor Paul\n-Cheats on Paul with Logan, who’s engaged\n-Goes to a job interview under the assumption that she already has the position; she gets hostile when the editor asks her for ideas\n-Falls asleep while on assignment for GQ \n-Mocks the 30-Something gang\n-Continually complains about being broke but still travels to London\nRory is Belle at the beginning of the Beauty and the Beast , looking down at the “little town” and its “little people.” It didn’t used to be that way. She loved Stars Hollow, while also still wanting to leave it. Which is understandable! I wouldn’t want to live in the house where I grew up, either. But in A Year in the Life , she becomes resentful of her upbringing — when the townspeople congratulate Rory on her return, she responds, “I’m not back!” Again, I get where she’s coming from. I had to move back home after graduating college because I couldn’t afford my rent, and it was one of the most humiliating moments of my life. But I also wasn’t being offered a prestigious teaching job at my alma matter, or assuming job interviews are formalities, or napping during interviews while on assignment — Rory’s undoing is her fault. \nBut Sherman-Palladino continually lets her off the hook with solutions she doesn’t come to by herself. The idea to write a book about her relationship with her mother? Jess. The clarity to make nice with Lorelai? Logan, after an Across the Universe -indebted night on the town. Meanwhile, her best friend Paris is a fiercely independent success who’s running her own business; Emily finds peace again without her husband at her side; and Lorelai, a force of nature who doesn’t need to prove anything to anyone, discovers self-awareness while “doing” Wild . There’s a lot of story potential in Rory, Stars Hollow’s “Chosen One,” struggling to get by, but unlike Lorelai, who lasted for years without her parents’ financial assistance, “Khaleesi” continually takes the easy way out, and makes a child follow her around with an umbrella. \nThis begs the question: Are we supposed to sympathize with Rory? I genuinely can’t tell. My hunch is, yes, we’re supposed to feel for Rory and cheer when she hands the first three chapters of her book to Lorelai. But her arc, from valedictorian to lazy writer who sleeps with her sources, comes across as frustrating at best, and trolling at worst. Sherman-Palladino had to know she was poking the online #content hornet’s nest when she turned Rory, who ended the original series covering this young up-and-comer Barack Obama, into an “actively bad journalist,” to quote the Atlantic , where Rory’s piece was spiked; they responded with 21 ways she messed up. Of course, if Sherman-Palladino, who wasn’t there for the final season, had her way, the series would have ended how A Year In the Life does, with Rory telling her recently-married mother that she’s pregnant. The way she’s depicted in the miniseries works for a confused 22-year-old, but it’s troubling now that she’s 32.\n\nThis is the same Rory Gilmore who turned down Logan’s engagement because she didn’t want to feel trapped by an emotionally manipulative man who throws money at his rich-people problems — a decade later, she has no qualms about being the other woman in an across-the-pond booty call. (Logan once also, accurately, called Rory out for lying to herself. “Wake up, Rory, whether you like it or not, you’re one of us. You went to prep school. You go to Yale. Your grandparents are building a whole damn astronomy building in your name.” In another version of the miniseries, Rory’s conflict is feeling like she’s trapped between worlds: Emily’s privileged elite vs. Lorelai’s folksy community. Or maybe she’s caught in Twin Peaks-meets-Wayward Pines, where she’s cursed to duplicate her mother’s life without being able to leave her small-town bubble. Instead, we got tap-dancing.) \nRory acts like a character from Girls , except we’re supposed to be horrified by the self-centeredness of Hannah and Marnie. Gilmore Girls plays that unintentional revulsion with a straight face, as if there’s nothing wrong with Rory’s entitled actions. The only explanation I can think of for this is that Gilmore Girls , the TV show, is adapted from Gilmore Girls , the book, written by Rory Gilmore. No wonder she’s the hero in her own story. \nIn anyone else’s, she’d be the villain. \nparis: strong, independent, extremely successful doctor, rich,doesnt need a man, career ender, legendary, iconic, showstopping\nrory: gilmore\n— sand(elena)y (@dyIansdobrev) November 25, 2016 \n\n",

      "text": "23 'Gilmore Girls' references you may have missed in the Netflix revival   11:33 AM Megan Willett, INSIDER - Business Insider \nWarning: Spoilers ahead for \"Gilmore Girls: A Year In The Life.\" \nNetflix's revival of \"Gilmore Girls: A Year In The Life\" is now officially streaming. \nThe show likely made many fans feel happy and nostalgic — those four last words aside — while also moving the characters forward in a satisfying way. \nThere were also plenty of references to the series that may have gone over your head unless you're a die-hard fan. Keep reading so you can go back and catch them all. Let’s start with a classic: \"I smell snow,\" Lorelai tells Rory in the town square. Netflix Fans of the original series know that Lorelai has a keen sense for smelling when snow is about to fall. Lorelai smelling the first snow of the year.Warner Bros. \nIn episode eight of the first season, Lorelai tells Rory how much she loves the snow and that she can smell when it's coming. \nShe also says every good thing that's ever happened to her — her first kiss, Rory's first steps, her best birthday — happened when it was snowing. Lorelai is worried that celebrity chef Roy Choi is going to burn down the Dragonfly Inn's kitchen. Netflix \nLorelai has an ever revolving door of chefs coming in and out as she tries to replace her beloved best friend and the inn's chef, Sookie (Melissa McCarthy), during the revival. In the original series, the inn where Lorelai, Michele, and Sookie worked did burn down. Warner Bros. \nWhile working at the Independence Inn, a faulty wire causes a fire to break out and the Inn got shut down. \nIt eventually spurs Lorelai and Sookie to open the Dragonfly Inn together. Emily's new maid Berta is actually played by a Stars Hollow favorite. Netflix That's right — Rose Abdoo, who plays Gypsy in the series, also plays Berta! Netflix \n\"Rose read it for fun in a table read because they hadn't cast it yet, and she was so hilarious they had to double her up,\" Lauren Graham (Lorelai) tweeted about the casting. Gypsy tells Lorelai to buy a new car after fixing her Jeep Wrangler in \"Spring.\" Netflix Everyone should know by now that Lorelai will never get a new car. Warner Bros. \nIn season seven, Lorelai tries to buy a new car, but discovers that she doesn't like any car but her beloved Jeep. \nThe frustrating process of trying to find a car she likes ends up fixing her friendship with Luke, who ends up convincing Gypsy to install a new engine into her old car. There are also a few Easter eggs from the show at Richard's funeral, including a record Rory gave him. Netflix During the first season, Lorelai isn't sure what to get her father. She asks Rory, who says she got him \"Chuck Berry: Live at the Fillmore.\" Netflix and Wikimedia Commons \nThat album is on a table at the funeral, a touching reminder of Rory's relationship with her grandfather. And this picture was from the wedding vow renewal episode, which was also the \"Gilmore Girls\" 100th episode. Netflix The episode was called \"Wedding Bell Blues\" and it was a huge hit with critics and a wonderful glimpse into Emily and Richard's marriage. Warner Bros When Emily is Kondo-ing her home, she tells Lorelai: \"I was married for 50 years, half of me is gone.\" Netflix This bit of dialogue is a touching tribute to actor Edward Hermann. Netflix \nEdward Hermann played Richard Gilmore, the patriarch of the Gilmore family for the series' run. Hermann died in 2014 before the revival could happen. \nThe 50 year mark coincides with when Hermann died in real life: Emily and Richard married in 1964 and Hermann passed away in 2014. In the revival, Richard died in 2016, which means he and Emily would actually have been married for about 52 years. \nHonoring his actual passing could be a subtle nod to the actor from showrunner and creator Amy Sherman-Palladino. The Town Troubadour chases a competing singer through Stars Hollow. Netflix \nHe's played by singer-songwriter Grant-Lee Phillips. It mirrors a plotline from season one when the Town Troubadour becomes the only Town Troubadour. Warner Bros. \nThe Town Troubadour faces off against a rival Troubadour in season one of the series. During a town meeting, the issue is brought up and eventually, it's decided that the original Town Troubadour will be the official Town Troubadour. \nIn season six, he's tapped to tour with Neil Young, prompting a flock of hopeful singers to turn up in Stars Hollow to try and get discovered themselves. Eventually, the Town Troubadour returns and reclaims his rightful post. We finally saw Lane's dad, Mr. Kim, after all these years. Netflix \nFans have wondered for years about Lane's dad — where was he and why did we never see him? \nThis seemed like a very bizarre throwaway moment in the revival, but at least we know he's alive and well. Lorelai has another dream about Paul Anka, the dog and the man. Netflix \nShe tells Rory it's the third one she's had this year. Season six is when Lorelai has her first dream about Paul Anka. Warner Bros. The Gilmore Guys were invited to be a part of the revival. Netflix and Gilmore Guys/Facebook \n\"Gilmore Guys\" is a popular podcast that takes a deep dive into each \"Gilmore Girls\" episode. The pair kept it a secret from fans until the trailer debuted. Richard's will sets money aside for Luke to franchise Luke's Diner. Netflix \nIn the revival, Emily convinces Luke to look at possible locations with her. This plot line also played out in season five. Richard makes the suggestion when he and Luke go golfing at his club. Warner Bros. \nLuke frantically calls Lorelai after he golfs with her father and tells her, \"Your father wants to open up a chain of Luke’s Diners, and I think I agreed to it.\" \n\"There’s going to be seven of them, and that’s just on the eastern seaboard. Then, I’m going national,\" he says. \"I’ve already got a marketing guy, Herb’s my banker, your father is taking care of all my insurance needs, and apparently, everyone is going to be able to buy stock!\" \nLorelai eventually calms Luke down and straightens everything out with her father, but it appears Richard never let the dream die. Lorelai uses \"alumnus\" wrong. Netflix \nWhen she talks to Rory while she's at her Chilton alumni event, she asks \"How's my little alumnus doing?\" \nBut she should know that's not the proper term by now. When Rory was still in high school, she taught her mom the difference between alumna, alumni, and alumnus. Warner Bros. \nRory is preparing to meet a Harvard alumnus, and Lorelai begins teasing her: LORELAI: So, alumna is a girl graduate. RORY: Right. LORELAI: And alumnus is a man. RORY: Singular. LORELAI: So an unmarried man? RORY: No, not not-married. He can be married or single, all alumnus means is one man singular as opposed to many men plural. LORELAI: And plural is alumni. RORY: Right, and that can be girls and guys. LORELAI: Kinky! RORY: No, not kinky, just what it is. \nIt appears she forgot this lesson. The Chilton bathroom scene in the revival is a direct callback to season three. Netflix \nIn this scene, Paris mentions Chilton's uniform hemlines, Rory and Francie teaming up, and student council, practically all in one breath. The Chilton bathroom in the original series is where Francie intimidated Rory and tried to get her to vote for higher hemlines. Warner Bros. \nWhile Rory serves as vice president on student council, the girls' bathroom at Chilton becomes a virtual war room as Francie tries to manipulate Rory to go against Paris's wishes and vote for higher hemlines. Rory eventually stands up to Francie in the same bathroom. \nSeeing all three characters together again in one place was quite fun for fans. Taylor Doose references the Lazy-Hazy-Crazy Days of Summer event in \"Summer.\" Netflix It's from the first episode of season three when Taylor hires a choir to sing \"Lazy-Hazy-Crazy Days of Summer\" on repeat. Warner Bros. \nThe whole town gets the song stuck in their heads and are miserable. \n\"Oh, hey, I figured how to get the 'Lazy-Hazy-Crazy Days of Summer' out of our heads — to sing the 'Small World' song over and over for the next 48 hours,\" Lorelai says. \"Of course, how we get the 'Small World' song out of our heads, I have not worked out yet.\" Carole King sings \"Feel The Earth Move Under My Feet\" and no one recognizes it. Netflix \nKing plays Sophie, the sister of the Town Troubadour who owns a music store in town. \nIn the revival, she reprises her role and volunteers an \"original song\" that she says she's been working on — \"Feel The Earth Move Under My Feet\" — for Taylor to use. The fact that no one recognizes the song is a cute nod to the \"Gilmore Girls\" theme song. Warner Bros. \n\"Where You Lead,\" the famous \"Gilmore Girls\" theme song, was written by King. It's implied in the revival that in the world of \"Gilmore Girls,\" Carole King and her music don't exist. \nTaylor deems Sophie's song \"Feel The Earth Move Under My Feet\" not catchy enough. Logan and his friends show up to Stars Hollow wearing gorilla masks. Netflix The scene was an homage to when Rory first entered Logan's circle after she sees a girl wearing a gorilla mask. Warner Bros. \nRory first finds out about the Life and Death Brigade — the secret society at Yale that Logan is a part of — when a girl wearing a gorilla mask wanders into her bathroom. \nShe decides to investigate for the Yale Daily News, and ends up getting closer to Logan in the process. When Rory goes into Richard's study, you can see her painting above his desk. Netflix Emily had the portrait done in season one. It was Lorelai who suggested Rory read a book while she's posing. Warner Bros. \nRichard loved the painting, and showing his study exactly as he left it was likely another nod to Edward Shermann, who played Richard. Of course Miss Celine helps dress Lorelai for her wedding. Netflix Miss Celine was famous for her taste in fashion — not to mention telling everyone what celebrity they look like. Warner Bros. \nShe was Emily's personal stylist on the series and decided Rory looked like Audrey Hepburn while Lorelai looked like Natalie Wood. When Emily repeatedly tells Lorelai \"You need money\" in \"Fall,\" it's a direct tie to the first episode of \"Gilmore Girls.\" Netflix \nIn the revival, Lorelai needs money to help expand the Dragonfly Inn. Emily agrees, on the condition that Lorelai and Luke visit her every year in Nantucket. Richard originally said \"You need money\" multiple times when Lorelai asks her parents for a loan for Rory's Chilton education. Warner Bros. \nThey decide that Lorelai and Rory will also visit every Friday night for dinner as a part of the arangement. It's the start of a very complicated relationship between the four of them. \nYou can read more about the scene here. Rory shows Dean corn starch before he leave's Doose's Market after they run into each other in \"Fall.\" Netflix Dean tells her to pay for it this time — it's a reference to their first kiss. Netflix \nRory pretended she was buying corn starch when she was really looking at Dean at Doose's Market. She ended up taking the corn starch home with her accidentally after they kissed. Sookie makes a bunch of wedding cakes for Lorelai, and one of them is covered in daisies. Netflix Daisies are Lorelai's favorite flower. Warner Bros. \nIn the first season finale of \"Gilmoe Girls,\" Lorelai tells her then-boyfriend Max (Scott Cohen) that a proposal should have, \"a thousand yellow daisies, and candles, and a horse.\" \nMax takes Lorelai at her word and proposes with a thousand yellow daisies. Though the pair never got married, it was one of the show's most romantic moments. While they're getting ready for the wedding in the revival, eagle-eyed fans can spot this picture of Rory's 16th birthday by Jess's elbow. Netflix It's a picture from season one when Lorelai throws Rory a birthday party in their home. It's a nice reference to how far the series has come. Warner Bros.

Keep reading so you can go back and catch them all. Let’s start with a classic: \"I smell snow,\" Lorelai tells Rory in the town square. Netflix Fans of the original series know that Lorelai has a keen sense for smelling when snow is about to fall. Lorelai smelling the first snow of the year.Warner Bros. \nIn episode eight of the first season, Lorelai tells Rory how much she loves the snow and that she can smell when it's coming. \nShe also says every good thing that's ever happened to her — her first kiss, Rory's first steps, her best birthday — happened when it was snowing. Lorelai is worried that celebrity chef Roy Choi is going to burn down the Dragonfly Inn's kitchen. Netflix \nLorelai has an ever revolving door of chefs coming in and out as she tries to replace her beloved best friend and the inn's chef, Sookie (Melissa McCarthy), during the revival. In the original series, the inn where Lorelai, Michele, and Sookie worked did burn down. Warner Bros. \nWhile working at the Independence Inn, a faulty wire causes a fire to break out and the Inn got shut down. \nIt eventually spurs Lorelai and Sookie to open the Dragonfly Inn together. Emily's new maid Berta is actually played by a Stars Hollow favorite. Netflix That's right — Rose Abdoo, who plays Gypsy in the series, also plays Berta! Netflix \n\"Rose read it for fun in a table read because they hadn't cast it yet, and she was so hilarious they had to double her up,\" Lauren Graham (Lorelai) tweeted about the casting. Gypsy tells Lorelai to buy a new car after fixing her Jeep Wrangler in \"Spring.\" Netflix Everyone should know by now that Lorelai will never get a new car. Warner Bros. \nIn season seven, Lorelai tries to buy a new car, but discovers that she doesn't like any car but her beloved Jeep. \nThe frustrating process of trying to find a car she likes ends up fixing her friendship with Luke, who ends up convincing Gypsy to install a new engine into her old car. There are also a few Easter eggs from the show at Richard's funeral, including a record Rory gave him. Netflix During the first season, Lorelai isn't sure what to get her father. She asks Rory, who says she got him \"Chuck Berry: Live at the Fillmore.\" Netflix and Wikimedia Commons \nThat album is on a table at the funeral, a touching reminder of Rory's relationship with her grandfather. And this picture was from the wedding vow renewal episode, which was also the \"Gilmore Girls\" 100th episode. Netflix The episode was called \"Wedding Bell Blues\" and it was a huge hit with critics and a wonderful glimpse into Emily and Richard's marriage. Warner Bros When Emily is Kondo-ing her home, she tells Lorelai: \"I was married for 50 years, half of me is gone.\" Netflix This bit of dialogue is a touching tribute to actor Edward Hermann. Netflix \nEdward Hermann played Richard Gilmore, the patriarch of the Gilmore family for the series' run. Hermann died in 2014 before the revival could happen. \nThe 50 year mark coincides with when Hermann died in real life: Emily and Richard married in 1964 and Hermann passed away in 2014. In the revival, Richard died in 2016, which means he and Emily would actually have been married for about 52 years. \nHonoring his actual passing could be a subtle nod to the actor from showrunner and creator Amy Sherman-Palladino. The Town Troubadour chases a competing singer through Stars Hollow. Netflix \nHe's played by singer-songwriter Grant-Lee Phillips. It mirrors a plotline from season one when the Town Troubadour becomes the only Town Troubadour. Warner Bros. \nThe Town Troubadour faces off against a rival Troubadour in season one of the series. During a town meeting, the issue is brought up and eventually, it's decided that the original Town Troubadour will be the official Town Troubadour. \nIn season six, he's tapped to tour with Neil Young, prompting a flock of hopeful singers to turn up in Stars Hollow to try and get discovered themselves. Eventually, the Town Troubadour returns and reclaims his rightful post. We finally saw Lane's dad, Mr. Kim, after all these years. Netflix \nFans have wondered for years about Lane's dad — where was he and why did we never see him? \nThis seemed like a very bizarre throwaway moment in the revival, but at least we know he's alive and well. Lorelai has another dream about Paul Anka, the dog and the man. Netflix \nShe tells Rory it's the third one she's had this year. Season six is when Lorelai has her first dream about Paul Anka. Warner Bros. The Gilmore Guys were invited to be a part of the revival. Netflix and Gilmore Guys/Facebook \n\"Gilmore Guys\" is a popular podcast that takes a deep dive into each \"Gilmore Girls\" episode. The pair kept it a secret from fans until the trailer debuted. Richard's will sets money aside for Luke to franchise Luke's Diner. Netflix \nIn the revival, Emily convinces Luke to look at possible locations with her. This plot line also played out in season five. Richard makes the suggestion when he and Luke go golfing at his club. Warner Bros. \nLuke frantically calls Lorelai after he golfs with her father and tells her, \"Your father wants to open up a chain of Luke’s Diners, and I think I agreed to it.\" \n\"There’s going to be seven of them, and that’s just on the eastern seaboard. Then, I’m going national,\" he says. \"I’ve already got a marketing guy, Herb’s my banker, your father is taking care of all my insurance needs, and apparently, everyone is going to be able to buy stock!\" \nLorelai eventually calms Luke down and straightens everything out with her father, but it appears Richard never let the dream die. Lorelai uses \"alumnus\" wrong. Netflix \nWhen she talks to Rory while she's at her Chilton alumni event, she asks \"How's my little alumnus doing?\" \nBut she should know that's not the proper term by now. When Rory was still in high school, she taught her mom the difference between alumna, alumni, and alumnus. Warner Bros. \nRory is preparing to meet a Harvard alumnus, and Lorelai begins teasing her: LORELAI: So, alumna is a girl graduate. RORY: Right. LORELAI: And alumnus is a man. RORY: Singular. LORELAI: So an unmarried man? RORY: No, not not-married. He can be married or single, all alumnus means is one man singular as opposed to many men plural. LORELAI: And plural is alumni. RORY: Right, and that can be girls and guys. LORELAI: Kinky! RORY: No, not kinky, just what it is. \nIt appears she forgot this lesson. The Chilton bathroom scene in the revival is a direct callback to season three. Netflix \nIn this scene, Paris mentions Chilton's uniform hemlines, Rory and Francie teaming up, and student council, practically all in one breath. The Chilton bathroom in the original series is where Francie intimidated Rory and tried to get her to vote for higher hemlines. Warner Bros. \nWhile Rory serves as vice president on student council, the girls' bathroom at Chilton becomes a virtual war room as Francie tries to manipulate Rory to go against Paris's wishes and vote for higher hemlines. Rory eventually stands up to Francie in the same bathroom. \nSeeing all three characters together again in one place was quite fun for fans. Taylor Doose references the Lazy-Hazy-Crazy Days of Summer event in \"Summer.\" Netflix It's from the first episode of season three when Taylor hires a choir to sing \"Lazy-Hazy-Crazy Days of Summer\" on repeat. Warner Bros. \nThe whole town gets the song stuck in their heads and are miserable. \n\"Oh, hey, I figured how to get the 'Lazy-Hazy-Crazy Days of Summer' out of our heads — to sing the 'Small World' song over and over for the next 48 hours,\" Lorelai says. \"Of course, how we get the 'Small World' song out of our heads, I have not worked out yet.\" Carole King sings \"Feel The Earth Move Under My Feet\" and no one recognizes it. Netflix \nKing plays Sophie, the sister of the Town Troubadour who owns a music store in town. \nIn the revival, she reprises her role and volunteers an \"original song\" that she says she's been working on — \"Feel The Earth Move Under My Feet\" — for Taylor to use. The fact that no one recognizes the song is a cute nod to the \"Gilmore Girls\" theme song. Warner Bros. \n\"Where You Lead,\" the famous \"Gilmore Girls\" theme song, was written by King. It's implied in the revival that in the world of \"Gilmore Girls,\" Carole King and her music don't exist. \nTaylor deems Sophie's song \"Feel The Earth Move Under My Feet\" not catchy enough. Logan and his friends show up to Stars Hollow wearing gorilla masks. Netflix The scene was an homage to when Rory first entered Logan's circle after she sees a girl wearing a gorilla mask. Warner Bros. \nRory first finds out about the Life and Death Brigade — the secret society at Yale that Logan is a part of —when a girl wearing a gorilla mask wanders into her bathroom. \nShe decides to investigate for the Yale Daily News, and ends up getting closer to Logan in the process. When Rory goes into Richard's study, you can see her painting above his desk. Netflix Emily had the portrait done in season one. It was Lorelai who suggested Rory read a book while she's posing. Warner Bros. \nRichard loved the painting, and showing his study exactly as he left it was likely another nod to Edward Shermann, who played Richard. Of course Miss Celine helps dress Lorelai for her wedding. Netflix Miss Celine was famous for her taste in fashion — not to mention telling everyone what celebrity they look like. Warner Bros. \nShe was Emily's personal stylist on the series and decided Rory looked like Audrey Hepburn while Lorelai looked like Natalie Wood. When Emily repeatedly tells Lorelai \"You need money\" in \"Fall,\" it's a direct tie to the first episode of \"Gilmore Girls.\" Netflix \nIn the revival, Lorelai needs money to help expand the Dragonfly Inn. Emily agrees, on the condition that Lorelai and Luke visit her every year in Nantucket. Richard originally said \"You need money\" multiple times when Lorelai asks her parents for a loan for Rory's Chilton education. Warner Bros. \nThey decide that Lorelai and Rory will also visit every Friday night for dinner as a part of the arangement. It's the start of a very complicated relationship between the four of them. \nYou can read more about the scene here. Rory shows Dean corn starch before he leave's Doose's Market after they run into each other in \"Fall.\" Netflix Dean tells her to pay for it this time — it's a reference to their first kiss. Netflix \nRory pretended she was buying corn starch when she was really looking at Dean at Doose's Market. She ended up taking the corn starch home with her accidentally after they kissed. Sookie makes a bunch of wedding cakes for Lorelai, and one of them is covered in daisies. Netflix Daisies are Lorelai's favorite flower. Warner Bros. \nIn the first season finale of \"Gilmoe Girls,\" Lorelai tells her then-boyfriend Max (Scott Cohen) that a proposal should have, \"a thousand yellow daisies, and candles, and a horse.\" \nMax takes Lorelai at her word and proposes with a thousand yellow daisies. Though the pair never got married, it was one of the show's most romantic moments. While they're getting ready for the wedding in the revival, eagle-eyed fans can spot this picture of Rory's 16th birthday by Jess's elbow. Netflix It's a picture from season one when Lorelai throws Rory a birthday party in their home. It's a nice reference to how far the series has come. Warner Bros.

Keep reading so you can go back and catch them all. Let’s start with a classic: \"I smell snow,\" Lorelai tells Rory in the town square. Netflix Fans of the original series know that Lorelai has a keen sense for smelling when snow is about to fall. Lorelai smelling the first snow of the year.Warner Bros. \nIn episode eight of the first season, Lorelai tells Rory how much she loves the snow and that she can smell when it's coming. \nShe also says every good thing that's ever happened to her — her first kiss, Rory's first steps, her best birthday — happened when it was snowing. Lorelai is worried that celebrity chef Roy Choi is going to burn down the Dragonfly Inn's kitchen. Netflix \nLorelai has an ever revolving door of chefs coming in and out as she tries to replace her beloved best friend and the inn's chef, Sookie (Melissa McCarthy), during the revival. In the original series, the inn where Lorelai, Michele, and Sookie worked did burn down. Warner Bros. \nWhile working at the Independence Inn, a faulty wire causes a fire to break out and the Inn got shut down. \nIt eventually spurs Lorelai and Sookie to open the Dragonfly Inn together. Emily's new maid Berta is actually played by a Stars Hollow favorite. Netflix That's right — Rose Abdoo, who plays Gypsy in the series, also plays Berta! Netflix \n\"Rose read it for fun in a table read because they hadn't cast it yet, and she was so hilarious they had to double her up,\" Lauren Graham (Lorelai) tweeted about the casting. Gypsy tells Lorelai to buy a new car after fixing her Jeep Wrangler in \"Spring.\" Netflix Everyone should know by now that Lorelai will never get a new car. Warner Bros. \nIn season seven, Lorelai tries to buy a new car, but discovers that she doesn't like any car but her beloved Jeep. \nThe frustrating process of trying to find a car she likes ends up fixing her friendship with Luke, who ends up convincing Gypsy to install a new engine into her old car. There are also a few Easter eggs from the show at Richard's funeral, including a record Rory gave him. Netflix During the first season, Lorelai isn't sure what to get her father. She asks Rory, who says she got him \"Chuck Berry: Live at the Fillmore.\" Netflix and Wikimedia Commons \nThat album is on a table at the funeral, a touching reminder of Rory's relationship with her grandfather. And this picture was from the wedding vow renewal episode, which was also the \"Gilmore Girls\" 100th episode. Netflix The episode was called \"Wedding Bell Blues\" and it was a huge hit with critics and a wonderful glimpse into Emily and Richard's marriage. Warner Bros When Emily is Kondo-ing her home, she tells Lorelai: \"I was married for 50 years, half of me is gone.\" Netflix This bit of dialogue is a touching tribute to actor Edward Hermann. Netflix \nEdward Hermann played Richard Gilmore, the patriarch of the Gilmore family for the series' run. Hermann died in 2014 before the revival could happen. \nThe 50 year mark coincides with when Hermann died in real life: Emily and Richard married in 1964 and Hermann passed away in 2014. In the revival, Richard died in 2016, which means he and Emily would actually have been married for about 52 years. \nHonoring his actual passing could be a subtle nod to the actor from showrunner and creator Amy Sherman-Palladino. The Town Troubadour chases a competing singer through Stars Hollow. Netflix \nHe's played by singer-songwriter Grant-Lee Phillips. It mirrors a plotline from season one when the Town Troubadour becomes the only Town Troubadour. Warner Bros. \nThe Town Troubadour faces off against a rival Troubadour in season one of the series. During a town meeting, the issue is brought up and eventually, it's decided that the original Town Troubadour will be the official Town Troubadour. \nIn season six, he's tapped to tour with Neil Young, prompting a flock of hopeful singers to turn up in Stars Hollow to try and get discovered themselves. Eventually, the Town Troubadour returns and reclaims his rightful post. We finally saw Lane's dad, Mr. Kim, after all these years. Netflix \nFans have wondered for years about Lane's dad — where was he and why did we never see him? \nThis seemed like a very bizarre throwaway moment in the revival, but at least we know he's alive and well. Lorelai has another dream about Paul Anka, the dog and the man. Netflix \nShe tells Rory it's the third one she's had this year. Season six is when Lorelai has her first dream about Paul Anka. Warner Bros. The Gilmore Guys were invited to be a part of the revival. Netflix and Gilmore Guys/Facebook \n\"Gilmore Guys\" is a popular podcast that takes a deep dive into each \"Gilmore Girls\" episode. The pair kept it a secret from fans until the trailer debuted. Richard's will sets money aside for Luke to franchise Luke's Diner. Netflix \nIn the revival, Emily convinces Luke to look at possible locations with her. This plot line also played out in season five. Richard makes the suggestion when he and Luke go golfing at his club. Warner Bros. \nLuke frantically calls Lorelai after he golfs with her father and tells her, \"Your father wants to open up a chain of Luke’s Diners, and I think I agreed to it.\" \n\"There’s going to be seven of them, and that’s just on the eastern seaboard. Then, I’m going national,\" he says. \"I’ve already got a marketing guy, Herb’s my banker, your father is taking care of all my insurance needs, and apparently, everyone is going to be able to buy stock!\" \nLorelai eventually calms Luke down and straightens everything out with her father, but it appears Richard never let the dream die. Lorelai uses \"alumnus\" wrong. Netflix \nWhen she talks to Rory while she's at her Chilton alumni event, she asks \"How's my little alumnus doing?\" \nBut she should know that's not the proper term by now. When Rory was still in high school, she taught her mom the difference between alumna, alumni, and alumnus. Warner Bros. \nRory is preparing to meet a Harvard alumnus, and Lorelai begins teasing her: LORELAI: So, alumna is a girl graduate. RORY: Right. LORELAI: And alumnus is a man. RORY: Singular. LORELAI: So an unmarried man? RORY: No, not not-married. He can be married or single, all alumnus means is one man singular as opposed to many men plural. LORELAI: And plural is alumni. RORY: Right, and that can be girls and guys. LORELAI: Kinky! RORY: No, not kinky, just what it is. \nIt appears she forgot this lesson. The Chilton bathroom scene in the revival is a direct callback to season three. Netflix \nIn this scene, Paris mentions Chilton's uniform hemlines, Rory and Francie teaming up, and student council, practically all in one breath. The Chilton bathroom in the original series is where Francie intimidated Rory and tried to get her to vote for higher hemlines. Warner Bros. \nWhile Rory serves as vice president on student council, the girls' bathroom at Chilton becomes a virtual war room as Francie tries to manipulate Rory to go against Paris's wishes and vote for higher hemlines. Rory eventually stands up to Francie in the same bathroom. \nSeeing all three characters together again in one place was quite fun for fans. Taylor Doose references the Lazy-Hazy-Crazy Days of Summer event in \"Summer.\" Netflix It's from the first episode of season three when Taylor hires a choir to sing \"Lazy-Hazy-Crazy Days of Summer\" on repeat. Warner Bros. \nThe whole town gets the song stuck in their heads and are miserable. \n\"Oh, hey, I figured how to get the 'Lazy-Hazy-Crazy Days of Summer' out of our heads — to sing the 'Small World' song over and over for the next 48 hours,\" Lorelai says. \"Of course, how we get the 'Small World' song out of our heads, I have not worked out yet.\" Carole King sings \"Feel The Earth Move Under My Feet\" and no one recognizes it. Netflix \nKing plays Sophie, the sister of the Town Troubadour who owns a music store in town. \nIn the revival, she reprises her role and volunteers an \"original song\" that she says she's been working on — \"Feel The Earth Move Under My Feet\" — for Taylor to use. The fact that no one recognizes the song is a cute nod to the \"Gilmore Girls\" theme song. Warner Bros. \n\"Where You Lead,\" the famous \"Gilmore Girls\" theme song, was written by King. It's implied in the revival that in the world of \"Gilmore Girls,\" Carole King and her music don't exist. \nTaylor deems Sophie's song \"Feel The Earth Move Under My Feet\" not catchy enough. Logan and his friends show up to Stars Hollow wearing gorilla masks. Netflix The scene was an homage to when Rory first entered Logan's circle after she sees a girl wearing a gorilla mask. Warner Bros. \nRory first finds out about the Life and Death Brigade — the secret society at Yale that Logan is a part of — when a girl wearing a gorilla mask wanders into her bathroom. \nShe decides to investigate for the Yale Daily News, and ends up getting closer to Logan in the process. When Rory goes into Richard's study, you can see her painting above his desk. Netflix Emily had the portrait done in season one. It was Lorelai who suggested Rory read a book while she's posing. Warner Bros. \nRichard loved the painting, and showing his study exactly as he left it was likely another nod to Edward Shermann, who played Richard. Of course Miss Celine helps dress Lorelai for her wedding. Netflix Miss Celine was famous for her taste in fashion — not to mention telling everyone what celebrity they look like. Warner Bros. \nShe was Emily's personal stylist on the series and decided Rory looked like Audrey Hepburn while Lorelai looked like Natalie Wood. When Emily repeatedly tells Lorelai \"You need money\" in \"Fall,\" it's a direct tie to the first episode of \"Gilmore Girls.\" Netflix \nIn the revival, Lorelai needs money to help expand the Dragonfly Inn. Emily agrees, on the condition that Lorelai and Luke visit her every year in Nantucket. Richard originally said \"You need money\" multiple times when Lorelai asks her parents for a loan for Rory's Chilton education. Warner Bros. \nThey decide that Lorelai and Rory will also visit every Friday night for dinner as a part of the arangement. It's the start of a very complicated relationship between the four of them. \nYou can read more about the scene here. Rory shows Dean corn starch before he leave's Doose's Market after they run into each other in \"Fall.\" Netflix Dean tells her to pay for it this time — it's a reference to their first kiss. Netflix \nRory pretended she was buying corn starch when she was really looking at Dean at Doose's Market. She ended up taking the corn starch home with her accidentally after they kissed. Sookie makes a bunch of wedding cakes for Lorelai, and one of them is covered in daisies. Netflix Daisies are Lorelai's favorite flower. Warner Bros. \nIn the first season finale of \"Gilmoe Girls,\" Lorelai tells her then-boyfriend Max (Scott Cohen) that a proposal should have, \"a thousand yellow daisies, and candles, and a horse.\" \nMax takes Lorelai at her word and proposes with a thousand yellow daisies. Though the pair never got married, it was one of the show's most romantic moments. While they're getting ready for the wedding in the revival, eagle-eyed fans can spot this picture of Rory's 16th birthday by Jess's elbow. Netflix It's a picture from season one when Lorelai throws Rory a birthday party in their home. It's a nice reference to how far the series has come. Warner Bros.

      "text": "23 'Gilmore Girls' references you may have missed in the Netflix revival Tuesday Nov 29, 2016 at 10:33 AM Megan Willett, INSIDER - Business Insider \nWarning: Spoilers ahead for \"Gilmore Girls: A Year In The Life.\" \nNetflix's revival of \"Gilmore Girls: A Year In The Life\" is now officially streaming. \nThe show likely made many fans feel happy and nostalgic — those four last words aside — while also moving the characters forward in a satisfying way. \nThere were also plenty of references to the series that may have gone over your head unless you're a die-hard fan. Keep reading so you can go back and catch them all. Let’s start with a classic: \"I smell snow,\" Lorelai tells Rory in the town square. Netflix Fans of the original series know that Lorelai has a keen sense for smelling when snow is about to fall. Lorelai smelling the first snow of the year.Warner Bros. \nIn episode eight of the first season, Lorelai tells Rory how much she loves the snow and that she can smell when it's coming. \nShe also says every good thing that's ever happened to her — her first kiss, Rory's first steps, her best birthday — happened when it was snowing. Lorelai is worried that celebrity chef Roy Choi is going to burn down the Dragonfly Inn's kitchen. Netflix \nLorelai has an ever revolving door of chefs coming in and out as she tries to replace her beloved best friend and the inn's chef, Sookie (Melissa McCarthy), during the revival. In the original series, the inn where Lorelai, Michele, and Sookie worked did burn down. Warner Bros. \nWhile working at the Independence Inn, a faulty wire causes a fire to break out and the Inn got shut down. \nIt eventually spurs Lorelai and Sookie to open the Dragonfly Inn together. Emily's new maid Berta is actually played by a Stars Hollow favorite. Netflix That's right — Rose Abdoo, who plays Gypsy in the series, also plays Berta! Netflix \n\"Rose read it for fun in a table read because they hadn't cast it yet, and she was so hilarious they had to double her up,\" Lauren Graham (Lorelai) tweeted about the casting. Gypsy tells Lorelai to buy a new car after fixing her Jeep Wrangler in \"Spring.\" Netflix Everyone should know by now that Lorelai will never get a new car. Warner Bros. \nIn season seven, Lorelai tries to buy a new car, but discovers that she doesn't like any car but her beloved Jeep. \nThe frustrating process of trying to find a car she likes ends up fixing her friendship with Luke, who ends up convincing Gypsy to install a new engine into her old car. There are also a few Easter eggs from the show at Richard's funeral, including a record Rory gave him. Netflix During the first season, Lorelai isn't sure what to get her father. She asks Rory, who says she got him \"Chuck Berry: Live at the Fillmore.\" Netflix and Wikimedia Commons \nThat album is on a table at the funeral, a touching reminder of Rory's relationship with her grandfather. And this picture was from the wedding vow renewal episode, which was also the \"Gilmore Girls\" 100th episode. Netflix The episode was called \"Wedding Bell Blues\" and it was a huge hit with critics and a wonderful glimpse into Emily and Richard's marriage. Warner Bros When Emily is Kondo-ing her home, she tells Lorelai: \"I was married for 50 years, half of me is gone.\" Netflix This bit of dialogue is a touching tribute to actor Edward Hermann. Netflix \nEdward Hermann played Richard Gilmore, the patriarch of the Gilmore family for the series' run. Hermann died in 2014 before the revival could happen. \nThe 50 year mark coincides with when Hermann died in real life: Emily and Richard married in 1964 and Hermann passed away in 2014. In the revival, Richard died in 2016, which means he and Emily would actually have been married for about 52 years. \nHonoring his actual passing could be a subtle nod to the actor from showrunner and creator Amy Sherman-Palladino. The Town Troubadour chases a competing singer through Stars Hollow. Netflix \nHe's played by singer-songwriter Grant-Lee Phillips. It mirrors a plotline from season one when the Town Troubadour becomes the only Town Troubadour. Warner Bros. \nThe Town Troubadour faces off against a rival Troubadour in season one of the series. During a town meeting, the issue is brought up and eventually, it's decided that the original Town Troubadour will be the official Town Troubadour. \nIn season six, he's tapped to tour with Neil Young, prompting a flock of hopeful singers to turn up in Stars Hollow to try and get discovered themselves. Eventually, the Town Troubadour returns and reclaims his rightful post. We finally saw Lane's dad, Mr. Kim, after all these years. Netflix \nFans have wondered for years about Lane's dad — where was he and why did we never see him? \nThis seemed like a very bizarre throwaway moment in the revival, but at least we know he's alive and well. Lorelai has another dream about Paul Anka, the dog and the man. Netflix \nShe tells Rory it's the third one she's had this year. Season six is when Lorelai has her first dream about Paul Anka. Warner Bros. The Gilmore Guys were invited to be a part of the revival. Netflix and Gilmore Guys/Facebook \n\"Gilmore Guys\" is a popular podcast that takes a deep dive into each \"Gilmore Girls\" episode. The pair kept it a secret from fans until the trailer debuted. Richard's will sets money aside for Luke to franchise Luke's Diner. Netflix \nIn the revival, Emily convinces Luke to look at possible locations with her. This plot line also played out in season five. Richard makes the suggestion when he and Luke go golfing at his club. Warner Bros. \nLuke frantically calls Lorelai after he golfs with her father and tells her, \"Your father wants to open up a chain of Luke’s Diners, and I think I agreed to it.\" \n\"There’s going to be seven of them, and that’s just on the eastern seaboard. Then, I’m going national,\" he says. \"I’ve already got a marketing guy, Herb’s my banker, your father is taking care of all my insurance needs, and apparently, everyone is going to be able to buy stock!\" \nLorelai eventually calms Luke down and straightens everything out with her father, but it appears Richard never let the dream die. Lorelai uses \"alumnus\" wrong. Netflix \nWhen she talks to Rory while she's at her Chilton alumni event, she asks \"How's my little alumnus doing?\" \nBut she should know that's not the proper term by now. When Rory was still in high school, she taught her mom the difference between alumna, alumni, and alumnus. Warner Bros. \nRory is preparing to meet a Harvard alumnus, and Lorelai begins teasing her: LORELAI: So, alumna is a girl graduate. RORY: Right. LORELAI: And alumnus is a man. RORY: Singular. LORELAI: So an unmarried man? RORY: No, not not-married. He can be married or single, all alumnus means is one man singular as opposed to many men plural. LORELAI: And plural is alumni. RORY: Right, and that can be girls and guys. LORELAI: Kinky! RORY: No, not kinky, just what it is. \nIt appears she forgot this lesson. The Chilton bathroom scene in the revival is a direct callback to season three. Netflix \nIn this scene, Paris mentions Chilton's uniform hemlines, Rory and Francie teaming up, and student council, practically all in one breath. The Chilton bathroom in the original series is where Francie intimidated Rory and tried to get her to vote for higher hemlines. Warner Bros. \nWhile Rory serves as vice president on student council, the girls' bathroom at Chilton becomes a virtual war room as Francie tries to manipulate Rory to go against Paris's wishes and vote for higher hemlines. Rory eventually stands up to Francie in the same bathroom. \nSeeing all three characters together again in one place was quite fun for fans. Taylor Doose references the Lazy-Hazy-Crazy Days of Summer event in \"Summer.\" Netflix It's from the first episode of season three when Taylor hires a choir to sing \"Lazy-Hazy-Crazy Days of Summer\" on repeat. Warner Bros. \nThe whole town gets the song stuck in their heads and are miserable. \n\"Oh, hey, I figured how to get the 'Lazy-Hazy-Crazy Days of Summer' out of our heads — to sing the 'Small World' song over and over for the next 48 hours,\" Lorelai says. \"Of course, how we get the 'Small World' song out of our heads, I have not worked out yet.\" Carole King sings \"Feel The Earth Move Under My Feet\" and no one recognizes it. Netflix \nKing plays Sophie, the sister of the Town Troubadour who owns a music store in town. \nIn the revival, she reprises her role and volunteers an \"original song\" that she says she's been working on — \"Feel The Earth Move Under My Feet\" — for Taylor to use. The fact that no one recognizes the song is a cute nod to the \"Gilmore Girls\" theme song. Warner Bros. \n\"Where You Lead,\" the famous \"Gilmore Girls\" theme song, was written by King. It's implied in the revival that in the world of \"Gilmore Girls,\" Carole King and her music don't exist. \nTaylor deems Sophie's song \"Feel The Earth Move Under My Feet\" not catchy enough. Logan and his friends show up to Stars Hollow wearing gorilla masks. Netflix The scene was an homage to when Rory first entered Logan's circle after she sees a girl wearing a gorilla mask. Warner Bros. \nRory first finds out about the Life and Death Brigade — the secret society at Yale that Logan is a part of — when a girl wearing a gorilla mask wanders into her bathroom. \nShe decides to investigate for the Yale Daily News, and ends up getting closer to Logan in the process. When Rory goes into Richard's study, you can see her painting above his desk. Netflix Emily had the portrait done in season one. It was Lorelai who suggested Rory read a book while she's posing. Warner Bros. \nRichard loved the painting, and showing his study exactly as he left it was likely another nod to Edward Shermann, who played Richard. Of course Miss Celine helps dress Lorelai for her wedding. Netflix Miss Celine was famous for her taste in fashion — not to mention telling everyone what celebrity they look like. Warner Bros. \nShe was Emily's personal stylist on the series and decided Rory looked like Audrey Hepburn while Lorelai looked like Natalie Wood. When Emily repeatedly tells Lorelai \"You need money\" in \"Fall,\" it's a direct tie to the first episode of \"Gilmore Girls.\" Netflix \nIn the revival, Lorelai needs money to help expand the Dragonfly Inn. Emily agrees, on the condition that Lorelai and Luke visit her every year in Nantucket. Richard originally said \"You need money\" multiple times when Lorelai asks her parents for a loan for Rory's Chilton education. Warner Bros. \nThey decide that Lorelai and Rory will also visit every Friday night for dinner as a part of the arangement. It's the start of a very complicated relationship between the four of them. \nYou can read more about the scene here. Rory shows Dean corn starch before he leave's Doose's Market after they run into each other in \"Fall.\" Netflix Dean tells her to pay for it this time — it's a reference to their first kiss. Netflix \nRory pretended she was buying corn starch when she was really looking at Dean at Doose's Market. She ended up taking the corn starch home with her accidentally after they kissed. Sookie makes a bunch of wedding cakes for Lorelai, and one of them is covered in daisies. Netflix Daisies are Lorelai's favorite flower. Warner Bros. \nIn the first season finale of \"Gilmoe Girls,\" Lorelai tells her then-boyfriend Max (Scott Cohen) that a proposal should have, \"a thousand yellow daisies, and candles, and a horse.\" \nMax takes Lorelai at her word and proposes with a thousand yellow daisies. Though the pair never got married, it was one of the show's most romantic moments. While they're getting ready for the wedding in the revival, eagle-eyed fans can spot this picture of Rory's 16th birthday by Jess's elbow. Netflix It's a picture from season one when Lorelai throws Rory a birthday party in their home. It's a nice reference to how far the series has come. Warner Bros.

      "text": "Print \nYou've seen \"Gilmore Girls\" and its revival, streaming on Netflix since Black Friday. Now read the tell-all book by chatty matriarch Lauren Graham. \n\"Talking as Fast as I Can: From Gilmore Girls to Gilmore Girls (and Everything in Between),\" unveiled today, is all about the Lorelai Gilmore experience, from the show's seven-season run on TV (2000-2007) through the four new 90-minute movies on Netflix. \n\"Returning to the show justified putting together these thoughts and essays,\" Graham, 49, tells USA Today. \"I thought, 'I feel so grateful to get to do this again that I'm going to write about what it was like.\" \nShe also touches on all the usual subjects in Hollywood memoirs, including failed auditions, sexism, ageism and relationships. Graham is now seeing former \"Parenthood\" co-star Peter Krause, but she's more coy about how she ended \"a long dating dry spell\" with Matthew Perry of \"Friends.\" \n\"He became my Friend Who I Almost But Never Exactly Dated,\" Graham says, cryptically. \nUnlike that explanation, she is crystal clear about her feelings toward returning nearly a decade later to fictional Stars Hollow, Connecticut, with daughter Rory (Alexis Biedel). The \"Gilmore Girls\" resurrection, says Graham, has been \"incredibly satisfying.\" \nPhoto courtesy of Netflix",

      "text": "11/29/16 AT 2:12 PM Close \n“Gilmore Girls” didn’t have to worry too much about spoilers the first time around, but the dramedy was brought back at a time where TV lovers are obsessed with getting plot details ahead of time. With such a surprising ending (which won’t be discussed in this article), Netflix quickly realized that they needed to protect the precious details of “Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life.” \nFor Sean Gunn , who plays Kirk, that wasn’t surprising. Since wrapping the original “Gilmore Girls” in 2007, the actor has worked steadily, most notably in Marvel’s “Guardians of the Galaxy” where he plays Kraglin. Marvel Studios is notoriously vigilant about keeping spoilers locked up. \n“Marvel [is more intense], times 10, I would say,” Gunn told International Business Times during a phone interview. “I think Netflix sort of was catching up to the fact that, ‘Oh wait a minute, we can’t let any spoilers out.’ They were sort of scrambling to make sure that nobody said anything. Marvel is on top of it from Day 1. Marvel — it’s very clear that they’re going to send you to some sort of Marvel gulag if you reveal anything. But they’re both pretty serious about it.” \nGunn might be used to spoiler-phobic studios, but other cast members weren’t. Scott Patterson, who plays Luke, noted that the cast was under some serious orders not to let anything slip. \n“Just being careful and reading the Netflix memos like, ‘We will kill you if these things get out,’” Patterson joked to the Hollywood Reporter . “But I share their concern because it is a different world and look, they’re working very long hours and they’re working very hard to promote this and they want to do it their way and they should have the license to do it this way. They know what they’re doing.” \nSean Gunn and Lauren Graham had to keep behind-the-scenes photos to themselves while filming “Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life.” Photo: Netflix Part of Netflix’s new rules were about social media, which barely existed when “Gilmore Girls” ended in 2007. Lorelai actress Lauren Graham said that the cast had to cut back on their tweets and Instagram posts. \n“Because the fans are so enthusiastic, [Netflix] wants to control [the story spoilers] so [fans] can really enjoy the show and not have too many story points or too much out there before the shows happen,” Graham explained to Entertainment Tonight . “So there’s just been this sort of lock down on set in terms of social media, which I think is fine with both [me and Alexis Bledel].” \nHowever, the rules lifted once “Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life” hit Netflix last Friday. Since then, cast members have been posting memories on social media. Gunn noted in his caption that he’d been waiting months to post photos. Check out some of the behind-the-scenes photos Gunn and other cast members have shared since the restrictions were lifted below: Related Stories",

      "text": "Video Transcript Transcript for 'Netflix Tax' Could Put a Dent in Binge-Watching people with hearing loss, Switch to Sprint today. Visit Sprintrelay.com That's a scene from Netflix \"Gilmore girls\" reboot and so many are binge-watching it this week but now guess what, you could face a tax for using streaming services like Netflix and Amazon. Look at the look on your face, George. Very upset. Does not seem right. We have the details. I mean it. This is my stress relief. Do not make my stress relief stressful. Reporter: Bad news \"Gilmore girls,\" binging on Netflix might not become quite so chill. Dozens of cities across California are considering taxing Netflix and other video streaming services. Jeepers, Terry. This is bad. Reporter: Maybe for kimmy, not for municipalities looking to recoup cash lost by all those cord cutters. Their argument we're taxed on cable TV subscriptions so why not streaming? With 47 million Netflix subscribers in the U.S. A potential tax pot of over half a billion dollars a year. These cities are trying to use a decades old utility tax to take a tax out of your websites and apps such as Netflix and hulu and possibly others. That would be bad. Oh, a disaster, ma'am. Reporter: Netflix tells us it's a dangerous precedent. It's a slippery slope. If you're going to say a website or app such as Netflix or others are utilities anything can be utility. Reporter: Pasadena considering a 9.4% levy. How much will it cost. Unacceptable. Reporter: Some in Chicago say filing a class action lawsuit after their city imposed a 9% tax on streaming services last year. In Pennsylvania, it's 6% statewide. Tell me what to do. Voters are on the side. I think the law is on our side and we'll see what happens. I feel like that story had a lot of unnecessary details in it. Reporter: For \"Good morning America,\" Nick watt, ABC news, Los Angeles. Ah, all the shows I love to watch. Clever piece but I guess a lot will depend on what the tax goes for. State to state, right. City to city and whether people 1230r it. I can afford a dollar a month -- I just want to watch \"Gilmore girls.\" Give us the buck.

      "text": "Share (Image credit: Netflix) \nDid you watch the highly anticipated Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life last week? I, for one, am thrilled with the revival; it manages to hold on to the nostalgia of the show while staying current (the sign in Luke's Diner now says \"No Man Buns\"). \nAnd while the mini-series does end with one big cliffhanger, I'm not here to talk about that. No, I've got a whole other list of (food-related) questions that need answers ASAP. \nHere are all my burning questions, separated by episode. If you haven't watched yet, there might be some spoilers; read at your own risk. Winter \n1. A nativity scene with eggplant Jesus? I'm gonna need to see that. \n2. Has anyone ever put tater tots in tacos? \n3. How can Rory and Lorelai drink coffee in the middle of the night? \n4. Do people Instagram their plates of eggs at Luke's? \n5. Did Luke add anything new to the menu (besides Rory's New Yorker piece)? \n6. Like maybe that fudgy banana milkshake? \n7. Who is inviting all these celebrity chefs to The Dragonfly Inn? Michel? \n8. How did Sookie end up at Blue Hill Farm with Dan Barber? Was she inspired after watching that episode of Chef's Table ? \n9. When was the last time Kirk changed the filter on that water pitcher? \n10. Why did Michel's husband order three pancakes on three separate plates at Luke's? \n11. Did Kirk make that glögg himself? Did he use our recipe ? Spring \n12. Who drinks a $300 bottle of wine at lunch? \n13. Where can I get a bag of profiteroles? \n14. What exactly does a vegetable cult entail? \n15. How does Paul Anka like his hanger steak cooked? \n16. Why don't they have salad bars at therapists' offices? \n17. What kind of sammies did Rachel Ray make? \n18. Who would eat a hot dog at 7:30 a.m.? \n19. Cro-dough-cake? C'mon! Summer \n20. Am I the only one who didn't know George Clooney is behind a tequila company ? \n21. Who are these obnoxious New Yorkers asking if the Dragonfly uses Pat LaFrieda meat in its burgers? \n22. Why do Rory and Lorelai bother to put their Pop-Tarts on a plate? Aren't Pop-Tarts more of a grab-and-go item? \n23. What is in those Berta puffs? \n24. What's with all the daytime Scotch? Is this Mad Men ? \n25. Do Ina Garten and Sandra Lee actually talk to each other? Fall \n26. What is the point of eating one-fourth of a bagel? \n27. Does Trader Joe's really sell three boxes of Franzia for $10? \n28. How did Rory, Logan, and Logan's crew get into Doose's after hours? \n29. How do you not spill a martini while riding on the back of a moving car? \n30. Can you really be \"coffee\" in a former life? \n31. Why don't more people have open hot dog carts at their weddings? \n32. Did Emily just pick up a half-eaten cookie at her DAR meeting? \n33. Why would cops ask you if you had pineapple juice? \n34. Where can I get the recipe for Sookie's fat-free magic granola? \n35. Emily heats her own soup? \nBonus question: Are we supposed to pretend that we don't know that Rose Abdoo, the same actress who plays Gypsy, also plays Emily's cook and maid, Berta?",

      "text": "MORE >> \nIf you’ve gotten to the end of Netflix’s Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life , chances are you have some questions. As it turns out, so does the cast. Spoilers below. \nAccording to Vulture, actor Matt Czunchry doesn’t know who the father of Rory’s surprise child is either. And he’s not eager to find out. \n“I think the intention is to keep that open,” Czunchry said. “Their intention was to leave that open and put that out in the universe for fans to talk about and debate and so I’ll kind of leave that to Amy [Sherman-Palladino] and Dan [Palladino] to say if they want to put any more clarity to that. That’s not for me to say.” 51 Photos » \nThe actor was also asked if he’d be interested in reprising his role as Logan if Gilmore Girls were to be revived again. He says at this point; he thinks everyone is finished with the show for now. “This was really a perfect storm and it felt that way. So we’d have to see what the timing was and the story was to see if it felt like it was the perfect storm again.” Czunchry says that A Year in the Life was meant to be the final four chapters of the beloved series.",

      "text": "Trades from $ 3 Digital home entertainment services and solutions provider, TiVo Corporation ( TIVO - Free Report ) has entered into a series of deals pertaining to products, licensing and intellectual property agreement with streaming video giant Netflix Inc. ( NFLX - Free Report ) . The financial terms of the deal were not disclosed.Per the product agreement, TiVo will carry on navigating user interface and will integrate web entertainment from Netflix to its set-top boxes. These services will be available to consumers through pay-TV providers and retail stores.TiVo currently provides software solutions to more than 70 Pay-TV operators across 30 countries. Therefore, the deal is expected to expand TiVo’s product offerings as well as global presence, which in turn will boost revenues.Separately in an intellectual property agreement, Netflix now has a license to TiVo patent portfolios for over-the-top (OTT) offerings.According to Tom Carson, CEO TiVo, “Our agreements with Netflix represent a major milestone for TiVo as we expand our offerings for the fast-growing OTT space, and further demonstrate our commitment to delivering innovative technologies to new and emerging markets.”We believe that an agreement through these licensing agreements would be incrementally beneficial for the company. Additionally, the deal would enhance use experience and provide the necessary competitive edge over its peers in the emerging market of online video streaming.We think competition in the online movie business is escalating and integrating Netflix will play a key role in adding subscribers and retaining existing ones. The new deal will help TiVo to remain a few notches above its peers.As stated by Bill Holmes, Netflix’s global head of business development, “Building on this history, the agreements provide consumers freedom to watch their favorite TV shows and movies whenever and wherever, with an integrated experience across more devices.” TiVo generated a year-to-date return of 24.55% compared with the Zacks Internet Services industry gain of 0.22%. Bottom Line Both TiVo and Netflix are focused on improving the viewing experience and believe that cloud or service are the most important mediums through which this goal can be achieved.We continue to believe that recent deals with leading companies coupled with new customer wins, product launches and international expansion will drive top-line growth.It should be noted that TiVo was formerly known as Rovi Corporation. Upon successfully completing the acquisition of TiVo Inc. early this September, Rovi adopted the iconic TiVo brand name.The new TiVo Corporation is now the global leader in entertainment technology and audience insights. The company has a diverse product portfolio that ranges from interactive program guide to the DVR. The combined company has emerged as the world’s leading media and entertainment provider to deliver the ultimate entertainment experience.Nonetheless, the actual synergies from the merger will take some time to reflect in the company’s performance and much depends on how successfully it integrates the legacy business of TiVo.The company faces significant competition from Alphabet Inc.’s ( GOOGL - Free Report ) Google TV, Roku and Apple Inc.’s ( AAPL - Free Report ) TV.Currently, TiVo carries a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

      "text": "11/29/2016 4:17 PM ET | Filed under: TV News • Bookz • Netflix \n  —   —   \nGraham didn't meet Alexis Bledel until after they were cast as the titular Gilmore Girls : \n\"Alexis Bledel and I met for the very first time in the lobby of a hotel in Toronto. Can you believe that? We'd both been cast in the show without ever having met. I was cast very late in the process… So there was no time for a chemistry read … There'd been no time for anyone to even see us standing side by side, just to make sure we looked related… She was only eighteen years old, but kind and curious, and beautiful of course. I had a good feeling about us from the start. We clicked as friends right away too. But it was all a stroke of luck!\" \nGraham almost had to drop out of the show: \n\"A few months later, the show was picked up, which was exciting but also worrisome, because I wasn't actually available to do it. I was still on another show, Don Roos 's M.Y.O.B. for NBC. I'd been cast in Gilmore Girls in second position, meaning that if NBC decided they wanted to keep going with M.Y.O.B., I'd have to be replaced on Gilmore Girls .\" \nLuke wasn't originally Lorelai's love interest: \n\"Wow. Scott Patterson. You know, that part wasn't necessarily the inevitable love interest for Lorelai that it became. He was simply Cute Grouchy Diner Owner in the beginning, and it could have gone in any number of directions, but Luke took on a more important role because of Scott's special sexiness, which was mixed with a gruffness that was the perfect contrast to Lorelai's chirpy cheerfulness.\" \nGetting those effortless Lorelai curls required a bit of effort: \n\"The color was just one of my hair issues. My hair is naturally curly and extremely sensitive to the weather. This means that in order for me to wear it curly, it has to first be straightened, then curled, which sort of defeats the whole supposed \"luck\" of having naturally curly hair in the first place. So figuring out how best to make it last throughout a fourteen-hour day took some experimentation over the years.\" \nKelly Bishop thought Graham should date longtime boyfriend Peter Krause years before they got together: \n\"From the start of the show Kelly [Bishop] named herself my TVM, or TV mom, by which she meant she was taking her character's role seriously, beyond the pages or sets and out into the real world… In a maternal, protective way, she found most of my boyfriends at the time lacking, and once told me I needed someone who was more my equal, like ‘that wonderful actor on Six Feet Under .'\" \nGraham's real family members made cameos as background actors throughout the series: \n\"Over the years, many family members made cameos, in fact. My cousin Tim still talks about his favorite episode: ‘The one about the guy carrying flowers through the lobby of the Dragonfly.' He (obviously) starred in it as the guy.\" \nGraham was NOT a fan of Lorelai and Rory's season 6 fight any more than you were: \n\"I have to admit I struggled with the Lorelai/Rory separation. It went on for a while, and Lorelai was so crabby with her for several episodes, not to mention that I missed my favorite scene partner…I remember talking about it with Amy, who felt it was important developmentally that this always-close relationship hit a significant growing pain. Still, I felt bad in scenes where I kept holding a grudge.\" \nShe actually forgot Lorelai got married because it felt so out of character: \n\"Christopher and Lorelai get married in Paris. Okay. I have to admit, this seemed so odd to me back then (especially after all that time apart; I just don't think Lorelai would get married without Rory present) that I somehow managed to completely forget it ever happened.\" \nShe admits Season 7 didn't have the same magic as the rest of the series: \n\"Our new show runners were talented writers who knew the show well. But just like when David Lee Roth was replaced as the lead singer of Van Halen, no matter how hard we tried singing the same songs, they just didn't sound quite the same.\" \nMost of the cast had NO idea the show was cancelled after Season 7: \n\"That day, I was told that I was the first to know [the show was over], and was asked to wait before reaching out to anyone. I assumed this meant everyone would be getting a call, and given the size of the cast, they needed time to do that. But I found out much later that Alexis and I were the only cast members who were officially informed, and others found out in far less conventional ways. Ed Herrmann learned the show was canceled from the clerk at his video store in Connecticut, for example. If I had it to do over again, I'd have called everyone myself, and thrown a party too.\" \nAlexis Bledel is Rory IRL and talked Graham out of getting a tattoo: \n\"I was prattling on to Alexis about the possibility of getting a tattoo and the exciting potential of designing in myself, because, I explained, that's where the real fun was, the real artistry….After I went on and on about my fantasy post-tattoo life for a while, Alexis smiled and gently said, ‘So, what would you get? A shamrock?'… After my embarrassment faded, I realized I didn't want a tattoo anymore. Why? Because through her (more mature) eyes I suddenly saw the inherent futility of it.\" \nTalking As Fast As I Can is available today in bookstores everywhere! You know, in case you want to check for some hot Parenthood gossip…",

      "text": "Lauren Graham wasn’t exactly ecstatic about the ending of Netflix’s Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life when she admitted on Today , “I did not know the four words until halfway through filming of this iteration of the series, and I, too, was like, Huh? Really? Huh.”\nNot a glowing review, but “Huh? Really? Huh.” has been the response to most big events in 2016. Graham, who was nominated for a Golden Globe for her performance as Lorelai Gilmore, was joined by castmates Kelly Bishop, Scott Patterson, and Alexis Bledel, via phone, on the set of Today to discuss the new mini-series that returns us to Stars Hollow for four more 90-minute episodes that have been delighting Gilmore Girls and Boys alike. The hot topic for all fans has been the cliffhanger ending. Bishop, who played Gilmore matriarch Emily, echoed Graham’s confusion, “I did ask Alexis. I thought somebody’s got to tell me. I asked her, and my reaction was — huh.”\nThere were even comparisons to another much beloved series that ended on a strange note, as Graham said, “Someone compared it to the end of The Sopranos which left a little bit of a question if the air. Which was similarly controversial, yet perhaps artistically satisfying. I don’t know.”\nAlexis Bledel didn’t get a chance to weigh in on Today , but the previous night, she told Jimmy Fallon on The Tonight Show that she was “shocked” when she heard about the ending.\nSo, underwhelmed, shocked, and “huh?” That’s the casts’ feedback to the final four words of a mini-series nearly a decade in the making. And Gilmore Girls creator Amy Sherman-Palladino has been planning on ending the series this way since at least April 2006. When Michael Ausiello of TV Guide asked, “If next year is the final year, will you tell me what those last two words were?” She responded, “Yes, I will. I promise you. You’ve got my word… Last four words, actually.” But Sherman-Palladino left Gilmore Girls before the final broadcast season, and her final words weren’t uttered until ten years later.\nBut what were those final four words? If you must know — AND YOU DON’T MIND SPOILERS — they were…\nRory: Mom.\nLorelai: Yeah?\nRory: I’m pregnant.\nGilmore Girls: A Year in the Life is now streaming on Netflix.\nWhen Guys Watch ‘Gilmore Girls,’ This Is What Happens…\nTell us what you think! Did you think the final four words of Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life made for a satisfying ending? Were you underwhelmed, shocked, or would you have preferred something like “Are face tattoos permanent?” Or “A dog is president!” as the final four.

      "text": "23 'Gilmore Girls' references you may have missed in the Netflix revival   11:33 AM Megan Willett, INSIDER - Business Insider \nWarning: Spoilers ahead for \"Gilmore Girls: A Year In The Life.\" \nNetflix's revival of \"Gilmore Girls: A Year In The Life\" is now officially streaming. \nThe show likely made many fans feel happy and nostalgic — those four last words aside — while also moving the characters forward in a satisfying way. \nThere were also plenty of references to the series that may have gone over your head unless you're a die-hard fan. Keep reading so you can go back and catch them all. Let’s start with a classic: \"I smell snow,\" Lorelai tells Rory in the town square. Netflix Fans of the original series know that Lorelai has a keen sense for smelling when snow is about to fall. Lorelai smelling the first snow of the year.Warner Bros. \nIn episode eight of the first season, Lorelai tells Rory how much she loves the snow and that she can smell when it's coming. \nShe also says every good thing that's ever happened to her — her first kiss, Rory's first steps, her best birthday — happened when it was snowing. Lorelai is worried that celebrity chef Roy Choi is going to burn down the Dragonfly Inn's kitchen. Netflix \nLorelai has an ever revolving door of chefs coming in and out as she tries to replace her beloved best friend and the inn's chef, Sookie (Melissa McCarthy), during the revival. In the original series, the inn where Lorelai, Michele, and Sookie worked did burn down. Warner Bros. \nWhile working at the Independence Inn, a faulty wire causes a fire to break out and the Inn got shut down. \nIt eventually spurs Lorelai and Sookie to open the Dragonfly Inn together. Emily's new maid Berta is actually played by a Stars Hollow favorite. Netflix That's right — Rose Abdoo, who plays Gypsy in the series, also plays Berta! Netflix \n\"Rose read it for fun in a table read because they hadn't cast it yet, and she was so hilarious they had to double her up,\" Lauren Graham (Lorelai) tweeted about the casting. Gypsy tells Lorelai to buy a new car after fixing her Jeep Wrangler in \"Spring.\" Netflix Everyone should know by now that Lorelai will never get a new car. Warner Bros. \nIn season seven, Lorelai tries to buy a new car, but discovers that she doesn't like any car but her beloved Jeep. \nThe frustrating process of trying to find a car she likes ends up fixing her friendship with Luke, who ends up convincing Gypsy to install a new engine into her old car. There are also a few Easter eggs from the show at Richard's funeral, including a record Rory gave him. Netflix During the first season, Lorelai isn't sure what to get her father. She asks Rory, who says she got him \"Chuck Berry: Live at the Fillmore.\" Netflix and Wikimedia Commons \nThat album is on a table at the funeral, a touching reminder of Rory's relationship with her grandfather. And this picture was from the wedding vow renewal episode, which was also the \"Gilmore Girls\" 100th episode. Netflix The episode was called \"Wedding Bell Blues\" and it was a huge hit with critics and a wonderful glimpse into Emily and Richard's marriage. Warner Bros When Emily is Kondo-ing her home, she tells Lorelai: \"I was married for 50 years, half of me is gone.\" Netflix This bit of dialogue is a touching tribute to actor Edward Hermann. Netflix \nEdward Hermann played Richard Gilmore, the patriarch of the Gilmore family for the series' run. Hermann died in 2014 before the revival could happen. \nThe 50 year mark coincides with when Hermann died in real life: Emily and Richard married in 1964 and Hermann passed away in 2014. In the revival, Richard died in 2016, which means he and Emily would actually have been married for about 52 years. \nHonoring his actual passing could be a subtle nod to the actor from showrunner and creator Amy Sherman-Palladino. The Town Troubadour chases a competing singer through Stars Hollow. Netflix \nHe's played by singer-songwriter Grant-Lee Phillips. It mirrors a plotline from season one when the Town Troubadour becomes the only Town Troubadour. Warner Bros. \nThe Town Troubadour faces off against a rival Troubadour in season one of the series. During a town meeting, the issue is brought up and eventually, it's decided that the original Town Troubadour will be the official Town Troubadour. \nIn season six, he's tapped to tour with Neil Young, prompting a flock of hopeful singers to turn up in Stars Hollow to try and get discovered themselves. Eventually, the Town Troubadour returns and reclaims his rightful post. We finally saw Lane's dad, Mr. Kim, after all these years. Netflix \nFans have wondered for years about Lane's dad — where was he and why did we never see him? \nThis seemed like a very bizarre throwaway moment in the revival, but at least we know he's alive and well. Lorelai has another dream about Paul Anka, the dog and the man. Netflix \nShe tells Rory it's the third one she's had this year. Season six is when Lorelai has her first dream about Paul Anka. Warner Bros. The Gilmore Guys were invited to be a part of the revival. Netflix and Gilmore Guys/Facebook \n\"Gilmore Guys\" is a popular podcast that takes a deep dive into each \"Gilmore Girls\" episode. The pair kept it a secret from fans until the trailer debuted. Richard's will sets money aside for Luke to franchise Luke's Diner. Netflix \nIn the revival, Emily convinces Luke to look at possible locations with her. This plot line also played out in season five. Richard makes the suggestion when he and Luke go golfing at his club. Warner Bros. \nLuke frantically calls Lorelai after he golfs with her father and tells her, \"Your father wants to open up a chain of Luke’s Diners, and I think I agreed to it.\" \n\"There’s going to be seven of them, and that’s just on the eastern seaboard. Then, I’m going national,\" he says. \"I’ve already got a marketing guy, Herb’s my banker, your father is taking care of all my insurance needs, and apparently, everyone is going to be able to buy stock!\" \nLorelai eventually calms Luke down and straightens everything out with her father, but it appears Richard never let the dream die. Lorelai uses \"alumnus\" wrong. Netflix \nWhen she talks to Rory while she's at her Chilton alumni event, she asks \"How's my little alumnus doing?\" \nBut she should know that's not the proper term by now. When Rory was still in high school, she taught her mom the difference between alumna, alumni, and alumnus. Warner Bros. \nRory is preparing to meet a Harvard alumnus, and Lorelai begins teasing her: LORELAI: So, alumna is a girl graduate. RORY: Right. LORELAI: And alumnus is a man. RORY: Singular. LORELAI: So an unmarried man? RORY: No, not not-married. He can be married or single, all alumnus means is one man singular as opposed to many men plural. LORELAI: And plural is alumni. RORY: Right, and that can be girls and guys. LORELAI: Kinky! RORY: No, not kinky, just what it is. \nIt appears she forgot this lesson. The Chilton bathroom scene in the revival is a direct callback to season three. Netflix \nIn this scene, Paris mentions Chilton's uniform hemlines, Rory and Francie teaming up, and student council, practically all in one breath. The Chilton bathroom in the original series is where Francie intimidated Rory and tried to get her to vote for higher hemlines. Warner Bros. \nWhile Rory serves as vice president on student council, the girls' bathroom at Chilton becomes a virtual war room as Francie tries to manipulate Rory to go against Paris's wishes and vote for higher hemlines. Rory eventually stands up to Francie in the same bathroom. \nSeeing all three characters together again in one place was quite fun for fans. Taylor Doose references the Lazy-Hazy-Crazy Days of Summer event in \"Summer.\" Netflix It's from the first episode of season three when Taylor hires a choir to sing \"Lazy-Hazy-Crazy Days of Summer\" on repeat. Warner Bros. \nThe whole town gets the song stuck in their heads and are miserable. \n\"Oh, hey, I figured how to get the 'Lazy-Hazy-Crazy Days of Summer' out of our heads — to sing the 'Small World' song over and over for the next 48 hours,\" Lorelai says. \"Of course, how we get the 'Small World' song out of our heads, I have not worked out yet.\" Carole King sings \"Feel The Earth Move Under My Feet\" and no one recognizes it. Netflix \nKing plays Sophie, the sister of the Town Troubadour who owns a music store in town. \nIn the revival, she reprises her role and volunteers an \"original song\" that she says she's been working on — \"Feel The Earth Move Under My Feet\" — for Taylor to use. The fact that no one recognizes the song is a cute nod to the \"Gilmore Girls\" theme song. Warner Bros. \n\"Where You Lead,\" the famous \"Gilmore Girls\" theme song, was written by King. It's implied in the revival that in the world of \"Gilmore Girls,\" Carole King and her music don't exist. \nTaylor deems Sophie's song \"Feel The Earth Move Under My Feet\" not catchy enough. Logan and his friends show up to Stars Hollow wearing gorilla masks. Netflix The scene was an homage to when Rory first entered Logan's circle after she sees a girl wearing a gorilla mask. Warner Bros. \nRory first finds out about the Life and Death Brigade — the secret society at Yale that Logan is a part of — when a girl wearing a gorilla mask wanders into her bathroom. \nShe decides to investigate for the Yale Daily News, and ends up getting closer to Logan in the process. When Rory goes into Richard's study, you can see her painting above his desk. Netflix Emily had the portrait done in season one. It was Lorelai who suggested Rory read a book while she's posing. Warner Bros. \nRichard loved the painting, and showing his study exactly as he left it was likely another nod to Edward Shermann, who played Richard. Of course Miss Celine helps dress Lorelai for her wedding. Netflix Miss Celine was famous for her taste in fashion — not to mention telling everyone what celebrity they look like. Warner Bros. \nShe was Emily's personal stylist on the series and decided Rory looked like Audrey Hepburn while Lorelai looked like Natalie Wood. When Emily repeatedly tells Lorelai \"You need money\" in \"Fall,\" it's a direct tie to the first episode of \"Gilmore Girls.\" Netflix \nIn the revival, Lorelai needs money to help expand the Dragonfly Inn. Emily agrees, on the condition that Lorelai and Luke visit her every year in Nantucket. Richard originally said \"You need money\" multiple times when Lorelai asks her parents for a loan for Rory's Chilton education. Warner Bros. \nThey decide that Lorelai and Rory will also visit every Friday night for dinner as a part of the arangement. It's the start of a very complicated relationship between the four of them. \nYou can read more about the scene here. Rory shows Dean corn starch before he leave's Doose's Market after they run into each other in \"Fall.\" Netflix Dean tells her to pay for it this time — it's a reference to their first kiss. Netflix \nRory pretended she was buying corn starch when she was really looking at Dean at Doose's Market. She ended up taking the corn starch home with her accidentally after they kissed. Sookie makes a bunch of wedding cakes for Lorelai, and one of them is covered in daisies. Netflix Daisies are Lorelai's favorite flower. Warner Bros. \nIn the first season finale of \"Gilmoe Girls,\" Lorelai tells her then-boyfriend Max (Scott Cohen) that a proposal should have, \"a thousand yellow daisies, and candles, and a horse.\" \nMax takes Lorelai at her word and proposes with a thousand yellow daisies. Though the pair never got married, it was one of the show's most romantic moments. While they're getting ready for the wedding in the revival, eagle-eyed fans can spot this picture of Rory's 16th birthday by Jess's elbow. Netflix It's a picture from season one when Lorelai throws Rory a birthday party in their home. It's a nice reference to how far the series has come. Warner Bros.

      "text": "On November 25, Netflix released its four-episode Gilmore Girls revival subtitled, “A Year in the Life.” As fans trek back to Stars Hollow to revisit the complicated relationships of three generations of Gilmore women, as well as the friends who orbit them, they must be forewarned: Co-creators Amy Sherman-Palladino and her husband, Daniel Palladino, who each wrote two episodes, have over-stuffed the episodes with pop-culture arcana.\nBy our count approximately 250 literary, film, music, television and other pop-culture items are referenced either directly or indirectly. The dialogue is denser than Rebecca Howe’s mane with pop culture allusions, and if you did not catch that reference, then you will be deeper in over your head than Jack Dawson after he said farewell to Rose. You’ll be more lost than those kids from Blair Witch Project . More up a creek than David Strathairn in The River Wild .\nWe have come to help. Below is Part 1 of our “Pop Culture Companion to the Gilmore Girls Revival.” We will present it in four sections, corresponding to each episode, in the chronological order in which the references appear. Now before we begin: Coffee?\nThe four-episode \"Gilmore Girls\" revival is more jam-packed with pop culture arcana than an anthology of Dennis Miller rants.

      "text": "Superfan TV • November 29, 2016 Lauren Graham wasn’t exactly ecstatic about the ending of Netflix’s Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life when she admitted on Today , “I did not know the four words until halfway through filming of this iteration of the series, and I, too, was like, Huh? Really? Huh.” Not a glowing review, but “Huh? Really? Huh.” has been the response to most big events in 2016. Graham, who was nominated for a Golden Globe for her performance as Lorelai Gilmore, was joined by castmates Kelly Bishop, Scott Patterson, and Alexis Bledel, via phone, on the set of Today to discuss the new mini-series that returns us to Stars Hollow for four more 90-minute episodes that have been delighting Gilmore Girls and Boys alike. The hot topic for all fans has been the cliffhanger ending. Bishop, who played Gilmore matriarch Emily, echoed Graham’s confusion, “I did ask Alexis. I thought somebody’s got to tell me. I asked her, and my reaction was — huh.” There were even comparisons to another much beloved series that ended on a strange note, as Graham said, “Someone compared it to the end of The Sopranos which left a little bit of a question if the air. Which was similarly controversial, yet perhaps artistically satisfying. I don’t know.” Alexis Bledel didn’t get a chance to weigh in on Today , but the previous night, she told Jimmy Fallon on The Tonight Show that she was “shocked” when she heard about the ending. So, underwhelmed, shocked, and “huh?” That’s the casts’ feedback to the final four words of a mini-series nearly a decade in the making. And Gilmore Girls creator Amy Sherman-Palladino has been planning on ending the series this way since at least April 2006. When Michael Ausiello of TV Guide asked, “If next year is the final year, will you tell me what those last two words were?” She responded, “Yes, I will. I promise you. You’ve got my word… Last four words, actually.” But Sherman-Palladino left Gilmore Girls before the final broadcast season, and her final words weren’t uttered until ten years later. But what were those final four words? If you must know — AND YOU DON’T MIND SPOILERS — they were… Rory: Mom.",

      "text": "  3 Surprising Reasons Netflix, Amazon and Broadcast Execs Will Skip January TCA`1\\   TV executives have a message for the winter TCA: No thanks.\nTop programmers from ABC, CBS, NBC and Fox won’t come to Pasadena, California, in January to answer reporters’ questions at the Television Critics Association Winter press tour, the association revealed Tuesday. That marks the first time in at least 20 years the brass will skip the event (except for 2008, when the entire January tour was sacked due to the writers’ strike).\nThe broadcasters will still offer panels to promote individual shows, but reporters will have to chase the executives through the swanky corridors of the Langham Huntington Hotel if they want an interview. That’s still more access than Amazon is providing, though — TCA also announced that the streaming provider, home to the acclaimed “Transparent” and other fare, is bailing on the event entirely. Netflix, home of “House of Cards” and other critical favorites, previously revealed it’s not planning to attend, either.\n\nAlso Read: Amazon Bows Out of TCA Winter Press Tour Along With Broadcast Executives \nWhat gives? Why, during this supposed Golden Age of TV, are the biggest purveyors of original programming squelching an opportunity to get in front of the media?\nChalk it up to the immense changes seizing the worlds of entertainment and journalism, shifts that are making many industry veterans question the utility of the TCA events themselves.\n  The old media world is dying\nWhen newspapers were the main news providers, network executives saw the TCAs as the most cost-effective way of getting the word out about new shows. Critics from around the country would pile into ballrooms in Beverly Hills or Pasadena, pepper stars and execs with questions and then save up stories that they would publish back home as the new shows premiered.\n\nAlso Read: 11 TCA Takeaways: Diversity Still Not Diverse Enough, Rape Repulses, Nerds Rule TV \nNow, newspapers have been decimated by online competitors and plummeting ad sales. The press tour is now filled with far fewer critics from hometown papers and many more bloggers and “genre press” from sites that only fanboys and fangirls have heard of. There are multiple representatives of Hollywood trades such as, yes, TheWrap. These outlets cover the networks and their shows like a blanket all year long. Why do the networks need to spend six-figure sums to reach them? What’s the point of putting executives in front of reporters?\nIt’s about the shows\nTCA is the source of a disconnect for journalists and TV executives. Reporters see it as opportunity to probe, ask questions, hold executives’ feet to the fire. But for networks, it’s a marketing and PR opportunity, pure and simple. From the executives’ perspective, it makes far more sense to spend their limited time at TCA promoting an actual show that may benefit from some media exposure, rather than taking a bunch of questions about the inside baseball of scheduling or ratings for on-demand viewing. The decision comes down to dollars and cents: One broadcast exec told TheWrap that each day of TCA can cost a network up to $1 million for hotel fees, flights for incoming cast members, food for critics and more.\n“We want TCA to be more about the shows,” one network exec told TheWrap (like everyone else interviewed for this story, the source spoke on condition of anonymity). “There’s more midseason shows now and not more time to present them.”\nTired of the grilling\nIt’s no secret that many executives hate TCA — or at least, hate their sessions in front of reporters. “How lovely to see you all again,” former UPN boss Dean Valentine (a former journalist himself) would purr sarcastically as his exec session began at every TCA back in the day.\n\nAlso Read: 13 New Fall TV Shows, Ranked From Best to Worst by Critics (Photos) \nRelations haven’t gotten any warmer lately. Glenn Geller of CBS last summer was raked by harsh questions about the diversity of programming on his network. HBO’s Casey Bloys caught flak over the sex and violence in the premium cable network’s shows. These types of exchanges may provide great copy for journalists.\n“But what,” one network executive asked, “am I getting out of it?”\nFor now, networks insist that they aren’t ready to bag their TCA involvement entirely. But the future is uncertain.\n“In age when you can Facebook Live, and I can stream the talent to you, and you can sit in bed and watch … Is this the most logical way to do this?,” one executive said of the press tour.\nFor now, the networks are taking a wait-and-see attitude. But if the lack of executive sessions translates into empty ballrooms for the show panels come January, one executive has a stark warning:\n“We will just not do press tour anymore,” this person said.\nRead original story 3 Surprising Reasons Netflix, Amazon and Broadcast Execs Will Skip January TCA`1\\ At TheWrap",

That’s still more access than Amazon is providing, though — TCA also announced that the streaming provider, home to the acclaimed “Transparent” and other fare, is bailing on the event entirely. Netflix, home of “House of Cards” and other critical favorites, previously revealed it’s not planning to attend, either.

Why, during this supposed Golden Age of TV, are the biggest purveyors of original programming squelching an opportunity to get in front of the media? \nChalk it up to the immense changes seizing the worlds of entertainment and journalism, shifts that are making many industry veterans question the utility of the TCA events themselves.   \nThe old media world is dying When newspapers were the main news providers, network executives saw the TCAs as the most cost-effective way of getting the word out about new shows. Critics from around the country would pile into ballrooms in Beverly Hills or Pasadena, pepper stars and execs with questions and then save up stories that they would publish back home as the new shows premiered.

The press tour is now filled with far fewer critics from hometown papers and many more bloggers and “genre press” from sites that only fanboys and fangirls have heard of. There are multiple representatives of Hollywood trades such as, yes, TheWrap. These outlets cover the networks and their shows like a blanket all year long. Why do the networks need to spend six-figure sums to reach them? What’s the point of putting executives in front of reporters? \nIt’s about the shows TCA is the source of a disconnect for journalists and TV executives. Reporters see it as opportunity to probe, ask questions, hold executives’ feet to the fire. But for networks, it’s a marketing and PR opportunity, pure and simple. From the executives’ perspective, it makes far more sense to spend their limited time at TCA promoting an actual show that may benefit from some media exposure, rather than taking a bunch of questions about the inside baseball of scheduling or ratings for on-demand viewing. The decision comes down to dollars and cents: One broadcast exec told TheWrap that each day of TCA can cost a network up to $1 million for hotel fees, flights for incoming cast members, food for critics and more. \n“We want TCA to be more about the shows,” one network exec told TheWrap (like everyone else interviewed for this story, the source spoke on condition of anonymity). “There’s more midseason shows now and not more time to present them.” \nTired of the grilling It’s no secret that many executives hate TCA — or at least, hate their sessions in front of reporters. “How lovely to see you all again,” former UPN boss Dean Valentine (a former journalist himself) would purr sarcastically as his exec session began at every TCA back in the day.

Glenn Geller of CBS last summer was raked by harsh questions about the diversity of programming on his network. HBO’s Casey Bloys caught flak over the sex and violence in the premium cable network’s shows. These types of exchanges may provide great copy for journalists. \n“But what,” one network executive asked, “am I getting out of it?” \nFor now, networks insist that they aren’t ready to bag their TCA involvement entirely. But the future is uncertain. \n“In age when you can Facebook Live, and I can stream the talent to you, and you can sit in bed and watch … Is this the most logical way to do this?,” one executive said of the press tour. \nFor now, the networks are taking a wait-and-see attitude. But if the lack of executive sessions translates into empty ballrooms for the show panels come January, one executive has a stark warning: \n“We will just not do press tour anymore,” this person said. \nRead original story 3 Surprising Reasons Netflix, Amazon and Broadcast Execs Will Skip January TCA At TheWrap Latest from the SFGATE homepage: Click below for the top news from around the Bay Area and beyond.

      "text": "23 'Gilmore Girls' references you may have missed in the Netflix revival Tuesday Nov 29, 2016 at 11:33 AM Megan Willett, INSIDER - Business Insider \nWarning: Spoilers ahead for \"Gilmore Girls: A Year In The Life.\" \nNetflix's revival of \"Gilmore Girls: A Year In The Life\" is now officially streaming. \nThe show likely made many fans feel happy and nostalgic — those four last words aside — while also moving the characters forward in a satisfying way. \nThere were also plenty of references to the series that may have gone over your head unless you're a die-hard fan. Keep reading so you can go back and catch them all. Let’s start with a classic: \"I smell snow,\" Lorelai tells Rory in the town square. Netflix Fans of the original series know that Lorelai has a keen sense for smelling when snow is about to fall. Lorelai smelling the first snow of the year.Warner Bros. \nIn episode eight of the first season, Lorelai tells Rory how much she loves the snow and that she can smell when it's coming. \nShe also says every good thing that's ever happened to her — her first kiss, Rory's first steps, her best birthday — happened when it was snowing. Lorelai is worried that celebrity chef Roy Choi is going to burn down the Dragonfly Inn's kitchen. Netflix \nLorelai has an ever revolving door of chefs coming in and out as she tries to replace her beloved best friend and the inn's chef, Sookie (Melissa McCarthy), during the revival. In the original series, the inn where Lorelai, Michele, and Sookie worked did burn down. Warner Bros. \nWhile working at the Independence Inn, a faulty wire causes a fire to break out and the Inn got shut down. \nIt eventually spurs Lorelai and Sookie to open the Dragonfly Inn together. Emily's new maid Berta is actually played by a Stars Hollow favorite. Netflix That's right — Rose Abdoo, who plays Gypsy in the series, also plays Berta! Netflix \n\"Rose read it for fun in a table read because they hadn't cast it yet, and she was so hilarious they had to double her up,\" Lauren Graham (Lorelai) tweeted about the casting. Gypsy tells Lorelai to buy a new car after fixing her Jeep Wrangler in \"Spring.\" Netflix Everyone should know by now that Lorelai will never get a new car. Warner Bros. \nIn season seven, Lorelai tries to buy a new car, but discovers that she doesn't like any car but her beloved Jeep. \nThe frustrating process of trying to find a car she likes ends up fixing her friendship with Luke, who ends up convincing Gypsy to install a new engine into her old car. There are also a few Easter eggs from the show at Richard's funeral, including a record Rory gave him. Netflix During the first season, Lorelai isn't sure what to get her father. She asks Rory, who says she got him \"Chuck Berry: Live at the Fillmore.\" Netflix and Wikimedia Commons \nThat album is on a table at the funeral, a touching reminder of Rory's relationship with her grandfather. And this picture was from the wedding vow renewal episode, which was also the \"Gilmore Girls\" 100th episode. Netflix The episode was called \"Wedding Bell Blues\" and it was a huge hit with critics and a wonderful glimpse into Emily and Richard's marriage. Warner Bros When Emily is Kondo-ing her home, she tells Lorelai: \"I was married for 50 years, half of me is gone.\" Netflix This bit of dialogue is a touching tribute to actor Edward Hermann. Netflix \nEdward Hermann played Richard Gilmore, the patriarch of the Gilmore family for the series' run. Hermann died in 2014 before the revival could happen. \nThe 50 year mark coincides with when Hermann died in real life: Emily and Richard married in 1964 and Hermann passed away in 2014. In the revival, Richard died in 2016, which means he and Emily would actually have been married for about 52 years. \nHonoring his actual passing could be a subtle nod to the actor from showrunner and creator Amy Sherman-Palladino. The Town Troubadour chases a competing singer through Stars Hollow. Netflix \nHe's played by singer-songwriter Grant-Lee Phillips. It mirrors a plotline from season one when the Town Troubadour becomes the only Town Troubadour. Warner Bros. \nThe Town Troubadour faces off against a rival Troubadour in season one of the series. During a town meeting, the issue is brought up and eventually, it's decided that the original Town Troubadour will be the official Town Troubadour. \nIn season six, he's tapped to tour with Neil Young, prompting a flock of hopeful singers to turn up in Stars Hollow to try and get discovered themselves. Eventually, the Town Troubadour returns and reclaims his rightful post. We finally saw Lane's dad, Mr. Kim, after all these years. Netflix \nFans have wondered for years about Lane's dad — where was he and why did we never see him? \nThis seemed like a very bizarre throwaway moment in the revival, but at least we know he's alive and well. Lorelai has another dream about Paul Anka, the dog and the man. Netflix \nShe tells Rory it's the third one she's had this year. Season six is when Lorelai has her first dream about Paul Anka. Warner Bros. The Gilmore Guys were invited to be a part of the revival. Netflix and Gilmore Guys/Facebook \n\"Gilmore Guys\" is a popular podcast that takes a deep dive into each \"Gilmore Girls\" episode. The pair kept it a secret from fans until the trailer debuted. Richard's will sets money aside for Luke to franchise Luke's Diner. Netflix \nIn the revival, Emily convinces Luke to look at possible locations with her. This plot line also played out in season five. Richard makes the suggestion when he and Luke go golfing at his club. Warner Bros. \nLuke frantically calls Lorelai after he golfs with her father and tells her, \"Your father wants to open up a chain of Luke’s Diners, and I think I agreed to it.\" \n\"There’s going to be seven of them, and that’s just on the eastern seaboard. Then, I’m going national,\" he says. \"I’ve already got a marketing guy, Herb’s my banker, your father is taking care of all my insurance needs, and apparently, everyone is going to be able to buy stock!\" \nLorelai eventually calms Luke down and straightens everything out with her father, but it appears Richard never let the dream die. Lorelai uses \"alumnus\" wrong. Netflix \nWhen she talks to Rory while she's at her Chilton alumni event, she asks \"How's my little alumnus doing?\" \nBut she should know that's not the proper term by now. When Rory was still in high school, she taught her mom the difference between alumna, alumni, and alumnus. Warner Bros. \nRory is preparing to meet a Harvard alumnus, and Lorelai begins teasing her: LORELAI: So, alumna is a girl graduate. RORY: Right. LORELAI: And alumnus is a man. RORY: Singular. LORELAI: So an unmarried man? RORY: No, not not-married. He can be married or single, all alumnus means is one man singular as opposed to many men plural. LORELAI: And plural is alumni. RORY: Right, and that can be girls and guys. LORELAI: Kinky! RORY: No, not kinky, just what it is. \nIt appears she forgot this lesson. The Chilton bathroom scene in the revival is a direct callback to season three. Netflix \nIn this scene, Paris mentions Chilton's uniform hemlines, Rory and Francie teaming up, and student council, practically all in one breath. The Chilton bathroom in the original series is where Francie intimidated Rory and tried to get her to vote for higher hemlines. Warner Bros. \nWhile Rory serves as vice president on student council, the girls' bathroom at Chilton becomes a virtual war room as Francie tries to manipulate Rory to go against Paris's wishes and vote for higher hemlines. Rory eventually stands up to Francie in the same bathroom. \nSeeing all three characters together again in one place was quite fun for fans. Taylor Doose references the Lazy-Hazy-Crazy Days of Summer event in \"Summer.\" Netflix It's from the first episode of season three when Taylor hires a choir to sing \"Lazy-Hazy-Crazy Days of Summer\" on repeat. Warner Bros. \nThe whole town gets the song stuck in their heads and are miserable. \n\"Oh, hey, I figured how to get the 'Lazy-Hazy-Crazy Days of Summer' out of our heads — to sing the 'Small World' song over and over for the next 48 hours,\" Lorelai says. \"Of course, how we get the 'Small World' song out of our heads, I have not worked out yet.\" Carole King sings \"Feel The Earth Move Under My Feet\" and no one recognizes it. Netflix \nKing plays Sophie, the sister of the Town Troubadour who owns a music store in town. \nIn the revival, she reprises her role and volunteers an \"original song\" that she says she's been working on — \"Feel The Earth Move Under My Feet\" — for Taylor to use. The fact that no one recognizes the song is a cute nod to the \"Gilmore Girls\" theme song. Warner Bros. \n\"Where You Lead,\" the famous \"Gilmore Girls\" theme song, was written by King. It's implied in the revival that in the world of \"Gilmore Girls,\" Carole King and her music don't exist. \nTaylor deems Sophie's song \"Feel The Earth Move Under My Feet\" not catchy enough. Logan and his friends show up to Stars Hollow wearing gorilla masks. Netflix The scene was an homage to when Rory first entered Logan's circle after she sees a girl wearing a gorilla mask. Warner Bros. \nRory first finds out about the Life and Death Brigade —the secret society at Yale that Logan is a part of — when a girl wearing a gorilla mask wanders into her bathroom. \nShe decides to investigate for the Yale Daily News, and ends up getting closer to Logan in the process. When Rory goes into Richard's study, you can see her painting above his desk. Netflix Emily had the portrait done in season one. It was Lorelai who suggested Rory read a book while she's posing. Warner Bros. \nRichard loved the painting, and showing his study exactly as he left it was likely another nod to Edward Shermann, who played Richard. Of course Miss Celine helps dress Lorelai for her wedding. Netflix Miss Celine was famous for her taste in fashion — not to mention telling everyone what celebrity they look like. Warner Bros. \nShe was Emily's personal stylist on the series and decided Rory looked like Audrey Hepburn while Lorelai looked like Natalie Wood. When Emily repeatedly tells Lorelai \"You need money\" in \"Fall,\" it's a direct tie to the first episode of \"Gilmore Girls.\" Netflix \nIn the revival, Lorelai needs money to help expand the Dragonfly Inn. Emily agrees, on the condition that Lorelai and Luke visit her every year in Nantucket. Richard originally said \"You need money\" multiple times when Lorelai asks her parents for a loan for Rory's Chilton education. Warner Bros. \nThey decide that Lorelai and Rory will also visit every Friday night for dinner as a part of the arangement. It's the start of a very complicated relationship between the four of them. \nYou can read more about the scene here. Rory shows Dean corn starch before he leave's Doose's Market after they run into each other in \"Fall.\" Netflix Dean tells her to pay for it this time — it's a reference to their first kiss. Netflix \nRory pretended she was buying corn starch when she was really looking at Dean at Doose's Market. She ended up taking the corn starch home with her accidentally after they kissed. Sookie makes a bunch of wedding cakes for Lorelai, and one of them is covered in daisies. Netflix Daisies are Lorelai's favorite flower. Warner Bros. \nIn the first season finale of \"Gilmoe Girls,\" Lorelai tells her then-boyfriend Max (Scott Cohen) that a proposal should have, \"a thousand yellow daisies, and candles, and a horse.\" \nMax takes Lorelai at her word and proposes with a thousand yellow daisies. Though the pair never got married, it was one of the show's most romantic moments. While they're getting ready for the wedding in the revival, eagle-eyed fans can spot this picture of Rory's 16th birthday by Jess's elbow. Netflix It's a picture from season one when Lorelai throws Rory a birthday party in their home. It's a nice reference to how far the series has come. Warner Bros.

      "text": "President Barack Obama, set to leave the Oval Office in about two months, is known as the United States' first black president. To some, however, it is Obama's mixed-race identity that resonates most.\nThis is the case for Devon Terrell, a 24-year-old Australian actor, who is portraying Obama in the Netflix biopic Barry . The film follows the journey of a young Obama — the son of a white mother and a Kenyan father — who is searching for his place in America as a Columbia University student in New York City at a time when racial tensions were intensifying in the early '80s.\nIn an interview with Mashable , T errell said that while preparing for his role, playing young Obama has helped him accept his mixed-race identity as someone of Anglo-Indian and African-American descent in a country where he still feels like an outsider. Like Obama, who moved to Indonesia with his mother at a young age, Terrell moved to Australia when he was 5.\n\"I was the only one of my kind, so I knew what it felt like to be an outsider and to try to fit into different circles,\" Terrell told Mashable . \"I'm still a very young man as well, so I'm asking the same questions as Barack.\"\nmy man devon terrell\nhttps://pbs.twimg.com/media/Cx4sMNIXcAQRg8f.jpg:large Young Barack Obama, 1980's.\nhttps://pbs.twimg.com/media/CxGsg1yW8AQ5Xe1.jpg:large Terrell, who learned how to mimic Obama's distinctive voice and write left-handed for the film, said he hopes the film honors the president's legacy in a time when many feel a sense of uncertainty under Donald Trump's America.\n\"The election has totally taken over conversations around the world right now, so I hopefully this can start other conversations that bring hope to the world,\" Terrell said. \"He's broken down all these barriers that people had on themselves.\"\nAccording to Terrell, however, the most important lesson he's learned from playing young Obama for the film is to realize, no matter who you are or where you come from, you still belong.\n\"You don't have to fit in anywhere,\" Terrell added. \"The truth is you belong. Wherever you are.\"\nBarry will be available on Netflix on Dec. 16. You can watch the trailer for the biopic below:\nSource: YouTube",

      "text": "Digital home entertainment services and solutions provider, TiVo Corporation ( TIVO - Free Report ) has entered into a series of deals pertaining to products, licensing and intellectual property agreement with streaming video giant Netflix Inc. ( NFLX - Free Report ) . The financial terms of the deal were not disclosed.\nPer the product agreement, TiVo will carry on navigating user interface and will integrate web entertainment from Netflix to its set-top boxes. These services will be available to consumers through pay-TV providers and retail stores.\nTiVo currently provides software solutions to more than 70 Pay-TV operators across 30 countries. Therefore, the deal is expected to expand TiVo’s product offerings as well as global presence, which in turn will boost revenues.\nSeparately in an intellectual property agreement, Netflix now has a license to TiVo patent portfolios for over-the-top (OTT) offerings.\nAccording to Tom Carson, CEO TiVo, “Our agreements with Netflix represent a major milestone for TiVo as we expand our offerings for the fast-growing OTT space, and further demonstrate our commitment to delivering innovative technologies to new and emerging markets.”\nWe believe that an agreement through these licensing agreements would be incrementally beneficial for the company. Additionally, the deal would enhance use experience and provide the necessary competitive edge over its peers in the emerging market of online video streaming.\nWe think competition in the online movie business is escalating and integrating Netflix will play a key role in adding subscribers and retaining existing ones. The new deal will help TiVo to remain a few notches above its peers.\nAs stated by Bill Holmes, Netflix’s global head of business development, “Building on this history, the agreements provide consumers freedom to watch their favorite TV shows and movies whenever and wherever, with an integrated experience across more devices.”\nTiVo generated a year-to-date return of 24.55% compared with the Zacks Internet Services industry gain of 0.22%.\nBottom Line\nBoth TiVo and Netflix are focused on improving the viewing experience and believe that cloud or service are the most important mediums through which this goal can be achieved.\nWe continue to believe that recent deals with leading companies coupled with new customer wins, product launches and international expansion will drive top-line growth.\nIt should be noted that TiVo was formerly known as Rovi Corporation. Upon successfully completing the acquisition of TiVo Inc. early this September, Rovi adopted the iconic TiVo brand name.\nThe new TiVo Corporation is now the global leader in entertainment technology and audience insights. The company has a diverse product portfolio that ranges from interactive program guide to the DVR. The combined company has emerged as the world’s leading media and entertainment provider to deliver the ultimate entertainment experience.\nNonetheless, the actual synergies from the merger will take some time to reflect in the company’s performance and much depends on how successfully it integrates the legacy business of TiVo.\nThe company faces significant competition from Alphabet Inc.’s ( GOOGL - Free Report ) Google TV, Roku and Apple Inc.’s ( AAPL - Free Report ) TV.\nCurrently, TiVo carries a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

      "text": "Paris Gellar, in the flesh. Photo: Netflix This sort of contains spoilers, but nothing that important. When I tuned in to watch Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life over the weekend, I was excited but hesitant. I was prepared for the second coming of the television show I loved so much in high school to feel distant, surreal. I was prepared for it to be bad. Here’s what I was not ready for: The triumph that is Paris Geller’s ass-kicking yet distinctly tender wardrobe. Under costume designer Brenda Maben’s direction, Lorelai has some good moments in Stella McCartney , and Rory breaks up a series of ill-fitting T-shirts (representative of the unmoored state of her career and life) with some Self Portrait . But it’s Paris, Rory’s high-strung academic rival and semi-BFF at Chilton and Yale, who steals the show. Now in her thirties, running a successful fertility clinic (“I’m the Pablo Escobar of the fertility world”), and undergoing a divorce from her college boyfriend, Doyle, Paris has the money to buy nice things and the calculation to know how to project power through clothing. At the very least, she knows how hire a personal shopper who does. It’s not that Paris is suddenly a fashion plate — she never was — or even that her clothing is particularly remarkable. It’s that she now dresses with a stylish easiness that many millennial women will identify with and the tactical thinking of a presidential candidate . In late November of 2016, that feels pretty damn on point. Fertility clinic Paris. Photo: Netflix When we first meet her again, Paris is wearing a white cowl neck shirt under a black, slightly metallic collarless jacket reminiscent of the Nina McLemore suiting favored by women in Washington. It’s slim and impeccably tailored, with sleeves that end just below the elbow for a “getting to work” vibe — a look that works equally well if you’re Elizabeth Warren or just leaning across your glass top desk to pitch a potential client on her fertility options. Paris wears a belted coatdress with black stockings, pumps, and a more cheerful ochre scarf to visit Stars Hollow. On her cell phone, evidently discussing Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie’s childrearing agenda, she might as well be on the campaign trail. Her newly cropped hair, by the way, is more than a little similar to Claire Underwood’s. Luke’s Diner Paris. Photo: Netflix For revisiting Chilton with Rory, Paris chooses a “Hillary Clinton does J.Crew ” look: trim black pants, black pumps, and another collarless jacket, pale pink this time, with small ruffles at the shoulder seams. It’s sharp and commanding but possesses a touch of softness, reflective of her capacity to terrify a classroom full of high schoolers and then have a breakdown of the imposter syndrome variety in a matter of minutes. And that’s the beauty of Paris’s new lease on fashion, and of Maben’s work as a costumer. Her wardrobe is simultaneously armor against, and a manifestation of, her deep vulnerabilities. In short, she is all of us when we get dressed. These pumps were made for kicking doors closed. Photo: Netflix When she’s having that panic attack in the women’s restroom at Chilton, having just been thrown back into a lonely, brokenhearted teenage mindset at the sight of former high school megahottie Chad Michael Murray Tristan, she whips out the briefcase she’s been toting around: “Check out what’s in my briefcase. Nothing. I brought it because I thought people would think I was more important because I was carrying a briefcase. I’m a phony.” Maybe, but just a few moments later, Maben delivers a supremely restrained dose of sartorial vindication in the form of a visitation from Chilton mean girl Francie Jarvis, who strolls into the bathroom wearing round-toed pumps and a fit-and-flare dress. Faced with a typically paranoid outburst from Paris, Francie tosses back, “I’m sorry, did I just step into 2003?” And then she walks to the mirror and sets down a Takashi Murakami x Louis Vuitton cherry blossom purse from 2003. Listen closely: That’s the sizzle of a self-inflicted burn you’re hearing. Paris, for all her continued neuroses, has evolved more than she realizes. She may feel like a phony, but she’s pure 2016.

      "text": "Netflix 4K Streaming News: Bingewatch on ‘Gilmore Girls’ But Upgrade Your PC First Joe Bacaron Nov 29, 2016 12:05 PM EST Share on Facebook Share on Twitter NETFLIX/ Gilmore Girls Revival \nHow would you like to bingewatch \"Gillmore Girls\" in Netflix 4K streaming glory? Well, you have to check the specs of your computer first. \nMollie Ruiz-Hopper, Windows Blog EIC, wrote that Netflix is releasing the \"Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life\" in ultra-high resolution but it's going to be exclusive for Windows 10. \n\"When streaming Netflix on Microsoft Edge you can get through at least one more full episode of Gilmore Girls than when streaming on Chrome on battery,\" she added. \"And you know one episode can be the difference between Chris and Lorelai casually dating and being a married couple.\" \n\"To run Netflix in 4K on a PC device, it must have a 4K-capable screen and use a 7th Gen Intel® Core TM Processor,\" she added. \nNapier Lopez of The Next Web said this Netflix 4K streaming news is unfortunate considering the many limitations for watching shows on ultra HD. First, Mac owners will definitely be left out by the exclusivity to Windows 10. Sponsored Watch Your Favorite Christian Films, 24/7. Click Here To Start Your Free Trial Today \nSecond, new monitors with 1440p resolutions or above would have benefited from this news. Third, the Surface Studio-even with its very high 4500x3000 resolution-won't be able to play Netflix 4K streaming shows because it doesn't feature the Kaby Lake processor. \nHe said that 4K videos already exists on YouTube and all people, even without the Kaby Lake processor or the Windows 10 OS, can play them on their laptop or desktop without any problem. \nBut then again the Netflix 4K streaming news can be best explained through the security aspect since the Kaby Lake has an internal fail-safe mode to prevent piracy of 4K video.",

      "text": "By Daniela Cabrera 6 hours ago \nWhen the Netflix reboot of Gilmore Girls was announced earlier this year, some of the key cast members had a whole lot of feelings to share about it. Lauren Graham shared a photo of a blue coat she \"stole\" from the set when the show first ended, and for some fans, it became a part of Gilmore mythology. In her new memoir, Talking As Fast As I Can, Graham shares that her beloved blue coat disappeared on the final day of shooting the revival, and it feels like a symbolic closing to her GG journey. \nFirst, a bit of backstory about the original blue coat. In the book, Graham says that after the show was cancelled, she had often been asked by journalists if she took anything from the old set, but the only thing she'd taken was a blue coat, which she took by accident because she was already wearing it. Graham wrote, My blue coat was something I went home in one day and sort of forgot about until it was time to come back. Besides, they always seem more interested in intentional hard-core theft, anyway. \nSo, the blue coat thereafter became the item that she stole from the set. (In case you were wondering, this time around, Graham took a pink tin flamingo from the kitchen and Alexis Bledel took a Yale banner from Rory's room.) [Twitter Embed: https://twitter.com/thelaurengraham/status/693193513287049216] \nNow fast forward nine years. Ahead of the revival, Graham posted the above photo showing off her blue coat and how ready she was to step back into Lorelai's shoes and wardrobe. In the book, she writes that after filming the last scene she realized that her coat was missing when she returned to her trailer that night. She remembered she left it on a bike on set and had people all over the set looking for it, but it was never found. Graham rationalized that maybe a fan took it as their own souvenir, In all the years that I worked there, I thought of the back lot as a sort of extension of my house... Warner Brothers gives tours there now, which means it's much more crowded than it used to be. I don't want to think the worst, but maybe tweeting that picture when the show was announced made it a desirable or fun collector's item for someone who was passing by? (By the way, if that someone is you, no hard feelings, but can you mail it back to my manager in Los Angeles, John Carrabino, no questions asked?) \nSeriously, if anyone took it, return it! When I first read this tidbit about her missing coat, it felt like the coat was a symbol of her Gilmore Girls journey as a whole. She accidentally took the coat after not knowing the show would be cancelled, and she revealed in the book that she never wore it once after the end of the original series, but it had managed to stay with her that entire time, almost like the character stayed with her. \nGraham also spoke of her connection to the coat and how she felt to have lost it, I'm not sure why I kept it... We once had a terrible winter of moths eating all our sweaters, but somehow they spared this coat — even they must have known I was going to need it again. For Gilmore Girls: A Year In The Life , it was with me everyday. It kept me warm and dry, and billowed out behind me as I rode my bike across the lot in the wee hours of the night. So I can't help but feel a little sad it's gone. \nIt sounds like the loss of her coat mirrors her feeling of loss, sadness, yet odd completion of her journey with Lorelai. But for us fans, we can only hope that this blue coat will pop up again just in time for an second Year In The Life. Must Reads ",

      "text": "Netflix Might Be Ruining Your Life (Seriously) Are aspects of your life giving way to constant streaming? Share By Tiffany Rogers November 29, 2016 \nTiffany is a writer and blogger from Tulsa, Oklahoma, with a degree in journalism from Oral Roberts University. \nA girl comes home after a long day. She sets her things down, throws her hair up and changes into comfy clothes in record time. She grabs her laptop and flips it open. The screen illuminates, showing the last website she visited: Netflix. \nThe familiar words appear on the screen. \n“Playback Timed Out.” \nHer muscle memory kicks in and she hits ‘refresh’ as the episode she fell asleep on continues, right where she left off. \nAnd this is how she spends her evening. Maybe she eats, maybe she showers, maybe she talks to some people. But at any given moment, especially in bed getting ready to fall asleep, she is watching Netflix. \nThe end. \nThat girl? It was me. A Real Netflix Addiction \nI had a social life, I had friends, I even had a boyfriend. But when people asked what my “hobbies” were, I had to lie by deflection. I said things like, “Oh, I enjoy reading. I write sometimes. I love the outdoors.” Because I certainly couldn’t tell them, “I literally spend all of my free time watching The Office on Netflix.” \nHere’s the thing: Netflix was my escape from life, from stress, from feelings and from people. I used the shows I watched on Netflix to keep fear and depression at bay. If I was watching Netflix, nothing could hurt me. \nThat sounds extreme—because it was extreme. But that was my reality. It wasn’t that I was lazy, without anything better to do. \nIt was that at the root of my incessant Netflix binge, something was terribly wrong. Something was awry in my heart, and it was causing fear and depression to hover over me like an individualized dark rain cloud. Netflix was my perpetual umbrella. \nThen, something happened. \nI found myself at a place where everything I held dearest was slipping through my fingers: my future, my plans, my pride, my love. For a long time I knew I needed to turn back to God and finally listen to His voice. He had been whispering into my soul, like a parent whispers too closely in a child’s ear when chastising at a dinner table (that kind of whisper that makes kids flinch from the tickle). I couldn’t ignore Him anymore. The Real Root of Netflix Addiction \nIn my life, I stopped seeking God. I chased feelings and intuitions instead of prayerfully asking the Lord for guidance and peace. I listened to my own overly emotional and foolish heart over listening to the wisdom and discernment of the Holy Spirit. In no uncertain terms, I was running. \nI found what I thought I wanted, and I didn't want to hear what God had to say, for fear it would contradict my desires. \nWhat does Netflix have to do with all this? Because while my heart was wasting in torture and turmoil, I naively believed the longer I watched Netflix, the longer I could put off the change I knew needed to happen. \nThankfully, Jesus came to my rescue. \nHe opened my eyes and allowed me to see the damage I had been doing to my heart and mind by putting Him off. In that moment, I made a decision to change my attitude, my habits and my heart. \nI desperately needed Jesus back in my everyday life. Nothing was right without Him being at the center of my affections, without Him being my greatest love. I chose that day to allow Him access to my rusted heart. You Might Also Like",

      "text": "Comedian Vir Das shoots in New York City as first Indian with a Netflix series of his own\n\nVir Das \n\"I missed my wife, my bulldog and ghar ka khana in that order,\" says an exhausted Vir Das, who recently returned to the country from New York where he was shooting for the second instalment of his upcoming Netflix series, scheduled to go online in February. He will be the first Indian to bag his own show, joining the likes of Russel Peter and Jon Stewart.\n\"It was an astounding experience,\" says the 37-year-old, as he recounts his performance before the live audience overseas. Das shot for the first part of the series in Delhi earlier this year. Though he refuses to confess about the developments yet, the excitement in his voice can hardly be contained.\n\"I have always felt that there is a genuine vacancy of an Indian voice in the comedy space globally. I'm not referring to a Canadian-Indian or an American Indian. I'm talking about a desi comic.\" But is the international audience receptive to Indian comedy?\n\"The Americans are warmer to humour,\" he says. \"They have more experience in handling jokes and their sensibilities are evolved, but Indians clearly laugh louder,\" he chuckles.\nAfter having ventured into films from theatre, Das, who will direct and write his show, is looking forward to tapping into the digital space. \"There is no censorship, the appreciation is massive and it involves lesser risk than movies do,\" he says matter-of-factly.",

      "text": "TiVo ( TIVO ) is making nice with online video streamer Netflix ( NFLX ) as the San Carlos, Calif., digital video recorder and TV technology company looks to avoid lawsuits and boost its offerings.\nThe agreement , announced following Monday's closing bell, advances the companies' existing product partnership and also instates a new intellectual property license deal.\nTiVo set-top boxes available through pay-TV providers and retail stores will now come with Netflix services more fully integrated, including a unified search option and a dedicated Netflix button on remotes. Netflix also has gotten a license to TiVo's patent portfolios and to the company's over-the-top patent portfolio with privately owned global invention company Intellectual Ventures .\nTiVo shares were up 1.9% to $21.15 on the news Tuesday morning. The stock is up nearly 27% year-to-date.\nNetflix stock climbed more modestly, rising about 1% to $118.07 by late morning. Shares of the Los Gatos, Calif., company are up about 3.2% so far this year.\n\"Our agreements with Netflix represent a major milestone for TiVo as we expand our offerings for the fast-growing OTT space and further [demonstrate] our commitment to delivering innovative technologies to new and emerging markets,\" TiVo CEO Tom Carson said in the statement.\nThe move to seal a deal with Netflix comes after TiVo, then Rovi, lost a legal tussle with the video streamer.\nIn July, five patents of interactive TV media guide company Rovi were invalidated following five years of litigation against Netflix. Rovi, which bought the former TiVo on Sept. 8 for $1.1 billion in cash and stock and assumed the TiVo name and ticker, alleged that Netflix's categorization of content as well as other features on the streaming service infringed on Rovi's licensed technology.\nU.S. District Judge Phyllis Hamilton ruled in favor of Netflix, however, saying that Rovi's five patents in question had no \"meaningful limitations.\" Rovi later appealed the decision, but it was upheld in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit on Nov. 7.\nB. Riley's Eric Wold said the new IP agreement with Netflix appears to be a risk-avoidance move on TiVo's side.\n\"We believe that some meaningful level of potential revenues from NFLX under a separate license agreement or litigation settlement were put to the side in order to continue the product partnership that has been in place for years -- and allow TIVO to continue to offer service providers a seamless linear and OTT search/discovery environment,\" Wold contended in an analyst note Monday. Nevertheless, he reiterated a buy rating and $31 price target on TiVo shares. B. Riley does not rate Netflix stock.\n\"[The agreement] does provide value in that the legacy TIVO/NFLX relationship remains in place, which is valuable to TIVO's license agreements with the [set-top box] providers and service providers in terms of providing full search capability across linear and OTT,\" he added via email. \"In addition, there is value in avoiding litigation expense and the risk of any future patents being deemed invalid during litigation.\"\nGlobally, the combined TiVo/Rovi has more than 6,000 issued patents and pending applications, Variety reports . In its latest annual report , filed March 23, TiVo estimated it had received $1.6 billion in cash and future revenue commitments from IP litigation.\nWold said in the analyst note that TiVo could leverage the latest agreement with Netflix to snag deals with other companies in the over-the-top space, including Amazon ( AMZN ) and Apple ( AAPL ) .\nJPMorgan analyst Sterling Auty said in a note Monday that the deal shows the strength of Rovi and TiVo's portfolio, which has \"broader applicability.\"\n\"The deal is a positive as it adds incremental revenue, although not huge at first, and eliminates the legal costs associated with Netflix litigation,\" Auty added, maintaining an overweight rating and $34 price target on TiVo. For Netflix stock, JPMorgan's Doug Anmuth has an overweight rating.\nA Netflix spokeswoman declined comment.\nApple is a holding in Action Alerts PLUS , our club for investors.\n\"This is still a stock you want to own, and just thinking about Apple's $40 per share in foreign cash that could soon be coming back to America makes it worth paying for,\" said Jim Cramer, TheStreet's founder and manager of the portfolio, and research director Jack Mohr in their latest update .\nClick here for a free 14-day AAP trial and to read the entire analysis of the AAP team.",

      "title": "Amazon's New Echo; Netflix-TiVo Deal; Intel's Self-Driving Car Plans -- Eye On Tech",
      "text": "Amazon is reportedly planning an upcoming release of a touchscreen Echo device. \nNetflix and TiVo agree on a product and IP deal. \nIntel's partnering with Delphi and Mobileye in an effort to build out its self-driving car business. Amazon Echo Gets a Facelift Amazon's (NASDAQ: AMZN ) not afraid to try out new products. Just think about its more successful run with Kindle…and its not-so-successful attempt at smartphones. Well, it looks like we can count the Echo as one of its more successful endeavors . The device sold well over the Thanksgiving to Cyber Monday stretch and is one of the best sellers on Amazon in its electronics category, trailing only its Fire TV product. Incidentally, the Fire TV Stick is also powered by Alexa, the artificially-intelligent brains behind the Echo. Now it looks like this category-leading product is about to get a facelift. Reportedly coming as soon as Q1 2017, a seven-inch touch screen Echo with better speakers and a higher price point is on the way. Good idea? Most definitely. The company's A.I.-powered device is an area that others - like Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) - are getting involved in and Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) sort of has via Siri. However, Amazon is a leader within that category and as its capabilities expand and versatility grows, it will be more and more useful for its customers. Amazon has every reason to continue building out the Echo lineup, be it from direct sales and a more personal, direct link to its most valuable asset: the customer. Just like with the Fire phone, Amazon knows how to react. It pulled the plug on its phone device when it didn't gain traction. The opposite is happening here, in that Echo has a lot of early traction and Amazon is pressing it along to take advantage. Good call, Bezos. Netflix, TiVo Sign Deal Shares of TiVo (NASDAQ: TIVO ) were up about 10% in Monday's after-hours trading session after it signed a deal with Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ), but those gains evaporated in Tuesday morning's trading session. The stock finished higher by just 0.24%, while shares of Netflix climbed about 50 basis points. From the SA announcement: \"TiVo says it will integrate NFLX into its set-top boxes, and include searches across the content catalog and a Netflix button on remote controls; a separate agreement between the two companies gives NFLX a license to TiVo's patent portfolios.\" Is this a win-win for both companies? Think about it like this: Netflix gains access to patents and presumably a wider audience base. TiVo latches on to what many consider the future of TV/video consumption. While TiVo isn't exactly a mega-sized set top box provider, it is noteworthy that Netflix has found itself working with another, more classic company. Earlier this year it signed a deal with Comcast (CMSCA) to get exposure to its customers as well. It's like cable companies are finally admitting that Netflix isn't going away anytime soon and instead of fighting the tide, they will make incremental changes to be a part of it as well. It's more than likely a smart move. Netflix may have its own share of execution issues from quarter to quarter, but make no mistake about its long-term potential. The company has been a true disruptor to the video consumption world and with big (albeit expensive) deals coming down the pipe, I don't think its popularity will fade any time soon. Intel Into Self-Driving Cars? \" Auto parts maker Delphi Automotive (NYSE: DLPH ) and Mobileye (NYSE: MBLY ) are putting an Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) chip at the heart of their joint effort to produce self-driving cars by 2019.\" The sole comment on that announcement comes from Dr. Polaris , where he says, \"Intel needs to do something to avoid becoming the next Xerox.\" I agree with Dr. Polaris and man, wouldn't it have done Intel a lot of good to get in on the M&A consolidation storm that has been sweeping through the semiconductor space. Yes, yes, Intel has made a number of small acquisitions over the year, like in virtual reality or deep learning (and yes, there was Altera last year ). But do you know what company is crushing it when it comes to growth in a number of emerging technologies? Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA ). Unfortunately, Nvidia now sports a market cap close to $50 billion thanks to the 200% appreciation to its stock price this year. However, even earlier this year the stock traded with a market cap south of $20 billion. While we will never know if Intel made an offer for Nvidia and while hindsight is indeed 20/20, it seems like the company should have pulled the trigger and tried. For the first five months of 2016 or so, a $36 billion offer would have represented about 100% premium to the company's current price. NVDA Market Cap data by YCharts It would have given Intel growth in self-driving cars, A.I., VR and a number of other markets. Technically standing at $167 billion, Intel could still do the deal. But it's too late for that now. Perhaps its recently formed Automated Driving Group can help too, but even that feels too late. It's a good idea for Intel to work with others in the space to get there. But I don't know if working with Mobileye and Delphi will be what ultimately gives Intel the growth boost it needs. Perhaps a bigger partnership or an acquisition would get Intel pointed in the right direction.

      "text": "23 'Gilmore Girls' references you may have missed in the Netflix revival   11:33 AM Megan Willett, INSIDER - Business Insider \nWarning: Spoilers ahead for \"Gilmore Girls: A Year In The Life.\" \nNetflix's revival of \"Gilmore Girls: A Year In The Life\" is now officially streaming. \nThe show likely made many fans feel happy and nostalgic — those four last words aside — while also moving the characters forward in a satisfying way. \nThere were also plenty of references to the series that may have gone over your head unless you're a die-hard fan. Keep reading so you can go back and catch them all. Let’s start with a classic: \"I smell snow,\" Lorelai tells Rory in the town square. Netflix Fans of the original series know that Lorelai has a keen sense for smelling when snow is about to fall. Lorelai smelling the first snow of the year.Warner Bros. \nIn episode eight of the first season, Lorelai tells Rory how much she loves the snow and that she can smell when it's coming. \nShe also says every good thing that's ever happened to her — her first kiss, Rory's first steps, her best birthday — happened when it was snowing. Lorelai is worried that celebrity chef Roy Choi is going to burn down the Dragonfly Inn's kitchen. Netflix \nLorelai has an ever revolving door of chefs coming in and out as she tries to replace her beloved best friend and the inn's chef, Sookie (Melissa McCarthy), during the revival. In the original series, the inn where Lorelai, Michele, and Sookie worked did burn down. Warner Bros. \nWhile working at the Independence Inn, a faulty wire causes a fire to break out and the Inn got shut down. \nIt eventually spurs Lorelai and Sookie to open the Dragonfly Inn together. Emily's new maid Berta is actually played by a Stars Hollow favorite. Netflix That's right — Rose Abdoo, who plays Gypsy in the series, also plays Berta! Netflix \n\"Rose read it for fun in a table read because they hadn't cast it yet, and she was so hilarious they had to double her up,\" Lauren Graham (Lorelai) tweeted about the casting. Gypsy tells Lorelai to buy a new car after fixing her Jeep Wrangler in \"Spring.\" Netflix Everyone should know by now that Lorelai will never get a new car. Warner Bros. \nIn season seven, Lorelai tries to buy a new car, but discovers that she doesn't like any car but her beloved Jeep. \nThe frustrating process of trying to find a car she likes ends up fixing her friendship with Luke, who ends up convincing Gypsy to install a new engine into her old car. There are also a few Easter eggs from the show at Richard's funeral, including a record Rory gave him. Netflix During the first season, Lorelai isn't sure what to get her father. She asks Rory, who says she got him \"Chuck Berry: Live at the Fillmore.\" Netflix and Wikimedia Commons \nThat album is on a table at the funeral, a touching reminder of Rory's relationship with her grandfather. And this picture was from the wedding vow renewal episode, which was also the \"Gilmore Girls\" 100th episode. Netflix The episode was called \"Wedding Bell Blues\" and it was a huge hit with critics and a wonderful glimpse into Emily and Richard's marriage. Warner Bros When Emily is Kondo-ing her home, she tells Lorelai: \"I was married for 50 years, half of me is gone.\" Netflix This bit of dialogue is a touching tribute to actor Edward Hermann. Netflix \nEdward Hermann played Richard Gilmore, the patriarch of the Gilmore family for the series' run. Hermann died in 2014 before the revival could happen. \nThe 50 year mark coincides with when Hermann died in real life: Emily and Richard married in 1964 and Hermann passed away in 2014. In the revival, Richard died in 2016, which means he and Emily would actually have been married for about 52 years. \nHonoring his actual passing could be a subtle nod to the actor from showrunner and creator Amy Sherman-Palladino. The Town Troubadour chases a competing singer through Stars Hollow. Netflix \nHe's played by singer-songwriter Grant-Lee Phillips. It mirrors a plotline from season one when the Town Troubadour becomes the only Town Troubadour. Warner Bros. \nThe Town Troubadour faces off against a rival Troubadour in season one of the series. During a town meeting, the issue is brought up and eventually, it's decided that the original Town Troubadour will be the official Town Troubadour. \nIn season six, he's tapped to tour with Neil Young, prompting a flock of hopeful singers to turn up in Stars Hollow to try and get discovered themselves. Eventually, the Town Troubadour returns and reclaims his rightful post. We finally saw Lane's dad, Mr. Kim, after all these years. Netflix \nFans have wondered for years about Lane's dad — where was he and why did we never see him? \nThis seemed like a very bizarre throwaway moment in the revival, but at least we know he's alive and well. Lorelai has another dream about Paul Anka, the dog and the man. Netflix \nShe tells Rory it's the third one she's had this year. Season six is when Lorelai has her first dream about Paul Anka. Warner Bros. The Gilmore Guys were invited to be a part of the revival. Netflix and Gilmore Guys/Facebook \n\"Gilmore Guys\" is a popular podcast that takes a deep dive into each \"Gilmore Girls\" episode. The pair kept it a secret from fans until the trailer debuted. Richard's will sets money aside for Luke to franchise Luke's Diner. Netflix \nIn the revival, Emily convinces Luke to look at possible locations with her. This plot line also played out in season five. Richard makes the suggestion when he and Luke go golfing at his club. Warner Bros. \nLuke frantically calls Lorelai after he golfs with her father and tells her, \"Your father wants to open up a chain of Luke’s Diners, and I think I agreed to it.\" \n\"There’s going to be seven of them, and that’s just on the eastern seaboard. Then, I’m going national,\" he says. \"I’ve already got a marketing guy, Herb’s my banker, your father is taking care of all my insurance needs, and apparently, everyone is going to be able to buy stock!\" \nLorelai eventually calms Luke down and straightens everything out with her father, but it appears Richard never let the dream die. Lorelai uses \"alumnus\" wrong. Netflix \nWhen she talks to Rory while she's at her Chilton alumni event, she asks \"How's my little alumnus doing?\" \nBut she should know that's not the proper term by now. When Rory was still in high school, she taught her mom the difference between alumna, alumni, and alumnus. Warner Bros. \nRory is preparing to meet a Harvard alumnus, and Lorelai begins teasing her: LORELAI: So, alumna is a girl graduate. RORY: Right. LORELAI: And alumnus is a man. RORY: Singular. LORELAI: So an unmarried man? RORY: No, not not-married. He can be married or single, all alumnus means is one man singular as opposed to many men plural. LORELAI: And plural is alumni. RORY: Right, and that can be girls and guys. LORELAI: Kinky! RORY: No, not kinky, just what it is. \nIt appears she forgot this lesson. The Chilton bathroom scene in the revival is a direct callback to season three. Netflix \nIn this scene, Paris mentions Chilton's uniform hemlines, Rory and Francie teaming up, and student council, practically all in one breath. The Chilton bathroom in the original series is where Francie intimidated Rory and tried to get her to vote for higher hemlines. Warner Bros. \nWhile Rory serves as vice president on student council, the girls' bathroom at Chilton becomes a virtual war room as Francie tries to manipulate Rory to go against Paris's wishes and vote for higher hemlines. Rory eventually stands up to Francie in the same bathroom. \nSeeing all three characters together again in one place was quite fun for fans. Taylor Doose references the Lazy-Hazy-Crazy Days of Summer event in \"Summer.\" Netflix It's from the first episode of season three when Taylor hires a choir to sing \"Lazy-Hazy-Crazy Days of Summer\" on repeat. Warner Bros. \nThe whole town gets the song stuck in their heads and are miserable. \n\"Oh, hey, I figured how to get the 'Lazy-Hazy-Crazy Days of Summer' out of our heads — to sing the 'Small World' song over and over for the next 48 hours,\" Lorelai says. \"Of course, how we get the 'Small World' song out of our heads, I have not worked out yet.\" Carole King sings \"Feel The Earth Move Under My Feet\" and no one recognizes it. Netflix \nKing plays Sophie, the sister of the Town Troubadour who owns a music store in town. \nIn the revival, she reprises her role and volunteers an \"original song\" that she says she's been working on — \"Feel The Earth Move Under My Feet\" — for Taylor to use. The fact that no one recognizes the song is a cute nod to the \"Gilmore Girls\" theme song. Warner Bros. \n\"Where You Lead,\" the famous \"Gilmore Girls\" theme song, was written by King. It's implied in the revival that in the world of \"Gilmore Girls,\" Carole King and her music don't exist. \nTaylor deems Sophie's song \"Feel The Earth Move Under My Feet\" not catchy enough. Logan and his friends show up to Stars Hollow wearing gorilla masks. Netflix The scene was an homage to when Rory first entered Logan's circle after she sees a girl wearing a gorilla mask. Warner Bros. \nRory first finds out about the Life and Death Brigade — the secret society at Yale that Logan is a part of — when a girl wearing a gorilla mask wanders into her bathroom. \nShe decides to investigate for the Yale Daily News, and ends up getting closer to Logan in the process. When Rory goes into Richard's study, you can see her painting above his desk. Netflix Emily had the portrait done in season one. It was Lorelai who suggested Rory read a book while she's posing. Warner Bros. \nRichard loved the painting, and showing his study exactly as he left it was likely another nod to Edward Shermann, who played Richard. Of course Miss Celine helps dress Lorelai for her wedding. Netflix Miss Celine was famous for her taste in fashion — not to mention telling everyone what celebrity they look like. Warner Bros. \nShe was Emily's personal stylist on the series and decided Rory looked like Audrey Hepburn while Lorelai looked like Natalie Wood. When Emily repeatedly tells Lorelai \"You need money\" in \"Fall,\" it's a direct tie to the first episode of \"Gilmore Girls.\" Netflix \nIn the revival, Lorelai needs money to help expand the Dragonfly Inn. Emily agrees, on the condition that Lorelai and Luke visit her every year in Nantucket. Richard originally said \"You need money\" multiple times when Lorelai asks her parents for a loan for Rory's Chilton education. Warner Bros. \nThey decide that Lorelai and Rory will also visit every Friday night for dinner as a part of the arangement. It's the start of a very complicated relationship between the four of them. \nYou can read more about the scene here. Rory shows Dean corn starch before he leave's Doose's Market after they run into each other in \"Fall.\" Netflix Dean tells her to pay for it this time — it's a reference to their first kiss. Netflix \nRory pretended she was buying corn starch when she was really looking at Dean at Doose's Market. She ended up taking the corn starch home with her accidentally after they kissed. Sookie makes a bunch of wedding cakes for Lorelai, and one of them is covered in daisies. Netflix Daisies are Lorelai's favorite flower. Warner Bros. \nIn the first season finale of \"Gilmoe Girls,\" Lorelai tells her then-boyfriend Max (Scott Cohen) that a proposal should have, \"a thousand yellow daisies, and candles, and a horse.\" \nMax takes Lorelai at her word and proposes with a thousand yellow daisies. Though the pair never got married, it was one of the show's most romantic moments. While they're getting ready for the wedding in the revival, eagle-eyed fans can spot this picture of Rory's 16th birthday by Jess's elbow. Netflix It's a picture from season one when Lorelai throws Rory a birthday party in their home. It's a nice reference to how far the series has come. Warner Bros.

person ever in 'Gilmore Girls' revival, 'A Year in the Life' 1 / 34 Back to Gallery Spoiler alert: This piece contains, well, all of them.\nThe four-episode \"Gilmore Girls\" revival, which debuted Friday on Netflix, offers fans plenty of material to critique. Abandoned plotlines (Lorelai and Luke's 20-minute foray into pregnancy surrogacy), missing key characters (Sookie), not enough Dean (important to some people), occasionally flat dialogue (the first excruciating few minutes), unlikely plot devices (Lorelai really can't think of something nice to say about her father at his funeral?) and absurdity without charm (the Stars Hollow musical, the Life and Death Brigade sequence) abound. But its worst sin, for which no one associated with this production can be forgiven, is for revealing that Rory Gilmore is actually a monster.\nOn the market: Stars Hollow homes that will make 'Gilmore Girls' fans feel right at home\nThe old Rory had flaws, but she remained a revelation - a shy, smart teen girl who gets the guys is still a rarity on TV. But in the same way that the jump from small screen to big killed the wit and heart of \"Sex and the City,\" the new \"Gilmore Girls\" episodes only highlight the worst of Rory's qualities: her impulsiveness, her selfishness, her inflated sense of her own worth, her tendency to quit at the first sign of trouble - and now she's a grown woman, one who doesn't seem to have learned from any of her mistakes. The revival also introduces us to a terrible new quality in her: amorality. Turns out there's nothing revelatory about an adult who moves through the world so thoughtlessly.\nTen years have lapsed from when we last saw Rory victorious, graduating from Yale with a journalism job and a newly single status. But Rory at 32 feels more like what Rory at 24 might have been. She is freelancing here and there but apparently not making a living - as she puts it, she is \"broke.\" Somehow, though, she maintains a residence in Brooklyn and regularly flits back and forth from London, where we find her carrying on a pointless affair with her college boyfriend, Logan. The affair is an intriguing twist, until we learn that Logan is engaged and that Rory has no qualms whatsoever about this, except to the extent that this future wife inconveniences her trysts with Logan. Rory doesn't seem particularly interested in pursuing a relationship with her ex, beyond using him for sex and for answering her fretting phone calls.\nMeanwhile, Rory has a boyfriend of her own, Paul, to whom she is so indifferent she can't even be bothered to break up with, despite cheating on him repeatedly with Logan and once with a guy in a Chewbacca costume. A running joke in the new episodes, that everyone repeatedly forgets about Paul, feels like a rip-off of the Ann/Egg story line from \"Arrested Development.\" Worse than being derivative, though, it makes Rory seem unbelievably callous. No wonder she has even fewer female friends in the revival than she had in the original season. Only Lane has stuck around, though she, too, in her limited screen time, struggles to show much interest in Rory's problems.\nRory's professional missteps don't do much to endear her to viewers. She throws away a perfectly good opportunity to write for GQ and squanders an interview for a gig that she deems beneath her. Informing her mother that she will be revealing the painful details of her past in a book and then throwing a tantrum when Lorelai, understandably, objects, isn't exactly a pro move or a decent thing to do, either.\nShe does not, to my recollection, ever appear to be reading, when her voracious book habit was what separated her from the typical TV teenage girl. Instead, she has taken up tap dancing, a head-scratching move perhaps meant to steal a little \"New Girl\" quirk that turns out to be a forgettable diversion. And maybe most irritatingly, she refuses to accept the circumstances that have placed her back at Stars Hollow (her lack of job, her lack of direction), angrily snapping at all the kind town folk who welcome her back: \"I'm not 'back'!\" And why is she always haranguing people about this missing red outfit of hers? Girl, keeping track of one's clothes is a fairly typical adult activity.\nAs for Rory's surprise pregnancy, no judgment there - perhaps being a parent will help her channel some of her mother's fortitude.\nIt's not like we never saw Rory make a mistake in the original series. She made huge, life-altering ones, like sleeping with her married ex-boyfriend, stealing a yacht and dropping out of Yale. But they were the sins of a very young woman who was both sensitive and a little bit selfish. She was flawed in the way plenty of interesting leading characters are and still kept our attention as one of the few female teenagers on television who was allowed to be incredibly studious and incredibly desirable to every male in her vicinity. We forgave and empathized with her mistakes, partly because we saw how much they pained her and partly because she wasn't like any TV character we'd seen.\nBut regret or remorse, or even self-reflection, do not seem like qualities that the new Rory is familiar with. Calling the Rory of today \"flawed\" creates a too-generous comparison to more-interesting leading ladies such as Alicia Florrick, Nancy Botwin, Cersei Lannister or, frankly, Lorelai Gilmore. Rory isn't \"flawed.\" She's simply unkind and ungrateful, in the most common way possible. Her fans deserved better.",

      "text": "Ever wondered quite how much time you spend binge-watching series after series on Netflix?\n\nWell, wonder no longer as Samsung has surveyed 3,000 UK adults to assess just how Brits spend their time in 2016.\n\nThe average British adult will have spent 17 years and 41 days sleeping, 13 years and three months working, eight years and 110 days watching TV and one year and seven months commuting during their lifetime. You'll also have spent seven months of your life queuing and a year at the pub. \n\n*Read more*: Winning at life? 25 milestones and when to hit them\n\nCleaning and exercising take up the same amount of time (one year and three months to be exact), while the average person will spend a month arguing and eight months laughing. They also have time for three years and two months of holiday and a month of partying.\n\nOn average, Brits feel the thirties are the happiest stage of life and they expect to retire at 63.Feel you spend a lifetime in queues? You're not the only one (Source: Samsung)\n\nBut there was a shift over the course of a generation in how people spend their time. Those under 40 spend an average of one hour and 47 minutes a day on social media, while the over-65s only spent 40 minutes doing so. The over-65s also spend more time watching TV - over four hours a day, compared to the two hours and 40 minutes watched by the under-40s.\n\n*Read more*: These are the FTSE 100 social media winners and losers\n\nNine out of 10 Brits under 40 said they used multiple screens whilst watching the TV, while just a quarter of those over 65 said they did.\n\nSocial psychologist Dr Becky Spelmman who led the research said: \"The always-on generation of under-40s are working longer hours, have their diaries packed with social activities and are glued to multiple screen devices to stay constantly connected to the world via social media.\"\n\nAnd apparently our brains are adjusting \"making us even better multi-taskers\", so our ability to juggle, manage and process information is growing.\n\nThe embedded content could not be displayed.

      "text": "Turn on tldr \nTechnology is great but people can always find the worst ways to apply it. Anyone who has watched Netflix ’s darkly twisted science fiction series “Black Mirror” can tell you as much. Playing around with the theme, Netflix and its agency MullenLowe Mediahub came up with a smart way to promote the show’s new season this month, by targeting ad blockers . \nWhen people with ad blockers installed visit The Next Web, for instance, they will see an ad featuring an alarming message: “Hello ad blocker user. You cannot see the ad. But the ad can see you,” which goes hand in hand with the show’s dark satire of modern technology. Non-ad block users, on the other hand, will just see a regular display promoting “Black Mirror.” Both ads will lead site visitors to Netflix where they can watch the series. \n“We want to target this hard-to-reach audience and find a creative way to get their attention,” said Sean Corcoran, executive director of digital media and innovation for MullenLowe Mediahub. “We think it’s fun to talk to ad blockers directly. And in the spirit of the show, we are letting people know that they really cannot run.” Advertisement \nThe agency reached out to a bunch of publishers to execute this campaign, but only three media companies — Slate, Mashable and The Next Web — agreed to do so. @TheNextWeb @netflix As an avid Adblock user I thought this ad was great. If more companies did ads like this, I wouldn't need an adblocker pic.twitter.com/uOlipYMqDF \n— Stephen Briles (@Steve_Briles) October 21, 2016 \nRey Caacbay, director of partnerships for The Next Web, explained how Netflix accurately detected the ad blockers: The majority of the ad blockers set the JavaScript variable “window.noBlocker.” Once the publisher detects that code, the background will change accordingly to display the Netflix banner. \n“This happens in milliseconds so the user doesn’t actually see the background change,” said Caacbay. \nThe Next Web has built its own system to serve Canvas ads, a less intrusive full page ad format that is easy to hide or move on from. The Next Web usually shows a Canvas ad once a day, or even less, and charges a premium for it, according to its CEO Boris Veldhuijzen van Zanten. But in order to target ad blockers, the publisher has to hardcode the Canvas ads for Netflix into its content management system to keep the user experience intact. But one problem of doing this is, Caacbay explained, that the publisher cannot count impressions, because the tracking will effectively allow the ad-blocking software to see the Canvas ads. \nThe Next Web still charges Netflix on a CPM basis for this campaign (three to four times more than the normal rate), though, based on the publisher’s own web analytics that shows how many readers were using ad blockers and “makes an educated guess” on how many impressions the publisher would serve during the campaign, explained Caacbay. \nPage load will also slow down a little bit as every additional request takes time to be processed, he added. “We do a lot of tests and improvements to our site to improve speed and site load,” said Caacbay. “So the little increase of page load time we saw, was found acceptable enough towards the improvements we’ve done on other parts of the site.” \nWhile the campaign for “Black Mirror” is a clever one, Caacbay didn’t encourage other publishers to be quite so intrusive without value. “We will keep targeting ad blockers an option for clients,” he said. “But we need to figure out a reason why we should do this again.” Related",

The Build Team from the Discovery Channel series has moved over to Netflix for White Rabbit Project . \nIn this trailer from the new series, which premieres Dec. 9, Kari Byron, Tory Belleci, and Grant Imahara have reassembled for more action (just no “busting of myths,” as Byron clarified when the show was first announced in September). \n“The coolest tech. The weirdest weapons. The craziest escapes. Three science-loving sleuths put them under the microscope,” the YouTube description of the series reads, noting that the trio will “rank history’s greatest inventions, heists, and more.” \n“Are you not amused?!” shouts Imahara. \nAs Byron says, “Everything is gonna go perfect, or the whole thing is gonna just blow up.” Watch the trailer above and see how that pans out for her when White Rabbit Project debuts on Netflix on Dec. 9. \nframeborder=”0” allowFullScreen&gt; ",

      "text": "\nRaise your hand if you gobbled up the new “Gilmore Girls” episodes on Netflix after Thanksgiving! I couldn’t focus on anything else until I had watched all four seasons of “ A Year in the Life ,” and I loved spending some time in Stars Hollow again. I took lots of screenshots while I was watching, too, so we can take a closer look at the fabulous houses and see how some of them have changed over the years. (Warning: possible spoilers ahead!)\nWelcome to Stars Hollow, Connecticut: \n( via ) \nCreator Amy Sherman-Palladino was inspired to create Stars Hollow after visiting Washington Depot: “I went on vacation to Connecticut. I stayed at an inn, and it was very charming, in a tiny town, and everybody seemed to know each other, and there was a pumpkin patch across the street.\n“You go in a coffee shop and everyone knows each other, and they’re going behind the counter and they’re pouring themselves coffee. It seemed like a fun environment to write characters in.”\nFans have pointed out that Washington Depot is nothing like Stars Hollow and wonder if she was actually visiting another town in the area, like Kent .\nIn the pilot, the town scenes were shot in Unionville , Ontario, where the actors didn’t have to pretend to be cold! \nThey turned a place called Williams Hardware into Luke’s Diner for the pilot (and worked its history into the story): \nAfter the show got picked up by the WB, they began filming on a Warner Bros. back lot known as Midwest Street: \nThe fake town in Burbank, California, was transformed into Stars Hollow, Connecticut: Midwest Street has been used for all kinds of TV shows and movies over the years, including The Music Man : \nSome buildings, like Luke’s Diner, are “practical sets,” which means they film inside them: \nBut with others, like Lorelai’s house, the interiors were built on separate soundstages. \nWe’ve never seen the back of Lorelai’s house, and for good reason. \nOddly enough, the exterior of Sookie’s house is on the other side of hers (photo via Gilmore Girls ): \nThat’s right, Lorelai’s house and Sookie’s are one in the same! \nAs Melissa McCarthy explained during a behind-the-scenes tour , you can step through Sookie’s front door… …and then walk through her house into Lorelai’s foyer (which features a fake closet): \nIn “A Year in the Life,” Sookie is MIA, and Lane is living here with Zack and the twins (and her drums!): \nYou can see photos of how it looked when Sookie lived in the house here . \nYou may have also seen Lorelai’s house on “ Pretty Little Liars ” because Spencer lives here (via Iamnotastalker ): \nAnd if you watched “Grease Live!” earlier this year, you saw Sandy singing on Lorelai’s front porch: \nThey put the railings back and surrounded the porch with overgrown bushes to make it look like Lorelai’s place again: When the original series ended in 2007, the living room walls of her house were off-white: \nIn the new episodes, they’re a soft green: \nI like it! It makes the rooms look warmer and the woodwork stand out more. \nWhen we last saw the Gilmore Girls, they were watching their movie marathons on this small TV: \nThey now have a wall of built-ins that hold a flat-screen: \nLorelai’s kitchen has been updated a bit, too: \nShe has a new fridge since the original series (a Christmas gift?): \nThey had a basic two-door almond-white fridge before: \nThe new one’s a vintage-style Heartland Classic Refrigerator : \nThe kitchen also sports a bigger range, presumably because Luke is cooking in it now: \nIn early seasons of the show, the kitchen cabinets were white and the floor was wood-patterned laminate: \nNow the cabinets are green and the floors are yellow and white: \nEver notice how characters who leave through this kitchen door somehow come out on the porch on the left side of the house? It’s TV magic! \nRory’s room hasn’t changed much since the original series: \nThere is supposedly a first-floor bathroom that Rory uses, but I don’t remember seeing it, do you? \nIt may look like a fairly large house, but it only has two bedrooms — Rory’s off the kitchen and Lorelai’s upstairs: \nYou may recall from the original series that Luke had “surprised” Lorelai with his family’s heirloom furniture: \nThey’ve gotten a new bed since then: \nThe only time we saw the real exterior of Richard and Emily Gilmore’s house was in the pilot: \nThey shot those first scenes at a real house in Toronto, Ontario. Here’s how it looks today, via Streetview : \nThe front drive and door were recreated on a soundstage: \nEarly scenes were filmed inside the real house, and the living room looked like this: \nThe interiors were then recreated in the Warner Bros. studios for the series: \nAfter Richard’s death, Emily commissioned this (very large) portrait of her husband: \nThey often kept the cameras still during scenes in this house to reflect its formality: \nIn contrast, the cameras follow the characters and move around a lot in Stars Hollow. \nDid anyone else wish we’d gotten a glimpse inside the cool pool house where Rory once lived? \nThe Dragonfly Inn was originally built for several “Waltons” reunion movies filmed in the ’90s: \nFor “Gilmore Girls,” they transformed it into a colorful and cozy inn: \nIn “A Year in the Life,” we only see the sign hanging on the porch (no full exterior shots, darn it): \nIt’s been over 10 years since Lorelai realized her dream of opening the inn, and now she’s growing restless. \nIt’s amazing how little has changed in the inn’s decor since 2007. \nIt must have been a challenge to recreate these rooms with so many details involved in each one! \nSome of my random thoughts and questions after watching the new episodes: Richard Gilmore (Edward Herrmann) was definitely missed. Pass the Kleenex! Since when does Stars Hollow have a community pool? Or a secret bar? (Of course it would only be hidden from Taylor, ha.) I was shocked when I realized Emily’s new maid Berta was played by “Gypsy” ( Rose Abdoo ). Didn’t recognize her! Made me laugh when they did the whole bit about the first-floor bathroom in Lorelai’s house since we’ve never seen it. \nSo there really is a Mr. Kim! Where’s he been hiding all these years? If Lorelai didn’t send that nasty letter to Emily, then who did? Richard’s mother? Loved that Emily bought that beach house and created a new life for herself there. I wanted to see more of it. Why was Emily in Nantucket the night before Lorelai’s wedding, though? She was planning to attend, right? \nIf there’s going to be a Stars Hollow musical, I want to see some Stars Hollow residents in it. And not have it go on for quite so long! How does a freelance writer afford so many plane tickets back and forth to London? And who flies home to the States for one day and then flies back again? For most of the Life and Death Brigade sequence I thought it was just a bizarre dream Rory was having. Why didn’t we see Rory reading books or talking about literature like she used to? Who ARE you, Rory Gilmore? I’m not sure anymore. \nIt was good to see most of the old gang in the new episodes, but I really needed more of Sookie. Where are Sookie’s children, BTW? Why would she leave them — let alone Lorelai and the inn — for two whole years? I don’t understand! I wish there had been more scenes with Jess, too. (Milo is so good in his new show “This Is Us.” I’m obsessed with it.) What’s next for Rory after that bombshell she dropped on her mother? How will Emily react? The father is Logan, right? Will he ditch his French fiancee when he finds out or will Rory go it alone? Will we get more episodes to find out??? So many questions! \nOverall, I enjoyed the revival a lot. I laughed and I cried. And wrote this very long post about it. \n*Be sure to pick up a “Gilmore Girls” souvenir or two before you leave!* (Amazon affiliate links included) \n\n1. I need this Stars Hollow plaque , Santa. \n2. Can’t wait to read Lauren Graham’s new book, Talking as Fast as I Can . \n3. This gray Luke’s Diner hoodie looks cozy. Just needs a cup of coffee to go with it… \n4. Yep, that’ll work. (Check out what it says on the back of the mug .) \n5. There’s even an Eat Like a Gilmore Cookbook (but will I look like them if I do??) \n6. This Lorelai action figure made me smile. (There’s a cute Rory one , too!) \n7. I refer to my Gilmore Girls Companion all the time — it’s got the scoop on every ep! \n8. How fun is this tote from Doose’s Market ? Can Dean be my bag boy? \n9. I own every season on DVD, and they have tons of special features. What did you think of “A Year in the Life”? Did you enjoy revisiting Stars Hollow as much as I did? Were you shocked by those final four words or did you see them coming? (Oh, Rory! *Facepalm*) \nFor more show trivia and photos from the original series, check out my posts about Lorelai’s House , the Gilmore Mansion , the Pool House where Rory lived, the Independence Inn, the Dragonfly Inn, and more from Stars Hollow! \n\nP.S.

      "text": "1 of 5 Sure, you've had mashed 'taters for Thanksgiving, and probably for a few days after. But if you want some of them French-fried 'taters a la Sling Blade on the Netflix, you're running out of time. MMMM- hmmm .\nThat movie, featuring a mentally challenged adult man fascinatingly portrayed by Billy Bob Thornton , has an impressive 96 percent \"Fresh\" rating on Rotten Tomatoes. Your writer highly recommends it, but stream it before it vanishes at the end of November. Bonus: See if you can find the original short, called Some Call It a Sling Blade featuring Thornton with J.T. Walsh and Molly Ringwald , who did not appear in the full-length feature. Thornton wrote the short, and the full-length adapted screenplay that the short pitched to Hollywood. He took home an Oscar for his writing and a nomination for his acting.\nAs Karl might say: \"Aight, den\" ... on to more highlights from December's comings and goings in Netflix's video treasure trove (full list below):\nLove Kevin Spacey ? You'll cringe with his character in American Beauty ( 88 percent Fresh ) but hurry because it's gone Dec. 1. If you're into extreme sports, athletes who take incredible risks and/or need a good cry before the end of the month, might we suggest McConkey , a critically acclaimed documentary on extreme sports pioneer Shane McConkey. Try to figure out who's on top in \"Top Gun\" before it runs out of fuel on Dec. 1.\nWith the family all home to argue about the election, you might consider The In-Laws a good distraction from the inevitable. Think again . This isn't the 1979 version starring Peter Falk and Alan Arkin . There's never enough Falk and Arkin – ever. The remake does have Albert Brooks, so there's that. After Dec. 1, you won't have to worry about it any more – on Netflix, anyway.\nIf you just KNOW the government is hiding something really big via coded messages known only to the Illuminati, you have until Dec. 14 to find out – that's when The Da Vinci Code disappears like so much invisible continental congressional ink.\nDon't fret the losses ... a lot of cool new stuff is being added starting Dec. 1, including TOGA!!!! – National Lampoon's Animal House . And you'll be able to Netflix and Chill with Bob Ross to a greater degree than ever before ... featuring a collection of the big-haired painter's best, plus more than a few happy little trees starting bright and early Dec. 1.\nWho can't use a little more Robin Williams ? Barry Levinson 's \"Toys\" joins the holiday fun Dec. 1, with awesome contributions from LL Cool J , Michael Gambon and the military-industrial complex . Critics hated it . If that doesn't convince you to watch it, try the awesome improv trailer Williams did for it:\nA slew of Netflix Originals are being added as well in December. Top of that list to watch with your Facebook-fake-news-sharing uncle is Barry , a biopic about Barack Obama that arrives on Dec. 16. Perhaps not. Possible alternatives from the newly arriving list include The Way of the Dragon , the awesome 1972 kung fu flick that features Bruce Lee denuding Chuck Norris ' chest of hair before dispatching him ... or perhaps Hitler: A Career ? Both arrive on Dec. 1. There's always America's biggest patriot beating up bad dudes in Marvel's Captain America: Civil War – arriving as a big present from Netflix on Christmas Day. Maybe just put your uncle on a filter and play it safe with My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic: Season 6 , arriving Dec. 20.\nHere's the full rundown:\nDeparting Netflix in December 2016 December 1\n50 First Dates (2004)\nAmerican Beauty (1999)\nBlack Ops: Series 2\nCamp Takota (2014)\nCarmen Jones (1954)\nCats & Dogs (2001)\nCurious George: Swings Into Spring (2013)\nDon't Be a Menace to South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood (1996)\nElizabeth: The Golden Age (2007)\nEvent Horizon (1997)\nFrequencies (2013)\nMcConkey\nMedora (2013)\nMonkey Business (1952)\nMyth Hunters: Series 1\nMyth Hunters: Series 2\nNeil Young : Heart of Gold (2006)\nPaycheck (2003)\nPirates Who Don't Do Anything: A VeggieTales Movie (2008)\nRiver of No Return (1954)\nSling Blade (1996)\nThor: Hammer of the Gods (2009)\nThe Great War Diary: Season 1\nThe In-Laws (2003)\nThe Out-of-Towners (1999)\nTop Gun (1986)\nValley of the Dolls (1967)\nWorld Trade Center (2006)\nDecember 2\nLegends of the Knight (2013)\nThe Red Baron (2008)\nDecember 3\nThe Best of Me (2014)\nDecember 5\nHoles (2003)\nDecember 14\nThe Da Vinci Code (2006)\nDecember 15\nHigh Profits: Season 1\nWorld War II in Colour (2009)\nDecember 16\nBeyond the Hills (2012)\nDecember 22\nDark Skies (2013)\nDecember 26\nJust Friends (2005)\nDecember 27\nSpy Kids (2001)\nDecember 31\nHercules: The Legendary Journeys: Seasons 1-6\nArriving on Netflix in December 2016\nDecember 1\nAlways (1989)\nAngels in the Snow (2015)\nBeverly Hills Cop (1984)\nBeyond Bollywood (2014)\nBlack Snake Moan (2007)\nChill with Bob Ross: Collection (1990)\nCompulsion (1959)\nD2: The Mighty Ducks (1994)\nDavid Blaine : Street Magic (1997)\nDreamland (2010)\nFor the Love of Spock (2016)\nGirlfriends' Guide to Divorce: Season 2 (2015)\nGlory Daze: The Life and Time of Michael Alig (2016)\nHarry and the Hendersons (1987)\nHitler: A Career (1977)\nHoliday Engagement (2011)\nHoney, I Shrunk the Kids (1989)\nHouse of Wax (2006)\nHannibal (2001)\nMerli: Season 1 – NETFLIX ORIGINAL\nMerry Kissmas (2015)\nNational Lampoon's Animal House (1978)\nPicture Perfect (1997)\nRainbow Time (2016)\nRodeo & Juliet (2015)\nSwept Under (2016)\nSwitchback (1997)\nThe Angry Birds Movie (2016)\nThe Crucible (1996)\nThe Little Rascals (1994)\nThe Legend of Bagger Vance (2000)\nThe Rock (1996)\nThe Spirit of Christmas (2015)\nThe Way of the Dragon (1972)\nToys (1992)\nUncle Nick (2015)\nWaking Life (2001)\nWe're Back!

      "text": "23 'Gilmore Girls' references you may have missed in the Netflix revival Tuesday Nov 29, 2016 at 11:33 AM Megan Willett, INSIDER - Business Insider \nWarning: Spoilers ahead for \"Gilmore Girls: A Year In The Life.\" \nNetflix's revival of \"Gilmore Girls: A Year In The Life\" is now officially streaming. \nThe show likely made many fans feel happy and nostalgic — those four last words aside — while also moving the characters forward in a satisfying way. \nThere were also plenty of references to the series that may have gone over your head unless you're a die-hard fan. Keep reading so you can go back and catch them all. Let’s start with a classic: \"I smell snow,\" Lorelai tells Rory in the town square. Netflix Fans of the original series know that Lorelai has a keen sense for smelling when snow is about to fall. Lorelai smelling the first snow of the year.Warner Bros. \nIn episode eight of the first season, Lorelai tells Rory how much she loves the snow and that she can smell when it's coming. \nShe also says every good thing that's ever happened to her — her first kiss, Rory's first steps, her best birthday — happened when it was snowing. Lorelai is worried that celebrity chef Roy Choi is going to burn down the Dragonfly Inn's kitchen. Netflix \nLorelai has an ever revolving door of chefs coming in and out as she tries to replace her beloved best friend and the inn's chef, Sookie (Melissa McCarthy), during the revival. In the original series, the inn where Lorelai, Michele, and Sookie worked did burn down. Warner Bros. \nWhile working at the Independence Inn, a faulty wire causes a fire to break out and the Inn got shut down. \nIt eventually spurs Lorelai and Sookie to open the Dragonfly Inn together. Emily's new maid Berta is actually played by a Stars Hollow favorite. Netflix That's right — Rose Abdoo, who plays Gypsy in the series, also plays Berta! Netflix \n\"Rose read it for fun in a table read because they hadn't cast it yet, and she was so hilarious they had to double her up,\" Lauren Graham (Lorelai) tweeted about the casting. Gypsy tells Lorelai to buy a new car after fixing her Jeep Wrangler in \"Spring.\" Netflix Everyone should know by now that Lorelai will never get a new car. Warner Bros. \nIn season seven, Lorelai tries to buy a new car, but discovers that she doesn't like any car but her beloved Jeep. \nThe frustrating process of trying to find a car she likes ends up fixing her friendship with Luke, who ends up convincing Gypsy to install a new engine into her old car. There are also a few Easter eggs from the show at Richard's funeral, including a record Rory gave him. Netflix During the first season, Lorelai isn't sure what to get her father. She asks Rory, who says she got him \"Chuck Berry: Live at the Fillmore.\" Netflix and Wikimedia Commons \nThat album is on a table at the funeral, a touching reminder of Rory's relationship with her grandfather. And this picture was from the wedding vow renewal episode, which was also the \"Gilmore Girls\" 100th episode. Netflix The episode was called \"Wedding Bell Blues\" and it was a huge hit with critics and a wonderful glimpse into Emily and Richard's marriage. Warner Bros When Emily is Kondo-ing her home, she tells Lorelai: \"I was married for 50 years, half of me is gone.\" Netflix This bit of dialogue is a touching tribute to actor Edward Hermann. Netflix \nEdward Hermann played Richard Gilmore, the patriarch of the Gilmore family for the series' run. Hermann died in 2014 before the revival could happen. \nThe 50 year mark coincides with when Hermann died in real life: Emily and Richard married in 1964 and Hermann passed away in 2014. In the revival, Richard died in 2016, which means he and Emily would actually have been married for about 52 years. \nHonoring his actual passing could be a subtle nod to the actor from showrunner and creator Amy Sherman-Palladino. The Town Troubadour chases a competing singer through Stars Hollow. Netflix \nHe's played by singer-songwriter Grant-Lee Phillips. It mirrors a plotline from season one when the Town Troubadour becomes the only Town Troubadour. Warner Bros. \nThe Town Troubadour faces off against a rival Troubadour in season one of the series. During a town meeting, the issue is brought up and eventually, it's decided that the original Town Troubadour will be the official Town Troubadour. \nIn season six, he's tapped to tour with Neil Young, prompting a flock of hopeful singers to turn up in Stars Hollow to try and get discovered themselves. Eventually, the Town Troubadour returns and reclaims his rightful post. We finally saw Lane's dad, Mr. Kim, after all these years. Netflix \nFans have wondered for years about Lane's dad — where was he and why did we never see him? \nThis seemed like a very bizarre throwaway moment in the revival, but at least we know he's alive and well. Lorelai has another dream about Paul Anka, the dog and the man. Netflix \nShe tells Rory it's the third one she's had this year. Season six is when Lorelai has her first dream about Paul Anka. Warner Bros. The Gilmore Guys were invited to be a part of the revival. Netflix and Gilmore Guys/Facebook \n\"Gilmore Guys\" is a popular podcast that takes a deep dive into each \"Gilmore Girls\" episode. The pair kept it a secret from fans until the trailer debuted. Richard's will sets money aside for Luke to franchise Luke's Diner. Netflix \nIn the revival, Emily convinces Luke to look at possible locations with her. This plot line also played out in season five. Richard makes the suggestion when he and Luke go golfing at his club. Warner Bros. \nLuke frantically calls Lorelai after he golfs with her father and tells her, \"Your father wants to open up a chain of Luke’s Diners, and I think I agreed to it.\" \n\"There’s going to be seven of them, and that’s just on the eastern seaboard. Then, I’m going national,\" he says. \"I’ve already got a marketing guy, Herb’s my banker, your father is taking care of all my insurance needs, and apparently, everyone is going to be able to buy stock!\" \nLorelai eventually calms Luke down and straightens everything out with her father, but it appears Richard never let the dream die. Lorelai uses \"alumnus\" wrong. Netflix \nWhen she talks to Rory while she's at her Chilton alumni event, she asks \"How's my little alumnus doing?\" \nBut she should know that's not the proper term by now. When Rory was still in high school, she taught her mom the difference between alumna, alumni, and alumnus. Warner Bros. \nRory is preparing to meet a Harvard alumnus, and Lorelai begins teasing her: LORELAI: So, alumna is a girl graduate. RORY: Right. LORELAI: And alumnus is a man. RORY: Singular. LORELAI: So an unmarried man? RORY: No, not not-married. He can be married or single, all alumnus means is one man singular as opposed to many men plural. LORELAI: And plural is alumni. RORY: Right, and that can be girls and guys. LORELAI: Kinky! RORY: No, not kinky, just what it is. \nIt appears she forgot this lesson. The Chilton bathroom scene in the revival is a direct callback to season three. Netflix \nIn this scene, Paris mentions Chilton's uniform hemlines, Rory and Francie teaming up, and student council, practically all in one breath. The Chilton bathroom in the original series is where Francie intimidated Rory and tried to get her to vote for higher hemlines. Warner Bros. \nWhile Rory serves as vice president on student council, the girls' bathroom at Chilton becomes a virtual war room as Francie tries to manipulate Rory to go against Paris's wishes and vote for higher hemlines. Rory eventually stands up to Francie in the same bathroom. \nSeeing all three characters together again in one place was quite fun for fans. Taylor Doose references the Lazy-Hazy-Crazy Days of Summer event in \"Summer.\" Netflix It's from the first episode of season three when Taylor hires a choir to sing \"Lazy-Hazy-Crazy Days of Summer\" on repeat. Warner Bros. \nThe whole town gets the song stuck in their heads and are miserable. \n\"Oh, hey, I figured how to get the 'Lazy-Hazy-Crazy Days of Summer' out of our heads — to sing the 'Small World' song over and over for the next 48 hours,\" Lorelai says. \"Of course, how we get the 'Small World' song out of our heads, I have not worked out yet.\" Carole King sings \"Feel The Earth Move Under My Feet\" and no one recognizes it. Netflix \nKing plays Sophie, the sister of the Town Troubadour who owns a music store in town. \nIn the revival, she reprises her role and volunteers an \"original song\" that she says she's been working on — \"Feel The Earth Move Under My Feet\" — for Taylor to use. The fact that no one recognizes the song is a cute nod to the \"Gilmore Girls\" theme song. Warner Bros. \n\"Where You Lead,\" the famous \"Gilmore Girls\" theme song, was written by King. It's implied in the revival that in the world of \"Gilmore Girls,\" Carole King and her music don't exist. \nTaylor deems Sophie's song \"Feel The Earth Move Under My Feet\" not catchy enough. Logan and his friends show up to Stars Hollow wearing gorilla masks. Netflix The scene was an homage to when Rory first entered Logan's circle after she sees a girl wearing a gorilla mask. Warner Bros. \nRory first finds out about the Life and Death Brigade — the secret society at Yale that Logan is a part of — when a girl wearing a gorilla mask wanders into her bathroom. \nShe decides to investigate for the Yale Daily News, and ends up getting closer to Logan in the process. When Rory goes into Richard's study, you can see her painting above his desk. Netflix Emily had the portrait done in season one. It was Lorelai who suggested Rory read a book while she's posing. Warner Bros. \nRichard loved the painting, and showing his study exactly as he left it was likely another nod to Edward Shermann, who played Richard. Of course Miss Celine helps dress Lorelai for her wedding. Netflix Miss Celine was famous for her taste in fashion— not to mention telling everyone what celebrity they look like. Warner Bros. \nShe was Emily's personal stylist on the series and decided Rory looked like Audrey Hepburn while Lorelai looked like Natalie Wood. When Emily repeatedly tells Lorelai \"You need money\" in \"Fall,\" it's a direct tie to the first episode of \"Gilmore Girls.\" Netflix \nIn the revival, Lorelai needs money to help expand the Dragonfly Inn. Emily agrees, on the condition that Lorelai and Luke visit her every year in Nantucket. Richard originally said \"You need money\" multiple times when Lorelai asks her parents for a loan for Rory's Chilton education. Warner Bros. \nThey decide that Lorelai and Rory will also visit every Friday night for dinner as a part of the arangement. It's the start of a very complicated relationship between the four of them. \nYou can read more about the scene here. Rory shows Dean corn starch before he leave's Doose's Market after they run into each other in \"Fall.\" Netflix Dean tells her to pay for it this time — it's a reference to their first kiss. Netflix \nRory pretended she was buying corn starch when she was really looking at Dean at Doose's Market. She ended up taking the corn starch home with her accidentally after they kissed. Sookie makes a bunch of wedding cakes for Lorelai, and one of them is covered in daisies. Netflix Daisies are Lorelai's favorite flower. Warner Bros. \nIn the first season finale of \"Gilmoe Girls,\" Lorelai tells her then-boyfriend Max (Scott Cohen) that a proposal should have, \"a thousand yellow daisies, and candles, and a horse.\" \nMax takes Lorelai at her word and proposes with a thousand yellow daisies. Though the pair never got married, it was one of the show's most romantic moments. While they're getting ready for the wedding in the revival, eagle-eyed fans can spot this picture of Rory's 16th birthday by Jess's elbow. Netflix It's a picture from season one when Lorelai throws Rory a birthday party in their home. It's a nice reference to how far the series has come. Warner Bros.

      "text": "Shutterstock\n\nThe ONE feature Netflix users have been clamoring for above all is the ability to take episodes on the go, to watch Netflix content offline and save it for later. Well, at long last, Netflix just announced that this feature is officially live:\nAirplane mode. Road trip mode. Stuck-in-the-subway-for-20-minutes mode. Your favorite stories are now available for download any time. pic.twitter.com/g7QZA3TyE8 \n— Netflix US (@netflix) November 30, 2016 \nBroBible\n\nIf you live in NYC, Chicago, Boston, London, or anywhere with a subway system which runs underground then this is HUUUUGE. Or if you travel up in the sky on a regular basis and watch a ton of Netflix during your trips this is going to save you a fortune on upgrading your Internet speeds. Though, most airplane WiFi is complete dog shit and won’t allow you to stream video anyways (I’m looking at you GoGo, you should be ashamed of your speeds and service).\nPresumably, this new feature will come with an update to the Netflix mobile app for iOS and Android, and this will get rolled out in waves. So if you don’t have this feature instantly just hold tight, you’ll have it by the end of the day (according to Netflix’s tweet). I literally just got the app update while I was typing up this article, so yours is coming soon.\nThe ability to save content and watch it offline is a Netflix feature we’ve all known is ‘coming soon’ soon ever since Amazon Prime Video released that feature well over a year ago, but it’s always been unclear just how serious Netflix was about rolling this out.\nShare This\n",

The company said that many popular shows are already available to download -- including Orange is the New Black and The Crown -- with more coming soon. Netflix members worldwide can now download in addition to stream great series and films at no extra cost. While many members enjoy watching Netflix at home, weâve often heard they also want to continue their Stranger Things binge while on airplanes and other places where Internet is expensive or limited. Just click the download button on the details page for a film or TV series and you can watch it later without an internet connection. Any Netflix subscriber will have access to offline downloads, and the update will be available today to both the iOS [ Direct Link ] and Android versions of the mobile Netflix app. Netflix also tweeted out a video to celebrate the launch of downloading and watching \"your favorite stories\" while offline.",

      "text": "By Vlad Dudau   @avladd · 2 seconds ago with 0 comments \nAfter more than a year of speculation, public hints, denials and 180-degree turns , Netflix is finally bringing offline playback to all of its users. As of today, those using the latest version of the app on an Android or iOS device can save shows for offline viewing. \nNetflix had been rumored to be considering offline playback for more than a year now. In an effort to boost traction, engage more users in developing countries and decongest the pipes that make up the internet, the streaming app has now gone offline. \nThose looking to take advantage of the new features – say for viewing programs while on a plane, or without destroying your mobile data plan – can simply update to the latest version of the app and start binging offline. \nRight now, only some shows benefit from this functionality, though the company claims there are plenty that fit that list with many more coming soon. For example, Orange is the New Black, Narcos, and The Crown are available for downloading today. \nThe new feature is available for all subscription plans on phones and tablets running on Android and iOS.

      "text": "23 'Gilmore Girls' references you may have missed in the Netflix revival Tuesday Nov 29, 2016 at 11:33 AM Megan Willett, INSIDER - Business Insider \nWarning: Spoilers ahead for \"Gilmore Girls: A Year In The Life.\" \nNetflix's revival of \"Gilmore Girls: A Year In The Life\" is now officially streaming. \nThe show likely made many fans feel happy and nostalgic — those four last words aside — while also moving the characters forward in a satisfying way. \nThere were also plenty of references to the series that may have gone over your head unless you're a die-hard fan. Keep reading so you can go back and catch them all. Let’s start with a classic: \"I smell snow,\" Lorelai tells Rory in the town square. Netflix Fans of the original series know that Lorelai has a keen sense for smelling when snow is about to fall. Lorelai smelling the first snow of the year.Warner Bros. \nIn episode eight of the first season, Lorelai tells Rory how much she loves the snow and that she can smell when it's coming. \nShe also says every good thing that's ever happened to her — her first kiss, Rory's first steps, her best birthday — happened when it was snowing. Lorelai is worried that celebrity chef Roy Choi is going to burn down the Dragonfly Inn's kitchen. Netflix \nLorelai has an ever revolving door of chefs coming in and out as she tries to replace her beloved best friend and the inn's chef, Sookie (Melissa McCarthy), during the revival. In the original series, the inn where Lorelai, Michele, and Sookie worked did burn down. Warner Bros. \nWhile working at the Independence Inn, a faulty wire causes a fire to break out and the Inn got shut down. \nIt eventually spurs Lorelai and Sookie to open the Dragonfly Inn together. Emily's new maid Berta is actually played by a Stars Hollow favorite. Netflix That's right — Rose Abdoo, who plays Gypsy in the series, also plays Berta! Netflix \n\"Rose read it for fun in a table read because they hadn't cast it yet, and she was so hilarious they had to double her up,\" Lauren Graham (Lorelai) tweeted about the casting. Gypsy tells Lorelai to buy a new car after fixing her Jeep Wrangler in \"Spring.\" Netflix Everyone should know by now that Lorelai will never get a new car. Warner Bros. \nIn season seven, Lorelai tries to buy a new car, but discovers that she doesn't like any car but her beloved Jeep. \nThe frustrating process of trying to find a car she likes ends up fixing her friendship with Luke, who ends up convincing Gypsy to install a new engine into her old car. There are also a few Easter eggs from the show at Richard's funeral, including a record Rory gave him. Netflix During the first season, Lorelai isn't sure what to get her father. She asks Rory, who says she got him \"Chuck Berry: Live at the Fillmore.\" Netflix and Wikimedia Commons \nThat album is on a table at the funeral, a touching reminder of Rory's relationship with her grandfather. And this picture was from the wedding vow renewal episode, which was also the \"Gilmore Girls\" 100th episode. Netflix The episode was called \"Wedding Bell Blues\" and it was a huge hit with critics and a wonderful glimpse into Emily and Richard's marriage. Warner Bros When Emily is Kondo-ing her home, she tells Lorelai: \"I was married for 50 years, half of me is gone.\" Netflix This bit of dialogue is a touching tribute to actor Edward Hermann. Netflix \nEdward Hermann played Richard Gilmore, the patriarch of the Gilmore family for the series' run. Hermann died in 2014 before the revival could happen. \nThe 50 year mark coincides with when Hermann died in real life: Emily and Richard married in 1964 and Hermann passed away in 2014. In the revival, Richard died in 2016, which means he and Emily would actually have been married for about 52 years. \nHonoring his actual passing could be a subtle nod to the actor from showrunner and creator Amy Sherman-Palladino. The Town Troubadour chases a competing singer through Stars Hollow. Netflix \nHe's played by singer-songwriter Grant-Lee Phillips. It mirrors a plotline from season one when the Town Troubadour becomes the only Town Troubadour. Warner Bros. \nThe Town Troubadour faces off against a rival Troubadour in season one of the series. During a town meeting, the issue is brought up and eventually, it's decided that the original Town Troubadour will be the official Town Troubadour. \nIn season six, he's tapped to tour with Neil Young, prompting a flock of hopeful singers to turn up in Stars Hollow to try and get discovered themselves. Eventually, the Town Troubadour returns and reclaims his rightful post. We finally saw Lane's dad, Mr. Kim, after all these years. Netflix \nFans have wondered for years about Lane's dad — where was he and why did we never see him? \nThis seemed like a very bizarre throwaway moment in the revival, but at least we know he's alive and well. Lorelai has another dream about Paul Anka, the dog and the man. Netflix \nShe tells Rory it's the third one she's had this year. Season six is when Lorelai has her first dream about Paul Anka. Warner Bros. The Gilmore Guys were invited to be a part of the revival. Netflix and Gilmore Guys/Facebook \n\"Gilmore Guys\" is a popular podcast that takes a deep dive into each \"Gilmore Girls\" episode. The pair kept it a secret from fans until the trailer debuted. Richard's will sets money aside for Luke to franchise Luke's Diner. Netflix \nIn the revival, Emily convinces Luke to look at possible locations with her. This plot line also played out in season five. Richard makes the suggestion when he and Luke go golfing at his club. Warner Bros. \nLuke frantically calls Lorelai after he golfs with her father and tells her, \"Your father wants to open up a chain of Luke’s Diners, and I think I agreed to it.\" \n\"There’s going to be seven of them, and that’s just on the eastern seaboard. Then, I’m going national,\" he says. \"I’ve already got a marketing guy, Herb’s my banker, your father is taking care of all my insurance needs, and apparently, everyone is going to be able to buy stock!\" \nLorelai eventually calms Luke down and straightens everything out with her father, but it appears Richard never let the dream die. Lorelai uses \"alumnus\" wrong. Netflix \nWhen she talks to Rory while she's at her Chilton alumni event, she asks \"How's my little alumnus doing?\" \nBut she should know that's not the proper term by now. When Rory was still in high school, she taught her mom the difference between alumna, alumni, and alumnus. Warner Bros. \nRory is preparing to meet a Harvard alumnus, and Lorelai begins teasing her: LORELAI: So, alumna is a girl graduate. RORY: Right. LORELAI: And alumnus is a man. RORY: Singular. LORELAI: So an unmarried man? RORY: No, not not-married. He can be married or single, all alumnus means is one man singular as opposed to many men plural. LORELAI: And plural is alumni. RORY: Right, and that can be girls and guys. LORELAI: Kinky! RORY: No, not kinky, just what it is. \nIt appears she forgot this lesson. The Chilton bathroom scene in the revival is a direct callback to season three. Netflix \nIn this scene, Paris mentions Chilton's uniform hemlines, Rory and Francie teaming up, and student council, practically all in one breath. The Chilton bathroom in the original series is where Francie intimidated Rory and tried to get her to vote for higher hemlines. Warner Bros. \nWhile Rory serves as vice president on student council, the girls' bathroom at Chilton becomes a virtual war room as Francie tries to manipulate Rory to go against Paris's wishes and vote for higher hemlines. Rory eventually stands up to Francie in the same bathroom. \nSeeing all three characters together again in one place was quite fun for fans. Taylor Doose references the Lazy-Hazy-Crazy Days of Summer event in \"Summer.\" Netflix It's from the first episode of season three when Taylor hires a choir to sing \"Lazy-Hazy-Crazy Days of Summer\" on repeat. Warner Bros. \nThe whole town gets the song stuck in their heads and are miserable. \n\"Oh, hey, I figured how to get the 'Lazy-Hazy-Crazy Days of Summer' out of our heads — to sing the 'Small World' song over and over for the next 48 hours,\" Lorelai says. \"Of course, how we get the 'Small World' song out of our heads, I have not worked out yet.\" Carole King sings \"Feel The Earth Move Under My Feet\" and no one recognizes it. Netflix \nKing plays Sophie, the sister of the Town Troubadour who owns a music store in town. \nIn the revival, she reprises her role and volunteers an \"original song\" that she says she's been working on — \"Feel The Earth Move Under My Feet\" — for Taylor to use. The fact that no one recognizes the song is a cute nod to the \"Gilmore Girls\" theme song. Warner Bros. \n\"Where You Lead,\" the famous \"Gilmore Girls\" theme song, was written by King. It's implied in the revival that in the world of \"Gilmore Girls,\" Carole King and her music don't exist. \nTaylor deems Sophie's song \"Feel The Earth Move Under My Feet\" not catchy enough. Logan and his friends show up to Stars Hollow wearing gorilla masks. Netflix The scene was an homage to when Rory first entered Logan's circle after she sees a girl wearing a gorilla mask. Warner Bros. \nRory first finds out about the Life and Death Brigade — the secret society at Yale that Logan is a part of — when a girl wearing a gorilla mask wanders into her bathroom. \nShe decides to investigate for the Yale Daily News, and ends up getting closer to Logan in the process. When Rory goes into Richard's study, you can see her painting above his desk. Netflix Emily had the portrait done in season one. It was Lorelai who suggested Rory read a book while she's posing. Warner Bros. \nRichard loved the painting, and showing his study exactly as he left it was likely another nod to Edward Shermann, who played Richard. Of course Miss Celine helps dress Lorelai for her wedding. Netflix Miss Celine was famous for her taste in fashion — not to mention telling everyone what celebrity they look like. Warner Bros. \nShe was Emily's personal stylist on the series and decided Rory looked like Audrey Hepburn while Lorelai looked like Natalie Wood. When Emily repeatedly tells Lorelai \"You need money\" in \"Fall,\" it's a direct tie to the first episode of \"Gilmore Girls.\" Netflix \nIn the revival, Lorelai needs money to help expand the Dragonfly Inn. Emily agrees, on the condition that Lorelai and Luke visit her every year in Nantucket. Richard originally said \"You need money\" multiple times when Lorelai asks her parents for a loan for Rory's Chilton education. Warner Bros. \nThey decide that Lorelai and Rory will also visit every Friday night for dinner as a part of the arangement. It's the start of a very complicated relationship between the four of them. \nYou can read more about the scene here. Rory shows Dean corn starch before he leave's Doose's Market after they run into each other in \"Fall.\" Netflix Dean tells her to pay for it this time — it's a reference to their first kiss. Netflix \nRory pretended she was buying corn starch when she was really looking at Dean at Doose's Market. She ended up taking the corn starch home with her accidentally after they kissed. Sookie makes a bunch of wedding cakes for Lorelai, and one of them is covered in daisies. Netflix Daisies are Lorelai's favorite flower. Warner Bros. \nIn the first season finale of \"Gilmoe Girls,\" Lorelai tells her then-boyfriend Max (Scott Cohen) that a proposal should have, \"a thousand yellow daisies, and candles, and a horse.\" \nMax takes Lorelai at her word and proposes with a thousand yellow daisies. Though the pair never got married, it was one of the show's most romantic moments. While they're getting ready for the wedding in the revival, eagle-eyed fans can spot this picture of Rory's 16th birthday by Jess's elbow. Netflix It's a picture from season one when Lorelai throws Rory a birthday party in their home. It's a nice reference to how far the series has come. Warner Bros.

      "text": "As President-elect Donald Trump uses Twitter ( TWTR ) and online video to bypass the major media, perhaps this is the next logical step: Even the media are bypassing the media.\nAmazon.com ( AMZN ) and top execs from the big four networks will join Netflix ( NFLX ) in skipping the Television Critics Association's semiannual press event in January, the Hollywood Reporter said Tuesday, citing sources.\nAmazon will join web-streaming rival Netflix, which had previously said it would not attend the event in any capacity, according to the Reporter. Meanwhile, executives from Walt Disney ( DIS )-owned ABC, Comcast ( CMCSA )-owned NBC, CBS ( CBS ) and 21st Century Fox ( FOXA ) will not take part in panels. CW execs will take part.\nSeveral shows will participate, though the exec events have tended to make the bigger headlines over the years.\nThe networks reportedly are worried about the time and effort involved in taking part, especially for shows in production. Executives may not want to face a grilling from industry experts that can make or break their careers.\nAnd in an age of constant media coverage, with actors, producers and others on TV and social media frequently, content providers may feel they don't need the TCA as much to promote their shows.",

      "text": "Netflix has long said that it had no intention of ever offering an offline playback mode for when you're stuck on an airplane or anywhere else with no internet connection. But it seems like the company is changing course: An enigmatic tweet from the Netflix account says that \"your favorite stories are now available for download any time.\" It's accompanied by a cute video with scenes from a bunch of Netflix original shows, but it seems as if the feature won't be limited to only the company's original content. Regardless of any catches, the message is clear: Netflix will finally let us save shows to watch when we don't have an internet connection.\nAirplane mode. Road trip mode. Stuck-in-the-subway-for-20-minutes mode. Your favorite stories are now available for download any time. pic.twitter.com/g7QZA3TyE8\n— Netflix US (@netflix) November 30, 2016 In a press release that just dropped, Netflix says that the feature will arrive later today in an app update for iOS and Android. The feature is pretty straightforward -- when a show or movie is available to save offline, you'll see a little \"download\" button. Netflix notes that many of its big shows, including Orange is The New Black , Narcos and The Crown, are available to download today. Notably, those are all Netflix original shows -- we're not sure if things from other studios will be made available just yet. And it most definitely seems like the entire catalog will not be made available all at once -- but this is still a pretty big deal considering Netflix consistently rejected this feature in the past.\nOddly enough, Netflix publicly pondered offline playback pretty recently, but only as a way to make the product more appealing in developing markets where the internet infrastructure doesn't allow for continuous streaming like most of us in the US can experience. But it's probably a good idea not to restrict a feature that so many customers have been asking for for years, and that so many of Netflix's competitors are already offering.\nWe're reaching out to Netflix for more clarification and will update this post with any more details we receive.",

      "text": "Reddit \nNetflix is bringing offline playback to its streaming video service for the first time starting today. This means you won’t need an active Internet connection to watch movies and TV shows which is ideal for travel or other low-connection situations. \nThe new offline feature will be available on both iOS and Android versions of the Netflix app for any streaming plan on the service. A new download button will appear in an upcoming update to the app expected to arrive shortly. \nTo start, offline playback won’t be available on all titles. Netflix says it plans to add more titles to offline playback in the future however, suggesting it’s a rights issue: \nMany of your favorite streaming series and movies are already available for download, with more on the way, so there is plenty of content available for those times when you are offline. For example, Orange is The New Black, Narcos and The Crown are available for download today. \nNote that the titles that are available to download appear to be owned by Netflix. For comparison, Amazon’s competing video service through Prime allows for greater offline playback for now. Netflix’s announcement comes on the same day that AT&T launches its streaming live TV service called DirecTV Now , although the company has suggested using both DirecTV Now for live content and Netflix for its catalog of on-demand content. \nWatch out for an update to Netflix for iOS as soon as today to start using the new download feature for offline playback. Airplane mode. Road trip mode. Stuck-in-the-subway-for-20-minutes mode. Your favorite stories are now available for download any time. pic.twitter.com/g7QZA3TyE8 \n— Netflix US (@netflix) November 30, 2016 Guides",

Notably, those shows are all Netflix originals.\nNetflix is also adding an “Available for Download” option in its menu so that users can browse through all downloadable content. To access content that has already been downloaded to a mobile device, users can navigate to the app menu and select the “My Downloads” option. In this section of the app, users will be able to select individual TV episodes to watch and delete titles they no longer wish to save to their phone or tablet.\nThe new download option could help the company compete in global markets where wireless data connectivity is limited or expensive. It also comes as Amazon’s Netflix competitor, Amazon Prime Video, is set to see a massive global rollout .\n \n ",

      "text": "Netflix is adding the ability to download certain shows so they can be watched later without an Internet connection, the company announced on Wednesday.\nThe feature will begin rolling out immediately via an app update for iOS and Android devices. After updating to the most recent version of the Netflix app, users should see a download icon on the details page for certain TV shows.\nNetflix says shows like Orange is the New Black , Narcos , and The Crown, are already available for download, but hasn’t said how many shows in total will be watchable offline. Notably, those shows are all Netflix originals.\nNetflix is also adding an “Available for Download” option in its menu so that users can browse through all downloadable content. To access content that has already been downloaded to a mobile device, users can navigate to the app menu and select the “My Downloads” option. In this section of the app, users will be able to select individual TV episodes to watch and delete titles they no longer wish to save to their phone or tablet.\nThe new download option could help the company compete in global markets where wireless data connectivity is limited or expensive. It also comes as Amazon’s Netflix competitor, Amazon Prime Video, is set to see a massive global rollout .\n \n \n",

There's no extra cost for Netflix members.\nIn a CNBC interview earlier this month, chief content officer Ted Sarandos had hinted at a new offline mode to help audiences where high internet speeds are not present. \n— CNBC's Elizabeth Gurdus and Arujun Kharpal contributed to this report.",

That’s not a problem any longer: Netflix is, as promised , finally letting you download certain shows and movies for off-line viewing. \nAccording to a press release : \nMany of your favorite streaming series and movies are already available for download, with more on the way, so there is plenty of content available for those times when you are offline. For example, Orange is The New Black , Narcos , and The Crown are available for download today. ( Via ) \nEddy Wu, Netflix’s director of product innovation, said the downloads feature, which Amazon Prime Video debuted last year, was introduced because “while many members enjoy watching Netflix at home, we’ve often heard they also want to continue their Stranger Things ’ binge while on airplanes and other places where internet is expensive or limited.” There’s no need to make awkward chit-chat with strangers while 40,000 feet in the air ever again. BoJack Horseman season three is the only company you need. \nThe feature is currently available through the Netflix app for all plans. Airplane mode. Road trip mode. Stuck-in-the-subway-for-20-minutes mode. Your favorite stories are now available for download any time. pic.twitter.com/g7QZA3TyE8",

      "text": "NEW YORK (CNNMoney) — It just got even easier to binge on Netflix.\nNetflix announced on Wednesday members now have the option to download movies and shows to watch offline later. This means you can finally watch Gilmore Girls and Stranger Things while on a flight or stuck in the subway.\nThe feature comes free of cost with all Netflix memberships.\nUp until now, you need a place with a reliable internet connection to access the streaming service. But Netflix wants to make its product more nimble to suit the lives of those on-the-go.\nThe company previously argued the feature was unnecessary, calling it a “short term fix for a bigger problem.” That problem, of course, being wireless internet availability.\nBut its competitor Amazon Prime embraced offline downloads for iOS and Android users more than a year ago.\nAccording to Netflix’s Help Center page, “you’ll want to delete” downloaded titles before attempting to download a new content.\nIt is unclear as of now if there’s a cap on how many shows or films people can download at once.\nNetflix did not immediately respond to CNNMoney’s request for comment.",

      "text": "Inside Netflix's plan to get the entire world watching It just got even easier to binge on Netflix. Netflix announced on Wednesday members now have the option to download movies and shows to watch offline later. This means you can finally watch the new season of Gilmore Girls and Stranger Things while on a flight or stuck in the subway. \nThe feature comes free of cost with all Netflix ( NFLX , Tech30 ) memberships. \nUp until now, you need a place with a reliable internet connection to access the streaming service. But Netflix wants to make its product more nimble to suit the lives of those on-the-go. \nRelated: Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google still rule tech \nThe company previously argued the feature was unnecessary, calling it a \"short term fix for a bigger problem.\" That problem, of course, being wireless internet availability. \nBut its competitor Amazon Prime embraced offline downloads for iOS and Android users more than a year ago. \nAccording to Netflix's Help Center page, \"you'll want to delete\" downloaded titles before attempting to download a new content. \nIt is unclear as of now if there's a cap on how many shows or films people can download at once. \nNetflix did not immediately respond to CNNMoney's request for comment \nCNNMoney (New York)   30, 2016: 9:48 AM ET",

      "text": "Last Updated: NOV 30, 2016 New Delhi Email Author \nIn a major push for better user experience, Netflix on Wednesday announced that it now offers downloading of select videos on Android and iOS apps. The feature will work similar to how YouTube offline works. This means once a TV show or a movie is available for offline download on Netflix users will be able to tap on a download button in the Android or iOS app and will be able to watch the video even if the phone or tablet later doesn't have connectivity. \nThe new feature is very important for Netflix users in countries like India, where the internet connectivity is often not robust enough to support seamless streaming of high quality videos. \n\"While many members enjoy watching Netflix at home, we've often heard they also want to continue their binge (watching) while on airplanes and other places where internet is expensive or limited. Just click the download button on the details page for a film or TV series and you can watch it later without an internet connection,\" said Eddy Wu, director of product innovation. \"The new feature is included in all plans and available for phones and tablets on Android and iOS.\" Although in a way the appeal of the feature is still limited because the download feature is not supported on a web browser. But that is also understandable because allowing the download through a web browser will definitely help pirates.\nBut in the limited way, the download feature will help Netflix users enjoy better experience. \nUntil last year, Netflix was limited to a set of developed countries where good and reliable internet connectivity is available. But now Netflix on an expansion spree and its service is available almost all countries. But at the same time many of these countries, including India, do not have high-speed and cheap enough internet connection that can stream HD or FullHD videos without buffering. The new download feature will help Netflix reach out to these consumers. \nThis is a problem that YouTube realised earlier. To ensure that people in countries like India can get good YouTube experience, Google had earlier announced the offline mode for YouTube app on mobiles and tablets. \nThe move to bring download feature also marks a complete change in the stance the company earlier had on this matter. A few years ago when asked about the download feature, Netflix CEO Reed Hastings had said that it would never be done. He had said that slow internet was a problem that would be solved within a few years and that the download option, which he considered a bad solution to poor internet, wasn't needed on Netflix. But after the launch in countries like India, Hastings this year apparently changed his views and hinted that the company would consider the download option.

      "text": "Shutterstock\n\nThe ONE feature Netflix users have been clamoring for above all is the ability to take episodes on the go, to watch Netflix content offline and save it for later. Well, at long last, Netflix just announced that this feature is officially live:\nAirplane mode. Road trip mode. Stuck-in-the-subway-for-20-minutes mode. Your favorite stories are now available for download any time. pic.twitter.com/g7QZA3TyE8 \n— Netflix US (@netflix) November 30, 2016 \nBroBible\n\nIt’s simple: to save a TV episode or movie for offline viewing you just click that button to the right and you’re good to go (do this over wi-fi).\nIf you live in NYC, Chicago, Boston, London, or anywhere with a subway system which runs underground then this is HUUUUGE. Or if you travel up in the sky on a regular basis and watch a ton of Netflix during your trips this is going to save you a fortune on upgrading your Internet speeds. Though, most airplane WiFi is complete dog shit and won’t allow you to stream video anyways (I’m looking at you GoGo, you should be ashamed of your speeds and service).\nPresumably, this new feature will come with an update to the Netflix mobile app for iOS and Android, and this will get rolled out in waves. So if you don’t have this feature instantly just hold tight, you’ll have it by the end of the day (according to Netflix’s tweet). I literally just got the app update while I was typing up this article, so yours is coming soon.\nThe ability to save content and watch it offline is a Netflix feature we’ve all known is ‘coming soon’ soon ever since Amazon Prime Video released that feature well over a year ago, but it’s always been unclear just how serious Netflix was about rolling this out.\n\n",

(NFLX) said Wednesday morning it is rolling out the ability to download TV series and films, a feature lauded on other platforms such as Amazon.com Inc.'s (AMZN) Prime Video. More and more consumers are watching video content on the go where cellular and wireless internet connections can be spotty, at best. The feature is available Wednesday for all plans and across all available devices, Director of Product Innovation Eddy Wu wrote in a blog post on the company's site. It's not clear exactly how many series and films are available for download. In the blog post Wu writes many of viewers favorite series are available, with more on the way. Shares of Netflix are up nearly 3% in the year to date, underperforming the S&P 500 Index , which is up almost 8%.\n-Trey Williams; 0919ET\n ",

REUTERS/Mike Blake/File Photo \nVideo streaming pioneer Netflix Inc said its subscribers would now be able to download popular shows such as \"Orange is The New Black\" and \"Narcos\" on their mobile devices at no extra cost. \n\"While many members enjoy watching Netflix at home, we've often heard they also want to continue their 'Stranger Things' binge while on airplanes and other places where Internet is expensive or limited,\" Eddy Wu, director of product innovation, wrote in a blog post. \nNetflix, whose other popular original shows include \"House of Cards\" and \"The Crown\", has expanded into almost all countries, with China being a notable exception. \nThe new feature is included in all plans and available for phones and tablets on Alphabet Inc's Android and Apple Inc's iOS platforms, the company said. \nMore content will be available for offline viewing later, Netflix said. \nThe company's shares rose 2 percent to $119.97 in early trading on the Nasdaq. \n(Reporting by Supantha Mukherjee in Bengaluru; Editing by Saumyadeb Chakrabarty) Next In Technology News",

      "text": "on Wednesday November 30, 2016 @09:45AM from the offline-playback dept. For years, people asked Netflix to give them the ability to download movies and TV episodes. Though this might not seem like that big of a deal in many regions where internet connectivity is cheap and omnipresent, same is not the case everywhere, especially in developing regions. Netflix is finally addressing this need: the on-demand media streaming service said Wednesday that people can now download shows on their Android and iOS devices . From the company's blog post: Just click the download button on the details page for a film or TV series and you can watch it later without an internet connection. Many of your favorite streaming series and movies are already available for download, with more on the way, so there is plenty of content available for those times when you are offline. It's worth pointing out that the offline playback -- or the ability to download videos isn't available on desktop platforms. Also, it appears that a heck lot of shows currently don't have this feature -- as of today.",

This means you can finally watch Gilmore Girls and Stranger Things while on a flight or stuck in the subway. \nThe feature comes free of cost with all Netflix memberships. \nUp until now, you need a place with a reliable internet connection to access the streaming service. But Netflix wants to make its product more nimble to suit the lives of those on-the-go. \nThe company previously argued the feature was unnecessary, calling it a \"short term fix for a bigger problem.\" That problem, of course, being wireless internet availability. \nBut its competitor Amazon Prime embraced offline downloads for iOS and Android users more than a year ago. \nAccording to Netflix's Help Center page, \"you'll want to delete\" downloaded titles before attempting to download a new content. \nIt is unclear as of now if there's a cap on how many shows or films people can download at once. \nNetflix did not immediately respond to CNNMoney's request for comment \nTM &© 2016 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

Keep reading so you can go back and catch them all. Let’s start with a classic: \"I smell snow,\" Lorelai tells Rory in the town square. Netflix Fans of the original series know that Lorelai has a keen sense for smelling when snow is about to fall. Lorelai smelling the first snow of the year.Warner Bros. \nIn episode eight of the first season, Lorelai tells Rory how much she loves the snow and that she can smell when it's coming. \nShe also says every good thing that's ever happened to her — her first kiss, Rory's first steps, her best birthday — happened when it was snowing. Lorelai is worried that celebrity chef Roy Choi is going to burn down the Dragonfly Inn's kitchen. Netflix \nLorelai has an ever revolving door of chefs coming in and out as she tries to replace her beloved best friend and the inn's chef, Sookie (Melissa McCarthy), during the revival. In the original series, the inn where Lorelai, Michele, and Sookie worked did burn down. Warner Bros. \nWhile working at the Independence Inn, a faulty wire causes a fire to break out and the Inn got shut down. \nIt eventually spurs Lorelai and Sookie to open the Dragonfly Inn together. Emily's new maid Berta is actually played by a Stars Hollow favorite. Netflix That's right — Rose Abdoo, who plays Gypsy in the series, also plays Berta! Netflix \n\"Rose read it for fun in a table read because they hadn't cast it yet, and she was so hilarious they had to double her up,\" Lauren Graham (Lorelai) tweeted about the casting. Gypsy tells Lorelai to buy a new car after fixing her Jeep Wrangler in \"Spring.\" Netflix Everyone should know by now that Lorelai will never get a new car. Warner Bros. \nIn season seven, Lorelai tries to buy a new car, but discovers that she doesn't like any car but her beloved Jeep. \nThe frustrating process of trying to find a car she likes ends up fixing her friendship with Luke, who ends up convincing Gypsy to install a new engine into her old car. There are also a few Easter eggs from the show at Richard's funeral, including a record Rory gave him. Netflix During the first season, Lorelai isn't sure what to get her father. She asks Rory, who says she got him \"Chuck Berry: Live at the Fillmore.\" Netflix and Wikimedia Commons \nThat album is on a table at the funeral, a touching reminder of Rory's relationship with her grandfather. And this picture was from the wedding vow renewal episode, which was also the \"Gilmore Girls\" 100th episode. Netflix The episode was called \"Wedding Bell Blues\" and it was a huge hit with critics and a wonderful glimpse into Emily and Richard's marriage. Warner Bros When Emily is Kondo-ing her home, she tells Lorelai: \"I was married for 50 years, half of me is gone.\" Netflix This bit of dialogue is a touching tribute to actor Edward Hermann. Netflix \nEdward Hermann played Richard Gilmore, the patriarch of the Gilmore family for the series' run. Hermann died in 2014 before the revival could happen. \nThe 50 year mark coincides with when Hermann died in real life: Emily and Richard married in 1964 and Hermann passed away in 2014. In the revival, Richard died in 2016, which means he and Emily would actually have been married for about 52 years. \nHonoring his actual passing could be a subtle nod to the actor from showrunner and creator Amy Sherman-Palladino. The Town Troubadour chases a competing singer through Stars Hollow. Netflix \nHe's played by singer-songwriter Grant-Lee Phillips. It mirrors a plotline from season one when the Town Troubadour becomes the only Town Troubadour. Warner Bros. \nThe Town Troubadour faces off against a rival Troubadour in season one of the series. During a town meeting, the issue is brought up and eventually, it's decided that the original Town Troubadour will be the official Town Troubadour. \nIn season six, he's tapped to tour with Neil Young, prompting a flock of hopeful singers to turn up in Stars Hollow to try and get discovered themselves. Eventually, the Town Troubadour returns and reclaims his rightful post. We finally saw Lane's dad, Mr. Kim, after all these years. Netflix \nFans have wondered for years about Lane's dad — where was he and why did we never see him? \nThis seemed like a very bizarre throwaway moment in the revival, but at least we know he's alive and well. Lorelai has another dream about Paul Anka, the dog and the man. Netflix \nShe tells Rory it's the third one she's had this year. Season six is when Lorelai has her first dream about Paul Anka. Warner Bros. The Gilmore Guys were invited to be a part of the revival. Netflix and Gilmore Guys/Facebook \n\"Gilmore Guys\" is a popular podcast that takes a deep dive into each \"Gilmore Girls\" episode. The pair kept it a secret from fans until the trailer debuted. Richard's will sets money aside for Luke to franchise Luke's Diner. Netflix \nIn the revival, Emily convinces Luke to look at possible locations with her. This plot line also played out in season five. Richard makes the suggestion when he and Luke go golfing at his club. Warner Bros. \nLuke frantically calls Lorelai after he golfs with her father and tells her, \"Your father wants to open up a chain of Luke’s Diners, and I think I agreed to it.\" \n\"There’s going to be seven of them, and that’s just on the eastern seaboard. Then, I’m going national,\" he says. \"I’ve already got a marketing guy, Herb’s my banker, your father is taking care of all my insurance needs, and apparently, everyone is going to be able to buy stock!\" \nLorelai eventually calms Luke down and straightens everything out with her father, but it appears Richard never let the dream die. Lorelai uses \"alumnus\" wrong. Netflix \nWhen she talks to Rory while she's at her Chilton alumni event, she asks \"How's my little alumnus doing?\" \nBut she should know that's not the proper term by now. When Rory was still in high school, she taught her mom the difference between alumna, alumni, and alumnus. Warner Bros. \nRory is preparing to meet a Harvard alumnus, and Lorelai begins teasing her: LORELAI: So, alumna is a girl graduate. RORY: Right. LORELAI: And alumnus is a man. RORY: Singular. LORELAI: So an unmarried man? RORY: No, not not-married. He can be married or single, all alumnus means is one man singular as opposed to many men plural. LORELAI: And plural is alumni. RORY: Right, and that can be girls and guys. LORELAI: Kinky! RORY: No, not kinky, just what it is. \nIt appears she forgot this lesson. The Chilton bathroom scene in the revival is a direct callback to season three. Netflix \nIn this scene, Paris mentions Chilton's uniform hemlines, Rory and Francie teaming up, and student council, practically all in one breath. The Chilton bathroom in the original series is where Francie intimidated Rory and tried to get her to vote for higher hemlines. Warner Bros. \nWhile Rory serves as vice president on student council, the girls' bathroom at Chilton becomes a virtual war room as Francie tries to manipulate Rory to go against Paris's wishes and vote for higher hemlines. Rory eventually stands up to Francie in the same bathroom. \nSeeing all three characters together again in one place was quite fun for fans. Taylor Doose references the Lazy-Hazy-Crazy Days of Summer event in \"Summer.\" Netflix It's from the first episode of season three when Taylor hires a choir to sing \"Lazy-Hazy-Crazy Days of Summer\" on repeat. Warner Bros. \nThe whole town gets the song stuck in their heads and are miserable. \n\"Oh, hey, I figured how to get the 'Lazy-Hazy-Crazy Days of Summer' out of our heads — to sing the 'Small World' song over and over for the next 48 hours,\" Lorelai says. \"Of course, how we get the 'Small World' song out of our heads, I have not worked out yet.\" Carole King sings \"Feel The Earth Move Under My Feet\" and no one recognizes it. Netflix \nKing plays Sophie, the sister of the Town Troubadour who owns a music store in town. \nIn the revival, she reprises her role and volunteers an \"original song\" that she says she's been working on — \"Feel The Earth Move Under My Feet\" — for Taylor to use. The fact that no one recognizes the song is a cute nod to the \"Gilmore Girls\" theme song. Warner Bros. \n\"Where You Lead,\" the famous \"Gilmore Girls\" theme song, was written by King. It's implied in the revival that in the world of \"Gilmore Girls,\" Carole King and her music don't exist. \nTaylor deems Sophie's song \"Feel The Earth Move Under My Feet\" not catchy enough. Logan and his friends show up to Stars Hollow wearing gorilla masks. Netflix The scene was an homage to when Rory first entered Logan's circle after she sees a girl wearing a gorilla mask. Warner Bros. \nRory first finds out about the Life and Death Brigade — the secret society at Yale that Logan is a part of— when a girl wearing a gorilla mask wanders into her bathroom. \nShe decides to investigate for the Yale Daily News, and ends up getting closer to Logan in the process. When Rory goes into Richard's study, you can see her painting above his desk. Netflix Emily had the portrait done in season one. It was Lorelai who suggested Rory read a book while she's posing. Warner Bros. \nRichard loved the painting, and showing his study exactly as he left it was likely another nod to Edward Shermann, who played Richard. Of course Miss Celine helps dress Lorelai for her wedding. Netflix Miss Celine was famous for her taste in fashion — not to mention telling everyone what celebrity they look like. Warner Bros. \nShe was Emily's personal stylist on the series and decided Rory looked like Audrey Hepburn while Lorelai looked like Natalie Wood. When Emily repeatedly tells Lorelai \"You need money\" in \"Fall,\" it's a direct tie to the first episode of \"Gilmore Girls.\" Netflix \nIn the revival, Lorelai needs money to help expand the Dragonfly Inn. Emily agrees, on the condition that Lorelai and Luke visit her every year in Nantucket. Richard originally said \"You need money\" multiple times when Lorelai asks her parents for a loan for Rory's Chilton education. Warner Bros. \nThey decide that Lorelai and Rory will also visit every Friday night for dinner as a part of the arangement. It's the start of a very complicated relationship between the four of them. \nYou can read more about the scene here. Rory shows Dean corn starch before he leave's Doose's Market after they run into each other in \"Fall.\" Netflix Dean tells her to pay for it this time — it's a reference to their first kiss. Netflix \nRory pretended she was buying corn starch when she was really looking at Dean at Doose's Market. She ended up taking the corn starch home with her accidentally after they kissed. Sookie makes a bunch of wedding cakes for Lorelai, and one of them is covered in daisies. Netflix Daisies are Lorelai's favorite flower. Warner Bros. \nIn the first season finale of \"Gilmoe Girls,\" Lorelai tells her then-boyfriend Max (Scott Cohen) that a proposal should have, \"a thousand yellow daisies, and candles, and a horse.\" \nMax takes Lorelai at her word and proposes with a thousand yellow daisies. Though the pair never got married, it was one of the show's most romantic moments. While they're getting ready for the wedding in the revival, eagle-eyed fans can spot this picture of Rory's 16th birthday by Jess's elbow. Netflix It's a picture from season one when Lorelai throws Rory a birthday party in their home. It's a nice reference to how far the series has come. Warner Bros.

      "text": "Tablets aren't just for binge-watching the new Netflix \"Gilmore Girls\" miniseries or perusing the fake news on your Facebook feed . You can also put that bad boy to work as a second display.\nTwo displays for a single computer give you more space to spread out your documents, spreadsheets and web browsers. If you already own an Android tablet, why not? It's cheaper than buying an extra monitor and only requires a few app downloads.\nThere are a few apps that let you do this, but for this guide, I've chosen iDisplay since it it has options for multiple platforms.\nEnlarge Image Use your tablet as a second display to multitask easily.\nPhoto by Xiomara Blanco/CNET What you need A Wi-Fi connection An Android tablet running Android 2.01 or newer, or an iPad running iOS 7 or later A PC running Windows XP, Vista or 7 (32-bit or 64-bit), or a Mac computer running, OS X Mavericks 10.9 or newer 1. Install iDisplay on your tablet You can easily find the app in the Google Play Store ($5.99) or Apple App Store ($19.99). No, the apps aren't free, but they're cheaper than a new monitor. Once installed and opened, you'll see one option -- connect via USB. (I found this method worked inconsistently, if ever.) To connect via Wi-Fi instead, you have to download iDisplay for your PC or Mac (see step 2), before this option appears. When connecting via Wi-Fi, you have to make sure both tablet and computer are connected to the same network.\n2. Install iDisplay on your computer iDisplay is available for Windows and Mac and both work the same way. Once downloaded, you can install the software in just a few clicks. The installation requires you to reboot the machine.\nEnlarge Image Once iDisplay is downloaded onto your computer, you should see it pop up on your tablet's screen.\nPhoto by Josh Miller/CNET 3. Pairing with the tablet Once rebooted, click on the icon to start up iDisplay. If using a PC, a Windows Firewall exception request may appear. After allowing the exception -- and making sure both devices are connected to the same wireless network -- you can make a connection between the tablet and the computer. \nWhen you attempt to connect, a dialog box pops up and you can either allow iDisplay to connect to the tablet once only, always allow it to connect, or deny it. If you plan on using it often, select \"always allow.\"\nOn the tablet, a list of devices which the tablet can pair with will show up on the app. Tapping on the device you want to pair with will then connect the tablet to the computer.\nEnlarge Image You can also use iDisplay to mirror your display.\nPhoto by Xiomara Blanco/CNET 4. Optimize After connecting, you can adjust the display size. In the settings page (the cog icon in the top-right corner of the connection page in the iDisplay app on your tablet), you can choose from four different resolutions. A higher resolution works better on the small tablet. (Choosing a smaller resolution results in the tablet displaying windows with huge text and overstretched pictures.)\nOn your computer, you can also right-click on the system tray icon to quit iDisplay or bring up the \"Display Arrangement\" option, which allows you to select where you want the tablet to be relative to the main display. \nPerformance of the tablet display can vary depending on the speed of your Wi-Fi connection (a faster network will increase the responsiveness of the display), as well as the tablet's processor speeds and graphics capabilities.\n ",

      "text": "Netflix has begun rolling out the ability to download videos from its streaming service to smartphones and tablets for offline viewing.\n\nOffline viewing is arguably the most demanded feature by users, and one of the things that differentiated other services including Amazon’s Instant Video streaming video service and pay TV services such as Sky and Virgin.\nEddy Wu, Netflix director of product innovation, said : “While many members enjoy watching Netflix at home, we’ve often heard they also want to continue their Stranger Things binge while on airplanes and other places where internet is expensive or limited.”\nThe feature is available from today on Android and iOS devices, and includes “many” TV series and movies, including Netflix’s original content such as Orange is The New Black, Narcos and the recently released The Crown . The company says that more will be made available soon.\n\nNetflix begins offline downloads. Photograph: Netflix Video downloads will be provided at no added cost within the service’s existing monthly subscription fees, which start at £5.99 a month.\nNetflix is locked in a battle with streaming rival Amazon, as well as traditional broadcasters which are making in-roads into “over the top” streaming services. Having previously targeted expansive libraries of content within different regions as a method of differentiation and attracting large subscriber bases, original content – that created or paid for by the streaming service instead of bought after broadcast – has become the focus.\nNetflix has shows such as Stranger Things , Kevin Spacey’s House of Cards and Tina Fey’s Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt, while Amazon has put money into shows such as Transparent, Alpha House, The Man in the High Castle and the recent release of The Grand Tour – a Top Gear-like show from Jeremy Clarkson, James May and Richard Hammond.\nAmazon’s service has had offline viewing for a while through its Amazon Instant Video app for iOS and Android .",

      "text": "Netflix Finally Allows Offline Playback…GREAT In-Flight Entertainment Option! November 30, 2016 by Enoch Leave A Comment \nThis has nothing to do directly with points and miles, but is something that I know a lot of flyers (myself included) have been hoping for. Netflix is finally adding offline playback! This means you will be able to download and save content from Netflix for your next long-haul flight, or for watching abroad. This is huge , especially in light of the fact that Netflix said , literally, “it will never happen” to offline viewing less than 2 years ago. Never say never! http://pointmetotheplane.boardingarea.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Rrd71FHdcDiM0Id0.mp4 \nWhile many global airlines have a decent selection of in-flight entertainment—heck, you can even take a class while in the air —that’s not universal. Sometimes you can get stuck on a 16-hour flight with just one episode of 10 different TV shows, or on a United 747 with just mains screen programming. In-flight Wi-Fi is getting faster, and some airlines like JetBlue will even let you stream content live, but you’re mostly out of luck on long haul flights. Finally, nothing beats your personal selections. \nI have been renting and buying TV episodes from iTunes, or downloading selections from Amazon Instant Video (which does allow offline playback) to use as my personal in-flight entertainment. However, buying and renting episodes can get expensive, and Amazon doesn’t have the widest selection out there. That’s why Netflix’s offline playback will be an amazing addition for me, and I imagine for many others as well. \nOf course, with the ability to download shows, you can also save them for viewing once you’re abroad, which may not have the same selection. You can now download selected content from Netflix for offline viewing. \nThe functionality will be available on smartphones and tablets, and will require an app update. The update is already available, but Netflix says it might take a while to appear in the app stores. There will be two quality options for downloads , Standard and High Quality, though Netflix didn’t specify the resolutions. \nAre you excited about the ability to watch Netflix videos offline?",

      "text": "NEW YORK (CNNMoney) — It just got even easier to binge on Netflix.\nNetflix announced on Wednesday members now have the option to download movies and shows to watch offline later. This means you can finally watch Gilmore Girls and Stranger Things while on a flight or stuck in the subway.\nThe feature comes free of cost with all Netflix memberships.\nUp until now, you need a place with a reliable internet connection to access the streaming service. But Netflix wants to make its product more nimble to suit the lives of those on-the-go.\nThe company previously argued the feature was unnecessary, calling it a “short term fix for a bigger problem.” That problem, of course, being wireless internet availability.\nBut its competitor Amazon Prime embraced offline downloads for iOS and Android users more than a year ago.\nAccording to Netflix’s Help Center page, “you’ll want to delete” downloaded titles before attempting to download a new content.\nIt is unclear as of now if there’s a cap on how many shows or films people can download at once.\nNetflix did not immediately respond to CNNMoney’s request for comment",

      "text": "Has Netflix become too big to fail, even as video streaming competition intensifies, and its subscription fees rise ? The American multinational entertainment company doesn’t want to find that out the hard way, keeping DirecTV Now at bay with a long overdue mobile app update.\nStarting today, both Android users on platform version 4.4.2 or later, and iOS device streamers running at least 8.0 can download their favorite TV shows and movies for offline viewing. As Netflix puts it, the market-leading VOD service finally features an “airplane mode”, “road trip mode”, “stuck-in-the-subway-for-20-minutes mode” to bring your “favorite stories” just one tap away at all times.\nNo extra costs, no strings attached, no download or playback limits and restrictions (we presume), and yes, offline viewing capabilities are “included in all plans” and available for all relatively new Android and iOS phones and tablets.\nIt’s also extremely simple to locate the download button on the details page of a film, TV or web series, and while parts of Netflix’s ginormous content library can’t be watched when disconnected from the internet yet, “Orange is The New Black”, “Narcos”, “The Crown”, “House of Cards”, “Stranger Things” and “Master of None” headline the list of downloadable shows right off the bat.\nThe post Netflix brings its rich content library offline for Android and iOS downloads appeared first on Pocketnow .\n",
