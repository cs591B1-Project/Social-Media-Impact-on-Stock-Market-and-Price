CEO Mark Fields says the presidential election won't change the company's plans to move small car production to Mexico. \nPresident-elect Donald Trump has repeatedly criticized Ford for moving production to Mexico. Trump wants to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement and has called for a 35-percent tariff on goods shipped from Mexico. \nIn an interview with CNBC Tuesday, Fields said Ford is proceeding with its plan to move Focus car production from Michigan to a new plant in Mexico by 2018. He stressed that no jobs will be lost, since the Michigan plant will make two other vehicles. \nFields also warned that a tariff would affect the entire industry - and autoworkers' profit-sharing checks - since many companies sell Mexican- and Canadian-made vehicles or parts.

REUTERS/Lucy Nicholson \nLOS ANGELES Ford Motor Co ( F.N ) Chief Executive Officer Mark Fields told Reuters on Tuesday the U.S. automaker is moving ahead with plans to shift production of small cars to Mexico from Michigan, and assign \"two very important products\" for the U.S. factory to build. \n\"We’re going forward with our plan to move production of the Ford Focus to Mexico, and importantly that’s to make room for two very important products we’ll be putting back into Michigan plants,\" Fields said in an interview on the sidelines of the Los Angeles Auto Show. \"There will be no job impact whatsoever with this move.\" \nPresident-elect Donald Trump has criticized Ford for the decision to shift production of Focus small cars to Mexico in 2018, and said he would consider levying tariffs on Mexican-made Fords. \n\n(Reporting by Joe White; Editing by Lisa Shumaker) Next In Business News",

      "text": "FCC Documents Ford CEO says production plans on track despite election \nDETROIT (AP) - Ford Motor Co. CEO Mark Fields says the presidential election won't change the company's plans to move small car production to Mexico. \nPresident-elect Donald Trump has repeatedly criticized Ford for moving production to Mexico. Trump wants to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement and has called for a 35-percent tariff on goods shipped from Mexico. \nIn an interview with CNBC Tuesday, Fields said Ford is proceeding with its plan to move Focus car production from Michigan to a new plant in Mexico by 2018. He stressed that no jobs will be lost, since the Michigan plant will make two other vehicles. \nFields also warned that a tariff would affect the entire industry - and autoworkers' profit-sharing checks - since many companies sell Mexican- and Canadian-made vehicles or parts.

      "text": "St. Paul just took a big step in the future look of redeveloped Ford plant LOVE AND LIGHT, PEOPLE \nThe world fell on its head election night. Everything is for a reason. Trump is the catalyst for the healing that America so desperately needs. It will take a while; there will be riots; there will be screaming; in the end, it will be beautiful. Like a wildfire set to stop a wildfire, the end result is beauty. \nSo who’s spewing hatred now? Those who criticized Trump for his remarks — yet no one will say anything about those spewing it now. Hatred is hatred no matter who says it. Love and light, people, love and light. \nMark Krey, St. Paul \nA TEACHABLE MOMENT \nDo the St. Paul schools really need “additional emotional-support staff” for students upset by the election results? Why can’t teachers use the election results as a teachable moment? Instead, this teachable moment was squandered, especially by the 218 teachers who were absent from the classroom … apparently “sick.” I wonder if “support staff” would have been available for children of the “silent majority,” had Hillary Clinton been elected. A golden opportunity to teach the pros and cons of a democracy was wasted. \nDavid E. Wolff, White Bear Township \nSOMETHING POSITIVE \nIn light of the way the pendulum of the nation swung on Tuesday, I found myself looking for something positive to do. Mourning and anger were needed, but now it’s time to feverishly organize. I don’t have much disposable income, but I know money talks. Stand against hate and xenophobia of all kinds and make a financial contribution to the ACLU, Planned Parenthood, Habitat for Humanity and other like causes (particularly in rural areas). Nonprofits like these will be doing the work the government won’t for at least four years. \nBill Haugen, St. Paul \nCARBON FEE \nMany of us were hoping continued efforts from the U.S. EPA and international agreements would reduce carbon dioxide emissions and mercury pollution from coal. After the recent election, all of this will be lost. The battle therefore needs to turn local. Here in Minnesota, we can propose a symbolic, penny-a-ton carbon fee. This will raise just $178,000 annually, not impact electric rates and send a strong message around the globe. The new Congress and president should go into a rage, and this will hopefully end up in court. If we can stay focused on ocean damage, where the science is flawless, and away from the debates about weather and warming, we should win. Then, even without any federal help, utilities can be gently persuaded to find cleaner sources of base-load power. \nErik Westgard, Shoreview \nThe writer is an adjunct faculty member in the College of Management at Metropolitan State University.",

More >> More >> \nDETROIT (AP) - Ford Motor Co. CEO Mark Fields says the presidential election won't change the company's plans to move small car production to Mexico. \nPresident-elect Donald Trump has repeatedly criticized Ford for moving production to Mexico. Trump wants to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement and has called for a 35-percent tariff on goods shipped from Mexico. \nIn an interview with CNBC Tuesday, Fields said Ford is proceeding with its plan to move Focus car production from Michigan to a new plant in Mexico by 2018. He stressed that no jobs will be lost, since the Michigan plant will make two other vehicles. \nFields also warned that a tariff would affect the entire industry - and autoworkers' profit-sharing checks - since many companies sell Mexican- and Canadian-made vehicles or parts.

CEO Mark Fields says the presidential election won't change the company's plans to move small car production to Mexico. \nPresident-elect Donald Trump has repeatedly criticized Ford for moving production to Mexico. Trump wants to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement and has called for a 35-percent tariff on goods shipped from Mexico. \nIn an interview with CNBC Tuesday, Fields said Ford is proceeding with its plan to move Focus car production from Michigan to a new plant in Mexico by 2018. He stressed that no jobs will be lost, since the Michigan plant will make two other vehicles. \nFields also warned that a tariff would affect the entire industry - and autoworkers' profit-sharing checks - since many companies sell Mexican- and Canadian-made vehicles or parts.

      "text": "DETROIT (AP) - Ford Motor Co. CEO Mark Fields says the presidential election won't change the company's plans to move small car production to Mexico.\nPresident-elect Donald Trump has repeatedly criticized Ford for moving production to Mexico. Trump wants to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement and has called for a 35-percent tariff on goods shipped from Mexico.\nIn an interview with CNBC Tuesday, Fields said Ford is proceeding with its plan to move Focus car production from Michigan to a new plant in Mexico by 2018. He stressed that no jobs will be lost, since the Michigan plant will make two other vehicles.\nFields also warned that a tariff would affect the entire industry - and autoworkers' profit-sharing checks - since many companies sell Mexican- and Canadian-made vehicles or parts.\nCopyright 2016 The Associated Press.

      "text": "Ford CEO Criticizes Trump Auto-Tariff Proposal November 15, 2016, 01:45:  \nFord Motor Co. Chief Executive Mark Fields warned President-elect Donald Trump's proposal that placing high tariffs on automobiles and other products coming from outside the U.S. would have negative consequences for the auto industry and beyond. \nA steep tariff \"would be imposed on the entire auto sector and that could have a huge impact on the U.S. economy,\" Mr. Fields told reporters on Tuesday on the sidelines of the Automobility LA car show. \"I continue to be convinced that the right policies will prevail because I think we all share the same objective which is a healthy and vibrant U.S. economy.\" \nMr. Fields said the company will stick with plans to assemble cars in Mexico, which Mr. Trump has singled out as a serious problem for American workers. The executive said Ford has been in touch with Mr. Trump's transition team as the president-elect prepares to take office in January. \nIt was Mr. Fields first public appearance since Mr. Trump was elected to the White House after a campaign that often had Ford in its crosshairs for manufacturing its products outside the U.S. \nCriticism of Ford reflected a wider concern that the U.S. is losing well-paying manufacturing jobs to countries such as Mexico and China. Mr. Trump has said he would renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement that came into force in 1994 and has been widely criticized as encouraging the offshoring of U.S. jobs. \nMr. Trump has also vowed to impose steep tariffs on Ford if the Dearborn, Mich., auto maker carries out its plan to move assembly of its Focus compact car to Mexico from Wayne, Mich. The company has said the move won't result in American job losses. \nMr. Fields reiterated Ford plans to move forward with its Mexico plans that he said will make room for two new products at the U.S. factory. \nOn Monday night, at a party on Hollywood Boulevard near the Dolby Theatre, Ford unveiled the EcoSport SUV it plans to bring to the U.S. market in 2018. The model will be built in a factory in India that already makes the vehicle for other countries. \nWrite to Tim Higgins at Tim.Higgins@WSJ.com  161345ET  ",

CEO Mark Fields says the presidential election won't change the company's plans to move small car production to Mexico. \nPresident-elect Donald Trump has repeatedly criticized Ford for moving production to Mexico. Trump wants to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement and has called for a 35-percent tariff on goods shipped from Mexico. \nIn an interview with CNBC Tuesday, Fields said Ford is proceeding with its plan to move Focus car production from Michigan to a new plant in Mexico by 2018. He stressed that no jobs will be lost, since the Michigan plant will make two other vehicles. \nFields also warned that a tariff would affect the entire industry - and autoworkers' profit-sharing checks - since many companies sell Mexican- and Canadian-made vehicles or parts.

      "text": "By Patrick Rall G+ 2016-11-15 11:27 Ford F150 and Super Duty Take a Trio of Honors in LA The aluminum bodied Ford F150 and Super Duty pickups have been awarded with several titles on the first day of the 2016 LA Auto Show, including the 2017 Motor Trend Truck of the Year – setting up Ford as the favorite for the 2017 North American Truck of the Year. \nWhen Ford introduced the 2015 F150 with an all-aluminum body, there were a great many critics of this lightweight skin. Even as F150 sales soured through the 2015 and 2016 model years, critics insisted that the aluminum body is sure to be a problem sooner or later…even though we haven’t seen any issues in the millions of miles logged on the new F150 by owners around the country. \nOf course, with the news that the 2017 Ford Super Duty would also have an aluminum body, those same critics have been vocal about the “dangers of aluminum”, but as has been the case with the 2015-2016 F150 owners, the publications which hand out annual awards aren’t bothered by the alloy body. \nWith the start of the LA Auto Show today, there have been three awards announced for the Ford F Series trucks, with some attention paid to the F150 and the new Super Duty. \nTwo Titles for the F150 First off, we have a couple of awards for the Ford F150. \nThe folks at Kelley Blue Book have named the 2017 F150 their Best Buy of the Year for the truck segment marking the third straight year that the F150 has taken the KBB title. To be clear, the Ford F150 has been the best truck according to KBB every year since it was introduced with the aluminum body. \nAlso, the 2016 Ford F150 was named one of Strategic Vision’s Most Loved Vehicles of the year. Strategic Vision is a research company that introduced their Consumer Love Index, which compiles data from new vehicle owners in more than 120 categories to find which vehicles are the most loved among consumers. Not surprisingly, the bestselling truck in America is also the most loved. \nBig Title for the 2017 Super Duty The Motor Trend Truck of the Year award is one of the most sought after titles among the American automakers and for the 2017 model year, the new Ford Super Duty was named the best by Motor Trend. \n“We judge the contenders based on six categories – from design to efficiency to performance – characterizing the things consumers want most in their next vehicle,” said Ed Loh, Motor Trend editor-in-chief. “The all-new 2017 Ford Super Duty met and exceeded our criteria, truly proving it is the undisputed leader in towing, capability and power – exactly what truck customers want. Motor Trend is excited to crown this purpose-built machine this year’s Truck of the Year.” \nThe 2017 Ford Super Duty is the fifth Ford F-Series model to win the Motor Trend Truck of the Year, and with the Super Duty included in the final three for the North American Truck of the Year – the aluminum-bodied F250, F350 and F450 are poised to claim the top truck title in the USA.",

He stressed that no jobs will be lost, since the Michigan plant will make two other vehicles. \nFields also warned that a tariff would affect the entire industry - and autoworkers' profit-sharing checks - since many companies sell Mexican- and Canadian-made vehicles or parts.   \nThe brightest moon in almost 69 years will be lighting up the sky this week \nThe brightest moon in almost 69 years will be lighting up the sky this week \nFor at least one group -- the blue-collar downtrodden -- Donald Trump's election was a harbinger of hope \nFor at least one group -- the blue-collar downtrodden -- Donald Trump's election was a harbinger of hope Big victories for legal pot, but path ahead is uncertain \nThe number of Americans living in states with recreational marijuana more than tripled after at least three states voted to fully legalize the drug \nThe number of Americans living in states with recreational marijuana more than tripled after at least three states voted to fully legalize the drug Trump victory increases uncertainties for global economy \nThe election of Donald Trump as U.S. president creates new uncertainties for a global economy that's already fragile, say investors and economists \nThe election of Donald Trump as U.S. president creates new uncertainties for a global economy that's already fragile, say investors and economists Tuesday, November 15 2016 3:08 PM EST 2016-11-15 20:08:24 GMT Updated: Tuesday, November 15 2016 3:08 PM EST 2016-11-15 20:08:24 GMT Reruns of \"The Cosby Show\" are returning to television, even as the comedian's sexual assault trial looms next year.

CEO Mark Fields says the presidential election won't change the company's plans to move small car production to Mexico. \nPresident-elect Donald Trump has repeatedly criticized Ford for moving production to Mexico. Trump wants to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement and has called for a 35-percent tariff on goods shipped from Mexico. \nIn an interview with CNBC Tuesday, Fields said Ford is proceeding with its plan to move Focus car production from Michigan to a new plant in Mexico by 2018. He stressed that no jobs will be lost, since the Michigan plant will make two other vehicles. \nFields also warned that a tariff would affect the entire industry - and autoworkers' profit-sharing checks - since many companies sell Mexican- and Canadian-made vehicles or parts.

      "text": "Ford CEO says production plans on track despite election Posted: Updated: \nDETROIT (AP) - Ford Motor Co. CEO Mark Fields says the presidential election won't change the company's plans to move small car production to Mexico. \nPresident-elect Donald Trump has repeatedly criticized Ford for moving production to Mexico. Trump wants to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement and has called for a 35-percent tariff on goods shipped from Mexico. \nIn an interview with CNBC Tuesday, Fields said Ford is proceeding with its plan to move Focus car production from Michigan to a new plant in Mexico by 2018. He stressed that no jobs will be lost, since the Michigan plant will make two other vehicles. \nFields also warned that a tariff would affect the entire industry - and autoworkers' profit-sharing checks - since many companies sell Mexican- and Canadian-made vehicles or parts.

Ford favors “free and fair trade.”\nFields said that the company has been in touch with Trump’s transition team and that he sent a congratulatory letter to the president-elect. The company declined to release the letter.\n“I continue to be convinced that the right policies will prevail, because I think we all share the same objective, which is a healthy and vibrant U.S. economy,” Fields said. “We expect to work very effectively and positively with the president-elect’s administration as well as the new Congress.”\nEngage Positively\nFields said he’s unsure if Trump will carry through on his threats to terminate trade deals like the North American Free Trade Agreement, which lets goods flow between Mexico, the U.S. and Canada without tariffs.\n“We’ll have to see when President-elect Trump gets into office and the policy he advocates,” Fields said in an interview on Bloomberg TV. “We’ll engage positively with the administration, talk about policies that will help provide growth here in the U.S. and do our part. But at the same time, make sure that as a global, successful, multi-national company that we’re building where we’re selling.”\nIf Trump institutes a 35 percent tariff of Mexican-made vehicles “immediately, it will wreak absolute havoc,” Rebecca Lindland, senior analyst for Kelley Blue Book, said in an interview. “If they have time to plan and rearrange production, it will cause slightly less havoc. But either way, it’s going to be very costly for both consumers and businesses.”\nJobs Dispute\nDuring the presidential campaign, Ford pushed back on Trump’s assertions that the company was moving jobs to Mexico. The Wayne, Michigan, factory losing the Focus small car and C-Max hybrid will get new production of a Ranger pickup and revived Bronco sport utility vehicle, people familiar with the plans have said. Ford has said no jobs will be lost at the Michigan plant.\nFord Executive Chairman Bill Ford, great-grandson of the company’s founder, even met with Trump, but the candidate’s criticism of the automaker continued.\n“We are everything that he should be celebrating about this country,” Bill Ford said in September.\nFields said Tuesday at the conference, which is the kickoff to the Los Angeles Auto Show, that company officials have talked to Trump’s transition team and expect to be able to work with him as president.\n“We look forward to working with the new administration and the entire newly elected Congress,” Fields said. “We’re in constant communication.”\nFields would like Trump to take another look at Obama administration fuel economy regulations originally designed to double average new-vehicle fuel-economy to 54.5 miles per gallon by 2025. Achieving that goal has become more difficult as gasoline prices have dropped and consumers have purchased more SUVs and trucks, while turning away from efficient cars and gas-electric hybrid vehicles.\n“We want to make sure that fuel economy regulations are aligned with market realities,” Fields said. Ford wants to make sure rules requiring electric and hybrid vehicles match up with “how consumers are reacting to some of the new technologies.”\nGo to MSN Home",

      "text": "Ford CEO says production plans on track despite election Updated 24 min ago \nDETROIT (AP) — Ford Motor Co. CEO Mark Fields says the presidential election won't change the company's plans to move small car production to Mexico. \nPresident-elect Donald Trump has repeatedly criticized Ford for moving production to Mexico. Trump wants to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement and has called for a 35-percent tariff on goods shipped from Mexico. \nIn an interview with CNBC Tuesday, Fields said Ford is proceeding with its plan to move Focus car production from Michigan to a new plant in Mexico by 2018. He stressed that no jobs will be lost, since the Michigan plant will make two other vehicles. \nFields also warned that a tariff would affect the entire industry — and autoworkers' profit-sharing checks — since many companies sell Mexican- and Canadian-made vehicles or parts.

      "text": "Public Inspection Files Ford CEO says production plans on track despite election \nDETROIT (AP) - Ford Motor Co. CEO Mark Fields says the presidential election won't change the company's plans to move small car production to Mexico. \nPresident-elect Donald Trump has repeatedly criticized Ford for moving production to Mexico. Trump wants to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement and has called for a 35-percent tariff on goods shipped from Mexico. \nIn an interview with CNBC Tuesday, Fields said Ford is proceeding with its plan to move Focus car production from Michigan to a new plant in Mexico by 2018. He stressed that no jobs will be lost, since the Michigan plant will make two other vehicles. \nFields also warned that a tariff would affect the entire industry - and autoworkers' profit-sharing checks - since many companies sell Mexican- and Canadian-made vehicles or parts.

      "text": "Los Angeles (AFP) - Ford Motor Company still plans to relocate some production to Mexico despite the election of Donald Trump, who denounced the move and has threatened to impose hefty tariffs on car imports. \"We look forward to working with the new administration. Our plan is to move our Focus down to Mexico to make room for two very exciting products that will be coming down to the Michigan Center,\" Ford CEO Mark Fields told reporters Tuesday.\nSpeaking at the opening of the Los Angeles auto show, Fields said a 35 percent import duty on cars produced in Mexico, which Trump threatened during the campaign, would hurt the US economy.\n\"A tariff like that would be imposed on the entire auto sector that could have a major impact on the US economy,\" he said.\n\"I continue to think that the right policies will prevail because we continue to share the same objective which is a healthy and vibrant US economy.\"\nAsked by AFP about the consequences of renegotiating or pulling out of free trade agreements such as NAFTA -- something Trump has pledged to do -- Fields said Ford remains \"a big supporter of free and fair trade\" but added, \"we'll see how things play out.\"\nHis remarks echoed those made by BMW chief Harald Krueger in the wake of the real estate tycoon's surprise election last week.\nFields said of Trump, \"We look forward to working with him to consolidate the US economy.\"\nFord will continue to advocate for policies on currency manipulation and fuel standards that are \"in line with market realities,\" as well as tax reform and \"the safe adoption of autonomous cars.\"\nDuring the bitter campaign for the White house, Trump criticized American companies for relocating production abroad. Computer giant Apple has been one of his main targets.\nFord in early April unveiled a $1.6 billion investment in a new facility in Mexico, where the workforce is very cheap compared to the United States. The plant will be operational in 2018.\nCar companies that move US factories offshore have become a frequent target of politicians and local elected officials, not least because General Motors and Chrysler -- although not Ford -- were saved from bankruptcy in 2009 with a government bailout.",

CEO Mark Fields says the presidential election won't change the company's plans to move small car production to Mexico. \nPresident-elect Donald Trump has repeatedly criticized Ford for moving production to Mexico. Trump wants to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement and has called for a 35-percent tariff on goods shipped from Mexico. \nIn an interview with CNBC Tuesday, Fields said Ford is proceeding with its plan to move Focus car production from Michigan to a new plant in Mexico by 2018. He stressed that no jobs will be lost, since the Michigan plant will make two other vehicles. \nFields also warned that a tariff would affect the entire industry — and autoworkers' profit-sharing checks — since many companies sell Mexican- and Canadian-made vehicles or parts. \nCopyright 2016 by The Associated Press.

      "text": "DETROIT (AP) — Ford Motor Co. CEO Mark Fields says the presidential election won't change the company's plans to move small car production to Mexico. President-elect Donald Trump has repeatedly criticized Ford for moving production to Mexico. Trump wants to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement and has called for a 35-percent tariff on goods shipped from Mexico.\nIn an interview with CNBC Tuesday, Fields said Ford is proceeding with its plan to move Focus car production from Michigan to a new plant in Mexico by 2018. He stressed that no jobs will be lost, since the Michigan plant will make two other vehicles.\nFields also warned that a tariff would affect the entire industry — and autoworkers' profit-sharing checks — since many companies sell Mexican- and Canadian-made vehicles or parts.",

      "text": "A part-time suburban firefighter says he gave chase in his Ford F250 pickup after seeing a beige Buick speed through traffic and nearly hit a flower vendor on Chicago's South Side.\nThe 2014 incident ended when the Buick pulled over and off-duty Chicago police Officer John Gorman got out, pulled out a gun and pointed it at the occupants of the truck, testified the firefighter, Charles Ostrowski.\n\"We both yelled, 'Gun!' and ducked down in the truck,\" Ostrowski testified Tuesday as Gorman's trial for felony aggravated discharge of a firearm began.\nOstrowski, then a part-time Melrose Park firefighter, said he immediately yanked the steering wheel to the left and gunned his pickup around Gorman.\nProsecutors said Gorman fired five shots at the passing vehicle just blocks from the Morgan Park police district headquarters. No one was injured, but Ostrowski later found a small bullet hole in his truck's rear bumper.\nPolice found five spent shell casings and Gorman admitted to firing the shots, according to prosecutors and trial testimony. His .38-caliber Luger handgun had one bullet left in its six-round magazine, authorities said.\nIn his opening statement, Gorman's lawyer, Michael Clancy, painted Ostrowski and his friend, Dominic Dimaggio, an off-duty Merrionette Park police officer at the time, as the aggressors, arguing that his client was defending himself as a large truck sped toward him after chasing his Buick through traffic.\nOff-duty Chicago cop charged with recklessly firing gun at suburban cop Steve Schmadeke and Jason Meisner A Cook County judge refused to release a Chicago police officer on his own recognizance Tuesday after he was charged with firing five shots at a suburban cop and his companion while under the influence of alcohol during an off-duty incident last year.\n\"In this climate where citizens are shooting...\nA Cook County judge refused to release a Chicago police officer on his own recognizance Tuesday after he was charged with firing five shots at a suburban cop and his companion while under the influence of alcohol during an off-duty incident last year.\n\"In this climate where citizens are shooting...\n(Steve Schmadeke and Jason Meisner) Ostrowski and Dimaggio saw open containers of beer in Gorman's car while it was stopped in traffic, according to prosecutors and testimony.\nProsecutors previously said Gorman refused to submit to a Breathalyzer. By the time he was compelled to submit to the exam by internal affairs investigators, more than five hours had passed. His blood-alcohol content was still 0.07 percent, just below the legal limit of 0.08 percent.\nBecause so many hours had passed, he was charged with just misdemeanor driving under the influence.\nThe incident began as Ostrowski and Dimaggio drove home after lunch at a Palos Heights bar and a stop at an American Legion Hall in Worth. They were driving east on 111th Street when the Buick passed them and sped through traffic, weaving in and out of lanes, Ostrowski testified.\nAfter seeing the Buick nearly strike the flower vendor after the light turned green at Pulaski Road, the two began following the car as Gorman continued to drive recklessly, Ostrowski testified.\nWhen Gorman stopped near 111th Street and Spaulding Avenue, the suburban cop stepped out of the truck, showed his badge and told Gorman to roll down his window.\nDimaggio said, \"I'm the police. Are you OK? Roll down your window. We need to talk about your driving,\" Ostrowski testified.\nBut on cross-examination by Clancy, Ostrowski admitted telling police that day that his friend had asked, \"Why are you driving like an (expletive)?\"\nOstrowski also acknowledged that the police report did not indicate his friend had identified himself as a suburban cop.\nWhen the left-turn light turned green, Gorman sped around the truck and continued driving east, Ostrowski testified. Dimaggio then called 911.\nAt Prospect and Pryor avenues, Gorman stopped the car and got out. He walked to the rear of his car, displayed a pistol, raised his arm and pointed the gun at the front of the truck, according to testimony.\nDimaggio, who resigned from the Merrionette Park force in 2015, is expected to testify when the bench trial before Judge James Linn is scheduled to resume Dec. 2.\nIf convicted, Gorman, now 54, faces anywhere from probation to 15 years in prison. He has been on paid desk duty at the city's nonemergency call center since his arrest on the misdemeanor charge, Clancy said.\nsschmadeke@chicagotribune.com \nTwitter @SteveSchmadeke \n  Crime",

      "text": "L.A. Auto Show 2016 live updates: The Honda Uni-Cub, commanding cars with Amazon Echo and a 'mobility revolution' Nov. 15, 2016, 1 p.m. \nThe Los Angeles Auto Show opens to the public Friday and ends Nov. 27. Take a look through our coverage from the four days of press previews and keynotes, known as AutoMobility L.A., to see photos and analysis of the latest high-tech offerings. Nov. 15, 2016, 1:40 p.m. Why walk when you can ride? Ford's Carr-E prototype was made for the \"last mile\" of your journey Alene Tchekmedyian \nIt was built to take you – or your luggage – on the “last mile” of your journey: from the train station to your home, or the airport to your office. \nDesigned in Cologne, Germany by engineer Kilian Vas, Ford’s Carr-E was one of 633 designs submitted by employees worldwide to the company’s Global Mobility Challenge, an internal contest for a device to help people handle city life. \nOf the three winning designs, Carr-E is the only fully functional prototype. It’s too early, though, to say if or when the product will hit the market. \nShaped as a tire, the 25-pound, four-wheeled hoverboard-like device will slip right into your spare-tire storage space. One charge will carry 270 pounds up to 14 miles, at up to 11 miles per hour. \n“Normally you’d have to walk this last distance,” Vas said. “With the Carr-E device, you can ride it.” \nFeel like walking, but don’t want to carry your luggage? No problem. \nUsing a wireless sensor device, Carr-E can follow you from up to nine meters away. \n“It will do all the work for you,” Vas said. “If you stop, it will stop. If you go around the corner, it will go around the corner.” \nTo avoid a crash, though, be careful not to make your turns too tight. Latest updates",

      "text": "Ford Unveils 2018 EcoSport Model for LA Auto Show The newest addition to Ford's lineup will serve as the company's smallest SUV. Sheet/Metal \nFord introduced its new EcoSport model shortly prior to the 2016 LA Auto Show. The subcompact SUV is set to be released for the 2018 model year as the smallest SUV in its lineup, even tinier than the Escape. Competitors like the Buick Encore and Honda HR-V have proven the success of this segment in the US, and Ford wants a piece of the miniature cake. \nThe EcoSport is set to come with a variety of options to better suit a broad range of consumers. It will be available with both FWD or AWD, the latter being a front-drive biased system that sends power to the rear when needed. Optional engines include the 2.0L four cylinder that's familiar to the Ford range as well as the highly-praised 1.0L Ecoboost engine, a fantastic little oddball with only three cylinders. Expect trim levels to resemble the current rank of the Escape with the S model being the base, SE following after, then the top of the line Titanium. There will be plenty of tech available to keep its demographic of young college students happy including the new SYNC3 system and available 8\" infotainment screen. \nIt is to be loosely based on the Fiesta platform, albeit a bit bulkier to give it an SUV-worthy stature. The interior is set to be especially spacious for such a small vehicle, allowing for plenty of cargo room and passenger space to haul around whatever your heart desires. This new segment sparks plenty of competition as the compact-SUV class has sold more than 1.7 million units since 2003, creating plenty of reason for Ford to step into the game. \nManufacturing will be performed in India, then it will be imported to the United States sometime in 2018. Expect to see the EcoSport as Ford's driving force towards driving smaller, greener vehicles as it provides all of the capabilities of larger rig while still being economical. This can be seen as part of the Go Small, Live Big initiative that encourages consumers to be eco-friendly while exploring the world.",

      "text": "Bounce Ford CEO says production plans on track despite election \nDETROIT (AP) - Ford Motor Co. CEO Mark Fields says the presidential election won't change the company's plans to move small car production to Mexico. \nPresident-elect Donald Trump has repeatedly criticized Ford for moving production to Mexico. Trump wants to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement and has called for a 35-percent tariff on goods shipped from Mexico. \nIn an interview with CNBC Tuesday, Fields said Ford is proceeding with its plan to move Focus car production from Michigan to a new plant in Mexico by 2018. He stressed that no jobs will be lost, since the Michigan plant will make two other vehicles. \nFields also warned that a tariff would affect the entire industry - and autoworkers' profit-sharing checks - since many companies sell Mexican- and Canadian-made vehicles or parts.

      "text": "LOS ANGELES — Ford Motors CEO Mark Fields said Tuesday that a 35% tariff on cars and trucks imported from Mexico — an idea promoted by President-elect Donald Trump — would have a \"huge impact\" on the entire U.S. economy. Fields, who delivered the keynote speech at the Los Angeles Auto Show on Tuesday morning, spoke about Donald Trump for the first time in public since the businessman was elected to become the next president.\nOn the campaign trail Trump frequently criticized Ford for deciding to move the production of small cars from the U.S. to Mexico, leading to a feud between the candidate and the automaker. Trump also has promised to bring manufacturing jobs back to the U.S. and has talked about imposing a 35% tariff on cars made in Mexico.\n\"A tariff like that would be imposed on the entire auto sector, and that could have a huge impact on the U.S. economy,\" Fields said.\nIn September, Fields appeared on CNN to say no jobs would be lost in the U.S. as it moves production of the Ford Focus and C-Max hybrids to Mexico.\nFacebook Twitter Google+ LinkedIn Stunning cars debut at the Los Angeles Auto Show Fullscreen Post to Facebook Posted!

I’ve sent a congratulatory letter to the president elect, and we look forward to working with a new administration and the entire newly elected Congress,\" Fields said.\nUSA TODAY\nFord will import EcoSport tiny SUV from India\nStill, Fields emphasized that Ford is a global company and believes in free trade. Trump, in contrast, has said he will try to renegotiate NAFTA or pull the U.S. out of the three-nation trade agreement. Trump also oposes the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a 12-nation trade agreement the U.S. signed earlier this year but has not been approved by Congress.\nFord was against the Trans-Pacific Partnership because the automaker said it lacked adequate currency manipulation rules. Fields suggested today that that is one area that the automaker and Trump could work together.\n\"I continue to be convinced that the right polices will prevail, because we all share the same objective, which is a healthy and vibrant U.S. economy,\" Fields said.\nOn Monday, Ford revealed a new EcoSport subcompact SUV that it has sold around the world since 2003 but never in the U.S. Ford plans to import the EcoSport into the U.S. from Chennai, India.\nMore from the Los Angeles Auto Show:\nSkip Ad Ad Loading... x Embed\nx Share\nFord is going to import the EcoSport from India.

CEO Mark Fields says the presidential election won't change the company's plans to move small car production to Mexico. \nPresident-elect Donald Trump has repeatedly criticized Ford for moving production to Mexico. Trump wants to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement and has called for a 35-percent tariff on goods shipped from Mexico. \nIn an interview with CNBC Tuesday, Fields said Ford is proceeding with its plan to move Focus car production from Michigan to a new plant in Mexico by 2018. He stressed that no jobs will be lost, since the Michigan plant will make two other vehicles. \nFields also warned that a tariff would affect the entire industry — and autoworkers' profit-sharing checks — since many companies sell Mexican- and Canadian-made vehicles or parts.

On sale for nearly a decade in other markets around the globe, the EcoSport wears Ford's signature trapezoidal grille and traditional small SUV styling. It looks a lot like a squished Ford Escape. The atypical rear swing gate, hinged on the left, features wraparound blacked-out glass similar to the Buick Encore . The \"sporty\" SES trim will feature unique styling cues to distinguish it from the S, SE and Titanium trim levels. \nMore L.A. Auto Show Coverage \nInside are few features visibly different from a typical Ford's interior. On the Titanium trim, this means an upscale appearance that would rival the Buick Encore. An 8-inch touchscreen with Sync 3 is standard on Titanium models, and lesser trims get either a 4- or 6-inch touchscreen with Sync 3 as an optional feature. Folding and stowable rear seats combine with a false floorboard to create a flat cargo floor when needed, and there are numerous storage compartments, hooks, nooks and cubbies for smaller items. \nCheck out the gallery below. \nBrian Normile handles the scheduling and logistics for press vehicles in Chicago and during our multivehicle challenges. He still drives his first car, a 1997 Toyota 4Runner. Start Shopping",

      "text": "Related Ticker: F The US market is Ford's biggest market by far. An import tax by Trump would seriously upset the applecart. Huge investment in Europe could become unstuck if Ford has to pivot (and invest accordingly) in its largest market. Dividend investors should ignore the perceived strength of the payout ratio as it could change in a heartbeat. Flickr \nThe UAW (United Auto Workers Union) has stated recently that it will work with the president-elect Donald Trump to renegotiate NAFTA. Trump's economic plan put in a nutshell means companies like Ford (NYSE:F) which currently undertake practically all of its manufacturing for its light vehicles in Mexico could be in trouble. Here's My take on Ford under Trump administration. \nTrump has gone on record as stating that NAFTA (North American Free Trade Agreement) was the worst deal signed by an American administration. Such strong words illustrate to me that Trump fully intends to follow through on his words, despite the lobbying that will invariably take place in the auto sector. Trump's objective is clear. Secure the borders. Get as many American companies manufacturing in the states as possible to create jobs which will eventually boost GDP. His tax regime points towards his aim to drastically cut corporation tax to 15% and also permit the repatriation of foreign profits for US multinationals. \nBearish commentary has eluded to a vast increase in the price of goods but essentially I don't see this as a huge problem as long as the dollar remains strong and incomes start growing. Strong economies have done this through the ages. High prices (especially for foreign goods) is not a problem as long as the wages and standards of living is there to keep up. US Auto Sales Have Definitely Topped And So Has Ford's \nI have been pretty vocal about my caution regarding investing in Ford. It's absence of strong competitive advantages plus the cyclical top that we definitely seem to have in the US auto sales now appear to be major headwinds for the Detroit automaker. The SARS or (Seasonally Adjusted Annualized Selling Rate) of 17.98 million was actually higher than I expected in October but Ford's revenues dropped by almost 12% last month. Furthermore, inventory came in pretty high at 90 days illustrating that stock is not moving as quickly as this time last year. \nAlso Read: TSLA Stock: Can Tesla Motors Inc Prosper Under Trump Administration? \nAlthough Ford's latest set of quarterly earnings was poor due to some temporary issues (door latch recalls, Super Duty launch costs, etc), I wouldn't be so certain of a bounce back in sales any time soon. The only bright spot in the October numbers was the span-new aluminum Super Duty and the new Continental sedan (Lincoln), both of which reported gains, but again this was predicted due to the launches. Ford Will Keep Its Mexican Plants But Would Not Expand Their Number As Originally Envisioned \nIf Trump follows through with his campaign promises, then Ford will be stuck in a dilemma regarding its Mexican manufacturing plants. You see, Mexico has more than twice the number of free trade deals than US has. This means that cars can be imported into many more countries with import tariffs waived off from Mexico than US. Obviously , the US market is crucial for Ford but the European market also springs to mind because of its preference towards smaller cars (which are predominantly manufactured in Mexico). In Q3, Ford reported earnings growth in Europe but what few are talking about is that the Brexit fallout is going to hit the company hard over the next few years. European Growth Would Come Under Pressure \nThe company will need cheap cars to supply to this region in the years to come which is why I believe western European existing facilities will have to be shut down (probably moved to Eastern Europe) to control costs. However, if Ford comes under big pressure in the US (either from an import tax or new factories), then European growth is dead in the water in my view as the capital won't be there. Then in Europe Ford wouldn't get the new factories it needs to stay competitive which would result in competitors gaining meaningful market share there. Payout Ratio Could Change Really Quickly \nI would urge investors not to get side tracked by the high dividend here. There are just too many risks to the downside in my opinion despite Trump not taking office until January. Dividend investors usually track the payout ratio only which on the surface looks very attractive at present. On a twelve month trailing basis, net income is $7,247 million and dividends make up $2,398 million which gives us a payout ratio of 33.1%. However, income investors should be looking at the share count also which is basically flat for the past 4 years. The recession risk here is also key as Ford has a track record of slashing its dividend when its sales drop meaningfully. This is the problem that fixed costs bring to the table in this sector.(See Also: Is Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) Stock A Buy Now? ) Summary \nFord's management won't be in any hurry for the president-elect to take office. In fact, Ford's timing couldn't have been more off as only two months ago, it announced that all small car production would be moved to Mexico. Unfortunately, now Ford may find out to its own peril how dependent it is on the US market. Trump from afar doesn't look like he is for turning. \nEvaluating auto stocks?

      "text": "Home » News » India News » Ford to export India-made EcoSport to US Ford to export India-made EcoSport to US 10   IANS New Delhi, Nov 15 : In a boost to Prime Minister Narendra Modis 'Make in India' initiative, automaker Ford has decided to export to the US its Ecosport SUVs manufactured at its plantsin Chennai. Ecosport is one of the most popular subcompact SUVs around the globe. Its new version was unveiled at the Los Angeles Auto Show on Monday. USA Today said the introduction of the SUV at the US auto show came with \"a big surprise\". \"EcoSport is going to be made in India and imported into the US,\" it said, adding the car will be manufactured in Chennai before it goes on sale in 2018. The daily quoted Michael O'Brien, Ford Marketing Manager for SUVs, as saying: \"We build EcoSport in six locations around the globe. We sell it in 100 markets, and so, just like we make Explorers and export from here into other global markets, we are going to export EcoSport from Asia Pacific, and we are going to sell it here in the US.\" The decision to import India-made SUVs came even as Ford has come under attack in recent months from President-elect Donald Trump for moving production of small cars from the US to Mexico. Ford started making EcoSport in India since 2013. The SUV is also assembled in Brazil, Thailand and Russia. The daily said Ford is aiming EcoSport at two main US consumer groups -- \"millennials and empty nesters\". And that is why the automaker chose \"to reveal the EcoSport right off the Hollywood Walk of Fame at an event headlined hip-hop producer and Snapchat king DJ Khaled titled 'Go Small, Live Big'.\" sar/vt",

      "title": "Ford CEO Responds To Donald Trump’s Tariff Pledge",
      "text": "Mark Fields: REUTERS/Lucy Nicholson 5329577 \nPresident-elect Donald Trump focused his attention on the Ford Motor Company throughout his 18-month bid for the White House, and Ford’s CEO has responded. \nFord CEO Mark Fields asserted at the Los Angeles Auto Show in Los Angeles Tuesday that a 35 percent tariff on cars made in Mexico entering the United States “could have a huge impact on the U.S. economy” and would impact the entire auto industry. \nTrump first threatened to impose a 35 percent tariff on all cars and trucks produced by Ford in Mexico in June 2015, the same month he announced his candidacy for the presidency. Trump’s specific focus on Ford could be attributed to the automakers April 2015 announcement of a $2.5 billion expansion of operations in Mexico. \nThe President-elect appealed to working class voters in rust belt states, due to his strong stance on trade. He made Ford a central tenant of his campaign from the get-go, saying at his presidential announcement speech in June 2015 that, “If I was President I’d say [to Ford] Congratulations, I understand that you’re building a nice, $2.5 billion dollar factory in Mexico and that you’re going to take your cars and sell them to the United States.” \n“I’d say ‘Congratulations, that’s the good news. Let me give you the bad news. Every car, and every truck and every part manufactured in this plant that comes across the border, we’re going to charge you a 35% tax. Okay? And that tax is going to be paid simultaneously with the transaction, and that’s it,’” Trump promised during his presidential campaign launch, and then countless times again on the campaign trail. \nNumerous reports indicated that Trump went as far as to tell Ford Motor executives to their faces that he would uphold his tariff plans. \nBill Ford Jr., executive chairman of Ford met with Trump to defend his company against the then-candidate’s bevy of attacks throughout the campaign. \n“He’s a very good listener, and he knows the facts,” Ford Jr. said following the meeting. The great-grandson of Henry Ford pointed out that rhetoric on the campaign trail is a “different animal,” and seemed to accept the fact that Trump would use Ford as an example for the length of the campaign. \nFields said Ford sent Trump a congratulatory letter after the election, and emphasized that the company is a global company committed to free trade. Ford was against the Trans-Pacific Partnership because the agreement lacked “adequate” currency manipulation rules, an area that Trump and the automaker see’s eye to eye. \nMeanwhile, China has threatened to respond to any new tariffs by President-elect Trump with immediate counter measures. (RELATED: China Says It Will Retaliate If Trump Taxes Chinese Goods) \n“A batch of Boeing orders will be replaced by Airbus. US auto and iPhone sales in China will suffer a setback, and US soybean and maize imports will be halted. China can also limit the number of Chinese students studying in the US,” a Chinese communist-controlled paper said. \nSend Tips to [email protected] .

      "title": "Ford Unveils 2018 EcoSport Model for LA Auto Show",
      "text": "Ford introduced its new EcoSport model shortly prior to the 2016 LA Auto Show. The subcompact SUV is set to be released for the 2018 model year as the smallest SUV in its lineup, even tinier than the Escape. Competitors like the Buick Encore and Honda HR-V have proven the success of this segment in the US, and Ford wants a piece of the miniature cake. The EcoSport is set to come with a variety of options to better suit a broad range of consumers. It will be available with both FWD or AWD, the latter being a front-drive biased system that sends power to the rear when needed. Optional engines include the 2.0L four cylinder that's familiar to the Ford range as well as the highly-praised 1.0L Ecoboost engine, a fantastic little oddball with only three cylinders. Expect trim levels to resemble the current rank of the Escape with the S model being the base, SE following after, then the top of the line Titanium. There will be plenty of tech available to keep its demographic of young college students happy including the new SYNC3 system and available 8\" infotainment screen.\nIt is to be loosely based on the Fiesta platform, albeit a bit bulkier to give it an SUV-worthy stature. The interior is set to be especially spacious for such a small vehicle, allowing for plenty of cargo room and passenger space to haul around whatever your heart desires. This new segment sparks plenty of competition as the compact-SUV class has sold more than 1.7 million units since 2003, creating plenty of reason for Ford to step into the game.\nManufacturing will be performed in India, then it will be imported to the United States sometime in 2018. Expect to see the EcoSport as Ford's driving force towards driving smaller, greener vehicles as it provides all of the capabilities of larger rig while still being economical. This can be seen as part of the Go Small, Live Big initiative that encourages consumers to be eco-friendly while exploring the world.",

      "title": "2018 Ford EcoSport: Ford Finally Gets in the Wee-SUV Game",
      "text": "Ford was one of the early contenders in the compact-crossover segment, beating most of its competitors to market when it launched the Escape back in 2000 as a 2001 model. The company has been absent from the subcompact-crossover game in America, however, an oversight felt more keenly by the day as tiny utes surge in popularity. Fortunately for Ford, it already had such a vehicle in its global quiver in the form of the EcoSport, which has been on sale elsewhere for some time and is being freshened inside and out for 2018. Underscoring its importance to the American lineup, Ford chose a U.S. city, Los Angeles, as the site of the revised model’s official global debut. Built on Ford’s B-segment (think Fiesta) platform, the EcoSport looks like a pre-adolescent version of the Escape. Final dimensions have not been released, but for reference, the pre-facelifted version of the EcoSport was 157.4 inches from stem to stern, was 69.5 inches wide and 67.2 inches tall, and rode on a 99.2-inch wheelbase, making it roughly the size of a Nissan Juke; we don’t expect those numbers to change much for the updated version. The U.S. model would be longer if Ford included the external rear-mounted spare tire found on EcoSports in other markets, but we will get the same side-hinged tailgate. Small and whimsical though it may be, the EcoSport fills a huge hole that opened up as other automakers started introducing littler CUVs.\nView photos\nSince the EcoSport has never been sold here, most of us won’t know (nor likely care) what features have been modified or changed as part of the EcoSport’s mid-cycle update. But for those who do, the updated features include the headlamps, the front and rear fascias, the taillamps, and a larger, higher-set grille. Four trim levels will be offered at launch: S, SE, SES, and Titanium, the last getting its own exterior styling cues, as well as copper accents on the dash, door panels, and seats.\nInside, the EcoSport’s new dashboard is home to an 8.0-inch touchscreen infotainment system powered by Ford’s Sync 3 software. Ford also is touting the gadget-friendliness of the EcoSport—it gets two fast-charging USB ports and one 12-volt outlet up front, plus another 12-volt outlet and an optional 110-volt plug in the rear seating area. Ford has somehow managed to create 30 storage pockets of varying sizes throughout the cabin, and Titanium models boast a 675-watt B&O Play audio system with 10 speakers.\nView photos\nThe EcoSport will be offered with two powertrains: a 1.0-liter turbocharged EcoBoost three-cylinder engine paired with front-wheel drive and a naturally aspirated 2.0-liter four-cylinder with all-wheel drive. Both powertrains feature a six-speed automatic transmission. Neither engine has been mated to this transmission before, so Ford isn’t ready to announce final output figures until closer to launch, but you can likely expect somewhere around 120 horsepower and 125 lb-ft of torque for the 1.0-liter model and 140 horses and 140 lb-ft for 2.0-liter versions. However distant the possibility, we would love to see Ford whip up an EcoSport ST at some point given how awesome the Fiesta ST has proved to be. Just a suggestion.\nThe 2018 EcoSport goes on sale in the U.S. in early 2018.\nView photos",

      "text": "LOS ANGELES — Ford Motor Co. Chief Executive Mark Fields issued a warning about President-elect Donald Trump’s proposed trade policies, saying high tariffs on automobiles and other products coming into the U.S. would be a blow to the auto industry and broader U.S. economy.\nFields, speaking with reporters on the sidelines of the Los Angeles Auto Show on Tuesday, said Ford F, -0.17% has talked to Trump’s transition team and believes the company can work with the new administration. During a separate interview, he said, “We all share the same objective; we want a vibrant and healthy U.S. economy.”\nThe two sides, however, appear to be at odds on how to achieve that goal.\nFord’s plan to move a substantial portion of its passenger-car production to Mexico from a factory in Michigan was heavily criticized by Trump on the campaign trail. Like many of its rivals, Ford is building more-profitable light trucks in the U.S. while investing in new capacity in Mexico to produce lower-margin small cars.\nAn expanded version of this report appears on WSJ.com.\nAlso popular on WSJ.com:\nIntelligence expert Mike Rogers leaves Trump transition team after shake-up.\nHow to reconcile with family and friends after the election.\nMore from MarketWatch Donald Trump's Possible Cabinet Picks Trump, as Outsider, Broke Every Rule on Road to Victory What President-elect Trump means for every U.S. industry",

      "text": "Trump Win Prompts Ford to Move Manufacturing from Mexico to Ohio Ford Fiesta Ford did not move manufacturing to Ohio from Mexico because Donald Trump was elected president in November 2016. - - \nClaim: After Donald Trump won the 2016 election, Ford decided to move production of their vehicles from Mexico to Ohio. mostly false \nWHAT'S TRUE: CNNMoney reported that Ford had moved some manufacturing operations from Mexico to Avon Lake, Ohio, in August 2015. \nWHAT'S FALSE: Ford's move antedated the election of Donald Trump by a full 15 months, and the two circumstances were entirely unrelated. A Ford spokesman affirmed the decision to move operations to Ohio occurred in 2011. \nOrigin: On 14 November 2016, the web site Viral Liberty was among blogs claiming that the election of Donald Trump as President on 8 November 2016 had prompted the Ford Motor Company to move manufacturing operations from Mexico to Ohio: \nTRUMP WINS THE PRESIDENCY & FORD Shifts TRUCK PRODUCTION FROM MEXICO TO OHIO! \nFord’s heavy duty pickup trucks which used to be built in Mexico started rolling off an assembly line in Ohio this week. That’s good news for the 1,000 Ford workers in Ohio, who might have otherwise been out of work. \nIt’s also good publicity for Ford (F), which has been under fire for investing so much in Mexico. In April, the automaker said it would invest $2.5 billion in transmission plants in the Mexican states of Chihuahua and Guanajuato, creating about 3,800 jobs there. \nThe item cited a near-identical article that had also appeared on social media on 14 November 2016: \nSince Donald Trump Won The Presidency ... Ford Shifts Truck Production From Mexico To Ohio \nFord’s south-of-the-border strategy has drawn heavy criticism from groups such as the United Auto Workers union and Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump. \nThe Avon Lake, Ohio, plant produced its first batch of Ford’s full-size F-650 and F-750 pick up trucks on [9 November 2016]. \nThat version included no links to substantiate the claim, but a quote revealed that the article had beenlifted verbatim from a CNNMoney article published well over a year earlier, on 13 August 2015: \nFord's heavy duty pickup trucks which used to be built in Mexico started rolling off an assembly line in Ohio [in August 2015]. \nThat's good news for the 1,000 Ford workers in Ohio, who might have otherwise been out of work. \nIt's also good publicity for Ford (F), which has been under fire for investing so much in Mexico. In April, the automaker said it would invest $2.5 billion in transmission plants in the Mexican states of Chihuahua and Guanajuato, creating about 3,800 jobs there. \nFord's south-of-the-border strategy has drawn heavy criticism from groups such as the United Auto Workers union and Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump. \nThe Avon Lake, Ohio, plant produced its first batch of Ford's full-size F-650 and F-750 pick up trucks on [12 August 2015]. \n\"Our investment...reinforces our commitment to building vehicles in America,\" said Joe Hinrichs, Ford president, The Americas. \"Working with our partners in the UAW, we found a way to make the costs competitive enough to bring production of a whole new generation of work trucks to Ohio.\" \nAlthough it was true Ford moved some of their manufacturing operations from Mexico to Avon Lake, Ohio, that change occurred in August 2015 and had nothing to do with the 8 November 2016 election of Donald Trump. Trump did not win the Republican nomination until July 2016, nearly one year after CNNMoney reported Ford's investment in their Avon Lake facility. An October 2015 article by the same outlet and writer reported that Ford had decided on the Ohio move back in 2011.   15 November 2016 sources: \nIsidore, Chris. \"Ford Shifts Truck Production from Mexico to Ohio.\" CNNMoney . 17 August 2015. \nIsidore, Chris and Noah Gray. \"Donald Trump Is Wrong About Ford and Mexico.\" CNNMoney . 26 October 2015.",

      "text": "Ford unveils new SUV on Snapchat by @peterdrives November 15, 2016: 5:33 PM ET Ford targets young drivers with EcoSport With help from Snapchat sensation DJ Khaled, Ford Motor Co. unveiled its new subcompact SUV, the EcoSport. \nIt's the first time a major automaker has used Snapchat to unveil a new car. It's not the first time Ford ( F ) has used social media to unveil a new vehicle, though. In 2010, Ford used Facebook to unveil its new Explorer SUV. \nThe unveiling took place within a special compound Ford created just off Hollywood Boulevard in Hollywood, California, before the start of the Los Angeles Auto Show. \nA large parking lot was sectioned off with areas that included, among other things, a faux beach, a wooden bungalow and a zoo filled with cute animals. \nDJ Khaled is a disc jockey and rap music performer, but is best known for his appearances on Snapchat, a social media platform built around photos and video. He is known for his unceasingly positive messages, sort of like a hip hop motivational speaker. The Ford EcoSport will be available in the U.S. for the first time beginning in 2018. \nThe EcoSport is a small SUV model that has been available in countries outside the U.S. since 2003. Subcompact SUVs have become a huge business in the U.S. where small SUVs are already the largest segment of the automotive market, according to data from Kelley Blue Book. Other automakers already sell models such as the Chevrolet ( GM ) Trax, Honda ( HMC ) HR-V and Jeep ( FCAM ) Renegade. \nWith its latest redesign, Ford is making the EcoSport available to U.S. customers. The automaker also decided to unveil the new version in the U.S. \nThe new EcoSport's base engine is a turbocharged 1.0-liter three-cylinder horsepower engine that's also used in Ford's small cars. A 2.0-liter engine will also be available. \nThe EcoSport's tailgate swings out to the side rather than up. Ford says it provides easier access to the cargo area. \nFord has not yet announced pricing for the EcoSport. It's expected to go on sale early in early 2018.

      "text": "Jason Torchia Built a Stunning 1999 Ford F-150, and it’s not Staying Stock! Promises Made   12 Photos Some truck projects start out with a definite course of action, having a clear plan as to how the build is going to go. Whether taking the form of a full teardown and transformation into a show truck, a mild build with some tasteful parts added to enhance to overall look, or just some wheels and tires with a kickass exhaust. Some even start out with the promise to a loved one of “I’m going to keep this one stock.” But as we all know here at Truckin , promises like that don’t last for long. When Jason Torchia’s parents bought this 1999 Ford F-150 new, they drove it for a few years before giving it to their son, with the agreement he would leave it stock. He had customized almost every other vehicle he had in his possession, so that promise did not last long. And as the truck lay completely disassembled, ready for its first build, all Torchia’s father could do was roll his eyes at the dismantled truck that had been a solid runner not too long before.   12 Photos Photo 2/12 | 1999 Ford F 150 Driving In its first incarnation, this ’99 was black and red, bodydropped, and used as a daily. It stayed that way for a while till a small repair led to a total redesign. While cruising around a little too low, the roll pan caught on a chunk of asphalt and was ripped off. As he sat and began the process of repairing it, Torchia began to repair other small areas that were a little road weary and one thing led to another. A few dings in rear frame led to a completely custom 2-by-4-inch box section frame, and the idea that he need to redo the paint. To get the Ford to lay this low, he installed a set of modified DJM upper and lower arms and a quartet of Slam Specialties ’bags on all four corners. But some really impressive work went into the cantilever setup in the bed. “I was playing around with a rear design and saw that cantilevers offered a whole lot of height adjustment,” Torchia says. “Not only that, they look frickin’ cool!” A set was hand drawn by Torchia and sent to the plasma table, while he fabricated a custom sheet metal bed.",

CEO Mark Fields says the presidential election won't change the company's plans to move small car production to Mexico. \nPresident-elect Donald Trump has repeatedly criticized Ford for moving production to Mexico. Trump wants to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement and has called for a 35-percent tariff on goods shipped from Mexico. \nIn an interview with CNBC Tuesday, Fields said Ford is proceeding with its plan to move Focus car production from Michigan to a new plant in Mexico by 2018. He stressed that no jobs will be lost, since the Michigan plant will make two other vehicles. \nFields also warned that a tariff would affect the entire industry - and autoworkers' profit-sharing checks - since many companies sell Mexican- and Canadian-made vehicles or parts.

      "text": "Yahoo / Fox / NASCAR: Quick Picks \nThe 2016 Sprint Cup Series season comes to a close this weekend at Homestead-Miami Speedway, and while four drivers will battle for a championship in Sunday's Ford EcoBoost 400, fantasy owners will have one last chance to claim a title of their own. \nIn many ways, the final race of the season is easy when it comes to the Yahoo game. After all, you don't have to worry about saving starts anymore, so go ahead and stack your lineup with the top options from each tier if you have them at your disposal. \nOf course, you may need to take a different approach depending on how on how you have used your starts up to this point and your current position in the standings. \nIf you are already on top, play it as safe as possible, focusing on drivers who tend to stay out of trouble and finish in the top half of the field, even if they have an off race. \nIf you need to gain some ground in your league, this is the week to go with a Hail Mary lineup of high-risk, high-reward sleepers. The worst that can happen is that you fall further back from the teams that were already beating you to begin with. Meanwhile, there is a small chance that your lineup hits and you are able to make a jump up the standings in the final week. \nYou won't have to set another fantasy NASCAR lineup until next February at Daytona. Do what you need to do to secure a title if you're on top, and don't be afraid to roll the dice if you have nothing to lose. 1. JIMMIE JOHNSON , #48 LOWE'S/KOBALT TOOLS, HENDRICK MOTORSPORTS [YAHOO CLASS A] \nWhile it's true that Johnson has never really had a breakout performance at Homestead, he does have seven top 10s in his last 10 starts here, including three straight. He also goes into the race knowing he likely needs to win, and not just have a solid run, to secure the championship. The No. 48 team has had the most time among the title contenders to prepare for this race after winning Martinsville, so Johnson should be tough to handle this weekend. 2. KYLE BUSCH , #18 MARS BRANDS/INTERSTATE BATTERIES, JOE GIBBS RACING [YAHOO CLASS A] \nHis overall record at Homestead isn't great, but Busch won the race and the championship at the track last season. He also has three finishes of seventh or better in his last four starts here, leading a combined 232 laps in that span. Busch will be defending his title this weekend, so expect another big performance. 3. KEVIN HARVICK , #4 BUSCH BEER/JIMMY JOHNS, STEWART-HAAS RACING [YAHOO CLASS A] \nHarvick won't be competing for the title this year, but that doesn't disqualify him from winning this weekend. He has a series-leading eight straight top 10s at Homestead, and he has five finishes of third or better in that stretch. Harvick won here in 2015 and was the runner-up in last year's race. 4. JOEY LOGANO , #22 SHELL-PENNZOIL, TEAM PENSKE [YAHOO CLASS A] \nHomestead doesn't rank as his best track, but Logano finished a career-best fourth here last year and is hitting his stride at the 1.5-mile tracks at the right time. He has three top three finishes in the last four races at 1.5-mile ovals, and I would be shocked if he isn't a serious contender for the win and the championship Sunday. 5. CARL EDWARDS , #19 ARRIS/STANLEY, JOE GIBBS RACING [YAHOO CLASS B] \nHe has been good, not great, at Homestead the last few years, but from 2008 to 2011, Edwards posted two wins and a runner-up finish in a four-race span at the track. Competing for the title Sunday, I expect him to come up with a strong effort. Use him as a B-List play if you have a start left.",

      "text": "Back to Top Post by Christina on Mar 29, 2016 23:29:04 GMT I've bought the replacement for the Cavalier, gone for a newer model! I've bought it but it's still in Scotland so I'll have to make do with the pictures I've got of the car so far, but I'm too excited to wait for it to turn up before making the thread!So yes! It's a Taunus, imported from sweden in 05, so has a few cool goodies like the headlight washer overriders and an overwhelming urge to put on an abba tape. Originally a 2.0 V6 but now 2.3, with Power steering, so it's about as good as you could get if buying a Taunus in 82. It needs a small amount of welding, probably back ends of sill area or A post/jacking point bits. But nothing I've not already done with my Mk3 Cortina. Being LHD would probably put a few people off but the biggest inconvenience I can think of is the maccies drive through would be a little tricky.And some pics I found on flickrPlans are basically to get it MOTd and use it. Same plans as with the Cav, but I couldn't let this opportunity slip by. I'm definitely a cortina girl through and through. Never had a V6 so that'll be fun, I'll pretty it up à la muscle car V8Can't wait to get it back and play with it dazcapri and pistonpopper like this Last Edit: Sept 3, 2016 2:26:09 GMT by Christina",

This F100 is sold with a clean Colorado title in the seller’s name. \nThis F-series shows good panel gaps from front to rear, and while the finish looks nice in photos the seller notes that the truck could benefit from a fresh paint job. The 1965 and ’66 had unique fender badges that advertised their unique Twin I-Beam front suspension. The truck has several minor exterior modifications, including Torq Thrust wheels and aftermarket bumpers. \nA dent is present under the letter “F” on the tailgate, but the bodywork appears quite straight otherwise. The inside of the bed is protected with spray-in bedliner and is similarly free of notable dents. \nThe dash top and seat upholstery have both been redone, and the well-chosen materials present a period-correct look. The original instruments have been augmented by aftermarket voltage and oil temperature gauges fitted in the stock instrument binnacle fascia. \nThis truck is fitted with Ford’s long-lived 300 cubic inch straight-six backed by a 4-speed floor-shift manual gearbox. This engine debuted in 1965 would endure until 1996 in F-Series trucks. Service records are available back to the original owner and recent work includes the following: New Cooper tires New shocks and drum brakes all around All new wheel bearings New brake fluid, motor oil, and gear oil in the transmission and differential New valve cover gasket New pushrod inspection cover gasket New carburetor New muffler New battery and cables \nThis truck features Ford’s Twin I-Beam independent front suspension and shows minimal corrosion on its underside. The seller notes that the rear leaf springs and shackle bushings should be replaced sometime soon as they are original. Photo Gallery",

      "text": "2015 Ford F150 - One Phat F150 Making a Milestone With the World's First Body Dropped 2015 Ford F150 Jon Hansen – View Photo Gallery | 15 Photos One thing most automotive builders and enthusiasts alike can relate to is purchasing a new vehicle, and telling yourself, “I'm not going to mod this one.” Jeremy Brown of Texas City, Texas, had planned to buy and use his fully loaded 2015 Ford Lariat Super Crew pickup only to tow his bodied ’89 Tacoma. It is hard to say at what point his original mindset changed, but it may have begun with the simplicity of the Phat Phabz hidden trailer hitch behind his rear license plate. Sometimes, it only takes a small spark to start a fire. Once Brown decided that is was going to be no ordinary tow rig, he dove head first into the build. The goal was to break new ground in the world of F150s, as well as cut no corners along the way. Immediately, the truck went out to the Phat Phabz crew in Oklahoma, a shop where so many other amazing builds have come out these days. From there, the real work began. Knowing that a bodydrop was in order, the crew began building the custom frame and suspension setup for the barely off the lot Lariat. As progress started showing on the 4-inch bodydrop, they added 2,600 airbags in front and Firestone 9,000 ’bags in the rear, as well as custom spindles and control arms to this monumental build. As if that was not enough work, they moved the motor a total of more than 3 inches for clearance purposes and narrowed the rear end. As the suspension and bodywork to adapt to the bodydrop began getting wrapped up, it was time to decide what wheels this big-bodied Ford would lay out on. Brown had no hesitation picking the staggered 26x9 inch and 26x10 inch Intro Dangerous wheels. Just for fun, Brown even switched to a 5x5.5 conversion. That is one of the many small touches added throughout the build that would take a second, or even third, trip walking around the vehicle to notice. Once the fully custom bed by Phat Phabz was dropped onto the final setup, the F150 was ready to roll. Time for paint. After shaving the emblems and stock gas door, the Lariat was ready for Patrick Reid in San Leon, Texas, to work his magic. Keeping the stock white base color, Reid added black flames with a touch of blue across the truck’s front end and running back toward the rear. To add to the list of great little touches, he even carried the flames onto the inside of the hood. It’s just another example of the detail this build contains. After throwing in a custom Rockford Fosgate stereo setup to make those drives even more enjoyable, and much louder, the F150 was road and show ready, as you see it now. Lucky drivers might see Brown towing his bodied Toyota behind him, skating down the highway to a show near you.

      "text": "Ford CEO Warns Of Impact From Trump's Proposed Tariff  40:  \n(RTTNews.com) - Mark Fields, the Chief Executive officer of Ford Motor Co.( F ), issued a warning about President-elect Donald Trump's proposed trade policies, saying high tariffs on automobiles and other products coming into the U.S. would be a blow to the auto industry and broader U.S. economy. \nMr. Fields said Ford has talked to Mr. Trump's transition team and believes the company can work with the new administration. \nFord's plan to move a substantial portion of its passenger-car production to Mexico from a factory in Michigan was heavily criticized by Trump on the campaign trail.

Ford favors “free and fair trade.”\nFields said that the company has been in touch with Trump’s transition team and that he sent a congratulatory letter to the president-elect. The company declined to release the letter.\n“I continue to be convinced that the right policies will prevail, because I think we all share the same objective, which is a healthy and vibrant U.S. economy,” Fields said. “We expect to work very effectively and positively with the president-elect’s administration as well as the new Congress.”\nEngage Positively\nFields said he’s unsure if Trump will carry through on his threats to terminate trade deals like the North American Free Trade Agreement, which lets goods flow between Mexico, the U.S. and Canada without tariffs.\n“We’ll have to see when President-elect Trump gets into office and the policy he advocates,” Fields said in an interview on Bloomberg TV. “We’ll engage positively with the administration, talk about policies that will help provide growth here in the U.S. and do our part. But at the same time, make sure that as a global, successful, multi-national company that we’re building where we’re selling.”\nIf Trump institutes a 35 percent tariff of Mexican-made vehicles “immediately, it will wreak absolute havoc,” Rebecca Lindland, senior analyst for Kelley Blue Book, said in an interview. “If they have time to plan and rearrange production, it will cause slightly less havoc. But either way, it’s going to be very costly for both consumers and businesses.”\nJobs Dispute\nDuring the presidential campaign, Ford pushed back on Trump’s assertions that the company was moving jobs to Mexico. The Wayne, Michigan, factory losing the Focus small car and C-Max hybrid will get new production of a Ranger pickup and revived Bronco sport utility vehicle, people familiar with the plans have said. Ford has said no jobs will be lost at the Michigan plant.\nFord Executive Chairman Bill Ford, great-grandson of the company’s founder, even met with Trump, but the candidate’s criticism of the automaker continued.\n“We are everything that he should be celebrating about this country,” Bill Ford said in September.\nFields said Tuesday at the conference, which is the kickoff to the Los Angeles Auto Show, that company officials have talked to Trump’s transition team and expect to be able to work with him as president.\n“We look forward to working with the new administration and the entire newly elected Congress,” Fields said. “We’re in constant communication.”\nFields would like Trump to take another look at Obama administration fuel economy regulations originally designed to double average new-vehicle fuel-economy to 54.5 miles per gallon by 2025. Achieving that goal has become more difficult as gasoline prices have dropped and consumers have purchased more SUVs and trucks, while turning away from efficient cars and gas-electric hybrid vehicles.\n“We want to make sure that fuel economy regulations are aligned with market realities,” Fields said. Ford wants to make sure rules requiring electric and hybrid vehicles match up with “how consumers are reacting to some of the new technologies.”\nGo to MSN Home",

      "text": "Ford is Marketing with Sailor Moon as Part of Its 'Overdubs' Series By: Joey Haar - Nov 15, 2016 References: youtube & digitaltrends Ford's new 'Overdubs' series of ads is targeted squarely at millennials. The ad series features anime characters that were standard entertainment for that generation, plying on millennials sense of nostalgia in order to get them interested in Ford vehicles. As millennials begin settling into employment and earning enough to make larger purchases -- like cars -- companies are finding increasingly interesting ways to market to them. The Overdubs series is an example of that, with Ford tapping into the incredibly strong feelings that young people have for the cartoons of their childhoods. The Overdubs series specifically advertises the Ford Focus, an entry level vehicle that would best suit people looking for their first car. The latest ad is a Sailor Moon spoof, and others include Dragon Ball Z and Metal Gear Solid.",

      "text": "Ford small cars production moving out of US to Mexico Published time: 16 Nov, 2016 02:18 Get short URL Mark Fields, President & CEO, Ford Motor Company, speaks at the Los Angeles Auto Show in Los Angeles, California, U.S. November 15, 2016. © Lucy Nicholson / Reuters Ford’s small cars are about to become a product of Mexico following the announcement that production will shift out of the US. However, the carmaker maintains that “two very important products” will continue to be produced in US factories. \nFord Motors CEO Mark Fields announced that they would be moving forward on relocating small car production to Mexico, despite President-elect Donald Trump’s promises to impose tariffs on vehicles made outside of the US. \n\" We’re going forward with our plan to move production of the Ford Focus to Mexico, and importantly that’s to make room for two very important products we’ll be putting back into Michigan plants ,\" Fields told Reuters. General Motors to lay off 2,000 workers in Ohio and Michigan https://t.co/7Z1SybVSck pic.twitter.com/hG0PiDvRcw — RT America (@RT_America) November 10, 2016 \nFields did not elaborate on what the “ two very important products ” would be. However, he insisted “ there will be no job impact whatsoever with this move. ” He blamed the need to move production on low gasoline prices, which may coax some consumers into buying larger cars that use more fuel. \nAs a result, \" it's very difficult for us to be able to make money on a vehicle produced in the US \" in the small car segment, he said. How that will stand up to Trump’s promises to place a 35 percent tariff on cars and trucks imported from Mexico remains to be seen, but Fields has made pleas to Trump to reconsider the plan. \n\" A tariff like that would be imposed on the entire auto sector, and that could have a huge impact on the US economy, \" Fields told USA Today. \nFields acknowledged that he had spoken with Trump’s transition team and had congratulated the president-elect, but also hopes to work with him to undo climate-friendly regulations on cars. For example, a group representing Ford allegedly asked the transition team to review regulations over fuel economy standards, Reuters reported.",
