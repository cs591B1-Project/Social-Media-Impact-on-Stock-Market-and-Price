      "text": "Tweet \nPharmacies are extremely important to many people. Many people rely on pharmacies to be open 24 hours a day so that they are able to get their medications and purchase other items they may need to maintain their health. Of the major pharmacies in the United States, CVS is a favorite of many. However, whether or not the pharmacy is open 24 hours or whether they are open on holidays may affect your decision on whether or not you’ll go to CVS. So, what are the CVS holiday hours? Is CVS Pharmacy Open 24 Hours? \nSome CVS locations are open 24 hours while other may close at 10 p.m. Most metropolitan areas have a 24 hours pharmacy somewhere nearby though. In fact, most CVS locations that are closest to the hospital remain open 24 hours a day. This is because if they are near a hospital many people will be leaving at all hours of the day with prescriptions that will need to be filled. While not all CVS locations are open 24 hours a day, they are open every day of the year. Some days, however, may have altered hours of operation. Let’s take a look at the pharmacy’s holiday schedule: CVS Holiday Hours and Schedule \nAs stated above, CVS is open every single day of the year. This is because no matter what day it is people need to be able to have access to their prescriptions and other services offered by CVS. The pharmacy is open all of the following holidays: New Year’s Day Martin Luther King, Jr. Day (MLK Day) Valentine’s Day",

      "title": "CVS Is Set For Further Decline",
      "text": "Summary \nThis retail pharmacy and pharmaceutical benefits management company delivered fantastic results for over 5 years. \nHistory is not set to repeat for CVS as competitive pressures have wrested a major contract with the Department of Defense from them. \nI attempt to quantify the significance of the recent losses of future business and the results aren't pretty for CVS longs. Premium Contributer Ian Bezek of Ian's Inside Corner and I were discussing the relative investability of the big two pharmacy chains in the U.S.A. Here I'm sharing with you why I believe CVS is facing a declining earnings picture, while Ian Bezek covers Walgreens-Boots Alliance (NASDAQ: WBA ) in his own recent article under ticker WBA here at SeekingAlpha. CVS vs WBA Two drugstore retail giants have been slugging it out in the marketplace. This article discusses the impact CVS's (NYSE: CVS ) loss of their contracts to serve over 9.6 million covered persons may have on the company's earnings. The major contract with the Department of Defense discussed will have its fruits delivered to competitor Walgreens. The Cash Earnings Legacy Allow me to set the stage. CVS has grown their free cash flow like gangbusters during the last 10-year period. Click to enlarge The $3B bump to free cash flow over the trailing twelve months is reminiscent of the bumper harvest the company enjoyed in the 2010-2012 period. The recent increase in free cash flow was driven by increases in operating cash flows while recent capital expenditures on things like store opening and maintenance remain at levels similar to prior periods. To be fair, only those with access to the internal books of the company are able to trace exactly where this sudden expansion to cash earnings arose from. The company's performance on major contracts hasn't changed much during the trailing five year period, so there's no easy place to point. The mid-2015 acquisition of Omnicare, a specialty purveyor of high-ticket price multiple sclerosis and other rare disease drugs is one welcome cash cow. The year-end of 2015 purchase of 1,626 store-within-a-store Target pharmacies were another plus to recent cash incomes. The acquisition of Omnicare, which specializes in selling specialty drugs going for $20,000 and $50,000 per month prescriptions, likely gave a big bump to CVS' cash earnings for the recent periods as Omnicare became integrated in CVS' network of over 9,000 pharmacies and the networks they're members of. Free Cash Flow at CVS Will Certainly Go Down From Here The problem facing CVS is the damage to cashflow resulting from the loss of CalPER's $575M per year contract covering its 346,000 members. I'm going to use the contract numbers available to penalize CVS' future free cash flow. This will give us a window into their future ability to create cash for their investors. We don't know the margins on the CalPERs contract, and its certainly not a 100% profit margin, but let's say CVS is making a free cash flow benefit of 30% of the contract price. Then $172.5M in free cash was flowing to the bottom line after product and delivery costs on this $575M per-year contract. So under these margin assumptions, with the loss of the CalPERs contract the CVS' annual free cash flow will decrease from $9.035B to $8.862B. A little ding to owner's earnings. Loss of Contract With Department of Defense Reported just recently, the company lost a contract serving the 9.4 million person prescription base of the Department of Defense. The company served this contract through Caremark, who the DoD had contracted with prior to CVS' acquisition in 2005. That's a contract 27 times bigger than the CalPERS loss. I don't have the dollar value of the DoD contract in front of me and have been unable to track them down. However, if the per-covered person free cash flow yield for the Department of Defense contract is similar to the company's other large contracts, such as CalPERS, we're looking at a loss to free cash flow of $4.657B per annum. Taking into account this stunning loss I'm projecting less than $4.250B free cash flow generation at CVS for next year's operations. The company's ability to generate earnings for investors has taken a major hit. Valuation of CVS Common Stock Based On Projected Free Cash Flow The \"Nothing Changed Valuation\" So what's CVS' fair value going forward based on the average of its trailing five year's free cash flow of $5.4B per annum? Click to enlarge At a fair value of $58.91 per share on a cash-basis, the large retail footprint and economies of scale make some sense of the $15.70 premium implied by today's price of $74.61. If things were going to continue as they have over the recent years, there would be no cause for alarm. The \"Lost Critical Contracts Valuation\" (reality) We all know the trailing five years' earnings are not going to be repeated. Losing contracts to serve over 9.6 million insured customers is huge. In fact, we can trace CVS big successes since 2005 as being largely the result of their acquisition of Caremark and the improved relationship with the Department of Defense. Take another look at CVS record of free cashflow generation. The red circle designates when CVS acquired Caremark's relationship with the Department of Defense. The company had 5,375 pharmacy locations on January 1st, 2015. Click to enlarge Source: Faloh Investment Clearly the company, running over 5,000 pharmacies, was having success to the tune of $800 million in free cash flow generated per annum for many years running. But it was with the acquisition of Caremark and the PBM business that CVS became a cash cow. Now with many fewer prescriptions to fill, things are set to change. Certainly the PBM business is under threat as Express Scripts (NASDAQ: ESRX ) and Walgreens have the DoD business now! As a result, CVS is losing tons of regular foot traffic and the contract income we've already discussed. Here's the discounted cash flow valuation result at the post-contract loss projected free cash flows of $4.250B for next year: Click to enlarge At the estimated $46.36 per share fair value, this looks bad for investors on the longside, but hey, maybe CVS can win the next contract with the Department of Defense in five years. There are a few factors keeping CVS afloat, and even at its lowest point, expect the company to trade at a premium to this projected estimate of fair value. The premium will reflect CVS' large retail footprint, and their investments in specialty supply channels such as the recent Omnicare acquisition are valuable in their own right. Takeaway I believe CVS will suffer in dramatic fashion as a result of the loss of business with the Department of Defense. Billions of dollars in cash flow which previously availed them on contract, and the foot traffic of as many as 9.4 million covered people are being moved into Walgreens stores. These effects won't hit reported results until the earnings report issued in at the conclusion of 2017's first quarter, but savvy investors are taking the appropriate action according to this expected loss of business. The stock's trading price has already crashed well over 20% from recent all-time highs. In my opinion CVS is a strong sell , and Walgreens is likely to perform in a superior fashion over the next three to five years. Check out Bezek's recent article on Walgreens here .
