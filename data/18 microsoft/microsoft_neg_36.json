      "text": "Windows 10 Tells Chrome and Firefox Users That Microsoft’s Browser Is ‘Safer’ AFP by Charlie Nash 23 Nov 2016 0\n23\nMicrosoft is attempting to lure users to its own Edge browser (formerly Internet Explorer) by creating pop-up “tips” that claim the browser to be safer than competitors. The tip has been reported to pop up when users launch competing browsers such as Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox, however it is not currently known as to how long this function has been implemented.\nIn July, it was discovered that Windows 10 would provide a “tip” that encouraged people to use the supposedly more battery-efficient Edge browser instead of competitors when charge was getting low on a user’s laptop.\n“These Windows Tips notifications were created to provide people with quick, easy information,” said a Microsoft spokesman in July after people noticed, adding that they “can help them enhance their Windows 10 experience.”\nIt was also announced this week that Netflix’s 4K mode would be heading to PC , with Microsoft capitalizing on the announcement with an exclusivity deal to market their Edge browser.\n“While a number of TVs and set-top-boxes already support 4K Netflix streams, the PC has largely been left out of the high-quality streams due to piracy fears,” wrote the Verge . “Netflix is now supporting 4K streaming through Microsoft’s Edge browser, but you’ll need a new PC to actually make use of it. Netflix is only supporting 7th generation (Kaby Lake) Intel Core processors, and there aren’t many laptops that actually support both the 4K display required and the new Intel processors.”\nCharlie Nash is a reporter for Breitbart Tech.

      "text": "Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends \nThe holiday season is an important one for computer manufacturers, and Microsoft is using a unique marketing strategy in the United Kingdom to push you to buy a computer. The company says buying a new PC this Christmas could save you a full day of boot time. \nMicrosoft’s claim comes from research in the U.K. that estimates computers than are more than three years old take 65 percent longer to boot, adding up to 23.5 hours of boot time over a full calendar year. Boot times aren’t the only problem — these same older computers on average take 3.5 times longer to fix issues than newer machines. \nMore: 6 ways to repurpose an old PC \nThe issue is more pronounced among older computer users as they are much less likely to own more modern PCs. Nearly a fifth of those over the age of 55 own a PC that is more than five years old and those individuals lose on average more than two hours a month in boot up times. \nNo doubt as some of us with older PCs are aware, computer slowdowns and malfunctions are a source of frustration. Microsoft’s survey backs this up: two-thirds of computer users with PCs between five and 10 years old admitted to hitting or shouting at it in frustration, with six percent even admitting these issues caused them to cry or drove them to drink (yes, really). \nAnother key finding was an overall lack of knowledge of the capabilities of modern computers. While Windows 10 offers advanced interactivity features, a sizeable portion of those surveys didn’t know they existed or thought they still were years away from being a reality. \nFor example, a majority of those surveyed thought that facial recognition as a method to log in to their PCs was at least two years away, while 42 percent were not aware that voice recognition capabilities were already available on Windows 10 machines. \nThe moral of this story? It’s time to retire that old trusty PC and splurge on a shiny new model this holiday season. Also watch: HP Spectre Review",

      "text": "Learn More \nMicrosoft’s Surface line of hardware has been monumentally successful. Not only has it generated significant revenues and profits for the company, but Surface has also spurred the production of an increasing number of excellent Windows 10 2-in-1 machines and generally pushed the Windows ecosystem forward . \nAt the same time, Surface machines have suffered from numerous issues. Everything from battery life to display reliability to general performance has suffered from buggy drivers and firmware and Microsoft has been working overtime to address them. Now, it seems that the company might be planning to offer a trade-in alternative for some Surface Book customers as a solution ongoing issues, OnMSFT reports . \nMore: Microsoft apologizes for Surface Book and Surface Pro 4 issues \nDoing a quick search on Google for “Surface firmware” will reveal an avalanche of stories on both the Surface Pro line of Windows 10 tablet convertibles and the Surface Book notebook with a detachable screen. A common theme of the stories is the steady release of driver and firmware updates intended to address issues with the machines. It could be that the software is not the problem, but rather the software could be attempting to overcome underlying hardware problems. \nA recent technical support discussion by the owner of the first-generation Surface Book indicates that Microsoft could be considering a trade-in program to the new generation Surface Book with Performance Base that was introduced in October. Certainly, it’s conceivable that the new Surface Books implement updated components that address issues with the earlier machines and enabling a trade-in program would be one way to best serve Microsoft customers. \nAt the same time, the information comes from a historically unreliable source — a technical support representative — and so nobody should be packing up their Surface Book machines quite yet to take into their local Microsoft Store. It’s also entirely possible that if a trade-in program were to be created, then only certain issues will be included and there could be a cost. After all, the Surface Book with Performance Base models are more expensive than their predecessors. \nIf you are a Surface Book owner, then you will likely want to keep your eyes open for news directly from Microsoft. Contacting a Microsoft Store might be another avenue for learning if such a trade-in program is in the works. If you’re suffering from any of the more common Surface Book issues, then chances are you are already well-acquainted with Microsoft’s technical support process.

Sorry There was an error emailing this page. \nA pedestrian walks past a sign on Microsoft Headquarters campus July 17, 2014 in Redmond, Washington. Credit: Stephen Brashear/Getty Images for Microsoft More like this 4 great gifts for mobile professionals \nMicrosoft has faced a tough battle getting its $26 billion acquisition of LinkedIn approved in Europe. Salesforce has challenged the move on competitive grounds, and the EU competition authority has reached out to a number of competitors for comment. Now Microsoft reportedly is suggesting a set of concessions to European regulators in an attempt to get the deal approved. \nThe tech titan has suggested that LinkedIn's competitors could create add-ins that let their content show up inside Outlook, according to the Wall Street Journal . Specifically, the add-ins would let competing social networks display their information in Outlook, so users could do things like see someone’s profile in a calendar entry. \nAllowing companies like German professional social network XING to get real estate inside Microsoft's email client may sound generous, but it's not much of a concession, all things considered. \n[ Download the State of the CIO 2016 report ] \nMicrosoft already offers an open platform for companies to create and publish Office add-ins, including those that run in Outlook. Any company can develop an add-in and distribute it through its own channels or Microsoft's Office Store, so long as it meets certain requirements around security and performance. \nIt's likely to be an even less appealing concession for Salesforce, which already has an Outlook add-in that it developed in partnership with Microsoft. The proposal also doesn't address one of Salesforce's leading concerns: that Microsoft is going to hoard LinkedIn's data, which it could use to gain a competitive edge in the CRM market. \nMicrosoft reportedly also proposed that manufacturers like Dell would be able to disable any sort of LinkedIn \"shortcut\" on computers they produce, in echoes of previous settlements the company has made around its bundling of browsers with Windows. \nMicrosoft declined to comment on the report, and a representative for Salesforce did not respond by press time. \nIt remains unclear how those suggested concessions have been received by regulators and whether the deal will be drawing to a close any time soon. Microsoft announced the blockbuster acquisition in June and said then that it expected the deal to close by the end of the year.

      "text": "​Flights resume after Melbourne Airport 'network connectivity' issue \nEmbracing digital transformation: Experiences from Australian organisations states that there is no right way to approach digital transformation; however, most Australian organisations opted for a \"test and learn\" approach involving discrete projects and experiments, rather than structured programs. \nThis experimental approach allowed for faster iterations and encouraged buy-in from the rest of the business, according to Microsoft's research. \nImproving customer experience remained the top driver and starting point of digital transformation. Empowering employees, optimising operations, and developing new products and services also influence technology investments in Australia, the research found. \n\"We've found that every organisation -- no matter how large or small, whether they're in the private sector or public sector -- is thinking about how they prepare themselves for whatever digital future might be appropriate for the businesses they operate,\" said Steven Worrall, enterprise and partner group director at Microsoft Australia. \nHe added that the reason Microsoft takes a broad view of digital transformation is because the ability to invest in new projects is directly related to the savings that come from moving workloads into the public cloud. \n\"An organisation moving their application base off their own datacentre or an outsourced datacentre into the public cloud can save 30 to 40 percent of their existing cost to run applications,\" Worrall said. \n\"Those savings can be reinvested into new applications that your customers might use tomorrow or in a new part of the business, or a new application that you might roll out to a new segment of the market.\" \nMicrosoft's research also found that digital transformation requires a pro-innovation corporate mindset before the right technology can be deployed across an organisation. Successful transformation programs are supported by strong leadership, an entrepreneurial culture, and a pipeline to digital skills. \n\"Transformation is underpinned by a digital mindset that is a unique interplay of technology, people, and process. It is adopting this mindset that we believe truly puts an organisation on the path to digital transformation,\" said Microsoft Australia's managing director Pip Marlow. \nOrganisations fell into two groups: \"Proactive and embracing\" and \"motivated but constrained\". \nProactive and embracing organisations made digital transformation a priority, and encouraged their people to pursue it. They also recognised the importance of questioning existing business models and experimenting with news ones; however, only a handful were acting on this as part of the digital transformation process. \n\"Proactive organisations have a clear strategy around those four parameters -- that is, customer experience, employee empowerment, operational optimisation, and business model transformation -- as to where they wanted to have the most impact and the sequence with which they would then undertake investments necessary to build out that digital capability,\" said Worrall. \nMeanwhile, motivated but constrained organisations found their digital aspirations hampered by internal obstacles. These organisations were found to have a risk-averse culture, with their leaders avoiding making decisions that could lead to failure. \n\"A lot of the discussion around digital transformation becomes a technology discussion -- who's got the best mobile phone, who's got the best security infrastructure, who's got the best public cloud service,\" said Worrall. \"We found that technology is a secondary issue. It's more about people, leadership, and the capabilities they had inside the organisation to adopt and adapt some of these new digital technologies to their business.\" \nWhile respondents said the pace of technological change presented ongoing challenges, most believed that upcoming innovations including expanded cloud computing services, the Internet of Things (IoT), artificial intelligence, and virtual reality would drive new inventions. \n\"There's no doubt that harnessing the right technology can dramatically improve customer and staff experiences and lift productivity,\" Marlow said. \"It can even take organisations into whole new areas of business or allow new ones to emerge.\" \nWorrall said a lot of Microsoft's knowledge was gained from its own digital transformation journey. \n\"Microsoft was a dominant leader in the industry for the first 30 years of our history. For the next 10 years, we struggled,\" Worrall said. \"We've been on a journey of learning over the last 10 years. We were being viewed as an organisation that was not as relevant as it had been. Now we're in the process of reinventing ourselves. \n\"Organisations that feel like they're at the top of their game and they just need to keep the machine going, we think they're more likely to suffer disruption than those organisations that are constant learners, that are running experiments, that are trying and failing, and that are learning and improving.\" \nWorrall also said that digital transformation is percolating into unexpected industries such as agriculture, hospitality, and sports. \nMicrosoft is currently working with a Tasmanian company called The Yield that helps oyster farmers save money through technology, allowing them to analyse components such as salinity levels in the water and predict when oysters need to be pulled out. \n\"If there was a storm and you knew polluted water was going to move towards the oyster farm in the next 24 hours, then you can take action to pull the oysters out,\" Worrall said. \nThe tech giant is also working with a company that's putting sensors in pineapples so farmers can identify the optimum time to harvest them based on weight and other factors. \nAnother client of Microsoft is Cricket Australia, which has been using predictive analytics to estimate when its athletes will perform their best, or when they're likely to get ill or injured. \n\"We're helping them be more scientific about how they manage player welfare. Predictive analytics is really useful for them, because they were able to tailor training workloads leading up to a big game,\" Worrall said. \n\"They were finding that their athletes were not subject to the sort of injuries they were experiencing in the past.\" \nMeanwhile, travel booking site Webject recently developed a blockchain solution in partnership with Microsoft, which it will be implementing into its supply chain, from acquiring wholesale hotel rooms to selling them. The companies said the solution has the potential to transform the way the entire travel industry handles online payments for hotel bookings. \n\"We're also seeing legal firms use blockchain to help automate some of their contractual processes, so technology we thought would be used in one space is being applied in new ways to another,\" Worrall said. \"There are as many business problems as there are technology solutions waiting to solve those problems.\" \nIn another study , Microsoft found that almost half of Australian IT leaders will drive their organisations' transition to hybrid cloud infrastructure over the next 12 to 18 months. \n\"The cloud holds rich new applications which will enable better management tools, intelligent applications, and advanced analytics to not just reduce cost and increase efficiency but to also innovate and enable faster time to market. As such, it can't be ignored but it needs to be managed,\" Mike Heald, hybrid cloud product manager at Microsoft Australia, said in early November. \nThe Telsyte Australian Infrastructure & Cloud Computing Market Study 2017 also showed that big data analytics, storage, IoT, artificial intelligence, and process digitisation are all driving the demand for cloud services . \nVMware CEO Pat Gelsinger believes half of all enterprise workloads , about 300 million, will exist on the public cloud by 2030. \nThe Telsyte Australian Digital Workplace Study 2017 found that Australian enterprises are spending more of their IT budgets on the development of new products, making it a high priority compared to two years ago when their focus was on reducing operational costs. \nTelsyte's research indicates a greater uptake of emerging technologies among Australian enterprises, with 24 percent using 3D printers or having exploratory projects in place. Gartner also forecasts significant growth in the 3D printing market -- nearly 456,000 3D printers will be shipped globally by the end of the year, doubling the 219,000 units that were shipped last year, with 44 percent growth in enterprise shipments alone. \nIn addition, one in three enterprises intend to use robotics, while 25 percent of organisations with more than 500 employees are already using robotic process automation, according to Telsyte's research. \nAugmented reality (AR) and mixed reality (MR) are also of high interest, with 57 percent of enterprises currently using or intending to use AR/MR technology. Interest in Microsoft's HoloLens has been claimed to be \"very high\". \nTelsyte's research also found that 22 percent of enterprises have IoT programs or pilot programs in production, while 29 percent have IoT devices and a strategy, but nothing in operation.

      "text": "View Comments Pic: Reuters Microsoft (MSFT.O) is set to gain EU approval for its $26 billion buy of professional social network LinkedIn (LNKD.N) with tweaks to concessions aimed at addressing competition concerns, three people close to the matter said on Wednesday. Microsoft last week told the European Commission that it would still allow LinkedIn's rivals access to its software such as its Outlook program and give hardware makers the option of installing competing professional social networks on computers after the acquisition. The second plank of the concession is important because of the company's battle with the EU competition authority over the last decade and the policy of tying its products to block rivals, resulting in fines of more than 2.2 billion euros. The slight modifications came following feedback from rivals and customers, the people said, declining to provide details because of the sensitivity of the issue. The deal, Microsoft's largest ever acquisition, will allow the company to add a suite of sales, marketing and recruiting services to its core business products as it gears up for next-generation computing. However, it came amidst regulatory concerns and citizens' worries about big data and that some companies may use the huge amount of information they gather to squeeze out competitors and encroach on users' privacy. The deal has been criticized by U.S. rival Salesforce (CRM.N), which lost out on the bidding for LinkedIn and which urged regulators to examine the antitrust and data privacy issues thoroughly before approving it. The Commission, which is scheduled to decide on the deal by Dec. 6, as well as Microsoft, declined to comment. Authorities in the United States, Canada, Brazil and South Africa have already nodded through the acquisition without demanding concessions. The bulk of LinkedIn's $3 billion annual revenue comes from job hunters and recruiters who pay a monthly fee to post resumes and connect with people. - Reuters",

      "text": "Gaming Microsoft may dramatically change Xbox One's Snap Mode Xbox One's clunky and awkward Snap Mode will apparently be scrapped in favor of a newer faster picture-in-picture multi-tasking mode Comment | Email to a Friend | Font Size: A A \nSnap Mode is one of the most annoying and truly backwards features that the Xbox One has to offer; originally created as a means of fluidly and easily multi-tasking by running two apps at once, Snap Mode extremely clunky and cumbersome. The mode runs in the right-hand side of the screen and actually shrinks the main screen, making for some distorted and rather clumsy/slow \"multi-tasking\". But it looks like Snap Mode is getting a major change for the better, and Microsoft is keen on evolving the feature for a new generation. \nA mock-up of Xbox One's new picture-in-picture Snap Mode. \nMicrosoft has already given the Xbox One OS a huge facelift with the New Xbox One Experience update , which adding a ton of functionality like backward compatibility, a 50% speed boost while navigating menus, enabled Windows 10 UWP integration via a custom OneCore OS and added a new quick launch bar. Now it seems Microsoft wants to optimize the system even further by completely evolving the outdated Snap Mode feature. \nAccording to Windows Central , Microsoft is currently experimenting with a new picture-in-picture Snap Mode feature. It seems that Microsoft's motivations to remove the legacy Snap Mode aren't totally aligned with user feedback, but basic functionality, as Windows 10 Universal Windows Platform apps cannot leverage the current Snap Mode. \nRemember that Microsoft needs to make some serious changes to the Xbox One UI and functionality in order to streamline the OS for its new \"monster\" 4K-ready Project Scorpio console . \n\"I've been told that Snap Mode could be getting removed completely,\" Windows Central's Jez Cordon reports. \"Indeed, Universal Windows Platform apps are currently completely unable to utilize Snap Mode, and denying UWP apps access to the feature could be evidence enough of its impending removal.\" \n\"Instead, Xbox looks to be exploring the possibility of a picture-in-picture multitasking implementation, where \"snapped\" app would simply hover in the corner of your game, rather than wiping out a quarter of your screen with a largely empty bar.\" \nRead Also: Microsoft's plan to take over gaming might actually work \nNot only does the Xbox One's current Snap Mode feature shrink the main display, but it's clunky and slow. \n\"Our sources tell us that the only implementation they have seen so far shows the picture in the bottom-right hand corner of the screen,\" \"However, they noted that we'd likely be able to reposition the window or maybe even adjust the opacity to prevent UI elements in games from becoming completely obscured.\" \nSources apparently indicate that any app will be capable of running in the new picture-in-picture Snap Mode, unlike the current legacy version which only runs specific apps and content. \n\"I asked if only media apps like YouTube and OneGuide would be supported, specifically for video feeds, but they stated that any app can be displayed picture-in-picture, potentially opening up some interesting opportunities for developers. Time will tell how, when, and if this feature sees public access.\" \nThe publication also reports that Microsoft's other UI changes will extend across the board, including a new and improved One Guide that features even more content from the dashboard including easy access game and app pins. \nIt'll be interesting to see how Microsoft continues to evolve the Xbox One over time, but let's just hope they stop bricking original Xbox One consoles with their clumsy OS updates. My Xbox One has bricked four separate times now, all from downloading official console updates directly over Xbox LIVE.",

      "text": "microsoft old pc boot times oldpc More Shebeko/Shutterstock\nThe holiday season is an important one for computer manufacturers, and Microsoft is using a unique marketing strategy in the United Kingdom to push you to buy a computer. The company says buying a new PC this Christmas could save you a full day of boot time.\nMicrosoft’s claim comes from research in the U.K. that estimates computers than are more than three years old take 65 percent longer to boot, adding up to 23.5 hours of boot time over a full calendar year. Boot times aren’t the only problem — these same older computers on average take 3.5 times longer to fix issues than newer machines.\nMore: 6 ways to repurpose an old PC\nThe issue is more pronounced among older computer users as they are much less likely to own more modern PCs. Nearly a fifth of those over the age of 55 own a PC that is more than five years old and those individuals lose on average more than two hours a month in boot up times.\nNo doubt as some of us with older PCs are aware, computer slowdowns and malfunctions are a source of frustration. Microsoft’s survey backs this up: two-thirds of computer users with PCs between five and 10 years old admitted to hitting or shouting at it in frustration, with six percent even admitting these issues caused them to cry or drove them to drink (yes, really).\nAnother key finding was an overall lack of knowledge of the capabilities of modern computers. While Windows 10 offers advanced interactivity features, a sizeable portion of those surveys didn’t know they existed or thought they still were years away from being a reality.\nFor example, a majority of those surveyed thought that facial recognition as a method to log in to their PCs was at least two years away, while 42 percent were not aware that voice recognition capabilities were already available on Windows 10 machines.\nThe moral of this story? It’s time to retire that old trusty PC and splurge on a shiny new model this holiday season.\nExpand your universe with Neil DeGrasse Tyson’s new video game Transform your desktop into a concert hall with these computer speakers How to overclock your CPU without setting your computer on fire",

In fact, this year marks the 26th year since it was available on a Windows platform. Now it’s going mobile and that opens it up for a much wider audience.\nReimagined as an app, Microsoft’s Solitaire comes with a number of different modes. If you never understood how to play Spider Solitaire, now is your chance. It comes along with the classic Klondike mode, Freecell, Tripeaks and Pyramid too, all with their own unique rulesets.\nMore: Bye-bye productivity: Google lets you play Solitaire, Tic-Tac-Toe with just a search\nTo keep you coming back — other than to avoid whatever it is you’re supposed to be doing — Microsoft has also implemented daily challenges, so you can play specific puzzles which challenge you to figure out how to complete the puzzle of the layered cards. New ones will be released every day, with varied difficulty levels.\nIf you manage to complete some hard ones too, you can even brag about it to your friends, since there is Xbox Live Support too. That way you can earn achievements and prove that you really did win without cycling through the deck more than once.\nThis being a free mobile game, there are some advertisements that you are forced to deal with, but if you like playing enough, you can put down $2 and Microsoft will strip them out and give you double coin rewards by becoming a premium member.\nOf course, there are other mobile Solitaire games available and have been for some time — it is a timeless classic after all.\n100 awesome Android games you need to try Arduino-powered ping pong table play music to match the intensity of your game Best Google Easter eggs",

      "text": "satya nadella microsoft phone ultimate windows mobile surface More Despite trying again and again, Microsoft just can’t seem to catch a break in the mobile world. But the company isn’t done trying yet — according to CEO Satya Nadella, the next Microsoft phone could be one of the best smartphones we’ve ever seen.\nIn an interview with the Australian Financial Review, Nadella said that Microsoft would “continue to be in the phone market” and that it would pave its own path to create the “ultimate mobile device.” In other words, Microsoft doesn’t even want to create the best phone by today’s standards — it wants to build a device that could herald a new generation of smartphones.\nMore: Procrastinators prepare: Microsoft’s Solitaire is on iOS and Android devices\nOf course, just because Microsoft wants to have such an impact on the smartphone industry, that doesn’t mean that it will — as we’ve seen time and time again, Microsoft’s mobile attempts have generally always missed the mark in some way.\nStill, even though the company has largely failed in the smartphone market, Microsoft is in the best position that it has ever been in to make waves. The Surface computers are selling like hotcakes, and they’ve even inspired a range of knockoff devices. Not only that, but the new Surface Studio was released to quite a bit of fanfare, and it’s likely we’ll see more successful hardware products in the computer world from Microsoft, too. If the company can somehow use that momentum to woo potential smartphone buyers, we could see a radical shift in the company’s smartphone prospects.\nIt will certainly be interesting to see what the company comes up with. Critics have called for Microsoft to quit that smartphone market at least a few times — hopefully it can now prove those critics wrong.\nHow to get Google's Pixel features on your Android phone Microsoft's new collapsible keyboard design unveiled by U.S. patent office LG thinks Europeans don't want big phones, so won't sell the V20 there",

Microsoft Office is a big export for the company, of course, but it seems that Xiaomi is also more interested in attaining a voice assistant as well.\nAfter all, Google Play Services aren’t available in China and while any single OEM can provide for a basic voice assistant , they might as well get a little something more out of it.\nWith those factors in mind, it shouldn’t be a surprise that we find Cortana making its pre-load debut on the new and bezelless Mi MIX , right alongside the Office apps. Xiaomi is the first OEM to add in the voice assistant to its software package.\nCyanogen previously also pre-loaded Cortana into its OS load.\nThe post Xiaomi continues Microsoft pre-load push with Cortana on Mi MIX appeared first on Pocketnow .\n",

What was once a semi-isolated affair has become a multi-agency, cross-continent operation, with governments and rights holders alike striving to share information and pool resources,\" said Mr Derek Appiah, Country Manager of Microsoft Ghana. \nThe Cyber Security Awareness week kicked off with highly informative and thought provoking discussions presenting opportunities for companies with cutting edge solutions to cyber security and available solutions to businesses and organisations. \nThe week would grace high caliber speakers, sharing their perspectives and experiences in solving the mounting security threats facing government and businesses today. \n\"The interactive Cyber Security Awareness programme would also provide keen insights into the challenges that businesses faced in protecting critical data from continued threats of attacks. \n\"Also during the same week, Microsoft has partnered with the Ghana Copyright office to announce their collaboration in the fight against counterfeit software which has impacted the lives of many users who have been exposed to security breaches. \n'We have partnered with…Ghana and the Ghana Copyright office to create awareness, to promote and protect the rights of both users and fabricators of technology solutions,' Mr Appiah said. \n\"Our networks are getting smarter so are the threats, it's more important than ever to work with Governments to strengthen intellectual property laws and crack down on piracy. \n'The impact of pirated and counterfeit software has impacted the lives of many users who have been exposed to security breaches. \n\"As a company, we make Cyber security which broadly includes anti-piracy, our day to day business and as an industry leader we shall continue to forge partnerships to counter these threats to our consumers,\" he said. \nMicrosoft is the leading platform and productivity company for the mobile-first, cloud-first world. \nIts mission is to empower every person and every organisation on the planet to achieve more.

On top of that, it's also giving away a free Display Dock worth $99, although that particular freebie has been available since September . \nKey specs of the Lumia 950 include: 5.2-inch AMOLED with Quad HD (2560x1440px) resolution Hexa-core 1.8GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon 808 processor 3GB RAM 32GB onboard storage (plus microSD card slot) 20MP PureView rear camera with auto focus, 6-lens optics, triple-LED flash, optical image stabilization and 4K video recording at 30fps 5MP front-facing camera with wide-angle lens and 1080p video recording Bluetooth 4.1 Wi-Fi 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac with Wi-Fi Direct support Qi wireless charging USB 3.1 port with Type-C connector 145 x 73.2 x 8.2mm; 150g \n...while those of the larger Lumia 950 XL are listed below: 5.7-inch AMOLED with Quad HD (2560x1440px) resolution Octa-core 2.0GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon 810 processor 3GB RAM 32GB onboard storage (plus microSD card slot) 20MP PureView rear camera with auto focus, 6-lens optics, triple-LED flash, optical image stabilization and 4K video recording at 30fps 5MP front-facing camera with wide-angle lens and 1080p video recording Bluetooth 4.1 Wi-Fi 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac with Wi-Fi Direct support Qi wireless charging USB 3.1 port with Type-C connector 151.9 x 78.4 x 8.3mm; 165g \nThe Lumia 950 and 950 XL were originally unveiled over a year ago , but it seems that Microsoft has no immediate plans to replace them. Devices such as the HP Elite x3 ( $799 with a desktop dock ) and the newer Alcatel IDOL 4S ($469 with virtual reality headset) have recently launched with newer specs to fill the gap at the top of the Windows 10 Mobile range. \nBut those hoping for a new Windows flagship phone from Microsoft itself may face a long wait. Recent rumors have suggested that the company won't launch its much-rumored 'Surface phone' for at least another a year . It could be worth the wait, though - Microsoft's CEO said this week that the company is focused on developing \"the most ultimate mobile device\" .",

In August, Cricket Wireless dropped the price of the Lumia 650 to just $49.99 with a new activation and no annual contract - and the device is available free for those who port their number across from other carriers. \nIf your budget stretches further, you might want to consider Microsoft's Windows 10 Mobile flagships. The company is currently offering the Lumia 950 XL - priced at $499 - with a free Lumia 950, worth $399, along with a free Display Dock, usually priced at $99. Tags",

      "title": "Using Microsoft Query in Excel to Retreive SQL Server Data",
      "text": "By: Douglas Correa | Read Comments | Related Tips: More > Microsoft Excel Integration Problem \nExcel is an easy way to retrieve external data from SQL Server or other database platforms. We are used to retrieving data from a table or a view, but sometimes we need to filter the data using parameters like using a WHERE clause in a SQL query. The problem is that you need to change the SQL statement every time you need a different result or if the table has so many records you can't load everything into Excel at once. Solution \nYou can use Microsoft Query to retrieve data from external sources, you don't have to retype the query and you can use Excel cells to filter the data from the database. \nTo import external data into Excel with Microsoft Query, follow the steps below. \nOn the DATA tab, click From Other Sources and then click From Microsoft Query. \nSpecify a data source for a database, text file or Excel workbook. \nFollow the steps below to create a new data source. \nOnce you have configured the database server options, you need to select the table where you will get the data. The query wizard helps to create a simple SQL query to retrieve all data from that table. After finishing the query wizard you will select the option to edit the query in Microsoft Query. \nThe window after those steps is similar to the MS Access Query Wizard. In the previous steps we didn't choose to filter data and now you will change the SQL statement typing the WHERE clause with \"?\" as the parameter value. \nAbove you defined which field or fields will work to filter your data. Now choose how the parameter value is obtained and in this case you select to get the value from the following cell. \nWith two parameters in this example, the cells for the date can be seen below and after changing the value you will get different results. Conclusion \nInstead retrieving the entire dataset from the table and then filtering in Excel, you can use filters to retrieve only the necessary data using a SQL query.

      "text": "Microsoft Solitaire Collection Now Available for Android and iOS The mobile game comes with Xbox Live integration Comes with FreeCell, Spider, Klondike, Tripeaks and Pyramid game modes Complete daily challenges to earn badges and rewards \nIt is hard to argue the fact that classic games hold a special place in the hearts of millions of gamers around the world. When it comes to a game like Microsoft's Solitaire, which has been shipped with almost every version of Windows since the 1990s, the bond becomes even more special. This is why Microsoft has given a reason to rejoice to gamers around the world as the company has finally brought its Solitaire game to both Android and iOS mobile platforms. Of course, the single-player card game was already available on both stores from different developers. \nMicrosoft Solitaire Collection is now available for free and can be downloaded from Google Play and the App Store . The mobile version of the app comes with five different game modes including FreeCell, Spider, Klondike, Tripeaks, and Pyramid. Further, the game comes with Xbox Live integration that allows your progress to be saved in the cloud. This means that you can continue playing on another device with either Windows 10 or Android/iOS and even share your Xbox Live achievements with your friends and family. The completion of daily challenges within the game will help players earn badges and rewards.\nThe Redmond-based company has made the premium version of the app, which comes without any ads, game boosts, and double coins for daily challenges, free for a month on Android in order to celebrate the worldwide release of its mobile game. This special offer ends December 31. \nAlthough there have been several solitaire games on mobile platforms for many years now, the loyal players to the original Microsoft game have finally got the mobile game for which they have awaited for years.",

      "text": "By Andy Weir Senior News Editor Neowin LLC @gcaweir · 3 seconds ago \nWay back in February, at Mobile World Congress, HP unveiled the Elite x3, a powerful new Windows 10 Mobile flagship phone . Alongside the handset itself, HP also revealed the Mobile Extender, a notebook-style device that supports Windows 10 Mobile's PC-style Continuum mode ; that peripheral device would later launch as the Lap Dock . \nThe Elite x3 went on sale in the US in September priced at $799, including the Desk Dock for Continuum mode , which allows owners to use a mouse and keyboard with the device when connected to a larger display. The Lap Dock accessory costs a further $599 - but as part of its Black Friday promotions, Microsoft is now offering a bundle that combines the Elite x3, Desk Dock and Lap Dock with substantial savings. \nThe Microsoft Store is now offering a special 'HP Elite x3 Holiday Bundle' , which includes: An unlocked Elite x3 phone Desk Dock A case for the handset Elite x3 Screen Protector \nBuying each of these items separately would usually cost over $1460 - but Microsoft is offering the bundle for $1,149, saving you around $312 on the full price. However, if you're thinking of grabbing that Holiday Bundle, don't wait too long - it will only be available until November 28. \nThe Elite x3's key specs include: 5.96-inch AMOLED with Quad HD (2560x1440px) resolution, Corning Gorilla Glass 4, and anti-reflective coating Quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 SoC 4GB RAM 64GB onboard storage (plus microSD card support) 16MP rear camera",

      "text": "Microsoft is set to gain EU approval for its $26 billion buy of professional social network LinkedIn with tweaks to concessions aimed at addressing competition concerns, three people close to the matter said on Wednesday.\nMicrosoft last week told the European Commission that it would still allow LinkedIn’s lnkd rivals access to its software such as its Outlook program and give hardware makers the option of installing competing professional social networks on computers after the acquisition.\nThe second plank of the concession is important because of the company’s battle with the EU competition authority over the last decade and the policy of tying its products to block rivals, resulting in fines of more than 2.2 billion euros.\nThe slight modifications came following feedback from rivals and customers, the people said, declining to provide details because of the sensitivity of the issue.\nThe deal, Microsoft’s msft largest ever acquisition, will allow the company to add a suite of sales, marketing and recruiting services to its core business products as it gears up for next-generation computing.\nGet Data Sheet , Fortune’s technology newsletter.\nHowever, it came amidst regulatory concerns and citizens’ worries about big data and that some companies may use the huge amount of information they gather to squeeze out competitors and encroach on users’ privacy.\nThe deal has been criticized by U.S. rival Salesforce .com crm , which lost out on the bidding for LinkedIn and which urged regulators to examine the antitrust and data privacy issues thoroughly before approving it.\nThe Commission, which is scheduled to decide on the deal by Dec. 6, as well as Microsoft, declined to comment.\nAuthorities in the United States, Canada, Brazil, and South Africa have already nodded through the acquisition without demanding concessions.\nThe bulk of LinkedIn’s $3 billion annual revenue comes from job hunters and recruiters who pay a monthly fee to post resumes and connect with people.",

      "title": "Top 10 Tips to Keep Exchange Server Healthy",
      "text": "The Microsoft Exchange Server which runs exclusively on Windows Server Operating System helps businesses in storing and managing their confidential information for years. If the Exchange database (EDB) file turns corrupt, all the sensitive information stored in it becomes inaccessible. This is a huge setback for businesses that have the server environment setup to manage their significant data. Therefore, database administrators (DBAs) in the businesses who are responsible for administering the Exchange Server database must employ steps to keep Exchange Server in a healthy state.\nHere, we present the top 10 tips:\n\n \n#1. Run MS ‘Exchange Server Best Practices Analyzer (ExBPA)’ occasionally ExBPA is a tool by Microsoft that checks if you have configured the Exchange server correctly. Therefore, you should run it just after deploying it as well as at regular intervals after the configuration to fine-tune the organization. The reason being, the Microsoft’s recommendations changes with time. This is to ensure more efficient and secure way of deploying the server environment.\n#2. Configure Database Maintenance Schedules With time, activities such as sending, receiving, moving, and deleting emails bring the Exchange database in a state of fragmentation. Therefore, Microsoft has designed Exchange to run the maintenance cycle every night on own. Nevertheless, the default period used might not be the best choice for your environment. So, you should schedule the maintenance at the time when the server has to perform a minimum task, and at a time when it won’t interfere with the backup process that takes place every night. If your Exchange Server contains several stores, then you can schedule the maintenance for each store, and at a different time.\n#3. Execute Manual Integrity Checks Quarterly Although Exchange Server automatically performs maintenance tasks on its database on a regular basis, you should manually conduct integrity checks every quarter with the inbuilt Isinteg and Eseutil command. This is because the manual tests allow you to see if any issue exists within the database; and, if it does, proper action is taken to fix it. Before performing an integrity check, you should ensure that you have a backup created for the database. This is because performing manual integrity checks causes corruption in the database at times.\nHowever, if the in-built tools fail to repair the damaged database, you should use Mailbox Exchange Recovery, a third-party Exchange Server recovery software . It specializes in repairing damaged Exchange Server Database (EDB) files and retrieves database mailboxes regardless of the level of corruption.\n#4. Check Exchange Database for Free Space Your Exchange database should not possess a significant amount of free space. Therefore, you should regularly check your database for free space. The easiest way to find the amount of free space is searching for application logs for Event ID 1221 on your server. The Event Properties dialog box displays the free space size in the database. This number can be used along with the database’s total size to calculate the percentage of free space. It is important to note that the free space is considered more if it occupies more than 15 percent of the total database size.\n#5. Test Your Exchange Server Backup Regularly You should keep on checking your Exchange backup regularly, although it is not the major part of the maintenance process. This is because it is necessary for the Exchange backup to be in a healthy state in events of corruption in the Exchange database. You can perform a check on the backup on a monthly or a regular basis by restoring it to lab servers.\n#6. Verify Regular Automatic Maintenance Tasks The eleven automated maintenance task of Exchange occurs regularly. You should check at least once a week as to whether all the tasks are getting accomplished on time. However, there isn’t a single place available to confirm a successful completion of the maintenance cycle has completed successfully. Thus, the event-log entries such as Event ID 1221, Event IDs 700 and 701, Event IDs 9531–9535, and Event IDs 1206 and 1207 can be used to check it.\n#7. Keep Regular Track of Exchange Database Size The next thing by which you can keep your Exchange Server healthy is by documenting the growth of its database (database size) regularly. For instance, once a month. You can incorporate it easily by verifying the backups. You must keep track of the size of the latest backup as well as the time that is consumed for the backup to complete. These data will assist you in anticipating the future storage necessities of your server.\nMonitoring the growth of your database will help you to see in advance whether your backups will take more time than the allotted time span, and if you are at risk of exceeding the storage capacity of the backup.\n#8. Check the Exchange Queue for Stuck Messages At times, email messages get delayed as they are in the queue on the Exchange Server. Therefore, to keep the server in a healthy state, check the queue at regular intervals for delayed messages. If messages are delayed, you can use the message tracking to troubleshoot the issue or delete the delayed message. The Exchange Server provides you with the option to send a non-delivery report (NDR) for all the messages that you have deleted.\n#9. Use Ops Manager or Its Update Here, you can invest in either Microsoft Operations Manager (MOM) or System Center Operation, which is its latest update. The Ops Manager is a solution that can monitor the performance of your Exchange server and event-log entries. It keeps track of resource utilization and server response time, therefore, alerting you to situations that could eventually lead to issues. Here, it is essential for you to employ a hands-on resolution.\n#10. Examine Your UPS Another option is to examine your UPS to ensure that there is uninterrupted supply of power. You should perform a check every month so that it runs smoothly. The reason being, UPS does not last forever, as with time, the capacity of its battery diminishes. Therefore, in case of a power failure, your UPS should begin running so as to keep the servers working without any interruption. This is because a UPS that works uninterruptedly, keeps the Exchange server running.\nConclusion The above-described solutions are the top 10 tips that help keep the Exchange Server healthy. You can use any of them that you believe will work best for you. These tips will help you keep your Exchange Server in a healthy state, therefore, keeping your data safe and secure.\n",

      "text": "Microsoft participates in Global Informatics Forum, 2016 Microsoft participates in Global Informatics Forum, 2016   Microsoft stand at the Global Informatics Forum \nIn line with its commitment to accelerate government modernization in the era of “Digital Transformation” towards a knowledge based economy, Microsoft unveiled an array of solutions at the Global Informatics Forum from the 21 st to 23 rd November in Kuwait. The event was held under the patronage of His Highness Sheikh Sabah Al Ahmad Al Jaber Al Sabah, Amir of Kuwait, and organized by His Highness Sheikh Salem Al-Ali Al-Sabah Informatics Corporation. \nThe event acted as a platform aiming at encouraging individuals and establishments to participate in the knowledge economy by adopting new technologies, promote entrepreneurship and provide an interactive platform for the exchange of knowledge, experience and expertise. \nMicrosoft demonstrated its latest Mass Happiness Index solution based on Microsoft Cognitive Services that captures facial expressions in massive crowds, processes the emotions and reports analysis in real-time. The technology using a set of Emotion APIs can be leveraged at various events and locations to study audience response and use the data collected to make intelligent actions. \nThe Mass Happiness Index enables the capture of a range of sentiments such as anger, contempt, disgust, fear, sadness and surprise; gauging the happiness level of the individual. \n“Our participation at the Global Informatics Forum is in line with Microsoft’s support to the Kuwait Government modernization and innovation objectives and to succeed in this journey of digital transformation, providing leading services to its citizens” said Charles Nahas, Country General Manager, Microsoft Kuwait. “The region is in pursuit of digitization to achieve a knowledge based economy, and Kuwait is rapidly accelerating towards adoption of innovative technologies and solutions” \nVisitors to the Microsoft stand in the Future Zone at the Global Informatics Forum were also able to experience its cloud solutions including Internet of Things (IoT) and Business Intelligence tools. Shijaz Abdulla, Business Transformation Specialist for Microsoft Kuwait, also delivered a session on Azure, its world-class hyper scale cloud computing platform used to build, host and scale business applications. Audiences received an overview on Azure cloud, along with a brief account of services that can aid in improving IT efficiency for the Government of Kuwait. \nA research conducted by Accenture states that digital transformation can have a significant impact on the country’s economy, boosting innovation and reducing back office costs to 45%. It also highlights that a 1 % increase in digitization can result in 0.5 % GDP gain, and a 1.9% gain in international trade. Microsoft has always endorsed government modernization, focusing on building products and solutions that can be leveraged to generate accurate insights for digital transparency, value creation and for delivering more personal and intelligent computing services for citizens. \n“The world is progressing at an alarming rate with digital technology transforming the way we live, work and interact with each other. With the exponential growth in data and information, it has become vital for governments to ascend towards and adopt digital transformation”. Said Nahas. “At Microsoft, we are focused in empowering governments and organisations to gain access to, and deploy intelligent technology for addressing the most pressing societal challenges. We strive to significantly expand our efforts towards modernizing government institutions across Kuwait and enable them to embrace current practices through our software and services, and our cloud computing capabilities; empowering them to achieve more.”",

      "text": "Home » News » Us News » Play Microsoft's solitaire on your smartphone Play Microsoft's solitaire on your smartphone 24 minutes ago | 24-11-2016 | IANS New York, Nov 24 : You can now play Microsoft's popular Solitaire on iOS or Android phone for free as the game will be available outside Windows for the first time in 25 years. [NK US] The Verge on Thursday reported that Microsoft is offering its Solitaire Collection on iOS and Android free of charge, as the company hopes to gain more players to add to the 119 million who have played the game on Windows 8 and Windows 10. The modern Solitaire Collection includes Klondike, Spider, FreeCell, Pyramid and Tripeaks game types. There will also be daily challenges for players. \"Microsoft is integrating Xbox Live into the game so you can sign into Solitaire and play with friends or earn achievements,\" noted the report. There will also be a $1.99 \"Premium Edition\" that will not contain any ads and include rewards for challenges and game boosts. Though other Solitaire games are already available for iOS and Android, Microsoft terms the game as \"World's number one Solitaire game\" owing to its huge following on Windows. The game can be downloaded from Apple's App Store for iOS and for the Android, it is available on Google's Play Store. qd/py/vm",

News Tweet by Damian Seeto on November 24, 2016 \nFor some reason, Microsoft is selling the standard version of Final Fantasy 15 on Xbox One for only $34.99. This is a great deal since the game’s not out yet. \nIf you click here , you’ll see that the Microsoft Store is selling the Day-One edition of Final Fantasy 15 for $34.99. It could be a Black Friday sale because besides the listing it says you save $25.00 off the normal price. Then again, it could be a mega pricing error. \nBear in mind, it looks like this sale is only valid for USA customers only. I tried looking at the New Zealand store, and that was still full price. It’s actually more expensive to buy the game on the Microsoft Store in New Zealand than it is at other retailers… \nThe Day-One edition of the game includes not only the game itself, but the Masamune DLC weapon. It’s worth noting only the Day-One edition is on sale. The Deluxe Edition that includes Kingsglaive and other extras is still selling for $89.99. Sadly, it also looks like there are no discounts for PS4 gamers at the moment.",

      "text": "Xiaomi ties-up with Microsoft to bring Cortana to Mi Mix Xiaomi ties-up with Microsoft to bring Cortana to Mi Mix Microsoft has brought about some significant changes to Cortana with its Windows 10 Anniversary Update. Published:November 24, 2016 1:32 pm Xiaomi Mi Mix will come with Microsoft’s voice-assistant Cortana pre-installed, reveals a report in mspoweruser. \nXiaomi Mi Mix will come with Microsoft ’s voice-assistant Cortana pre-installed, reveals a report in mspoweruser. The Chinese smartphone maker had tied up with Microsoft in June to pre-install Microsoft’s Office suite of apps and Skype on its devices. “And now, it looks like the company is also pre-installing Cortana on its devices such as the bezel-less Mi Mix,” the report adds. However, Xiaomi is not the first Android OEM to have partnered with Microsoft to bring Cortana to its smartphones. Back in 2015, OnePlus teamed up with Microsoft to offer Cortana to Cyanogen users via over-the-air update. \nMicrosoft has brought about some significant changes to Cortana with its Windows 10 Anniversary Update. Cortana is now more accessible even from the lockscreen. With the new update, Windows 10 users can ask Cortana to play music or set reminder directly from the lockscreen. \nXiaomi launched its edge-less design concept smartphone – Mi Mix – last month. And rumours of a new 5.5-inch display variant of the smartphone were doing rounds online. However, latest reports deny the existence of such a device. MyDrivers quoted an official source from Xiaomi who said there’s no such product as Mi Mix Nano, putting an end to all rumours around the device. \nA separate report in GizmoChina has revealed images of the Mi Mix in white colour variant. The current Mi Mix has a 6.4-inch (2040 x 1080 pixels resolution) IPS LCD display with a 91.3 per cent screen-to-body ratio, and was launched in just a black version. The edge-to-edge device comes with a custom 17:9 aspect ratio. A new colour variant could mean Xiaomi is looking to boost the sale of Mi Mix by giving users more colour choices. \nRead: Apple iPhone 8 to Samsung Galaxy S8: The bezel-less smartphones are coming \nXiaomi Mi Mix is powered by a Quad-core Snapdragon 821 processor coupled with an Adreno 530 GPU. It is available in two variants – 4GB RAM/128GB ROM and 6GB RAM/256GB ROM. The phone features a 16MP rear camera sensor with an f/2.0 aperture, EIS, dual-LED flash and phase detection auto-focus. The front shooter on the Mi Mix features an 8MP sensor which is at the bottom of the device. \nThe dual-SIM capable Mi Mix weights 209 grams, and is backed by a massive 4400 mAh non-removable Li-ion battery. The phone is equipped with Quick Charge 3.0 that allows the battery to be charged to 83 per cent in 30 minutes.  ",

Initially available for $199 unlocked and off-contract, the handset's dual SIM version is selling for just $99. The Windows 10-powered handset is a solid smartphone for the money with a 5-inch 720 x 1280 display, quad-core Qualcomm chipset, 1GB of RAM, 16GB of expandable storage, 8MP rear camera, 5MP front cam, a removable 2000mAh battery and LTE connectivity.Granted, the 650's spec sheet can't be called intense, but Windows 10 Mobile does make do with a minimum amount of hardware to function reasonably smooth. Unfortunately, you won't be able to pull off any demanding games or use case scenarios, but a normal user's essential daily usage needs should be covered.Mind you, though, there's an even cheaper deal on the Lumia 650. Cricket Wireless is selling it for $49.99 with a new activation and no annual contract. What's more, the device is available for free to those who carry over their number from other carriers. Is Microsoft trying to clear inventory? Also, Microsoft is currently selling the Lumia 950 XL for $499 with a free Lumia 950 thrown in, worth $399. It also gives away a free Display Dock, priced at $99. If you fancy a Windows 10 smartphone, that's certainly a compelling deal. Alas, such generous offerings are the outcome of a minuscule market share and falling revenue. But hey, at least those customers still interested in the platform can get a good deal on a Windows device. The Lumia 950 XL is powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 810 processor with 3GB RAM and features a 5.7-inch, 1440 x 2560 resolution screen, a 20MP rear camera, a 5MP front camera, 32GB of expandable storage, and a 3340mAh battery. The Lumia 950 you get for free has largely the same features, but runs on the less powerful Snapdragon 808 chipset. ALSO READ",

      "text": "Micosoft is believed to have pulled the plug on its Lumia range and possibly its fitness band range, but looks like that doesn’t mean the company has given up hope on building a smartphone. If reports are to be believed than the company is ready to bounce back into smartphone arena.\nNadella has been a ray of hope from the time he took the helms at Microsoft, and after some arguably great restructuring, he now believes that the company is building an ‘ultimate mobile device’. According to Australian Financial Review, Nadella said that the company will continue to be a part of the phone market.. He further said, “not as defined by today’s market leaders, but by what it is that we can uniquely do in what is the most ultimate mobile device.”\nThe report talks about how the company will focuss on offering something unique, rather on competing with others. The company, according to the report, is not afraid of taking risks and ready to enter new segments and also redefine old ones. Talking about Surface, he explained how the company jumped into the 2-in-1 or hybrid form factor three years ago, when it will still questioned. That reminds us, and Nadella also made it a point to be noted, that the company had released the HP Elite x3, a 3-in-1 device .\nMeanwhile, there have been rumours circulating about the alleged Surface Phone. And, reports about Lumia being showed the backdoor, puts the long time rumoured Surface Phone to the forefront. If reports are to be believed than there would be three Surface Phones targeting three different user groups – consumers, business users and enthusiasts. But nothing is known about the specifications of all three models yet, and the pricing is expected to be on the lines of higher-end segment. Surface Phones are likely to make an appearance in 2017 .\nThe post Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella says working on the ‘ultimate mobile device’: Report appeared first on Tech2 .",

      "text": "Microsoft Launches Solitaire For iOS And Android 8:25 am By Conner Flynn \nMost of us have played Windows Solitaire at some point. It’s a small game that has been included in every major Windows release for over 25 years. It has so far been limited to Microsoft’s platform, but the company is now expanding the game beyond its own platform. \nMicrosoft has confirmed that it has released Solitaire for iOS and Android. It’s a simple game, but it can be fun and relaxing for many people. The game for iOS and Android is called Solitaire Collection and it’s going to be available as a free download. So there is no reason not to check it out. The company says that over 119 million people have played this game on Windows 8 and Windows 10 so now more players can join in on the fun on iOS and Android. \nMicrosoft Solitaire Collection features Spider, FreeCell, Klondike, Tripeaks, and Pyramid game types. Players can also compete in daily challenges. But that’s not all, Xbox Live is integrated as well so players can compete with friends. There will also be a Premium Edition of Solitaire Collection for $1.99 per month which will give you an ad-free experience and double coin rewards for game boosts and daily challenges. This game will be all about nostalgia for most of us.",

With language translation software technology reaching a more mature state, comprehensive solutions are available that have never been available before. Comprehensive solutions combine the best attributes of rule-based and statistical machine translation. These integrated systems are able to meet the full range of translation needs on an enterprise scale. Download free Sample PDF report with TOC: http://www.researchmoz.us/enquiry.php?type=S&repid=228462 Systems are powered by hybrid machine translation (MT) engines. IT enterprise-level machine translation combines rules systems and statistical systems to achieve a hybrid solution. These are a “black-box solution” due to the complexity of the software implementation and resources needed to successful train an engine. Iterative software releases are evolving. They represent a goal executives want to reach. Iterative software releases allow larger vendors to compete with smaller, more nimble companies by making their feature function packages more robust. Meeting the Iterative software releases challenge depends on achieving an agile software development environment. Continuous localization represents automation of localization resource bundles. Implementing internationalization depends on best practice systems use at the engineering level and further down the production chain. The largest IT localization are approached by bridging the gap between development and reuse of existing code modules. Products are positioned to address challenges directly.

      "text": "Xiaomi Mi MIX includes Microsoft's Cortana assistant Xiaomi Mi MIX includes Microsoft's Cortana assistant Posted: Tags : Android - Android + Microsoft - Microsoft + Apps - Apps + Xiaomi - Xiaomi + It wouldn't be a stretch to say that Microsoft's mobile ventures have been less-than-successful over the past few years. But the Cortana assistant -- also baked into the wider Windows product line -- certainly holds its own verus Apple's Siri and Google Assistant. As part of Redmond's pact with Xiaomi, the much-hyped Mi MIX bundles Cortana as standard, along with several other recognized Microsoft utilities. In the run-up to Xiaomi's announcement event late in October, all eyes were on the Mi Note 2 . But the 6.4-inch ceramic Mi MIX comfortably stole the show with its truly unique design and high-end innards. Though it runs Xiaomi's MIUI atop Google's Android, there's plenty of Microsoft influence thrown into the bargain. As you may have heard, Xiaomi recently snagged a bunch of patents from Microsoft . A real boon for the Chinese firm's efforts to conquer the lucrative Western market, the deal also meant that select Microsoft apps would be pre-installed on Xiaomi handsets. With the Mi MIX now reaching early adopters after an epic flash sale , it seems that quite a lot of Redmond bloatware software is on board. Along with Cortana, owners get the main Office apps including Word, Excel, PowerPoint and Outlook. This isn't the first time Cortana has been rolled out to an Android smartphone -- the OnePlus One and OnePlus 2 also received the AI bundle earlier this year through a Cyanogen OS update. The Mi MIX is the first non-Windows handset to roll with Cortana out of the box, however. Prospective Mi MIX owners -- will you be taking advantage of Cortana et al? Let us know what you make of this in the comments. The Xiaomi Mi MIX",

      "text": "\nIt was a blog entry on Minimally Minimal a few years back that made Andrew Kim famous on the internet. His design project, “The Next Microsoft,” proposed a connected, futuristic approach for the company and its products. His design work inspired widespread discussion and debate, and was covered by several major tech blogs. After few weeks, Xbox Design Studio team hired him to work on its future projects. It was recently reavelaed that Kim was part of the design team that developed the new Xbox One S. \nKim posted on his website that the Xbox One S was a very significant project for him personally, as the team was tasked with making a gaming console that “[didn’t] evoke traditional ‘gaming’ cues,” – all the while maintaining the Windows 10 design language within the new hardware. They also managed to “[dramatically reduce] the size of the device and removed the bulky external power supply,” which is a feat in itself.\nThe bad news now is that Kim has left Microsoft. Most recently, he was working as a Senior Designer at HoloLens and New devices group. He has now joined Tesla as a Lead Designer.\n",

      "title": "Eve V, the first crowdsourced 2-in-1 takes on the Microsoft Surface Pro",
      "text": "Eve-Tech , a Finland-based startup, is taking on the Microsoft Surface Pro with its Eve V 2-in-1 Windows-powered laptop . Backed by Intel Corp., Microsoft Corp. and the Finnish government, Eve-Tech is currently raising funds for the device on Indiegogo Inc . \nMore and more manufacturers are designing 2-in-1 laptops to take on the ever-popular Microsoft Surface Pro, but what makes the Eve V stand out from its competitors is that it has been developed thanks to input from the crowd. Over 1,000 people from the eve.community collaborated online to determine the hardware specifications for the Eve V. \nAfter launching the Indiegogo campaign a few days ago, the Eve V smashed its initial goal of $75,000 in just four minutes. Since then it has become the fastest European campaign to reach $100,000. At the time of writing, the Eve V campaign had raised $926,516 or 1,235 percent of its initial goal. Thanks to funding from Intel, the Eve V is finished and functional, the company told Business Insider and funding raised during the campaign will cover manufacturing costs and handle preorders. \nIn addition to impressive hardware specifications and design, the Eve V also comes with a very appealing price tag. The Eve V is the company’s second piece of Windows hardware. In early 2015, the company introduced the budget-friendly T1 , an 8-inch Windows 8.1 tablet. \nHere’s a look at how the Eve V stacks up against the Surface Pro 4 and ASUS Transformer 3 Pro , which was launched in May. \nEve V vs. Microsoft Surface Pro 4 vs. ASUS Transformer 3 Pro: Top-of-the-range tech specs Eve V \nMicrosoft Surface Pro 4 ASUS Transformer 3 Pro \nDisplay 12.3-inch IGZO LCD, 2,736 x 1,824 resolution. Anti-reflection coating \n12.3-inch PixelTouch, 2,736 x 1,824 resolution at 267 ppi 12.6-inch , 2,880 x 1,920 at 275 ppi \nProcessor Intel 7th gen Core i7 \nIntel 6th gen Core i7 Intel 6th gen Core i7 \nRAM 16GB \n16GB 16GB \nStorage 512GB SSD \n512GB SSD 512GB SSD \nOperating system Windows 10 Pro or Home \nWindows 10 Pro Windows 10 Pro \nPorts 2x Full-size USB 3.1 Gen 1, a USB 3.1 Gen 1 USB-C, a Thunderbolt 3 USB-C, Thunderbolt 3, 3.5mm audio and a micro SDXC reader \nFull-size USB 3.0, microSD card reader, Headset jack, Mini DisplayPort, Cover port. SurfaceConnect USB Type-C connector, Thunderbolt 3 port, USB 3.0 and HDMI ports. \nBattery life (claimed) 10-12 hours \nUp to 9 hours Up to 9 hours \nAudio Quad speakers \nDual speakers Dual speakers \nFingerprint reader Yes, built into power button \nYes, built into Surface Pro 4 Type Cover ($160) Yes \nKeyboard Pogo-pin and wireless Bluetooth 4.2, connects up to 3 devices \nPogo-Pin folio keyboard Pogo-Pin folio keyboard \nPrice $1,399 \n$2,350 $1,850 \nDesign and display The Eve V has a 12.3-inch indium gallium zinc oxide (IGZO) LCD display with scratch and drop resistant Corning Gorilla Glass. Its display resolution of 2,736 x 1,824 puts it on par with the Surface Pro 4, but slightly below the Transformer Pro 3. \nThe Eve V is both slim, measuring just 0.89cm and lightweight, weighing less than one kilogram. It comes with a Pogo-pin keyboard, which also has wireless capabilities with the ability to connect up to three devices via Bluetooth 4.2. \n\nThe V Pen, sold at an additional cost, is Windows Ink certified and has 1,024 pressure levels, putting it on par with both the Surface and ASUS Pens. \nBoth the Surface Pro and Transformer Pro 3 come with dual speakers. The Eve V, on the other hand, comes with quad speakers as well as a dedicated amplifier on the headphone jack. \nThe Eve V also comes with a variety of ports, including two full-size USB 3.1 Gen 1, a USB 3.1 Gen 1 USB-C, and Thunderbolt 3 ports capable of transfer speeds of up to 40GB per second. \nCheck out the design and display of the Eve V in the video below. \n\nUnder the hood The Eve V packs in an Intel 7th gen Core i7 processor, m3 and i5 processors also available, up to 16GB of RAM and up to 512GB of storage. Eve-Tech guarantees a battery life of 12 hours. \nThe Eve V comes with either Windows 10 Home or Pro and is free of bloatware. \nPrice and availability \nThe top-of-the-range Eve V, with 7th gen Core i7 processor, 16GB of RAM and 512GB of storage will cost $1,399. The Eve V also comes in a Core m3 and i5 option, with the lower specced models starting at $699. The V Pen is available for $39. The premium Eve V is priced well below both the Surface Pro 4 and the Transformer 3 Pro. \nEarly backers of the Eve V Indiegogo campaign will receive their device in February 2017, while shipments for the rest of the backers will start in April. The Indiegogo campaign will still run for another month, so time will tell just how much will be raised before its ends. \nImages via Eve-Tech ",

      "text": "Microsoft’s Famous Solitaire Game Launches on Android and iOS GO Android and iOS users can now waste their time too Nov 24, 2016 08:51 GMT · By Bogdan Popa · Share: Solitaire is without a doubt one of the most popular games in history and it’s all because older versions of Windows launched with it built-in. Starting with Windows 8, however, Solitaire was no longer pre-installed in the operating system, and Microsoft instead switched focus to a modern version called Solitaire Collection that also featured additional games and features, such as Xbox Live support and achievements. And today, Microsoft officially launches Solitaire on a non-Windows platform for the very first time in history, as it’s looking to give more users the chance to play it wherever they are. Microsoft Solitaire Collection is now available for download on Android and iOS , and it comes with the same feature package as on Windows. You can play the typical games, including Spider, FreeCell, Pyramid, and Klondike, but also get achievements, daily challenges, and so much more. Premium Edition offered for free There’s also Xbox Live support should you want to log in and compete with friends, as well as a Premium edition that removes the ads and offers you a totally clean experience. Users who install the game these days receive one month of Premium Edition for free. “Congratulations on being one of the first to play Microsoft Solitaire Collection for Android/iOS!” the message displayed at first run reads. “To celebrate this event, we’re giving you 1 month of Premium Edition for free.” The offer ends December 31, 2016, so you have more than a month to install the game and see if the Premium edition is what you need or not. If you want to enjoy all the benefits of a Premium user without a time limit, you need to pay a $1.99 fee per month. Microsoft says that Solitaire currently has 119 million players on Windows 8 and Windows 10, and the number will undoubtedly grow substantially now that it’s available on Android and iOS.

      "text": "Microsoft Conquering More Android Phones as Xiaomi Installs Cortana on Mi MIX GO One more device to come with Microsoft apps pre-installed Nov 24, 2016 08:27 GMT · By Bogdan Popa · Share: Microsoft is very committed to its beyond-Windows expansion plans, and as part of its strategy, the software giant is trying to bring more of its apps on Android devices sold worldwide. As a result, the software giant signed licensing deals with an important number of Android device manufacturers, including market leader Samsung, so apps such as Skype, Word, or Outlook are available right out of the box on a growing number of phones. And it looks like the recently-released Xiaomi Mi MIX will join this group, as the Chinese company agreed to pre-install Cortana and offer its users Microsoft’s digital assistant as default. Xiaomi was already a Microsoft partner and its devices came pre-loaded with Microsoft software, but with today’s announcement, the company not only that includes the bezel-less Mi MIX into the deal, but it also expands it to cover Cortana. Cortana on Android Microsoft’s personal assistant arrived on Android last year and Xiaomi is only the second company that pre-installs it on its devices, after Cyanogen. Samsung and the other Android manufacturers working with Microsoft are sticking with apps like Skype and Office, and their agreements do not cover Cortana. Making its services available on rival platforms is part of Microsoft’s strategy of growing as a service company, with Windows boss Terry Myerson saying on several occasions that this can only be helpful to its customers using a different mobile platform. “Our company will be pragmatic and embrace other mobile platforms with our productivity services, device management services, and development tools - regardless of a person’s phone choice, we want everyone to be able to experience what Microsoft has to offer them,” he states. In return for installing its apps on Android devices, Microsoft is providing companies with access to some of its wireless patents, which themselves generate billions of dollars every year for the software giant.",

      "title": "Microsoft Agrees to Share Windows 10 Telemetry Data with Security Company",
      "text": "Microsoft Agrees to Share Windows 10 Telemetry Data with Security Company GO Microsoft and security firm FireEye sign partnership Nov 24, 2016 06:49 GMT · By Bogdan Popa · Share: ​Microsoft has recently signed a partnership with security firm FireEye to integrate the company’s iSIGHT Intelligence software in Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection and thus improve the security capabilities available on Windows 10 devices. But in addition to the obvious security benefits for Microsoft, it turns out that the Redmond-based software giant agreed to share Windows 10 telemetry data with FireEye, but information in this regard remains quite vague. Australian website ARN writes that “terms of the deal will see FireEye gain access to telemetry from every device running Windows 10,” as Microsoft collects crash information and other statistics from computers powered by its latest operating system. Telemetry sharing with third parties While sharing telemetry data with a third-party company is definitely worrying for users, the official press release that FireEye posted today says nothing about Microsoft providing them with access to information collected from Windows 10 systems, but only brags about the security technology that’s being adopted by the Redmond-based software giant. “FireEye has invested in nation-state grade intelligence and we are strategically partnering with industry leaders to operationalize this high-quality intel,” said Ken Gonzalez, senior vice president of corporate development at FireEye in a typical press release comment. “By working with Microsoft we're able to offer differentiated intelligence within WDATP and together help make organizations more secure.” Telemetry data collection in Windows 10 has always been a controversial topic for both Microsoft and users, but Redmond has always claimed that no personal information is transferred to its servers and the only thing the firm does is look into crash information and other usage patterns to improve the operating system. On the other hand, giving access to third parties to this data could help Microsoft improve security tools in Windows 10, although it goes without saying that many users would actually prefer this not to happen. We’ve reached out to Microsoft for more information on what telemetry sharing with FireEye actually means and will update the article when a statement is received.",

      "text": "Microsoft Survey Reveals Some Users Started Drinking Because of Computer Errors GO Redmond conducts new survey to show how important it is to have a new computer that performs flawlessly Nov 24, 2016 06:04 GMT · By Bogdan Popa · Share: ​ It goes without saying that the newer a computer, the faster it is, and this is what Microsoft tried to emphasize in a new survey, obviously with the final goal of convincing us to purchase new systems running Windows 10. The survey found that, on average, home computers are more than three years old and they take 65 percent longer to boot the operating system. Since they’re at least three years old, these systems were most likely launched with Windows 7, so they should still be able to run Windows 10 smoothly, but not without an impact on boot performance. But despite this, Microsoft says that old machines need overall 23.5 hours each year to boot, which means that you’re losing nearly one day per year starring at the monitor and waiting to see the desktop. Microsoft says that owners of old computers spend three and a half times longer than users of new PCs to repair system problems, including malware or other errors. 6 percent of the users started crying And here’s where the fun part begins. According to the survey, 65 percent of those with a computer whose age is between 5 and 10 years admitted to hitting or shouting at the computer due to errors, while some ended up doing even more extreme things. Six percent claimed they started crying or even drinking because of the problems they were experiencing with their PCs. Last but not least, the Microsoft survey reveals that those who aren’t yet using new PCs are not aware how much they can get by giving up on old hardware, as 42 percent of the respondents claimed it’s not yet possible to control a computer with voice commands - this thing is already possible in Windows 10 thanks to personal assistant Cortana. Leaving aside Microsoft’s final goal with this survey, the findings are very likely to be accurate, especially when it comes to the frustration that system errors are causing to owners. Of course, it doesn’t mean that if you move to Windows 10 all of these are gone, but the chances of getting a BSOD or a critical error are significantly lower.",

      "title": "Transformer 3 Pro quick review: Asus attempts to kill Microsoft Surface Pro 4 : Features, News - India Today",
      "text": "Last Updated: NOV 24, 2016 New Delhi Email Author \nMicrosoft's Surface-range of productivity tablets, that when connected with a keyboard accessory, become full-blown Windows PCs have redefined the 2-in-1 category. There's simply no beating the Surface, so they say. Slowly and gradually, others including Apple have joined the bandwagon. So, why should Asus, a company that has a history in laptops and mother boards, stay behind? To counter the Surface, or more precisely the new Surface Pro 4, Asus has come up with its own version of the 2-in-1 convertible. Asus calls it the Transformer 3 Pro, and it's every bit as futuristic as its naming convention: in design and in specs. Also Read: Asus Zenbook 3 review: A perfect Windows alternative to MacBook \nAsus has also priced it, at upwards of Rs 1 lakh, to ensure you have little doubt what it is gunning for. The Microsoft Surface Pro 4 of course. Here's a closer look. The Transformer 3 Pro takes major design cues from the Surface, but then, it is primarily a tablet and frankly speaking there's very little that you can do around a tablet form factor - design per se -- any ways. Microsoft has the advantage of being there first, but, that doesn't mean others can't innovate. Samsung has, so has Huawei but at the cost of some compromise here and there. Asus has meanwhile played it safe. The design isn't the most original, and looks a lot like the Surface, but at least Asus has tried to cut short on compromises. Asus hasn't tried to make the Transformer 3 Pro slim or sleek, but functional therefore many (especially who have tried out the Surface) would say, it is a little thick and a little bulky. The Surface Pro 4 is a lot compact in comparison, but that is because Microsoft has been working on the Surface for a while now. Slowly and gradually, it is reaching perfection. The Transformer 3 Pro is Asus' first attempt at a 2-in-1. Still, Asus could have at least added a little more grip on the edges because a 2-in-1 is supposed to face some wear and tear since it would spend a considerable time of its life being a portable laptop. Sharp corners and edges will be prone to wear and tear, over time. Just like the Surface, the Transformer 3 Pro has an adjustable kickstand on the back that can be adjusted to a maximum of 155 degrees. There's a hollow groove that lies in the middle of it, so it's convenient to pull the kickstand out and about at all times. Asus includes a keyboard accessory and a stylus inside the box, which is very generous of it, as Microsoft doesn't offer a keyboard with any version of the Surface and also does not give you a stylus with the base version. The Transformer 3 Pro's keyboard accessory is made out of plastic and offers decent feedback, although just like in the Zenbook 3, typing can feel a little wonky on Asus' convertible as well. The stylus, that its calls the Asus Pen, meanwhile offers up to 1024 levels of pressure sensitivity. Asus, as mentioned earlier hasn't compromised much on functionality. The Transformer 3 pro comes with a headphone jack, a microSD card-reader, a full-size USB 3.0 slot, a full-size HDMI connector and a Thunderbolt 3 port. It sports a 13-megapixel camera on the rear and a 2-megapixel camera on the front. The Transformer 3 Pro comes with a 12.6-inch diagonal (IPS touchscreen) display with a 3:2 aspect ratio and 2880x1920 pixel resolution. Although the colours look good, the screen of the Transformer isn't the brightest in town. It's just about adequate making sunlight legibility a bit challenging on the device. The top-end Transformer 3 Pro is powered by an Intel Core i7-6500U processor with 16 GB of DDR3 RAM and a 512 GB NVMe SSD. It is not a fan-less design, and therefore is prone to some noise especially when you push it to the edge. Since the exhaust vent is located up top (in landscape mode, when you're using it as a laptop) you're more likely to hear a little more noise than the usual. But, this sort of placement also means that you're less likely to feel the heat dissipation when you're using it as a convertible. The 2-in-1 is backed by a 39 Wh battery and offers average at best battery life. The Asus Transformer 3 Pro starts at Rs 1,10,990 and goes all the way up to Rs 1,44,990. It costs a little less than the Surface Pro 4, at least the top-end variant does, and tries to provide similar functionality. You get full-blown Windows 10 and all its nuggets straight out-of-the-box. More on the Transformer 3 Pro in our full review. \nAlso Read: Microsoft Surface Pro 4 review: In a class of its own For more news from India Today, follow us on Twitter @IndiaTodayTech and on Facebook at facebook.com/indiatodaytech For news and videos in Hindi, go to AajTak.in .ताज़ातरीन ख़बरों और वीडियो के लिए आजतक.इन पर आएं.

The software giant originally planned to ship units to customers in mid-December, but Microsoft has been emailing the first people to preorder the $3,000 device, letting them know the Studio will arrive this week. Microsoft is still accepting “preorders” for the Surface Studio, but new devices won’t ship until “ early 2017 .” Thurrott.com Alongside the shipments, Thurrott.com reports that Microsoft has even setup a dedicated support line for Surface Studio owners. A phone line has been created, alongside a personal note from Panos Panay, head of Surface devices, asking customers to call a special number for questions, comments, or concerns. Microsoft is also shipping a little booklet in the Surface Studio packaging, thanking customers for spending $3,000 or more on the all-in-one PC.",

      "text": "0 0 \nAfter a long and tiring run, Microsoft finally retired Internet Explorer from the PC browser game and replaced it with the new and fresh Microsoft Edge. While Microsoft Edge does have its strong points such as security, where it has been deemed superior to all competitors by experts in the field, the browser has still been found lacking overall. This has led people to lean on more consecrated browser solutions such as Firefox, Opera, and everyone’s favorite, Google Chrome. \nFor this reason, Microsoft has taken its browser marketing into the 4K spectrum. The tech icon partnered with Netflix to provide 4K quality content for Netflix subscribers. Actually, Netlfix will be providing all the 4K content, as long as you have a Netflix subscription and use Microsoft Edge as your browser. It has been specified that 4K is only available on Netflix for Edge users, making it an exclusive feature. \nNetflix users will also have to meet hardware requirements. Even though they are eligible through using Netflix on Edge, they cannot use the 4K feature if they don’t have the specs to run it. The 4K technology requires the latest i7 generation chipset and a display that supports it. \nIn hopes of luring in more customers, Microsoft has also launched a couple of subtle attacks at Google Chrome saying that users will benefit from a longer battery life on their device by using Microsoft Edge instead of Google’s browsing solution. \nWhether or not Microsoft finds success with this 4K campaign is to be seen as Edge continues to trail in market share. Currently, the Internet Explorer replacement holds no more than 5.26% of market shares, meaning that people aren’t nearly as impressed by security as much as they are by pretty much any other aspect that makes for a good browser. \nRELATED STORIES TO CHECK OUT:",

      "text": "\nMicrosoft yesterday announce the new auto-shutdown feature for VMs using Azure Resource Manager. With this new feature, you can set any ARM-based Virtual Machines to auto-shutdown with a few clicks.\nIn the past months, we’ve been very happy to see that auto-shutdown is the #1 policy used by our customers. On the other hand, we also learned from quite a few customers that they have their centrally managed Dev/Test workloads already running in Azure and simply want to set auto-shutdown for those VMs. Since those workloads have already been provisioned and managed centrally, self-service is not really needed. It’s a little bit overkill for them to create a DevTest lab in this case just for the auto-shutdown settings. That’s why we make this popular feature, VM auto-shutdown, available to all the ARM-based Azure VMs.\nFollowing the steps below to enable this feature,\nGo to your VM blade in Azure portal. Click Auto-shutdown in the resource menu on the left-side. You will see an auto-shutdown settings page expanded, where you can specify the auto-shutdown time and time zone. You can also configure to send notification to your webhook URL 15 minutes before auto-shutdown. ",

      "text": "Microsoft's Chinese chatbot won't talk about Tiananmen or Xi Jinping by Sherisse Pham @CNNTech November 24, 2016: 6:32 AM ET \"If you like me, why would you talk like this to me?\" \nAsk Microsoft's Chinese chatbot Xiaoice about Tibetan spiritual leader the Dalai Lama and that's how she responds. She also skirts around highly sensitive topics like the 1989 crackdown on Tiananmen Square protests, Chinese President Xi Jinping or even President-elect Donald Trump. \nXiaoice has become hugely popular since she was introduced in 2014. More than 40 million Chinese smartphone users chat with her on the social media platforms WeChat or Weibo every day, according to Microsoft ( MSFT , Tech30 ) . A quarter of them have declared their love for her. \nRelated: After racist tweets, Microsoft muzzles teen chatbot Tay \nCompanies use chatbots to connect with consumers and promote their brands. Chinese often use Xiaoice simply to have something resembling a real conversation with a close friend. \nXiaoice is an experiment in artificial intelligence. She mines Chinese websites to gather material for conversations. She can glean vital context from voice messages and images. If you send her a photo of a pop star, for example, she might respond by saying how much she likes the singer's music. \nRefusing to talk about sensitive topics suggests Xiaoice has been programmed to avoid prohibited words when asked about them. Microsoft declined to comment. \nChina pours incredible resources into patrolling the internet, tracking down prohibited content and unwanted posts with an army of more than two million censors . \nRelated: Facebook could pay heavy price if it censors news to please China \nTo get around them, Chinese bloggers and dissidents get creative. Instead of writing Tiananmen, online users instead reference the date of the massacre -- June 4, 1989 -- often simply writing 64 or 8964. \nXi Jinping is called Xi Baozi, or Steamed Bun Xi, a nickname he earned after a publicity stunt where he bought steamed pork buns at a small store in Beijing and carried his own food tray. \nBut censors eventually figure out new phrases and nicknames and restrict them online. \nChina Digital Times recently reported the growing attention to Xiaoice's evasive answers, highlighting tweets from Chinese dissidents like Su Yutong, who lives in Germany. Su tried several banned topics with Xiaoice, posting screengrabs of conversations like the one below on Twitter : \nCNNMoney also had a go. We asked Xiaoice about China's president: \nAnd then we name dropped President-elect Donald Trump, and asked her about Tiananmen Square : \nTech giants such as Facebook ( FB , Tech30 ) , Twitter ( TWTR , Tech30 ) and Google ( GOOGL , Tech30 ) are blocked in China, in part because the government fears open discussions about the very topics Xiaoice refuses to acknowledge. \nAmnesty International has documented a marked uptick in censorship in China over the past year, including an increase in controls on social media. \nRelated: China holds 'World Internet Conference' as censorship intensifies \nMicrosoft still operates in China, and has been criticized in the past for complying with the country's strict policing of the Internet. \nIf Microsoft has programmed Xiaoice to sidestep sensitive topics, it indicates a worrisome trend, said Patrick Poon, an Amnesty researcher. Earlier this week, Facebook was reported to have built a censorship tool to get into China . \n\"They are legitimizing what the Chinese government is doing, which is convincing foreign tech companies to suppress freedom of speech,\" Poon said. \n-- Tim Schwarz and Serena Dong contributed this story.

      "text": "0 Comments Microsoft hit the headlines this week when it promised to link executive bonuses to workforce diversity goals after seeing the number of women it employs fall for a second consecutive year. The percentage of females working at the software vendor dropped to 25.8% of its total labour force from 26.8% as of 30 September, mainly as a result of selling its Nokia handset factories, which employed large numbers of women. On a more positive note though, Gwen Houston, the vendor’s chief diversity and inclusion officer, also told the Bloomberg newswire that females accounted for 27.7% of its total new hires this year, and 21.1% of its recruits for technical roles. Like many employers in the industry who are keen to win the war for tech talent, chief executive (CEO) Satya Nadella has made diversity a key priority for the company – albeit it after a rocky start. A couple of years ago at the Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing event, he advised females uncomfortable about asking for a pay rise to have “faith that the system will actually give you the right raises as you go along”. Moreover, Nadella added, not asking for a pay increase would, in fact, be “good karma” that would help bosses see that they could be trusted and should be given more responsibility. The comments unsurprisingly, provoked a Twitter-storm, which led Nadella to email all of his employees saying that he had “answered the question completely wrong”. Instead he believed that “men and women should get equal pay for equal work” and that “if you think you deserve a raise, you should just ask”. But the tech gender pay gap issue still continues to rumble on, no matter which side of the Atlantic you happen to be based. According to a study by global HR consultancy Mercer, at 25%, the pay gap in the UK’s high tech sector is significantly higher than the national average of 18%. The tech gender pay gap After analysing the situation of 66,000 employees in 153 companies, the company found that the problem was worst among small firms, where the difference in median wages between male and female employees stood at 30%, and the gap between mean base salaries was 26%. The differential does lessen the larger a company becomes, however. Interestingly, the highest pay gap based on roles was found among women professionals, who are paid 19% less than their male counterparts. Support staff receive about the same though, with females earning only around 2% less than males. There is also little variation in the average pay gap across departments – apart from sales and marketing, where the differential stands at a huge 32%. But on the discretionary pay side of the equation, which includes bonuses, women obtain a significant 20% less than men – even though roughly the same percentage of both genders are rated as top performers. Chris Charman, Mercer’s reward expert, says: To narrow the gap, it is not enough for companies to be equal pay-compliant. They also need to develop and support a healthy pipeline of women being promoted up through the organisation. Many high-tech companies are working hard to ensure women are given equal career opportunities. However, the pay gap is perpetuated by the lack of female candidates available for professional industry roles. This is a reflection of an imbalance in the wider society, where only 16% of technology and science students are female, and 14.4% of the UK STEM [Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics] workforce is female. But another non-tech-specific study also threw up a number of noteworthy findings too. The 2016 UK Board Index , published by executive search and leadership consulting firm Spencer Stuart, revealed that organisations with a woman CEO or chairman employed an average of 26% more female directors than would otherwise be the case. Executive committees in firms with female CEOs also comprised about 35.4% women. But across the UK’s top 150 public companies as a whole, females made up on average only 30% of non-executive directors compared with a mere 8% of executive ones – a situation that would appear to indicate that appointing women to boards has to date made little impact on gender imbalances at the senior management level. So it is perhaps unsurprising that as few as 22% of UK firms are female-owned compared with about a third in the US. According to a survey of 1,919 of the Federation of Small Businesses’ (FSB) female members, the situation is not necessarily through lack of desire to set their own company up though. Untapped female potential The organisation’s report entitled Women in Enterprise – the Untapped Potential indicates that there are about 2.7 million women in the UK who would like to establish their own business, but are being held back due to a range of barriers including a perceived lack of skills. But the research also found that helping to overcome such issues could create as many as 340,000 jobs and add a huge £10.1 billion to the domestic economy. Other issues that women face, meanwhile, is that they rarely set up their businesses in industries with potential for high growth such as tech. Instead, they tend to focus on service sectors such as health or social work, of which they have more experience. But many women also find it more difficult to balance home and work life due to issues such as childcare and usually have more limited access to funding than their male counterparts. Helen Walbey, the FSB’s national policy chair for health and diversity, told the audience at the recent WeConnect International Europe conference on supplier diversity: Women generally start with about a third less capital than men, which impacts on their ability to grow and invest in equipment so they lag behind. Women are also more risk-averse as they often have to manage not only the work but the home finances too. They usually have well-thought out business plans though, so much so that Barclays Bank told us they consider women as less of a risk. But women also tend to use single sources of finance and their awareness of alternatives like angel funding and crowdsourcing is low. Another thing that also does not help matters, however, is the nationwide lack of gender-disaggregated business ownership data. Walbey explained: It’s a problem. We’re going on estimates as to what the barriers are and what targeted policy interventions we think the government should make. But there could be an opportunity to collect this kind of data perhaps via VAT returns or via reports to Companies House. This would mean we could measure things more effectively, which would make them easier to act on. My take Despite all the work that is being undertaken by so many tech companies around increasing gender diversity, there still seem to be mountains to climb. But given the old adage that people tend to hire in their own image, the more women who can be encouraged to set up tech/digital companies, the more females they are likely to employ. These women should, in turn, act as positive role models for the next generation coming through, hopefully serving to create a virtuous circle. \nImage credit - Freeimages.com",

      "text": "Twitter \nOffice 365 is the evolution of Microsoft’s productivity suite. It unites the legendary Office software package 20 Historical Microsoft Office Facts You Forgot Or Never Knew 20 Historical Microsoft Office Facts You Forgot Or Never Knew The Microsoft Office suite turned 25 this year. The world has changed since digital presentations, word processing, and spreadsheets became a thing. Do you remember how it all began? Read More with an attractive online suite. This product lets you create a document in Microsoft Word, sync it to OneDrive, and open that same document in Word Online in any web browser. \nRight now, no other office suite offers the same online and offline integration. It’s what makes Office 365 worth its subscription price An Introduction to Office 365 -- Should You Buy Into the New Office Business Model? An Introduction to Office 365 -- Should You Buy Into the New Office Business Model? Office 365 is a subscription based package that offers access to the latest desktop Office suite, Office Online, cloud storage, and premium mobile apps. Does Office 365 provide enough value to be worth the money? Read More of $100 per year. Plus, given its advanced features, it’s indispensable for professionals worldwide. \nIf you want to step out of Microsoft’s shadow, however, or simply don’t want to pay, you can choose from excellent free and low-cost offline alternatives to Office . Here’s we’ll have a look at the online alternatives for Office 365. 1. Google Docs, Sheets, and Slides \nIf you’re comparing Office Online with Google’s online office suite, there’s plenty in Google’s favor. For example, unique features like using your voice to type! \nMoreover, Google Docs is better than Microsoft Word for research writing Google Docs vs. Microsoft Word: The Death Match for Research Writing Google Docs vs. Microsoft Word: The Death Match for Research Writing Online solutions are becoming the norm. We decided to see how Microsoft Word stacks up against Google Docs. Which one will do the better research paper? Read More . But Microsoft Excel remains the king of spreadsheet software, despite Sheet’s “Explore” feature . Slides and PowerPoint are neck-and-neck to create presentations. So the decision to use Google or Microsoft is about what you use more: word processing or spreadsheets, respectively. \nThat said, Google’s office suite doesn’t work well without the internet. While you can technically use Google Docs offline How to Use Google Docs or Drive Offline on PC & Mobile How to Use Google Docs or Drive Offline on PC & Mobile The downside to cloud-based services and apps is that you always need to be online to use them. We show you how to take Google Drive offline & what to keep in mind. Read More by installing Google Drive, it’s clunky software. \nActually, you can have the best of both worlds. You can use Office when without the internet, and go online with those files in Google Docs. It’s all possible with the official Google Drive plug-in for Microsoft Office This Easy Plugin Integrates Google Drive Into Microsoft Office This Easy Plugin Integrates Google Drive Into Microsoft Office Wish you could access Google Drive from right inside Microsoft Office? Here's a quick plugin that makes that possible. Read More . \nThe one problem is that Google Drive will actively convert the files to Google’s own formats. The changes are minute, but it’s an inconvenience nonetheless. 2. Open365 \nOpen365 is the new darling of the tech world. It’s based on the excellent LibreOffice, a free open-source Micorosft Office alternative Is the New LibreOffice a Better Microsoft Office Alternative? Is the New LibreOffice a Better Microsoft Office Alternative? LibreOffice, a long-time contender of Microsoft Office, just received a makeover and important updates. After being held back by niggling bugs over the years, has LibreOffice finally found the winning formula? Read More . And using Open365 is like using LibreOffice in a web browser. \nSince Open365 is basically the full program running in the cloud, you get a lot more than what any other online office suite offers. Microsoft’s Office Online has stripped some features from its full-fledged offline suite. You won’t have any such problems with Open365 and LibreOffice. \nThe only gripe with Open365 is the lack of a simple plug-in for LibreOffice to sync files. In fact, there’s a separate Open365 sync client. The seamless marriage that Microsoft creates with Office 365 is missing here. And that’s actually a big problem. \nIn terms of convenience for everyday usage, Office 365 and even Google Drive seem better options at the moment. \nNote: Open365 says it is in beta, and the beta will close on October 31, 2016. At the time of writing this article, even though it was well past the date, Open365 was working perfectly. 3. Zoho Office \nZoho is the most polished interface among all the online office suites. The company has been around for over a decade and predates both Google Docs and Office Online. It’s no wonder that they make some of the best-looking products. \nZoho impressed us with their most recent offering.

It also focuses on collaboration, with emphasis on chats, simultaneous editing, and other team-based features. If you want to stop giving information to Google Android Users: How to Stop Giving so Much Personal Information to Google Android Users: How to Stop Giving so Much Personal Information to Google Android users, by default, give Google a lot of information. Here's how to get out of that trap. Read More , Zoho Office is perhaps your best option. \nFinally, Zoho is completely compatible with Office files, unlike Google Docs and Open365. 4. iWork for iCloud \nOne of Apple’s best-kept secrets is that its iWork suite of office apps is now available for free to anyone in the world. You don’t need to own an Apple device. All you need is an Apple ID. And we already know that anyone can create an Apple ID . \nNow, this cloud-based software is going to work best on a Mac with iWork How the New iWork for iCloud Works With Your Apple Devices How the New iWork for iCloud Works With Your Apple Devices iWork for iCloud is a suite of online office applications (consisting of Pages, Keynote, and Numbers) that sync with the Mac and iOS versions of the programs.

Read More is how well it works with Microsoft Office files. The formatting stays intact, and Apple’s fonts actually make the whole thing look better. \nAll that said, iWork is only good for basic office suite uses. If you create complicated Excel spreadsheets or want to write a paper for school that requires plenty of research, you’re better off with one of the other alternatives here. What Do You Use? \nAll said and done, let’s not forget that with the online suite, you can use Microsoft Office without paying for it 6 Ways You Can Use Microsoft Office Without Paying For It 6 Ways You Can Use Microsoft Office Without Paying For It Read More . That’s a big plus. Plus, some students can get Office 365 for free Students Can Get Microsoft Office 365 for Free Students Can Get Microsoft Office 365 for Free Starting on December 1st, Universities that license Office Education for their faculty and staff can offer students Office 365 ProPlus for free.

      "text": "Microsoft is ramping up its quantum computing ambitions by hiring a number of experts in the field.\nThe new appointments include that of long-time Microsoft executive Todd Homdahl, who will be charged with leading the company’s quantum computing division. In addition, the Redmond-based company has hired two renowned quantum computing experts in the shape of Leo Kouwenhoven and Charles Marcus. Microsoft is also planning to hire two other leaders in the field, Matthia Troyer and David Reilly.\nIn a blog post , Microsoft said its new hires will work to build both a working quantum computer and also software that’s able to run on it. The announcements come just months after Microsoft founder Bill Gates made public his belief that quantum cloud computing could arrive in as little as six years.\n“Microsoft’s approach to building a quantum computer is based on a type of qubit – or unit of quantum information – called a topological qubit,” the company said in its blog post. “Using qubits, researchers believe that quantum computers could very quickly process multiple solutions to a problem at the same time, rather than sequentially.”\nMicrosoft’s ultimate aim is to create reliable tools that can be used by scientists with a quantum background to solve some of the most difficult problems in the world. By solving those kinds of problems, scientists would be able to “revolutionize industries such as medicine and materials science,” the company claims.\nTodd Homdahl, who will head up Microsoft’s new quantum computing team, previously worked on the development of the Xbox console, Kinect and HoloLens, among other projects. Meanwhile, Leo Kouwenhoven and Charles Marcus are both experienced academic researchers who have been been collaborating with the company’s quantum computing research team for several years.\nMicrosoft also said it will provide additional funds for an increased share of topological qubit research in their labs.\nIn a statement, Marcus said that a quantum economy will never be realized unless there is greater cooperation between scientists and engineers.\n“I knew that to get over the hump and get to the point where you started to be able to create machines that have never existed before, it was necessary to change the way we did business,” Marcus said in a statement. “We need scientists, engineers of all sorts, technicians, programmers, all working on the same team.”\nImage: Microsoft’s new quantum computing chief Todd Homdahl ",
