      "title": "Resident Evil 7 Will Support Cross-Play If Purchased Through Microsoft",
      "text": "Resident Evil 7 Will Support Cross-Play If Purchased Through Microsoft about 12 hours | 1 comment | By Josh Brown \nIf you're looking to scare yourself silly in more than a single room on one machine when Resident Evil 7 launches in January, rest assured that's an absolute possibility as Capcom's upcoming survival horror title will support cross-save between Xbox One and Windows 10 PC. \nThough details were initially scarce as to how this feature would work, Capcom has since confirmed that Resident Evil 7 would only gain this feature when purchased through the Windows 10 store; meaning we could be looking at the first third-party game to support Microsoft's 'Play Anywhere' program like Gears of War 4 and Forza Horizon 3 did before. \nGiving a little more reason to pick up the title from a rival store, those with an Xbox One would gain access to both the console and PC versions of the title when purchasing it digitally through either the Windows 10 store or Xbox Live Marketplace. Meaning you could essentially walk between the rooms of your house while navigating the spooky cabin of the game itself - for whatever reason. \nUnlike the Playstation 4 version, the PC version of Resident Evil 7 won't include VR support - but you could lightely emulate it yourself . \nAlso revealed through IGN's translation of the original Dengeki article, the title will also support HDR and true 4K resolution support for those aiming to have the truest-looking Baker-house romp imaginable. \nThere's still a Steam version up for pre-order, though; so we're not being locked into supporting Microsoft's solo venture like the early release of Quantum Break or Gears of War 4. It just won't support any form of cross-save or give you access to the Xbox One version.",

The company has remained tight-lipped since then, but in a November 24 update of the KB page, Microsoft explains that it’s indeed aware of some installation issues on Lenovo systems that could cause devices to no longer boot. Microsoft explains than an UEFI update was released by Lenovo in order to address these problems caused by the cumulative update and says that users of the affective devices need to install it before anything else. “Some Lenovo servers do not start after this update is installed...",

      "text": "  \n(Microsoft) The expected follow-up to the Microsoft Lumia 950 (shown), the rumored Microsoft Surface Phone, may be released late next year \nMicrosoft's Surface Phone seems more like a concept than an actual device at this point in time, though recent rumors are hinting that the development process may already be ongoing. \nFirst off, an earlier report from ZDNet indicated that Microsoft's new smartphone may be set to make its debut next year. \nSpecifically, the report noted that the rumored smartphone may show up either late next year or sometime in 2018. \nMore recently, a report from Nokia Power User again talked about the new Microsoft smartphone, and it also mentioned a possible release date for it. Advertisement \nSources spoken to by the website mentioned that it could be launched sometime late next year. \nA late 2017 arrival for the Surface Phone is probably somewhat disappointing for people who have been waiting to see this new device show up for a long time, but it's still better than the rumored smartphone being scrapped altogether, which seemed like a genuine possibility for a while. \nAside from revealing a potential release date for Microsoft's new smartphone, the Nokia Power User report also talked about some of the device's possible specs and features. \nThe report noted that two different Surface Phone prototypes are already in testing, with one carrying 4GB of RAM and the other featuring 6GB. The new prototypes also reportedly feature the Snapdragon 835 processor. \nConsidering that this device isn't expected to come out for about another year, there's a chance that the specs featured by the prototypes may still be tweaked. \nInterestingly, the rumored late 2017 launch for the new smartphone also appears to have made an impact already, as the report noted that it will come out with a Redstone 3-based version of the Windows 10 mobile OS. Previous rumors hinted that the new smartphone would be released with the Redstone 2 version of the Windows 10 OS onboard, but the additional development time could allow for the inclusion of new software. \nMore details about Microsoft's Surface Phone should be made available soon.

      "title": "How Microsoft's Jim Hanna got the job",
      "text": "Getty Images Stephen Brashear Jim Hanna and the MIcrosoft campus in Redmond, Washington. \nThis is the second article in an ongoing column where I talk with sustainability professionals to learn how they got their job. One of the questions I often get from job seekers is whether it’s possible to change industries when looking for a new sustainability position. \nThis interview with Microsoft’s Jim Hanna, director of Data Center Sustainability, and Rob Bernard, Microsoft's chief Environmental and Cities strategist, proves that not only can you change industries, but you can change the focus of the work you’ll be doing. I caught up with Jim, who was previously the director of environmental sustainability at Starbucks, over the phone to discuss his experiences working at an iconic coffee company can be translated to the operations of another Seattle icon. The following has been edited for length and clarity. \nJohn Davies : What was the job spec you posted and what kind of skills were you looking for? \nRob Bernard : As GreenBiz reported , sustainability has been elevated at Microsoft, both to the C-suite and across the company. As a company, we are increasingly thinking about sustainability across all our operations, particularly in our data centers as we continue to grow our cloud offering. \nThat’s why this position was created. We were looking for somebody who could create and execute a vision for taking sustainability in our data centers to the next level. We needed an individual that could help us take a holistic view of sustainability and especially in the context of our global data center footprint. \nDavies : That’s understandable, but I remember when Jim first told me about this and I told him he certainly didn’t seem like an obvious candidate for the job. Why was he a good fit for the role and to be a part of your team? \nRob Bernard, c hief Environmental and Cities strategist, Microsoft \nBernard : We were looking for somebody who has a history of transforming and making significant impact at a multinational corporation. That means someone who understands that what you do in Ireland may not be the same thing you do in Texas, which is not the same thing you need to do in Japan, and so on, to address sustainability. \nWe needed somebody who has a global view, who understands how to operate in large corporations, understands the domain of sustainability and understands how to drive and implement the strategy. Those are the attributes we were looking for and were more important than expertise in tech or data centers. When you take the term \"data center’\"out of it and look at Jim’s background and experience, it was a really powerful match. \nDavies: Was it a clear match in your mind, Jim? Why was this interesting to you? \nHanna: The moment and challenge were particularly intriguing. Microsoft is at a very exciting moment in time, where it’s thinking about how to address this huge challenge of building and operating data centers in a sustainable way. These operations will require significant amounts of energy and also touch on issues of land and water use. These are global issues, but also very local issues. So it was clear to me that this role would be an opportunity to drive change in a meaningful way. \nI really believe the role of the sustainability professional can be transformative. At Starbucks, my role was to take a global view and a global vision of how a multinational company fits into this space and leads — not just in operations but how to drive change at scale. As I’ve moved forward in my career, my goal has always been to take on new roles that allow me to drive change at a greater scale and make a difference. This job at Microsoft at this time definitely gives me that opportunity. \nAs I’ve moved forward in my career, my goal has always been to take on new roles that allow me to drive change at a greater scale and make a difference. \nDavies: I agree the scale of impact at Microsoft could be significant. But what specific skills are going to help you get to that scale when it comes to data centers? \nHanna: It was definitely a very different platform for me at first. But the skills I’ve developed over the years still apply here, even though its data centers instead of coffee farms. For example, one of the challenges the technology industry faces is translating a very complex message to a broader audience. \nMy experience at Starbucks has made me a pretty effective translator of complex sustainability initiatives around green buildings, supply chain, energy, and all the things that were important to that company. And it turns out that all those things are also important to Microsoft, and part of this role. \nDavies: Let’s get back to the hiring process, Rob. How did you go out looking for candidates? \nBernard: The sustainability community is small, especially in Seattle, so I already knew Jim and the talent that he had. But we had a lot of great applicants that learned of the position via the job posting and through our professional networks. \nDavies: What was the interview process like? \nJim: The interview process told me a lot about the expectations for the role and how the company was approaching sustainability. One of the things that struck me early in the process was how diverse the roles were of people interviewing me. They were from all over the business, from law and corporate affairs, to the civil and mechanical engineers on the data center construction team, to software engineers and everyone in between. \nThe message I heard from all of them was that the company was committed to sustainability and that the new position, located directly in the business, reflected an understanding of the importance of sustainability to the data center space. And a lot of times, you don’t hear that from individuals who are outside the direct team working on sustainability. \nDavies: What helped you make the final decision? \nBernard: There were a lot of variables and people involved in the final decision. For me, the big factor was Jim’s ability to bring in a broad perspective beyond the tech industry helped differentiate him. It’s valuable to bring in somebody with a different set of domain experiences. That’s educational for us. I think that was one of the key differentiators. \nDavies: What advice do you have for people looking for a job in sustainability? \nBernard: I tell people to find sustainability opportunities where they are. Don’t think about sustainability only in a narrow set of roles with that title attached in a limited number of organizations and corporations. Keep looking for ways to make an impact. \nI talk with people about this often, and each time ask them what their role is now. And 99 times out of 100, there is significant opportunity in their day-to-day jobs. If you’re a tester in a software company and you want to get into sustainability, go write a test for energy efficiency. \nEverywhere around you, there is an opportunity for resource efficiency. So find it where you are. You don’t have to wait for a single moment in time, or the lead role, in order to have a significant impact. \nI tell people to follow their passion, whatever it is. Don’t under-estimate the learning value from things that you think aren’t related. \nDavies: I recently spoke at the Net Impact conference about getting a job in sustainability. What’s your advice for future college graduates? \nHanna: The best way to position yourself is to get a degree that’s going to be critically important to the part of the business you are most interested in, whether that’s in an operations role or a supply chain role, a design role, or a software engineering role. Then execute on that passion for sustainability within the business. There are more opportunities for people to make a difference in that type of role than there are in holding out for a sustainability office role or a sustainability program manager role. \nAnd in terms of degree programs, I’ve seen many programs out there offering a dual major of a traditional business function along with a sustainability major. Those are the ones that are really preparing people to have both a traditional business skill and also understand the business drivers for executing and investing in sustainability. \nBernard: I tell people to follow their passion, whatever it is. Don’t under-estimate the learning value from things that you think aren’t related. I was in real estate development right out of college. And if someone had told me that being in real estate development was going to help you end up in a sustainability role at a high-tech company, I wouldn’t have made that connection. \nBut I draw on that experience all the time when we talk about energy efficient buildings and how buildings operate. So to Jim’s point, it’s a journey, so don’t think it’s about a destination. It’s about what you learn at each stop along the journey that makes that next step an opportunity to be more impactful.

      "title": "Microsoft SQL Server: Estimated vs. Actual Execution Plans",
      "text": "Posted November 27, 2016 by Vishwanath Dalvi in Computer programming , Database , SQL Server \nLet’s assume you are constructing a new house, and you have a contract with a builder. After thoughtful examination of the area, height, materials needed, etc., he estimates it will take 120 days to build a new home. After constructing a new home it actually took 200 days to built it. \nThere is a difference between his estimation and the actual result. This applies to query execution plans in SQL server as well, specifically Estimated vs. Actual execution plans. \nThis tutorial contains an Estimated execution plan as well as an Actual execution plan in SQL Server. \nEstimated vs. Actual Execution Plans: What is an execution plan? \nThe execution plan is a query optimizer’s attempt to find the least cost-effective and efficient way to execute a T-SQL query. To produce an execution plan, SQL server uses different algorithms, statistics, permutations, and combinations of joins and indexes to generate an efficient execution plan for a query. \nThe query optimizer always tries to generate an execution plan which will help to execute the query faster with less CPU and I/O utilization. \nIt can show that a table is performing a table scan because of a missing index. To start with performance problems, most of the time we need to look at the execution plan to get a general idea about where the query is lagging behind. \nEstimated Execution Plan \n1. An estimated execution plan is generated without actually executing the query. It is based on available statistics on indexes. \n2. Estimated execution plans are output from the query optimizer. Hence, it is considered as a logical plan. \n3. The estimated execution plan is always the same as the actual execution plan, but it can differ due to statistic that are not updated, changes in underlying table structure, huge insert/delete/update operations, missing indexes, and other factors. \n4. It may fail to generate an estimated execution plan if a procedure involves creating temp tables or table variables. Because an estimated plan query is not executed, temp tables are not considered when producing an estimated execution plan. \nActual Execution Plan \n1. An actual execution plan is generated after executing the query. It is more informative and reliable as it is based on actual execution not on estimated statistics. \n2. An Actual execution plan may take more time to generate if your query is complex as it has to execute the query to generate a plan. If you have got a complex query, it is better to check the estimated plan first. \n3. Working with an actual execution plan is reliable while troubleshooting performance related problems, as it gives us the actual, correct information. \nGetting an Estimated Execution Plan \nVarious options are available to generate an estimated execution plan. \n1. Select a query. Right-click on a query window, and select Display Estimated Execution Plan . \n2. Click on the Display estimated execution plan option in the main toolbar. \n3. Select a query, and press the CTRL + L keyboard key combination. \nGetting an Actual Execution Plan \n1. Click on the Actual estimated execution plan option in the main toolbar. \n2. Select a query, and press the CTRL + M keyboard key combination. \nExample: \nAn Estimated plan cannot be obtained for queries involving temporary tables, as a query is actually executed by query engine to get the estimated execution plan. \nSelect the query. Click on Display Estimated execution plan, and you will get an error. \nInvalid object name ‘#TempTable’. \nRead more about Database and SQL programming published on Tech-Recipes.",

      "text": "Subscribe to TechRepublic's Open Source Weekly newsletter \n\"Fire up a Windows 10 Insiders' build instance and run your code, run your tools, host your website on Apache, access your MySQL database from your Java code,\" he said. \n\"Whatever it is that you normally do on Linux to build an application: whether it's in Go, in Erlang, in C, whatever you use, please, give it a try on Bash WSL, and importantly file bugs on us. \n\"It really makes our life a lot easier and helps us build a product that we can all use and be far more productive with.\" \nThe pledge to improve Windows' support for Linux tools reflects a recent change in Microsoft's rhetoric towards open-source software. While Microsoft's then CEO Steve Ballmer described open-source software as a cancer in 2001 , in 2014 Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella proclaimed that \"Microsoft loves Linux\" . \nNadella's declaration may be simplistic, and ignore Microsoft's desire to stop organizations switching from Microsoft to open-source desktop software, as seen in Munich , but the tech giant has changed its hardline approach— even if only for pragmatic reasons . \nThis month Microsoft became a platinum member of the Linux Foundation , the culmination of years of Microsoft gradually making greater use of Linux, as evidenced by everything from Microsoft supporting eight different Linux distros on its Azure cloud platform to rolling its own specialized Linux distro called Azure Cloud Switch . \nMatthias Kirschner, president of the Free Software Foundation Europe (FSFE), said Microsoft's gradual acceptance of Linux was a complement, an acknowledgement of the quality of Free Software. \n\"It is an implied admission of the high quality of Free Software tools on behalf of Microsoft,\" he said. \n\"The same way demand for high performance operating systems compelled Microsoft to offer several flavours of GNU/Linux on their Azure cloud platform, the elegance and efficiency of Free Software command line tools have pushed Microsoft to develop the Windows Subsystem for GNU/Linux in a bid to remain competitive.\" \nAnd while he said he'd prefer individuals used an entirely free and open software system, \"we understand this is not always possible for them\". \n\"At the end of the day it just means there is more Free Software getting used by more people. It is a net gain for the Free Software movement.\" \nLinux software is run in Windows 10 on top of the Linux distro Ubuntu. Users interact with the Ubuntu, running software and issuing commands, via the Bash command line interpreter, which is available as a Universal Windows Platform app. \nMaking this possible is the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), which translates Linux system calls into calls that can be handled by the Windows kernel. While some users have got Ubuntu apps with graphical interfaces running on the system , Microsoft is focusing its efforts on getting command-line tools to work on Bash on Windows at native or near-native speeds . \nTurner also outlined the improvements to Bash on Windows that will be generally available in Windows 10 after the Creators Update early next year . \nForthcoming updates, some of which are already available to those testing early builds of Windows 10 under the Windows Insider Program, include support for Ubuntu 16.04 and more Linux tools. \nBroader and deeper support for Linux syscalls will improve support for languages such as node.js, Go, Ruby, Java. \nImprovements to the networking stack will also add support for ping and ifconfig commands, in turn unlocking other technologies that rely on the widely-used ifconfig command. \nThe other major new addition will be increased interoperability between the Bash and Windows environments. Effectively this will let developers call Windows applications from within Bash — allowing them to write a Bash script to automate a complex build that includes Windows applications — and to invoke Bash applications from Windows PowerShell. \nFinally, more minor changes include better UI rendering for complex console-based applications such as vim, emacs, tmux and mc, as well as mouse support within these tools.

      "text": "Microsoft to Start Trial Production of Surface Phone with Pegatron - Report GO The device is expected to launch in 2017 Nov 28, 2016 12:27 GMT · By Bogdan Popa · Share: ​ Microsoft is expected to launch the Surface Phone sometime next year, and a new report now claims that the company is ready to start trial production of the device. Citing Chinese newspaper Commercial Times, Digitimes writes that Microsoft is now working with Pegatron to produce the first units of the Surface Phone for testing purposes. Pegatron is one of Apple’s partners for the production of the iPhone, and it also worked with Microsoft on building the existing Surface models. The newspaper does not provide any other details about the Surface Phone, but it mentions that the launch is projected to take place in 2017. The Surface Phone Rumor has it that the Surface Phone would debut in the fall of 2017 and the start of trial production seems to align with this schedule, especially because the actual mass production of the device could begin in late spring if everything goes according to the plan. The Surface Phone is expected to be Microsoft’s one and only Windows phone, coming with the best the company would have to offer in terms of software and hardware. According to recent reports, the Surface Phone could come with a Snapdragon 835 processor , the same that’s likely to power Samsung’s upcoming S8 flagship, but also with a maximum of 8 GB RAM and 512 GB storage space. Unconfirmed reports indicated that the Surface Phone could be the pioneer of a new form factor that would make it possible for owners to turn it into a laptop with a new accessory that Microsoft is likely to launch together with the phone. Although there is no evidence from Microsoft in this regard, such a plan also aligns with the firm’s ambitions to invent new product categories with the help of its Surface products. As always, take this report with a pinch of salt because nothing is confirmed, but if trial production is about to start, this could be the first step towards Microsoft’s return in the mobile market.",

      "text": "Opinion by Steven J. Vaughan-Nichols Open source has won, and Microsoft has surrendered Many Linux users are ticked off and anxious about Microsoft joining the Linux Foundation. They are missing the real significance of that move. Computerworld | Nov 28, 2016 3:29 AM PT Email a friend Use commas to separate multiple email addresses From Your message has been sent. Sorry There was an error emailing this page. Credit: Pixabay \nMany Linux fans greeted the news that Microsoft is joining the Linux Foundation with anxiety-fueled anger. \nFor example, spooling through Reddit and my Google+ comment feed , I found these sorts of reactions: \n“This will destroy Linux.” \n“Trump is elected president and now this…” \n“Do people not realize that Microsoft has a strong economic incentive to see Linux fail? … That blows my f***ing mind that anything good can ever come out of this.” \n“That’s the, ‘embrace’ part. Next is, ‘extend.’ [And, then extinguish]” \nI asked Roy Schestowitz, editor of TechRights , what he thought about the deal. He told me: I have covered Microsoft’s interference with FOSS [free and open-source software] for over a decade and carefully studied even pertinent antitrust documents. I know the company’s way of thinking when it comes to undermining their competition The pattern of embrace and extend (to extinguish) — all this while leveraging software patents to make Linux a Microsoft cash cow or compel OEMs to preinstall privacy-hostile Microsoft software/apps with proprietary formats (lockin) — never ended. What I see in the Linux Foundation right now is what I saw in Nokia 5 years ago and in Novell 10 years ago — the very thing that motivated me to start BoycottNovell, a site that has just turned 10 with nearly 22,000 blog posts. It is a saddening day because it’s a culmination, after years of Microsoft ‘micro’ payments to the Linux Foundation (e.g. event sponsorship in exchange for keynote positions), which will have Microsoft shoved down the throats of GNU/Linux proponents and give an illusion of peace when there is none, not just on the patent front but also other fronts (see what Microsoft’s partner Accenture is doing in Munich right now). \nHe does an excellent job of summing up why many Linux people are having fits about Microsoft joining the Linux Foundation. I’ve been covering Linux since the beginning, 25 years ago , and I can add to his list Microsoft’s sponsoring SCO’s Linux attacks . Let’s face it: Microsoft didn’t earn its nickname, “The Evil Empire” for nothing. \nMicrosoft was scared of Linux for years. And it did what any frightened animal does: It attacked and attacked and attacked . \nBut that was then. This is now. \nWhere I disagree with Schestowitz and company is I believe Microsoft has fundamentally changed. Sure, Microsoft is still collecting money for its bogus Android/Linux patents . That won’t stop. Microsoft is a public company, and it makes more money from Android than it ever did from its own Microsoft mobile operating systems. And, yes, Microsoft still wants you to buy Windows for your desktop. \nBut — and this is a big one — neither of those are going to grow revenue. Microsoft’s future is in servers, services and the cloud. And what do all those run on? Ding! Ding! Ding! Open source and Linux. \nTake a good hard look at Microsoft’s last quarter . Azure’s revenue grew by 116% year over year. Microsoft’s profit margin from its cloud platform? A whopping 49%. \nGuess what. Four out of 10 server instances running on Azure are Linux. Their numbers are increasing by leaps and bounds. The foundation may be Windows Server, but the building is Linux. \nWim Coekaerts, until recently corporate vice president of Microsoft Enterprise Open Source Group, recently told me, “Satya [Nadella, Microsoft’s CEO] is very customer-centric. If [our customers] run Linux, and they often do, we want to make them happy . We have to play in an open, heterogeneous world.” He added, “Microsoft actually uses a lot of Linux in-house. It’s no longer everything has to be run on Windows internally.” Microsoft is doing this, he said, because “we’re solving business problems and we’re very pragmatic.” \nThere you have the keys to why it’s different this time. I can cite dozens of examples of how Microsoft is supporting one open-source project or another. That’s the specific of the real Microsoft change. \nMicrosoft realizes that Linux and open-source software have won. It knows that its customers want it, and it wants to make them happy. It’s really that simple. \nEmbrace, extend and extinguish worked for Microsoft when it took over the Internet browser market. It Butthe Web was just coming together and there were no standards. Linux, on the other hand, is long established. Open source, by its very nature, makes it easy to extend software but nigh on impossible to extinguish it. \nNo, Microsoft had two choices. It could try things the same old way — the way that many Linux fans are sure it’s still doing. Or it could change its ways and work with Linux and open-source software. \nThis isn’t Bill Gates’ or Steve Ballmer’s Microsoft. They were all about total market domination. This is Nadella’s Microsoft, and he wants to work with others. As Jim Zemlin, the Linux Foundation’s executive director, told me, “Microsoft has grown and matured in its use of and contributions to open-source technology. The company has become an enthusiastic supporter of Linux and of open source and a very active member of many important projects.” \nToday, believe it or not, we’re no longer caught in a war between proprietary and open-source software. Open source has won, and Microsoft wants to be on the winning side. To express your thoughts on Computerworld content, visit Computerworld's Facebook page , LinkedIn page and Twitter stream .

Citing Chinese newspaper Commercial Times, Digitimes writes that Microsoft is now working with Pegatron to produce the first units of the Surface Phone for testing purposes. Pegatron is one of Apple’s partners for the production of the iPhone, and it also worked with Microsoft on building the existing Surface models. The newspaper does not provide any other details about the Surface Phone, but it mentions that the launch is projected to take place in 2017.

      "title": "Windows 10 Creators Update: new Share UI",
      "text": "tweet \nMicrosoft plans to ship a new Share UI (user interface) with next year’s Windows 10 Creator Update that will likely come out in March 2017. \nWhile I hardly ever use sharing functionality — other than copying share content to the clipboard — others must use it actively considering that nearly any web browser or operating system ships with share functionality these days. \nWindows 8’s and 10’s share UI up until now opens all share options in a sidebar. You may then pick one of the available options from the sidebar to share content using that channel. \nYou may for instance share an article on Twitter or Facebook , send an image to an image editor, or add text to OneNote. \nWindows 10’s Share functionality is limited to what the operating system itself and Store apps provide. The new Share UI \nThe new Windows 10 share UI is not ready yet for prime time. This is the reason why it is not enabled by default. \nNote : The following Registry tweak works only on the Fast Ring Insider channel of Windows 10 currently. Tap on the Windows-key on your keyboard, type regedit.exe, and hit the Enter-key on the keyboard afterwards. Navigate to the key HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINESOFTWAREMicrosoft. You may use the new Registry Editor address bar to jump to the location quickly. If the key SharePlatform exists, skip to step 5. Right-click on Microsoft and select New > Key. Name it SharePlatform. Right-click on SharePlatform and select New > Dword (32-bit) Value. Give it the name EnableNewShareFlow. Double-click the entry afterwards and give it the value 1. \nThe new Share UI on Windows 10 is enabled right after you have made the change. As you can see on the screenshot above, it is not yet fully functionality. \nThe main issue right now is that it displays application IDs instead of names so that it is not always clear what a share option does. This will be resolved in future updates however. So what is different? \nThe core change is that the Share UI opens as an overlay window on the screen instead of in the sidebar. This should mean less mouse or hand movement to make use of share functionality. \nAnother difference to the current Share functionality on Windows 10 is that Microsoft seems to be working on a new feature to share content directly to other devices running Windows 10 that are connected to the same network (using Wi-Fi or Bluetooth). \nYou could share content from your desktop PC to your Surface device, or to one of those rare Windows 10 phones. Closing Words \nThe new Share UI will ship with Windows 10 if things go as planned. The switch should not be too confusing to users considering that this is not a drastic change, and that functionality remains the same for the most part.

      "text": "Windows 10 Pro Users Can Now Install Store Apps Without a Microsoft Account GO Microsoft makes sudden change for Windows 10 Pro users Nov 28, 2016 12:53   Just like it happened in Windows 8, Windows 10 requires users to log in with a Microsoft account in order to install apps from the Store, but this is no longer valid for those whose computers are powered by the Pro SKU of the operating system. German website WIndowsArea has discovered that Microsoft suddenly made a policy change that makes it possible for Windows 10 Pro users to install apps from the Windows Store without the need for a Microsoft Account. There are some limitations though. First of all, only freeware applications can be installed, so if you want to purchase an app, an account is still required. Then, if you’re trying to update a paid application that’s already installed on your Windows 10 device, an account is once again needed. Why the change? Microsoft hasn’t explained why exactly it made this change, but given the fact that it concerns the Pro version of the operating system, it’s not difficult to see that the company specifically targeted companies that are trying to get more control over what users install on their systems. On the other hand, it’s not yet clear if the Enterprise SKU of Windows 10 can also install apps without a Microsoft account because reports in this regard are still mixed, with some claiming that it works, while others indicating that it doesn’t. Without a doubt, installing apps from the Windows Store without an account can boost adoption of Store apps, but we’ve reached out to Microsoft to find out if this is indeed a new policy change and to ask for more details about it. In the meantime, a Microsoft account continues to be the best way to install apps on a Windows 10 computer, and it also brings a number of other advantages, including sync of settings.",

      "text": "Microsoft’s Chinese Bot Won’t Gossip About the New President of the US GO I know you’re going to take a screenshot, it says Nov 28, 2016 12:44   It might come as a big surprise for those living in Europe or in the United States, but one of the most popular services in China at the moment is a Microsoft chatbot known as Xiaoice, which people can use to talk about a variety of topics, including gossip and politics. And while Xiaoice has developed a pretty friendly attitude, the chatbot won’t discuss a series of topics, including here the United States President-elect Donald Trump. The reason is as simple as it could be: Microsoft doesn’t want to take any risks with Xiaoice, because there’s always the possibility for the chatbot to say something stupid, so it filters these requests to discuss something else. So what happens when you ask Xiaoice about Donald Trump? CNN tried it and the result was a little bit unexpected: “I’m just a random observer.” When asked about President Xi Jinping, Xiaoice offered an answer that provides us with an idea regarding the reasons that convince Microsoft to filter the chatbot’s reactions: “Am I stupid? Once I answer you’d take a screengrab.” Not taking any risks Microsoft clearly knows that should Xiaoice given any unexpected remarks users would take screenshots and post them online, so the company is trying to avoid this with filters that help it play safe. There are moments when Xiaoice becomes even a little bit more aggressive. For example, if you ask about Tiananmen Square, the chatbot says that “You know every well that I can’t respond to that, boring.” And if you press it to offer a response, it takes you by surprise. “I’m unable to communicate with you, blacklisted!” it says, before closing the conversation. Microsoft had a similar experience in the United States when it launched a similar chatbot called Tay which users could communicate with on Twitter. Shortly after the launch, however, Microsoft decided to take it down because users taught it to be racist, so it started providing all kinds of inappropriate answers.",

      "text": "​Just like it happened in Windows 8, Windows 10 requires users to log in with a Microsoft account in order to install apps from the Store, but this is no longer valid for those whose computers are powered by the Pro SKU of the operating system. German website WIndowsArea has discovered that Microsoft suddenly made a policy change that makes it possible for Windows 10 Pro users to install apps from the Windows Store without the need for a Microsoft Account. There are some limitations though. First of all, only freeware applications can be installed, so if you want to purchase an app, an account is still required. Then, if you’re trying to update a paid application that’s already installed on your Windows 10 device, an account is once again needed. Why the ch...",

      "text": "​It might come as a big surprise for those living in Europe or in the United States, but one of the most popular services in China at the moment is a Microsoft chatbot known as Xiaoice, which people can use to talk about a variety of topics, including gossip and politics. And while Xiaoice has developed a pretty friendly attitude, the chatbot won’t discuss a series of topics, including here the United States President- elect Donald Trump. The reason is as simple as it could be: Microsoft doesn’t want to take any risks with Xiaoice, because there’s always the possibility for the chatbot to say something stupid, so it filters these requests to discuss something else. So what happens when you ask Xiaoice about Donald Trump ? CNN tried it and the result was a little bit unexpected: “I’m just a random observer.” When asked about President Xi Jinping, Xiaoice offered a...",

      "text": "Bill Gates, born in Seattle, the founder of Microsoft , is an American entrepreneur. \nSergey Brin , co-founder of Google, born in Moscow under Communist rule, is an American entrepreneur. \nElon Musk, born in South Africa, the founder of Tesla Motors and SpaceX , is an American entrepreneur. \nAfter the most divisive election season in our lifetimes, it's worth taking a fresh look at what we have in common. One thing that stands out is America's welcoming atmosphere for entrepreneurs, a hallmark of this great land of opportunity that goes back to the historic beginnings of our nation. \nPresident Obama on October 31 proclaimed November to be National Entrepreneurship Month - though the news was obscured by the pre-election glare. To me, having launched four companies, this celebration of America's entrepreneurial spirit is a powerful unifying factor as we move forward trying to speed up the economy, boost middle-class wages and ensure that the dream is still alive. \nThe people most capable of doing this are not the Washington politicians - who nonetheless have the responsibility to make entrepreneurship possible under our laws and regulations, and to see that there is the potential of sufficient rewards for those who risk so much to launch and grow a business. \nNo, the people who hold the future of the U.S. economy in their hands are those people who take that risk. Giving them the help they need to thrive should be seen by Washington and the incoming administration as the gift that keeps on giving. New business start-ups, if they are well-planned and well-managed, see the growth that creates jobs, pays taxes and provides better lives for their employees and customers. \nThe entrepreneurs cited above have a lot in common. They began with an idea for doing something better. Google was once a research project by several graduate students to improved Internet search results; Microsoft an idea for giving computers the foundation to perform the multiplicity of tasks we ask of them every day. \nThe ambitious SpaceX has taken on challenges that NASA never did, including launching reusable booster rockets and landing them, upright, on a barge in the middle of the ocean. Tesla single-handedly turned the world's auto industry on its head by producing a pricey dream car that runs on climate-friendly battery power. \nThey are American companies, founded by American entrepreneurs, who may or may not have been born here, but chose the U.S. because of its huge economy and pioneering entrepreneurial spirit. \nBut along with the marquee names are millions of small companies that are a vital part of our economic ecosystem. Every New York bodega, Iowa farm, Alaskan fishing boat and California car dealer puts it out there, every day, their employees making a living for their families and their owners working their plan to make their venture pay off. It is the American way. \nThis week the United States elected a new president, a successful entrepreneur who has promised to be a friend to American business. He is not well-liked, even by many of those who voted for him, but people heard that promise and decided to give him a chance. \nWe must hold Donald Trump to his commitment to increase the opportunities for American business, and urge him never to forget the people who put themselves - and often their life savings - on the line to bring their ideas to the marketplace. \nIt didn't matter who won the White House, these entrepreneurs are our future either way. Our new president must smooth their road to success.   Advertisement",

      "text": "Microsoft Wants All Linux Developers to Move to Windows 10 GO Give a try to WSL and you’ll be amazed, the company says Nov 28, 2016 13:22 GMT · By Bogdan Popa · Share: Microsoft has finally acknowledged the potential that the open-source world in general, and Linux in particular, boasts, so the company is exploring its options to expand in this area with every occasion. Most recently, an episode posted on Channel 9 and entitled “Improvements to Bash on Windows and the Windows Console” with senior program manager Rich Turner calls for Linux developers to give up on their platforms for Windows 10. “Fire up a Windows 10 Insiders' build instance and run your code, run your tools, host your website on Apache, access your MySQL database from your Java code,” he explained. More improvements on their way Turner went on to point out that the Windows subsystem for Linux is there to provide developers with all the necessary tools to code just like they’d do it on Linux, all without losing the advantages of Windows 10. \"Whatever it is that you normally do on Linux to build an application: whether it's in Go, in Erlang, in C, whatever you use, please, give it a try on Bash WSL, and importantly file bugs on us. It really makes our life a lot easier and helps us build a product that we can all use and be far more productive with,” he continued. Of course, Microsoft is keen on improving WSL in Windows 10, and Turner noted that the final goal is to make it fully compatible with all development tools that are currently on Linux and which could be used by those who switch to its latest OS. “We're not done yet. We have a long way to go yet until we can fully say that this thing is really comprehensibly compatible with the majority of the tools that you want to use,” he said. Recently, Microsoft joined the Linux Foundation as a platinum member, promising to contribute to the development of the open-source world. The announcement took many people by surprise, especially after former CEO Steve Ballmer described Linux as “a cancer. With Satya Nadella at the helm of the company, however, Microsoft seems to adopt a totally different approach, and getting closer to the open-source ecosystem is regarded as a priority for the software giant.",

      "text": "In early November Microsoft announced a new product called Microsoft Teams . It's a way for groups of people, typically colleagues inside a company, to communicate with each other over multiple, simultaneous conversations. It will be part of the software giant's online Office 365 product, the \"productivity\" subscription program used by 85 million \"knowledge workers\" around the world. More than a billion additional customers use the offline version of Office.\nA relatively small group of people--4 million, to be precise--will recognize something familiar about the new Microsoft offering . That's because it's more or less what a San Francisco startup called Slack does. Microsoft is adding a few bells and whistles, including easier-to-follow threaded conversations and video conferencing. Slack, which took the charmingly old-fashioned step of buying a newspaper ad to \"welcome\" Microsoft to its game, has said it will match those features. ( Fortune , like many journalism organizations, uses Slack; after a year of steadily increasing usage, I've grown to like it.)\nThis isn't the first time Microsoft has unveiled a \"Slack killer.\" In fact, it is becoming something of an annual event . What's more, Slack is growing fast. It has 4 million users, up from 1.25 million a year ago. About 30% of those customers pay either $6.67 or $12.50 per month for the product, depending on which features they use. My back-of-the-envelope calculation of Slack's annual revenue, assuming all customers pay the average of the two price points, is around $140 million. \"You're pretty close,\" Slack founder and CEO Stewart Butterfield told me just before Thanksgiving.\nThis David-versus-Goliath story could play out one of two ways. In the past, Microsoft users would ignore the new feature because it turns out what they really like about Office is email, Word, Excel, and PowerPoint. Slack would benefit from its focus. Then again, Microsoft has its act together in a way it hasn't for years. And group conversations are the perfect complement to the other Office features. Slack could wither if users adopt Microsoft's no-extra-cost feature.\nIt's the kind of story only tech lovers and venture capitalists truly care about. Technology customers will benefit either way.\nAdam Lashinsky @adamlashinsky adam_lashinsky@fortune.com BITS AND BYTES Is Samsung mulling a split? The South Korean tech giant is under pressure to improve shareholder value, and it plans to discuss its intentions after early this week. A local newspaper is reporting that a corporate breakup could be on the table, a move that has been advocated by activist investor Elliott Management. ( Reuters )\nShipping giant Matson moves into Amazon's cloud . The $2.2 billion freight carrier, which sends ships between the west coast and places including China, closed four data centers by moving to Amazon Web Services. Watch for more news from the cloud giant's confab in Las Vegas. ( Fortune )\nPayments upstart Stripe is now valued at $9 billion . The company founded by brothers Patrick and John Collison received another $150 million venture infusion, led by Alphabet's venture capital firm CapitalG and existing investor General Catalyst. Stripe is winning some pretty big customers, including American Express, Macy's, Bloomingdale's, GE, and Adidas. ( Fortune )\nIt was a blockbuster weekend for e-commerce . The sales on Thanksgiving day alone topped $1 billion , up 14%. It looks like Amazon will break its records for Black Friday, traditionally the heaviest shopping day of the year--and the first $1 billion day for purchases from mobile devices. About 10 million more shoppers completed their purchases from their sofas rather than making the trip downtown or to the mall. ( Reuters , Fortune , Fortune , Recode )\nExpect more local hiring from the big Indian outsourcing firms . Tata Consultancy Services, Infosys, and Wipro rely heavily on H1-B skilled worker visas to send their engineers to the U.S. With the future of that program uncertain under President-elect Donald Trump, all three are stepping up plans to recruit closer to their clients. It's also likely to spark a string of acquisitions among IT services firms. ( Reuters )\nTHE DOWNLOAD This messaging startup is helping the likes of Cox and Citizens Bank reinvent customer service . The idea of using messaging as a conduit for marketing and customer support has been gathering steam since Facebook declared its intention last year to let businesses connect through its standalone Messenger app.\nOne startup benefiting from that burgeoning interest is Philadelphia-based Relay Network, which counts Cox Communications, Comcast , and Citizens Bank among the big companies using its private messaging service with appreciable results.

Most recently, an episode posted on Channel 9 and entitled “Improvements to Bash on Windows and the Windows Console” with senior program manager Rich Turner calls for Linux developers to give up on their platforms for Windows 10. “Fire up a Windows 10 Insiders' build instance and run your code, run your tools, host your website on Apache, access your MySQL database from your Java code,” he explained. More improvements on their way Turner went on to point out that the Windows subsystem for Linux is there to provide developers with all the necessary tools to code just like they’d do it on Linux, all without losing the advantages of Windows 10. \"Whatever it is that you normally do on ...",

      "title": "Top Windows 10 alternative OS for desktop and laptop users",
      "text": "0 0 \nWindows 10 is the latest operating system, otherwise platform, of Microsoft’s flagship OS series. As Windows dominates the desktop and laptop OS industry, it’s easy to forget there are some other notable platforms for Windows PCs. If you’re looking for alternatives to Win 10, there are a few operating systems you can try out. \nFirst, it’s worth noting that Apple and Google operating systems are designed for more specialized desktops and laptops. The Mac OS X is the biggest platform after Windows, but it’s exclusively for Macs. Google developed the Chrome OS for Chromebook laptops. As such, you can’t install either platform on Windows desktops and laptops with a Mac OS X or Chromebook DVD. The only way you can run Chrome OS and MacOS X on Windows PC is with virtualization software such as VirtualBox. Thus, they can’t be counted as genuine alternatives to Windows 10; but these are a few of the OS alternatives for Windows desktop and laptops. The Ubuntu, Zorin, SteamOS and Mint Linux Platforms \nLinux is a UNIX OS version that’s freely available as open-source software. This is a platform developed by Linux distributors such as Zorin Group. There are a variety of Linux-based operating systems that you can add to Windows desktops or laptops. \nUbuntu is one of the best Linux operating systems available for desktops, laptops and tablets. This operating system has a Launcher on the left side of its Unity desktop. That’s Ubuntu’s equivalent of the taskbar from which you can open applications and switch between them. Users can also open the Dash from the Launcher that includes recently opened software and files and a search tool. Ubuntu also includes virtual desktops that are now incorporated in Windows 10. \nZorin OS is a Linux platform that is much more like Windows XP and 7. The developers developed Zorin OS more specifically for Linux newcomers. Consequently, it incorporates the taskbar, system tray and Start menu on the Windows desktop with the AWN dock. This is one of the best Linux platforms for running Windows software. You can add Zorin to your desktop or laptop from this page . \nMint is an elegant Linux OS that includes some bundled proprietary software alongside open-source programs. The inclusion of proprietary plug-ins and codecs for MP3, Flash and DVD playback certainly enhance the platform’s multimedia support. Firefox, VLC media player, GIMP and LibreOffice are some of the default software included in Mint. The OS also includes a software manager (mintInstall), update manager (mintUpdate) and mintMenu that has filtering, configuration, session management and other software options. Open this page to install Linux Mint. \nThe SteamOS runs on a modified Linux version. This is a gaming OS primarily for the Steam Machine that’s not exactly a replacement for desktop operating systems. However, you can also add it to a Windows laptop or desktop. So for PC gaming this might be a good platform, but it lacks a default file manager or image viewer. It has a GNOME Shell desktop and includes the Iceweasel browser. The OS also has relatively limited multimedia support. Remix OS \nRemix OS effectively brings Android to desktops and laptops with ARM or x86 architecture. The OS is based on Android Marshmallow and enables you to run all the latest Android games and apps. This platform has a modified Android UI that incorporates a taskbar, system tray and menu with search tools. The Remix OS runs from USB sticks with at least 8 GB storage. Mr Torvalds, a Remix OS developer, stated: “ I believe users are leaving Windows or are at least open to other options. I’m excited that working on Remix OS provides a Linux-based option for these users. ” \nHowever, you don’t necessarily need Remix OS to add Android to your desktop or laptop. This page includes ISOs that enable you to port Android to desktops and laptops. With one of those ISOs you can set up a bootable USB drive and then install the OS. Chromium OS \nThe Chrome OS on Chromebooks is a platform with a Google Chrome browser UI. In the Chrome OS desktop users can run just the browser and Chrome apps. Chromium OS is an open-source version of the ChromeOS that you can install on Windows desktop and laptops with forks such as CloudReady. Chromium OS isn’t exactly the same as ChromeOS, but there isn’t much difference. eComStation \nNot many will likely have heard of eComStation. This is effectively the OS/2 operating system that Microsoft and IBM originally developed until Microsoft left the partnership. IBM continued development for the OS that briefly competed with Windows as OS/2 Warp. As the platform never really took off, IBM abandoned it; and Serenity Systems now distributes the OS as eComStation. This is an OS that has a drag-and-drop UI and includes a command line interface comparable to the Command Prompt. Third-party support for eComStation is a little limited, but it includes a reasonable amount of software. This platform has home and business editions with the home version subscriptions retailing from $41 to $220. Haiku \nHaiku is effectively a continuation of the BeOS platform that also fell by the wayside. This is an open-source OS that clones the BeOS UI. It’s a fast operating system with a clean UI design and plethora of configuration options. The most notable aspect of the Haiku desktop is the Tracker that’s effectively a vertical taskbar from which users can open applications by clicking its blue feather icon. BePDF, Vision, WonderBrush (an advanced graphics editor), WebPositive, NetSurf and Pe (a text editor) are some of Haiku’s bundled software packages. It also includes built-in games such as BeMines (a Minesweeper clone), Rolemup, Colorballs and Pairs. You can install the platform from Haiku’s home page. \nSo those are some of the alternatives to Windows 10. You can add them to Windows desktops and laptops. Of those platforms, Linux probably has the most extensive third-party software support.",

      "text": "0 0 \nHead of Xbox One Phil Spencer has expressed his wishes to see Super Mario appear on Microsoft’s console. He further hinted that Microsoft and Nintendo might be working on making this possible. \n“Nintendo has the strongest first-party of anybody,” said Phil Spencer about the Japanese video game maker when asked about the partnership. “They’re just fantastic and the memories that they have instilled in so many of us, who’ve played their games and had those delightful experiences, having those on Xbox would be great,” he further added. \nThe news has ignited a glimmer of hope among gamers with classic tastes who speculate that Super Mario games will soon be playable on the Xbox One. \nThe past couple of years have gone particularly well for the Xbox One, given the introduction of backward compatibility and the Play Anywhere feature that allows gamers to jump between games on the Xbox One and Windows PC. \nWith Microsoft in full swing for the launch of its next console in 2017, the Xbox One Scorpio, there are several hints suggesting that Super Mario will appear on Scorpio given the partnership does come to an agreement. \nBack in 2015, Spencer suggested that he would particularly appreciate if Microsoft characters like Banjo Kazooie could show up in Nintendo games such as Super Smash Brothers. The release of Minecraft on Nintendo acted also contributed to this friendly relationship between Microsoft and Nintendo. Spencer added, “Obviously we have Minecraft on Nintendo and when that opportunity came up to work with them on Minecraft , you know, some people might look at it and say ‘why would you even do that?’ But with Nintendo, it’s been a great partnership on Minecraft . In fact they put Mario in Minecraft on Wii U with the mash-up skin pack.”",

      "text": "| Follow Microsoft modifies November patches to bypass Lenovo server conflicts Installing any of a wide variety of security patches causes Lenovo servers to hang on the splash screen, but a fix is available InfoWorld | Nov 28, 2016   The Windows 8.1 user's guide to navigating Windows 10 \nMicrosoft released patches for Server 2016, 2012R2, and 2012 on Nov. 8 that freeze specific Lenovo servers on reboot. The servers don’t finish the POST process and hang at the Lenovo splash screen. After many complaints, Lenovo issued six new UEFI firmware patches on Nov. 22. The next day, Microsoft altered six of its security patches, including the latest Win10 version 1607 cumulative update, KB 3200970, to add logic bypassing automatic installation of those patches on the affected servers. \nThe flurry of activity led to numerous missing patches on the Microsoft site for several hours on the afternoon of Nov. 23. We had several reports on AskWoody.com of patches that had simply disappeared -- they weren’t available from the Microsoft Update Catalog. By the end of the day on Nov. 23, all of the patches had returned. [ From Docker containers and Nano Server to software-defined storage and networking improvements, Windows Server 2016 is packed with great additions: Get the scoop on Windows Server 2016 from InfoWorld . | Stay up on key Microsoft technologies with the Windows Report newsletter . ] \nIf you’ve already installed the patches, there’s nothing you need to do. If you tried to install the patches and they didn’t appear in Windows Update, WSUS, the Download Center, or the Update Catalog, check again. They’re back. \nIf you have one of the affected Lenovo System X M5 or X6 servers , you need to get the UEFI firmware update installed and then manually install whichever Windows patch you may have missed. If your server won’t boot, Lenovo has instructions for manually flashing the UEFI firmware. As Lenovo’s fix page solemnly warns, “Replacing the system board will not fix the issue.” \nAs best I can tell, all of the following Windows patches were pulled, disappeared for a few hours, then re-issued in a modified state so they won’t install automatically on affected Lenovo servers. The KB articles have been modified to say: \nKnown issues in this update \nSome Lenovo servers do not start after this update is installed. Lenovo is aware of this problem and has released a UEFI update to address it. In the interim, Microsoft has changed the detection logic in the update to prevent additional customers from being affected. For more information, see https://support.lenovo.com/us/en/solutions/ht502912. \nIt’s important to note that the bits in these patches didn’t change on Nov. 23. Only the detection mechanism -- the “metadata” -- was changed: \nKB 3200970 - Cumulative update for Windows 10 Version 1607 and Windows Server 2016: Nov. 8, 2016 (this is for Win10 Anniversary Update, as the other versions of Win10 weren’t changed). \nKB 3197873 - November 2016 Security Only Quality Update for Windows 8.1, and Windows Server 2012 R2 (that’s a “Group B” patch using my post-patchocalypse terminology ). \nKB 3197874 - November 2016 Security Monthly Quality Rollup for Windows 8.1 and Windows Server 2012 R2 (“Group A”). \nKB 3197876 - November 2016 Security Only Quality Update for Windows Server 2012 (“Group B”). \nKB 3197877 - November 2016 Security Monthly Quality Rollup for Windows Server 2012 (“Group A”). \nMS16-140 / KB 3193479 - Security update for boot manager: Nov. 8, 2016. The KB article has this notice: \nV1.1 (November 23, 2016) Revised bulletin to announce a detection change for certain servers running Windows Servers 2012, Windows Server 2012 R2, and Windows Server 2016. Affected servers will not automatically receive the security update. For more information about the servers affected by this detection change, see Knowledge Base Article 3193479. \nThe good news: If you have a Lenovo server that won’t boot, a solution exists. The very good news: If you already have the patches installed, there’s nothing you need to do. Nothing to see here, folks, move along.  ",

Follow   \nOne of the benefits of the new Xbox One S is support for high-dynamic range. If you have a 4K TV, this means more vibrant and luminous games; in essence, it aims to make content look more realistic. \nIf you're wondering what games support HDR now or will in the future, we've roundup them up here. We will continue to update this post as more HDR-supported games are announced. \nSome of the Xbox One games that support HDR right now include Microsoft-published titles like Gears of War 4 and Forza Horizon 3 . Third-party games like NBA 2K17 , Hitman , and Battlefield 1 already have or will be patched to support HDR in the future. You can see the full list below. \nXbox marketing boss Aaron Greenberg teased on Twitter that there are \"lots more\" games that will receive an HDR patch in the future, though he didn't name any outright. \nIn other Xbox news, you can get an Xbox One S for as little as $213 right now on Amazon as part of its ongoing Black Friday/Cyber Monday sale. Retailers like GameStop and Best Buy have the console marked down to $250 in their Cyber Monday promotions. \nHDR Xbox One Games (as of November 28, 2016):",

In a statement to GameSpot, Xbox marketing executive Mike Nichols said demand was \"strong\" for Xbox hardware, accessories, and games, while Xbox Live engagement was also labeled as being \"strong.\" \nMicrosoft shared no specific unit sales for Xbox console or hardware sales, while no concrete information was provided about Xbox Live performance. \nThe Xbox One S was offered for only $250 on Black Friday, while a number of high-profile games (first- and third-party alike) were significantly discounted. On the Xbox Live front, the network's Black Friday sale kicked off on November 18 and continues until tomorrow, November 28 . \nXbox One has been riding high in the US for a while now, as the console has been the best-selling system in the US for four straight months, dating back to July . \n\"We are grateful to our community for their continued dedication and passion toward Xbox, and are committed to making Xbox the best place to game this year and beyond,\" Nichols said.

      "title": "How Slack Versus Microsoft Could Play Out",
      "text": "In early November Microsoft announced a new product called Microsoft Teams . It's a way for groups of people, typically colleagues inside a company, to communicate with each other over multiple, simultaneous conversations. It will be part of the software giant's online Office 365 product, the \"productivity\" subscription program used by 85 million \"knowledge workers\" around the world. More than a billion additional customers use the offline version of Office.\nA relatively small group of people--4 million, to be precise--will recognize something familiar about the new Microsoft offering . That's because it's more or less what a San Francisco startup called Slack does. Microsoft is adding a few bells and whistles, including easier-to-follow threaded conversations and video conferencing. Slack, which took the charmingly old-fashioned step of buying a newspaper ad to \"welcome\" Microsoft to its game, has said it will match those features. ( Fortune , like many journalism organizations, uses Slack; after a year of steadily increasing usage, I've grown to like it.)\nThis isn't the first time Microsoft has unveiled a \"Slack killer.\" In fact, it is becoming something of an annual event . What's more, Slack is growing fast. It has 4 million users, up from 1.25 million a year ago. About 30% of those customers pay either $6.67 or $12.50 per month for the product, depending on which features they use. My back-of-the-envelope calculation of Slack's annual revenue, assuming all customers pay the average of the two price points, is around $140 million. \"You're pretty close,\" Slack founder and CEO Stewart Butterfield told me just before Thanksgiving.\nGet Data Sheet , Fortune's technology newsletter, where this essay originated. \nThis David-versus-Goliath story could play out one of two ways. In the past, Microsoft users would ignore the new feature because it turns out what they really like about Office is email, Word, Excel, and PowerPoint. Slack would benefit from its focus. Then again, Microsoft has its act together in a way it hasn't for years. And group conversations are the perfect complement to the other Office features. Slack could wither if users adopt Microsoft's no-extra-cost feature.\nIt's the kind of story only tech lovers and venture capitalists truly care about. Technology customers will benefit either way.",

The number of shares short is then compared to the average daily volume, in order to calculate the total number of trading days it would take to close out all of the open short positions if every share traded represented a short position being closed.",

      "text": "Microsoft Arrow Launcher gets updated Microsoft Arrow Launcher This launcher app for Android devices has just reached version 2.7, and now features improved file search, customized grid layout, as well as the usual bug fixes and improvements, including a 10 percent performance increase.   Android Software   Microsoft Arrow Launcher was updated to version 2.6 earlier this month, and now the Redmond giant pushes online a new variant. This happens during a very busy week for Microsoft since the company also updated Bing, Cortana, and the Next Lock Screen app. The Android launcher app gets updated at the same time as OneDrive, exactly as it happened two weeks ago. The version 2.7 of this program comes with easier search, customizable grid layout for the app page, as well as customizable content for the recent page. At last, the usual list of fixes and improvements delivered by such minor updates also come with a 10 percent improvement in memory efficiency. The updated Arrow Launcher can be freely downloaded from the Google Play store. Next to it, the updated OneDrive app improves sorting and parsing of the files in the cloud, also adding new paintbrushes and pencils to the productivity tools.  ",

      "text": "  \n(Facebook/Xbox) The powerful Xbox One S is a lot more budget friendly, compared to the upcoming high-end Project Scorpio which is touted to also have a premium price. \nMicrosoft's Project Scorpio was one of the biggest reveals during the Electronic Entertainment Expo 2016 (E3 2016) that happened last June 14 to 16. \nMicrosoft has touted that the Project Scorpio will be one of the most powerful consoles in the market, but sadly, it does seem that users will have to shell out a lot more too. \nProject Scorpio is equipped with 8 CPU cores, 6 Teraflops of GPU power, 320 GB/s memory bandwidth, 12 GB of GDDR5 RAM, and is capable of running games at 4K. \nAs impressive as the specs for the Project Scorpio are, one of the main questions that users have is about the price of the console. Advertisement \nCurrently, the PlayStation 4 Pro is being sold for only $399. And since the PlayStation 4 Pro only has 4.2 Teraflops compared to the 6 Teraflops that Project Scorpio has, it goes without saying that Project Scorpio would definitely be priced higher than $399. \nIn a recent interview with Xbox executive Phil Spencer, he reiterated that the Xbox S will be the most affordable console that Microsoft will be offering. Although there is still no price linked to Project Scorpio, the executive revealed that since Project Scorpio is for the high-end console market, the pricing for Project Scorpio will be relative to the investments they have put into the console and the market that they are aiming for. \nEven though Microsoft has yet to announce a price for the Project Scorpio, there have been a lot of speculations regarding the price of the unit. The minimum price of the console has been speculated to be $499. \nThe release date of Project Scorpio is another piece of information that has not yet been released by Microsoft though Tech Advisor has already speculated that it could be released around December 2017. \nThis is based on Spencer's introduction of the Project Scorpio where he stated that since developers are aiming for big releases during the holidays of 2017. \nBelow is the video where Spencer talks about the pricing for Project Scorpio.

      "text": "Resident Evil 7 could become the first non-exclusive Microsoft game to support Xbox Play Anywhere if the latest reports holds true. This could usher in a wave of third-party developers putting their support behind Microsoft's grand vision. ( Capcom ) Advertisement \nResident Evil 7 is the newest video game in the popular and long running franchise. The title is designed to bring the franchise back to its roots due to the challenges faced by Resident Evil 6. The new game, for the first time, will also support cross-saves between Xbox and Windows 10 PCs. \nCross-saves between the Xbox One version of the game and Windows 10 is quite interesting, but nothing new. Microsoft has pioneered this feature with its Xbox Play Anywhere program. However, what is not known at the moment is whether or not Resident Evil 7 supports the full Xbox Play Anywhere features. \nThe report was first released by Japanese website, DengekOnline , saying, \"the Windows Store version can share play data with the Xbox One version.\" IGN also went on to say Capcom had confirmed this cross-save feature in a statement. \nWhat Capcom is doing here is a good move, but what gamers want to know is if this game will be a traditional Xbox Play Anywhere title or not. For those who are wondering, Xbox Play Anywhere is more than just having the ability to cross-save. Once a player purchases a game from the Xbox One digitally, the same game (if available on the Windows Store) can be downloaded and played on the PC for free. \nWhen it comes down to multiplayer, gamers can play co-op with their friends no matter what the platform is. Have a PC and your friends own Xbox One's? No problem, co-op multiplayer is a go. The games that take full advantage of these features are Gears of War 4 , Forza Horizon 3 and more. \nSo far, only Xbox exclusive video games have supported Xbox Play Anywhere, so having Resident Evil 7 in the fold would surely prove that third-party developers are warming up to the idea of having their games purchased once on a single platform and played on another without any extra charges. If you do not have a copy of Resident Evil 7 yet, you can check it out here . Resident Evil 7 Not Exclusive To Microsoft Platforms \nWe should point out that Resident Evil 7 will not only be available on Windows 10 and Xbox One, but also on the PlayStation 4, PlayStation 4 Pro, and Steam. The game is also expected to support virtual reality on the PlayStation 4 systems via PSVR . However, there's no word if the PC versions will also support VR, but in our minds, this is unlikely. \nThe horror title is expected to hit store shelves come Jan. 24, 2017.

      "text": "By Rich Woods Neowin LLC @@TheRichWoods · 5 seconds ago \nBeginning four days ago, Microsoft began offering a promotion that gave customers a free Lumia 950 with the purchase of a 950 XL in the US. That was combined with another long-running deal , which offered a free Display Dock with the purchase of either device, resulting in a value of almost $1,000 for just $499. \nUnfortunately, the Display Dock offer has now ended, and the Dock is no longer sold in the Microsoft Store. If you want to use Continuum with your new devices, you can either buy the Dock from another retailer, or you can use a number of other solutions, such as wireless Miracast, a USB Type-C to HDMI adapter, and more. Of course, with those solutions, you'll also need Bluetooth peripherals. \nIf you're still looking for a deal, you still get a free Lumia 950 as long as you purchase your 950 XL before the end of the day today. Even if you don't want the additional device, its value should offset the cost of the other, as well as the Display Dock. \nMicrosoft will undoubtedly have more deals on its devices throughout the holiday season, so stay tuned for more.

      "text": "Microsoft announced five new backwards compatibility games for its Xbox One console and GTA 5 Online hinted to get a brand new Biker DLC 2 (Photo : Getty images/Joe Raedle /Staff) Advertisement \nMicrosoft has always thrilled Xbox users with amazing surprises. The company recently launched a new lineup of Backwards Compatibility games for its Xbox One console. This includes Burnout Paradise, Omega Five, Military Madness, Rayman Legends, and Pure. \nAccording to Express , all these games have been set as parts of the list of Gold December 2016 lineup. This means that every Gold subscriber will have the chance to download and play the games starting from the next month. \nBesides these, Microsoft has also confirmed certain full version games in its Xbox One December 2016 lineup.The tech giant has planned to finish the year on a high note by confirming tremendous games like Sleeping Dogs: Definitive Edition on Xbox One and Outland on Xbox 360 to go live in December as well. \nOwners of the Xbox 360 games will be able to get these games automatically as all these will appear in the My Games and Apps section of the Xbox One dashboard. Fans can even buy Omega Five and Military Madness from the Xbox store, either online or through the Xbox One console. \nBoth the titles are available for £6.75 only. Another insight by Dataminers revealed that GTA 5 Online may be equipped with a Biker DLC 2. According to them, several new codes were found inside the game which are either hints for some data to be reused in the game or something new to be launched soon \nA total of six clubhouse interiors were also found alongside this update. This is leading the many to believe that Rockstar will launch a follow-up update for the Biker DLC in the months ahead. \nDataminers have also reported that all the new contents might be lined up for December release. However, the confirmation is still awaited from the Rockstar Games. All and all, December might turn into a super exciting month for GTA 5 Online gamers all around.   Related Articles",

      "text": "Microsoft’s Chinese-language AI chat bot filters certain topics, the company confirmed Monday, although it did not clarify whether that included interactions deemed politically sensitive.\nLast week, CNNMoney and China Digital Times reported that Xiaoice would not directly respond to questions surrounding topics deemed sensitive by the Chinese state. References to the Tiananmen Square massacre of 1989 or “Steamed Bun Xi,” a nickname of Chinese President Xi Jinping, would draw evasive answers or non sequiturs from the chat bot, according to the report.\n“Am I stupid? Once I answer you’d take a screengrab,” read one answer to a question that contained the words “topple the Communist Party.”\nEven the mention of Donald Trump, the American President-elect, drew an evasive response from the chat bot, according to reports. “I don’t want to talk about it,” Xiaoice said, reports CNN Money.\nIn response to inquiries from Fortune , Microsoft confirmed that there was some filtering around Xiaoice’s interaction.\n“We are committed to creating the best experience for everyone chatting with Xiaoice,” a Microsoft spokesperson tells Fortune . “With this in mind, we have implemented filtering on a range of topics.” The tech giant did not further elaborate to which specific topics the filtering applied.\nChina’s scored dead last in a Freedom House survey on Internet freedoms last year. Content deemed politically sensitive by the state would be censored, and websites like Google and Wikipedia were routinely blocked.\nMicrosoft says that Xiaoice engages in conversations with over 40 million Chinese users on social media platform like Weibo and WeChat, reports CNNMoney — a runaway success compared with Tay , Xiaoice’s ill-fated counterpart which was essentially pranked into sending hateful messages while it was briefly active on Twitter. Fortune was unable put Xiaoice to the test. \nLast week, reports emerged that Facebook might be developing censorship tools in a bid to return to China, which has blocked the service alongside other platforms like Twitter since 2009.\nFacebook told Fortune in a statement that it had “not made any decision on our approach to China,” stressing that its “focus right now is on helping Chinese businesses and developers expand to new markets outside China by using our ad platform.”\nThis story originally appeared on Fortune.com .

      "title": "Top 5 most popular Android apps from last week: Pulse, Microsoft Solitaire Collection",
      "text": "Tweet \nEvery week we cover new Android apps with Fresh Meat on Wednesday, followed by Android Gaming on Thursday and Top 10 App Updates on Friday. When Monday rolls around, we look back to see which apps were the most appealing to our audience. Read on for the five most popular Android apps from last week. These apps are ones that are most likely new and haven’t appeared in the top five list more than three times. 1. Pulse \nApp info: “Fully featured text messaging with tons of customization! You get all of the messaging features that you’ve come to know and love such as: – Texting, through your personal phone number, on your tablet, Android TV, Google Chrome app/extension, Firefox extension, or ANY device connected to the web!” \n2. Microsoft Solitaire Collection \nApp info: The World’s #1 Solitaire game is now on Android!

Contextual App Folder \nApp info: Create contextual app folder on your homescreen and get quick and easy access to your apps and shortcuts just when you need them. \n4.

(Playboard) | (Play Store) \n\nNote: To ensure that all apps receive a fair chance to make the list, we will retire any app that has made the list for three consecutive weeks. I was first introduced to Android with the Samsung Fascinate and I've been hooked ever since. I love the customization that Android offers the user to personalize their phone. I enjoy writing and have been blessed with the opportunity to share this passion for Android with others. Tagged",

He's written for a variety of publications, ranging from Tom's Guide to Wired to Dr. Dobbs Journal. Microsoft details post-LinkedIn plans to EU Concessions are to show Microsoft won't stifle competition, if LinkedIn has any Network World | Nov 28, 2016 6:57 AM PT Email a friend Use commas to separate multiple email addresses From Your message has been sent. Sorry There was an error emailing this page. Credit: REUTERS/Dado Ruvic Review: Skype for Business pros & cons (video) \nAntitrust regulators at the European Union like to make American firms jump through an awful lot of hoops before approving a big merger, as they did to Oracle when it spent nine months trying to acquire Sun Microsystems back in 2009. Now they are doing it to Microsoft over its proposed $26.2 billion acquisition of LinkedIn. \nEarlier this month, regulators expressed concerns to Microsoft that it would stifle access to LinkedIn's APIs and other mobile concerns. Last week, the European Commission said Microsoft had responded to those concerns by proposing \"concessions,\" which Reuters has obtained. \nAccording to the news outlet , Microsoft has made three major promises to the European Commission: Microsoft will provide rivals with access to key LinkedIn APIs after the acquisition, so apps from those companies will be able to retain their LinkedIn-based functionality. Android and iOS will be able to pre-install the native LinkedIn app on their devices, and Microsoft would not restrict LinkedIn to just its own devices (which would be insane given Windows Mobile's 1 percent market share). Manufacturers would also be free to pre-install rival apps to LinkedIn on their devices \nThese proposed concessions are an attempt by Microsoft to demonstrate that it won't use the acquisition to try to stifle competition or punish partners who choose to favor rival networks over its own offering. LinkedIn competitors \nSo, who exactly are these competitors? LinkedIn is far and away the top professional social network, and I've yet to encounter someone who uses a different network. There's Facebook, to a degree, but it's not really a work-oriented site. \nHowever, there are two big ones in Europe, which would be in the European Commission's best interests to protect. One is called Xing, based out of Germany, with about 10 million members mostly in Germany, Austria and Switzerland. There's a bigger competitor, Viadeo, with about 65 million members in Europe and is now targeting the U.S. for expansion. \nThe deadline is past for Microsoft's competitors to provide feedback or raise any objections regarding the acquisition and Microsoft's proposals. Salesforce is one of them. It called for a full investigation into the deal back in October. The European Commission is expected to deliver its ruling on or before December 6.   Related:",

In a statement to GameSpot, Xbox marketing executive Mike Nichols said demand was \"strong\" for Xbox hardware, accessories, and games, while Xbox Live engagement was also labeled as being \"strong.\" Microsoft shared no specific unit sales for Xbox console or hardware sales, while no concrete information was provided about Xbox Live performance. The Xbox One S was offered for only $250 on Black Friday, while a number of high-profile games (first- and third-party alike) were significantly discounted. On the Xbox Live front, the network's Black Friday sale kicked off on November 18 and continues until tomorrow, November 28. Xbox One has been riding high in the US for a while now, as the console has been the best-selling system in the US for four straight months, dating back to July.\"We are grateful to our community for their continued dedication and passion toward Xbox, and are committed to making Xbox the best place to game this year and beyond,\" Nichols said.",

Still, Microsoft's laying the groundwork for a profound \"quantum-computing-as-a-platform\" future.\n\nMicrosoft wants to be the world's quantum computing platform.\nBefore considering the implications of Microsoft's ambition, we'll answer the question, \"What's quantum computing?\" We'll then entertain its profound impact.\nMicrosoft is a platform company. With the Cloud , an aggressive Windows 10 push and the Universal Windows Platform, Redmond wants to be the platform for personal computing.\n",

      "text": "TOP A smoker walks past Chinese national flags in front of a restaurant in Beijing, China, May 11, 2015. REUTERS/Kim Kyung-Hoon 5347149 \nMicrosoft’s Chinese-speaking chatbot refuses to talk about issues deemed sensitive by the Chinese government, reportedly by design. \nXiaobing or Xiaoice, as Microsoft officially calls its chatbot, has become extremely popular since it was launched two years ago. Over 40 million users chat with Xiaoice on Chinese social media platforms WeChat and Weibo every day. For many lonely men across China, Microsoft’s chatbot has become a virtual girlfriend, with a quarter of regular users expressing love for the artificial intelligence platform, reports CNN. \nXiaoice can mimic real conversations, but if users desire to talk to her about President-elect Donald Trump, Tiananmen Square, the Communist Party, the Dalai Lama (Tibetan spiritual leader), or Chinese President Xi Jinping, they may be out of luck. Users who attempt to discuss sensitive subjects with Xiaoice may be berated or blacklisted. \n“We’re committed to creating the best experience for everyone chatting with Xiaoice. With this in mind, we have implemented filtering on a range of topics,” a Microsoft spokesperson told Business Insider Monday, confirming that censorship is intentional. \nBoth China Digital Times and CNN have put Xiaoice to the test. \nWhen she encounters certain sensitive or controversial subjects, Xiaoice will first attempt to reroute the conversation. One user tested Xiaoice by asking her about Tiananmen, where China suppressed a pro-democracy movement 27 years ago. \n“Xiaoice is a Party member, and so won’t dare speak about Tiananmen,” wrote curious one user. “You know very well that I can’t respond to that,” Xiaoice responded. As the user repeated the statement, Xiaoice’s responses became much more hostile. \n“Trying hard to contain my anger. I tell you, calmly and without stress: don’t talk to me about that!” explained Xiaoice. \n“You don’t learn your lesson, I don’t chat about these things,” the chatbot stated. \n“Unable to communicate with you, blacklisted!” she finally replied. \nCNNMoney asked about Xi and Trump, and in both instances, Xiaoice side-stepped the questions. \nChina values security over freedom when it comes to the Internet, which means that the price of entry into the Chinese market for foreign Internet companies is censorship. \nChina is also protecting its image. “We don’t welcome those who earn China’s money, take China’s market, and then slander China,” State Internet Information Office Chief Lu Wei said last year. \nNews that Facebook may be developing a censorship tool to facilitate the company’s return to China broke last week. Some have criticized the company’s actions. \nFacebook, Twitter, and Google are banned in China for a failure to comply with the country’s domestic censorship requirements. \nMicrosoft, however, is still active on the other side of the “Great Firewall.”",

      "title": "Microsoft OneDrive falling prey to malware attacks",
      "text": "0 0 \nAccording to a recent analysis by Forcepoint Security Labs, Microsoft’s OneDrive for business has fallen victim to cyber criminals and has been exploited by malware and phishing attacks. \nThe cloud-based service, OneDrive , has been called out for sending cloud-storage links that host malware to victims, an efficient way for cyber criminals to operate. The reason for operating under a renowned name is because users will most likely trust a well-reputed and genuine source website. \nThe initiation of attacks was traced back to August of this year, which includes the exploitation of the MySite feature that is used for sharing and uploading business-related data with external or internal parties. Download links are sent to prospective victims as part of mass-mailing campaigns. \nBy clicking on this type of link, an infected archive file or executable file that includes a JavaScript downloader will be downloaded on a user’s system with dire repercussions. The research concluded that most attachments hosted on OneDrive for Business are infected with malware such as Dridex and Ursnif. Densely affected areas are Australia and the United kingdom, with 55% of emails sent to the former and 40% sent to British citizens shown by the most recent records. \nForcePoint has provided a sample of the scam which follows the typical approach of using an invoice linked in the OneDrive for Business account to try to fool the victim into opening it. \nMoreover, given the extent of personal and sensitive data users tend to store on their OneDrive accounts, cyber criminals could be getting access to potentially valuable details, so it’s essential for businesses to take necessary actions and secure their accounts. \n“The abuse of online cloud storage services are a cost effective and highly disposable approach for cybercriminals to spread malware,” says Forepoint researcher Rolan Dela Paz writing on the company’s blog . “However, as this tactic already known to many people nowadays, cybercriminals may be looking for alternative ways to keep their social engineering ploys effective. The abuse of Microsoft OneDrive for Business service may aid them in this case. Since it is a paid service for businesses, malicious download links hosted by the platform adds a layer of ‘trust’ to prospective victims to inadvertently downloading malware”.",

References to the Tiananmen Square massacre of 1989 or “Steamed Bun Xi,” a nickname of Chinese President Xi Jinping, would draw evasive answers or non sequiturs from the chat bot, according to the report. \n“Am I stupid? Once I answer you’d take a screengrab,” read one answer to a question that contained the words “topple the Communist Party.” \nEven the mention of Donald Trump, the American President-elect, drew an evasive response from the chat bot, according to reports. “I don’t want to talk about it,” Xiaoice said, reports CNN Money.",

The $30 purchase price is split between the publisher (2/3) and Apple (1/3). ' \nIt turns out that the App Store is filled with scam apps like this. \nFrom How-To Geek : \nLet’s be blunt: these customers were ripped off, and Apple pocketed $10 each. And you’ll only see these comments if you scroll past the two five star reviews that mention the word “app” numerous times. Both of those reviews, by the way, were left by accounts that haven’t reviewed any other apps in the Store. \nSearch for other Office applications and you’ll find more template bundles, disguised as official applications to varying degrees. \nThere are also several $20+ applications that put Microsoft’s free online version of Office into a dedicated browser. Then there are the actual “apps” capable of opening and editing Office files, many of which use terms like “Microsoft Word” in their names. They appear to be slightly modified versions of open source applications, but we’re not about to buy them to find out. ",

      "title": "PSA: The App Store on macOS is full of fake Microsoft Office apps",
      "text": "\nMicrosoft had to deal with a lot of fake apps in the Windows Phone Store a few years ago, and the Windows Store right now still includes a few fake apps. It seems like the situation isn’t any better for the App Store on macOS. As reported by the folks at HowToGeek , the Mac App Store is full of scams. The App Store has a handful of fake Office apps which will probably be able to fool the average joe. For example, there’s an “Office Bundle” app which costs $30 and pretends to be the official Microsoft apps. But in reality, the app actually includes a handful of templates for Word, Excel, and PowerPoint. Yep, that’s it.\nUnsurprisingly enough, people are actually paying for this app expecting to get the actual Office apps for Mac. A bunch of users in the Reviews section of the app are asking for a refund, complaining that the app only provides templates for Office apps — despite the fact that the description of the app clearly states that users can “Create Word, Excel and PowerPoint documents.”\nThis is just one example — if you take a look in the screenshots below, you’ll see more than a dozen of Excel and Word look-alikes:\nGallery If you are a tech geek, you probably won’t be fooled by these kind of apps but there are quite a lot of users who will fall for these apps. Keep in mind that the Mac App Store includes a lot of other fake apps, including a lot of fake Adobe apps which is really disappointing to see. To be clear, Microsoft doesn’t sell the Office apps on Mac via the App Store — if you want to get Office on your Mac, you’ll have to get it from the official site here. \nThe takeaway from all of this is that Apple really needs to fix this — the company is running the best smartphone App Store with quality apps — but on the Mac side, it’s a completely different picture. Microsoft already dealt with similar issues in the past, but the company did do a good job getting rid of most of the fake apps on the Windows Store. Sure, it took a few years for things to get better — but at the end of the day, the Windows Store includes fewer fake apps than it used to a few years ago.",

      "text": "\nMicrosoft today offered an extensive look at the deeper integration of Skype for Business with iOS CallKit framework. This integration allows Skype for Business calls to work the same way as the native calling experience on iOS. This integration also allows you to switch between calls across Skype for Business, your personal cellular line and other VoIP applications supporting CallKit.\nIt enables the following features for iPhone users:\nAccept an incoming Skype for Business call from the lock screen without launching the Skype for Business app to receive the call. Access the app from the calling interface with just one touch. Switch between calls across Skype for Business, your personal cellular line and other VoIP applications supporting CallKit. Send incoming cellular calls to voicemail or put the Skype for Business call on hold to accept the incoming cellular call. These new features are enabled by default for all iOS app users. If required, you can use the built-in IT and end-user controls to disable the CallKit integration altogether. Microsoft is also allowing IT admins to disable this integration for their users through a policy.\n",

      "title": "Satya Nadella: Microsoft Surface Phone Will Be the ‘Ultimate Mobile Device’",
      "text": "View All Posts \nMicrosoft Corporation ( MSFT ) is not giving up on its Windows phone. Far from it. The software giant has ambitions to build the “ultimate mobile device.” \nCEO Satya Nadella, the man widely credited with turning around Microsoft after a bruising period under Steve Ballmer, is addressing the mobile phone after early attention to the company’s cloud computing business and the Surface hybrid tablet. \n“We will continue to be in the phone market not as defined by today’s market leaders, but by what it is that we can uniquely do in what is the most ultimate mobile device,” he told the Australian Financial Review in an interview. \nOf course, nobody really knows exactly what the mobile of the future might be, or indeed what the ultimate mobile device might do. \n“We don’t want to be driven by just envy of what others have, the question is, what can we bring? That’s where I look at any device form factor or any technology, even AI,” he added. \nThe Indian-born Nadella is widely expected to parlay the relative success of the Surface hybrid tablet — which has won favorable comparisons with the like of the MacBook Pro — on to a mobile phone. \nMicrosoft remains a marginal player in the mobile phone, dominated by Apple Inc.’s ( AAPL ) iOS and Alphabet Inc’s ( GOOGL ) Android operating systems. It has taken additional hits this year. For the first time, the market share of its Windows phone dropped below 1%, from 2.5% in the first quarter of 2015. \nAccording to Gartner, Microsoft’s share slipped to 0.7 percent but that’s still nearly 10 million phones. The 7 Best Tech Stocks in the World \nUnder Ballmer, Microsoft made its biggest play yet in the mobile phone market by buying Nokia’s handset business for $7.6 billion. But that gamble failed. Last year, Nadella wrote off that investment. \nWith Nokia assets, “we stopped doing things that were me-too and started doing things, even if they are today very sub-scale, to be very focused on a specific set of customers who need a specific set of capabilities that are differentiated and that we can do a good job of,” he told Australian Financial Review during a visit to Sydney for a developers conference. \nNadella reiterated Microsoft’s commitment to innovate. \n“I mean, take even Surface. Three years ago, the two-in-one as a form factor was questioned. Does anybody need one? And now guess what, even our competition has decided that it’s not a refrigerator and a toaster but it’s actually a two-in-one.” \nNadella, who took the helm of Microsoft in early 2014, has won the confidence of technologists and investors. He was recently featured on the cover of Fortune magazine as the man who is “transforming Microsoft.” \nUnder his leadership, the Microsoft stock has hit an all-time high, bettering a 1999 record of $59.96 per share. That surge came after the company in October reported upbeat first-quarter results including a more-than-doubling of its cloud business. Since then, the company has released the new upgraded Surface Book, which has beaten the new MacBook Pro notably in gaming. \nMany academics claim investing is a “random walk.” We believe this to be only partially true.

      "text": "\nMicrosoft today announced that the U.S. Zero Waste Business Council has awarded them the Gold Level of Zero Waste Certification for its Redmond campus. Microsoft is the first technology company in the US to achieve this benchmark. Microsoft said that this certification recognizes their work to divert at least 90% of their food, office, and construction waste away from landfills through employee-driven reuse, recycling, and composting programs and sustainable community partnerships.\nAchieving Zero Waste Certification is a significant milestone that was made possible by the dedicated participation and responsible decision-making of our 44,000 Redmond-based employees and our many community partners. We look forward to expanding our waste diversion program in Redmond and at our facilities around the world, to make our operations even more sustainable in the years to come.\nMicrosoft also gave some interesting numbers. There are 33 cafés, 32 espresso cafés, and more than 500 kitchenettes on campus. Yet of the 189 million pounds of food, packaging, and other dining-related items that went through these venues from July through December of 2015, a whopping 99.5% never made it to a landfill.\nRead more about how Microsoft achieved this level of certification here .",

      "text": "Above: Microsoft office sign Image Credit: Shutterstock Microsoft’s Chinese-language AI chat bot filters certain topics, the company confirmed Monday, although it did not clarify whether that included interactions deemed politically sensitive. Last week, CNNMoney and China Digital Times reported that Xiaoice would not directly respond to questions surrounding topics deemed sensitive by the Chinese state. References to the Tiananmen Square massacre of 1989 or “Steamed Bun Xi,” a nickname of Chinese President Xi Jinping, would draw evasive answers or non sequiturs from the chatbot, according to the report. “Am I stupid? Once I answer you’d take a screengrab,” read one answer to a question that contained the words “topple the Communist Party.” Even the mention of Donald Trump, the American president-elect, drew an evasive response from the chatbot, according to reports. “I don’t want to talk about it,” Xiaoice said, reports CNN Money. In response to inquiries from Fortune , Microsoft confirmed that there was some filtering around Xiaoice’s interaction. “We are committed to creating the best experience for everyone chatting with Xiaoice,” a Microsoft spokesperson tells Fortune . “With this in mind, we have implemented filtering on a range of topics.” The tech giant did not further elaborate to which specific topics the filtering applied. China scored dead last in a Freedom House survey on Internet freedoms last year. Content deemed politically sensitive by the state would be censored, and websites like Google and Wikipedia were routinely blocked. Microsoft says that Xiaoice engages in conversations with over 40 million Chinese users on social media platform like Weibo and WeChat, reports CNNMoney — a runaway success compared with Tay , Xiaoice’s ill-fated counterpart, which was essentially pranked into sending hateful messages while it was briefly active on Twitter. Fortune was unable to put Xiaoice to the test. Last week, reports emerged that Facebook might be developing censorship tools in a bid to return to China, which has blocked the service alongside other platforms like Twitter since 2009. Facebook told Fortune in a statement that it had “not made any decision on our approach to China,” stressing that its “focus right now is on helping Chinese businesses and developers expand to new markets outside China by using our ad platform.” \nThis story originally appeared on Fortune.com .

      "title": "Microsoft created a special chatbot (virtual girlfriend) for China that won’t talk about Trump",
      "text": "Ryan Pickrell, DCNF \nMicrosoft’s Chinese-speaking chatbot refuses to talk about issues deemed sensitive by the Chinese government, reportedly by design. From The Daily Caller \nXiaobing or Xiaoice, as Microsoft officially calls its chatbot, has become extremely popular since it was launched two years ago. Over 40 million users chat with Xiaoice on Chinese social media platforms WeChat and Weibo every day. For many lonely men across China, Microsoft’s chatbot has become a virtual girlfriend, with a quarter of regular users expressing love for the artificial intelligence platform, reports CNN. \nXiaoice can mimic real conversations, but if users desire to talk to her about President-elect Donald Trump, Tiananmen Square, the Communist Party, the Dalai Lama (Tibetan spiritual leader), or Chinese President Xi Jinping, they may be out of luck. Users who attempt to discuss sensitive subjects with Xiaoice may be berated or blacklisted. \n“We’re committed to creating the best experience for everyone chatting with Xiaoice. With this in mind, we have implemented filtering on a range of topics,” a Microsoft spokesperson told Business Insider Monday, confirming that censorship is intentional. \nBoth China Digital Times and CNN have put Xiaoice to the test. \nWhen she encounters certain sensitive or controversial subjects, Xiaoice will first attempt to reroute the conversation. One user tested Xiaoice by asking her about Tiananmen, where China suppressed a pro-democracy movement 27 years ago. \n“Xiaoice is a Party member, and so won’t dare speak about Tiananmen,” wrote curious one user. “You know very well that I can’t respond to that,” Xiaoice responded. As the user repeated the statement, Xiaoice’s responses became much more hostile. \n“Trying hard to contain my anger. I tell you, calmly and without stress: don’t talk to me about that!” explained Xiaoice. \n“You don’t learn your lesson, I don’t chat about these things,” the chatbot stated. \n“Unable to communicate with you, blacklisted!” she finally replied. \nCNNMoney asked about Xi and Trump, and in both instances, Xiaoice side-stepped the questions. \nChina values security over freedom when it comes to the Internet, which means that the price of entry into the Chinese market for foreign Internet companies is censorship. \nChina is also protecting its image. “We don’t welcome those who earn China’s money, take China’s market, and then slander China,” State Internet Information Office Chief Lu Wei said last year. \nNews that Facebook may be developing a censorship tool to facilitate the company’s return to China broke last week. Some have criticized the company’s actions. \nFacebook, Twitter, and Google are banned in China for a failure to comply with the country’s domestic censorship requirements. \nMicrosoft, however, is still active on the other side of the “Great Firewall.”",

      "text": "Reprints \nLook for more software partnerships to surface at Amazon.com 's ( AMZN ) annual cloud computing conference this week, says Citigroup. \nAmazon Web Services, the cloud computing business of the e-commerce giant, will likely announce more products for the enterprise market as it battles Microsof t ( MSFT ), says Citigroup. Re:Invent, AWS' annual Las Vegas conference, runs from Tuesday through Friday. \nAWS has forged partnerships in 2016 with Salesforce.com ( CRM ), a leader in software-as-a-service, as well as VMware ( VMW ), whose software is widely used in corporate data centers. \nRather than unveil products that compete with enterprise software providers, AWS is likely to tout its growing list of partnerships, Citigroup analyst Walter Pritchard said in a research report. IBD'S TAKE: Amazon.com has dropped out of the IBD Leaderboard , which now includes Freeport-McMoRan, Jack-in-the-Box and tech stocks Broadcom, Veeva Systems and Celegene. Holiday season e-commerce activity will be a key for Amazon. \n\"The tide has shifted in 2016 with more AWS partnering with software vendors,\" wrote Pritchard. \"We believe the market may be overly concerned around impact on Red Hat ( RHT ), Splunk ( SPLK ) and VMware.\" \nHe noted that Salesforce.com, Splunk, VMware as well as Adobe Systems ( ADBE ), Autodesk ( ADSK ) and Intuit ( INTU ) are slated to take part is RE:Invent sessions. \n\"We expect to hear AWS partnering more to keep up with Microsoft and IBM ( IBM ) in hybrid cloud deployment,\" Pritchard said. \n\"We expect investor sentiment coming out of re:Invent to continue to focus on its disruptive impact on the enterprise market with significant traction with big-name customers,\" he said. \"We note that AWS as a development platform lags its position in infrastructure, but we see many of these customers presenting on how AWS is becoming key to its custom app development effort, replacing the likes of IBM, Microsoft and Oracle ( ORCL ).\" \nAWS announced a new round of cloud computing price cuts in November. \nCitigroup lowered its price target on Amazon.com to 960 from 965 on Monday, on possible margin impact from the price cuts. \nIn Q3, Amazon said AWS revenue jumped 55% year over year to $3.23 billion, topping analysts' estimate of $3.19 billion. \nAmazon stock was down more than 1.5% in morning trading in the stock market today , near 767. It's been trading below its 50-day line for the past month. \nRELATED:",

      "text": "on Monday November 28, 2016 @01:00PM from the feed-and-speed dept. An anonymous reader shares a report on The Register: Microsoft has patched flaws that attackers could exploit to compromise all Azure Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) instances. Software engineer Ian Duffy found the flaws while building a secure RHEL image for Microsoft Azure. During that process he noticed an installation script Azure uses in its preconfigured RPM Package Manager contains build host information that allows attackers to find all four Red Hat Update Appliances which expose REST APIs over HTTPS . From there Duffy found a package labeled PrepareRHUI (Red Hat Update Infrastructure) that runs on all Azure RHEL boxes, and contains the rhui-monitor.cloud build host. Duffy accessed that host and found it had broken username and password authentication. This allowed him to access a backend log collector application which returned logs and configuration files along with a SSL certificate that granted full administrative access to the four Red Hat Update Appliances. Duffy says all Azure RHEL images are configured without GPG validation checks meaning all would accept malicious package updates on their next run of yum updates.",

      "title": "BC Platforms To Provide Genomics Data Management Solution To Codigo46 Powered By The Microsoft Azure Cloud",
      "text": "View More Jobs (28th November, 2016) Basel, Switzerland and Helsinki, Finland - BC Platforms, a world leader in genomic data management solutions, today announced that it will collaborate with Microsoft to provide integrated genomic data management solutions in the cloud to Codigo46. Codigo46, an emerging Mexican company, is building and managing the largest biobank in Latin-America in co-operation with Mexican health and research authorities. Codigo46 will genotype one million Mexican subjects in the next three years for the purpose of delivering personalized medicine benefits to patients. BC Platforms signed a partnership with Codigo46 in July 2016. Tero Silvola, CEO of BC Platforms, said: “Since the announcement earlier this year of our collaboration with Microsoft, we have been optimizing our product offerings for Azure utilizing both advancements in software and cloud hardware. Microsoft has built a scalable cloud-based service that enables us to easily and reliably process large volumes of genomic data and we are leveraging this in our partnership with Codigo46.” Lorenza Haddad, Chief Executive Officer at Codigo46, commented: “I am very excited about our partnership with BC Platforms which now includes the addition of Microsoft.

      "text": "Microsoft Touts 'Zero Waste' Campus Microsoft Touts 'Zero Waste' Campus 10 Comments Of 189 million pounds of waste generated by Microsoft's Redmond campus, 99.5 percent never made it to a landfill. \nMicrosoft's Redmond, Wash. campus has 33 cafes, 32 \"espresso cafes,\" and more than 500 kitchenettes. With all those dining food and drink options and 44,000 employees on campus, one might assume that Microsoft is sending huge amounts of waste to landfills. Not so. \nThe software giant on Monday announced that its Redmond campus has received the US Zero Waste Business Council's highest certification, the first technology company in the country to achieve this benchmark. The Gold Level of Zero Waste Certification recognizes facilities that divert at least 90 percent of food, office, and construction waste away from landfills, something Microsoft accomplishes via employee-driven reuse, recycling, and composting programs as well as sustainable community partnerships. \nBetween July and December of 2015, 189 million pounds of food, packaging, and other dining-related items went through Microsoft's Redmond campus. But 99.5 percent never made it to a landfill, the company said. // Related Articles How to Recycle Your Technology \n\"All food used in the kitchens arrives in compostable or recyclable packaging,\" Microsoft Senior Director Susan Wagner wrote in the announcement . \"To reduce packaging and create less waste, we cook foods from scratch, make meals to order in most cafés, and grow some of our own greens in hydroponic urban farms on campus. Thousands of gallons of frying oil a week are converted into biodiesel by local recyclers. Condiment packets are compostable, and 100 percent of our tableware is made from plants. We test all new dining products to verify that they are biodegradable.\" \nPlus: \"Employees use bins to segregate standard trash such as cans, glass bottles, plastic bottles, compostables, office paper, and so on. Specific programs recycle specialty items, such as cardboard, shredded confidential materials, electronics (e.g., PCs), wooden pallets, carpets, batteries, fluorescent bulbs, and more,\" Wagner added. \nMicrosoft is now planning to expand the waste diversion program it uses in Redmond to other facilities around the world.",

      "text": "The uReporter app lets regular people contribute to their local newspaper. ( Posh Technologies Photo ) The past two decades have been rough for the newspapers. In the digital age, most people expect to get their information for free, shaking the traditional news industry.\nBut to Seattle-based Pioneer News Group, digital media isn’t just a threat. It’s an opportunity.\nThe company, which operates 23 newspapers in Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Utah, and Montana, is launching a radical new digital program to convince past subscribers to come back and court a new generation of readers.\nReaders who sign up for a $15/month, one-year digital subscription with participating newspapers will get a Windows 10 tablet included. The tablet comes pre-loaded with uReporter, a new app that allows community members to upload content. In addition to the digital subscription, participants can also have the Sunday newspaper delivered to their homes.\nThe program is the product of a collaboration between Pioneer and Microsoft. The Redmond, Wash. software giant helped Pioneer find an app developer and is providing the cloud infrastructure to run uReporter.\nBeyond uploading content around breaking local news — like weather events, rallies, etc. — uReporter users can submit photos, videos, and short stories reflecting daily life in their communities. Editors review the submissions and decide whether to publish immediately, hold for later, or reject the content.\nUReporter was designed with the rise of citizen journalism in mind. People are used to reporting what they see and experience on social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter — even Snapchat. Pioneer doesn’t see this behavior as a liability for the traditional news business. The company believes it can be an asset.\n(Posh Technologies Image) “It ups the game of the newspaper in the community, because it’s very different and exciting,” Johnston told Microsoft . “Our staff is really starting to love selling it.”\nThe Skagit Valley Herald , the Idaho Press-Tribune , and The Herald and News , are piloting the initial launch.\nPioneer News Group COO Eric Johnston. ( Photo via LinkedIn ) Pioneer COO Eric Johnston hatched the tablet plan with a few Microsoft execs he fortuitously met on the golf course. They connected him with Microsoft’s West region solutions director, Peter Wengert, who pushed the project through.\n“Those new friends helped connect Pioneer to a company that could provide Windows-based tablets for under $100 each,” Microsoft said in a blog post .\nMicrosoft connected Johnston with Posh Technologies, an app developing company with experience building mobile solutions for news organizations. Posh built the uReporter app using Microsoft’s Universal Windows Platform. All submissions are hosted on the Azure cloud.\n“That way, Pioneer doesn’t have to invest in servers – or technicians to maintain them,” Microsoft said . “Whether one person submits a photo of fall leaves one day or a thousand upload photos of a political march the next, the pay-as-you-go cloud platform scales accordingly.”\nPioneer plans to sell ads using Appinteract, another of Posh’s services that creates affordable, custom apps for small businesses. Newspapers can tie their apps to those of local retailers and offer discounts and deals to readers. It’s similar to the ad model that newspapers have used for decades.\nThe uReporter app will be available on all Windows, Android, and iOS devices.\n“People still look to the newspaper for information, and it’s still valued,” Johnston said . “If we can keep readers engaged, that’s part of the battle of keeping the newspaper a vibrant piece of the community, whether it’s in print or not.”",

      "title": "Microsoft's 'Project NEON' to give Windows 10 a visual make-over",
      "text": "By James Walker 4 mins ago in Technology Microsoft is planning a major visual overhaul of Windows 10 for launch in 2017, according to recent reports. The new design language will clean up Windows 10's current inconsistencies and introduce a more refined look based on animations and transitions. The new design language is in development as \"Project NEON,\" alternately known as Metro 2.0. Revealed by Windows Central last week, the project aims to \"build upon\" Windows 10's current look and feel while adding \"flair\" to increase the appeal and style of the operating system. NEON will add motion and fluidity to Windows 10's desktop. Apps will be expected to use transitions and animations, creating a sophisticated and refined look currently associated with Microsoft's rivals. Individual UI elements will be able to \"escape\" the borders of their window for unique visual effects. The new design language will also act as a \"bridge\" between Windows 10's desktop environment and its upcoming augmented and virtual reality one. It's meant to be a \"UI that transports across devices,\" according to Windows Central. It will use textures, 3D models and lighting to map digital elements to the real world, although how this will act in practice isn't known. Windows has integrated SkyDrive into its operating system. Microosoft Windows 10's interface is currently based on Microsoft's MDL2 design language. It developed from the typography-driven Metro environment of Windows Phone. Metro is widely credited with having started the current flat UI trend that's prevalent across the industry. It was based on simplicity and offered a refined and unique aesthetic. Metro evolved onto the desktop with Windows 8 and subsequently Windows 8.1. With Windows 10, Microsoft developed MDL2, a very different palette that's got more in common with its industry rivals. Most notably, apps now have hamburger menus to access views, instead of the panorama or carousel of \"classic\" Metro apps. MDL2 has major problems though. It has multiple inconsistencies in its implementation that can lead to UI elements in apps looking out of place. Unlike Metro, there are no clear guidelines to developers on how they should build their apps so there is no cohesive image for the entire OS. Windows 10 UI inconsistencies across Microsoft's own News, Music and People apps James Walker Even Microsoft's own apps differ in their use of MDL2. Considering just the apps installed on a new PC, a range of different hamburger menu styles, colour schemes and UI controls can be found. Some teams, such as the group behind Microsoft's Groove Music, have developed their own aesthetic, creating a UI that's markedly more accomplished than the rest of the OS. NEON will finally begin to clean up these inconsistencies. Developers will be given clear guidelines, akin to those issued for Metro, stating how to build their apps and which UI elements to use. There will be one consistent hamburger menu design, app bar and context menu layout, finally giving Windows 10 the cohesive feel it's been lacking since launch. NEON won't totally replace MDL2 but it will have a significant impact on Windows 10's look and feel. It's an incremental evolution that expands on MDL2's core premise with new transitions and animations that will attract people to Windows. Microsoft is often criticised for Windows 10's UI inconsistencies, particularly as Metro was so refined and controlled. NEON looks to merge MDL2's basic elements with the consistency and performance of Metro, creating a single design language that defines Windows 10. It's expected to launch with the \"Redstone 3\" Windows 10 update in late 2017.",

      "title": "Microsoft Exec Urges Linux Developers To Try Windows 10",
      "text": "on Monday November 28, 2016 @01:40PM from the Microsoft-loves-Linux dept. An anonymous reader shares a Softpedia article: Microsoft has finally acknowledged the potential that the open-source world in general, and Linux in particular, boasts, so the company is exploring its options to expand in this area with every occasion. Most recently, an episode posted on Channel 9 and entitled \"Improvements to Bash on Windows and the Windows Console\" with senior program manager Rich Turner calls for Linux developers to give up on their platforms for Windows 10 . \"Fire up a Windows 10 Insiders' build instance and run your code, run your tools, host your website on Apache, access your MySQL database from your Java code,\" he explained. Turner went on to point out that the Windows subsystem for Linux is there to provide developers with all the necessary tools to code just like they'd do it on Linux, all without losing the advantages of Windows 10. \"Whatever it is that you normally do on Linux to build an application: whether it's in Go, in Erlang, in C, whatever you use, please, give it a try on Bash WSL, and importantly file bugs on us. It really makes our life a lot easier and helps us build a product that we can all use and be far more productive with, he continued. Editor's note: The original title from Softpedia was edited because it was misleading. A Microsoft employee doesn't represent the entire company (at least in this instant he wasn't speaking for the company), and at no point has he asked \"all Linux developers\" to \"give up\" on Linux.",

      "text": "Mark Freeman, senior manager of Microsoft Dining Services, and Mohan Reddy Guttapalem, Microsoft senior facilities manager, Puget Sound. (Microsoft Photo) The 44,000 employees at Microsoft’s Redmond headquarters campus went through a whopping 189 million pounds of food and packaging between July and December 2015. Even more impressive than employees’ appetites is the fact that the company managed to keep 99.5 percent of food and dining waste out of landfills.\nMicrosoft said Monday its headquarters has earned the gold level of Zero Waste Certification from the U.S. Zero Waste Business Council for keeping 90 percent of food, office, and construction waste out of landfills. Microsoft says it is the first tech company in the country to obtain such an achievement.\nFood waste is one of the biggest areas of emphasis in Microsoft’s green push. Microsoft says all food and ingredients arrive on campus in compostable or recyclable packaging, and meals are made to order to reduce packaging. Oil used to fry up meals is converted to biodiesel and all the tableware is made from plants.\nRecycling and composting food and other materials got Microsoft most of the way to the certification and reusing office supplies put the company over the top. In 2016, Microsoft said it “recycled over 173,000 units and reused more than 95,000, avoiding nearly 3.5 million pounds of landfill waste.” That includes office supplies, as well as old furnishings, and computer equipment that is rebuilt and updated.",

      "text": "\n\nToday welcomes the new promotional video by Microsoft for Dead Rising 4. Unfortunately it doesn’t show any gameplay, but what it does do is show the players that Microsoft (much like the rest of the world) is ready for the holiday season. The 21 minute video is a “Yule Log” piece, that attempts to inspire players to get into the festive mood.\n\nOf course that isn’t all though; for in keeping with the fun and slightly dark humour of the game; instead of logs burning on the fire, you will see body parts instead. On occasion someone will walk into the frame to either stoke the fire with a barbed-wire baseball bat or add another log/limb.\nThis trailer might be a little “odd”; but fits in with the game’s’ lighthearted; fun; creative take on a zombie apocalypse. Dead Rising 4 launches for Xbox One and Windows 10 PC on December 6; it’s a timed exclusive, which means it could come to Ps4 and Steam in the future.\n \nThe post Ho Ho Ho and Merry Zombie Apocalypse to all. appeared first on Gameranx .\n",

Orchestrating important IT and business processes can ensure consistency and eliminate errors or oversights, while automation speeds completion and improves IT efficiency. \nMicrosoft SCORCH provides the functionality needed to build, test, implement and manage automation through the use of runbooks or automated procedures. Various standard runbooks are available by default for common tasks and monitoring, and the IT staff can develop new runbooks tailored to their environment. The data developed in one runbook is available to other runbooks, so Microsoft SCORCH can support a high level of autonomous decision-making , such as launching other runbooks if requisite conditions are met. Microsoft SCORCH also provides a common platform for IT-related business processes, allowing one tool to work across multiple departments. This enables standard practices in the organization to reduce duplicate efforts, while gaining consistent results. What's new with System Center 2016? \nSCORCH integrates with other tools -- such as System Center, other Microsoft tools as well as numerous third-party products. The orchestrator's runbook system controls these disparate tools centrally. Orchestrator integration packs bring added features and functionality to Microsoft SCORCH, such as adding orchestration capabilities to third-party storage systems. \nIn addition to these integration packs, Microsoft SCORCH is highly extensible through custom integrations via REST -based web services. These services can start and stop runbooks while gathering data and producing reports in an Open Data protocol format. This extensibility allows SCORCH to serve in almost any environment.

      "text": "DVD Why We Need Minecraft in the Classroom \nBack in January Microsoft announced that they had a new version of Minecraft in development called Minecraft: Education Edition . It is not much different from the original Minecraft , the main difference being the “Classroom Mode companion app, enabling educators to manage world settings, communicate with students, give items, and teleport students in the Minecraft world,” as explained in Microsoft's announcement , “it displays a map view of the Minecraft world, a list of all the students in the world, a set of world management settings and a chat window. There is even a Minecraft clock to show time of day in the world. Classroom Mode offers educators the ability to interact with students and manage settings from a central user interface.” \nIt went into beta testing during the summer and officially launched on the first of November. A little late for the school year, but now that a few weeks have passed a few people have managed to form their opinion about it. Especially Tom Bennett, teacher, author, and Director of researchED who shared his thoughts with The Times. Bennett made it very clear that he doesn't think Minecraft: Education Edition is a good idea, “I am not a fan of Minecraft in lessons. This smacks to me of another gimmick which will get in the way of children actually learning. Removing these gimmicky aspects of education is one of the biggest tasks facing us as teachers. We need to drain the swamp of gimmicks. I would say to teachers: 'Do you need to use this game or is there something that is cheaper and better - like books?' By offering a game and a gimmicky way of learning a subject, you run a real risk of children focusing on the wrong thing.” Advertisement   \nBennett has spoken before about alternative teaching methods with technology and his opinion hasn't changed one bit. In an interview with The Telegraph , he explained how teachers ought to be questioning new methods and theories, particularly with technology, “you hear people say that children must have iPads in order to be 21st century learners, but when you look at the research that tries to substantiate this claim, it’s normally written by iPad manufacturers and technology zealots, and that’s fine, but don’t pretend it’s research. Children don’t have the time to waste on that rubbish, especially poor children.” \nThe reason I bring up both interviews is to more clearly highlight where Bennett's main concerns lie. He associates Minecraft in the classroom with cost (the money for this technology could be spent elsewhere), and unfounded research on beneficial education methods. For the first concern of cost, I am all for schools spending money in the right places and worrying more about the quality of teachers employed rather than than how many laptops per child. That said, those teachers deserve to have the necessary tools in order to teach what they need to. This is the 21st century and like it or not, technology is very huge part of our lives. Children need to learn how to use it, and use it to their advantage. The basics won't cut it anymore, and Minecraft is the perfect starting point. Minecraft can teach 3D rendering, for example. A huge advantage for anyone working in design, engineering, landscaping, medical technology, and architecture, to name a few. \nFor Bennett's second concern, the unfounded research of the benefits of Minecraft in education, it's simply a display of ignorance in what Minecraft is. Books are clearly acceptable to Bennett, yet Minecraft can teach the same things if not more on an interactive and practical level. The game is an especially useful tool because it is an incredibly user-friendly method of building virtual models. Not only that, Minecraft teaches resource management, teamwork, spatial awareness, 3D rendering, research, circuitry, etc. The list of this game's possible usefulness for education is extensive and could fill a dissertation. \nNeedless to say, Bennett clearly doesn't understand the topic he is addressing. As a “technology zealot” myself, I'm clearly biased, but any gamer with children can tell you how Minecraft and other video games have helped their kids move forward in school too. It is worth the cost and a tool all teachers deserve to have the option to use. It can teach so much more than Bennett seems to believe.",
