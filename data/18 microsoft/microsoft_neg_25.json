If it is, your wireless router may be too slow to handle the feature. You’ll need to purchase a new one or stay wired to your network when using game streaming.

Local playback is great for planes, trains and other situations where connecting to Microsoft’s servers isn’t a possibility.\nEven with recent updates, sometimes Movies & TV simply won’t start streaming the content that users have purchased. When this happens, complete close the app by clicking on the X in the top-right corner of your screen. Touch users should swipe their finger downward from the top edge of their screen and tap the Close button in the right corner.\nStarting the app up again should fix the issue.\nCommon Windows 10 Problems: Start Menu Won’t Open (New) There are some problems that have plagued Windows 10 since its launch in 2015.

      "text": "Xbox One sales dominate PS4 sales in the last 4 months Microsoft Xbox One out sells Sony PlayStation 4 from July through to November 2016 Comment | Email to a Friend | Font Size: A A \nThe Microsoft Xbox One has once again for the fourth month in a row, outsold the Sony PlayStation 4. Originally when the two consoles became available for public purchase three years ago, the Xbox One fell behind as the PS4 triumphed in sales. \nThough July 2016 saw that triumph turn around and favor Microsoft. The Xbox One was slashed in price, for the up and coming Xbox One S console. With that price drop, the Xbox One was able to overturn sales and outsell the PS4 right through to November 2016. \nNo doubt the two powerhouse companies are well-known rivals on console sales, with the release of the Xbox One S and PS4 Pro, it's uncertain to say who whether or not Microsoft will remain on top with their console sales?",

      "text": "\nThe retrenchment of tens of thousands of ex-Nokia employees had an unexpected side effect of reducing the percentage of women Microsoft employees from 26.8 percent of the company’s workforce to 25.8 percent as of Sept. 30 2016.\nThe rest of Microsoft’s diversity stats did not look much better, with the percentage of African American/Black and Hispanic/Latino employees seeing “very modest gains” of 0.2 percent to 3.7 percent of Microsoft’s total workforce and 0.1 percent to 5.5 percent of employees, respectively.\n“The modest gains for people of color — those are so slight I really want to see them improve,” said Gwen Houston, the company’s chief diversity and inclusion officer. “That’s an area of focus that I am really committed to.”\nCEO Satya Nadella has made diversity a key priority for the company and is expected to detail a plan to make diversity goals one of the factors in whether senior executives get their full annual bonuses, Houston said.\nBesides tying diversity goals to bonuses Microsoft has a number of initiatives to address the issue.\nMicrosoft has added human resources workers with experience in diversity and Nadella funded the tripling of an internship program called Explorer for college freshman and sophomores interested in technology, Houston said. The company is also running focus groups in several U.S. cities with underrepresented groups to ask participants what would motivate them to choose careers in tech. The results will be used to improve advertising and recruiting campaigns.\nHouston said she’s encouraged by an increase in women in technical and leadership positions, as well as in recent hiring trends.\nNew hires of women and racial minorities has increased, with women now represented 27.7 percent of new hires this year and 21.7 percent of those hired for technical jobs. Of the new employees, 6.6 percent were African American/Black and 7 percent were Hispanic/Latino.\nSome may question the benefits of expending so much effort on workforce diversity, but several studies have shown that a diverse workforce can have a significant impact on the bottom line and shareholder value .\n\nA 2013 study by the New York-based Center for Talent Innovation (CTI) for example involving more than 40 case studies and 1,800 employee surveys found that publicly traded companies with more race and gender diversity were 45 per cent more likely than those without to have expanded market share in the past year and 70 per cent more likely to have captured a new market. When teams had one or more members who represented a target end-user, the entire team was as much as 158 per cent more likely to understand that target end-user and innovate accordingly.\nAnother American Sociological Association study found that for every 1 per cent rise in the rate of gender diversity and ethnic diversity in a workforce there is a 3 and 9 per cent rise in sales revenue, respectively.\n“Diversity and inclusion is something you’ve got to ingrain, you’ve got to keep talking about the business value, you’ve got to keep talking about the impact,” Houston said. “That’s what Satya has been doing. We, of course, have more to do.”",

      "text": "By Rich Woods Neowin LLC @@TheRichWoods · 5 seconds ago \nYesterday, Microsoft released Windows 10 for PCs build 14965 to the Slow ring , and as expected, the company is offering ISO images beginning today. This is the second time that the firm has released ISOs of a Creators Update preview, with the first being 14931 . \nIn addition to standard Windows 10 for PCs, you can download the following editions of the OS: \nWindows 10 Insider Preview Enterprise is built to address the needs of large and midsize organizations, and comes with the management tools that IT administrators need. \nWindows 10 Insider Preview Education is built for students and faculty, and comes with the management tools that IT administrators need. \nWindows 10 Insider Preview Home Single Language is built for consumers in emerging markets and can only run a single language. \nWindows 10 Insider Preview Home China is built for consumers in China and is delivered in Simplified Chinese. \nIf you're looking to do a clean install of the Creators Update preview, this would be the way to do it. Once you do, make sure you enroll your PC in the Insider Preview, as if you don't, you might not get your monthly Slow ring builds, and 14965 will eventually expire. \nIf you've got a Windows phone in the Slow ring, you've finally got a Creators Update build as well, as Microsoft finally released 14965 for Windows 10 Mobile today . \nIf you want to grab an ISO, you can do it right here .

      "text": "  latest episode of Microsoft’s Modern Workplace is out, and it deals with an issue that everyone has to approach at some point in their lives: the generation gap. Since Modern Workplace is a show that focuses on work environments, this episode mostly focuses on the impact of the generation gap in the work force. \nThe episode features an interview with Jamie McLellan, CTO of J. Walter Thompson, and takes some time to focus on Microsoft Teams . \nThe episode focuses on how we should stop focusing on the “negatives” of each generation, and instead see how the strengths of each generation can come together to create a team with tons of insight. It’s a pretty interesting watch if you’re trying to manage a multi-generation team, or even if you’re just interested in how young and old professionals can come together to make great teams. \nIf you want to watch this episode of Modern Workplace and all previous episodes, you need to register for it . You don’t need to pay anything in order to register – you just need to enter your work email, and a couple of things about your company.  ",

      "text": "0 0 \nBrowsing through Microsoft’s forum, we noticed there is one term that caught the attention of many people: ScanGuard . Most users believe this software is actually a malicious program and avoid installing it on their machines. \nOther Windows users aren’t sure whether ScanGuard is a virus or not, and simply want to gather more information about it. So, is ScanGuar malicious or not? ScanGuard Antivirus puzzles Windows users \nDo not use this, I believe it to be a scam. The first trick is it is free——-oh no it aint, sooner or later your brain will ask just how much is this going to cost me, carry on at your peril ! If you do back out (common sense kicks in) make absolutely sure you can delete it all in its entirety. \nScanGuard is a PC clean-up and optimization tool . Since it’s a very new program, there is not much information available about it. All data indicates that ScanGuard was rolled out in September, but the fact that its creators have yet to provide potential users with more details is, indeed, worrisome. However, the tool’s official website appears to be genuine, although this is not a solid evaluation criterion. \nScanGuard is free to install, but it comes with a yearly subscription of $49.00. As far as users’ feedback is concerned, it appears ScanGuard leaves much to be desired because its behavior is similar to a malware’s . Here’s what one user reports : \nBeware this Scanguard software. If you don’t purchase the removal tools after it finds multiple problems on your computer it will then take over your computer via the Edge browser and threaten to lock it. \nOther users report that while well-known antivirus solutions can’t detect any threats on their machines, ScanGuard comes up with a long list of potential threats. \nbig scam not free. found loads of malware a on my computer that had just been scanned and found to be safe and clear, but they come up with loads of preinstalled alerts about infections that just are not there. then they expect you to buy it to clear your fictitious malware, not Free just a scam don’t use it. \nIn a nutshell, we don’t recommend ScanGuard to anyone. There are many user testimonials that point to its malware-like behavior. Another fishy element is the lack of reaction of the company behind ScanGuard Antivirus. Most user reviews are negative, yet ScanGuard has yet to issue any comments on the situation. \nWhile no cybersecurity company has confirmed that ScanGuard is a malware, the tool’s unstable behavior doesn’t recommend it for use. \nRELATED STORIES YOU NEED TO CHECK OUT:",

      "text": "  \nYesterday marked the one-year milestone for Microsoft Graph since it became generally available. It also kicked the annual developer’s digital conference Connect(). This wasn’t a coincidence; Microsoft Graph was launched just last year during the Connect() conference and since then has grown 35% in usage month over month with 47,000 third party applications created for it. It even processed over 1 billion API transactions over the last month. \nMicrosoft Graph has been expanding the set of scenarios it covers, adding more of OneDrive, SharePoint, Planner, Excel, and OneNote. Intelligence features have been added, making it possible to get at the insights around ad-hoc working relationships and trending files in an organization — that also happen to power the ever-useful MyAnalytics (formerly Delve). Microsoft Graph does this all while simplifying the developer experience via a simple, consistent API surface and a rich set of developer SDKs. \nConnect() is expected to continue its celebration of the growing success of Microsoft Graph as it continues for the next two days. In fact, they are encouraging developers to learn more about developing applications for the service through their current event. \nLater today, an Office Extensibility on-demand session will be taking place where teams will share more about the services and insights that make their products tick. A look into developing for Microsoft Graph, Teams, Outlook, and SharePoint is all expected. If you’re interested in developing, be sure to tune in at 4:00 p.m. PT to Channel 9.  ",

      "text": "  Windows 10 Creator Update Insider Preview Build 14971 Released for PC in Fast Ring \nMicrosoft released Windows 10 Insider Preview Build 14971 for PC to Windows Insiders in the Fast ring today on Nov. 17, 2016. Since anything released after Build 14800 is considered as Creators Update, what’s new you see in this new build will likely be available in the final release. \nHere are some of the new things released in Build 14971: Read ePub Books in Edge \nMicrosoft Edge is the first browser that supports ePub format out of the box. You can now read any unprotected ebook in the EPUB file format with Microsoft Edge. When you open an unprotected e-book in Microsoft Edge, you will be taken into a customizable reading experience where you can change the font and text size and choose between 3 themes: light, sepia, and dark. \nWhen you open an unprotected e-book in Microsoft Edge, you will be taken into a customizable reading experience where you can change the font and text size and choose between 3 themes: light, sepia, and dark. \nAs you read, you can leave bookmarks, use the table of contents or seek bar at the bottom of the browser to navigate through the book. You can also search for words or phrases, or even use Cortana as the dictionary to find the meaning of the words. Paint 3D Preview \nStarting with this build and going forward, the Paint 3D Preview app is now included as part of Windows 10. Opening Paint from Start will now take you to the Paint 3D Preview app. PowerShell in the Shell \nPowerShell is now the default command shell from File Explorer. It replaces Command Prompt (aka, “cmd.exe”) in the WIN + X menu, in File Explorer’s File menu, and in the context menu that appears when you shift-right-click the whitespace in File Explorer. \nYou can still opt out to use Command Prompt by default by going to Settings → Personalization → Taskbar and turning the “Replace Command Prompt with Windows PowerShell in the Menu” option off. \nAlso, It’s PowerShell’s 10 year anniversary this week. Hop over to Channel 9 to see some of the videos we’ve been sharing about it. If you’re looking to learn more about unleashing the “power” in PowerShell, this page is a great resource. Get Office (Beta) \nWhereas before Get Office was largely a collection of links to help you get started with Office, the new and improved app will help you explore and manage your Office experience. It’s not an app that gets you free Office programs. Rather, it helps you discover and launch apps and see all your recent Office documents in one place. \nCheck the official announcement for the complete list of new features, improvements, bug fixes, and known issues. \nAlso, check out this post if the upgrade failed for some reason.",

      "text": "Microsoft really has changed, Linux Foundation chief says Jim Zemlin welcomes Microsoft to the open-source consortium U.S. Correspondent, IDG News Service | Nov 17, 2016 11:41 AM PT Email a friend Use commas to separate multiple email addresses From Your message has been sent. Sorry There was an error emailing this page. \nScott Guthrie, the executive vice president in charge of Microsoft's Cloud & Enterprise division, greets Linux Foundation Executive Director Jim Zemlin on stage at the Microsoft Connect conference in New York City on November 16, 2016. Credit: Blair Hanley Frank The State of Solar 2017 \nMicrosoft made a splash in the tech industry on Wednesday when it announced that it had joined the Linux Foundation as a platinum member. While the move felt like a welcome extension of the tech giant's open source strategy to some, others saw it as a threat to Linux. \nMicrosoft's addition to the foundation was a positive step for the open-source community overall, Jim Zemlin, the executive director of the Linux Foundation, said in an interview. Adding Microsoft as a foundation member is an important move to further the Linux Foundation's mission, \"which is to create the greatest shared technology asset in history,\" he said. \n\"I think there is a burden on the broader open-source community — again, I think that there's a healthy anti-establishment sensibility — but there's the act of being the anti-movement, the rebel movement, and there's the act of being the mainstream movement. And to be in the mainstream does require broadening your tent and bringing as many people into that tent as possible.\" \nThe two organizations have been working together for a while. The first public partnership between the foundation and Microsoft appeared last year, when they announced a certification for running Linux on Azure. \nBut Microsoft has been helping out the foundation in other ways, Zemlin said. Microsoft engineers have contributed to the popular Node.js project, and the company is lending its security expertise to the Core Infrastructure Initiative, a project aimed at helping to secure key open-source tools. \nWhen asked whether Microsoft was joining the Linux Foundation to destroy the open source operating system, as some commenters have mused online, Zemlin said he's \"just not a big conspiracy theorist.\" It would be rather difficult for Microsoft to kill Linux at this stage, he said, and Microsoft was already following through on a commitment to open-source software. \n\"First of all, when you join the Linux Foundation, you're obligated to support the mission of our organization, which is to support the growth of Linux and open source,\" he said. \"And Microsoft has not only committed to doing that as a part of our organization, but I've got to tell you, they're pretty much already doing it.\" \nThis isn't Microsoft's first rodeo as a member of an open-source group. The company is also a member of the Apache Software Foundation and the Eclipse Foundation. Microsoft has also been opening up its own products: It released .NET, PowerShell, and other tools under open-source licenses. GitHub revealed it is the company with the largest external contributor base for projects it has released. \nTo be fair, the company is paying $500,000 for its membership, but Zemlin doesn't seem like the sort of person who would put aside potential issues with Microsoft for a big chunk of cash. He was one of the foundation's leading voices speaking out against the tech titan's past actions. \nMicrosoft is facing competitive pressures to engage with open source, thanks to the interest of its customers, as well as the changing times in computing. And as Zemlin pointed out, there's no way Microsoft alone can carry the day when it comes to building the software people need. \n\"In a world where things are in the cloud, everybody has a computer, there is too much software to be written for even Microsoft, with all their engineers, to write it on their own,\" he said. \"It ain't gonna happen.\" To express your thoughts on Computerworld content, visit Computerworld's Facebook page , LinkedIn page and Twitter stream .

      "text": "  \nCompanies that are actively attempting to “go green” have always focused on trying to become carbon neutral, and eliminating their carbon footprint. Because they’re so committed to improving the environment around them, Microsoft has published a carbon white paper that details their plans to go “beyond carbon neutral,” taking the steps necessary to become a force for good in the environment. \nYou can download the white paper and read about Microsoft’s goals in energy through their official blog post , but these are the areas they’re focusing their efforts on: Renewable energy: We are using the funds to drive long-term commitments and develop new renewable energy procurement options. Community projects: We are investing in projects that align with the United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals, and we are working to help organizations better leverage the potential of technology to achieve improved environmental, human health, and biodiversity outcomes. Climate Grants: We are evolving our Climate Grant program, which provides funds to catalyze and accelerate climate-related energy and technology innovation, to drive further impact in the communities in which we operate. Reporting: We are expanding our tracking and reporting to better measure our impact over time. \nThis plan is designed as a follow-up to Microsoft’s carbon fee that was implemented back in 2012 to hold business departments accountable for their carbon emissions. It works to make sure that the company’s carbon emissions are well documented to measure and account for environmental impact over an extended period, and provides grants to organizations that can help to positively influence a green society. \nIf you decide you want to read the white paper, be ready for an incredibly in-depth look at Microsoft’s plans for the future of energy sustainability.

      "text": "Authored by Google Security Research , natashenka \nJavascriptArray::FillFromPrototypes is a method that is used by several Javascript functions available in the browser to set the native elements of an array to the values provide by its prototype. This function calls JavascriptArray::ForEachOwnMissingArrayIndexOfObject with the prototype of the object as a parameter, and if the prototype of the object is an array, it assumes that it is a Var array. While arrays are generally converted to var arrays if they are set as an object's prototype, if an object's prototype is a Proxy object, it can return a parent prototype that is a native int array. This can lead to type confusing, allowing an integer to be treated as an absolute pointer, when JavascriptArray::FillFromPrototypes is called.",

      "text": "Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff Salesforce\nSalesforce CEO Marc Benioff further distanced himself from Microsoft on Thursday, after cozying up to the company during the past two years.\nBenioff has a new friend now: Amazon.\nDuring Salesforce quarterly earnings call on Thursday, Benioff downplayed a question about Microsoft's growing presence in the CRM software market by simply turning up the rhetoric about sales.\n\"We look at Microsoft, we sold more CRM software this quarter than Microsoft sold in the last decade. It’s just empirical,\" Benioff said during the call with investors.\nOf course, we won't know for sure if that's a true statement. Salesforce had another strong quarter, recording $2.14 billion in revenue, mostly from the CRM space. Microsoft doesn't break out sales from its Dynamics CRM business, but it is believed to be much smaller and a distant fourth in the market.\nSalesforce\nBut what's most striking is Benioff's changed tone in his comments about Microsoft. Just last year, in Salesforce's 2015 third quarter earnings call, Benioff said he's \"excited\" about Microsoft, saying he had a \"great relationship\" with the company. Even during this year's July quarter, he said he's done \"great work\" with Microsoft.\nBut that's all over now.\nBenioff made it clear earlier this week that he's no longer a fan of the \"new\" Microsoft under CEO Satya Nadella. Salesforce has historically had a contentious relationship with Microsoft, but the two companies suddenly became good friends after Nadella was named CEO in 2014, although the bromance seems all but over now.\nInstead, Benioff has turned to Amazon this year, striking a number of major deals. In May, Salesforce announced a $400 million deal to use AWS, while Amazon rolled out Salesforce's software company-wide. Salesforce said Amazon added even more Salesforce services this quarter, during the call with investors.\n“Amazon is a great win of the quarter as well. We formed a strategic relationship in Q1 as you all know, and in Q3 our relationship has expanded, and they added even more services throughout the company,\" Salesforce President and COO Keith Block said.\nDisclosure: Jeff Bezos is an investor in Business Insider through his personal investment company Bezos Expeditions.\nSEE ALSO: Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff: 'The new Microsoft is actually the old Microsoft' NOW WATCH: JACK DANIEL’S MASTER DISTILLER: This is the real difference between scotch, whiskey, and bourbon Loading video...

      "text": "The company is commercializing a version of its SQL Server database software that supports Linux, and now early adopters can finally take it for a spin. Microsoft and the open source community once staunchly occupied opposite sides of the IT spectrum. Recently, though, both are enjoying a cozy overlap. This week during its Connect(); 2016 developer event in New York City, Microsoft announced it had joined the Linux Foundation as a Platinum member. Not stopping there, the company revealed that both Google and Samsung were helping to bolster its own .NET open-source community . Even the company's database software is getting in on the act. In March, Microsoft revealed plans to release a version of SQL Server that runs on Linux sometime in 2017. Today, organizations interested in such deployments can get an early glimpse on how their SQL Server database workloads operate under this new operating system environment.\"Now you can also develop applications with SQL Server on Linux, Docker, or macOS (via Docker) and then deploy to Linux, Windows, Docker, on-premises, or in the cloud,\" Sirosh said in a Nov. 16 announcement . \"This represents a major step in our journey to making SQL Server the platform of choice across operating systems, development languages, data types, on-premises and the cloud.\"The preview also includes enhancements to the platform's R-based analytics and data science capabilities, he added. ( Microsoft acquired Revolution Analytics , the R statistical programming language's biggest supporter, last year.) By employing the company's research on machine learning and deep neural network, the updated software can now handle larger analytics workloads with increased speed. Microsoft also announced the general availability of SQL Server 2016 Service Pack 1 (SP1). For the first time, the update roundup features \"a consistent programming model across SQL Server editions,\" streamlining coding tasks, said Sirosh. Now, developers can build applications that target the Enterprise, Standard and Express editions of SQL Server and seamlessly move up the product portfolio as their scalability demands increase. On the cloud front, the company also announced the general availability of Azure Data Lake Analytics and Azure Data Lake Store. Azure Data Lake Analytics is Microsoft's data transformation and processing platform for applications using .NET, Python, R and U-SQL. According to the company, a few lines of code is all it takes for organizations to exploit its petabyte-scale data processing capabilities. Azure Data Lake Store, Microsoft's big data cloud analytics data solution, adheres to the popular HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System) standard, enabling businesses to unearth insights from trillions of files. Organizations contemplating Microsoft's cloud-based NoSQL service, DocumentDB, can now take it for a spin without committing to an Azure plan courtesy of the new DocumentDB Emulator. \"Using the DocumentDB Emulator, you can develop and test your application locally without an internet connection, without creating an Azure subscription, and without incurring any costs,\" said Sirosh. Other new releases this week include R Server for Azure HDInsight, the company's cloud-based Hadoop distribution, and a preview of the open-source Kafka streaming ingestion service for HDInsight. Finally, Operational Analytics for Azure SQL Database, a database service that enables both Online Analytical Processing (OLAP) and Online Transaction Processing (OLTP) on the same tables simultaneously, is now available.",

      "text": "Female portion of Microsoft's workforce shrinks again Software giant plans make meeting diversity goals a factor in whether executives receive their full annual bonus Stephen Brashear/Getty Images Female portion of Microsoft's workforce shrinks again 0 Share: Up Next Qualcomm can charge your phone faster than you can read this story \nMicrosoft plans to tie executive bonuses to diversity workforce goals after the company reported a decline in the percentage of women working at the company for the second consecutive year. \nWomen made up 25.8 percent of the company's global workforce at the end of September, a decline of 1 percent from the previous year, according to a company diversity report released Thursday. In 2014, women accounted for 29 percent of Microsoft's workforce. \nLike most large tech companies, Microsoft continues to grapple with how to increase diversity in its workforce. Studies indicate that more diverse teams, in terms of gender and race, show greater creativity and experimentation -- and get better results . \nBut Microsoft's overall gender diversity puts it behind such tech rivals as Apple , Facebook and Google , all of which reported this year that women made up 30 percent or more of their workforces. see also When tech firms judge on skills alone, women land more job interviews \nMicrosoft blamed the continued decline on ongoing layoffs it began last year as part of the restructuring of the phone businesses Microsoft acquired from Nokia in 2014. Many of the positions eliminated were manufacturing jobs at factories outside the US -- jobs that were held by a high percentage of women. \n\"While we are disappointed in the overall decline in the representation of women at the company, we know why it happened,\" Gwen Houston, Microsoft's general manager of global diversity and inclusion, wrote in the report. She went on to say that the company was encouraged by modest gains it made in the past year in the number of women it employs in technical and leadership roles. \nThe company also reported progress in its hiring trends, saying that women made up 27.7 percent of new hires this year, 2 percent higher than the company's current workforce. \nBlack and Latino employees also saw modest increases in the company's makeup. Blacks now compose 3.7 percent of the company's workforce, while Latino's make up 5.5 percent, increases of 0.2 percent and 0.1 percent, respectively. \nMicrosoft CEO Satya Nadella is expected to detail plans to make achieving diversity goals a factor in whether senior executives receive their full annual bonuses, Houston told Bloomberg News. Solving for XX Tech Industry Women in Tech Solving for XX \nSay \"women in tech\" and the phrase automatically conveys the sense of too few women, making less money and wielding less overall say and sway in shaping the industry. While that's true, gender disparity isn't a numbers story. Instead, it's about what women and men, companies and universities are doing in 2015 to solve outdated group think. Nov 18",

      "text": "Microsoft joins Linux Foundation as platinum member INQUIRER.net / 08:00 AM November 18, 2016 Microsoft’s membership to the Linux Foundation benefits both parties, especially with regards to Microsoft Azure. \nThere was a time when Microsoft was completely against open source and, in effect, Linux. But these days, the company is one of the biggest contributors to the Linux Kernel so this latest move can be described as nothing more than a positive eventuality. \nAs a platinum member, Microsoft will be paying annual dues of $500,000 which will go to fund development, outreach and management, reports The Next Web. \nJim Zemlin, executive director of the Linux Foundation, said that Microsoft’s membership would allow the company to be “better able to collaborate with the open source community to deliver transformative mobile and cloud experiences to more people.” ADVERTISEMENT \nOther platinum members of the Linux Foundation include Cisco, Fujitsu, HPE, Huawei, IBM, Intel NEC, Oracle, Qualcomm and Samsung.

      "text": "Printer-friendly version Email this CRN article \nA former Microsoft exec with a broad range of professional expertise around open source technologies is headed to Google, the Internet giant confirmed on Thursday. \nGoogle wouldn't elaborate on the role Sam Ramji will fill at the Mountain View, Calif.-based Internet giant. A representative told CRN only he'd be taking a position at Google Cloud , the company's recently rebranded enterprise division. \nAfter Ramji left Microsoft in 2009, he worked in some roles leading strategy around the development of open source projects, according to his LinkedIn profile, including his last position as CEO of the Cloud Foundry Foundation, which oversees development of the popular Platform-as-a-Service, initially built by Pivotal. \n[Related: Google and Intel Strengthen Ties To Drive Enterprise Cloud Adoption ] \nAt Microsoft, Ramji held the title of director of emerging business, working with startups and the venture capital community. Before that, he was senior director of platform strategy, where he drove the world's largest software company's open source and Linux strategy. \nSimon Margolis, director of cloud platform at SADA Systems, a Google partner based in Los Angeles, said that while he doesn't know Ramji personally or much about his professional history, the hire makes sense as Cloud Foundry and Google Cloud Platform have a lot in common. \n\"Both are interested in furthering portability, scalability, and open standards within the growing PaaS ecosystem,\" Margolis told CRN. \"We'd imagine the addition of Ramji to the team could only further those goals from Google's perspective. \nAllen Falcon, CEO of Westborough, Mass.-based Google partner Cumulus Global, said Ramji's open source pedigree is in line with Google's push to drive greater enterprise adoption of its cloud since most SMBs go with Software-as-a-Service solutions. \"This move is clearly targeting enterprise and upper mid-market companies, but may also signal an emphasis on the ISV partnerships,\" Falcon told CRN. \nRamji has sat on an advisory board for consulting giant Accenture since November 2013, and has a deep roster of positions on boards or in strategy roles for tech vendors like Apigee , an API services platform that Google acquired in September. \nFor more coverage of this topic, attend NexGen Cloud Conference & Expo .

      "text": "Microsoft Announces Public Preview Of SQL Server On Linux And Windows 17 November 2016, 5:34 pm EST By Vamien McKalin Tech Times With SQL Server now available for Linux, Microsoft is one step closer to proving it's all for open source and what it has to offer. ( Justin Sullivan | Getty Images ) Advertisement \nEver wondered what it would be like to run Microsoft SQL Server on Linux? A few years back, one would say that's nothing but a pipe dream. However, Microsoft has since been slowly accepting that open source and Linux are here to stay, and began to beef up its support. \nToday, we can say for sure that Microsoft SQL Server is available for Linux, but in preview form. It should also be noted that this is SQL Server Lite, so users will have to contend with a product that delivers reduced features, well, at least for now. \n\"Today, we are excited to announce the public preview of the next release of SQL Server on Linux and Windows, which brings the power of SQL Server to both Windows - and for the first time ever - Linux,\" according to Microsoft . \"SQL Server enables developers and organizations to build intelligent applications with industry-leading performance and security technologies using their preferred language and environment.\" The Steps \nBefore everything is brought into play as intended, Microsoft has a four-step plan to make this happen. The first step is to get all the major enterprise-grade Linux distributions onboard, this includes the likes of Suse Linux Enterprise Server, Ubuntu Linux, and Red Hat Enterprise Linux. \nThe idea is to have Microsoft SQL Server behave like regular Linux applications and not like a Windows application. Microsoft Mechanics took the time out to share with users on how to install SQL Server to a Linux distribution. From what we can tell, it's quite easy to get done, just like any other Linux app. \nThe Second step is to bring all SQL Server 2016 features to the table before the end of 2016. Microsoft is promising this, so we're guessing that the work on bringing the features over is almost done — seeing as the end of the year is almost upon us. Microsoft says its SQL Server 2016 will be a first class citizen on Linux in the same way it is on Windows. \nThe third step is all about tooling on Linux. SQL Server management tools such as SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS), Visual Studio SQL Server Data Tools (SSDT) and SQL Server PowerShell are all here. There's also the SQL Server extension for Visual Studio Code that can be found right now on the Visual Studio marketplace. Cloud First And Mobile First \nThis whole thing is a big deal for Microsoft, and its evident due to recent report that Microsoft has joined the Linux Foundation as it seeks to dive deeper into the vast amount of open source codes available. \nIt's all part of the company's new mantra after CEO Satya Nadella took over. Since then, Microsoft has changed to be more accepting and open, and we expect this to continue for years to come seeing as it has proven successful. TAG © 2016 Tech Times, All rights reserved.

      "text": "Posted by Biplab Ghosh On November 17, 2016 0 Comment \nBill Gates has accomplished more wealth and success than anyone of our generation. But even more importantly he has worked tirelessly to improve lives and prevent deaths through his generous charitable contributions. He consistently ranks in the Forbes list of the world’s wealthiest people. He’s one of the best-known entrepreneurs of the personal computer revolution. He’s retired from his role as Microsoft’s CEO and instead devotes himself full-time to philanthropy through the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. \nNo one will forget Steve Ballmer’s tenure at Microsoft. Steve Ballmer, Microsoft’s exuberant former CEO, is applying his energies to the Los Angeles Clippers, the basketball team he acquired for a record $2 billion in 2014. Most of his wealth remains tied to his stake in the software company. “I’d like to own Microsoft shares until I either give something to charity or I die,” Ballmer told FORBES in 2014. \nHere are the 10 Success lessons from Bill Gates and Steve Ballmer – “Microsoft Billionaires” for entrepreneurs, 1. Aim high – Bill Gates \nVery little people are aware that Microsoft’s big break came from Bill Gates telling a lie. In 1975, Gates contacted computer company MITS, and told them that he had developed a basic interpreter for their microcomputer. MITS was interested in seeing the software, however Gates and his programming friend Paul Allen were yet to actually develop it. This prompted Gates and Allen to develop it in quite a hurry, presenting it to MITS in a matter of weeks, and making their very first sale. Microsoft was founded only one month later, pushing Gates to deliver more than he’d ever proven he was capable of. 2. Never compare himself to others – Steve Ballmer \nSatya Nadella, the current CEO of Microsoft once asked Ballmer, “How do I compare to the people who had my role before me?” And Steve said: “Who cares? The context is so different. The only thing that matters to me is what you do with the cards you’ve been dealt now. … The lesson was that you have to stay grounded, and to be brutally honest with yourself on where you stand.” 3. Always think ahead – Bill Gates \nThroughout all of his endeavours, Bill Gates has always been known to maintain a vision of the future, and how it can be bigger and better. Microsoft was known to beat competitors throughout the years as they were always one step ahead, looking for the next big thing. Even when retiring from Microsoft in 2008, Bill Gates was still thinking ahead. He was focusing on his philanthropic efforts, with the Bill and Melinda Gates foundation now making a huge positive impact on the world. 4. Numbers matter – Steve Ballmer \nBallmer was exceptionally good at math–in a page of thousands of numbers used for a business unit’s sales forecasts, he could quickly spot the one that was wrong. \nIn a world increasingly run by analytics, this will become an asset far greater than it was while he ran Microsoft. Numbers forces you to look at the measurable facts, to ask for solid information and to constantly challenge what’s important. 5. Don’t let success distract you – Bill Gates \nOne of the greatest lessons we can learn from Bill Gates is his ability to look past success. He once famously stated “Success is a lousy teacher. It seduces smart people into thinking they can’t lose”. While we should reflect on our successes, you must ensure that they don’t cloud your judgement, and that you don’t become overconfident. Gates believed that we shouldn’t ignore the initial patterns of our success, but focusing all of our efforts into why this success occurred can leave you unprepared for future challenges. 6. Select people for loyalty, not competence – Steve Ballmer \nThis is one mistake Ballmer made. You should value those who can demonstrate loyalty and team-playing over those who are more competent but possess massive egos and don’t play well with others. The silos that crippled the company and created many of Microsoft’s biggest mistakes stemmed from the inability of really bright people to work with their peers. \nYou can blame some of this on forced ranking, which pits employees against each other, but a lot of it happened because being smart seemed to trump playing well with others. The end result: A lot of smart backstabbers. 7. Value your time – Bill Gates \nGates once said, “No matter how much money you have, you can’t buy more time”. Bill Gates understands the importance of using the time in your day wisely, and prioritises tasks which matter most to him. If he doesn’t believe he needs to be at a meeting, he won’t attend. On the other hand, he takes the time to communicate with the people closest to him, and ensures that he makes time for important commitments. 8. Don’t isolate yourself – Steve Ballmer \nBefore becoming CEO, Ballmer talked to people both inside and outside Microsoft to gain perspective. After becoming, CEO he allowed himself to be isolated by those who apparently wanted to better control the outcome of his engagements. \nThere are always those who want to either protect or control people in power by limiting their access. If that’s allowed to happen, bad things go unnoticed for too long. At best, the executive is ineffective; at worst, he or she fails and takes the company down, too. 9. Revolutionary ideas are shown, not told – Bill Gates and Steve Ballmer \nIn the early 80’s, Bill Gates and Steve Ballmer would travel around the country delivering seminars about how graphic interfaces were the operating systems of the future – but nobody believed them. Attitudes changed quickly in 1984, when Apple launched the Macintosh. It became the first commercially successful computer with a graphical user interface (GUI). \nMicrosoft was able to release Windows 1.0 in 1985, just a year after the Mac’s success. If you’ve got a revolutionary idea, don’t worry if other people don’t get it. Start developing it now so that you’ll be prepared when the time is right. 10. Use your position to give back – Bill Gates \nStrong leaders understand the importance of taking their success and using it to call attention to those who need it most, setting an example for others in their position. With the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation with an impressive endowment of more than $42 billion, the Gates have dedicated their time to bringing aid around the world, and are especially passionate about sustainability, bolstering education, public health and providing access to affordable technology.

      "title": "Google, Samsung Show Support for Microsoft .NET Framework",
      "text": "Microsoft's not done causing a stir in open-source software community. The company's .NET Foundation rolls out the welcome mat for Google and Samsung. Microsoft's 'Any Developer, Any App, Any Platform' strategy got a couple of major shots in the arm this week. Yesterday, during the company's Connect(); 2016 developer event in New York City, after several overtures to the open-source software community, the Redmond, Wash. software maker finally buried the hatchet and announced it had joined the Linux Foundation as a Platinum member. As a newly-minted platinum supporter, Microsoft pledges to pump at least a half-million dollars a year into the group coffers and back its open-source efforts. In another sign of thawing relations with its open source-friendly rivals, the company also revealed on Nov. 17 that Google had joined the .NET Foundation Technical Steering Group. Microsoft open sourced key parts of its .NET software development framework and formed the foundation back in 2014. \"Googlers have been quietly contributing to .NET Foundation projects and they're also helping drive the ECMA standard for C#,\" said Scott Hanselman, principal program manager at Microsoft Azure, ASP.NET and Web Tools, on stage. \"The Google Cloud platform has recently announced full support for .NET developers and they've got integrations into Visual Studio and support for PowerShell. All of this is made possible by the open-source nature of .NET.\"Google product manager Chris Sells said \"the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) team has worked hard to ensure that .NET has first-class support on Google's infrastructure, including excellent infrastructure for Windows,\" in a Nov. 16 blog post . The company already offers .NET libraries for over 200 Google Cloud services, he reminded.Fellow .NET Foundation Technical Steering Group member Samsung announced the release of .NET Core and Visual Studio Tools for Tizen , the open-source Linux-based operating system used in many of the company's connected devices. The South Korean electronics giant joined the Foundation in June and has been focusing on enabling support for ARM-based processors, Hanselman said. Over 50 million devices, including wearables, mobile handsets, TVs and internet of things devices run Tizen. In 2017, Samsung will begin shipping its Tizen-based Smart TVs and other electronics with .NET support. \"Samsung is excited to be a part of the .NET community. .NET has an extensive developer base and great potential,\" said Seung-hwan Cho, executive vice president and deputy head of Samsung's Software Research and Development Center, in a statement. \"Through thoughtful and progressive collaboration with Microsoft, Samsung is expecting to create unique development experiences for both Tizen and C# developers, enriching the Tizen ecosystem.\" Finally, Hanselman announced the official release of .NET Core 1.1. The updated open-source framework comes with support for 1,380 APIs (application programming interfaces), an increased number of supported Linux distros (Linux Mint 18 and OpenSUSE 42.1), Azure cloud integrations and performance enhancements. Microsoft also made available the alpha release of its new .NET Core Tools that are based on MSBuild (Microsoft Build Engine) and features support for the csproj project format.",

      "text": "Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff further distanced himself from Microsoft on Thursday, after cozying up to the company during the past two years.\nBenioff has a new friend now: Amazon.\nDuring Salesforce quarterly earnings call on Thursday, Benioff downplayed a question about Microsoft's growing presence in the CRM software market by simply turning up the rhetoric about sales.\n\"We look at Microsoft, we sold more CRM software this quarter than Microsoft sold in the last decade. It’s just empirical,\" Benioff said during the call with investors. \nOf course, we won't know for sure if that's a true statement. Salesforce had another strong quarter, recording $2.14 billion in revenue, mostly from the CRM space. Microsoft doesn't break out sales from its Dynamics CRM business, but it is believed to be much smaller and a distant fourth in the market.\nSalesforce \nBut what's most striking is Benioff's changed tone in his comments about Microsoft. Just last year, in Salesforce's 2015 third quarter earnings call, Benioff said he's \"excited\" about Microsoft, saying he had a \"great relationship\" with the company. Even during this year's July quarter, he said he's done \"great work\" with Microsoft.\nBut that's all over now.\nBenioff made it clear earlier this week that he's no longer a fan of the \"new\" Microsoft under CEO Satya Nadella. Salesforce has historically had a contentious relationship with Microsoft, but the two companies suddenly became good friends after Nadella was named CEO in 2014, although the bromance seems all but over now.\nInstead, Benioff has turned to Amazon this year, striking a number of major deals. In May, Salesforce announced a $400 million deal to use AWS, while Amazon rolled out Salesforce's software company-wide. Salesforce said Amazon added even more Salesforce services this quarter, during the call with investors.\n“Amazon is a great win of the quarter as well. We formed a strategic relationship in Q1 as you all know, and in Q3 our relationship has expanded, and they added even more services throughout the company,\" Salesforce President and COO Keith Block said.\nNOW WATCH: The ‘Apple of China’ just unveiled a phone that’s more powerful and better looking than the iPhone \n",

      "title": "Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff is done cozying up to Microsoft — now he's BFFs with Amazon (CRM, MSFT)",
      "text": "print Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff Salesforce \nSalesforce CEO Marc Benioff further distanced himself from Microsoft on Thursday, after cozying up to the company during the past two years. \nBenioff has a new friend now: Amazon. \nDuring Salesforce quarterly earnings call on Thursday, Benioff downplayed a question about Microsoft's growing presence in the CRM software market by simply turning up the rhetoric about sales. \n\"We look at Microsoft, we sold more CRM software this quarter than Microsoft sold in the last decade. It’s just empirical,\" Benioff said during the call with investors. \nOf course, we won't know for sure if that's a true statement. Salesforce had another strong quarter, recording $2.14 billion in revenue, mostly from the CRM space. Microsoft doesn't break out sales from its Dynamics CRM business, but it is believed to be much smaller and a distant fourth in the market. \nSalesforce \nBut what's most striking is Benioff's changed tone in his comments about Microsoft. Just last year, in Salesforce's 2015 third quarter earnings call, Benioff said he's \"excited\" about Microsoft, saying he had a \"great relationship\" with the company. Even during this year's July quarter, he said he's done \"great work\" with Microsoft. \nBut that's all over now. \nBenioff made it clear earlier this week that he's no longer a fan of the \"new\" Microsoft under CEO Satya Nadella. Salesforce has historically had a contentious relationship with Microsoft, but the two companies suddenly became good friends after Nadella was named CEO in 2014, although the bromance seems all but over now. \nInstead, Benioff has turned to Amazon this year, striking a number of major deals. In May, Salesforce announced a $400 million deal to use AWS, while Amazon rolled out Salesforce's software company-wide. Salesforce said Amazon added even more Salesforce services this quarter, during the call with investors. \n“Amazon is a great win of the quarter as well. We formed a strategic relationship in Q1 as you all know, and in Q3 our relationship has expanded, and they added even more services throughout the company,\" Salesforce President and COO Keith Block said.

      "text": "Freshly-funded Message.io buddies up with Microsoft on chatbots Seed funding could pave way for more chatbots to work on Cisco Spark, Salesforce Chatter messaging platforms News Editor, Network World | Nov 17, 2016 5:37 PM   Credit: Thinkstock What are Microservices? \nStarting from behind the likes of Slack and HipChat with its new workplace collaboration Teams service , Microsoft can use all the help it can get. Startup Message.io is among those coming to its aid. \nMessage.io , a bot translation tool and syndication service provider founded last year, enables developers to quickly port and scale their bots to work on numerous enterprise messaging platforms without making coding changes. It is partnering with Microsoft so that bots built for other messaging platforms will work on Teams within Office 365 (not to mention on Microsoft's Skype for Business). \nWe're talking about presumably useful bots, the kind that software companies like HubSpot are going ga-ga over for automating customer service, etc.-- not the sort of botnets that terrorize DNS networks . \nMessage.io claims that developers of more than 100 bots -- including HubSpot, Kayak and Poncho -- have committed to using its technology to translate their bots to Teams. If you're interested in getting in on the beta test, you can request an invite here . \nThe embrace by enterprises of workspace collaboration systems has been fueled by \"a realization that conversational interfaces, including both messaging and voice, are going to change the way we all interact with the world around us,\" says Message.io CEO and Co-founder Tom Hadfield, now on his 5th startup with Message.io CTO James Cundle. \"You're increasingly seeing the messaging interface becoming the primary way to engage with enterprise software tools...we think of messaging as the new operating system for the enterprise.\" Message.io \nMessage.io CEO & Co-founder Tom Hadfield: \"We're looking to create a world where all bots work on all platforms.\" \nThis applies to everyone from customer service reps to human resources staff to internal application developers, says Hadfield, who adds that friends of his run companies entirely on Slack or Teams, and only use apps that work with those messaging platforms. Bots, of course, are becoming an increasingly popular form of such apps. \nAn earlier Hadfield startup called Fetch, an e-commerce company that employed text messaging to simplify the buying process, sparked the idea for Message.io by illustrating the potential of conversational interfaces to make doing all sorts of things easier. \nOne fortunate thing for Message.io, as a company translating between different messaging platforms, is that the primary enterprise systems do have a lot in common in terms of API methods and UI elements that they support. \"There's a lot of uniformity when you compare it, for example, to mobile app development... iOS and Android are orders of magnitude different,\" Hadfield says. \nMessage.io's service is free during the beta period and the company plans to offer premium services, such as analytics, payment and identity, down the road. SEED FUNDING \nIn addition to scoring a partnership with Microsoft, Message.io announced $2.5 million in seed funding, led by Khosla Ventures and ENIAC, and featuring a cast of many others. Hadfield says he's seen most venture funding for bot-related ventures going to those with an enterprise focus, and in particular to the \"picks and shovels companies, the bot building tools and frameworks.\" And Austin, where Message.io is based, is the \"the chatbot capital of the world,\" based on the number of venture-backed chatbot companies in the area, Hadfield quips. \nMessage.io, which currently has a staff of 12, intends to use its new funds to add support for enterprise messaging platforms such as Salesforce Chatter and Cisco Spark.

      "text": "Can Amazon Fight Off Microsoft Cloud Momentum? (MSFT, AMZN) By Richard Saintvilus | November 17, 2016 — 10:17 AM EST \nWith annual revenue topping $10 billion, Amazon.com, Inc.'s ( AMZN ) Amazon Web Services (AWS) is still the cloud standard, according to many analysts. This is despite the emergence of Microsoft Corporation's ( MSFT ) commercial cloud platform Azure. \nIn the cloud computing segment referred to as infrastructure-as-a-service, Amazon has established an stranglehold on the market, accounting for a sizable 54% share of a burgeoning industry. This compares with Microsoft's 12% share, according to Pacific Crest analyst Brent Bracelin. But the numbers are not as they seem. (See also: Cloud Computing: An Industry in Exponential Growth .) \nAmazon launched AWS ten years ago, while Microsoft launched Azure in 2010. Plus, it wasn't until Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella was appointed in February 2014 that the cloud became a priority for the company. It can be argued that Microsoft's cloud performance really began 2.5 years ago, which gives Amazon almost eight full years as a first mover in the industry. \nIn that regard, when comparing both cloud giants, not only are Microsoft's numbers more impressive (under Nadella), the measures cast doubts on Amazon, as they suggest that Microsoft could catch up with Amazon's lead in the next three to five years. Based on Amazon's 54% market share, it has average market share growth of 5.4%. When factoring in Microsoft's 12% market share, the average annual share gain (under Nadella) is 4.8%. (See also: Microsoft's Secret Weapon: Cloud Division .) \nIn the most recent quarter, while Amazon's Web Services revenue grew at an impressive 55% to $3.23 billion, it was half of the 116% growth Microsoft posted for Azure. In other words, while Azure, which has an annual run rate of $2 billion, is just one-fifth the size of AWS, it should be taken seriously, especially now that Microsoft has LinkedIn Corporation's ( LNKD ) cloud assets. (See also: Microsoft to Buy LinkedIn for $26.2 Billion .) \nAssuming Microsoft can leverage its $26 billion LinkedIn deal, aimed at accelerating its growth within the cloud, Microsoft will be able to grow its Azure cloud share toward 20%+, while Amazon's share will shrink. And that's even with Azure's growth rate slowing from above 100%+ to around 50% in the next five years. \nMicrosoft shares closed Wednesday at $59.63. The stock has risen 7.48% year to date, compared with a 6.51% rise in the S&P 500 ( SPX ) index.

      "text": "Microsoft joins the Linux foundation and blows everyone’s mind Mike Wehner Pin it Share Microsoft, the monolithic force in the land of software licensing and exclusivity, has joined the Linux Foundation. Yes, you read that correctly and no, this isn’t a joke. At the company’s Connect conference today in New York, the house that Gates built revealed that it is joining the Linux Foundation as a platinum member. The non-profit organization has three tiers of membership, with platinum being the highest, followed by gold and silver. As a platinum member, Microsoft has committed to donating a minimum of $500,000 annually to the advancement and open source development of many different projects. DON’T MISS: Walmart’s pre-Black Friday sale starts right now – here are the best deals so far The announcement is a big deal for both Microsoft and the open source community, but there have been signs that Microsoft was changing its stance on Linux for some time. The company has gradually warmed up to its former nemesis and embraced both Linux software and the community at large in the name of problem solving and collaboration. Microsoft showed its good will by sponsoring events such as Linuxcon, and making things official by becoming a member of the Linux Foundation is definitely a step towards healing old wounds. What wounds would those be, you ask? Well, former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer was notoriously anti-Linux throughout his time at the company. In a highly criticized interview with the Chicago Sun-Times in 2001, Ballmer denounced both Linux and the open source movement as a whole. “Linux is a cancer that attaches itself, in an intellectual proper sense, to everything it touches,” Ballmer famously claimed. He went on to bash open source licensing, claiming that open source software somehow made all other software worse. So, you can see why it might come as a shock to Linux devotees to see Microsoft writing a half million dollar check to the open source community just 15 years later. Trending right now: ",

      "text": "November 17, 2016 Share \nFor people with colorblindness, daily activities like choosing a perfectly ripe piece of fruit or the ideal color palette of an outfit can be tricky, along with an overall compromised sense of the vividness of the world’s hues. So, Microsoft engineers designed an app that uses a smartphone camera to help people with the condition distinguish color combinations that they would otherwise have a hard time telling apart. \nColor Binoculars, available now on the App Store, applies a filter to the camera lens to replace troublesome color combinations, like red and green, with a combination easier to tell apart, like pink and green. The idea for the app came up during Microsoft’s 2015 hackathon, when engineers Tom Overton and Tingting Zhu developed the prototype. \n“We read about special lenses that helped colorblind people distinguish colors,” Zhu, said in a company blog . “However, that’s expensive. So we thought, let’s code something on a phone for free.” \nThey started with a relatively straightforward goal: make reds brighter and greens darker. Overton, who is colorblind, said he saw an immediate improvement in his ability to distinguish colors. The team then took the prototype to the Microsoft Garage (the company’s project lab) and built it into an app that adapts to different common types of colorblindness as well as an on/off mechanism for the filters to compare what something normally looks like versus what those with colorblindness see. \nThe National Eye Institute estimates about 8 percent of men and 0.5 percent of women with Northern European ancestry have the most common form of color blindess. In most cases, it isn’t too disruptive to daily life (although a small percentage of the population does experience total colorblindness). \n“Anything with red or green messes me up,” Overton said on the company blog. “It’s not so terrible, but it does affect you. For instance, fall leaves don’t look any different for me than other leaves. They look like they always do. It takes a lot of color out of my life – metaphorically, that is.” \nWhile the app can’t help in situations where colorblindness could be potentially dangerous, such as reading traffic lights or, say, flying a jet, it does help those with the condition experience more out of what they see. \n“Whether it’s picking flowers for a loved one, experiencing the beauty of nature, or choosing matching clothes for your outfit, let Color Binoculars help you take a better look at your world,” the company states.

Although Microsoft has recently changed its tune about open source, the move was still largely unexpected from a company whose CEO once called Linux a cancer. Jim Zemlin, executive director of the Linux Foundation, said that as a result of this move, \"Microsoft is better able to collaborate with the open source community to deliver transformative mobile and cloud experiences to more people.\" \nIn another unanticipated move, Google announced that it will join Microsoft's .NET Foundation and will become a member of the steering committee. \nOther news from Connect include the release of Visual Studio for Mac, SQL Server 2016 Service Pack 1 and a release candidate for Visual Studio 2017.",

      "text": "Blog archive Microsoft's Pending LinkedIn Acquisition Ignites Both Fear and Optimism \nMicrosoft is hoping to finalize its acquisition of professional social networking giant LinkedIn by year's end. But it still has a key hurdle to meet -- gaining approval from European Union regulators. Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff, which was unable to outbid Microsoft's successful offer to acquire LinkedIn for $26.2 billion, is trying to convince the EU it shouldn't approve the deal, arguing it will stifle competition. \nWhile it has already cleared regulatory approval in the United States and other countries, the EU is expected to decide by Dec. 6 to either clear the deal or to delay it pending further investigation. A report by Reuters on Nov. 16 revealed that Microsoft officials last week met with EU regulators and offered concessions. The report, citing unnamed EU officials, said details weren't provided but they'll share the concessions with competitors and customers. \nBenioff has complained to regulators for some time since the deal was first announce d by both companies in mid-June. In late September, Salesforce Chief Legal Officer Burke Norton told CNN in a statement that \"Microsoft's proposed acquisition of LinkedIn threatens the future of innovation and competition. By gaining ownership of LinkedIn's unique dataset of over 450 million professionals in more than 200 countries, Microsoft will be able to deny competitors access to that data, and in doing so obtain an unfair competitive advantage.\" \nAmid the latest hurdles, I was among four participants in a panel discussion Tuesday night in New York City and again Wednesday morning in Woodbridge, N.J. at a meeting of Microsoft's partners. The meeting was planned a while back to discuss if, and how, Microsoft partners might benefit from the deal. \nIn advance of the meeting, I shared results of the Redmond magazine survey we conducted and shared in our August cover story . About 20-plus attendees were at both meetings, held by the local chapters of the International Association of Microsoft Channel Partners (IAMCP) -- and some were hopeful the integration of LinkedIn's large pool of data and social graph will open new opportunities for them such as offering new capabilities on the Dynamics CRM suite to make it easier to sell and market to customers. \nAmong those who is bullish about the potential of the deal is Eric Rabinowitz, CEO of Nurture Marketing, who organized the panel discussion and recruited me to participate along with Jeffrey Goldstein, founder and managing director of Queue Associates, a Dynamics integrator, and Karl Joseph Ufert, president of Mitre Creative, a New York-based digital agency that works with various Microsoft partners. \nRabinowitz uses LinkedIn today to mine his clients' \"circle of influences,\" he explained. \"We look at our clients, go into LinkedIn and look at what surrounds them, who their peers are, who they report to and who reports to them,\" Rabinowitz explained. \"Then we harvest that information and get e-mail addresses for those people. And instead of marketing to one person in an organization, we reach their whole circle of influence. What's beautiful about the Microsoft acquisition, I think what I just described will all be there at the push of a button.\" \nAsked later if he was concerned that this capability would marginalize his business, Rabinowitz argued to the contrary. \"Right now, it's a labor-intensive service that does not make us much money,\" he said. \"If it's a service then what Microsoft will do for us isimprove our service, gaining improved results. Also, I can envision us packaging the service into something else we do.\" \nOthers, though, are concerned that once Microsoft absorbs LinkedIn, resulting services could put the squeeze on their own offerings, depending on how they're priced. That's specially the case for those who offer virtual software training services. Lisa Eyekuss, president of Corporate Training Group, based in Iselin, N.J., shared her concerns, especially if Microsoft bundles LinkedIn's Lynda.com training service with Office 365 subscriptions. \"If they include it, then Microsoft just slapped the face of its partners who do all the end user training because it's the first item in the budget to be cut.\" \nWhile she takes some comfort in having diversified her business in recent years, Eyekuss is wondering to what degree Microsoft will slash the cost of Lynda.com to Office 365 subscribers. \"I know it will affect our business,\" she said. \"We have to figure out how to stay away from it.\" \nIt also remains to be seen to what degree Microsoft will integrate LinkedIn data, including contacts and the newsfeed, with Office 365 and the new Microsoft Teams ( announced earlier this month ), as well as ties to the new Dynamics 365 business suite, particularly CRM. Goldstein said he believes it will add much richer capabilities to the CRM stack. Goldstein said he is hoping Microsoft shares more specifics as soon as the deal closes -- presuming the EU doesn't delay it. \"I'm excited and I don't know why,\" he said. \"The only thing I do know is if Marc Benioff is upset about this acquisition and is trying to block it, it's got to be good,\" he said. \"There's got to be something there.\" Posted by Jeffrey Schwartz on 11/17/2016 at 2:44 PM <>",

      "text": "Microsoft really has changed, Linux Foundation chief says Jim Zemlin welcomes Microsoft to the open source consortium U.S. Correspondent, IDG News Service | Nov 17, 2016 Email a friend Use commas to separate multiple email addresses From Your message has been sent. Sorry There was an error emailing this page. \nScott Guthrie, the executive vice president in charge of Microsoft's Cloud & Enterprise division, greets Linux Foundation Executive Director Jim Zemlin on stage at the Microsoft Connect conference in New York City on November 16, 2016. Credit: Blair Hanley Frank How IBM's Watson will change cybersecurity \nMicrosoft made a splash in the tech industry on Wednesday when it announced that it had joined the Linux Foundation as a platinum member. While the move felt like a welcome extension of the tech giant's open source strategy to some, others saw it as a threat to Linux. \nMicrosoft's addition to the foundation was a positive step for the open-source community overall, Jim Zemlin, the executive director of the Linux Foundation, said in an interview. In his view, adding Microsoft as a foundation member is an important move to further the Linux Foundation's mission, \"which is to create the greatest shared technology asset in history.\" [ InfoWorld celebrates Linux at 25: A pictorial history . | How Linux changed the world . | Linus Torvalds on the evolution and future of Linux . | Containers and unikernels prove less is more . | Quick guide to Linux admin essentials . | Stay up on open source with the InfoWorld Linux report . ] \n\"I think there is a burden on the broader open-source community -- again, I think that there's a healthy anti-establishment sensibility -- but there's the act of being the anti-movement, the rebel movement, and there's the act of being the mainstream movement. And to be in the mainstream does require broadening your tent and bringing as many people into that tent as possible.\" \nThe two organizations have been working together for a while. The first public partnership between the foundation and Microsoft appeared last year, when they announced a certification for running Linux on Azure. \nBut Microsoft has been helping out the foundation in other ways, Zemlin said. Microsoft engineers have contributed to the popular Node.js project, and the company is lending its security expertise to the Core Infrastructure Initiative, a project aimed at helping to secure key open-source tools. \nWhen asked whether Microsoft was joining the Linux Foundation to destroy the open-source operating system, as some commenters have mused online, Zemlin said he's \"just not a big conspiracy theorist.\" It would be rather difficult for Microsoft to kill Linux at this stage, he said, and Microsoft was already following through on a commitment to open-source software. \n\"First of all, when you join the Linux Foundation, you're obligated to support the mission of our organization, which is to support the growth of Linux and open source,\" he said. \"And Microsoft has not only committed to doing that as a part of our organization, but I've got to tell you, they're pretty much already doing it.\" \nThis isn't Microsoft's first rodeo as a member of an open-source group. The company is also a member of the Apache Software Foundation and the Eclipse Foundation. Microsoft has also been opening up its own products: It released .NET, PowerShell, and other tools under open-source licenses. GitHub revealed it is the company with the largest external contributor base for projects it has released. \nTo be fair, the company is paying $500,000 for its membership, but Zemlin doesn't seem like the sort of person who would put aside potential issues with Microsoft for a big chunk of cash. He was one of the foundation's leading voices speaking out against the tech titan's past actions. \nMicrosoft is facing competitive pressures to engage with open source, thanks to the interest of its customers, as well as the changing times in computing. And as Zemlin pointed out, there's no way Microsoft alone can carry the day when it comes to building the software people need. \n\"In a world where things are in the cloud, everybody has a computer, there is too much software to be written for even Microsoft, with all their engineers, to write it on their own,\" he said. \"It ain't gonna happen.\" To comment on this article and other InfoWorld content, visit InfoWorld's LinkedIn page , Facebook page and Twitter stream .

      "text": "(Adds details on competition with Microsoft)\nSAN FRANCISCO, Nov 17 (Reuters) - Salesforce.com Inc on Thursday forecast current-quarter revenue above analysts' estimates as it closed deals for its cloud-based sales and marketing software with a number of major customers, sending its shares 5 percent higher in extended trade.\nThe San Francisco-based company has consistently reported double-digit growth in recent quarters as companies shift to cheaper and easier cloud-based products, but it is facing growing competition from Oracle Corp and Microsoft Corp .\n\"Our checks indicate that Salesforce still has a number of very good secular growth drivers, including selling some of their newer cloud offerings and upselling activity into large customers is robust,\" said Wedbush Securities analyst Steve Koenig.\nThe results marked a sharp reversal from the previous quarter, when a lighter-than-expected revenue forecast prompted concerns about slowing growth. But this quarter the company closed large deals with customers including Citigroup Inc and Amazon.com Inc to help it get back on track.\nDeferred revenue, a key metric for subscription-based software businesses, rose 23 percent to $3.50 billion in the third quarter. Analysts on average had expected deferred revenue of $3.42 billion, according to research firm FactSet StreetAccount.\n\"We expect to deliver our first $10 billion-year during our fiscal year 2018,\" Chief Executive Officer Marc Benioff said in a statement.\nSalesforce stock rose 4.8 percent in extended trade to $78.74.\nBenioff is looking to broaden the company's cloud offerings through new features, especially focusing on artificial intelligence.\nThe company, which launched its artificial intelligence platform Einstein in October, has made a number of acquisitions to build up its machine learning and big data analysis capabilities.\nBenioff, who has grown increasingly active in politics and civic affairs in San Francisco, is also eager to make Salesforce a more prominent brand in the minds of consumer.\nThe company considered buying Twitter Inc earlier this year, but abandoned the pursuit last month amid investor concerns over the strategic merits and valuation of the deal.\nSalesforce also lost out to Microsoft in a bid to buy LinkedIn Corp.\nThe competition between Microsoft and Salesforce is now intensifying on several fronts, with Microsoft's Dynamics product taking business from Salesforce among mid-sized customers. Microsoft also this summer launched a direct competitor to Salesforce's AppExchange for business software.\nFor the current quarter, Salesforce said it expected revenue of $2.27 billion to $2.28 billion, above analysts' average estimate of $2.24 billion.\nExcluding items, the company earned 24 cents per share in the third quarter on a non-GAAP basis, beating the average analyst estimate of 21 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\nRevenue rose 25.3 percent to $2.14 billion. Analysts had expected revenue of $2.12 billion.\nHowever, on traditional GAAP measures of earnings, the company's net loss widened to $37.3 million, or 5 cents per share, in the three months ended Oct. 31 from $25.2 million, or 4 cents per share, a year earlier.\nUp to Thursday's close, Salesforce's shares had fallen 4.1 percent this year, underperforming the 7 percent gain in the broader S&P 500 index.\n(Reporting by Narottam Medhora in Bengaluru;   Lisa Shumaker)",

(Microsoft) Reprints \nGoldman Sachs upgraded Microsoft ( MSFT ) to buy on upbeat views for its cloud computing business, MoffettNathanson upgraded Time Warner ( TWX ) on improving odds it'll be acquired by AT&T ( T ); NetApp 's ( NTAP ) better-than-expected guidance won an upgrade and several price target hikes; and Cisco Systems ' ( CSCO ) price target was lowered on a disappointing fiscal Q2 revenue outlook. Microsoft \nGoldman Sachs upgraded Microsoft to buy from hold with a price target of 68. Heather Bellini, a Goldman analyst, says Microsoft's Azure cloud service will prosper vs. Amazon.com ( AMZN ), Alphabet 's ( GOOGL ) Google and Alibaba Holdings ( BABA ). \n\"We believe the shares are poised to more consistently outperform in the year ahead on the back of sustained traction in its cloud offerings. We estimate that Microsoft Azure will contribute $0.94, or 19% of Microsoft's total 2020 non-GAAP EPS of $4.83, and potentially $19 per share (23% of total estimated value),\" Bellini said in a report. \nMicrosoft stock rose 1.7% to 60.64 Thursday, still in buy range from a 58.80 entry area. \nRELATED: \nAmazon Confronts Microsoft, Google, IBM In Cloud Computing Wars Time Warner \nMoffettNathanson upgraded the media giant to buy with a price target of 100 on increasing odds that regulators will approve AT&T's $85 million purchase. Analyst Michael Nathanson says there's now a 60%-65% chance of the deal getting through, up from 50% following Donald Trump's election. MoffettNathanson's price target of 100, though, is still below AT&T's 107 per-share offer. \nTime Warner stock gained 2% to 90.69; shares in AT&T were up 0.7%. \nRELATED: \nAT&T Downgraded, FCC Might Also Review Time Warner Acquisition NetApp \nDrexel Hamilton upgraded NetApp to buy from hold with a price target of 52. RBC Capital raised its price target on NetApp to 40 from 36; Jefferies to 38 from 34; Citigroup to 39 from 33; BMO Capital Markets to 39 from 31; and Piper Jaffray to 37 from 31. \nLate Wednesday, NetApp reported fiscal Q2 profit minus items of 60 cents, down a penny vs. a year earlier but above analysts estimate of 54 cents. NetApp guided January quarter EPS to a range of 72-77 cents vs. consensus estimates of 65 cents. \nShares jumped 6.25% to 36.90 after hitting 39 intraday. \nRELATED: \nNetApp, Two Other Stocks Clear Buy Points, Hit New Highs Cisco Systems \nDrexel Hamilton sliced its price target on Cisco to 36 from 37; RBC Capital lowered its price target to 34 from 35. Cisco late Wednesday reported fiscal Q1 earnings and revenue that topped views but forecast current-quarter profit and sales below expectations. CEO Charles Robbins blamed weaker demand from telecom companies for the disappointing revenue outlook. \nCisco stock fell 4.8% to 30.05. \nRELATED: \nCisco Guidance Misses, CEO Blames 'Wait And See' Telecoms Post-Trump \nIn other analyst moves, Dougherty & Co. initiated iRobot ( IRBT ) at buy with a PT of 65; iRobot has an IBD Composite Rating of 92. BTIG Research initiated Adobe Systems ( ADBE ) with a neutral rating and started Shopify ( SHOP ) ( IBD ) at buy. BTIG also initiated ChannelAdvisor ( ECOM ) at neutral. Share this: Related news",

Microsoft steps further into open community by joining Linux Foundation Posted on 18-Nov-2016 15:34. | Filed under: News : Computing . \nOn Wednesday, during its annual Connect(); developer event, Microsoft Corp. unveiled a series of products and partnerships that strengthen the company’s Azure cloud platform for building intelligent, cross-platform apps and services. Microsoft Cloud and Enterprise Executive Vice President Scott Guthrie detailed significant steps Microsoft is taking to empower the ecosystem by giving developers greater choice in the tools they use — including joining the Linux Foundation as a Platinum Member to better collaborate with the open source community, welcoming Google to the independent .NET Foundation, and working with Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd. to enable .NET developers to build apps for more than 50 million Samsung devices worldwide. \n\nGuthrie also demonstrated a preview of Visual Studio for Mac, which enables developers to write cloud, mobile and macOS apps on Apple’s Mac operating system using the popular development environment; a preview of the next version of the company’s flagship SQL Server database with support for Linux, Linux-based Docker containers and Windows-based environments; and a preview of Azure App Service on Linux with support for containers. \n\n“We want to help developers achieve more and capitalize on the industry’s shift toward cloud-first and mobile-first experiences using the tools and platforms of their choice,” Guthrie said. “By collaborating with the community to provide open, flexible and intelligent tools and cloud services, we’re helping every developer deliver unprecedented levels of innovation.” \n\nAs part of its effort to work more closely with the open source community, Microsoft on Wednesday announced it has joined the Linux Foundation as a Platinum Member. Microsoft’s membership in the Linux Foundation will benefit customers through increased collaboration and innovation among a diverse ecosystem. \n\n“By becoming a Linux Foundation Platinum member, Microsoft is better able to collaborate with the open source community to deliver transformative mobile and cloud experiences to more people,” said Jim Zemlin, executive director of The Linux Foundation. “Microsoft has been a key contributor to many projects, and we see the company intensifying its involvement and commitment to open development.” \n\nMicrosoft has become an active member of the open source community in part through the popularity of its open source and cross-platform application framework .NET Core. Wednesday’s addition of Google to the .NET Foundation’s Technical Steering Group further reinforces the vibrancy of the .NET developer community as well as Google’s commitment to fostering an open platform that supports businesses and developers who have standardized on .NET. \n\nOther industry leaders are also betting on .NET Core for their own commercial products. On Wednesday Samsung is releasing a preview of its Visual Studio Tools for Tizen. Developers can use the tools to build .NET apps for the Tizen operating system that runs on millions of Samsung TVs, wearables, mobile devices and many IoT devices around the world. \n\nMicrosoft highlighted several announcements Wednesday aimed at helping developers use the tools of their choice to create Android, iOS and Windows apps powered by Linux or Windows Server, including the following: \nThe SQL Server on Linux public preview released Wednesday is the first preview of the next version of SQL Server and brings the power of SQL Server to Linux and Linux-based Docker containers, in addition to Windows. A new Visual Studio for Mac preview provides a macOS-based integrated development environment designed for building mobile, cloud and macOS apps. The availability of Azure App Service on Linux with support for Containers in preview provides native Linux support for Node.js and PHP stacks on Azure App Service and now enables developers to bring their own Docker-formatted container image. \nMicrosoft also unveiled unique capabilities and services that make it easier for more developers to turn massive amounts of data into deeply personal, intelligent and predictive applications. \nSQL Server 2016 Service Pack 1 availability makes database innovations accessible to more applications across product editions. The availability of Azure Data Lake services , Azure Data Lake Analytics and Data Lake Store means developers and data scientists now have the capabilities required to easily store and process data at petabyte size files, with massively parallel analytics and enterprise-grade security for insights on data of any size, shape and speed. \nMicrosoft’s solutions evolve with changing developer needs. Through the Visual Studio family, SQL Server, Windows, Office and Azure, Microsoft is working to provide the most complete platform for application innovation, spanning mobile and cloud. \nThe Visual Studio Mobile Center preview announced Wednesday brings together the cloud and life-cycle services that help developers build, test, distribute and monitor apps built in Objective-C, Swift, Java, Xamarin and React Native for Android-, iOS- and Windows-based devices. The Visual Studio 2017 release candidate released Wednesday includes new capabilities to help any developer be more productive than ever for any application and any platform. Visual Studio Team Foundation Server 2017 and Azure Application Insights are now available, providing an enhanced collaboration and DevOps platform for cloud- first, mobile-first scenarios. \n“Microsoft is transforming the nature of its appeal to developers by broadening its supported platforms,” said Al Hilwa, research director for Software Development research at IDC. “The new partnerships and commitments allow Microsoft to meet developers where they are and multiply its reach and impact with mobile and cloud developers as well as become established in emerging areas such as IoT, data science and cognitive computing.”",

      "text": "By Tiernan Ray Microsoft ( MSFT ) shares are up $1.07, or 1.8%, at $60.72, after Goldman Sachs ’s Heather Bellini upgraded the stock to a Buy from neutral, and raised her price target to $68 from $60, as part of a mammoth 72-page report on the future of “ public ” cloud computing .\nMicrosoft has a chance to see its gross profit dollars grow at an accelerating pace, and also see improvement in “incremental” profit margins, as a result of Azure’s progress in the cloud, writes Bellini. She and colleague Heath Terry spoke with over a dozen chief technology officers, they write, gauging feedback about Microsoft, and about Amazon ( AMZN ) and Alphabet ’s ( GOOGL ) Google in cloud, both of which are covered by Terry.\nThe overarching theme is that cloud is still very young but will disrupt overall IT spending in a very big way in the next four years. They see public cloud spending rising from $32 billion this year to $137 billion in 2020. That’s not including traditional software license revenue that Microsoft sells that moves to the cloud.\nOver that time, “we believe the public cloud market will continue to disrupt multiple industries, including servers, storage, networking, infrastructure software, data center construction, and data center outsourcing,” areas that amount to $500 billion in spending now and will be worth $650 billion in 2020.",

      "text": "By William Usher 6 minutes ago \nMicrosoft hasn't talked much about the Xbox Scorpio after unveiling it back at E3. They've talked around it but not really about it. Well, they finally revealed some new information about what gamers can expect and, apparently, the Scorpio is sounding really expensive. \nGamePur picked up the news about the premium price from a response that the head of the Xbox division, Phil Spencer, made after Wedbush Morgan Securities analyst Michael Pachter said it would be \"suicide\" if Microsoft tried to sell the Xbox Scorpio for more than $399.99. Spencer said... \nScorpio will be a premium console. It will cost more than S, obviously, this is how we are building it up. We have not announced the pricing yet, but want to make sure that the investment we are making in the product of Scorpio goes hand in hand with the requirement of high-end consumer and that means a higher price. \nWe know that the Scorpio will be priced higher than the Xbox One S , which is $299.99. Some people think that \"high-end consumer\" is a phrase that relates to the upper echelon of gamers, the type of people willing to put in heavy amounts of funds to build PC master rigs, or the high-end price that the PS3 launched at back in 2006. However, this would be suicide from Microsoft, like Pachter mentions, because consoles are too far behind on the tech curve to chase the graphics benchmarks of today's highest-end PCs. \nDuring the seventh generation the Xbox 360 and PS3 actually offered gamers some good bang for the buck, with high-end gaming output that rivaled the likes of gaming PCs for some years. However, the generation stretched on for way too long, and then, by the time the Xbox One and PS4 came onto the market, they were only moderately more powerful than their previous gen counterparts and nearly two generations behind PCs. \nBased on the specs that are available for the Xbox Scorpio , it's slightly-above a mid-range PC, but still far off from a desktop computer running high-speed RAM, an overclocked i7 and a GTX 1080. Going for a $599 or $699 price point for the Scorpio would be \"suicide\". \nHowever, the phrase \"high-end consumer\" may not necessarily mean that the console has to be $599 or $699. What if \"high-end consumer\" is pricing the Scorpio at $499? At that price it's possible that Microsoft could win over some gamers if the rumors about their partnership with Oculus turns out to be true, and the Scorpio ends up having compatibility with the Oculus Rift and is capable of running games from the Oculus Store. \nIt would still be very expensive and would be a tough sell for a lot of gamers, but it would also put the Scorpio in the VR race for people who don't want to upgrade their PC or go through the trouble of making sure they have the right specs to use the headset. \nBut, of course, the price and specs of the Xbox Scorpio are all dependent on what Microsoft plans on using it for. Both Sony and Microsoft have had identity issues with their consoles this generation, focusing on a lot of other things aside from video games. With Nintendo putting a strong focus on hybrid multiplayer gaming with the Nintendo Switch, both Microsoft and Sony will need to hunker down and figure out what they want the identity of their platforms to be. \nMicrosoft gunning for the high-end consumer is a risky move, but it could pay off if they have the games to back it up. So far, neither Sony nor Microsoft have really \"wowed\" with a plentiful supply of first-party offerings to make the PS4 and Xbox One really stand out. So Microsoft would need some killer-apps to help sell the Xbox Scorpio if they really are going to target a premium, \"high-end consumer\" price-point.

      "title": "Azure Data Lake Service for Big Data Analyses Now Available",
      "text": "By Kurt Mackie 11/17/2016 \nMicrosoft this week released Azure Data Lake as a generally available (GA), production-ready service, backed by Microsoft's 99.9 percent service-level agreement. \nAzure Data Lake is a service for \"Big Data\" massively parallel types of analyses, with the ability to tap into pools of structured and unstructured data without limits. The service has been at the preview stage since November of 2015, according to a Microsoft Channel 9 presentation , so it's taken one year to arrive fully baked. \nMicrosoft is marketing the Azure Data Lake service as enabling \"Big Cognition.\" The idea is glean insights from multiple inputs of various data types. It's about \"joining all the extracted cognitive data with other types of data, so you can do some really powerful analytics with it,\" according to a Microsoft announcement . \nAzure Data Lake Components Azure Data Lake is composed of three Azure services, according to the presentation. It has HDInsight, which is Microsoft's Hadoop-based Big Data service. Another component is the new Data Lake Store (GA this week), a repository for structured and unstructured data that can scale to meet developer needs. Lastly, there's the new Data Lake Analytics (GA this week), which permits users to run \"massively parallel data transformation and processing programs in U-SQL, R, Python and .NET over petabytes of data,\" per the announcement. \nThe overall system is based on the open Apache Hadoop Distributed File System. Microsoft illustrates the Azure Data Lake components in the following diagram: [Click on image for larger view.] Azure Data Lake components. Source: Microsoft blog post . \nThe U-SQL query language is frequently mentioned in Microsoft's Azure Data Lake announcements. It may seem new, but Microsoft has been using U-SQL internally since 2008, according to the Channel 9 presentation. U-SQL is supported in Azure Data Lake Tools for Visual Studio Code at the preview stage and \"combines the declarative advantage of T-SQL and extensibility of C#.\" \nA Reddit Ask Me Anything session conducted by Microsoft Azure team members this week offered an additional definition of U-SQL, as follows: \nIt [U-SQL] has an official meaning which is that it unifies: structured and unstructured data processing declarative SQL with user code (written in C#, Python, R etc.) querying data in Azure Data Lake with querying data from Windows Azure Blog Store, SQL Server in Azure \nThe inofficial meaning is that you need a submarine to explore the depth of your data lake and discover your treasures. And in German and Swedish, submarines are called U-Boot :). It is not true that it is called U-SQL because the U comes after the T. \nDevelopers love the U-SQL query language and pick it up very fast, according to Microsoft's presentation. Microsoft offers a tutorial here . \nSpinning up an Azure Data Lake workload takes \"30 seconds,\" Microsoft claims. Essentially, Microsoft takes care of managing the cluster for developers or data scientists. Additionally, Data Lake Store is designed to have \"no limits\" on the data size or the number of files or objects used in the analysis. No repartitioning of the data is required to run analyses. Developers don't have to define a schema up front. \nIn addition, Azure Data Lake is integrated with Azure Active Directory. It has role-based access controls over the Data Lake Store via \"POSIX-based ACLs for all data\" or \"Apache Ranger in HDInsight,\" Microsoft's announcement explained. Organizations have single sign-on and multifactor authentication access options. Data are encrypted at rest via the service or Azure Key Vault . Data are encrypted in motion using the Secure Sockets Layer protocol. \nAzure HDInsight Support Microsoft also announced some additions to Azure HDInsight this week. One addition is R Server for HDInsight , which is now generally available. It's Microsoft's implementation of the R programming language \"integrated with Spark clusters created from HDInsight,\" which can process terabytes of data. When it is run on Apache Spark, R Server \"enables handling up to 1000x more data and up to 50x faster speeds than open source R,\" Microsoft claimed. A new capability is the ability to work with Spark SQL data sources. It's supported for developers and data scientists with an included R Studio Server Community Edition, but they can also use R Tools for Visual Studio. \nMicrosoft also issued a preview of the open source Kafka for HDInsight . It's designed to enable the ingestion of \"massive amounts of real-time data.\" It can be used for operations such as \"fraud detection, click-stream analysis, financial alerts, or social analytics solutions,\" the announcement indicated. It's also designed to work with Storm for HDInsight or Spark Stream for HDInsight stream analytics solutions. About the Author \nis senior news producer for the 1105 Enterprise Computing Group. <>",

      "text": "Tech Talk: Why Microsoft Joined The Linux Foundation   Daniel Fuller \nA new era in the tech world is upon us, driven by the rise to power of new blood in big companies who are friendlier and more modern in their approach to the rest of the tech world. If you want proof of that, look no further than Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella. Much like Sundar Pichai has with Google, Nadella has softened Microsoft up a bit and made the company as a whole more willing to embrace what’s going on around them. The latest example of that behavior is in Microsoft’s joining of the Linux Foundation as a Platinum member. When Bill Gates and Paul Allen founded Microsoft way back in the day, and eventually brought Windows to the world, they were basically in direct competition with Unix and Linux. Today, Linux dominates the backend of the tech world. Servers and AI programs from multiple companies run Linux-based operating systems, and the core kernel of Android is based on the Linux kernel. Even in the consumer market, GNU/Linux and Linux kernel-based operating systems are giving more and more longtime Windows users a breath of fresh air. The Linux Foundation is a coalition of companies dedicated to protecting the open-source ideals behind the entire thing, and Satya Nadella is the first leader of Microsoft to recognize the importance of that. \nMicrosoft has been embracing and adding to the open-source ecosystem in big ways recently, even going as far as implementing a Linux-based BASH shell into Windows 10, which had the added benefits of giving the divisive OS a killer app, and helping developers to work more smoothly with projects encompassing both Linux and Windows. In the same press release where Microsoft announced their membership in the Linux Foundation, they also announced that Google is now a part of the Microsoft .NET Foundation, a consortium of companies and developers who use and advocate for Microsoft’s in-house .NET framework, which has in recent years gone open-source and painted itself as a cross-platform development powerhouse. This is only part of the complete 180 that Microsoft has pulled regarding the open-source community in the past few years, and you can bet your bottom dollar that it will continue well into the future. Don’t expect Windows to become a free and open-source OS or anything major like that, but you’ll be seeing Microsoft employees’ names in a lot more GitHub entries for prominent open-source projects. \nSo, what does all of this mean for Android? For starters, as a member of the Linux Foundation, Microsoft will be working more closely with Linux and its variants than ever before, Android included. This means a future with more Microsoft apps and services available on Android, enhancements to existing ones, and even a chance that open-source versions of Microsoft’s most powerful and popular software like Office will pop up, though the chances of that happening any time soon are pretty slim. The implications of Google joining the .NET Foundation are a bit more broad for Android and Chrome OS. As the industry standard cross-platform development tool, .NET is powerful enough and certainly widely used enough that we may begin seeing the kind of things that people could normally only do on a PC head to other devices. Processor architecture, as in x86-based PCs and ARM-based phones and tablets, becomes a bit less of an obstacle when a given program’s underpinnings can be found in a multi-platform toolset. The same goes for Chrome OS; being based on Linux and able to run on both ARM and x86 processors, Chrome OS’ app ecosystem, and thus Chrome’s, will benefit from Google jumping on board with .NET. This goes double for Chrome OS, since support for Android apps is becoming commonplace. Presumably, whatever Andromeda ends up being, it will feel the love as well. Let’s not jump the shark here; this is big, but we’re not going to be seeing OK Google on the Windows 10 desktop or Crysis 3 on Android solely because of this. If things like that happen, of course, today’s developments are probably at least partially responsible. Post navigation",

      "text": "E-mail \nDuring the annual Connect(); developer event, Microsoft unveiled a series of products and partnerships which strengthen the company’s Azure cloud platform. In an interesting turn of events, Microsoft has joined the Linux Foundation as a Platinum Member to promote open source development which is a key element of their new strategy. Additionally, Microsoft welcomed Google to the independent .NET Foundation and working with Samsung to enable .NET developers to build apps for more than 50 million Samsung devices worldwide. \nOn another note, Microsoft Cloud and Enterprise Executive Vice President Scott Guthrie demoed a preview of Visual Studio for Mac which allows developers to write mobile, cloud and MacOS applications. Microsoft also showed a preview of the next flagship SQL Server database with support for Linux, Linux-based Docker and Windows environments. As you can see, the company is trying to give developers all the right tools to produce content on any platform. \nCollaborating with the community \nAs part of its effort to work more closely with the open source community, Microsoft on Wednesday announced it has joined the Linux Foundation as a Platinum Member. Microsoft’s membership in the Linux Foundation will benefit customers through increased collaboration and innovation among a diverse ecosystem. \n“By becoming a Linux Foundation Platinum member, Microsoft is better able to collaborate with the open source community to deliver transformative mobile and cloud experiences to more people,” said Jim Zemlin, executive director of The Linux Foundation. “Microsoft has been a key contributor to many projects, and we see the company intensifying its involvement and commitment to open development.” \nMicrosoft has become an active member of the open source community in part through the popularity of its open source and cross-platform application framework .NET Core. Wednesday’s addition of Google to the .NET Foundation’s Technical Steering Group further reinforces the vibrancy of the .NET developer community as well as Google’s commitment to fostering an open platform that supports businesses and developers who have standardized on .NET. \nOther industry leaders are also betting on .NET Core for their own commercial products. On Wednesday Samsung is releasing a preview of its Visual Studio Tools for Tizen. Developers can use the tools to build .NET apps for the Tizen operating system that runs on millions of Samsung TVs, wearables, mobile devices and many IoT devices around the world. \nTools for any developer on any platform \nMicrosoft highlighted several announcements Wednesday aimed at helping developers use the tools of their choice to create Android, iOS and Windows apps powered by Linux or Windows Server, including the following: The SQL Server on Linux public preview released Wednesday is the first preview of the next version of SQL Server and brings the power of SQL Server to Linux and Linux-based Docker containers, in addition to Windows. A new Visual Studio for Mac preview provides a macOS-based integrated development environment designed for building mobile, cloud and macOS apps. The availability of Azure App Service on Linux with support for Containers in preview provides native Linux support for Node.js and PHP stacks on Azure App Service and now enables developers to bring their own Docker-formatted container image. \nEnabling better apps through the intelligent cloud \nToday’s most impactful apps are using data to delight users and drive business outcomes. Microsoft today unveiled unique capabilities and services that make it easier for more developers to turn massive amounts of data into deeply personal, intelligent and predictive applications. SQL Server 2016 Service Pack 1 availability makes database innovations accessible to more applications across product editions. The availability of Azure Data Lake services, Azure Data Lake Analytics and Data Lake Store means developers and data scientists now have the capabilities required to easily store and process data at petabyte size files, with massively parallel analytics and enterprise-grade security for insights on data of any size, shape and speed. \nImproving the end-to-end developer experience \nMicrosoft’s solutions evolve with changing developer needs. Through the Visual Studio family, SQL Server, Windows, Office and Azure, Microsoft is working to provide the most complete platform for application innovation, spanning mobile and cloud. The Visual Studio Mobile Center preview announced Wednesday brings together the cloud and life-cycle services that help developers build, test, distribute and monitor apps built in Objective-C, Swift, Java, Xamarin and React Native for Android-, iOS- and Windows-based devices. The Visual Studio 2017 release candidate released Wednesday includes new capabilities to help any developer be more productive than ever for any application and any platform. Visual Studio Team Foundation Server 2017 and Azure Application Insights are now available, providing an enhanced collaboration and DevOps platform for cloud- first, mobile-first scenarios.",

      "title": "Microsoft Surface Book, Surface Pro 4 Black Friday Deals 2016 | Gospelherald.com",
      "text": "Comment Could the discounts offered by Microsoft point to the impending release of a Surface Book 2 and a Surface Pro 5? Rumors and leaks have pointed in such a direction. Andrew Burton/Getty Images \nBlack Friday is always an event that is looked forward to when it comes to the end of each November, for the very simple fact that one will be able to save a whole lot of money in the process with the right deals in place from a range of vendors and retailers. If you have been hankering after some sleek looking Microsoft hardware to make up part of your gadget arsenal but have held off the purchase decision because you find it challenging to balance the books at the end of the month, fret not. Microsoft has revealed details of its Black Friday sale , where among them include a massive $430 discount off its family of Surface devices, as well as huge savings on Windows 10 computers. Even the relatively new Xbox One S will not be exempt from such price slashes, although you cannot expect a phenomenal discount but rather, a sizeable one. \nMicrosoft’s Black Friday 2016 deals will be launched online on Wednesday, November 23 at 9 p.m. PST. This is one day earlier that many other retailers, which might be a good place to start with an early mover advantage. There will be in-store events that will also kick off at participating locations on Thanksgiving Day itself, and will make its way to all Microsoft Stores on Black Friday itself. \nAll of the Microsoft Surface deals will be available from Thanksgiving Day until Cyber Monday, which falls on November 28. These deals are not location specific, but will be made available to all Microsoft Stores and Best Buy locations. We have been reliably informed that consumers can look forward to a minimum $400 discount off the Surface Book i5 256GB , and a very good example of this would be via through Microsoft an exclusive Best Buy bundle with Surface Pro 4 128GB and the Signature Type Cover -- retailing for $599. \nThose who prefer to get a spot of gaming with a better experience can definitely look forward to the Xbox One S bundle. If you would like to enhance your console gaming sessions at home, then you are able to opt for any new Xbox One S bundle for $249, which would be a $50 discount off the regular $299 price tag. Microsoft as well as a slew of participating retailers such as Best Buy and Target will be offering the same $50 discount on any new 1TB Xbox One or Xbox One S bundle -- as long as you make the purchase between November 20 and November 23. Should you be tired of your existing game library, fret not -- Microsoft will now slash the price of Gears of War 4 as well as the whole Gears Xbox 360 Collection by $25, while giving ReCore a $20 discount. \nXbox Live Gold members are able to benefit from early access to the Black Friday digital deals on November 18 itself, in addition to some other exclusive sales. Certainly this is another example of membership having its privileges, right? Are you stoked with what Microsoft has in store for the masses this Black Friday? ",

      "text": "SC orders Google, Yahoo and Microsoft to remove online sex-determinations ads SC orders Google, Yahoo and Microsoft to remove online sex-determinations ads The Supreme Court on Wednesday issued a strict directive to all online search engines over illegal advertisements and information on sex determination tests. By: FE Bureau | New Delhi | Published: November 17, 2016 6:00 AM \nThe Supreme Court on Wednesday issued a strict directive to all online search engines over illegal advertisements and information on sex determination tests. It asked popular search engines like Google India, Yahoo India and Microsoft India to remove such content within 36 hours of receiving a complaint. It also directed the Centre to constitute a nodal agency to keep a tab on keywords used on search engines to enable a system of ‘auto-block’ that would black out such information. \n“If it’s found that there are certain words which facilitated sex determination, then those words should be deleted in 36 hours,” a bench headed by justice Dipak Mishra said.“We direct the Union of India to constitute a nodal agency which would give advertisements on TV, radio and in newspapers….that if anybody comes across anything which identify a girl or a boy (at pre-natal stage), it should be brought to the notice of the nodal agency. \nOnce it is brought to the notice of the nodal agency, it shall inform the search engines and they, after receiving the information, are obliged to delete it within 36 hours and inform the nodal agency,” the bench said while fixing the matter for further hearing on February 17. \nThe apex court had earlier said search engines are under an obligation to check pre-natal sex determination advertisements and they should develop an in-house method to prohibit such content. \nThe government told the bench that the search engines had agreed to follow the law on sex determination and would not allow any advertisement or “publish any content” violative of the Pre-conception and Pre-natal Diagnostic Techniques (Prohibition of Sex Selection) Act or PC-PNDT Act. \nRapping online search engines like Google, Yahoo and Microsoft for patently violating Indian law, the apex court had earlier asked the Centre to hold a meeting with its technical experts and the search engines so as to find a solution to check such ads and information on pre-natal sex determination being hosted by them. It had also directed the search engines to strictly comply with Indian laws and block advertisements on sex determination of a foetus. \nThe court was hearing a PIL filed by Sabu Mathew George in 2008 seeking a blocking or withdrawal of advertisements relating to pre-natal determination of sex on popular search engines. \nHolding such advertisements to be violative of the PC-PNDT Act, 1994, the petition claims that using the internet for promoting or communicating about the practise of undertaking sex determination or sex selection was prohibited and punishable under the Act. \nThe 1994 Act was enacted to stop female foeticides and arrest the declining sex ratio in India. It banned pre-natal sex determination.Sex determination, though illegal, is still practised in India, which is grappling with a severe male-female ratio. India’s child sex ratio dropped from 964 in 1971 to a low of 918 in 2011, according to UN data. \nBetween 2001 and 2011, the decline was seen in over two-thirds of the districts in the country. Numbers show that the problem is worse in urban areas. In 2011, Delhi, the National Capital Region had one of the lowest child sex ratios among states, with 871 girls born for every 1,000 boys.

      "text": "Microsoft joins Linux Foundation, to launch Visual Studio for Mac By Mizgan Masani Nov 17, 2016 04:54 PM EST Microsoft joins with the Linux Foundation and launches Test Build Visual Store for Mac Advertisement \nMicrosoft announced today that it is joining Linux Foundation as a high-paying Platinum member. \n\"This may come as a surprise to you, but they were not big fans,\" said Linux Foundation executive director Jim Zemlin. Linux Platinum members are those who are high-paying to the company. Advertisement \nMicrosoft is one of the biggest open source contributors around the world. Over the last few years, it has essentially built Canonical's Ubuntu distribution into Windows 10, brought SQL server to Linux, open sourced core parts of its .NET platform and partnered with Red Hat, SUSE and others. \nAs Zemlin noted, Microsoft has also contributed to a number of Linux Foundation-managed projects like Node.js, OpenDaylight, the Open Container Initiative, the R Consortium and the Open API Initiative. \nDespite all that, this announcement will come as a surprise for many people, given that Microsoft and Linux community always felt like they were at war and never really got along. \nZemlin although, acknowledged, \"There will be some skepticism, but that will be from a smaller group.\" \n\"There is an anti-establishment sentiment in open source. That's natural,\" he pointed out. \nHe added that whenever a major corporation goes open source, that's what happens. But he also noted that Microsoft has been \"walking this talk for a very long time\" now. \nAccording to the TechSpot , Microsoft has launched the first preview of Visual Studio for Mac and a nearly-final version of Visual Studio 2017 for Windows. Microsoft officials tell ZDNet that the final / general availability version of Visual Studio 2017 should be ready by early 2017. \nMicrosoft has changed pretty radically since the days when co-founder and then-CEO Bill Gates declared its goal to be \"a computer on every desk and in every home, running Microsoft software.\" \nIt has dumped unprofitable businesses like portable music players, made Office free on some devices, and adapted to a world in which many developers use multiple languages and products interchangeably. \n",

      "text": "November 17, 2016 at 07:46 AM EST Microsoft Bets Big On Wind Thursday, November 17, 2016 Microsoft Bets Big On Wind Microsoft Corporation has always been known for their image of environmental protection but this may be their biggest validation to date. The tech company announced on Monday they are in the process converting their datacenter in Cheyenne Wyoming to rely entirely on wind energy. Microsoft will be using three wind farms, two in Kansas owned by Allianz Risk Transfer AG, and the other by Black Hills Corp. in Wyoming. The farms will provide Microsoft with 178 megawatts and 59 megawatts of capacity in wind power respectively. Microsoft uses datacenters to operate their cloud services. These facilities require an ample amount of electricity to function and the usage levels are only growing as the service becomes more conventional. Microsoft’s goal is to attain a level of 44 percent use of renewables by the end of the year. This is simply another dimension of competition for tech companies promoting cloud services. Amazon web services (AWS) hopes to achieve a level of 40 percent reliance on renewables by the end of the year. Google only taps into clean energy for 35 percent for their datacenters. Black Hills Corp. is one of the two companies entering the contract with Microsoft. The publically traded company disclosed on October 25th they would be offering a dividend for any of their shareholders prior to November 15th. The stock has been showing a downward trend since the announcement but will likely rebound based on the future success with their new partner. The company’s stock climbed 30 cents following Microsoft’s press release. Microsoft has always been considered a safe long-term investment. With an average earnings growth rate forecasted at 8.13 percent over the next five years, the company is generally a safe investment choice. Under Microsoft’s agreement with Black Hills, any surplus power can be stored in backup generators and later distributed to the grid at a discounted rate. In terms of their public image, this will benefit both firms. Corporate promotion of renewable energy is becoming routine for industry leaders. Governments often provide tax cuts to these companies for taking the initiative and aligning their interests with global efforts. Bloomberg forecasts that the top 50 corporations that purchase solar and wind energy will have accounted for 63.4 gigawatts of total production added by 2025. This can be chalked up as another victory for renewables as we slowly shift away from common power sources like coal and oil. Local Wyoming consumers will prefer this alternative, more eco-friendly source of power as opposed to power from the grid likely produced using power plants. On a larger scale, as we observe the nation moving away from fuel sources such as coal, crude oil, and natural gas, we can expect the price of these products to decline. Investors should write long-term futures in any of these sources as they are replaced. To hedge their bets, individuals should buy green ETFs, made up of environmentally friendly corporations.

      "text": "Microsoft really has changed, Linux Foundation chief says Jim Zemlin welcomes Microsoft to the open-source consortium U.S. Correspondent, IDG News Service | November 17, 2016 Email a friend Use commas to separate multiple email addresses From Your message has been sent. Sorry There was an error emailing this page. \nScott Guthrie, the executive vice president in charge of Microsoft's Cloud & Enterprise division, greets Linux Foundation Executive Director Jim Zemlin on stage at the Microsoft Connect conference in New York City on November 16, 2016. Credit: Blair Hanley Frank 29% off RTIC 30 oz. Tumbler - Deal Alert \nMicrosoft made a splash in the tech industry on Wednesday when it announced that it had joined the Linux Foundation as a platinum member. While the move felt like a welcome extension of the tech giant's open source strategy to some, others saw it as a threat to Linux. \nMicrosoft's addition to the foundation was a positive step for the open-source community overall, Jim Zemlin, the executive director of the Linux Foundation, said in an interview. In his view, adding Microsoft as a foundation member is an important move to further the Linux Foundation's mission, \"which is to create the greatest shared technology asset in history.\" \n\"I think there is a burden on the broader open-source community — again, I think that there's a healthy anti-establishment sensibility — but there's the act of being the anti-movement, the rebel movement, and there's the act of being the mainstream movement. And to be in the mainstream does require broadening your tent and bringing as many people into that tent as possible.\" [ Best Bluetooth speakers: We'll help you find the best wireless speakers for pairing with your smartphone or tablet—whatever your budget, and whatever music floats your boat. ] \nThe two organizations have been working together for a while. The first public partnership between the foundation and Microsoft appeared last year, when they announced a certification for running Linux on Azure. \nBut Microsoft has been helping out the foundation in other ways, Zemlin said. Microsoft engineers have contributed to the popular Node.js project, and the company is lending its security expertise to the Core Infrastructure Initiative, a project aimed at helping to secure key open-source tools. \nWhen asked whether Microsoft was joining the Linux Foundation to destroy the open source operating system, as some commenters have mused online, Zemlin said he's \"just not a big conspiracy theorist.\" It would be rather difficult for Microsoft to kill Linux at this stage, he said, and Microsoft was already following through on a commitment to open-source software. \n\"First of all, when you join the Linux Foundation, you're obligated to support the mission of our organization, which is to support the growth of Linux and open source,\" he said. \"And Microsoft has not only committed to doing that as a part of our organization, but I've got to tell you, they're pretty much already doing it.\" \nThis isn't Microsoft's first rodeo as a member of an open-source group. The company is also a member of the Apache Software Foundation and the Eclipse Foundation. Microsoft has also been opening up its own products: It released .NET, PowerShell, and other tools under open-source licenses. GitHub revealed it is the company with the largest external contributor base for projects it has released. \nTo be fair, the company is paying US$500,000 for its membership, but Zemlin doesn't seem like the sort of person who would put aside potential issues with Microsoft for a big chunk of cash. He was one of the foundation's leading voices speaking out against the tech titan's past actions. \nMicrosoft is facing competitive pressures to engage with open source, thanks to the interest of its customers, as well as the changing times in computing. And as Zemlin pointed out, there's no way Microsoft alone can carry the day when it comes to building the software people need. \n\"In a world where things are in the cloud, everybody has a computer, there is too much software to be written for even Microsoft, with all their engineers, to write it on their own,\" he said. \"It ain't gonna happen.\" Related:",

Microsoft is tying executive bonuses to diversity gains. Photo by Fred Dufour/AFP \nSAN FRANCISCO, U.S. – Microsoft on Thursday, Nov 17, said it is looking to link some executive pay to team diversity gains as part of a drive to increase the number of women and minority workers. \n\"We have the opportunity to create enduring, long-lasting change that can impact more than just our own interests, but those of society as a whole,\" Microsoft chief diversity and inclusion officer Gwen Houston said in a blog post. \n\"The challenge is real – so is the opportunity.\" \nThe blog post came as Microsoft provided a snapshot of the ethnic and gender makeup of its workforce as of end-September that showed what Houston described as \"modest progress.\" \nThe number of women employed by Microsoft slipped by one percentage point from the previous year, to 25.8%, due in large part to a restructuring that resulted in closing some factories associated with its unsuccessful mobile-phone business. \nWhile the number of women working in production positions decreased, those working in technical and leadership jobs rose 0.6%, according to Houston. \nShe described hiring trends as optimistic, with about 28% of new employees during the past year being women, and nearly 22% of the hires in technical positions. \nNumbers of African-American and Latino employees were each up marginally from the prior year to a respective 3.7% and 5.5%, according to Microsoft. \n\"Although these numbers suggest only slight gains, our hiring trends again give us some reason for optimism,\" Houston said. \nTo promote diversity in its ranks, Microsoft is dedicating resources to initiatives that include \"tying senior leaders' compensation to diversity gains in their respective organizations\" and internal training to prevent prejudices from coloring hiring decisions. \nLack of racial and gender diversity in the US technology industry has been a topic of intense debate and criticism in recent years. \nReports published regularly show a workplaces dominated by white or Asian men, typically coming from prestigious universities. – Rappler.com HOW DOES THIS STORY MAKE YOU FEEL?

      "title": "Why Microsoft beat Salesforce to acquire LinkedIn",
      "text": "November 18, 2016 Microsoft beat Salesforce to acquire LinkedIn because it offered all cash and less risk, said LinkedIn CEO Jeff Weiner.   Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff was a class act throughout the negotiations, but at the end of the day it came down to dollars and cents, said Weiner. \"Microsoft's offer was of greater value - an all cash offer versus stock and cash -where Salesforce would have potentially been diluted in a way where the stock that they offered to lose value, at least in the near term,\" said Weiner. Weiner's comments came at the Code Enterprise conference in San Francisco Tuesday night. Microsoft will integrate LinkedIn's social network into its suite of products such as Office, Windows, Outlook and Azure to reach over a billion customers, said Weiner. With Linkedin, Microsoft will have a better understanding of who its users are and can create more value out of existing products, he said. Benioff has called on European regulators to investigate the deal on anti-trust concerns. Even after the Microsoft takeover is complete, which is expected to happen by the end of the year, LinkedIn will continue to partner with companies such as SAP, IBM and Salesforce and determine how its data are used, said Weiner. Salesforce has significant market share when it comes to customer relationship management software and ultimately, more competition is good for customers, said Weiner. Source:",

      "text": "By Vlad Dudau News Editor Neowin LLC @avladd · 4 seconds ago with 0 comments \nMicrosoft is working hard to make sure its Windows 10 operating system and the apps that come with it are optimized for a touch experience, and support inking and drawing. The Maps app has had such capabilities for a while now, but the latest update, released yesterday, expands on those, and lets users do a lot more. \nThose of you using the latest version of Windows 10 and having the newest Maps app installed can try out all the new features right now. The company has focused on improving the touch and pen experience inside of the app, to allow for “even more natural” interactions. \nUsers have been able to draw on the map using their pens, and add annotations on different points of interest. But now, they’re also able to calculate the distance of a route drawn on the map using touch or pen. They can also use the ruler tool when there’s a need to draw quick and easy straight lines. Finally, lines drawn on the map between two points will now map a real route, which lets users calculate exact directions, travel times and so on. \nAll in all, though minor, these changes should lead to a better experience for Maps users, especially if they enjoy using a Surface Pen. However, Microsoft wasn’t done, and added support for one new peripheral inside of the Maps app: the Surface Dial. \nThe Surface Dial was originally unveiled alongside the Surface Studio desktop PC , but the peripheral works with any Windows 10 PC . Maps users will be able to take advantage of the new device, and use it to rotate, zoom, or change map perspective easily. They’ll even be able to use the Dial to control the ruler on the map, supposedly “making it more natural to interact and create using both hands”. \nAs mentioned above, you can try out all these new features right now provided you have the latest version of Maps. Oh, and don’t worry if you don’t own one of Microsoft’s fancy peripherals, all the features work just as well with your finger or a mouse.",

      "title": "Microsoft to tie exec bonuses to diversity goals",
      "text": "Microsoft to tie exec bonuses to diversity goals By DINA BASS Bloomberg News First Published 28 minutes ago • Updated 28 minutes ago Share This Article Microsoft will tie executive bonuses to workforce diversity goals after the company saw a second consecutive year of declines in the percentage of women employees, owing to its exit from the phone handset market. The percentage of women working at Microsoft fell to 25.8 percent from 26.8 percent of the company's workforce as of Sept. 30, largely because the Nokia handset factories that Microsoft divested employed a larger number of women, said Gwen Houston, the company's chief diversity and inclusion officer. Houston said she's encouraged by an increase in women in technical and leadership positions, as well as in recent hiring trends. VIDEOS TOP JOBS The percentage of African American/Black and Hispanic/Latino employees saw \"very modest gains\" of 0.2 percent to 3.7 percent of Microsoft's total workforce and 0.1 percent to 5.5 percent of employees, respectively, Houston said. \"The modest gains for people of color — those are so slight I really want to see them improve,\" she said. \"That's an area of focus that I am really committed to.\" While the total numbers need improvement, Houston said new hires of women and racial minorities has increased. Women represented 27.7 percent of new hires this year and 21.7 percent of those hired for technical jobs. Of the new employees, 6.6 percent were African American/Black and 7 percent were Hispanic/Latino. Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella, after a bumpy start marked by a gaffe over equal pay at a women in tech conference, has made diversity a key priority for the company. He is expected later Thursday to detail a plan to make diversity goals one of the factors in whether senior executives get their full annual bonuses, Houston said. In addition to training for managers, Nadella talks about the diversity work at each of his monthly question-and-answer sessions with employees, Houston said. \"Diversity and inclusion is something you've got to ingrain, you've got to keep talking about the business value, you've got to keep talking about the impact,\" she said. \"That's what Satya has been doing. We, of course, have more to do.\" To boost hiring of women and minorities, the company has added human resources workers with experience in that area, and Nadella funded the tripling of an internship program called Explorer for college freshman and sophomores interested in technology, Houston said. The company is also running focus groups in several U.S. cities with underrepresented groups to ask participants what would motivate them to choose careers in tech. The results will be used to improve advertising and recruiting campaigns.",

      "text": "By Vlad Dudau News Editor Neowin LLC @avladd · 4 seconds ago with 0 comments \nMicrosoft is continuing to push HoloLens in the enterprise and manufacturing world as a powerful tool that can revolutionize the way people work. As part of that strategy the company announced earlier this year it was partnering with Vuforia, an enterprise-focused, augmented reality (AR) platform. Now, the latest version of Vuforia’s SDK is out for the public, with support for HoloLens development. \nMicrosoft’s HoloLens is an impressive piece of technology, but so far it’s mainly been aimed at companies, enterprises , manufacturing plants and other industries that have specific needs . The high cost of a mixed reality HoloLens headset , and current limited capabilities have relegated the device to the professional market – but Microsoft is very happy to dominate that growing market. \nNow, Vuforia, which boasts to be an enterprise-focused augmented or mixed reality platform, with over 275,000 developers, has put out a new SDK version with support for HoloLens. One of Vuforia’s main features is that it allows AR device to recognize objects in the real world, and surface relevant information about them. This offers some very powerful use cases that can transform and simplify the way people work. For example, using Vuforia, a HoloLens headset can recognize each individual part of a motor and present the user with information, suggestions, possible issues that need addressing and so on. \nMicrosoft hopes this added capability and precision will makes its HoloLens headset even more attractive and useful for businesses and enterprises everywhere.",

      "text": "Downloads \n193 k Microsoft Outlook is the official app for the popular Microsoft email client for Android that'll let you easily and comfortably manage your email accounts. Like most apps of this kind, Microsoft Outlook includes pop-up notifications every time you receive an email (although this can be deactivated), calendar and contact synchronization, and folder viewing and synching. In fact, you can use your folders to easily filter all incoming mail. Apart from all this, Microsoft Outlook lets you sync several email accounts on your Android device and keep them all active at the same time. Of course, when it comes to writing emails, you can choose between the different accounts, attach files, and do all the other things you can do on the desktop version of the program. Microsoft Outlook is quite a useful email management tool that will prove to be really easy-to-use for those who use the desktop version. It is, in short, a (more or less) interesting alternative to the undisputed king of email clients on Android: Gmail. Outlook 2.0 for Android gets a complete design revamp \nAlthough it took them a while, Microsoft has figured out how to adapt to the latest trends by opening their tools to the general market and fitting them together with standards from the smartphone world and technologies applied by Google. The official Outlook for Android client, for instance, can be used to manage Gmail, iCloud, or Yahoo accounts, and can also be associated with external cloud storage services, calendars, and contacts books. Now the new 2.0 version of the client has been launched and strongly embraces Android design standards .",

      "text": "Securing your applications with F5 Virtual Editions in Microsoft Azure   16-Nov-2016 by skf5 ​ F5 article afm azure cloud public cloud security virtual edition \nIn Nov 2015, F5 announced the availability of F5 BIG-IP virtual editions in Microsoft Azure Cloud. What this meant to our enterprise customers is the ability to create advanced networking and security policies in azure. More importantly, our customers were able to achieve consistency in services across their on-premises and Azure environments. When we talk about security, incorporating a network firewall is critical. \nTypical network firewall functions are facilitated by attaching L2 interfaces to separate security zones. This would mean setting up a dedicated virtual NIC interface (VNIC) for each VLAN on a virtual machine. In Azure the number of VNICs supported differ by compute instance type. Larger instances have higher VNIC interfaces but also incur a higher cost. However there is another way to segment zones in azure through the use of UDR (user defined routing). In a nutshell, UDR provides a means for enterprises to design, and secure, the Azure networking infrastructure. For further information on UDR, please refer to the link below. \nUsing UDR along with the F5 Advanced Firewall Manager (AFM) service, you can implement advanced firewall protection for both N-S and E-W data traffic. Here are a few key capabilities of F5 AFM: \n· Policy based access control to and from address/port pairs; \n· Network firewall rules and logging at a global context level, or at a virtual server level; \n· Stateful and full proxy architecture: a flow from the client is passed to the backend only if it is deemed secure; \n· IP Intelligence, Global and virtual server based Denial of Service (DOS) attack protection that can be configured for thresholds on multiple network parameters; and \n· Programmability through iRules offering dynamic packet filtering capability. \nTo get you started with using UDR and F5 AFM, here is an example scenario. We have an F5 ADC to manage traffic to the backend tiers. We have two backend tiers (database tier and Application tier). Our goal is to stop traffic from database tier connecting to Application tier while allowing data to flow in the opposite direction. The network topology is illustrated below \n\nHere are the steps required to implement this scenario. \n\nStep2: Enable IP forwarding in Azure \nStep3: Create IP forwarding Virtual Server in BIGIP \nStep4: Create AFM Policy in BIG-IP \n\nThere are different ways to create UDR: \n1. PowerShell \n2. Azure CLI \n3. Template \nWhile creating UDR, you must provide the next hop address which is the IP address of your BIG-IP. The example below shows an UDR created for Application tier Subnet. \nHere, the address prefix is 10.2.2.0/24 which is the destination CIDR (of the database tier). The next hop address is 10.2.0.4 which is the private IP address of the BIG-IP. This route is associated to the subnet WebAppSubnet with address range of 10.2.1.0/24. With this, packets from any WebApp subnet destined for any database subnet will be routed through the BIG-IP. \n\nPrerequisites: Create a Virtual Network in new Resource Group in Azure. When you do this a default subnet will be automatically created. Create two additional subnets for the WebApp and Database tier in your Virtual Network. \nCreate UDR for WebAppSubnet: \n1. Create route ‘RouteToDatabase’– directs traffic destined for database subnet to BIGIP. \n$route = New-AzureRmRouteConfig -Name RouteToDatabase ` -AddressPrefix 10.2.2.0/24 -NextHopType VirtualAppliance ` -NextHopIpAddress 10.2.0.4 \n2. Create route table in the region deployed (in this example –westus region used). \n$routeTable = New-AzureRmRouteTable -ResourceGroupName Group2 -Location westus ` -Name UDR1 -Route $route 3. Create a variable vnet that contains name of your virtual network where this subnet is. $vnet = Get-AzureRmVirtualNetwork -ResourceGroupName Group2 -Name Group2-vnet 4. Associate the route table WebAppSubnet. Set-AzureRmVirtualNetworkSubnetConfig -VirtualNetwork $vnet -Name WebAppSubnet `-AddressPrefix 10.2.1.0/24 -RouteTable $routeTable 5. Save configurations in Azure. Set-AzureRmVirtualNetwork -VirtualNetwork $vnet \nOnce created, the table looks like the following . \nCreate a similar UDR for database tier. Once done, the table looks like the following. \nStep 2: Enable IP Forwarding on NIC associated with BIG-IP: 1. $bigipnic = Get-AzureRmNetworkInterface -ResourceGroupName Group2 -Name bigip1234 (bigip1234 is the network interface created for BIG-IP.) 2. Enable IP Forwarding.",

      "text": "Red Hat Announces Availability of Microsoft SQL Server Public Preview on RHEL GO Public Preview of SQL Server is not supported for production Nov 17, 2016 23:59   Today, November 17, 2016, Red Hat, the world's leading provider of open source solutions, was pleased to announce the general availability of Microsoft's SQL Server on Linux Public Preview for its Red Hat Enterprise Linux operating system. The news comes just one day after Canonical's announcement that the Public Preview of Microsoft SQL Server on Linux was made available to users of the popular Ubuntu operating system, and it now looks like you can install SQL Server on your Red Hat Enterprise Linux computers as well, enjoying a powerful and advanced relational database management system. \"The next version of SQL Server on Linux, Microsoft’s data management and business analytics platform, is now available as a public preview on Red Hat Enterprise Linux. SQL Server on Linux Public Preview provides users with a choice of development languages, data types and deployment methods, and now features support for docker-formatted Linux containers,\" reads today's announcement . Microsoft's .NET Core also available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux As expected, the availability of Microsoft's SQL Server for Red Hat Enterprise Linux comes as huge news for corporations and businesses where Red Hat's powerful Linux-based operating system is deeply appreciated and heavily used for both cloud and local infrastructures. SQL Server on Linux promises access to the SQL Hands-on Lab hosted on Microsoft Azure, but the Public Preview is not supported for production. Soon, customers will be able to access images of the Red Hat Enterprise Linux operating system on Azure with the SQL Server Public Preview pre-installed. This is not Red Hat's first rodeo with Microsoft, as the company also announced a few months ago the availability of Microsoft's .NET Core open source project for Red Hat Enterprise Linux and Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform. In related news, Red Hat announced the release of Red Hat Software Collections 2.3 and Red Hat Developer Toolset 6 .",

      "text": "\n(Adds Microsoft declines comment, details) \nBy Foo Yun Chee \nBRUSSELS, Nov 16 (Reuters) - Microsoft has offered concessions to EU antitrust regulators over its $26 billion bid for social network LinkedIn, the European Commission said on Wednesday, as the U.S. software company seeks to allay concerns over its largest ever deal. \nThe move came after the EU competition enforcer expressed concerns about the deal at a meeting with Microsoft executives last week. \nThe Commission, which will rule on the deal by Dec. 6, did not provide details. It is expected to seek feedback from rivals and customers before deciding whether to accept the concessions, demand more or open a full investigation. \nMicrosoft declined to comment. The LinkedIn acquisition will allow it to add a suite of sales, marketing and recruiting services to its core business products as it gears up for next-generation computing. \nLinkedIn makes most of its $3 billion annual revenue from job hunters and recruiters who pay a monthly fee to post resumes and connect with people. \nU.S. rival Salesforce, which lost out on the bidding for LinkedIn, has warned of the threat to innovation and competition and urged regulators to examine the antitrust and data privacy issues thoroughly before clearing the deal. \nMicrosoft however sees competition from social network Facebook and wants regulators to take that into account, people familiar with the matter said.

      "text": "print \nBRUSSELS, Nov 16 (Reuters) - Microsoft has offered concessions to EU antitrust regulators over its $26 billion bid for social network LinkedIn, the European Commission said on Wednesday. \nThe move came after the EU competition enforcer expressed concerns about the deal at a meeting with Microsoft executives. \nThe Commission, which will rule on the deal by Dec. 6, did not provide details. It is expected to seek feedback from rivals and customers before deciding whether to accept the concessions, demand more or open a full investigation. \nThe U.S. software company is making its largest ever acquisition, which will allow it to add a suite of sales, marketing and recruiting services to its core business products as it gears up for next-generation computing.

The first “Story Stretch” appeared last week. Another appeared Wednesday night. The next one airs in January. \n“We are pleased and honored to be part of one of the best new shows on television this year,” said Kathleen Hall, GM of global campaigns and brand marketing at Microsoft. “The writers and producers of Lethal Weapon were interested in innovating with us beyond traditional static product placement to deepen product experiences and content extensions that benefit both our brands. We’re excited to be able to offer meaningful content to the avid and growing Lethal Weapon fan base.” \nIn addition to the Fox ad sales group, the Fox Brand Partnerships unit worked on the sponsorship, with the Microsoft Brand Advertising and Research Team, the Microsoft Windows Devices Group and Microsoft agencies including Dentsu Aegis’ Empower Media and branded content agency The Story Lab. \n“In the age of DVR viewing, this partnership takes in-show brand integration and branded content to a new level,” added Nate Norrish, VP of brand partnerships at The Story Lab. “We wanted to create something that extended the storyline and blended into commercial time – making it feel authentic to the show while extending and rewarding our audience’s attention.” Want to read more stories like this?",

      "text": "\nWe’re heading towards the end of 2016 more than two years after Microsoft first introduced Windows 10 and over 4 years since Microsoft introduced the new Windows apps framework in Windows 8 and Microsoft still hasn’t figured out how to make them work for users who want to be productive.\nMicrosoft’s universal Windows apps are light, they are great, and in some cases, I’ve begun to default to using them over Win 32. Take OneNote for instance, despite being a UWP app and a Win 32 desktop app, for my needs, the universal Windows app is more than sufficient. The same applies to Windows Mail, despite Microsoft already having a full featured Outlook Client on Windows 10, the basic Mail and Calendar app does wall I need.\nYesterday, Microsoft finally brought a new version of paint to Windows 10. Paint 3DPreview, which had been demonstrated at Microsoft’s Windows 10 event last month, now comes built into Windows 10 – replacing the earlier version of Paint that used to ship. I’m very certain Paint 3D is a universal update to the Windows Paint app that had formerly shipped with Windows (ignoring the fact that Microsoft already had a universal Paint branded app in Fresh Paint), but its replacement highlighted one issue with UWP for me that I could no longer avoid by opening the Win32 version of said app. When using Paint to handle multiple images, I would often copy and paste between multiple instances of Paint. Allowing me to work on multiple pictures and then combine them (I don’t do heavy photo editing so paint is enough most times). With the universal Paint app, you can’t do that as Microsoft forces the app to run in only a single instance – and this is a problem with UWP.\nTo be exact, it has been a problem ever since Microsoft shipped Windows 10. Consider, Universal Windows apps are the future of Window – so Microsoft intends us to be productive and creative on universal apps on our PCs and tablets, yet none of Microsoft’s Windows 10 Apps supports running multiple instances of a single app. If you decide to go all in on UWP, you can’t view multiple Word Documents, you can’t run Multiple Powerpoints, nor can you open multiple Excel Workbooks, you’re stuck with single instance versions of all.\nThis is especially odd as it is not a UWP limitation as far as I know. Many Universal Windows apps allow you to run them in multiple instances/windows. Heck, Microsoft even introduced the ability to run multiple tabs in Maps, and pop out Windows in the Mail and People apps but has made no move towards allowing users of Windows 10 Office apps or apps that truly need “windows” to be “productive”.\nIt is irritating and limiting, and there’s no real explanation for it.\n",

      "text": "EncryptedRegView is a free portable program for Microsoft Windows operating systems that reveals encrypted data in the Registry.\nThe program is another Nirsoft application which means that you can run it from any location without installation. All you need to do is download the archive -- a version for 32-bit and 64-bit versions of Windows is provided -- and extract it afterwards to the local system.\nYou may use the program to scan the local Registry for encrypted data, or point it to a Registry file in another location instead.\nEncryptedRegView scans the Registry based on your selection on the start screen and displays any data that is encrypted with the Data Protection API (DPAPI). This API is used by Microsoft and third-party software.\nEncryptedRegView review \nThe scan takes a moment to complete and displays the data sorted by Registry key path by default. You can change the order with a click on any of the table headers, for instance by decrypted value, decryption result or hash algorithm.\nA click on an entry lists the decrypted information in the lower pane. You may go through any to reveal names, web addresses, email addresses, location information, passwords and other data this way.\nYou will get \"failed\" entries by default. The program is run without elevation by default which means that any data that is system protected may not be decrypted. A right-click on the program executable and selecting run as administrator should resolve this issue.\nAs far as options are concerned, you may use search functionality to find keywords that you enter, save selected items to several different formats (txt, csv, xml), or generate HTML reports.\nYou may load Registry files as well as mentioned earlier. The program displays a dialog on start, also available via Options > Advanced Options, that provides you with these loading options.\nSimply switch to \"scan the Registry of an external drive\" to enable it, and pick one of the available files that EncryptedRegView supports:\nRegistry Hives Folder User Registry File User Classes Registry File Protect Folders You may also select a root folder instead to have the program pick up the relevant Registry files automatically. Also, you may need to supply a Windows login password for the decryption process to complete successfully.\nClosing Words EncryptedRegView is one of those handy Nirsoft applications that you may have use for every now and then. Since it is portable and can be run from any location, it is a good addition to any troubleshooting or tools collection.\nGhacks needs you. You can find out how to support us here or support the site directly by becoming a Patreon .

      "text": "ZDNet Japan Microsoft adds 3D Paint to latest Windows 10 Creators Update test build Microsoft is beginning to add more of the larger, creator-focused features coming to its next Windows 10 release with this week's Build 14971 for Fast Ring Insider testers. \nMicrosoft has added the 3D version of Microsoft Paint to the latest test build of the Windows 10 Creators Update (codename \"Redstone 2\"). Credit: Microsoft \nWith the Fast Ring Insider build that went to PC testers on November 17, Build 14971 , Microsoft introduced a preview of 3D Paint app, codenamed \"Beihai,\" as part of the operating system bundle. Microsoft showed off 3D Paint as a key component of its strategy to target \"creators\" with the next version of Windows 10 , that's expected to be available to mainstream users around March 2017. \n\"The Paint 3D Preview app is now included as part of Windows 10,\" said Windows Insider chief Dona Sarkar in a blog post outlining what's new in test build 14971. The preview is currently available only in English. \nWith Build 14971, PowerShell also becomes the defacto commmand shell, replacing Command Prompt in File Explorer's File menu and in the the Win + X Menu. Microsoft still will allow those who prefer to use Command Prompt to change settings to keep it as the default on their machines. \nThe ability to read EPUB books in Microsoft Edge is part of Build 14971, as is the second test release of the new \"Get Office\" app, which is meant to integrate Windows 10 and Office even more tightly together, and has been known as \"Office Hub .\" The first version of Office Hub was in Windows 10 test build 14965 . \n\"Whereas before Get Office was largely a collection of links to help you get started with Office, the new and improved app will help you explore and manage your Office experience. Easily discover and launch apps and see all your recent Office documents in one place! We still have the familiar help links, but we've redesigned the experience to make easier to find what you're looking for,\" said Sarkar in the aforementioned blog post. \nThere are a number of other fairly minor features and quite a few fixes in Build 14971, including ones for Edge, translation, notifications and inking. As usual, there are also several known issues in this build -- in particular, ones that affect a number of apps like Store, Photos, People and Microsoft Studios games. \nAn early version of the Windows Holographic First Run app is in this build. This is part of Microsoft's work to bring the Windows Holographic Shell to Windows 10 Creators Update . The First Run app won't be able to do much in this week's build. \nThere's nothing new for Windows 10 Mobile testers in Build 14971, though Microsoft did roll out to Slow Ring Windows 10 Mobile testers last week's Build 14965 . Sarkar said that Microsoft is not planning to release any new test builds next week, as it is the week of U.S. Thanksgiving. More Windows 10",

      "text": "Microsoft’s New App Lets Colorblind People See The World We See It   02:59 PST \nPeople who are colorblind clearly see the world differently from the rest of us. Sure, the unique perspective is interesting and fascinating, but it’s not very practical and can sometimes prove to be dangerous. However Microsoft has recently come up with an app that will be able to deal with this. \nDubbed the Color Binoculars, basically this app uses your smartphone’s camera to adjust objects that it is looking at in such a way that people who are colorblind can see the objects as they were meant to be seen. According to Tom Overton, a Microsoft software engineer, “It’s an app that helps colorblind people distinguish color combinations that they would normally have trouble telling apart.” \nHe adds, “For example, since I have difficulty distinguishing between red and green, our app makes reds brighter and greens darker so that the difference is more obvious. It replaces difficult color combinations, like red and green, with more easily distinguishable combinations, like pink and green.” \nThe app will offer three different modes that are catered to the major types of colorblindness, red/green, green/red, and blue/yellow. It also seems that at the moment the app is only available on iOS and we have no idea if there are plans to bring it to Android, but colorblind iOS users will be able to download it from the iTunes App Store . \nFiled in Cellphones .
