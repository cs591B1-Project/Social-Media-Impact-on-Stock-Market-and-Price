      "text": "Courtesy of Fox December 1, 2016 | 07:34AM PT \nJack Bauer could save U.S. Presidents and endure horrendous bouts of torture. But there’s one thing this TV hero was never able to accomplish: Getting Ford Motor Co. to return as a major sponsor of his popular Fox drama, “24.” \nWhen “24: Legacy,” a retooled version of the popular spy drama, debuts on Fox’s airwaves following the network’s broadcast of Super Bowl LI in January, it will mark a return of sorts for Ford, which pulled back from the series slightly after its third season and in a more pronounced way after its sixth. The series’ new protagonist, a character named Eric Carter (played by actor Corey Hawkins), will be spotted driving a Ford pick-up truck, while other Ford vehicles are expected to appear in the series throughout the season. \nIn an early screening of the series’ pilot, Ford was listed as a “24” sponsor, as was consumer-electronics manufacturer Samsung. During a presentation at an annual Television Critics Association this past summer. Fox Television Group co-chairman and co-CEO Dana Walden suggested Samsung would have a broader partnership with the drama. Ford and Fox declined to make executives available for comment. \nFord’s return to the series in such a major way (individual Ford ads have run in “24” in the interim, to be sure, and its vehicles have been used as props) is a testament to the power an advertiser can gain by having a strong association with a particular program, event or genre. PepsiCo and Anheuser-Busch InBev have sponsored the Super Bowl for so long their advertising is expected as part of the experience. General Electric has woven itself into NBC’s “Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon, ” as the underwriter of an occasional segment about young inventors. AT&T has been tied to TBS’ “Conan” since the late-night program launched in 2010. \nFord’s turn with “24” proved to be a harbinger of things to come in the evolving business of TV advertising . When Ford was a major sponsor of the series in 2003 and 2004, it opened two consecutive seasons with commercial-free premieres that were book-ended by longer-than-normal ads for Ford and played off the look and feel of the series. In one of the executions, a character named “Mr. Bauer” drove a Ford F-150 pick-up. Ford’s Expedition was also featured during one of the seasons. \nIn 2016, ads have grown even more intertwined with shows, as anyone who has seen Hyundai and Microsoft ads airing during AMC’s “The Walking Dead” that riff on that show’s zombie themes can tell you. \nFox had to work harder than usual to get the earlier Ford ads to work. Making the episodes commercial free meant having to find time in other shows for the network’s affiliates, which had to give up precious local ad minutes as part of the proceedings . \nAfter Ford decided to tamp down the prominence of its ad support in 2004, other automakers grew interested. Agent Bauer suddenly seemed quite pleased with a Hyundai Genesis in both “24: Redemption,” a TV movie based on the series, as well as in the show’s seventh season. More recently, when Fox launched a limited run of “24” in the late Spring of 2014, Chrysler was attached to the show, along with Sprint . Cisco, Allstate and Unilever have also been associated with the series at different times in its history. \nFord and Fox have worked together in noticeable ways for years. Ford was a longtime sponsor of “American Idol,” and continues to be associated with the network’s comic-book serial “Gotham.” Ford once even managed to crash into sitcom “New Girl,” gaining prominent in-show placement (and dialogue) when the title character took a job as a hostess at an auto show. Some critics complained the automaker’s outsize presence in the scene distracted viewers from the program. \nTaking part in “24” won’t be cheap. The average cost of an ad in the show is said to total around $138,720, according to Variety’s annual survey of primetime commercial prices . Some packages associated with the program are believed to cost more. Filed Under:",

(Photo: Richard Vogel/AP) \nFord on Wednesday accused the Obama administration of playing \"eleventh-hour politics\" after the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said it would recommend keeping strict greenhouse emission standards in place through 2025, despite a major industry lobbying effort aimed at relaxing those standards.. \nFord signaled that it hopes that President-elect Donald Trump will roll back the regulations. \nFord's uncharacteristically harsh public statement was at the forefront of a chorus of criticism hurled at the EPA and the Obama administration after the government tossed aside concerns repeatedly expressed by the industry since July about emission regulations that will take effect between 2020 and 2025. \nThe battle between the industry and the Obama administration also sets up the the potential that the incoming Trump administration could take control of the review process and scale back the regulations automakers initially agreed to in 2012. \n“It is deeply disappointing that eleventh-hour politics in a lame-duck Administration has short-circuited a data-driven process for developing regulation,\" Ziad Ojakli, Ford's group vice-president of government and relations, said. \"Ford and the industry stand ready to work with the next Administration and Congress to find a way forward.\" \n►Related: EPA decides to stick with strict auto emission rules \nThe Auto Alliance, the industry's leading lobbying group, sent a letter to Trump’s transition team that specifically asked the incoming team take part in the mid-term evaluation of automotive regulations “to ensure that these are consistent with the policy objectives of the new administration.” \nGloria Bergquist, vice president of the alliance, said it’s an open question whether the EPA can conclude a public comment period and “turn it around and finalize” the decision before Trump’s inauguration on Jan. 20. The U.S. Department of Transportation, which oversees a related set of fuel economy standards, has not completed its regulatory review. \nBergquist said the EPA made its announcement without coordinating with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. \"What if NHTSA comes up with a different standard?” said Bergquist. \nThe Trump transition team did not immediately respond to questions Wednesday. \nThe auto industry argues that the regulations scheduled to take effect from 2020-25 will cost automakers billions and will force the industry to introduce technology consumers are not willing to pay for, pushing consumers out of the new vehicle market. \nThe U.S. EPA and the Obama administration view the regulations as one of the current president's signature achievements because automakers have aggressively improved fuel economy and cut emissions as they complied. \nAccording to the EPA, the average per vehicle cost for automakers to meet the 2025 standards, compared to the 2021 standards, is just $875. With the fuel efficiency gains from the new vehicles the EPA estimates a consumer with a five-year loan would break even on the additional vehicle cost within one year. \nBy law, the EPA and the U.S. Department of Transportation, which separately regulates fuel economy, had until April 2018 to make a final determination. Automakers want a break on tough fuel standards \nJanet McCabe, EPA acting assistant administrator for the office of air quality division, repeatedly denied the agency was trying to speed up the mid-term review process in an attempt to prevent a Trump administration from making changes. \nThe agency's decision to reach its conclusion early was \"based on exhaustive analysis, public comments, and thorough consideration of an extensive technical record,\" she said. Outraged reaction \nHere is roundup of key reactions from automakers, industry groups and politicians: \n\"The evidence is abundantly clear that with low gas prices, consumers are not choosing the cars necessary to comply with increasingly unrealistic standards. Wishing this fact away does no one any favors, and getting this wrong has serious implications.\" \n-- Auto Alliance, which represents 12 major automakers \n“Washington today decided to make new cars and trucks more expensive for America’s working men and women. The outgoing administration has chosen to halt progress on fuel economy by enacting a policy that will delay the introduction of safer and cleaner vehicles by making them more expensive.\" \n--Peter Welch, president of the National Automobile Dealers Association \n\"General Motors is disappointed that EPA changed the process and decided to advance the timetable for completing the Mid-term Review of the 2022-2025 model year fuel economy requirements. This unexpected action appears to dismiss the many comments and questions raised by automakers.\" \n-- General Motors \n\"I look forward to working in the next congress with the new administration to pare back all of the legacy saving regulatory actions this administration will continue to advance as their January 20th deadline approaches.\" \n--U.S. Sen Jim Inhofe, R-Okla., chairman of the U.S. Senate Environment and Public Works Committee \n\"Today I spoke with Administration officials and expressed concerns about the Environmental Protection Agency’s process in developing today’s proposal.\" \n--U.S. Senator Debbie Stabenow, D-Mich. \n“This action is completely unnecessary and will have grave consequences on jobs and manufacturing ... with the clock ticking on the administration, the regulatory frenzy is under way” \n--Fred Upton, R-Kalamazoo, and two other Republican members of the House Energy and Commerce Committee \n\"What's not to like about a plan, agreed to by the automakers, that cuts oil use, saves money at the pump and reduces pollution? Numerous studies demonstrate that automakers have ample, affordable technology to achieve the program’s cost-effective goals, including certainty for the industry.\" \n--Dan Becker, director of the safe climate campaign \n\"The decision today was based on a lengthy, technical review. It simply reaffirms an existing regulation. For this process to be undone, an equally significantly technical analysis would have to be completed and would have to come up with contradictory findings.\" \n--John Boesel, president and CEO of CALSTART, a lobbying group for clean transportation technology. \nContact Brent Snavely: 313-222-6512 or bsnavely@freepress.com.

      "text": "Ford, GM Reported 'Remarkable' November Sales: More Squawk From Jim Cramer Ford auto sales in November jumped 5.2% vs. the same month a year ago. Giovanni Bruno Dec1,201610:22AMEST \nNEW YORK ( TheStreet ) -- Ford's ( F ) auto sales in November jumped 5.2% from the same month a year ago, well above estimates of a 0.8% increase. The Ford F-Series completed its best November since 2001 due to strong F-150 and Super Duty retail demand. SUV sales rose 20%, and the Lincoln division increased 19%. \n\"This is a remarkable number for Ford,\" TheStreet's Jim Cramer said on CNBC's \"Squawk on the Street\" Thursday morning. \"A lot of people felt that November would be a weaker month because some of the retail sales numbers, but obviously, they don't carry over to this.\" \nCramer noted the strong sales number reported with the company's F-150, despite uncertainties from the Alcoa ( AA ) spinoff Arconic ( ARNC ) , which houses Alcoa's businesses supplying automotive markets. \nArconic and Ford signed an agreement this year making Ford the first automaker to utilize Arconic's advanced automotive aluminum commercially. \n\"A lot of people had been concerned that the F-150 had been peaking, this is obviously a very strong number,\" Cramer said. \nHowever, a Wall Street Journal article casts a shadow over the results, saying that subprime auto loans have risen to their highest levels since 2010 in the third quarter. \n\"We have heard it before. I think it's worth monitoring. I watch it through AutoNation ( AN ) and CarMax ( KMX ) . They have the best call on it and so far they are not panicking,\" Cramer stated.

      "text": "By Reuters / Reuters   11:24   \nDETROIT (Dec 1): Hefty discounts during a robust Black Friday weekend helped boost November US auto sales between 4% and 5%, the first automakers to report said on Thursday, which could catapult results this year above a record high in 2015. \n\"All economic indicators show significantly improved optimism about the US economy,\" said Mustafa Mohatarem, chief economist at General Motors Co. \"The US auto industry is well positioned for sales to continue at or near record levels into 2017.\" \nEach month, auto sales offer an early snapshot of US consumer spending. \nThe robust sales helped push automaker and auto dealer shares up. In Thursday morning trade, GM rose 4.4%, Ford jumped 6.6%, and leading auto dealer group AutoNation Inc advanced 5.3% while the Dow Jones industrial average added 0.3%. \nMarket leader GM's sales rose 10.2% to 252,644 new vehicles in November. GM said the average selling price of its vehicles in November in the US market was nearly US$35,800, about US$4,000 higher than the industry average. \nGM reported lofty sales for its big SUVs and pickup trucks, which are higher priced than sedans and other passenger cars. \nFor the industry, GM expects November sales at 17.9 million on a seasonally adjusted annualized sales rate, which would be short of an annualized rate of 18.25 million reported in November 2015. \nTwo more selling days in November made the comparisons to year-ago sales easier to top, but the annualized sales rate was more difficult to match. \nToyota Motor Corp narrowly outsold Ford Motor Co, by fewer than 100 vehicles. Ford sales rose 5%, outpacing expectations, while Toyota nearly matched estimates with a 4.3% gain over the year earlier. \nUsually, Ford is No. 2 in US sales behind and Toyota is third. \nFord said retail sales rose 10% as fleet sales fell 9%. Retail sales count vehicles sold directly to individual consumers, while fleet sales are multiple-vehicle transactions to rental agencies, businesses and government. \nGM said retail sales rose 8% in November. \nNissan Motor Co beat expectations with a 7.5% rise in US sales to 115,136 vehicles. \nA Thomson Reuters poll of 35 economists showed expectations of a of 17.7 million vehicles for November in the United States. A separate poll of nine Wall Street analysts by Reuters showed expectations of 17.8 million in annualized sales. \nWall Street analysts expect Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV to fare the poorest among major automakers, with some forecasting a 14% drop from last November.",

      "text": "December 1, 2016 — American / Project / Under $20k | 4 Comments Rusty Sage Green Project: $4K 1956 Ford Thunderbird \nThis 1956 Ford Thunderbird is described as a non-running “barn find” featuring a correct 312 Y-block, automatic, and power options. It’s also wearing an interesting factory color called Sage Green. Advertised as the least expensive (first generation) T-bird available, which is likely true, the car is unfortunately pretty rusty and missing both of its tops, but it does retain quite a few good parts and might not be too difficult to get running again–structural repairs are another story. Find it here on Craigslist in Lake Toxaway, North Carolina for $4k. \nRust aside, the Sage Green finish retains an interesting patina complete with general fading and a few areas where paint has rubbed through. Some of said spots show prior repairs with filler underneath, and bodywork is also a bit dented and wavy on the passenger side. Rust is pretty serious and has made its way through the same front fender, both rockers, and front valance. The missing hard top is quite a bummer and we’d expect the soft top to need replacement anyway, however missing tops and spare tire cover are the least of this car’s problems. \nFloors are also rusted through, but despite plenty of surface corrosion underneath, no holes are visible in the single chassis photo–the trunk pan is in surprisingly solid shape as well, aside from a single small hole. Door trim panels are absent along with the radio and wheel center, but the car is said to have featured full power accessories. Interestingly, much of the dash wears a contrasting teal, though several interior colors were offered for this year. \nOriginality isn’t touched on, but the 312 Y-block V8 actually looks to be in OK shape despite not currently running. It could certainly use to be cleaned up of course, but it should respond well to some straightforward maintenance, obviously provided it isn’t seized. \nReads the entire ad: “This is a barn find ’56 T-bird not running yet. It is a 312, automatic, power steering, power brakes, power seat, power windows car. There are no tops with it. It needs to be restored, or re-do the running gear and drive it around as a survivor and conversation piece for sure, and you can still get around in having fun, till you can restore it. Contact me if you have questions or need more pictures. Thanks. The cheapest bird around. Trades considered.” \nHere’s a better look at the rusty floor and neighboring rocker and body panel. Note how the floorpan has rusted through around the body mount, and the rocker through the inside-out. Don’t consider this one without a PPI. \nThe ask seems about right given all the car’s issues, most of which happen to be rot. We hope it’s rescued, and that the wonderful color is considered if someone ambitious enough to consider full restoration ends up with the keys next. Related Stories",

      "text": "GM, Ford, Toyota post strong November U.S. auto sales Toyota Prius automobiles are shown for sale at a dealership in Carlsbad, California. Photo: Reuters Tweet Published: 12:10 AM, December 2, 2016 \nDETROIT - Hefty discounts during a robust Black Friday weekend helped boost November U.S. auto sales between 4 percent and 5 percent, the first automakers to report said on Thursday, which could catapult results this year above a record high in 2015. \n“All economic indicators show significantly improved optimism about the U.S. economy,” said Mustafa Mohatarem, chief economist at General Motors Co. “The U.S. auto industry is well positioned for sales to continue at or near record levels into 2017.” \nEach month, auto sales offer an early snapshot of U.S. consumer spending. \nThe robust sales helped push automaker and auto dealer shares up. In Thursday morning trade, GM rose 4.4 percent, Ford jumped 6.6 percent, and leading auto dealer group AutoNation Inc advanced 5.3 percent while the Dow Jones industrial average added 0.3 percent. \nMarket leader GM's sales rose 10.2 percent to 252,644 new vehicles in November. GM said the average selling price of its vehicles in November in the U.S. market was nearly $35,800, about $4,000 higher than the industry average. \nGM reported lofty sales for its big SUVs and pickup trucks, which are higher priced than sedans and other passenger cars. \nFor the industry, GM expects November sales at 17.9 million on a seasonally adjusted annualized sales rate, which would be short of an annualized rate of 18.25 million reported in November 2015. \nTwo more selling days in November made the comparisons to year-ago sales easier to top, but the annualized sales rate was more difficult to match. \nToyota Motor Corp narrowly outsold Ford Motor Co, by fewer than 100 vehicles. Ford sales rose 5 percent, outpacing expectations, while Toyota nearly matched estimates with a 4.3 percent gain over the year earlier. \nUsually, Ford is No. 2 in U.S. sales behind and Toyota is third. \nFord said retail sales rose 10 percent as fleet sales fell 9 percent. Retail sales count vehicles sold directly to individual consumers, while fleet sales are multiple-vehicle transactions to rental agencies, businesses and government. \nGM said retail sales rose 8 percent in November. \nNissan Motor Co beat expectations with a 7.5 percent rise in U.S. sales to 115,136 vehicles. \nA Thomson Reuters poll of 35 economists showed expectations of a of 17.7 million vehicles for November in the United States. A separate poll of nine Wall Street analysts by Reuters showed expectations of 17.8 million in annualized sales. \nWall Street analysts expect Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV to fare the poorest among major automakers, with some forecasting a 14 percent drop from last November.

      "text": "Carrier Corp. says it will retain about 1,000 workers for its Indianapolis operations after initially indicating manufacturing would shift to Mexico. (IBJ file photo) \nPresidential jawboning is back. American companies beware. \nDonald Trump isn’t even president yet but in a span of just 12 days he’s twice claimed victory in getting major U.S. corporations—Ford Motor Co. and Carrier Corp.—to keep manufacturing jobs in America. The Carrier deal will be officially unveiled Thursday afternoon in Indianapolis. Regardless of how substantive the deals prove to be, the strategy signals that the man who prides himself as a master negotiator will use his bully pulpit to cajole companies into toeing the administration line, a tack reminiscent of the bygone interventionist policies of Lyndon Johnson, John F. Kennedy and Teddy Roosevelt. \nMany experts say the piecemeal approach, while saving some jobs, is probably too little, too late to reverse the long-term decline in manufacturing employment in America. \nWhat’s more, for companies caught in Trump’s cross-hairs, risks abound. For one thing, no CEO or company wants to be a highly-public target of the president’s ire. (Carrier barely even tweeted about the discussions before the deal was reached.) And even if they’re granted financial incentives to keep jobs at home, corporations may find themselves stuck using antiquated technology at high costs, putting them at a disadvantage to rivals who have shifted jobs to low-cost countries. \n“If Congress wants to erect some kind of financial Berlin Wall that prevents U.S. companies from locating productive assets abroad, let them pass a law,” said Daniel Griswold, a senior research fellow at George Mason University’s Mercatus Center. “But let’s not have our president bullying U.S. companies to retreat from global supply chains and global markets.” Apple and Oreos \nTrump made reversing manufacturing job losses a staple of his presidential campaign, thrilling Midwestern crowds with promises to scrap or renegotiate trade deals and slap tariffs on imports if necessary. It’s likely no coincidence that Ford and Carrier, a unit of United Technologies Corp., are the first to announce pullbacks from Mexico. They were two of his favorite targets during the campaign. So too were Mondelez International Inc., the maker of Oreo cookies, and Apple Inc. \nMike Mitchell, a spokesman for Mondelez, said the company has spent $450 million since 2012 to modernize domestic factories and remains “committed to investing in our U.S. manufacturing network where it makes business sense to do so, as we seek to become more efficient, effective and competitive.’’ Apple said it was “investing heavily in American jobs and innovation.’’ \nIt’s possible, as the Apple and Mondelez statements suggest, that all this attention from the president-elect will force companies to think a bit more about saving domestic jobs and a bit less about near-term earnings—an outcome that would be well received by many across the U.S. political spectrum. \n“National interest is now shoulder-to-shoulder with shareholder interest,” said Nicholas Heymann, an analyst with William Blair & Co. \nCarrier will keep about 1,000 jobs at a factory in Indiana, the company said in a statement late Wednesday. Incentives offered by the state were “an important consideration,” it said, without elaborating. \nMoving the operations would have saved the company about $65 million a year, which translates to a relatively insignificant 2 cents a share in earnings, said Howard Rubel, an analyst with Jefferies. Trump has pledged many times to cut corporate tax rates and regulations to spur job growth. \nUnited Technologies, a major defense contractor, may be currying favor with the incoming administration, said John Mutz, chairman of the policy committee of the Indiana Economic Development Corp. “When you’re a supplier and the new administration is coming in, you want them to think favorably of you as a supplier,’’ Mutz said. \nWhat landed Carrier on Trump’s radar was its announcement in February that it was cutting 1,400 jobs in Indianapolis. Trump highlighted the news at rallies across the country. The threat of a 35 percent tariff on air-conditioning units and goods returning to the U.S. would scare Carrier executives into reversing their decision to move the jobs, he said. Ford's hot seat \n“Here’s what’s going to happen,’’ Trump said during an April 27 rally in Indianapolis. “They’re going to call me and they are going to say, ‘Mr. President, Carrier has decided to stay in Indiana.’’’ \nOn Tuesday night, Trump tweeted that he had reached a deal with the company. \nTrump also put Ford on the hot seat during the campaign for manufacturing vehicles in Mexico. But the circumstances of the automaker’s retreat from Mexico are even murkier than the Carrier deal. In a tweet on Nov. 17, Trump appeared to claim responsibility for Ford changing course on moving production of a Lincoln sport-utility vehicle, the MKC, to Mexico. He posted the tweets after Bill Ford, the company’s executive chairman, told him that the automaker no longer planned to move MKC production to Mexico. \nFord, though, never planned to close its Louisville plant, which also builds the Escape SUV that outsells the Lincoln version by 12-to-1. Ford already makes the Lincoln MKZ sedan in Mexico and is still planning to move all its North American small car production to Mexico. \nIntervention of this magnitude has little precedent in recent American history. Back in the 1960s, Lyndon Johnson was quick to call up corporate executives he was unhappy with. Johnson’s obsession was fighting inflation, though, not protecting jobs. LBJ's obsession \nWhen Bethlehem Steel raised prices, he labeled the company unpatriotic and bullied it into backpedaling. And when he realized he had little ability to force farmers to scale back egg price increases, he ordered his surgeon general to issue warnings on the health hazards that eggs pose, Robert J. Samuelson wrote in “The Great Inflation and Its Aftermath.” \nJohnson’s efforts were largely unsuccessful. By 1968, the last year of his administration, inflation had jumped to 4.7 percent. \nTrump’s jawboning is trying to reverse a trend that goes back decades. U.S. manufacturing jobs have fallen by 29 percent in the last 20 years to a preliminary figure of 12.3 million in October, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Jobs lost Advances in productivity, aided by factory automation and technology such as 3-D printing, will ensure that most of the lost jobs won’t return, said Jefferies’s Rubel. \n“Manufacturing jobs represent a smaller part of the economy today than they ever have, and they can’t come back,” he said. \nEven as Trump and Vice President-elect Mike Pence are heralding the Carrier news in Indiana, for example, officers with United Steelworkers Local 1999 are negotiating with Milwaukee-based Rexnord Corp. on severance benefits for about 350 Indianapolis workers, union secretary Lisa Duncan said. The company is closing its plant there by June 2017 and shifting much of its bearings manufacturing to Mexico, she said. \nA Rexnord spokesman didn’t respond to a phone message seeking comment. \nOther experts suggest that Trump’s approach, even if successful at times, will harm the economy and companies. If firms like United Technologies retreat from global markets, they will become less profitable and competitive, creating fewer jobs, said George Mason’s Griswold. \nBesides, it’s ridiculous to think that Trump will go around the country hounding companies to save jobs in dribs and drabs, said Lee Branstetter, a nonresident senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. \n“It would be an enormous amount of effort and after a while people would start tuning out,” he said. “The 27th time he tries this, it’s just not going to have the same punch and he knows that.” \nPerhaps, but right now, the jawboner-in-chief appears to be just warming up.",

      "title": "GM, Nissan lead sales gains; FCA tumbles",
      "text": "Ford, Honda, Nissan, Toyota and General Motors posted U.S. sales increases in November as a rise in incentive spending helped nudge the industry back on track toward another record year.\nA 10 percent gain at GM and a 4.3 percent rise at Toyota Motor Corp. marked their strongest advances this year. Nissan Motor Co. climbed 7.5 percent, while Ford Motor Co. ended a four-month skid. The Volkswagen brand soared 24 percent. Fiat Chrysler was the exception among the first companies to report, tumbling 14 percent as fleet deliveries shrank.\nContinued demand for light trucks amid low gasoline prices helped boost automakers’ results, as did two additional selling days compared with November of 2015. Incentive spending last month, including Thanksgiving holiday deals, was up 13 percent vs. a year-earlier but down from October, according to TrueCar data. (See table below.)\nWhen other automakers release results later today, U.S. light-vehicle sales in November are forecast to rise about 3.8 percent from a year earlier, based on a survey of analysts by Bloomberg.\nWhat’s more, November is shaping up to leave the industry in a better position to top last year’s 17.47 million. Sales through October were 0.3 percent behind their year-earlier pace after three straight monthly declines.\nIf the industry manages to eke out an annual gain, 2016 would mark the first time in a century that U.S. sales topped year-earlier levels for seven straight years. Sales rose every year in a nine-year stretch through 1917\nCompany by company \nGM's 10 percent increase reflected increases of 8.1 percent at Chevrolet, 14 percent at GMC, 16 percent at Buick and 14 percent at Cadillac.\nGM said sales to retail customers rose 7.9 percent to 197,609 in November while rental shipments jumped 27 percent.\nVolume dropped at FCA on sharply lower fleet shipments, a 12 percent decline at Jeep and a 47 percent decrease at the Chrysler brand. It was the third straight monthly decline at Jeep.\nDeliveries rose 12 percent at Ram but slipped 21 percent at Dodge and 15 percent at Fiat. FCA said overall retail demand dropped 2 percent and fleet volume was off 42 percent last month.\nSales advanced 7.5 percent at Nissan last month, with deliveries rising 8 percent at the Nissan division and 3.6 percent at Infiniti.\nToyota's corporate increase reflected a 5.3 gain at the Toyota division. Deliveries slipped 1 percent at Lexus.\nHonda Motor Co. ended a three-month losing streak with a 6.5 percent increase.  Honda division volume was up 7.9 percent, offsetting a 5.1 percent decline at Acura.\nFord posted a 5.1 percent rise in November volume. Sales rose 4.5 percent at the Ford division and 19 percent at Lincoln. Ford's retail sales rose 10 percent while fleet shipments dropped 9 percent.\nStrong SAAR \nThe seasonally adjusted, annualized sales rate is projected to remain strong but drop to 17.7 million vehicles, according to a survey of analysts by Bloomberg. That would be down slightly from this year’s highest rate -- October’s 17.98 million -- and the 18.07 million pace in November 2015, the second-strongest month of last year.\nGM today estimated the November SAAR at 17.9 million units.\nThe early launch of Black Friday sales events helped offset declines in fleet sales in November, said Eric Lyman, TrueCar’s chief industry analyst.\n“The retail sales environment remains strong for new car sales,” Lyman said. “Incentives are also down slightly [from October] as automakers begin to address supply side imbalances with planned reductions in vehicle production.”\nSteady economic and job growth and the recent rise in U.S. equity prices have also encouraged consumers to make big-ticket purchases, analysts say.\nIncentive spending by automakers averaged an estimated $3,475 per vehicle in November, TrueCar estimates.\n‘Plateau’ \nMike Jackson, CEO of AutoNation Inc., the largest U.S. new-vehicle dealership group, said there is some relief among dealers and automakers now that the presidential election, and the uncertainty that the campaign cast over consumers, is over.\n“I still think we're in a plateau,” Jackson said this week. “There is a point of diminishing returns when whatever you give at the front end in incentives comes off residual values at the back end. We're right at that tipping point.”\nJessica Caldwell, an analyst for Edmunds.com, said luxury vehicles and light-truck demand in December will determine whether the industry hits a new milestone.\n“November sales have the industry well-positioned to set a new annual sales record this year, but a new record is far from guaranteed,” said Caldwell.\n“Expect to see a flood of ads for holiday season sales events in the coming days and weeks, especially for luxury brands, trucks and SUVs. If we see any year-over-year lifts in these segments in December, then it's a good bet that the industry will top last year's record-high sales.\"\nNick Bunkley contributed to this report.",

      "text": "Source: courtesy of Ford Motor Co. Ford Motor Co. (NYSE: F) released its November U.S. sales data Thursday morning and absolutely crushed growth forecasts. Overall the company’s volume sales rose 5% year over year, pushing year-to-date unit sales to 2.37 million, essentially flat year over year.\nFord maintained its customary lead in pickup truck sales with November sales of 72,089 units, up 10.6% from 65,192 in October of 2015. In October, Ford sold 65,542 F-Series trucks, following a September sales total of 67,809. For the first 11 months of 2016, F-Series pickup sales are up 5.5% year over year at 733,287 units.\nGeneral Motors Co.’s (NYSE: GM) Chevy Silverado sales experienced a sales increase of just 0.6% year over year to 45,280 units in November, while GMC Sierra sales jumped 14.4% to 18,900 units.\nFiat Chrysler Automobiles N.V.’s (NYSE: FCAU) Ram pickup sales increased 8% year over year in November to 36,885 units. Year to date, Ram has sold 441,862 units, also up 8% year over year.\nNovember buyer incentives remained high, but were a bit lower than October incentives: down 0.7% at FCA and 3.4% at GM. TrueCar estimated that Ford boosted its November incentives by 23% year over year, although that was 1.9% below the October 2016 incentives. Ford reported this morning that overall average incentives rose by $1,000 per vehicle year over year in November.\nMike Jackson, CEO of AutoNation, told Automotive News:\nI still think we’re in a plateau. There is a point of diminishing returns when whatever you give at the front end in incentives comes off residual values at the back end. We’re right at that tipping point.\nAnalyst Jessica Caldwell at Edmunds said:\nNovember sales have the industry well-positioned to set a new annual sales record this year, but a new record is far from guaranteed. Expect to see a flood of ads for holiday season sales events in the coming days and weeks, especially for luxury brands, trucks and SUVs. If we see any year-over-year lifts in these segments in December, then it’s a good bet that the industry will top last year’s record-high sales.\nThe other full-size pickups on offer in the United States are the Tundra from Toyota Motor Corp. (NYSE: TM) and the Nissan Titan. Tundra’s sales totaled 9,578 in November (up 11.5% year over year). The Titan sold 3,329 units in October, up a whopping 363% compared with November 2015.\nToyota’s midsize Tacoma pickup sold 15,531 units in November, holding its place as the leader in this space. Sales of GM’s midsize Colorado pickup rose 39.1% to 8,669 units, and sales of the GMC Canyon rose 52.5% to 3,410 in November. Nissan’s midsize Frontier pickup sold 5,105 units in November, up just 0.1% year over year. Honda Motor Co. Ltd. (NYSE: HMC) sold 3,464 units of its all-new Ridgeline midsize pickup, up from just three in November of 2015.\nIn the full-size pickup segment, November sales of 173,154 vehicles from the Detroit Three pencils out to a Ford market share of 41.6% (a month-over-month gain of 4.0 points). GM’s share came in at 26.1% for the Chevy Silverado (up 2.4 points) and 10.9% (up 2.3 points) for the GMC Sierra. Ram’s market share totaled 21.3% (down 3.9 points).\nI'm interested in the Newsletter Get Newsletter \nterms and conditions   ",

      "text": "Featured Vehicles Street Smart, Track Tough 1967 Ford Mustang Reaching new heights with Heidts Pro-G Wide-Track front and rear IRS suspension system for 1965-1970 Mustangs Evan J. Smith Freelancer December 1, 2016 \nMustangs capture the American spirit. They’re iconic with a storied history on the street, strip, and in open-track competition. With that, there are many ways to enjoy your Mustang, from racing to showing to just plain old cruising. But if you own a classic and are looking for enough punch to battle with the latest computer-controlled iron, you’ll need a dose of hp and modern suspension technology. \nThe stock suspension is nice for a jaunt around town, but for spirited driving, the 50-year-old suspension won’t cut it. Adding power and modernizing your suspension is the ultimate solution, and our performance prescription came from the team at Heidts Hot Rod & Muscle Car Parts in Lake Zurich, Illinois. Heidts is well known for its killer suspension systems, and we had the chance to follow the build and drive its own 1967 Shelby tribute Mustang. Last month in the February 2017 Mustang Monthly, we showed what goes into installing Heidts’ Pro-G bolt-in independent rear suspension (IRS), as well as details of its all-new front suspension for early Mustangs. This month, we take that same car to the track to test how it all works. The cornering is flat with a neutral balance. \nHeidts specializes in adapting modern suspensions to all types of muscle cars and hot-rods. For this project, they went full boogie by installing a 5.0L Coyote, six-speed Tremec, Wilwood brakes, and brand-new front and rear suspension components in the classic Mustang. Heidts’ selected its Pro-G front and rear suspension, which incorporates a new front clip with upper and lower A-arms, coilover shocks, anti-roll bar, and rack-and-pinion steering. Out back, the Pro-G includes a wonderful IRS that’s designed with its own tubular cradle, 9-inch center section, coilovers, and inboard brakes. These professionally engineered systems infuse today’s technology with classic muscle to dramatically improve ride quality, braking, handling performance, and your fun factor. \nAs we showed you last time, BlackDog Speedshop in Lincolnshire, Illinois, did the heavy lifting, removing the engine, driveline, and suspension. The crew also prepped the underside of the unibody for its Lizard Skin ceramic undercoat insulation and sound-control formula by Mascort Corporation of Houston, Texas. “We used a blue tint to color match the body,” Heidts’ Wallace Leyshon said. “That provided sound control and thermal protection, as well as great aesthetics.” \nWith the body ready to go, BlackDog installed the complete Heidts front and rear suspension systems and the 5.0 Coyote engine, the complete custom exhaust, fuel system, cooling, and master cylinder, plus they custom-bent most of the lines and hoses. Bruce Couture of Modern Driveline assisted, fitting the Tremec six-speed and Quartermaster driveshaft in place. BlackDog mounted the Ford Controls Pack computer through the firewall, which added protection and a factory-like look. It set up the parameters of the ECU, and the Coyote was barking. “We cannot thank BlackDog enough for going above and beyond, ensuring a clean install and ultimate performance,” Leyshon says. The heart of this Mustang can be found underneath, with the Heidts Pro-G front and rear suspensions. Up front, the IFS incorporates improved geometry and adjustability for all types of driving. \n“The ride quality of this ’60s muscle car was improved dramatically and the handling characteristics are on par with 5th Gen and other high-end performance cars,” Leyshon says about the Pro-G suspension. “That was our objective for the Project Shelby.” \nFit and finish of the kit is simply amazing. The combination of the suspension and the American Racing VN 257 wheels (17x8, front and 17x9.5 rear with 4 1/4-inch backspace), wrapped in Nitto (P225/45ZR17 front and P275/40R17 rear) tires gave the Mustang a perfect stance. The Mustang now sits low and flat, but the question remained: Would it remain as flat and composed when pushed on track? \nTo find out, we put the Heidts Mustang to the test at Autobahn Country Club in Joliet, Illinois, sharing seat time with autocross specialist Danny Popp and Pirelli World Challenge veteran (and BlackDog Speedshop owner) Tony Gaples. “The Mustang was just terrific,” Popp says. “Its handling through the autocross turns was flat, and I could throw it where I needed to.” The Coyote is controlled with the Ford Performance Controls Pack. \nHaving driven the Project Shelby at Autobahn in its “before” condition, I was excited to see how much better it handled with the Heidts Pro-G suspension. I hopped in, clicked my belt, and cut loose. The 5.0L Coyote has endless revs and amazing power, and about 100 more hp than the pushrod V-8 that it replaced. But right away, I noticed how nimble and light the car felt. \nThe steering was precise and weighted nicely, which was a huge improvement over the stock power steering. I remember the factory steering being overly light and somewhat numb. Turn-in on the autocross was quick, but not to the point where the front end was nervous, and the Mustang exhibited a touch of body roll as it rotated around the cones. I enjoyed a high level of compliance with the tires, as they stayed flat to the pavement, even under hard cornering. This allowed me to cut in aggressively and put the power down hard and fast with no drama to speak of. \nWhile I was hoping for a little oversteer to help it rotate on the tight autocross, the balance was more neutral, which is better for bigger tracks and sweeping corners. The team had the shocks in a stiffer setting, and even so, the ride quality was comfortable. A few clicks on the shocks would soften the ride for everyday driving. Inboard rear brakes reduce weight at the wheel, which helps cornering performance and ride quality. \nAs a purist, I respected the factory, period look for the interior, including the seats, Hurst shifter handle, and steering wheel, which connected to the rack via a sweet ididit column. Even the Digital Dakota gauges had a stockish look to them. And while I rolled with the top down, if things heated up, I could have flipped on the Vintage Air A/C unit and cooled off. \nI had a blast ripping it up, and it was a sad moment when I had to hand the keys back to the Heidts team. Project Shelby matched the timeless looks of a classic Mustang with hp, handling, and braking that’s comparable to any new Shelby. Behind the wheel, you feel like the king—enthusiasts will appreciate the iconic looks, and on track, you’ll have the performance to show ’em who’s the boss.",

By Jamie Butters and Keith Naughton Ford tore past analysts' estimates for U.S. sales on demand for pickups and sport utility vehicles, including the highest November deliveries F-series trucks since 2001. Toyota and Nissan also beat forecasts. Ford's light-vehicle sales in the month rose 5.1 per cent to 196,441, far better than the 0.5 per cent gain projected by analysts in a Bloomberg survey. Toyota's sales rose 4.3 per cent, compared to a 3.4 estimates, while Nissan gained 7.5 per cent, ahead of the predicted 4.6 per cent. Auto sales are running at near-record levels as the U.S. economy continued to expand with little inflation, according to a Federal Reserve survey. And relatively low gasoline prices, combined with aggressive promotions, are spurring sales of pickups and SUVs, which tend to be larger and less efficient than cars. So-called light trucks, which include minivans, may have outsold cars by 2-to-1 in November, according to Tim Fleming of Kelley Blue Book. Automakers and dealers drew from a grab bag of holiday-season tricks to sustain sales. General Motors dangled 20 per cent discounts nationwide on its Chevrolet, GMC and Buick brands in November, and makers of luxury autos revived annual promotions such as \"the Season of Audi\" and Lexus's \"December to Remember.\" And even though Ford tightened some discounts, individual retailers, such as Charles Gabus Ford in Des Moines, Iowa, spurred Black Friday traffic by offering a 65-inch 4K TV to anyone who bought a new Ford that day. Ford results were driven by a 19 per cent gain in SUV deliveries and an 11 per cent increase in sales of F-series pickups to 72,089. Ford's car sales plunged 9.7 per cent, led by an 18 per cent drop for the Focus compact. The automaker is moving production of that small car to Mexico from Michigan. \"Strong retail sales increases for both F-150 and our all-new Super Duty pickups drove F-series above the 70,000 vehicle mark — a November threshold we have not seen in 15 years,\" Mark LaNeve, Ford's vice president of U.S. marketing, sales and service, said in an emailed statement. Total light-vehicle sales probably rose about 3.8 per cent in November, according to the average estimate of analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. After accounting for two extra selling days this November, the annualized rate is projected to drop to 17.7 million vehicles — still above this year's average — from 18.2 million a year earlier, the strongest month of 2015. The projections reinforce the idea that industrywide sales, while at a high level, have plateaued and become more reliant on incentives. Fiat Chrysler Automobiles's U.S. unit is projected to report the biggest decline for the month, about 9 per cent, after paring truck incentives compared with October. Estimates vary widely in part because the company has revised its sales history twice in recent months and analysts are using different year-ago figures for November 2015. GM's full-size pickup incentives through Nov. 20 jumped 46 per cent from a year earlier to $5,753, according to data from researcher J.D. Power viewed by Bloomberg, compared with Ford's $4,467, a 5 per cent increase, and Fiat Chrysler's Ram at $6,062, up 19 per cent. Incentives that were introduced last month may ultimately help determine whether 2016 ends up as a record seventh straight year with an industrywide sales gain. Many of the automakers' deals pegged to Black Friday actually ran all through November and some stick around the rest of the year. \"If this month's forecast holds, December's year-over-year sales only need to be flat to set a new annual record in 2016,\" Jessica Caldwell, an analyst with Edmunds.com, wrote in an emailed statement. | Join The Conversation Sign Up Login Most Read",

They had a production-line robot named YuMi act as DJ for the launch party.\nI’m pretty sure no one even cared about the Fiesta after seeing this robot lay down the beats. Sadly it does not come with the car so that you can have a party anywhere you travel to, but that would be awesome. Ford should really think about including robots as an option with their cars. That’s the future!\nYou can check out how they trained YuMi with the help of a human DJ in the video below, or head over to Jalopnik to see the complete performance.\nThey should rent this robot out for parties at the very least.\n[via Jalopnik ]",

When you aren't busy shooting the latest Gymkhana video or building crazy modified Fords like the Hoonicorn to drive in them, you get to spend your time leaping over jumps in the factory Focus Global Rallycross race car. And, you get access to the super-secret Ford GT .\nView the original article to see embedded media. Fortunately for us, Block isn't great at keeping secrets, so he posted this video on Instagram showing him getting a look at the inside of the GT. Production of the amazing supercar is getting close (finally!), so this is a better representation of the car's final configuration than photos the company released previously showing the concept car's cabin.\nPhoto: Ford Visible in all the photos is the red button that fascinated Block. It looks like a starter button, but maybe it actually fires the ejector seat. We'll just have to wait and see.\nPhoto: Ford ",

      "text": "2017 Ford Mustang Blue Edition review by Ciprian Florea + \nThe sixth-generation Ford Mustang arrived in late 2013 and brought many new features to Ford’ s iconic nameplate. Arguably the most important addition was the independent rear suspension, a system that the Chevrolet had adopted for the Camaro way back in 2009. The pony car also gained a turbocharged four-cylinder engine, making it the first Mustang to use one since the third-generation model. Finally, Ford made the Mustang a global car, which means that customers in markets such as Europe and Asia can buy the pony from dealerships rather than the gray market. The move was met with much enthusiasm in Europe, where countries such as Germany and the United Kingdom are home to many Mustang collectors. \nWhile U.S.- and Euro-spec cars are mostly the same, Ford developed a special suspension system and engine internals for the European market, in order to better suit the roads and emission requirements of the \"Old Continent.\" Now that the Mustang has found its way into European dealerships, Ford also created a couple of special-edition models for customers on the other side of the pond. The Blue Edition is one of them, and it pays tribute to the high-impact colors that Ford offered in the late 1960s and early 1970s. \n“The Ford Mustang has no trouble standing out on European roads, and with the new Ford Mustang Black Shadow Edition and Blue Edition models, Mustang drivers will be turning even more heads,” said Roelant de Waard, vice president of Ford of Europe. “Special edition Ford Mustangs have been an important part of the Mustang story for more than 50 years, and now customers in Europe can play their own part in the iconic car’s rich special edition history.” \nContinue reading to learn more about the Ford Mustang Blue Edition. continue reading What makes the Ford Mustang Blue Edition special \nAll Blue Edition Mustangs are finished in Grabber Blue, one of the two blue hues available for the sixth-generation coupe. While it’s safe to say that the paint, which is a no-cost option for any Mustang, doesn’t make it special, the double, \"go fast\" black stripes running from the nose all the way back to the decklid makes the Blue Edition stand out from the crowd. The stripes have a \"dissolve-effect\" toward the grille and are complemented by black-painted, 19-inch multi-spoke alloy wheels. \nFord argues that the special-edition model \"channels the spirit of classic Ford Mustang models that featured eye-catching ’Grabber’ colors\" and goes on to highlight some of the flashy paints it offered in the past, starting with the 1969 Shelby GT350 and GT500 models that were used to launch the Grabber high-impact hues. Granted, it’s more about PR talk than anything else, but the Mustang is a nameplate that relies on a ton of heritage and I can’t blame Ford for looking on past iconic models for inspiration. \nInside, the Blue Edition gets a few extras over the regular model. Added options include heated and cooled seats, Ford’s SYNC 3 communications and entertainment system with navigation, and a premium audio system. The SYNC system comes with an eight-inch touchscreen and an array of cool apps, including one that enables drivers to locate nearby cafes, petrol stations or car parks, as well as find train stations, airports, and hotels. All this is done simply by pushing a button and saying “I need a coffee,” “I need petrol,” and “I need to park.” Cool! Gallery Ford Mustang \nThe special-edition is pretty standard under the hood, where both engine 2.3-liter EcoBoost and 5.0-liter V-8 options are available. The V-6, America’s entry-level powerplant, isn’t available in Europe. All told, customers that go with the turbocharged four-cylinder will benefit from 317 PS (313 horsepower), while those who prefer the 5.0-liter V-8 will have 421 PS (415 horses) at their disposal. Yes, the output differs from that of North American cars, which come with 310 and 435 horsepower, respectively. Both the six-speed manual and automatic transmissions are available for either engine. \nPricing information is not yet available, but the Blue Edition shouldn’t cost significantly more than the standard model. For reference, German prices start from €38,000 and €43,000 for the EcoBoost and GT, respectively. In the U.K., the EcoBoost starts from £31,745, while the GT retails from £35,745.

      "title": "GM, Nissan lead gains; FCA tumbles as industry sets Nov. record",
      "text": "Ford, Honda, Nissan, Toyota and General Motors posted U.S. sales increases in November as a rise in incentive spending helped put the industry back on a winning track after three straight monthly declines.\nIndustrywide sales hit a record for the month -- easily topping the 1.328 million mark in Nov. 2001.\nA 10 percent gain at GM and a 4.3 percent rise at Toyota Motor Corp. marked their strongest advances this year. Nissan Motor Co. climbed 7.5 percent, while Ford Motor Co. ended a four-month skid. The Volkswagen brand soared 24 percent. Fiat Chrysler was the exception among the first companies to report, tumbling 14 percent as fleet deliveries shrank.\nContinued demand for light trucks amid low gasoline prices helped boost automakers’ results, as did two additional selling days compared with November of 2015. Incentive spending last month, including Thanksgiving holiday deals, was up 13 percent vs. a year-earlier but down from October, according to TrueCar data. (See table below.)\nU.S. light-vehicle sales in November are forecast to rise about 3.8 percent from a year earlier, based on a survey of analysts by Bloomberg.\nWhat’s more, November is shaping up to leave the industry in a better position to top last year’s 17.47 million tally. Sales through October were 0.3 percent behind their year-earlier pace after three straight monthly declines.\nIf the industry manages to eke out an annual gain, 2016 would mark the first time in a century that U.S. sales topped year-earlier levels for seven straight years. Sales rose every year in a nine-year stretch through 1917.\nCompany by company \nGM's 10 percent increase reflected rises of 8.1 percent at Chevrolet, 14 percent at GMC, 16 percent at Buick and 14 percent at Cadillac.\nGM said sales to retail customers were up 7.9 percent to 197,609 in November while rental shipments jumped 27 percent.\nToyota's corporate increase reflected a 5.3 gain at the Toyota division. Deliveries slipped 1 percent at Lexus.\nToyota outsold Ford Motor Co. for the first time this year after coming close twice this summer. Toyota's margin was 1,204 units to rank No. 2 in the industry, behind GM.\nFord posted a 5.1 percent rise in November volume. Sales rose 4.5 percent at the Ford division and 19 percent at Lincoln. Ford's retail sales were up 10 percent while fleet shipments dropped 9 percent. \nVolume dropped at FCA on sharply lower fleet shipments, a 12 percent decline at Jeep and a 47 percent decrease at the Chrysler brand. It was the third straight monthly decline at Jeep.\nDeliveries rose 12 percent at Ram but slipped 21 percent at Dodge and 15 percent at Fiat. FCA said overall retail demand dropped 2 percent and fleet volume was off 42 percent last month.\nSales advanced 7.5 percent at Nissan Motor last month, with deliveries rising 8 percent at the Nissan division and 3.6 percent at Infiniti.\nHonda Motor Co. ended a three-month losing streak with a 6.5 percent increase.  Honda division volume climbed 7.9 percent, offsetting a 5.1 percent decline at Acura.\nThe VW brand’s 24 percent increase ended a streak of 12 consecutive monthly declines in the wake of the automaker's diesel-emissions scandal. VW’s Audi, meanwhile, extended its winning run to 85 months with a 2.5 percent gain.\nThe VW brand's 24 percent increase ended a streak of 12 consecutive monthly declines in the wake of the automaker's diesel-emissions violations. Photo credit: DAVID PHILLIPS Subaru of America continued its hot streak with November marking the 60th consecutive month of U.S. sales increases. Subaru also set a monthly sales record with 51,308 vehicles sold in November, an increase of 11 percent from a year earlier.\n“With December typically being one of the best retail sales months of the year, the Subaru franchise is in a great position to achieve its eighth consecutive all-time sales record in 2016,” said Tom Doll, president of Subaru of America.\nStrong SAAR \nThe seasonally adjusted, annualized sales rate is projected to remain strong but drop to 17.7 million vehicles, according to a survey of analysts by Bloomberg. That would be down slightly from this year’s highest rate -- October’s 17.98 million -- and the 18.07 million pace in November 2015, the second-strongest month of last year.\nGM today estimated the November SAAR at 17.9 million units.\nBob Carter, Toyota senior vice president of automotive operations , said Toyota projects a SAAR on the month of around 17.7 or 17.8 million, putting the industry at a \"solid 17.4 million and change.\" He said he anticipates Toyota forecasting a SAAR in the low 17 million range in 2017.\n\"That's a great, great market. Any time we're talking mid-17s, that's a wonderful market and a wonderful indication of where the North American economy is,\" he said.\nThe early launch of Black Friday sales events helped offset declines in fleet sales in November, said Eric Lyman, TrueCar’s chief industry analyst.\n“The retail sales environment remains strong for new car sales,” Lyman said. “Incentives are also down slightly [from October] as automakers begin to address supply side imbalances with planned reductions in vehicle production.”\nSteady economic and job growth and the recent rise in U.S. equity prices have also encouraged consumers to make big-ticket purchases, analysts say.\nIncentive spending by automakers averaged an estimated $3,475 per vehicle in November, TrueCar estimates.\n‘Plateau’ \nMike Jackson, CEO of AutoNation Inc., the largest U.S. new-vehicle dealership group, said there is some relief among dealers and automakers now that the presidential election, and the uncertainty that the campaign cast over consumers, is over.\n“I still think we're in a plateau,” Jackson said this week. “There is a point of diminishing returns when whatever you give at the front end in incentives comes off residual values at the back end. We're right at that tipping point.”\nJessica Caldwell, an analyst for Edmunds.com, said luxury vehicles and light-truck demand in December will determine whether the industry hits a new milestone.\n“November sales have the industry well-positioned to set a new annual sales record this year, but a new record is far from guaranteed,” said Caldwell.\n“Expect to see a flood of ads for holiday season sales events in the coming days and weeks, especially for luxury brands, trucks and SUVs. If we see any year-over-year lifts in these segments in December, then it's a good bet that the industry will top last year's record-high sales.\"\nNick Bunkley and John Irwin contributed to this report.",

      "text": "Ford tore past analysts' estimates for U.S. sales on demand for pickups and sport utility vehicles, including the highest November deliveries F-series trucks since 2001. Toyota and Nissan also beat forecasts. Ford's light-vehicle sales in the month rose 5.1 per cent to 196,441, far better than the 0.5 per cent gain projected by analysts in a Bloomberg survey. Toyota's sales rose 4.3 per cent, compared to a 3.4 estimates, while Nissan gained 7.5 per cent, ahead of the predicted 4.6 per cent.\nAuto sales are running at near-record levels as the U.S. economy continued to expand with little inflation, according to a Federal Reserve survey. And relatively low gasoline prices, combined with aggressive promotions, are spurring sales of pickups and SUVs, which tend to be larger and less efficient than cars. So-called light trucks, which include minivans, may have outsold cars by 2-to-1 in November, according to Tim Fleming of Kelley Blue Book.\nAutomakers and dealers drew from a grab bag of holiday-season tricks to sustain sales. General Motors dangled 20 per cent discounts nationwide on its Chevrolet, GMC and Buick brands in November, and makers of luxury autos revived annual promotions such as \"the Season of Audi\" and Lexus's \"December to Remember.\" And even though Ford tightened some discounts, individual retailers, such as Charles Gabus Ford in Des Moines, Iowa, spurred Black Friday traffic by offering a 65-inch 4K TV to anyone who bought a new Ford that day.\nFord results were driven by a 19 per cent gain in SUV deliveries and an 11 per cent increase in sales of F-series pickups to 72,089. Ford's car sales plunged 9.7 per cent, led by an 18 per cent drop for the Focus compact. The automaker is moving production of that small car to Mexico from Michigan.\n\"Strong retail sales increases for both F-150 and our all-new Super Duty pickups drove F-series above the 70,000 vehicle mark — a November threshold we have not seen in 15 years,\" Mark LaNeve, Ford's vice president of U.S. marketing, sales and service, said in an emailed statement.\nTotal light-vehicle sales probably rose about 3.8 per cent in November, according to the average estimate of analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. After accounting for two extra selling days this November, the annualized rate is projected to drop to 17.7 million vehicles — still above this year's average — from 18.2 million a year earlier, the strongest month of 2015. The projections reinforce the idea that industrywide sales, while at a high level, have plateaued and become more reliant on incentives.\nFiat Chrysler Automobiles's U.S. unit is projected to report the biggest decline for the month, about 9 per cent, after paring truck incentives compared with October. Estimates vary widely in part because the company has revised its sales history twice in recent months and analysts are using different year-ago figures for November 2015.\nGM's full-size pickup incentives through Nov. 20 jumped 46 per cent from a year earlier to $5,753, according to data from researcher J.D. Power viewed by Bloomberg, compared with Ford's $4,467, a 5 per cent increase, and Fiat Chrysler's Ram at $6,062, up 19 per cent.\nIncentives that were introduced last month may ultimately help determine whether 2016 ends up as a record seventh straight year with an industrywide sales gain. Many of the automakers' deals pegged to Black Friday actually ran all through November and some stick around the rest of the year.\n\"If this month's forecast holds, December's year-over-year sales only need to be flat to set a new annual record in 2016,\" Jessica Caldwell, an analyst with Edmunds.com, wrote in an emailed statement.",

      "text": "GM, Ford Shares Jump As Trucks, SUVs Lead November Sales   \n“The 3D printing technology, like every other industry technology, has to be a part of a productive process. On its own, it’s much more similar to a toy,” Trimaker Co-Founder Alexis Caporale — recently selected as one of the 50 most innovative young leaders in the world — told Benzinga during a recent interview. 3D Printing In Latin America \nAlthough slowly gaining traction, the 3D printing industry is still nascent in Latin America. However, there is one company betting on disruption. \nMultiple-award-winning Trimaker is the leader in terms of sales in 3D printing in the region, serving clients like Staples, Inc. (NASDAQ: SPLS ), Toyota Motor Corp (ADR) (NYSE: TM ), Kraft Heinz Co (NASDAQ: KHC ) and Telefonica S.A. (ADR) (NYSE: TEF ). The company not only manufactures its own 3D printers, but also offers materials and related services. Emerging In An Emerging Market \n“We started with hardware, making 3D printer prototypes based on resin technology, back in 2010,” Caporale revealed. “By 2012, we had the first working prototype, and began manufacturing machines. Hardware lead us to software, then we went into materials, and today we’re the leading 3D printers company in Latin America.” \n“What we do now is manufacture machines, with a much more integrated chain, from Asia to Argentina. In addition, we work -a lot- with the implementation of this technology in productive processes,” he continued. “We want our printers to supplement other machines, harnessing the full potential of this technology.” A Working Company \n“Right now, we are the only Latin American company in the retail segment, and the only ones with a real distribution chain assembled, selling in stores like Staples and others,” Caporale explained. “ Stratasys, Ltd. (NASDAQ: SSYS )’s MakerBot had a few experiences in retail, but did not do very well: Cencosud SA (NYSE: CNCO )’s Jumbo supermarkets bought three printers [for its Argentina branch] and did not manage to sell any. The thing is, their machine costs about 90,000 Argentine pesos [about $6,000], and our machine goes for 32,000 pesos [about $2100].” \nOn the other hand, he expounded, 3D Systems Corporation (NYSE: DDD ) and Stratasys go through resellers, not relying much on retailers, “because they are more industrial machines.” So, there are no strong competitors in the retail segment in Latin America, he assured. \nWhen asked about sales, the entrepreneur said that, this year, Trimaker would fall short of its $2 million target. “However, leaving R&D peaks aside, it’s a company that always breaks even. Our last funding round, in 2015, was a $400,000 round; but the company doesn’t demand much capital, because we generally base our activities on knowledge that the own founders had been accumulating over time.” \nCheck back soon for the expert’s views on the future of 3D printing and its relation with fuel efficiency. \nLiked this interview?

      "text": "Market   5:40pm EST UPDATE 2-GM, Ford Canadian auto sales soar in November rebound \n(Adds sales figures for Toyota, analyst's figures for FCA and analysis) \nBy Allison Lampert \nMONTREAL Dec 1 General Motors Co and Ford Motor Co on Thursday reported double-digit rises in Canadian sales for November compared with the same period a year earlier, fueled by strong demand for SUVs and light trucks and two extra selling days. \nA spokeswoman for Fiat Chrysler Automobiles wrote Thursday evening in an email that the company could not yet make its November figures available for Canada. But analyst Dennis DesRosiers said in a note to clients that the automaker sold 20,674 vehicles during the month, down 1.7 percent compared with the same period a year earlier. \nAnalysts said the November rebound in industry volumes, following a trend of weakening demand over the last three months, keeps Canada on track to set another record this year, with sales rising to around 1.96 million vehicles from a record-breaking 1.90 million units in 2015. \n\"For those claiming that 2016 had run out of steam, November 2016 light vehicle sales showed a different picture altogether as sales increased 10.4 percent year-over-year,\" DesRosiers wrote Thursday afternoon. \nScotiabank economist Carlos Gomes wrote in a note the rebound was driven by a surge in light truck volumes, especially large SUVs and mid-size pickup trucks. \nDespite November's rebound, Gomes wrote that he expects \"Canadian passenger vehicle sales to begin to edge lower in 2017, as manufacturers raise prices due to the recent weakness of the Canadian dollar.\" \nGM dealers delivered 28,523 vehicles in November, up 31 percent compared with November 2015, the company said in a statement. GM Canada sales are up 2 percent year-to-date. \nFord said it sold 24,472 vehicles in November, up 18 percent compared with the same month a year earlier. Ford reported a 10 percent rise in Canadian auto sales for the first 11 months of 2016, on an annual basis. \nAutomaker Toyota reported 16,492 units sold in Canada last month, up 4.2 percent compared with November 2015. \nIn the United States, hefty consumer discounts during a robust Black Friday weekend helped boost November U.S. auto sales between 4 and 5 percent, which could catapult results this year above a record high in 2015, economists and industry analysts said on Thursday.

      "title": "2015 Ford Edge Test Drive and Review",
      "text": "2015 Ford Edge Test Drive and Review Younger and Edgier By Aaron Gold About.com Rating \nFord introduced the Edge for 2007 as a crossover SUV for empty-nesters -- folks who liked their Expeditions and Explorers but didn't need something so big and bulky now that the kids were on their own. But the Edge found a very different audience. A younger audience. And young buyers are a good thing. So for 2015, Ford has transformed the Edge into something for the kids. Let's drive it and see how they've done. \nThe Ford Edge starts at $28,995 and is covered by a 3-year/36,000-mile basic warranty, a 5-year/60,000-mile powertrain warranty, and EPA fuel economy estimates of 20 mpg city/28 mpg highway/23 mpg combined. \nFirst Glance \nNew vehicles are always designed with a specific demographic in mind, and they often miss the mark. In most cases, a vehicle winds up appealing to older buyers, but the opposite happened to the Edge: It appealed to a younger audience than Ford had intended. (Also a more feminine one. Though only about a third of Ford buyers are women, the Edge has a 50/50 male/female split.) In the automotive business, this is an exceptionally good problem to have; to put it bluntly, younger buyers have more car-buying years ahead of them. The Edge has sold strongly and steadily, while competitors like the Toyota Venza and Honda Crosstour -- vehicles that did hit their demographic mark -- have withered on the vine. \nAnd so Ford has embraced their misfortune by redesigning the Edge for a younger buyer. The new Edge puts an emphasis on styling and technology, something that is apparent from the first glance. Ford has two distinct design themes; one for their trucks and one for their cars. Unlike the previous version, the new Edge is decidedly car-like. Note the Taurus-like fascia with its trapezoidal grille, although you’ll also spot the bold chrome crossbars that give it a family resemblance to Ford's F-series pickup trucks . From the rear, the Edge is long and tapered, not unlike Ford's European-designed Focus hatchback. Overall it’s a handsome and aggressive car that wears its new look well. \nIn the Driver's Seat \nI hate to use the phrase “European inspired,” but the bulk of Ford's smaller vehicles (including the Escape SUV) were designed by the company's European division, and the interior of the Edge clearly follows their lead, so if the cliché fits, let's wear it. Forget about soft and subtle curves; the Edge is just edgy (see, once you enter cliché-land, you never come back). \nI like the design, but like a lot of my fellow journalists I’ve had a hard time getting used to the MyFord Touch system, a complicated menu-driven interface that uses a four-zone touch-screen, two sets of buttons on the steering wheel, and displays on the dash to control the stereo, climate, navigation and other miscellaneous systems. Even if you know how to use MyFord Touch, it still takes a lot of attention from the road. \nFortunately, the new Edge has a set of redundant buttons for common stereo and climate functions, including the (optional) heated and cooled front seats. Better yet, the Edge gets real buttons in place of the capacitive-touch panels Ford has used in the past. Ford says the SYNC system (which allows voice control of many of these same systems as well as navigation) has been improved; the pre-production test cars I drove didn’t have the new software, but knowing how well the old system worked, I’m sure the new one will be just fine. \nBut there's more to an SUV's interior than the control layout, and on all other fronts the Edge gets two thumbs up. The front seats are wide and comfortable; the back seat is supportive and offers a lavish amount of legroom. Ford's inflatable seatbelts (which have a small integrated airbag and help prevent chest injuries) are optional for the rear seat. \nSince Ford didn't try to stuff a third-row seat into the back, the Edge is a proper cargo carrier, offering 39.2 cubic feet of cargo space with the rear seats in place (7 more than last year’s Edge) and 73.4 cubic feet when they are folded. Speaking of which, the seatbacks are spring-loaded and fold down with release buttons in the cargo bay, which is handy, but setting them back into place requires a bit of muscle. As with other Ford SUVs, there's an optional kick-to-open tailgate; if your arms are full (and the key is on your person), waving your foot under the bumper will open up the trunk. \nOn the Road \nFord has taken a curious strategy with the new Edge’s engine lineup. The two-liter turbocharged EcoBoost engine, which was an extra-cost option in last year's Edge, is now standard (and improved to 245 horsepower), and a naturally aspirated (non-turbocharged) 280hp 3.5 liter V6, once standard, is now an extra-cost option. The two-liter EcoBoost engine can now be had with front- or all-wheel-drive and can tow up to 3,500 lbs. \nI first drove a Titanium model (base price $36,495, optioned up to $43,190) with the 2-liter EcoBoost, and was very impressed: Aside from a bit of hesitation off the line, it does a decent imitation of a V6. Next I tried out the Edge Sport ($38,995/$44,190), which gets a 315-hp 2.7-liter twin-turbo EcoBoost V6. What an impressive engine: As with the 2.0, there's a bit of low-RPM hesitation, but give it a second or so to get on the boil and it pulls the Edge like a small V8. \nEPA fuel economy estimates for the 2.7-liter EcoBoost engine are 17 MPG city/24 MPG highway for both front- and all-wheel-drive versions, compared to 20/28 for the 2.0 liter AWD Edge (20/30 with front-wheel-drive). Funnily enough, my observed fuel economy for both engines was similar (low 20s). One of the pitfalls of Ford's EcoBoost engines is that real-world MPG often differs widely from EPA estimates, so we'll have to wait until we can get a full week with both the 2.0 and 2.7 liter Edges to see whether they deliver the gas mileage they promise. \nRide and handling have been greatly improved. The original Edge reminded me of the full-size SUVs its potential buyers would be coming out of: Big, soft, and a wee bit clumsy. The new version is the opposite: Though it still feels rather massive, it rides comfortably (although the Sport is decidedly firmer) and takes turns like a car rather than a traditional SUV. Our press preview took place north of Phoenix, Arizona, where serious curvy roads are hard to come by, so we couldn't really press the Edge without running afoul of Johnny Law, but I'd love to take an Edge Sport out on our favorite California canyon roads. It seems like it has a lot of potential. \nJourney's End \nConsidering how indifferent I was to the old Edge, I’m genuinely surprised at how much I enjoyed the new one. It’s a real stand-out: Handsome, stuffed with technology, and good to drive. That said, it’s also pretty darn expensive: The entry-level SE model starts at $28,995, and as our test cars showed, it's easy to option an Edge up to well above $40,000. \nTo what vehicles should we compare the Edge? Boy, that’s tough. I have to mention our favorites in this class, which have also been resigned this year: The Nissan Murano , a great all-rounder, and the Kia Sorento , a little-known contender that is surprisingly luxurious. And let’s not forget its arch-rival, the Toyota Venza , a wagon-like SUV that I’ve always liked. All three are in the same general price range as the Edge. \nThat said, I can’t help but compare the Edge to a couple of less-mainstream SUVs: I think the top-of-the-range Edge Titanium is worthy of comparison to the pricier Volkswagen Touareg , and the Edge Sport seems like it could give the Infiniti QX70 (the SUV formerly known as the FX35 ) a run for its money. \nThe way I see it, there’s only one way things could go seriously wrong for the Edge: What if those younger buyers, the ones who were perfectly happy driving an Edge designed for their parents, decide they don’t like the one designed for them? Now that would be funny (to everyone but Ford, that is). I don’t think that will happen; after all, I am the younger buyer that Ford is seeking -- and I liked the Edge just fine. -- Aaron Gold \n\nDisclaimer: This test drive was conducted at a manufacturer-sponsored press event.

He said these new patrol cars will allow the department to better serve the community, especially in the winter. \nThe Bangor Police Department will be riding high later this year after Police Chief Scott Alo announced the department would retire both its squad cars in favor of a larger, more capable model. \nThe department’s Dodge Chargers will be replaced with all-wheel drive police interceptor SUVs from Ford. \nThe decision was made as a result of continued mechanical trouble that has plagued the department’s 2012 Charger. Frequent brake trouble, rear wheel drive and limited ground clearance were all contributing factors in this decision. \nAlo said the department has had to replace the 2012’s brakes five times since taking possession of the vehicle four years ago. And the Bangor police department isn’t the only department that has had trouble with this model, either. \nAccording to West Salem Police Lieutenant Jeremy Randall, the department has also had serious mechanical trouble with its 2012 Charger, as well. \n“We’ve replaced the brakes numerous times,” he said. “We replaced the radiator in the last week and once before earlier this year.” \nRandall said the department is planning to trade the 2012 Charger before its older 2011 Crown Victoria due to the costly repairs. \nThe West Salem Police Department, like Bangor, plans to replace the Charger with a Ford Explorer-based police interceptor utility, too. \nBut Bangor and West Salem aren’t the only departments in La Crosse County to face trouble with the 2012 Charger. \nBangor Village Board member Jason Steinke, who serves on the Holmen Police Department, said his Charger was plagued with problems, as well. \nHis patrol car has since been replaced with a Ford SUV and he hasn’t had any problems with it. \nOutwardly, the new vehicles could easily be mistaken for a $50,000-plus Ford Explorer off the showroom floor, but according to Alo, these vehicles bare little more than a resemblance to the their family focused doppelgangers. \nThe new squads, however, still aren’t cheap. Alo said that once outfitted, each squad costs approximately $38,000. The department lessened the impact of the new vehicles by trading the old squads. \nAlo said he was able to negotiate $10,000 for the 2011, and $9,000 for the troubled 2012. The remaining cost of replacing the vehicles will come out of funds set aside for this purpose and will not impact the village’s 2017 budget. \nAlo said these vehicles do share some similarities. The vehicles do share the same chassis, power plant and drive train of the civilian model, but lack the creature comforts that make the Explorer a pricier vehicle. \nOn the inside, these vehicles are really stripped down versions of the most basic trim, and that’s only in the front seats. The second row has been replaced with a cage in which suspects can be safely transported. Finally, the third row seating has been replaced with additional storage for gear. \nAlo said the new squads center-mounted seatbelts significantly improved the safety of officers when securing suspects. In the old vehicles officers were required to lean across suspects to secure seatbelts and were subjected to biting, spitting and other physical attacks. \nApart from the obvious improvement in reliability over the Dodges, all-wheel-drive and improved ground clearance were important factors Alo considered before making up his mind.

LaCrosseTribune.com Breaking News   \nIn a brief presentation to the Bangor Village Board last month, Alo distributed written testimony from his officers who had experienced first-hand the trouble with the vehicles. \nOfficer Nathan Ganrude wrote in his testimony the Dodges performed perfectly in ideal driving conditions, but as soon as roads got slick with water or ice, they became dangerous. Any amount of snow or ice could seriously impair officers responding to a call. \nHe wrote the rear-wheel-drive vehicle often became uncontrollable on slick surfaces and would fishtail dangerously. \n“There have been occasions when this has slowed my response or caused me to choose an alternative route for fear of getting stuck in locations where a four-wheel-drive vehicle would have little to no problem traversing,” Ganrude’s letter read. \nAlo said officers experience significant psychological trauma when they can’t get to someone in need fast enough. \n“Our job is to respond,” Alo said. \nIn Sergeant Robert Nordby’s written testimony to the board, he wrote the Charger’s limited ground clearance often became a problem following winter storms. He wrote that even if the storm dropped less than the Charger’s five inches of ground clearance, drifts could become a hang up. \nSteinke said the rear-wheel-drive Chargers were fantastic on dry pavement and in ideal driving conditions, but as soon as the roads slicked up, the vehicles became practically undriveable. \nAlo said part of why this is a problem for the small police department is because Bangor is often tasked with responding to calls in this part of La Crosse County, especially during bad weather, when other department and state patrol are called to more populated areas.

      "text": "Western Michigan University running back Leo Ekwoge cracks up laughing during a walkthrough at Ford Field on Thursday. (Photo: Robin Buckson / Detroit News) \nDetroit — There was one year the late, great Tigers manager, Sparky Anderson, called the toughest of his career.\nWould you believe, it was 1984?\nThat, of course, was the year the Tigers started a historic 35-5, and went wire-to-wire to win the franchise’s fourth and last World Series championship.\nAnderson’s rationale was this: He felt so much pressure after the great start, the rest of the season was almost suffocating, as he didn’t want to be known as the guy who blew it.\nWell, Western Michigan coach P.J. Fleck might know the feeling.\n“You know what I really enjoy, these guys,” Fleck said Thursday afternoon, nodding to the two seniors to his left, wide receiver Corey Davis and quarterback Zach Terrell. “When you talk about the process, that’s a very difficult thing to take a lot of joy in.\n“As a head coach, you get a lot of money to be paranoid and worried.”\nFriday night’s Mid-American Conference championship game against Ohio (8-4) at Ford Field is the next — and, easily, the most important — challenge for the Broncos, who are 12-0 and need one more win to likely secure a bid in the Cotton Bowl.\nNavy (9-2) remains in the mix, because of its strength of schedule and quality wins.\nSo, the pressure on Western Michigan is incredible — but it’s been there pretty much all year. From the inside of the Waldo Stadium walls, where players were told by coaches in January that a special season was very achievable. And from the outside, where the media started asking about players and coaches about the possibility of perfection — way back in September, after the season-opening, overtime victory over Northwestern of the Big Ten.\n“We have yet to exhale,” said Terrell, who orchestrates a run-first offense — but one that can easily shift to the passing game. He has 30 touchdown throws, to just one interception.\n“We have a lot left to accomplish. There’s meat left on the bone, so to speak.”\nThat meat, of course, starts with a MAC championship, which would be just the third in program history — for a program that’s been around more than a century.\nWithout a win Friday night, all the College Football Playoff committee’s talk about where to put Western Michigan doesn’t mean a lick.\nA Cotton Bowl bid will be gone.\n“We need to be 1-0 tomorrow,” Fleck said, “or it doesn’t matter.”\nThat’s what Fleck and the Broncos have talked about all year. They have a lot of phrases, from “Row the Boat,” to “The Ball is the Program.” Another is the one-game seasons. They strive to be 1-0 against Ohio, just like they were 1-0 against Toledo last week, and 1-0 against every other team on the schedule.\nSpeaking of that schedule, that’s what is giving the CFP pause before just assigning a 12-0 WMU team to the Cotton Bowl over a two-loss Navy team. The CFP, which assigns the four playoff teams and the other New Year’s Six participants, doesn’t like WMU’s strength of schedule, despite two wins over the Big Ten (Illinois was the other), plus wins over MAC bowl teams, such as Toledo, Eastern Michigan and Western Michigan, with most victories coming in blowout fashion.\nFleck has balked at doing any more lobbying for his team. He doesn’t see the point.\n“I will just say this,” he said at Thursday’s MAC press conference. “This is the No. 1 team in my ranking, period, and that’s the only thing that matters to me.\n“I’m not gonna say anything that’s gonna make them (CFP committee) think differently. Our schedule is our schedule. The conference is one of the most competitive, across the board, with parity. Any given Saturday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, MACtion Friday, whatever it is, you just don’t know who’s gonna win.\n“That’s the only thing we can control. There’s nothing else I can do.”\nWestern Michigan, which wins with a dynamic offense and a defense with a crazy knack for forcing turnovers — the Broncos are tied for No. 1 in the nation in turnover margin, at plus-18 a figure Ohio coach Frank Solich couldn’t exactly remember, “because it’s so high, I lost track” — is heavily favored in Friday’s game.\nOhio knows that, and hears that, and doesn’t seem particularly bothered that it’s viewed as simply the latest stand-in character in Western Michigan’s storybook season.\nThe Bobcats have a really good defense, which is why they tend to keep so many games close. To get into this game, it grinded out a 9-3 victory over Akron.\n“In general, we’re not an attention-seeking group,” Solich said. “We’re not concerned about where we’re at, in terms of an underdog and how most people are looking at it.”\nMost people are looking at it this way: It’s not if WMU will be 13-0, but when.\n“There are some sleepers out there that may not think we belong here on this stage,” said Tarell Basham, Ohio’s senior defensive lineman and the MAC defensive player of the year. “We’ve come here on a mission.”\nThis is Ohio’s third MAC championship game appearance at Ford Field; it lost the other two. This is Western Michigan’s first appearance in the MAC championship game since 1999-2000, and the program’s first trip to Ford Field; it also lost its other two, both on neutral sites against Marshall when Marshall was in the MAC.\nOhio’s last conference championship was in 1968, Western Michigan’s in 1988.\nBoth teams feel the pressure to end long title droughts, but for the Broncos — whose stakes are so high, more than 46,000 tickets had been sold for the game as of Thursday morning, which will shatter this game’s attendance record — the heat is a wee bit hotter.\nThen again, they’ve embraced the pressure all year. Why stop now?\n“We’ve come a long way as a program, with two (MAC) championships in 108 years to say, ‘Championship or bust,’ ” said Fleck, who guided this program from 1-11 to 8-5 to 8-5 to, now, 12-0. “I kind of like that, the expectations and pressure.\n“There is a ton on the line. This is what we wanted. This is the expectation and the pressure that we talked about from the opening press conference when we took over this job.\n“If you don’t want the championship pressure and the expectations, and the expectations to be ranked, don’t come to Western Michigan.”\ntpaul@detroitnews.com \ntwitter.com/tonypaul1984",

      "text": "Tesla Hosts Lobby Group Shunned by Ford Over Climate Stance by December 1, 2016 — 3:24 PM EST December 1, 2016 — 5:43 PM EST Company donating D.C. showroom for ALEC cocktail party Move comes as electric car maker intensifies direct sale push \nTesla Motors Inc. is hosting a party for a conservative lobbying group whose opposition to climate-change initiatives has driven Google, Ford Motor Co. and several oil companies to drop their membership. \nTesla, a clean-energy tech company that makes electric vehicles and is moving into solar panels on rooftops, is not a member of the American Legislative Exchange Council. It is nonetheless hosting a reception for a new ALEC venture at its Washington, D.C. showroom Thursday evening, blocks away from the site of the organization’s three-day policy summit. \nThe invitation promises \"an evening of cocktails, hors d’oeuvres and networking\" at the Tesla showroom, where guests will be able to meet the leaders of ALEC’s newly created \"Energy Innovation Project,\" dedicated to helping states forge policies fostering a culture of innovation and entrepreneurship surrounding U.S. energy resources. \nAlthough Tesla’s involvement is limited to providing its space as a destination for ALEC’s cocktail party, it’s an unusual act by the electric car manufacturer, whose Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk is an outspoken advocate of carbon taxes, because ALEC actively lobbies against them. The group also has pushed to repeal state renewable energy mandates and criticized caps on greenhouse gas emissions. Direct Sales \nTesla representatives declined to comment. But the company’s K Street store is regularly used for cocktail receptions and events that further its word-of-mouth strategy for building business and luring potential customers into cars for test drives. \nTesla has been intensifying its campaign to convince states to allow the California-based company to sell electric cars directly to customers, without going through franchised dealers. Despite a recent win in Virginia, the company is battling limits on direct selling in other states, including Michigan, where it has gone to court to challenge the restrictions. \nTesla’s decision to open its D.C. showroom for the ALEC partygoers raised eyebrows among oil, gas and electric companies that are members of the group and are already skeptical of its new Energy Innovation Project, funded in part by the environmentally minded ClearPath Foundation. ClearPath and its founder, entrepreneur Jay Faison, are dedicated to persuading conservatives to fight climate change and support clean energy. And in a previous role at another organization, the head of ALEC’s Energy Innovation Project, Sarah Hunt, opined in favor of carbon taxes as \"a more elegant, cost-efficient way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\" Read more: California Auto Rule Will Keep Electric Cars Humming Under Trump The most important business stories of the day.

      "text": "Dentist Fighting Cancer Creates The ‘Molar Express Hope Ford and Bailey Pennington, WFMY 9:58 PM. EST December 01, 2016 The 'Molar Express' CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST \nDENTIST CREATES MOLAR EXPRESS - MEBANE, NC -What do you get when you mix a Christmas parade and a dentist? Why, the ‘Molar Express’, of course. \nDr. Eric Steinbicker, a Mebane based dentist, created the float, based off of the popular children’s book and movie, The Polar Express. \n\"It started off as a hobby and became something bigger,” said Steinbicker. \nFor three years, Steinbicker entered his dentist-themed floats into the Mebane Christmas Parade on behalf of his practice, Steinbicker Family Dentistry. First, it was the ‘Tooth Fairy’ float, then ‘Griswold’s Christmas’ and now, the ‘Molar Express.’ \n“It’s magical and spiritual,” the dentist explained. “It took about 300 hours; about four months or so.” \nSteinbicker bought an old bus off of Craigslist for $1,000. The total toothy transformation cost $2,200. Steinbicker worked on every single part of the float, except for the final paint job. His brother-in-law will dress as the ‘conductor’ and other family, friends and co-workers will wear pajamas when the ‘Molar Express’ roles through Mebane. \nBut the project almost didn't happen at all. \n\"In June of this year, I was diagnosed with Hodgkin's Lymphoma,” said Steinbicker. \"I almost didn’t do it. But, I went ahead and just started tinkering around with it. As I keep pursuing it and kept building it, I kind of looked at it as a bigger picture and what joy it would bring to kids.\" \nHe said the ‘Molar Express’, got him through rounds of chemo every two weeks, for three days at a time. So, for him, this is more than a float. It's a reminder of what the Polar Express is all about; that “seeing is believing, but sometimes the most real things in the world, are the things we can't see.”\"My faith in God has grown and whether or not people see that in the parade is hard to convey I guess, but I think that's the true meaning of Christmas. Having faith in God and each other,” said Steinbicker. \nSince November, Steinbicker has only worked part-time at his practice. If Steinbicker’s recent round of chemotherapy sends him into remission, he hopes to have a stem cell transplant in January. If not, he will continue with alternative treatments. \nSee the ‘Molar Express’ in the Mebane Christmas Parade on Friday, December 2 nd at 7pm. The parade route begins at the intersection of Second and Clay Streets, running down Clay Street to Fifth Street before taking a right turn at the Lofts at White Furniture building. \nCopyright 2016 WFMY",

      "text": "Automaker Ford Motor ( F ) is increasingly bullish on Europe, even in the wake of the Brexit.\nFord Motor's third-quarter earnings results confirmed a turnaround in Europe, even as North America reported another quarter of lower pre-tax profits.\nIn Europe, Ford Motor posted $138 million in pre-tax profits, the sixth profitable quarter  in a row. Ford Motor remains Europe's best-selling commercial-vehicle brand, and European demand makes the automaker's stock a compelling  long-term growth investment .\n\nEurope accounted for about $6.3 billion of Ford Motor's sales, one-third the amount generated in North America but twice that of Asia-Pacific, during the quarter. Ford Motor has driven profits in Europe via a solid balance sheet, improved cost performance and a strong product mix.\nThe European continent is a major market for Ford Motor. The company had to endure several years of billion-dollar losses before Alan Mulally, the former chief executive set in motion a  solid restructuring plan .\nThis included closing three manufacturing plants since 2013 including one in Belgium  and arriving at a cost-saving agreement with labor unions in Germany.\nCost efficiency and manufacturing capacity utilization have been bulwarks of this transformation, which is beginning to come to fruition. Through the first three quarters this year, Europe has delivered  more than $1 billion  in pretax profits for Ford Motor.\nOf course, the Brexit could throw a huge wrench into Ford Motor's recovery in Europe.\nAnd with a 2.2% operating margin , Europe could easily double that, and it would still be lower than the operating margin in North America.\nWith sales from North America floundering, Ford Motor clearly needs Europe to hold steady. North America has been a pain point for Ferrari  as well, with third-quarter shipments to the Americas growing just 0.4%  from a year earlier.\nPrev 0 of 2 Next",

(Photo: Robin Buckson / Detroit News) \nDetroit — It sure sounds like redshirt freshman Quinton Maxwell will be the starting quarterback for Ohio when it takes on Western Michigan in the Mid-American Conference championship game tonight.\n“Quinton is healthy, he’s been obviously starting the last few games for us,” Ohio coach Frank Solich said Thursday. “He’s gotten better and better and I think will continue to get better.”\nThe news is also good for senior quarterback Greg Windham, who has been dealing with a leg injury in recent weeks.\n“Last week I talked to him before the game ... he put a number on it, 80 percent,” Solich said. “And when a player tells you he’s 80 percent, that generally is not good enough. He’s feeling much better, he’s moving much better, so he’s able to play.”\nMaxwell is completing 55.6 percent of his passes for 1,247 yards and eight touchdowns, while Windham is at 56.4 percent for 1,366 yards and nine touchdowns. Maxwell has four interceptions and Windham’s one — key stats against a Western Michigan team that forces a lot of turnovers.\nWindham, though, has impressed his teammates with his quick rise to a leadership role.\n“He’s a young quarterback,” senior receiver Sebastian Smith said. “As the season’s progressed, he’s become more mature in how he’s approached guys on the field.\n“I can see it, in how he’s been playing. ... I’m confident in his play.”\nIn great hands \nWestern Michigan took home several conference awards Thursday, none more impressive than senior receiver Corey Davis being named offensive player of the year.\nOnly two other receivers have won that honor, Western Michigan’s Greg Jennings and Marshall’s Randy Moss, who, combined, played 24 seasons in the NFL.\n“It’s very humbling,” Davis said of being in that company.\nDavis is the Football Bowl Subdivision leader in career receiving yards, but coach P.J. Fleck said Davis is more than a receiver.\nHis blocking skills often get overlooked. Western has a ton of weapons on offense, receiving and rushing, and Davis is making an impact.\n“He’s so selfless,” Fleck said. “He’s a complete player.”\nA Broncos sendoff \nWestern Michigan got quite a sendoff from the Kalamazoo community.\nThe streets were lined with fans, and one emerged, seemingly out of nowhere, along the highway.\n“On I-94, exit 82,” Fleck said, smiling. “Literally, came out of the woods with a Western Michigan flag.”\nFleck noted how it’s been a tough year for Kalamazoo, specifically with the Uber shooting and bicycle tragedy.\nHe’s been impressed with how the community has rallied around his team, and he’s happy his team has been able to provide some joy.\n“If you can at least find some joy in your city’s football team, then we’re doing our job,” Fleck said. “We’re giving and serving, which is the No. 1 thing in our program.”\nA record MAC championship crowd of 50,000 is expected.\nBiggest booster \nMany coaches with good teams don’t like to tell their teams just how good they are.\nFleck is different.\n“Like I always say, this is like raising your daughters,” Fleck said. “If your daughter never hears she’s lovely from you, from age 2, 3, 4, 5 all the way up to 15, 16, the next thing you know, she’s out the door with the first guy that tells her, ‘You look lovely!’\n“We’re very real with them. You can’t ignore this.”\n\nWestern \nMichigan \nvs. Ohio \nKickoff: 7 tonight, Ford Field, Detroit\nTV/radio: ESPN2/WDFN\nRecords: 13 Western Michigan 12-0, Ohio 8-4\nLine: Western Michigan by 18",

      "text": "(Adds figures for Fiat Chrysler) By Allison Lampert MONTREAL, Dec 1 (Reuters) - General Motors Co and Ford Motor Co on Thursday reported double-digit rises in Canadian sales for November compared with the same period a year earlier, fueled by strong demand for SUVs and light trucks and two extra selling days. However, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles reported a decline in Canadian sales, down 3 percent to 20,674 vehicles last month, compared with November 2015. Analysts said November overall delivered a rebound in industry volumes, following a trend of weakening demand over the last three months. The month keeps Canada on track to set another record this year, with sales rising to around 1.96 million vehicles from a record-breaking 1.90 million units in 2015. In a note to clients, Canadian autos analyst Dennis DesRosiers said auto sales hit double-digit growth during November and were up 3 percent year-to-date. \"For those claiming that 2016 had run out of steam, November 2016 light vehicle sales showed a different picture altogether as sales increased 10.4 percent year-over-year,\" DesRosiers wrote on Thursday. Scotiabank economist Carlos Gomes wrote in a note that the rebound was driven by a surge in light truck volumes, especially large SUVs and mid-size pickup trucks. Despite November's rebound, Gomes said he expects \"Canadian passenger vehicle sales to begin to edge lower in 2017, as manufacturers raise prices due to the recent weakness of the Canadian dollar.\" GM dealers delivered 28,523 vehicles in November, up 31 percent compared with November 2015, the company said in a statement. GM Canada sales are up 2 percent year-to-date. Ford said it sold 24,472 vehicles in November, up 18 percent compared with the same month a year earlier. Ford reported a 10 percent rise in Canadian auto sales for the first 11 months of 2016, on an annual basis. Toyota reported 16,492 units sold in Canada last month, up 4.2 percent compared with November 2015. In the United States, hefty consumer discounts during a robust Black Friday weekend helped boost November U.S. auto sales between 4 and 5 percent, which could catapult results this year above a record high in 2015, economists and industry analysts said on Thursday.

      "text": "Reprints Loading the player... \nFollowing an October in which vehicle sales largely fell , big automakers like Ford ( F ), General Motors ( GM ) and Toyota ( TM ) turned out U.S. sales gains in November, although not all beat forecasts. Trucks and SUVs remained popular. \nAnalysts and executives have expressed concern about whether the auto market has reached its peak and whether the auto-loan market is beginning to show signs of weakness. But as the holidays also become a bigger car-shopping season, automakers capitalized. \n\"The early launch of Black Friday sales events is helping offset declines in fleet sales this month, as the retail sales environment remains strong for new car sales,\" Eric Lyman, TrueCar's chief industry analyst, said in a statement on Tuesday. \"Incentives are also down slightly as automakers begin to address supply side imbalances with planned reductions in vehicle production.\" Ford \nFord Motor's total U.S. sales rose 5% from a year ago to 197,574, topping the Edmunds forecast for 188,450 during the month. \nF-Series sales jumped 11%, led by demand for the F-150 and Super Duty pickups. SUV sales climbed 20%. \nShares closed up 3.9% at 12.43 on the stock market today , but found resistance near the 200-day average after topping that key level intraday for the first time in more than four months. General Motors \nGM sold 252,644 autos in November, a more than 10% increase, above Edmunds' forecast for 248,600. Buick sales jumped 22%, led by the Regal and Encore. Cadillac sales increased 17%, helped by rising Escalade sales. \n\"We are ahead of plan selling down our 2016 model year inventory and we expect to close out December with more retail share growth, Kurt McNeil, GM's vice president of U.S. sales operations, said in a statement. \n\"GM is heading into 2017 in a position of strength with the planned launch of key new products, like the all-new Chevrolet Equinox, into the heart of the market,\" he added. \nShares rose 5.5% to finish at 36.43 — the highest in a year. Fiat Chrysler Automobiles \nFiat Chrysler's sales fell 14% to 160,827, better than the Edmunds forecast for 159,551. \nRam Truck sales, however, rose 12%. Jeep sales dropped 12%. Fiat brand sales declined 15%, while Dodge sales were down 21%. Chrysler sales plunged 47%. \nShares added 1% to end at 7.74. Toyota \nToyota Motor sold 197,645 vehicles, up 4.3%, just shy of Edmunds' forecasts for 197,882. \nSales of the automaker's Highlander SUVs surged nearly 67%. Toyota Division pickups climbed nearly 14%. Lexus luxury utility vehicle sales rose 10.4%. \nBill Fay, group vice president and general manager of the Toyota Division, said in a statement that he expected the industry to set a new November sales record. \nHe later added that the automaker was entering December, often one of its best months for sales, with \"the best light truck availability of the whole year.\" \nShares dipped 0.6%. IBD'S TAKE: Even as many automakers top November sales forecasts, concerns have grown about rising delinquencies in subprime car loans. Honda, Nissan, Volkswagen \nHonda Motor ( HMC ) sold 122,924 autos in November, up 6.5% but below Edmunds' forecast for 125,151. Shares eased 0.4%. \nNissan Motor 's ( NSANY ) November sales rose 7.5% to 115,136 vehicles, topping Edmunds' outlook for 111,400. Shares lost 1.3%. \nVolkswagen 's ( VLKAY ) sales jumped 24.2% to 29,672 units, as Passat sales more than doubled to 6,441. Shares slipped 0.4%. \n\"It's probably no coincidence that this month's strong sales performance comes at the same time that the Dow Jones Average reached an all-time high,\" Jessica Caldwell, Edmunds.com's executive director of industry analysis, said in its November sales forecast last week. \n\"Now that the presidential election is over,\" she said, \"shoppers have more confidence in the economy than they had just a month ago, and that gives them extra motivation to make big-ticket purchases.\" \nRELATED:",

Photo: Reuters Tweet Published: 9:30 AM, December 2, 2016 \nNASCAR said on Thursday it reached an agreement that will see energy drink company Monster Energy become the title sponsor for the stock car racing series starting with the 2017 season. \nTerms of NASCAR's deal with the Coca-Cola <KO.N> owned energy drink company were not disclosed. \n\"Monster has built its brand on racing and motorsports, and NASCAR is the pinnacle of motorsports in America,\" said Mitch Covington, vice president of sports marketing at Monster Beverage Company in a statement. \n\"It's American racing; we're an American brand that's a global company, and NASCAR is, too. \n\"It was the perfect fit for us. ... NASCAR is just a hard-hitting, close-racing, fun property to be associated with.\" \nMonster Energy replaces U.S. wireless carrier Sprint <S.N>, who announced in 2014 that it was leaving the sport after the 2016 season during which it spent a reported $75 million annually on NASCAR sponsorship. \nSprint became NASCAR's Cup series sponsor starting with the 2008 season after it purchased Nextel, which took the naming rights in 2004. \nNASCAR, which is struggling with sagging ticket revenues and television ratings, will open its 2017 season in February with the Daytona 500. \n\"Monster Energy is the perfect series sponsor for NASCAR at the perfect time,\" said Texas Motor Speedway President Eddie Gossage. \"Monster's ability to market their association with NASCAR is important to the sport. \n\"All sports need more young people exposed to their 'game,' and this will serve NASCAR well.\" REUTERS",

I was wondering what you guys thought of having my Ford focus tdci roll coal, and what the downsides of it are (other than increased fuel economy when switched on of course) so yeah, I was basicly wondering what your thoughts are and how I would go about it/how much it would cost (live in Australia). Thanks.\n\nOther than that I'm considering getting a bigger turbo on it, so if you have any thoughts on that or any simmilar performance mods that would hurt reliability and fuel economy when cruising highway, they'd be appreciated.

      "text": "Thursday, Dec 1st, 2016 @ 10:01 am Ford will unveil a high-performance ST variant of its latest Fiesta small car later next year. Ford recently unveiled the standard version (pictured) of the new Fiesta at an event in Germany.In an interview with Dutch Web site AutoRAI , Tyrone Johnson, the head of Ford's ST and RS divisions, confirmed that a new Fiesta ST will be unveiled by the end of 2017. The new Fiesta ST will go into production by January 2018, trailing the regular versions of the small car by about a year.Johnson says the new Fiesta ST will be available with both three- and five-doors, although the latter will likely be the only version offered in the United States.Since the \"new\" Fiesta is essentially an update of the current car, we can expect the same drivetrains offered today. In the case of the U.S.-spec Fiesta ST that should mean a 1.6L turbocharged engine developing 197 horsepower. However, the next Fiesta ST could gain some of the selectable drive functions from the Focus RS.Pricing is far from final, but the new Fiesta ST should stay close to the current car's $21,265 base MSRP. \n ",

      "text": "By Allison Lampert\nMONTREAL (Reuters) - General Motors Co and Ford Motor Co on Thursday reported double-digit rises in Canadian sales for November compared with the same period a year earlier, fueled by strong demand for SUVs and light trucks and two extra selling days.\nHowever, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles reported a decline in Canadian sales, down 3 percent to 20,674 vehicles last month, compared with November 2015.\nAnalysts said November overall delivered a rebound in industry volumes, following a trend of weakening demand over the last three months. The month keeps Canada on track to set another record this year, with sales rising to around 1.96 million vehicles from a record-breaking 1.90 million units in 2015.\nIn a note to clients, Canadian autos analyst Dennis DesRosiers said auto sales hit double-digit growth during November and were up 3 percent year-to-date.\n\"For those claiming that 2016 had run out of steam, November 2016 light vehicle sales showed a different picture altogether as sales increased 10.4 percent year-over-year,\" DesRosiers wrote on Thursday.\nScotiabank economist Carlos Gomes wrote in a note that the rebound was driven by a surge in light truck volumes, especially large SUVs and mid-size pickup trucks.\nDespite November's rebound, Gomes said he expects \"Canadian passenger vehicle sales to begin to edge lower in 2017, as manufacturers raise prices due to the recent weakness of the Canadian dollar.\"\nGM dealers delivered 28,523 vehicles in November, up 31 percent compared with November 2015, the company said in a statement. GM Canada sales are up 2 percent year-to-date.\nFord said it sold 24,472 vehicles in November, up 18 percent compared with the same month a year earlier. Ford reported a 10 percent rise in Canadian auto sales for the first 11 months of 2016, on an annual basis.\nToyota <7203.T> reported 16,492 units sold in Canada last month, up 4.2 percent compared with November 2015.\nIn the United States, hefty consumer discounts during a robust Black Friday weekend helped boost November U.S. auto sales between 4 and 5 percent, which could catapult results this year above a record high in 2015, economists and industry analysts said on Thursday.\n(Reporting by Allison Lampert; Editing by James Dalgleish and Leslie Adler)",

Rebilas-USA TODAY Sports More (Reuters) - NASCAR said on Thursday it reached an agreement that will see energy drink company Monster Energy become the title sponsor for the stock car racing series starting with the 2017 season.\nTerms of NASCAR's deal with the Coca-Cola <KO.N> owned energy drink company were not disclosed.\n\"Monster has built its brand on racing and motorsports, and NASCAR is the pinnacle of motorsports in America,\" said Mitch Covington, vice president of sports marketing at Monster Beverage Company in a statement.\n\"It's American racing; we're an American brand that's a global company, and NASCAR is, too.\n\"It was the perfect fit for us. ... NASCAR is just a hard-hitting, close-racing, fun property to be associated with.\"\nMonster Energy replaces U.S. wireless carrier Sprint <S.N>, who announced in 2014 that it was leaving the sport after the 2016 season during which it spent a reported $75 million annually on NASCAR sponsorship.\nSprint became NASCAR's Cup series sponsor starting with the 2008 season after it purchased Nextel, which took the naming rights in 2004.\nNASCAR, which is struggling with sagging ticket revenues and television ratings, will open its 2017 season in February with the Daytona 500.\n\"Monster Energy is the perfect series sponsor for NASCAR at the perfect time,\" said Texas Motor Speedway President Eddie Gossage. \"Monster's ability to market their association with NASCAR is important to the sport.\n\"All sports need more young people exposed to their 'game,' and this will serve NASCAR well.\"\n(Reporting by Frank Pingue in Toronto; Editing by Steve Keating)",

Dealer Selection   \nFor whatever reason, any car ends up being several magnitudes cooler once it’s turned into a cop car . The result is the same even when you start with an already cool car, as evidenced by Germany’s new Polizei Ford Mustang. \nThe special Ford Mustang GT is the German police force’s new “Tune it! Safe!” demo car that will be used as an outreach tool to promote safe vehicle modification. The car was commissioned by the Verband der Automobil Tuner (VDAT), essentially Germany’s equivalent of the Specialty Equipment Market ( SEMA ), and is sponsored by Germany’s Federal Ministry of Transport and Digital Infrastructure, among other organizations. The car was built by Wolf Racing, which tuned the Mustang GT’s 5.0-liter Coyote V-8 engine to 440 hp and added custom 20-inch alloy wheels wrapped in Hankook Ventus S1 Evo² tires, a height-adjustable coilover suspension, a body kit with front splitter, side sills, rear diffuser, a rear wing, and unique bumpers, and a sports exhaust system. \nThe modified Mustang cop car will serve as a sort of liaison to the tuner crowd in Germany, which may otherwise not be all that receptive to a police presence at their events. Though this Polizei pony car won’t chase down bad guys on the Autobahn, S550 Mustang interceptors do exist. Mustang tuner Steeda has offered a police package for law enforcement agencies since early this year. \nSource: Tune it! Safe!",

      "text": "Jack Bauer could save U.S. Presidents and endure horrendous bouts of torture. But there’s one thing this TV hero was never able to accomplish: Getting Ford Motor Co. to return as a major sponsor of his popular Fox drama, “24.”\nWhen “24: Legacy,” a retooled version of the popular spy drama, debuts on Fox’s airwaves following the network’s broadcast of Super Bowl LI in January, it will mark a return of sorts for Ford, which pulled back from the series slightly after its third season and in a more pronounced way after its sixth. The series’ new protagonist, a character named Eric Carter (played by actor Corey Hawkins), will be spotted driving a Ford pick-up truck, while other Ford vehicles are expected to appear in the series throughout the season.\nIn an early screening of the series’ pilot, Ford was listed as a “24” sponsor, as was consumer-electronics manufacturer Samsung. During a presentation at an annual Television Critics Association this past summer. Fox Television Group co-chairman and co-CEO Dana Walden suggested Samsung would have a broader partnership with the drama. Ford and Fox declined to make executives available for comment.\nFord’s return to the series in such a major way (individual Ford ads have run in “24” in the interim, to be sure, and its vehicles have been used as props) is a testament to the power an advertiser can gain by having a strong association with a particular program, event or genre. PepsiCo and Anheuser-Busch InBev have sponsored the Super Bowl for so long their advertising is expected as part of the experience. General Electric has woven itself into NBC’s “Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon, ” as the underwriter of an occasional segment about young inventors. AT&T has been tied to TBS’ “Conan” since the late-night program launched in 2010.\nFord’s turn with “24” proved to be a harbinger of things to come in the evolving business of TV advertising . When Ford was a major sponsor of the series in 2003 and 2004, it opened two consecutive seasons with commercial-free premieres that were book-ended by longer-than-normal ads for Ford and played off the look and feel of the series. In one of the executions, a character named “Mr. Bauer” drove a Ford F-150 pick-up. Ford’s Expedition was also featured during one of the seasons.\nIn 2016, ads have grown even more intertwined with shows, as anyone who has seen Hyundai and Microsoft ads airing during AMC’s “The Walking Dead” that riff on that show’s zombie themes can tell you.\nFox had to work harder than usual to get the earlier Ford ads to work. Making the episodes commercial free meant having to find time in other shows for the network’s affiliates, which had to give up precious local ad minutes as part of the proceedings .\nAfter Ford decided to tamp down the prominence of its ad support in 2004, other automakers grew interested. Agent Bauer suddenly seemed quite pleased with a Hyundai Genesis in both “24: Redemption,” a TV movie based on the series, as well as in the show’s seventh season. More recently, when Fox launched a limited run of “24” in the late Spring of 2014, Chrysler was attached to the show, along with Sprint . Cisco, Allstate and Unilever have also been associated with the series at different times in its history.\nFord and Fox have worked together in noticeable ways for years. Ford was a longtime sponsor of “American Idol,” and continues to be associated with the network’s comic-book serial “Gotham.” Ford once even managed to crash into sitcom “New Girl,” gaining prominent in-show placement (and dialogue) when the title character took a job as a hostess at an auto show. Some critics complained the automaker’s outsize presence in the scene distracted viewers from the program.\nTaking part in “24” won’t be cheap. Ford spent almost $10.2 million on “24” in 2003, according to ad-spend tracker Kantar, followed by a little more than $6.5 million in 2004. The average cost of an ad in the show for this season is said to total around $138,720, according to Variety’s annual survey of primetime commercial prices . Some packages associated with the program are believed to cost more.\nRelated stories\nInfluential Media Buyer GroupM Seeks Big Changes in TV Measurement for 2017 Upfront (EXCLUSIVE)\nBMW Signs as Auto Sponsor of Bravo's 'Top Chef'\nRino Scanzoni, Madison Avenue's Influential Media Buyer, Will Tackle New Task as Advertising Shifts\nGet more from Variety and Variety411 : Follow us on Twitter , Facebook , Newsletter",

      "text": "German Ford Mustang Cop Car Demands Respect Polizei pony car promotes safe tuning By: Alex Nishimoto December 1, 2016 \nF or whatever reason, any car ends up being several magnitudes cooler once it’s turned into a cop car. The result is the same even when you start with an already cool car, as evidenced by Germany’s new Polizei Ford Mustang. \nThe special Ford Mustang GT is the German police force’s new “Tune it! Safe!” demo car that will be used as an outreach tool to promote safe vehicle modification. The car was commissioned by the Verband der Automobil Tuner (VDAT), essentially Germany’s equivalent of the Specialty Equipment Market ( SEMA ), and is sponsored by Germany’s Federal Ministry of Transport and Digital Infrastructure, among other organizations. The car was built by Wolf Racing, which tuned the Mustang GT’s 5.0-liter Coyote V-8 engine to 440 hp and added custom 20-inch alloy wheels wrapped in Hankook Ventus S1 Evo² tires, a height-adjustable coilover suspension, a body kit with front splitter, side sills, rear diffuser, a rear wing, and unique bumpers, and a sports exhaust system. \nThe modified Mustang cop car will serve as a sort of liaison to the tuner crowd in Germany, which may otherwise not be all that receptive to a police presence at their events. Though this Polizei pony car won’t chase down bad guys on the Autobahn, S550 Mustang interceptors do exist. Mustang tuner Steeda has offered a police package for law enforcement agencies since early this year.",

      "text": "Ford Might Expand The Fiesta's Active Trim To Other Models As Well | By Share After the unveiling of the all-new Fiesta earlier in the week, reports have started flowing in. One of them concerns the Active version , which features additional body cladding, increased ground clearance and roof bars for a crossover-like look. The Active look has a pretty good chance of being introduced on other models made by Ford, as AutoExpress writes, citing the brand's Vice President for Product Development, Joseph Bakaj. \" I think we'll continue to look at this. The Fiesta is going to be step one , and we're bringing it to the market next summer, so we'll know more there \", Bakaj said, without naming any possible candidates for the jacked-up version. Ford’s European boss Jim Farley commented that he doesn't expect the Fiesta Active, which is one of four trim levels available for the new supermini, to steal any sales from the brand's subcompact crossover, the EcoSport .

      "text": "Berkeley Energia hails the return of 'generalist funds to the sector', says Mining Capital's Ford Share 06:54 02 Dec 2016 \nMining Capital's Alastair Ford looks back and review's Mines & Money 2016 in London. \n''It took me quite a while to work about what I thought about this year's event, which I thought was interesting in itself'', says Ford. \n''The reason for that was while although the mood was quite slow the overall sector mood wider across the industry is actually a lot more upbeat this time around than it was last year''. \nFord adds: ''For a while I was thinking that the mood at Mines and Money wasn't really reflective of the mood in the industry overall and I think the reason for that is budgetary reasons and other reasons to do with timing''. \n''Although it was quite thinly populated, it was possible to find patches of optimism around. There were a couple of interesting moments when I came to realise that although it was quite thin on the ground this year, next year's event will probably be quite a humdinger''. \n''This signs of life were there'', Ford says. \n''I was speaking to Berkeley Energia [ LON:BKY , ASX:BKY ] ... and chief executive Paul Atherley's very enthusiastic as he always is. But what he said in particular that struck me was that in his most recent fundraising - $30 mln in November - generalist funds came in, and that's very significant. For the last few years, the sector's been held up with specialist mining money only. For someone like Paul to come along and say the generalist money is back, fund managers with no particular knowledge or interest in mining but are just looking to make decent investments are now interested in mining again - and that is a real bellwether moment.'' \nFord also ran through some of the companies doing the rounds at the event and those that caught his eye, including the likes of Anglesey Mining plc ( LON:AYM ), Redstar Gold ( CVE:RGC ) with their interesting assets in Canada as well as Condor Gold PLC [ LON:CNR ]'s Mark Child. \n''I was also interested to catch up with MGX Minerals [ CNQ:XMG ], a company out of Canada, which has got an interesting new way of producing Lithium from oilfields in Alberta. Although it's very early days for this project, given the interest in Lithium and cleaning up oilfields and the general thirst for new technologies ... MGX could make for quite an interesting proposition''.

      "text": "2017 Ford GT’s interior is just like on show car Email This Page To (separate emails with commas) Message (optional) Your email was sent successfully. Close Add to circle \nDeliveries of Ford Motor Company’s [NYSE:F] new GT supercar should be commencing any week now. Despite this, Ford is yet to fully showcase the car in production trim. We did get a glimpse at a production version during the 2016 24 Hours of Le Mans , but only its exterior. Now we have our first look at the interior. \nThe video below is from the Instagram account of Ken Block, who helped fine tune the Focus RS and raced one in the 2016 World Rallycross Championship. It shows Block hopping into one of the GTs during the car's testing phase. \nWe should note that this is a prototype so there may be some changes made for production. Nevertheless, it does give fans a definitive look at the interior design. \nWe’re glad to report that the design looks almost exactly like the one in the original show car that debuted at the 2015 Detroit auto show (shown above). There are some differences, though. For example, the rotary dial controller in the center console has been moved to just below the engine starter button. On the show car, the dial was further back. \nDeliveries of the new GT commence before the end of 2016 . The car arrives as a 2017 model and will be in production for at least four years. Unfortunately, there’s still no word on performance. What we know is that the car sports a carbon fiber monocoque structure and is powered by a mid-mounted twin-turbocharged 3.5-liter V-6 that will likely be rated at about 630 horsepower and 539 pound-feet of torque . The engine is mated to a 7-speed dual-clutch transmission and spins the rear wheels only. Ford has said that the starting price will be around $450,000.",

( ford.to/2guC2Ni )\nIn the affected vehicles, increased temperatures generated during deployment of the seat belt anchor pretensioner cables could cause them to separate, potentially reducing the seat belt's ability to adequately restrain an occupant in a crash, Ford said.\nPretensioners tighten up any slack in the seat belt webbing in the event of a crash and work in tandem with air bags.\nFord said it was aware of two accidents and two injuries associated with the issue.\n(Reporting by Arunima Banerjee in Bengaluru; Editing by Saumyadeb Chakrabarty)",

(http://ford.to/2guC2Ni) \nIn the affected vehicles, increased temperatures generated during deployment of the seat belt anchor pretensioner cables could cause them to separate, potentially reducing the seat belt's ability to adequately restrain an occupant in a crash, Ford said. \nPretensioners tighten up any slack in the seat belt webbing in the event of a crash and work in tandem with air bags. \nFord said it was aware of two accidents and two injuries associated with the issue. \n(Reporting by Arunima Banerjee in Bengaluru; Editing by Saumyadeb Chakrabarty) Related Links",

Posted 02 Dec 2016 22:10 A Ford logo is pictured at a car dealership in Monterrey, Mexico, November 9, 2016. REUTERS/Daniel Becerril/Files \nREUTERS - Ford Motor Co said on Friday it was recalling about 650,000 vehicles in North America to fix issues that could prevent seat belts from functioning properly in a crash. \nThe recall includes certain 2013-16 Ford Fusion, 2015-16 Ford Mondeo and 2013-15 Lincoln MKZ cars, Ford said. \nIn the affected vehicles, increased temperatures generated during deployment of the seat belt anchor pretensioner cables could cause them to separate, potentially reducing the seat belt's ability to adequately restrain an occupant in a crash, Ford said. \nPretensioners tighten up any slack in the seat belt webbing in the event of a crash and work in tandem with air bags. \nFord said it was aware of two accidents and two injuries associated with the issue. \n(Reporting by Arunima Banerjee in Bengaluru; Editing by Saumyadeb Chakrabarty) - Reuters",

If that happens the belts may not hold people. Ford says it knows of two injuries related to the problem. \nPre-tensioners tighten seat belts when they sense that cars are stopping. \nDealers will inject insulation into the pre-tensioners to protect the cables from heat at no cost to owners. The recall is expected to begin on Jan. 16. \nMost of the cars are in the U.S., Canada and Mexico.  ",

      "text": " 30   Ford Motor Co said on Friday it was recalling about 650,000 vehicles in North America to fix issues that could prevent seat belts from functioning properly in a crash. \nThe recall includes certain 2013–16 Ford Fusion, 2015–16 Ford Mondeo and 2013–15 Lincoln MKZ cars, Ford said. \nIn the affected vehicles, increased temperatures generated during deployment of the seat belt anchor pretensioner cables could cause them to separate, potentially reducing the seat belt's ability to adequately restrain an occupant in a crash, Ford said. \nPretensioners tighten up any slack in the seat belt webbing in the event of a crash and work in tandem with air bags. \nFord said it was aware of two accidents and two injuries associated with the issue.",
