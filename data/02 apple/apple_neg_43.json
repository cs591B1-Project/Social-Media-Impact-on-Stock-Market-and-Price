      "text": "An Apple iPhone 6 with Apple Pay is shown in this photo illustration in Encinitas, California, U.S. June 3, 2015. REUTERS/Mike Blake/File Photo More By Jamie Freed and Byron Kaye\nSYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's antitrust regulator said on Tuesday it is likely to deny four local banks permission to collectively bargain with Apple Inc in relation to its mobile digital payments system.\nBut the preliminary decision was \"finely balanced\" and could be reversed if the banks make a convincing case before a final opinion is due in March, Australian Competition and Consumer Commission Chairman Rod Sims told Reuters.\nLosing the case would be a setback to the banks' hopes of bypassing Apple's in-house payments system and rolling out their own iPhone versions free of competition from the Silicon Valley giant, which has the biggest smartphone market share in Australia.\nUnder Australian law, bargaining cartels can be formed as long as they have permission from authorities, and the banks are seeking the ability to offer their own digital wallets in Apple iPhones - the first major challenge to Apple Pay of its kind.\nCommonwealth Bank of Australia, Westpac Banking Corp, National Australia Bank Ltd and smaller rival Bendigo and Adelaide Bank Ltd also want to bargain with Apple over charging customers extra fees for transactions made through Apple Pay.\nA successful application would allow the banks - which jointly have two-thirds of the Australian credit card market - to collectively boycott Apple Pay for up to three years as a negotiating tactic.\nApple has argued that third parties should not have access to its digital wallet technology because it would undermine customers' privacy and data security. The company's representatives did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Tuesday.\nApple Pay allows users to register credit cards on devices such as iPhones, and pay for goods and services by swiping the devices over contactless payment terminals. Apple charges card providers for transactions via the service, which it introduced to Australia last year.\nIn their application, the banks argue that there is an information imbalance weighted in Apple's favour due to the secret nature of the terms Apple has agreed with competitors over the use of Apple Pay, including fees.\nSims said that if the ACCC determines that the heart of the banks' complaint lies with fees, then it would be difficult for them to win the case. But if it is more about access to Apple's contactless payment technology, then they had a stronger case.\nA representative for the banks behind the application, Lance Blockley, said there would be effectively no competition against Apple for mobile payments on the iPhone if the draft determination stood. The banks would continue to argue their case with the ACCC, he said.\nAustralia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd is the only one of Australia's \"Big Four\" banks to have a digital wallet agreement with Apple, betting that being one of the first to offer the service would help bring in more customers.\n(Reporting by Jamie Freed and Byron Kaye; Editing by Stephen Coates and Edwina Gibbs)",

      "text": "apple mac app store scammers cleaning report macbook inch touch pad More Bill Roberson/Digital Trends\nThe app stores provided by Microsoft, Google, and Apple are meant to be safe havens for consumers seeking out software for their devices. All three companies have safeguards in place to keep the malicious junk off their online markets, but the systems aren’t 100 percent foolproof, and sneaky developers find a way to slip inside and cause a little ruckus. Even more, apps may not be malicious in nature, but listed in such a way as to scam unsuspecting customers out of their hard-earned cash.\nApple’s “walled” storefronts for iOS and MacOS are seemingly impervious to malicious hackers, but How-To Geek took a look at what scammers are doing on the latter Mac App Store platform. The site discovered that scammers are not only making money from misleading listings, but Apple is getting its portion, too. Microsoft Excel is a perfect example, as there are a number of listed products that are seemingly the real deal, but instead are add-ons that require Microsoft Excel already installed.\nMore: Apple is looking at many options for the upcoming iPhone 8\nAs an example, one listing the report highlights is the “Office Bundle” for $30, which pulls up when searching for “Microsoft Excel” and is described as “the easiest way to create high-quality Word documents, Excel spreadsheets, and PowerPoint presentations.” Following that description is a bullet list of general Microsoft Office features. The software is actually a template bundle, but its listing says nothing of the sort.\nAdding to the problem is that Microsoft Office Suite isn’t offered on the Mac App Store, and many consumers are likely not aware of this. Armed with this knowledge, scammers are throwing up similar template bundles disguised as Microsoft applications. There are even listed apps that charge $20 or more for providing Microsoft’s free online version of Office into a dedicated browser, and paid Office editors with “Microsoft” in their names based on open-source software.\nThe problem doesn’t reside with just Office-related clones. This method is used across a wide variety of well-known brands. Search for Adobe’s popular InDesign publishing software and Mac users won’t find the actual tool, but bundles of tutorial videos with icons that closely resemble the official InDesign logo. Search for “Firefox” or “Chrome” and users will find suspicious software called “Fast Browser” for $1. The How-To Geek report even points to an uncanny amount of listed disk cleaners and memory cleaners Mac users simply don’t need.\nOverall, the point of the report is that scammers are mimicking official branding and literature to lure in unknowing customers to make some cash. Many are not listing the true nature of their apps, and are locking down search terms and figuring out a way to come out on top in search results to get the unsuspecting end-user’s attention first. Thus, based on the report, the Mac App Store should be Apple’s next project once it has completed the huge task of purging the outdated and broken apps from its App Store for iOS devices.\n2016 Macbook Pros becoming more versatile as Touch Bar receives more app support New to MacOS?

REUTERS/Lucy Nicholson More YANGON (Reuters) - More than 500 companies list among their suppliers Chinese-controlled firms that indirectly buy tin ore from a mine operated by an ethnic armed group in Myanmar, a Reuters examination of the supply chain found.\nThe Man Maw mine is controlled by the United Wa State Army (UWSA), which the United States placed under sanctions for alleged narcotics trafficking.\nThat potentially puts companies at risk of violating sanctions that forbid \"direct or indirect\" dealings with blacklisted groups. The world's No. 1 tin producer, Yunnan Tin Co Ltd, is one of the Chinese firms that buy tin from the Man Maw mine, through intermediaries. Here is a list of some of the companies who list Yunnan Tin among their suppliers, and their responses to Reuters' requests for comment:\n- Apple: Apple said in a statement it worked with suppliers to help them meet stringent standards, \"and those who are ultimately unable or unwilling to comply are removed from our supply chain\".\n\"While we have no evidence of illegal tin from Myanmar in our products, we'll continue to investigate, address any issues we find and do all we can to raise standards and protect human rights,\" it said.\n- Starbucks: Starbucks said small amounts of Yunnan Tin metal, sourced from second or third party suppliers, went into the ovens used to heat pastries in its coffee shops. The company had received no information indicating it was using minerals from Myanmar, a spokeswoman said, but was pushing suppliers for more detailed souring disclosures.\n- Macy's: \"We have no business relationship with Yunnan Tin or its suppliers and do not direct vendors to source from it. As noted in our Conflict Minerals Report, the disclosed processors, including Yunnan Tin, may not be part of our supply chain. Most vendors report processor information for all of their products, not just for those that they sell to us,\" the company said, adding that it had \"brought this matter to the attention of Conflict Free Sourcing Initiative (CFSI) for its further investigation\".\n- Target: \"Target is committed to responsible business conduct. In turn, we expect our suppliers to share in our principles and uphold our standards. We take these allegations very seriously, and we are looking into this\".\n- Tiffany & Co: Tiffany said one of its suppliers had indirectly sourced a \"very small amount of tin\" from the Chinese smelter for use in silver solder for jewellery and hollowware. The company added that, as Yunnan Tin was certified as conflict-free by the CFSI, \"use of this smelter by our vendors is consistent with our Conflict Minerals Policy\".\n- Huawei Technologies: \"Huawei has no direct contract with Yunnan Tin. They are a very small supplier to one of our contractors. We have sought Yunnan Tin's response to the issues raised. We will consider any necessary next steps once a response has been received. We expect all suppliers and their contractors to comply with all local laws and ethics. We will take all necessary actions when these standards are unmet\". - General Electric: A GE spokesman said the company strived to use ethical sourcing in its mineral supply chain.\n\"We routinely examine the smelters in our global supply chain either through direct audits or those performed by groups such as the Conflict Free Sourcing Initiative,\" the spokesman said, adding it had \"noted the concerns raised by Reuters and will address them through our internal process and with our external partners\". - Lenovo: The PC-maker said it did not have any direct relationship with Yunnan Tin or any other smelters. \"All our suppliers abide by a code of conduct of working with us and are regularly audited by our own supply chain team,\" the company said, adding that it would \"revisit our tin suppliers and investigate the concerns flagged\".\n- Nokia: Nokia said that only a small amount of the tin produced globally went into the ICT industry, and that the smelters concerned were \"several tiers away from Nokia\".\n\"Given our aforementioned lack of exposure to tin we have not seen enough evidence that Yunnan Tin would source tin from UWSA-controlled mines. We pride ourselves on our transparency – we make our smelter names public so we can be held accountable,\" the company said, adding that it would \"run further due diligence and then notify our suppliers and escalate the issue as needed\" if further evidence is presented.\nRead More - Ericsson: \"We do not have any direct purchasing relationship with smelters and refiners. However, we closely follow issues related to conflict minerals, and we work together with our suppliers to improve responsible business practice in our supply chain and increase the number of smelters certified as conflict-free in accordance with the Conflict Free Smelter Programme. We encourage the evolvement of the CFSI certification scheme to cover more geographies than today and intend to become more active in this evolvement\". - Foxconn Technology: Foxconn said it \"enforced stringent supplier management requirements in accordance with international and local conflict minerals legislations and has proactively communicated these requirements to our suppliers\". The company added that less than 1 percent of its tin was procured from Yunnan Tin, all of which was used in products for a \"single, non-U.S.-based customer\". - Pegatron Corp: Pegatron said it carried out \"annual due diligence on suppliers and encourage them to source from validated conflict-free supply chains... Pegatron will continue working with customers and international organizations to investigate and source minerals responsibly,\" the company added.\n(Reporting By Yimou Lee in Yangon, Jussi Rosendahl in Helsinki, Helena Soderpalm in Stockholm, JR Wu in Taipei, Paul Carsten in Beijing and Sijia Zhang in Hong Kong; Editing by Alex Richardson)",

      "text": "> Technology Apple MacBook Pro with Touch Bar comes to India starting Rs 1,55,900 for 256 GB version MacBook Pro 2016 have been almost sold out in most regions and the one with the Touch Bar are the most popular ones. By Rutu Ladage | Published: November 29, 2016 2:04 PM IST Comments Apple MacBook Pro 2016 \nApple has finally launched their Apple MacBook Pro, the latest MacBook Pro in their line up with the 2016 upgraded version. The one new thing that we saw inApple MacBook Pro and that made the all new MacBopok Pro a complete hit was the TouchID and Sensor Bar by Apple. Basically, the Touch ID or Touch Bar simply replaces your Function Keys (the F1, F2, F3) keys on the top of your keyboard with an all new touch interface, opening up a host of possibilities with the new form factor. However, since Apple unveiled a range of Apple MacBook Pro, not all the MacBooks come with the Touch Bar and the very basic one still skips the Touch bar as it is the cost-effective one. Except for the Touch Bar, all other MacBook Pro’s have top end features and not too much of a difference when it comes to the internals and the hardware except for display size and memory variants. \nNow, coming to the entire range of Apple MacBook Pro 2016 in the country. Apple has launched all of the devices in India and has not skipped any or not decided to make away with any. The entire range is priced over Rs 1 lakh in India and the very basic version begins at Rs 1,29,900 with the prices going as high as Rs 2,41,900 for the most advanced version. The prices range as follows – The very basic variant is the 256 GB internal memory variant which comes with a 13-inch retina display and is priced for Rs 1,29,900. This version is the only budget option and it comes without the TouchBar. The second version which is the 13-inch version with 256GB and Touch Bar is priced Rs 1,55,900 for the 256GB version. The one with the higher memory version at 512 GB internal memory is priced at Rs 1,72,900. So the 13 inch versions come in 3 variants. The second display version is the larger 15-inch version where there is no 15-inch MacBook without the Touch Bar. he 256 GB storage version comes priced at Rs 2,05,900 while the Indian rates for the 512 GB version is Rs 2,41,900. \nMacBook Pro 2016 have been almost sold out in most regions and the one with the Touch Bar are the most popular ones. However, Apple is slowly re-stocking the variants and only in the last week have they begun to be available again. The Indian launch of Apple MacBook Pro comes over a month after Apple launched their Apple MacBook Pro on october 27th. The devices will be available online and also through Apple re-sellers in the country. However, the Apple MacBook Pro is not yet available online across most e-commerce portals. However, it is available on eBay, where it is the international version and not the Indian version and the rates for the device are much higher than the Indian rates. eBay sellers are selling the 512 GB 15-inch MacBook Pro version for Rs 249,999 which is not too high but a marginal increase over the actual price. However, now that the device has been officially launched, the prices are bound to drop. 4 Problems with the latest MacBook Pro and Apple’s excuses for a disappointing product \nApple MacBook Pros have been much in demand across multiple segments and everyone loves the devices. However, the 2016 version of the device disappointed as much as it excited. While some of the changes like the Touch Bar and the Touch ID which brings the fingerprint sensor for the first time to Apple’s MacBook devices were much welcomes, there were some others which users felt Apple forced on them. There were also a whole lot of trolls and memes surrounding Apple that emerged after their forced and unwanted changes to the Apple MacBook Pro 2016. One of the most discussed and panned changes was the USB C type connectors. Apple MacBook Pro comes with only USB C type connectors and that is a huge hassle for photographers who use th device. Another issue is the lack of an SD card slot which would have enabled graphic designers and also those who need quick transfer of their images from cameras to MacBooks to seamlessly transfer but now, there’s a dongle needed for the same. The 16GB RAM has not endeared the device to users either. \nSo then, with so many problems but the one amazing thing like Touch Bar, what will you choose? Buy the Apple MacBook Pro or skip this and buy the previous editions? Or simply stick to Windows or Android devices and hope the 2017 versions are half better?

      "text": "Apple to Set Up R&D Centre in Jakarta Next Year, Tips Report After India and China, Apple eyeing Indonesia for R&D centre Apple likely to set up an R&D centre in Jakarta The company is expected recruit employees for R&D centre in early 2017 \nApple is reportedly gearing to set up a research and developments (R&D) centre in Indonesia's Jakarta, after setting up similar centres in India and China. According to an Indonesia-based report, Apple will start building structures for its R&D centre in early 2017. \nThe report quotes Communication and Information Minister, Rudiantara, who claimed that the preparations for the project are in their final stages. \"The preparation of the project development is in the final stage. The Industry Ministry and the Communication and Informatics Ministry are finalising the plan,\" said Rudiantara. Apple has reportedly proposed several options for the R&D centre location in Jakarta. \nAdding further, he said, \"It's more important. By late December, they will commence the execution for the location. So, in 2017, they will start building structures and recruiting employees.\" Apple is yet to make any announcement regarding setting up a new R&D centre in Indonesia. Apple earlier this year established a Design and Development Accelerator in Bengaluru for iOS apps. The company had said that the new centre will have an aim to \"support engineering talent\" and \"accelerate growth\" in India's developer community. The development centre is expected to open in early 2017. Apart from a Design and Development Accelerator, Apple also announced its new office in Hyderabad focused on development of Maps for Apple products.\nApple in India is looking to expand its retail presence and earlier this year Tim Cook met Prime Minister Narendra Modi to pursue a license to set up its own stores, which is rumoured to open as early as next year. \nThe Cupertino giant last month said it will set up a R&D Centre in Shenzen, China, while earlier reports pointed to the establishment of another centre in Beijing.",

      "text": "Australian Banks Denied Collective Negotiation For Apple Pay By Tyler Lee on 11/29/2016 03:09 PST \nIn the markets that Apple Pay has launched in, for the most part it has been a pretty smooth launch without too many hiccups, save for launch day in Japan where Apple Pay ran into some technical issues . However for the most part, banks and retailers and financial services have been pretty receptive to the platform. \nUnfortunately over in Australia, things are a little different . The service has officially launched in the country, but some of the country’s major banks are resisting the service and had previously requested the country’s antitrust regulator to allow them to negotiate with Apple collectively. However it seems that their request has been denied . \nAccording to a preliminary decision made by the antitrust regulators, they have denied the banks’ request to negotiate as a collective. However given that the decision was “finely balanced”, it is possible that the banks could sway them come March when the final decision is expected to be handed down. \nSo far ANZ is the only major bank out of the four major banks in Australia to have adopted the platform. For those who aren’t ANZ’s customers, it seems that unless Apple and the banks can come to an agreement, you’ll just have to keep waiting a little bit longer. \nFiled in Apple > Cellphones .

      "text": "Apple iPhone 7 Apple is reportedly testing a new iPhone prototype sporting organic light-emitting displays (OLED) with better resolutions than those offered by Samsung smartphones.\nAccording to reports, Apple, at present, is testing over 10 prototypes, including an OLED display iPhone. Although, Apple is expected to unveil the OLED display prototype, analysts predict Apple might decide not to release the model by next year because it is one of more than 10 prototypes being considered.\nThe chances of Apple releasing OLED display iPhone are pretty low, but if Apple decides to release such a model, you could expect a higher price tag than usual. Analysts explain that OLED displays are thinner, lighter and allow for flexible design, but they could be expensive to produce, around $50 higher.\nApple has asked suppliers to increase the OLED display production. The Cupertino firm is likely to ask Samsung for most of its initial OLED needs but it wants LG Display, Japan Display and Sharp, Apple’s key display suppliers, to ramp up the production to have supplies for 2018, reported Wall Street Journal.",

      "text": "Republish this article \n  The ACCC has blocked the big four banks from bargaining with Apple for more control over Apple Pay. Damir Sagolj/Reuters \nThe Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) is planning to deny the Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA), Westpac, National Australia Bank (NAB) and Bendigo and Adelaide Bank (the banks), petition to collectively bargain with and boycott Apple on Apple Pay. \nJustifying the decision, ACCC chairman Rod Sims said that the likely benefits of allowing the banks to collectively bargain does not outweigh the potential negative affects. \nThe banks are desperate to get access to Apple phones, not least as ANZ recently claimed a surge in applications for their credit and debit cards after striking a deal with Apple. This shift in consumer behaviour could potentially reduce the customer base of the other banks, simultaneously increasing both ANZ’s customer base and the use of its payments services. \nBut Apple imposes fees and restrictions that the banks currently find prohibitive. \nThe banks wanted to bargain with Apple over two key issues. The first is access to the Near-Field Communication (NFC) controller in iPhones, which would enable them to offer their own digital wallets to iPhone customers (in direct competition with Apple’s digital wallet), bypassing Apple Pay. The second is to remove the the restriction Apple imposes on banks, preventing them from passing on fees that Apple charges for the use of its digital wallet. Chairman of the ACCC, Rod Sims, believes it’s best to deny the big four banks the right to collude and bargain with Apple. Dean Lewins/AAP It’s all about negotiating power \nAt the moment only consumers with certain cards issued by ANZ, American Express and card issuers using Cuscal Ltd as their collective negotiator, are able to use Apple Pay. It’s been reported that ANZ agreed to share with Apple some of the fee it charges to process payments in exchange for access to Apple Pay \nIf the ACCC had decided in favour of the banks they could have, in theory, used their combined negotiating power to strike an even better deal with Apple. Not only would they have been bargaining from a stronger position, they could also have threatened to boycott Apple Pay for up to three years. \nThe ACCC argued this have would reduced the competitive tension between the banks in their individual negotiations with Apple, which could also reduce the competition to supply mobile payment services for iPhones. The threat of a boycott could also mean a significant period of uncertainty and would result in decreased choice for the consumers whose banks are involved. The other digital wallet options for the banks are Android Pay and Samsung Pay, both of which are available in Australia, but the iPhone popularity with consumers makes Apple Pay very attractive to both consumers and banks. \nThe ACCC may have decided against allowing the banks to bargain collectively, as this would also have set a precedent for any future disputes between the banks and their service providers. The banks may have over played their hand by also threatening a boycott against Apple. Reduced competition could have knock-on effects \nAnother deciding factor in the ACCC’s decision was that digital wallets/mobile payments are still in their infancy in Australia and consumers are already using their contactless cards to do “tap and go” payments. A rash decision now to allow collective bargaining with Apple could distort the mobile payment market and further delay the adoption of this technology. \nThe use of tap and go payments has risen greatly in recent years, accounting for up to 75% of all Visa transactions . This has caused many consumers to question, exactly what the advantages are of digital wallets over contactless cards. The absence of an obvious advantage over other payment methods like contactless cards has slowed the adoption of mobile payments in Australia. Any reduction in competition could stall this even longer. What next for Apple pay \nThe ACCC’s decision is just a draft at this stage and there’ll be further public consultations. It plans to release its final decision on March 2017, but in the meantime there will be further uncertainty about the adoption and use of digital wallets in Australia. \nThe banks now have two distinct choices. They can either continue to act collectively and seek to persuade the ACCC that the draft decision is not the correct one, or they can independently approach Apple to see if they can negotiate a better or at least an equivalent deal to that already struck by ANZ.",

      "text": "UPDATE 3-Australian regulator set to oppose collective bank bargaining on Apple Pay Updated: November 29, 2016 — 12:44 AM EST Share \n* Setback for banks looking to roll out their own digital wallets \n* Decision finely balanced, could be reversed - regulator \n* Final ruling to be made by March (Recasts, adds regulator comment that decision finely balanced) \nBy Jamie Freed and Byron Kaye \nSYDNEY, Nov 29 (Reuters) - Australia's antitrust regulator said on Tuesday it is likely to deny four local banks permission to collectively bargain with Apple Inc in relation to its mobile digital payments system. \nBut the preliminary decision was \"finely balanced\" and could be reversed if the banks make a convincing case before a final opinion is due in March, Australian Competition and Consumer Commission Chairman Rod Sims told Reuters. \nLosing the case would be a setback to the banks' hopes of bypassing Apple's in-house payments system and rolling out their own iPhone versions free of competition from the Silicon Valley giant, which has the biggest smartphone market share in Australia. \nUnder Australian law, bargaining cartels can be formed as long as they have permission from authorities, and the banks are seeking the ability to offer their own digital wallets in Apple iPhones - the first major challenge to Apple Pay of its kind. \nCommonwealth Bank of Australia, Westpac Banking Corp, National Australia Bank Ltd and smaller rival Bendigo and Adelaide Bank Ltd also want to bargain with Apple over charging customers extra fees for transactions made through Apple Pay. \nA successful application would allow the banks - which jointly have two-thirds of the Australian credit card market - to collectively boycott Apple Pay for up to three years as a negotiating tactic. \nApple has argued that third parties should not have access to its digital wallet technology because it would undermine customers' privacy and data security. The company's representatives did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Tuesday. \nApple Pay allows users to register credit cards on devices such as iPhones, and pay for goods and services by swiping the devices over contactless payment terminals. Apple charges card providers for transactions via the service, which it introduced to Australia last year. \nIn their application, the banks argue that there is an information imbalance weighted in Apple's favor due to the secret nature of the terms Apple has agreed with competitors over the use of Apple Pay, including fees. \nSims said that if the ACCC determines that the heart of the banks' complaint lies with fees, then it would be difficult for them to win the case. But if it is more about access to Apple's contactless payment technology, then they had a stronger case. \nA representative for the banks behind the application, Lance Blockley, said there would be effectively no competition against Apple for mobile payments on the iPhone if the draft determination stood. The banks would continue to argue their case with the ACCC, he said. \nAustralia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd is the only one of Australia's \"Big Four\" banks to have a digital wallet agreement with Apple, betting that being one of the first to offer the service would help bring in more customers.

      "text": "INSIGHT-For Apple and others, tin supply chain has ties to rebel-held Myanmar mine Updated: November 28, 2016 — 10:27 PM EST Share \n* United Wa State Army blacklisted by U.S. over drug trafficking \n* Mine run by armed group in \"Wa State\" is a major producer of tin \n* Top smelter Yunnan Tin indirectly buys big quantities of Wa tin \n* Many international companies list Yunnan Tin as a supplier \n* Sourcing tin from mine puts firms at risk of sanctions breach (Updates with new headline) \nBy Yimou Lee and Joel Schectman \nYANGON/WASHINGTON, Nov 29 (Reuters) - From a remote corner of northeastern Myanmar, an insurgent army sells tin ore to suppliers of some of the world's largest consumer companies. \nMore than 500 companies, including leading brands such as smartphone maker Apple, coffee giant Starbucks and luxury jeweler Tiffany & Co, list among their suppliers Chinese-controlled firms that indirectly buy ore from the Man Maw mine near Myanmar's border with China, a Reuters examination of the supply chain found. \nThe mine is controlled by the United Wa State Army (UWSA), which the United States placed under sanctions for alleged narcotics trafficking in 2003. The seven companies extracting tin from the mine are all owned or controlled by Wa military and government leaders, Wa officials and people with close ties to UWSA leadership told Reuters. \nThis potentially puts companies, which also include industrial conglomerate General Electric, at risk of violating sanctions that forbid \"direct or indirect\" dealings with blacklisted groups, according to a former and a serving U.S. official and lawyers with expertise in sanctions enforcement. \nSeveral sanctions experts said the U.S. government was unlikely to fine companies who unwittingly used the Myanmar tin. Still, it may force them to shift to new suppliers, they said. \nA Treasury Department spokeswoman said U.S. sanctions \"generally prohibit U.S. companies from engaging in any direct or indirect transactions or dealings with individuals or entities\" on a blacklist, but declined further comment on specific circumstances. \nThe situation illustrates the difficulties facing multinationals in monitoring supply chains that have grown increasingly complex. \nFollowing a 2012 U.S. regulation, companies have spent billions of dollars scrutinizing whether certain minerals used in their products come from mines controlled by armed groups in Central Africa. \nBut the regulations do not require them to assess the origins of minerals from other conflict zones. \nApple, Tiffany and GE, and other companies contacted by Reuters, said that to fulfill those regulations they looked to an audit program designed by the industry group Conflict Free Sourcing Initiative (CFSI). \nA CFSI program director said the group was \"aware of tin exports from Myanmar to other countries and of security and human rights issues in Myanmar.\" The group said it was updating its audit requirements to include \"a broader definition of conflict-affected and high-risk areas.\" \nTin supply chain expert at monitoring group Global Witness, Sophia Pickles, said companies must not wholly outsource due diligence responsibility to a scheme that has exclusively focused on central Africa. \n\"Companies, not schemes, bear the primary responsibility for ensuring that supply chains are responsible,\" she said. \nCIVIL WAR \nMost of the tin mined globally is used as solder in electronics, for making batteries and plating. \nThe Man Maw mine roiled the global tin market when huge quantities of high grade ore were discovered around 2013. Annual production is now estimated at about 33,000 tons of tin concentrate, more than a 10th of global output of the metal. \nThe mine is controlled by the UWSA, the strongest of the myriad armed groups that have kept Myanmar in a state of near-perpetual civil war for decades. Reuters visited the remote mine last month, the first international media organization to do so. \nInterviews with officials running the mine, UWSA leaders and executives at Asian tin suppliers, together with an examination of public disclosures of suppliers made by companies in regulatory filings, indicate Wa tin likely ends up in an array of products made by U.S. and other international companies. \nTin from Man Maw provides revenue critical to the survival of the self-proclaimed Wa State and its rulers, who have refused to disarm or participate in Myanmar's peace process. \n\"There are dozens of trucks carrying tin ore to China every morning,\" the head of the Wa territory foreign affairs office, Zhao Guo An, told Reuters. \"Tin mining is the pillar of our economy. It's the biggest source of income.\" \nWhile Washington has lifted most sanctions on Myanmar, some have been kept in place, including those aimed at the UWSA. The group and several of its leaders are blacklisted under the Kingpin Act over accusations of trafficking in heroin and methamphetamine. UWSA leaders deny involvement in narcotics, saying the accusations are a smear by political opponents. \nPeter Kucik, a former senior sanctions advisor at the U.S. Treasury Department, said the findings highlighted the need for thorough due diligence. \n\"The facts suggest potential sanctions risk for the parties involved,\" Kucik said. \nTwo companies in Apple's supply chain, the world's No. 1 tin producer Yunnan Tin Co Ltd and leading Taiwan-based solder maker Shenmao Technology, told Reuters that some tin they bought was from the Wa mine. \nMandy Gan, a tin analyst from China's leading mineral research company, Asian Metal, and another tin expert, both of whom visited the UWSA mine this year, said many other Chinese smelting firms supplying global consumer goods makers also bought tin from the Man Maw mine. \nSanctions experts said even the indirect use of the tin might be considered a violation of U.S. sanctions law, which does not require authorities to prove intent. A U.S. government official involved in Myanmar policy consulted on Reuters' findings said the government was likely to investigate any ties to the UWSA. \nStill, Washington-based sanctions attorney Erich Ferrari said it was unlikely the Treasury Department would initiate an enforcement action against companies for an issue so deep in the supply chain. Once the ties were publicized, however, authorities could impose penalties if the companies did not wind down the transactions and find new suppliers, he said. \nSUPPLY CHAIN \nThe chain connecting some of the world's best known brands with a mine in one the most inaccessible corners of Southeast Asia has many links. \nOne key intermediary is state-owned Yunnan Cultural Industry International (YCII), based in Yunnan, southwestern China, which said in a statement on its website that it enjoys \"a long-term, stable strategic partnership\" with the UWSA statelet. \nYCII declined several interview requests. \nYCII is, in turn, a major supplier of tin to the world's top producer, Yunnan Tin, also based in Yunnan. \nYunnan Tin supplies many companies, including big contract manufacturers such as Foxconn Technology Co and, indirectly, Pegatron Corp, whose clients include Apple. It also supplies major solder makers such as Shenmao Technology, also a supplier to Pegatron. \n\"Myanmar is not considered a conflict-affected area by CFSI...As long as smelters present a certified sourcing document, that's acceptable for us,\" said Tim Lin, an executive overseeing sourcing at Taiwan-based Shenmao, who said about a quarter of its supply of the metal came from Yunnan Tin. \nIn the last two years, Yunnan Tin has also shipped more than 12,000 tons of metal to the United States, according to shipment data from U.S.-based trade tracking company Panjiva. \nMore than 500 publicly traded companies in the United States say their suppliers use tin from Yunnan Tin or Yuntinic Resources, its San Mateo, California-based division, according to a review of the supply chain disclosures consumer companies make to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. \nTwo members of Yunnan Tin's board, vice chairwoman Yang Yimin and secretary and vice general manager Pan Wenhao, confirmed in interviews that a \"portion\" of the company's tin came from the UWSA-operated mine. \n\"We certainly buy tin indirectly from Myanmar,\" Pan told Reuters. \"We don't specifically pay attention to where they source their materials from.\" \nYunnan Tin mixes the Wa tin with metal from mines in central and southwestern China, said Pan, before processing it into products such as tin paste. \nThat means it is impossible to say for certain which shipments from the company contain Wa tin, but Pan estimated Yunnan Tin's purchases from the mine account for about a third of its total annual tin consumption, or at least 16,500 tons. \nApple said in a statement it worked with suppliers to help them meet stringent standards, \"and those who are ultimately unable or unwilling to comply are removed from our supply chain.\" \n\"While we have no evidence of illegal tin from Myanmar in our products, we'll continue to investigate, address any issues we find and do all we can to raise standards and protect human rights,\" it said. \nFoxconn said it \"enforced stringent supplier management requirements in accordance with international and local conflict minerals legislation and has proactively communicated these requirements to our suppliers.\" \nIt added that less than 1 percent of its tin was procured from Yunnan Tin, all of which was used in products for a \"single, non-U.S.-based customer.\" \nPegatron Corp said it carried out \"annual due diligence on suppliers and encourage them to source from validated conflict-free supply chains.\" \n\"Pegatron will continue working with customers and international organizations to investigate and source minerals responsibly,\" the company added. \nFROM JEWELLERY TO APPLIANCES \nCompanies that sell consumer products in the United States are required by the Dodd-Frank Act to publish their suppliers of tin and other minerals. \nAmong the companies listing Yunnan Tin, Tiffany said one of its suppliers had indirectly sourced a \"very small amount of tin\" from the Chinese smelter for use in silver solder for jewelry and hollowware. \nThe company added that, as Yunnan Tin was certified as conflict-free by the CFSI, \"use of this smelter by our vendors is consistent with our Conflict Minerals Policy.\" \nStarbucks said small amounts of Yunnan Tin metal, sourced from second or third party suppliers, went into the ovens in its coffee shops. \nThe company had received no information indicating it was using minerals from Myanmar, a spokeswoman said, but was pushing suppliers for more detailed sourcing disclosures. \nA GE spokesman said the company strived to use ethical sourcing in its mineral supply chain, adding it had \"noted the concerns raised by Reuters and will address them through our internal process and with our external partners.\" \nA spokeswoman from discount retailer Target said in a statement it was \"committed to responsible business conduct.\" \n\"We take these allegations very seriously, and we are looking into this,\" the statement said. \n(Additional reporting by Antoni Slodkowski in Yangon, JR Wu in Taipei, Jussi Rosendahl in Helsinki and Helena Soderpalm in Stockholm, Paul Carsten in Beijing and Sijia Zhang in Hong Kong; Editing by Alex Richardson) Published: November 28, 2016 — 10:27 PM EST We encourage respectful comments but reserve the right to delete anything that doesn't contribute to an engaging dialogue Help us moderate this thread by flagging comments that violate our guidelines Commenting policy | Comments FAQ Comment policy: \nPhilly.com comments are intended to be civil, friendly conversations.

Apple charges card providers for transactions via the service, which it introduced to Australia last year. \nCommonwealth Bank of Australia, Westpac Banking Corp, National Australia Bank Ltd and smaller Bendigo and Adelaide Bank Ltd, which jointly have two-thirds of the Australian credit card market, argued that letting Apple restrict use of mobile wallets was anti-competitive. \nApple argued that it had not granted access to its digital wallet technology to third-parties anywhere in the world because it would undermine customers' privacy and data security. \nA representative for the banks behind the application was not immediately available for comment. \nThe ACCC said it would consult further and give a final decision in March 2017. \nAustralia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd, Australia's third biggest bank by market capitalisation, has its own digital wallet agreement with Apple. \n(Reporting by Jamie Freed and Byron Kaye; Editing by Richard Pullin and Stephen Coates) Published: November 28, 2016 — 7:50 PM EST We encourage respectful comments but reserve the right to delete anything that doesn't contribute to an engaging dialogue Help us moderate this thread by flagging comments that violate our guidelines Commenting policy | Comments FAQ Comment policy: \nPhilly.com comments are intended to be civil, friendly conversations.

      "text": "Australian regulator set to oppose collective bank bargaining on Apple Pay Updated: November 29, 2016 — 12:58 AM EST Share Jamie Freed and Byron Kaye Reuters \nBy Jamie Freed and Byron Kaye \nSYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's antitrust regulator said on Tuesday it is likely to deny four local banks permission to collectively bargain with Apple Inc in relation to its mobile digital payments system. \nBut the preliminary decision was \"finely balanced\" and could be reversed if the banks make a convincing case before a final opinion is due in March, Australian Competition and Consumer Commission Chairman Rod Sims told Reuters. \nLosing the case would be a setback to the banks' hopes of bypassing Apple's in-house payments system and rolling out their own iPhone versions free of competition from the Silicon Valley giant, which has the biggest smartphone market share in Australia. \nUnder Australian law, bargaining cartels can be formed as long as they have permission from authorities, and the banks are seeking the ability to offer their own digital wallets in Apple iPhones - the first major challenge to Apple Pay of its kind. \nCommonwealth Bank of Australia , National Australia Bank Ltd and smaller rival Bendigo and Adelaide Bank Ltd also want to bargain with Apple over charging customers extra fees for transactions made through Apple Pay. \nA successful application would allow the banks - which jointly have two-thirds of the Australian credit card market - to collectively boycott Apple Pay for up to three years as a negotiating tactic. \nApple has argued that third parties should not have access to its digital wallet technology because it would undermine customers' privacy and data security. The company's representatives did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Tuesday. \nApple Pay allows users to register credit cards on devices such as iPhones, and pay for goods and services by swiping the devices over contactless payment terminals. Apple charges card providers for transactions via the service, which it introduced to Australia last year. \nIn their application, the banks argue that there is an information imbalance weighted in Apple's favor due to the secret nature of the terms Apple has agreed with competitors over the use of Apple Pay, including fees. \nSims said that if the ACCC determines that the heart of the banks' complaint lies with fees, then it would be difficult for them to win the case. But if it is more about access to Apple's contactless payment technology, then they had a stronger case. \nA representative for the banks behind the application, Lance Blockley, said there would be effectively no competition against Apple for mobile payments on the iPhone if the draft determination stood. The banks would continue to argue their case with the ACCC, he said. \nAustralia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd is the only one of Australia's \"Big Four\" banks to have a digital wallet agreement with Apple, betting that being one of the first to offer the service would help bring in more customers. \n(Reporting by Jamie Freed and Byron Kaye; Editing by Stephen Coates and Edwina Gibbs) Published: November 28, 2016 — 6:56 PM EST | Updated: November 29, 2016 — 12:58 AM EST We encourage respectful comments but reserve the right to delete anything that doesn't contribute to an engaging dialogue Help us moderate this thread by flagging comments that violate our guidelines Commenting policy | Comments FAQ Comment policy: \nPhilly.com comments are intended to be civil, friendly conversations.

      "text": "UPDATE 1-Australian regulator opposes collective bank bargaining on Apple Pay Updated: November 28, 2016 — 6:57 PM EST Share Reuters \n(Adds bank names, bank comment, digital wallet context) \nSYDNEY, Nov 29 (Reuters) - Three of Australia's four biggest banks will be barred from collectively bargaining with Apple Inc in relation to its mobile digital payments system, under a draft decision released by the antitrust regulator on Tuesday. \nThe Australian Competition and Consumer Commission said letting banks collectively offer their own integrated digital wallets in Apple iPhones, in competition with Apple's Apple Pay system, would reduce each bank's ability to negotiate with the U.S. firm. \n\"While the ACCC accepts that the opportunity for the banks to collectively negotiate and boycott would place them in a better bargaining position with Apple, the benefits are currently uncertain and may be limited,\" commission chairman Rod Sims said in a statement. \nThe decision is a setback for the banks' hopes to bypass Apple's in-house payments system and roll out their own versions free of competition from the Silicon Valley giant, which has the biggest smartphone market share in Australia. \nIt also sets a precedent which may solidify Apple's dominance of the digital wallet system globally, since the Australian banks had mounted the first challenge to it. \nApple Pay allows users to register credit cards on devices such as iPhones, and pay for goods and services by swiping the devices over contactless payment terminals. Apple charges card providers for transactions via the service, which it introduced to Australia last year. \nCommonwealth Bank of Australia, Westpac Banking Corp, National Australia Bank Ltd and smaller Bendigo and Adelaide Bank Ltd, which jointly have two-thirds of the Australian credit card market, argued that letting Apple restrict use of mobile wallets was anti-competitive. \nApple argued that it had not granted access to its digital wallet technology to third-parties anywhere in the world because it would undermine customers' privacy and data security. \nA representative for the banks behind the application was not immediately available for comment. \nThe ACCC said it would consult further and give a final decision in March 2017. \nAustralia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd, Australia's fourth biggest bank by market capitalisation, has its own digital wallet agreement with Apple. \n(Reporting by Jamie Freed and Byron Kaye; Editing by Richard Pullin and Stephen Coates) Published: November 28, 2016 — 6:57 PM EST We encourage respectful comments but reserve the right to delete anything that doesn't contribute to an engaging dialogue Help us moderate this thread by flagging comments that violate our guidelines Commenting policy | Comments FAQ Comment policy: \nPhilly.com comments are intended to be civil, friendly conversations.

      "text": "Cisco Oracle \nAnd this is what Moody’s has to say about Apple’s wondrous cash hoard, much of it overseas: \nBased on Apple’s reported results for its fiscal year that ended in September, Moody’s projects the company’s cash will exceed $250 billion by the end of calendar 2016, representing over 14% of total non-financial corporate cash. \nAnd then it dives straight into tax lobbying, in behalf of its clients, directed straight at Congress: \n“Without tax reform that reduces the negative financial consequences of repatriating money to the US, we expect offshore cash levels to continue increasing,” said Richard Lane, a Senior Vice President at Moody’s. \nThe financial media jumped on the bandwagon and quoted this falsehood for mass consumption in order to pressure Congress to give our multinational corporate heroes another opportunity to dodge taxes, on top of the countless opportunities already written into the tax code for them that small businesses don’t have access to. \nBut here’s the thing. In May 2013, Apple got into a pickle because it had decided to fund its stock-buy-back and dividend program by taking on a record $17 billion in debt rather than “repatriating” part of its “offshore” cash and paying income taxes on it. \nThe Senate subcommittee investigation and hearings, chaired by Senator John McCain , showed that Apple had sheltered at least $74 billion from US income taxes between 2009 and 2012 by using a “complex web” of offshore mailbox companies. The investigation found untaxed “offshore” profits of $102 billion held by Irish subsidiaries – which Apple refused to “repatriate” in order to keep that income from being taxed in the US. \nBut according to the Senate report, Apple doesn’t have to repatriate that moolah because it’s already in the US. The Irish mailbox subsidiaries, on whose books this money is for tax purposes, transferred it to Apple’s bank accounts in New York. The money is managed by an Apple subsidiary in Reno, Nevada, and is invested in all kinds of assets in the US. Apple’s accountants in Austin, Texas, keep the books, \nMoney doesn’t stop at borders. Tax accounting does. \nLast week, the Wall Street Journal added a new layer of misrepresentation to the tax lobbyists’ pitch. Because cash will move to the US (false), the dollar will go up. Um, even if Apple et al. were parking funds in a bank in Ireland, moving money across borders does not have a currency impact. The only way it would would be if Apple were holding the funds in foreign currencies and converted them to dollars. But most major multinationals, and Apple is clearly one of them, have their Treasury departments operate as profit centers, meaning they take currency bets. So even if the underlying phony claim (tax law change = money moves to US) were true, there’s not reason that would lead them to rearrange their trading/hedging bets. \nBut here is the nonsense from the Journal : \nPart of $2.5 trillion in profits held overseas by companies such as Apple Inc. and Microsoft Corp. could be heading back to the U.S., a move analysts say could further fuel the U.S. dollar’s powerful rally. \nU.S. corporations have been holding billions in earnings and cash abroad to avoid paying a 35% tax that would be levied whenever the money is brought home. \nThe article goes off the rails with remarkable speed, in the second sentence. Holding “earnings” abroad for tax purposes is not “holding cash abroad”. Help me. \nAnd even better, foreign exchange experts, supposed pros, are either so dumb that they haven’t bothered to understand the issue or so clever that they are stoking the misunderstanding so as to trade the other side. But the remarks below are from a “strategist” who is supposed to look smart in public, as opposed to a trader, who has every incentive to headfake his competitors. So the ignorance is pervasive: \nNow, some say the prospect of companies repatriating perhaps hundreds of billions of dollars could offer more impetus to the U.S. currency’s rally. \n“However small, however big this flow of money will be, it will be positive for the case of dollar strength,” said Daragh Maher, head of U.S. foreign-exchange strategy for HSBC Holdings. “There will most likely be an inflow into dollars.” \nBut following Soros’ reflexivity principle, if market professionals trade based on this pervasive misunderstanding, the dollar will appreciate. Or as Buffett frames it, in the short term, markets are a beauty contest and the myth of cash flowing out of Ireland into US dollars is a very pretty fable. 0 0 0 0 0 0",

      "text": "Reddit \nApple’s brand continues to dominate mindshare for the festive season, according to a survey by Piper Jaffray . The company holds the top two spots for most wanted gift this holiday season with both iPhone and MacBook far ahead of any other product category. \nThe iPhone was the clear leader, with 7.2 percent of people surveyed wanting a new iPhone , up from 5.2 percent in 2015. MacBook took second place on the chart (embedded after the jump), at 2.1% popularity … \nMacBook took the no. 2 gift spot this year with 2.1% share for the 2016 holiday wish list (up from 2% in 2015). The Xbox, which usually holds second place, was pushed down into third with 1.4% of the people asking for it. \nThe percentage demand for the remaining products pale in comparison to the iPhone and MacBook. The ‘Smartwatch’ category was fourth at 0.9% (with Apple Watch being some smaller slice of that number), PlayStation trailed at 0.8% and so on. Apple’s total mindshare was over 10% — the rest of the top ten list combined is only 4.6%. \nThe Piper Jaffray analyst Gene Munster said that iPhone 7 may have been an iterative update but consumers want it, represented by the increase in popularity on Christmas wish lists between this year and last year. \nMunster also said not to read too much into the re-introduction of Apple’s Black Friday promotions; mere gift card deals are not representative of a weakening demand for Apple products. In general, the survey shows that iPhone continues to be sought after. Mac laptops also seem to be doing well, in the minds of consumers. Guides",

      "text": "Pegatron Reportedly Working on Trial Production of Microsoft Surface Phones Reddit \nOne of Apple's major suppliers is reportedly getting ready with production trials of Microsoft's much-anticipated Surface phone. A China-based daily claims that Taiwan-based Pegatron will start trial production of Surface smartphone. Microsoft is rumoured to launch its Surface Phone in early 2017. \nThe report unfortunately doesn't get into specifics of the trial production of the Surface Phone. For those unaware, Taiwan's Pegatron is an Apple original design manufacturer (ODM). The report claims that Apple's order for iPhone accounts for nearly 60 percent of Pegatron's total sales. \nMicrosoft's Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella in a recent interview had assured the company's continued presence in the mobile space, he stated, \"We will continue to be in the phone market not as defined by today's market leaders, but by what it is that we can uniquely do in what is the most ultimate mobile device.\" The Redmond giant has been rumoured to be working three Surface models targeted at regular consumer, business user, and enthusiast categories. Unfortunately, there have been no details about what features would separate the smartphones in the specific categories. The Surface Phones for the different categories are expected to vary based on processor, storage, and other features . The three Surface phones are also rumoured to be priced in different tiers and meant for different markets.\nA Microsoft executive earlier this year teased the Surface Phone saying that it will be a high-end version catering to the enterprise market and will be 'category innovating' . \nSome reports have pointed that the delay in the launch of the Surface Phones has been caused due to developments in Windows 10 Mobile OS. Late last year, the Microsoft CMO tipped the company was developing a 'breakthrough' Surface Phone .",

However, Apple states that the included Thunderbolt 3 port provides up to 85 watts of charging power for MacBook Pro models with Thunderbolt 3 Type-C ports. \nThe P3 color space supported by this panel is typically used by digital movies here in the United States, and was defined by the Digital Cinema Initiatives (DCI) organization. It has the same blue primary color used by the Adobe RGB and sRGB color spaces, but has a different red primary than the other two. Thus, P3 provides more color than sRGB, and is seemingly equal in size to Adobe RGB. However, P3 has more reds and less blues and greens when compared to Adobe RGB. \nMore: LG is offering owners full refunds for a Nexus 5X hardware malfunction \nAccording to Apple, this upcoming 5K display is ideal for photo and video editing, working with a huge number of on-screen windows, and watching high-resolution videos. To use this panel, customers need MacOS Sierra 10.12.1 or later, and a Mac with a Thunderbolt 3 port. It comes with a 6.56-inch Thunderbolt 3 cable, a power cord, and a VESA cover for disconnecting the screen from its stand and mounting it on the customer’s preferred VESA mounting solution. \nRight now, Apple only lists the month of December as the display’s availability: an actual date isn’t provided. Even more, the “Add to Bag” button is currently grayed out, indicating that Apple may already be filled up on pre-orders for now. The price is a surprisingly low $974, but that may be for a limited time only as an introductory price. Also watch: PhotoFast iType-C is a Handy iPhone Storage Extension ",

      "text": "Feature How a little iOS magic in every new Touch Bar adds security It seems like Apple put a Watch under the hood of the new MacBook Pro's touch-based interface for security and interaction. Macworld | Nov 29, 2016 3:57 AM   Credit: Adam Patrick Murray MacBook Pro review: The Touch Bar bridges the gap between iPad and Mac \nFor years, people have speculated about whether Apple would ditch macOS in favor of iOS, shedding desktops and turning laptops into something like an iPad Pro in a fixed clamshell. A version of iOS has apparently come to the Mac, but not in a way that anybody expected. The new Touch Pad has a separate brain, a custom T1 ARM processor system-on-a-chip (SoC), that looks to be running a stripped-down variant of iOS, possibly derived from watchOS. \nSteve Troughton-Smith , an iOS developer known for deep examinations of how the operating system ticks, put the pieces together , some of which rely on information provided by Apple during on-the-record press briefings and on its site , and some from examining files within the newest release of Xcode, which allows developers to take advantage of Touch Bar. \nIt makes sense, because Apple has paired Touch ID in iOS with its custom Secure Enclave chip, a tamper-resistent security vault that’s separate from but intertwined with an iPhone or iPad’s processing circuitry. There’s a Secure Enclave chip in every Touch Bar, just as in every iOS device with Touch ID. \nWhen you enroll your fingerprints in Touch ID, the underlying data is pushed into Secure Enclave , and can’t be pulled back out. When you touch the sensor after that, the characteristics of your fingerprint get sent to Secure Enclave, which determines whether they’re a close enough match. Secure Enclave is used for other purposes, including storing and processing authorization information for Apple Pay. \nApple also confirmed in a briefing that the T1 also controls the ISP (image signal processor) for the FaceTime camera in the MacBook Pro, which is a dandy thing indeed. While it may seem like an overstated risk, an undesirable party gaining access to your camera without your knowledge is a huge vulnerability. Some super geeks dig in and remove video driver software, though malware that can exploit your system can certainly reinstall it secretly. Others put tape over the camera , a surprisingly effective low-tech strategy. However, routing camera access and data via a more heavily secured separate processing system reduces the surface area substantially of an attacker trying to gain access. \nThe Touch Bar and macOS interact with one another, with macOS rendering graphics and pushing them to the Touch Bar, which handles touch-interface events and sends them to macOS to interpret. This sounds like two small children driving a car: one can see the road and use the steering wheel, while the other is down below pushing the accelerator and the brake pedal. Fewer paths to exploit \nApple having a separate processor and OS to handle Touch ID is good news for consumers, because iOS, watchOS, and tvOS are more clamped down than macOS, which remains more open to inspect and manipulation as a general-computing platform. While iOS has suffered exploits, there should be even fewer paths to the Touch Bar to find and trigger flaws, as it acts as a peripheral rather than running apps directly. \nAt the time of the announcement, I assumed Apple could never make a Touch Bar-equipped keyboard, because of the necessary security required for a Secure Enclave chip and connection to a processor. But given that the T1, the Secure Enclave, and the Touch ID sensor are tightly integrated, this entire subsystem could make its way into a Touch Keyboard. Such a keyboard would probably draw too much power to be wireless, and because of the graphics rendering and touch events would require a consistent and fast connection for responsiveness, either USB-C or USB Type A. \nBecause Touch Bar runs separately, macOS doesn’t have to be in an active state for a user to interact with Touch ID. Apple says you’ll be able to unlock your Mac (and switch among enrolled users with fast-user switching) with Touch ID, but hasn’t provided the full workings yet. Unlike an iOS device, which is effectively fully secured when asleep, a Mac has just a thin veneer of protection unless it’s powered down. \nI recommend always having FileVault 2 enabled on your Macs (via the System Preferences > Security & Privacy). It’s the optional, built-in, full-disk encryption that locks away the encryption key until you power up and log in. Behind the scenes, a cold boot from a powered-down state launches a special login via the Recovery Disk, as your startup volume remains encrypted and unavailable. \nCan Touch ID let you bypass entering a password at a cold start? Nope. As with iOS, Apple has a variety of conditions under which Touch ID can’t be used, and you have to enter your passcode to re-enable it. One of those is a restart (whether a power down/power up or a system initiated reboot), because a restart assumes you might not want someone else to gain access to the device, even if they have access to—well, to you. \nBiometric authentication via a fingerprint on a Mac raises the same security and safety issues it does for iOS. If you’re at risk of domestic or criminal assault or unwarranted government intrusion, your fingerprint can be used to unlock a Mac just as easily as an iPhone. You might choose to not use Touch ID on a MacBook Pro for the same reason, or be just as sure about powering down your Mac as you would an iOS device.  ",

      "text": "Apple and Dried Cherry Crisp. © Miri Rotkovitz Updated September 09, 2016 . \nWhen you've got wonderful fall apples on hand, showcase them in this wholesome, dairy-free Apple and Dried Cherry Crisp. Because the crunchy crisp topping contains no butter, the flavors of the fruit, oats and nuts can really shine through. I like to use a mix of sweet and tart apple varieties , but if you have a favorite multipurpose apple, a single type can work nicely, too. \nTips: Want to boost the fiber and nutrients in this crisp? Leave some of the skin on the apples, and swap all or some of the all purpose flour for white whole wheat flour or whole grain pastry flour. \nServing a crowd? Just double the quantities, and bake in a 9- x 13- x 2-inch (or similarly sized) baking dish. \nNeed to tweak the recipe to satisfy special dietary needs? If nut allergies are a concern, you can skip the pecans. And if you need a gluten-free crisp, try replacing the all-purpose flour with your favorite gluten free 1-to-1 baking mix . (Be sure to use oats that are labeled gluten-free as well.)",

      "text": "Apple’s next iPhone could come with a curved OLED display, according to a new report by the Wall Street Journal .\nRumors surrounding the curved display have circulated since late last year , and new pieces of information have continued to drip in since then. Three separate sources ( a Sharp executive , a Barclays research analyst , and famed iPhone rumors specialist Ming-Chi Kuo ) have said Apple will release a model with an OLED display, and now sources on the production line say the company is increasing its supply of these types of displays.\nThe WSJ quotes Apple’s suppliers, who said they were asked to increase output of “thinner organic light-emitting displays” and submit prototype screens with better resolution than ones from South Korea’s Samsung. This could mean initial testing has been successful and now the Cupertino company wants to analyze the screens on a wider scale.\nApple has been battling slowing smartphone sales for more than a year now and is under pressure to deliver something big when it unveils its next iPhone in 2017, to mark the device’s 10th anniversary. A curved display would go some way to doing that but, according to “people familiar with the matter,” would almost certainly come with a higher price tag because OLED displays are more expensive to produce.\nThe report also states that an iPhone with a curved screen could be “on store shelves as soon as next year [but] Apple may decide not to release the model because it is one of more than 10 prototypes being considered.”\nApple has thus far declined to comment.\nMeanwhile, Samsung is planning to create a “foldable” smartphone .\n",

Here are the very best accessories that will thrill anyone who loves their iPhone, iPad, and Apple Watch. See larger image Mujjo Double Layer Touchscreen Gloves \nWinter time means extra layers, but thankfully this extra layer by Mujjo won’t get in the way of accessing all your touchscreen devices. The company’s new Double Layer Touchscreen Gloves ($34.95, available on Amazon ) work with all capacitive touch technologies, including the new Home button on the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus. \nThese gloves also have silicone dot patterns for extra grip, so that your iPhone or iPad won’t slip through your fingers even in rainy or snowy weather. Plus, the fleece lining gives an extra layer of interior softness and comfort. Mujjo Double Layer Touchscreen Gloves See larger image Logitech Create Keyboard Case \nAvailable for both iPad Pro sizes, the Logitech Create keyboard ( $129.99 for 9.7-inch and $149.99 for the 12.9-inch , available on Amazon ) is the Incredible Hulk of iPad Pro cases. It was designed to work exclusively with the Smart Connector, so you can bypass needing to charge it seperately or pair it using Bluetooth—you just hook it up, and it instantly works. \nThe Create keyboard gives the iPad Pro the feel of typing on a traditional laptop. The keys are even backlit (which you can adjust), and it also has a row of iOS-specific shortcuts and commands. You can go back to your Home screen, search your iPad Pro or the web, adjust the brightness, and control audio from the keyboard without having to tap on the iPad at all. Credit: Sarah Jacobsson Purewal Amber Watchcase Power Bank \nBecause the Apple Watch can only be charged with the magnetic charging puck, a lot of Apple Watch wearers find themselves bringing the two-meter-long charging cable whenever they travel. \nThankfully, the Amber Watchcase Power Bank by ClearGrass ($99, available on Amazon ) offers a stylish solution. This portable battery has enough juice to recharge the Apple Watch up to seven times, and it’s smart enough to stop charging once the Watch is at 100 percent. In addition to a microUSB port for charging the internal battery, Amber has an extra USB port so you can also use it to charge your iPhone simultaneously. \nAmber is made from anodized aluminum and plastic, and comes in four colors to match your Watch (silver, gold, rose gold, and space gray).

      "text": "CUPERTINO (REUTERS) - Recently released drone video shows the new campus of Apple Inc. located in Cupertino, California.\nIn a brochure mailed out to local residents in 2012, Apple said the new 176-acre campus would include wooded walking areas, restaurants and a 100,000 square foot fitness center.\nOn the company's website, Apple says it expects to move in around 12,000 of its employees when the project is complete in early 2017.\nThe campus will become the company's new headquarters and is located about one mile east of its current headquarters in Cupertino. The website also says the facility will run on 100 per cent renewable energy.\nApple bought most of the land for the campus from Hewlett Packard, where late Apple co-founder Steve Jobs got one of his first summer jobs after calling HP founder Bill Hewlett to ask for spare parts.\nJobs personally showed the architectural plans for the new campus to the Cupertino city council in 2011, despite being ill at the time.\n\"It's a little like a spaceship landed,\" Jobs had said of the circular building with its massive interior courtyard.\nThe main building spans 2.8 million square feet and is more than four stories high. There is also an underground 1000-seat auditorium.\nTopics:  APPLE CALIFORNIA More Share Tweet Linkedin Pin Google+ Reddit Print Permalink: http://str.sg/4QQr Copy",

      "text": "By Ric Cowley , News Editor \nApple sold 100,000 iPhones in just three days in India following the country's demonetisation of some of its high-denomination notes. \nBoth Rs 500 and Rs 1000 notes were demonetised on November 8th 2016. People rushed out to purchase high-value items like gold and technology to make up for their loss of legal tender. \nThe sudden influx of iPhone sales means that Apple is the only manufacturer to hit sales targets for November. Sales of its handsets are estimated to have grown 20-30% during the month. \nSupply & demand \nStores quickly sold out of the devices and began charging a premium for them as demand grew. Shop owners back-dated the receipts to bypass the demonetisation of the notes. \nThe smartphone market in India is expected to shrink by 10% for the last quarter following the demonetisation.",

Other reports claim battery life suddenly drops from 30 percent to zero within seconds, and while unplugging the phone when it shows 100 percent the juice drops below the 50 percent mark. Going by this 16-page long Apple Forums thread, the iPhone 5s, iPhone 6s, iPhone 6s Plus, iPhone 6, and even the iPhone 7 have been all been affected by the upgrade.\nMeanwhile, Twitter users haven’t been shy in coming forward about the issue:\n*unplugs 100% charged iphone*\n*slides to unlock*\nbattery 43%\n— Deejay (@DeejayCombs) November 26, 2016 \n\nThanks to this iOS update, I can now watch my battery literally drain as I read a text\n— varun (@VarunBottle) November 25, 2016 \n\nWhen you update to iOS 10.1.1 and your phone gets really hot and your batter keeps draining in less than 1 hour… #iphone #apple #battery \n— Tanya Magit (@tanya_magit) November 23, 2016 \n\nAnyone else notice their iPhone 6 battery only lasts like 20 minutes with the latest iOS update?\n— Tom Fulp (@TomFulp) November 26, 2016 \n\nJust last week, Apple announced it would replace faulty iPhone 6s handsets with shutdown issues free of charge. What course of action they will take for this bug remains to be seen.\nAre you experiencing iOS 10.1.1 issues?

Still, you'll take the usual minor improvements as a bonus, and maybe even a couple of nifty new features. But according to PCMag , Apple's latest iOS update (that's 10.1.1) will give you much more than the \"stability improvements and bug fixes\" it claims in the description. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below As Mashable also indicates, Apple's support forum is harbouring a discussion about the battery issue, with many users stating their iPhone 6 and iPhone 5S won't make it a full day without charging. Others, meanwhile, report the phone shutting down with around half of its charge left. GIF © Fox This isn't exactly mind-blowing, mind, with many customers around the world likely able to point to similar battery issues — even those troubles aren't necessarily related to software. Some people who opted into Apple's open beta program report that tracking back to version 10.1.1 (the beta program is already onto 10.2) solves the problem, though this is obviously only mildly relevant to the average customer. Related: iPhone 8 release date, rumours, news, specs and price One user on the Apple support forum also noted how this tactic is inconsistent: \"Don't waste your time on rolling back to 10.1. I unfortunately confirmed faysal22's comment that 10.1 does not work. My phone is lasting about 3 hours now. Instead of the battery shutting down at 70%, it is now shutting down at 85%.\" Of course, as we know from Samsung's whole Galaxy Note 7 fiasco , pinning down what exactly causes a battery issue is a tough game. While it appears likely this particular incident is software-related, it could also be due to battery damage, overheating or a Lightning port clog. Either way, Apple should be hot on the heels of any issue relating to battery, so try and forge on with your daily life if you happen to be affected while they work on a fix.

      "text": "Apple's next iPhones with OLED screens could hit the market in 2017 View   \nThe rumoured OLED-screened iPhone models could launch as early as next year, according to the Wall Street Journal . \nIt reports that manufacturers have been asked by Apple to increase production of the screens and submit prototypes of higher-resolution screens than the ones currently used by Samsung's Galaxy S7 Edge. \nThe company is said to be relying on Samsung for its initial run of OLED screens. Screen manufacturers LG Display, Japan Display and Sharp are expected to have supplies ready for 2018. \nOLED screens are thinner and lighter than the iPhone's current screens, and don't require a backlight to use. A new iPhone using the screen could help Apple's flagging sales. \nWill they, won't they \nHowever, OLED screens are estimated to cost $50 more to produce than the current screens. This would lead to increased prices for the iPhone itself. \nIt is also possible that Apple will run with a different model entirely. It is said to have 10 prototypes for its next iPhone already in development. \nThe report backs up claims made by Sharp President Jeng-wu Tai that Apple was looking to use OLED screens. \nThe manufacturer was said to be in the process of increasing OLED production at the start of November 2016.

      "text": "Sydney: Apple Inc scored a victory in the global battle to control the future of mobile payment technology after the Australian competition regulator refused to grant a group of local banks permission to negotiate collectively over the introduction of Apple Pay.\nThe Australian Competition and Consumer Commission said on Tuesday in a draft ruling it was “not satisfied” that the likely benefits from allowing the banks to negotiate with Apple as a bloc outweighed the negatives. Allowing collective negotiations “could reduce competition between the banks in the supply of mobile payment services for iPhones,” the regulator said.\nAustralian banks had been seeking to strengthen their negotiating position in talks with Apple amid concerns that it the widespread use of contactless payment cards in Australia will allow the US company to quickly grab a large share of the mobile payments market.\nApple’s technology bars any app apart from its own from using the functionality of the iPhone’s near-field communications antenna, the technology which makes payments on contactless readers possible. It wants banks to permit customers to upload their credit cards into its proprietary digital wallet.\nCommonwealth Bank of Australia, National Bank of Australia Ltd, Westpac Banking Corp and Bendigo & Adelaide Bank Ltd had applied to the ACCC for the right to negotiate as a bloc with the iPhone maker, citing a “significant disparity in bargaining power.” \nMobile wallets \nWith the country’s largest transport network set to start trials of a system where passengers can pay with mobile wallets, and government agencies starting to introduce digital versions of concession cards, the banks expect mobile wallet adoption to surge. Having invested heavily in recent years in their own mobile apps and point of sales technology, they are concerned about the prospect of being locked out of a growth market by third-party offerings.\nAn Apple spokesman welcomed the ACCC decision. “We believe today’s draft decision is great for Australians and we look forward to continuing to work with individual banks in Australia and around the world to bring Apple Pay to their customers,” the spokesman said.\nIn their submissions to the regulator, the consortium warned that the rapid adoption of mobile wallets in Australia meant that it was “increasingly likely” that without authorisation to negotiate collectively, individual issuers would be “forced to accept terms and conditions that will limit competition, innovation and investment, efficiency and transparency in mobile wallets and mobile payments.”",

      "text": "Thinnest-ever Apple MacBook hands-on \nApple’s iPhones and iPads remain the best mobile devices available, and iOS remains the best mobile operating system. All are sophisticated, with many layers of technologies that provide the most cohesive ecosystem of functionality on the market today. Macs remain stylish and high-quality, and they make for great complements to Apple’s mobile gear. \nSo why are so many people glum or at least unenthusiastic about Apple? Every Apple fan I meet expresses frustration, concern, and puzzlement on the new Apple products—I now rarely hear the wonder and excitement we have long associated with Apple fans. People fret about ports and dongles, and they wonder why anyone invented haptic buttons and the Touch Bar. They start looking at yesteryear’s models when the new ones come out. And they don’t crow about what cool things they can now do. [ iPad Pro vs. Surface Pro vs. Pixel C vs. Galaxy TabPro S : The “tabtop” tablet/laptop hybrids compared. | Get deep into Windows: Subscribe to the InfoWorld Windows Report newsletter . ] \nFor several years, Apple has slowed down its pace of mobile innovation, making each new iPhone or iPad model less compelling an upgrade. The iPhone 6s’s 3D Touch is hardly anything to get excited about, for example. There’s also been no meaningful Mac innovation for several years, though 2014’s OS X Yosemite introduced interesting developments in MacOS. \nWorse, this year’s iPhone 7 became controversial for removing its audio port, requiring people buy adapters and eliminating their ability to charge their iPhone while listening to music, watching videos, and in some cases making calls. To add insult to injury, the wireless earbuds promised to make the end of the audio jack OK have been delayed indefinitely—suggesting something is very wrong in their design or manufacture. \nThe “innovations” in the iPhone 7 were water resistance, long available in competing high-end Android models, and the usual set of thinner size, faster processing, and higher-quality display. That’s not the stuff that keeps fans happy. \nIt’s even worse for the iPad, which hasn’t seen a new model this year, but a smaller version of last year’s iPad Pro , a tablet that outside of artists and architects hasn’t resonated. It seemed like a knee-jerk response to Microsoft’s Surface Pro . Adding a detachable keyboard to an iPad is hardly an innovation. \nThe Apple Watch is the best smartwatch you can buy, but it’s an unnecessary device for most people. The latest WatchOS update makes it easier to use, but most people I know who have one don’t really know why they have one. \niOS has many subtle improvements , like knowing where you parked your car, but it also has awkward UI changes that make some operations harder . Misfires such as the new MacBook Pro and its bizarre Touch Bar only add to the feeling that something is amiss at Apple, especially when the new MacBook Pros switched to USB-C a month after the iPhone 7 came out still using Lightning connectors and USB-A cables. Do the mobile and computer groups at Apple not coordinate any longer? \nThus, the takeaway for users is not that the Apple has the best products but that it’s stumbling. The Apple hype machine still treats every little thing as amazing and revolutionary. But we all know it’s not, and the extreme hype has become pathetic, no longer an endearing reminder of Steve Jobs, who at least delivered on those terms. That extreme hype also corrodes the sentiments of Apple users. \nIn the meantime, the Android competition has gotten better—ironically by focusing on Apple-quality hardware and making the Android OS much more capable and sophisticated. Apple still leads, but the gap is closing. \nApple’s biggest advantage is now its ecosystem—the ability for Apple products to work together easily. Much of the recent ecosystem improvements leverage the Handoff technologies that let you answer an iPhone call on your Mac, send a text via your iPhone’s SMS from your iPad, copy text between your Mac and iOS devices, and share files with nearby users. But many people don’t understand or use these services, which require total commitment to an Apple hardware universe. For those who do understand and use them, the improvements are subtle—again, no jaw-droppers here. \nWorse, that ecosystem is also showing cracks. The relationship between iOS devices and iTunes confuses most users, and the multiple updates to iTunes have done nothing to change that. The parallel universes of iTunes and iCloud for backup makes no sense, especially as Apple infuses iCloud into more aspects of its devices. iCloud syncing of bookmarks, mail rules, Wi-Fi connections, and so on is handy, but it often breaks down, creating weird cascades of old settings reappearing or existing settings separating based on the device you’re using. And Apple’s fit in the cloud and streaming worlds—from iTunes to iWork, from iCloud Drive to HomeKit, from Apple TV to News—is simply awkward and directionally unclear. \nThen there’s Apple retreat from its hardware ecosystem, with the end of its displays and Wi-Fi routers. Apple has let these once-advanced products languish, but there’s still nothing else that does what made them special: the built-in multiport dock of the Thunderbolt Display and the easy network linking and management of the AirPort Extreme. Apple still makes keyboards, trackpads, and mice, but it raised their prices significantly this year. Of course, in one hardware area, Apple is not retreating: Apple makes dongles— lots of dongles . \nApple should evolve, but it’s far from clear that it has a good plan for that evolution. That’s the big fear among among Apple fans. Today, they’re seeing a mix of confused, ad hoc minor changes, table-stakes changes like speed improvements, and no change on both the hardware and services ends. \nIn other words, Apple’s polish is wearing thin in spots, at the same time its key products seem to have lost momentum and direction and its executives seem to have retreated to a fantasy world. \nYou know the expression “Democracy is the worst form of government except for all the rest”? I fear Apple users are beginning to view Apple products the same way: Apple products are the worst computing devices except for all the rest. We’re not there yet, but boy does it feel like the drowning Apple of the late 1990s all over again. \nEven if it avoids a repeat of that near-death experience, Apple risks being the best but inspiring no passion. For most people, there’s little joy in getting a new iPhone 7, iPad Pro, or Apple Watch. They’re pretty much like the ones they replaced. \nIf the joy is gone, can Apple bring it back? I don’t know. Maybe mobile devices are now like PCs, which at best can improve in their specs and cosmetics but fundamentally are what they’ll ever be. There’s no joy in that, even if they do the job perfectly. I hope there’s more joy possible, but I’m losing hope. And I’m hardly alone. To   Related:",

      "title": "Apple, Starbucks and Tiffany & Co get their Tin supply from a rebel army-held Myanmar mine",
      "text": "From a remote corner of northeastern Myanmar, an insurgent army sells tin ore to suppliers of some of the world’s largest consumer companies. More than 500 companies, including leading brands such as smartphone maker Apple, coffee giant Starbucks and luxury jeweller Tiffany & Co, list among their suppliers Chinese-controlled firms that indirectly buy ore from the Man Maw mine near Myanmar’s border with China, a Reuters examination of the supply chain found.\nThe mine is controlled by the United Wa State Army (UWSA), which the United States placed under sanctions for alleged narcotics trafficking in 2003. The seven companies extracting tin from the mine are all owned or controlled by Wa military and government leaders, Wa officials and people with close ties to UWSA leadership told Reuters.\nThis potentially puts companies, which also include industrial conglomerate General Electric, at risk of violating sanctions that forbid “direct or indirect” dealings with blacklisted groups, according to a former and a serving U.S. official and lawyers with expertise in sanctions enforcement. Several sanctions experts said the U.S. government was unlikely to fine companies who unwittingly used the Myanmar tin. Still, it may force them to shift to new suppliers, they said. A Treasury Department spokeswoman said U.S. sanctions “generally prohibit U.S. companies from engaging in any direct or indirect transactions or dealings with individuals or entities” on a blacklist, but declined further comment on specific circumstances.\nThe situation illustrates the difficulties facing multinationals in monitoring supply chains that have grown increasingly complex. Following a 2012 U.S. regulation, companies have spent billions of dollars scrutinizing whether certain minerals used in their products come from mines controlled by armed groups in Central Africa.\nBut the regulations do not require them to assess the origins of minerals from other conflict zones. Apple, Tiffany and GE, and other companies contacted by Reuters, said that to fulfil those regulations they looked to an audit programme designed by the industry group Conflict Free Sourcing Initiative (CFSI).\nA CFSI programme director said the group was “aware of tin exports from Myanmar to other countries and of security and human rights issues in Myanmar”. The group said it was updating its audit requirements to include “a broader definition of conflict-affected and high-risk areas”. Tin supply chain expert at monitoring group Global Witness, Sophia Pickles, said companies must not wholly outsource due diligence responsibility to a scheme that has exclusively focused on central Africa.\n“Companies, not schemes, bear the primary responsibility for ensuring that supply chains are responsible,” she said.\nCivil War \nMost of the tin mined globally is used as solder in electronics, for making batteries and plating. The Man Maw mine roiled the global tin market when huge quantities of high grade ore were discovered around 2013. Annual production is now estimated at about 33,000 tons of tin concentrate, more than a 10th of global output of the metal.\nThe mine is controlled by the UWSA, the strongest of the myriad armed groups that have kept Myanmar in a state of near-perpetual civil war for decades. Reuters visited the remote mine last month, the first international media organisation to do so. Interviews with officials running the mine, UWSA leaders and executives at Asian tin suppliers, together with an examination of public disclosures of suppliers made by companies in regulatory filings, indicate Wa tin likely ends up in an array of products made by U.S. and other international companies.\nTin from Man Maw provides revenue critical to the survival of the self-proclaimed Wa State and its rulers, who have refused to disarm or participate in Myanmar’s peace process. “There are dozens of trucks carrying tin ore to China every morning,” the head of the Wa territory foreign affairs office, Zhao Guo An, told Reuters. “Tin mining is the pillar of our economy. It’s the biggest source of income.”\nWhile Washington has lifted most sanctions on Myanmar, some have been kept in place, including those aimed at the UWSA. The group and several of its leaders are blacklisted under the Kingpin Act over accusations of trafficking in heroin and methamphetamine. UWSA leaders deny involvement in narcotics, saying the accusations are a smear by political opponents.\nPeter Kucik, a former senior sanctions advisor at the U.S. Treasury Department, said the findings highlighted the need for thorough due diligence. “The facts suggest potential sanctions risk for the parties involved,” Kucik said. Two companies in Apple’s supply chain, the world’s No. 1 tin producer Yunnan Tin Co Ltd and leading Taiwan-based solder maker Shenmao Technology, told Reuters that some tin they bought was from the Wa mine.\nMandy Gan, a tin analyst from China’s leading mineral research company, Asian Metal, and another tin expert, both of whom visited the UWSA mine this year, said many other Chinese smelting firms supplying global consumer goods makers also bought tin from the Man Maw mine.\nSanctions experts said even the indirect use of the tin might be considered a violation of U.S. sanctions law, which does not require authorities to prove intent. A U.S. government official involved in Myanmar policy consulted on Reuters’ findings said the government was likely to investigate any ties to the UWSA.\nStill, Washington-based sanctions attorney Erich Ferrari said it was unlikely the Treasury Department would initiate an enforcement action against companies for an issue so deep in the supply chain. Once the ties were publicized, however, authorities could impose penalties if the companies did not wind down the transactions and find new suppliers, he said.\nSupply Chain \nThe chain connecting some of the world’s best known brands with a mine in one the most inaccessible corners of Southeast Asia has many links. One key intermediary is state-owned Yunnan Cultural Industry International (YCII), based in Yunnan, southwestern China, which said in a statement on its website that it enjoys “a long-term, stable strategic partnership” with the UWSA statelet.\nYCII declined several interview requests. YCII is, in turn, a major supplier of tin to the world’s top producer, Yunnan Tin, also based in Yunnan. Yunnan Tin supplies many companies, including big contract manufacturers such as Foxconn Technology Co and, indirectly, Pegatron Corp, whose clients include Apple. It also supplies major solder makers such as Shenmao Technology, also a supplier to Pegatron.\n“Myanmar is not considered a conflict-affected area by CFSI…As long as smelters present a certified sourcing document, that’s acceptable for us,” said Tim Lin, an executive overseeing sourcing at Taiwan-based Shenmao, who said about a quarter of its supply of the metal came from Yunnan Tin.\nIn the last two years, Yunnan Tin has also shipped more than 12,000 tons of metal to the United States, according to shipment data from U.S.-based trade tracking company Panjiva. More than 500 publicly traded companies in the United States say their suppliers use tin from Yunnan Tin or Yuntinic Resources, its San Mateo, California-based division, according to a review of the supply chain disclosures consumer companies make to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.\nTwo members of Yunnan Tin’s board, vice chairwoman Yang Yimin and secretary and vice general manager Pan Wenhao, confirmed in interviews that a “portion” of the company’s tin came from the UWSA-operated mine. “We certainly buy tin indirectly from Myanmar,” Pan told Reuters. “We don’t specifically pay attention to where they source their materials from.”\nYunnan Tin mixes the Wa tin with metal from mines in central and southwestern China, said Pan, before processing it into products such as tin paste. That means it is impossible to say for certain which shipments from the company contain Wa tin, but Pan estimated Yunnan Tin’s purchases from the mine account for about a third of its total annual tin consumption, or at least 16,500 tons.\nApple said in a statement it worked with suppliers to help them meet stringent standards, “and those who are ultimately unable or unwilling to comply are removed from our supply chain”. “While we have no evidence of illegal tin from Myanmar in our products, we’ll continue to investigate, address any issues we find and do all we can to raise standards and protect human rights,” it said. Foxconn said it “enforced stringent supplier management requirements in accordance with international and local conflict minerals legislation and has proactively communicated these requirements to our suppliers”.\nIt added that less than 1 percent of its tin was procured from Yunnan Tin, all of which was used in products for a “single, non-U.S.-based customer”. Pegatron Corp said it carried out “annual due diligence on suppliers and encourage them to source from validated conflict-free supply chains”. “Pegatron will continue working with customers and international organizations to investigate and source minerals responsibly,” the company added.\nFrom Jewellery to appliances \nCompanies that sell consumer products in the United States are required by the Dodd-Frank Act to publish their suppliers of tin and other minerals. Among the companies listing Yunnan Tin, Tiffany said one of its suppliers had indirectly sourced a “very small amount of tin” from the Chinese smelter for use in silver solder for jewellery and hollowware. The company added that, as Yunnan Tin was certified as conflict-free by the CFSI, “use of this smelter by our vendors is consistent with our Conflict Minerals Policy”.\nStarbucks said small amounts of Yunnan Tin metal, sourced from second or third party suppliers, went into the ovens in its coffee shops. The company had received no information indicating it was using minerals from Myanmar, a spokeswoman said, but was pushing suppliers for more detailed sourcing disclosures. A GE spokesman said the company strived to use ethical sourcing in its mineral supply chain, adding it had “noted the concerns raised by Reuters and will address them through our internal process and with our external partners”. A spokeswoman from discount retailer Target said in a statement it was “committed to responsible business conduct”. “We take these allegations very seriously, and we are looking into this,” the statement said.\nReuters \nThe post Apple, Starbucks and Tiffany & Co get their Tin supply from a rebel army-held Myanmar mine appeared first on Tech2 .",

      "text": "Posted By: Arash Fekri   Technology Page 1 of 2 1 2 » \nAfter being in the market for two months, a critic has turned in his review of the Apple Watch Series 2. While many are saying that the latest iteration to the smart wearable looks almost exactly like the first Apple Watch, he said that the Apple Watch Series 2 is perceptibly heavier. \nThe Apple Watch weighs approximately 25 grams whereas the Apple Watch Series 2 has a weight of 28.2 grams. In addition, the 42-mm stainless steel variant of the Apple Watch weighs 50 grams while the same version of the Apple Watch Series 2 is 52.4 grams, details Wired. \nThe Apple Watch Series 2 is also clearly thicker than its predecessor. The Apple Watch has a depth of 10.5 mm while the Apple Watch Series 2 has a thickness of 11.4 mm. A new ceramic version of the Apple Watch Series 2 is even thicker by 0.4 mm. \nOverall, the critic says that the Apple Watch Series 2 is arguably bigger than the first iteration of the Apple Watch launched in March last year. \nMore space means more alteration \nBecause of the bigger size, the Apple Watch Series 2 also provided more space for its hardware underneath, which also means more alteration. \nPossibly the most significant design alteration is that the Apple Watch Series 2 is water resistant. It has an impressive water depth of up to 50 meters. \nThe wearable’s IP67 rating is perhaps most impressive when the user considers the watch’s new speaker. Unlike the original Apple Watch speaker, which floods when underwater, the new version is designed to fill with water, then it vibrates to expel the excess water from the body. \nSuch ability, coupled with the automatic display shutoff so droplets don’t accidentally select screen options, that means the user can happily swim with his smartwatch without messing up the internal circuitry. \nApart from the waterproofing, the fact the stainless steel and ceramic cases get a sapphire crystal screen and the display is now twice as bright, the big news, of course, is the addition of GPS in the Apple Watch Series 2. \nThis means that the Apple Watch Series 2 can plot the user location without the need to slave to an iPhone. This means the user does not need to take his phone on runs, and it means the watch can plot also his open water swims. \nIn order for Apple to speed up the time for the initial GPS acquisition on the Apple Watch Series 2, Wi-Fi is used to get location data so the user iPhone knows approximately where he is. This is then fed to the watch so it doesn’t have to start from scratch once it is separated from the phone. \nA legitimate fitness tracker \nThe Apple Watch Series 2 has been improved in nearly every way and is finally an all-in-one legitimate fitness tracker with the addition of GPS and water resistance. \nThis focus on pimping the fitness functionality coupled with the improved OS has made it a formidable wearable. \nNot only is the Apple Watch a fashion accessory, it has actually improved productivity and the social life of its users. So an upgrade to the Apple Watch Series 2 for many has been well worth it. \nAside from a longer battery life, the Apple Watch Series 2 also has twice the brightness for its display screen when compared to the Apple Watch, notes CIO. \nThe American tech giant has turned its Apple Watch Series 2 into a serious fitness tracker after learning that the Apple Watch, which it released in April last year, was primarily being used by consumers for self-betterment of their health. \nWhile the Apple Watch Series 2 remains a smartwatch in nature, Apple has utilized modern technology to turn it into a fitness device to serve as the consumers’ alternative for Fitbits, Jawbones, Garmins, Polars, and smart scales. \nApple learned that people will be shelling out money to pay for technology that promises an ironic escape from technology, even if it is only for 30-minute sweaty increments of time.

      "text": "Amazon Working On Premium Echo Speaker With Touchscreen To ‘Fend Off Competition from Google and Apple’ Posted by Rajesh Pandey on Nov 29, 2016 | No Comments tweet \nAmazon currently dominates the smart speaker system with its Echo smart speaker, but the company is not sitting on its laurels. Bloomberg reports that Amazon is working a premium version of its Echo speaker that will come with a seven-inch touchscreen. The e-commerce giant is taking this move to “fend off competition from Google and Apple.” \nNone of Amazon’s current Alexa-powered Echo offerings come with a built-in touchscreen. The touchscreen on the premium speaker will make it easier to view information like weather, calendar appointments, and news. \nThe new device will have a touchscreen measuring about seven inches, a major departure from Amazon’s existing cylindrical home devices that are controlled and respond mostly through the company’s voice-based Alexa digital assistant, according to two people familiar with the matter. This will make it easier to access content such as weather forecasts, calendar appointments, and news, the people said. \nThe speaker will be larger than Echo and will tilt upwards so that the screen will be visible when the device is kept on a table. The high-grade speakers will also be a step up from the speaker that Amazon currently uses in its Echo devices. Amazon is expected to unveil its latest Echo offering in the first quarter of 2017. The device will be running a lighter and modified version of Amazon’s Fire OS. It will likely come with features like the ability to pin notes and photos on the touchscreen. \nWhile Apple has not released a product like Alexa, the company is reportedly working on an Echo-like smart home device that recently entered into prototype testing phase.",

For the first time, both the new iPhone and Galaxy S models will come with OLED displays that incorporate fingerprint scanners and other sensors. Curved screens are reportedly in the works for both devices, and so are dual-lens rear cameras.\nBut what about the selfies cameras?

By: FE Online | Published: November 29, 2016 6:31 PM The Wall Street Journal points out that Apple has asked its suppliers to speed up the production of OLED and provide better OLED screens than that of Samsung. (Reuters) \nThe next Apple iPhone to be launched in 2017, the iPhone 8 might sport an OLED curved display. According to a report by the Wall Street Journal, Apple is speculated to be changing the design and the specifications of the iPhone 8 drastically. While rumours such as these have been in the air for a while now, it was reported a few weeks ago that Apple might just ditch the LCD panel for an OLED display. \nThe Wall Street Journal points out that the Cupertino tech giant has asked its suppliers to speed up the production of OLED and provide better OLED screens than that of Samsung. The report states that since the OLED displays are a lot more expensive, the already high priced iPhones might also carry a much higher price tag. Apple is reported to be testing more than 10 prototypes of the iPhone 8. The report states that while Apple will need Samsung for the OLED screen, it also wants the LG, Japan and Sharp displays to ramp up the production. \nThe report further suggests that the new iPhone 8 is expected to feature the introduction of wireless charging. Ming-Chi Kuo of the KGI Securities speculates that the iPhone 8 users would be able to charge their phones in a manner similar to that of Apple watches, which would also provide faster charging speeds. Kuo also says that the iPhone 8 would come in bezel-less OLED version and there could be a 5.8 version as the new flagship device. Apple is also reported to create the OIS feature standard in both the wide-angle lens and telephoto lens for the new iPhone 8.  ",

      "text": "Australian officials to deny permission for several banks to bargain on Apple Pay Australian officials to deny permission for several banks to bargain on Apple Pay Posted: Tags : Apple - Apple + The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) serves as a competition regulator in the country. Therefore, it's up to it to make sure that consumers are safe from monopoly. Also, it's about to deny permission for several Australian banks to boycott Apple Pay.The banks in question are Commonwealth Bank of Australia, Westpac Banking Corp, National Australia Bank Ltd and Bendigo and Adelaide Bank Ltd. Their common goal is to gain access to the iPhone's NFC chip and develop their own mobile payment platforms, independent from Apple Pay. If the aforementioned banks manage to convince the ACCC that they're in the right, they can boycott Apple Pay for a period of up to three years as a negotiation tactic, according to Australian law.On the other hand, Apple is doing its best to stop that, claiming that allowing third-party access to the iPhone's digital wallet system would be a serious security concern for the end-user.The banks have some more time to present a good case to the ACCC and get the legal bargaining cartel formed. The Commission will be issuing its final decision in March, 2017. A representative for the group said for Reuters that they will continue to argue their case with the ACCC, as otherwise there would be effectively no competition against Apple for mobile payments on the iPhone.

      "text": "All-new OLED 'iPhone 8,' glass-backed 4.7\" model expected to drive Apple sales to 'unprecedented' highs By Tuesday, November 29, 2016, 05:38 am PT (08:38 am ET) iPhone sales in the second half of 2017 could reach a massive 150 million units, as Apple suppliers are gearing up for a massive upgrade cycle set to outperform the iPhone 6 series, based on pent-up demand for new designs and new technology, like wireless charging. Concept rendering of next-gen iPhone with edge-to-edge display. Upstream iPhone suppliers are preparing to ramp up production to between 120 million and 150 million units in the second half of Apple's fiscal year 2017, analyst Ming-Chi Kuo of KGI Securities revealed on Tuesday in a note to investors, a copy of which was obtained by AppleInsider . If those numbers hold, that could blow past the previous peak of between 110 million to 120 million that suppliers prepared for at the launch of the iPhone 6, which remains Apple's best-selling handset ever. In Kuo's view, a combination of factors suggest Apple's 2017 upgrades will lead to \"unprecedented replacement demand,\" led by a new high-end OLED model that is expected to feature an all-new design and \"notably superior specifications\" from a pair of new models with LCD screens. Kuo also has high hopes for the new 4.7-inch model with LCD, however, predicting that the addition of a glass back and wireless charging will make it the company's new mid-range handset , appealing to a wide swath of consumers. But the jumbo-sized 5.5-inch iPhone Plus series is predicted to be cannibalized by the new flagship OLED model, which is said to feature a screen size measuring somewhere around 5.1 or 5.2 inches in diameter. \"iPhone 8\" concept by Veniamin Geskin. Earlier this month, Kuo indicated that both the 5.5-inch Plus and slightly smaller OLED \"iPhone 8\" will feature dual-camera systems . But it is not expected that the 2017 4.7-inch \"iPhone 7s\" will gain a second camera, as was introduced on the iPhone 7 Plus. The flagship OLED iPhone is believed to celebrate the 10th anniversary of Apple's revolutionary handset. Reports have suggested the design shakeup will enable Apple to embed key features —including the FaceTime camera, earpiece and Touch ID fingerprint sensor— beneath the display, boasting a truly seamless edge-to-edge design. Kuo has an extremely strong track record in predicting Apple's future product plans. He accurately weighed in on the 3 gigabytes of RAM in the iPhone 7 Plus A10 processor in November of 2015 , followed up with details on Apple's new dual-camera system for the iPhone 7 Plus in January of 2016 , and also nailed the details of the second-generation Apple Watch in April . He was also the first to reveal that Apple's new MacBook Pro models would feature an OLED Touch Bar and Touch ID and would launch in the fourth quarter of this year, and he also correctly forecast that a new entry-level 13-inch MacBook Pro would replace the outgoing MacBook Air.

      "text": "The Wall Street Journal points out that Apple has asked its suppliers to speed up the production of OLED and provide better OLED screens than that of Samsung. (Reuters) The next Apple iPhone to be launched in 2017, the iPhone 8 might sport an OLED curved display. According to a report by the Wall Street Journal, Apple is speculated to be changing the design and the specifications of the iPhone 8 drastically. While rumours such as these have been in the air for a while now, it was reported a few weeks ago that Apple might just ditch the LCD panel for an OLED display.\nThe Wall Street Journal points out that the Cupertino tech giant has asked its suppliers to speed up the production of OLED and provide better OLED screens than that of Samsung. The report states that since the OLED displays are a lot more expensive, the already high priced iPhones might also carry a much higher price tag. Apple is reported to be testing more than 10 prototypes of the iPhone 8. The report states that while Apple will need Samsung for the OLED screen, it also wants the LG, Japan and Sharp displays to ramp up the production.\nThe report further suggests that the new iPhone 8 is expected to feature the introduction of wireless charging. Ming-Chi Kuo of the KGI Securities speculates that the iPhone 8 users would be able to charge their phones in a manner similar to that of Apple watches, which would also provide faster charging speeds. Kuo also says that the iPhone 8 would come in bezel-less OLED version and there could be a 5.8 version as the new flagship device. Apple is also reported to create the OIS feature standard in both the wide-angle lens and telephoto lens for the new iPhone 8.",

      "text": "Apple's new $5 billion campus is almost completed, as depicted in a new drone video by photographer Matthew Roberts released on Tuesday.\nThere is only one crane left working on the building. And Apple's legendary mountain of dirt has been drastically reduced, with the earth being spread around the campus for landscaping.\nApple CEO Tim Cook told employees earlier this year that Apple planned to move the first groups into the new \"Spaceship\" campus in January 2017.\nBut the City of Cupertino, where the building will be located, announced last month that the project's completion date had been pushed back to the second quarter of 2017.\nAnd Cupertino's engineering inspector, 4Leaf, told the city in September that it believed the project was behind schedule and prepared its own budget through June 2017, according to a document seen by Business Insider. \n\"Although we haven’t been formally notified, we understand that the AC2 project is behind its anticipated 31-month construction schedule,\" 4Leaf wrote. \nBut whether the official move-in date gets pushed back a month or two won't matter to this campus in the long run, which is an excellent symbol of Apple's massive success over the past decade.\nCheck out the video below:\nYoutube Embed:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/embed/Qh_9_1FX0Yk\nWidth: 1280px\nHeight: 720px \nHere's what the building will look like when it's finished:\nYouTube/Matthew Roberts \nNOW WATCH: What those tiny rivets on your jeans are for \n",

      "title": "How to See if Your iPhone 6s is Eligible for Battery Replacement",
      "text": "As we reported last week , Apple is starting a battery replacement program to fix a bug that's causing certain iPhone 6s models to randomly shutdown due to faulty batteries. Now, we've learned that you can check whether or not your iPhone qualifies for this new battery program, though simply checking your serial number won't be enough. \n\nImage: Samuel C. Rutherford / Tom's Guide Yesterday (Nov. 28), 9to5Mac reported that you can check the characters in the \"4th and 5th\" position match an item in a list below to see if your iPhone 6s qualifies. The lack of a source for this information, though, gave me doubt, so I reached out to Apple Support and an agent told me that you can't check it yourself. \nMORE: Best Places to Buy and Sell a Used iPhone \nThe agent explained that you'll need to contact Apple Support, which you can do by visiting Apple's Support page . Once you're there select iPhone , select Battery, Power & Charging , select Unexpected shutdown or restart , select No and select a customer support option such as Chat . This way you can read the serial number to an Apple advisor to confirm its eligibility. \nTo prepare your iPhone for the battery replacement, first backup the handset to iTunes or iCloud . Then, disable Find My iPhone by opening Settings , tapping iCloud , tapping Find My iPhone , turning off the switch next to Find My iPhone . Your iPhone will then prompt you to enter your iCloud password and tap OK . \nThe battery replacement program covers \"iPhone 6s batteries for 3 years after the first retail sale of the unit,\" so you don't need to worry about the expiration of your warranty or AppleCare. That being said, using the program won't extend your warranty. \nWhile we bet users would be excited for the chance to solve this wonky problem, Apple notes that the battery malfunction \"is not a safety issue,\" ( see what they did there? ). So don't worry about rushing down to your nearest Apple store (or Authorized Apple Service provider) immediately. \nBefore going to a store for the program, call first and ask about the status of the battery replacement program for that store. It appears that not all stores have the program up and running at the moment, and we've seen reports that some stores have the replacement battery parts on backorder. \nSee Also : Best Big Phones: Top Picks 5.5 Inches or Larger \nSmartphones with the Longest Battery Life The 10 Best Smartphones You Can Buy\nOur Favorite Phones For Taking Photos\nAbout the author Henry T.

      "text": "By Tiernan Ray Here are some things going on today in your world of tech :\nShares of Samsung   ) closed unchanged at 1,677,000 Korean Won after the company said it would increase its shareholders payouts but resisted the appeal of activists Elliott Management to force the company to split itself into two parts, including a holding company, as my colleague Shuli Ren reported. \nThe New York Times ’s Paul Mozur , in his write-up of Samsung’s statements , reads Samsung’s statement, that it remains “absolutely neutral” about a restructuring, as being less forceful, and more amenable, to Elliott.\nResearch firm IDC this morning reports that worldwide smartphone sales will rise 0.6% this year to 1.45 billion units, a huge fall from last year’s 10.4%. Sales of phones with 4G connections, however, are expected to rise 21.3% to 1.17 billion.\nShares of fitness wearables pioneer Fitbit ( FIT ) are up 5 cents, or 0.6%, at $8.45, in pre-market trading after Longbow ’s Joe Wittine, who’s Neutral on the stock, issued a note to clients says the company dominated the best-seller lists during Black Friday , according to a write-up by TheFlyontheWall .\nShares of AT&T ( T ) are up 4 cents at $39.58, after the company yesterday announced “ DirecTV NOW ” will soon be available as a streaming video “ over-the-top ” offering, with approximately 60 channels of television for $35 per month.\nRBC Capital ’s Steven Cahall , who follows the media biz, notes that AT&T hasn’t fully disclosed all channels participating, but CBS ( CBS ) is believed to be a hold-out. Says Cahall, “DTV has launched a potentially great product with NOW, in our view, that leverages having some of the best programming costs in the business due to scale, as we think DTV’s programming costs are some 20-30% below the industry average.”\n“This may force competitor products to come down to DTV’s price point even if their wholesale costs are much higher.”\nApple ( AAPL ) estimates are in the news again, with UBS ’s Steve Milunovich , who has a Buy rating on the stock, and a $127 price target, saying data on how many parts the company is procuring for the iPhone suggest there may be downside to Street estimates for the December and March quarters. Apple shares are down 87 cents at $110.70.\nIn earnings today, integrated enterprise equipment vendor Nutanix ( NTNX ) will report fiscal Q1 results, its first report as a public company, after the closing bell. The Street is, on average, modeling $152.3 million in revenue and a net loss of 44 cents a share.",

      "text": "  Small caps got drilled and helped drag the rest of the market lower on Monday. Amid a relatively quiet news day on the corporate front, the decline underscored a need for U.S. stocks to take a break after three weeks of postelection frenzied buying.\nMeanwhile, Apple ( AAPL ) showed relative strength, as its loss of just 0.2% to 111.57 allowed the No. 1 firm in the Nasdaq in terms of market cap and revenue to hold above a recent 110.33 buy point.\nApple broke out of a cup with handle at 110.33 on Sept. 14, rallied nearly 8%, then retreated to give back all of that decent gain. However, the stock also held up above its 200-day moving average, a good sign for long-term holders.\nThe Russell 2000 slumped 1.3% on Monday, finishing nearly at session lows, after rising 10.2% during the week of Donald Trump's surprising White House victory, then adding another 2.6% and 2.4% in the prior two weeks of trading.\nThe S&P SmallCap 600 fell 1.2%. The S&P 500 dropped 0.5% while the Nasdaq composite and the NYSE composite both slid around 0.6%.\nVolume was sharply higher on Monday vs. Friday's half-day session, according to preliminary data. So technically speaking, the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 both chalked up a distribution day.\nApple continues to be coy with its 50-day moving average, which is near 113. Watch to see if any positive news related to holiday shopping reports will help lift the megacap tech play above this key technical line.\nOn a positive note, Apple's Accumulation/Distribution Rating is currently a C+, according to IBD Stock Checkup . This points to a slight net accumulation over the past 13 weeks by institutional investors.\nAlso, the Street has recently lifted its consensus profit view for fiscal 2017 (up 9% to $9.05 a share) and fiscal 2018 (up 11%). Apple's fiscal year ends in September.\nElsewhere, small-cap IPOs were not immune from the heavy profit taking. Airgain ( AIRG ) slid more than 14% lower to 20 in triple average trade. The micro-cap play ($151 million market value, 4 million share float) is still up 17% past a proper IPO base buy point of 17.04.\nAirgain, which specializes in antenna technology to improve Wi-Fi connections, went public at 8 a share on Aug. 12.\nAlso in the stock market today , gold mining and select utility stocks in the diversified, electric power and water supply areas bucked the decline, gaining 1% to 4% each. Foreign telecom, retail drugstore chain and newspaper stocks also thrived.\nFinisar ( FNSR ) also went against the grain, gapping up at the open and rising 3.7% to 33.97 in the heaviest volume in nearly four weeks. The maker of transmitters and transceivers for fiber optic telecommunications networks moved further past a 31.52 flat-base entry point and is now extended.. Investors generally should not buy a stock more than 5% past the proper entry.\nFinisar got positive comments from two Wall Street equity analysts who expect a strong second quarter in the period ended Oct. 31. Finisar is slated to report results after the market close on Dec. 8. Finisar's Telecom-Fiber Optic industry group has fallen from the top spot in IBD's 197 industry group rankings yet still is squarely within the top 40.\nFinisar has rallied as much as 81% from an earlier breakout in late July; that breakout began in quiet trade, but the stock held above its 50-day moving average. Volume eventually heated up in mid-August.\nThe biggest declines of the day belonged to cement and concrete firms, oil explorers, department store chains and biotechs. All of these industry groups dropped well more than 2.5% for the day.\nOn Tuesday, the market will be watching the revised report on U.S. third-quarter GDP growth. The ADP private sector jobs survey for November comes out early Wednesday.\nRELATED :\nWhy Apple Formed The Bottoming Base, And Why It's Important For Investors \nWhen Did Apple Initially Break Out? \nWhy These Two Analysts Are Upbeat On Finisar's Earnings",

      "text": "It's not good when a report suggests that up to 90 percent of Apple chargers being sold on Amazon are actually fakes. And earlier this year, our sister site Laptop Mag reported on the rash of fake USB Type-C cables and how to buy a safe one .\nAccording to Bloomberg , negotiations with Major League Baseball and the National Football League came to a standstill because of worries about fake products on Amazon. \n\nNow Amazon is finally getting ready to banish counterfeit goods from its stores, according to Bloomberg. The online retailer will reportedly have teams in the United States and Europe building a registry of products from major brands.\nMORE: Is Amazon Prime Worth It? Here's the 15 Top Perks \nThese teams will be in charge of enlisting brands to sign up for the registry, regardless of whether or not those groups sell on Amazon's website.\nThe idea is that anyone selling those brands' goods will have to prove to Amazon that they have permission to sell them. Amazon has reportedly been testing this with Nike and select other labels, but plans to increase this practice dramatically in 2017.\nLast week, CNET reported on a separate Amazon initiative called Brand Central that protects merchants and buyers from fake products, but details were scarce.\nAmazon told Bloomberg it \"has zero tolerance for the sale of counterfeit items on our site,\" but it sounds like we'll have to wait until next year to see what comes of that policy. \nSee Also : 15 Cheap Tech Products That Make Life Easier \nWhat Is Amazon Student?

      "text": "Reddit Apple from time to time updates Siri with new responses to make sure the voice assistant is up to date on pop culture and answering your questions as intelligently as possible. But this is the first we’ve heard of a partnership with a film studio in order to promote a movie release, in this case Universal Pictures’ ‘ The Secret Life of Pets’. To go along with the digital iTunes release of the movie, Apple has added 15 programmed responses to Siri for the question, “What do my Pets do when I’m not at home?”, which is the general plot of the animated film that was first released in theatres back in July. Apple actually made an announcement and video trailer for the feature (below), but it was limited to its iTunes Facebook page where their user following is relatively low. The video includes clips from the movie and also some Apple product placement as the characters interact with iPhones, iPads, and Apple TV. Universal Pictures sent over more info about the partnership, noting that ‘with 15 different programmed responses, this is the first time Apple has collaborated on a home entertainment title and the first time Siri has been programmed to interact with an iTunes movie title.” Here’s a look at the promo video Apple shared on Facebook: \nWhile it might be the company’s first official partnership with a movie tie-in for Siri, Apple has been known to occasionally add new smarts to the voice assistant outside of major iOS releases. Earlier this summer, for example, the company started adding responses related to Pokemon Go questions after the hit iPhone game became a trending pop culture reference. Back in October, Apple responded to criticism about the current state of Siri, saying that it recently fixed some flaws with the feature and that it’s focusing on enhancing common queries.",

      "text": "– A + Israel's Cellcom brings internet TV service to Apple TV By Roger Fingas \nTuesday, November 29, 2016, 06:29 am PT (09:29 am ET) \nMajor Israeli carrier Cellcom is bringing its internet TV service, Cellcom TV, to the fourth-generation Apple TV, in what could potentially be an important sales driver for the set-top.\n\n\n\n\nThe carrier made the announcement on Tuesday alongside launching a new app, Reuters said on Tuesday. Cellcom TV includes a mix of live channels and on-demand content, making it somewhat similar to Sling TV or PlayStation Vue in the U.S.\n\nIt's not clear what unique features the Apple TV app might get, or if it will support tvOS 10.1's single sign-on functions when that update launches next month. Compatibility would allow people with a Cellcom subscription to authenticate once and watch content in multiple apps.\n\nWhile Cellcom TV is a fledgling service with just over 100,000 subscribers, it may be poised to catch up with local cable company Hot and satellite TV provider Yes. Whereas those two firms lost customers in the last quarter, Cellcom actually gained about 12,000, perhaps reflecting global cord-cutting trends.\n\nApple could benefit if it can position the Apple TV as an ideal way of watching Cellcom programming on a big screen. The company already markets the set-top as \"the future of television,\" and in fact tvOS 10.1 will also include a native \"TV\" app making it easier to use an Apple TV as a cable/satellite replacement.",

      "text": "iPads and Beats Headphones Top Best-Selling and Sold-Out Cyber Monday Charts   7:12   Apple's iPad was one of the five best-selling electronic devices on Cyber Monday yesterday , November 28, according to new data acquired by Adobe and published in a press release last night. Every iPad appears to be taken into account in Adobe's data, but it's likely that the newest iPad Pro models helped fuel sales thanks to a handful of discounts from various retailers, particularly on the 9.7-inch iPad Pro. Accompanying the iPad in the best-selling category for Cyber Monday this year were Sony's PlayStation 4, Microsoft's Xbox One, Samsung's line of 4K TVs, and Amazon's Fire tablets. In addition, it was noted that Beats by Dre products -- mainly the company's headphones -- were among the items that were most likely to run out of stock. In total, 2016's online shopping holiday is on track to hit $3.39 billion in estimated spending, which will mark a 10.2 percent increase in comparison to Cyber Monday in 2015. Once all of the numbers come in, this year's Cyber Monday could be \"the largest online sales day in history,\" and it's already surpassed Black Friday spending this year, which sat at $3.34 billion. “Cyber Monday is on track to be the biggest online shopping day ever, surpassing our forecast by almost $27 million or 0.8 percent,” said Tamara Gaffney, principal analyst, Adobe Digital Insights. “This indicates that consumers still had more appetite for online shopping despite the incredible volume of online sales on Black Friday. Prices are expected to start climbing after today as retailers shift attention to extend the season late into December with quick shipping deals and the option to click and collect in store.” Apple didn't participate directly in Cyber Monday deals, but the company did run a Black Friday offer this year that granted customers up to $150 worth of gift cards on specific product purchases. Last year, the company didn't offer Black Friday deals, opting to allow third-party retailers like Best Buy and Target to do so instead. Adobe's full Cyber Monday report can be read here .",

      "text": "Ever since the release of the original Bondi Blue iMac, Apple is a company that has been synonymous with forward-thinking industrial design. In fact, during a period stretching from 1998 to 2012, Apple’s vaunted design team, led dutifully by Jony Ive, managed to churn out a seemingly endless number of iconic products, including a wide range of iPods, industry-leading notebooks, increasingly slick iMac models, and of course new iPhone models on a consistent basis.\nDon’t miss: HTC just unveiled one of the best Android phones of 2016, but you can’t have one \nAll that said, it’s hard to ignore that it’s been a while since we’ve seen some thought-provoking new designs emanate out of Apple. Especially if we take a look at the iPhone, Apple’s primary revenue generator, the company has more or less kept the form factor unchanged since the iPhone 6, a device that was released in 2014. Meanwhile, Android handset makers have managed to churn out quite a few devices that, truth be told, look a lot more slick than Apple’s arguably stale iPhone design.\nNow comes word via Jason Snell, who recently appeared on John Gruber’s “The Talk Show” podcast , that Ive many not be as heavily involved in day-to-day design duties as he once was.\n“I’ve heard that he has lately been checked out or not as directly involved with product design and that he’s been largely focused on architecture,” Snell said. “Meaning the spaceship campus and the new stores. And that maybe the other top-level executive who’s been working the most with Ive is Angela Arhendts.” Ive, of course, is still in the mix at Apple, but perhaps he’s now more interested in other design-related pursuits.\nSteve Jobs speaks to Jony Ive via Facetime at the Apple Worldwide Developers Conference in 2010. Photo: AP Interestingly enough, Snell adds that Ive’s ability to effectively operate unchecked has led to some curious Apple design decisions, such as the hyper-expensive gold Apple Watch (since discontinued) and the company’s ill-fated car design initiative.\nThat said, it’s interesting to note that Apple just released a 400-page book highlighting Apple product designs stretching all the way back to 1998. The book, in effect, is practically an ode to Jony Ive, who didn’t really rise to prominence until the original iMac was released in (surprise surprise) 1998. That said, Snell believes that the release of the book — which in and of itself was an unusual product to come out of Apple — perhaps signals Ive’s lessening interest in coming up with bold new designs, at least in the consumer electronics space.\nTo this point, Gruber speculates that Ive’s leadership within the design team at Apple may only be “spiritual” at this point.\nIncidentally, Ive and fellow designer Marc Newson recently created an “immersive Christmass tree installation” in London.\nLooking ahead, all eyes will be on Apple’s upcoming iPhone 8 design. Rumored to feature a curved OLED display, there’s no doubt that there’s a whole lot of pressure on Apple to release a fresh design to once again reinvigorate interest in the company’s iconic smartphone.\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google WhatsApp Email Copy This article originally appeared on BGR .",

      "text": "Apple is the world’s most valuable company and has a massive cash stash, but some analysts fear a prolonged period of weak innovation has set the company up for a “decade-long malaise.”\niPhone sales are expected to peak with the release of Apple’s 10th anniversary iPhone next year, according to models from Oppenheimer analyst Andrew Uerkwitz, who predicts 245 million iPhones will sell in Apple’s 2018 fiscal year. That would reflect an increase of 9% from the fiscal 2017 FactSet consensus estimate of 225 million, and an increase of more than 15% from the fiscal year that ended in October.\nHowever, Uerkwitz believes next year’s iPhone cycle will present “one last growth hurrah” before consumers begin to drift away from the high prices Apple commands for its smartphones. Apple may struggle to raise iPhone prices meaningfully beyond the next cycle as it deals with fewer hardware breakthroughs and a narrowing performance gap between the iPhone and its closest premium-tier competitors, Uerkwitz wrote.\n“The risks to the company have never been greater,” said Uerkwitz, who has a perform rating on the stock. “We believe Apple is about to embark on a decade-long malaise.”\nFindTheCompany | Graphiq Also read: Share buybacks will return with a vengeance next year \nAnother analyst, Monness Crespi Hardt’s James Cakmak, echoed similar bearish sentiment Monday, warning about changing consumer behavior that has lengthened upgrade cycles, and competitive threats from the likes of Alphabet and Amazon.com in the phone, video-streaming and augmented-reality realms.\n“Apple won’t have it easy again for a while, if ever,” Cakmak said.\nOne issue is an increase in demand for used and refurbished phones. Cakmak warns that Apple’s refurbished-phone program may cannibalize new-device sales, which would further depress average selling prices. Trends tracker IDC said Monday it expects the global used smartphone market to nearly triple from 2015 through 2020 , which could impact original equipment manufacturers and mobile operators like Apple and Samsung.\nLast month, Apple reported its first-ever annual decline in iPhone sales . Its shares have risen 2.3% in the past three months, virtually in line with the Dow Jones Industrial Average, but have underperformed in the past year, falling more than 6% versus a 6% gain for the blue-chip index.\nTim Cook announces the new Apple iPhone 7 during a launch event on Sept. 7, 2016. Photo: Getty Images Despite the bearish calls, the average rating on Apple stock is the equivalent to buy, while the average target of $130 implies 16% growth from Monday’s closing price.\nBullish analysts have more confidence that Apple can maintain a stranglehold on the market for high-price smartphones. Canaccord Genuity’s Michael Walkley, who reiterated a buy rating and $140 price target Monday, said he expects Apple to “extend its leading market share of the premium tier smartphone market,” despite competition from Google’s Pixel phone and other Android phones. Samsung’s disastrous Note 7 recall has also helped this quarter, he said.\nOthers have been bullish on Apple’s reported efforts on smart cars and augmented reality. Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook has been optimistic about AR and has secured a number of acquisitions over the past two years to help accelerate those plans. While Cakmak said Apple is trailing both Google and Amazon, Upload VR’s entrepreneur in residence, Robert Scoble, citing sources, recently reported that Apple is working on a set of mixed-reality glasses that could be ready in 10 months.\nAlso see: Apple and augmented reality — where we’re going, we won’t need iPhones \nStill, other uncertainties loom, such as the new White House administration . While President-elect Donald Trump’s proposed repatriation tax “holiday” would make it easier for Apple to return cash to the US and put that money to work, other Trump policies that might make Apple build more iPhone components in the US could offset tax-related financial benefits.\nLast week, Japan’s Nikkei Asian Review reported that Apple reached out to supplier Foxconn Technology about studying the possibility of moving some production to the US , which Cakmak said might have negative implications.\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google WhatsApp Email Copy This article originally appeared on Marketwatch .",

      "text": "News › iPhone 8 could become Apple's best selling phone ever, OLED screen and wireless charging to be key features iPhone 8 could become Apple's best selling phone ever, OLED screen and wireless charging to be key features Posted: Tags : iOS - iOS + Apple - Apple + 2017 marks the 10th anniversary of the iPhone, and it could be a huge year for Apple in terms of sales, obviously thanks to the much anticipated iPhone 8 . According to famous KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo (known for his accurate predictions when it comes to all things Apple), iPhone suppliers are getting ready to produce between 120 and 150 million new handsets in the second half of fiscal year 2017 (for Apple, this means March - September 2017). As previously reported, no less than three iPhone 8 models are expected to debut next year. Alongside direct successors to the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus (which should sport screens of 4.7 inches and 5.5 inches, respectively), a third model with a curved OLED screen of around 5.2 inches could hit the market in 2017. As mentioned yesterday, Apple is seemingly testing more than 10 iPhone 8 prototypes , and still has time to decided what models to release.If Apple sells more than 120 million iPhone 8 units, this will become the company's best selling handset series to date, surpassing the iPhone 6 in popularity.Ming-Chi Kuo notes that the high demand for iPhone 8 models will likely be driven by the new curved OLED screen, as well as by wireless charging. Interestingly, right now, it's said that only the 4.7-inch iPhone 8 may feature wireless charging (in addition to a \"glass casing\"). If a recent rumor is to be believed, Apple's wireless charging technology could be like no other out there, allowing the iPhone 8 to be charged even if it's up to 15 feet away from its transmitter. Of course, it remains to be seen if there's any truth to this. PhoneArena is on Instagram . Follow us to stay updated with fresh news and flashy media from the world of mobile!",

      "text": "ZDNet Japan Apple has a Calendar and Photos spam problem and it better fix it soon There's a nasty new kind of spam hitting Apple users across the Internet. We show you what's happening, point you to some fixes, and call on Apple to make fixing this loophole a top priority. | Topic: Security \nI sat down at my multi-screen iMac on Black Friday, just like I do every day. There was something odd on the screen: a notification informing me that the \"Ray Ban Black Friday price is online today.\" \nThis shouldn't be happening. \nThis was... unexpected. I'm pretty familiar with the notifications I get on my Macs, and I've never gotten an ad before. I took a quick look at the Notifications panel in System Preferences and didn't see anything that seemed like it would generate an ad. \nSystem Preferences Notifications panel. \nYes, Calendar was shown as a notification item, but I disregarded it because I never use Apple's Calendar. I'm so invested in Google Calendar that I don't think I ever opened the program prior to discovering this issue. \nMy first thought was that it was related to Safari, but Safari was closed. So rather than continue to fumble around in the dark, I turned to that source of all knowledge on the Internet. No, not Google. Social media. I posted a quick message on Twitter and Facebook, along with the above screenshot of the notification. \nI got a lot of replies. It turns out I'm not alone in getting what I've come to know as notification spam. Apparently, it's possible for spammers to email a calendar invite and something (I'm still not completely sure of the mechanism) then puts that invite into the MacOS calendar. According to some of my correspondents, the same thing happens with iOS. I don't use the iOS calendar, either, so I didn't see it in iOS. \nOne of our own ZDNet columnists confirms the iOS behavior: \"I got the same thing on my iPod Touch and the only thing I use it for is listening to music and audiobooks. Weird.\" \nAs I mentioned above, I'm not sure how that invite made it into my calendar. I don't use iCloud and I don't use Apple's mail program, so unless there's something going on in background (part of why I was hoping for an Apple reply), invites sent to my email inbox should never reach Apple's calendar. I can sort of prove that because I have a whole lot of events in my main Google Calendar, none of which show up on the Apple Calendar page. \nHere's the item, set as a reminder, in my MacOS Calendar app. \nNote what has been added to my Apple Calendar app. \nAs the following image shows, the calendar invite was sent as spam to a list of email addresses. \nThis sort of thing is showing up on a lot of users' Calendar apps this weekend. \nThe domain shown in the link (rb-home) was registered just last month. Worse, in my conversations on Facebook, I was informed by one friend that he has a friend who ordered from that site, which resulted in the theft of his credit card. Obviously, it's never a good idea to order from a random spammer, but that person's experience goes to prove that this sort of notification spam is not just a nuisance, but also malicious. \nDuring my discussions, social media correspondents told me that Apple's Photos app is also subject to unprotected sharing invites, which also result in spam. As one person told me, turning off sharing isn't an option, because members of the same family regularly share photos. How to fix the problem (sort of) More security news",

      "text": "  The tech company has filed a new design that could make a flipping touchscreen smartphone a reality in the near future Sara Roncero-Menendez 29 november 2016 \nApple as a company is always looking to set the pace for the next big tech trend. The iPhone 7 did away with the ever popular audio port, but the next iteration may have even more radical items, like being foldable. The tech giant filed for a new patent for a folding smartphone that can be clipped to one’s shirt \nThe fold is along the middle of the touchscreen phone with a hinge to keep the two halves together. The designs include flexible printed circuit boards to keep the phone running even when folded. If and when exactly Apple will debut this flip phone, the patent doesn’t reveal any additional features so what the final product would look like is a mystery. But it may mean the return of the flip-to-end-call motion that many have missed since flip-phones become obsolete.",

      "text": "Canary Brings Live-Streaming and Archived Footage to Apple TV With New App Tuesday November 29, 2016 8:03 AM PST by Mitchel Broussard Connected security camera company Canary is today launching a new update to its app that introduces support for the fourth-generation Apple TV , letting users view their camera's live stream on their television, or watch older recordings saved within the app. Prior to the Apple TV app, Canary users only had the company's mobile app to view content captured via a Canary or Canary Flex system (via TechCrunch ). When the Apple TV app is opened, Canary users will be presented with a dashboard and choose between live and recorded feeds. For those who have multiple Canary cameras, the app will initially open upon a \"Location view,\" so they can choose which system to access video. Canary cameras record movement as \"events,\" so users can scrub through each on the Apple TV app, bookmark important ones, delete those deemed unnecessary to save, and jump to the next one with a Related Videos section under each of these events. The version 2.0.2 update to the Canary app also brings support for iPads and Android tablets. In addition to HD video capture, the Canary cameras monitor air quality and include a built-in 90 decibel siren that users can activate through the mobile app to scare off intruders the camera notices within the home. The Canary Flex has many of the same camera-capturing features as the basic model, with the added bonus of a completely weatherproof outer shell. Canary can be downloaded from the iOS App Store for free [ Direct Link ]. The 2.0.2 update has yet to hit the App Store, but should begin rolling out today.",

Apple suppliers are slated to make 120 million to 150 million iPhones in the second half of 2017, a volume that would crush all previous sales, according to a top analytics firm report cited by 9to5Mac. \nKGI Securities forecasts three new iPhones with wireless charging from Apple next year, 9to5Mac reported Tuesday. The phones could include one major redesign, the iPhone 8, with two more iterative updates to the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, according to 9to5Mac. \nWith features like a glass chassis and a bright, flexible screen, the new handsets could outsell Apple's most popular phone to date, the iPhone 6 phablets, KGI's analysis said. \nKGI's updated forecast comes on the heels of a Wall Street Journal report that Apple is considering more than 10 designs for its 10th anniversary iPhone next year, including at least one flexible screen design. \nTo be sure, Apple doesn't always sell every iPhone it plans to make. Last year, Apple initially provided the supply chain with high numbers only to cut numbers later, according to UBS analysts. \nBut an iPhone sales boost could provide much-needed relief to Apple investors, who watched iPhone sales drop from their year-ago volumes for three-straight quarters this year. Analysts surveyed by FactSet expect Apple to sell 78 million iPhones in the December 2016 quarter, up from 75 million from a year ago, bringing the second-half 2016 sales to 124 million. \nFor the full story, see the article at 9to5Mac.com here.",

Apple's Siri Knows All About 'The Secret Life of Pets' This appears to be the first movie tie-in for Cupertino's voice assistant by Bryan M. Wolfe November 29, 2016 \nOne of the most popular films of 2016 is now available through streaming services such as iTunes. “The Secret Life of Pets” is also making a splash on Apple’s Siri service. \nAccording to 9to5Mac , Universal Picture’s “The Secret Life of Pets” has become the first movie with a Siri tie-in. As a result, the voice assistant can now answer 15 questions about the film, which first arrived in theaters in July. \nThe movie studio confirms, “with 15 different programmed responses, this is the first time Apple has collaborated on a home entertainment title and the first time Siri has been programmed to interact with an iTunes movie title .”",

      "text": "– A + As Apple shows interest in AR/VR, PlayStation VR's strong start suggests price beats performance By Neil Hughes \nTuesday, November 29, 2016, 07:59 am PT (10:59 am ET) \nThe latest— and more affordable —high-profile entrant into the emerging virtual reality space, PlayStation VR, is off to a successful start, suggesting consumers are more interested in advanced VR technology if it's available in a simple and economical product.\n\n\n\n\nApple Chief Executive Tim Cook had repeatedly expressed interest in both virtual reality and augmented reality, stating that he sees potential in both. But while he said VR has some \"interesting applications\"— like games, as the PlayStation VR provides —Cook sees more opportunities in AR, and his company continues to invest accordingly.\n\nAs Apple invests, current market players HTC Vive and Facebook's Oculus Rift have seen their corner of the market shaken up by PlayStation VR. New research from SuperData, as publicized by The Information \nPlayStation VR officially launched in October starting at $399, and is compatible with the sub-$300 PlayStation 4 game console, of which Sony has already sold millions. In contrast, more powerful Vive and Rift headsets cost hundreds of dollars more, and require expensive Windows PCs that can run well over $1,000.\n\nOn the lower end of the market, Samsung sells the Gear VR headset for $100, and Google's Daydream is priced at $79, though both require compatible smartphones and do not offer the same level of performance as PlayStation VR. Even Apple's iPhone can support low-end VR apps with affordable accessories like Google Cardboard.\n\nIn a sense, PlayStation VR occupies something of a middle ground— more affordable than high-end PC virtual reality, but also more capable than cheap smartphone-based versions.\n\n\n\n\nIn uncharacteristic comments about his company's future product plans, Cook has admitted that Apple is \"doing a lot of things\" in the augmented reality space, calling both it and virtual reality \"incredibly interesting.\"\n\nWhile virtual reality can transport users to entirely new worlds, augmented reality integrates cameras and sensors to blur the lines between the real world and a virtual one. In Cook's view, augmented reality could eventually amplify human contact.\n\nAugmented reality can be thought of as a layer of digital information overlaid onto the physical world. Advanced versions of the immersive technology use specialized transparent displays, though developers working within contemporary hardware constraints have created effective analogs using smartphone cameras and displays. Niantic's hit game Pokémon Go , available for iOS, is one such example.\n\n\n\n\nThough Apple has yet to outline an official AR strategy, the company is making strategic AR segment purchases like last year's acquisition of motion capture specialist Faceshift and German AR firm Metaio . The company is also developing supporting tech in-house, as evidence by a growing portfolio of AR/VR patents like transparent displays, iPhone-powered virtual reality systems, advanced computer vision tech and more.\n\nPiper Jaffray analyst and AR/VR proponent Gene Munster has predicted that virtual and augmented reality applications and accessories could become part of the official \"Made for iPhone\" licensing program within the next few years.",

      "text": "Apple's AirPods were supposed to be released in October. Well, now it's almost December and we still have no idea when the AirPods will finally hit store shelves. Truth be told, even when they do launch they definitely won't be the go-to wireless earbuds for many people since their design is so... how can we put this politely... hideous. Tack on a steep $159 price tag and you've completely lost us.\nHere's another option: grab the Rowkin Bit Stereo Wireless Earbuds on Amazon for $50 less. They're shipping right now, they're more affordable, and they don't look like someone took normal earbuds and just ripped the cable out of them.\nContinue reading... \nTrending right now: \nReport says the new 4.7-inch iPhone 8 will be more exciting than you think There’s a fix for your iPhone 6s’ serious battery drain, but you might not like it Samsung has started to turn the Galaxy Note 5 into the Note 7 ",

      "title": "4.7-inch iPhone 8 said to sport glass, wireless charging, OLED, too",
      "text": "See full gallery on TechnoBuffalo We’ve heard plenty of chatter about Apple’s rumored iPhone 8, likely bound for the market sometime next September, but not very much about the company’s smaller models. A new report from KGI Securities analyst Ming Chi-Kuo, who always has an ear to the tracks in Apple’s supply chain, suggests some of the high-end features will also trickle down to Apple’s mid-size iPhone.\nKuo’s latest report suggests Apple’s suppliers are gearing up to produce wireless charging units, OLED displays and glass panels for the 4.7-inch iPhone. Apple’s 4.7-inch iPhone is typically the standard model, more advanced than the smallest 4-inch devices but often lacking flagship features found in the Plus-sized iPhones.\nThis year, for example, the iPhone 7 Plus sports special dual-cameras on the back while the standard iPhone 7 does not. It seemed plausible that Apple might save the glass design, the wireless charging or the OLED panel as an exclusive feature for its most advanced iPhone 8 next year, but Kuo’s report disputes those suggestions. Indeed, earlier reports from Kuo have also suggested that all of Apple’s new iPhones will sport wireless charging , a feature Apple has yet to dip its toes into.\nAs a result of the added features, however, Kuo believes Apple may have a very successful iPhone on its hands. Kuo suggests the device may call for “unprecedented replacement demand” from consumers who are ready to swap out their older iPhones, perhaps beating Apple’s previous records. As a result, Apple’s suppliers are gearing up to build somewhere between 120 million and 150 million units, Kuo said.\niPhone 8 supply chain rumors probably hold some truth It might seem like it’s too early to speculate and predict Apple’s moves for the next iPhone, but, in reality, the company is very likely indeed moving ahead pretty quickly on development. It usually takes at least a year for a firm to get a new product out to consumers. We’re now just 10 months away from the expected launch of Apple’s next iPhone.\nApple’s flagship iPhone 8 is expected to offer a curved OLED display , a feature that may help it stand out from the aforementioned smaller 4.7-inch devices. Apple is apparently testing 10 different flagship prototypes, however, so it’s still unclear what sort of device we can expect at the high end.\nStill, it makes sense for Apple to start preparing enough supplies long in advance of launch, especially if it’s planning to use components it hasn’t used before. Any lack of preparation could lead to shortages.\n\n\nSource : 9to5Mac ",

      "text": "Report shows Apple interested in heart monitoring hardware By Dan Pye ● 30 minutes ago \nEmails obtained by MobiHealthNews show Apple has been meeting with the FDA since July about two cardiac monitoring products. In the messages, Apple lawyer Robin Goldstein discussed “an introductory meeting where we will want to talk about two possible (and related) products in the cardiac space, as well as the associated regulatory and quality systems and requirements.” The emails don’t contain any information about the products, but the company recently patented a wearable electrocardiographic health device that could have been part of the discussion. CEO Tim Cook has hinted at ambitious plans for Apple in the health field, admitting that the scope of his vision might require devices other than the Apple Watch. Goldstein ‘s exchanges with FDA Associate Center Director for Digital Health Bakul Patel show a concern on Apple’s part about keeping the discussion private, with Goldstein at one point asking to cancel a larger gathering in favor of “a smaller meeting to discuss how Apple may engage with the FDA in a way that’s ‘non-regulatory’ so we can learn about your processes and thinking, and vice versa.”",

      "text": "The smartphone market is expected to show significant deceleration in 2016, according to the latest forecast by industry tracker IDC. Worldwide shipments are expected to reach 1.45 billion, which would represent a year-over-year growth rate of 0.6% compared with 10.4% in the year-earlier period. Alphabet Inc.'s (GOOGL) Android operating system is expected to show the only growth, rising an estimated 5.2% year-over-year to 1.2 billion, fueled by Android's expansion in emerging markets and the that hit the market this fall. Shipments of phones operating Apple Inc.'s (AAPL) iOS, the second most-used operating system behind Android, are forecast to fall 11% year-over-year to 206 million, despite the release of the iPhone 7 in September. Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) smartphone shipments are expected to plunge 79%. Shares of Google rose 0.5% to $789.94 in morning trade and have risen 2.3% in the past year. Apple's shares fell 1.1% on Tuesday and are down 6.3% in the past year. The Dow Jones Industrial Average has outperformed both stocks on the year, rising 7.3%.\n-Jennifer Booton; 1033ET\n ",

      "text": "From time to time we mention that sometimes when someone goes to an Apple store for repair or upgrade on an older computer, they are told it's considered \"vintage\". For more detail on this...here's an Apple document that explains what Apple considers \"vintage\" and \"obsolete\" (and lists them by model):\n\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201624 \n\n- Vintage products are those that have not been manufactured for more than 5 and less than 7 years ago. \n- Obsolete products are those that were discontinued more than 7 years ago.\n\nFrom what I've been reading. Some additional models will likely be added to the vintage & obsolete lists at the end of the year:\n\n• MacBook Pro (15-inch, Early 2011) \n• MacBook Pro (17-inch, Early 2011) \n• Mac mini (Early 2009) \n• MacBook (13-inch, Mid 2009) \n\nThis includes my favorite \"Early 2011\" 17\" MacBook Pro.;)\n\nWhat does this really mean for the average Apple computer owning person with a computer 5-7 or more years old?? In my opinion not all that much. If we have a 5-7 year old (or older) Apple computer...and if repairs or upgrades are needed/wanted...we more than likely would not be taking it to Apple (too expensive). We would most likely be taking it to an independent computer repair place (could be an Apple authorized repair place)...or do the repairs/upgrades ourselves.:)\n\nMostly just mentioning this for informational reasons...since the terms \"vintage\" and \"obsolete\" sometimes are used in discussions.:)\n\n- Nick ",

      "text": "Piper Jaffray conducted its annual survey on holiday spending intentions and found that Apple's devices top this year's holiday wishlists. The iPhone is the most wanted holiday gift, followed by Apple's MacBook. ( Apple ) Advertisement \nApple's iPhone is apparently the most coveted holiday item this year, according to a survey conducted by investment firm Piper Jaffray. \nWhile Apple stirred a bit of a controversy with its latest devices, particularly the iPhone 7 with no headphone jack and the MacBook Pro with redesigned (read: missing) ports, it still tops the holiday wish lists this year. \nApple devices have always been in high demand, but it seems that this year, the iPhone is even more coveted than it was last year. Piper Jaffray surveyed 1,000 consumers over the past month to learn about their holiday wish lists, and Apple devices are apparently a must-have this holiday season. Of course, Apple already knew that when it published its Apple Holiday Gift Guide earlier this month. Apple iPhone, Most Requested Gift \nThe iPhone has topped consumers' wish lists, with more people dreaming of the device than any other item. \n\"Our retail team has done a survey of a thousand people in the U.S. last month and the percentage of people that wanted an iPhone — that was the number one requested gift,\" said Gene Munster, Piper Jaffray managing director, on CNBC's Squawk Box morning news show. \nPiper Jaffray found that 7.2 percent of people surveyed wanted an iPhone, making Apple's popular smartphone the number 1 requested gift this season. The firm's Holiday Spending Intentions Survey from 2015 found that 5.2 percent of respondents wanted an iPhone. \nThis means that the iPhone's appeal has increased from last year, so either the iPhone 7 is more attractive or the Galaxy Note 7 recall tipped the scale heavily in Apple's favor. \nMunster reckons that the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus may only be incremental upgrades from Apple's 2015 iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus, but consumers still want an iPhone. Top 10 Most Wanted Holiday Gifts \nThe survey found that the top 10 most wanted holiday gifts for 2016 are, in order: iPhone, MacBook, Xbox, smartwatch, PlayStation, GoPro, Michael Kors, Fitbit, hoverboard and drone. \nWhen it comes to brand preferences for the top gifts, Piper Jaffray found that Apple mindshare, which refers to what consumers say they plan to purchase, has risen to 10.3 percent this year. Apple's iPhones and MacBooks were the most popular items among teenagers. \nMunster further points out that Apple's decision to reinstate Black Friday and offer discounts on iPhones, iPads and more devices was the company's way of acknowledging that it needs to come up with some incentives to boost sales. \nNevertheless, with so many Black Friday and Cyber Monday deals on Apple devices and the iPhone as the most wanted holiday gift, Apple's device sales will likely end the year with a bang.

      "text": "  Download Current Issue \nFinnish national airline Finnair is adopting internal enterprise apps through a deal with IBM. \nThe company said the move will see the workforce use apps and support its internal digital transformation. The airline has already introduced digital services for customers, but this deal brings it into the internal operation.   Brexit and UK tech: Essential guide \nFind your way in the post-Brexit world and establish priorities in the face of uncertainty   \n“We are working with the core processes of an airline and bringing digital services into them,” Katri Harra-Salonen, chief digital officer at Finnair , told Computer Weekly. “This will bring better quality to the processes, build more user-friendly applications and tools for our employees, and increase productivity.” \nFinnair, which carries 10 million travellers annually, will be the first company to use IBM’s Mobile at Scale for iOS development model, which launched in August. This gives Finnair full access to IBM’s MobileFirst iOS business app portfolio (which was built in partnership with Apple ), as well as its app development and design tools. As of November 2016, MobileFirst covered over 100 apps across 15 industries. \n“We have a portfolio of 14 airline-specific applications in the pipeline, and nine have been delivered already,” said Raimon Christiani, global industry leader at IBM Travel and Transportation . “There is a team of developers, security and legacy integration specialists taking care of scaling the mobile app portfolio for Finnair.” \nFinnair’s first two iOS apps will be deployed in early 2017, and focus on aircraft line maintenance. They will provide aircraft mechanics with digital task cards and documentation, while their supervisors get a real-time overview of flight schedules, maintenance processes and mechanic availability. Read more about Finnair IT Finland’s national airline, Finnair, has signed a five-and-a-half-year services deal with IBM to transform its technology infrastructure into a hybrid cloud platform. Finnair is on a digital transformation journey , and the airline’s CIO is changing the IT department as it progresses. \nBoth apps are already part of IBM’s existing portfolio for the airline industry, but will be customised for Finnair. This customisation and app development will be carried out by IBM’s dedicated MobileFirst Garage team in Bangalore, working with the airline. Finnair sees this as a flexible and cost-efficient approach to enterprise apps. \n“This also gives us the opportunity to develop custom apps,” said Harra-Salonen. “T he business can benefit from such apps, but it is important we have a rapid cycle to put them into use as needed.” A history of collaboration \nFinnair and IBM have a long history of collaboration, and signed a five-and-a-half-year cloud transformation deal in 2015. But the enterprise apps are a separate partnership, and the airline talked with several potential partners before making the decision to work with IBM again. \n“We started this process from a very user-focused angle,” said Harra-Salonen. “We had workshops with different teams in our operations unit, and really tried to figure out how we could make their daily work more comfortable and effective. We then started to look at how we should build and provide this experience.” \nHarra-Salonen added that users have been involved at every step. Finnair has sent teams to IBM’s facilities in Bangalore, as well as had maintenance staff attend workshops with Apple’s designers. \nWhile Finnair believes enterprise apps have potential benefits to offer across its operations, it wants to take its time to identify the right areas for further digital integration. \n“We have already completed early work with different teams, such as the crew, pilots and ground operations, so we have an initial view of the systems we might need in future. We haven’t, however, made any decisions on where to go next,” Harra-Salonen said. CW+ Enjoy the benefits of CW+ membership, learn more and join. E-Zine",

      "text": "By Tiernan Ray Shares of Apple ( AAPL ) are down 52 cents, or half a percent, at $111.02, after UBS ’s Steve Milunovich reiterated a Buy rating on the stock, and a $127 price target, but warned that his estimate for how many units of iPhone the company is ready to produce are going down for this quarter and next, putting Street expectations at risk.\nMilunovich is revising down his “procurement estimates,” without citing sources:\nProcurement numbers for Dec are revised down to 74mn from 75mn units, a 1% decline YoY. New estimates for March are 42mn units, down from 43mn last year. Units continue to shift toward the 7 Plus with 26mn estimated in F1Q/17 vs 17mn units in F1Q/16. This shift should support ASPs. Investors have been concerned about the Mar quarter as Apple faces a relatively difficult comparison. Our survey shows strength for the iPhone 7 in the US and Europe but potential softness in China.\nMilunovich isn’t changing his actual numbers for Apple, but he notes his 76-million unit sales estimate for this quarter is below what he deems Street consensus at 78 million units.\nHis advice regarding the stock is that any shortfall may not matter much because the focus is really on a forthcoming “fiscal 18 product cycle.”",

      "text": "Reddit \nThe iPhone 7 Plus will see a replacement in 2017, as will the iPhone SE, but not to the same tune of last year’s upgrade. Apple’s next iPhone series won’t likely take the same approach. Instead, based on information we’ve gathered over the past 24 hours, it’s become apparent that Apple is about to take the iPhone 8 out a whole new door. \nApple’s iPhone strategy is clear – especially when it comes to the “find my iPhone” culture they’ve cultivated. My iPhone is the device I use to communicate with the world. It’s never been My Smartphone – if I’m an iPhone user, it’s a matter of what’s best for my iPhone and how my iPhone experience will be upgraded every year. \nSEE TOO: Let’s get real on iPhone 8 rumors \nTo be a bit more realistic for most users: it’s about how my iPhone experience will be upgraded every 2 or 3 years. If that’s the case, Apple’s strategy can be more readily compared to NVIDIA’s presentation of new graphics cards. Apple wants us to compare a new iPhone to the iPhone we already have – an iPhone we bought 2 or 3 years ago. \nThe iPhone 4 and iPhone 5 had very similar designs, as did the iPhone 6 and iPhone 7. An upgrade from iPhone 4, 2 or 3 years later, means an iPhone 5 or 5s. An upgrade from iPhone 5s over that same cycle means an iPhone 6s or iPhone 7. \nThere is one good reason for Apple to break from their upgrade cycle this season: the iPhone SE. The iPhone SE is the company’s best uninteresting phone . According to Kantar Worldpanel ComTech , iPhone SE was the UK’s top selling smartphone between April and June of this year. \nHave a peek at Google Trends to find search numbers for iPhone SE at the top of all iPhone searches, just after “find my iPhone” and “iPhone 7 Plus”. Users want either the biggest and best or the cheapest new iPhone available at this point in history. Given rumors from the Wall Street Journal on Apple’s possible testing of 10 new prototypes of iPhone models for next year, it’s easy to see how a trend-breaking iPhone 8 could be on the books. \nIt’s time for the 2 to 3 year upgrade for owners of the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus. It’s time for Apple to turn the tables and make this an upgrade that’s so impressive, only those that absolutely cannot afford it will be able to avoid dismissing the desire. It’s time for all of the rumors and dreams to come true in an iPhone 8 that’s a true monster, 10 years in the making. \nImages VIA illustrator and concept artist Martin Hajek . Story Timeline",

      "title": "Tech Today: Apple’s Risks, Samsung’s Deliberation, DirecTV NOW’s Prospects",
      "text": "By Tiernan Ray Here are some things going on today in your world of tech :\nShares of Samsung Electronics ( 005930KS ) closed unchanged at 1,677,000 Korean Won after the company said it would increase its shareholders payouts but resisted the appeal of activists Elliott Management to force the company to split itself into two parts, including a holding company, as my colleague Shuli Ren reported.\nThe New York Times ’s Paul Mozur , in his write-up of Samsung’s statements , reads Samsung’s statement, that it remains “absolutely neutral” about a restructuring, as being less forceful, and more amenable, to Elliott.\nResearch firm IDC this morning reports that worldwide smartphone sales will rise 0.6% this year to 1.45 billion units, a huge fall from last year’s 10.4%. Sales of phones with 4G connections, however, are expected to rise 21.3% to 1.17 billion.\nShares of fitness wearables pioneer Fitbit ( FIT ) are up 5 cents, or 0.6%, at $8.45, in pre-market trading after Longbow ’s Joe Wittine, who’s Neutral on the stock, issued a note to clients says the company dominated the best-seller lists during Black Friday , according to a write-up by TheFlyontheWall .\nShares of AT&T ( T ) are up 4 cents at $39.58, after the company yesterday announced “ DirecTV NOW ” will soon be available as a streaming video “ over-the-top ” offering, with approximately 60 channels of television for $35 per month.\nRBC Capital ’s Steven Cahall , who follows the media biz, notes that AT&T hasn’t fully disclosed all channels participating, but CBS ( CBS ) is believed to be a hold-out. Says Cahall, “DTV has launched a potentially great product with NOW, in our view, that leverages having some of the best programming costs in the business due to scale, as we think DTV’s programming costs are some 20-30% below the industry average.”\n“This may force competitor products to come down to DTV’s price point even if their wholesale costs are much higher.”\nApple ( AAPL ) estimates are in the news again, with UBS ’s Steve Milunovich , who has a Buy rating on the stock, and a $127 price target, saying data on how many parts the company is procuring for the iPhone suggest there may be downside to Street estimates for the December and March quarters. Apple shares are down 87 cents at $110.70.\nIn earnings today, integrated enterprise equipment vendor Nutanix ( NTNX ) will report fiscal Q1 results, its first report as a public company, after the closing bell. The Street is, on average, modeling $152.3 million in revenue and a net loss of 44 cents a share.",

      "text": "  Apple ( AAPL ) are down 52 cents, or half a percent, at $111.02, after UBS ’s Steve Milunovich reiterated a Buy rating on the stock, and a $127 price target, but warned that his estimate for how many units of iPhone the company is ready to produce are going down for this quarter and next, putting Street expectations at risk.\nMilunovich is revising down his “procurement estimates,” without citing sources:\nProcurement numbers for Dec are revised down to 74mn from 75mn units, a 1% decline YoY. New estimates for March are 42mn units, down from 43mn last year. Units continue to shift toward the 7 Plus with 26mn estimated in F1Q/17 vs 17mn units in F1Q/16. This shift should support ASPs. Investors have been concerned about the Mar quarter as Apple faces a relatively difficult comparison. Our survey shows strength for the iPhone 7 in the US and Europe but potential softness in China. \nMilunovich isn’t changing his actual numbers for Apple, but he notes his 76-million unit sales estimate for this quarter is below what he deems Street consensus at 78 million units.\nHis advice regarding the stock is that any shortfall may not matter much because the focus is really on a forthcoming “fiscal 18 product cycle.”",

      "text": "Martellus Bennett compares NFL to Apple, Myspace in bizarre Twitter rant The Patriots TE weighed in on the NFL's international movement and Color Rush uniforms. By Cameron DaSilva Nov 29, 2016 at 11:14a ET 0Shares \nMartellus Bennett , like his brother Michael, is never shy about sharing his thoughts on everything from Jay Cutler to the NFL as a whole. Whether it’s during his media sessions or in late-night Twitter rants, Bennett is often unfiltered and sometimes brash with his opinions of the league. \nLate Monday night, Bennett spoke out on the state of the NFL and declining television ratings with a handful of bizarre comparisons. He began by discussing the idea that the league is oversaturated by the number of primetime games played each week. true Has the NFL oversaturated it's market? Monday. Thursday. And Sunday. There used to be something special about waiting to watch a game. — Martellus Bennett (@MartysaurusRex) November 29, 2016 true I keep reading that ratings are down of course they are. Lol. You can watch the game on twitter, Snapchat, Facebook, tv, Morse code etc.. — Martellus Bennett (@MartysaurusRex) November 29, 2016 \nHe then continued by comparing the NFL to Apple, with both brands attempting to branch out and come up with new ideas after producing such a great product for years. true Trying to expand the global brand of the NFL like the NBA with games in London and Mexico. Lol football isn't even a global sport. — Martellus Bennett (@MartysaurusRex) November 29, 2016 true NFL is at the same. Bridge as Apple. Theyve been successful creating the same product for so long and now are looking for ways to grow — Martellus Bennett (@MartysaurusRex) November 29, 2016 true A little more. Apple gave you different color phones NFL gave you different color uniforms. Lol. Apple wants in on the china market — Martellus Bennett (@MartysaurusRex) November 29, 2016 \nHe wasn’t done yet. Bennett suggested that the league may be headed down the same path that Myspace traveled – a great brand that quickly turned uninteresting. true Its a great product. The game of football that is. But myspace was once a great social media platform. Hahaha. — Martellus Bennett (@MartysaurusRex) November 29, 2016 \nBennett isn't blasting the NFL or suggesting it's due for a downfall, but his comparisons are, well, interesting, to say the least.",

      "text": "| Follow About | \nEye On Apple covers the latest hot news stories, rumors and illuminating discussions about Apple and its products. Product coverage includes Apple Watch, Mac, iPhone, iPad, Apple Pay, Apple TV. Opinion Get a better grip on your iPad Pro without a case Is the iPad Pro a bit too slippery to handle well? Here’s how you can improve its “grippiness” and make it easier to hold without using a case. CIO | Nov 29, 2016 8:53 AM PT Email a friend Use commas to separate multiple email addresses From Your message has been sent. Sorry There was an error emailing this page. More like this 4 great gifts for mobile professionals \nHave I told you lately how much I hate having a case on my iPad Pro? I really, really hate cases. They add extra weight, and they cover up a beautiful device thus making it look pedestrian at best. \nUnfortunately, the iPad Pro is also thin and very slippery because of its aluminum back. So I’ve been using a light black case that has a textured back to make it easier to hold and use my iPad Pro. \nI recently decided to dump the case so I could use the iPad Pro the way Apple meant it to be used. To make sure that I didn’t accidentally drop my iPad Pro or have it slip off a table or other surface, I added egrips HD stickers to the back of it. \nHere’s the official description of eGrips stickers from the product's page at Amazon: \negrips HD (Heavy Duty) Anti-Slip Sticker Kit egrips HD non-slip grip material is like nothing you've every seen or handled. It's Heavy Duty, extremely grippy, but not sticky. \nIt's 1mm thick and has unlimited uses! Placed on the bottom of a slippery 15\" Macbook Pro makes a HUGE difference. The laptop no longer slides around on the desk or the lap, and is much easier to pull out of a bag and hold on to. \nNOT for mobile phone / smartphone - Strongest Adhesive - FLAT SURFACES ONLY - NOT FOR DEVICE SIDES \nThis isn’t the first time I’ve used these egrips stickers. I first tried them out on the back of my iPhone 6s Plus , and they worked great. I no longer use it with a case, and I can easily hold it without worrying that it will slip through my fingers. \nSo I was very happy when I realized that I could buy the egrip stickers for my iPad Pro too. It’s so much easier to pick the iPad Pro up and hold it with the stickers on, and the iPad Pro itself feels much lighter without the ugly case on it. Buy an extra pack or two of egrip stickers \nJust one piece of advice if you buy the egrip stickers: Buy an extra pack or two. \nI found with my iPad Pro that the pack I bought didn’t quite provide enough coverage on the back of the device since I wanted some at the top and bottom too. But the package I bought only had enough for the left and right side (I used more than one sticker for each side as I like having most of my fingers on the stickers). \nSo I ended up ordering a couple more packages to make sure I had enough coverage in the spots I wanted to put my hands to hold the iPad Pro or to just pick it up. Obviously if you are using one of the smaller iPads, you'll need fewer stickers. \nOverall though I am quite pleased with how much better it is to use my iPad Pro without the case, and without worrying about dropping it or having it slip off a table or other surface. Time for Apple to retire its use of aluminum? \nHaving to buy the egrip stickers makes me wonder about Apple continuing to use aluminum in its iPhone and iPads. There’s no doubt that it looks great, but it’s also incredibly slippery and makes it very hard to easily grip these devices. \nI wonder if it’s time for Apple to just retire the aluminum thing for good and move on? Frankly, I’d rather have a grippy, rubber back on my iPad Pro and iPhone instead of the pretty brushed aluminum. \nI've heard rumors that Apple is going to use an all glass case instead of the brushed aluminum ones we've seen for so long. I'm not sure if glass will be grippier than aluminum, but I doubt it can be any worse. \nDid you miss a post?

      "text": "by Caitlyn Holroyd 20m ago Scott R. Galvin / USA TODAY Sports \nCould the NFL be headed down the same path as Myspace? New England Patriots tight end Martellus Bennett apparently thinks so. \nBennett offered his thoughts on the NFL's declining television ratings, global expansion, and color rush uniforms in a bizarre Twitter rant early Tuesday morning, comparing the league to Apple and suggesting it could eventually become irrelevant. Has the NFL oversaturated it's market? Monday. Thursday. And Sunday. There used to be something special about waiting to watch a game. — Martellus Bennett (@MartysaurusRex) November 29, 2016 I keep reading that ratings are down of course they are. Lol. You can watch the game on twitter, Snapchat, Facebook, tv, Morse code etc.. — Martellus Bennett (@MartysaurusRex) November 29, 2016 Trying to expand the global brand of the NFL like the NBA with games in London and Mexico. Lol football isn't even a global sport. — Martellus Bennett (@MartysaurusRex) November 29, 2016 NFL is at the same. Bridge as Apple. Theyve been successful creating the same product for so long and now are looking for ways to grow — Martellus Bennett (@MartysaurusRex) November 29, 2016 A little more. Apple gave you different color phones NFL gave you different color uniforms. Lol. Apple wants in on the china market — Martellus Bennett (@MartysaurusRex) November 29, 2016 Its a great product. The game of football that is. But myspace was once a great social media platform. Hahaha.",

You should be able to check out your activity timeline from Apple TV as well. Nest announced a similar update earlier in November, but the Google/Alphabet property extended TV viewing to both Android TV and Apple TV users. \nI asked Canary about this and the company said it didn't currently have plans for an Android TV integration.

      "title": "Frankie’s Holiday: Apple Declares We Should Love Everyone… Including Monstrous Transhumans",
      "text": "By William Henry\nOn November 15, 2016 Apple, the “think different company”, began sharing a special new TV ad called “ Frankie’s Holiday ” in time for the holiday (Christ Mass) season, accompanied with the tagline “open your heart to everyone.”\nThe ad features a loner monster modeled after the hybrid creation of Dr. Victor Frankenstein singing “Home for the Holidays” on his iPhone.\nPlayed by actor Brad Garrett, the monster is actually a cross between a human, Dr. Suess’s Grinch and Dr. Frankenstein’s fabricated creature.\n\nThe 2-minute ad is beautifully produced and features eloquent, Christmassy cinematography. It obviously was not shot on an iPhone, as Apple has done with past ads that demonstrate its products. In fact, the iPhone 7 is only shown fleetingly in the ad.\nThe ad’s story left viewers wondering “where are they going with this?”\nThe answer is, Frankie is a transhuman trojan horse put forth by a company with $250 billion in cash that wants much more than your money.\nIt is a declaration by Apple that they wish for us to love something otherwise scary, if not unbelievably deplorable and abhorrent, to billions of humans.\nHere’s the story.\nAs the commercial opens, Frankie is tucked up in his cozy home perched above a mountain village (like all monsters, he lives alone, isolated, solitary). He uses his new, gold iPhone7 to record the tune to “Home for the Holidays” played by an old music box to his Voice Memos app.\nAnswering the call from a portrait of Mary Shelley (author of “Frankenstein”), which hangs on the wall near a crackling fire, Frankie blows a thick layer of dust off his top hat and leaves home (apparently for the first time in ages). Our hero is on his way to redemption.\nAt the border of his property, he picks up a package in the snow that tells us he lives in Milner, EJ, wherever that is. After a long journey through snow covered mountains, he makes his way into the charming village below snuggled between the mountains. I’ll call it ITville (where IT stands for Information Technology).\nHere’s where Apple seeks to pull our heart strings.\n“An unexpected holiday visitor finally receives the warm welcome he’s always yearned for,” reads the ad’s description on YouTube.\nUpon arrival, Frankie walks past 1950s-era cars that make one think “Cuba” and startles the modern-looking people of ITville who are gathered around a tall Christmas tree in front of a church. Lights spiral from the bottom to top of the tall, skinny tree. The church glows from within, it’s circular glass portal illluminated.\nJudging by their gasps, the Christ-believing (as evidenced by the Xmas Tree) residents of ITville apparently have never seen a real-life 8-foot tall giant before. A father holds his terrified young daughter tight.\nWho knows? Maybe they heard stories about the giant, green-skinned ‘alien’ ogre living in the hill overlooking them. Maybe they read the Bible stories of giant fabricated beings or heard about them on ANCIENT ALIENS. Maybe they believed the stories. Maybe they didn’t. No matter. Here he is. Frankie is in ITville.\nFrankie expected a cold reaction. And, he got it. The village people are stunned, terrified and horrified at the abhorrent monster’s appearance. They judge him. The look on their faces says they hate him.\nThe men know he’s more powerful than they are. He could smash them all, if he chose. He is massive in their presence. They fear him.\nJust as Frankie fears them .\nHumans, he knows, are often devils in disguise. They are callous. Separated from spirit, they don’t know that Spirit knows no color bar and seeks unity, not diversity. Frankie knows humans are bigots who hate the wretched and different. Their mob mind is dangerous.\nTo make matters worse, the good people of ITville appear to be unaware of how their world has changed.\nThey live in the past (hence the old cars), apparently ignorant that the Artificial Intelligence machines they have created are now taking on a life of their own…or, as in the case of Google’s A.I. , can learn on their own…and will soon confront humanity.\nYes, folks, machines are gaining intelligence, if not consciousness (awareness).\nWelcome to ITville.\nLittle do the people of ITville realize, that in his isolation (left to his own Apple devices), Frankie, again a manufactured being, has taken on a spirit (the Holiday Spirit) and that, in this spirit, he is docile and incomplete (just like them), but he is also in a state of love.\nSo, yes, Frankie is taking a huge risk in leaving his cozy cabin above ITville and engaging the human monsters (who, themselves, were made about of the same ‘clay’ as he, only his parts were ‘dead’, meaning they no longer contained Spirit).\nIt is Judgment Day for the people of ITville and for Frankie.\nTwo worlds are colliding.\nFrankie is standing in ITville.\nThe humans are there.\nOnly one of them will survive.\nWHAT TO DO? What is Frankie to do? Fight and kill them all, and let God sort the callous hearts from the pure?\nSure. He could do that.\nAlternatively, Frankie could introduce himself (his real name is “Adam”, the “Fallen Angel” in Mary Shelley’s original telling of the tale) and have a deep philosophical conversation about whether or not he is just another version of the villagers (after all, he was created by one of them, Dr. Frankenstein) and ask them to grant him compassion and permission to live along side them?\nSure. He could do that, too.\nInstead, Frankie looks the beastly humans in the eye and shows them what kind of being he is (more than a just a humanoid fabricated from spare inanimate parts) and what he can do.\nHe follows the commandments to love with all his heart, all his mind and all his soul and to love his brothers and sisters (even if they are only human) as himself, by singing them a song and and leaving them at peace.\nNote to the readers who like to read the esoteric symbolism woven into the ad. As he sings, Frankie stands in front of / in place of the Christmas tree, which some people believe have magical powers.\nIn pagan times, it was believed that nasty spirits could enter a home between December 25 and mid-January (the coldest days of the year). To combat these negative entities homes were decorated with evergreens as symbols of protection. These evergreens were alight with candles, a theurgic (white magic) technique for “lighting up” dark spaces and returning them to light. Passion plays telling of the “Paradise Tree” in the Garden of Eden were popular in many parts of Europe. A fir or evergreen (pine) tree with apples symbolized this tree. In early Christianity, apples and candles remained only now the candles represented the light of Christ absolving the “fall of man”. It is for this reason that the Christmas tree symbolizes Christ’s birth, life, rebirth and resurrection. It is the reason for the season.\nAnd resurrection is where Apple’s Adam (“Frankie”) Frankenstein is headed.\nHe is about to enter a new season of his life.\nThis is where the package he picked up outside his home comes in. Frankie opens it and reveals two “old-fashioned” or retro-style candle flame-shaped Christmas tree lights. One red (color of the apples of the Tree of Paradise), the other green (color of evergreen plants).\nHe lights up the village people by screwing the bulbs into his neck (where Boris Karloff’s bolts are supposed to be), hinting that his body is augmentable. He’s got bolt holes. Why, (one day) even Apple’s dongles can be plugged in to his body. But, we are getting ahead of our story.\nNext, Frankie flashes his trusty iPhone 7, clears his throat, and begins mumbling / singing “Home for the Holidays”.\nLike his voice, his effort falls flat and trails away into the mountains.\nIt is the lowest moment of the ad.\nFeeling a failure and the onset of sudden death by a bad decision, Frankie looks confused about what to do next.\nResurrection occurs when a young ITville girl waves for him to approach her.\nComplying,\nFrankie steps forward.\nThe men of the town do nothing as the towering monster approaches the helpless young girl.\nHe could scoop her up like King Kong if he wanted to…\nInstead, Frankie kneels or bows to her.\nShe reaches up and flicks the green (= “go”) bulb.\nTwo worlds collide.\nFrankie reboots.\nIn response, three (“wise”?) men of the town (Apple stockholders? Board members?) mutter something unintelligible amongst themselves, but still do nothing (pussies?)\nNext, the young girl, who is obviously the purest and the bravest citizen of ITville (or its most technologically adept), leads Frankie deeper into the song, singing with a British accent.\nYes, the children will lead the way into the kingdom of heaven…and acceptance of technology.\nBefore we know it, the ITvillage people are all singing along with him.\nFrankie is reduced to tears.\nHe is ‘home and dry’ now.\nHe has crossed the forbidden boundary.\nHe is among the it-turns-out-not-so-monstrous humans.\n“Open your heart to everyone” says the tagline.\nAND THE MEANING IS? Apple’s commercial is truly heartwarming.\nI would love to see more “Frankie Goes to ITville” episodes to see how they think his relationship with humans would / could develop.\nIf sitting at a creative or engineering meeting at Apple, I would like to ask just exactly how they think an inanimate creature like Frankie suddenly got the Holiday (Christ Mass) Spirit?\nWhat happened?\nAnswering this question is of utmost importance to all of humanity.\nMachines and inanimate objects are not supposed to have that ability. Does Apple believe its machines can have spirit? If so, how?\nSecondly, I’d like to know what Frankenstein’s monster has to do with Christmas or the Holidays.\nAs I see it, the answer is nothing (unless we accept the new commercial union /blurring of HalloweenThanksgivingChristmas and the rebranding of this time period as ‘the Holiday Buying Season’, preferably celebrated on Black Friday and Cyber Monday).\nApple has loads of options in terms of Christmas characters, symbols or motifs it can use to sell its products.\nImagine a commercial that opens in a desert. Orion twinkles above. Three Wise Men answer the call of a star that miraculously shoots across the sky above. They follow the star to Silicon Valley, ITville, where a young girl gives birth to a luminous baby and whips out an iPhone 7 to take the first picture of the newly arrived star child.\nHow about a story about a monstrous elf who learns to bring love to the world through Apple’s technology?\nOr a transhuman Santa who demos phenomenal new Apple products (instead of ‘Frankensteined’ versions of old shit Apple’s customers complain it is currently selling)? How about those roll up computers?\nForget about Christmas or the Holiday Season, Frankie’s story isn’t even true to Mary Shelley’s original story.\nApple’s commercial is derivative of Jim Carey’s “Grinch Who Stole Christmas”. Garrett’s Frankenstein even looks like the Grinch (Monster) who lived on the mountain top above Whoville and pined for human interaction. A little girl named Cindy Who reached out to him and offered companionship and warmth.\nSo, again, what does Apple’s message have to do with the Holidays, let alone selling computers and phones for cold, hard cash?\nThe answer is nothing. This is because the ad seeks to sell you something else.\nThe something else comes when we take a closer look at the Frankenstein story.\nFRANKENSTEIN or THE MODERN PROMETHEUS English author, Mary Shelley, wrote the story of Dr. Frankenstein and his creation or offspring in 1818. Titled “Frankenstein ; or The Modern Prometheus”, she explores the angst of Dr. Frankenstein who creates a being she calls a “wretch,” “creature”, “monster,” “demon” and “it.” Speaking to his creator, the nameless being refers to himself as “the Adam of your labors”, and as someone who “would have” been “your Adam”, but is instead “your fallen angel.”\nSays Wikipedia , in Shelley’s original work, Dr. Frankenstein discovers a previously unknown but elemental principle of life, and that insight allows him to develop a method to imbue vitality into inanimate matter, though the exact nature of the process is left largely ambiguous.\nAfter a great deal of hesitation in exercising this power, Dr. F spends two years painstakingly constructing the creature’s body (one anatomical feature at a time, from raw materials supplied by “the dissecting room and the slaughter-house”), which he then brings to life using his unspecified process (in the films it is electricity).\nThe novel’s subtitle, The Modern Prometheus, comes from Greek mythology. Prometheus was the Titan who created mankind at the behest of Zeus. He made a being out of the clay of the earth in the image of the gods that could have a spirit breathed into it (by the goddess Athena). He did this after the Great Deluge had wiped out mankind.\nThe story of Prometheus is the story of the repopulating of the world after this cataclysm and against the wishes of Zeus, the chairman of the board of the Greek pantheon. In other words, it is the story of our race.\nIn the story, Prometheus traveled to the heart of the golden sun, where he stole fire, the means of life, from Mount Olympus and gave it to mankind, also against Zeus’ wishes.\nAccording to the German classicist Karl-Martin Dietz, in Hesiod’s scriptures, Prometheus represents the “descent of mankind from the communion with the gods into the present troublesome life.”\nThe Judeo-Christian equivalent of this myth is Lucifer, who has brought the gift of consciousness to humanity.\nPrometheus rebelled against the gods by first saving humanity and then by bringing humans spirit and with it light or enlightenment.\nThe key esoteric applet in the story of Prometheus is that a divine being can breath spirit into a previously inanimate object, even beings made of clay, like humans.\nAs I have written in The Skingularity Is Near, breathing spirit into their computer products is the ultimate goal of Transhumanists such as Dr. Ray Kurzweil and Steve Jobs.\nPrometheus is very much with us today and he is rising as Silicon Valley giants like Apple try to infuse spirit in their inanimate products and to infuse their technologies in our flesh or what I call the ‘Skingularity’.\nWriters who express caution about the over-enthusiastic embrace of new super technologies, such as Michael Sandel, who worries about human enhancement and genetic engineering, and Clive Hamilton, who worries about geoengineering, sometimes warn us about the ‘Promethean attitude’, or ‘the Promethean urge’.\nThis urge is expressed in Apple’s ad.\nApple knows that upon encountering a human packed with machines — a Transhuman Frankenstein — most humans would react with shock-horror and disdain at the vileness of the wretched new creation. They might seek to destroy him. Or control him.\nIn this commercial, Apple is connecting its product to a Promethean monster who, through its product, gets the holiday spirit…and then teaches humans about it or transmits it to them along the way.\nIs Apple preparing us to stick their dongles in our bolt holes?\nOr are they preparing us for the imminent day when millions of its customers have computer shit sticking out of their neck, their eyes, their ears, other other orifices?\nAPPLE’S LARGER MESSAGE? “It’s a if-it-ain’t-broke-don’t-fix-it type of thing. We do look at this time of year as a time to put out a message larger than product.” Apple’s Vice President of Marketing Tor Myhren told Co. Create in an interview about the brand’s strategy with the ad.\nThe Larger Message I received (and I could be in error) is quite clear.\nApple’s core marketing message is that its products connect us together. This is the human factor it seeks for its products to embody.\nWith “Frankie’s Holiday” Apple may now be signaling that it will connect us with what we previously may have thought of as “monstrous” creations. I speak of the Transhumanist vision in which humans will literally embody computer technologies (such as retinal implants, artificial skin, genetically regenerated organs, etc.).\nIn the Transhumanist future of 2020, the iPhone that is presently held by our hand will be in our eye. The Daily Telegraph says Netflix is now available as a surgical implant .\niEye, or whatever we will call these implants, will bring super-enhanced human capabilities such as 24/7 video recording, night vision, x ray vision and the ability to project any image in front of our face. Not only will we have supervision, but our body will be tapped as a power source and we will also be ‘lit up’ electronically like our phone screen…or a Christmas tree.\nIn this future, Silicon Valley proposes implanting their technology in any and every orifice of your body it can. This will result in the advancement of humanity from homo sapien to transhumans or humans who are part machine or fabricated, just like Frankie.\nWhat is not being advertised, or even discussed, is that when the iEye is implanted in our eye, it’s “Aye aye-dios” to our free will and definition as humans and “Aye aye, sir” to our corporate masters under whose supervision this ‘supervision’ will put us under direct control.\nThis is likely where Apple came up with the Frankenstein idea. It’s not hard to see once one realizes that, like most of Silicon Valley, Apple’s engineers are the new Dr. Frankenstein’s, only they are longevity and human = machine business. The trade-off for their promise of living past 200 years and having the IQ of 10 Einsteins combined is that we must comply with their demands for access to our bodies, our minds and our hearts.\nLOVE, FRANKIE Apple is heroically and admirably advocating that all the Frankies of the world, even manufactured transhumans, deserve to be loved…as, of course, they do.\nDon’t they?\nWhat do you think?\nIt is strange that Apple would tie its brand to a monster or that it would send this message, unless it is time for the company to begin rolling out their transhuman products.\nIf so, it is time for the rest of us citizens of ITville to adopt an inclusive attitude toward Dr. Frankenstein’s, excuse me, Apple’s, and Silicon Valley’s “next human”, which will soon be seen on our streets.\nOr not.\nApple is saying that the monster has arrived. And the people of ITville will love it.\nWill you?\nHow aware are you of the accelerating advances in technology aimed at your body?\nThe thing is, most viewers are likely not as up on the Transhumanist agenda as perhaps they should be. Therefore, they missed the blatant message sent by Apple.\nFrankie is best of Apple or how Apple apparently thinks of itself. It is as if Apple is saying Apple = Dr. Frankenstein and the iPhone 7 = the hybrid monster.\nWhat is it about the iPhone 7 that Apple does not want us to fear? What could be scary about a phone?\nApple is by no means the only Silicon Valley giant to adopt the viewpoint that technology is scary and we must change in order to embrace it.\nIn 2014, GE released a spot called “ Ideas Are Scary ” and features a semi-cuddly, semi-bizarre creature (“the scary idea”) who is rejected by cold-hearted humanity and finds itself homeless. But then, one day, the alien-like creature wanders by a GE office, where a nice GEek invites him in and gives him a chance to unfurl his feathers and to shine. The message is “ideas are scary, but human beings are scarier…unless bring advanced technology that GE can turn into dollars.\n\nYes, good people of ITville, there are scary monsters out there.\nSome are human.\nSome are transhumans and are preparing to come off the work benches in Silicon Valley.\nWill we love or fear these monsters?\nI don’t know.\nOne thing I do know. Spirit will meet us where we are.\nWe are all free to choose how we will meet it.\nMerry Christmas and Happy Holidays.\nWilliam Henry is a Nashville-based author, investigative mythologist, and TV presenter.

      "title": "In a win for consumers, ACCC rules against the banks' actions against Apple Pay",
      "text": "Republish our articles for free, online or in print, under Creative Commons licence. Banks Not Supported. Author \nThree of Australia’s major banks have been prevented from collectively negotiating with Apple over the use of Apple Pay. The National Australia Bank, Commonwealth Bank of Australia, Westpac Banking Corporation, and the regional Bendigo and Adelaide bank, who collectively control 70% of Australia’s card payments had asked the Australian Competition & Consumer Commission (ACCC) to be allowed to challenge Apple collectively, arguing that Apple was stifling innovation by preventing the banks from offering their own digital payment apps through Apple’s mobile devices. The real sticking point however was likely to have been the insistence that Apple’s fees for Apple Pay could not be passed on to customers. \nThe ACCC ultimately disagreed with the banks that their action would be in the public’s interest. In a draft ruling , the ACCC declared that there was not sufficient evidence for this possible harm given that there were alternatives to Apple’s devices and to Apple Pay itself. \nOf more relevance, if the banks were allowed to collude and collectively negotiate, there would be the danger of reduced competition between them. The ACCC argued that this would definitely be against the public’s interests. \nIn summary, the ACCC found that: Apple was not a monopoly supplier of mobile phones, accounting for only 36% of smart phones in Australia Australians are already used to using cards for tap and go payments and so it is not clear how popular using the phone instead will be Whilst Apple had an advantage in controlling the mobile phone hardware and software, the banks controlled most aspects of the payment chain Whilst there may be benefits to the banks getting direct access to the NFC chip, it was not clear how much of an advantage that was over workarounds such as; incorporating Apple Pay in their digital wallet, using an external NFC tag, or simply just supporting Android There was unclear benefits from being able to pass fees onto the public \nFinally, and most interestingly, the ACCC argued that forcing Apple to be more like Android would actually distort the competition between mobile phone operating systems. Essentially they argued that people use Apple phones because of the very features the banks were trying to force them to change. \nAt the time of the original application to the ACCC, only ANZ and American Express were offering Apple Pay. This situation changed during the course of the adjudication process with payments provider Cuscal announcing that a further 31 financial institutions would be offering Apple Pay to their customers. \nThis move further isolated the banks holding out and highlighted that their delay in offering not only Apple Pay, but Samsung Pay and Android Pay was harming nobody other than their own customers. \nThis move by the banks was always motivated by their reluctance to give up any of the AU $1.4 billion of annual revenue that they currently make from credit card fees. \nConsumers already pay multiple times for their credit card use. There are the annual costs of the cards depending on the type and then there are the optional charges that retailers add when cards are used. If these costs are not explicitly added to transactions they are often added to the product cost. The idea that customers would need to pay additionally to use a phone rather than their card would have guaranteed that phones wold not be used for payments. It would have also meant extra charges for using Apple Pay on the web as Apple users can now do instead of using other payment systems like PayPal. \nThe argument that Apple Pay represents a barrier to innovation in the mobile space is a weak one. The missing functionality in the consumer finance app space is not the actual payment system but the use of the data that is generated through these payments. Banks in other countries have understood this. Finland’s OP-Pohjola bank for example has released a digital wallet app called Pivo which provides data about spending, balances and analysis of the customer’s financial situation. Nearly 5 million people use the Swedish payment app Swish to transfer cash instantly and to make payments in stores. Swish succeeds because of the instantaneous transfer of money from one account to another rather than anything to do with technology associated with the payments. \nAustralian banks at best provide next day payment to other financial institutions. Credit card transactions can take up to 3 days to appear in apps. It is this type of functionality that customers want from their banks, not for them to replace what already works well through a native interface. \nThe decision by the ACCC doesn’t necessarily mean that the 3 banks are going to now support Apple Pay but at least it removes a very large reason for them not to. At least with the decision by Cuscal, there are many more options in terms of other banks that now support payments through Apple Pay and more options for customers to switch accounts to.",
