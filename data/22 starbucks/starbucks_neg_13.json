      "text": "Close Fired Starbucks barista's tell-all confession goes viral Photos taken by a barista at a Starbucks in Elk Grove showing trash and a dirty steam wand goes viral. (Nov. 29, 2016) Gabrielle Karol, KXTV 8:31 PM. EST November 29, 2016 (Photo: Karol, Gabrielle) \nA Facebook post from a fired Elk Grove Starbucks barista is going viral. \nSince Christian Brown posted his rant on Nov. 27, his photos and confessions have been shared 3,400 times, with the post receiving 1,600 comments. \n“I’ve worked a shift or two at other Starbucks, and I’ve never seen anything this bad,” Brown explained. \nIn the post, Brown's pictures show trash and food littering the floor behind the counter, a fly trap covered in flies and a dirty milk steamer that had turned brown. Brown made other claims about the cleanliness at the Bond Rd. location in Elk Grove, adding that the standards had taken a turn for the worse since new management had taken over. \n“For five bucks for a cup of coffee, you deserve more than this,” Starbucks customer Luis Espinoza said, after seeing the pictures. \nBrown said the photos were taken roughly three months ago, when he was about to start cleaning the facility during his shift. \n“The problem is with them being that dirty,” Brown said, adding that a little bit of clutter is to be expected. \nThe Bond Rd. Starbucks passed state health inspections as recently as Oct. 26, 2016. Starbucks spokesman Reggie Borges said the company was aware of Brown’s claims but had done a thorough investigation of the store. \n“We’re disappointed that this former partner was interested in portraying this store in a bad light. We’ve made several visits and are confident this is not a regular issue,” Borges added. \nThe Facebook post has led many commenters to say they’ll be quitting Starbucks for good. But Brown said from what he’s seen, most Starbucks are run well. \n“It was really when new management went in that things started being bad,” he said. \nCopyright 2016 KXTV ",

      "text": "  A redesign may make those Starbucks cups recyclable after all. \nTaking a cup of java to-go is the daily morning routine for millions of workers worldwide. But the problem with takeaway coffee, popularized by chains such as Starbucks , is those pesky disposable cups. \nMost of them are made of paper with a thin layer of plastic, which succeeds quite well in keeping beverages warm and cups unsodden. But the result is that recycling these cups is almost impossible in most municipalities, as the paper-plastic combination makes them very difficult to reprocess into new materials. The amount of single-use cups that end in landfills depends on the source cited, but CNN suggested as many as 60 billion are thrown away each year. \nFor years, coffee chains like Starbucks declined to take responsibility for this problem, saying the patchwork of recycling solutions from town-to-town and state-to-state is the issue. \nA company in the United Kingdom, however, says it has a solution to the disposable coffee cup conundrum. And a trial run of its products in Australia may reveal the answer for waste diversion efforts worldwide. \nSimply Cups designed a single-use cup that still uses the paper-plastic combination. But the difference is that the company says it has two methods of treating these used cups. Either the paper fiber and polyethylene lining can be separated, or the entire cup can be completely reprocessed into a polymer for use in products such as trays and coasters. Simply Cups also operates a used cup collection service , giving customers and businesses an opportunity to be part of a closed-loop system. \nAccording to Singapore-based Eco-Business , the outcome of a four-week pilot project suggests that such a closed-loop system could scale in Australia. Led by the waste management consultancy Closed Loop Environmental Solutions of Melbourne, the project involved placing special bins at office buildings in three large Australian cities to collect used coffee cups. \nThe program gathered over 12,000 coffee cups. For now, the pitched cups are being displayed in order to impart the value of recycling. The cups will eventually be recycled; in the meantime, Closed Loop’s team and municipal officials will complete further study on how to make the economic case for a dedicated recycling facility. Closed Loop says the four-week pilot shows consumers are willing part of a zero-waste system if given a dedicated bin for disposable coffee cups. \nThe pilot in Australia mirrors similar efforts worldwide to divert more coffee cups from landfill. This summer, companies including McDonald’s, KFC, Starbucks, and the British coffee chains Caffé Nero and Costa announced a “ paper cup manifesto ” that promised to increase paper cup recycling rates. \nOne company seizing opportunity from this pledge is Frugalpac , which manufactures paper cups with easily-removable plastic liners inside. After the liner is removed during processing, the paper can be recycled up to seven times, mostly to create newsprint, the company says. Meanwhile, coffee chain Costa says it will accept coffee cups at any of its U.K. locations in order to boost recycling efforts. \nCertainly, there is nowhere for these cups’ recycling rates to go but up: The Times of London suggested earlier this year that only 1 in 400 coffee cups is recycled. \nImage credit: David Atkinson/ Flickr",

      "text": "Pornography Easily Accessed Through Starbucks Wi-Fi, Say UK Citizens \nBut what is known is that the coffee shop is not officially affiliated with the pastor's church but was given startup funding by the church in order to create a location \"where believers could interact with non-believers in a safe and friendly environment to convey the Gospel in a non-confrontational manner in word and deed.\" Additionally, all the coffee shop's board members are members of the unnamed pastor's church. \nThe private letter ruling states that the coffee shop's executive summary explains that the coffee shop will give away 100 percent of its profits, not including the money needed for capital expenditures, \"to community ministries, other local, national or international non-profits or organizations, or those in financial need.\" \nDespite the evangelistic and charitable purpose behind the coffee shop, the IRS rejected the coffee shop's application to become a 501(c)(3) tax-exempt non-profit organization because the business model too closely mirrors that of a for-profit coffee shop. \n\"Specifically, the facts show you are not operated exclusively for Section 501(c)(3) purpose because a substantial portion of your activities consists of the operation of a coffee shop in a commercial manner,\" the letter ruling asserts. \n\"You are open to the public Monday through Friday from 6 a.m. to 8 p.m. and Saturday from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m. You have free WiFi and power outlets throughout for customer use. You have space that can be used for gatherings such as meetings and parties. You have a selection of food and beverage items that can be purchased at the coffee shop,\" the letter continued. \"Your hours and menu can be found on your website and your Executive Summary indicates that you believe the location of the coffee shop is ideal because there are no other similar businesses downtown. Therefore, the operation of your coffee shop to raise funds is a commercial activity, not a charitable activity.\" \nWhile some might find the IRS' decision to deny this coffee shop charity tax-exempt status surprising, the decision does not come as a surprise to Chuck Bomar, the pastor of the three-congregation Colossae Church in Oregon. Colossae Church runs its own affiliated coffee shop called Well & Good Coffee House in Tigard, Ore. and donates 100 percent of its profits towards needs in the city. \n\"The bottomline is that [such] a 501(c)(3)'s primary function has to be religious,\" Bomar told The Christian Post over the phone on Monday. \"So, he was misinformed or he is living in an ideal world, whoever this person is. You can't do that. It was no surprise that he was denied, especially when everything lines up the exact same as every other for-profit coffee shop.\" \nBomar explained that although Well & Good Coffee House is technically a \"Doing Business As\" entity of Colossae Church, the coffee shop still pays income and property taxes because the coffee shop's primary function is commercial. \n\"The heart behind it doesn't matter to the government. It is a daily function that matters,\" Bomar explained. \"Because the daily function isn't religious, the heart of it doesn't matter in the corporate structure of it.\" Sponsored Watch Your Favorite Christian Films, 24/7.

      "text": "Close Fired Starbucks barista's tell-all confession goes viral Photos taken by a barista at a Starbucks in Elk Grove showing trash and a dirty steam wand goes viral. (Nov. 29, 2016) Gabrielle Karol, KXTV 7:31 PM. CST November 29, 2016 (Photo: Karol, Gabrielle) \nA Facebook post from a fired Elk Grove Starbucks barista is going viral. \nSince Christian Brown posted his rant on Nov. 27, his photos and confessions have been shared 3,400 times, with the post receiving 1,600 comments. \n“I’ve worked a shift or two at other Starbucks, and I’ve never seen anything this bad,” Brown explained. \nIn the post, Brown's pictures show trash and food littering the floor behind the counter, a fly trap covered in flies and a dirty milk steamer that had turned brown. Brown made other claims about the cleanliness at the Bond Rd. location in Elk Grove, adding that the standards had taken a turn for the worse since new management had taken over. \n“For five bucks for a cup of coffee, you deserve more than this,” Starbucks customer Luis Espinoza said, after seeing the pictures. \nBrown said the photos were taken roughly three months ago, when he was about to start cleaning the facility during his shift. \n“The problem is with them being that dirty,” Brown said, adding that a little bit of clutter is to be expected. \nThe Bond Rd. Starbucks passed state health inspections as recently as Oct. 26, 2016. Starbucks spokesman Reggie Borges said the company was aware of Brown’s claims but had done a thorough investigation of the store. \n“We’re disappointed that this former partner was interested in portraying this store in a bad light. We’ve made several visits and are confident this is not a regular issue,” Borges added. \nThe Facebook post has led many commenters to say they’ll be quitting Starbucks for good. But Brown said from what he’s seen, most Starbucks are run well. \n“It was really when new management went in that things started being bad,” he said. \nCopyright 2016 KXTV ",

It's a fantastic addition to a morning coffee or afternoon pick-me-up when the temps are cool outside and you want to get into the cozy holiday spirit. Many of our fellow coffee lovers look forward to the seasonal release of Starbucks' peppermint mocha , but we don't love the nutritional facts behind that holiday favorite. So we decided to create our own healthier alternative that boasts minty flavor while saving you calories, fat, and sugar. Here's how our healthy homemade recipe compares nutritionally to Starbucks' popular drink:\nUsing our homemade peppermint mocha latte recipe, you avoid consuming unnecessary ingredients like imitation vanilla and soy lecithin. You also end up saving 179 calories, 6.9 grams of fat, and 18 grams of sugar. Plus, you save gas when you avoid the trip to the coffee store. If that's not sweet, we don't know what is.\nIf you're in store and still crave that chocolaty-minty coffee delight, here are a few things you can do to lower your calorie total:\n- Skip the whip. The fluffy topper is tempting, but if you skip it, you'll save 60 calories and 2 grams of sugar.\n- Swap the dairy. Instead of 2% milk, ask for nonfat, and you'll save 20 more calories.\n- Total: 160 calories, 1g sat fat, 26g sugar\nRELATED: #TrumpCup campaign hits Starbucks, draws questions\nClick to expand Replay Video 2 Reasons Vaseline Should Be Every Beauty Lover’s Secret Weapon Learn clever ways to use vaseline you've never thought of.

      "text": "Tweet \nIf you need help to get into the festive spirit, and an Eggnog Latte from Starbucks isn’t quite cutting it, perhaps transforming a Raspberry Pi into an illuminated 3D Christmas tree will do the trick. \nThe Pi Hut has created a Christmas tree board kit that you simply assemble and plug into your Pi. Once done, sit back and feel the joys of the holiday season as they come rushing towards you. Ho, ho, and indeed ho. \nThe tree offers 25 individually controlled LEDs -- 24 red and one white (for the star on top), and hidden \"stars\" cut at different PCB depths to let the LEDs shine through the tree. There's also a \"To / From\" section on the board edge if you want to give it to someone as an early Christmas gift. \nThe kit contains the following: 1 x 3D Tree PCB 24 x Red 3mm LED 1 x White 3mm LED 25 x 120 ohm resistors 1 x Right angle 2x20 header 1 x Right angle 20 way snap off headers \nThe 3D Xmas Tree Kit for Raspberry Pi is priced at £10 (around $12) and you can get it from here . It’s currently listed as being sold out, but it’s actually in production now. If you want one, click the Notify Me button and you’ll be alerted when it goes into stock.",

      "text": "| Follow About | \nCIO.com's resident reviewer, tech addict and fitness fanatic James A. Martin puts the latest apps, mobile devices, health gadgets and wearable technologies through the paces. Opinion Qapital app saves money when you sleep or go to Starbucks If you have a New Year's resolution to save more money, the Qapital app for Android and iOS can help. It's easy to set up and use, and it automatically socks money away towards financial goals.  00   There was an error emailing this page. Credit: Thinkstock 4 great gifts for mobile professionals \nSaving money probably is not top of mind during the annual spending orgy known as \"The Holidays.\" However, if you're making plans for 2017, especially for leisure travel, the free Qapital app for Android and iOS could come in handy. \nQapital automatically stashes a small amount of money into a savings account whenever you use a designated credit or debit card. The service rounds up purchase amounts to the next dollar or two. If you spend $30.70, for instance, Qapital socks away $1.30 into your connected bank account. The savings add up quickly, too; in just a few weeks, I saved $68 and didn't even notice. \nQapital is free, and because just about every app today needs a social component, you can save along with other people. Qapital rules and 'guilty pleasures' \nQapital lets you set specific savings goals, such as \"go somewhere,\" \"get something,\" or \"pay off debts.\" You can customize each goal with a name, such as \"Europe summer 2017,\" a total amount you want to save, and specific \"active rules.\" Qapital Inc. \nI chose the \"round-up rule,\" which automatically rounds up dollar amounts. Other rules include the \"guilty pleasure rule,\" which sets aside savings whenever \"you buy things you're trying to resist.\" Qapital sees previous purchases made using your designated debit or credit card, so you can choose from a list of places, such as McDonalds or Starbucks, within the app. Every time you make a purchase there, the dollar amount you specified goes into your savings account. Qapital works with IFTTT \nQapital plays well with the popular IFTTT service, too, which lets you trigger certain follow up actions when you use another app to initiate them. I first stumbled upon Qapital a few weeks ago, when I was researching cool IFTTT \"applets\" for the holidays . \nUsing the IFTTT connection, whenever I hit my daily 10,000 step goal on Fitbit, Qapital automatically saves a dollar toward a possible Europe trip next summer. Other intriguing IFTTT and Qapital applets add to your savings whenever you get a desired amount of sleep (as recorded by Fitbit or Jawbone ) or check in on Foursquare . Qapital and security \nYou're probably wondering about Qapital security, and the company's security page may put your mind at ease. \nYour savings comes with FDIC insurance of up to $250,000 per person. The app stores saved funds at Wells Fargo — depending on your view of that financial institution, that could be either comforting or a turnoff. \nThe app verifies accounts to prevent unauthorized access, and the company says it uses \"the latest and strongest\" SSL and TLS encryption standards. You can also enable a passcode lock and Touch ID authentication, if you use a compatible Apple device. \nQapital isn't the only app that wants to make saving easy and painless. Simple Bank is a direct competitor, though it's more of a full-service bank than a savings app. \nIf you're happy with your current bank and just want to stash away a buck here or there, you'll appreciate Qapital.

      "text": "Real Estate Why Starbucks cups always stir up controversy Starbucks holiday cups appear on display at a store in New York. Snowflakes, reindeer and candy canes are back on Starbucks holiday coffee cups, after last year's plain red cups caused uproar from critics who said the chain was part of a so-called war on Christmas. (Joseph Pisani/Associated Press) Pedestrians walk past a Starbucks coffee shop in New York; the coffee company is targeted every holiday season for its politics. (Victor J. Blue/Bloomberg) \nBy Maura Judkis, The Washington Post \n 00 AM A A \nThe culture wars come every December, fueled by peppermint mochas and venti soy lattes. The battleground is Starbucks. It’s always Starbucks, isn’t it? No one is complaining that the blue-and-brown holiday cups at Caribou Coffee take the “Christ” out of Christmas. No one is telling the Olive Garden hostess that their name is “Trump” so that she will have to call out “Trump, party of three!” \nReligion. Politics. The Bill of Rights. They all converge here, in front of a glass case full of cake pops. \nThe company’s current foray into the headlines comes from several Trump-related incidents in stores over the past couple of weeks. On Nov. 16, a video of Miami real estate remodeler David Sanguesa berating a Starbucks employee whom he claimed refused to serve him because he was a Trump supporter went viral. (A witness said that Sanguesa got angry that his coffee order took too long.) “We want nothing to do with you,” he told the barista, who appears to be a person of color. “You’re trash.” \nTwo days later, political consultant Tim Treadstone posted a video of Starbucks employees allegedly calling the police on a man who insisted that baristas write “Trump” on his cup. “Operation TrumpCup” was born: Treadstone encouraged Trump supporters to go to Starbucks, give their name as Trump, and take video if the barista refused to use the name. \n“We have a culture war to win. I’m a Trump supporter. I thought when Trump won, I might just wake up and America would be great again. Guess what, it wasn’t,” Treadstone told The Washington Post. “Obviously, a lot of people aren’t happy with us, and we need to stand up for our freedom and our First Amendment.” \nThe First Amendment protects your right to speech and expression without government interference. But it does not protect against interference by private businesses, such as Starbucks. Besides, taking customers’ names is not even official company policy. It’s “a fun ritual in our stores,” said spokesman Reggie Borges, who said that Starbucks does not require employees to call out names. \nThe movement is an “attempt to troll (Starbucks’s) famously liberal baristas into being hypocritical in some fashion: to refuse to serve a customer in the same way that some opponents of same-sex marriage want to refuse service to gay couples,” said Erik Owens, interim director of the Boisi Center for Religion and American Public Life at Boston College. \nTrumpCup is a spinoff of a movement called MerryChristmasStarbucks, which Joshua Feuerstein, an evangelical social media personality, started in 2015 when Starbucks released a minimalist red cup that people criticized for being too plain — a design that Starbucks intended as a blank-slate holiday celebration for all faiths. \n“I felt as though a point needed to be made that we as Americans are tired of political correctness and the cultural cleansing of anything related to Jesus (i.e. Christmas),” Feuerstein wrote in an email. \nIn a video, he encouraged his followers to go to Starbucks and give their names as Merry Christmas, so that baristas would write it on the cup. Feuerstein’s video alleged that Starbucks employees are instructed not to say “Merry Christmas.” Borges denied that: “Our baristas are not provided a script or a policy around greeting customers,” he said. \nThe movement caught on, and even President-elect Donald Trump, then one of 14 candidates in the Republican primary field, jumped into the fray. \n“That’s the end of that lease,” he said at a rally, referring to the Starbucks in Trump Tower. “If I become president, we’re all going to be saying ‘Merry Christmas’ again, that I can tell you.” \nIronically, instead of boycotting the business, many of the Starbucks-related social media movements involve mobilizing people to actually spend money at a company whose views they presumably disagree with. Feuerstein said that his followers “flooded Starbucks to participate” in #MerryChristmasStarbucks. (He did not answer a question asking whether his message outweighed the company’s potential financial gain.) Treadstone was fine with spending money there: “This was never meant to be a boycott,” he told The Post of his call to arms. “I love Starbucks.” \nAs many have pointed out on social media, the people who are offended by Starbucks cups are often the same people who accuse their political rivals of being too sensitive about things like the Confederate flag. \n“It’s a transparent attempt to stir up false conflict in order to rally a certain subset of Christians against so-called liberal culture,” Owens said. \nStarbucks’s holiday cups have often featured nondenominational holiday symbols, such as snowmen and stars. Those images have been politicized, too: In 2011, the company was accused of featuring a nutcracker that looked like the Guy Fawkes mask, then a symbol of Occupy Wall Street. Starbucks said it was a coincidence. \nAnd it is not the only company to stick to bland seasonal greetings. Last year’s McDonald’s cup was purple (!) with an image of a wreath and the phrase “Welcome home.” This year’s design features a Christmas tree, as does the Dunkin’ Donuts cup. \nThe Starbucks design is a lot spiffier this year, too. Inspired by customers who drew on last year’s plain red cups, the company has released a series of elaborate but secular designs — birch trees, snowflakes, strings of holiday lights and Santa with his sleigh. \n“It would have been difficult for us to ignore the feedback from last year, and we take it in stride, both positive and negative,” Borges said. \nMaybe that is why a promotional video features a cup with a drawing of Jesus in the manger — a design that does not appear on any cups in stores. Still, Feuerstein and others seem pleased with the change. \n“Looks like the American people have been heard,” Feuerstein said. “And we not only saved Christmas, we elected Donald Trump as our next president and saved the country!” \nThe idea that something as simple as a Starbucks cup could either save or ruin Christmas would have seemed absurd for much of the company’s history. In the early days, Starbucks was almost snooty, serving espresso to people who were too good for regular drip coffee. It was distinctly Left Coast. Not to mention, it required Americans to learn Italian: The country struggled with words like doppio, venti and macchiato. \nToday, Starbucks has more than 12,000 shops in the United States, and 80 percent of the country lives less than 20 miles from a grande eggnog latte. \n“Starbucks has a broader target, based on the ubiquity of the brand,” said Derek Rucker, a marketing professor at Northwestern University. “With that broader target, you’re more likely to get difference of opinion.” \nPart of the reason Starbucks is a frequent target is because its chief executive, Howard Schultz, is outspoken about his politics. In 2013, he requested that customers not bring guns to his stores, even in states where open carry is permitted. He launched “Race Together,” a widely mocked attempt to start a conversation about race in stores. He endorsed Hillary Clinton for president. And just before the election, Starbucks released a green cup with an illustration of more than 100 people drawn with one continuous line —“a symbol of unity as a reminder of our shared values, and the need to be good to each other,” Schultz said in a news release. People thought it was the holiday cup, and a mass freakout ensued. Schultz, by the way, was raised Jewish. \nBut other companies headed by Democrat-endorsing chief executives have not found themselves in the crosshairs nearly as much. Calls for Republicans to boycott Netflix and Costco did not take off the way that Starbucks protests have. This may be because Starbucks’ history of these types of protests builds upon itself, making the brand a symbolic target for right-wing demonstrators. \n“The stage has almost been set for not only consumers but also media to be sensitive to what Starbucks has done, perhaps more than other brands,” Rucker said. \nIt may also have something to do with consumers’ relationship with the brand. \n“Many of us go to the same coffee shop every day, so when there’s a violation, it’s not so easily overlooked,” Rucker said. Potentially, customers are “more vested in their experience there.” \nCoffee is a ritual, and when it gets political, it is personal. After all, your name is on the cup — except when it’s Trump’s name instead.",

(Nov. 29, 2016) Gabrielle Karol, KXTV 8:31 PM. EST November 29, 2016 (Photo: Karol, Gabrielle) \nA Facebook post from a fired Elk Grove Starbucks barista is going viral. \nSince Christian Brown posted his rant on Nov. 27, his photos and confessions have been shared 3,400 times, with the post receiving 1,600 comments. \n“I’ve worked a shift or two at other Starbucks, and I’ve never seen anything this bad,” Brown explained. \nIn the post, Brown's pictures show trash and food littering the floor behind the counter, a fly trap covered in flies and a dirty milk steamer that had turned brown. Brown made other claims about the cleanliness at the Bond Rd. location in Elk Grove, adding that the standards had taken a turn for the worse since new management had taken over. \n“For five bucks for a cup of coffee, you deserve more than this,” Starbucks customer Luis Espinoza said, after seeing the pictures. \nBrown said the photos were taken roughly three months ago, when he was about to start cleaning the facility during his shift. \n“The problem is with them being that dirty,” Brown said, adding that a little bit of clutter is to be expected. \nThe Bond Rd. Starbucks passed state health inspections as recently as Oct. 26, 2016. Starbucks spokesman Reggie Borges said the company was aware of Brown’s claims but had done a thorough investigation of the store. \n“We’re disappointed that this former partner was interested in portraying this store in a bad light. We’ve made several visits and are confident this is not a regular issue,” Borges added. \nThe Facebook post has led many commenters to say they’ll be quitting Starbucks for good. But Brown said from what he’s seen, most Starbucks are run well. \n“It was really when new management went in that things started being bad,” he said. \nCopyright 2016 KXTV ",

      "title": "Why Starbucks cups always stir up controversy",
      "text": "Why Starbucks cups always stir up controversy Monday Nov 28, 2016 at 4:00 PM Maura Judkis - The Washington Post \nThe culture wars come every December, fueled by peppermint mochas and venti soy lattes. The battleground is Starbucks. It's always Starbucks, isn't it? No one is complaining that the blue-and-brown holiday cups at Caribou Coffee take the \"Christ\" out of Christmas. No one is telling the Olive Garden hostess that their name is \"Trump\" so that she will have to call out \"Trump, party of three!\" \nReligion. Politics. The Bill of Rights. They all converge here, in front of a glass case full of cake pops. \nThe company's current foray into the headlines comes from several Trump-related incidents in stores over the past couple of weeks. On Nov. 16, a video of Miami real estate remodeler David Sanguesa berating a Starbucks employee whom he claimed refused to serve him because he was a Trump supporter went viral. (A witness said that Sanguesa got angry that his coffee order took too long.) \"We want nothing to do with you,\" he told the barista, who appears to be a person of color. \"You're trash.\" \nTwo days later, political consultant Tim Treadstone posted a video of Starbucks employees allegedly calling the police on a man who insisted that baristas write \"Trump\" on his cup. \"Operation #TrumpCup\" was born: Treadstone encouraged Trump supporters to go to Starbucks, give their name as Trump, and take video if the barista refused to use the name. \n\"We have a culture war to win. I'm a Trump supporter. I thought when Trump won, I might just wake up and America would be great again. Guess what, it wasn't,\" Treadstone told The Washington Post. \"Obviously, a lot of people aren't happy with us, and we need to stand up for our freedom and our First Amendment.\" \nThe First Amendment protects your right to speech and expression without government interference. But it does not protect against interference by private businesses, such as Starbucks. Besides, taking customers' names is not even official company policy. It's \"a fun ritual in our stores,\" said spokesman Reggie Borges, who said that Starbucks does not require employees to call out names. \nThe movement is an \"attempt to troll [Starbucks's] famously liberal baristas into being hypocritical in some fashion: to refuse to serve a customer in the same way that some opponents of same-sex marriage want to refuse service to gay couples,\" said Erik Owens, interim director of the Boisi Center for Religion and American Public Life at Boston College. \n#TrumpCup is a spinoff of a movement called #MerryChristmasStarbucks, which Joshua Feuerstein, an evangelical social media personality, started in 2015 when Starbucks released a minimalist red cup that people criticized for being too plain - a design that Starbucks intended as a blank-slate holiday celebration for all faiths. \n\"I felt as though a point needed to be made that we as Americans are tired of political correctness and the cultural cleansing of anything related to Jesus (i.e. Christmas),\" Feuerstein wrote in an email. \nIn a video, he encouraged his followers to go to Starbucks and give their names as Merry Christmas, so that baristas would write it on the cup. Feuerstein's video alleged that Starbucks employees are instructed not to say \"Merry Christmas.\" Borges denied that: \"Our baristas are not provided a script or a policy around greeting customers,\" he said. \nThe movement caught on, and even President-elect Donald Trump, then one of 14 candidates in the Republican primary field, jumped into the fray. \n\"That's the end of that lease,\" he said at a rally, referring to the Starbucks in Trump Tower. \"If I become president, we're all going to be saying 'Merry Christmas' again, that I can tell you.\" \nIronically, instead of boycotting the business, many of the Starbucks-related social media movements involve mobilizing people to actually spend money at a company whose views they presumably disagree with. Feuerstein said that his followers \"flooded Starbucks to participate\" in #MerryChristmasStarbucks. (He did not answer a question asking whether his message outweighed the company's potential financial gain.) Treadstone was fine with spending money there: \"This was never meant to be a boycott,\" he told The Post of his call to arms. \"I love Starbucks.\" \nAs many have pointed out on social media, the people who are offended by Starbucks cups are often the same people who accuse their political rivals of being too sensitive about things like the Confederate flag. \n\"It's a transparent attempt to stir up false conflict in order to rally a certain subset of Christians against so-called liberal culture,\" Owens said. \nStarbucks's holiday cups have often featured nondenominational holiday symbols, such as snowmen and stars. Those images have been politicized, too: In 2011, the company was accused of featuring a nutcracker that looked like the Guy Fawkes mask, then a symbol of Occupy Wall Street. Starbucks said it was a coincidence. \nAnd it is not the only company to stick to bland seasonal greetings. Last year's McDonald's cup was purple (!) with an image of a wreath and the phrase \"Welcome home.\" This year's design features a Christmas tree, as does the Dunkin' Donuts cup. \nThe Starbucks design is a lot spiffier this year, too. Inspired by customers who drew on last year's plain red cups, the company has released a series of elaborate but secular designs - birch trees, snowflakes, strings of holiday lights and Santa with his sleigh. \n\"It would have been difficult for us to ignore the feedback from last year, and we take it in stride, both positive and negative,\" Borges said. \nMaybe that is why a promotional video features a cup with a drawing of Jesus in the manger - a design that does not appear on any cups in stores. Still, Feuerstein and others seem pleased with the change. \n\"Looks like the American people have been heard,\" Feuerstein said. \"And we not only saved Christmas, we elected Donald Trump as our next president and saved the country!\" \nThe idea that something as simple as a Starbucks cup could either save or ruin Christmas would have seemed absurd for much of the company's history. In the early days, Starbucks was almost snooty, serving espresso to people who were too good for regular drip coffee. It was distinctly Left Coast. Not to mention, it required Americans to learn Italian: The country struggled with words like doppio, venti and macchiato. \nToday, Starbucks has more than 12,000 shops in the United States, and 80 percent of the country lives less than 20 miles from a grande eggnog latte. \n\"Starbucks has a broader target, based on the ubiquity of the brand,\" said Derek Rucker, a marketing professor at Northwestern University. \"With that broader target, you're more likely to get difference of opinion.\" \nPart of the reason Starbucks is a frequent target is because its chief executive, Howard Schultz, is outspoken about his politics. In 2013, he requested that customers not bring guns to his stores, even in states where open carry is permitted. He launched \"Race Together,\" a widely mocked attempt to start a conversation about race in stores. He endorsed Hillary Clinton for president. And just before the election, Starbucks released a green cup with an illustration of more than 100 people drawn with one continuous line - \"a symbol of unity as a reminder of our shared values, and the need to be good to each other,\" Schultz said in a news release. People thought it was the holiday cup, and a mass freakout ensued. Schultz, by the way, was raised Jewish. \nBut other companies headed by Democrat-endorsing chief executives have not found themselves in the crosshairs nearly as much. Calls for Republicans to boycott Netflix and Costco did not take off the way that Starbucks protests have. This may be because Starbucks' history of these types of protests builds upon itself, making the brand a symbolic target for right-wing demonstrators. \n\"The stage has almost been set for not only consumers but also media to be sensitive to what Starbucks has done, perhaps more than other brands,\" Rucker said. \nIt may also have something to do with consumers' relationship with the brand. \n\"Many of us go to the same coffee shop every day, so when there's a violation, it's not so easily overlooked,\" Rucker said. Potentially, customers are \"more vested in their experience there.\" \nCoffee is a ritual, and when it gets political, it is personal. After all, your name is on the cup - except when it's Trump's name instead. Author Information: Maura Judkis covers culture, food, and the arts.@MauraJudkis About Us",

      "text": "Why Starbucks cups always stir up controversy Monday Nov 28, 2016 at 4:00 PM Maura Judkis - The Washington Post \nThe culture wars come every December, fueled by peppermint mochas and venti soy lattes. The battleground is Starbucks. It's always Starbucks, isn't it? No one is complaining that the blue-and-brown holiday cups at Caribou Coffee take the \"Christ\" out of Christmas. No one is telling the Olive Garden hostess that their name is \"Trump\" so that she will have to call out \"Trump, party of three!\" \nReligion. Politics. The Bill of Rights. They all converge here, in front of a glass case full of cake pops. \nThe company's current foray into the headlines comes from several Trump-related incidents in stores over the past couple of weeks. On Nov. 16, a video of Miami real estate remodeler David Sanguesa berating a Starbucks employee whom he claimed refused to serve him because he was a Trump supporter went viral. (A witness said that Sanguesa got angry that his coffee order took too long.) \"We want nothing to do with you,\" he told the barista, who appears to be a person of color. \"You're trash.\" \nTwo days later, political consultant Tim Treadstone posted a video of Starbucks employees allegedly calling the police on a man who insisted that baristas write \"Trump\" on his cup. \"Operation #TrumpCup\" was born: Treadstone encouraged Trump supporters to go to Starbucks, give their name as Trump, and take video if the barista refused to use the name. \n\"We have a culture war to win. I'm a Trump supporter. I thought when Trump won, I might just wake up and America would be great again. Guess what, it wasn't,\" Treadstone told The Washington Post. \"Obviously, a lot of people aren't happy with us, and we need to stand up for our freedom and our First Amendment.\" \nThe First Amendment protects your right to speech and expression without government interference. But it does not protect against interference by private businesses, such as Starbucks. Besides, taking customers' names is not even official company policy. It's \"a fun ritual in our stores,\" said spokesman Reggie Borges, who said that Starbucks does not require employees to call out names. \nThe movement is an \"attempt to troll [Starbucks's] famously liberal baristas into being hypocritical in some fashion: to refuse to serve a customer in the same way that some opponents of same-sex marriage want to refuse service to gay couples,\" said Erik Owens, interim director of the Boisi Center for Religion and American Public Life at Boston College. \n#TrumpCup is a spinoff of a movement called #MerryChristmasStarbucks, which Joshua Feuerstein, an evangelical social media personality, started in 2015 when Starbucks released a minimalist red cup that people criticized for being too plain - a design that Starbucks intended as a blank-slate holiday celebration for all faiths. \n\"I felt as though a point needed to be made that we as Americans are tired of political correctness and the cultural cleansing of anything related to Jesus (i.e. Christmas),\" Feuerstein wrote in an email. \nIn a video, he encouraged his followers to go to Starbucks and give their names as Merry Christmas, so that baristas would write it on the cup. Feuerstein's video alleged that Starbucks employees are instructed not to say \"Merry Christmas.\" Borges denied that: \"Our baristas are not provided a script or a policy around greeting customers,\" he said. \nThe movement caught on, and even President-elect Donald Trump, then one of 14 candidates in the Republican primary field, jumped into the fray. \n\"That's the end of that lease,\" he said at a rally, referring to the Starbucks in Trump Tower. \"If I become president, we're all going to be saying 'Merry Christmas' again, that I can tell you.\" \nIronically, instead of boycotting the business, many of the Starbucks-related social media movements involve mobilizing people to actually spend money at a company whose views they presumably disagree with. Feuerstein said that his followers \"flooded Starbucks to participate\" in #MerryChristmasStarbucks. (He did not answer a question asking whether his message outweighed the company's potential financial gain.) Treadstone was fine with spending money there: \"This was never meant to be a boycott,\" he told The Post of his call to arms. \"I love Starbucks.\" \nAs many have pointed out on social media, the people who are offended by Starbucks cups are often the same people who accuse their political rivals of being too sensitive about things like the Confederate flag. \n\"It's a transparent attempt to stir up false conflict in order to rally a certain subset of Christians against so-called liberal culture,\" Owens said. \nStarbucks's holiday cups have often featured nondenominational holiday symbols, such as snowmen and stars. Those images have been politicized, too: In 2011, the company was accused of featuring a nutcracker that looked like the Guy Fawkes mask, then a symbol of Occupy Wall Street. Starbucks said it was a coincidence. \nAnd it is not the only company to stick to bland seasonal greetings. Last year's McDonald's cup was purple (!) with an image of a wreath and the phrase \"Welcome home.\" This year's design features a Christmas tree, as does the Dunkin' Donuts cup. \nThe Starbucks design is a lot spiffier this year, too. Inspired by customers who drew on last year's plain red cups, the company has released a series of elaborate but secular designs - birch trees, snowflakes, strings of holiday lights and Santa with his sleigh. \n\"It would have been difficult for us to ignore the feedback from last year, and we take it in stride, both positive and negative,\" Borges said. \nMaybe that is why a promotional video features a cup with a drawing of Jesus in the manger - a design that does not appear on any cups in stores. Still, Feuerstein and others seem pleased with the change. \n\"Looks like the American people have been heard,\" Feuerstein said. \"And we not only saved Christmas, we elected Donald Trump as our next president and saved the country!\" \nThe idea that something as simple as a Starbucks cup could either save or ruin Christmas would have seemed absurd for much of the company's history. In the early days, Starbucks was almost snooty, serving espresso to people who were too good for regular drip coffee. It was distinctly Left Coast. Not to mention, it required Americans to learn Italian: The country struggled with words like doppio, venti and macchiato. \nToday, Starbucks has more than 12,000 shops in the United States, and 80 percent of the country lives less than 20 miles from a grande eggnog latte. \n\"Starbucks has a broader target, based on the ubiquity of the brand,\" said Derek Rucker, a marketing professor at Northwestern University. \"With that broader target, you're more likely to get difference of opinion.\" \nPart of the reason Starbucks is a frequent target is because its chief executive, Howard Schultz, is outspoken about his politics. In 2013, he requested that customers not bring guns to his stores, even in states where open carry is permitted. He launched \"Race Together,\" a widely mocked attempt to start a conversation about race in stores. He endorsed Hillary Clinton for president. And just before the election, Starbucks released a green cup with an illustration of more than 100 people drawn with one continuous line - \"a symbol of unity as a reminder of our shared values, and the need to be good to each other,\" Schultz said in a news release. People thought it was the holiday cup, and a mass freakout ensued. Schultz, by the way, was raised Jewish. \nBut other companies headed by Democrat-endorsing chief executives have not found themselves in the crosshairs nearly as much. Calls for Republicans to boycott Netflix and Costco did not take off the way that Starbucks protests have. This may be because Starbucks' history of these types of protests builds upon itself, making the brand a symbolic target for right-wing demonstrators. \n\"The stage has almost been set for not only consumers but also media to be sensitive to what Starbucks has done, perhaps more than other brands,\" Rucker said. \nIt may also have something to do with consumers' relationship with the brand. \n\"Many of us go to the same coffee shop every day, so when there's a violation, it's not so easily overlooked,\" Rucker said. Potentially, customers are \"more vested in their experience there.\" \nCoffee is a ritual, and when it gets political, it is personal. After all, your name is on the cup - except when it's Trump's name instead. Author Information: Maura Judkis covers culture, food, and the arts.@MauraJudkis About Us",

      "text": "Trump voter flies into a rage at Starbucks (Twitter) Don't miss stories. Follow Raw Story! Follow @rawstory \nIn recent weeks, viral videos of angry, ranting supporters of Donald Trump have made the rounds, prompting fears in many that under the rule of a Pres. Trump, racist white people will feel even more entitled to inflict their hateful views on people who are different from them. \nAn essay in the New Republic published Wednesday , however, put forth the idea that these videos — and the collective disgust they inspire in us — are actually a sign that the majority of Americans don’t subscribe to the angry, racist ideology that helped propel the former reality TV star to a victory in the U.S. Electoral College. \nVideos of the white woman who went on a 45-minute racist harangue in a Chicago Michael’s crafts store, the man who stood up during a Delta flight and demanded to know if there were any “Hillary b*tches” on board the plane and the angry Florida Starbucks customer who said he was the victim of anti-white discrimination all went viral not because everyone supports these people, but because we as a country are appalled by them. \nAt first blush, wrote New Republic’s Graham Vyse, these videos appear to be confirmation of — as former Republican presidential candidate Gov. Mitt Romney (R-MA) said — evidence of Trump’s “trickle-down racism.” Trump’s open disdain for nonwhites has emboldened a number of his followers and made them more comfortable inflicting their backward, racist views on the people around them. \n“The closer you look, the more you listen, the clearer it is that these bigoted ranters aren’t so much empowered as they are fragile and pathetic,” wrote Vyse. “And what’s gone largely unnoticed is the reactions that the other people in the videos have to their bigoted ravings—reactions that hint at something to be kinda, sorta hopeful about — that non-racist whites have also been woken up by the Trumpian surge of white nationalism.” \nIn the Michael’s video, the Starbucks video and during the incident of the Delta flight, none of these outspoken Trump supporters are met with support by the people around them. The Starbucks customer was told not to “talk to people that way” by another customer. A witness to the Chicago incident started a GoFundMe account for the employees impacted by the angry shopper’s racist harangue. And the man on the Delta flight who called for cheers for Trump was met only with stony silence from other passengers. \nVyse said, “So, yes, these people were acting entitled. In two of the cases, they were engaged in racial harassment. And sure, they’re all displaying petulant and pathetic assertions of white privilege. But they’re also full of what the scholar and author Robin DiAngelo calls ‘white fragility’—‘a state in which even a minimum amount of racial stress becomes intolerable, triggering a range of defensive moves.’” \nHe pointed to the videos and the nation’s reaction to them as a sign that the majority of white Americans are not going to stand by and be “silent partners” to a revival of old school racism and a reassertion of American white supremacy. \nAnti-racism scholar and activist Tim Wise, Vyse said, reports that in addition to an uptick of racist mobilization in the U.S., there has been a corresponding rise in anti-racist activity in the country. \n“Wise said he’s seen more white anti-racist activists in recent years than he has for many decades — and Trumpism has undoubtedly helped them find their voices, too,” wrote Vyse. “In a strange way, these disturbing viral videos can be a gift, showing Americans who we really are—both bad and good. They’re also an challenge to be our best selves, to act in such situations the way we’d hope to be seen on camera.” About the Author David Ferguson is an editor at Raw Story.

      "text": "Like Us On Facebook Like Us On Facebook \nSure, the story of Harry Potter and his gang may have ended five (yes, FIVE) years ago, but that won’t stop us from finding every way to keep the magic alive. \nWe’re getting some new storylines and characters with “ Fantastic Beasts and Where To Find Them ” and “Harry Potter and the Cursed Child.” \nSo let’s pay homage to the squad who started it all by listing what each “Harry Potter” character would be if they were Starbucks drinks. Harry Potter – Double Shot of Espresso Giphy \nWithout espresso , no other drink would work. \nIt keeps everything going strong when the going gets tough, just like Harry. He’s the core of his friend group and makes sure to lead them all in the right direction. \nEven if that direction is headed toward death because, you know, all for the greater good and all. Right? Hermione Granger – Vanilla Latte Giphy \nSweet and effective Hermione would definitely be a vanilla latte. \nIt’s a smart drink because the caffeine level keeps you on your toes, while the vanilla balances the strong espresso punch. Ron Weasley – Cinnamon Dolce Frappuccino Giphy \nAny frap contains a fair amount of calories and sugar — two things Ron Weasley never skips out on.The cinnamon sprinkled on top goes with Ron’s sass, and the frap is as classic as a Molly Weasley Christmas sweater. Albus Dumbledore – Caffe Misto Giphy \nTBH, the word “misto” just sounds Dumbledore-esque. \nThe hot drink is brewed coffee and milk – two staples any coffee-based drink has. Like Dumbledore , the Caffe Misto is always there, even if you may not know it. Sirius Black – Pike Place Roast Giphy \nThe “criminal mastermind” turned “wrongly-convicted criminal mastermind” turned “godfather we wish we had” would be a smoothly blended Pike Place Roast. \nThe cocoa notes give us those warmhearted Sirius vibes, while the stronger roast reminds us of his darker past. Luna Lovegood – The Pink Drink \nThe secret menu drink everyone is freaking out about is known as the “ Pink Drink ,” aka a Strawberry Açaí Refresher with coconut milk. \nOne look at this unique, quirky drink and you’ll know why it screams Luna. Neville Longbottom – Chai Latte Giphy \nIt’s spicy and warms you to the core on a cold, winter day. \nAt the end of the day, a grande chai is the real MVP — like Neville’s extra five points to Gryffindor to win the House Cup. \nPlus, it feels like Neville giving you a hug because you can’t remember what you’ve forgotten. Voldemort – Flat White Giphy \nIs this choice because He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named has no nose? Eh, kinda. \nBut also because the Flat White is a drink that once held a lot of potential and amounted to be nothing short of disappointing. Bellatrix Lestrange – Cold Brew Giphy \nAn iced coffee’s more mature counterpart is the cold brew. \nInstead of starting out hot and being poured over ice, it’s brewed cold. I’m pretty sure Bellatrix was born with a stone cold heart, so the shoe fits. Severus Snape – Caramel Apple Spice Giphy \nNo, it doesn’t have 394 calories, but it does take you right down memory lane. \nAnd if it weren’t for the Pensieve, we wouldn’t really know Snape’s true story of how he came to be who he is.

      "text": "Starbucks' Healthiest Holiday Drink Order We’ll be ordering it every day. Twitter Courtesy of Starbucks \nWe're nothing without our daily Starbucks, and that everyday treat gets a little sweeter around the holidays. Who can resist those red cups, right? It's a sure sign that the holiday season is around the corner, and it gives you that warm, fuzzy feeling — oh, and also a caffeine buzz. All that delicious goodness comes at a price, though, and it's a sugary one. \nSince many Starbucks drinks are packed with sugar, Byrdie points out drinking some of your favorite coffee creations is basically the same as drinking a couple donuts. According to Starbucks' website , a grande pumpkin spice latte has 50 grams of sugar. A grande mocha frappuccino has 62 grams of sugar. Yikes! Luckily, Byrdie has our backs. They looked into what the healthiest holiday order is so you can get your fix without all the sugar. \nNutritionist Lauren O'Connor, RD, CCN, told Byrdie the best drink you can order at Starbucks this holiday season is a short (that's 8 ounces) gingerbread latte with 2% milk, two pumps of syrup and no whipped cream. Of course, no whipped cream and a short drink — smaller than a tall — is a little less fun, but it's exponentially better for you than some of the other drinks on the menu. According to O'Connor, that order clocks in at 2 grams of fat and 16 grams of sugar. \nThis information is handy because we know consuming too much sugar isn't very good for us. One study found sugar intake could be linked to how well we sleep , and another study said sugar is basically poison . Either way, everything in moderation is a pretty good idea. \nIf you're really looking to cut down on calories in your drinks (to make room for more cookies, duh), a grande iced green tea has only 20 grams of sugar, and a classic black coffee has no sugar.",

      "text": "The Ups And Downs; Starbucks Nov.30.16 \nStronger dollar whilst coffee demand continues to increase. \nOverbought and buying pressure evident from technical analysis. \nFundamentals indicate SBUX is profitable and efficient. \nMobile app important for future demand for products and sales figures. Company Background Click to enlarge Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ: SBUX ) is arguably the most well-known brand in coffee. Established in Seattle, Washington, the global coffee giant has just over 25,000 operating stores worldwide. The equity trades at 30.23x earnings, which is a little expensive relative to the overall equity market in the U.S. P/E of 25.46x. Current ratio is at 1 as well. Consolidated Financials In 4Q2016, EPS was at $0.56, which exceeded consensus estimates by $0.01. Revenue figures were also attractive at $5.71B, beating estimates by $300M. Comparable store sales within U.S. borders grew 4%, while Mobile Order and Pay made up 6% of total sales. For the fiscal year of 2017, the company expects to add 2,100 new stores to its global chain. Continued growth in North America, partially due to the new online ordering feature, results in the shortening of lines in brick-and-mortar stores. On top of that, cost efficiency continues to improve due to a decrease in foot traffic. As new minimum wage laws are established; we will see service companies choose cost efficiency to defend their margins from decreasing. Revenues From Mobile App As previously mentioned, the mobile app has been crucial in continuing to improve sales and revenue figures. Monthly mobile app users of the Starbucks app went up to 19 million, up7 million from July 2014. Click to enlarge Source: Statista The Coffee Market Space Although U.S. sales growth contributes greatly to overall growth, the company will have to rely on operations in China to heat up in the next few years. Due to a strong dollar, the growth in China can be offset accompanied by an uptrend of overall coffee consumption since 2010. For the fiscal year of 2016, global consumption was over 150 million bags, with each bag being around 60 kgs. Click to enlarge Coffee Demand Data via Bloomberg With confidence in the demand for coffee, long-term upside is likely for Starbucks. The largest coffee brand in the world is in the spotlight, with increasing operations in the massive consumer market which has had increasing disposable income since the sub-prime mortgage crisis back in 2008. Technical Analysis By using the 20-Day SMA and 50-Day SMA we are confident that the security has been in an uptrend since the election process was completed. The 14-Day Relative Strength Index 'RSI' is over the 70 levels, pointing towards a overbought situation. The equity has not hit the 70 levels in the RSI YTD, hence short-term SMAs indicate that downside is a scenario to consider. SBUX data by YCharts The security has a 20-Day Chaikin Money Flow 'CMF' value of 0.269, meaning that buying pressure is greater than the selling pressure. We can see the spike of the CMF to the buying pressure zone; soaring above 0, following the completion of the election. The CMF illustrates a more conservative buying pressure relative to the RSI findings. SBUX data by YCharts A believe certain valuation metrics are more suitable for evaluating restaurant equities. Debt/Equity: 0.61 - As of September 2016 Most of my peers overlook the Debt-to-Equity ratio by looking at the book value instead. However, by looking at the Debt/Equity value of Starbucks, we get a more clear picture of the degree of risk and leverage that the company. It is a quality indicator for financial solvency; SBUX is in safe territory in that regard. Operating Margin Ratio: 0.25 - As of September 2016 Operating margin indicates efficiency of the company from the standpoint of equity holders and creditors. Hence, the 0.25 metric indicates that SBUX is more efficient than the restaurants industry in the U.S. which has a operating margin ratio of 0.18, as of the third quarter of 2016. U.S. Restaurants Operating Margin Data via CSIMarket Return On Equity - 55.21% ROE indicates how much of net income was returned as a percentage of shareholders equity. The return on equity for SBUX is higher than the restaurants industry average of 41.4. Which puts SBUX at a more profitable stance for shareholders relative to the restaurant industry. U.S. Restaurants Return On Equity Data via CSIMarket Risks With the strengthening dollar as a long-lasting figure among global currencies, further established by Brexit, Starbucks could see damage in global segments outside of the U.S. market. The coffee brand could possibly not gain its fair share from the increasing demand in coffee. Losing market share to global competitors such as McDonald's (NYSE: MCD ) is probable for a downside case. In terms of possible flaws for these predictions, the overbought signal from the RSI could be misleading. Also, fundamental valuation displayed could be misrepresented for the particular security. Conclusion SBUX has been increasing its operations globally while the dollar is strengthening against global currencies. However, coffee demand in the world is increasing and is in a uptrend. Technical signals indicate buying pressure alongside an overbought signal, while my fundamental valuation indicated SBUX was more profitable and more efficient relative to the industry. The mobile app has been gaining more traction and attention in the last three years. From where I stand, SBUX is a buy that still has considerable upside in the short and medium term.

      "text": "185 Posts I know there are couple of threads on this topic already. But I just wanted to share, when I was waiting in line at Starbucks this morning, I saw a girl paying at the register carrying a very fake surly looking Tivoli GM wannabe. The bag looked very plasticky, The handles weren't adjustable, the zipper was cheap looking (with the zipper end tap sticking out!) The bag was missing the feet. Get this, the bag has a gold plate in the middle. I think the counterfeiter is trying legitimize their fake bags by adding a gold plate. I know it's not nice to stare, but I just couldn't take my eyes off her poor fake LV!",

      "text": "How to get free Starbucks every day (it IS possible) If you order an Iced Quad Venti Vanilla White Mocha at Starbucks every single day, your monthly tab is going to add up quickly—so I wouldn’t necessarily blame you if you tried to figure out a way to get free Starbucks every day . If you’re really lucky, you might win free Starbucks for life, like one lucky lady in Kansas did earlier this year. But if you want to take matters into your own hand, you can follow in the footsteps of one horrible Starbucks customer who used this so-called hack to get free Starbucks that’s actually more of a dick move than anything else. As Brad Halsey, a Starbucks barista, wrote in an email to Jezebel’s Kitchenette, one customer at his store, “purchased 365 Starbucks cards and registered every one of them online with a different birthday so that he gets a ‘free birthday drink’ EVERY DAY OF THE YEAR.” That means that every single day, this customer walks into Starbucks and orders a free “birthday” drink.\nHalsey, at this point, is wise to this man’s trick to get free Starbucks , and yet, the customer continues to maintain that it’s a fluke in the Starbucks app. “Even though I know exactly how he ‘beat the system’ there, he pretends that his app is just malfunctioning and it magically gives him the same free birthday drink every day,” Halsey complains, adding, “If he was a nice guy, I might not be so irritated.” But it gets worse.\nApparently this customer is a total brat who insists on writing his own order on the cup in black marker. And it’s complicated:\nHe draws lines and arrows and writes all over the cup while telling me: ‘Two pumps of white mocha here, then add five pumps of vanilla. That should take us to this line here where you’re gonna add cold heavy cream up to this ridge here…it should be halfway between this line and this line. Make sure to add the heavy whipping cream before the espresso, it changes the taste if you do it out of order. Then add your four shots, three regular and one long shot. That long shot is important, since you guys reformulated your machines, it’s been Hell trying to get my drink right. That long shot helps balance it. Then stir it for me, Mister Brad. Now do me a favor and add ice to the top there and it’ll be easy as pie. I’m not picky so don’t worry about shaking it or anything like that.’\nThen, this customer doesn’t even pay the proper amount for this extra complicated drink because of the “app malfunction.”\nSo sure, you could absolutely buy 365 different Starbucks cards (366, if you’re factoring in a leap year) and register each of them with a different birthday. It’s kind of an ingenious hack, when you think about it. But chances are good that your barista will start hating you if you come in every single day claiming it’s your birthday. Plus, it’s definitely unethical. So be a good customer, and just take your free drink on your actual birthday, OK? And always remember to tip your barista.\nThis article by Maxine Builder originally appeared on extracrispy.com \nRelated Links Barista’s warn of long lines at Starbucks \nYou’ve been reading coffee related health studies all wrong \nThe Scotched egg is cool again \nThe post How to get free Starbucks every day (it IS possible) appeared first on HelloGiggles .",

      "text": "Surprise: Starbucks sbux has a refill policy.\nCold brew drinkers everywhere cursed all the money they’ve spent on seconds after Starbucks Melody , an unofficial Starbucks news website, shared news surrounding the policy . While the substance of the policy hasn’t changed in years, the coffee company has been known to tweak some of the language, according to the news site. This is what prompted the blog post in the first place.\nFree refills are limited to brewed coffee (hot, Iced Coffee, or Cold Brew), and tea (hot, iced or shaken) during the same store visit at participating Starbucks stores, a spokesperson for the company told Fortune . And if you decide you want hot coffee after your cold brew, that’s fine—your second drink could be any one of those refill-eligible coffee or tea drinks.\nIn order to redeem refills, you must use your registered Starbucks Card or Mobile app to purchase any handcrafted beverage and then present that same Starbucks Card or Mobile app for a second drink. Refills are limited to in-store purchases and not redeemable from the drive-thru. And you relinquish any unredeemed drinks once you leave the store.\nThis is particularly welcome news right now, considering Starbucks quietly raised the prices of its drinks in the two days following the presidential election. It may also deter customers from trying to “beat the system” like the customer who registered 365 Starbucks cards with a different birthday in order to get a free drink every day of the year.",

      "title": "Starbucks Controversial Cups - Most Controversial Starbucks Cups",
      "text": "Regardless of how popular Starbucks coffee is, its cups tend to really piss people off. There's truly nothing like the release of a new Starbucks cup to ~brew~ some controversy.\nFrom the #TrumpCup in November 2016 to the Red Cup Drama in 2015, here are seven times Starbucks cups caused a latte of problems.\n1. The #TrumpCup, 2016\n In mid-November Starbucks controversy surrounding President-elect Donald Trump began. It started after a video of a barista refusing to write \"Trump\" on a customer's cup was circulating on the internet.\nJoe Biggs, who works at the website Infowars, came up with #TrumpCup in response to the video.\npic.twitter.com/4wsLESrFNk\n— Joe Biggs (@Rambobiggs) November 18, 2016 Supporting the movement, Tim Treadstone encouraged his followers to participate in \"Operation #TrumpCup.\"\nOperation #TrumpCup\n1) Go to Starbucks & tell them your name is Trump\n2) If they refuse take video\nPls share & spread the word pic.twitter.com/huPj4g6cqY\n— Baked Alaska™ (@bakedalaska) November 18, 2016 Trump supporters continued to join the \"operation.\"\nOn Primary #ElectionDay I got a #TrumpCup\nThen when I tried to #BoycottStarbucks & they wouldn't refund my $100 credit I did it @bakedalaska pic.twitter.com/78Alp8Q9fX\n— Keleigh ❤Trump🇺🇸 (@BarbieKeleigh) November 18, 2016 If we want Trump written on our cups don't call the cops! Feel free to boycott Starbucks after this. Even Kanye wants to #MAGA ! #TrumpCup pic.twitter.com/YyFv96dhz0\n— Irma Hinojosa 🇺🇸 (@latinaafortrump) November 18, 2016 The most interesting thing about this was that people continued to give Starbucks money — regardless of being angry at the company.\n2. The Starbucks Unity Cup, 2016\nIn early November, Starbucks released their \"Unity Cup.\" The green cup featured an illustration of a large group of diverse people standing closely together. It was intended to bring people together but did just the opposite.\nPeople took to Twitter to for two reasons: (1) How dare there be a green cup and not a red cup (the holiday red cups came the following week).\nWhen it's red cup season but Starbucks is giving out green ones 🙄 #GetItTogether\n— Isabella (@itzabella_matuk) November 1, 2016 Thoroughly confused by the @Starbucks green cups...bring back my red-cup holiday cheer! #TeamRedCup\n— Shana Wachowski (@slyons330) November 1, 2016 (2) Starbucks shouldn't get involved with \"politics.\"\nDear @Starbucks your \"holiday\" cup is not festive.. I don't like the taste of politics in my coffee. #bringbacksnowflakes and the #RedCups\n— Wendy Wright (@MrzAlwaysWright) November 2, 2016 Take your liberal cup & stick it stay out of politics ! You make coffee and that's it ! #starbucks\n— Larry T Basher (@LarryTBasher) November 4, 2016 The controversy quickly died down when the limited-time green cups were no longer being served and everyone moved on to the next Starbucks cup drama.\n3. When a Starbucks barista refused to write Black Lives Matter, 2016 In early July, Starbucks customers were telling baristas their names were \"Black Lives Matter\" — with the end goal being that after the phrase was written on the coffee cup, it would be said out loud when the order was ready for everyone to hear.\nAcknowledge us ! #BlackLivesMatter ! Thank you @theshaderoom for posting me & @vanilla_bean22 post 😘😘☺️\nA video posted by Schacle ( Sah-Shell ) (@schacle) on Jul 12, 2016 at 11:25am PDT\nJournalist Genevieve Uzamere wrote on her blog that her local New York City Starbucks wouldn't write \"Black Lives Matter\" on her cup. In her post, she said:\nI was cast to the side as other customers’ names were called to receive their drinks. I appealed to no less than three baristas, asking why I could not be extended the same courtesy. I was told that Starbucks does not take a stance on racial matters.\nStarbucks didn't comment on the matter.\n4. The \"Diabetes here I come\" cup, 2016 In April, a customer went to Starbucks and ordered a grande white mocha. When he received his cup, it said \"Diabetes Here I Come.\"\nA @Starbucks customer tells me he's hurt by the message he received on his coffee cup. Details on @ActionNewsJax pic.twitter.com/hNMeC6ysRJ\n— Kaitlyn Chana (@KaitlynANjax) April 8, 2016 He told Action News Jax that his two sisters suffer from type 1 diabetes, so the statement hit close to home. The customer wrote a note on that same cup and left it for the baristas. It read, \"2 of my sisters are diabetic, so ... not funny.\"\nThis @Starbucks customer tells me he wants the #Starbucks employee to know his sisters suffer from Type 1 diabetes. pic.twitter.com/lzmeAwLLdm\n— Kaitlyn Chana (@KaitlynANjax) April 8, 2016 Starbucks released a statement to Action News Jax saying the following:\nWe strive to provide an inclusive and positive experience for our customers, and we're disappointed to learn of this incident. We are working directly with the customer to apologize for his experience, and with our partners (employees) to ensure this does not happen again. 5. The Starbucks minimalist red cups, 2015 Starbucks first came out with a holiday cup in 1997. Since then, the release of the cup covered in holiday illustrations has become a tradition that Starbucks customers love and take very seriously — it's even known as #RedCupSeason on social media. It's important to note that the cups don't only have illustrations related to Christmas. In fact, most red cups in the past have included snowflakes and snowmen.\nRegardless of the holiday cups not being specific to Christmas, the minimalist design featuring a red ombré cup in November 2015 made the internet lost its mind .\nStarbucks It started with Josuha Feuerstein, an Arizona-based pastor who posted a video to Facebook where he said, \"Starbucks removed Christmas from their cups because they hate Jesus.\" Instantly the video went viral and today, it has 17 million views.\nOthers joined in, some even asking Starbucks to write Merry Christmas on their cup to ~protest~ (similar to the #TrumpCup).\nThe fact that Starbucks took Merry Christmas off their cups is crazy to see where our society has come to. Cmon Who doesn't like Christmas.\n— Diego (@traplifetrue) November 7, 2015 The fact that Starbucks took Merry Christmas off their cups is crazy to see where our society has come to. Cmon Who doesn't like Christmas.\n— Diego (@traplifetrue) November 7, 2015 Of course there were people who recognized that a red cup has absolutely nothing to do with Starbucks disliking Christianity.\nI am a Christian. I am not in any way offended by Starbucks cups. I am offended by: violence. Racism. Abuse. Discrimination. Cups? No.\n— JR. Forasteros (@jrforasteros) November 7, 2015 I doubt Jesus would be mad about a coffee cup. Don't we have biggest issues to deal with? #MerryChristmas #starbucks #StarbucksRedCup\n— Barbara (@BEBrophy) November 8, 2015 6. The Race Together cups, 2015 In March 2015, Starbucks launched a campaign where baristas were encouraged to start conversations on race relations with customers by writing the phrase \"Race Together\" on cups. The company even provided baristas with a list of questions to help start the conversation.\n#tbt to when Starbucks tried getting all us baristas killed with \"race together\" @Barista_Life_ pic.twitter.com/K0VP5Thg9I\n— Taylor Hickey (@itstaylorhickey) January 7, 2016 The campaign almost immediately became a huge joke on social media and ultimately failed. There was even a skit mocking the campaign on Saturday Night Live .\nWould #Starbucks lower their prices in order to offset the emotional cost of discussing #RaceTogether with a clueless Barista?\n— M.O.D.O.K (@levijkm) March 17, 2015 I think people of color who work at Starbucks confronting white people about race/class as they pay six dollars for a latte seems great.\n— Josh Gondelman (@joshgondelman) March 17, 2015 The only folks happy about Starbucks baristas discussing race with customers are the suits who run it. Feel-good liberalism at its worst.\n— Jamil Smith (@JamilSmith) March 17, 2015 After six days of the campaign, Starbucks ordered their baristas to stop writing \"race together\" on cups.\n7. The Quote: s-on-cups controversy, 2005 In 2005, Starbucks put Quote: s on cups called \"The Way I See It\" with a Quote: from literature. The company said it was hoping to \"inspire old-fashioned coffee-house conversations.\" What it ended up sparking, though, was controversy.\nFlickr Concerned Women for America — a national Christian women's organization — accused Starbucks of promoting a \"homosexual agenda\" because of a Quote: from author Armistead Maupin whose book Tales of the City chronicled the homosexual community in San Francisco in the 1970s and 1980s. The Quote: was:\nI surrendered my youth to the people I feared when I could have been out there loving someone. Don't make that mistake yourself. Life's too damn short. The group didn't boycott Starbucks, but accused the company for using mostly liberal Quote: s and said corporations should take a balanced approach on potentially sensitive matters.\nFor more food news and magical recipes, follow Cosmo Bites on Facebook !\nFollow Danielle on Instagram and Twitter ",

      "text": "By Olivia Estrada \nIt’s a little bit of a contradiction how the ubiquitous Starbucks sells Swarovski gift cards but they did just that. A limited edition set of the 2016 Starbucks Swarovski gift cards will be soon available online. They cost $200 each and have $50 worth of credit inside. That’s at least 10 Caramel Macchiatos. \nIf you want to get ahead, you may opt to sell the few gone astray on Ebay for a jacked up price of $300. If you can wait a little bit more, you may also opt to get the Swarovski-covered tumblers that will soon be hitting a Starbucks near you. \nWhat do you think? Will an extra bling add a little more zing to your morning caffeine fix? Would it be worth giving your coffee-loving friend? Personally, I prefer to put gold on my face . ",

      "text": "Share this article \nStarbucks Red Cups Are Back \nOn 10th November Starbucks launched its new red cups along with their (let’s face it, way overpriced but still irresistible) Christmas-y flavours, and we all know what that means: the holiday season has begun. \nHowever, these new cups are nothing like the ones that stirred the world’s most absurd controversy last year. If you missed it, here’s a little recap. The 2015 red cups were plain and simple, two-toned red, designed to be inclusive of everyone during the holiday regardless of their religion. But a number of Christians misunderstood the point, and took this as a sign of attack on Christianity or even a “war on Christmas”. Some tried to trick the system by saying that their name was “Merry Christmas”, forcing baristas to write the season’s greetings on the cup, while most people chose to express their confusion over this debate by using the hashtag #JustACup. A more creative bunch decided to show their feelings through art and humour: \nIt’s highly unlikely that the coffee company made significant losses after their choice of design, in fact they loved the hype – like they say, any publicity is good publicity. Still, their new red cups couldn’t be more Christmas-y: the six different designs, created by customers (who drew on their plain cup last year) include snowy landscapes, Christmas lights, baubles and candy canes. Hopefully even “American evangelist” Joshua Feuerstein – who was one of the people calling for the boycott of Starbucks – can now sleep peacefully. \nIt’s naive to think that outrage over a cup can only happen once a century. The coffee chain introduced another cup in America in the beginning of November (a limited batch before and not instead of the red ones): a simple, green cup with Shogo Ota’s art on it featuring connected characters drawn with one single line. It tried to represent unity and connectedness during the divisive time of the US presidential elections, but clearly America was not ready for that: the lovely notion was taken as “political brainwashing” by many, as expressed in their angry tweets. \nAt the end of the day, all I want is to enjoy my Toffe Nut Latte – the design of the container is secondary. \nWhat do you think: is it worth fighting over something as silly as a cup? And which one do you prefer: last year’s ombre look, or the new, festive designs? \nPhoto sources: adweek.com, twitter.com/S_Gonzalez1 and Google You Might Also Enjoy",

(Nov. 29, 2016) Gabrielle Karol, KXTV 6:07 AM. CST November 30, 2016 (Photo: Karol, Gabrielle) \nA Facebook post from a fired Elk Grove Starbucks barista is going viral. \nSince Christian Brown posted his rant on Nov. 27, his photos and confessions have been shared 3,400 times, with the post receiving 1,600 comments. \n“I’ve worked a shift or two at other Starbucks, and I’ve never seen anything this bad,” Brown explained. \nIn the post, Brown's pictures show trash and food littering the floor behind the counter, a fly trap covered in flies and a dirty milk steamer that had turned brown. Brown made other claims about the cleanliness at the Bond Rd. location in Elk Grove, adding that the standards had taken a turn for the worse since new management had taken over. \n“For five bucks for a cup of coffee, you deserve more than this,” Starbucks customer Luis Espinoza said, after seeing the pictures. \nBrown said the photos were taken roughly three months ago, when he was about to start cleaning the facility during his shift. \n“The problem is with them being that dirty,” Brown said, adding that a little bit of clutter is to be expected. \nThe Bond Rd. Starbucks passed state health inspections as recently as Oct. 26, 2016. Starbucks spokesman Reggie Borges said the company was aware of Brown’s claims but had done a thorough investigation of the store. \n“We’re disappointed that this former partner was interested in portraying this store in a bad light. We’ve made several visits and are confident this is not a regular issue,” Borges added. \nThe Facebook post has led many commenters to say they’ll be quitting Starbucks for good. But Brown said from what he’s seen, most Starbucks are run well. \n“It was really when new management went in that things started being bad,” he said. \nCopyright 2016 KXTV ",

      "text": "December 1, 2016 Partner (Employee) Experience Starbucks Partners Go (RED) for World AIDS Day Share Instagram Downloads \nThe impact of AIDS is felt around the globe in communities and homes near and far. An estimated 36.7 million people worldwide are living with HIV/AIDS as of the end of 2015, according to the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS . Progress is being made, however, with 18.2 million people with HIV accessing antiretroviral therapy globally, up from less than 1 million in 2000. \nOn World AIDS Day , December 1, Starbucks will donate 25 cents for every handcrafted holiday beverage purchased in participating stores in the U.S. and Canada to the Global Fund to help fight AIDS with (RED)® . In stores, baristas will be displaying the (Red) parenthesis on name tags to raise awareness. \nThe Starbucks Great Lakes Pride Alliance will mark the day in its community. Formed one year ago, the affinity group is part of the Starbucks Partner Pride Alliance Network , which has been around for 17 years and became an official partner (employee) network in 2007. \nMike Knight, a 10-year partner and manager of a Starbucks in Macomb, Michigan, north of Detroit, said the group is ramping up its profile by participating in large numbers at both the Motor City Pride Parade in June and the AIDS Walk Detroit in September. Partners also support local programs offered by Affirmations, a gay and lesbian community center, and the Ruth Ellis Center, which provides support services for runaway, homeless and at-risk LGBTQ youth. \nThe Great Lakes Pride Alliance Network strives to provide education, advocacy and access to all Starbucks partners while fostering a diverse and inclusive environment in company stores. Knight believes that mission takes on added significance around World AIDS Day. \n“We wanted to show solidarity and show how our partners are united with the cause,” Knight said. “This is about helping to create a dialog.” \nThis is the ninth year Starbucks is partnering with (RED)® on World AIDS Day. The company has contributed more than $14 million to the Global Fund to help fight AIDS. \nFor more information on this news release, contact Related News",

      "text": "Close Fired Starbucks barista's tell-all confession goes viral Photos taken by a barista at a Starbucks in Elk Grove showing trash and a dirty steam wand goes viral. (Nov. 29, 2016) Gabrielle Karol, KXTV 8:31 PM. EST November 29, 2016 (Photo: Karol, Gabrielle) \nA Facebook post from a fired Elk Grove Starbucks barista is going viral. \nSince Christian Brown posted his rant on Nov. 27, his photos and confessions have been shared 3,400 times, with the post receiving 1,600 comments. \n“I’ve worked a shift or two at other Starbucks, and I’ve never seen anything this bad,” Brown explained. \nIn the post, Brown's pictures show trash and food littering the floor behind the counter, a fly trap covered in flies and a dirty milk steamer that had turned brown. Brown made other claims about the cleanliness at the Bond Rd. location in Elk Grove, adding that the standards had taken a turn for the worse since new management had taken over. \n“For five bucks for a cup of coffee, you deserve more than this,” Starbucks customer Luis Espinoza said, after seeing the pictures. \nBrown said the photos were taken roughly three months ago, when he was about to start cleaning the facility during his shift. \n“The problem is with them being that dirty,” Brown said, adding that a little bit of clutter is to be expected. \nThe Bond Rd. Starbucks passed state health inspections as recently as Oct. 26, 2016. Starbucks spokesman Reggie Borges said the company was aware of Brown’s claims but had done a thorough investigation of the store. \n“We’re disappointed that this former partner was interested in portraying this store in a bad light. We’ve made several visits and are confident this is not a regular issue,” Borges added. \nThe Facebook post has led many commenters to say they’ll be quitting Starbucks for good. But Brown said from what he’s seen, most Starbucks are run well. \n“It was really when new management went in that things started being bad,” he said. \nCopyright 2016 KXTV ",

      "text": "Close Fired Starbucks barista's tell-all confession goes viral Photos taken by a barista at a Starbucks in Elk Grove showing trash and a dirty steam wand goes viral. (Nov. 29, 2016) Gabrielle Karol, KXTV 8:31 PM. EST November 29, 2016 (Photo: Karol, Gabrielle) \nA Facebook post from a fired Elk Grove Starbucks barista is going viral. \nSince Christian Brown posted his rant on Nov. 27, his photos and confessions have been shared 3,400 times, with the post receiving 1,600 comments. \n“I’ve worked a shift or two at other Starbucks, and I’ve never seen anything this bad,” Brown explained. \nIn the post, Brown's pictures show trash and food littering the floor behind the counter, a fly trap covered in flies and a dirty milk steamer that had turned brown. Brown made other claims about the cleanliness at the Bond Rd. location in Elk Grove, adding that the standards had taken a turn for the worse since new management had taken over. \n“For five bucks for a cup of coffee, you deserve more than this,” Starbucks customer Luis Espinoza said, after seeing the pictures. \nBrown said the photos were taken roughly three months ago, when he was about to start cleaning the facility during his shift. \n“The problem is with them being that dirty,” Brown said, adding that a little bit of clutter is to be expected. \nThe Bond Rd. Starbucks passed state health inspections as recently as Oct. 26, 2016. Starbucks spokesman Reggie Borges said the company was aware of Brown’s claims but had done a thorough investigation of the store. \n“We’re disappointed that this former partner was interested in portraying this store in a bad light. We’ve made several visits and are confident this is not a regular issue,” Borges added. \nThe Facebook post has led many commenters to say they’ll be quitting Starbucks for good. But Brown said from what he’s seen, most Starbucks are run well. \n“It was really when new management went in that things started being bad,” he said. \nCopyright 2016 KXTV ",

      "text": "Kellogg\nDunkin’ Donuts and Starbucks have more or less cornered the whole “morning caffeine buzz” market. That leaves Dunkin’, in particular, with a problem, as it’s pretty hard to extend your #brand beyond, well, coffee and donuts. So they’re diversifying into breakfast pastries by teaming up with Pop-Tarts.\nSadly, there isn’t a “Black Coffee” flavor, which seems to be something of a missed opportunity — not to mention the total lack of a “Large Regular” option for Boston . Instead, the Pop-Tarts will come in Chocolate Mocha and Vanilla Latte flavors, keeping with Pop-Tarts’ tendency towards sweetness.\nThis isn’t the first time a drink company has made a breakfast pastry. The breakfast staple recently rolled out root-beer and orange soda-flavored tarts in a deal with Pepsi, which weirdly has yet to end in the natural conclusion of a Wild Cherry Pepsi flavored Pop-Tart (Why? We’d buy it!). Still, this is a bit of a step in a new direction, since “coffee drink” flavors are an unexplored territory. But what we really want to see is what happens when Dunkin’ unleashes their donut flavors on Pop-Tarts. Nobody would ever admit to buying and eating Boston Cream Pop Tarts, but they’d do it anyway.\n(via Mashable )\n",

      "title": "Starbucks’ New Holiday Drink Is Basically Your Grandma’s Pie In A Cup",
      "text": "Like Us On Facebook \nCall me “basic,” but Starbucks has a soft spot in my heart. \nEvery year, they seem to set the bar higher and higher in the world of festive latte flavors, and their new release is something out of your grandmother’s kitchen on Christmas morning. \nThink about that toasty, gooey apple pie she’s set on the oven to cool, and then imagine it steaming in your Starbucks cup — because that’s what’s about to happen. \nBrace yourselves for the Baked Apple Latte, my friends. Instagram \nThe new flavor was released by Starbucks in Japan on Thursday, Mashable reports. We can only hope the flavor makes its way to the states before the holidays arrive. \nI’m getting thirsty (and hungry) just thinking about it. \nApparently, the “apple pie” taste is created with warm apple juice, caramelized apple, brown sugar and butter, according to Starbuck’s Japan Blog . @StarbucksJapan added \"Hot Baked Apple\" to their holiday drinks line-up! The other flavors are a Gingerbread Latte & a Snow Pecan Nut Latte! pic.twitter.com/ffxybQPFTT \n— Japan Crate (@JapanCrate) November 21, 2016 \nIt’s basically an apple pie in the form of coffee, and I can barely contain my excitement. Heck, it even comes in the form of a frappuccino. \nIs your mouth watering yet? Because mine definitely is. Giphy \nI have to admit: Starbucks lovers in Japan are pretty damn lucky. This latte is being added to their holiday collection, which already includes flavors like the Pecan Nut Latte and the Gingerbread Latte. \nChristmas is allegedly becoming a big tradition in Japan, so it’s no surprise the Starbucks holiday drinks are becoming a huge hit. \nWe’re definitely jealous of the new flavor. Send us some, will you?! Instagram \nTo make us even more envious, it’s been reported “Starbucks Evenings” have started in Tokyo that allows guests to indulge in alcoholic frappuccinos. \nPretty cool, right? I’d definitely have a holiday gathering over an alcoholic Starbucks bev. Instagram \nHopefully, the Baked Apple Latte will make its way over to the US soon. I can’t wait to start my day with a warm apple pie drink at hand. \nGrandma would be proud. \nSubscribe to Elite Daily's official newsletter, The Edge , for more stories you don't want to miss.

      "text": "Close Fired Starbucks barista's tell-all confession goes viral Photos taken by a barista at a Starbucks in Elk Grove showing trash and a dirty steam wand goes viral. (Nov. 29, 2016) Gabrielle Karol, KXTV 10:13 AM. CST November 30, 2016 (Photo: Karol, Gabrielle) \nA Facebook post from a fired Elk Grove Starbucks barista is going viral. \nSince Christian Brown posted his rant on Nov. 27, his photos and confessions have been shared 3,400 times, with the post receiving 1,600 comments. \n“I’ve worked a shift or two at other Starbucks, and I’ve never seen anything this bad,” Brown explained. \nIn the post, Brown's pictures show trash and food littering the floor behind the counter, a fly trap covered in flies and a dirty milk steamer that had turned brown. Brown made other claims about the cleanliness at the Bond Rd. location in Elk Grove, adding that the standards had taken a turn for the worse since new management had taken over. \n“For five bucks for a cup of coffee, you deserve more than this,” Starbucks customer Luis Espinoza said, after seeing the pictures. \nBrown said the photos were taken roughly three months ago, when he was about to start cleaning the facility during his shift. \n“The problem is with them being that dirty,” Brown said, adding that a little bit of clutter is to be expected. \nThe Bond Rd. Starbucks passed state health inspections as recently as Oct. 26, 2016. Starbucks spokesman Reggie Borges said the company was aware of Brown’s claims but had done a thorough investigation of the store. \n“We’re disappointed that this former partner was interested in portraying this store in a bad light. We’ve made several visits and are confident this is not a regular issue,” Borges added. \nThe Facebook post has led many commenters to say they’ll be quitting Starbucks for good. But Brown said from what he’s seen, most Starbucks are run well. \n“It was really when new management went in that things started being bad,” he said. \nCopyright 2016 KXTV ",

      "text": "PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) – Starbucks could be in for a new coffee cup-related brouhaha after mislabeling a landmark on an Oregon-themed travel mug.\nThe Oregonian/OregonLive reports that the Seattle-based coffee chain has introduced a travel mug covered in sketches of notable Oregon landmarks, including Crater Lake National Park, food carts in Portland and Ashland’s Shakespeare Festival. But there was also a waterfall design identified as “Klamath Falls” – and no such waterfall exists.\n#FAIL @Starbucks who reviewed the final design? Klamath Falls DOESN'T have a waterfall. The pic looks like you meant #multnomahfalls #oops pic.twitter.com/DTGZHeUg20 \n— april (@aprilwhetsell) November 30, 2016 \n\nThe simple line drawing of a falls topped by an arched bridge was likely meant to depict the majestic Multnomah Falls, a popular spot in the Columbia River Gorge. Klamath Falls is a town in southern Oregon.\nStarbucks has not replied to a request for comment.\nThe coffee chain also sparked controversy last winter by choosing a simple red ombre for its holiday cup design.",

There are already some Starbucks drinks available   but now there’s going to be a new full-service Starbucks, too. Courtesy photo i   \nWichita State University now confirms what Have You Heard? reported this spring and, really, just about everyone on campus already knew. \nStarbucks is building a new full-service store, which will be the first retail operation at the Innovation Campus . \n“It’s going to be great for faculty, staff and students already here and will be a draw for the greater Wichita community,” said Emily Patterson , WSU director of facilities planning, in a release. \nThe release said Starbucks will be 2,000 square feet and be located north of the Woodman Alumni Center , which is near 21st Street and Mike Oatman Drive. \nAlong with a drive-through, Starbucks will have outdoor seating at a large plaza next to the business. \nCurrently, there are some Starbucks specialty drinks available at the GroundHouse at Shocker Hall and at the Rhatigan Student Center , but there’s not a full line at either place. \nLook for the new Starbucks to open no later than early spring.",

      "text": "  9:27 A.M. Starbucks mislabels Oregon-themed travel mug   \nPORTLAND – Starbucks could be in for a new coffee cup-related brouhaha after mislabeling a landmark on an Oregon-themed travel mug. \nThe Oregonian/OregonLive reported that the Seattle-based coffee chain has introduced a travel mug covered in sketches of notable Oregon landmarks, including Crater Lake National Park, food carts in Portland and Ashland’s Shakespeare Festival. But there was also a waterfall design identified as “Klamath Falls” – and no such waterfall exists. \nThe simple line drawing of a falls topped by an arched bridge was likely meant to depict the majestic Multnomah Falls, a popular spot in the Columbia River Gorge. Klamath Falls is a town in southern Oregon. \nStarbucks has not replied to a request for comment. \nThe coffee chain also sparked controversy last winter by choosing a simple red ombre for its holiday cup design.   9:27 a.m.",

      "text": "Starbucks chairman and CEO Howard Schultz smiles as he speaks at the annual Starbucks shareholders meeting Wednesday, March 21, 2012, in Seattle. AP/Elaine Thompson \nStarbucks' CEO Howard Schultz is stepping down, the company announced on Thursday. \nThe company announced the news with a release on Starbucks' website. Here's the release in full: \nStarbucks Corporation (NASDAQ: SBUX) today announced that Kevin Johnson , president and chief operating officer and a 7-year member of the Starbucks Board of Directors, will expand his responsibilities and assume the role and responsibilities of president and chief executive officer, effective April 3, 2017. \nAlso effective April 3, 2017, Howard Schultz , chairman and ceo, will be appointed executive chairman and will shift his focus to innovation, design and development of Starbucks Reserve® Roasteries around the world, expansion of the Starbucks Reserve® retail store format and the company’s social impact initiatives. In this new role Schultz will continue to serve as chairman of the Board. \n“Starbucks consistently outperforms the retail industry because our stores, our offerings and the experiences our partners create make us a destination. The best evidence of the success of the core strategy driving our business is that we continue to deliver quarter after quarter of record, industry leading revenue, comp sales and profit growth, and that the newest classes of Starbucks stores continue to deliver record-breaking revenues, AUV’s and ROI both in the U.S. and around the world,” said Schultz. “As I focus on Starbucks next wave of retail innovation, I am delighted that Kevin Johnson – our current president, coo, a seven-year board member and my partner in running every facet of Starbucks business over the last two years – has agreed to assume the duties of Starbucks chief executive officer. This move ideally positions Starbucks to continue profitably growing our core business around the world into the future.” \nAs president and chief operating officer since March 2015, Johnson has led the company’s global operating businesses across all geographies as well as the core support functions of Starbucks supply chain, marketing, human resources, technology, and mobile and digital platforms. Johnson has been a Starbucks board member since 2009, and will continue to serve as a member of the Board. \n\"Over the past two decades, I have grown to know Starbucks first as a customer, then as a director on the board, and for the past two years as a member of the management team. Through that journey, I fell in love with Starbucks and I share Howard’s commitment to our mission and values and his optimism for the future,\" said Johnson. “It is an honor for me to serve the more than 300,000 partners who proudly wear the green apron and I consider it a privilege to work side-by-side with Howard, our world-class board of directors, and a very talented leadership team. Together, we will reaffirm our leadership in all things coffee, enhance the partner experience and exceed the expectations of our customers and shareholders. We believe in using our scale for good and having positive social impact in the communities we serve around the world.” \nJohnson's career spans 33 years in the technology industry which included a 16-year career at Microsoft and a five-year tour as CEO of Juniper Networks. At Microsoft, he led worldwide sales and marketing and became the president of the Platforms Division. In 2008, he was appointed to the National Security Telecommunication Advisory Committee where he served Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama. He joined the Starbucks board in 2009 and the management team in 2015.",

      "text": "Downloads Kevin Johnson to become chief executive officer and assume full responsibility for Starbucks global business and operations Howard Schultz to become executive chairman and focus on retail innovation and accelerating growth of Starbucks ultra-premium retail formats \nSEATTLE (Dec. 1, 2016) – Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ: SBUX) today announced that Kevin Johnson , president and chief operating officer and a 7-year member of the Starbucks Board of Directors, will expand his responsibilities and assume the role and responsibilities of president and chief executive officer, effective April 3, 2017. \nAlso effective April 3, 2017, Howard Schultz , chairman and ceo, will be appointed executive chairman and will shift his focus to innovation, design and development of Starbucks Reserve® Roasteries around the world, expansion of the Starbucks Reserve® retail store format and the company’s social impact initiatives. In this new role Schultz will continue to serve as chairman of the Board. \n“Starbucks consistently outperforms the retail industry because our stores, our offerings and the experiences our partners create make us a destination. The best evidence of the success of the core strategy driving our business is that we continue to deliver quarter after quarter of record, industry leading revenue, comp sales and profit growth, and that the newest classes of Starbucks stores continue to deliver record-breaking revenues, AUV’s and ROI both in the U.S. and around the world,” said Schultz. “As I focus on Starbucks next wave of retail innovation, I am delighted that Kevin Johnson – our current president, coo, a seven-year board member and my partner in running every facet of Starbucks business over the last two years – has agreed to assume the duties of Starbucks chief executive officer. This move ideally positions Starbucks to continue profitably growing our core business around the world into the future.” \nAs president and chief operating officer since March 2015, Johnson has led the company’s global operating businesses across all geographies as well as the core support functions of Starbucks supply chain, marketing, human resources, technology, and mobile and digital platforms. Johnson has been a Starbucks board member since 2009, and will continue to serve as a member of the Board. \n\"Over the past two decades, I have grown to know Starbucks first as a customer, then as a director on the board, and for the past two years as a member of the management team. Through that journey, I fell in love with Starbucks and I share Howard’s commitment to our mission and values and his optimism for the future,\" said Johnson. “It is an honor for me to serve the more than 300,000 partners who proudly wear the green apron and I consider it a privilege to work side-by-side with Howard, our world-class board of directors, and a very talented leadership team. Together, we will reaffirm our leadership in all things coffee, enhance the partner experience and exceed the expectations of our customers and shareholders. We believe in using our scale for good and having positive social impact in the communities we serve around the world.” \nJohnson's career spans 33 years in the technology industry which included a 16-year career at Microsoft and a five-year tour as CEO of Juniper Networks. At Microsoft, he led worldwide sales and marketing and became the president of the Platforms Division. In 2008, he was appointed to the National Security Telecommunication Advisory Committee where he served Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama. He joined the Starbucks board in 2009 and the management team in 2015.

      "text": "Continue reading the main story SEATTLE — Howard Schultz , the leader of Starbucks , said on Thursday he would step down as chief executive next year, handing over to his personally selected successor the management of the company he built into the world’s largest coffee business, with over 25,000 stores in 75 countries. Mr. Schultz, one of the most visible chief executives in the country, has made Starbucks a vocal part of the national conversation on issues like gun violence, gay rights, race relations, veterans rights and student debt. The handover will take place on April 3, and he will remain at the company as executive chairman. Mr. Schultz, 63, will be succeeded by his close friend Kevin Johnson, the company’s current president and a longtime Starbucks board member. “This is a big day for me,” Mr. Schultz said in an interview. “I love the company as much as I love my family.” But he said he decided it was the right time to hand the keys to Mr. Johnson, whom he described as being “better equipped” to “run the company than I am,” ticking off a list of Mr. Johnson’s operational talents, saying that he wanted to “relinquish the role and responsibility to the right person.” \n  The move is likely to ignite renewed speculation about whether Mr. Schultz is paving the way to leave the company entirely to enter politics. His outspoken positions on social issues have led many people, including his closest friends, to say he may seek run for president. He has spent an increasing amount of time traveling around the country speaking publicly about the need to fix the “dysfunction in Washington.” He has a close relationship with President Obama and had been a supporter of Hillary Clinton. Mr. Schultz will continue to lead the Starbucks’ efforts on social issues as well as the development of its effort to develop a superpremium line of coffee and coffee stores. The latter has been a passion project for Mr. Schultz that he hopes will “shine a halo on the entire company.” Mr. Johnson, 56, spent his career in technology as a lieutenant of Steven A. Ballmer, the former chief executive of Microsoft, and later as chief executive of Juniper Networks, before being recruited out of retirement by Mr. Schultz in 2015 to become president and chief operating officer of Starbucks. Although the change may come as a surprise to the public and some Starbucks employees, the company has been sending to signals to Wall Street for the last year about its intentions to carry out a the succession plan, announcing a reorganization in the summer that gave Mr. Johnson oversight of the day-to-day operations.",

      "text": "Kevin Johnson and Howard Schultz. (Starbucks Photo) BREAKING NEWS: Longtime Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz will be stepping down as the coffee giant’s top leader in April 2017, handing over the reins to Kevin Johnson, the current Starbucks president, who worked at Microsoft and other tech companies prior to joining Starbucks as an executive last year. Schultz will remain Starbucks executive chairman.\nDeveloping story, more to come. Here is the company’s news release.\nSEATTLE (Dec. 1, 2016) – Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ: SBUX) today announced that Kevin Johnson, president and chief operating officer and a 7-year member of the Starbucks Board of Directors, will expand his responsibilities and assume the role and responsibilities of president and chief executive officer, effective April 3, 2017.\nAlso effective April 3, 2017, Howard Schultz, chairman and ceo, will be appointed executive chairman and will shift his focus to innovation, design and development of Starbucks Reserve® Roasteries around the world, expansion of the Starbucks Reserve® retail store format and the company’s social impact initiatives. In this new role Schultz will continue to serve as chairman of the Board.\n“Starbucks consistently outperforms the retail industry because our stores, our offerings and the experiences our partners create make us a destination. The best evidence of the success of the core strategy driving our business is that we continue to deliver quarter after quarter of record, industry leading revenue, comp sales and profit growth, and that the newest classes of Starbucks stores continue to deliver record-breaking revenues, AUV’s and ROI both in the U.S. and around the world,” said Schultz. “As I focus on Starbucks next wave of retail innovation, I am delighted that Kevin Johnson – our current president, coo, a seven-year board member and my partner in running every facet of Starbucks business over the last two years – has agreed to assume the duties of Starbucks chief executive officer. This move ideally positions Starbucks to continue profitably growing our core business around the world into the future.”\nAs president and chief operating officer since March 2015, Johnson has led the company’s global operating businesses across all geographies as well as the core support functions of Starbucks supply chain, marketing, human resources, technology, and mobile and digital platforms. Johnson has been a Starbucks board member since 2009, and will continue to serve as a member of the Board.\n“Over the past two decades, I have grown to know Starbucks first as a customer, then as a director on the board, and for the past two years as a member of the management team. Through that journey, I fell in love with Starbucks and I share Howard’s commitment to our mission and values and his optimism for the future,” said Johnson. “It is an honor for me to serve the more than 300,000 partners who proudly wear the green apron and I consider it a privilege to work side-by-side with Howard, our world-class board of directors, and a very talented leadership team. Together, we will reaffirm our leadership in all things coffee, enhance the partner experience and exceed the expectations of our customers and shareholders. We believe in using our scale for good and having positive social impact in the communities we serve around the world.”\nJohnson’s career spans 33 years in the technology industry which included a 16-year career at Microsoft and a five-year tour as CEO of Juniper Networks. At Microsoft, he led worldwide sales and marketing and became the president of the Platforms Division. In 2008, he was appointed to the National Security Telecommunication Advisory Committee where he served Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama. He joined the Starbucks board in 2009 and the management team in 2015.\n",

Kevin Johnson will takeover CEO duties on April 3, 2017. \nThe stock is down about 4 percent at $56.30 in the after-hours session. \nTheStreet's Brian Sozzi wrote in July , \"Schultz's first signal to Wall Street of a succession plan arguably came in 2014, when he established the new position of chief operating officer. Given Johnson's expanded responsibilities, it looks like the CEO job is his to lose.\" \nSchultz actually stepped down as Starbucks CEO from 2000-2008. Schultz became Fortune magazine's \"2011 Businessperson of the Year\" for his initiatives in the economy and job market. \nSince his return in 2008, the stock has grown from $9 per share to $60 per share. The stock is down about 6 percent over the past year. \nSchultz will remain chair of the company. © 2016 Benzinga.com. Benzinga does not provide investment advice. All rights reserved.",

      "text": "Starbucks has announced that its CEO, Howard Schultz, a vocal proponent of the minimum wage and vocal supporter of Hillary Clinton not to mention the person who almost single-handedly created Starbucks as a worldwide brand, is stepping down and will be replaced by COO Kevin Johnson.\n\nThe full press release:\n\n*Starbucks Announces New Leadership Structure to Drive Next Wave of Global Growth*\n\nKevin Johnson to become chief executive officer and assume full responsibility for Starbucks global business and operations\nHoward Schultz to become executive chairman and focus on retail innovation and accelerating growth of Starbucks ultra-premium retail formats\n\nSEATTLE (Dec. 1, 2016) – Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ: SBUX) today announced that Kevin Johnson, president and chief operating officer and a 7-year member of the Starbucks Board of Directors, will expand his responsibilities and assume the role and responsibilities of president and chief executive officer, effective April 3, 2017.\n\nAlso effective April 3, 2017, Howard Schultz, chairman and ceo, will be appointed executive chairman and will shift his focus to innovation, design and development of Starbucks Reserve® Roasteries around the world, expansion of the Starbucks Reserve® retail store format and the company’s social impact initiatives. In this new role Schultz will continue to serve as chairman of the Board.\n\n“Starbucks consistently outperforms the retail industry because our stores, our offerings and the experiences our partners create make us a destination. The best evidence of the success of the core strategy driving our business is that we continue to deliver quarter after quarter of record, industry leading revenue, comp sales and profit growth, and that the newest classes of Starbucks stores continue to deliver record-breaking revenues, AUV’s and ROI both in the U.S. and around the world,” said Schultz. “As I focus on Starbucks next wave of retail innovation, I am delighted that Kevin Johnson – our current president, coo, a seven-year board member and my partner in running every facet of Starbucks business over the last two years – has agreed to assume the duties of Starbucks chief executive officer. This move ideally positions Starbucks to continue profitably growing our core business around the world into the future.”\nAs president and chief operating officer since March 2015, Johnson has led the company’s global operating businesses across all geographies as well as the core support functions of Starbucks supply chain, marketing, human resources, technology, and mobile and digital platforms. Johnson has been a Starbucks board member since 2009, and will continue to serve as a member of the Board.\n\n\"Over the past two decades, I have grown to know Starbucks first as a customer, then as a director on the board, and for the past two years as a member of the management team. Through that journey, I fell in love with Starbucks and I share Howard’s commitment to our mission and values and his optimism for the future,\" said Johnson. “It is an honor for me to serve the more than 300,000 partners who proudly wear the green apron and I consider it a privilege to work side-by-side with Howard, our world-class board of directors, and a very talented leadership team. Together, we will reaffirm our leadership in all things coffee, enhance the partner experience and exceed the expectations of our customers and shareholders. We believe in using our scale for good and having positive social impact in the communities we serve around the world.”\n\nJohnson's career spans 33 years in the technology industry which included a 16-year career at Microsoft and a five-year tour as CEO of Juniper Networks. At Microsoft, he led worldwide sales and marketing and became the president of the Platforms Division. In 2008, he was appointed to the National Security Telecommunication Advisory Committee where he served Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama . He joined the Starbucks board in 2009 and the management team in 2015.",

      "text": "Howard Schultz to Step Down as Starbucks CEO December 01, 2016, 04:15:  By Julie Jargon \nStarbucks Corp. Howard Schultz is stepping down as chief executive of the Starbucks Corp so he can devote all of his time to a new strategic initiative of opening high-end coffee shops for the 45-year-old company. \nMr. Schultz, 63, is handing over the reins to President and Chief Operating Officer Kevin Johnson, who served as a board member of the company for several years before joining its executive team two years ago. \n\"I don't have any time horizon that would limit my engagement in the company,\" he said in an interview. \"This gives me the entrepreneurial freedom to do what I think I do best.\" \nThe move is aimed at refreshing the Starbucks brand, which has been facing increasing competition from specialty roasters such as Stumptown and Intelligentsia as well as from mass coffee purveyors like Dunkin' Donuts, which has been introducing more high-end drinks such as cold brewed coffee. \nMr. Schultz said the approach could also help protect Starbucks from an inevitable loss of traffic from people who order more goods online, instead of making mall trips. He decided that opening high-end coffee shops that would provide a luxurious experience would entice people to leave their homes. \nTwo years ago the company opened its first such store, the Seattle Reserve Roastery and Tasting Room, a 15,000- square-foot store where coffee is roasted and people can buy $12 cups of small-batch \"reserve\" coffees made with a siphon brewing technique. \nStarbucks is planning to open 20 to 30 more of the high-end stores , including one twice its size in Shanghai next year. The company plans to build up to 1,000 smaller stores similar to the Roastery, minus the on-site roasting, under the \"Starbucks Reserve\" brand with a logo that consists of just a gold star and the letter \"R.\" \nStarbucks is also remodeling many of its stores with Reserve-branded coffee bars where customers can get the same kind of coffee education and different brewing methods offered in the Reserve stores. The company also plans to test out new drinks and food at those stores and then introduce them in its traditional coffee shops that don't contain Reserve bars. \nMr. Schultz has shepherded Starbucks through many changes since he joined the coffee company in 1982 as its marketing director. \nAfter leaving the company after a dispute with its owners, Mr. Schultz in 1986 opened his own coffee shop, which he named Il Giornale, and later bought the Starbucks retail unit from its owners. He renamed his shop Starbucks and went on to expand the brand to more than 25,000 stores across the globe. \nWrite to Julie Jargon at julie.jargon@wsj.com (END) Dow Jones Newswires 12-01-161615ET Copyright (c) 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

      "text": "Dec 1, 2016 4:07 PM 0 SHARES \nStarbucks has announced that its CEO, Howard Schultz, a vocal proponent of the minimum wage and vocal supporter of Hillary Clinton not to mention the person who almost single-handedly created Starbucks as a worldwide brand, is stepping down to focus on opening higher-end coffee shops for the company. He will be replaced by COO Kevin Johnson. \nThe stock was down as much as 11% on the news but has since rebounded to -4% on the session. \nThe full press release : \nStarbucks Announces New Leadership Structure to Drive Next Wave of Global Growth \nKevin Johnson to become chief executive officer and assume full responsibility for Starbucks global business and operations Howard Schultz to become executive chairman and focus on retail innovation and accelerating growth of Starbucks ultra-pre mium retail formats \nSEATTLE (Dec. 1, 2016) – Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ: SBUX) today announced that Kevin Johnson, president and chief operating officer and a 7-year member of the Starbucks Board of Directors, will expand his responsibilities and assume the role and responsibilities of president and chief executive officer, effective April 3, 2017. \nAlso effective April 3, 2017, Howard Schultz, chairman and ceo, will be appointed executive chairman and will shift his focus to innovation, design and development of Starbucks Reserve® Roasteries around the world, expansion of the Starbucks Reserve® retail store format and the company’s social impact initiatives. In this new role Schultz will continue to serve as chairman of the Board. \n“Starbucks consistently outperforms the retail industry because our stores, our offerings and the experiences our partners create make us a destination. The best evidence of the success of the core strategy driving our business is that we continue to deliver quarter after quarter of record, industry leading revenue, comp sales and profit growth, and that the newest classes of Starbucks stores continue to deliver record-breaking revenues, AUV’s and ROI both in the U.S. and around the world,” said Schultz. “As I focus on Starbucks next wave of retail innovation, I am delighted that Kevin Johnson – our current president, coo, a seven-year board member and my partner in running every facet of Starbucks business over the last two years – has agreed to assume the duties of Starbucks chief executive officer. This move ideally positions Starbucks to continue profitably growing our core business around the world into the future.” \nAs president and chief operating officer since March 2015, Johnson has led the company’s global operating businesses across all geographies as well as the core support functions of Starbucks supply chain, marketing, human resources, technology, and mobile and digital platforms. Johnson has been a Starbucks board member since 2009, and will continue to serve as a member of the Board. \n\"Over the past two decades, I have grown to know Starbucks first as a customer, then as a director on the board, and for the past two years as a member of the management team. Through that journey, I fell in love with Starbucks and I share Howard’s commitment to our mission and values and his optimism for the future,\" said Johnson. “It is an honor for me to serve the more than 300,000 partners who proudly wear the green apron and I consider it a privilege to work side-by-side with Howard, our world-class board of directors, and a very talented leadership team.

Effective April 3, he will be appointed executive chairman, where he will focus on innovation, design and developing Starbucks locations.\nSchultz is being replaced by former Microsoft senior exec Kevin Johnson, who will become the new CEO.\nIn a statement, Schultz said the move “ideally positions Starbucks to continue profitably growing our core business around the world into the future.”\nSchultz famously returned to Starbucks in 2008 to help guide the coffee giant through the recession and restore growth at the company.\n47.606209 -122.332071 ",
