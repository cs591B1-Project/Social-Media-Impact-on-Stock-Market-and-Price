      "text": "share this share this \nCitibank announced the launch of Citi Pay, a new digital wallet that will provide Citi customers with a simple and fast option for online, in-app and in-store payment needs.The offering will launch in Singapore and Australia with a global roll-out to follow. SUBSCRIBE to Website Magazine & Accelerate 'Net Success \n“Whether it is online, on a phone, or at a store, we want Citi customers to have seamless, convenient and fast payment options wherever they go,” said Barry Rodrigues, Head of Global Digital Payments at Citi. “With more than 100 million customers in the fastest-growing cities in 19 countries, Citi is uniquely positioned to accelerate payment innovation on a global scale. With Citi Pay, we are offering our customers flexibility wherever and whenever they choose to make purchases.” \nCiti customers will be able to make online and in-app purchases using the same Citibank online user ID and password that they currently use to manage their existing online relationship with Citi. Citi is partnering with Mastercard® to leverage its digital payment service, Masterpass®, to enable the online and in-app transactions. This will allow Citi customers to use Citi Pay at hundreds of thousands of merchants across 33 countries at launch. For Android users, the digital wallet also enables Citi cardholders to make in-store purchases by tapping their Android mobile devices at any NFC-enabled point-of-sale terminal. \nCiti Pay is the latest digital payments announcement from the bank. Earlier this year in the U.S., Citi joined Early Warning’s clearXchange® network, which will enable Citi’s online and mobile banking customers to send or receive real-time person-to-person (P2P) payments to or from customers of participating network banks. Also in 2016, Citi enabled Samsung Pay for its card members in Singapore and Australia.",

Want to talk miles & points with 2K others? Join our Facebook community! ThankYou Premier 40K Bonus Returns \nFor a long time we were riding high with Citi sign-up bonuses. For example, for much of 2015 the ThankYou Premier card had a 50K sign-up bonus with the annual fee waived the first year. Then in April that bonus dropped to 40K before disappearing completely over the Summer. Thankfully Citi has decided to bring back a bonus on this card. Let’s take a look. The Offer \nEarn 40,000 bonus points after making $3,000 in purchases within the first 3 months of account opening. $95 annual fee is NOT waived. Card Benefits Earn 3X on travel including gas. Earn 2X on dining and entertainment. Earn 1X on everything else. ThankYou points are worth 1.25 cents each when used towards travel. Transfer points to loyalty program partners. No foreign transaction fee. \nDirect Application Link Need to Know This is slightly worse than the bonus before it disappeared since the annual fee is not waived the first year. The bonus is not available if you have opened or closed a ThankYou Premier, ThankYou Preferred or Prestige card within the past 24 months. If you don’t have a Prestige, this is a good card to get to open up points transfers for ThankYou points earned with other cards such as the AT&T Access More . Analysis \nWhen deciding whether or not to apply for Citi products, it can be tough because of their new restrictions on getting the bonus . On one hand if you are eligible for this card now, applying could start the 24 month clock so you can get another one, while on the other hand we may see better bonuses including a waived annual fee down the line. \nKeep in mind that Citi has also been fairly generous with retention offers on this card. While that isn’t guaranteed, it may help you to keep this card past the first year so you don’t close it and restart that bonus clock. If I was in the market for a ThankYou card and didn’t need any of the benefits of the Prestige, I would probably jump on this since there is no guarantee that we will see anything better soon. Conclusion \nIt is nice to see Citi bring back the bonus on what was once considered their Sapphire Preferred competitor. With 3X on travel and 2X on dining it earns at a great rate, although the Sapphire Reserve has definitely eclipsed that. Either way, this is a decent card with a good, but not great bonus. Let’s hope for something better and more importantly hope the bonus doesn’t disappear again! \nWhat are your thoughts on the new Citi ThankYou Premier 40K bonus? More From Miles To Memories TAGS",
