      "title": "Review: Are the cord-free Skybuds worth the $249 price tag ahead of Apple’s AirPods?",
      "text": "Reddit \nWhile we await Apple’s delayed cord-free, wireless AirPods, we’ve been reviewing the competition to see if they are indeed worth the wait. The $249 Skybuds are one of the latest entries, which made a debut at Best Buy this month across the US. I’ve been testing them over the last couple weeks… Design \nThe Skybuds manage to be on the smaller side compared to other cord-free earbuds I’ve tested recently— like The Bragi Dash or Sol Republic’s new Amps Air — but they are still borderline slightly bigger than I’d say is ideal for an earbud. Of course comfort when it comes to earbuds is a very personal thing, and overall the form factor isn’t a deal breaker in terms of size— they don’t look too big in the ear like some of the other products in this category, but you can judge for yourself in the image below. And while I wouldn’t describe them as particularly comfortable, they weren’t too uncomfortable to wear for extended periods of time. \nYou’re supposed to twist them into place after inserting into your ear, so they sit like this: \nFor most that will lock the earbuds snuggly into place, and I didn’t have an issues with feeling like I might lose one while in motion. \nThe plastic earbuds are sweat proof and water-resistant, which makes them suitable for workouts. They come with three different size silicone ear tips that you can replace to get a snug fit. The button on the side is limited to answering and declining a call, or pausing and playing music, but the mic in my tests wasn’t suitable for calls in environments with any level of background noise on either end. Don’t expect to have a great experience with calls on these, but we’ve yet to find a cord-free earbuds that do deliver for voice calls. Setup/pairing \nThe initial setup and pairing process with the Skybuds is incredibly user friendly with a pleasant sounding voice delivering audio instructions for setup when you first turn them on. It’s the usual Bluetooth headphone pairing process otherwise, meaning you should see them appear within the Bluetooth tab in Settings. \nOnce you’ve paired once, the earbuds should pair automatically with your device as long as they are on and Bluetooth is enabled on your device. I found them to pair quite reliably with my iPhone 7, only requiring the odd reconnecting via Settings or cycling of power when the auto pairing happens to fail (a fact of life with Bluetooth). Charging case \nLike most other cord-free earbuds, these make up for somewhat limited battery life with a portable charging case that extends your approximately 4 hour battery life to 24 hours while on-the-go. In other words, as long as you aren’t listening for longer than 4 hour periods, and store them in the charging case in between listening, you’ll be able to get all-day or multiple days out of use before having to plug into a wall. \nThe case has charge indicator lights on top and uses micro USB charging, and you just leave the earbuds on when you insert them into the case. That way, when you pull them out next time, they are on and ready to automatically pair with your device. Sound Quality \nSound quality is a bit lacking from what I’d expect out of a $249 pair of earbuds— they were similar to Apple’s EarPods that come stock with iPhones in my comparisons. The sound is a bit on the thin/hollow side, and there isn’t much presence of any bass. The Sol Republic Amps Air earbuds I tested recently offer many of the same features at $179, and they provide much superior sound quality with bigger bass and cleaner mids. But they are also a bit chunkier than the Skybuds, which is the major trade-off when comparing the two products. Companion app \nA companion app you can download from the App Store lets you see charge levels of earbuds and the charging case itself, as well as reinitiate the pairing process. \nYou can also choose to a factory reset of the Skybuds from the app and enable a “Power Saving Mode” that extends battery but reduces sound quality. The last thing these earbuds need is a dip in sound quality, but I found the battery life to live up to claims and therefore didn’t find myself wanting to enable this mode at the expense of audio fidelity. \nThe company says an update coming soon to the app will enable you to locate the Skybuds when lost if they’re in range of your phone. The competition \nCheck out the alternatives : Apple’s AirPods are still delayed, Sol Republic has superior sound but are slightly bulky compared to Skybuds, and the competition falls somewhere in between. \nSkybuds could still stand to lose 10-20% in overall size to make for an ideal fit for most people used to wearing traditional earbuds, but they are still one of the slimmest and more comfortable designs I’ve tried. Should you buy it? \nI’m holding off on cord-free earbuds personally, but if you have to get something today, before Apple launches it AirPods at $159, the Skybuds are an overall solid experience if ‘just okay’ sound quality is enough for your workouts or other use cases. If you’re happy with the sound on Apple’s EarPods, for example, but want something cord-free, that is essentially what you’re getting as far as sound quality is concerned. \nYou can buy them for $249 now from Best Buy . They come in nimbus, charcoal and pearl color options. \nIf you can put up with a slightly bulkier package and want something that sounds great, check out my review of the Sol Republic Amps Air .

      "text": " Apple's ( AAPL ) iPhone market share stands at 7%, its lowest in three years, partly due to the success of smartphone makers Oppo and Vivo , Bloomberg reports. Bloomberg News' Alex Webb joined \"Bloomberg Markets: Americas\" on Wednesday afternoon to talk about the story.\nThese two relatively unknown smartphone makers are both sub-brands of BBK Electronics and account for one out of every three smartphones sold in China in the third quarter.\nWhile the loss of market share for Apple can't be attributed to one reason, there are two \"sizable\" factors that contributed to the trend, Webb said.\nFirst, Oppo and Vivo got their products to market late last year and earlier this year, ahead of Apple's release of its iPhone 7 products this September, he noted. \"That of course gave them a head start in terms of stealing that market share from Apple.\"\nSecond, these two smartphone makers have built out sales channels into rural parts of the country, while Apple is mainly concentrated in cities, Webb said. Now Apple has expanded in recent years, but it's still offering \"a lot less\" than Oppo and Vivo in terms of incentives to local retailers to sell their products.\nOf course Apple is certainly not done in China, Webb noted. It can still win market share, but it just has to decide what it's willing to pay to build out a similar sales network in China. \"It's not a cheap prospect building out that sort of network. There's also the expectation that perhaps the appetite for super expensive iPhones in these parts of China is perhaps a little bit less than in the major metropolises where they are not on the same salaries\"",

      "text": "We're still not sure if Apple's surprise entry into the Black Friday sales season will result in manufacturer discounts to the iPhone 7, but its newest challenger will be part of a major promotion sure to catch the eye of anyone considering a switch.\nSEE ALSO: Google's new update will help you avoid holiday shopping crowds\nVerizon's recently announced Black Friday promotion isn't extensive, but what it lacks in length it makes up for in quality. Google quality, to be specific.\nVerizon will be debuting Google Home at a special price of $99.99 through Nov. 28 — the same discount from $129 Google itself teased earlier in the season. But there's a catch: it appears that the Verizon discount only applies to in-store purchases.\nAlong with the Home, Verizon is promoting its deals on the new Google Pixel smartphone, exerting its power as the exclusive wireless carrier for the handset. Unlike the discount on the Home, however, Verizon is breaking from Google and offering even more savings.\nThe discount is a bit complicated, so we'll break it down in its simplest terms: on Thanksgiving and Black Friday in Verizon Stores shoppers can get a new 32GB Pixel for $10 per month over a 24-month period. If you want more capacity, the 128GB version can be had for $15 per month over the same span of time. Importantly, this discount is only applicable to the standard model and not the XL, which was confirmed to Mashable by Verizon representatives. Other outlets, most notably Android Central , have reported that the discounts extended to all Pixel phones.\nNormally, the 32GB Pixel costs $27.08 per month, with a full a retail price of $649.99. The 128GB version clocks in at $31.24 per month, or $749.99.\nWith the discount, it comes out to $240.00 for the 32GB Pixel and $360.00 for the 128GB version — an incredible deal. But there is some fine print: a $649.99 device payment purchase is required. The promotional $409.99 bill credit will then be applied to the account over the 24-month period, and you're locked in for the full two years or face penalties. It's like any other phone plan — the real deal is in the low monthly payments.\nThe Pixel XL, meanwhile, can be had with no money down — if you're ready to trade in your current device. It's one of eight models that are eligible for a trade-in, along with the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus, the standard Pixel, Moto Z Droid, Moto Z Droid Force, Samsung S7 and S7 Edge. The trade-in devices are below:\nImage: verizon/screengrab\nAdditionally, customers can save $200 (with device payment) on any Android smartphone priced $400 or higher when switching to Verizon or adding a line to an existing account from Nov. 24 through Nov. 27. Current customers save $100 (with device payment) on any Android smartphone priced $400 or higher.\nOther discounts are available at Verizon stores and online, covering tablets, speakers and more. Check out the full list below:\nImage: verizon/screengrab\nWith a strong discount on the Pixel, Verizon and Google are looking to raise the stakes of the smartphone game. Even if the XL isn't included in the monthly promotion, this is a tough deal to pass up.\nBONUS: Here is everything you need to know about the new Google Pixel",

      "text": "Tech Video bug crashes Apple iPhones Devices that play the iPhone-killing video will remain usable for a couple of minutes before growing more sluggish and then crashing; but there are no long-term effects. PHOTO: Screenshot from EverythingApplePro YouTube video Clip seems to affect all versions of iOS back to iOS 5, leaving old and new phones unusable Tweet Published: 4:00 AM, November 24, 2016 \nSAN FRANCISCO — There is a new iPhone-killer on the loose, and it comes in the form of a video that can crash most of Apple’s phones. Playing the malicious video, which is circulating online, in Safari causes iPhones to slow down to a crawl until they stop working altogether. \nThe iPhone-freezing video, discovered by EverythingApplePro, is a short MP4 clip of someone standing by a bed with the words “Honey” written across the screen. \nAfter playing the clip, affected iPhones will remain usable for a couple of minutes before growing more sluggish and eventually crashing altogether. \nIt is not clear why the video has this effect, but it could be corrupted or infected with a malicious bug. It has the same result even if only partly played. \nThe video appears to have the same effect on all versions of iOS back to iOS 5, freezing old and new iPhones so that they are unusable. \nOn iOS 10.2 beta 3 it goes one step further by causing the phone to display the spinning wheel that normally indicates powering off. \nThe bug is reminiscent of the discovery of a certain date that could kill an iPhone and the “effective power” text message flaw that Apple fixed last year. \nIt does not seem to have the same result on Android and Windows devices. \nHow to protect your iPhone \nApple normally fixes bugs such as these in its software updates but until it does so, iPhone owners should be extra careful when clicking on suspicious or unsolicited links. \nIf someone sends you a link to a video that you do not recognise, avoid clicking on it until you know what it is. \nHow to fix your iPhone if you have seen the video \nIf you watch the video by mistake and your iPhone freezes up, you can fix your iPhone with a hard reboot. \nTo do this on any iPhone model other than the iPhone 7, press and hold the home and power buttons at the same time for at least 10 seconds until the Apple logo appears. \nOn an iPhone 7, you can hard reset by holding the power and volume decrease buttons. \nAfter the Apple logo appears, release the buttons and your iPhone should restart normally. \nThe video does not seem to have a long-term effect on the phones, according to 9to5Mac.

      "text": "Leave a comment \nApple has been granted a patent for a retro-style flip phone with an OLED screen display . \nThe patent, published yesterday , details a foldable potential future iPhone with a flexible OLED display that spans from edge to edge. \nSimilar to flip phones popularised in the 90s by brands like Motorola, the phone is capable of being folded in half across its middle. \nAccording to the patent, the phone would be split into two halves and joined by a hinge mechanism. The OLED screen itself doesn't split, and instead bends around the hinged case. \nConnections between the two case sections would be made through flexible printed circuit boards. \nApple is yet to make wide use of OLEDs, which emit light across a surface rather than from a specific point. However, it has introduced the technology through the Apple Watch, and sources – including blog Apple Insider – speculate that it is likely to feature in 2017's iPhone. \nIn one example, the proposed flexible screen folds over onto itself. But an opposite configuration describes the display as facing outward after folding, with clips for fastening onto a user's clothing. \nThe document also details options with two hinges and a glass covering, and with different viewing angles taken into consideration. \nApple famously files large numbers of patents each year, although most never come to fruition. Earlier this year, the company sent an application for a customisable keyless keyboard , and were last year granted a patent for a wireless headset that mounts an iPhone in front of the eyes.

Fold the bottom half up to envelop the apples. Half of the sliced apples should be sticking out. Starting with a short end, tightly roll the rectangle of apples so it looks like a rose. Continue filling and rolling apple roses.5. Beginning with the center rose and working around it, place apple roses close together in prepared pie dish. Bake for 50-60 minutes until crust is golden-brown. If browning too quickly, tent with foil. Cool for 10 minutes. Brush with more preserves.6. To serve, spoon some Apple Crme Anglaise onto a dessert plate and top with a piece of tart.7. For the Apple Crme Anglaise: prepare an ice bath. Set a medium-sized metal bowl aside, which fits inside the ice bath.8. Place a medium saucepan over medium heat. Add the half-and-half, vanilla beans and pod. When bubbles begin to form around the side of the pan, remove from heat. Remove and discard vanilla pod.9. Meanwhile, in a medium bowl, add the egg yolks, sugar and calvados. Whisk to combine. Starting with a tablespoon at a time, slowly add half of the hot half-and-half into the egg yolk mixture, while whisking vigorously. Pour mixture back into the saucepan and return to medium heat. Cook, stirring constantly, with a wooden spoon, until the sauce thickens, about 5 minutes.10. Transfer sauce to metal bowl and place over the ice bath, and stir to cool. Strain sauce if necessary.

      "text": "If the latest report from KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo is to be believed, Apple may switch from metal to glass for the iPhone 8 in order to support wireless charging.\n\nAccording to the note acquired by MacRumors , it's possible (as we've seen in other phones) to wirelessly charge through a metal chassis. But, according to the note, metal limits frequencies and can slow down charging. \nMORE: iPhone 8 Rumors: What to Expect from the 10th Anniversary iPhone \nThis wouldn't be the first glass iPhone — the 4 and 4s both had slick glass backs, although they were known for cracking when dropped. Around the Apple rumor mill, it's been suspected for a long time that Apple design lead Jony Ive has wanted to make an iPhone that looks like a sheet of glass .\n\nKuo is unsure whether or not every phone would be bundled with a wireless charger. He also predicts that the phone will come in two sizes , 4.7 and 5.5-inches. There have also been constant rumors about OLED displays, though recent reports suggest that supply chain restrictions may limit that to just the larger phone.\nWe have a long time to go until the iPhone 8, which will likely release next fall, assuming Apple maintains its normal pattern of yearly releases.\n[via MacRumors ]\nSee Also : 15 iPhone Tips Everyone Should Know \nThe Best Black Friday Tech Deals - Amazon, Newegg & More iPhone 7 vs. iPhone 7 Plus: Which One Should You Buy?

      "text": "This year, tech giant Apple Inc. ( AAPL - Free Report ) is teasing a one-day sales event on Friday, November 25, otherwise known as 2016 Black Friday. The company has been promoting the event through both an email campaign and on its website, telling Apple fans to “save the date.”\nApple has yet to reveal which products will be on sale, but its Apple Watch is prominently displayed on its homepage, suggesting that it will be a highlight of the company’s Black Friday sale. What we do know about Apple’s sale, however, is that shoppers will be eligible for free two-day delivery when they order in-stock items online before 5 p.m.\nThe iPhone maker offered no Black Friday deals last year. In the past, Apple has given away iTunes gift cards with certain purchases during the shopping holiday. It’s unclear if the deals will be online only or include in-store too, but it’s safe to say that this year, Apple may offer discounts on specific tech gadgets.\nFor many retailers, Black Friday and the rest of the holiday season are important for positive fourth quarter performance and top line goals. Apple, which has reported three consecutive quarters of year-over-year sales declines, is likely looking to change its negative revenue trend.\nIn addition to the Apple Watch, look for other Apple products like Macs, the iPhone, and the iPad to be on sale on Black Friday at Target ( TGT - Free Report ) , Best Buy ( BBY - Free Report ) , and Walmart ( WMT - Free Report ) .\nStocks that Aren't in the News…Yet \nYou are invited to download the full, up-to-the-minute list of 220 Zacks Rank #1 \"Strong Buys\" free of charge. Many of these companies are almost unheard of by the general public and just starting to get noticed by Wall Street. They have been pinpointed by the Zacks system that nearly tripled the market from 1988 through 2015, with a stellar average gain of +26% per year. See these high-potential stocks now >>",

      "title": "Apple's 2016 Black Friday Sale is First in Years",
      "text": "Trades from $ 3 \nThis year, tech giant Apple Inc. ( AAPL - Free Report ) is teasing a one-day sales event on Friday, November 25, otherwise known as 2016 Black Friday. The company has been promoting the event through both an email campaign and on its website, telling Apple fans to “save the date.” \nApple has yet to reveal which products will be on sale, but its Apple Watch is prominently displayed on its homepage, suggesting that it will be a highlight of the company’s Black Friday sale. What we do know about Apple’s sale, however, is that shoppers will be eligible for free two-day delivery when they order in-stock items online before 5 p.m. \nThe iPhone maker offered no Black Friday deals last year. In the past, Apple has given away iTunes gift cards with certain purchases during the shopping holiday. It’s unclear if the deals will be online only or include in-store too, but it’s safe to say that this year, Apple may offer discounts on specific tech gadgets. \nFor many retailers, Black Friday and the rest of the holiday season are important for positive fourth quarter performance and top line goals. Apple, which has reported three consecutive quarters of year-over-year sales declines, is likely looking to change its negative revenue trend. \nIn addition to the Apple Watch, look for other Apple products like Macs, the iPhone, and the iPad to be on sale on Black Friday at Target ( TGT - Free Report ) , Best Buy ( BBY - Free Report ) , and Walmart ( WMT - Free Report ) . \nStocks that Aren't in the News…Yet \nYou are invited to download the full, up-to-the-minute list of 220 Zacks Rank #1 \"Strong Buys\" free of charge.

      "text": "new hermes apple watch band series More Julian Chokkattu/Digital Trends\nHermes’ deal with Apple for the Apple Watch bands wasn’t a one-time thing, it seems. The company will be launching a slew of new bands on Thursday, according to recent reports.\nOne band, in particular, will be released by the company. It’s called the Equator Tatoutage. It’s designed by Robert Dallet and will be available in limited numbers, according to a report from Vogue . The band is based on the Simple Tour band already available for the Apple Watch, but with jungle imagery and a jaguar pattern.\nMore: A few great deals on accessories for iPad, iPhone, and Apple Watch\nAs a Hermes band, it won’t come cheap — to get one for yourself you will have to shell out about $442, which is quite a bit more than the standard Simple Tour band, which comes at $368 and is already one of the more expensive Apple Watch bands. You can only get the new band from a Hermes boutique.\nnew hermes apple watch band More new hermes apple watch band More Hermes is the only fashion-focused brand Apple has partnered with for the Apple Watch to date. The company has, however, also buddied up with Nike to offer the Apple Watch Nike+, which comes with a more sports-focused band. Of course, the actual watch itself is the same — it offers just as many fitness tracking features. You can also specifically buy the Apple Watch Hermes, though the only difference between that and a standard Apple Watch is its band and a few custom watch faces.\nThe Apple Watch, in general, has been touted as one of the more stylish smart offerings, despite the fact that some suggest it looks a little too modern to be a truly classic watch. While some would have preferred a round design, the device is sleek and modern, and partnerships like the one with Hermes helps make that even truer.\nThe Rolling Stones open multimedia gallery in New York Microsoft's Band 3 pictures leak, showing waterproofing, Features Here’s every Apple Watch model, finish, and band compared",

      "title": "Apple's iPhone Has Set a New Profit Record - Fortune",
      "text": "© 2016 Time Inc. All rights reserved. Apple’s iPhone Has Set a New Profit Record \nApple really knows how to make a buck. \nDuring the third quarter, Apple generated 91% of the smartphone market’s profits, setting a new quarterly record, research firm Strategy Analytics said on Tuesday. Apple secured $8.5 billion of the worldwide smartphone market’s $9.4 billion in profits during the period. \nApple was far ahead of China-based Huawei, which was able to nab 2.4% of the smartphone market’s profits with its $200 million handset net income. Vivo and Oppo, two other Chinese smartphone makers, captured the smartphone market’s remaining profits during the quarter, according to Strategy Analytics. \nApple’s AAPL profit was due in part to the successful launch of its iPhone 7 in September. However, the iPhone 7 was only available for a few weeks in the third quarter, meaning much of Apple’s profits came from older handsets, including the iPhone 6s and iPhone SE. Get Data Sheet , Fortune’s technology newsletter \nEarlier this month, BMO Capital Markets analyst Tim Long said in a research note that Apple had secured all of the smartphone market’s profits during the quarter. His calculation, which takes into account companies that lost money during the period, found that Apple also benefited from the demise of Samsung’s Galaxy Note 7. \n“Samsung had a weak third quarter, owing to halt and recall of the Galaxy Note 7,” Long wrote to investors. “After registering the highest operating margin since early 2014 last quarter, Samsung’s profitability fell to near-breakeven levels in September. Samsung’s market share slipped to 22% of global smartphone shipments in the quarter, and we model share to fall to the lowest level since mid-2011 next quarter.” \nIt’s notable that Samsung, which has been one of the more prominent smartphone makers in the world for the last several years, didn’t even make it into Strategy Analytic’s roundup of companies that generated a sizable profit last quarter. In earlier quarters, Apple and Samsung combined to capture most, if not all, of the smartphone market’s profits. \nWhile Strategy Analytics didn’t discuss Samsung’s troubles during the quarter, the company did say that the Chinese smartphone vendors were able to deliver appealing products while Samsung was dealing with the Galaxy Note 7 fallout. For more about Apple’s iPhone 7, watch: \n“Huawei, Vivo and OPPO have not only improved their smartphone product lineups this year, they have also enhanced their operational abilities and kept a tight lid on expanding distribution costs,” Linda Sui, Strategy Analytics director said in a statement. \nStill, the data suggests every other company has a long way to go to catch Apple in generating smartphone profits. Better yet for Apple, its record-breaking profits came despite iPhone unit sales slipping 5% and revenue sliding 13% during its last fiscal quarter ended Sept. 24.",

The iPhone 8 will have an active touchscreen area measuring 5.1 to 5.2-inches and Barclay's analyst says it will be bezel-less.Kuo now believes that Apple will keep the iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus names on the 2017 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch models respectively. Both of those units will continue to sport LCD screens. They both should be powered by the A11 chipset and all three units will feature an all-glass casing. This will allow the three new iPhone models to offer wireless charging at faster speeds. Metal casings tend to slow down the technology. Kuo also says that Foxconn will have its hands full with the OLED screen on the iPhone 8, leaving Pegatron to handle the wireless charging. \"We believe one of the reasons why new iPhones will switch from metal casing to glass casing is to support wireless charging. In order to ensure a superior performance, we believe it is most appropriate for EMS suppliers to develop and make the wireless charger because then a comprehensive test can be conducted. As Hon Hai needs to deploy most resources to develop and produce OLED iPhone, we expect Pegatron will be the exclusive supplier of the wireless charger.\"-Ming-Chi Kuo, Apple analyst, KGI Securities It isn't clear yet if Apple will support wireless charging on all three of next year's models. Ming-Chi sees some iPhone units coming with wireless charging capabilities next year, with wider support expected for 2018. PhoneArena is on Instagram .

      "text": "by Colin Gibbs | Nov 23, 2016 9:45am Apple's iPhone 7 helped the tech giant earn the lion's share of the smartphone industry's profits last quarter. Image: Apple \nThe worldwide smartphone market generated more than $9 billion in profits during the third quarter, according to fresh data from Strategy Analytics. And Apple raked in 91% of that sum. \n“We estimate the global smartphone industry realized total operating profits of $9.4 billion during Q3 2016,” Strategy Analytics Director Linda Sui said in a press release . “Apple’s ability to maximize pricing and minimize production cost is hugely impressive and the iPhone continues to generate monster profits. Huawei, Vivo and Oppo are the next three most-profitable smartphone vendors globally this quarter, but they are still a long way behind Apple.” \nIndeed, while Strategy Analytics pegged Apple’s smartphone operating profit at $8.5 billion, those three Chinese vendors each saw an estimated operating profit of $200 million during the quarter. The operating profit of all other vendors combined was also $200 million, according to Strategy Analytics. \nApple’s soaring profits come despite plateauing sales of the iPhone. Apple sold 45.5 million iPhones during the latest quarter, the company said last month, down from 48 million during the same period in 2015. And iOS captured only 12.1 percent of smartphone sales in the third quarter, Strategy Analytics said previously, down 5.2 percent year over year and marking its lowest level since 2014. \nRELATED: iPhone sales plummet in China in Q3 as Oppo, Vivo thrive \nMargins in the mobile hardware industry are notoriously razor-thin, but Apple continues to produce healthy profits due to its supply-chain management and its high-profile brand. The 32 GB iPhone 7 retails for $649, for instance, yet a report from IHS Market indicated materials for the phone cost roughly $220 , and assembling the device costs only $5 more. \nThe looming question, of course, is whether Apple can continue to generate big margins in a smartphone industry where many major markets have reached saturation and upgrade cycles have lengthened significantly. The company appeared to disappoint investors last month with its outlook for the current holiday quarter, and Google is making an aggressive play for the high end of the market with its Pixel. \nMeanwhile, competition is ramping up from Chinese vendors targeting relatively untapped markets across Asia. \n“Three of the world’s top four most profitable smartphone vendors are currently Chinese,” said Sui. “Huawei, Vivo and Oppo have not only improved their smartphone product lineups this year, they have also enhanced their operational abilities and kept a tight lid on expanding distribution costs.” Read more on",

      "text": "According to a new report by an analyst firm on the profits made by smartphone companies, it was revealed that Apple takes up the biggest chunk, hogging up 91 percent of the profit share pie. The ability to maintain such high profitability rate in the market has helped Apple take the top of the table in the profit share index made for the market by ‘Strategy Analytics.’ All other smartphone manufacturers are not above the 2.5 percent marker.\nImage Credit: Strategy Analytics\nHuawei is the second most profitable smartphone maker achieving 2.4 percent of operating profit share closely followed by Vivo and OPPO. According to the article, the 91 percent share translates to $8.5 billion cash along with all other smartphone makers not crossing the $0.2 billion regarding the operating profit. Furthermore, the report states that the global smartphones sale profits reached $9 billion during the period across the world.\nAccording to Linda Sui, the Director of Strategy Analytics, “Apple dominated and captured a record 91 percent share of all smartphone profits worldwide. Apple’s ability to maximise pricing and minimise production cost is hugely impressive and the iPhone continues to generate monster profits.” “Huawei captured 2 percent share of all smartphone profits, taking the second spot overall, and becoming the world’s most profitable Android vendor for the first time,” added Neil Mawston, Executive Director at Strategy Analytics.\nThe post Apple collected 91 percent profit share from global smartphone sales in the third quarter of 2016 appeared first on Tech2 .",

      "title": "Apple iPhone 8 will feature built-in wireless charging, claims analyst",
      "text": "Yes, after years of going mainstream on Android flagships, Apple may finally give in to wireless charging in the coming year with its tenth anniversary iPhone 8 models. As reported by 9to5Mac , analyst Ming-Chi Kuo from KGI Securities said that the 2017 iPhone, for the first time, will feature wireless charging.\nAccording to the analyst, who has a pretty good track record with predictions, Apple iPhone 8 owners will finally be able to charge their smartphones by simply placing them on the charging pad. Apple may choose to stick to the Qi wireless charging standard or go in for new branded technology of its own. Not too long ago, Bloomberg had reported that Apple is working on developing a long-range charging technology for future iPhones. But in his recent prediction, Kuo stated that the new iPhone would be charged in a manner similar to the Apple Watch.\nAnd to make this possible, Apple will need to switch to a glass back cover, unless it plans to include it as an add-on accessory in the form of protective case. With that said Nikkei previously hinted that Apple is working with Biel and Lens Technologies a Chinese company for supplying those glass backs.\nAnalyst predictions aside, it gets a bit obvious that Apple’s iPhones will need wireless charging going forward after the company skipped on the 3.5mm headphone jack with the iPhone 7.\nThe move was not well received , owing to a single lightening port that users had to deal with for both charging and listening to music. Users who did not have a Bluetooth headset, had to choose between charging their iPhone or listening to music as doing both was not possible with power as well as audio being routed through a single lightening port.\nIf Apple had to provide wireless charging built-in the iPhone 7, it would have made a bit of sense as those pricey wireless AirPods don’t come bundled with the iPhone 7.\nApple is expected to launch three iPhone 8 models in the coming year. A 4.7-inch iPhone 8 along with the standard 5.5-inch model is expected to be joined by a new 5-inch model that will bridge the gap between the two. The iPhone 8 Plus is also expected to feature an OLED display with curved edges.\nThe post Apple iPhone 8 will feature built-in wireless charging, claims analyst appeared first on Tech2 .",

      "title": "John Gruber on Jony Ive’s Role at Apple",
      "text": "| Cool Stuff Found \nThere’s been discussion for a while now that Jony Ive was on his way out at Apple, or that he was trying to leave. My favorite was when being promoted to the C-Suite in Cupertino was somehow proof that he was leaving. That doesn’t make sense. Seems Apple’s new coffee table book, Designed by Apple in California , is also being seen as some kind of swan song for Sir Jony. John Gruber’s The Talk Show podcast added fuel to such speculation, but Mr. Gruber posted a written piece arguing the opposite was his intent, saying: “Fundamentally I think Jony Ive loves Apple, feels a responsibility to the legacy of his collaboration with Steve Jobs, and that whatever aspirations he has for the remainder of his career, personally, they’re only possible at Apple.” I agree with that. Sir Jony has a bit more freedom these days to do side projects like Claridge’s Christmas Tree , but he’s not leaving Apple for a long while to come. Mr. Gruber’s piece is solid analysis, and I recommend it.",

      "text": "| Cool Stuff Found \nA friend of mine let me know last night that Australian Apple customers were also emailed about a Black Friday sale. To my knowledge, this is the first time Australia has been included in Apple’s Black Friday sales, in part because Black Friday isn’t a thing in Aussieland. As with other markets getting this sale, the Apple.com/au site has a landing page featuring an Apple Watch, with the message that, “Friday can’t come soon enough.” I’m noting this because it shows a push by Apple to make a splash with this sale. As I said, Black Friday isn’t a thing Down Under. Not only is there no “Thanksgiving” holiday weekend happening (there is a “Thanksgiving” celebration unrelated to our Pilgrims, of course), but holiday shopping has a more general ramp up than it does in the States. That said, American culture pushes out to many corners of the world, and the idea of “Black Friday” as a time for sales isn’t unheard of. It’s merely uncommon. Jeff Gamet and I discussed this on Wednesday’s Apple Context Machine. It’s possible that Apple is feeling the need to goose December quarter sales. Share this:",

      "text": "President-elect Donald Trump told The New York Times he got a call from Apple CEO Tim Cook , and they talked about bringing more production back to the U.S. Here's what Trump said on Tuesday, according to a transcript from the Times :\n\"I was honored yesterday, I got a call from Bill Gates , great call, we had a great conversation, I got a call from Tim Cook at Apple, and I said, 'Tim, you know one of the things that will be a real achievement for me is when I get Apple to build a big plant in the United States, or many big plants in the United States, where instead of going to China, and going to Vietnam, and going to the places that you go to, you're making your product right here.' He said, 'I understand that.' I said: 'I think we'll create the incentives for you, and I think you're going to do it. We're going for a very large tax cut for corporations, which you'll be happy about.'\"\nWe don't know Cook's side of the conversation, though CNBC has reached out to Apple for comment. In a wide-ranging interview Tuesday, Trump told Times reporters that by cutting regulations, bringing production back to the United States would boost jobs and further America's position in the robotics industry.\nTrump promised during his campaign to lower the business tax rate to 15 percent and allow the one-time repatriation of corporate profits held offshore at a tax rate of 10 percent. With a 26 percent tax rate and $216 billion stored offshore, Apple could be the biggest beneficiary in tech of the policies, according to Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi. Cook has said he would love to repatriate Apple's cash, if not for the \" unreasonable,\" \"backward\" and \"awful \" tax rate.\n\"I tell you, one thing I would say, so, I'm giving a big tax cut and I'm giving big regulation cuts, and I've seen all of the small business owners over the United States, and all of the big business owners, I've met so many people,\" Trump told the Times . \"They are more excited about the regulation cut than about the tax cut. And I would've never said that's possible, because the tax cut's going to be substantial. You know we have companies leaving our country because the taxes are too high. But they're leaving also because of the regulations.\"\nBut Trump has also proposed adding one regulation — tariffs on trade with China — that Deutsche Bank said could hurt Apple more than any other technology company. Apple's supplier dossier lists about 350 addresses in China, and Greater China is the company's third-biggest market, behind Europe and the United States.\nCook has been credited for finding the best suppliers and talent around the world since he arrived at Apple, slashing inventory costs and halving the production time for computers, according to biographer Walter Isaacson. The feat earned him a place as one of Steve Jobs' top deputies, before being named CEO.\nReturning manufacturing to the United States — likely a costly proposition for Apple — might cause jobs to be replaced by robots, Trump said. But those robots would also be American made in the Rust Belt, Trump added in the contentious meeting with the Times .\n\"Right now we don't make the robots,\" Trump said. \"We don't make anything. But we're going to, I mean, look, robotics is becoming very big and we're going to do that. We're going to have more factories. We can't lose 70,000 factories. Just can't do it. We're going to start making things.\"\nFor the full transcript, read the article at NYTimes.com.",

      "text": "  \n(REUTERS/Beck Diefenbach) (L to R) Google Wifi, Google Chromecast Ultra, Google Home, Google Pixel XL, Google Pixel and Google Dreamview VR are displayed during the presentation of new Google hardware in San Francisco, California, U.S. October 4, 2016. \nA lot of techies are looking forward to Google's new gadgets, which is why there is much anticipation for the upcoming Nexus 7 tablet. \nAs one of the world's leading technology companies, Google has been able to produce stellar gadgets that please many Android users. With that, there is a lot of excitement for the next installment of the product line, which is rumored to be the Google Nexus 7 tablet. Though there is still no official news regarding the Google Nexus 7 tablet, many expect the device to bring a lot of competitive features to the line. \nThe device is rumored to run on Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 processor as well as the Adreno 530 graphics processing unit. It is said to have 4GB of RAM as well as 64 GB of internal storage. Sized at 7 inches, the device will have a display resolution of 1440 by 2560. \nThere are also speculations that the new tablet will run using Android Andromeda, which will merge the Android and Chrome OS platforms. This could bring an interesting new touch to the device. However, there are also reports stating that the Android Andromeda will only be used for the Google laptops. Advertisement \nCompared to leading brands such as Samsung and Apple, the Google Nexus tablet is expected to be better in terms of hardware and software. With that, there has yet to be any news on other features such as retina scanners or dual lens cameras. \nAside from that, there are also rumors that Google might end up ditching the Nexus branding altogether. Since they recently released the Google Pixel smartphone, many believe that a Pixel tab could be presented soon. \nHowever, there has yet to be a date for when the next Google tablet will be available in the market. It is believed that the device could be launched by the end of the year. Unfortunately, Google has yet to announce any release date.  ",

      "text": "You are at: Home » Apple » Apple’s Free ‘Hour Of Code’ Workshops To Be Held In Its Stores Next Month Apple’s Free ‘Hour Of Code’ Workshops To Be Held In Its Stores Next Month Apple , Technology Registration Is Now Open For Apple’s Free Hour Of Code Workshops \nTo celebrate annual Computer Science Education Week, Apple will be offering free Hour of Code Workshops from December 5-11 at all of Apple’s 487 retail stores spread across the world. \nCode.org hosts Hour of Code, a global initiative every year, targeted at teaching the basics of computer programming tutorials to students. Hour of Code is sponsored by a number of technology companies that use their own products and services to help get students excited about coding. \nThese events aim to teach a bit of coding in the space of an hour, not only proving that you can get across complicated learning’s in a fun and simple way, but also get that message across to growing minds, shaping them with strings of characters and variables with the hope that they will be able to turn these into award winning apps and a career later on. \nSince its inception in 2013, Apple has participated in Hour of Code. This year the company is ramping up its involvement in the event. Apple is introducing its Swift programming language to young coders in most of the workshops. Attendants will also be offered an introduction to Swift Playgrounds, which is a free iPad app that helps teach users how to develop with Apple’s own coding language, Swift. \nApple is also developing tools for educators to use in their environments beyond just the Hour of Code event itself. The package includes a “facilitator guide” with lessons and group activities. Apple also beefed up “Apple Teacher,” a self-paced program for teachers, with new resources, a badging system, and other tools for Swift Playground. \n“Hour of Code embodies our vision for Apple stores as a place for the community to gather, learn and be entertained,” said Angela Ahrendts, Apple’s Senior Vice President of Retail. “We’re proud to introduce the Swift Playgrounds app into the workshops and honored to again work side-by-side with Code.org on this incredibly important initiative. Hour of Code is one of the absolute highlights of the year for both our teams and the families that visit our stores.” \nIf you are unable to make it to an Apple Store, the app will feature Hour of Code challenge that will allow anyone to create their own one-hour coding event. The app will also be updated with a Learn to Code 3 set of lessons and a companion teacher’s guide for educators. \nYou can sign up for the free workshops by finding a nearby store here , and then picking a free time, and signing in with an Apple ID to complete the registration.",

      "text": "Rumors surrounding the next iPhone keep coming.\nApple will be transitioning its iPhone design to an all-glass casing in next year’s new iPhones, KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo wrote to investors this week, according to Apple-tracking site Macrumors, which obtained a copy of the research note.\nKuo, who is one of the more reliable Apple forecasters, cited sources who said the glass casing would make it easier for Apple to deliver wireless charging in next year’s handsets. But he’s unsure whether Apple would bundle wireless chargers, which can be expensive, with next year’s iPhone. At least one iPhone model will come with a wireless charger, according to the report.\nKuo has been one of the more vocal Apple prognosticators over the last few years. His recent investor notes include predictions that Apple is planning a major update to the iPhone next year that could include three different versions.\nThe first, he has said, would come with the same 4.7-inch screen in this year’s iPhone 7. Apple AAPL could deliver a 5.5-inch iPhone next year, along with an all-new smartphone that could feature a 5.8-inch screen . That handset would come with new screen technology, called organic light-emitting diode, and its display would be curved.\nGet Data Sheet , Fortune’s technology newsletter\nBut Kuo isn’t alone. Other analysts and market researchers have also predicted a big iPhone update from Apple next year , which could include a curved screen and larger display. There’s also been talk over the last several months of Apple offering wireless charging and an all-glass enclosure . In the 5.8-inch iPhone Kuo has predicted will reach store shelves, it’s believed the display would take up the entire face of the iPhone, eliminating areas above and below the screen where the home button and earpiece reside. Apple might also bake its Touch ID fingerprint-sensing technology into the glass.\nAccording to Kuo, the all-glass design makes it easier to wirelessly charge devices compared to metal, the material Apple currently uses for its iPhone. He added that Apple design chief Jony Ive has wanted to deliver an iPhone that looked like it was made from a single piece of glass.\nFor more about Apple’s iPhone 7, watch:\nStill, it’s impossible to know for sure whether Kuo’s sources are correct or if Apple is planning something radically different for next year’s iPhone. While the next iPhone is believed to be known as the iPhone 8, it might also get iPhone 7s branding. It could also come with an all-new name to commemorate the iPhone’s 10th anniversary.\nApple hasn’t commented on its future plans.",

      "text": "Folding iPhones could be the future for Apple INQUIRER.net / 01:53 PM November 24, 2016 Apple has filed a patent for folding phone. Could folding smartphones be the next battle grounds for smartphone manufacturers? Image INQUIRER.net \nWay back in 2013, Samsung unveiled the very first flexible phone prototype at CES (Consumer Electronics Show). While it has not come out yet with a smartphone with folding screen, Apple is looking to join the folding-screen bandwagon, a recent report hints. Image INQUIRER.net \nTech Radar reports that the hint came from a patent that Apple Insider discovered. It was labeled as U.S. Patent No. 9,504,170 “flexible display devices” and shows a handset with details on how it can be folded in half. Image INQUIRER.net \nSeveral versions were also illustrated including devices that can fold in on itself like a traditional clamshell device and another that can fold in a way that leaves the screen visible, but cut in half. Another interesting illustration is a device that has two hinges and folds in three ways. ADVERTISEMENT \nConsidering Samsung has yet to present a folding smartphone since its prototype in 2013, it’s fairly safe to assume that a folding iPhone may still take a few more years to develop.

      "text": "iOS 10 Jailbreak Tool Update: Pangu Jailbreak Tool Ready To Release In December; Can It Keep Up With Apple's Fast-Paced iOS Update? By Kate Martinez   23, 10:21 pm User named SAVAGE demonstrates how Cydia can be downloaded using an iOS 10 Jailbreak Tool.(Photo : SAVAGE/YouTube) \nThe jailbreak community has been waiting long and hard for the hacking teams to finally come out with an iOS 10 jailbreak tool that will be effective in installing apps that Apple does not approve. China-based jailbreak team, Pangu, reportedly has the tool and is on the verge of rolling it out to the public. Advertisement \nApple has been consistent in giving updates to its latest iOS as they have been very vigilant about the possibility of being hacked, especially with the jailbreaking teams doing their efforts to create a tool for iOS 10. It took a while for the iOS 10 jailbreak tool to arrive, but the wait may be worth it after all. \nSeveral reports claim that Pangu managed to develop an iOS 10 jailbreak tool and is expected to be released next month. However, Apple is about to release its iOS 10.2, which brings in doubts if the iOS 10 jailbreak tool can be used when the latest iOS update becomes available. \nIt is believed that Pangu will release the iOS 10 jailbreak tool as soon as Apple launches the iOS 10.2 to the public. The well-known jailbreak team will reportedly keep up with the pace by releasing an iOS 10.2 jailbreak tool with several improvements and bug fixes. Pangu's latest jailbreak tool is for iOS 9.3, according to Redmond Pie . \nThe Cupertino-based tech company earlier claimed that the recent iOS is their most secured operating system, but this has been proven otherwise as there are several developers who claimed to have jailbroken the OS. There are developers who apparently jailbroken iOS 10.1.1 using iPhone 7 and iOS 10.2 for iPad, iPad Touch and iPhone. It is only a matter of time before the iOS 10 jailbreak tool comes out for public consumption. \nIn related news, Apple announced that 10.2 update is ready to be released in December and is ready to combat against the iOS 10 jailbreak tool that Pangu has developed. However, this should still be seen once the iOS 10.2 update and the iOS 10 jailbreak tool of Pangu are released. \nDo you think Pangu will be able to keep up with Apple's fast-paced iOS 10 update?

      "text": "Translate \nFederal auto safety regulators are asking Apple, Samsung and other Smartphone makers to do more to increase driver safety. \nThe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration on Wednesday released the second phase of its Driver Distraction Guidelines , calling for phone makers to create a ‘driver mode,’ which would prevent people from using distracting apps and programs while driving. \n“NHTSA has long encouraged drivers to put down their phones and other devices, and just drive,” said NHTSA administrator Dr. Mark Rosekind. “With driver distraction one of the factors behind the rise of traffic fatalities, we are committed to working with the industry to ensure that mobile devices are designed to keep drivers’ eyes where they belong — on the road.” \nThe goal of the guidelines, the NHTSA said, would be to ensure certain activities that would “interfere with the driver’s ability to safely control the vehicle” — such as displaying videos or social media posts — would be blocked while driving. \nThe guidelines emphasize the necessity for manufacturers to implement features such as pairing, where a portable device is linked to a vehicle’s infotainment system, as well as Driver Mode. Pairing and Driver Mode combined help to reduce distractions because they limit the time a driver’s eyes are off the road, while at the same time preserving the full functionality of these devices when they are used at other times. \n“As millions of Americans take to the roads for Thanksgiving gatherings, far too many are put at risk by drivers who are distracted by their cellphones,” said U.S. Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx. “These common sense guidelines, grounded in the best research available, will help designers of mobile devices build products that cut down on distraction on the road.” \nThe agency is seeking public comments on the proposed guidelines at Regulations.gov .

      "text": "0 The new iPad Pro is seen on display during an event at the Apple headquarters in Cupertino, California March 21, 2016. Reuters/Stephen Lam \nCupertino tech giant Apple has announced a one day sale on Nov. 25 as part of Black Friday 2016. Apple has been vigorously promoting the event, even asking fans to save the date. The one day sale is visible on Apple website too. Moreover, the company has also initiated an e-mail campaign to entice fans to the event. \nAccording to Yahoo! Finance , Apple did not provide any Black Friday deals in 2015. The iPhone maker has offered iTunes gift cards in the past with certain purchases. This time, it is still not known, whether the Apple deals will be limited to online only or Apple stores will also join in. However, one thing’s for sure, Apple will offer discounts on specific gadgets. \nIt is also uncertain which products will have the deals on Black Friday 2016 though the Apple Watch is clearly showcased on the official website. Thus, the Apple Watch could be the prime focus for the Apple Black Friday 2016 sale. Shoppers need to order in-stock items online before 5pm to be eligible for the free two-day delivery. \nApart from the Apple Watch, buyers should also be on the lookout for deals on other Apple products such as iPhone, iPad and the Macs from Best Buy, Walmart and Target. \nMeanwhile, fans are eagerly waiting for the Apple iPad Pro 2 to be released and many tech enthusiasts and Apple fans believe, it will be unveiled early 2017. The upcoming iPad may sport some top-class features such as the Touch ID, True Tone Display, Smart Connector, True Tone flash, four speakers and 12MP rear-facing iSight camera. \nJapanese blog Mac Otakara has predicted that the Apple iPad Pro 2 will be shipped in three display variants, 7.9-inch, 10.1-inch, and 12.9-inch, during Spring 2017. \nStay tuned on IBT AU for more update on Apple iPad Pro and Apple Back Friday 2016 deals.",

      "text": "0 Shoppers walk past a reflection of a Santa Claus in the window of the Apple Store in the Back Bay neighborhood of Boston, Massachusetts November 28, 2008. Reuters/Brian Snyder (UNITED STATES) \nApple is planning a one-day shopping event on Black Friday for its customers in Australia. Not much is known about the tech giant's promo, with its website only teasing customers of its \"one-day shopping event\" on Friday. \nThe announcement on Apple's website did not give much details, with only an Apple watch as the main image, perhaps indicating that the product would be prominent in the promotion. \n\"Friday can't come soon enough,\" the announcement on Apple Australia 's page reads. \"Our one-day shopping event will be here before you know it. Come back this Friday to tick everyone off your list.\" \nLast year, Apple did not join other retailers in offering massive discounts on their products for Black Friday. It's unclear if the iPhone-maker will include purchases made from physical Apple stores for this year's event or if discounts, if there are any, would only affect products bought online. The company also did not include the products that will be offered for the one-day shopping event. \nAustralian online retailer Kogan, meanwhile, has already announced the included Apple products and their prices for Black Friday. The new iPhone 7 Plus, which originally retails for $1,239, will have a small discount of $30. Customers will find a bigger discount of about $100 when they buy iPhone 7, which costs $969, though.",

People across the U.S. will be getting together Thursday with those closest to them to celebrate Thanksgiving. And you know what comes after that? Shopping! \nThat's right, before you've even had a chance to digest that scrumptious turkey, Black Friday takes center stage. There is some good news, though, Apple is making your gift shopping a little bit easier this year. \nApple has announced that it will be holding a one-day Black Friday sales event. You will be able to take advantage of these sale prices online. This means you don't have to fight the enormous crowds and the wintery weather to scoop up the deals. You can buy the latest gadgets from the comfort of your own home. \nApple is being pretty secretive on which items are going to have reduced prices. Its site does show that you will receive free two-day delivery on in-stock items ordered by 5 p.m. Friday, November 25. \nOn Black Friday in years past, Apple has discounted popular gadgets such as the Mac and iPad. One year they offered special prices on bundled gift cards. On its sale page this year, they are showing a list of holiday gift collections to choose from. \nThis sale marks the return of Apple taking part in Black Friday. The tech giant skipped the massive one-day sale event last year. \nClick here if you want to take a look at Apple's Black Friday sale page. Happy shopping! More news stories you can't miss:",

      "text": "Apple iPhone 8 to have wireless charging, new 5.2-inch OLED design: Report Apple iPhone 8 to have wireless charging, new 5.2-inch OLED design: Report Apple iPhone 8 smartphones will be coming with wireless charging, but might not be shipping with the wireless charger according to reports By: Tech Desk | Published:November 24, 2016 12:30 pm Apple is expected to launch a third iPhone 8 smartphone with a 5.2-inch display and a bezel-less design \nApple is expected to bring wireless charging for the first time with its iPhone 8 smartphone in 2017, according to trusted Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo (KGI Securities). According to Kuo, iPhone 8 users will be able to charge the phone’s battery using a wireless charging system similar to the one on Apple Watches, but Apple-being-Apple might not be shipping the wireless charger with the box – and might be charging separately for it. \nApple’s biggest competitor, Samsung has had wireless charging for the longest time; but the Cupertino giant has up until now refrained from inducting the technology into their phones. Kuo says that even while Android devices (with plastic and metal backs) from a range of different manufacturers feature wireless charging, the expected glass body of the iPhone 8 will help achieve faster speeds in wireless charging with ‘minimum disruption from frequency interference’. Kuo’s report is in line with an earlier report by BGR that also claimed that the 2017 iPhones will be getting wireless charging. Apple is expected to become more aggressive in adoption of wireless charging through 2018. \nAn earlier report by Kuo has hinted at Apple planning to launch a bezel-less OLED iphone 8, along with the revisions of the two standard 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch displays next year. All three phones are expected to come with glass casings and incorporate wireless charging. \nRead: Apple iPhone 4 survives over a year at the bottom of a lake, still works \nKuo has said that the larger 5.5-inch ‘Plus’ model will no more be the high-end flagship, with the OLED iPhone expected to be technically superior to the other two phones. He has also said that the optical image stabilisation (OIS) will be coming to both the wide-angle and telephoto lens next year. © The Indian Express Online Media Pvt Ltd Tags:",

      "text": "One controversy surrounding Apple 's (NASDAQ: AAPL) latest MacBook Pro computers is that users can't configure them to include 32 gigabytes of system memory, also known as RAM. Those shiny new computers are limited to 16 gigabytes of RAM.\nContinue Reading Below\nImage source: Apple.\nThough 16 gigabytes is probably more than enough RAM for most consumers, there are professionals, prosumers , and possibly even spec-geeks who want even more.\nHere's the latest explanation Apple marketing guru Phil Schiller gave one developer for this limitation, via AppleInsider :\nMore From Fool.com Motley Fool Founders Issue New Stock Buy Alert Forget GE! Heres how to play the largest growth opportunity in history Forget Apple! Heres a Better Stock to Buy He Made 21,078% Buying Amazon. Heres His New Pick\nThe MacBook Pro uses 16 GB of very fast LPDDR memory, up to 2133MHz. To support 32 GB of memory would require using DDR memory that is not low power and also require a different design of the logic board, which might reduce space for batteries. Both factors would reduce battery life.\nIt has been suggested that Apple could avoid this battery life/RAM capacity trade-off in its MacBook Pro computers if it equipped them with a newer memory type known as LPDDR4.\nContinue Reading Below",

      "text": "Search Ads are just the beginning of a big year for Apple. The public-facing changes made to the App Store in Fall 2016 have been nothing short of monumental, but for Apple the shift marks only the beginning of a new methodology for interacting with developers and consumers. As we roll into 2017, Apple’s recent updates will begin to solidify into a new App Store hierarchy, one which will include Search Ads as a core pillar and send a friendlier message to developers.\nApp Store Optimization experts have been preparing for a major shift in the App Store for some time now. After all, Google introduced Search Ads to the Play Store in February of 2015, themselves following in Facebook’s footsteps. Apple is methodical, though, and the inevitable rollout of ads has come to impact the entire App Store experience.\nFirst, the ads themselves. Over 65% of all app installs originate from search. The implementation of Search Ads represents one of two prongs in a tactic by Apple to move App Store search away from long, overstuffed app titles and back into a realm they can control and monetize in-house. Now, developers will be able to create Search Ads using the metadata (title, keywords and description) from their App Store listing, set their own budget, and easily launch ads targeting specific search terms relevant to their apps.\n\nThe other side of the coin here is the need for shorter App Store titles. Apple recently sliced the title character limit from 255 characters to a mere 50, chopping off a whopping 80% of available title real estate. A popular tactic in ASO has always been title tagging, or placing relevant, highly-searched keywords in the title as a sort of subtitle or explanation of the app’s features. Nothing has changed regarding the practice itself; it’s still a great way to increase your app’s rankings portfolio and inform users about the many functions of your app. Now, you just have significantly less space in which to do it.\nShortened titles and App Store Search Ads have already rolled out, but their effects will be felt well into 2017. Apps that don’t shorten their titles after a warning from Apple will be removed from the store within 30 days, potentially clearing hundreds of thousands of apps from the App Store.\n\nWhile Apple may be clearing out thousands of apps from the store, the increased focus on shortened titles and Search Ads will make ASO more important than ever. It’s worth noting that when you create an ad, you will only be able to target and bid on keywords that are relevant to your app. The way that you make an app relevant for keywords is through ASO. Creating relevancy for highly-searched keywords and phrases in Search Ads should be a great way to expand your potential audience, with built-in analytics giving you the tools to prepare and maintain a successful campaign.\nThis leads to the third pillar of Apple’s App Store renovation, one which hasn’t been as public facing. In general, Apple is maneuvering their revenue sharing model to prioritize subscription-based apps as services such as Netflix, Spotify and HBO NOW remain fixtures on the Top 10 Grossing charts.\nApple announced earlier this year that they would be altering the cut of revenue given to certain developers. The company has traditionally taken a 30 percent cut of app revenue, and this will remain the case for most apps. For subscription-based services, however, Apple will reduce that cut to 15 percent once a user has maintained a subscription for over a year. This in turn incentivizes higher quality and retention for the services themselves. The change comes as more and more services begin to explore the subscription model.\nSo how do these changes impact your app? If you run a subscription-based service, Apple’s revenue changes should make retaining subscribers even more of a priority, with the chance to increase your cut of subscriptions to a hefty 85 percent.\nApps with more traditional revenue models aren’t going to be left in the dust, though. With potentially hundreds of thousands of abandoned apps leaving the store and Search Ads taking over as a core pillar of optimization, Apple is paving the way for a less cluttered App Store. To take advantage of this, you must pinpoint the highly-searched keywords that your app ranks for, determine potential keywords which your app has yet to break into, and funnel the above information into a new optimization - potentially including Search Ads to expand your search profile.\nThanks to Dave Bell for sharing his advice and opinions in this post.

The smartphone is rumoured to bring cutting-edge features to market, especially in terms of its design. Concept Image \nA major highlight of iPhone 8 smartphone would be its OLED display. The front-facing camera and home button with touch ID fingerprint sensor will be integrated into the display itself. Unlike the usual iPhones, the phone will come wrapped in an all-glass body, reports Forbes . \nAdding to these, MacRumors has released a research note by Ming-Chi Kuo, an analyst at KGI Securities. It reveals few features of the new iPhone 8. According to the leak, there will be three models of iPhone 8 – one curved 5.8-inch OLED model and two TFT-LCD models with 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch screen sizes. The new iPhone models will come with dual cameras and dual optical image stabilization (OIS). The 4.7-inch model may exclude one these features. \nApple is also expected to bring some revisions in the lens of iPhone 8’s camera. “ We believe Apple will add OIS function to the telephoto CCM in order to enhance the selling points of next year’s new iPhone. We think photo quality and optical zoom range may both improve as a result. We expect the telephoto lens will be redesigned to support OIS in the telephoto CCM, with challenges likely coming from (1) the need to increase the image circle of the telephoto lens, which will lead to longer calibration time and a more complex assembly processes; and (2) a redesign of the telephoto lens, as an increased image circle will result in degraded photo quality around the corners ,” MacRumors quoted Kuo.",

      "text": "  \n(Apple) Shown in photo is the iPad Air 2 \nA lot of iPad Air fans were disappointed when Apple made no mention of the iPad Air 3 during its major events this year. However, it did not also dispel their interest as to what the upcoming device will possibly feature when it finally arrives. New rumors are hinting that the new device is set to be released in March 2017. \nSeveral reports mentioned that the iPad Air 3 will come with a considerably attractive design and specifications. For one, it is expected to feature a new Apple Pencil that is believed to attract more consumers. Rumors also suggest that it will include a high definition 4K resolution that comes with 3D Touch technology. \nIt is also highly likely that some iPhone 7 features will also appear in the iPad Air 3 such as the rear camera set up. In addition to it is the possible inclusion of the A9 processor with a 3 GB RAM that will guarantee faster processing and the efficient function of its applications. \nOther reports suggest it might also feature Apple's A10 processor that boasts of two energy-saving cores used for light and an additional two more to be used in high performance functions. If the iPad Air 3 proceeds with an A10 processor, this means a boost in the tablet's battery life. Advertisement \nAdditionally, the iPad Air 3 is also expected to have a 4-speaker audio system, lightning ports, Bluetooth, fingerprint scanning technology, and the highly anticipated touch ID. It will definitely be smaller and thinner that its predecessor featuring a 9.7-inch frame. \nIt is also highly likely that it will be available in 16 GB and 32 GB models. Possible color options for the much-anticipated device are Jet Black and Rose Gold, with the latter being very attractive to female users. \nWhen it comes to the possible price of the tablet, reports suggest it might start at $610. Apple has yet to make a formal announcement regarding the tablet's initial price offer.  ",

      "text": "Donald Trump Says He’s Discussed Making Apple Products in the US With Tim Cook Donald Trump wants Apple products to be made in the US Doing so could reportedly double the cost of making an iPhone Apple has been assembling the Mac Pro in the US since 2013 \nThe 45th President-elect of the United States, Donald Trump, is said to have spoken to Apple CEO Tim Cook about manufacturing the company's products in the US. \nIn an interview with the New York Times , Trump recounted a recent phone call with the Apple CEO where he said, “Tim, you know one of the things that will be a real achievement for me is when I get Apple to build a big plant in the United States, or many big plants in the United States, where instead of going to China, and going to Vietnam, and going to the places that you go to, you’re making your product right here”. \nBringing manufacturing back to the United States was one of the promises of Donald Trump’s presidential campaign. But as The Verge reports , convincing American companies to manufacture in the US isn’t going to be easy. Relatively cheaper labour isn’t the only reason a majority of electronics are manufactured in China. A product like the iPhone is made out of many separate components, which are also made in China. To get all those parts exported to the United States only to assemble there will reportedly more than double the manufacturing cost. Currently, it is estimated that it costs Apple $224.80 (roughly Rs. 15,300) to manufacture one iPhone 7, which ultimately retails for $649 (roughly Rs. 44,240) in the US.\nAlthough Apple didn’t confirm the conversation between Cook and Trump, just last week there were reports of the Cupertino company considering manufacturing iPhones in the US. Also, Trump is said to do his bit in offering “a large large tax cut for corporations” and removal of regulations, among other things to ease setting up manufacturing in the United States again. \nApple has tried manufacturing low-volume products locally like the Mac Pro in 2013 . Other electronics makers like Motorola also tried manufacturing their Android smartphones in the US around that time , only to shut it down a year later after being acquired by Chinese giant Lenovo.",

      "text": "Reddit \nThe iPad lineup is getting some sort of a shakeup next year, seemingly with the introduction of a new 10.5-inch model. Apple’s existing lineup of form factors comprises a 7.9-inch iPad mini , 9.7-inch iPad Air and iPad Pro , and a 12.9-inch iPad Pro . \nThe 10.5-inch would apparently slot in between those tiers targeting enterprise, education and other sectors, according to Digitimes . iPad updates are ‘due’ with all models being more than a year old by next March. \nThe new 10.5-inch size would be introduced alongside the other three iPad screen sizes according to the report with production to begin as soon as December. This means new iPads could be officially unveiled as soon as January although a March event is probably more likely given Apple’s typical product launch patterns. \nIf these comments sound familiar, it is because they mirror an August report from KGI’s Ming-Chi Kuo . Kuo said that OLED iPads wouldn’t launch until 2018, despite the new OLED iPhone coming in 2017, and that the 2017 iPad Pro updates would feature the Apple A10X CPU, a faster SoC iteration of the (already) speedy chip in the iPhone 7. \nThe addition of a 10.5-inch screen size is a little puzzling as it is not that different from the 9.7-inch size. Digitimes says 10-inch and larger tablets are popular with education and enterprise markets but the current mid-range iPad is slightly too small to meet those requirements. Conversely, the 12.9-inch iPad Pro offering is slightly too big and slightly too pricey. \nAlong with the 10.5-inch iPad, it appears that the 9.7-inch model will be pushed further downmarket with lower-priced 9.7-inch iPads in development, logically as a continuation of the iPad Air line. The fate of the 7.9-inch iPad mini remains uncertain with no news about any changes coming to the product. Guides",

      "text": "A + Apple Black Friday Roundup: Find the best deals & lowest prices on iPhone, MacBook, iPad, iMac and Apple Watch By Thursday, November 24, 2016, 03:09 am PT (06:09 am ET) While Apple is expected to offer some form of Black Friday promotion later this week, the company's top authorized resellers —which have historically offered much better deals —have already launched their Black Friday sales. Here's everything you need to know. Black Friday 2016 is almost here and AppleInsider is scouring the web looking for the best deals on Apple MacBooks, iPads, iPhones, cameras and even drones. Be sure to check back as this page will be updated as more deals become available. All of the following top offers have been carefully curated from our live Apple Price Guides . This roundup also assumes you live outside NY State. If you live inside NY State, tax incentives are nonexistent so you should compare prices directly in our Price Guide. A Note About Tax Another benefit of purchasing from a value-added reseller is that some only collect sales tax on orders shipped to a handful of states. Keep the following in mind when comparing prices: B&H Photo only collects sales tax on orders shipped to NY. Adorama only collects sales tax on orders shipped to NY & NJ. Amazon collects sales tax on orders shipped to AL, AZ, CA, CO, CT, DC, FL, GA, IL, IN, KS, KY, MD, MA, MI, MN, NV, NJ, NY, NC, ND, OH, PA, SC, TN, TX, VA, WA, WV and WI.

      "text": "Apple flirts with, but doesn't commit to touchscreen \nApple products on the cheap are hard to come by, even on mega shopping holidays like Black Friday. But this year, you can score some major deals on lots of different Apple goodies, including the iPhone 7, iPad Pro, Apple Watch, and the new MacBook Pro. (Yes, seriously.) If you’re ok with slightly older stuff, the savings are even better. \nIf you’re planning on hitting the mall during the wee hours of Friday morning, be sure to double check store hours, and remember—these deals will only last as long as supplies do. Some stores may have started these discounts sooner, so if you need an afternoon break on Turkey Day, you could get a head start online. (Again, double-check with your local stores to see how long these promotions will last.) \nReady to roll? Read on for some of the best Black Friday deals we’ve seen, both in stores and online. iPhone 7 Adam Patrick Murray \nSome of Apple’s older iPhones can be had at a discount, but for the iPhone 7, you’ll be settling for in-store gift cards—not a bad consolation prize, especially if you have other stuff on your shopping list. \nBest Buy : Get a $100 Best Buy gift card if you buy any iPhone 7 with a monthly installment plan or a lease agreement for Sprint. \nTarget : Get a $250 Target gift card if you buy an iPhone 7 with a monthly installment plan or lease agreement from AT&T, Sprint, or Verizon \nWalmart : Get a $250 Walmart gift card if you buy any iPhone with a monthly installment plan or a lease agreement from AT&T or Verizon. iPads Logitech \nBest Buy : Save $125 on all iPad mini 4 models, starting at $224.99 for the 16GB Wi-Fi only model. Also, the iPad Air 2 and 9.7-inch iPad Pro are $125 off (in store only). \nTarget : Target has several iPad models on sale: 9.7-inch iPad Pro starts at $449 in stores (usually $599) iPad Air 2 starts at $274 in stores and online (down from $399) iPad mini 3 starts at $249 in stores and online (regularly $399) iPad Air 2 Wi-Fi + Cellular starts at $249.99 in stores and online (regularly $530) iPad mini 2 starts at $200, in stores only \nWalmart : The iPad mini 2 is on sale for $199 (down from $269, in stores only). Don’t count Apple’s tiniest iPad mini out just yet! MacBooks Adam Patrick Murray \nSurprisingly, there are some MacBook steals out there this year. Jump on these before they disappear. \nB&H Photo : You can get the older MacBook Pro with Retina display at $100 to $400 off, depending on the configuration. Plus, all 12-inch MacBook (the USB-C model) and MacBook Air configurations are $100 off. \nBest Buy : Save up to $200 on select MacBook models—including the newest entry-level 13-inch MacBook Pro (without the Touch Bar) for $1,399 instead of $1,499. Other options include the older 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Pros with Retina display for $200 off, and discounted MacBook Airs in select stores. Apple Watch Apple \nBest Buy : Original Apple Watch models have been deeply discounted—the stainless steel models start at $250, with most discounted $350 to $400 from their original prices, and you can get aluminum Apple Watch Sport models starting at $189. But the newer Series 1 (with S2 chip) and Series 2 (S2 chip, GPS, and waterproof) models are the same prices as at the Apple store, $269 and up. You can also snag some third-party Apple Watch bands on clearance. \nKohl’s : While the Apple Watch itself isn’t on sale, Kohl’s is offering $15 in Kohl’s Cash for every $50 you spend, so you can buy a full-priced Apple Watch Series 2 on Black Friday and get $105 in rewards back. \nTarget : You can get an Apple Watch Series 1 starting at $200—a step up from the original Watch, and $69 cheaper than Apple’s list price. iPods \nDon’t laugh—iPods make great stocking stuffers. And Target has them on sale: Take 20 percent off all iPod models. Apple TV \nAnother excellent gift option, especially with the upcoming TV app coming out in December. Take 25 percent off any Apple TV purchased at Target . Beats Headphones \nBest Buy : The newest Beats Solo3 Wireless with Apple’s W1 chip are $50 off, making them $249.99, and all previous models are discounted $60 to $160, including the Solo 2 wireless, Powerbeats2, and Beats Studio. Hey… what about the Apple store? \nAh, yes. Apple’s retail stores and online shops are participating in Black Friday this year, but they’re keeping us in the dark until Friday. Apple announced a one-day shopping event on its website, urging us to check back in when the sale starts. So, all we know is that there will be some kind of sale—we just don’t know much else. We’ll update this story on Friday morning once the details are out. To comment on this article and other Macworld content, visit our Facebook page or our Twitter feed. Related:",

Famous Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo of KGI Securities has informed that the iPhone 8 customers will get the technology to charge the device’s battery by using a wireless charging system like the one present for Apple Watches currently. But it is unlikely that the wireless charger will come within the bundle, rather available separately and charged extra by Apple. Samsung, the biggest rival, has been using wireless chargers for a long time now, but Apple for some reason has been avoiding the incorporation of that technology in its devices. \nBut according to the reports and rumours, the Cupertino giant is expected to bring out a dramatically redesigned iPhone next year. Ming-Chi Kuo is well known for revealing Apple’s future plans. He revealed the next device which might mark the company’s biggest change in years. Kuo told MacRumours, “We look for new 2017 iPhones to come in three models: one OLED model, and two TFT-LCD models with a 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch display. We believe the OLED and 5.5-inch TFT-LCD iPhones will feature [a] dual-camera. Based on this prediction, our forecast of dual camera adoption rate in new 2017F iPhone models is revised up from 30-40% to 65-75%. We view this increase as favouring Largan’s sales and profit momentum as it is the exclusive supplier of a wide-angle and telephoto lens. It also bodes well for Apple’s dual camera software ecosystem.” \nAlso read | Apple leak reveals the next iPhone with LCD, OLED and dual-camera models \nAccording to Kuo, Android devices have plastic and metal backs and feature wireless charging. But if the iPhone 8 has a glass body it will help achieve faster speeds in wireless charging with ‘minimum disruption from frequency interference’. The most interesting feature is that the company will finally be adding the OLED display. iPhones as of now use IPS LCD display panels. OLED is a very next generation tech because it works without a backlight which is able to save battery and also make the device thinner and lighter, apart from getting larger contrast ratio. Meanwhile, many smartphone manufacturers have already been using the OLED for many years now. Please Wait while comments are loading... Trending Now",

According to Kuo, the purported iPhone 7s, if tagged at a mid-range segment, may account for between 30 and 35 percent of new-model iPhone shipments in fiscal year 2017.

      "text": "  2017 soll es endlich so weit sein: Apple springt wahrscheinlich auf den Wireless Charging-Zug auf. Zumindest wenn es nach KGI-Analyst Ming-Chi Kuo geht, der das kürzlich in einem Research-Bericht behauptet hat. Bereits für das iPhone 7 waren im Vorfeld Gerüchte zu vernehmen, dass Apple das kabellose Laden, welches bei manchen Android-Smartphones schon seit Jahren verfügbar ist, auch auf iPhones implementieren will. Doch für das im September 2017 erwartete iPhone 8 sind die Chancen darauf offenbar höher. Aufgrund des geplanten Glas-Design sollen sich die nächsten iPhone-Modelle deutlich besser für das kabellose Laden eignen als die iPhone 6, 6s und 7-Modelle der vergangenen Jahre mit Metallrückseite. Laut Ming Chi-Kuo sollen alle drei für 2017 geplanten iPhone-Modelle Wireless Charging unterstützen, das Ladepad soll allerdings nur bei den teuersten Varianten auch mitgeliefert werden. Bei den günstigeren Versionen glaubt der Analyst eher an ein kostenpflichtiges Zubehör. Dem Vernehmen nach arbeiten sowohl Foxconn als auch Pegatron an den Wireless Charging-Modulen, Ming-Chi Kuo vermutet aber, dass die Module von Pegatron kommen werden. Völlig unklar ist derzeit, welchen Wireless Charging-Standard Apple mit dem iPhone 8 unterstützen wird. Ursprüngliche Berichte über die Adoption einer neuartigen Technologie von Energous namens Wattup, die das Laden über Distanzen hinweg unterstützt, scheinen aus jetziger Sicht unwahrscheinlich, da Wattup 2017 wohl doch noch nicht serienreif sein wird. Es wird also höchstwahrscheinlich auf ein traditionelles induktives Verfahren hinauslaufen. Tests",

      "text": "Retailers always go big on tech and electronics for Black Friday , but Apple itself did not jump into the fray last year.\n\nIn 2016, the company has changed its tune and will hold a \"one day shopping event\" on Black Friday. The exact deals have not yet been revealed, but will be available here, so check back. \n\n*Read more*: These are the best Black Friday drone deals\n\nMeanwhile, we've rounded up the best deals on iPhones, iPads, Apple Watched and Macbooks from elsewhere.\n\n*Apple iPhone*\n\n*EE* has £149.99 off the iPhone 6s on a pay monthly contract over 12 months (priced at £33.49 per month).\n\n*eBay* is offering up several options, from the iPhone 5c at £135.46 to the iPhone 6 from as little as £199 and iPhone 6s from £314.99.\n\n*Argos* has a refurbished iPhone 5s from £159.95\n\n*Carphone Warehouse* is offering iPhone 6s deals where the upfront cost of the phone on a £28 per month contract has been slashed from £259.99 to £59.99.\n\nIts sister site *Mobiles.co.uk* is also offering a great deal on the newer iPhone 7, with the upfront cost on a contract reduced to £75 from £200 and a monthly cost of £30.99. Just use the code BLACKNOV125.\n\n*John Lewis* is also price matching, don't forget (which goes for other Apple products too).\n\n*Apple Watch*\n\nIs Apple going to discount its smartwatch? It's hint at Black Friday deals this year is illustrated with a picture of the watch, so this might be your chance. Particularly with the recent launch of its second generation version in September, it could be just the time for a bargain on the original version.\n\n*Argos* has up to £80 off nearly all the original Apple Watches, bringing the starting price down to £249 for the basic models.\n\n*Apple iPad *\n\n*EE *has £200 off the Air 2 for existing customers (priced at £32.40 per month)\n\n*Tesco* has £60 off refurbished 32GB iPad Air 4 in black or white now £239.\n\n*Argos* has the 128 GB iPad Air 2 with a £40 saving, now £469.\n\n*Apple Macs*\n\nThere are few deals on Macbooks or iMacs, but Currys PCWorld is offering a saving of £50 on Microsoft Office when purchased with any laptop, including Apple's.\n\nIt's worth keeping an eye on Apple's own deals, revealed on Friday, for any Mac related ones.\n\n*Debenhams* has several Black Friday offers on a range of Macbooks and iMacs",

      "text": "Reddit \nHappy Thanksgiving! For readers with Apple Watch, remember to run or walk 5K today to earn a unique Activity achievement medal and an iMessage sticker. This is the first special Activity Challenge event and is only available for a limited time. \nTo earn the reward, you must start and complete a running or walking workout using the Apple Watch Workout app by the end of November 24th, Thanksgiving Day. The achievement is technically only available to Apple Watch users in the United States but there is a way to make the award appear if you live elsewhere … \nThe achievement was first announced on Monday with a surprise notification for Apple Watch owners. Although the workout is only supposed to be available to users in the United States, the primary country where Thanksgiving is celebrated, you can trick the Apple Watch by changing your region settings if you live abroad. \nTo do this, open the companion iPhone Watch app. Navigate to General -> Language & Region -> Region Format. Change the Region Format to United States and the Thanksgiving Activity Challenge will appear. You can see the details of what you have to do by opening the Activity app and selecting the Activity tab. \nApple has been promoting the Thanksgiving Apple Watch challenge on social media with the help of fitness celebrities who have been tweeting about the event. This Thanksgiving Day, I plan to earn this special achievement by completing a 5K with my #AppleWatch Join me! pic.twitter.com/Ae5SeHOksT \n— Jeanette Jenkins (@JeanetteJenkins) November 24, 2016 \nHopefully, Apple will do more of these special fitness challenges in the future, especially so international Apple Watch owners can join in officially. \nIf you’ve already done your 5K run or walk and got the achievement, let us know in the comments below.

      "text": "By Jennifer Booton, MarketWatch\nAnalysts say shrinking gap between iPhone and rivals, along with growing market for used smartphones, mean 'risks ... have never been greater'\nApple Inc. is the world's most valuable company and has a massive cash stash, but some analysts fear a prolonged period of weak innovation has set the company up for a \"decade-long malaise.\"\niPhone sales are expected to peak with the release of Apple's (AAPL) 10th anniversary iPhone next year, according to models from Oppenheimer analyst Andrew Uerkwitz, who predicts 245 million iPhones will sell in Apple's 2018 fiscal year. That would reflect an increase of 9% from the fiscal 2017 FactSet consensus estimate of 225 million, and an increase of more than 15% from the fiscal year that ended in October.\nHowever, Uerkwitz believes next year's iPhone cycle will present \"one last growth hurrah\" before consumers begin to drift away from the high prices Apple commands for it smartphones. Apple may struggle to raise iPhone prices meaningfully beyond the next cycle as it deals with fewer hardware breakthroughs and a narrowing performance gap between the iPhone and its closest premium-tier competitors, Uerkwitz wrote.\n\"The risks to the company have never been greater,\" said Uerkwitz, who has a perform rating on the stock. \"We believe Apple is about to embark on a decade-long malaise.\"\nAlso Read: Share buybacks will return with a vengeance next year (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/share-buybacks-will-return-with-a-vengeance-next-year-2016-11-21)\nAnother analyst, Monness Crespi Hardt's James Cakmak, echoed similar bearish sentiment Monday, warning about changing consumer behavior that have lengthened upgrade cycles, and competitive threats from the likes of Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL) (GOOGL) and Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) in the phone, video-streaming and augmented-reality realms.\n\"Apple won't have it easy again for a while, if ever,\" Cakmak said.\n(https://sw.graphiq.com/w/7rfyaGqHfyB)\nOne issue is an increase in demand for used and refurbished phones. Cakmak warns that Apple's refurbished-phone program may cannibalize new-device sales, which would further depress average selling prices. Trends tracker IDC said Monday it expects the global used smartphone market to nearly triple from 2015 through 2020 (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/used-smartphone-market-to-triple-in-five-years-2016-11-21), which could impact original equipment manufacturers and mobile operators like Apple and Samsung Electronics (005930.SE) .\nLast month, Apple reported its first ever annual decline in iPhone sales (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/apple-profit-revenue-slide-on-slower-iphone-sales-2016-10-25). Its shares have risen 2.3% in the past three months, virtually in-line with the Dow Jones Industrial Average , but have underperformed in the past year, falling more than 6% versus a 6% gain for the blue-chip index.\nDespite the bearish calls, the average rating on Apple stock is the equivalent to buy, while the average target of $130 implies 16% growth from Monday's closing price.\nBullish analysts have more confidence that Apple can maintain a stranglehold on the market for high-price smartphones. Canaccord Genuity's Michael Walkley, who reiterated a buy rating and $140 price target Monday, said he expects Apple to \"extend its leading market share of the premium tier smartphone market,\" despite competition from Google's Pixel phone and other Android phones. Samsung's disastrous Note 7 recall (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/apple-could-sell-another-15-million-iphones-because-of-samsungs-note-7-explosions-2016-10-10)has also helped this quarter, he said.\nOthers have been bullish on Apple's reported efforts on smart cars and augmented reality. Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook has been optimistic about AR and has secured a number of acquisitions over the past two years to help accelerate those plans. While Cakmak said Apple is trailing both Google and Amazon, Upload VR's entrepreneur in residence, Robert Scoble, citing sources, recently reported that Apple is working on a set of mixed-reality glasses (https://www.facebook.com/RobertScoble/posts/10154677292964655) that could be ready in 10 months.\nAlso See: Apple and augmented reality--where we're going, we won't need iPhones (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/apple-and-augmented-reality-where-were-going-we-wont-need-iphones-2016-08-19)\nStill, other uncertainties loom, such as the new White House administration (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/apple-and-trump-can-a-tax-cut-for-overseas-cash-heal-wounds-2016-11-09). While president-elect Donald Trump's proposed repatriation tax \"holiday\" would make it easier for Apple to return cash to the U.S. and put that money to work, other Trump policies that might make Apple build more iPhone components in the U.S. could offset tax-related financial benefits.\nLast week, Japan's Nikkei Asian Review reported that Apple reached out to supplier Foxconn Technology Co. Ltd. (2354.TW) about studying the possibility of moving some production to the U.S., (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/apple-supplier-foxconn-reportedly-considering-moving-iphone-production-to-america-2016-11-17) which Cakmak said might have negative implications.\n-Jennifer Booton; 24-16 0456ET\n ",

      "text": "By Jennifer Booton, MarketWatch\nAnalysts say shrinking gap between iPhone and rivals, along with growing market for used smartphones, mean 'risks ... have never been greater'\nApple Inc. is the world's most valuable company and has a massive cash stash, but some analysts fear a prolonged period of weak innovation has set the company up for a \"decade-long malaise.\"\niPhone sales are expected to peak with the release of Apple's (AAPL) 10th anniversary iPhone next year, according to models from Oppenheimer analyst Andrew Uerkwitz, who predicts 245 million iPhones will sell in Apple's 2018 fiscal year. That would reflect an increase of 9% from the fiscal 2017 FactSet consensus estimate of 225 million, and an increase of more than 15% from the fiscal year that ended in October.\nHowever, Uerkwitz believes next year's iPhone cycle will present \"one last growth hurrah\" before consumers begin to drift away from the high prices Apple commands for it smartphones. Apple may struggle to raise iPhone prices meaningfully beyond the next cycle as it deals with fewer hardware breakthroughs and a narrowing performance gap between the iPhone and its closest premium-tier competitors, Uerkwitz wrote.\n\"The risks to the company have never been greater,\" said Uerkwitz, who has a perform rating on the stock. \"We believe Apple is about to embark on a decade-long malaise.\"\nAlso Read: Share buybacks will return with a vengeance next year (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/share-buybacks-will-return-with-a-vengeance-next-year-2016-11-21)\nAnother analyst, Monness Crespi Hardt's James Cakmak, echoed similar bearish sentiment Monday, warning about changing consumer behavior that have lengthened upgrade cycles, and competitive threats from the likes of Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL) (GOOGL) and Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) in the phone, video-streaming and augmented-reality realms.\n\"Apple won't have it easy again for a while, if ever,\" Cakmak said.\n(https://sw.graphiq.com/w/7rfyaGqHfyB)\nOne issue is an increase in demand for used and refurbished phones. Cakmak warns that Apple's refurbished-phone program may cannibalize new-device sales, which would further depress average selling prices. Trends tracker IDC said Monday it expects the global used smartphone market to nearly triple from 2015 through 2020 (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/used-smartphone-market-to-triple-in-five-years-2016-11-21), which could impact original equipment manufacturers and mobile operators like Apple and Samsung Electronics (005930.SE) .\nLast month, Apple reported its first ever annual decline in iPhone sales (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/apple-profit-revenue-slide-on-slower-iphone-sales-2016-10-25). Its shares have risen 2.3% in the past three months, virtually in-line with the Dow Jones Industrial Average , but have underperformed in the past year, falling more than 6% versus a 6% gain for the blue-chip index.\nDespite the bearish calls, the average rating on Apple stock is the equivalent to buy, while the average target of $130 implies 16% growth from Monday's closing price.\nBullish analysts have more confidence that Apple can maintain a stranglehold on the market for high-price smartphones. Canaccord Genuity's Michael Walkley, who reiterated a buy rating and $140 price target Monday, said he expects Apple to \"extend its leading market share of the premium tier smartphone market,\" despite competition from Google's Pixel phone and other Android phones. Samsung's disastrous Note 7 recall (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/apple-could-sell-another-15-million-iphones-because-of-samsungs-note-7-explosions-2016-10-10)has also helped this quarter, he said.\nOthers have been bullish on Apple's reported efforts on smart cars and augmented reality. Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook has been optimistic about AR and has secured a number of acquisitions over the past two years to help accelerate those plans. While Cakmak said Apple is trailing both Google and Amazon, Upload VR's entrepreneur in residence, Robert Scoble, citing sources, recently reported that Apple is working on a set of mixed-reality glasses (https://www.facebook.com/RobertScoble/posts/10154677292964655) that could be ready in 10 months.\nAlso See: Apple and augmented reality--where we're going, we won't need iPhones (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/apple-and-augmented-reality-where-were-going-we-wont-need-iphones-2016-08-19)\nStill, other uncertainties loom, such as the new White House administration (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/apple-and-trump-can-a-tax-cut-for-overseas-cash-heal-wounds-2016-11-09). While president-elect Donald Trump's proposed repatriation tax \"holiday\" would make it easier for Apple to return cash to the U.S. and put that money to work, other Trump policies that might make Apple build more iPhone components in the U.S. could offset tax-related financial benefits.\nLast week, Japan's Nikkei Asian Review reported that Apple reached out to supplier Foxconn Technology Co. Ltd. (2354.TW) about studying the possibility of moving some production to the U.S., (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/apple-supplier-foxconn-reportedly-considering-moving-iphone-production-to-america-2016-11-17) which Cakmak said might have negative implications.\n-Jennifer Booton; 24-16 0715ET\n ",

(2354.TW) about studying the possibility of moving some production to the U.S., (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/apple-supplier-foxconn-reportedly-considering-moving-iphone-production-to-america-2016-11-17) which Cakmak said might have negative implications.\n-Jennifer Booton; 24-16 0501ET\n ",

      "text": "When Apple unveiled the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus this past September, there were almost no surprises left. The phones' \"boring\" new design had leaked months ahead of the event, as it always does, and nearly all of the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus's new features had already been revealed by insiders. We knew about the new cameras, we new about the new components, and of course we knew that the 3.5mm headphone jack would no longer be included on the new iPhones. The biggest surprise ended up being a second new color option for Apple's 2016 iPhones. The matte black color that replaced Space Gray had already leaked, and there were murmurs of a possible new deep blue color coming to the iPhone 7. Instead, Apple revealed a stunning new Jet Black color with a glossy, mirror-like finish. The new color is so popular that it's still next to impossible to walk into a store and buy a Jet Black iPhone 7 Plus. And since it's so popular, it goes without saying that Samsung was going to do everything in its power to copy it as quickly as possible. DON'T MISS: 7 of the thinnest iPhone 7 cases in the world It's actually beyond impressive how quickly Samsung was able to rip Apple off this time around. Could it be that the company had a head start since it's so deeply embedded in the supply chain? Who knows, but Apple's iPhone 7 was unveiled just two months ago and Samsung is already on the verge of launching its own version of Apple's Jet Black finish. According to a series of leaked photos posted to Weibo that were picked up by Samsung fan blog SamMobile, Samsung has a new version of its Galaxy S7 edge smartphone that will come in an extra glossy black color. Samsung's flagship smartphone for the second half of the year was discontinued due to a little problem with spontaneous explosions, so the company is left trying to spice up its older smartphones in an effort to salvage anything it can this holiday season. We've already seen a new Blue Coral color option for the S7 edge, and now it looks like Jet Black (or whatever Samsung ends up calling it in an effort to pretend it wasn't inspired by Apple) is next in line. A few of the leaked images follow below.",

      "text": "Apple iPhone 7 Plus vs iPhone 7: is Apple's larger handset worth it? Apple iPhone 7 Plus vs iPhone 7: is Apple's larger handset worth it? Posted: Tags : T-Mobile - T-Mobile + AT&T - AT&T + Verizon - Verizon + Sprint - Sprint + iOS - iOS + Apple - Apple + In the not so distant past, Apple sweared by the small-phone mantra and it said that large phones were not 'common sense'.When other experimented with gigantic screen sizes, and the non-explosive Galaxy Notes were proving popular with Android users, Apple still stood by its famous ‘Thumb’ ad. The ad claimed that your thumb goes only a certain distance, which was not larger than the 4” screen on the iPhone 5 and iPhone 5s .It was all 'common sense' right before... Apple did the complete opposite of what it preached a couple of years prior: it introduced two new and larger phones, a 4.7\" and a 5.5\" one.These days, it is the 4\" iPhone that feels against 'common sense'. It has its fans, but those are a very small percentage of the population. In fact, the 4.7\" iPhone 7 now feels pretty close to what the right size for a modern smartphone is. However, there are still people wanting a bigger screen. For those users, there's the 5.5\" iPhone 7 Plus , which, however, feels a bit on the bulky side – and there is no one device in-between the two. That sure makes choice between the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus hard. More so given that the larger iPhone has a few extra features including a brand new camera. We've been struggling with this choice in the past couple of months, and after living with both phones for a while, here are our guidelines to choosing the right iPhone for you. Screen, size and comfort iPhone 7 Plus size pros: faster to type on, better for media. Cons: heavy and uncomfortable if you carry it in your pocket Some people have larger hands and some have smaller hands, and some people prefer larger displays over small displays.What we’re trying to say with this truism is that if you prefer to use a smaller phone, the iPhone 7 Plus will be too big for you. However, even if you prefer larger phones, the 7 Plus might still be too big for you.Many people have no big issue adjusting to a larger-sized phone, but keep in mind that the 7 Plus is still bigger than most other flagship 5.5” phones: it has huge bezels by modern standards, its non-curved back makes it less ergonomic than similar phones with a curved back, and while the phone is not too thick, with a case on top of it, it starts feeling like a tank. 6.23 x 3.07 x 0.29 inches 158.2 x 77.9 x 7.3 mm 6.63 oz (188 g) 6.09 x 2.98 x 0.34 inches 154.72 x 75.74 x 8.6 mm 5.93 oz (168 g) 6.01 x 2.94 x 0.29 inches 152.7 x 74.7 x 7.35 mm 5.57 oz (158 g) 5.94 x 2.86 x 0.3 inches 150.9 x 72.6 x 7.7 mm 5.54 oz (157 g) Samsung Galaxy S7 edge To see the phones in real size or compare them with other models, visit our Visual Phone Size Comparison page. You should also think about your lifestyle: if you walk a lot and are used to keeping your phone in your jeans' pockets rather than a jacket or a bag, the iPhone 7 Plus definitely adds one more pain. It's way too big and too heavy, and it just does not feel very comfortable to hold such a large phone in your pocket, while the smaller iPhone 7 is comfortable to carry and is pleasingly light-weight.Of course, the larger screen brings a number of advantages: it's much faster to type on the larger display, you can use the 7 Plus in landscape mode and be more productive, and yes, if you have to edit spreadsheets on a phone, you'd prefer doing it on the 7 Plus. There is one other feature on the 7 Plus that might make even those who swear by smaller phones consider the bigger iPhone this year: The Telephoto lens It's legit: portrait mode is awesome For years, the iPhone has shipped with one main iSight camera: with its 28mm focal distance, it is considered a very universal shooter: it is not too wide to photograph people, yet it’s not too narrow so you can also capture good-looking landscapes. \nUse the Telephoto lens with Portrait mode for stunning results For the first time this year, the 7 Plus adds a secondary rear cam: it calls it a Telephoto camera because of its longer, 56mm focal distance. This lens is not something that you can practically use in lower light, so it’s use is definitely more limited, but when the light conditions are right, it captures excellent images. The true imaging revolution that it brings, however, is realized fully when you use this lens with the new ‘Portrait’ camera mode. It blurs the background to make the object you photograph ‘pop’ by standing out against the pleasantly blurred background.The effect is unlike anything you have seen on a phone so far, and it’s indeed something very similar to the bokeh effect you get on a DSLR. Apple calls this ‘Portrait’ mode because the algorithm detects faces and is able to very accurately define their borders to blur only the background behind them, but leave people in perfectly sharp focus. However, it’s more than that: it works with other objects that are a bit further than macro distance yet not too far away. We’ve been testing it for a couple of weeks now and find it to work great most of the time: it does great job capturing memorable pictures of your close ones, of your pets, of natural beauty like flowers, and it just excels at making the thing you take a picture of stand out and get noticed. It’s a profound change. A small thing to note is that portrait mode shots come in files that are nearly half the size of the regular iPhone pictures.Is it as good as what you get on a dedicated camera, though? No. These days, you can get a $500 DSLR like the Nikon D3300 with an 18-55mm lens that delivers dynamic range, color rendition, low-light performance, and versatility - as well as support for powerful external flashes for night and indoor photography - that the iPhone simply cannot match. You can even go cheap and get an old DSLR that is still as good as the D3300 for $250, and you’d still get image quality far above anything the iPhone is capable of. Of course, it’s nowhere near as portable or always-there as the iPhone.Back to the topic of discussion, though: Portrait mode with the new Telephoto lens combined are a serious enough reason to get the 7 Plus over the iPhone 7. However, as much as we like it, it does not change the fact that the 7 Plus will still feel uncomfortably big for some in the everyday grind. We ultimately could not make peace with the large size and went back to the 7, but miss Portrait mode a hell lot. iPhone 7 Plus Portrait Mode with Telephoto Lens Popular galleries",

      "text": "Turns out old Apple computers make great plant pots. (Picture: Monsieur Plant) Got an old laptop hanging around?\nThis photographer said goodbye to her elderly dog by documenting his final year Don’t bother selling it or throwing it into a skip. You can turn that faulty monitor into a glorious holder for plants, and be the coolest gardener on all of Instagram. Important.\nWe’re not just talking about throwing some soil at a screen, to be clear.\nIt turns out that old Apple computers can be transformed into stunning plant pots – with a little time, effort, and artistic skill.\nArtist Christophe Guinet, also known as Monsieur Plant , is the creator of Plant Your Mac, a project which (as you’ve probably guessed by now) turns old Macs into plant-packed delights.\n(Picture: Monsieur Plant) He couldn’t give us a step-by-step, as each model he’s created has been adapted to the requirements of the individual plants, but we reckon the process each Mac-pot was pretty time intensive.\nBut the concept of plants emerging from screens isn’t just pretty. It also has a deeper meaning.\n(Picture: Monsieur Plant) ‘Plant Your Mac is a project I had in mind for a while,’ Christophe told metro.co.uk.\n‘I worked in a creative agency with a team that was posted all day in front of their Mac.\n‘I realised that we tend to forget the reality in front of our machines.\n(Picture: Monsieur Plant) ‘Planting your Mac is a way for me to convey the message by recalling that nature exists… let’s not forget it through technology.’\n(Picture: Monsieur Plant) Christophe reckons that the current gardening craze (just look at all the cacti on Instagram) is a reaction to our realisation that the way we live is destroying our natural environment.\n‘We realised that our industralization destroys the planet,’ says Christophe. ‘There is a return to nature, hence a special attraction to plants and gardening.’\n(Picture: Monsieur Plant) Plant Your Mac, therefore, is a play on these conflicting ideas, turning our love of technology into our need to return to nature. Deep.\nIt does, however, also look very pretty, and we’d quite like to rummage around our office so we can shove succulents in some old screens.\n(Picture: Monsieur Plant) (Picture: Monsieur Plant) (Picture: Monsieur Plant) (Picture: Monsieur Plant) (Picture: Monsieur Plant) (Picture: Monsieur Plant) (Picture: Monsieur Plant) (Picture: Monsieur Plant) (Picture: Monsieur Plant) (Picture: Monsieur Plant) (Picture: Monsieur Plant) (Picture: Monsieur Plant) (Picture: Monsieur Plant) (Picture: Monsieur Plant) (Picture: Monsieur Plant) (Picture: Monsieur Plant) (Picture: Monsieur Plant) MORE: 19 cactus-themed things for those who love plants more than people \nMORE: 15 of the most beautiful gardens around the world you want to be in right now \nMORE: 11 beautiful inner-city balcony gardens that prove nature can thrive anywhere ",

      "text": "Apple has confirmed a major flaw in its iPhone 6 Plus units. Tagged as the \"Touch Disease,\" this hardware malfunction causes flickering display or flickering bars and multi-touch issues as some users complain of iPhone 6 Plus being unresponsive to touch inputs.\nAdvertisement In response to this issue, Apple has launched a repair program for the affected iPhone 6 Plus.\n\"Apple has determined that some iPhone 6 Plus devices may exhibit display flickering or multi-touch issues after being dropped multiple times on a hard surface and then incurring further stress on the device,\" stated Apple in a press release.\n\"If your iPhone 6 Plus is exhibiting the symptoms noted above, is in working order, and the screen is not cracked or broken, Apple will repair your device for a service price of $149,\" Apple added. Pricing offered by Apple authorized service providers may vary.\nSince Apple does not acknowledge any flaw in the design of the iPhone 6 Plus, this issue would not be covered under warranty. For users who have already paid for a service on their 6 Plus, Apple will contact them through Apple or an Apple authorized service provider for reimbursement if they were charged more than $149.\niFixit, a popular DIY repair website believes that the error arises when the chips handling the touch input lift away from the iPhone's main circuit board. A contributing factor is when the chips are located at a point where the iPhone 6 Plus can experience more flexing in comparison to the rest of the handset.\nUsers who experience multi-touch issues may bring their iPhone 6 Plus to a participating Apple service provider. The unit will be examined prior to any service to verify its eligibility for this program and working order.\nAdvertisement This repair program is applicable only to iPhone 6 Plus and not to other iPhone units.\n PlayStation 4 News and Update: Releases Ultimate Holiday Gift Guide Apple Reveals And Confirms A Big iPhone Error Speed Racer, The Movie Hailed As The Best Game Of The Year Samsung J3 For 2017 To Be Revealed!

A new report from the most reliable Apple insider in the world says that what may turn out to be a game-changing Apple innovation is responsible for the major redesign of next year’s iPhone 8.\nDON’T MISS: HTC just unveiled one of the best Android phones of 2016, but you can’t have one\nThe 2017 iPhone is expected to feature wireless charging, but possibly not the “boring” type of wireless charging that’s currently seen in various top Android devices. If reports are accurate about the company’s increased interest in Energous , Apple is looking to bring in a brand new type of wireless charging to the market.\nCurrent wireless chargers consist of a base that’s plugged into a power source. The phone needs to be touching that base in order to charge, which makes usage rather limited. The rumored technology Apple is working on would charge the iPhone from across the room. That means you’d be able to use the phone, or even keep it in your pocket, and the battery would still charge wirelessly.\nRespected Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo issued a new note to clients that says the iPhone 8 will come with a glass body in order to support wireless charging. Kuo doesn’t say anything about Energous, but regardless of what wireless charging tech Apple goes for, it’ll still need to dump metal in favor of glass for iPhone 8 cases.\n“We believe one of the reasons why new iPhones will switch from metal casing to glass casing is to support wireless charging,” Kuo said in the note obtained by MacRumors . “In order to ensure a superior performance, we believe it is most appropriate for EMS suppliers to develop and make the wireless charger because then a comprehensive test can be conducted. As Hon Hai needs to deploy most resources to develop and produce OLED iPhone, we expect Pegatron will be the exclusive supplier of the wireless charger.”\nKuo said in previous research notes that Apple would sell three distinct iPhone models this year, including a 5.8-inch iPhone 8 with an OLED display, and two “regular” versions with 4.7- and 5.5-inch LCD screens.\nTrending right now:\nT-Mobile has some of the best Black Friday deals we’ve seen Best Black Friday deals on Apple gear: iPhone 7, MacBooks, iPads, Beats and more This could be Apple’s most interesting design yet for a future iPhone See the original version of this article on BGR.com",

      "text": "World's leading smartphone manufacturer and dominant, Apple has captured a record share of profits in the global smartphone industry in the third quarter, according to new research, despite grappling with falling iPhone sales.\nAdvertisement Third-quarter smartphone operating profit reached $9 billion globally of which Apple took 91 percent of the share, Strategy Analytics said in a note on Tuesday. This amounts to $8.19 billion for the U.S. technology giant.\nApple has the highest profit margins in the smartphone industry thanks to a loyal brand following and the ability to price its iPhones at a premium. And the figures come even after Apple reported three straight quarters of iPhone sales declines .\nIn its official fiscal fourth-quarter results, which coincides with Strategy Analytics' third-quarter survey, Apple reported an operating income of $11.76 billion overall - not just for its iPhone unit. The U.S. hardware giant does not break out profitability for iPhones separately. Apple's gross margin was 38 percent.\nPart of the reason Apple has also captured record share is because other players in the smartphone market have declined.\nStrategy Analytics' estimate appears conservative compared to other studies. Earlier this month, BMO Capital Markets said Apple accounted for around 103.6 percent of profits in the smartphone market. The more than 100 percent figure reflects the fact that other vendors such as HTC and LG lost money.\nSat a long way behind Apple is China's Huawei which managed to grab 2.4 percent of global operating profit share in the smartphone market, accounting for $200 million, according to Strategy Analytics. Huawei's third-quarter smartphone shipments rose 63 percent year-on-year, official figures from the company showed in October. The Chinese technology giant does not break out profitability figures, but it is now the world's third-largest smartphone maker behind Samsung and Apple.\nIt has been focusing on selling high-end devices to challenge its larger rivals and boost margins with the company aggressively expanding its marketing efforts.\nChinese start-up brands Vivo and OPPO are in third and fourth place, both capturing 2.2 percent of global smartphone profit each. Both firms have managed to grow rapidly through a strategy of selling low-cost but high-spec phones.\nAdvertisement\n Apple Dominates 91% Out Of World Smartphone Sale Profit Obama White House Reps Key In New And Final Regulatory Agenda Obama Revelations: President-Elect Trump Is Committed To NATO US Forces May Have Committed War Crimes Says ICC Prosecutors Tobacco Fall In 2016 Sees A Legislative & Regulatory Roundup As Solution Advertisement",

      "text": "We’re hearing rumors about a new iPad these days. It’s believed that Apple is going to release one early next year that has a display above 10 inches. A new rumor out of Taiwan suggests that the company is going to release the 2017 iPad with a 10.5 inch display and that it’s going to be an “education and enterprise” tablet. Apple is said to start mass production of this new tablet next month. It’s also claimed that the 2017 iPad is going to feature Apple’s A10X processor. No further details about the specifications have been leaked so far but as is the case with every refreshed tablet, we can expect faster memory, software improvements, and perhaps some design tweaks as well.\nApple is apparently going to launch the 2017 iPad with a 10.5 inch display because tablets with 10 inch or larger displays are proving to be popular among businesses and in the education sector in the United States.\nThe company’s existing lineup of tablets includes a 9.7 inch model and the 12.9 inch iPad Pro. This will then be a new dimension for the company’s tablet lineup and so far the rumor mill is in agreement that it’s going to be out at some point early next year .\nSince Apple doesn’t really drop hints about its future products it can’t be said with certainty right now if this is indeed going to happen. Rumors about future Apple products are a dime a dozen and it’s best to take them with a grain of salt until there’s more solid information to go on.\nFiled in",

The phone which is expected to be launched in 2017 is expected to feature wireless charging, which is so far not implemented in any iPhones that we have witnessed. Indian Express has recently reported that the trusted Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, from KGI Securities has states that iPhone 8 users will be able to the phone via wireless charging system pretty much they people are doing one Apple Watches as of now. However, as far as we have seen the company, users may have to end up purchasing the wireless charger separately! [representative image] According to the same report, Kuo seems to believe that iPhone 8's expected glass body may help in achieving faster speeds in wireless charging. However, Apple has so far not implemented the technology even though it's biggest competitor Samsung seems to have already become a pro in it. Along with this, Kuo's earlier reports hint at a possible bezel-less OLED iPhone 8, while we may expect a 4.7 inch and 5.5 inch display screens. [image via intabloid]",

Following previous releases in April and also last year , the two are back at it once more and this time with an “Equateur Tatoutage” design.\nThe band comes in lush black calfskin and was designed by naturalist artist Robert Dallet. Dallet came up with the big cat jungle pattern after being inspired by South American fauna, which is currently threatened due to continued deforestation.\nThe latest strap goes on sale at a hefty $442 and is available in limited numbers at Hermès boutiques from today.\nIn additional watch news, Casio G-SHOCK and Darker Than Wax claim to have come up with an “unbreakable” timepiece.\n",

      "text": "The world’s largest information technology company by revenue couldn’t so comfortably dominate the smartphone profitability ranks if it took big gambles through the wide-scale adoption of experimental features every year.\nBut that doesn’t mean we can’t dream of an “unapologetically” revolutionary iPhone 8 next year with a borderless OLED screen , all-glass design , wireless charging support , and even 3D camera functionality.\nHopefully, the latter part will be a little less gimmicky than what condemned Amazon’s Fire Phone to public ridicule and rapid oblivion. If it pans out to begin with, considering we’re still light on specifics, and the Korean media’s rumor looks impossible to substantiate for the time being.\nAll we “know” is Apple has purportedly “united forces” with LG Innotek, the exclusive supplier of iPhone 7 Plus dual camera systems, to “enable 3D photographing” on “new products starting from the latter half of next year.”\nAt least one, but likely two of the three iPhone 8 versions coming in 2017 should again adopt rear-facing dual cam setups, presumably with enhanced “bokeh” effects in tow, facilitated by a new Portrait mode and mystery depth-of-field upgrades, aka 3D features.\nFirst, it’ll be interesting to see if perhaps next spring’s LG G6 brings back 3D photography goodies after the Optimus 3D family’s missteps a while ago.\nThe post Apple reportedly teams up with LG Innotek for ‘3D camera’ on iPhone 8 appeared first on Pocketnow .\n",

      "text": "Apple products on the cheap are hard to come by, even on mega shopping holidays like Black Friday . But this year, you can score some major deals on lots of different Apple goodies, including the iPhone 7, iPad Pro, Apple Watch, and the new MacBook Pro. (Yes, seriously.) If you’re ok with slightly older stuff, the savings are even better.\n\nIf you’re planning on hitting the mall during the wee hours of Friday morning, be sure to double check store hours, and remember—these deals will only last as long as supplies do. Some stores may have started these discounts sooner, so if you need an afternoon break on Turkey Day , you could get a head start online. (Again, double-check with your local stores to see how long these promotions will last.)\n\nTo read this article in full or to leave a comment, please click here",

      "text": "Mingis on Tech: The iPhone 7, Apple Watch 2 -- and the gadget guy! \nI’ve been enjoying the new BBC Worldwide iOS app, The Story of Life, since it first appeared earlier this month . It’s the biggest ever mobile release of amazing material drawn from Sir David Attenborough’s enormous archive of natural history films. It’s fantastic, fascinating and free. 1,000 stories \nAvailable worldwide on both iOS and Android platforms, this app has become my favorite way to while away time in the evenings. It provides you with access to over 1,000 incredible moments from the natural world. \nThe clips are breathtaking and the animals amazing. I particularly like one clip in which we see a female Orangutan sawing wood – she may be furry, but she seems ever so human. Many may have seen the dramatic clip featuring an iguana running desperately away from snakes as the clip was heavily shared on social media in the last week or so (take a look at below if you missed it). Images supplied by BBC Worldwide How it works \nThe app offers full screen video. When you open it up you’ll watch a brief introduction from the renowned naturalist, and can then explore the clips. You can either dive directly into the whole collection, or explore featured collections, for example: “The ‘Big five’ beasts of Africa”, “Beautiful birds of paradise”, “Unique species first filmed”, and so on – you get the idea. \nAs you explore the clips you can tap the display (or use the Apple Remote) to move to and fro between them, and you can also access tools including a Like tool (heart) and another that lets you create your own collections of clips. You can search by habitat, species and behavior. Easy to use \nThe app is clear, the clips are sometimes astonishing, navigation is simple, but what I find most exciting about this app (other than it being free) is that you can share the clips you find. Sharing takes the form of links that take you to the BBC website where you can explore these collections. Options include social media, Messages, email and more and I think the ability to share these astonishing clips so easily from within this engaging app is highly compelling. The natural world is truly miraculous and this wonderful collection fills me with thankfulness at the splendor of life on Earth. Images supplied by BBC Worldwide Why the app? \nAvailable now worldwide, why has BBC Worldwide released the app? It turns out that this is a gift to everybody from Attenborough to mark his ninetieth birthday this month (November). Attenborough explains: \n“This is natural history for the digital age, allowing people to explore the story of life on earth and share their favourite natural history moments with the world.” \nThe app includes clips taken from across his greatest works, Life on Earth , The Story of Mammals , The Story of Life . The collection also includes some easter eggs, exclusive films you won’t find anywhere else. More clips will be added to the app in future. Buying advice \nI’ve felt compelled to write this short review of this amazing app because since I began using it I’ve found it very hard to put down. \nI think it's an important release. After all, Apple often talks about its place being at the intersection between technology and the liberal arts, and I think that this world-class release helps illustrate this notion at its best. \nWhy? \nBecause it’s a perfect expression that combines the timeless wonders of the natural world with the astonishing innovation of humanity. \nEach clip has huge value, it is, after all, a vast collection of some of the best moments ever captured on film from the world around us, including moments that had never been captured on film before. And this life’s work is being made available across the planet for free. I simply can’t recommend it highly enough. Now I intend looking at some stunning caves hidden beneath Antarctica, why not join me ? \nPS: Once again, happy Thanksgiving to my US readers. \nGoogle+? If you use social media and happen to be a Google+ user, why not join AppleHolic's Kool Aid Corner community and join the conversation as we pursue the spirit of the New Model Apple? \nGot a story?

      "text": "apple patent foldable phone iphone plus bestof More It looks like Apple’s dream of one day creating a foldable phone isn’t dead just yet. The company has been granted a new patent for an iPhone that would be able to fold in half, and even grip onto your clothes — meaning you might not even need to put it in your pocket.\nThe patent itself was applied for in July 2014, and it envisions the use of a flexible OLED display that could itself fold in half, making the device look somewhat like the clamshell-type phones of yesteryear.\nMore: Samsung may follow Apple’s lead and release a glossy black Galaxy S7\nThe patent goes into detail about how the device would work, butkeep in mind that just because Apple has been granted a patent, that doesn’t mean it will ever release the tech to the market. According to the patent, the device could be folded so that the two screen halves touch each other, or so that there’s half of the screen on either side of the outside of the device. More hinges could be implemented, too — so that it could fold into thirds or quarters instead of in half.\nView photos\n161122090325-apple-patent-folding-screen-780x439 More The patent isn’t just interesting because it shows a foldable phone — it’s also interesting because of the fact that the display is an OLED one. So far, the iPhone has stuck with an LCD display, although some expect that Apple will make the switch to OLED over the next few years.\nHowever unlikely it is that we’ll see a flexible iPhone in the near future, it’s quite possible we’ll see a flexible device from another company. Samsung, for example, has been working on a flexible phone for some time now, and most recent rumors indicate that it will finally be released in 2017. LG is also rumored to be working on a flexible phone.\nFoldable cardboard bike helmet is as effective as a polystyrene one Samsung Galaxy X: Rumors and news leaks The iPhone 7’s display is the \"best LCD display ever,\" according to report",
