      "text": "Let’s say that a bank such as Goldman Sachs publishes a recommendation to “Buy Stock X”.\nIt’s hard to ignore a bet by a powerful investment bank such as Goldman. We are mere mortals in the pecking order, and they are supposed to be the all-knowing smart money from Wall Street.\nDo we buy the stock, or is it simply wiser to pass?\nBank Performance Overall The folks at InterTrader have done considerable legwork to dive deep into the data on investment bank recommendations made in 2015. They looked at every bet made by the 16 top banks throughout the year to assess both potential returns and accuracy.\nThe results are pretty underwhelming.\nIf you bought every stock recommended and held until the end of the year, here’s what your performance would look like:\n\nOverall, when holding the stock picks for the year, banks were only 43% accurate with their predictions.\nThat’s right – flipping a coin would have been potentially more effective than buying bank stock picks, which ended up down -4.79% on the year. The S&P 500 finished down only -0.69%, but simply just making any interest in a savings account would have been more effective as well.\nA Closer Look at Individual Banks While banks as a whole struggled with picks in 2015, it’s also important to look at banks on a more micro level to see how they performed.\nHere’s a look at the recommendations by Deutsche Bank , and how they did:\n\nDeutsche Bank nailed 41% of their predictions, and had a -8.93% return if picks were held throughout the year.\nAs you can see, some of their picks such as Microsoft and Wix.com gained double digits. On the other hand, recommendations such as Whiting Petroleum got absolutely crushed throughout the year, dropping -70.1%.\nOverall, Deutsche Bank’s performance here definitely didn’t do much to help the struggling company get out of its rut.\nWhich Banks Were Most Accurate? Here are the banks, from best to worst, based on accuracy of their calls:\n\nNomura, Credit Suisse, BAML, and Barclays all batted above .500 if stocks were held throughout the year, while 10 banks all did worse than a coin flip.\nCitigroup had an off year, only nailing 14% of its picks.\nWhich Banks Had the Best Returns? Here are the banks, from best to worst, based on the performance of these recommendations:\n\nJust two banks, Credit Suisse and Nomura, had positive returns if stocks were held through the year. Meanwhile, Canaccord Genuity’s picks were knocked down -16% over the course of 2015.\nAn Important Caveat Throughout the above article, we are showing the results if stock picks were held from when they were made until the end of the year.\nHowever, it is worth noting that the investment banks actually did slightly better if picks were held for shorter durations of time:\nTime Accuracy Gains % 30 Days 55% 0.80% 90 Days 49% -1.48% 180 Days 42% -3.66% End of Year 43% -4.79% In other words – if you sold all stock recommendations exactly 30 days after buying, you would have actually made a 0.8% return throughout the year. This is still a lower return than a savings account, but it is an improvement on losing -4.79%!\nFor a more in-depth dive into the data, we highly recommend checking out InterTrader’s interactive version of the results. or below\nGurudex by InterTrader Article by Jeff Desjardins, Visual Capitalist \nThe post Sell-Side Analyst Accuracy: Credit Suisse And Nomura Top List appeared first on ValueWalk .\n",

      "text": "Shares 1 Getty Images \nAlex Blankfein’s dad, Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein, is one of the most powerful people on Wall Street. Carlyle Group is among the largest private equity firms in the world. It would stand to reason that people would notice the former working for the latter. \nBut apparently no one really picked up on it when Blankfein’s eldest got a job at the prestigious investment company more than a year ago. As eFinancialCareers reports: \nAlex Blankfein’s arrival at Carlyle isn’t recent – according to his publicly available profile he joined from Bain in April last year. However, it appears to have gone unnoticed by the world’s media. Carlyle updated its page relating to Alex Blankfein last week . He’s working on Carlyle’s U.S. Equity Opportunities team, is ‘focused on a broad range of middle-market buyout transactions,’ and is based in New York City. \nPrivate equity jobs are notoriously difficult to get and Carlyle is one of the most selective hirers of the lot. Alex Blankfein’s move may have been indirectly facilitated by his father’s closeness to David Rubenstein, Carlyle’s founder. Rubenstein interviewed Lloyd Blankfein last month for his Bloomberg-hosted chat show. \nSounds like a sweet gig for the 30-year-old former Goldman banker , but he seems to have the whole career track mixed up. Traditionally you join Carlyle (headquartered a few blocks from the White House) after doing time in government . And, as Trump’s incoming administration has once again shown, it’s customary to go to DC after Goldman. \nAlex seems to have his own ideas, though. Among them: Keeping a super-low profile.",

      "text": "by Sarah Butcher 27 minutes ago \nCould it be that we’re entering a new golden era for Goldman Sachs? A time when the warm glow of favourable markets will be suffused with the twin aromas of http: en/267047/banks-hiring-us/ It's a whole new dawn \nCould it be that we’re entering a new golden era for Goldman Sachs? A time when the warm glow of favourable markets will be suffused with the twin aromas of restricted regulation and friends in high places? Deutsche Bank and KBW seem to think so. \nBoth banks have upgraded Goldman’s stock to buy, citing a sudden improvement in Goldman’s outlook. A stronger U.S. economy under a President Trump should benefit Goldman’s advisory and capital markets businesses and its fixed income and equity trading businesses, said Deutsche Bank analyst Matt O’Connor in a note this week . In a separate note, KBW’s analysts said Goldman is particularly well placed to benefit from improved conditions in fixed income trading. \nThere’s also the unexpected rehabilitation of the Goldman-to-government move. 17-year Goldman employee Steve Mnuchin is Trump’s Treasury Secretary. Eight-year (or so) Goldman employee Steve Bannon is Trump’s chief strategist. Current Goldman Sachs president and number two Gary Cohn, is said to be in line to become a director of the Office and Management of the Budget in the Trump administration. This might be because Cohn is on friendly terms with Trump’s son in law, Jared Kushner, but Goldman seems a the stronger bond – Cohn and Mnuchin were both made partners in the same year , 1994. \nWill Goldman’s newly empowered alumni be in a position to make life easier for their former employer? Quite possibly. Mnuchin used his first press briefing t o declare his intention to strip back Dodd Franck and “look at” the “confusing” Volcker Rule. As a firm which historically ran a large proprietary trading operation, this will be music to Goldman ears. \nAs ever, though, it’s possible to have too much of a good thing. While Goldman’s success looks assured in the short term, too close an association with the Trump administration could bring future reputational risks if things go wrong. \nSeparately, the detrimental effects of testosterone on trading floors have been well-documented, but this hasn’t prevented those floors being filled with men, or some ageing financiers self-administering testosterone shots. Now, however, new research suggests another disadvantage to the male hormone: it makes you unfriendly. Models built by researchers at the University of Massachusetts , suggest testosterone-heavy individuals not only feel less close to others, but desire less closeness in the first place. Don’t expect hugs in a volatile market. Meanwhile : \nGary Cohn’s probably a bit bored of playing second fiddle to Lloyd Blankfein. ( Vanity Fair) \nGoldman’s analysts think a Trump presidency will be good for every single sector of the equity markets. But they also caution that fear is likely to pervade the second half of 2017. (Bloomberg) \nJust because illiquid bond markets haven’t caused problems yet, don’t assume they won’t in future. Recent trading was mostly in big names, there were no forced sales and there were enough people with differing opinions on Trump to create a healthy market. (Gadfly) \nTraders didn’t get much sleep last night, what with the Italian referendum. (Bloomberg) \nPrivate equity fund Terra Firma made 11 hires. One of them was the former chief executive of the Guardian Media Group. (Financial News) \nHedge fund Bridgewater preaches “radical transparency,” except when it comes to disclosing what happened with a claim brought by an employee alleging he was sexually harassed by his boss. (NY Times) \nAngela Merkel is making the reclamation of Deutsche Bank bonuses past into an election issue. (Bloomberg) \nA Marie Claire photographer shot Sergio Ermotti and made him into a style icon. (FUW) \nWhy you must sit the CFA exam even when you’re pretty sure you’re going to fail. (300 Hours)",

He's so committed to finding Clinton's Goldman Sachs speeches he put their guy in his cabinet! \n— Danny Zuker (@DannyZuker) November 30, 2016 \nOn the campaign trail Donald Trump threw a lot of shade on Ted Cruz and Hillary Clinton for their associations with Goldman Sachs, much to the delight of his supporters. Now it seems like he’s had a change of heart. With former Goldman Sachs partner Steve Bannon already on Trump’s team, he chose Goldman Sachs veteran Steve Mnuchin to be his nominee for Treasury Secretary. Now Trump is considering Goldman Sachs COO Gary Cohn as a potential director for the Office of Management and Budget. Naturally, critics on Twitter couldn’t let something like this go without shoveling some snark. Here’s a selection of some of the more entertaining tweets. Why don't we just merge Goldman Sachs with the federal government and be done with it? \n— Ben Shapiro (@benshapiro) November 30, 2016 I'm old enough to remember when Ted Cruz's wife working for Goldman Sachs meant that Cruz was a corrupt Wall Street insider. \n— Ben Shapiro (@benshapiro) November 30, 2016 Trump supporters literally chanted \"Goldman Sachs\" at @tedcruz to taunt his wife. Now 3 top Goldman employees will be in Trump's cabinet. \n— Isaac Saul (@Ike_Saul) November 30, 2016 In light of Trump tapping 2 ex-Goldman Sachs employees – as chief advisor and as Treasury Secretary – this is fun: https://t.co/OGVr4GSgCK \n— Brad Thor (@BradThor) November 30, 2016 Trending Dan Spencer \nThe tweet Thor is referring to: Was there another loan that Ted Cruz FORGOT to file. Goldman Sachs owns him, he will do anything they demand. Not much of a reformer! \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 16, 2016 \nOuch. So if you take a loan from Goldman Sachs, you're evil & they \"own\" you. But if you work at Goldman for years, you're qualified for Trump WH! \n— Brad Thor (@BradThor) November 30, 2016 So Trump blasted HRC for taking money from Wall Street and he appoints two Goldman Sachs guys to Treasury? He is the swamp \n— Andy Cohen (@Andy) November 30, 2016 Trump naming a Goldman Sachs bro as Treasury Sec is a huge blow to all the Hillary voters who desperately wanted a Morgan Stanley bro \n— Andrew Stiles (@AndrewStilesUSA) November 30, 2016 They said if America voted for Hillary, Goldman Sachs would run the government—and they were right! \n— Justin Miller (@justinjm1) November 30, 2016 Mr Trump, this is bullshit. Can you hire someone who doesn't work for Goldman Sachs? \nWhat about that swamp? Huh? https://t.co/t2QkXsrtBy \n— Joe Walsh (@WalshFreedom) November 30, 2016 \nOh, you thought he really meant all that stuff he said during the campaign? \n— Hell is Empty (@Sleestak) November 30, 2016  ",

      "text": "A sign is displayed in the reception of Goldman Sachs in Sydney, Australia, May 18, 2016. REUTERS/David Gray/File Photo ( Copyright Reuters 2016 ) Goldman Sachs Exec Eyed for White House Budget Post \nPublished November 30, 2016 \nPresident-elect Donald Trump is considering Goldman Sachs President and Chief Operating Officer Gary Cohn to head the White House budget office or to fill other positions, a Trump transition official said on Wednesday. \nContinue Reading Below \nCohn, 56, a former Goldman commodities trader who joined the firm in 1990, has been widely considered to be the heir apparent to Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein. \nDow Jones reported earlier on Wednesday that Cohn, who met with Trump on Tuesday, has had discussions about leaving the firm. \nIf Cohn is picked to become Trump's budget director and is subsequently confirmed by the U.S. Senate early next year, he would play a lead role in formulating spending priorities for domestic and international programs funded by Washington. \nThe budgets produced annually by the White House's Office of Management and Budget are both a reflection of every administration's legislative priorities and a blueprint for detailed spending and tax bills the president wants Congress to consider. \nCohn is a former Goldman commodities trader from Ohio who joined the firm in 1990. He served in a variety of leadership roles in bond trading, becoming co-head of Goldman's broader securities and eventually, co-president in 2006. \nContinue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT \nHe makes frequent appearances at industry conferences and on television, where he speaks about the state of the financial markets. \nCohn struggled with dyslexia as a child and bounced from school to school, according to a Malcolm Gladwell profile from his book \"David and Goliath.\" \nWith Blankfein showing no sign that he will step down soon, some inside the firm have wondered if Cohn has other aspirations outside the Wall Street bank. \nPacific Investment Management Co in 2013 had considered Cohn to replace Mohamed El-Erian. But discussions never progressed beyond an initial stage, according to reports at the time. \nCohn is just one of a cadre of other former Goldman Sachs executives who are slated to join the Trump administration, including incoming Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and White House adviser Steve Bannon. \nWith the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives both under Republican control, Trump's budget proposals are likely to get much more serious consideration than budgets submitted over the past few years by President Barack Obama, a Democrat who was regularly at odds with Republican lawmakers.

      "text": "Subscribe to the Times There is a Washington tradition of presidents calling on a Goldman Sachs luminary to take the reins of the economy, including the Democrat Robert E. Rubin in 1995 and Henry M. Paulson Jr., a Republican, in 2006. Mr. Mnuchin’s Goldman pedigree is as good as it gets, given that his father, Robert, was a pioneer in stock trading who spent 35 years at the firm. While the Goldman brand may have initially attracted Mr. Trump, for the broader financial community it is Mr. Mnuchin’s track record at hedge and private equity funds, which is where the real money is made on Wall Street these days, that makes him appealing. “Mnuchin as Treasury secretary is somebody who can speak to bankers — Jamie Dimon, Lloyd Blankfein, James Gorman and Brian Moynihan. He can speak their language,” said Gary Kaminsky, a former vice chairman at Morgan Stanley, referring to the chief executives of JPMorgan Chase, Goldman, Morgan Stanley and Bank of America. “He comes from a trading desk, and that’s something that is very strong,” Mr. Kaminsky, who has attended fund-raisers for Mr. Trump, added. While there is little doubt that Mr. Mnuchin can speak the language of Wall Street, he has had little experience running large, complex bureaucracies. Mr. Rubin and Mr. Paulson had ascended to the top at Goldman, and had many years of experience managing people and organizations under their belt. \nAdvertisement   Mr. Mnuchin did assume a leading role in the restructuring and reinventing of IndyMac, now known as OneWest, a California mortgage giant that collapsed in 2008. He and partners acquired the firm and later made billions. After he moved from New York to the West Coast, Mr. Mnuchin was targeted by protesters who claimed that the bank was too quick to foreclose on struggling homeowners. Last year the bank was sold to the CIT Group, a small-business lender run at the time by another Goldman Sachs alumnus, John A. Thain. In a statement announcing his economic appointments, Mr. Trump highlighted the deal. “He purchased IndyMac Bank for $1.6 billion and ran it very professionally, selling it for $3.4 billion plus a return of capital,” he said of Mr. Mnuchin. “That’s the kind of people I want in my administration representing our country.” Mr. Mnuchin has faced other controversies. In 2010, he and his brother, Alan, were sued over their mother’s early investment with Bernard L. Madoff, an investor who was convicted of running a Ponzi scheme . The lawsuit, filed by a trustee for Madoff victims, alleged that $3.2 million of the money Mr. Mnuchin withdrew from his mother’s account shortly after she died belonged to other victims. The lawsuit was dropped last year because of a time limit. Hollywood has been another reinvention for Mr. Mnuchin. In 2006, he and a partner, Chip Seelig, struck a deal through their company Dune Entertainment to invest $325 million in 28 movies produced by 20th Century Fox. It was a successful partnership; Fox delivered hits (made in part with Dune’s money) like “Avatar,” which took in $2.8 billion worldwide in 2009. After breaking with Mr. Seelig in 2012, Mr. Mnuchin teamed up with a company called RatPac, owned by the rowdy filmmaker Brett Ratner and the Australian billionaire James Packer. Mr. Ratner was then notorious in Hollywood; he resigned as a producer of the Academy Awards in 2011 after using an anti-gay slur at a public event and making frank remarks about his sex life on Howard Stern’s radio show. (He apologized .) But together the three men formed a vehicle to invest $450 million in an extensive array of Warner Bros. movies. Some have been major hits, like “Gravity,” which took in $723.2 million. But there have also been money losers, including “Pan” and “In the Heart of the Sea.” Still, Mr. Mnuchin has clearly enjoyed a Hollywood lifestyle, whether attending celebrity-filled parties at the Hôtel du Cap-Eden-Roc during the Cannes Film Festival or going in with a movie industry friend to buy a Dassault Falcon 50 jet (since sold). He can currently be seen in a cameo — playing a Merrill Lynch executive — in Warren Beatty’s new movie “Rules Don’t Apply.” \nAdvertisement   Beyond the entertainment industry, there other similarities between Mr. Trump and Mr. Mnuchin. They are both twice divorced, and their third partners are decidedly younger. (Mr. Mnuchin’s fiancée is Louise Linton, a 34-year-old actress from Scotland.) They also both have a taste for landmark Manhattan real estate: Trump Tower for the president-elect and 740 Park Avenue for Mr. Mnuchin. But there are differences, too. Despite his Hollywood appetites, Mr. Mnuchin is described by people who know him as slightly awkward and not one to command a room. Friends of the two men describe them more as social and professional acquaintances than close friends. The names of flashier prospects had been floated as possible candidates for Treasury, according to a fund manager close to the president-elect’s economic brain trust. Among them: Henry Kravis of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Company, Jonathan Gray of Blackstone, Jamie Dimon, Mitt Romney, and Thomas J. Barrack Jr. of Colony Capital, a Los Angeles-based real estate investor who has been close to Mr. Trump for decades. \nBrooks Barnes and Neil Irwin contributed reporting.",

      "title": "Donald Trump: Goldman Sachs Investors Love New Treasury Pick Mnuchin",
      "text": "Donald Trump hasn’t always appeared to be the biggest fan of Goldman Sachs . But recently, Goldman Sachs investors have been really big fans of Trump.\nShares of the investment banking giant soared 4% in trading Wednesday, closing at levels the stock hasn’t seen since December 2007 as the president-elect’s Treasury pick, Steven Mnuchin, said he would do away with a major headache for Wall Street.\n“So we want to strip back parts of Dodd-Frank that prevent banks from lending, and that will be the number one priority on the regulatory side,” Mnuchin told CNBC Wednesday . “The number one problem with the Volcker rule is its too complicated, people don’t know how to interpret it, so we will look at what to do with it, as we are with all of Dodd-Frank.”\nThat, of course, should be good for all the banks. Yet, Goldman’s stock soared more than most of the big banks. J.P. Morgan Chase’s shares, for instance, were up less than 2% on Wednesday. The only big bank that did better than Goldman on Wednesday was Bank of America bac . It’s stock was up 4.5%. The index tracking bank stocks from Keefe Bruyette and Woods rose 2%. In comparison, the wider S&P 500 closed down 0.27%.\nSo why do investors think Mnuchin will be particularly good for Goldman? Here’s one possibility: He used to work there. Before starting his own hedge fund, Mnuchin was a partner at Goldman Sachs.\nMnuchin’s comments are also roughly in line with promises Trump has made on the campaign trial to pull back on Dodd-Frank, though Trump also said he was for reinstating Glass Steagall—the law the separated banks from Wall Street businesses. Mnuchin has not said he is for that. And that would be bad for Goldman Sachs, which in the past year or so has pushed deeper into lending.\nEven before Mnuchin was officially named Trump’s Treasury pick, bank stocks had soared on the businessman’s election thanks to those promises. Trump’s presidency, in part because his policies are expected to be inflationary, is also expected to be paired with further interest rate hikes from the Federal Reserve, helping banks pull in more revenue.\nTrump also isn’t done pulling Goldman Sachs alumni into his inner circle. According to Politico, Trump is considering the bank’s current number two executive, president and Chief Operating Officer Gary Cohn for the position of director of the Office of Management and Budget.\nShares of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac also surged over 40% each, as Mnuchin suggested that the two government-sponsored entities could be privatized.",

(James Devaney/WireImage) SPECIAL TO THE NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Wednesday, November 30, 2016, 10:33 PM \nIt’s early yet, but Donald Trump is taking one of the worst American traditions — a coziness with Wall Street in the highest corridors of power — to a dangerous new extreme. \nWhen President Calvin Coolidge proclaimed that “the chief business of the American people is business,” it was four years before the Great Crash of 1929. His treasury secretary, Andrew Mellon, was a billionaire who had made his fortune in the industrial and financial sectors. First appointed by President Warren Harding in 1921, Mellon served under more Presidents (three) than any other treasury secretary. \nIn keeping with Coolidge’s wishes (which were similar to Trump’s), Mellon slanted towards isolationism, slashed taxes and dismantled financial regulations. The result of this excess capital bound by fewer rules was a speculative stock, debt and real estate bubble, rampant economic inequality, and a crash that ignited the Great Depression. \nThe fallout led to the landslide victory of Franklin Delano Roosevelt in 1932. Since the crash had nearly decimated Goldman Sachs’ stock and reputation, Executive Chairman and CEO Sidney Weinberg (nicknamed “Mr. Wall Street”) hit upon a resurrection route, hitching his financial star to FDR’s rising political one. That strategy spurred a tight, nearly nine-decade relationship between Goldman Sachs and the White House. Weinberg became FDR’s most ardent campaigner. Goldman Sachs' history in presidential cabinets goes back 90 years in America. (LUCAS JACKSON/REUTERS) \nHe raised funds from Goldman clients, colleagues and his business circle of friends. He became the confidante, fund-raiser and sometimes appointee of many Presidents. \nBut it wasn’t until Bill Clinton decided to run for the Oval Office that Goldman elite upped their game. In gratitude for his victory, Clinton chose Goldman Sachs co-Chairman, Robert Rubin, to become his treasury secretary. Republican President George W. Bush repeated the maneuver when he appointed former Goldman Sachs Chairman and CEO Hank Paulson to be his in 2006. \nBefore moving to a plum post at Citigroup, Rubin ushered in the repeal of FDR’s 1933 Glass-Steagall Act, which had separated speculative and investment banking from commercial banking. Before Paulson left Washington, he helped architect the country’s biggest-ever bank bailout for the banks that grew from that repeal. Mnuchin is the first Goldman Sachs' man to make it to the cabinet after being on the receiving end of a federal bailout. (EDUARDO MUNOZ ALVAREZ/AFP/Getty Images) \nNow comes Donald Trump’s appointment of Steven Mnuchin, former Goldman Sachs partner (and son of another Goldman Sachs partner) as his first secretary of the treasury. \nWhereas Rubin and Paulson directed government policies and subsidies to help the largest Wall Street banks become bigger and stronger, Mnuchin was on the receiving end of federal aid. \nConvening a consortium of billionaires, Mnuchin bid on failed Pasadena-based bank, IndyMac in 2009. Trump wants to keep with the notions of former President Calvin Coolidge (l.), who led the country into the Great Depression. (HO/EPA) \nFor a purchase price of $1.3 billion in cash, according to the FDIC (a fraction of IndyMac's full asset value), he got the FDIC to back most of the risk (or possible future losses) on his acquisition and the cost of foreclosures on IndyMac customer properties. \nThe gang renamed IndyMac “OneWest,” and 36,000 foreclosures and a mélange of shady practices later, sold it for $3.4 billion in August 2015. The little people were not beneficiaries. \nIt should only surprise you that Trump turned to Goldman Sachs to populate a senior position in his cabinet (and Mnuchin may only be the first; Goldman Sachs President Gary Cohn is under consideration to head the Office of Management and Budget) if you A. considered his rhetorical economic populism to be binding or B. ignored history. President Bill Clinton picked Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, a former Goldman Sachs co-chairman that threw his support behind Clinton. (Hamburg, Harry/NEW YORK DAILY NEWS) \nShortly before I resigned from Goldman Sachs, where I had been for less than two years, I had a chat with Chip Seelig, who went on to become a co-founder of Dune Capital Management alongside Mnuchin. In shades of Coolidge, Seelig gave me some career advice. He told me that if I wanted to move ahead at Goldman, I had to realize that my real clients were my superiors within the firm. \nAfter I left Goldman Sachs, I became a senior fellow at a nonpartisan public policy think tank. When Mnuchin left, he established a hedge fund that crushed the lives of thousands of California mortgage holders. He is by far the wealthier of the two of us. I like to think I sleep better at night. \nTreasury secretaries are incredibly powerful. They can usher in stability or chaos. They can press for regulations that keep the risks of predatory, fraudulent or speculative actions from falling on the backs of hardworking Americans, or they can push to deregulate an industry that cratered the economy and was fined upwards of $160 billion for related crimes. Coolidge's path is a proven disaster. \nAs for the kinds of deregulation that spawn crises, Mnuchin has already made clear his intent to demolish the Dodd-Frank financial regulatory reforms passed in the wake of the 2008 crisis. He has no interest in the reinstatement of Glass-Steagall, despite its inclusion in the Republican platform this August. \nMeantime, Goldman Sachs has benefited from government subsidies, alliances and revolving doors. Mnuchin has personally reaped the rewards of federal largesse to private equity moguls over ordinary citizens. \nThis won’t end well for us. \nIf Trump really wanted to underscore anything negative he’s said about Wall Street, Goldman, hedge funds or banks during his campaign, he would not have chosen Mnuchin to run the Treasury Department. \nIn the game of bipartisan politics, Wall Street always plays both sides and always wins. Goldman, outperforming its sector since Trump’s victory, wins bigger. \nPrins is author of “All the Presidents’ Bankers: The Hidden Alliances that Drive American Power” and a former managing director at Goldman Sachs.

      "text": "Looking for a new forex broker? Compare Brokers Goldman Sachs on GBP - Structural Shorts Remain One Of The 'Most Actionable Themes' Thu 1 Dec 2016 04:12:35 GMT Author: share Sterling downside has fallen out of favor, but we think Sterling remains one of the most actionable themes. In mid-November, we revised lower our GBP/$ forecast to 1.20, 1.18 and 1.14 in 3, 6 and 12 months , and went short Sterling and the Euro against the Dollar as one of our Top Trades for 2017. \nThere is, of course, near-term uncertainty in the run-up to the Supreme Court ruling. That said, UK Prime Minister May has signaled that Brexit remains the path forward and that Article 50 will be triggered by March. We think this message is getting lost amid the legal debate. Our view remains that Sterling is not yet 'cheap': our research implies that tradeweighted Sterling could fall around 20-40 percent relative to its pre-Brexit level for the UK current account to close to a 1.5 percent of GDP target (Exhibit 4), and that Cable could fall a cumulative 25 percent in response to the large uncertainty shock to the UK economy The main reason why we expect Sterling to fall further is that the political uncertainty linked to the process of leaving the EU and renegotiating trade agreements is, and will likely remain, elevated for a long period. The process has not yet begun and, when Article 50 is triggered, uncertainty will increase further: what kind of deal the EU and UK agrees on will likely remain unclear for some time. The main economic consequences are twofold: an economic slowdown owing to elevated political uncertainty that reduces investment, employment and consumption, and an adjustment to the UK external balance requiring a substantial decline in the current account deficit, particularly in the event of a \"hard Brexit. ; About Us \nAll the biggest trading floors in the world have screens locked on ForexLive™.

(Photo: KENA BETANCUR/AFP/Getty Images) × Former Goldman Sachs banker Steven Mnuchin tapped by Trump for Treasury secretary US President-elect Donald Trump adviser Steven Mnuchin leaves from the Trump Tower in New York on November 14, 2016. (Photo: KENA BETANCUR/AFP/Getty Images) \nNEW YORK — President-elect Donald Trump has tapped Steven Mnuchin, a former Goldman Sachs banker who profited from the housing meltdown, as his Treasury secretary, according to an official briefed on the decision. \nMnuchin’s career has been full of contradictions. He started as a Wall Street insider working for old-line firms before running a series of eclectic businesses — including his own hedge fund and a West Coast consumer bank. In recent years, he has been a Hollywood movie producer. \nHe served as finance chairman of Trump’s presidential campaign and has been one of Trump’s closest economic advisers. His nomination will be announced as soon as Wednesday, the official said. \nAs Treasury secretary, the 53-year-old Mnuchin would be the face of the American economy around the world. The Treasury Department has expansive responsibility over business and oversees banking regulations, financial markets and the IRS. It has about 100,000 employees, an estimated 91,000 of them at the IRS. \nBesides co-signing the currency, the Treasury secretary is Uncle Sam’s banker, paying the bills, collecting taxes, managing the federal government debt and selling billions of dollars a year in Treasury bonds.

However, if GDP grows and Dodd-Frank strictures on lending are repealed, then we could have loan growth.\n\"All we've been trying to get is interest margin growth. Imagine loan growth on top of net interest margin growth and then suddenly these companies are trading at eight, nine times earnings,\" Cramer commented.",

(Photo: Richard Drew/AP file ) \nThe city of Reno is on the cusp of settling its years-long lawsuit against Goldman Sachs, which it accused of misleading the city into taking on risky debt that nearly led the city into insolvency. \nUnder the terms of the agreement, however, the city will get just a small fraction of the $13 million it sought as reimbursement for the penalties and sky-high interest rates it had to pay when the auction rate securities market collapsed in 2008. \nOn Dec. 7, the Reno City Council will vote on whether to approve the settlement, which includes a $750,000 payment from Goldman Sachs. Other than the payment, the details of the agreement remain confidential. \n\"We haven’t finalized anything yet,\" said Joe Peiffer, a New Orleans-based lawyer the city hired for the litigation. \"We are almost there. It’s confidential so there's not too much I can say other than, I think the parties settled to everybody’s satisfaction.\" \nPeiffer worked for the city on contingency, so a portion of the settlement funds will go to his law firm.The exact amount wasn't available on Wednesday. \nRobert Chisel, Reno's Finance Director, acknowledged the city wasn't able to recoup all of its losses through the settlement, but added its more than the city would get if it lost in court. \n\"If you look at some of these other cases that have been out there, they usually don't win these days,\" he said. \nAt issue is $210 million in bonds the city issued in 2005 and 2006 to refinance the debt for the downtown train trench and events center. According to the city's lawsuit, Goldman Sachs failed to disclose the severe risk in the volatile auction rate securities market, nor the fact that the bank was artificially propping up the market by bidding the interest rates down. \nReno's leaders — former City Manager Charles McNeely and former Mayor Bob Cashell — were wooed by the idea of low interest rates, even taking out another $20 million for \"downtown projects,\" much as a homeowner might buy a boat by borrowing against home equity. \nBut when the financial markets collapsed in 2008, and the banks stopped bidding on the auction rates, the rates skyrocketed. That landed Reno with a 15 percent interest rate on the debt, as well as millions in penalties owed to Goldman Sachs. \nA review of the city's financial documents shows payments to Goldman Sachs more than doubled to $7 million from $2.6 million between 2012 and 2013. \nIn 2008, Reno scrambled to refinance the debt. The majority of it is now held by Bank of New York. Reno still owes $47 million to Goldman Sachs. That bond, however, is in forbearance until 2018. \nThe bonds are paid for through a 1/8-cent sales tax, which currently isn't generating enough revenue for the city to make payments to both Bank of New York and Goldman Sachs. Because they are revenue bonds, however, the city's general fund is not on the hook for the payments. 6 CONNECT 1 COMMENT EMAIL MORE  //on.rgj.com/2gMh0GE TOP VIDEOS",

      "text": "Email \nOne of the first criticisms over Donald Trump’s nomination of former Goldman Sachs banker Steven Mnuchin (shown) on Wednesday for Treasury secretary came from the Democratic National Committee : “So much for draining the swamp … nominating Steven Mnuchin to be Treasury Secretary is a slap in the face to voters who hoped [Trump] would shake up Washington.” \nJust the name “Goldman Sachs” sends shivers down the backs of Americanists. Mnuchin would be the third Treasury secretary from Goldman Sachs since 1995, the other two being Henry Paulson under President George W. Bush and Robert Rubin under President Bill Clinton. But those shivers go far deeper: Goldman Sachs has provided so many alumni for top roles in government over the years that wags refer to the firm as “Government Sachs.” Those alumni include Mario Draghi, president of the European Central Bank, Mark Carney, the former governor of the Bank of Canada who is now the current governor of the Bank of England, and Malcolm Turnbull, the current prime minister of Australia. \nThose concerned remember that Goldman Sachs was bailed out by American taxpayers in the aftermath of the real estate mortgage meltdown in 2008 that triggered the Great Recession. They remember that Goldman Sachs was “the company from which Obama raised the most money in 2008,” as noted by the Washington Examiner . They remember that Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein visited the White House frequently to confer privately with the president on matters that remain secret to this day. \nMnuchin has all the trappings of an insider. A Yale graduate, he started work at Goldman upon graduation, helped along no doubt by his father, Robert, who was a full partner at the firm for three decades. After 17 years working in the trading department, Mnuchin had amassed a small fortune estimated at about $40 million. He left the firm just before his 40th birthday to join his Yale roommate who was running a hedge fund. That stint lasted a couple of years when Mnuchin took a much better opportunity: to work for the hedge fund run by billionaire and funder of dozens of liberal anti-American groups, George Soros, in his Soros Management Fund. \nThey became close and worked together to purchase the failed housing lender IndyMac in 2009. That deal smelled to high Heaven from the first, with most of IndyMac’s liabilities being covered by the American taxpayer, and making Mnuchin a very rich man when he sold his interest in it to CIT Group last year. \nHe became a Hollywood film producer following his time with Soros, financing films such as American Sniper , Avatar , and Suicide Squad . \nWhen he took on the task of helping raise money for Donald Trump’s campaign in May, it came with strings: If Trump won, Mnuchin would be first in line for Treasury secretary. He raised almost $170 million for Trump, Trump won, and Mnuchin is in. \nAssuming the Senate consents, Mnuchin will run perhaps the most powerful agency of the U.S. government. He will be the federal government’s banker: paying the bills, raising the money to cover the increasing deficits through bond sales to investors and governments across the globe. He will be in charge of the IRS, which takes up 91,000 of the department’s 100,000 employees. He will, in short, be Trump’s financier and enforcer. \nIn looking for anything that might reduce those shivers, there is some comfort in three points: He did in fact raise $170 million for Trump, far more than he gave either to Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama, or Charles Schumer. (He claimed that he made those personal gifts “mostly as favors to friends who were fundraisers” for them.) \nHe sounds good in promoting the Trump agenda: By cutting corporate taxes, we’ll create huge [his word] economic growth and we’ll [create] huge [his word again] personal income [growth]…. [Cutting those taxes] will be the largest tax change since Reagan…. Our most important priority is sustained economic growth, and I think we can absolutely get to [a] sustained three to four percent [growth in the] GDP, and that is absolutely critical for the country…. Taxes are way too complicated, and people spend way too much time worrying about ways to get them lower…. We believe in fair trade and we believe that’s going to be a big boost to the economy. \nFinally, there is some small comfort in knowing that Mnuchin was never a partner at Goldman Sachs as were the previous two Treasury secretaries. He was just a trader, making millions until he could afford to leave and go out on his own. And, he hasn’t worked for “Government Sachs” since 2002. \nOther than that, Mnuchin appears to be just one more Goldman Sachs alumnus who is part of the “revolving door” between the firm and the highest levels of the U.S. government, regardless of who is president or what party he represents.

      "text": "Trump expected to pick financier Mnuchin to head Treasury \nSteven Mnuchin , a former Goldman Sachs banker and Hollywood financier, confirmed in an interview Wednesday on CNBC's Squawk Box that Trump had asked him to serve in the administration. Billionaire industrialist Wilbur Ross also confirmed that he is the nominee for Commerce Secretary. In the joint interview, they professed confidence in the new administration's ability to boost economic growth as high as 4 percent a year. \nCrucial to that projection would be passage of Trump's proposed overhaul of the tax code, including streamlining individual tax rates into three brackets and reducing the corporate tax rate to 15 percent. Independent research groups have estimated the plan could cost as much as $6 trillion over the next decade. However, that analysis does not include the potential economic benefits the tax cuts could generate. \nMnuchin said Wednesday that he believed the tax cuts would generate more jobs, helping to offset the cost. Some of Trump's economic advisers said during the campaign that his plan would not add to the federal deficit. However, the Tax Foundation estimated that even with so-called \"dynamic scoring,\" Trump's tax package could cost about $3 trillion over a decade. \nIn addition, Mnuchin emphasized that a reduced tax rate for the highest earners would be offset by the elimination or curtailing of many deductions that favor the wealthy. He suggested that the cap on the popular deduction for mortgage interest could be lowered but did not provide details. The current cap is $1 million on first and second mortgages. \nMnuchin also pushed back against analysis by the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center that found the bulk of the benefits under Trump's plan would go to wealthy households, while some single-parent households would end up paying higher taxes. He highlighted plans for a child-care tax credit and rebates for lower-income families. \n\"There will be no absolute tax cut for the upper class,\" he said. \"There will be a big tax cut for the middle class.\" \nThe comments highlight two potential sources of tension for the Trump administration as it pushes its tax plan - one with congressional Republicans, the other with the federal budget deficit. They also fly in the face of every independent analysis of the Trump plan, including one Trump has frequently cited favorably. \nMnuchin reiterated Trump's commitment to cutting taxes for the middle class, a key difference between the president-elect's campaign plan and the tax blueprint put forth by GOP leaders on Capitol Hill. The congressional plan, like Trump's, would cut taxes for the wealthy and for corporations, but it would not do nearly as much as Trump would to cut taxes for lower- and middle-income Americans. Reconciling the two will be a major sticking point in any tax-reform negotiations next year. \nMnuchin also said two things about Trump's tax plan that independent analyses do not support. One is the idea that the wealthy will receive no net tax benefits from the plan.

      "text": "By Sandeep Kanihama \nResearch Team at Goldman Sachs, notes that while the latest OPEC headlines suggest that while there is a broad agreement on the rationale for a cut, political considerations and country level quota negotiations are so far preventing a deal from being reached. \nKey Quotes \n“As a result, it will likely take intense negotiations on Wednesday before a decision is made. Subject to the usual modeling caveats, our analysis suggests that as of Monday’sn close, Brent futures are reﬂecting a 30% probability of a deal being reached with Brent near-dated implied volatility pricing in a $6/bbl move on Wednesday, ﬁve times more than the daily implied moves for other trading days. If the proposed OPEC production cut to 32.5 mb/d is agreed to, we would expectn prices to rally to the low $50s/bbl, with observed implementation required to support prices further. Given historical observed compliance to announced production cuts, this would be the equivalent of realized 1H17 OPEC production of 33.0 mb/d and a Russia freeze, which would warrant $55/bbl oil prices in 1H17 and backwardation by 2Q17. If no deal is reached, our expectation of rising inventories through 1H17 wouldn warrant prices averaging $45/bbl through next summer. Of course, the absence of a deal would likely exacerbate the initial sell-off given the unwind of net speculative positioning and with a large WTI option open interest around the $40/bbl strike potentially exacerbating a move below that level. However, with the Brent market in our view only pricing in a 30% probability of a deal being reached and the option market pricing in a $6/bbl move, we believe that a move to below $40/bbl would be difﬁcult to sustain. This suggests that price risk is likely skewed to the upside.” RELATED TOPICS ",

A stronger economy should benefit many capital market businesses—incl advisory, equity capital markets, and both fixed and equity trading (all areas of strength at Goldman Sachs). This should also be a positive backdrop for investing and lending (even assuming no regulatory changes). Separately, we expect the recent rollout of consumer lending to build momentum (we est. $400m in post credit revenues in 2019). On our 2018e, Goldman Sachs trades at a 10% discount to peers (at 9.1x vs. 10x).\nShares of Goldman Sachs have gained 3% to $218.15 at 9:49 a.m. today, while the SPDR S&P Bank ETF ( KBE ) has risen 1.9% to $41.18, and Financial Select Sector SPDR ETF ( XLF ) has advanced 1.3% to $22.50.",

      "text": "print \n(Adds background and details on White House budget role, Goldman Sachs executive Cohn) \nNEW YORK, Nov 30 (Reuters) - President-elect Donald Trump is considering Goldman Sachs President and Chief Operating Officer Gary Cohn to head the White House budget office or to fill other positions, a Trump transition official said on Wednesday. \nCohn, 56, a former Goldman commodities trader who joined the firm in 1990, has been widely considered to be the heir apparent to Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein. \nDow Jones reported earlier on Wednesday that Cohn, who met with Trump on Tuesday, has had discussions about leaving the firm. \nIf Cohn is picked to become Trump's budget director and is subsequently confirmed by the U.S. Senate early next year, he would play a lead role in formulating spending priorities for domestic and international programs funded by Washington. \nThe budgets produced annually by the White House's Office of Management and Budget are both a reflection of every administration's legislative priorities and a blueprint for detailed spending and tax bills the president wants Congress to consider. \nCohn is a former Goldman commodities trader from Ohio who joined the firm in 1990. He served in a variety of leadership roles in bond trading, becoming co-head of Goldman's broader securities and eventually, co-president in 2006. \nHe makes frequent appearances at industry conferences and on television, where he speaks about the state of the financial markets. \nCohn struggled with dyslexia as a child and bounced from school to school, according to a Malcolm Gladwell profile from his book \"David and Goliath.\" \nWith Blankfein showing no sign that he will step down soon, some inside the firm have wondered if Cohn has other aspirations outside the Wall Street bank. \nPacific Investment Management Co in 2013 had considered Cohn to replace Mohamed El-Erian. But discussions never progressed beyond an initial stage, according to reports at the time. \nCohn is just one of a cadre of other former Goldman Sachs executives who are slated to join the Trump administration, including incoming Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and White House adviser Steve Bannon. \nWith the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives both under Republican control, Trump's budget proposals are likely to get much more serious consideration than budgets submitted over the past few years by President Barack Obama, a Democrat who was regularly at odds with Republican lawmakers.

      "text": "(Reuters) - Goldman Sachs said on Wednesday that OPEC's agreement to slash oil output would \"unleash a sharp production\" response in the United States and the rest of the world.\nOPEC agreed on Wednesday to its first oil output cuts since 2008 after Saudi Arabia accepted \"a big hit\" on its production and dropped its demand on arch-rival Iran to slash output.\n\"This is a short duration cut, targeting excess inventories and not high oil prices, which would instead unleash a sharp production response both in the U.S. and in the rest of the world,\" the U.S. investment bank said in a note.\nNon-OPEC Russia will also join output reductions for the first time in 15 years to help the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries prop up oil prices.\n\"The catalysts for a further rally in prices will need to come from confirmation of participation by non-OPEC producers, evidence of compliance by OPEC producers and more clarity on what Iran has agreed to do given conflicting numbers in the official agreement,\" Goldman said.\nThe bank forecast WTI crude prices touching $55 per barrel and Brent crude $56.50 in the first half of 2017, based on historical compliance to announced quotas and assuming a 33 million-barrels-per-day realized OPEC output in the first half of 2017 as well as a freeze in Russian production.\nOPEC produces a third of global oil, or around 33.6 million barrels a day. Under the Wednesday deal, it would reduce output by about 1.2 million bpd from January 2017.\nOil soared more than 10 percent on Wednesday to over $50 a barrel, its highest in a month.

      "text": "Continue reading the main story Photo Gary D. Cohn, chief operating officer of Goldman Sachs, at Trump Tower in New York on Tuesday. His talk with President-elect Donald J. Trump has lowered the once-high odds of his taking over Goldman’s top spot. Credit Sam Hodgson for The New York Times The list of candidates to take over the top job at Goldman Sachs has shrunk notably in recent weeks. In the last month, both of the firm’s vice chairmen have announced plans to retire from the Wall Street firm. Then, this week, the No. 2 executive at the company, Gary D. Cohn, met with President-elect Donald J. Trump to talk about the possibility of a job with the new administration. Mr. Cohn is said to be open to leaving Goldman if he is offered a position by Mr. Trump, according to two people briefed on his thinking. If Mr. Cohn were to go to work for Mr. Trump, he would be the third Goldman alumnus to join the top ranks of the new administration, along with Steven Mnuchin , a former Goldman partner who was tapped to become Treasury s ecretary , and Stephen K. Bannon , who worked at Goldman early in his career and is now Mr. Trump’s top political strategist . The concentration of former Goldman employees in the new administration is a rather unexpected outcome from an election in which the firm was a regular punching bag, held up as a prime example of Wall Street greed. The president-elect’s turn toward Goldman is also surprising because the bank, like other Wall Street firms, has not been eager to work with Mr. Trump as a client . For Goldman, Mr. Cohn’s meeting with Mr. Trump on Monday has lowered the once-high odds that the burly former trader would take over the top spot at Goldman from his longtime colleague Lloyd C. Blankfein , the chairman and chief executive. It has been no secret on Wall Street that Mr. Cohn has coveted the top position at Goldman and has grown impatient as Mr. Blankfein has remained in the job. \n  The possibility of his leaving for Washington could put pressure on Goldman’s board to hasten Mr. Blankfein’s retirement in order to elevate Mr. Cohn. But there are no signs that the board is taking any unusual steps at the moment to try to keep Mr. Cohn. For his part, Mr. Blankfein has shown no signs of wanting to leave the post he has occupied since 2006. Last year, he underwent chemotherapy for lymphoma , and the company was forced to consider what would happen if he could not continue as chief executive. But since the treatment, Mr. Blankfein has said he is cancer-free and hopes to stay in the job for some time. Mike Mayo, a bank analyst at CLSA, said that talk of Mr. Cohn leaving “is a sign that Mr. Blankfein is still calling the shots and is likely to do so far a while.” It would appear that Mr. Blankfein’s job is going to get easier with Mr. Trump in the White House. The president-elect has talked about weakening the Dodd-Frank financial reform legislation , which came down particularly hard on Goldman and its Wall Street-centric business model. Since the election, Goldman’s stock has risen 23 percent, much more than the broader market. In the year before the election, its stock fell about 10 percent. On Wednesday, after Mr. Cohn’s meeting with Mr. Trump became public, the bank’s shares rose 3.6 percent. Mr. Blankfein led Goldman through the financial crisis and has had to guide it through the raft of new regulations introduced since then, which have limited the firm’s ability to make big profits from trading.",

      "title": "Gary Cohn, a Potential Successor at Goldman, Could End Up With Trump",
      "text": " count=\"100\" data-total-count=\"100\">The list of candidates to take over the top job at Goldman Sachs has shrunk notably in recent weeks. In the last month, both of the firm’s vice chairmen have announced plans to retire from the Wall Street firm. Then, this week, the No. 2 executive at the company, Gary D. Cohn, met with President-elect Donald J. Trump to talk about the possibility of a job with the new administration. Mr. Cohn is said to be open to leaving Goldman if he is offered a position by Mr. Trump, according to two people briefed on his thinking.\nIf Mr. Cohn were to go to work for Mr. Trump, he would be the third Goldman alumnus to join the top ranks of the new administration, along with Steven Mnuchin , a former Goldman partner who was tapped to become Treasury s ecretary , and Stephen K. Bannon , who worked at Goldman early in his career and is now Mr. Trump’s top political strategist .\nThe concentration of former Goldman employees in the new administration is a rather unexpected outcome from an election in which the firm was a regular punching bag, held up as a prime example of Wall Street greed. The president-elect’s turn toward Goldman is also surprising because the bank, like other Wall Street firms, has not been eager to work with Mr. Trump as a client .\nFor Goldman, Mr. Cohn’s meeting with Mr. Trump on Monday has lowered the once-high odds that the burly former trader would take over the top spot at Goldman from his longtime colleague Lloyd C. Blankfein , the chairman and chief executive.\nIt has been no secret on Wall Street that Mr. Cohn has coveted the top position at Goldman and has grown impatient as Mr. Blankfein has remained in the job.\n The possibility of his leaving for Washington could put pressure on Goldman’s board to hasten Mr. Blankfein’s retirement in order to elevate Mr. Cohn. But there are no signs that the board is taking any unusual steps at the moment to try to keep Mr. Cohn.\nFor his part, Mr. Blankfein has shown no signs of wanting to leave the post he has occupied since 2006. Last year, he underwent chemotherapy for lymphoma , and the company was forced to consider what would happen if he could not continue as chief executive. But since the treatment, Mr. Blankfein has said he is cancer-free and hopes to stay in the job for some time.\nMike Mayo, a bank analyst at CLSA, said that talk of Mr. Cohn leaving “is a sign that Mr. Blankfein is still calling the shots and is likely to do so far a while.”\nIt would appear that Mr. Blankfein’s job is going to get easier with Mr. Trump in the White House. The president-elect has talked about weakening the Dodd-Frank financial reform legislation , which came down particularly hard on Goldman and its Wall Street-centric business model.\nSince the election, Goldman’s stock has risen 23 percent, much more than the broader market. In the year before the election, its stock fell about 10 percent. On Wednesday, after Mr. Cohn’s meeting with Mr. Trump became public, the bank’s shares rose 3.6 percent.\nMr. Blankfein led Goldman through the financial crisis and has had to guide it through the raft of new regulations introduced since then, which have limited the firm’s ability to make big profits from trading.\nJournalism that matters.\nMore essential than ever. Subscribe to the Times Over the last year, Mr. Blankfein has put more of an emphasis on the company’s technology prowess and has built up a new division to offer financial services to ordinary Americans, including Marcus, an online lending service . That work, though, has been slow going, and it may become less necessary if Mr. Trump’s administration eases the restrictions on Wall Street firms.\nIf Mr. Cohn does leave Goldman, the next candidates in line for the top job would be David M. Solomon , the head of the bank’s advisory division, and Harvey M. Schwartz , the current chief financial officer, who grew up in the firm as a trader alongside Mr. Cohn and Mr. Blankfein.\nIf Mr. Blankfein stays in the job for several years, leadership could pass to a next generation of executives, such as Stephen M. Scherr , who has been overseeing the new consumer banking operation, or R. Martin Chavez , the firm’s chief technology officer.\n “There are many generals to back the commander in chief, many colonels for every general, and many majors for each colonel,” said Chris Kotowski, a bank analyst at Oppenheimer & Company.\nMr. Cohn’s conversations with the Trump administration represent an unexpected twist in the career of a man who was once widely viewed as the natural next leader of Goldman. Mr. Cohn joined a trading division of Goldman in 1990 and rose along with Mr. Blankfein. In recent years, he has donated to both Democrats and Republicans, but he was historically registered as a Democrat.\nWhile he has all the trappings of a New York insider, including an apartment on Park Avenue, Mr. Cohn has long positioned himself as an outsider in the elite precincts of Wall Street. Raised in Ohio, the son of an electrician, Mr. Cohn has frequently spoken about his struggles with dyslexia and the brash talk he used to secure his first job as a trader.\nOn Wall Street, Mr. Cohn is known for his brusque style, though that has softened as he has taken on more leadership responsibility at the firm. Since becoming Goldman’s president, he has spent quite a bit of time in Washington, building contacts there, and has also become a fixture on the New York scene, where he has developed a relationship with Jared Kushner , Mr. Trump’s son-in-law.\nMr. Trump is said to be considering Mr. Cohn for director of the Office of Management and Budget , Politico reported on Wednesday.\nAny job Mr. Cohn would be offered in Washington would rank him below Mr. Mnuchin as Treasury secretary. The two men became partners at Goldman in 1994, but before Mr. Mnuchin left the firm in 2002, they were not known to be particularly close.",

Cohn, 56, a former Goldman commodities trader who joined the firm in 1990, has been widely considered to be the heir apparent to the company's CEO, Lloyd Blankfein. Dow Jones reported earlier on Wednesday that Cohn, who met with Trump on Tuesday, has had discussions about leaving the firm.

      "text": "Uber is already valued at more than $60 billion and its investors include Goldman Sachs and GV, formerly known as Google Ventures. Sweden proposed rule changes for its taxis on Wednesday that may help ride-hailing services like Uber Technologies in the long term, but also recommended that profit-making ride-sharing should be illegal.\nA government-appointed commission said that Sweden should allow taxis to operate without meters, making it easier for drivers to use their own cars - a development that has helped firms like Uber undercut traditional services in other countries.\nUber, which has faced setbacks in other parts of Europe, already offers taxi services in Sweden, but has to comply with the same regulations as other market players. It has faced protests, bans and legal action around the world including in the United States and much of Europe as its business model disrupts existing taxi services.\nUber is already valued at more than $60 billion and its investors include Goldman Sachs and GV, formerly known as Google Ventures. The Swedish commission's proposals would only allow use of unmetered cars if they are pre-booked and connected to a booking hub, which needs to collect data and make it available to the tax authorities. It also recommended that profit-making ride-sharing services, like UberPOP - recently suspended in Sweden - should be illegal.\n\"This confirms that ride-sharing is different from driving other people at a charge,\" Sweden's infrastructure minister Anna Johansson told a press conference.\nSweden, which deregulated its taxi sector almost three decades ago, decided last year to look at how to adapt its taxi and ride-sharing regulations. Uber, which launched in Europe five years ago, has faced opposition from regular taxi companies and some local authorities who say it creates unfair competition because it is not bound by strict local licensing and safety rules.\n\"Governments the world over have tried for decades to encourage ride-sharing,\" Martin Hedevag, General Manager Uber Sweden, said in response to the Swedish commission's proposals. \"What was lacking was the technology to connect people, and an incentive for them to share their journey.\"\n\"The technology exists today but these proposals continue to prevent the real benefits of ride-sharing on a scale which can contribute to easing some of the greatest challenges facing our cities today - congestion and pollution - by helping get more people in fewer cars.\"\nUber is currently seeking to convince Europe's top court that it is a digital service, not a transport company, in a case that could determine whether app-based startups should be exempt from strict laws meant for regular companies. It has been forced to suspend its UberPOP service, which relies on non-professional drivers using their own vehicles, in Sweden, Germany, France, Italy, Spain and Belgium.",

Times background from a couple of weeks ago: \nMnuchin, chief executive of New York-based hedge fund Dune Capital Management, spent 17 years early in his career at Goldman Sachs, where he was a partner and eventually chief information officer, before leaving in 2002. He then started an investment fund with billionaire investor George Soros, a prominent Hillary Clinton supporter, before co-founding Dune. Mnuchin, along with other investors, made a windfall after purchasing the failed bank IndyMac in 2009 in the wake of the financial crisis, and selling it for a substantial profit in 2015. \nVia: Business Insider : \nPresident-elect Donald Trump is set to name his Treasury secretary as soon as Wednesday, The New York Times reports. \nHis pick is the former Goldman Sachs banker Steven Mnuchin, who served as the national finance chair on Trump’s presidential campaign. \nMnuchin spent 17 years with Goldman Sachs, and his father worked at the bank for 30 years in stock trading. \nMnuchin was chief information officer at Goldman Sachs before leaving the firm in 2002. He also worked briefly for George Soros. \nDuring the depths of the financial crisis, a group led by Mnuchin bought troubled housing lender Indymac. After renaming the company OneWest, Mnuchin served as chairman of the firm until selling it to CIT Group in 2015. Share This Article...",

This was a short-lived foray into consulting – Ibáñez started out as an associate in J.P. Morgan’s TMT team and joined McKinsey briefly after completing an MBA at Chicago Booth. \nTechnology investment banking revenues are up 30% year on year to $6.6bn, according to Dealogic. Goldman Sachs also tops the M&A league tables in Europe, while Deutsche Bank has slipped to 10 th for the first nine months of the year. \nDeutsche Bank had some gaps to fill in TMT investment banking. Thomas Kratz, who was a director at Deutsche, moved to Mizuho in August to become head of European TMT investment banking.",

      "text": "0 All Share Services Topics: Donald Trump , drain the swamp , Goldman Sachs , president donald trump , Steve Mnuchin , Business News , News , Politics News FILE - In this Wednesday, Nov. 9, 2016 file photo, President-elect Donald Trump smiles as he arrives to speak at an election night rally, in New York. Mexico is starting to seriously contemplate the possibility that millions of its migrants could be deported under the proposals put forward by President-elect Trump. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci) (Credit: AP) \nPresident-elect Donald Trump may have been elected on a pledge to “ drain the swamp ,” but the swamp creatures themselves seem pretty pleased with how he’s staffing his new administration. \n“I can take glee in that — I think Donald Trump conned them [Trump’s populist supporters],” said hedge fund manager Whitney Tilson, who runs Kase Capital Management, in an interview with Bloomberg Markets on Wednesday . “I worried that he was going to do crazy things that would blow the system up. So the fact that he’s appointing people from within the system is a good thing.” \nTilson’s delight can be traced to the fact that, although Trump ran his campaign as an outsider who would protect working-class Americans from the predations of Wall Street and the billionaire classes, Trump’s nomination for treasury secretary is Steve Mnuchin, an alumnus of banking powerhouse Goldman Sachs. Mnuchin is perhaps most notorious for his management of OneWest Bank (formerly IndyMac), which he purchased in 2009. \nBy 2011, the so-called “foreclosure king” faced protesters on the front lawn of his Bel Air mansion. By 2015, a complaint was filed with the Department of Housing and Urban Development to investigate allegations that OneWest violated the Fair Housing Act by not placing branches in non-white communities, rarely providing mortgages to black homebuyers, and only taking measures to preserve foreclosed properties in white neighborhoods. \nIn short, Mnuchin seems like the exact wrong kind of person to reform Washington so that it will start caring about ordinary Americans — but he is the right man for the job if you’re part of America’s financial elite. \n“Some say that those who elected him may be disappointed in some way,” Scott Bok, head of the boutique investment bank Greenhill & Co, told Bloomberg Markets. “But I think all those people want is a stronger economy. If tax cuts and infrastructure spending get them that, I think they’ll be happy.” \n\nMatthew Rozsa is a breaking news writer for Salon.

Steve Bannon, campaign CEO for Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, right, looks on during a national security meeting with advisors at Trump Tower, Friday, Oct. 7, 2016, in New York. (AP Photo/ Evan Vucci) \nPublished in partnership with Shadowproof . \nDuring his campaign, President-elect Donald Trump condemned lobbyists, Wall Street, and DC insiders, claiming he would “drain the swamp” and bring reform to Washington if elected. \nNo company epitomizes the incestuous swampy relationship between Washington and Wall Street like Goldman Sachs. Nicknamed Government Sachs , it has already produced two former US treasury secretaries—Hank Paulson and Robert Rubin—and a large number of the federal regulators tasked with policing the financial services industry. \nGoldman Sachs, like the other Too Big To Fail/Jail banks on Wall Street, has been at the forefront of pushing corporations to ship American jobs oversees and played a leading role in crashing the US economy in 2008 through reckless greed and criminal fraud in the mortgage securities market. \nYet Trump is backing two former Goldman executives for high positions within his administration. Trump has chosen second-generation Goldman Sachs executive Steve Mnuchin to be his treasury secretary. Mnuchin’s father was a Goldman partner and Mnuchin himself worked at Goldman for 17 years. \nSteve Bannon, who is also a former Goldman Sachs executive, is set to be President Trump’s chief adviser. Despite Bannon’s embrace of economic nationalism in a recent interview with The Hollywood Reporter, Bannon was singing the praises of Goldman Sachs as recently as 2012. \nIn an interview for a French news documentary, “Goldman Sachs: The Bank That Runs The World,” Bannon compared joining the Wall Street bank to joining the Roman Catholic religious order of the Jesuits: INTERVIEWER : What did Goldman Sachs represent for you? STEVE BANNON: Goldman Sachs represented excellence and meritocracy. It didn’t matter where you came from, it didn’t matter what school you went to, what your religion was or what was your ethnicity. It just mattered how hard you worked, how smart you were, and how good a banker you were for your clients. It was really like joining the Jesuits . This seems antiquated today, it was before the financialization, it was before all these quants and mathematicians really came to Wall Street. \nThe Jesuits? Really? Because a brief look at Goldman Sachs’ rap sheet would lead one to think the bank has specialized in sin. They have incurred fines totaling in the billions with victims both large and small. \nIn his interview with The Hollywood Reporter, Bannon said, “The globalists gutted the American working class and created a middle class in Asia. The issue now is about Americans looking to not get f—ed over. If we deliver.” \nWho exactly did Bannon think he was praising in 2012? Goldman Sachs is one of the architects of neoliberal globalization, especially moving American factories to China and elsewhere in Asia. And, like other banks, Goldman has lobbied US companies to look for lower wages out of the country to boost profitability. \nGoldman Sachs is a case study in pursuing transnational, globalist interests at the expense of the American worker. Is there a mea culpa coming, Steve? Be Sociable, Share!",

      "text": "By MARLEY JAY - 12/1/16 10:09 AM \nNEW YORK — More gains in Goldman Sachs and Chevron helped pull the Dow Jones industrial average to another record high even as other indexes were flat to lower in early trading Thursday. Ford and General Motors are rising after they announced strong sales in November. Technology companies and companies that pay big dividends are trading lower. \nKEEPING SCORE: The Dow gained 67 points, or 0.4 percent, to 19,190 as of 9:50 a.m. Eastern time, above the record it set last week. The Standard & Poor’s 500 index fell a fraction to 2,197. The Nasdaq composite fell 16 points, or 0.4 percent, to 5,3047 as technology companies like Facebook and Yahoo slipped. \nENERGY: Oil prices continued to rise and reached their highest since mid-October. Benchmark U.S. crude picked up $1.28, or 2.6 percent, to $50.72 a barrel in New York after it jumped 9.3 percent Wednesday. Brent crude, the standard for pricing international oils, added $1.39, or 2.7 percent, to $53.23 a barrel in London. ConocoPhillips rose 78 cents, or 1.6 percent, to $49.30 and Chevron gained $1.99, or 1.8 percent, to $113.5. \nThe price of oil had soared Wednesday after the members of OPEC, which collectively produce more than one-third of the world’s oil, agreed to cut production starting in January. The price of oil has mostly traded between $40 and $50 a barrel since early April. It dipped as low as $26 a barrel in February. \nBANKS: Bond prices continued to fall. That yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 2.45 percent from 2.38 percent, its highest since July 2015. That sent bank stocks higher because higher bond yields are linked to higher interest rates, which allow banks to make more money from lending. Bank of America climbed 38 cents, or 1.8 percent, to $21.49 and JPMorgan Chase picked up $1.28, or 1.6 percent, to $81.45. \nDOLLAR DOWN: Discount store chain Dollar General said its business was hurting by falling prices for some goods as well as cuts in government benefits that help people with low incomes buy food. The company’s results fell short of analyst estimates and its shares lost $4.81, or 6.2 percent, to $72.47. Dollar General reached all-time highs this summer but has fallen after two weak quarterly reports. \nFILTER DEAL: Parker-Hannifin, which makes motion and control products, said it will pay about $4 billion for Clarcor, a company that makes mobile, industrial and environmental filtration products. That values Clarcor at $83 a share. Its stock jumped $12.01, or 17 percent, to $82.46 while Parker-Hannifin rose $3.57, or 2.6 percent, to $142.50. \nIN THE FAST LANE: Automakers were reporting their monthly sales Thursday. Ford rose 41 cents, or 3.4 percent, to $12.37 and General Motors climbed 74 cents, or 2.1 percent, to $35.27 after both disclosed stronger sales growth than analysts expected. \nCURRENCIES: After a big gain Wednesday, the dollar rose to 114.60 yen from 114.22 yen. The euro rose to $1.0603 from $1.0599. \nOVERSEAS: Britain’s FTSE 100 fell 1.3 percent and the CAC 40 in France shed 0.3 percent. Germany’s DAX fell 0.8 percent. Japan’s Nikkei 225 jumped 1.1 percent and the Kospi of South Korea was little changed. The Hang Seng index in Hong Kong gained 0.4 percent. \n____ \nAP Markets Writer Marley Jay can be reached at http://twitter.com/MarleyJayAP His work can be found at http://bigstory.ap.org/journalist/marley-jay",

      "text": "NEW YORK - More gains in Goldman Sachs and Chevron helped pull the Dow Jones industrial average to another record high even as other indexes were flat to lower in early trading Thursday. Ford and General Motors are rising after they announced strong sales in November. Technology companies and companies that pay big dividends are trading lower.\nKEEPING SCORE: The Dow gained 67 points, or 0.4 per cent, to 19,190 as of 9:50 a.m. Eastern time, above the record it set last week. The Standard & Poor's 500 index fell a fraction to 2,197.

(AP Photo/Richard Drew, File)\nENERGY: Oil prices continued to rise and reached their highest since mid-October. Benchmark U.S. crude picked up $1.28, or 2.6 per cent, to $50.72 a barrel in New York after it jumped 9.3 per cent Wednesday. Brent crude, the standard for pricing international oils, added $1.39, or 2.7 per cent, to $53.23 a barrel in London. ConocoPhillips rose 78 cents, or 1.6 per cent, to $49.30 and Chevron gained $1.99, or 1.8 per cent, to $113.5.\nThe price of oil had soared Wednesday after the members of OPEC, which collectively produce more than one-third of the world's oil, agreed to cut production starting in January. The price of oil has mostly traded between $40 and $50 a barrel since early April. It dipped as low as $26 a barrel in February.\nBANKS: Bond prices continued to fall. That yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 2.45 per cent from 2.38 per cent, its highest since July 2015. That sent bank stocks higher because higher bond yields are linked to higher interest rates, which allow banks to make more money from lending. Bank of America climbed 38 cents, or 1.8 per cent, to $21.49 and JPMorgan Chase picked up $1.28, or 1.6 per cent, to $81.45.\nDOLLAR DOWN: Discount store chain Dollar General said its business was hurting by falling prices for some goods as well as cuts in government benefits that help people with low incomes buy food. The company's results fell short of analyst estimates and its shares lost $4.81, or 6.2 per cent, to $72.47. Dollar General reached all-time highs this summer but has fallen after two weak quarterly reports.\nFILTER DEAL: Parker-Hannifin, which makes motion and control products, said it will pay about $4 billion for Clarcor, a company that makes mobile, industrial and environmental filtration products. That values Clarcor at $83 a share. Its stock jumped $12.01, or 17 per cent, to $82.46 while Parker-Hannifin rose $3.57, or 2.6 per cent, to $142.50.\nIN THE FAST LANE: Automakers were reporting their monthly sales Thursday. Ford rose 41 cents, or 3.4 per cent, to $12.37 and General Motors climbed 74 cents, or 2.1 per cent, to $35.27 after both disclosed stronger sales growth than analysts expected.\nCURRENCIES: After a big gain Wednesday, the dollar rose to 114.60 yen from 114.22 yen. The euro rose to $1.0603 from $1.0599.\nOVERSEAS: Britain's FTSE 100 fell 1.3 per cent and the CAC 40 in France shed 0.3 per cent. Germany's DAX fell 0.8 per cent. Japan's Nikkei 225 jumped 1.1 per cent and the Kospi of South Korea was little changed. The Hang Seng index in Hong Kong gained 0.4 per cent.\n____\nAP Markets Writer Marley Jay can be reached at http://twitter.com/MarleyJayAP His work can be found at http://bigstory.ap.org/journalist/marley-jay\n ",

      "text": "NEW YORK - More gains in Goldman Sachs and Chevron helped pull the Dow Jones industrial average to another record high even as other indexes were flat to lower in early trading Thursday. Ford and General Motors are rising after they announced strong sales in November. Technology companies and companies that pay big dividends are trading lower.\nKEEPING SCORE: The Dow gained 67 points, or 0.4 per cent, to 19,190 as of 9:50 a.m. Eastern time, above the record it set last week. The Standard & Poor's 500 index fell a fraction to 2,197. The Nasdaq composite fell 16 points, or 0.4 per cent, to 5,3047 as technology companies like Facebook and Yahoo slipped.\nA monitor shows the current exchange rate between Japanese yen and U.S. dollar, top, at a foreign exchange brokerage in Tokyo Thursday, Dec. 1, 2016.

More gains in Goldman Sachs and Chevron helped pull the Dow Jones industrial average to another record high even as other indexes were flat to lower in early trading Thursday, Dec. 1, 2016. (AP Photo/Richard Drew, File)\nENERGY: Oil prices continued to rise and reached their highest since mid-October. Benchmark U.S. crude picked up $1.28, or 2.6 per cent, to $50.72 a barrel in New York after it jumped 9.3 per cent Wednesday. Brent crude, the standard for pricing international oils, added $1.39, or 2.7 per cent, to $53.23 a barrel in London. ConocoPhillips rose 78 cents, or 1.6 per cent, to $49.30 and Chevron gained $1.99, or 1.8 per cent, to $113.5.\nThe price of oil had soared Wednesday after the members of OPEC, which collectively produce more than one-third of the world's oil, agreed to cut production starting in January. The price of oil has mostly traded between $40 and $50 a barrel since early April. It dipped as low as $26 a barrel in February.\nBANKS: Bond prices continued to fall. That yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 2.45 per cent from 2.38 per cent, its highest since July 2015. That sent bank stocks higher because higher bond yields are linked to higher interest rates, which allow banks to make more money from lending. Bank of America climbed 38 cents, or 1.8 per cent, to $21.49 and JPMorgan Chase picked up $1.28, or 1.6 per cent, to $81.45.\nDOLLAR DOWN: Discount store chain Dollar General said its business was hurting by falling prices for some goods as well as cuts in government benefits that help people with low incomes buy food. The company's results fell short of analyst estimates and its shares lost $4.81, or 6.2 per cent, to $72.47. Dollar General reached all-time highs this summer but has fallen after two weak quarterly reports.\nFILTER DEAL: Parker-Hannifin, which makes motion and control products, said it will pay about $4 billion for Clarcor, a company that makes mobile, industrial and environmental filtration products. That values Clarcor at $83 a share. Its stock jumped $12.01, or 17 per cent, to $82.46 while Parker-Hannifin rose $3.57, or 2.6 per cent, to $142.50.\nIN THE FAST LANE: Automakers were reporting their monthly sales Thursday. Ford rose 41 cents, or 3.4 per cent, to $12.37 and General Motors climbed 74 cents, or 2.1 per cent, to $35.27 after both disclosed stronger sales growth than analysts expected.\nCURRENCIES: After a big gain Wednesday, the dollar rose to 114.60 yen from 114.22 yen. The euro rose to $1.0603 from $1.0599.\nOVERSEAS: Britain's FTSE 100 fell 1.3 per cent and the CAC 40 in France shed 0.3 per cent. Germany's DAX fell 0.8 per cent. Japan's Nikkei 225 jumped 1.1 per cent and the Kospi of South Korea was little changed. The Hang Seng index in Hong Kong gained 0.4 per cent.\n____\nAP Markets Writer Marley Jay can be reached at http://twitter.com/MarleyJayAP His work can be found at http://bigstory.ap.org/journalist/marley-jay\n ",

      "text": "By MARLEY JAY\nAP Markets Writer NEW YORK (AP) - More big gains for Goldman Sachs and Chevron helped pull the Dow Jones industrial average to another record high Thursday even as other indexes continued to slip. Ford and General Motors are rising after they announced strong sales in November. Technology companies and high-dividend stocks are trading lower.\nKEEPING SCORE: The Dow gained 66 points, or 0.3 percent, to 19,189 as of 10:45 a.m. Eastern time, above the record it set last week. Goldman Sachs and Chevron contributed 50 points to that gain. The Standard & Poor's 500 index fell 3 points, or 0.1 percent, to 2,195. The Nasdaq composite fell 54 points, or 1 percent, to 5,269 as technology companies like Facebook and Google's parent company, Alphabet, sank. Health care companies slipped.\nENERGY: Oil prices continued to rise and reached their highest since mid-October. Benchmark U.S. crude picked up $1.57, or 3.2 percent, to $51.01 a barrel in New York after it jumped 9.3 percent Wednesday. Brent crude, the standard for pricing international oils, added $1.75, or 2.3 percent, to $53.9 a barrel in London. ConocoPhillips rose 91 cents, or 1.9 percent, to $49.43 and Chevron gained $2.65, or 2.4 percent, to $114.21.\nThe price of oil had soared Wednesday after the members of OPEC, which collectively produce more than one-third of the world's oil, agreed to a small cut in production starting in January. The price of oil has mostly traded between $40 and $50 a barrel since early April. It dipped as low as $26 a barrel in February.\nBANKS: Bond prices continued to fall. That yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 2.44 percent from 2.38 percent, its highest since July 2015. That sent bank stocks higher because higher bond yields are linked to higher interest rates, which allow banks to make more money from lending. Bank of America climbed 61 cents, or 2.9 percent, to $21.73 and JPMorgan Chase picked up $1.25, or 1.6 percent, to $81.42.\nLOOKS FAMILIAR: Stocks are following the pattern that has held since the presidential election. Banks are rising as investors expect interest rates to increase, which will help banks make more money from lending. Industrial and materials companies are moving higher on the prospect of increased spending on infrastructure. Technology stocks are falling. A strengthening dollar could hurt their sales outside the U.S. Stocks that pay large dividends, like utilities and real estate companies, are also down. Those stocks become less appealing to investors seeking income when bond yields climb.\nDOLLAR DOWN: Discount store chain Dollar General said its business was hurting by falling prices for some goods as well as cuts in government benefits that help people with low incomes buy food. The company's results fell short of analyst estimates and its shares lost $5.33, or 6.9 percent, to $71.99. Dollar General hit an all-time high of almost $97 a share this summer but has fallen after two weak quarterly reports.\nFILTER DEAL: Parker-Hannifin, which makes motion and control products, said it will pay about $4 billion for Clarcor, a company that makes mobile, industrial and environmental filtration products. That values Clarcor at $83 a share. Its stock jumped $11.95, or 17 percent, to $82.40 while Parker-Hannifin rose $3.84, or 2.8 percent, to $142.77.\nIN THE FAST LANE: Automakers were reporting their monthly sales Thursday. Ford gained 80 cents, or 6.7 percent, to $12.76 and General Motors climbed $1.90, or 5.5 percent, to $36.43 after both disclosed stronger sales growth than analysts expected. Auto sales set record highs in 2015 and there have been signs recently that demand is waning.\nGUESS NOT: Clothing company Guess slashed its annual guidance as its business in the Americas continues to struggle. It's been trying to make its American business more profitable by closing stores and renegotiating leases, but Guess said it expects weaker sales at older stores. Its stock lost $1.56, or 10.2 percent, to $13.76.\nCALVINS STILL FIT: PVH, the owner of the Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger brands, raised its annual guidance after it reported strong results for its international business. Its stock rose $1.79, or 1.7 percent, to $107.73.\nCURRENCIES: After a big gain Wednesday, the dollar rose to 114.56 yen from 114.22 yen. The euro dipped to $1.0592 from $1.0599.\nOVERSEAS: European stock indexes struggled. In Britain, the FTSE 100 fell 0.9 percent and Germany's DAX fell 0.9 percent. The CAC 40 in France shed 0.4 percent. Japan's Nikkei 225 jumped 1.1 percent and the Kospi of South Korea was little changed. The Hang Seng index in Hong Kong gained 0.4 percent.\n____\nAP Markets Writer Marley Jay can be reached at http://twitter.com/MarleyJayAP His work can be found at http://bigstory.ap.org/journalist/marley-jay\nCopyright 2016 The Associated Press.

      "title": "Oil and banks take Dow to new highs, but other indexes fall",
      "text": "NEW YORK — More big gains for Goldman Sachs and Chevron helped pull the Dow Jones industrial average to another record high Thursday even as other indexes continued to slip. Ford and General Motors are rising after they announced strong sales in November. Technology companies and high-dividend stocks are trading lower.\nKEEPING SCORE: The Dow gained 66 points, or 0.3 percent, to 19,189 as of 10:45 a.m. Eastern time, above the record it set last week. Goldman Sachs and Chevron contributed 50 points to that gain. The Standard & Poor's 500 index fell 3 points, or 0.1 percent, to 2,195. The Nasdaq composite fell 54 points, or 1 percent, to 5,269 as technology companies like Facebook and Google's parent company, Alphabet, sank. Health care companies slipped.\nENERGY: Oil prices continued to rise and reached their highest since mid-October. Benchmark U.S. crude picked up $1.57, or 3.2 percent, to $51.01 a barrel in New York after it jumped 9.3 percent Wednesday. Brent crude, the standard for pricing international oils, added $1.75, or 2.3 percent, to $53.9 a barrel in London. ConocoPhillips rose 91 cents, or 1.9 percent, to $49.43 and Chevron gained $2.65, or 2.4 percent, to $114.21.\nThe price of oil had soared Wednesday after the members of OPEC, which collectively produce more than one-third of the world's oil, agreed to a small cut in production starting in January. The price of oil has mostly traded between $40 and $50 a barrel since early April. It dipped as low as $26 a barrel in February.\nBANKS: Bond prices continued to fall. That yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 2.44 percent from 2.38 percent, its highest since July 2015. That sent bank stocks higher because higher bond yields are linked to higher interest rates, which allow banks to make more money from lending. Bank of America climbed 61 cents, or 2.9 percent, to $21.73 and JPMorgan Chase picked up $1.25, or 1.6 percent, to $81.42.\nLOOKS FAMILIAR: Stocks are following the pattern that has held since the presidential election. Banks are rising as investors expect interest rates to increase, which will help banks make more money from lending. Industrial and materials companies are moving higher on the prospect of increased spending on infrastructure. Technology stocks are falling. A strengthening dollar could hurt their sales outside the U.S. Stocks that pay large dividends, like utilities and real estate companies, are also down. Those stocks become less appealing to investors seeking income when bond yields climb.\nDOLLAR DOWN: Discount store chain Dollar General said its business was hurting by falling prices for some goods as well as cuts in government benefits that help people with low incomes buy food. The company's results fell short of analyst estimates and its shares lost $5.33, or 6.9 percent, to $71.99. Dollar General hit an all-time high of almost $97 a share this summer but has fallen after two weak quarterly reports.\nFILTER DEAL: Parker-Hannifin, which makes motion and control products, said it will pay about $4 billion for Clarcor, a company that makes mobile, industrial and environmental filtration products. That values Clarcor at $83 a share. Its stock jumped $11.95, or 17 percent, to $82.40 while Parker-Hannifin rose $3.84, or 2.8 percent, to $142.77.\nIN THE FAST LANE: Automakers were reporting their monthly sales Thursday. Ford gained 80 cents, or 6.7 percent, to $12.76 and General Motors climbed $1.90, or 5.5 percent, to $36.43 after both disclosed stronger sales growth than analysts expected. Auto sales set record highs in 2015 and there have been signs recently that demand is waning.\nGUESS NOT: Clothing company Guess slashed its annual guidance as its business in the Americas continues to struggle. It's been trying to make its American business more profitable by closing stores and renegotiating leases, but Guess said it expects weaker sales at older stores. Its stock lost $1.56, or 10.2 percent, to $13.76.\nCALVINS STILL FIT: PVH, the owner of the Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger brands, raised its annual guidance after it reported strong results for its international business. Its stock rose $1.79, or 1.7 percent, to $107.73.\nCURRENCIES: After a big gain Wednesday, the dollar rose to 114.56 yen from 114.22 yen. The euro dipped to $1.0592 from $1.0599.\nOVERSEAS: European stock indexes struggled. In Britain, the FTSE 100 fell 0.9 percent and Germany's DAX fell 0.9 percent. The CAC 40 in France shed 0.4 percent. Japan's Nikkei 225 jumped 1.1 percent and the Kospi of South Korea was little changed. The Hang Seng index in Hong Kong gained 0.4 percent.\n____\nAP Markets Writer Marley Jay can be reached at http://twitter.com/MarleyJayAP His work can be found at http://bigstory.ap.org/journalist/marley-jay",

      "text": "Goldman Sachs to Gain in Trump Era (GS) By Michael Foster | December 1, 2016 — 8:32 AM EST Goldman Sachs ( GS ) shares are a good buy according to analysts at Deutsche Bank ( DB ) and Barron’s. Barron’s believes the investment bank is poised to benefit from several trends. After seeing heavy buying following President-elect Donald Trump’s surprise victory, Barron’s believes further upside is to come thanks to a number of Trump policy proposals that are likely to become law following his inauguration. Lower tax rates and less regulation are the most immediate upsides for GS, but Barron’s also noted higher interest rates, which are targeted by both Trump and the Federal Reserve , are likely to boost the bank. In a more in-depth and technical analysis, Deutsche Bank analysts also cited less regulation, lower tax rates and higher interest rates as reasons to buy GS. Additionally, DB believes stronger economic growth will boost the bank’s loan portfolio and fee revenues , but the market has not priced in the upside from these two trends into GS stock quite yet. DB economists predict GDP growth of 3% and 3.3% in 2017 and 2018 respectively, which will drive income for GS higher than current estimates. As a result of higher economic growth , DB analysts believe GS shares trade at a 10% discount to peers. This has caused the analysts to upgrade their rating on GS to Buy from Hold. The analysts also made positive comments on Wells Fargo Corp. ( WFC ) and Huntington Bancshares Inc. ( HBAN ). GS shares have seen their price-to-book fall in recent quarters, down to 0.751 at the end of the third quarter 2016. Assuming its book value has remained constant, that means GS is currently trading at a slight premium to book value. GS shares are up 21.7% year to date after being down for most of the year. Shares have risen 23% in the last month. Subscribe to News To Use for the latest insights and analysis Thanks for signing up to Investopedia Insights - News to Use.",

      "text": "NEW YORK — More big gains for Goldman Sachs and Chevron helped pull the Dow Jones industrial average to another record high Thursday even as other indexes continued to slip. Ford and General Motors are rising after they announced strong sales in November. Technology companies and high-dividend stocks are trading lower.\nAs of about 1:30 p.m. ET the Dow is up 40 points, or 0.2% to 19,163, about 11 points above the record it set last week. The Standard & Poor’s 500 index is off 0.3%.\nTaking a pounding is the Nasdaq composite, in a 1.3% slide as technology companies like Facebook and Google’s parent company, Alphabet, sank. Health care companies slipped.\nOil prices continued to rise and reached their highest since mid-October. Benchmark U.S. crude picked up 3.2%, to $51.01 a barrel in New York after it jumped 9.3% Wednesday.\nThe price of oil had soared Wednesday after the members of OPEC, which collectively produce more than one-third of the world’s oil, agreed to a small cut in production starting in January. The price of oil has mostly traded between $40 and $50 a barrel since early April. It dipped as low as $26 a barrel in February.\nBond prices continued to fall. That yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 2.44 percent from 2.38 percent, its highest since July 2015.\nStocks are following the pattern that has held since the presidential election. Banks are rising as investors expect interest rates to increase, which will help banks make more money from lending. Industrial and materials companies are moving higher on the prospect of increased spending on infrastructure. Technology stocks are falling. A strengthening dollar could hurt their sales outside the U.S. Stocks that pay large dividends, like utilities and real estate companies, are also down. Those stocks become less appealing to investors seeking income when bond yields climb.\nAutomakers were reporting their monthly sales Thursday. Ford gained 80 cents, or 6.7 percent, to $12.76 and General Motors climbed $1.90, or 5.5 percent, to $36.43 after both disclosed stronger sales growth than analysts expected. Auto sales set record highs in 2015 and there have been signs recently that demand is waning.\nEuropean stock indexes struggled. In Britain, the FTSE 100 fell 0.9 percent and Germany’s DAX fell 0.9 percent. The CAC 40 in France shed 0.4 percent.

      "text": "  Photo Sidney J. Weinberg, former chief executive of Goldman Sachs, was an adviser to five United States presidents. Credit Fabian Bachrach During World War II , President Franklin D. Roosevelt selected Sidney J. Weinberg , the chief executive of Goldman Sachs , to serve as the assistant director of the War Production Board. Mr. Weinberg was one of the few men on Wall Street to support Roosevelt in the 1932 election, and he went on to advise Presidents Harry S. Truman, Dwight D. Eisenhower and Lyndon B. Johnson.\nKnown as “Mr. Wall Street,” Mr. Weinberg began a tradition of Goldman executives taking leading roles in public service that is continuing under President-elect Donald J. Trump . Already, Steven Mnuchin has been tapped as Treasury secretary, Stephen K. Bannon was named senior adviser and Gary D. Cohn, Goldman’s president, is in talks about role in the Trump administration.\nHere are a few of the people to venture through the revolving door between Goldman and the government.\nPhoto Henry Fowler, Treasury secretary under President Johnson, in 1965. Credit United Press International Henry H. Fowler, Treasury secretary and a partner at Goldman \nA number of top government officials have joined Goldman after leaving office . Mr. Fowler was Treasury secretary in the Johnson administration. He helped raise the money to meet the soaring costs of the Vietnam War and proposed what turned out to be the last Federal budget surplus until 1998.\nContinue reading the main story   In 1969, Mr. Fowler left Washington and became a partner at Goldman. He said it would not have been in “good taste” to work in finance in Washington. And he said his new position “pays a little more” than the $35,000 a year he made as a cabinet secretary.\nJohn C. Whitehead, co-chairman of Goldman and deputy secretary of state. \nMr. Whitehead was one of New York’s most prominent citizens . A veteran of D-Day, he capped a lauded career on Wall Street and in the State Department by shepherding the first years of the city’s fractious effort to rebuild after the 2001 terrorist attacks.\nThe columnist Liz Smith once called him the “chairman of the establishment.” He helped pilot Goldman Sachs to the forefront of investment banking and led the boards of Harvard, the Asia Society and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, among other institutions. As deputy secretary of state in the Reagan administration, he helped wean the countries of Eastern Europe from the Soviet Union.\nPhoto Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin in 1996. Credit Stephen Crowley/The New York Times Robert E. Rubin, co-chairman of Goldman and Treasury secretary \nMr. Rubin amassed a fortune on Wall Street before heading the National Economic Council under President Bill Clinton. In 1994, Mr. Clinton selected him to become Treasury secretary . Mr. Rubin drew criticism just after his arrival in Washington when it was disclosed that he had sent farewell letters to hundreds of Goldman clients saying he was “looking forward to working with you in my new capacity.” He said that he was merely being polite.\nMr. Rubin played a role in arranging the compromise that led to the repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act . After leaving office, he joined a leadership triangle at Citigroup .\n  Kenneth D. Brody, management committee at Goldman and president of the Export-Import Bank \nAfter running Goldman’s real estate division, Mr. Brody was appointed by President Clinton to the once-lethargic Ex-Im Bank . Critics have contended that the bank’s business is really a form of corporate welfare benefiting mainly giants like Boeing and General Electric.\nWhen he arrived in Washington, he was astounded when an aide, told that it was difficult for the public to reach the agency on the telephone, replied that “those who need us know how to get us.” Mr. Brody said, “I went nuts” in response.\nGary Gensler, a partner at Goldman and chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission \nAfter minting a small fortune as one of the youngest partners in Goldman’s history, Mr. Gensler was named assistant secretary for financial markets in 1997. At the Treasury Department, he helped enact legislation exempting broad portions of derivatives trading from oversight.\nBut Mr. Gensler soon developed a reputation for cracking down on Wall Street during his time at the agency. The day in 2010 that the Dodd-Frank financial overhaul became final, he stayed past 4 a.m. to put the finishing touches on the law. His aggressive streak thrust the once-backwater agency into the front lines of reform. The push by Mr. Gensler clashed with the staid culture of an agency once known as the “watchdog that didn’t bark.”\nRomano Prodi, international adviser to Goldman Sachs and prime minister of Italy \nThe former economics professor and European Commission president served two terms as prime minister of Italy . In 2008, he lost a confidence vote and submitted his resignation.\nPhoto Mario Draghi, president of European Central Bank. Credit Yves Herman/Reuters Mario Draghi, vice chairman of Goldman Sachs International and president of the European Central Bank \nAs a vice chairman for Goldman Sachs in Europe, Mr. Draghi was a proponent of nations and pension funds using derivatives to manage their liabilities. In the 1990s, Mr. Draghi earned the nickname Super Mario when, as the Italian economy neared the brink, he became the acceptable public face of his country to foreign investors. In 2005, he was selected to oversee Italy’s central bank .\nAnd in 2011, he was named president of the European Central Bank as the economy was in a maelstrom. Faced with a eurozone economy stubbornly resistant to revival, the bank said this year that it would effectively pay commercial banks money to borrow central bank money.\nPhoto Jon Corzine, the former Wall Street executive and New Jersey lawmaker. Credit Krista Schlueter for The New York Times Jon S. Corzine, chief executive of Goldman and New Jersey lawmaker \nMr. Corzine amassed a $400 million fortune while guiding Goldman, but he was forced out of the company because several senior partners were angry that he made major decisions without consulting them. He spent more than $60 million to win election in 2000 to the United States Senate from New Jersey on a liberal platform. Concerns over Mr. Corzine’s vast holdings , most of which were tied up in Goldman stock, intensified after he was appointed to the influential Senate Banking Committee.\n  In 2005, he was elected governor of New Jersey in a nasty campaign that was the costliest in the state’s history. In one advertisement, his former wife was quoted as warning that Mr. Corzine would let down New Jersey voters just as he had let down his family.\n  After losing the governor’s race to Chris Christie, Mr. Corzine returned to Wall Street, presiding over the collapse of the brokerage firm MF Global and becoming a target of federal investigators. In recent weeks, Mr. Corzine and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission struck a tentative agreement to settle their case , according to people briefed on the matter.\nStephen Friedman, co-chairman of Goldman and White House chief economic adviser \nAround Goldman, Mr. Friedman is remembered for having built the company’s lucrative practice of advising companies on mergers and acquisitions.\nIn 2002, President George W. Bush chose the tenacious Wall Street veteran as his chief economic adviser . Mr. Friedman’s co-chairman at Goldman, Mr. Rubin, led President Clinton’s National Economic Council.\nMr. Friedman generated some controversy as chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York during the financial crisis, when the Fed was helping put together a rescue plan for Wall Street. He stepped down from that role in 2009 after questions arose about his ties to Goldman .\nIn 2014, Mr. Friedman appeared briefly on “Game of Thrones” dressed as a peasant .\nJoshua B. Bolten, executive for Goldman Sachs International and White House chief of staff \nThe former Goldman executive grew up in establishment Washington, the son of a Central Intelligence Agency officer. Mr. Bolten was the White House legislative affairs director for part of the administration of the first President Bush.\nUnder the second President Bush, he was deputy White House chief of staff, then director of the Office of Management and Budget and finally chief of staff . Mr. Bolten played an important role in putting together the Bush tax plan and helped recruit another Goldman executive , Henry M. Paulson Jr., as Treasury secretary. In 2008, the House voted to issue contempt citations against Mr. Bolten and a former White House counsel for refusing to cooperate in an investigation into the mass firings of federal prosecutors.\n  Robert K. Steel, vice chairman of Goldman and under secretary of the Treasury \nBefore the financial crisis, Mr. Steel was co-chairman of one commission that claimed that heavy-handed regulation was hindering financial innovation and another that argued that hedge funds could police themselves. By April 2008, he was extolling the powers that a “superregulator” might wield over Wall Street one day.\n“When you are driving fast down a slippery road, sometimes a regulator needs to tap lightly on the brakes to get you to slow down,” Mr. Steel told The New York Times. But to many on Wall Street and on Main Street, the car had already crashed.\nPhoto Henry Paulson, the former Treasury secretary, in 2014. Credit Ray Stubblebine/European Pressphoto Agency Henry M. Paulson Jr., chief executive of Goldman and Treasury secretary \nBefore he became Treasury secretary in 2006, Mr. Paulson agreed to hold himself to a higher ethical standard than his predecessors. That plan did not survive the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression . The government propped up the teetering financial system with tens of billions of taxpayer dollars, including aid that directly benefited his former company. To deal with the financial crisis, Mr. Paulson tapped so many former Goldman executives that bankers coined the nickname “Government Sachs.”\n“I operated very consistently within the ethic guidelines I had as secretary of the Treasury,” Mr. Paulson told lawmakers in 2009 , adding that he asked for an ethics waiver for his interactions with his old company “when it became clear that we had some very significant issues with Goldman Sachs.”\nMr. Paulson helped decide the fates of a variety of financial companies, including two longtime Goldman rivals, Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers, before his ethics waivers were granted. Ad hoc actions were taken by Mr. Paulson and officials at the Federal Reserve, like letting Lehman fail and compensating the trading partners of the American International Group.\nNeel T. Kashkari, investment banker for Goldman and president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis. \nMr. Kashkari arrived in Washington in 2006 after spending two years as a low-level technology investment banker for Goldman in San Francisco. Today, he runs the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis and compares banking to the nuclear power industry .\nMr. Kashkari’s latest proposal — called the Minneapolis Plan — is likely to pressure banks to break apart because the high cost of holding so much capital would mean it would no longer make sense to stay so large.\n  William C. Dudley, partner at Goldman and president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York \nA Goldman economist with a knack for reading the markets, Mr. Dudley stepped into the spotlight in 2009 as the Fed’s senior statesman on Wall Street. He has navigated a painful recession while leading the Fed’s sweeping efforts to stabilize the nation’s troubled financial industry.\nIn 2014, secret recordings detailing interactions between employees of the New York Fed and Goldman were made public. The former Fed employee, Carmen M. Segarra, who made the recordings had sued the New York Fed , arguing that she had been fired for being too hard on Goldman. Mr. Dudley defended the agency , but Senator Elizabeth Warren told him, “ You need to fix it, Mr. Dudley , or we need to get someone who will.”\nLast year, a former Goldman banker suspected of taking confidential documents from a source inside the New York Fed agreed to plead guilty , a rare criminal action on Wall Street.\nContinue reading the main story We’re interested in your feedback on this page.

      "text": "By Jimmy Vielkind in Albany and Azi Paybarah in Manhattan, with Addy Baird and Daniel Lippman BHARARA STAYING UNDER TRUMP - POLITICO New York’s Colby Hamilton: The consensus among most legal observers and former federal prosecutors was that there was little chance Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara would ultimately stay on under President-elect Donald Trump's administration. That consensus was proved wrong on Wednesday, when Bharara met with Trump at his Midtown office tower and said after that the president-elect had asked him to continue on as U.S. attorney, and that he intends to do so. “The president-elect asked, presumably because he's a New Yorker and is aware of the great work that our office has done over the past seven years, asked to meet with me to discuss whether or not I'd be prepared to stay on as the United States attorney to do the work as we have done it, independently, without fear or favor for the last seven years,” Bharara told reporters assembled in the lobby of Trump Tower, according to a pool report. “I agreed to stay on,” he continued.Bharara has made a major name for himself for his political corruption investigations, where he's already won big convictions. http://politi.co/2gHEf8J\nIT’S THURSDAY.

See the Playbill: http://bit.ly/2gAnOrU\nALBANY SPECIAL? - POLITICO New York’s Jimmy Vielkind: Talks about a special legislative session are continuing, a top Senate Republican said Wednesday, before repeating concerns that any legislative horse trading that includes a pay increase would be perceived as a “pay-to-play.” POLITICO New York reported Tuesday that Gov. Andrew Cuomo met quietly with legislative leaders on Sunday. On Wednesday morning, the Daily News reported that the Democratic governor might trade a pay increase for constitutional amendments to create a full-time Legislature, and possibly to impose term limits. The News said discussions on the proposed trade were ongoing, citing an anonymous source. Cuomo pushed the talks after his appointees to a commission tasked with adjusting legislative and executive pay led it to adjourn without recommending any salary increase. Rank-and-file lawmakers have been sour ever since , and legislative sources expressed skepticism about the outline presented by the News.\nIn a tweet Wednesday, Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie, a Democrat from the Bronx, said, \"There is no truth to the article claiming we are discussing term limits or constitutional amendments in exchange for a pay raise.\" “It is nonsense and the furthest thing from the truth,” Mike Whyland , a spokesman for Heastie, said in an email. State Sen. John DeFrancisco, a Republican from Syracuse who serves as the chamber’s floor leader, said during an interview on WCNY that talks are ongoing. He then faulted Cuomo’s handling of the pay commission, accusing him of interfering with what was supposed to be a ministerial process. http://politi.co/2g8g3J8\n-- A source familiar with the talks told POLITICO New York later Wednesday that Cuomo is essentially laying out a two-tiered option for lawmakers. Small potatoes: revive the pay commission, which said it would give a “modest” raise, and also act to fund a hate crime task force, make changes to government procurement and divvy up $2 billion in affordable housing money. The option for higher pay — which again would come from the commission — is there if lawmakers enact constitutional amendments banning outside income and imposing term limits.\n-- “There’s no this for that,” a Cuomo source told State of Politics, insisting that the supposedly independent pay commission provides insulation. http://bit.ly/2g8aTwE\n-- On Wednesday night, Cuomo spokesman Rich Azzopardi released a lengthy statement laying out an agenda for a potential special session. Heastie quickly released a statement saying that systematic changes shouldn’t be “considered on a whim.” http://politi.co/2fNoVme\nUNFINISHED BUSINESS - POLITICO New York’s Dan Goldberg: New York State officials are counting on the Obama administration, in one of its last acts, to renew a massive Medicaid waiver, which would provide a measure of security for the Cuomo administration as the state braces for a new Republican regime in Washington bent on revamping federal health care programs, including Medicaid. The state’s Medicaid waiver governs the vast majority of how New York's Medicaid program operates, including the $7.3 billion Delivery System Reform Incentive Payment program, the centerpiece of the Cuomo administration's effort to reform Medicaid. http://politico.pro/2gm1rbV\nSWAN SONG - POLITICO New York’s Dan Goldberg: Ram Raju, on Wednesday, marked the end of his three-year tenure as the CEO of New York City Health + Hospitals on a hopeful note, overseeing the ceremonial groundbreaking of a $28 million ambulatory care facility on Staten Island where residents have for decades complained of being ignored by City Hall and the city's public hospital system. But in many ways, Raju, who was appointed by Mayor Bill de Blasio in January, 2014, leaves the public system in more fragile shape than when he took over. The deficit has grown to nearly $2 billion and the system owes the city nearly $1 billion in payments that have been deferred over the last few years. http://politi.co/2g9iwTi\nFIRST LOOK -- Ray Kelly’s new role: The former New York City police commissioner is joining the advisory board of the Counter Extremism Project, a not-for-profit, nonpartisan organization formed to combat the growing threat from extremist ideology, a spokesman told POLITICO New York. “In order to stop extremism, all stakeholders, including law enforcement, elected leaders, the private sector and NGO’s must work together to develop effective solutions,” Kelly said in a statement. “The Counter Extremism Project has been at the forefront of this significant effort and I am proud to lend my support to the organization.” Kelly is also vice chairman of the intelligence firm K2, and an analyst for ABC News. CEP was founded in 2014 and is led by Ambassador Mark Wallace, who served as the U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations; former U.S. Homeland Security Advisor Fran Townsend; and former Senator Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut. Among CEP’s initiatives is a “research and crowdsourcing online campaign,” called #CEPDigitalDisruption, which, according to a spokesman, identifies, exposes, and reports extremist content on social media, (particularly on Twitter). More about the group, here: http://bit.ly/2fI4eNm\nFIRST DAUGHTER -- “Ivanka Trump, climate czar? The first daughter aims to use the first lady’s lectern to champion liberal causes,” by Politico’s Annie Karni: “Ivanka, 35, Trump’s avatar among the moneyed left-wing elite, is now poised to be the first ‘first daughter’ in modern history to play a larger public role than the first lady. And she’s positioning herself … as a bridge to moderates and liberals disgusted and depressed with the tone and tenor of the new leader of the free world. And the ambitious daughter, who once plotted her career around international brand domination, is planning to take on an even heavier lift. Ivanka wants to make climate change — which her father has called a hoax perpetuated by the Chinese — one of her signature issues, a source close to her told Politico. The source said Ivanka is in the early stages of exploring how to use her spotlight to speak out on the issue. If she can pull it off, her advocacy could come as a bit of solace to fearful Americans.” http://politi.co/2goLKk8\nWHAT WALL STREET IS READING -- “Goldman Sachs poised for return to power in Trump White House,” by Morning Money’s Ben White in New York: “Government Sachs is returning to Washington. After a decade in the wilderness, Wall Street’s most powerful firm, Goldman Sachs, is dominating the early days of the incoming Trump administration. The newly picked Treasury Secretary, Steven Mnuchin, spent 17 years at Goldman. Trump’s top incoming White House adviser, Steve Bannon, spent his early career at the bank. So did Anthony Scaramucci, one of Trump’s top transition advisers.\n“Goldman’s president, Gary Cohn , spent an hour schmoozing with President-elect Donald Trump on Tuesday and could be up for an administration job, possibly as director of the Office of Management and Budget, people close to Cohn and the transition said. Cohn, a long-time commodities trader, is friendly with Trump’s powerful son-in-law, Jared Kushner. It’s a stunning reversal of fortune for Goldman, a long-time Washington power that fell out of favor following the financial crisis. CEO Lloyd Blankfein got hauled before Congress along with other Wall Street executives to account for their behavior. And Trump, who ran as a populist and bashed Wall Street on the campaign trail, featured Blankfein as a shady and dangerous character in his final campaign ad.” http://politi.co/2gO6cIa\nMORNING MEDIA, with POLITICO's Joe Pompeo:\n-- AND THE NEXT TRUMP INTERVIEW GOES TO… Sean Hannity, whose program this evening will feature Donald Trump and Mike Pence in a joint sit-down out of Cincinnati. “They will discuss the status of the transition as well as the first stop of the thank-you tour,” according to Fox News. For those keeping track, this marks Trump’s fourth interview since the election, his second TV interview, and his first cable interview. The order goes like this: Wall Street Journal, “60 Minutes,” New York Times and now “Hannity.” Tonight’s chat will also presumably be the friendliest so far, given the anchor’s cozy rapport (understatement?) with the President-elect. “1000 jobs saved today! Awesome start!,” Hannity tweeted last night.\n-- REVOLVING DOOR: POLITICO NABS JOSH DAWSEY FROM THE WALL STREET JOURNAL: He’s going to be a White House correspondent for us, following his stint covering New York Mayor Bill De Blasio for the Journal. And he’s the latest in a series of new hires by our new editor Carrie Budoff-Brown, who’s also brought over Paul Volpe from The New York Times and Tara Palmeri from POLITICO’s European operation. “He struck us immediately as a classic POLITICO reporter,” Budoff-Brown wrote in a staff memo. “He excels at breaking news, getting behind the scenes to show how decisions are made, and holding public officials to account.” Dawsey was part of the Greater New York crew that was being shuffled around (i.e. laid off and forced to reapply for jobs at the paper) after the section’s standalone print component was folded into the main section of the Journal last month.\nOn that note: Morning Media also has learned that Greater New York Albany reporter Erica Orden (a birthday girl yesterday) is leaving her post at the state capitol to cover white-collar crime and public corruption cases as part of the Journal’s law bureau. Congrats guys!\n-- $10K PRICE TAG FOR NEW VANDEHEI VENTURE? Some news out of Recode’s “Evening With Code Media” event last night: “We still don’t know a lot about Axios, the yet-to-launch media startup founded by Politico co-founder and former CEO Jim VandeHei. But we do know it’ll be expensive. VandeHei is envisioning subscribers paying $10,000 or more for some of the startup’s news and analysis, he told Kara Swisher onstage at Recode’s Evening with Code Media on Wednesday night in New York City. The one-time Washington Post journalist said he can’t imagine being ‘super intrigued with a subscription less than $10,000.’ He declined to offer more specifics. The company’s coverage will center on business, technology, politics, and media. It will also focus, as many media companies are, on putting content in front of readers on the social networks where they are already spending a lot of time.” http://on.recode.net/2fN5YA0\nYou can read the full Morning Media column and sign up to receive it in your inbox by clicking here: http://politi.co/1PdFrwQ\nAIR DE BLASIO -- Use of NYPD helicopter rose after September -- POLITICO New York’s Laura Nahmias and Azi Paybarah: Mayor Bill de Blasio has used an NYPD helicopter to travel 10 times since Sept. 1, a sharp increase in his use of the aircraft. Before September, he had used the helicopter just eight times since taking office in January of 2014, according to records provided by the Police Department to POLITICO New York on Wednesday in response to a FOIL request. Those trips were typically taken in emergency situations, to quickly reach injured police officers or firefighters, or to attend funerals. … The mayor's increased use of the helicopter is notable because he had shown an aversion to using it. In 2015, after the mayor developed a reputation for being late to public events, a reporter from NY1 asked him why he didn't use a helicopter to get around. \"It's just not my thing,\" the mayor said. \"I prefer to be on the ground.\" http://politico.pro/2fGOryj\n-- WSJ headline: “Mayor Used NYPD Helicopter at Least 18 Times” http://on.wsj.com/2fGLfTx\n-- “... 21 helicopter trips since taking office” -- Daily News’ Rocco Parascandola and Jennifer Fermino: http://nydn.us/2fI19gj\nCONTROVERSIAL CO-PILOT -- NYT’s J. David Goodman: “A New York police detective who was investigated by a grand jury after he shot and killed an unarmed National Guardsman during a 2012 traffic stop in Queens is now part of the unit that flies Mayor Bill de Blasio around the city by helicopter, according to Police Department records. The detective, Hassan Hamdy, is listed as a co-pilot on three flights taken by the mayor this year … After the shooting, [Rev. Al] Sharpton organized a news conference … At the session, the website DNAInfo reported at the time, Mr. de Blasio, then the city’s public advocate, said: ‘None of what we have learned in the past two days has justified the tragic death of Noel Polanco. The Queens district attorney is right to investigate. Nothing less than the full truth is acceptable.’ … A Queens grand jury voted not to indict the detective. The city paid $2.5 million to settle a suit brought by Mr. Polanco’s family, according to documents filed with the city comptroller’s office.” http://nyti.ms/2fGNshN\nNOISE FROM THE LEFT -- Liberals unhappy with de Blasio -- WSJ’s Mara Gay: “New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio promised three years ago to usher in an array of liberal policies, but as he now seeks re-election some on the left are urging potential challengers to run against him. Some liberal advocates said they were disappointed with the Democratic mayor’s progress on issues such as homelessness, affordable housing and policing. ‘We want to see a change of course,’ said Jonathan Westin, executive director of New York Communities for Change, a community-organizing group that supports liberal causes. ‘If not, a lot of folks on the left will not be in a position to support the mayor,’ said Mr. Westin, who backed Mr. de Blasio in 2013. … Mandela Jones, a spokesman for Communities United for Police Reform … said the de Blasio administration had taken ‘timid, counterproductive approaches’ to changes to the police force.\n-- “In a letter scheduled to be sent Thursday to Alicia Glen, deputy mayor for housing and economic development, several liberal groups said her approach to housing didn’t include enough units for the lowest-income New Yorkers. ‘So far, your housing policies have largely failed to address the needs of the lowest-income residents, many of whom face homelessness and a frightening future in shelters,’ said the letter, which was signed by six groups, including New York Communities for Change and the Black Institute.” http://on.wsj.com/2fGKsC0\nALPHONSO DAVID PROFILED - Village Voice’s Ross Barkan: “David, 46, doesn't resemble your average Cuomo lifer — a burly, tough-talking, outer-borough operator like former executive deputy secretary Joe Percoco, who was likened to a member of the family before he was hit with federal corruption charges earlier this year. Close Cuomo aides are often brawlers, happy to berate lawmakers and reporters alike. David is every bit the bulldog Percoco was, but the resemblance stops there (one former aide described David, a yoga practitioner and fitness freak, as ‘ripped’). He comes with a law degree from Temple University, a clerkship with a federal judge, and experience as a staff attorney at Lambda Legal and running his own anti-addiction company in California. And unlike Percoco — and Cuomo — he's not going to scream at you over the phone.” http://bit.ly/2fN90V9\nBACK IN THE NEW YORK GROOVE -- “New York Poised to Get Grammy Awards Back in 2018,” by NYT’s J. David Goodman: “After a hiatus of more than a decade, the Grammy Awards are expected to return to New York in 2018, several people familiar with the city’s bid to lure the ceremony from Los Angeles said. The decision caps months of talks between the de Blasio administration and the Recording Academy to bring the 60th Annual Grammy Awards to the city — an effort that included a burst of last-minute fund-raising from business leaders. The ceremony has bounced between New York and Los Angeles since the first awards were given out in 1959. But the last time the awards were held in New York was in 2003, when the Bloomberg administration persuaded the Recording Academy, the nonprofit that organizes the Grammys, to return to New York after four years in California. … The hurdle in returning to New York this time around was the price tag: The Recording Academy said that producing the awards in New York would cost several million dollars over what it cost in Los Angeles ... A formal announcement regarding the 2018 ceremony, which will take place at Madison Square Garden, was expected to be made in the coming weeks by Mayor Bill de Blasio, but those involved in the negotiations and various members of the host committee have been informed of the impending move.” http://nyti.ms/2gn9Vzk\nEAT BEAT -- “Bareburger Team to Open Smokehouse in Burnside Biscuits Space in Astoria,” by DNAinfo’s Jeanmarie Evelly: “The team behind organic burger chain Bareburger plans to open a new barbeque smokehouse in the neighborhood, replacing the former Burnside Biscuits on 30th and Newtown Avenues, according to the owners. The restaurant, called Salt & Bone, will be a no-gas barbeque joint that will serve up meats and vegetables cooked in a smoker fueled by whole logs of oak, according to Jesseca Naldo, spokeswoman for the company. News of the eatery comes two months after southern fried chicken spot Burnside Biscuits — which was also owned by the Bareburger team — closed its doors after just over a year in business. A note posted on the door of Burnside Biscuits after it shuttered hinted at the owners' future plans for a smokehouse. ‘While this may be goodbye for now, don't stay away for too long. Our smoke signals will be visible from the L very, very soon,’ it read, prompting speculation from fans online over what it could mean.” http://dnain.fo/2gAmGV3\nTECHNOLOGICALLY ADVANCING -- “As New York’s Tech Scene Matures, Diversity Proves A Strength,” by Fast Company’s John Paul Titlow: “Can New York City be the next Silicon Valley? Ask a room full of New York tech leaders and a consensus quickly emerges: You’re missing the point. While the Big Apple has blossomed into a major technology market over the last several years, comparisons between New York and the Bay Area tend to overlook the unique nature of each locale. What New York’s tech industry lacks in billion-dollar exits, these people agree, it makes up for in diversity and a deeper integration into existing industries. By most recent measures, New York’s technology scene remains less than one third the size of San Francisco’s. And high-price exits like Yahoo’s $1.1 billion acquisition of New York-based Tumblr in 2013 may be relatively rare—although Verizon’s subsequent $4.8 billion acquisition of Yahoo may help shape the East Coast/West Coast rivalry in the long run. But what’s brewing in New York is viewed locally as a different kind of beast altogether, complete with its own metrics for success… One person who can vouch for the New York tech market’s inclusiveness is Michelle Peluso, chief marketing officer at IBM. In 1999, she cofounded the vacation deal site Site59, later acquired by Travelocity, where she then served as CEO for seven years. In her early quest for funding, Peluso found herself spending time in Silicon Valley, where dotcom-bubble era extravagance was on full display: parties featuring circus animals, rock bands, and Cirque du Soleil performers were a common sight. So were the faces of men. Lots and lots of men. ‘I just remember thinking: I do not fit in,’ Peluso recalled. ‘Ninety percent of the people there were guys. I just remember thinking, I’m doing this differently. This is not going to be the way I raise money. This is not going to be the network I have. I’m going to do it in New York.’” http://bit.ly/2gXdcXp\nREAL ESTATE, with POLITICO New York’s Sally Goldenberg:\n—“U.S. Will Ban Smoking in Public Housing Nationwide,” by New York Times’ Mireya Navarro: “Smoking will be prohibited in public-housing residences nationwide under a federal rule announced on Wednesday. Officials with the Department of Housing and Urban Development said the rule will go into effect early next year, but they are giving public housing agencies a year and a half to put smoke-free policies into effect. More than 1.2 million households will be affected, the officials said, although some 200,000 homes already come under smoking bans adopted voluntarily by hundreds of public housing agencies around the country. The ban will have the biggest implications in New York, where the New York City Housing Authority, the nation’s largest public housing agency, with 178,000 apartments and more than 400,000 residents, has lagged behind many of its smaller counterparts in adopting smoke-free policies.” http://nyti.ms/2gJOQO5\n—“Luxury-Condo Market Is Starting to Rebound In Downtown Manhattan,” by Wall Street Journal's Josh Barbanel: “On the upper floors of a cast limestone tower known as at 30 Park Place, in the heart of downtown, signs point to a resurgence in Manhattan’s sluggish luxury-condominium market. During November, Silverstein Properties Inc., the developer of the tower near City Hall, signed contracts for five new condos costing between about $20 million and $26 million. Sales for the month totaled $110 million. In all of 2016, only 11 other condos closed for more than $20 million below 34th Street in Manhattan, according to city deed filings. Other downtown developers are also reporting a rebound in sales and showings. This surge reflects the growing popularity of downtown as a place to live, brokers say, as new celebrity-chef restaurants opened, and the construction fencing came down around much of the World Trade Center site. The opening this year of the Oculus transportation center and its associated shopping hub have given the neighborhood a touch of panache. But brokers say the shift could prefigure a broader uptick in the Manhattan luxury market, as the economy strengthens and foreign buyers look to New York for an investment haven in world beset by uncertainty, despite the strong dollar.” http://on.wsj.com/2gWsMCB\n—“This townhouse is set to be the most expensive ever sold in NYC,” by New York Post’s Jennifer Gould: “David Wildenstein, heir to his family’s art-dealing dynasty, is in contract to sell his family townhouse at 19 E. 64th St. for a record-breaking $81 million, The Post has learned. The price breaks a 10-year townhouse record set when financier J. Christopher Flowers bought the Harkness Mansion at 4 E. 75th St. for a whopping $53 million in 2006. (That’s all presuming the deal does eventually close.) This news comes after a Ukrainian-born billionaire and serial real estate collector, Len Blavatnik — owner of Warner Music and an investor in the hit Broadway show ‘Hamilton’ — sued Wildenstein for reneging on a $79 million handshake deal that would have put the property in Blavatnik’s hands, as The Post reported last month.” http://nyp.st/2gJLxWV\nYou can find the free version of Sally’s real estate newsletter here: http://politi.co/2a1DgJk\nHAPPY BIRTHDAY: Natalie Ravitz, SVP of comms for the NFL after stints working for Rupert Murdoch, Mike Bloomberg and Sens.

      "text": "NEW YORK — More big gains for Goldman Sachs and Chevron helped pull the Dow Jones industrial average to another record high Thursday even as other indexes continued to slip.\nFord and General Motors are rising after they announced strong sales in November. Technology companies and high-dividend stocks are trading lower.\nAs of about 3:40 p.m. ET the Dow was up 52 points, or 0.3% to 19,176, about 24 points above the record closng high it set last week.\nThe Standard & Poor’s 500 index is off 0.5%. Taking a pounding is the Nasdaq composite, in a 1.6% slide as technology companies like Facebook and Google’s parent company, Alphabet, sank. Health care companies slipped.\nOil prices continued to rise and reached their highest since mid-October. Benchmark U.S. crude picked up 3.3%, to $50.85 a barrel in New York after it jumped 9.3% Wednesday.\nThe price of oil had soared Wednesday after the members of OPEC, which collectively produce more than one-third of the world’s oil, agreed to a small cut in production starting in January. The price of oil has mostly traded between $40 and $50 a barrel since early April. It dipped as low as $26 a barrel in February.\nBond prices continued to fall. That yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 2.44% from 2.38%, its highest since July 2015.\nStocks are following the pattern that has held since the presidential election. Banks are rising as investors expect interest rates to increase, which will help banks make more money from lending. Industrial and materials companies are moving higher on the prospect of increased spending on infrastructure. Technology stocks are falling. A strengthening dollar could hurt their sales outside the U.S. Stocks that pay large dividends, like utilities and real estate companies, are also down. Those stocks become less appealing to investors seeking income when bond yields climb.\nEuropean stock indexes struggled. In Britain, the FTSE 100 fell 0.9 percent and Germany’s DAX fell 0.9 percent. The CAC 40 in France shed 0.4 percent. Japan’s Nikkei 225 jumped 1.1 percent and the Kospi of South Korea was little changed. The Hang Seng index in Hong Kong gained 0.4 percent.",

      "text": "December 1, 2016 at 11:02 am \nLeaving firms like Goldman Sachs out there, untouched by CRIMINAL investigation, even protected from embarrassment when they have simple but important questions directed at them for years, destroys the ability of almost everyone in society to clearly distinguish right from wrong. On a large scale, this inability allows, no, forces people to become parts in a societal construct that makes almost everyone fearful of doing right. At its most damaging, as a group, we end up protecting and rewarding arch criminals. \nTheir whole business culture is rift with outright fraud and criminal wrong doing and by Trump choosing Mnuchin legitimizes their amoral behavior especially when he so heavily criticized Ted Cruz for his ties to Goldman Sachs. \nIn 2002 it was fined $1.65 million by the industry regulatory body NASD (now FINRA) for failing to preserve e-mail communications. \nIn 2003 it paid $110 million as its share of a global settlement by ten firms with federal, state and industry regulators concerning alleged conflicts of interest between their research and investment banking activities. \nThat same year, it had to pay $9.3 million in fines and disgorgement of profits in connection with federal allegations that it failed to properly oversee a former employee who had been charged with insider trading and perjury. \nIn 2004 Goldman was one of four firms each fined $5 million by NASD for rule violations relating to trading in high-yield corporate bonds; Goldman also had to make restitution payments of about $344,000. \nIn 2005 the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) announced that Goldman would pay a civil penalty of $40 million to resolve allegations that it violated rules relating to the allocation of stock to institutional customers in initial public offerings. \nThat same year, it paid a fine of $125,000 to NASD for violating rules relating to the sale of restricted securities during initial public offerings. Shortly thereafter, it was fined $140,000 by NASD for late and/or inaccurate reporting of municipal securities transactions. \nIn 2006 Goldman was one of 15 financial services companies that were fined a total of $13 million in connection with SEC charges that they violated rules relating to auction-rate securities. In another case relating to auction-rate securities brought by the New York State Attorney General, Goldman was fined $22.5 million in 2008. \nIn May 2009 Goldman agreed to provide about $50 million in relief to holders of subprime-mortgages in Massachusetts to remove itself from the state attorney general’s investigation of abuses relating to the origination and securitization of subprime loans. In July 2010 the SEC announced that Goldman would pay $550 million to settle the Abacus charges. That sum included a payment of $300 million to the U.S. Treasury and a distribution of $250 million to investors that had suffered losses in the deal. The settlement also required Goldman to “reform its business practices” but did not oblige the firm to admit to wrongdoing. The Abacus scandal also led to a £17.5 million fine imposed by Britain’s Financial Services Authority and a federal investor lawsuit that is pending. \nIn January 2011 Goldman announced that an internal review of its policies in the wake of the SEC settlement had found that only limited changes were necessary. Others apparently saw matters differently: \nIn November 2010 FINRA fined Goldman $650,000 for failing to disclose that two of its registered representatives, including Fabrice Tourre, had been notified by the SEC that they were under investigation. \nIn March 2011 the SEC announced that it was bringing insider trading charges against former Goldman director Rajat Gupta. He was accused of providing illegal tips, including one about Warren Buffet’s $5 billion investment in Goldman in 2008, to hedge fund manager Raj Rajaratnam. (Gupta was later convicted and sentenced to two years in prison.) \nIn September 2011 the Federal Housing Finance Agency sued Goldman and 16 other financial institutions for violations of federal securities law in the sale of mortgaged-backed securities to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. In August 2014 the agency announced that Goldman would pay $3.15 billion to settle its role in the case (through bond repurchases). In March 2012 the Commodities Futures Trading Commission announced that Goldman would pay $7 million to settle charges that it failed to diligently supervise trading accounts in the period from May 2007 to December 2009. Later that year, the CFTC fined Goldman $1.5 million for failing to properly supervise a trader who fabricated large positions to try to cover up losses. \nAlso in March 2012 a Goldman executive director named Greg Smith published an op-ed in the New York Times announcing his departure from what he called a “toxic and destructive” environment at the firm, saying he could “no longer in good conscience identify with what it stands for.” \nIn April 2012 the SEC and FINRA fined Goldman $22 million for failing to prevent its employees from passing illegal stock tips to major customers. \nIn July 2012 a federal appeals court rejected an effort by Goldman to overturn a $20.5 million arbitrator’s award to investors in the failed hedge fund Bayou Group who had accused Goldman of helping to perpetuate a Ponzi scheme. \nThat same month, Goldman agreed to pay $26.6 million to settle a suit brought by the Public Employee’s Retirement System of Mississippi accusing it of defrauding investors in a 2006 offering of mortgage-backed securities. \nIn September 2012 the SEC charged Goldman and one of its former investment bankers with “pay-to-play” violations involving undisclosed campaign contributions to then-Massachusetts state treasurer Timothy Cahill while he was a candidate for governor. Goldman settled its charges by agreeing to pay $12.1 million in disgorgement and penalties. Some good news for Goldman came in August 2012, when the Justice Department decided it would not proceed with a criminal investigation of the firm’s actions during the financial crisis and the SEC dropped an investigation of the firm’s role in a $1.3 billion subprime mortgage deal. \nIn January 2013 the Federal Reserve annnounced that Goldman and Morgan Stanley would together pay $557 million to settle allegations of foreclosure abuses by their loan servicing operations (Goldman’s share was $330 million). \nIn March 2013 the Fed cited “weaknesses” in Goldman’s capital plan and ordered it to submit a new proposal. \nIn December 2014 FINRA fined Goldman $5 million as part of a case against ten investment banks for allowing their stock analysts to solicit business and offer favorable research coverage in connection with a planned initial public offering of Toys R Us in 2010. \nIn April 2016 the Justice Department announced that Goldman would pay $5.06 billion to settle allegations relating to the sale of toxic securities between 2005 and 2007. \nIn August 2016 the Federal Reserve imposed a $36.3 million penalty on Goldman in connection with a case involving a leak of confidential government information.",

      "text": "December 1 at 3:45 PM Follow @renaemerle\nGoldman Sachs president and chief operating officer Gary Cohn arrives for a meeting with President-elect Donald Trump at Trump Tower in New York on Thursday. (Bryan R. Smith/AFP/Getty Images) NEW YORK — When Gary Cohn, president of Goldman Sachs, walked into Trump Tower earlier this week, it was just one of dozens of meetings President-elect Donald Trump as held with advisers, potential cabinet picks and well wishers over the last few weeks. But on Wall Street, Cohn’s presence in the gold-accented lobby represented something much bigger: One of the world’s most important banks is making its way back into Washington’s inner circle.\nAfter years on the sideline, Goldman Sachs and the rest of the Wall Street elite are poised to come roaring back.\nTrump has already picked several Goldman Sachs alums for several key positions. Steven Mnuchin, a 17-year veteran of the bank, is slated to be the next Treasury Secretary and Steve Bannon, Trump’s chief strategist, worked on mergers and acquisition deals for Goldman Sachs. Hedge fund manger Anthony Scaramucci began his career at the New York bank and has emerged as one of Trump’s closest advisers on his presidential transition. According to Politico, Cohn, a 26-year veteran of the Goldman Sachs, is being considered for a position heading the Office of Management and Budget.\nGoldman Sachs’ sometimes controversial relationship with Washington goes back decades. One of its founders, Henry Goldman , advised on the creation of the Federal Reserve. President Franklin D. Roosevelt chose Goldman CEO Sidney Weinberg to serve on the War Production Board during World War II. And more recently, President Bill Clinton named former Goldman co-chairman Robert Rubin to head the Treasury Department. George W. Bush picked Henry Paulson, another Goldman alum for the same job.\nEach in turn filled the government ranks with so many more former Goldman executives that the bank eventually earned the nickname “Government Sachs.”\n“The Goldman organization has always been able to make sure they are close to power, they are very good at cultivating and maintaining relationships,” said Christopher Whalen, head of research for Kroll Bond Rating Agency.\nTrump’s elevation of so many Goldman alums may signal a wider shift in Wall Street’s public standing, which has been battered since the 2008 financial crisis, industry analysts say. Even Trump played to public distrust, releasing a television ad that flashed an image of Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein as the Republican candidate warned of a “global power structure” that was robbing American workers.\nThe public’s resentment towards Goldman Sachs was so deep that Blankfein initially demurred when asked who he would vote for. “I don’t want to help or hurt anybody by giving them my endorsement,” Blankfein, who has previously supported Hillary Clinton, told CNBC.\nWall Street insiders widely expected to be largely left on the sidelines if Hillary Clinton had won the White House. They felt Clinton would have found it difficult to resist pressure by progressives in the Democratic Party that she be tough on Wall Street.\nBut the tone has shifted since Trump’s election. “After Nov. 8, you could say the financial crisis was over,” said Mike Mayo, a banking analyst and managing director with global boutique brokerage firm CLSA. “It was a pivot from rebuilding the banking industry to using banks to better facilitate better economic growth.”\nThat has some progressive groups crying foul. “These guys are galactic deal-makers, transaction merchants, not people who face the extraordinary littleness of life,” said Bart Naylor of Public Citizen. “They also know each other, attend each other’s weddings, buy each other’s Hamptons mansions … When it comes to financial policy, they know about spreads and liquidity, but not about what you can’t buy with food stamps or changes in bus schedules.”\nGoldman Sachs is no stranger to such talk. The bank has been best known as a secretive, Wall Street dealmaker with the ear of the White House. It helps big institutions and billionaires bet on the markets and large corporations raise money, but until recently had little interaction with average investors — clients must have at least $10 million for its wealth-management services.\nBut in recent years it has tried to soften its image. It has launched programs to help women entrepreneurs, produced regular podcasts, and earlier this year offered a high-yield online savings accounts for those with as little as $1.\nIf Trump taps Cohn, currently the bank’s president, for a position in his administration, it would send Goldman scrambling to find a replacement. Cohn, who has been at the bank since 1990, has been widely viewed as heir apparent, poised to become CEO when Blankfein retired.\n“Throughout its 147-year history, Goldman Sachs has encouraged its employees to give back to the community while they are working here and after they leave,” said Jake Siewert, communications director at Goldman. “We are proud that many have gone on to serve their country and their communities after they have left.”",

      "text": "Follow Us ® 2016 Bustle 7 Times Donald Trump & His Cronies Ripped Goldman Sachs — Before Bringing Its Employees Into The White House By Jon Hecht 10 hours ago \nAs Donald Trump's cabinet is beginning to take shape, one company (besides, of course, the Trump Organization and its potential conflicts of interest ) is finding itself in the national spotlight: Goldman Sachs . Trump has so far announced two veterans of the mighty investment bank as members of his administration: Steve Bannon, who worked for Goldman Sachs before running Breitbart and will serve as senior White House adviser, and Steve Mnuchin, who was a partner for 17 years and is Trump's nominee for Secretary of the Treasury. Trump also met with Gary Cohn, Goldman's president , who is rumored to be a potential pick for the Office of Management and Budget. Also, Goldman Sachs stock is shooting up , as its status in Washington seems to be getting better. \nTrump's embrace of America's most notorious financial behemoth is an odd look for a president-elect who spent much of the election attacking it. Already, some of Trump's most ardent supporters reportedly feel betrayed as he apparently abandons his populist rhetoric of fighting back against corruption and elites. \nLet's look back at the Trump from the campaign, who railed against Goldman Sachs. Below are eight times he, or people fighting for him, did just that: 1. Trump Says Goldman Sachs \"Owns\" Ted Cruz [Embed] \nThere was a brief time in January when Texas Sen. Ted Cruz was beating Trump in national polls. Trump struck back at a rally in Iowa where he attacked Cruz for having improperly disclosed a million dollar loan he'd received from Goldman Sachs, and said Cruz wouldn't protect people from the big banks. Trump, of course owes millions to the bank through his companies . [Twitter Embed: https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/688328034651361280] [Twitter Embed: https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/688443772565348352] 2. Trump Advisor Attacks Cruz's Wife For Her Ties To Goldman Sachs After a Super PAC attacked Melania Trump for a nude photoshoot she did for GQ , Trump tweeted an attack on Heidi Cruz, Ted Cruz's wife: [Twitter Embed: https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/712457104515317764] \nIn an interview with a New York radio station in March, Roger Stone, a longtime Trump confidante, tied Trump's vague threat to Cruz's previous job at Goldman Sachs, and again mentioned Cruz's loan from the bank. [Embed] \nStone said of Heidi Crus, \"She was a top aide for Robert Zelick, who took her to Goldman Sachs — You remember who they are? The bank you and I bailed out. Goldman then subsequently gave a million dollar illegal sweetheart deal to the Cruz campaign, which he lied about.\" 3. Trump Advisor Calls Cruz \"Goldman Sachs' Favorite Senator\" Trump's senior policy advisor, Stephen Miller, opened for the candidate at a rally in Wisconsin in early April. He ripped into Cruz, claiming he wasn't a true conservative, and especially for his ties to Goldman Sachs and called him a \"Wall Street globalist.\" [Embed] 4. Trump Supporters Berate Ted Cruz In a video that went viral, Ted Cruz tried to reason with Trump supporters in Indiana, who repeatedly insulted him. \"Where's your Goldman Sachs jacket?\" one of them asked, again tarring Cruz with his wife's employer. [Embed] 5. Trump Calls Bernie Sanders A Sellout For Goldman Sachs After Bernie Sanders endorsed Hillary Clinton, his rival in the Democratic primary, Trump was quick to say he betrayed his values. He tweeted: [Twitter Embed: https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/752910855939952640] 6. Trump Hits Clinton On Goldman Sachs Speeches [Embed] During the second presidential debate, Trump hit Clinton for her speeches to Goldman Sachs before she started running for president. Trump implied that Clinton was lying to the public about getting tough on Wall Street, and only telling the truth to bankers. \" She got caught in a total lie. Her papers went out to all her friends at the banks, Goldman Sachs and everybody else. And she said things, WikiLeaks, that just came out. And she lied.\" 7. Trump's ad juxtaposes Clinton with Lloyd Blankfein Just before the end of the campaign, Trump released a closing ad, which made sure to tie Clinton to \"globalist\" bankers. It featured footage of Clinton shaking hands with Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein, while Trump narrates, \"It's a global power structure that is responsible for the economic decisions that have robbed our working class, stripped our country of its wealth, and put that money into the pockets of a handful of large corporations and political entities.\" [Embed] \nAnd now, Trump seems to be filling his administration with people from those exact same large corporations.

      "text": "Donald Trump’s appointee for Treasury Secretary, Steven Mnuchin, was once a Goldman Sachs banker, but his career could be better characterized as one built on financial opportunism. Credit Photograph by Evan Vucci / AP On Thursday morning, a headline on the cover of Le Monde , France’s centrist daily newspaper, declared, “Steven Mnuchin, un Loup de Wall Street à la Maison Blanche”—“A Wolf of Wall Street in the White House.” The subtitle described Mnuchin, who, pending confirmation, will be the next Treasury Secretary, as “one of those pure products of finance that the candidate Donald Trump couldn’t stop castigating during his campaign.” Another headline leading Le Monde ’s business section, “Goldman Sachs and Finance Are Returning to the White House,” further reinforced the fact that the promises Trump made as he was campaigning are now strangely at odds with some of the appointments he’s named, and that the rest of the world, watching with a mixture of amusement and horror, has taken note.\nMnuchin himself reinforced the dissonance on CNBC’s “ Squawk Box ,” just before the announcement became official. “One of the good things about Wilbur and I, we have actually been bankers,” Mnuchin said, referring to Wilbur Ross, who was sitting beside him, and who is Trump’s recently named appointee for Secretary of Commerce. Ross is a titan of Wall Street, who made his fortune investing in near-bankrupt companies and building them up again.\nThe idea that being a banker is an alluring characteristic for a member of the Trump Administration is a startling change. For months, Trump criticized Hillary Clinton for giving paid speeches to banks like Goldman Sachs. There were periods, later in the fall, when the Trump campaign seemed to be sending out e-mail blasts nearly every day highlighting one comment or other that Clinton had made in front of a Goldman audience—comments retrieved from her campaign manager’s hacked e-mail account. Still, even during the campaign, the messages from Trump on financial matters were confusing and often at odds. Trump complained not so much about Wall Street itself but about his opponent’s alleged affiliation with it. Were Wall Street banks the enemy of working people, or was the enemy the politicians who socialized with bankers? Was Wall Street part of the establishment Trump was railing against or not? Trump spent much of his time campaigning in states where jobs had emptied out and the landscape was dotted with idle factories, but, strangely, Trump seemed rarely to criticize the managers of those companies directly—rather, it was the fault of Washington alone that those corporations had moved to places that were much more economically advantageous. (A similar logic explained why Trump, a billionaire, had not paid federal taxes in many years. As he said during the third debate with Hillary Clinton , “We’re entitled because of the laws that people like her pass to take massive depreciation and other charges. And we do it.”) As with much of what Trump said as he petitioned for the job that he will soon have, his true feelings were unclear.\nMnuchin, who presents as a mild-mannered egghead, was once a Goldman banker, but his career could be better characterized as one built on financial opportunism. He was born into wealth and privilege, the son of another Goldman banker, who later left Wall Street to trade in art, a trajectory the son loosely followed. Mnuchin went to Yale, where he reportedly drove a Porsche; he joined Goldman after his graduation, in 1985. He stayed with the bank for seventeen years, developing an expertise in trading distressed bank assets. He left in 2002 and worked briefly for two prominent hedge-fund managers, Eddie Lampert, a Yale classmate, and George Soros, the billionaire who has become known in recent years as a donor to liberal causes. Soros provided seed money for Mnuchin to start, in 2004, his own hedge fund, Dune Capital Management, “named for a spot near his house in the Hamptons,” according to Bloomberg Businessweek . Dune made investments in at least two Trump-related real-estate projects, and ended up settling a lawsuit with Trump over one of them.\nIn 2009, during the heat of the financial crisis, Mnuchin assembled a group of investors to make a bid for IndyMac, a California bank that had to be taken over by the federal government following one of the biggest bank failures in U.S. history. The group bought the bank’s assets for $1.6 billion and renamed it OneWest Bank, ultimately selling it in 2015 for $3.4 billion. Because so many of the loans that the bank owned were distressed, it became a “ foreclosure machine ,” in the words of one housing advocate, a point that is likely to become a focus of criticism. Eventually, Mnuchin took his fortune and turned to Hollywood, investing in such films as “Avatar,” one of the highest-grossing movies of all time.\nIf Mnuchin and Ross are confirmed as Treasury Secretary and Commerce Secretary, respectively, they will be leading the Trump Administration’s plans on tax policy. Trump began his Presidential campaign by promising to eliminate the “carried interest” tax loophole, which allows many hedge-fund and private-equity-fund managers to pay extremely low taxes on much of their compensation. This proposal, however, was followed by a tax plan that promised to lower taxes for hedge-fund managers by introducing a flat fifteen-per-cent business and partnership tax. (The tax plan over all did not include specific ways to pay for the tax cuts, leading to an estimate that it would increase the federal deficit by $5.3 trillion over ten years.) Trump also vowed to renegotiate or cancel international trade deals, to repeal the Dodd-Frank financial-reform legislation implemented after the financial crisis, and to ban any new regulations.\nDuring his CNBC interview, Mnuchin presented a more measured view than some of what Trump had outlined, but also, in some ways, a more radical one. “Our No. 1 priority is tax reform,” he said. “This will be the largest tax change since Reagan. . . . We’re going to cut corporate taxes, which will bring huge amounts of jobs back to the United States.” He said that the Trump Administration would lower corporate taxes to fifteen per cent, from thirty-five per cent, which even the “Squawk Box” questioners found aggressive, and is lower than House Republicans have proposed . Mnuchin then promised again, without offering any detail, that cutting corporate taxes would create “huge economic growth.” He added that the Administration’s other priority would be having “a big middle-income tax cut,” with a vague promise that “the revenues will be offset on the other side.”\nMnuchin also insisted that “there will be no absolute tax cut for the upper class, but any tax cuts we have for the upper class will be offset by less deductions that pay for it.” Regarding how exactly that would happen, he was, again, vague. On the matter of Dodd-Frank, he suggested that the Administration would only get rid of whatever aspects are causing banks not to lend money.\n“Our job is to make sure the average American worker has wage increases and good jobs,” Mnuchin finally said. “That’s the priority of this Administration.”\nThe Trump Administration seems to be suggesting that a trickle-down policy of mostly corporate and high-earner tax cuts, along with, perhaps, the occasional personal negotiation to save some small number of jobs, as Trump and his Vice-President-elect Mike Pence pulled off with the Carrier plant in Indiana, will produce enough well-paying jobs to satisfy those voters who saw Trump as bringing hope to depressed areas of the country. The proposals seem to suggest that companies will automatically convert tax breaks into jobs in the United States, and not be influenced by lower costs abroad or other large economic forces.\nRoss, who is a so-called vulture investor, made his career as an owner of mills and mines, and he offered the most insightful comment of anyone during the CNBC interview. It’s not true that “all jobs are created equal,” Ross said. “A guy who used to work in a steel mill now flipping hamburgers, he knows it’s not the same. So it’s the quality of jobs as well as the quantity, and one of the problems with the recovery is when the newly created jobs are not nearly as remunerative as the jobs that were lost.” He paused for a moment before stating more of the obvious: “That’s a structural problem.”",

      "title": "Payrolls Preview: Unemployment Rate Expected To Drop (But Blame The Weather & Calendar If Not) | Gold and Precious Metals",
      "text": "(Before It's News)\nA series of stronger than expected data in recent days pushed Goldman Sachs to up their payrolls growth expectation to 200k (above the 180k expectations), but they note that while the unemployment rate is likely to drop (to 4.8%), average hourly earnings may disappoint. Of course, they add, any non-narrative-confirming misses on the data can likely be explained away by “weather effects and residual seasonality.”\nAs Goldman details, we forecast that nonfarm payroll growth increased to 200k in November, after an increase of 161k in October. We have revised up our forecast from 180k previously reflecting stronger data this week. Labor market indicators were stronger on balance last month, including improvements in reported job availability, the ADP report, and the employment components of service-sector surveys. In addition, we see a likely boost from positive weather effects and possible residual seasonality.\nArguing for a stronger report:\nJob availability. The Conference Board labor differential—the difference between the percent of respondents saying jobs are plentiful and those saying jobs are hard to get—rose to +5.2, reversing a small decline in October. This measure has risen by about ten points over the last year.\nService sector surveys. The employment components of service sector surveys mostly improved in November. The Richmond Fed (+7pt to +13), Dallas Fed (+6.5pt to +9. 2), and New York Fed (+2.2pt to +10.9, after our seasonal adjustment) measures of service sector employment all strengthened. The Philly Fed non-manufacturing employment index edged down (-0.7pt to +15.6) but remains at levels consistent with expansion. Service sector employment increased 142k in October and has increased 161k on average over the last six months.\nADP. The payroll processing firm ADP reported a 216k gain in private payroll employment in November, up from a downwardly revised 119k increase in October. While this is a significant beat, the new methodology ADP introduced last month creates some additional uncertainty around the translation of this upside ADP surprise into the outlook for tomorrow’s nonfarm payroll report.\nSome rebound from Hurricane-related weakness. In October, employment in the three sectors that we find are most sensitive to weather-related swings – retail, construction, and leisure and hospitality – increased by 20k, which is a smaller gain than the 6-month (33k) and 12-month (73k) average changes through September. Among East Coast states, employment in these sectors declined by a total of 16k in October, relative to an average monthly increase of 15k over the prior six months (Exhibit 1). Some of the biggest declines were in Florida and South Carolina, the states most impacted by Hurricane Matthew.\nSeasonals. Since the recession, November payroll growth has surprised consensus expectations roughly 2/3 of the time, with an average surprise of +27k.\nExhibit 1: Some Potential Upside from East Coast States Impacted by Hurricane-related Weakness\nSource: Department of Labor, Goldman Sachs Global Investment Research\nNeutral Factors:\nTemporary election-related hiring . Election-related hiring typically shows up to some degree in the government and marketing research and opinion polling categories in the non-seasonally adjusted payroll data. However, the BLS makes a special adjustment to these changes to remove the effects of the election and in prior election years those categories did not spike on a seasonally adjusted basis in November. Therefore, it is unlikely we will see any direct election effect in the seasonally adjusted series.\nJobless claims: Initial claims for unemployment insurance benefits moved slightly higher, with the four-week moving average edging up to 253k in the November survey week. Initial claims were affected by technical factors including temporary auto plant shutdowns and weather-related effects from Hurricane Matthew, but we do not detect a significant change in the underlying trend which continues to show low layoff activity in the economy.\nJob cuts : Announced layoffs reported by Challenger, Gray & Christmas after our seasonal adjustment increased by 4k to 32k in November, but remain close to cycle-lows.\nArguing for a weaker report:\nOnline job ads. The Conference Board’s Help Wanted Online (HWOL) report reversed last month’s gains, and stands 15% lower than levels last year. However, we put limited weight on this indicator at the moment in light of research by Fed economists that argued that the HWOL ad count has been depressed by higher prices for online job ads.\nManufacturing sector surveys. The employment components of manufacturing surveys were mixed in November. The ISM manufacturing (-0.6pt to 52.3), Chicago PMI, Empire State (-6.2pt to -10.9), and Kansas City Fed (-6pt to +1) employment indexes all declined, while the Dallas Fed (+4.3pt to +4.5), Richmond Fed (+2pt to +5), and Philly Fed (+1.4pt to -2.4) measures edged up. Manufacturing employment declined by 9k in the October report, and has declined by 7k on average over the last six months.\nWe expect the unemployment rate to edge down to 4.8% in the November report from an unrounded 4.876% in October. Last month, the household survey showed a 43k decline in employment but the unemployment rate edged down to 4.9% due to a decline in labor force participation. The broader U6 unemployment rate dropped to a new post-crisis low of 9.5% as the number of involuntary part-time and marginally attached workers both declined.\nWe expect average hourly earnings to increase 0.1% month-over-month, or 2.7% from a year ago, after rising to a new cycle high of 2.8% year-on-year in October. A modest retracement of last month’s gains and negative calendar effects are likely to contribute to a softer number. Our wage tracker, which captures the broader trend in wage growth across four major indicators, stands at 2.6% year-over-year as of Q3.\n* * *\nFinally, we look forward to seeing The White House spokesperson basking in the afterglow of their track record compared to president-elect Trump's likely tweeted response.",

      "text": "By Shuli Ren Investors in Asia have been moving away from growth stocks and into value stocks since summer, and Donald Trump ‘s surprise win has only quickened the pace of the rotation. Asia’s growth stocks tumbled today after the Nasdaq fell 1.4% overnight, a reminder that growth stocks are out of favor.\nSo why are growth stocks deflating?\nIn their 2017 China outlook, Goldman Sachs ‘ Kinger Lau and team explain:\nChina’s growth stocks are still very expensive compared to value stocks Goldman Sachs Owning New China stocks has been a rewarding strategy for the past few years, with New China outperforming Old China by 160% and 85% in the past 5 years in the offshore and A-share market. (See chart)\nWhile we stay broadly constructive about the fundamental growth trajectory and potential for New China stocks, we are less confident about the growth premiums that they could command in a reflationary environment, especially when relative valuation between New and Old China is now close to the high end of their respective ranges in both PE (179%) and PEG (16%) terms, and growth momentum for New China is gradually normalizing from a high-growth phase.\nIn particular, our top-down framework suggests that New China equities have tended to outperform and sustain high valuation premiums (vs. Old China) when growth weakens and domestic/global financial conditions are easy , and vice versa. Furthermore, our macro forecasts also imply around 10% absolute valuation and relative premium compression risk for New China.\nGlobal financial conditions have become less easy. The benchmark 10-year US bond yields rose to 2.439% overnight, the highest close since July 2015. Meanwhile, Trump is talking up reflation and China will go through a major power transition next year, so Beijing will approve enough infrastructure projects to ensure its targeted 6.5% growth.\nIn a rising rate and inflationary environment , energy and consumer staples tend to perform the best.\nGoldman screened out 10 stocks that may benefit from the reflation trade: construction and engineering firms CMEC (1829.Hong Kong), Singyes Solar (760.Hong Kong), CCCC (1800.Hong Kong), Lonking (3339.Hong Kong) and CSCI (3311.Hong Kong), oil companies Sinopec Kantons (934.Hong Kong) and PetroChina (857.Hong Kong/PTR), consumer staples WH Group (288.Hong Kong), China Resources Beer (291.Hong Kong) and Mengniu Dairy (2319.Hong Kong).\nOvernight, Alibaba Group (BABA) tumbled 4.4%, Baidu (BIDU) dropped 2.3% and NetEase (NTES) fell 2.8%. This morning, Geely Auto (175.Hong Kong) fell 4.3% and Tencent (700.Hong Kong) dropped 2.1%.",

      "text": "By Shuli Ren Investors in Asia have been moving away from growth stocks and into value stocks since summer, and Donald Trump ‘s surprise win has only quickened the pace of the rotation. Asia’s growth stocks tumbled today after the Nasdaq fell 1.4% overnight, a reminder that growth stocks are out of favor.\nSo why are growth stocks deflating?\nIn their 2017 China outlook, Goldman Sachs ‘ Kinger Lau and team explain:\nChina’s growth stocks are still very expensive compared to value stocks Goldman Sachs Owning New China stocks has been a rewarding strategy for the past few years, with New China outperforming Old China by 160% and 85% in the past 5 years in the offshore and A-share market. (See chart) \nWhile we stay broadly constructive about the fundamental growth trajectory and potential for New China stocks, we are less confident about the growth premiums that they could command in a reflationary environment, especially when relative valuation between New and Old China is now close to the high end of their respective ranges in both PE (179%) and PEG (16%) terms, and growth momentum for New China is gradually normalizing from a high-growth phase.\nIn particular, our top-down framework suggests that New China equities have tended to outperform and sustain high valuation premiums (vs. Old China) when growth weakens and domestic/global financial conditions are easy , and vice versa. Furthermore, our macro forecasts also imply around 10% absolute valuation and relative premium compression risk for New China.\nGlobal financial conditions have become less easy. The benchmark 10-year US bond yields rose to 2.439% overnight, the highest close since July 2015. Meanwhile, Trump is talking up reflation and China will go through a major power transition next year, so Beijing will approve enough infrastructure projects to ensure its targeted 6.5% growth.\nIn a rising rate and inflationary environment , energy and consumer staples tend to perform the best. \nGoldman screened out 10 stocks that may benefit from the reflation trade: construction and engineering firms CMEC (1829.Hong Kong), Singyes Solar (760.Hong Kong), CCCC (1800.Hong Kong), Lonking (3339.Hong Kong) and CSCI (3311.Hong Kong), oil companies Sinopec Kantons (934.Hong Kong) and PetroChina (857.Hong Kong/PTR), consumer staples WH Group (288.Hong Kong), China Resources Beer (291.Hong Kong) and Mengniu Dairy (2319.Hong Kong).\nOvernight, Alibaba Group (BABA) tumbled 4.4%, Baidu (BIDU) dropped 2.3% and NetEase (NTES) fell 2.8%. This morning, Geely Auto (175.Hong Kong) fell 4.3% and Tencent (700.Hong Kong) dropped 2.1%.",

      "text": "Steve Bannon Says Joining Goldman Sachs Is Like ‘Joining The Jesuits’   Source: Shadowproof \nDuring his campaign, President-elect Donald Trump condemned lobbyists, Wall Street, and DC insiders, claiming he would “drain the swamp” and bring reform to Washington if elected. \nNo company epitomizes the incestuous swampy relationship between Washington and Wall Street like Goldman Sachs. Nicknamed Government Sachs , it has already produced two former US treasury secretaries—Hank Paulson and Robert Rubin—and a large number of the federal regulators tasked with policing the financial services industry. \nGoldman Sachs, like the other Too Big To Fail/Jail banks on Wall Street, has been at the forefront of pushing corporations to ship American jobs oversees and played a leading role in crashing the US economy in 2008 through reckless greed and criminal fraud in the mortgage securities market. \nYet Trump is backing two former Goldman executives for high positions within his administration. Trump has chosen second-generation Goldman Sachs executive Steve Mnuchin to be his treasury secretary. Mnuchin’s father was a Goldman partner and Mnuchin himself worked at Goldman for 17 years. \nSteve Bannon, who is also a former Goldman Sachs executive, is set to be President Trump’s chief adviser. Despite Bannon’s embrace of economic nationalism in a recent interview with The Hollywood Reporter, Bannon was singing the praises of Goldman Sachs as recently as 2012. \nIn an interview for a French news documentary, “Goldman Sachs: The Bank That Runs The World,” Bannon compared joining the Wall Street bank to joining the Roman Catholic religious order of the Jesuits: \nINTERVIEWER: What did Goldman Sachs represent for you? \nSTEVE BANNON: Goldman Sachs represented excellence and meritocracy. It didn’t matter where you came from, it didn’t matter what school you went to, what your religion was or what was your ethnicity. It just mattered how hard you worked, how smart you were, and how good a banker you were for your clients. \nIt was really like joining the Jesuits . This seems antiquated today, it was before the financialization, it was before all these quants and mathematicians really came to Wall Street. \nThe Jesuits? Really? Because a brief look at Goldman Sachs’ rap sheet would lead one to think the bank has specialized in sin. They have incurred fines totaling in the billions with victims both large and small. \nIn his interview with The Hollywood Reporter, Bannon said, “The globalists gutted the American working class and created a middle class in Asia. The issue now is about Americans looking to not get f—ed over. If we deliver.” \nWho exactly did Bannon think he was praising in 2012? Goldman Sachs is one of the architects of neoliberal globalization, especially moving American factories to China and elsewhere in Asia. And, like other banks, Goldman has lobbied US companies to look for lower wages out of the country to boost profitability. \nGoldman Sachs is a case study in pursuing transnational, globalist interests at the expense of the American worker.

      "text": "Tweet Share FRANKFURT, Dec 2 (Reuters) - A junior banker at Goldman Sachs' Frankfurt office collapsed while working into the early hours, prompting management to ask staff to look after their health more seriously, people who attended the meeting said. The banker had come to the office despite feeling unwell to work on a deal and broke down at around 2.30 am local time, the people said. Goldman Sachs confirmed that a doctor was summoned because a junior staff member felt unwell. \"The health of our employees is a priority for us,\" a spokeswoman for Goldman Sachs said, adding staff were being trained regularly to act responsibly, including with their own health. She declined to give details on the incident involving the junior banker. In a profession known for its gruelling schedules, banks around the world are trying to lighten workloads to lower stress levels, especially among junior bankers. In 2013, a Bank of America Merrill Lynch intern died after allegedly working 72 hours without sleep. An inquest later ruled that he had died of natural causes, and BAML launched an internal review into working conditions for junior employees. At UBS, investment bankers can now take at least two hours of \"personal time\" a week in the latest attempt by a bank to retain staff with a better work-life balance.

      "text": "Goldman Sachs shares have been on a tear since last month's presidential election.\nThe stock has gained about 25%, and on Thursday hit its highest level since 2007 — or before the financial crisis. The shares were down about 1.3% to $223.66 as of about 11:00 am ET Friday. \nGoldman shares have also outperformed every other company on the Dow Jones Industrial Average since the election. Here's the stock compared with the whole index:\nMarketsInsider \nThe gains come as banks have rallied across the board. President-elect Donald Trump is expected to ease up on regulation of the banks, and his infrastructure spending plans and other policies could have an inflationary effect on the US economy which could lead to higher interest rates, which are good for bank profits in general. \n\nBut analysts also point to specific factors working in Goldman's favor, including a \"better trading environment\" for the fixed income, currencies, and commodities — or FICC — business. \n\n\"GS should benefit more than peers given the company's reliance on trading results and the greater contribution from FICC revenues toward total revenues,\" KBW's Frederick Cannon, Brian Kleinhanzl, and Allyson Boyd wrote in a note Tuesday.\n\"In general, we are more confident in rising rates and better trading versus wide-sweeping regulatory changes, and we believe BAC and GS offer the best exposure to both at still reasonable valuations.\"\nMarketsInsider Deutsche Bank's Matt O'Connor upgraded Goldman Sachs to a \"buy\" rating, saying it seems well positioned to profit from a stronger economy. \n\"A stronger economy should benefit many capital market businesses — including advisory, equity capital markets, and both fixed and equity trading (all areas of strength at GS),\" he wrote in a recent note. \nHe also said he expects the firm's recent rollout of its consumer lending platform, Marcus, to build momentum.\nTrump on Wednesday appointed the former Goldman Sachs banker Steven Mnuchin Treasury secretary. Steve Bannon, Trump's incoming chief strategist, is also a Goldman Sachs alum.\nTrump is also reportedly considering Goldman Sachs President Gary Cohn  for his budget chief or another role in the administration.\nNOW WATCH: JAMES ALTUCHER: This is why owning a home is financial suicide \n",

      "text": "Days after news surfaced that President-elect Donald Trump is considering former Goldman Sachs executive Steven Mnuchin for Treasury secretary, Mnuchin says he is stepping down from Sears Holdings ' board of directors.\nThe move is effective immediately, and reduces Sears Holdings' directors to nine, according to a news release.\nMnuchin, who had never worked in politics, served as finance chairman for part of Trump's campaign and helped create Trump's proposal to overhaul the tax code.\nMnuchin and Sears Holdings CEO Edward Lampert were once roommates at Yale. Mnuchin cut his chops on Wall Street, at New York investment bank Goldman Sachs and then at his own private equity fund.\nMnuchin joined the board of Hoffman Estates-headquartered Sears Holdings Corp. in 2005, about the same time Sears, Roebuck & Co. was merging with Kmart Holding Corp. Before that, he served on Kmart's board of directors.\nHe's leaving after a rough couple of years for the embattled retailer. Sears and Kmart have seen stores close and shrink, falling sales and layoffs. Just last month, Sears announced it's cutting the size of its Oakbrook Center store in half by spring 2018. The company has plans to generate more cash from its well-known brands like Kenmore and Craftsman while lessening focus on other aspects that have seen a slump in sales.\n\"I wish the company and its associates all the best as Sears Holdings continues on its transformation,\" Mnuchin said in a statement.\namarotti@chicagotribune.com \nTwitter @AllyMarotti \n  Sears Holdings Corp.

      "text": "Increase size \nNews reports this week have President-elect Donald Trump considering Goldman Sachs president Gary Cohn to head the Office of Management and Budget. \nUnclear from Cohn’s Wall Street background is whether he would meet basic criteria that two past and prominent budget directors laid out at a Thursday lunch talk put on by the nonprofit Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. \nThe crusading anti-federal-debt group showcased its three co-chairs: former Rep. Tim Penny, D-Minn.; former Clinton administration budget director Leon Panetta (who also chaired the House Budget Committee long before serving in the Obama Cabinet); and former Indiana Republican Gov. Mitch Daniels, budget director under President George W. Bush and now president of Purdue University. \nAll expressed disappointment that the national debt and rising budget deficit were not discussed more in the presidential campaign, and all acknowledged that little is known about Trump’s fiscal leanings—indeed, the coming new administration, Daniels said, “is still finding out about itself.” \nBut all agreed that significant action to assure a fiscally healthy government for future generations will require the new president, not just the hydra-headed Congress, to make living within the government’s means a priority. \nAsked what traits Trump should look for in a good budget director, Panetta said, “It helps if it’s one son-of-a-bitch, who knows the numbers and the budget and the implications.” He added that “most president’s don’t know” those details. “It also helps to have a good relationship with the president,” and to be trusted, he said. \nDaniels said the budget director needs to ask, “What are the limits of my authority?” He or she can “either be a hammer, addressing 10 problems a day so the president doesn’t have to,\" or more of “a mechanic, a cipher,” Daniels said. He added that the budget chief “needs others in the Cabinet to think, 'there’s no sense in messing with Panetta-- he speaks for the president.’ ” \nThe three ex-officials spoke after releasing a memorandum to Trump titled “ Governing Through Leadership, ” which outlines 10 basic steps for tackling the hairy and scary issues of discretionary spending, taxes and entitlement issues. \nOne recommendation of concern to agencies: “In your first 100 days, you should instruct each federal agency to send you a list of programs, policies or rules that they view as wasteful, low-priority, duplicative, obsolete, inefficient, or damaging to economic growth. And then you should work to eliminate, consolidate, or reform these areas of government.” Trump made a pledge to reduce government waste during the campaign. \n» Get the best federal news and ideas delivered right to your inbox.

      "text": "A series of *stronger than expected data in recent days* pushed Goldman Sachs to up their payrolls growth expectation to 200k (above the 180k expectations), but they note that while the unemployment rate is likely to drop (to 4.8%), *average hourly earnings may disappoint.* Of course, they add, any non-narrative-confirming misses on the data can likely be explained away by *\"weather effects and residual seasonality.\"*\n\nAs Goldman details, we forecast that nonfarm payroll growth increased to 200k in November, after an increase of 161k in October. We have revised up our forecast from 180k previously reflecting stronger data this week. Labor market indicators were stronger on balance last month, including improvements in reported job availability, the ADP report, and the employment components of service-sector surveys. *In addition, we see a likely boost from positive weather effects and possible residual seasonality.*\n\n*Arguing for a stronger report:*\n\n\n\n*Job availability.* The Conference Board labor differential—the difference between the percent of respondents saying jobs are plentiful and those saying jobs are hard to get—rose to +5.2, reversing a small decline in October. This measure has risen by about ten points over the last year.\n\n\n*Service sector surveys. *The employment components of service sector surveys mostly improved in November. The Richmond Fed (+7pt to +13), Dallas Fed (+6.5pt to +9.2), and New York Fed (+2.2pt to +10.9, after our seasonal adjustment) measures of service sector employment all strengthened. The Philly Fed non-manufacturing employment index edged down (-0.7pt to +15.6) but remains at levels consistent with expansion. Service sector employment increased 142k in October and has increased 161k on average over the last six months.\n\n\n*ADP.* The payroll processing firm ADP reported a 216k gain in private payroll employment in November, up from a downwardly revised 119k increase in October. While this is a significant beat, the new methodology ADP introduced last month creates some additional uncertainty around the translation of this upside ADP surprise into the outlook for tomorrow’s nonfarm payroll report.\n\n\n*Some rebound from Hurricane-related weakness. *In October, employment in the three sectors that we find are most sensitive to weather-related swings – retail, construction , and leisure and hospitality – increased by 20k, which is a smaller gain than the 6-month (33k) and 12-month (73k) average changes through September. Among East Coast states, employment in these sectors declined by a total of 16k in October, relative to an average monthly increase of 15k over the prior six months (Exhibit 1). Some of the biggest declines were in Florida and South Carolina, the states most impacted by Hurricane Matthew.\n\n\n*Seasonals.* Since the recession, November payroll growth has surprised consensus expectations roughly 2/3 of the time, with an average surprise of +27k.\n\n\nExhibit 1: Some Potential Upside from East Coast States Impacted by Hurricane-related Weakness\n\nSource: Department of Labor, Goldman Sachs Global Investment Research\n\n\n\n*Neutral Factors:*\n\n\n\n*Temporary election-related hiring*. Election-related hiring typically shows up to some degree in the government and marketing research and opinion polling categories in the non-seasonally adjusted payroll data. However, the BLS makes a special adjustment to these changes to remove the effects of the election and in prior election years those categories did not spike on a seasonally adjusted basis in November. Therefore, it is unlikely we will see any direct election effect in the seasonally adjusted series.\n\n\n*Jobless claims:* Initial claims for unemployment insurance benefits moved slightly higher, with the four-week moving average edging up to 253k in the November survey week. Initial claims were affected by technical factors including temporary auto plant shutdowns and weather-related effects from Hurricane Matthew, but we do not detect a significant change in the underlying trend which continues to show low layoff activity in the economy.\n\n\n*Job cuts*: Announced layoffs reported by Challenger, Gray & Christmas after our seasonal adjustment increased by 4k to 32k in November, but remain close to cycle-lows.\n\n\n\n*Arguing for a weaker report:*\n\n\n\n*Online job ads. *The Conference Board’s Help Wanted Online (HWOL) report reversed last month’s gains, and stands 15% lower than levels last year. However, we put limited weight on this indicator at the moment in light of research by Fed economists that argued that the HWOL ad count has been depressed by higher prices for online job ads.\n\n\n*Manufacturing sector surveys. *The employment components of manufacturing surveys were mixed in November. The ISM manufacturing (-0.6pt to 52.3), Chicago PMI, Empire State (-6.2pt to -10.9), and Kansas City Fed (-6pt to +1) employment indexes all declined, while the Dallas Fed (+4.3pt to +4.5), Richmond Fed (+2pt to +5), and Philly Fed (+1.4pt to -2.4) measures edged up. Manufacturing employment declined by 9k in the October report, and has declined by 7k on average over the last six months.\n\n\n\n*We expect the unemployment rate to edge down to 4.8% in the November report *from an unrounded 4.876% in October. Last month, the household survey showed a 43k decline in employment but the unemployment rate edged down to 4.9% due to a decline in labor force participation. The broader U6 unemployment rate dropped to a new post-crisis low of 9.5% as the number of involuntary part-time and marginally attached workers both declined.\n\nWe expect average hourly earnings to increase 0.1% month-over-month, or 2.7% from a year ago, after rising to a new cycle high of 2.8% year-on-year in October.* A modest retracement of last month’s gains and negative calendar effects are likely to contribute to a softer number.* Our wage tracker, which captures the broader trend in wage growth across four major indicators, stands at 2.6% year-over-year as of Q3.\n\n* * *\n\nFinally, we look forward to seeing The White House spokesperson basking in the afterglow of their track record compared to president-elect Trump's likely tweeted response.",

      "text": "Source: Thinkstock December 2, 2016: Markets opened mixed Friday as the blue chips that have been rising steadily showed some weakness. Among S&P’s 11 sectors, real-estate posted the largest gain and financials posted the largest loss. The unemployment rate fell to 4.6% in November and the economy added 178,000 jobs. These were better than expected results, but the jobs growth was pretty anemic. WTI crude oil for January delivery settled at $51.68 a barrel, up 1.2% on the day and up 12% for the week. February gold added 0.7% on the day to settle at $1,177.80, with the most- active contract down 0.1% for the week. Equities were headed for a mixed close before the bell as the DJIA traded down 0.09% for the day, the S&P 500 traded up 0.06%, and the Nasdaq Composite traded up 0.09%. Stocks were trading very near the break even line and the closing bell might see some shifts in which side of the line the indexes close on.\nThe DJIA stock posting the largest daily percentage loss ahead of the close Friday was The Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (NYSE: GS) which traded down 1.48% at $223.27. The stock’s 52-week range is $138.20 to $227.16, a new 52-week high posted Thursday. Volume was about 25% above the daily average of around 3.3 million shares. The investment bank had no specific news again Friday, but some profit taking probably factored into the share price drop.\nCaterpillar Inc. (NYSE: CAT) traded down 1.03% at $95.25. The stock’s 52-week range is $56.36 to $97.39. Volume was about 20% lower than the daily average of around 5.2 million shares. The industrial giant said late Thursday that analysts were being too optimistic with their fourth-quarter earnings projections.\nAmerican Express Co. (NYSE: AXP) traded down 0.92% at $71.86. The stock’s 52-week range is $50.27 to $73.18. Trading volume was about half the daily average of around 5 million. The credit card issuer had no specific news Friday.\nE. I. du Pont de Nemours and Co. (NYSE: DD) traded down 0.71% at $73.10. The stock’s 52-week range is $50.71 to $75.72. Volume was about 20% below the daily average of around 2.9 million shares. The company had no specific news Friday.\nOf the Dow 30 stocks 14 are on track to close higher Friday and 16 are set to close lower.\nI'm interested in the Newsletter Get Newsletter \nterms and conditions   ",
