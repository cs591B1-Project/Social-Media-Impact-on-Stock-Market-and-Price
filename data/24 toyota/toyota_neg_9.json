      "text": "Target: James Lentz, CEO of Toyota \nGoal: Stop Toyota from using leather in its vehicles. \nAnimal rights organization PETA recently released videos of severe animal cruelty allegedly taking place on ranches that supply leather for Toyota. The videos show cows, bulls and calves being beaten, dragged, shocked and branded on the face. \nCalves were seen being dragged away from their mothers, branded on the face and forced into compact areas where they would often panic. The cattle were kept on the ranch until about 3 years old and it was clear the animals were severely neglected. Cows were seen with large, open wounds infested with maggots. At 3, the cows and bulls have their throats slit and are then skinned. \nSign this petition to demand Toyota make the compassionate change and start using vegan leather. Animals should not be tortured and killed for a car. \nPETITION LETTER: \nDear Mr. Lentz, \nRecently, animal rights organization PETA released footage of some of the cattle ranches where the leather for your cars is allegedly produced. The footage was shocking and difficult to watch. \nCows, bulls and calves were seen being beaten, dragged, shocked and branded all without the use of any painkillers. Large, open wounds were a common sight among the animals and some even had maggots crawling on them. After about three years of pain and misery, the animals have their throats slit and are then skinned. \nPlease consider using a vegan leather which would spare countless animals from unnecessary pain and death. The alternative materials are available and it is time to start utilizing them. \nSincerely,",

      "text": " Toyota Motor Sales, U.S.A. , Inc.\nNational Education Program from Cincinnati Children's and Toyota Helps Protect Children during the Holidays and Beyond\nCINCINNATI , Nov. 21, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- It's that time of year again when millions of Americans will hit the road to travel near and far to be with friends and family. AAA predicts that 43.5 million Americans will travel by car this Thanksgiving season. 1\nThe startling truth, however, is that 75 percent of car seats in the U.S. are not used correctly. 2 That's why Buckle Up for Life , the national car seat education program from Cincinnati Children's and Toyota, is releasing its top tips for the Thanksgiving travel season.\n\"The holidays are a reminder to be thankful for all that we have – and for so many of us this includes the children in our lives,\" said Gloria Del Castillo , child passenger safety expert at Cincinnati Children's and senior outreach specialist for Buckle Up for Life . \"We want every parent and caregiver to have the knowledge and resources they need to help keep child passengers safe during this special time of year and beyond. These tips from Buckle Up for Life may seem simple, but they could save a child's life in the event of a crash.\"\nBuckle Up for Life 's Must-Know Thanksgiving Travel Tips\nThe following tips, as well as additional advice and guidance, including animated car seat installation videos, can be found on BuckleUpforLife.org.\nUse the \"Inch and Pinch\" Test . After you've buckled your child in, pinch the car seat strap near their shoulders. If you can pinch a wrinkle in the fabric, tighten the strap until it is snug. Then grab the car seat at the bottom where it is attached to the car and tug from side to side and front to back. If the seat moves more than an inch in either direction, tighten it. Secure Holiday \"Extras\" in the Car . Make sure that all gifts, luggage and other holiday \"extras\" are tightly secured in your vehicle. These objects could become projectiles in the event of a crash. Ensure Your Child's Seat Faces the Correct Way . Some parents and caregivers may wonder when it's safe to turn the car seat around to face forward. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that children remain in rear-facing car seats until age two , or until they exceed the height or weight limit for the seat. Remove Your Child's Winter Coat. Before securing your child in their seat, remove their winter coat. A coat can prevent the harness from fitting correctly. It also could compress in a crash, compromising the seat's ability to protect your child. Don't Rent a Car Seat. Traveling by plane? If you are renting a car, use your own car seat. When you rent a seat you don't know important facts about its history that could affect its ability to protect your child (e.g., expiration date, crash history, etc.) The good news is that many airlines allow you to check your car seat for free. About Buckle Up for Life\nBuckle Up for Life is a national injury prevention program for families, created by Toyota and Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center in 2004, to help keep child passengers safe. The program partners with leading children's hospitals, community organizations, local governments, schools and non-profit organizations to teach parents and children about the proper use of car seats and seat belts and to provide free car seats to families in need. Buckle Up for Life has reached more than 45,000 people nationwide and has partnerships in 17 cities including New York , Dallas , Memphis , Phoenix , Chicago , Cincinnati , Houston , Las Vegas , Los Angeles , Philadelphia , Orange County , and San Antonio – and expands to new partners each year. In one city alone, the program nearly tripled the use of proper car seats in participating families. Toyota has provided funding for over 40,000 car seats for families in need. For more information about Buckle Up for Life , please visit www.buckleupforlife.org .\nAbout Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center\nCincinnati Children's, a non-profit, pediatric, academic medical center established in 1883, is internationally recognized for improving child health and transforming delivery of care through fully integrated, globally recognized research, education and innovation.

      "text": " Toyota Motor Sales, U.S.A. , Inc.\nNational Education Program from Cincinnati Children's and Toyota Helps Protect Children during the Holidays and Beyond\nCINCINNATI , Nov. 21, It's that time of year again when millions of Americans will hit the road to travel near and far to be with friends and family. AAA predicts that 43.5 million Americans will travel by car this Thanksgiving season. 1\nThe startling truth, however, is that 75 percent of car seats in the U.S. are not used correctly. 2 That's why Buckle Up for Life , the national car seat education program from Cincinnati Children's and Toyota, is releasing its top tips for the Thanksgiving travel season.\n\"The holidays are a reminder to be thankful for all that we have – and for so many of us this includes the children in our lives,\" said Gloria Del Castillo , child passenger safety expert at Cincinnati Children's and senior outreach specialist for Buckle Up for Life . \"We want every parent and caregiver to have the knowledge and resources they need to help keep child passengers safe during this special time of year and beyond. These tips from Buckle Up for Life may seem simple, but they could save a child's life in the event of a crash.\"\nBuckle Up for Life 's Must-Know Thanksgiving Travel Tips\nThe following tips, as well as additional advice and guidance, including animated car seat installation videos, can be found on BuckleUpforLife.org.\nUse the \"Inch and Pinch\" Test . After you've buckled your child in, pinch the car seat strap near their shoulders. If you can pinch a wrinkle in the fabric, tighten the strap until it is snug. Then grab the car seat at the bottom where it is attached to the car and tug from side to side and front to back. If the seat moves more than an inch in either direction, tighten it. Secure Holiday \"Extras\" in the Car . Make sure that all gifts, luggage and other holiday \"extras\" are tightly secured in your vehicle. These objects could become projectiles in the event of a crash. Ensure Your Child's Seat Faces the Correct Way . Some parents and caregivers may wonder when it's safe to turn the car seat around to face forward. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that children remain in rear-facing car seats until age two , or until they exceed the height or weight limit for the seat. Remove Your Child's Winter Coat. Before securing your child in their seat, remove their winter coat. A coat can prevent the harness from fitting correctly. It also could compress in a crash, compromising the seat's ability to protect your child. Don't Rent a Car Seat. Traveling by plane? If you are renting a car, use your own car seat. When you rent a seat you don't know important facts about its history that could affect its ability to protect your child (e.g., expiration date, crash history, etc.) The good news is that many airlines allow you to check your car seat for free. About Buckle Up for Life\nBuckle Up for Life is a national injury prevention program for families, created by Toyota and Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center in 2004, to help keep child passengers safe. The program partners with leading children's hospitals, community organizations, local governments, schools and non-profit organizations to teach parents and children about the proper use of car seats and seat belts and to provide free car seats to families in need. Buckle Up for Life has reached more than 45,000 people nationwide and has partnerships in 17 cities including New York , Dallas , Memphis , Phoenix , Chicago , Cincinnati , Houston , Las Vegas , Los Angeles , Philadelphia , Orange County , and San Antonio – and expands to new partners each year. In one city alone, the program nearly tripled the use of proper car seats in participating families. Toyota has provided funding for over 40,000 car seats for families in need.

      "text": "Toyota frame rust settlement could cost the company $3.4 billion Replacing rusty frames is an expensive, time consuming and labor intensive job \nNovember 21, 2016 Pinterest Email \nAs many as 225,000 steel frames under Toyota Tacoma and Tundra pickups and Sequoia SUVs may need to be replaced, says a lawyer who helped settle a class-action lawsuit against Toyota over the frames' potential for rusting. \nThe repair is an expensive, labor-intensive process that requires nearly the complete disassembly of the vehicle. \nThe proposed legal settlement could cost Toyota as much as $3.4 billion for the repairs, according to court documents. \nSeveral time-lapse videos on youtube.com show the job requiring as many as four technicians and two service bays. The repair can take from almost two days to a week, depending on a dealer's ability to put more than one technician on the job. \nAbout 1.5 million vehicles are covered under terms of the proposed settlement, which includes 2005-10 Tacoma midsize pickups, 2007-08 Tundra full-size pickups and 2005-08 Sequoia large SUVs. Vehicles are covered up to 12 years from the day of sale. \nThe frames, which lack adequate rustproofing, were supplied by Dana Holding Corp. of Maumee, Ohio. Photos of rust-damaged frames show severe corrosion of the frame rails and the high-stress area where the rear suspension leaf springs mount to the frame. \nIf the frame is rusted to the point where its strength is compromised -- especially near the rear suspension mounts -- Toyota will pay for the dealer to install a replacement frame, according to the proposed settlement. \n\"The ultimate size of the settlement depends on a number of factors, including the valuation of the benefits offered under the settlement. Plaintiffs' counsel will have to explain how they're reaching their valuation numbers,\" Toyota said in a statement. \"More important to us is that the agreement will deliver that value to our customers.\" 2017 Toyota Tacoma TRD Pro first drive: Midsize mud-bogging in Toyota's top-selling compact pickup \nQuick trivia question: What’s the best-selling vehicle in the state of Hawaii? Not the Honda Accord, Toyota Camry or even the Ford F-150; rather, it’s the midsize Toyota Tacoma pickup ... \nToyota officials declined to answer specific questions about frame replacements, such as how long customers will have to wait, or whether any of the body hardware, nuts, bolts and fasteners are included in the repair. \n\"Probably about 15 percent of the frames that get inspected will end up needing to be replaced,\" said Timothy Blood, co-counsel with Blood Hurst & O'Reardon in San Diego, one of three law firms in two states that successfully sued Toyota. \"There are a lot of steps to it. And it is labor-intensive,\" he said. \nReplacing rusty frames will be costly for Toyota. The frames come in a variety of sizes and models, based on vehicle cab and drivetrain configuration. \nThe Tacoma frame, for instance, has 11 versions, ranging in price from $4,338 to $4,889. But the labor for the repair could push the total warranty bill per vehicle to $15,000 or more, according to a Toyota dealer who has been replacing frames for several years and asked not to be named. \nStep by step \nToyota declines to discuss specifics, but YouTube videos show the repair process for frames that need to be replaced. \n1. Separate truck bed, cab and components from frame. 2. Remove engine, transmission and rear axle, front and rear suspension and steering system, exhaust system, fuel tank, and hydraulic and fuel lines. 3. Transfer all components to the new frame. 4. Reinstall the drivetrain. 5. Install the body and bed on the new frame. 6. Reconnect and refill brake, steering, cooling, air conditioning systems; reconnect electrical system. 7. Align the wheels.",

      "text": "Audi pace took Toyota by surprise in Bahrain finale 1,939 views By: Jamie Klein , News Editor 21/11/2016 03:34 Toyota Motorsport director Rob Leupen says Audi’s pace in the FIA WEC season finale at Bahrain took the Japanese team by surprise, as its slim hopes of taking the drivers’ title disappeared. \nThe #6 Toyota crew of Stephane Sarrazin, Mike Conway and Kamui Kobayashi arrived at the Sakhir track 17 points behind the #2 Porsche squad, and therefore in need of at least a second place finish to have any chance of taking the title. \nBut, both TS050 Hybrid cars struggled for pace in the six-hour event, eventually finishing fourth and fifth, while Neel Jani, Romain Dumas and Marc Lieb took the title with a sixth-place finish. \nSpeaking to Motorsport.com after the race, Leupen said the fact Audi had the speed to be able to take a one-two finish in the German marque’s farewell race came as a big shock to Toyota. \n\"It was a really disappointing race for us,” admitted Leupen. “We expected more. Audi was incredibly strong, we didn’t count on that. \n“This was a race where we thought we could have had a good chance to fight for victory but that it turned out that this wasn’t the case. \n“We actually expected that the Porsche #1 was the car that we needed to beat, but there were two others in front of us who put on quite a show. There was not more possible here. \n“We had some problems with the tyres, but the drivers did everything they can and the entire engineering team and mechanics did everything they can. But this was it.” Read Also: Audi drivers emotional after taking farewell victory \nSpeaking on Sunday, Sarrazin said the fact Toyota couldn’t at least maintain its streak of podium finishes was a big source of disappointment, even if snatching the title from Porsche was a long shot. \n“The problem was the balance in general,” the Frenchman told Motorsport.com. “We never generated good grip, we were not as fast as Audi. We did our best, but it was difficult. \n“After all the last races where we were very fast, here we expected a high level of performance. Clearly we were not on the pace of the Audi, and not on the pace of the Porsche. \n“It’s a shame we didn’t fight for the podium in the last one, we did so many podiums this season. This has been my best season at Toyota for sure.” \nSarrazin is understood to be making way for three-time WTCC champion Jose Maria Lopez next season in what is otherwise set to be an unchanged full-time line-up for Toyota in 2017.

Photo by LAT PHOTOGRAPHIC Toyota wins first NASCAR Sprint Cup Series Manufacturers' Championship Manufacturer snaps Chevrolet's 13-year winning streak in the category \nNovember 21, 2016 Pinterest Email \nToyota won its first NASCAR Sprint Cup Series Manufacturers' Championship with a sixth-place finish by Kyle Busch at Homestead-Miami Speedway on Sunday. \nThe title was the first for Toyota in its 10 years of Sprint Cup racing, and it snapped Chevrolet's run of 13 consecutive Manufacturers' Championships. \nToyota also won the Xfinity and Truck Series Manufacturers' Championships. \nToyota totalled 1,477 points, while Chevrolet was second with 1,452 and Ford third with 1,388. Ford last won the Manufacturers' Championship in 2002. \n“Capturing our first Cup Series manufacturer’s title is a tremendous accomplishment, and one that has been a goal for Toyota since entering the series 10 years ago as underdogs in this ultra-competitive series,” said Ed Laukes, vice president of Integrated Marketing Operations for Toyota Motor Sales (TMS), U.S.A. “With the partnership of great teams like Joe Gibbs Racing and Furniture Row Racing, Toyota has been able to breakthrough and become the first different manufacturer to earn this championship in 13 seasons. \n\"Toyota has now won Manufacturers' Championships in all three NASCAR national touring series, and to have reached this amazing milestone really speaks to Toyota’s commitment to not only NASCAR, but also to motorsports endeavors around the globe. We’re proud of the effort put forth by each of our Toyota teams, and all of the Toyota team members that have allowed us to reach this goal.” \nFive Camry drivers collected 16 Cup wins over 36 races during the 2016 season, including 12 wins by Joe Gibbs Racing and four by Furniture Row Racing. Busch and Martin Truex Jr. led the group with four wins a piece, while Carl Edwards (three victories), Denny Hamlin (two), and Matt Kenseth (two) also recorded triumphs in 2016. \nIn addition to securing the 2016 Cup Series Manufacturer’s Championship, Toyota claimed the NASCAR Camping World Truck Series Manufacturer’s Championship at Phoenix International Raceway and the NASCAR Xfinity Series Manufacturers' Championship at Homestead. Toyota drivers also won multiple championships across the NASCAR national touring series, with Daniel Suarez winning the Drivers' Championship in the Xfinity Series and Kyle Busch Motorsports taking the owner’s title in the Camping World Truck Series. \nToyota first entered the Cup Series in 2007. Toyota has won 95 races and captured 90 poles in 360 races. \nBy Autoweek Staff",

      "text": "Toyota and Evergreen partnership brings outdoor learning to life on over 6,000 Canadian school grounds Canada NewsWire\nTORONTO, Nov. 21, 2016\nSince 2000 this innovative program has helped connect 1.2 million students to nature\nTORONTO , Nov. 21, 2016 /CNW/ - One of Evergreen's longest standing partnerships and largest educational initiatives, the Toyota Evergreen Learning Grounds (TELG) program continues to help Canadian students and teachers transform their school grounds into healthy places to learn, play and connect with nature. This year, the national program led by Evergreen with support from Toyota Canada and its dealerships, helped 559 schools with their efforts to green their outdoor spaces, engaging 48,245 students and staff.\nThe TELG program is at the forefront of the school ground greening movement. Since 2000, the partnership has provided millions of dollars of support through hands-on expertise, training, publications and grants to over 6,000 schools across Canada , reaching close to 1.2 million elementary and secondary school students and 96,000 teachers and school staff. The scope of the TELG's impact inspired Evergreen to cofound the International School Ground Alliance in 2011.\nGreen school grounds aim to inspire discovery and learning, increase physical activity, motivate teachers and students, and support environmental awareness and stewardship.\nEach project offers a unique opportunity for schools to engage with the greater community, including the active support role many Toyota dealerships have played in their local service areas.\n\"Through this innovative long-standing initiative, students and staff each year have access to expert hands-on environmental learning and the unique opportunity to design and create their school's new outdoor space,\" says Geoff Cape , Evergreen CEO. \"Toyota's incredible commitment to this work continues to encourage a life-long passion for play and learning in nature that builds a caring relationship with the natural world – a foundation for building sustainable and flourishing cities.\"\n\"Toyota's commitment to enriching communities and establishing a future society in harmony with nature is at the core of our collaboration with Evergreen,\" says Larry Hutchinson , President and CEO, Toyota Canada Inc. \"Toyota Canada is proud of the impact the Toyota Evergreen Learning Grounds program has had over the past 16 years, providing everyday opportunities for students to engage with nature on Canada's school grounds.\"\nThis year, for its 25 th anniversary, Evergreen launched the Evergreen City Builders Awards and partnered with Toyota to recognize outstanding innovation in children's nature playgrounds with the Toyota Playground Placemaker Award. The award recipient, Sandy Clee , Senior Planner at the Simcoe County District School Board in Midhurst, Ontario supported the transformation of 87 early year schoolyards from barren outdoor expanses to dynamic natural play and learning spaces.\nSchools participating in the 2015-2016 TELG program have realized their greening goals with a wide variety of outdoor improvements such as a year-round outdoor classroom in North Vancouver , a food and pollinator garden for kindergarten students in Montreal , and an edible garden in Saskatoon to help students and families to learn about and participate in sustainable food growing practices.\nSome of the 2015-2016 schools that have received grants to green their outdoor spaces: (For a link to the full list of schools funded in 2015-2016, visit: https://www.evergreen.ca/get-involved/funding-opportunities/school-ground-grants/ )\nÉcole Rockingham School, Halifax, NS\nÉcole Rockingham School has been funded three times through the Toyota Evergreen Learning Grounds program. Each year building on the previous year's work, with newest features including native species of trees for shade, shrub gardens, raised beds for food gardening, stump seating and a log walk under the shade of the existing mature trees. Students held the original vision for the space, and the wider community helped make it a reality. The entire school takes part in lessons outdoors in the shaded seating area lovingly named \"The Grove.\"\nService de garde de l'école St-Zotique , Montréal, QC\nThe École St-Zotique's new school ground addresses the pressing issue of food insecurity in the community. Building from a successful food garden project funded in part by the TELG program in 2015, the daycare, with the help of community parents, plans to create a green corridor of edible native shrubs and plants, pollinator-friendly plants and raised vegetable beds. The school has partnered with the éco-quartier Sud-Ouest (an environment and action program introduced by the city of Montréal) to assist with plant selection and guiding their community planting events.\nRockwood Pubic School, Pembroke, ON\nRockwood Public School's new outdoor space features a unique natural wetland, lovingly called \"The Swamp.\" New seating and shade trees will improve access and usability to this dynamic outdoor learning space. The new outdoor classroom, developed in collaboration with Rockwood students and Algonquin College , was the site of a recent Earth Day bio blitz, where different species of wildlife were identified, counted and catalogued.\nConfederation Park Community School, Saskatoon, SK\nConfederation Park Community School has a six-year history of school food gardening. Twenty raised garden beds, eight in-ground garden beds, an edible food forest and other initiatives teach pre-kindergarten to grade 8 curriculum, including a Nêhiyâwiwin Cree Language and Culture Program. TELG funding this year helps students and their families learn about food sustainability practices and engage in life-long learning.\nHighlands Elementary, North Vancouver, BC\nTeachers at Highlands Elementary have created an outdoor learning space with new native species of trees for shade and plants that have a long history of being used by First Nations in the area. The long-term vision includes installing natural stone boulders and logs for seating and play, and a dry river bed to facilitate teaching around water ecosystems. Youth groups in the neighbourhood such as Girl Guides and Scouts will also access the space for their activities.\nApplication deadlines for the 2016-2017 TELG program are February 10 and April 13, 2017 .\nFor more details and how to apply visit: https://www.evergreen.ca/get-involved/funding-opportunities/school-ground-grants/\nAbout Evergreen: Since 1991, Evergreen, a not-for-profit, has provoked bold action in transforming public landscapes into thriving community spaces.

      "text": "Toyota has to appease owners of several previous-decade truck models who launched a class-action lawsuit against the company. Replacing those severely rusted frames won’t be an easy task, and there could be plenty of vehicles needing a completely new skeleton. \nThe settlement covers about 1.5 million Tacomas, Tundras and Sequoia vehicles that left the factory with insufficient rust protection. The corrosion is so bad, some vehicles could lose structural integrity. \nOf the crop of iron oxide-friendly frames, the bulk of them rest underneath 2005 to 2010 Tacomas. The rest lurk below 2005 to 2008 Sequoias and 2007 to 2008 Tundras. As part of the settlement, the automaker must now check up on those frames for a period of 12 years after they first left the dealer lot. \nReplacing a frame is a pricey, time-consuming process, so Toyota has set aside $15,000 for each affected vehicle, plus an extra $60 for regular inspections. According to a lawyer involved in the class action, Toyota mechanics should expect more than just a few frame-swaps in the coming years. \n“” Timothy Blood, co-counsel with Blood Hurst & O’Reardon in San Diego, told Automotive News . “There are a lot of steps to it. And it is labor-intensive.” \nGoing by that estimate, a total of 225,000 vehicles could see new frames. The ori \nFor a clearer idea of the replacement process, see the video below.",

Mumbai: The Japanese government will train 30,000 Indian engineers in manufacturing skills under a programme of Toyota Kirloskar Motor as part of its efforts to boost partnership in HR development between the two countries.The government has selected the 'manufacturing skill transfer promotion programme' of Toyota Kirloskar Motor for the purpose.Under the programme, Japan will train over 30,000 Indian engineers in manufacturing practices and the first three such institutes will start next summer in Gujarat, Karnataka and Rajasthan.Toyota Kirloskar Motor on Monday said the Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry, and the Indian Ministry of Skill development and Entrepreneurship had inked an agreement in this regard in Tokyo on November 11.As per the pact, a \"manufacturing skill transfer promotion programme will be conducted between the two nations, which will enhance the manufacturing base of India and contribute to Make in India' and Skill India initiatives.The selected engineers will be trained over the next 10 years in manufacturing skills and practices through the establishment of Japan-India Institutes for Manufacturing and the Japanese endowed courses in engineering colleges designated by Japanese companies in India in cooperation between the public and private sectors.Toyota's skill development initiatives are aimed at contributing to the 'Skill India' mission by bridging the gap between the country's rapidly-growing industrial sector and availability of highly skilled workforce to match up, the company said.The students will be exposed to the Toyota way of manufacturing called the 'Monozukuri' and familiarised with the global concepts of 'Lean Manufacturing' or Kaizen Genchi Genbutsu.The auto major already runs the Toyota Technical Training Institute in India since 2007 as part of its commitment towards developing world class skilled workforce for the sector.

      "text": "  17:38 PM EST Brand-new 2017 Toyota 86 replaces Scion FR-S in Edmonton, Alberta \nEDMONTON, Alberta , Nov. 21, 2016 /PRNewswire-iReach/ -- Earlier this year, the Scion brand was discontinued by its parent company Toyota. Scion wasn't a massive brand, but it did have its fair share of enthusiasts and fans, which is why one of the biggest questions after the announcement that the brand would be no more was what would be happening to the brand's vehicles. While some would be discontinued, others were rebadged and brought into the Toyota lineup. One of those vehicles was the brand's popular sports car, the Scion FR-S. \nPhoto - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20161121/441722 \nWhat was once the Scion FR-S, is now the 2017 Toyota 86 , and the sports car is already available at dealerships across the country, including Wheaton Toyota on the Trail in Edmonton . The dealership recently added new research to its website, which is filled with informative and comparative pages aimed at making the research process easier for car shoppers in the area. \nThe recently added pages are both comparisons pitting the rebadged and updated sports car against two of its biggest competitors, both from the same brand. One sees the 86 take on the 2017 Honda Accord Coupe , highlighting horsepower, curb weight and fuel efficiency while also looking at which tires come standard on the two vehicles. The other page sees the 86 pitted against the 2017 Honda Civic Coupe , highlighting horsepower, torque, cargo capacity and, once again, standard tires. \nThese comparisons and much more information can be found at www.toyotaonthetrail.ca . Additional questions and inquiries can be directed to the sales desk at 780-702-2222. Wheaton Toyota on the Trail is located at 5210 Calgary Trail in Edmonton . \nMedia Contact: Melina Kawecki , Wheaton Toyota on the Trail, 780-702-2222, \nNews distributed by PR Newswire iReach: https://ireach.prnewswire.com \nSOURCE Wheaton Toyota on the Trail Nasdaq quotes delayed at least 15 minutes, all others at least 20 minutes.

      "text": "Advertise on BaT \nThis 1987 Toyota Pickup 4WD was purchased new from A-1 Toyota-Dodge in New Haven, Connecticut and has covered 114k miles. The seller has six 1984-88 Toyota trucks and recently acquired this example from its original owner. With interior and exterior finished in blue, this Pickup has a standard bed and is powered by a 2.4L 22R inline-four paired with an updated 5-speed manual. Delivery options included the All Weather Package, power steering, chrome bumpers, cloth bench seat, SR5 wheels, and tinted glass, contributing to the $10,393 MSRP. The seller had the full undercarriage media-blasted, zinc-coated and epoxy-painted. The truck has also been professionally detailed inside and out, and benefits from a new clutch, tires, rear springs, and Bilstein heavy duty shocks. The sale includes the original window sticker, owner’s manuals, and transferable registration papers as Connecticut does not issue title to vehicles of this age. \nThe Toyota Blue finish is believed original with no prior repaints, accidents, or damage repair. The seller notes some nicks and scratches have been touched-up on both sides and the hood, and the paint would benefit from a light compound rubbing. A few small dents are reported including one on the back of the cab, and one spot of surface rust on the side of the bed has been stripped to bare metal and professionally repaired and painted. The front valance has been pushed up slightly under the passenger-side of the bumper, and the driver-side front turn signal lens is broken. \nThis 4×4 rides on original-spec 15″ SR5 steel wheels, and the seller notes the B.F. Goodrich All Terrain tires and spare are new. All exterior lighting is reported working correctly. The heavy duty plastic bed liner has no cracks or breaks, though a few areas are marked with spilled paint according to the seller. \nThe blue cloth full bench seat could use re-stuffing and shows one cigarette burn and one wear hole on the driver’s side. Newer rubber WeatherTech floor mats are fitted over the oil-stained carpet. The seller reports all gauges and accessories are functioning as intended. Climate controls do not include A/C, and no radio is currently fitted. Other interior surfaces have held up well, without notable sun damage or fading. The dash is reported to be solid with no cracks, warping, or distortions. \nThe 2.4L SOHC 22R inline-four produced 97 horsepower and 128 lb. ft. of torque when new. This engine is believed original and reportedly delivers 26 mpg in combined driving according to the seller. \nThe original manual transmission was a bit noisy in 3rd and 5th gears, so the seller installed an updated 5-speed, also adding a new clutch and throw-out bearings. Shifts are now reported as crisp, with good acceleration, easy climbs without downshifting, and quiet and comfortable 65-80 mph highway cruising. \nThe entire undercarriage has been media-blasted, then zinc-painted and epoxy-coated, including the frame, brake/differential housings, and gas tank, with all treated surfaces showing in gloss black. Recent suspension updates include new Bilstein heavy duty stocks all around, new rear springs with original spring rate, and all new bushings. The seller notes the truck rides well and front end tracking is tight. The seller describes the drivetrain as tight and quiet, with no rattles, unusual noises or leaks. No obvious evidence of off-roading damage is visible, and the seller reports the truck has never been used to plow. \nThis truck is sold with its original window sticker and owner’s manuals. The optional All Weather Guard Package, Power Steering, and Value Package added $620 to the $9548 base MSRP.

      "text": "Could Renault Sport produce a hot Zoe in the future?\n\nOur reporters empty their notebooks to round up this week's gossip from across the automotive industry\n\nThis week's gossip from the automotive industry has news of Renault Sport's interest in electric, Toyota's denial of a Supra teaser, the next-gen Fiat 500's arrival and Skoda's China-only Kodiaq coupé.\n\n*Renault Sport considers electric*\n\nRenault Sport has been looking at electric sports cars, according to its boss, Patrice Ratti, but it maintains that battery size is the sticking point. “It is not difficult to make an electric sports car,” he said. “The challenge is to do it with the size of the battery of the [electric] Zoe.” He added: “The advantage of an electric motor is a lot of torque in a small package.”\n\n*Read more: Renault Clio RS16 won't make production, Driving an eRally Renault Zoe*\n\n*Supra teaser 'a coincidence'*\n\nIn Autocar magazine earlier this month we brought you a scoop on the new Toyota Supra, and the firm has now dropped its own hint about the sports car’s arrival. A Yaris Hybrid TV advert features a car with the numberplate ‘260 SUP’, alluding to the fast model. A Toyota spokesman said: “It’s a nice idea, but I’m afraid it’s just a coincidence.”\n\n*Read more: New Toyota Supra on course for 2018 launch*\n\n*No need for a new 500*\n\nFiat boss Olivier François won’t commit to a date for the arrival of the next-generation Fiat 500. It’s the 500’s 70th birthday next year, sparking speculation that a new one might be ushered in, but the message from the boss is that while the current car is still selling so strongly (as it is across Europe), there’s no rush to cook up a new version.\n\n*Read more: Abarth 595 Competizione review*\n\n*Kodiaq coupé not for Europe*\n\nThe chances of the Skoda Kodiaq SUV-coupé being sold in Europe are said to be slim, despite the firm’s head of design, Josef Kaban, describing it as “sensationally hot”. Although some Skoda officials are said to be keen to sell the image-boosting car, research is believed to have shown that the majority of buyers would buy a standard Kodiaq. At present, it is set to be sold in China only.\n\n*Read more: Skoda Yeti - an epic journey through Butan, Vauxhall Grandland to compete with Skoda Kodiaq*",

      "text": "To (separate emails with commas) Message (optional) Your email was sent successfully. Close Kia Soul vs. Toyota RAV4: Compare Cars 8.6 November 21, 2016 \nC rossover SUV, or tall wagon—which suits you best? \nBoth the Toyota RAV4 and Kia Soul offer great packaging and cargo versatility. But that's about where the similarities end. They might not be two you'd typically cross-shop, but they're both great alternatives to basic sedans for cost-conscious small families or urban commuters. \nAcross a sea of genetically ambiguous wagon-ish vehicles, the Soul and RAV4 stand in sharp contrast. The latest RAV4 is solidly a compact crossover SUV, with available all-wheel drive and dimensions that stack up right along with the CR-V and Escape, its chief rivals. The Soul might be nearly a foot and a half shorter, as well as narrower, but there’s something to be said for its packaging, which brings nearly as much real-world-usable space. \nMORE: Read our review of the 2017 Kia Soul and 2017 Toyota RAV4 \nWho wins? By the numbers, it's the RAV4. We rated the Toyota a 7.3, while the Kia manages a 6.8—for now. We haven't yet figured a final safety score, so that could inch higher. Even without formalized data from the IIHS, it's a close race and its easy to see why. ( Read more about how we rate cars .) \nThese two models are both very popular, yet they’re pretty much polar opposites with respect to styling. One of them, the RAV4, essentially plays it safe, with a profile that blends in alongside other affordable compacts like the Honda CR-V, Chevy Equinox, and Mazda CX-5. Up close, it’s far from inspiring; although a refresh for the 2016 model year fine-tuned some of the details and added more soft-touch surfaces. \n2016 Kia Soul Enlarge Photo \nThe Soul, on the other hand, makes a memorable, unique statement from first glance, and we’d call it the winner from a style standpoint. Its blunt front end and boxy shape and silhouette are unmistakable, as is its roofline, which appears to float over a blacked-out greenhouse. Altogether, it adds up to a look that’s distinct but not too gimmicky. On the inside, it’s mostly good stuff, although a bit more small-car ordinary, with some nice details, including available LED cabin mood lighting. \nPerformance for both of these models is far from stellar. We’d place both soundly in the adequate category, but driving enthusiasts or anyone with serious performance expectations might want to look elsewhere. The RAV4 does just fine with its base 176-horsepower, 2.5-liter 4-cylinder engine; a new Hybrid version has 190 net horsepower, a 33-mpg combined EPA rating, and more responsive feel. The RAV4 rides and handles like a relatively nimble sedan, especially in SE trim, which gets a slightly stiffer suspension tune. Four-wheel drive is an option, and there’s even a 4WD Lock mode for predictable traction in snow or mud. \nAs for the Soul, 4WD or all-wheel drive aren’t at all offered, so again it’s a bit difficult to compare. Its driving manners are essentially like those of a soft-riding compact car. We’d recommend that you go for a Soul Plus with the larger 164-hp, 2.0-liter engine; this engine is effective in moving the Soul quickly enough with the 6-speed automatic transmission, although the combination can get quite boomy at times (like up long grades or with a few passengers aboard). A 6-speed manual is offered on the Soul, but only with the smaller engine. A high-powered 1.6-liter turbo-4 is available in Soul Exclaim models but pushes the price up close to a starting RAV4. The Soul maneuvers really well around tight spaces—a definite advantage over the larger RAV4—but for both of these models the steering itself suffers from a lack of feedback, and weighting could be better. \nYou might find a quick consult of the official interior specifications for these two models a bit surprising. Despite being a class apart with respect to exterior size, they’re near equals in terms of EPA passenger space, and their all-out cargo space isn’t too far off. Credit the Soul’s boxiness. \n2016 Toyota RAV4 SE Enlarge Photo \nIn reality, the usability of the two cabins is a bit different. Both of these models have back seats that aren’t as comfortable as what you’d get in a mid-size sedan; they make some compromises in contouring and support in the name of flat folding for expanded cargo space. The third-row seating option the RAV4 offered in its last generation is now a distant memory, and both models have a reasonably spacious back seat. Where you’ll notice the Soul’s smaller dimensions is in its width; placing three adults across in the back seat is pretty much impossible in the Soul, but doable for short stints in the RAV4. Ride quality is quite impressive in either of these models, but we’d probably give the RAV4 our comfort preference for its generally quieter cabin. \nThe RAV4 is strong on safety. It earns five stars overall from the NHTSA and a Top Safety Pick+ award from the IIHS, and it includes automatic emergency braking as standard. The latest Soul gets five stars in all crash categories from the feds—though it lacks forward-collision warnings and automatic braking. Outward visibility in either of these models isn’t ideal, however. \nThe Soul may be a class below the RAV4 in size, but it doesn’t skimp on features. Especially near the top of their respective lineups, you might argue that the Soul is the better-equipped of the two, as it offers things like ventilated front seats, heated rear seats, and a heated steering wheel—all of which aren’t offered on the RAV4. The Soul offers a pretty great infotainment system, with UVO eServices telematics, but we’d probably give the 576-watt JBL audio and Entune app-based infotainment system in the RAV4 a nudge ahead for audiophiles.",

      "text": "2017 Toyota 86 Solar Orange Limited review by Kirby Garlitos + \nIt seems like we’ve been down this road before, doesn’t it? A special edition Toyota 86 that’s exclusive to the Japanese market is nothing new and yet, as often as our friends in Japan get these limited edition 86 s, we haven’t had as much luck in that regard. In any event, a new limited-run Toyota 86 is fresh from the oven over there in Japan, and it’s promising, among other things, improved braking, sharper handling, and a special edition paint color. It’s called the Toyota 86 Solar Orange Limited and yes, it’s not coming to the States. \nThe upgrades themselves didn’t turn the 86 Solar Orange Limited into a full-blown performance car, but in the technical sense, they helped create a better driving experience for those who are willing to spend the money for the car. In a lot of ways, it’s similar to past special edition 86s that have made their way into Japan, including the 86 Yellow Limited and the curiously designed 86 Style CB. The latter is arguably the most unique of the three examples, but the Solar Orange limited is different too in some respects. The Creamsicle paint finish, for example, is exclusive to this edition, as is Toyota’s new High Performance package, which adds a number of functionally useful components that help improve the 86’s overall driving and handling experience. \nToyota didn’t say how many examples of the 86 Solar Orange Limited it plans to build, opting only to say that pricing starts at 3,251,880 yen for the manual transmission model and 3,318,840 yen for the automatic transmission model. Based on current exchange rates, those prices convert to around $29,400 and $30,000, respectively. Interested customers have only between January 31 to March 10, 2017 to place their orders, after which Toyota will likely stop production to retain its overall exclusivity. \nContinue after the jump to read more about the Toyota 86 Solar Orange Limited. continue reading What makes the Toyota 86 Solar Orange Limited So Special \nLike past special edition models of the Toyota 86, the Solar Orange Limited differentiates itself with an exclusive Creamsicle color that Toyota says will be limited to this mode alone. The color finish alone should make for enough of an upgrade to justify its special edition label, but the 86 Solar Orange Limited also boasts of other notable goodies, including cosmetic upgrades to the exterior and interior in the form of black mirror caps, heated seats dressed in leather and Alcantara upholstery, and matching orange stitching throughout the cabin. \nIf this “formula” looks and sounds familiar to you, there’s a good chance that you already saw it with the 86 Yellow Limited that Toyota introduced back in July 2015. That one was also characterized by a unique paint to the sports coupe that the automaker referred to as Sunrise Yellow. As far as packages are concerned, the Yellow Limited beats its Solar Orange counterpart thanks to an aerodynamic package that includes, among other things, a modified front bumper, a massive rear wing, new side skirts, and a bigger diffuser. \nAnother comparison, albeit one that’s not as apt as the Yellow Limited is the 86 Style Cb, which Toyota introduced all the way back in February 2015. That special edition version of the 86 featured a completely redesigned exterior that somewhat lost its 86 design qualities in favor of something that resembled a cross between the old Toyota Celica and 2000GT models. At the very least, it had some Zagato inspiration to it, including the sloped nose and the round set of headlights. \nThe two previous 86 special edition examples show the expanse of creativity that Toyota can still dip into at opportune times. In some ways, the same can be said for the Solar Orange Limited since its Creamsicle paint finish and the other cosmetic changes aren’t the only upgrades available for this specific model. Just as important is the High Performance Package that includes a new set of Brembo brakes with red calipers and new shocks from Sachs. These components combine with the coupe’s special set of 17-inch thin-spoked wheels to not only enhance the car’s looks, but also give it better driving and handling qualities compared to the standard 86. \nIt’s worth pointing out that Toyota is releasing the High Performance Package for standard 86 models on February 7 in Japan. Those who want to opt for the Solar Orange Limited model with the High Performance Package need only add 243,000 yen (around $2,200) to the cost of the special edition 86. \nWe’ve come this far without mentioning the 86’s engine, and there’s a reason for that. Like past special edition trims of the sports coupe, Toyota, for one reason or another, has once again opted to ignore doing any upgrades on the sports car’s 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine. That means that those who end up placing orders for the 86 Solar Orange Limited will have to settle for the car’s standard output of 205 horsepower and 156 pound-feet of torque. Sure, it’s five horsepower and five pound-feet more than the old version of the 86, but it’s still not where we’d like it to be. \nOh, well…",

      "text": "Toyota and Evergreen partnership brings outdoor learning to life on over 6,000 Canadian school grounds. (CNW Group/Evergreen) Since 2000 this innovative program has helped connect 1.2 million students to nature TORONTO , Nov. 21, 2016 /CNW/ - One of Evergreen's longest standing partnerships and largest educational initiatives, the Toyota Evergreen Learning Grounds (TELG) program continues to help Canadian students and teachers transform their school grounds into healthy places to learn, play and connect with nature. This year, the national program led by Evergreen with support from Toyota Canada and its dealerships, helped 559 schools with their efforts to green their outdoor spaces, engaging 48,245 students and staff. The TELG program is at the forefront of the school ground greening movement. Since 2000, the partnership has provided millions of dollars of support through hands-on expertise, training, publications and grants to over 6,000 schools across Canada , reaching close to 1.2 million elementary and secondary school students and 96,000 teachers and school staff. The scope of the TELG's impact inspired Evergreen to cofound the International School Ground Alliance in 2011. Green school grounds aim to inspire discovery and learning, increase physical activity, motivate teachers and students, and support environmental awareness and stewardship. Each project offers a unique opportunity for schools to engage with the greater community, including the active support role many Toyota dealerships have played in their local service areas. \"Through this innovative long-standing initiative, students and staff each year have access to expert hands-on environmental learning and the unique opportunity to design and create their school's new outdoor space,\" says Geoff Cape , Evergreen CEO. \"Toyota's incredible commitment to this work continues to encourage a life-long passion for play and learning in nature that builds a caring relationship with the natural world – a foundation for building sustainable and flourishing cities.\" \"Toyota's commitment to enriching communities and establishing a future society in harmony with nature is at the core of our collaboration with Evergreen,\" says Larry Hutchinson , President and CEO, Toyota Canada Inc. \"Toyota Canada is proud of the impact the Toyota Evergreen Learning Grounds program has had over the past 16 years, providing everyday opportunities for students to engage with nature on Canada's school grounds.\" This year, for its 25 th anniversary, Evergreen launched the Evergreen City Builders Awards and partnered with Toyota to recognize outstanding innovation in children's nature playgrounds with the Toyota Playground Placemaker Award. The award recipient, Sandy Clee , Senior Planner at the Simcoe County District School Board in Midhurst, Ontario supported the transformation of 87 early year schoolyards from barren outdoor expanses to dynamic natural play and learning spaces. Schools participating in the 2015-2016 TELG program have realized their greening goals with a wide variety of outdoor improvements such as a year-round outdoor classroom in North Vancouver , a food and pollinator garden for kindergarten students in Montreal , and an edible garden in Saskatoon to help students and families to learn about and participate in sustainable food growing practices. Some of the 2015-2016 schools that have received grants to green their outdoor spaces: (For a link to the full list of schools funded in 2015-2016, visit: https://www.evergreen.ca/get-involved/funding-opportunities/school-ground-grants/ ) École Rockingham School, Halifax, NS École Rockingham School has been funded three times through the Toyota Evergreen Learning Grounds program. Each year building on the previous year's work, with newest features including native species of trees for shade, shrub gardens, raised beds for food gardening, stump seating and a log walk under the shade of the existing mature trees. Students held the original vision for the space, and the wider community helped make it a reality. The entire school takes part in lessons outdoors in the shaded seating area lovingly named \"The Grove.\" Service de garde de l'école St-Zotique , Montréal, QC The École St-Zotique's new school ground addresses the pressing issue of food insecurity in the community. Building from a successful food garden project funded in part by the TELG program in 2015, the daycare, with the help of community parents, plans to create a green corridor of edible native shrubs and plants, pollinator-friendly plants and raised vegetable beds. The school has partnered with the éco-quartier Sud-Ouest (an environment and action program introduced by the city of Montréal) to assist with plant selection and guiding their community planting events. Rockwood Pubic School, Pembroke, ON Rockwood Public School's new outdoor space features a unique natural wetland, lovingly called \"The Swamp.\" New seating and shade trees will improve access and usability to this dynamic outdoor learning space. The new outdoor classroom, developed in collaboration with Rockwood students and Algonquin College , was the site of a recent Earth Day bio blitz, where different species of wildlife were identified, counted and catalogued. Confederation Park Community School, Saskatoon, SK Confederation Park Community School has a six-year history of school food gardening. Twenty raised garden beds, eight in-ground garden beds, an edible food forest and other initiatives teach pre-kindergarten to grade 8 curriculum, including a Nêhiyâwiwin Cree Language and Culture Program. TELG funding this year helps students and their families learn about food sustainability practices and engage in life-long learning. Highlands Elementary, North Vancouver, BC Teachers at Highlands Elementary have created an outdoor learning space with new native species of trees for shade and plants that have a long history of being used by First Nations in the area. The long-term vision includes installing natural stone boulders and logs for seating and play, and a dry river bed to facilitate teaching around water ecosystems. Youth groups in the neighbourhood such as Girl Guides and Scouts will also access the space for their activities. Application deadlines for the 2016-2017 TELG program are February 10 and April 13, 2017 .

      "text": "National Education Program from Cincinnati Children’s and Toyota Helps Protect Children during the Holidays and Beyond \n\nCincinnati, Ohio, Nov. 21, 2016 -- It’s that time of year again when millions of Americans will hit the road to travel near and far to be with friends and family. AAA predicts that 43.5 million Americans will travel by car this Thanksgiving season. [1] \n\nThe startling truth, however, is that 75 percent of car seats in the U.S. are not used correctly. [2] That’s why Buckle Up for Life , the national car seat education program from Cincinnati Children’s and Toyota, is releasing its top tips for the Thanksgiving travel season. \n\n“The holidays are a reminder to be thankful for all that we have – and for so many of us this includes the children in our lives,” said Gloria Del Castillo, child passenger safety expert at Cincinnati Children’s and senior outreach specialist for Buckle Up for Life . “We want every parent and caregiver to have the knowledge and resources they need to help keep child passengers safe during this special time of year and beyond. These tips from Buckle Up for Life may seem simple, but they could save a child’s life in the event of a crash.” \nBuckle Up for Life ’s Must-Know Thanksgiving Travel Tips \nThe following tips, as well as additional advice and guidance, including animated car seat installation videos, can be found on BuckleUpforLife.org . \nUse the “Inch and Pinch” Test . After you’ve buckled your child in, pinch the car seat strap near their shoulders. If you can pinch a wrinkle in the fabric, tighten the strap until it is snug. Then grab the car seat at the bottom where it is attached to the car and tug from side to side and front to back. If the seat moves more than an inch in either direction, tighten it. \nSecure Holiday “Extras” in the Car . Make sure that all gifts, luggage and other holiday “extras” are tightly secured in your vehicle. These objects could become projectiles in the event of a crash. \nEnsure Your Child’s Seat Faces the Correct Way . Some parents and caregivers may wonder when it’s safe to turn the car seat around to face forward. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that children remain in rear-facing car seats until age two , or until they exceed the height or weight limit for the seat. \nRemove Your Child’s Winter Coat. Before securing your child in their seat, remove their winter coat. A coat can prevent the harness from fitting correctly. It also could compress in a crash, compromising the seat’s ability to protect your child. \n\nDon’t Rent a Car Seat. Traveling by plane? If you are renting a car, use your own car seat. When you rent a seat you don’t know important facts about its history that could affect its ability to protect your child (e.g., expiration date, crash history, etc.) The good news is that many airlines allow you to check your car seat for free. \n\nAbout Buckle Up for Life \nBuckle Up for Life is a national injury prevention program for families, created by Toyota and Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center in 2004, to help keep child passengers safe. The program partners with leading children’s hospitals, community organizations, local governments, schools and non-profit organizations to teach parents and children about the proper use of car seats and seat belts and to provide free car seats to families in need. Buckle Up for Life has reached more than 45,000 people nationwide and has partnerships in 17 cities including New York, Dallas, Memphis, Phoenix, Chicago, Cincinnati, Houston, Las Vegas, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Orange County, and San Antonio – and expands to new partners each year. In one city alone, the program nearly tripled the use of proper car seats in participating families. Toyota has provided funding for over 40,000 car seats for families in need. For more information about Buckle Up for Life, please visit www.buckleupforlife.org. \nAbout Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center \nCincinnati Children’s, a non-profit, pediatric, academic medical center established in 1883, is internationally recognized for improving child health and transforming delivery of care through fully integrated, globally recognized research, education and innovation. It is one of the top three recipients of pediatric research grants from the National Institutes of Health, ranked third in the nation among all Honor Roll hospitals in U.S. News and World Report’s Best Children’s Hospitals, and a research and teaching affiliate of the University of Cincinnati’s College of Medicine.

A destination for children with complex medical conditions, it also served patients from all 50 states and nearly 70 countries during the past year. Additional information can be found at www.cincinnatichildrens.org . \nConnect on the Cincinnati Children’s blog , via and on . \nAbout Toyota \nToyota (NYSE:TM), the world's top automaker and creator of the Prius and the Mirai fuel cell vehicle, is committed to advancing mobility through our Toyota and Lexus brands.

      "text": "Toyota Launches In-house EV Development Toyota Launches In-house EV Development By Bob Nagy on November 22, 2016 7:00 AM \nLong a proponent of fitting vehicles with hybrid/plug-in power and ultimately hydrogen fuel cells, Toyota Motor Corporation is moving in a slightly different direction with the establishment of a group specifically charged with developing electric vehicles. Set to launch next month, the group initially will consist of just four individuals, one each from Toyota Industries Corporation, Aisin Seiki Co., Ltd., Denso Corporation and TMC itself. Although designed to function as a fully independent entity, this new organization will be able to draw on the technical assistence of the entire Toyota Group. \nAlso: Class of 2017 – New Cars Ready to Roll \nTMC President Akio Toyoda believes fuel cell vehicles remain the ultimate form of eco-car. But the broad range of global energy and infrastructure issues coupled with tighter regulations focused on increasing sales of zero-emission vehicles are forcing Toyota to take this action with an eye towards expanding its product lineup to include dedicated EVs as early as possible. Reports out of Japan hint that the first of these new Toyota electrics could be introduced in connection with the 2020 Olympic games that will be held in Tokyo. \nAlso: Kelley Blue Book Best Buy Awards of 2017 \nToyota is banking on the small size of this new “virtual venture company” to foster implementation of unconventional work processes that will reduce development times and fast track upcoming EV products into showrooms. Akio Toyoda also hopes it will generate ancillary benefits in other areas -- notably “to serve as a pulling force for innovation in the work practices of Toyota and the Toyota Group.\" \nMore Toyota News…",

      "text": "Jordan: Investor confidence rises for the first time in eight months Hydrogen society can drive the future of environmental sustainability in the UAE, affirms Toyota at 2nd Int’l conference on future mobility Hydrogen society can drive the future of environmental sustainability in the UAE, affirms Toyota at 2nd Int’l conference on future mobility   FCV - Toyota Mirai \nMarkazia, the sole distributor of Toyota, Lexus and Hino trucks in Jordan, announced the results of Toyota Motor Corporation’s participation in the 2 nd International Conference on Future Mobility, which was held at the Grand Hyatt Hotel in Dubai. Toyota proposed the possibility of setting up a hydrogen-based society which can positively contribute to the UAE Vision 2021’s sustainability goals and help mitigate the environmental impact of fossil fuel consumption. \nStanding by its commitment to environmental sustainability during the conference, Toyota Motor Corporation highlighted the UAE’s potential to become the capital of the clean energy world by producing and utilizing hydrogen as a promising energy source that powers the most eco-friendly vehicles, namely Fuel Cell Vehicles (FCVs). \nToyota introduced Prius as the world’s first mass-production hybrid vehicle in 1997. To date, the company has sold around 9 million hybrids that have already contributed to a CO2 reduction of 67 million tons and this number is increasing further. \nNadim Haddad, Deputy General Manager at Markazia, said, “We are confident that Toyota Motor Corporation’s hybrid vehicles, with their eco-friendly technology, offer a great way to reduce fossil fuel consumption and thereby decrease CO2 emissions. However, to boost this even further, technologies such as those that power FCVs are crucial. Having identified hydrogen as a promising energy source for the future, we praise Toyota Motor Corporation for its commitment to develop FCV as the ultimate environmentally friendly vehicle.” \nDuring the conference Toyota also stated some of the numerous advantages of FCVs, highlighting hydrogen as a fuel source for FCVs that can be produced using a wide variety of primary energy sources. In addition, FCVs emit only water when driven, thereby producing zero CO 2 emissions, with the powertrain offering smooth, quiet driving and excellent acceleration at low-to-mid range speeds. FCVs can also be used as a power supply, which can prove to be extremely useful in case of natural disasters. Further, they also offer an excellent range, and refueling them only takes three minutes – giving owners a considerable freedom of use. \nThe UAE already has an abundant supply of hydrogen being generated from using excess capacity at oil refineries and ammonia plants, as well as a byproduct at its existing caustic soda and ethylene plants. Toyota argued that a careful assessment of hydrogen’s potential as the fuel source of the future can help the UAE become the capital of clean energy world.",

      "text": "Toyota wants this baby robot to be your friend by Jethro Mullen @CNNTech October 4, 2016: 3:06 AM ET Toyota created a mini robot companion Lonely at the wheel? Toyota wants to sell you a talking robot to keep you company. \nSmall enough to fit in the cup holder of your Corolla, the robot is described by Toyota ( TM ) as \"a miniature communication partner developed to provide companionship.\" \nNamed Kirobo Mini, the 4-inch high gizmo can apparently chat away and even respond to facial expressions. \n\"Oh no, what has happened?\" it asks in response to a young woman's downcast face in a Toyota video. \nThe world's biggest automaker plans to put Kirobo on sale in dealerships across Japan next year for around $400 before tax. It didn't mention any plans for introducing it in other countries. \nThe robot can remember its companion's likes and dislikes as well as journeys they've taken together, Toyota says. And it can be linked up to cars and gadgets in the home to make the conversation more lively. \nRobots in Japan have come a long way since the hugely popular Tamagotchi virtual pets of the 1990s. The country has a hotel staffed by them and they're also popping up to assist customers in stores and banks . ",

      "text": "PLANO, TX (WCMH) — Toyota is issuing a safety recall of approximately 744,000 Model Year 2011-2016 Toyota Sienna vehicles sold across the United States.\nThe issue involves motor circuit that controls the sliding doors on the minivans. In certain conditions, the circuits can overload, opening the fuse for the motor. If that occurs, the door could open while driving, increasing the risk of injury to a vehicle occupant.\nIn a news release , Toyota said it is currently developing a fix for the door issue and will notify owners by mid-January.\nAll known owners of the involved vehicles will be notified by first class mail by mid-January.\nFor any additional questions, customers can call Toyota Customer Service at 1-800-331-4331.\n ",

      "text": "Privacy policy | More Newsletters Getty Images, File A 2016 Toyota Sienna Minivan on display at the Chicago Auto Show on February 19, 2016. (Photo By Raymond Boyd/Getty Images) Nearly three quarters of a million recent model-year Toyota Siennas are being recalled over the possibility their sliding doors can open while driving, the auto manufacturer announced Tuesday. The minivans between years 2011 and 2016 are affected by the recall, and owners will be notified by mid-January when a remedy for the problem is developed for the 744,000 vehicles affected. 'Actual Device' Targets Center City Resident, Explodes: Cops The recall was prompted by a set of conditions that can cause Sienna motor circuits to overload, opening the door if its latch is in an unlatched position. That only occurs if the sliding door opening operation is impeded, Toyota said. Customers can call 800-331-4331 for more information, or they can look up their vehicle identification number at toyota.com/recall to see if their vehicle is impacted.",

All the affected vans are between the 2011 and 2016 model years. Build dates for the vehicles in question have not been supplied. \nThe issue relates to the electrical system for the Sienna's sliding doors. In certain circumstances, if a sliding door is impeded while opening, it could overload the door's motor circuit and open a fuse. If that happens when the door isn't closed, the door might pop open while driving. Naturally, that presents a huge safety risk, especially considering children are often in the back of minivans. \nThere is no official fix on the books yet -- Toyota is still engineering itself a remedy. Regardless, the automaker will still send out recall notices to all affected owners by first-class mail. That campaign should be complete by the middle of January. Owners can also head to Toyota's website and input their VINs to see if they have any open recalls. Share your voice",

(Photo By Raymond Boyd/Getty Images) Nearly three quarters of a million Toyota Siennas are being recalled over the possibility their sliding doors can open while driving, the auto manufacturer announced Tuesday. The recall affects minivans between model years 2011 and 2016, and the company is currently developing a fix. Owners will be notified by mid-January when a remedy for the problem is established for the 744,000 vehicles affected. Watch Live Package Bomb Explodes in Philadelphia Apt., Injuring 1 The recall was prompted by a set of conditions that can cause Sienna motor circuits to overload, opening the door if it's latch is in an unlatched position. That only occurs if the sliding door opening operation is impeded, Toyota said. Customers can call 800-331-4331 for more information, or they can look up their vehicle identification number at toyota.com/recall to see if their vehicle is impacted. ",

This MoC will help contribute to “Make in India” and “Skill India” initiative by training around 30,000 persons in over 10 years. The 30,000 persons will be trained in the Japanese style manufacturing skills and practices at the Japan-India Institutes for Manufacturing (JIM) and the Japanese Endowed Courses (JEC) in engineering colleges. These institutes will start in 2017 in Gujarat, Karnataka and Rajasthan. \nIn the talks between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, they have selected Toyota Kirloskar Motor (TKM) to further boost the initiatives in the country. The initiative will help in bridging the gap between a rapidly growing industrial sector and availability of highly skilled workforce. \nIn 2007, Toyota inaugurated its Toyota Technical Training Institute (TTTI), situated within the premises of Toyota's manufacturing plant at Bidadi near Bangalore. The institute trains financially challenged students from Below Poverty Line (BPL) families across Karnataka. At TTTI, there are four-courses, including automobile welding, automobile assembly, automobile painting and plant maintenance, which every student has to take up. Besides this, the company is also focused on improving their lifestyle and offering employment opportunities. \nAt the institutes, the students are exposed to the Toyota Way of Manufacturing 'Monozukuri' and to get familiar with the global concepts of 'Lean Manufacturing', Kaizen, Genchi Genbutsu. The students are also exposed to Knowledge (16%), Skill (34%), Body and Mind (50%). Since its inception, around 448 students have successfully completed the training and are working with Toyota.

The recall involves Sienna minivans from the 2011-2016 model years. A majority of the minivans — 744,000 — were sold in the U.S. Toyota says the problem happens when the door's opening is impeded and the motor's circuit gets overloaded. If the door is unlatched, it could open while the minivan is driving. Toyota will repair the doors for free. It is still developing a remedy for the problem. Most Popular",

A majority of the minivans — 744,000 — were sold in the U.S. \nToyota says the problem happens when the door's opening is impeded and the motor's circuit gets overloaded.

      "text": "Toyota Recalls Certain Sienna Vehicles November 22, 2016 PLANO, Texas, November 22, 2016 – Toyota Motor North America, Inc., announced that it is conducting a safety recall of approximately 744,000 Model Year 2011-2016 Toyota Sienna vehicles in the U.S. In the involved vehicles, there is a possibility that, under certain limited conditions, if the sliding door opening operation is impeded, the sliding door motor circuit could be overloaded, opening the fuse for the motor. If this occurs when the door latch is in an unlatched position, the door could open while driving, increasing the risk of injury to a vehicle occupant. Toyota is currently developing the remedy for this condition. All known owners of the involved vehicles will be notified by first class mail by mid-January. Information about automotive recalls, including but not limited to the list of involved vehicles, is subject to change over time. For the most up-to-date Safety Recall information on Lexus, Toyota and Scion customers should check their vehicle’s status by visiting http://www.toyota.com/recall and entering the Vehicle Identification Number (VIN). Safety Recall inquiry by individual VIN is also available at the NHTSA site: safercar.gov/vin .

      "title": "Toyota launches new CH-R, a tiny SUV",
      "text": "New Toyota CH-R Rasheed Bisiriyu Toyota Motor Corporation is surprised by the overwhelming acceptance its new model of CH-R has received and may have to expand the production to a commercial quantity. It was one of the crossover utility vehicles unveiled at the 2016 Los Angeles Auto Show; a model that reportedly stretched the definition of that category. The 2018 Toyota C-HR features the high driving position of a crossover, but in a vehicle with decidedly car-like styling, and without an all-wheel drive option, says an online auto journal, the Green Cars Report . “Adding to the confusion, the letters C-HR stand for “Coupe High Rider” but, unlike a traditional two-door coupe, the C-HR has four conventional doors and a rear hatch,” it notes. Another report by The Mortley Foo l says the 2018 Toyota C-HR is a new small SUV with dramatic styling that Toyota hopes will help it return to growth in the United States and other markets. The C-HR (for coupe high-rider) is a subcompact crossover SUV that is about the same size as Honda HR-V and Jeep Renegade — two of the vehicles the C-HR will be expected to compete with around the world, it says. According to the report, the C-HR has more dramatic styling than is typical of Toyota vehicles, something the brand hopes will attract younger buyers. “Inside, it’s typical Toyota – controls laid out simply and sensibly – with a bit of what Toyota says is “sports car influence” in the design, it states. Buyers will have just one powertrain choice, a 2.0 litre four-cylinder with a new continuously variable transmission in the US, while it will be available in hybrid and manual-transmission versions elsewhere in the world. The 2018 Toyota C-HR will begin arriving at US dealers in next year. Prices not announced yet, but Toyota executives are quoted as saying they are aiming for a starting price above $20,000.

The recall involves Sienna minivans from the 2011-2016 model years. A majority of the minivans — 744,000 — were sold in the U.S. Toyota says the problem happens when the door’s opening is impeded and the motor’s circuit gets overloaded. If the door is unlatched, it could open while the minivan is driving. Toyota will repair the doors for free. It is still developing a remedy for the problem. The company said it will notify owners about the fix by mid-January. (© Copyright 2015 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. This material may not be published, rewritten or redistributed.) \n",

      "text": "Privacy policy | More Newsletters Getty Images, File A 2016 Toyota Sienna Minivan on display at the Chicago Auto Show on February 19, 2016. (Photo By Raymond Boyd/Getty Images) Nearly three quarters of a million Toyota Siennas are being recalled over the possibility their sliding doors can open while driving, the auto manufacturer announced Tuesday. The recall affects minivans between model years 2011 and 2016, and the company is currently developing a fix. Owners will be notified by mid-January when a remedy for the problem is established for the 744,000 vehicles affected. 'Actual Device' Targets Center City Resident, Explodes: Cops The recall was prompted by a set of conditions that can cause Sienna motor circuits to overload, opening the door if it's latch is in an unlatched position. That only occurs if the sliding door opening operation is impeded, Toyota said. Customers can call 800-331-4331 for more information, or they can look up their vehicle identification number at toyota.com/recall to see if their vehicle is impacted.",
