      "text": "Microsoft was working on a MacBook Touch Bar-like solution back in 1999 \nRose Behar \nNovember 6, 2016 4:46pm \nWhile the OLED Touch Bar that graces Apple‚Äôs MacBook Pro 2016 has a whiff of the future about it, the actual concept of replacing traditional function keys with an adaptive solution has been around for a long time. \nLenovo produced its own, more limited version of the Touch Bar in 2014 called the ThinkPad X1 Carbon. Ultimately, the laptop was a flop, but it turns out the manufacturer wasn‚Äôt alone in designing such a feature for the PC ecosystem. In fact, the Windows creator itself, Microsoft, was plotting its implementation of adaptive hardware since 1999. Something worth checking out, worked on this a while back. Especially, given recent tech news. @microsoft @surface : https://t.co/M08AoGAkF7 \n‚Äî Steven Bathiche (@sbathiche) October 29, 2016 \nThe feature‚Äôs design iterations is the subject of a blog post from the Microsoft Applied Sciences Group, which was recently tweeted out by Steven Bathiche, the manager of that division. \nMicrosoft‚Äôs take on adaptive hardware was conceived of in 1999 by Bathiche, who envisioned a keyboard ‚Äúthat displays the active action keys and hides the irrelevant keys for a given application, application mode, and application state,‚Äù sketching a paper prototype in his notebook (pictured above). \nAfter that Bathiche and various team members went through multiple prototypes, using a number of different display and projection tactics. In 2009, the research team put together a prototype fairly similar to Apple‚Äôs Touch Bar, featuring a large, touch-sensitive display strip resting atop the keyboard. \nWhen questioned on Twitter as to why Microsoft‚Äôs concept never made it to reality, Bathiche replied: ‚ÄúWe did not build computers back then, and when we did start, we made computers with touch screens.‚Äù \nWith this, of course, he refers to the Surface, which pioneered an entirely new vision of the future for on-the-go computer users: the 2-in-1 tablet-laptop hybrid. The two very different approaches to touchscreen technology aren‚Äôt surprising considering the stark contrast between the two companies, but it‚Äôll be interesting to see which tech giant eventually wins out. Via The Verge Jason \nMaybe they also didn‚Äôt do it because for anything to be successful it needs third party support and I can see touchbars being super proprietary and really wouldn‚Äôt have much use BetelgeuseOrion \nJ t your research is lacking, \n‚ÄúMicrosoft‚Äôs concept never made it to reality‚Äù<‚Äì WTF? \ngoogle \"Microsoft Slideshow\" for windows Vista, they had this back in 2007 \noems made the laptops and incorporated the secondary touch screen in whatever ways they saw fit. i even played with an Asus laptop model that had it. Shoey5 \nLike Most Apple ‚Äúinventions‚Äù it‚Äôs been done before, beyond that concept video there were devices on the market doing it. It‚Äôs Me \nWhen did Apple say they invented it? \nI love windmills. Seems to be a lot of them around these days. Driving people nuts. Shoey5 \nSo you admit they rip off other peoples ideas üôÇ \nThey always project new offerings as if they were the first to come up with it and the unintelligent masses believe it. \nBTW, where did I say they claimed to have invented it? It‚Äôs Me \nNo, I think some people are delusional. For example, some people love to criticize Apple for saying they invented something, though Apple never said they invented it. It‚Äôs sort of a weird neurosis. Shoey5 \nLike I said they project things as if they invented it and the unintelligent masses believe it. It‚Äôs Me \nDoesn‚Äôt really matter. Those that need to invent reasons to hate will invent reasons to hate. It‚Äôs weird but it‚Äôs real. Shoey5 \nHold on a second here. My original comment in reference to this article was to point out that there were a number of touch panels on the market and you took offence for some reason and you are telling that I need to invent reasons to hate? It‚Äôs Me \nLOL, no offence. Just find some things amusing. Shoey5 \nto the fact that I was trying to point out it‚Äôs nothing new? It‚Äôs Me \nMore of the accusatory tone. Shoey5 \nThough that would only apply if it wasn‚Äôt a fact that Apple has tried to rip off other people‚Äôs work in the past üôÇ I still think your more offended at the fact that it‚Äôs in reference to Apple üôÇ Mr Dog \nSee it likes this. \nApple has never invented something new. \nThey take existing ideas and make it so much better than what existed that to most people it seems new. \nWere there touch bars on the market before? YesWere they anywhere close to what Apple put in the Macbooks? No \nAnd thinking they are the same is just sillly. Show me one Touch Bar on the market that is even close to as nice as this Touch Bar or has anywhere close to as much support as this already has. Shoey5 \nRemoving headphone jack was such an improvement and so are all those dongles. Apple is worse than the Microsoft of the early nineties. What they are good at is bs marketing for you to believe that crap. Mr Dog \nWow. Can‚Äôt argue the points so just go off topic? Shoey5 \n??? I gave you two recent examples about how your ‚ÄúApple makes it better‚Äù is a crock of ‚Ä¶. How is that off topic? Mr Dog \nYes, because we are talking about the Touch Bar and this entire article is about the Touch Bar. \nIf you want to talk about Apples decision to remove the headphone jack then we can have that separately and is not related here. That is a whole different conversation. \nI said Apple doesnt invent, they take exsisting ideas and makes them so much better. To counter your argument of you saying Apple doesnt invent and this has been done before, \nI then also asked to show me something even close to similar to the Touch Bar and even close to the integration that Apple has accomplished with it. Shoey5 \nDidn‚Äôt you say that Apple takes existing (implying not touch touch) ideas and makes it better? Mr Dog \nIs that the only line you read? \nIf you read the rest of the post, you will see it was in context and referring to specifically the Touch Bar in this case. \nI never said Apple is perfect nor that everything they do is brilliant. I am saying that: \nAlthough they did not invent the Touch Bar it‚Äôs implementation is FAR superior to any other Touch Bar because this article is about the Touch Bar and your original post is about the Touch Bar. \nTalking about random other topics is just useless, I can also state random good things that Apple did but it does not prove the point. Shoey5 \nHow is it far superior? Mr Dog \nBecause it is capable of more, out of the box, than any other of the touch bars. \nBecause on release it has more support than any other touch bar has had in the past. \nIt is easily customizable. All other ‚ÄòTouch Bars‚Äô are mostly static with very limited real world uses.Someone has yet to show me a examples of touch bars similar to Apples implementation Shoey5 \nHow is it more capable out of the box?What kind of support does it have over out touch panels?how is it more easily customizable? \nWhat are you comparing it to? Mr Dog \nLOL Ok lets start from the beginning \nYou said: \nLike Most Apple ‚Äúinventions‚Äù it‚Äôs been done before, beyond that concept video there were devices on the market doing it. \nI Said: \nIt has been done before but not the the level Apple Has \nI am assuming when you said ‚Äòit‚Äôs been done before‚Äô. You were referring to other Laptop manufactures that has released laptops with ‚ÄòTouch Bars‚Äô, correct? \nSo now you tell me, which laptops were you referring to that ‚Äòits been done before‚Äô and then I will answer the rest of your questions. Shoey5 \nGood, so now lets be really honest, you talked like an Apple Fanboy with the assumption that it must be better. You then went to check after making your claims, realized there was some very cool implementations so fell back on the laptop ignoring my original post that it‚Äôs been done before. Mr Dog \nNo, I am speaking after researching and seeing that all of them are pretty much useless. \nYou are the one that sounds like your talking out of your a**, because you still have not provided a SINGLE example of a touch bar on existing laptops. \nAnd my reasoning is because you know they are all crap. I do not want to talk about imaginary products that you found, so before we continue this discussion I want to know what Touch Bars you have seen that are similar to this. Because all the ones I have seen do not come even close to competing. Shoey5 \nSorry but I don‚Äôt think you did üôÇ \nThere aren‚Äôt many touch panel laptops you know why, because except for Apple, everyone has a full touch screen‚Ä¶the ultimate touch panel! Don‚Äôt worry if Apple ever decides to release a Macbook with a touch screen, you‚Äôll be raving about it then. Mr Dog \nlol again going off topic and insulting me. \nSo it is settled. Apple‚Äôs implementation of the Touch Bar is worlds superior to what ever existing implementations are out there. Shoey5 \nNo. There are implementations of keyboards that are way cooler. I pointed out that it‚Äôs irrelevant for laptops because they have touch which is far superior and I wasn‚Äôt insulting you, I was merely stating a fact based on your responses which we will be able to confirm once (if) ever Apple decides to eat their words and release a touch screen laptop. Mr Dog \nBut we are not comparing Touch screens to the Touch Bar. Your original statement was that apple did not invent the Touch Bar, so this entire conversation has been about touch bars.If you want to talk about the applications of Touch Screens on Laptops and their advantages and disadvantages we can get to that after as well but do not change the topic because you cant argue the point. Shoey5 \nAnd NO they didn‚Äôt! There have been keyboards configurable touch before Apple and they never went to non-apple laptops because they evolved to full touch screens. Why is this so complicated? The Iceman Cometh \nHe‚Äôs right. Generally they have been very adept at taking existing ideas and concepts and putting them to quite practical use. Perhaps this latest MacBook iteration isn‚Äôt their finest example of such or the removal of a headphone jack on an iPhone but for people like myself who‚Äôve been using BT headphones for the past couple years, it‚Äôs really neither here nor there.If you don‚Äôt like the offerings then don‚Äôt buy them. Shoey5 \nAgree with you in the early Apple resurgence but in recent years, their motivation has been more with appeasing shareholders by finding ways to gouge users due to lagging market share over innovating for the consumers. \nbtw. The age old Apple user mindset, sure they removed the headphone jack but I use BT‚Ä¶.who needs copy and paste‚Ä¶yeah we have copy and paste‚Ä¶.who needs a stylus, yeah we have a pencil‚Ä¶who needs mobile payments I have a wallet‚Ä¶.yeah we have nfc payments‚Ä¶.. üôÇ It‚Äôs Me \nCan‚Äôt have a smartphone without a physical keyboard, ok no physical keyboard. Who needs such a big display, oh the iPhone display is too small. Don‚Äôt need an App Store, oh great we have an App Store. Retina display is a gimmick, oh I love my high density display. No one wants to talk to their phone, I‚Äôm loving google Now. Finger print sensors are a joke, I love using finger print sensor to unlock my phone. Apple Pay is just copying NFC payments we had for years, gee I wish we could use Android Pay or Samsung pay instead of the crappy NFC payments we‚Äôve had for years. Shoey5 \n‚Ä¶.ah nice try but nah It‚Äôs Me \nEach and every one a fact. \nThey are ridiculous though, aren‚Äôt they. Hindsight makes people forget. Shoey5 \nProblem with yours is there were devices before the iPhone got them. Um well except Retina cause that was just a made up marketing term from none other then Apple üôÇ It‚Äôs Me \nIrrelevant really. Whether anyone had them before or not, those were the criticisms of the day, as ridiculous as they seem in hindsight. \nSomethings never change. Shoey5 \nI don‚Äôt recall anyone I know bitching about it, most were saying why are Apple users raving about this stuff, I‚Äôve had it for a while‚Ä¶well except for my Apple fanboy friends. It‚Äôs Me \nReally? Most of your friends had a usable App Store before Apple? Most had phones without physical keyboards before Apple? Most had high DPI before Apple had retina? Most had non-shitty NFC payments they‚Äôd prefer over something usable like Apple Pay/Android Pay/Samsung Pay? Most had usable and not-shitty finger print sensors? Most had displays as large as the original iPhone before the iPhone? \nI‚Äôm not saying these things didn‚Äôt exist before the iPhone, clearly they did. But to even pretend (I hope you are pretending) that most people had them before being introduced on the iPhone is silly. \nLike I said, hindsight is great. People even forget ridiculous criticisms that were made. Shoey5 \nMost of my friends are highly technical and had smartphones long before the iPhone and probably even before you knew what the concept was. And yes there were App stores. And while these things weren‚Äôt as developed as they are today,, they were amazing for the time and manufactured by companies that saw the future long before Apple got involved or it‚Äôs users who seem to re-write history due to lack of knowledge or appreciate for the original innovators who don‚Äôt‚Äô get the credit for what has evolved to today. It‚Äôs Me \nLMFAO. \nI‚Äôm a software developer working for a company that‚Äôs been working with smartphone vendors since before people called them smartphones. I‚Äôm sitting in a former BB building as a write this surrounded by former BB devs. Please don‚Äôt try the ‚Äúmy friends are technical‚Äù BS with me. \nThe fact is that no, none of those were common place, in any sense. Name a few phones pre-iPhone that had App Stores, high DPI, usable finer print and/or NFC payments (on par with Apple Pay, Samsung pay or android pay) or phones without physical keyboards. \nIf you google hard enough, you‚Äôll probably post a few that had one or two but not many. Certainly not enough that most of your friends were all using them. Shoey5 \n‚Ä¶and the fact that you are a software dev and don‚Äôt know this stuff means either ___ \na. You are junior \nb. You are, what my technical friend (and myself) would refer to (in polite terms) not a very good developer. \nc. All of the above. \nie, you should know this stuff already. It‚Äôs Me \nSenior enough to know BS when I see it. If you need to make stuff up you‚Äôve already jumped the shark. Shoey5 \nThat would make it B. Sorry but if you don‚Äôt know this stuff your either too young or not very senior. It‚Äôs Me \nWhat stuff? Your fictional friends that all had fictional phones? Sorry, sure don‚Äôt know that stuff. What‚Äôs the matter, google not bringing up any hits for you try? Try harder. \nDishonesty shouldn‚Äôt be your last resort, let alone your goto response. Shoey5 \nAre you freaking serious! Go look up Palm, Symbian and Windows Mobile, then go look up software repositories (app stores) for those platforms. It‚Äôs Me \nReally? Every one software repositories, not that many were used. Why not claim Usenet ffs? That‚Äôs isn‚Äôt the same as an App Store. The closest one to a usable App Store before Apple was sidekick. I actually don‚Äôt doubt your friends were using that. Seems about the right speed. \nAnd that‚Äôs the best you have? How many had high DPI or displays as large as the original iPhone? How many had no physical keyboard? How many had usable finger print sensors? How many had usable NFC payment system that didn‚Äôt suck? \nYou‚Äôre not even using google right to dig up some semblance of backing up your claim. Shoey5 \nBecause those App Repositories had app categories with both free/paid apps. They were the model for the App stores we have today. Many of those devices didn‚Äôt have physical keyboards and many had larger screens then the original iPhone. \nNone had usable finger print scanners back then (actually I recall a few did (swipe type) none had NFC (wasn‚Äôt evented yet) but you know what, neither did the original iPhone that came out many years after these devices. \nLook, you obviously aren‚Äôt aware of what was available before the iPhone. Based on your responses, you don‚Äôt even have a clue, so why are you even trying? It‚Äôs Me \nPfft, so many that after hours of google searching you sill can‚Äôt nail down even one model. A list of every brand from back in the day doesn‚Äôt say anyway..well, it does say you‚Äôre almost ready to admit you were talking out of your a$$ again üòâ \n‚Ä¶but not quite yet I‚Äôm guessing. \nI get it, you got caught spewing the same BS and you‚Äôre embarrassed. That‚Äôs ok. It‚Äôs expected. Liars never like it when they‚Äôre caught lying. Shoey5 \nI figured you‚Äôd be smart enough to research them and learn something‚Ä¶.and I didn‚Äôt have to look these up because I‚Äôve owned devices from E-Ten, O2, iMate. \nI‚Äôm sorry but you‚Äôre proving that stereo typical Apple user. And you know what‚Äôs really awesome, at some point, old-timers who had these devices are going to read your comments, and shake their head while they have those nostalgic memories of own their devices. It‚Äôs Me \nSo, still can‚Äôt name even a single model? Just more random brands (bonus points for finding obscure brands no one used). It‚Äôs been hours. Can‚Äôt you google even one? I expect you can find at least one, even if it‚Äôs some unit that sold like 3 units, all of them to you and your ‚Äúfriends‚Äù. Can you ask one of your super technical ‚Äúfriends‚Äù on how to use google? They actually do searches really, really well. You should take a course. \nOf those magical brands, which ones, before the iPhone, were you using that had a larger screen than the iPhone (and hopefully capacitive), no keyboard and an App Store? \nThis is getting kind of comical. Shoey5 \nThey were very popular brands capacitive wasn‚Äôt invented yet, they were resistive but a few capacitives hit the market before the iPhone. On top of the fact that you‚Äôre trying to compare specs with devices that were out many years prior, you are being rude, arguing facts without full knowledge of what was even available, and therefore being a typical Apple user. It‚Äôs Me \nThey were very popular brands capacitive wasn‚Äôt invented yet, they were resistive but a few capacitives hit the market before the iPhone. On top of the fact that you‚Äôre trying to compare specs with devices that were out many years prior, you are being rude, arguing facts without full knowledge of what was even available, and therefore being a typical Apple user. \nYou know what, I no longer think you are intentionally lying (completely). Partly I think you are just ignorant. \nCapacitive touch wasn‚Äôt invented yet? Unless your fictional smart phone was made before the 1980s, yeah capacitive touch had been invented. Not commonly used on phones until the iPhone, sure, but certainly invented decades before. \nI‚Äôm not trying to compare to phones that were many years old. That was you genius! You said all your many ‚Äútechnical‚Äù friends were using phones with all these features before the iphone and that even you owned many of these fantasy phones. \nBut now you are whining that it‚Äôs unfair that you brought them up because they were too old to have those features..on that we agree. They were too old before the iPhone. Then everyone jumped on boards. The dim lights then got kind of confused and in hind sight thought all the features that the iPhone brought together were common and popular before. Shoey5 \nI am referring to it as a technology being useable in phones of the era. You are comparing phones, you‚Äôre trying to compare specs NFC, Capacitive of an iPhone to phones released many years prior. And yes, before you even knew it was possible, I was sending emails, rdping to servers, connecting vpn, playing games, keeping notes, ip calcs, packet sniffers, had a voice assistant etc which I downloaded free+purchase from app stores‚Ä¶.P3 something, XDA 2, Something Jam‚Ä¶. It‚Äôs Me \nMore [weak] excuses. To be expected. \nLook if you want to go back, again, to seeing who was more technical back in the day, let‚Äôs do that. Early 90s I was doing my AdvHons math degree in computer science at the best compsci school in Canada. Since then I‚Äôve spend decades working in R&D at some of the most well known tech companies operating in Canada. What were you doing besides playing games and making up stories? \nAll of which is irrelevant. That is to say, mine‚Äôs bigger so stop trying to act like you know something based on nothing. You‚Äôve embarrassed yourself enough for one day. Shoey5 \nMakes it very surprising that you are unware of all this stuff that was happening before the iPhone. Also surprised at your age, thought you were a teenager by your responses and lack of knowledge. My jobs are pretty much cleaning up the f‚Äôups left behind by other people, most of those people think they know everything and in fact usually know nothing. It‚Äôs entirely possible we may have indirectly worked together on the same project. BTW, I did It‚Äôs Me \nIT monkey? I‚Äôm guessing IT monkey. I love when IT monkey get upset that the developers are brighter than them. It‚Äôs like they blame the devs that they weren‚Äôt bright enough to get into a good school. But hey, IT is better than flipping burgers or cleaning toilets, amirite? \nIf we ever worked together I am sure it would have been one of the less successful endeavour (but those can be the most fun too). \nIgnorant of what? You keep making claims but can‚Äôt defend any of them. Shoey5 \nDone coding jobs (not my strong point), networking, infrastructure, design, yes even IT monkey. Also know some really amazing devs friends who also were into smartphones before they became mainstream and when they see your posts, they are going to laugh and laugh and laugh like the guys and gals in your office when you turn around. You do have an office right? Your not one of those people that hangs around in Starbucks pretending he‚Äôs Steve Jobs? Do Do \nSame could be said for fanboys that consider any new iteration created by Apple as a new invention. Specifically Brad whatever his name is (I‚Äôm sure you know him). He said exactly that. In fact I asked him, so using your logic any sku in an apple store is a new invention? He suggested it was because ‚ÄúApple‚Äù did it. If you want look, it‚Äôs posted. Haters are bad, fanboys are worse. It‚Äôs Me \nWhy would I care what Brad said and how does validate making things up? \nBTW, it‚Äôs doesn‚Äôt take a fan boy to point out criticisms that are based on fiction. I get it, you really want everyone to think you are an anti-fanboy. But at least understand the conversation before jumping in. Pointing out dishonesty is never wrong, but it sure seems to be a dog whistle for you. Do Do \nLOL When you point out one negative about apple, ever, ill begin to respect your opinion about apple. Anti fanboy? Yes I‚Äôve proven it reapeatedly. You‚Äôve proven you‚Äôre an apple fanboy repeatedly. Then try to explain that there‚Äôs enough apple haters that your negative apple comments aren‚Äôt needed. From what i can see there‚Äôs fanboys and haters for all these companies. Why do you have no rouble being critical of companies who aren‚Äôt apple? And really you didnt get the point about Brad? Read it again and besides, I‚Äôm not sure youre not the same guys. It‚Äôs Me \nWhat kind of weak willed and insecure person would say things just to prove something to others? \nI get it, I really do. You were previously accused of being a fanboy so you felt the need to prove you aren‚Äôt, even if it means making confused inappropriate accusations. Now it‚Äôs just who you are. \nYou actually remind me a lot of one of my best friends in university, back when he was still closeted. He constantly had to mention that he had a girlfriend at really inappropriate and weird times. He‚Äôs even make accusations about others he thought were also closeted. Thankfully, he eventually outgrew the need to prove something to others. Until he grew up, it was a case of protesting too much. \nHis name was Brian. Is your name Brian? Do Do \nWow I really got to you about being a fanboy if you‚Äôre now suggesting I might be ga$. Lol. And you want talk about ‚Äúweak willed‚Äù? I thought I was debating with an adult about your hypocrisy and you apparently felt the need to call the other guy ga$ even if it was through innuendo because I guess you didnt like being uncloseted about your fanboy embarrassment. With friends like you, I can see why your so called friend wanted to stay in the closet. Anyway, you‚Äôre a fanboy, incapable of critical thinking when it comes to Apple, don‚Äôt like it being pointed out tsk tsk, suc$ on a lemmon or look up your friend Brian and maybe you can work out something else to suc$. It‚Äôs Me \nI didn‚Äôt imply that at all. I implied you were weak willed like he used to be, with a similar insecurity to prove yourself to others. He grew up and stopped trying to prove things to others. He‚Äôs a much happier person now. \nBut keep protesting. I‚Äôm sure you are convincing yourself. \nOr, here‚Äôs a little test. Try going a week, or even a month, without resorting to the last-resort, out of arguments, got nothing to say copout of ‚Äúfanboy‚Äù. See if you can do that. Prove you aren‚Äôt trying to prove yourself. Billy-Ray Boychuk \nYour use of the word ‚Äòinventions‚Äô in your first sentence‚Ä¶? Shoey5 \nPingback: Microsoft was working on a MacBook Touch Bar-type solution back in 1999 | nrt3 () Smanny \nFirst of all the technology wasn‚Äôt even around back in 1999. The fastest chips to drive a display back then came in a number of chips. Not to mention they were huge chips back then. The other thing was OLED displays were not around. Let alone offering the high resolutions that were needed. So to say that Microsoft was working on a touch bar solution is clearly not the same as actually having it. Shoey5 \nWhich makes it even more impressive when a company has the foresight‚Ä¶unlike Apple who just rips off other peoples ideas‚Ä¶not to mention there were keyboards with touch screen included keyboards long before Apple. monkeymo \nToshiba trackpads in 2005 were doing it, they had a dedicated chip that ran the lcd trackpad that had a few features like a calculator, volume control and other dialers AKLC \nI think you misread what they said. 1999, Bathiche envisioned a keyboard with changing action keys on it according to different programs. It wasn‚Äôt until 2009, when they build a prototype of it. Raj Singh \nThe one Microsoft was working on looks better than the one that‚Äôs shipping on Apple‚Äôs new laptops. The strip is way too small and the fact that you have to look away from the screen to register contextual inputs is a fail, in my opinion. Omar \nIt‚Äôs a gimmick, nothing more. Why not just have a full touchscreen on the laptop, like most laptops have now? I guess it wouldn‚Äôt be hipster enough, since everybody‚Äôs doing it.

      "text": "Google Plus \nImage: iStockphoto.com/ktsimage \nOn November 2, 2016, Microsoft made a big splash with the announcement of Microsoft Teams , a chat-based workspace for Office 365. The introduction of this new collaborative workspace environment immediately caught the eye of competitors like Slack . But all of that hype and back-and-forth with Slack may have overshadowed a significant technological feature of Microsoft Teams‚Äîbots. SEE: How to automate the enterprise (ZDNet special feature) Chatty bots Want more about Windows? Read more \nAs a baby boomer and veteran (read old) member of the technology community, I must admit that the idea of working with a far-flung team using a chatting/messaging app sounds awful. But for the younger generation working in a modern enterprise, a chat-based workspace is second nature‚Äîfor lack of a better term, it is their \"natural habitat.\" \nOf course, there is more to Microsoft Teams than just a place to exchange messages. The new workspace leverages other tools found in Office 365, like Skype for Business, Word, Excel, PowerPoint, SharePoint, OneNote, Planner, Power BI, and Delve. All those other apps can be called upon, individually or collaboratively, and then be used to create documents, presentations, reports, or anything else the team needs to create in order to finish the task at hand. \nIf you are used to operating in a chat-based environment, Microsoft Teams is going to provide you with a wealth of productivity tools, all accessible without ever leaving the messaging application itself. But there is one aspect of Microsoft Teams that most of the reporting seems to have glanced over. This new chat-based workspace will take advantage of artificial intelligence and bot technology. \nIn simple terms, a bot is artificial intelligence that can interpret messages in a chatting application and act upon it on your behalf. For example, if someone in Microsoft Teams mentions 2015 sales figures, a bot could read that and automatically display a document with those figures to everyone in the chat session without being formally asked to do so. SEE: Satya Nadella: Software bots will be as big as mobile apps \nThe Microsoft Bot Framework provides the tools necessary to create these intelligent bots and the technology has become a big part to the company's overall business strategy. In Microsoft's vision, the mobile modern workforce operates within the confines of its messaging applications, and if the company's products are going to reach this mobile workforce, they have meet them in their natural habitat. \nBot technology is in its nascent stages now, but this could be the distinguishing feature that separates old-technology software makers from new-age software makers. Who knows, maybe with some help from intelligent bots, an old guy like me might be able to do some work in a chat-based workspace after all. Bottom line \nImage: Microsoft News \nYears ago, it seemed Microsoft was always a step behind whatever modern trend was taking place at the time. But not anymore. Microsoft Teams is another example of the company reading the signs and looking forward to what may be reality instead of trying to catch up to what already is reality. \nThe younger generation joining the enterprise workforce is used to, and very comfortable with, a chat-based environment. By adding integrated support for bots developed by the Microsoft Bot Framework, Microsoft Teams brings another dimension to what is possible now‚Äîand what will be possible in enterprise productivity software in the future‚Äîat least if the younger generation has anything to say about it.

      "title": "Microsoft‚Äôs ReCore part of new wave of games with female stars",
      "text": "There was a time when Joule wasn‚Äôt a woman. No, she was just an idea.\nJoseph Staten, the lead writer on ReCore, remembers that time well. There was an idea at Microsoft, a pitch for a futuristic, desolate video game title, with a star reliant on a handful of robotic companions. It was an intriguing idea, but early on, it never had a lead.\n‚ÄúThere wasn‚Äôt a really solid main character,‚Äù Staten says. ‚ÄúThere was an active discussion going on, whether the lead would be male, female or whether we would give the player choice.‚Äù\nBut the further the development process went, the more apparent it became that a different brand of hero was needed. The robotic companions had been designed, and they kept coming up with ‚Äústock, sturdy‚Äù names for those fellas, Staten says. A different kind of star seemed a necessarily gameplay complement.\nJeremy Lin airballed a layup in his first game with Nets\n‚ÄúWe worked on both player models,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúBut when we finally took another look at the main character, we began to think of somebody who could complement this all-male cast.\n‚ÄúAnd it just turned out that Joule really wound up being the stronger option. She was instantly more iconic. Her green eyes, her orange hair ... she just popped.‚Äù\nJoule popped so much that she became the breakout star of ReCore and the latest in an increasingly long line of female lead characters in video games. And that the development process that allowed her to pop shows how the games industry has evolved to appreciate gender equality.\nOnce upon a time, women were relegated to mostly complementary roles in gaming, but things have changed in recent years. ReCore, a top title on the Xbox One this holiday, is only part of the proof. Elsewhere, Square Enix is re-releasing a 20th anniversary celebration edition of last year‚Äôs excellent Rise of the Tomb Raider, which starred a stronger, more vulnerable and less heavily sexualized version of Lara Croft.\nEarly next year, Sony will release Horizon: New Dawn on the PlayStation 4. Much like ReCore, that‚Äôs an open-world game starring a gritty, independent female lead. And earlier this week, it was announced that Beyond Good & Evil 2, a sequel to a 2003 cult classic starring a photographer named Jade, is officially in development.\nTo hear Staten tell it, the trend isn‚Äôt hugely surprising, although it is refreshing. In truth, gaming has never shunned the female lead character, and those classic Tomb Raider games and a litany of Metroid games starring Samus Aran prove that. But the recent flood of female leads is emblematic of a shift in gaming culture.\n‚ÄúThere are a lot of really great, memorable female characters,‚Äù says Staten. ‚ÄúBut I think generally speaking, industry-wise, there‚Äôs a lot more of a greater comfort in putting the female character front and center. There definitely is a trend, but I haven‚Äôt quantified it.‚Äù\nGame developers aren‚Äôt focused on quantifying the trend either, and for good reason: They don‚Äôt want to bog down the creative process by synthetically filling a certain demographic. There is no aggressive push to suddenly integrate more female leads in an illusory way. Instead, developers, perhaps influenced by greater gender equality in society, are simply more open to the idea of the female lead.\nReCore features Joule, a strong female lead character. (Microsoft) ‚ÄúI try not to think too much about that,‚Äù Staten says. ‚ÄúI think you can get into a really nonproductive state when you‚Äôre designing the game, if you have too many preconceived notions.\n‚Äú(Joule), she grew out of the gameplay requirements of the game, and the story requirements of the world,‚Äù he adds. ‚ÄúBecause she was female, she was a really great complement to this collection of Corebots. For us, it really sprang out of an organic process.‚Äù\nIn ReCore‚Äôs case, that helps make it a better game. Joule‚Äôs presence is no gimmick or marketing ploy, and that becomes apparent early on. Comcept doesn‚Äôt work overly hard to push the theme that Joule is a female. It instead builds her character through her interactions with her Corebots.\nThe aim, says Staten, was to make a good game, not a good game with a female protagonist. The aim was to make a game that everyone ‚Äî including but not limited to the growing audience of female gamers ‚Äî could enjoy.\n‚ÄúEven the best game story can‚Äôt support poor gameplay,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúThe fundamental question players, gamers, and fans always ask: Do I enjoy playing? Do I enjoy talking about this game? If Joule becomes part of that conversation . . . but man, ReCore is ‚Äòsuper-fun to play,‚Äô that‚Äôs the ideal situation.\n‚ÄúAs long as we get that fundamental right mix (of gameplay), then I think the gender is . . . not an afterthought, but it‚Äôs added flavor, added interest.‚Äù\nThat‚Äôs exactly how ReCore works. The exploratory gameplay, the upgrading of CoreBots, and Joule‚Äôs enduring, hardy character all work together.\nSo well that Joule‚Äôs adventures aren‚Äôt done.\n‚ÄúJoule certainly has more stories to tell,‚Äù Staten says.\nTURBO BOOST\nNot all video games are solely for fun. In August, Galxyz teamed up with Popular Science to deliver the Blue Apprentice app, a gaming-style experience that helps teach children science. The game takes youngsters through an interactive gaming-style narrative, and along the way, they‚Äôll learn 45 science-based concepts that adhere to Next Generation Science Standards. It all comes at a cost ($10.95 monthly), although the learning benefits just may be worth the price . . . Final Fantasy XV, which hits stores in November, is a strong departure from Final Fantasy games past, but it‚Äôs shaping up to be a strong title . . . The upcoming Resident Evil title had plenty of issues causing motion sickness on PSVR at E3, but I had no such issues playing a recent build. And with motion sickness concerns out of the way, the game‚Äôs creep factor came through. It‚Äôs old-school Resident Evil, inspired by plenty of classic horror flicks, and it‚Äôs fun.\nTags: video games Send a Letter to the Editor ",

So it should come as little surprise that Microsoft's \"Xbox streaming stick,\" leaked ahead of this June's E3 conference, never arrived.\nThe Chromecast-like dongle, which would let Xbox One owners wirelessly stream games to another TV as well as view streaming entertainment services, was due for production shortly after this year's entertainment expo, according to Windows Central . But instead we got a sneak peek at Microsoft's Project Scorpio console‚Äîwith 6 teraflops of performance for true 4K gaming and high-fidelity VR.\nWhy? Details are scant, Windows Central says, but it could have something to do with the leak of Sony's PS4 Pro , which arrived this month.",

      "text": "Above: Xbox One's dashboard update now includes Cortana voice commands. Image Credit: Microsoft \nNow everyone can try out future Xbox One updates before they launch. \nMicrosoft announced today some big changes to its Xbox Preview Program, which allowed Xbox One owners to test new features for the Xbox One console. The console-maker is rebranding it at the Xbox Insider Program. While the Preview Program was only available to invited players, the new one will be open to all. \nThis will significantly increase the amount of feedback Microsoft will receive on major system updates for the Xbox One, especially compared to its competitor, Sony‚Äôs PlayStation 4 (which still uses a beta program that players have to sign up for and then hope to get invited to join). These updates impact the way the system‚Äôs interface looks and feels while adding major new features. The next Xbox One update is focusing on social features, including new tools to find people to play games with and way to create groups based on similar interests. Allowing everyone to provide feedback can ensure that these changes will please more players when they officially come out. \n‚ÄúMore fans will have the ability to provide feedback directly from their Xbox One consoles,‚Äù Microsoft noted on its Xbox Wire site . ‚ÄúThe Xbox Insider Hub will provide great opportunities to try out games, apps, and other console experiences.‚Äù \nThe Xbox Insider Program also allows for multiple profiles on the same console to join and provide separate feedback on new features. If you‚Äôre already in the Xbox Preview Program, you‚Äôll automatically update to the new service. GB Latest News",

      "text": "Microsoft‚Äôs new to do list app, Project Cheshire, spotted in the wild Posted Facebook speeds up its data center network with the launch of its Backpack switch platform \nAlthough Microsoft bought to-do list app maker Wunderlist back in 2015, the company has been working on another to list app experience, code-named Project Wunderlist, which is now in private beta testing. Not much is known about Microsoft‚Äôs intentions with its new app, but according to a report out today, this simple to do list app will soon be available on iOS, Android and on Windows 10. \nThe app‚Äôs existence was previously known, but a new report from the blog Thurrott.com has some of the first screenshots of what the app looks like in action. \nAccording to the post, Project Cheshire has progressed to beta testing and has been updated with a bit more polish than when it was first spotted earlier this year. But it‚Äôs still not very impressive, at first glance. \nThe images show a fairly bare bones to do list application that lets you create lists, add items, set reminders, and sync your lists across platforms. You can also theme the lists with a basic color picker, and a selection of rather boring banner images. The only interesting feature, really, is that the app can also suggest tasks to add to your list. However, it‚Äôs unclear where this information is pulled from. 2 ",

      "title": "Reduce the LaFerrari's Performance Index in Forza Horizon 3, Now!",
      "text": "by: Nick Amparo target: Turn 10 Studios, Playground Games, Microsoft Studios \nIt's time that the Forza Motorsport and Forza Horizon series go back to being realistic for at least once. The Forza games should be more true to real life, and in this case, the Ferraris do not really perform as well in real life as in the games, which have moved away from realism. The Ferrari LaFerrari is the worst offender in this case, and in real life, it does not even perform better than its competitors such as the McLaren P1 and Dodge Viper ACR especially due to weighing a lot more pounds/kilograms than many of its competitors, so it should receive a drastic Performance Index decrease to have a Performance Index number similar to the 2016 Ford #66 Ford Racing GT Le Mans and Lamborghini Veneno.The Forza games have always shown the Ferrari LaFerrari's weight as 3,031 lb (1,375 kg). However, this is completely incorrect. In real life, according to a test drive/review by Motor Trend in April 2015, the LaFerrari really weighs 3,495 lb (1,585 kg), meaning it is already a lot heavier than most of its rivals:- Lamborghini Veneno (3,363 lb, 1,525 kg)- Pagani Huayra BC (2,685 lb, 1,218 kg)- McLaren P1 (3,296 lb, 1,495 kg)- Koenigsegg Agera (3,164 lb, 1,435 kg)- Koenigsegg One:1 (2,998 lb, 1,360 kg)- 2016 Dodge Viper ACR (3,368 lb, 1,528 kg)- Hennessey Venom GT (2,743 lb, 1,244 kg) - the Venom GT's weight is still incorrectly shown as 2,685 lb (1,218 kg) in-game.The only hypercars the LaFerrari would be lighter than are:- Porsche 918 Spyder (3,692 lb, 1,675 kg)- Koenigsegg Regera (3,589 lb, 1,628 kg)- Lamborghini Centenario LP 770-4 (3,527 lb, 1,600 kg)- Lamborghini Aventador LP 750-4 SV (3,867 lb, 1,754 kg)- Lamborghini Aventador LP 700-4 (3,977 lb, 1,804 kg) - the Aventador LP 700-4's weight is still incorrectly shown as 3,472 lb (1,575 kg) in-game.Additionally, in real life, as proven by a test by TheSUPERCARDRIVER on YouTube, the LaFerrari does not even do 0-186 mph in 15 seconds like Ferrari claimed. In fact, the McLaren P1 is faster to 160 mph and beyond. Also, in part 2 of 3 of the same test by TheSUPERCARDRIVER, the LaFerrari is not even faster than any of its competitors in any type of drag race, especially the quarter mile, where it is slower than the Lamborghini Hurac√°n LP 610-4.According to Road & Track, the 2015 Chevrolet Corvette C7 Z06 can do 0-200 mph in 26 seconds, faster than both the Ferrari LaFerrari (untested time, but above 28 seconds) and Porsche 918 Spyder (29.7 seconds) yet slower than superior cars such as the McLaren P1 (23.3 seconds) and Hennessey Venom GT (15.3 seconds). Road & Track attempted a 0-200 mph run for the LaFerrari but gave up as soon as the transmission blew out and the driver nearly died, a testament to the car's unreliability, which hampers its performance.Chris Harris on Cars's hypercar test at Portimau Circuit in Portugal in December 2015 (available on YouTube) has also shown that not only does the LaFerrari have worse handling than the McLaren P1 and Porsche 918 Spyder due to its high weight of 3,495 lb (1,585 kg), but on top of that, it already achieves slower lap times than any of its competitors partly due to having less torque than them; the P1 actually has 723 lb-ft (980 Nm), while the 918 Spyder has 944 lb-ft (1,280 Nm) (shown as 829 lb-ft (1,124 Nm) in the games).Due to its curb weight of 3,495 lb (1,585 kg), the LaFerrari, as mentioned, already has worse handling than its competitors; in fact, the Koenigsegg One:1 actually handles much better than any of the \"Holy Trinity\" hypercars and Lamborghini's top-end hypercars like the Veneno and Centenario.In Forza Horizon 3, the LaFerrari's top speed is completely wrong. In real life, no road-legal Ferrari can do at least 249 mph (400 km/h). The only Ferrari officially capable of exceeding that speed would be the non-road legal Ferrari FXX Evoluzione, introduced in 2009. Sources have pointed to a better, more reasonable top speed of 230~233 mph (370~375 km/h), while the McLaren P1 does not do 217 mph (350 km/h), but instead at least 245 mph (394 km/h). As a reference, the fastest car with a naturally aspirated engine is still the McLaren F1, with 240 mph (386 km/h) achieved in 1998 using the XP-5 prototype, while the fastest cars with forced induction engines (e.g. supercharged or turbocharged) are the Hennessey Venom GT, with 270.49 mph (435.31 km/h), the Bugatti Veyron Super Sport, with 267.856 mph (431.072 km/h), and the Koenigsegg One:1, with 273 mph (440 km/h).The LaFerrari's Performance Index in Forza Horizon 3 is as follows:Speed: 9.6",

      "text": "\nMicrosoft has moved to block mobile satellite-service provider Globalstar‚Äôs attempt to repurpose their satellite spectrum into a terrestrial Wi-Fi network, complaining to the FCC that the signals on the 2.4 Ghz spectrum was causing issues for the discontinued Xbox 360S and its connection to its wireless controllers.\nMicrosoft was not the only one complaining, with Sony and Nintendo, via the Entertainment Software Association, noting GlobalStar‚Äôs Terrestrial Lower Power Solution is ‚Äúlikely to have a profound negative impact on consumers‚Äô use and enjoyment of video game consoles by interfering with communication signals between the controller and the game console.‚Äù\nThey also noted that ‚ÄúTLPS could also cause significant harm to other consumer uses of the 2.4 GHz band, including hearing aids with Bluetooth and similar wireless features.‚Äù\nGlobalstar, who have already demonstrated an experimental network to the FCC in 2015 by supplying internet connectivity to a Washington school, said Microsoft‚Äôs opposition was based on biased experimental results.\n‚ÄúThe opposition‚Äôs methodology included an extreme test setup and technical parameters that would never occur in any real world deployment‚Äù Globalstar Chief Executive Jay Monroe told investors during a Nov. 3 conference call. ‚ÄúOn the contrary, when interference testing is conducted using accurate real world designs as we did and [as] we submitted in our Ex Parte, [coexistence] has been confirmed in multiple tests and various environments in the past, which are also on the record.‚Äù\nThey claimed Microsoft‚Äôs tests were ‚Äúflawed‚Äù and ‚Äúappear to have been expressly designed to generate such harmful effects.‚Äù\nGlobalstar has said opening up this spectrum for its TLPS service could provide more capacity for congested public wireless networks, but besides Microsoft the company has also seen opposition from the cable television industry‚Äôs CableLabs, the Consumer Electronics Association, mobile satellite-service competitor Iridium Communications, and others.\nGlobalstar‚Äôs Monroe said gaining FCC approval remains the company‚Äôs No. 1 priority and concluded ‚Äú‚Ä¶ that TLPS can easily coexist with unlicensed operations. We trust that the commission will look past these absurd tests from those with obvious competitive interests.‚Äù\nRead more about the drama at Spacenews.com here .\n",

      "text": "By Rich Woods Neowin LLC @@TheRichWoods ¬∑ 4 seconds ago with 0 comments \nEarlier today, Microsoft introduced the Skype Insider Program . The idea is the same as the company's various other preview programs, in that it will allow users to test out pre-release versions of the app and provide feedback on it. \nIf you sign up for the Program, you'll have the option for preview builds for macOS, iOS, Android, or Windows. All that was released today were builds for the former three operating systems. \nHere's what's new in Skype for Mac version 7.40 (7.40.76.158): updated options tabs for call forwarding and voicemail emoticon search enabled update message for partially blocked users i.e. update message to help user to fix the account \nThere's also a known issue: Screen share of a single window will crash the client. \nFor Skype for iOS version 6.28.106 (6.28.76.106), the changelog is much less exciting: Bug fixes \nFinally, Skype for Android provides a rather cryptic changelog: #716761:HA TOP CRASH: android.text.PackedIntVector.getValue \nIf you want to sign up for the Skype Insider Program, you can do so right here . Aside from the four choices of platforms that it offers, there's also a section to write in an option, with suggestions such as Linux and Xbox. \nIf you're looking for previews of Microsoft's UWP Skype Preview app, you'll need to be a Windows Insider on the Fast ring to get them. The last update for that app was released on October 27. Tags",

      "text": "Tweet SAN FRANCISCO -- Structure 2016 -- Unless you're scrutinizing hypercloud providers with a microscope, they look the same: Massive data centers located all around the world, on which businesses can run... whatever they want. Given those similarities, why should a user choose Microsoft Azure over, say, Amazon Web Services? \nThe answer: Azure is specialized for enterprise needs, Scott Guthrie, executive vice president of Microsoft Corp. (Nasdaq: MSFT) Cloud and Enterprise Group, said in a presentation here on Tuesday. \nMicrosoft has global presence, with 38 cloud regions around the world, more than Amazon Web Services Inc. and Google (Nasdaq: GOOG) combined, Guthrie said. Microsoft Man Microsoft's Scott Guthrie talks cloud with Fortune's Barb Darrow . \nIt's trusted, providing security and more compliance certifications than any other cloud vendor, Guthrie said. \nAnd it provides hybrid connectivity to use Azure in conjunction with other clouds and on-premises cloud, he said. \nAbout 90% of the Fortune 500 is running production software on Azure, Guthrie said. And software vendors that target the enterprise are running their cloud applications on Azure, including Adobe, SAP and DocuSign. \nAs part of Azure's hybrid capabilities, Microsoft this week announced support for Kubernetes orchestration, in addition to previously supported Mesosphere DCOS and Docker Swarm. That allows users to deploy applications that use containers in whatever framework they prefer, and scale and manage them. Amazon and Google have their own preferred orchestration tools; \"our point of view is let's support all of them,\" Guthrie said. And as new orchestration technologies emerge, Microsoft will support those too. \nOne of Azure's strengths is it allows enterprises to extend their existing Microsoft software infrastructure and expertise into the cloud, Guthrie said. But Azure isn't just for Windows. Azure supports Linux, and more Linux VMs are being created on Azure than Windows Server VMs; the percentage of non-Windows non-Microsoft workflows is increasing. \n\"We don't want to be the cloud for Microsoft workflows or Windows server workflows. We want to be the cloud for every workflow,\" Guthrie said. \nMicrosoft's focus on security and compliance helps it appeal to enterprises in general, and regulated industries in particular, he said. \n\"In regulated industries, no one wants to be first and no one wants to be last,\" Guthrie said. \nFrench bank Societe Generale signed on to Azure in May; it was the first globally systematically important financial institution (GSIFI - pronounced \"gee siffy\") to go to the cloud. GSIFIS are the biggest banks in the world, regulated both nationally and internationally, Guthrie said. Now, over 75% of the large banks around the world are Azure customers, and government, public sector, military and every sector is now adopting cloud. \nHybrid cloud is driving demand for Azure, Guthrie said. Organizations more than five years old have a huge infrastructure investment they can't afford to rip and replace \"whether they like it or not,\" Guthrie said. Microsoft is already in data centers with its technology; for example, 94% of identity systems use Microsoft Active Directory. Hybrid cloud connects infrastructure, data, identity, security management, business and productivity apps across premises and the public cloud, and Microsoft has software at all those layers, which can run in Azure, on-premises or other environments. \nAre you a service provider executive who wants to learn more about the impact of web-scale competition on the communications sector? Join us for Light Reading's third annual 2020 Vision Executive Summit taking place in Rome, December 6-8. our events team to find out if you qualify for a VIP pass. \nMicrosoft needs to differentiate; it trails far behind leader Amazon Web Services Inc. in market share. According to recent market research, AWS has well more than half the infrastructure as a service (IaaS) market, more than Microsoft, IBM and Google combined. (See Amazon Bigger in IaaS Cloud Than Microsoft, Google & IBM Combined .) \nOf the major IaaS providers, Microsoft and IBM are both specializing in the enterprise hybrid cloud market, with IBM focused on delivering cognitive computing through its Watson cloud service. \nGoogle's differentiator isn't 100% clear. However, Urs H√∂lzle, Google's senior vice president for technical infrastructure, hinted at a possibility in a presentation prior to Microsoft's: Delivering specialized, high-performance cloud services as Moore's Law returns slow and performance becomes more valuable. (See Google's H√∂lzle: Moore's Law Slowdown Drives Cloud Demand .) \nRelated posts:",

Do not follow links provided by unknown or untrusted sources. Never follow links provided by unknown or untrusted sources. Set web browser security to disable the execution of script code or active content. Since a successful exploit of this issue allows malicious code to execute in web clients, consider disabling support for script code and active content within the client browser.

The Microsoft Selfie app is designed to consider lighting, gender, age and skin tone to determine the extent of enhancement needed to make the picture look better naturally with just one click. However, this app by the tech giant is not a new thing, as it had been unveiled on Apple devices quite some time back. Microsoft Selfie app is now available for Android phones in the Google Play Store. \nWith the rise of the selfie craze and going strong, this move by Microsoft might work out good for the company as well as for the consumer. The app essentially uses machine learning to learn from its surroundings and adjust its settings accordingly while clicking the photograph making is better. The app can brighten or darken a scene accordingly and also reduce noise in a picture. Still, if you are not happy with the one click result, you can always manually change the filters by sliding them across the screen and make the change you want to see. Apart from the selfies clicked in real time, the app also works for pictures stored on the Android smartphone. \nThe app was launched in Apple iOS version in December last year and received good reviews from users. It remains to be seen how the app functions on the Android platform. Yes, it is a free app. Interestingly, the Selfie app is also available on desktops so you can edit your selfies on a PC too. If you use the app, let us know how you found it, in the comments section below. Please Wait while comments are loading... Trending Now ",

      "text": "Gentlemen, Patch Your Windows: Microsoft Releases Critical Security Updates GO Redmond publishes 14 security bulletins, 6 of them critical Nov 9, 2016 06:34   Microsoft has released a total of 14 security bulletins as part of this month‚Äôs Patch Tuesday cycle, with six of them considered to be critical and targeting all Windows versions on the market. First and foremost, we have MS16-129 , which is a cumulative security update for Microsoft Edge patching a Remote Code Execution (RCE) flaw that would allow an attacker to gain the same privileges as the logged in user when a malicious website is loaded. Then, it‚Äôs MS16-130 , a security update for Microsoft Windows, which also patches RCE flaws that ‚Äúcould allow remote code execution if a locally authenticated attacker runs a specially crafted application.‚Äù MS16-131 is a critical patch that resolves vulnerabilities in the operating system that can be exploited with arbitrary code targeting Microsoft Video Control. MS16-132 is a security update for Microsoft Graphics Component fixing vulnerabilities that can be exploited when a malicious webpage is loaded, causing the Windows Animation Manager to improperly handle objects in memory. A successful attack allows hackers to install programs, view and delete data or even create new accounts with administrator rights. Last but not least, there‚Äôs MS16-141 (security update for Adobe Flash Player) and MS16-142 for Internet Explorer, with the latter targeting all supported versions of the browser at the moment. The Google-disclosed security flaw In case you‚Äôre looking for the patch aimed at the Google-disclosed Windows vulnerability, this is MS16-135 and is only flagged as important, which is a little bit unexpected given the fact that exploits have already been spotted in the wild. ‚ÄúThis security update resolves vulnerabilities in Microsoft Windows. The most severe of the vulnerabilities could allow elevation of privilege if an attacker logs on to an affected system and runs a specially crafted application that could exploit the vulnerabilities and take control of an affected system,‚Äù Microsoft says. All patches are available right now via Windows Update, and critical ones should obviously be prioritized, but IT admins should keep in mind that system reboots are required, and work needs to be saved. We‚Äôre not aware of any botched updates at the time of writing this article, but we‚Äôll continue monitoring the forums and let you know should anything be reported.",

      "text": "Gears of War 4 review: A reboot done right \nMicrosoft‚Äôs secretive in development to-do app, codenamed Project Cheshire, has been moved into private beta according to a new report . The app appears to be significantly more refined than when images of it were first leak and the report also re-confirms rumors of the app being built in the Universal Windows Platform app format (which is to be expected for a Microsoft app) and that iOS and Android versions are being designed simultaneously. Here are some of the screencaps from the leak. Microsoft‚Äôs Project Cheshire. Image Credit: Thurrott.com \nProject Cheshire (working title) is a fairly barebones to-do app but is also the sort of app that Microsoft doesn‚Äôt yet have on Windows 10, made by themselves anyway. OneNote does provide similar functionality, as do the new Sticky Notes Windows 10 app , but neither is as streamlined as this new upcoming app. Project Cheshire is currently available in the Windows Store, but as the phrase ‚Äòprivate beta‚Äô suggests, access is limited. \nLet us know what you think. Are you interested in Project Cheshire or do you prefer a current solution? Share your thoughts with the community in the comments below.",

      "title": "Creating Azure WebJobs",
      "text": "Posted by Gavin Lanata on November 7th, 2016 Vote! Tweet \nSince Microsoft introduced their App Services option in Azure, which includes Web Apps, Mobile Apps, and more. There's been a great deal of choice when it comes to what you want, and how much control you'd like to have. \nOn one hand, you have a virtual machine; it's fully controllable, and can be built upon and worked to you heart's content. However, this comes at a price. Maintenance, configuration, and security come to mind. Now, these might be things you need to have complete control over; but, if it's just a Web site you need, with all the standard requirements, this could be overkill. This is where Web Apps come into play. Azure takes over all the heavy lifting, and all you need to do‚Äîespecially if you're using Visual Studio‚Äîis to publish your Web app, and maybe pass it an environment setting or two. \nHowever, there is a problem with this approach. When it comes to a VM, you can very easily drop some other applications in there, too. These could be simple console applications or a Windows service; all have the task of performing some regular maintenance on data, as an example. They run on a separate process to your Web application, making better use of system resources. \nSo, the question you might have is‚Ä¶ Can we do the same with Web apps, which don't allow you direct access to the VM they are running on? \nThe answer to that question is yes, and the answer comes in the form of Azure WebJobs. Creating a WebJob \nThere are several file types that Azure will accept for WebJobs. These include the following‚Ä¶ \n.cmd, .bat, .exe, .ps1, .sh, .php, .py, .js, and .jar \nFor this article, we'll stick with .exe and create a standard .NET C# console application in Visual Studio. Before I show you the code I have in my console application, I want to bring your attention to the WebJobs SDK. For this article, our WebJob will be very simple, but in a real application of this technology, you will certainly need more. The WebJobs SDK allows you trigger your jobs under several circumstances, one of them being a job trigged by a message from Azure Queues. \nYou may find the SDK here . It can be installed through NuGet, with a search for Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs . Given that setting up the SDK will take a little more time than what we have for in this article, let's look at the code in our application. class Program { static void Main(string[] args) { DisplayTime(); } public static void DisplayTime() { Console.WriteLine(DateTime.UtcNow.TimeOfDay); } } \nIt's very simple; we're going to output the time to the console this application was run at; then, it will exit. But, before we ship this application off up to our Azure Web site‚Äîand you will need at least a free Web instance‚Äîwe're going to add one small detail. \nBuild your application, which for me gave this result in the bin folder. \nFigure 1: The build output \nNow, along with that output, add another file named settings.job . And, using a simple text editor, add the following‚Ä¶ { \"schedule\": \"0 */1 * * * *\" } \nThis is a CRON expression, if you aren't familiar with it. It will be used to schedule the frequency of the execution of our WebJob. The previous expression dictates that our WebJob will trigger on every minute. If you would like to know more about CRON expressions , you can find a detailed description here. \nMoving on, now package your application, along with the settings.job , into a zip like so‚Ä¶ \nFigure 2: The output packed into a zip, along with the settings.job file Deploying the WebJob \nAs we mentioned before, you'll need an active Web App running in Azure to complete the remainder of this article. A free instance will be sufficient; and, if you navigate to your Web app and select WebJobs from the navigation menu, you'll end up with what I'm looking at here‚Ä¶ \nFigure 3: Our Web app's empty list of WebJobs \nClick 'add' at the top. This will present a form to you like below. I've already filled in the settings as an example. \nFigure 4: The complete add WebJob form \nThere are a few options for some of the drop-downs, but the settings we'll use for this article will be Type: Triggered and Triggers: Manual . Click Okay, which should be at the bottom, and Azure will take the needed time to add the WebJob to your instance. Once it's completed, you'll see the WebJob in the list. For me, it looks like this‚Ä¶ \nFigure 5: The added WebJob \nNote that the 'Status' above is currently reading Ready ; it won't remain that way for long. As you should recall, we specified a schedule in our settings.job file; it can be seen in Figure 5 under 'Schedule'. Give it a few minutes, hit refresh, and you'll see that the 'Status' changed to Completed Just now . \nBut, that doesn't tell us much, nor can we see the current time we chose to output in our code. To see this, select your WebJob in the list, and click the Logs button at the top. This will navigate you to a different Web page, from where you can see logged information about your WebJob. I've given at least six minutes since I deployed my job, and my log currently looks something like this‚Ä¶ \nFigure 6: The information logged by our WebJob \nIf you then click the timings of any of those logged runs, you will be presented with the console output; and ultimately, the time we wanted to see produced by our code‚Ä¶ \nFigure 7 : The console output from our WebJob \nIn Figure 7, second item from the bottom, you can see the output from this line of code‚Ä¶ Console.WriteLine(DateTime.UtcNow.TimeOfDay); \nGranted, this is a very simple example, but we can see how easy it is to deploy a WebJob, which runs in the background in a separate process from our Eeb site. Put it in a prime position to perform heavy lifting tasks, or just regular data clean ups. \nIf you were to add the WebJobs SDK, you can bring in more of what Azure has to offer; for example, storage, queues, and more. While keeping in with the semi manage environment of Azure App Services, you can have the best of both the freedom to add more than just a Web app, but allowing Azure to take care of the maintenance and upkeep of the VM itself. \nIf you have any questions on this article, you may find me on Twitter @GLanata.

      "text": "How to get started with Microsoft Teams In its first release, admin setup is easy but user distribution requires more work More like this Use commas to separate multiple email addresses From Your message has been sent. Sorry Comments \nMicrosoft has formally unveiled Teams, its long-rumored competitor to the popular Slack and Atlassian HipChat business messaging platforms . So how do you enable it in your organization? \nAssuming you have an Office 365 plan that includes Teams (most do), go to your Office 365 portal‚Äôs Admin settings, click the Services & Add-ins option, scroll down to the Microsoft Teams option (shown in Figure 1), click it, and set the switch to On. You‚Äôll then get a variety of settings to choose from; the default is for all options to be enabled with the exception of bots. [ The InfoWorld Deep Dive: How to make document sharing really work in Office 365 . ] \nFigure 1: Enabling Microsoft Teams in your Office 365 portal. \nWhen you set up Teams, there‚Äôs the default General team already created for you; you can also enable existing Office 365 groups as Teams groups from the admin portal. Admins can create the first team channel in that portal as well. (Figure 2 shows the Teams channel controls for admins.) Users can create their own channels after that, unless IT disables that permission in the Office 365 portal. \nFigure 2: The admin console for managing Teams channels and members. \nEnabling it is the easy part. Now, you need to get your users to work with Teams, but they‚Äôll have to find it first. \nRight now, Teams doesn‚Äôt show up in users‚Äô App Launcher at office.microsoft.com for direct download (that‚Äôs coming, Microsoft says), but Windows and MacOS can download the Teams app today from Microsoft‚Äôs download page, and iOS, Android, and Windows Mobile users can download it from their respective app stores. It‚Äôs also available in the major web browsers at teams.microsoft.com . \nAs many as 600 people can engage in any individual Teams conversation, but Teams at this point does not support external users‚Äînot even guests you‚Äôve allowed in an Office 365 group enabled for Teams. I expect Microsoft to fix that mismatch (which also occurs in Microsoft Planner ) at some point. \nAs you‚Äôd expect with any messaging system, Teams supports emojis, gliphies, and memes. But it can disable those if such notions don‚Äôt fit your corporate culture. You can also impose stricter controls on users‚Äô options for content ratings. \nIf an organization has Slack or HipChat, why would it switch to Teams? The obvious reason is that Teams is part of the Office 365 you‚Äôre likely already paying for, so why pay extra for a third-party tool? The other differences are more subtle, but could matter to IT. \nTeams is designed to be managed and controlled by IT, whereas Slack and HipChat don‚Äôt require IT to manage them‚Äîor even set them up. That can make adoption more organic, but it raises governance issues. \nAlso, Slack (but not HipChat) is truly private‚Äîno admin or service owner can see direct messages or the contents of private groups. That‚Äôs a positive for users who want to collaborate honestly without fear of corporate reprisals, but it makes e-discovery and, in many regulated industries, legal compliance impossible. It‚Äôs unclear at this point whether private communications in Teams are visible to admins, notes Rich Campagna, senior vice president for products at information security vendor Bitglass. \nAlso, because it is built on Office 365 Groups, Teams supports Office 365‚Äôs e-discovery and legal-hold capabilities, Campagna says.

      "text": "Microsoft continues to advance its strategy of providing the best tools for developers to build any application for any platform, and the results seem positive. Microsoft continues to advance its \"Any Developer, Any App, Any Platform\" strategy to attract developers to the company's rich suite of developers tools. The company that was founded on the premise of connecting with developers knows the value of maintaining that relationship, and part of that today is providing support for open-source software and allowing developers to use the programming languages and platform they are comfortable with. Next week, Microsoft will host its Connect(); developer conference in New York, where the company will lay out the next steps in its developer journey. Julia Liuson, corporate vice president of the Visual Studio and .NET Framework teams at Microsoft, said at Connect(); the company will \"talk about the next wave of the Microsoft developer platform and services, and how our tools and services will bring a connected end-to-end story from client tools, to DevOps, to an intelligent cloud.\"In a post in the Microsoft Developer Network (MSDN) magazine, Liuson said she believes that now is a great time to be a .NET developer as the .NET ecosystem is thriving.\"With the acquisition of Xamarin , you can now write native C# apps for any mobile platform‚ÄîiOS, Android or Windows‚Äîin any version of Visual Studio, leading to a higher percentage of code sharing across your apps,\" Liuson said. \"And with the release of .NET Core 1.0 in June, we've brought you a cross-platform, open source, and modular .NET platform that's designed to help you target the needs of modern applications‚Äîhighly distributed apps, componentization with microservices, and isolation with containers.\" Microsoft acquired Xamarin earlier this year to give its developers a platform that enables developers to build mobile applications using C# and deliver native mobile app experiences on iOS, Android and Windows devices. Tim Huckaby, founder and chairman of InterKnowlogy, a software consultancy and longtime part of the .NET ecosystem, told eWEEK , \"A year ago the bold promise of Xamarin was not being fulfilled. It was buggy and lacked core features. Cut to today, it's an awesome toolset we cannot live without. We don't even build native mobile anymore.\" Moreover, Huckaby said that a year ago developers were paying a load of money to Xamarin for licensing fees. \"What is the first thing Microsoft did?\" he asked. \"They made it free. Brilliant. That is the adoption story. That is what is getting those young developers back to Visual Studio.\" Liuson noted that .NET Core, .NET Compiler \"Roslyn,\" ASP.NET, Visual Studio Code, Xamarin and TypeScript are all open-source projects. She also said GitHub's recently published 2016 statistics show Microsoft as the No. 1 leader in open-source contributors, above Facebook, Docker and Google, with 16,419 unique contributors. And Visual Studio Code , Microsoft's lightweight text editor for Mac OS X, Linux and Windows, is in the top 10 repositories on GitHub with the most open-source contributors, at more than 5,855. \"I see developers coming back to Microsoft in droves,\" Huckaby said. \"This whole open-source everything has gained a huge amount of excitement and respect from those who were lost.\" Carl Franklin, executive vice president at App vNext, agrees with Huckaby, noting that not long ago Microsoft had lost some of its cach√© with developers because of its strictly Windows stance, but that has changed. \"There may have been good reasons not to embrace .NET five years ago, but everything has changed in favor of it,\" Franklin said. \"ASP.NET Core has surpassed Node in performance. Azure makes it easy and affordable to leverage cloud computing. Microsoft continues to push its offerings into open source. The list goes on and on.\" Page 1 of 2",

      "text": "How the Stylus Doomed Microsoft's Phone Business How the Stylus Doomed Microsoft's Phone Business 10 Comments History will show that the stylus was the one thing that kept Redmond from replicating the success of the iPhone. \nIn a wide-ranging interview, Steve Ballmer this week was asked to explain what went wrong with Microsoft's smartphone business. He pointed to skepticism over iPhone carrier subsidies, but I have another idea. \nAs someone who was burned by the iPhone, I know why Microsoft screwed up. Since I was unable to secure any hands-on time with the iPhone prior to its release, I based the criticial columns I wrote about the device (April 2007: The iPhone Can't Live Up to Its Hype ) on the fiasco I saw with Microsoft phones. \nOnce I got my hands on an iPhone, my tune changed fast; I had to admit the device was a world changer. Not so for Microsoft; Ballmer had nothing good to say. It was peculiar. What was Ballmer not seeing? \nI am now convinced it had to do with Ballmer's personality and nothing more. Steve Ballmer, I will argue, is a neat freak. He is organized. Button down. He may yell and scream and seem slovenly, but really, he's just boisterous. \nHe probably had a Palm Pilot with a stylus, which were all the rage back in the day. When you visited many random Silicon Valley corporate headquarters, the reception desk would have a bowl of free styli for you to take, compliments of the house. \"Take a few\" was a common refrain; I still find them randomly around my house. \nUnlike the rest of us, Ballmer is probably the type of guy who never lost his stylus and scoffed at the notion of a touch-screen iPhone. Thus, he could not really understand its genius. // Related Articles Microsoft Can't Afford to Abandon Windows Phone \nJust look at how long it took to get the first true Windows phone to market. The company could have easily re-jiggered the old software by enlarging the icons and getting rid of the stylus, but no. There were obviously philosophical debates going on about the stylus and other features. Microsoft had already partnered with Sony and Ericsson and could have followed the path that Google took with Android to quickly release a mobile OS. It already had software",

      "text": "\nWindows 10 Mobile has picked up a new update. Microsoft today started rolling out the update, build 14393.448 to the public ‚Äî however, it only includes some bug fixes and presumably some security improvements. Microsoft is yet to provide an official changelog for the update, but we will update the article when the changelog is available. Microsoft recently provided a changelog for Windows 10 Build 14393.447 ‚Äî so the changelog for the latest build shouldn‚Äôt look any different than the following:\nImproved the reliability of multimedia audio, Remote Desktop, and Internet Explorer 11. Addressed issue that prevents users from connecting to a virtual private network (VPN). Addressed issue with a scheduled task that doesn‚Äôt run in Task Scheduler after reenabling. Addressed issue to update the Access Point Name (APN) database. Addressed issue with Japanese characters that are missing when converted by the Input Method Editor. Addressed issue with the system tray showing no Wi-Fi connection even when Wi-Fi is present. Addressed issue with Windows devices that disconnect from the Internet prematurely before users can complete their paid Wi-Fi purchase. Addressed issue to update the new Belarusian ruble symbol to Br and the new ISO 4217 code to BYN. Addressed additional issues with multimedia, Windows kernel, packaging release management, authentication, Microsoft Edge, Internet Explorer 11, Remote Desktop, Active Directory, wireless networking, Windows shell, graphics, enterprise security, and Microsoft HoloLens. Security updates to Boot Manager, Windows operating system, kernel-mode drivers, Microsoft Edge, Internet Explorer 11, Microsoft Virtual Hard Drive, Common Log File System driver, Microsoft Video Control, Common Log File System driver, Windows authentication methods, Windows File Manager, and the Microsoft Graphics Component. If you are a Windows 10 Mobile user, you can install the latest update by heading over to Windows Update. If you don‚Äôt see the update, you might have to wait a little while depending on your region and the carrier you are using.",

      "text": "\nMicrosoft today released Windows 10 Build 14965 to Insiders in the Fast Ring, adding a couple of improvements and some bug fixes. The new build includes some new features, including a virtual touchpad, improvements for Sticky Notes, Windows Ink improvements, and more.\nHere‚Äôs the full changelog:\nWHAT‚ÄôS NEW \nWhat‚Äôs new Controlling external monitors from tablets just got easier (PC): You can now drive content on a second display from your tablet without ever having to attach a mouse. The virtual touchpad lets you do more with a tablet and a second screen ‚Äì just connect to another monitor, PC, or TV, go to Action Center and tap on the ‚ÄúProject‚Äù Quick Action to extend your screen. Use it just like you would a physical touchpad to control content on the connected screen. To enable it, press and hold on the taskbar and select ‚ÄúShow touchpad button‚Äù. A touchpad icon will now appear in the notification area (just like Windows Ink Workspace does), and tapping on it will bring it up the virtual touchpad.You‚Äôve seen the work we‚Äôve been doing for precision touchpad customization with the last few builds, and the virtual touchpad is no exception. While the virtual touchpad is open, go to Settings > Devices > Touchpad and you‚Äôll be able to tweak the touchpad settings to your preferences. Sticky Notes update (PC): Windows Insiders in the Fast ring will receive will receive Sticky Notes app update to version 1.2.9.0 today and we‚Äôre very excited to share what it includes!\nWe‚Äôve expanded our support for Insights to many more languages and regions, with even more to come in further updates, stay tuned! Specifically, with this version: We‚Äôve added flight detection for Germany (Germany), in more English locales (Canada, Great Britain, India, Arabia), Spanish (Spain & Mexico), French (France, Canada), Italian (Italy), Japanese (Japan), and Portuguese (Brazil). We‚Äôve added email & URL recognition for every locale (except Chinese (simplified or traditional), Korean, or Japanese, which we‚Äôre still working on). We‚Äôve added phone number recognition to all English, German, Spanish, French and Italian locales. We‚Äôve added address recognition support for English (Great Britain) and Spanish (United States). We‚Äôve added time recognition (prompting to create a Cortana reminder) to English (Great Britain), English (Australia) and English (India). We‚Äôve added stock recognition (for example, $MSFT) to English (Australia), English (Canada), English (India), German (Germany), Spanish (Spain), Spanish (Mexico), French (France), French (Canada), Japanese (Japan) and Portuguese (Brazil). If Insights in Sticky Notes isn‚Äôt turned on automatically for you, tap ‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Äù > Settings gear > ‚ÄúEnable insights‚Äù. Note: The language and region used to detect Insights in Sticky Notes is based off of the active keyboard. We‚Äôre currently investigating some issues where Insights may not show up as expected if you switch keyboards while typing in Sticky Notes. We‚Äôve fixed some issues with Undo and Redo (CTRL + Z/CTRL + Y) while typing, so they‚Äôll now do so more reliably. We‚Äôve improved the performance of text input while typing. It‚Äôs now easier than ever to get the latest Sticky Notes app updates. When our next update is available, we‚Äôll show an in-app prompt so all you have to do is click ‚ÄòUpdate‚Äô. We‚Äôve also done a whole lot of UI/UX polishing and performance improvements that we hope you enjoy. We‚Äôre been making a bunch of improvements based on your feedback, and have more to come, so let us know what you‚Äôd like to see next! In recent versions of Sticky Notes, we‚Äôve added support for many of your favorite keyboard shortcuts, including CTRL + B (bold), CTRL + I (italic), CTRL + N (new note) and CTRL + D (delete note), added a new context menu for easy copy/paste, reduced the minimum note size for typists, as well as generally improved our reliability and performance.\nWindows Ink Workspace Improvements (PC): This build includes a number of improvements to the Windows Ink Workspace.\nWe increased the number of Recently Used apps shown in the Windows Ink Workspace to 6, and added a link to quickly access your pen settings. We‚Äôve improved the performance of loading Sketchpad when there‚Äôs a lot of ink present on the sketch. We‚Äôve updated the new protractor, so that you can use the scroll-wheel on your mouse to shrink/expand it (depending on the direction of the scrolling). We fixed an issue where, when using Sticky Notes in the Windows Ink Workspace, the background would ding when tapped. We fixed an issue where inking and resizing the protractor at the same time would result in Sketchpad crashing. We‚Äôve updated the ‚ÄúPen & Windows Ink‚Äù Settings for pen users to now include a link to the handwriting training tool ‚Äì simply click on ‚ÄúGet to know my handwriting‚Äù to launch it. We‚Äôve also improved how we learn from your handwriting samples ‚Äì try it out and let us know what you think! Enhancing the Address Bar in Registry Editor (PC) : We were really excited to hear how excited you were about the new address bar in Registry Editor, and based on your feedback, we‚Äôve already incorporated two new features:\nYou can now use CTRL + L to set focus to the address bar ‚Äì while we already supported ALT + D, we recognize that some people prefer this keyboard shortcut instead, so now you have the option to use either one You can now use shorthand notation for HKEY names ‚Äì you told us that when sharing registry paths you always use shorthand notation (HKCU) instead of typing out the full HKEY name (i.e. HKEY_CURRENT_USER), so we should support them in the address bar, and you know what? We agree! You can now just use ‚ÄúHKCR‚Äù, ‚ÄúHKCU‚Äù, ‚ÄúHKLM‚Äù, and ‚ÄúHKU‚Äù instead of typing or pasting the respective full name ‚ÄúHKEY_CLASSES_ROOT‚Äù, ‚ÄúHKEY_CURRENT_USER‚Äù, ‚ÄúHKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE‚Äù, or ‚ÄúHKEY_USERS‚Äù into the address bar. Improving Your Hyper-V VM experience (PC) : Following the new VM scaling options mentioned in last week‚Äôs build , we‚Äôve fixed an issue where depending on the zoom level selected, the VM window might not be created large enough to avoid scrollbars, despite their being enough space for it. We also updated the logic so that when you pick a particular zoom level, that zoom level preference will be preserved for the next VM connection. Along the way, we fixed an issue where the title bar of a maximized VM window would be occluded when taskbar had been set to on top.\nWHAT‚ÄôS FIXED \nWhat‚Äôs fixed For Mobile: \nWe fixed an issue where, when using Cortana in French (France or Canada), the ‚ÄúPrendre une <photo/video/selfie>‚Äù (take a picture, video, or selfie) command was redirecting to a Bing search rather than opening the Camera app as expected. We fixed an issue resulting in Cortana crashing if you typed ‚ÄúCreate an appointment‚Äù then tapped on the resulting suggestion to ‚ÄúCreate an appointment‚Äù. We improved the performance for English (India) text prediction. We fixed an issue in Data Usage Settings, where after selecting the data plan to be unlimited, it would still prompt to set a limit. We‚Äôve also made it easier in the Data Usage Settings for those with dual SIM phones to differentiate between the cellular data use on each SIM, and fixed a few other polish issues, including that the sort by dropdown on the Usage Details page was unexpectedly wide. We fixed an issue where Narrator wasn‚Äôt giving feedback when adjusting sliders, for example in Settings, or in the Volume flyout. We fixed a migration issue resulting in Microsoft Edge to fail to launch for some Insiders after updating to a new build. For PCs: \nWe have fixed the issue causing Internet Explorer to crash a few seconds after launch. We fixed an issue where, when using Cortana in French (France or Canada), the ‚ÄúPrendre une <photo/video/selfie>‚Äù (take a picture, video, or selfie) command was redirecting to a Bing search rather than opening the Camera app as expected. We‚Äôve made some graphics improvements so the system will now respond better when WIN + L is pressed while playing a full screen game. We‚Äôve updated the ALT + F4 Shutdown dialog to better respond to DPI changes when connected to an external monitor. We also fixed an issue where the tooltips for the taskbar notification area items would be incorrectly sized after a DPI change until rebooting the machine or otherwise signing out and back in. We‚Äôve fixed an issue where File Explorer might crash when creating or renaming a folder on a network share. We fixed an issue resulting in the text on the Outlook Calendar tile on the Start menu being slightly fuzzy. We fixed an issue where deleted files might reappear in File Explorer with a 0 byte size. We fixed an issue resulting in a Windows Default Lock Screen window sometimes appearing after logging in. We fixed an issue resulting in File Explorer crashing after right-clicking an app in Task Manager and selecting ‚ÄúOpen File Location‚Äù. We‚Äôve updated our migration logic so that going forward from Build 14965, preferred UAC settings, startup shortcuts, and File Explorer folders that had been pinned to the Start menu will all now be preserved across upgrades. We fixed an issue resulting in vertical lists written in XAML, such as those found in Groove Music, unexpectedly animating in from the side. We fixed an issue resulting in Cortana crashing if you typed ‚ÄúCreate an appointment‚Äù then clicked on the resulting suggestion to ‚ÄúCreate an appointment‚Äù. We fixed an issue where in Microsoft Edge, after cancelling a file download, the progress bar for the next file downloaded might appear to be stuck at the point at which the old file‚Äôs download was at when it was cancelled. We fixed an issue that could result in the Japanese Input Method Editor (IME) periodically showing the candidate window in the upper left corner of the desktop and not being able to enter text into the Office 2016 apps and some other text editors. WHAT‚ÄôS BROKEN. \nWhat‚Äôs broken For PCs: \nDouble-clicking on an Excel document to open it from File Explorer will crash Microsoft Excel. The workaround is to open the document from within Excel. Microsoft Studios games like Microsoft Sudoku, Jigsaw, Minesweeper, Taptiles, and Treasure Hunt may freeze at the splash screen on launch. For Mobile: \nIf you used the previous ‚Äòdate change‚Äô workaround to update to Build 14951 or Build 14955: Please don‚Äôt use it any longer! The Microsoft account (MSA) ticket on your device needs to expire and then you‚Äôll be offered today‚Äôs build. If you changed your date by 30 years‚Ä¶ you‚Äôll want to do a device reset. You will be unable to install additional languages, keyboards, and speech packs on your phone for the next few weeks. If you have existing languages, keyboards, and speech packs installed ‚Äì they will carry over when you update to new builds. You just can‚Äôt install any new ones. If you do a hard reset of your phone on these builds ‚Äì you will also be unable to install additional languages, keyboards, and speech packs. You can use Windows Device Recovery Tool to go back to Windows Phone 8.1 or Windows 10 Mobile, install any languages, keyboards, and speech packs you need and then update to the latest build in the Fast ring as a workaround.

      "text": "MSFT Stock: What‚Äôs Happening at Microsoft, Post-Trump Win? By Stephen Karmazyn   What to Do with Microsoft Stock and Other Tech Darlings? \nMicrosoft  MSFT) saw MSFT stock, like many other popular tech stocks, take a small hit on Wednesday following the election of Donald Trump as   States of America. \nMSFT stock has otherwise celebrated a fairly prosperous 2016, rising three percent overall but, on Wednesday morning, the shares took a 0.5% tumble. This coincides with declines in the share prices of many tech giants, including Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) stock‚Äôs one percent drop , Tesla Motor Inc ‚Äòs (NASDAQ: TSLA ) four percent fallout, and Apple Inc.‚Äôs (NASDAQ: AAPL ) one percent skid . \nThe question is whether these relatively small hitches in share prices from MSFT stock, TSLA stock, GOOG stock , and AAPL stock are small jitters in the market following the election of a unpredictable president, or predict greater losses as the market bounces around after the unexpected win of President-elect Trump. \nA couple of caveats to mention, however, before we go full doomsday-prepper over Microsoft stock in particular, and the stock market in general. \nThe market often has slight fluctuations following the election of a new president. That‚Äôs par for the course and, historically, the market usually corrects itself back to the norm in short order. And beyond that, the first few years of a presidency rarely (as seen in the above linked article) dramatically shift the trends of shares in the near future. \nOf course, presidential actions can and often do have a tremendous effect on the shares in the long term but, again, the trends before the election are often the best indicators of where a stock is headed in the following weeks and months. \nNow, back to the doomsday scenarios, namely, if everything else about the 2016   has been so contrary to norms, why not market trends as well? Andy why wouldn‚Äôt it be bad for MSFT stock? \nTo support that line of thinking, you have the dire predictions from the Brookings Institution, a non-partisan think tank, which predicts a 10% to 15% market loss. (Source: ‚Äú What do financial markets think of the 2016 election? ‚Äù The Brookings Institution, October 20, 2016.) \nAnd then there‚Äôs the Financial Times which, while having more conservative estimates than Brookings, also projects significant losses in the market. (Source: ‚Äú So how would markets react if Donald Trump wins? ‚Äù Financial Times , November 4, 2016.) \nSo while history would say to be confident in the stability of the market, there‚Äôs certainly a fair number of people out there who think otherwise. They believe that time, history might not know what‚Äôs talking about, and that Microsoft stock might turn out fine.",

      "title": "Microsoft brings Sticky Notes‚Äô intelligent features to Insiders outside of the United States in Windows 10",
      "text": "\nWith the Windows 10 Anniversary Update, Microsoft released a brand-new Sticky Notes app. The new Sticky Notes app was a lot like the old one, but it includes a pretty neat feature which brought Cortana and Bing integration to your sticky notes. The feature, which Microsoft simply calls ‚ÄúInsights‚Äù essentially allows Cortana and Bing to intelligently detect the key information in your notes and be able to provide help based on that. For instance, if you note down a flight number in Sticky Notes, Bing will be able to provide more details about the flight right in Sticky Notes.\nAs I noted in my review of the Windows 10 Anniversary Update , the Insights feature doesn‚Äôt work if you live outside of the United States. Thankfully though, Microsoft is finally bringing this feature to users outside of the United States, starting with Windows Insiders. If you are a Windows Insider in the Fast Ring, you‚Äôll be able to get the latest update for Sticky Notes from the Windows Store which brings some of the intelligent features based on where you live.\nGallery For example, Microsoft is bringing the Flight Detection feature in Sticky Notes to users in the United Kingdom, India, Germany, and some other countries. The company is also bringing Stock Recognition to users in Canada, Australia, India, and more. Here‚Äôs a full breakdown:\nWe‚Äôve added flight detection for Germany (Germany), in more English locales (Canada, Great Britain, India, Arabia), Spanish (Spain & Mexico), French (France, Canada), Italian (Italy), Japanese (Japan), and Portuguese (Brazil). We‚Äôve added email & URL recognition for every locale (except Chinese (simplified or traditional), Korean, or Japanese, which we‚Äôre still working on). We‚Äôve added phone number recognition to all English, German, Spanish, French and Italian locales. We‚Äôve added address recognition support for English (Great Britain) and Spanish (United States). We‚Äôve added time recognition (prompting to create a Cortana reminder) to English (Great Britain), English (Australia) and English (India). We‚Äôve added stock recognition (for example, $MSFT) to English (Australia), English (Canada), English (India), German (Germany), Spanish (Spain), Spanish (Mexico), French (France), French (Canada), Japanese (Japan) and Portuguese (Brazil). Keep in mind that these features are only available to Windows Insiders for now, but Microsoft will likely roll these out to other users pretty soon. If you happen to be a Windows Insider in the Fast Ring, you can get the latest update for Sticky Notes from the Windows Store right now.\nWP-Appbox: Microsoft Sticky Notes (Free, Windows Store) ‚Üí \n",

      "text": "By Martin Hendrikx Updated October 01, 2016 . \nWhenever you ‚Äúcut‚Äù or ‚Äúcopy‚Äù content in Microsoft Office, it gets stored on your computer‚Äôs clipboard. Use Microsoft Office‚Äôs clipboard for more features and ease of use. \nUnlike the computer clipboard, the Microsoft Office clipboard stores the last 24 pieces of content and images, not just the most recent. With the items on the clipboard, you can easily copy and paste into other documents and programs. It‚Äôs quite nifty! How to Access the Clipboard \nYou can access the clipboard by highlighting the text or graphic you want on the clipboard and copying it (right-click then click on ‚ÄúCopy‚Äù or ‚ÄúCtrl + C‚Äù ). You can also cut as well (right-click then click on ‚ÄúCut‚Äù or ‚ÄúCtrl + X‚Äù). This will copy the content to both your computer‚Äôs and Microsoft‚Äôs clipboards. If you have other things you want cut or copied to the clipboard, repeat this process with other text and graphics. The last 24 things you cut or copied will be available on Microsoft‚Äôs clipboard. You will also notice that a pop-up at the bottom-right corner of your desktop will show a notification that you copied items to the clipboard. \nNow to open the Microsoft clipboard. While in Microsoft Word, go to ‚ÄúHome‚Äù then click on ‚ÄúClipboard‚Äù and you will see a pop-up window. Right-click and paste or press ‚ÄúCtrl + V‚Äù to paste the contents to the Windows clipboard. To paste it to the Microsoft clipboard, click on the content in the clipboard window. \nNote: If you want the clipboard window to be separate from Microsoft Word, click and hold the Clipboard title bar and drag it to where you want it to be. You can always drag it back into its original position using the same manner. \nOnce a clipboard item is highlighted, click the down arrow to delete it. \nRemember that you can copy and paste content from other programs to the Microsoft Office clipboard. Try it with text and graphics from Notepad, Wordpad, Paint, etc. Once the content is in your clipboard, click in the Word document where you want to paste it and then click on the clipboard item to paste it there. Retrieve All Content and Paste in your Document \nTo paste all the clipboard items into a Word doc simultaneously, just click the ‚ÄúPaste All‚Äù option in the clipboard window. The items will be pasted in the order they were copied, and they will be pasted as one big paragraph (you can‚Äôt reorder the items, sorry!) Customizing the Clipboard \nYou can change some clipboard options by clicking the blue check mark next to a particular option. For example: Automatically Show the Clipboard : Not a default option, but it makes the clipboard window appear when you copy more than one item. Press ‚ÄúCtrl + C‚Äù Twice to Display Clipboard : Simply press ‚ÄúCtrl +C‚Äù twice in a row to make the clipboard window appear (this isn‚Äôt a default option). Collect But Don‚Äôt Show Clipboard : This feature allows you to copy items to your clipboard without making the clipboard window appear. Don‚Äôt worry; just because you can‚Äôt see it doesn‚Äôt mean the content wasn‚Äôt copied. Display Clipboard on Taskbar : This default option displays the clipboard on the Windows taskbar as long as the clipboard is active. When Copying, Show Status Near Taskbar : On by default, this option makes a notification pop-up appear when you copy or cut content to the clipboard. Empty your Clipboard \nWhether you copied content that you dont want others to see or you just want to try clearing out your clipboard's cache, you can do so in a few simple steps. If you want to delete all the items from your clipboard, simply click ‚ÄúClear All‚Äù. Hit the ‚ÄúX‚Äù button to close out the clipboard window. The clipboard content will remain on the clipboard until you close out all of your Office programs (or delete the content). An alternative to the clipboard is the Spike, which is featured in another tutorial . Be sure to check out our tutorial on how to move and copy content in Microsoft Word without altering the clipboard!",

      "text": "By Mary Bellis Updated February 01, 2016 . \nOn August 12, 1981, IBM introduced its new revolution in a box, the \" Personal Computer \" complete with a brand new operating system from Microsoft, a 16-bit computer operating system called MS-DOS 1.0. What is an Operating System \nThe operating system or`OS is the foundation software of a computer, that which schedules tasks, allocates storage, and presents a default interface to the user between applications. The facilities an operating system provides and its general design exerts an extremely strong influence on the applications created for the computer. IBM & Microsoft History \nIn 1980, IBM first approached Bill Gates of Microsoft , to discuss the state of home computers and what Microsoft products could do for IBM. Gates gave IBM a few ideas on what would make a great home computer, among them to have Basic written into the ROM chip. Microsoft had already produced several versions of Basic for different computer system beginning with the Altair , so Gates was more than happy to write a version for IBM. \ncontinue reading below our video Should I Buy my House or Continue to Rent? Gary Kildall \nAs for an operating system (OS) for an IBM computer, since Microsoft had never written an operating system before, Gates had suggested that IBM investigate an OS called CP/M (Control Program for Microcomputers), written by Gary Kildall of Digital Research. Kindall had his Ph.D. in computers and had written the most successful operating system of the time, selling over 600,000 copies of CP/M, his operating system set the standard at that time. The Secret Birth of MS-DOS \nIBM tried to contact Gary Kildall for a meeting, executives met with Mrs Kildall who refused to sign a non-disclosure agreement . IBM soon returned to Bill Gates and gave Microsoft the contract to write a new operating system, one that would eventually wipe Gary Kildall's CP/M out of common use. \nThe \"Microsoft Disk Operating System\" or MS-DOS was based on Microsoft's purchase of QDOS, the \"Quick and Dirty Operating System\" written by Tim Paterson of Seattle Computer Products, for their prototype Intel 8086 based computer. \nHowever, ironically QDOS was based (or copied from as some historians feel) on Gary Kildall's CP/M. Tim Paterson had bought a CP/M manual and used it as the basis to write his operating system in six weeks. QDOS was different enough from CP/M to be considered legally a different product. IBM had deep enough pockets in any case to probably have won an infringement case, if they had needed to protect their product. Microsoft bought the rights to QDOS for $50,000, keeping the IBM & Microsoft deal a secret from Tim Paterson and his company, Seattle Computer Products. Deal of the Century \nBill Gates then talked IBM into letting Microsoft retain the rights, to market MS-DOS separate from the IBM PC project, Gates and Microsoft proceeded to make a fortune from the licensing of MS-DOS. In 1981, Tim Paterson quit Seattle Computer Products and found employment at Microsoft. \n\"Life begins with a disk drive.\" - Tim Paterson",

      "text": "  \nOnce again, Microsoft is ringing its cloud computing bell as the company attempts to pivot and transition towards a cloud services enterprise. \nA long-standing tent pole of Microsoft‚Äôs push into cloud computing involves the use of its services in the research arena and the company is now offering a new tutorial to researchers looking to leverage the cloud. \nFrom Azure to web apps to Linux Virtual Machines, Microsoft‚Äôs Azure 4 Researcher contributing author Dr. Kenji Takeda walk researchers through the process of using Azure . Watch this short video about the Azure portal , which is the easiest user interface. There is also a command-line interface for Linux, Mac and Windows, as well as language APIs for Python, Java, and other languages. Follow this Azure storage hands-on tutorial that will take around 30 mins. This is important so you understand how to easily work with files and storage, which is one of the most useful features of the cloud. Launch your first Azure virtual machine (VM) ‚Äì a remote workstation in the cloud. There are a number of pre-built images (VMs with software pre-installed). A good one to start with is the Linux Data Science VM also the Windows version here . You can create a basic VM (e.g. Ubuntu Linux) and install whatever software you like by following these instructions . We suggest that you start with a small VM (A1) to get started while you are getting to grips with the basics. You can easily rebuild/reboot a bigger VM (many cores and large memory) once you are familiar with the environment. Try the Jupyter Notebooks-as-a-Service on Azure. They are free, executable and shareable over the web. Organize your notebooks and datasets in one centralized location. Libraries are saved automatically and can be viewed from any device, anywhere. These are a great way to do research in a reproducible way. You can start from scratch or upload your existing notebooks to Azure at https://notebooks.azure.com . Explore Azure Machine Learning that is a complete end-to-end, easy to use, web-based system to experiment with your own machine learning algorithms. It makes it easy to test and deploy machine learning models, including with your own Python and R code using standard libraries like Sci-Kit Learn. There are many walkthroughs and tutorials to get you started. See https://studio.azureml.net/ \nTakeda continues on encouraging those interested in more Azure information to check out a few more Azure for Research video walkthroughs . \nThe Azure for Researcher blog promises more videos and tutorials to come that focus on helping those transitioning to the use of cloud services in the near future.

      "text": "New Microsoft To-Do List App Reportedly Enters Private Beta   Jay Decenella \nWhile Microsoft maintains a good footing in the productivity apps domain following its acquisition of Wunderlist in June of last year, the company does not seem to be resting on its laurels yet. A new report from Thurrott highlights the software giant has been busy working on a new to-do list app codenamed ‚ÄòProject Cheshire‚Äô. According to the report, the new productivity app from Microsoft has now entered private beta, which means a full-fledged version is inching near to a release. \nThere is little information about the app at the moment, save for the expected fact that it is supposed to let users create lists of tasks or items that can be marked off once completed. You can also supposedly set reminders and sync your lists across multiple platforms using the app. The app offers the option to add a theme to your list with a simple color picker and banner images. But what makes Project Cheshire interesting, is its ability to suggest tasks for your list. To compare, Wunderlist allows users to share files, assign tasks to individuals, discuss items with contacts and publish lists online. \nProject Cheshire was spotted in the wild more than six months ago. Since then, the app seems to have gone though a slight makeover including the addition of new features and enhancements to the user interface on Windows 10. The app‚Äôs rather simple design is what Microsoft believes to be Project Cheshire‚Äôs appealing factor. Project Cheshire is reportedly set to arrive on the iOS and Android platforms soon, though it is not clear when the full launch will take place. On the Windows App Store, where the app has already gone live, the Redmond giant bills the to-do list tool as an ‚Äúincredibly focused, to-do app that helps you get things done.‚Äù \nAlthough the app is not complete yet, it looks like Microsoft is putting more emphasis on fine-tuning the beta version to make the software as easy to use as possible when the full version rolls out. It remains unclear, however, whether Microsoft plans to keep Project Cheshire alongside Wunderlist or whether they plan to replace the existing to-do list app altogether. You can see a few images which are reportedly of the new app in the gallery below. Post navigation",

      "text": "Posey's Tips & Tricks Does Microsoft Love Linux Too Much? The integration of the open source platform in many facets of Microsoft means that Windows IT pros may need to update their skill sets. By Brien Posey 11/08/2016 \nA few years ago, I received a rather alarming e-mail. I had just woken up and hadn't even had a chance to have a sip of my energy drink when I was jolted awake by what I read. The e-mail appeared to be a confidential, internal Microsoft memo discussing the creation of Microsoft Linux. An attached product roadmap showed Microsoft eventually phasing out Windows Server in favor of Linux. Just as I was about to reply to the message, the cobwebs cleared from my sleep-deprived brain just enough for me to remember that it was April Fools' Day. The memo was nothing more than an elaborate April Fools prank. Had I read the memo more carefully, I would have realized that it even concluded with the words April Fools. \nAdmittedly, the fake memo seemed somewhat implausible at the time. Since then, however, reality has begun to resemble the prank. Microsoft has gone all in on Linux. Windows Server 2016, for example, supports Docker containers. If you need more evidence, then consider the fact that the Windows 10 \"Anniversary\" update includes a full Ubuntu-based Bash shell that you can use to run Linux software directly on Windows. According to Wired Microsoft has even gone so far as to create its own Linux build, although according to the article the build is used internally to power networking hardware. \nMy point is that when Satya Nadella proudly proclaimed that Microsoft loves Linux, he obviously meant it. As such, the question then becomes what Microsoft's new found love of Linux means for Windows and for Windows admins. \nSome of the people that I have talked to in recent months have made apocalyptic predictions regarding the future of Windows. In their eyes, Linux is becoming the new standard and the transition away from Windows has already begun. While I don't necessarily buy into these predictions, I do believe that they contain at least an element of truth. Here is how I see the situation. \nFirst off, it is impossible to deny that a higher percentage of servers are running Linux today than just a few short years ago. Linux has become a mainstream operating system. It is also impossible to deny that Microsoft has openly embraced Linux. Even so, I think that Windows is here to stay, at least for the foreseeable future. Here's why. \nThere are way too many mission critical business applications that run on Windows. If Microsoft were to abandon its investment in Windows Server, then it would also be abandoning the software that is designed to run on Windows Server. Much of this software is made by Microsoft. \nNow just to play devil's advocate, Microsoft could conceivably reengineer Visual Studio so that applications that were specifically designed for Windows Server could be seamlessly recompiled for Linux. Even so, the cost to application vendors, including Microsoft, would be astronomical. Applications that are already used in production would have to be completely retested and revalidated. Never mind the cost of moving complex multi-tier applications off of Windows and on to Linux. \nDon't get me wrong. I'm not saying that there will never be a Linux transition. It's just that I think that such a transition will take an entirely different form. My guess is that we will eventually see Windows and Linux merged together, much like the way that Bash and Windows 10 have been merged together. \nIt is impossible to know for sure what such a merger might look like, but my guess is that Windows will become even more modular than it already is and that administrators will have the option of installing the environments that they prefer. These environments could potentially be exposed as server roles. An administrator might for example, have the option of installing the Linux role, the Windows role, or perhaps even both. \nOne of the big questions about Microsoft's love of Linux that I have yet to hear anyone ask is how Linux support will impact the Microsoft certification exams? Take SQL Server, for example. The certification exams for SQL Server have long had a reputation for being difficult. Recently however, Microsoft announced SQL for Linux. Does this mean that those who will be taking a SQL Server exam will need a solid working knowledge of both Windows and Linux, or will Microsoft offer two different, platform-specific exams? The answer remains to be seen. \nUltimately, I think that we will have to wait and see how the whole Linux / Windows thing plays out. In any case, Microsoft continues to invest heavily in Windows Server, and I just don't foresee Windows Server going away any time soon.

      "title": "Here‚Äôs what Trump‚Äôs win means for Apple, Microsoft and Facebook",
      "text": "Here‚Äôs what CEOs Tim Cook, Satya Nadella and Mark Zuckerberg had to say about it. Apple \nOne of the biggest concerns for the Cupertino giant is how new policy might affect production. \nIn the run-up to the election, Trump voiced his desire for the Big A to rely less on foreign manufacturers and transition to building its products locally ‚Äì a stance he‚Äôs upheld even prior to his foray into politics . \nWhile it remains unclear whether Trump has any intentions to follow up on these comments, his forthcoming entrance to the White House later in January is worrisome to many at Apple. \nIn the immediate aftermath of the election, Tim Cook sent out an internal memo company-wide, reassuring employees that ‚ÄúApple‚Äôs North Star hasn‚Äôt changed‚Äù and urging them to ‚Äúmove forward together‚Äù despite opposing political affiliations. \nWhile the iPhone -maker CEO opted not to go into too much detail about policy and other implications of the electoral outcome, what‚Äôs particularly intriguing is that Cook made no explicit mention of Trump‚Äôs name or his previous comments. \nRead his full statement (as obtained by BuzzFeed ) below: \nTeam, \nI‚Äôve heard from many of you today about the presidential election. In a political contest where the candidates were so different and each received a similar number of popular votes, it‚Äôs inevitable that the aftermath leaves many of you with strong feelings. \nWe have a very diverse team of employees, including supporters of each of the candidates. Regardless of which candidate each of us supported as individuals, the only way to move forward is to move forward together. I recall something Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. said 50 years ago: ‚ÄúIf you can‚Äôt fly, then run. If you can‚Äôt run, then walk. If you can‚Äôt walk, then crawl, but whatever you do you have to keep moving forward.‚Äù This advice is timeless, and a reminder that we only do great work and improve the world by moving forward. \nWhile there is discussion today about uncertainties ahead, you can be confident that Apple‚Äôs North Star hasn‚Äôt changed. Our products connect people everywhere, and they provide the tools for our customers to do great things to improve their lives and the world at large. Our company is open to all, and we celebrate the diversity of our team here in the United States and around the world ‚Äî regardless of what they look like, where they come from, how they worship or who they love. I‚Äôve always looked at Apple as one big family and I encourage you to reach out to your co-workers if they are feeling anxious. \nLet‚Äôs move forward ‚Äî together! \nBest, Microsoft \nMicrosoft CEO Satya Nadella was equally calculated when he addressed Trump‚Äôs triumph. \nNadella took it to recently acquired LinkedIn to congratulate the newly-announced President-elect and assure employees Microsoft‚Äôs goals and ambitions haven‚Äôt changed. \nHere‚Äôs Nadella‚Äôs full statement: \nYesterday we witnessed the democratic process in action here in the US. The results are of importance around the world, and I know that interest is shared among Microsoft employees. We congratulate the president-elect, and look forward to working with all those elected yesterday. Our commitment to our mission and values are steadfast, and in particular fostering a diverse and inclusive culture. \nWhile, in a similar fashion to Cook, Nadella refrained from engaging into politics, he also linked to a blog post by Microsoft chief legal office Brad Smith. \nTitled ‚ÄúMoving forward together: Our thoughts on the US election,‚Äù the piece treads relatively lightly, but does touch upon Trump‚Äôs anti-immigration policies, emphasizing Microsoft‚Äôs varied employee base as well as devoted committment to diversity. \nThings get a little more interesting when Smith approaches the issue of policies on technology and business. \nDespite its generally diplomatic tone, Microsoft reminds of its readiness to stand up to administration and fight for ‚Äúclearer and more modern‚Äù policy and laws, pointing out it has previously done so on a number of occasions. \nWe‚Äôre committed to developing technology that is secure and trusted, both for Americans and for people around the world. We literally have thousands of employees who make this their focus and priority. And we know that we‚Äôll benefit from stronger government policies as well. That‚Äôs why we‚Äôve not only advocated for clearer and more modern U.S. laws, but have filed lawsuits four times in the past three years against the current administration, standing up for what we believe are the vital rights of people both here and abroad. As we‚Äôve won the cases we‚Äôve brought, we‚Äôve been reminded of one of this country‚Äôs greatest strengths, its strong Constitution, independent judiciary, and the overarching rule of law. Facebook \nNo different than Cook and Nadella, Mark Zuckerberg adopted an identically optimistic and neutral attitude in his statement on the results of the election. \nThe Facebook boss appealed to citizens and employees by asking them to remain devoted to creating ‚Äúthe world we want for our children,‚Äù further adding this cause is ‚Äúbigger than any presidency.‚Äù \nZuckerberg chose not to address earlier accusations Facebook faced for distributing a slew false stories, which might have in turn shifted the electoral outcome in favor of Trump. \nAlthough the Facebook CEO steered away from controversy, a company spokesperson acknowledged the platform‚Äôs crucial role in the election earlier in a statement to Bloomberg on Wednesday. \nWhile Facebook played a part in this election, it was just one of many ways people received their information and one of the many ways people connected with their leaders, engaged in the political process and shared their views. \nFor whatever reason, Zuckerberg didn‚Äôt veer into the impact Trump‚Äôs win might have on Facebook. What does that all mean? \nWell, not much at this point. \nStill, given Trump‚Äôs prolonged critique of the tech industry and his advocacy of policies that might very well have negative repercussions for the future of the sector, the passive tone in each and all of these statements strikes me as odd, to say the least. \nPolitics is a touchy issue ‚Äì especially when your words reach millions of people. And while I understand the motivation behind the reserved approaches Cook, Nadella and Zuckerberg all took, I still wish they spoke out more openly ‚Äì regardless of their personal political believes. \nOver the last few years, Apple has been much more verbal about its political leanings under Cook‚Äôs guidance, but it doesn‚Äôt seem to be the case this time around. \nWhen Sillicon Valley cried out in distress following Trump‚Äôs presidential triumph, Apple elected to play it safe ‚Äì and so did Microsoft and Facebook.",

      "text": "It‚Äôs always been difficult trying to find the right category for Microsoft‚Äôs hybrid tablet/laptop Surface Book. And now with the new Surface Book i7 in hand, it‚Äôs even harder to figure out just what square hole to put this round peg into.\n\nBefore we get too far into the review, let me say that the Surface Book i7 is incredibly fast for a laptop in its class, offering no less than twice the performance of the original Surface Book, which itself outstripped all others in its day. Even better, it has stupidly long battery life that bests all the laptops we‚Äôve tested.\n\nDone. Fini. Move along, right? Well, not quite. The world isn‚Äôt the same as it was a year ago and the Surface Book i7‚Äôs competitors have been hard at work too, and there are aspects of Microsoft‚Äôs hybrid device that aren‚Äôt perfect.\n\nTo read this article in full or to leave a comment, please click here",

      "text": "\nMicrosoft have finally confirmed that they will be bringing the Xbox One S over to Japan. So far, their slimmer Xbox One revision had not been launched or even confirmed for the island nation. However, during an event held today at the Toranomon Hills Forum venue in Tokyo, Microsoft confirmed that the Xbox One S will be available in Japan very soon.\nHow soon? Try two weeks from now. Microsoft have confirmed that the Xbox One S goes on sale in Japan on November 24. The price will be 34,980 yen for the Xbox One S 1TB bundle with Halo 5: Guardians . Microsoft undoubtedly hope that the Xbox One S will revive the flagging fortunes of the console in the territory much has it has in the rest of the world- if only to a smaller degree.\nYou can check out the Japanese launch trailer for yourself below. What impact Xbox One S has in Japan remains to be seen.\n",

      "title": "Here's what's new in the Xbox App for the Holiday Update",
      "text": "By Rich Woods Neowin LLC @@TheRichWoods ¬∑ 5 seconds ago \nMicrosoft released the second part of the Anniversary Update for the Xbox One today , calling it the Holiday Update. Version 1610 contains a number of new features - such as Clubs, Looking for Group, and Arena - but there's also a major update coming to the Xbox App. \nThe changes that Microsoft outlined are for the Windows 10 version of the app, but you'll find that some of the features are also available on other platforms where the Xbox App is available, being iOS and Android. Here's what's new for Windows 10 PCs and phones: \nClubs on Xbox Live: Clubs are gamer-created and managed groups that can help you meet people and grow communities of gamers who love the same things you do. Anyone can join or create a Club, and you‚Äôll probably see a Club for just about everything. As a Club member, you‚Äôll be able to set up parties, play games, share content, and easily communicate using voice and text chat with the Club across Xbox One and the Xbox app on Windows 10. Check out our tutorial video on Clubs here. \nLooking for Group on Xbox Live: Looking for Group (LFG) helps you quickly find other players that you want to game with. You can use LFG to help complete daily quests, Achievement hunt or even get a group together to annihilate hordes of the Swarm and DeeBees in Gears of War 4. Quick and easy. Whether you‚Äôre playing on Xbox One or Windows 10 PC, you can quickly find other gamers to play with on Xbox Live. Check out our tutorial video on LFG here. \nAchievement Rarity: Achievement Rarity helps you discover just how unique an Achievement is among players of a given game. When you earn a rare Achievement, you‚Äôll get a special notification and diamond icon highlighting it. Unlock one today and let us know how you like the new animation! \nGroup Messaging on Xbox Live: Group Messaging helps you coordinate and keep in touch with your friends and fellow gamers by sending a single group message to everyone in a single conversation. Group Messaging works across Xbox One and the Xbox app on Windows 10. \nGamerscore Leaderboard: We‚Äôve improved the Gamerscore Leaderboard on Xbox One and the Xbox app on Windows 10 devices. The Leaderboard now resets at the beginning of each month instead of displaying results for a 30-day rolling period, meaning you and your friends will have a clean slate to compete against one another at the start of each month! You can keep an eye on the Gamerscore Leaderboard through the Achievements tab in your profile. \nThere is no update available for the iOS app just yet, but you'll find one for the Android app. While it doesn't contain everything that you'll see on Windows 10, there is a subset of features available for now: \nJoin Xbox Live Clubs to interact with like-minded gamers \nUse Looking for Group (LFG) to find a party to play a game \nStay connected with multi-user conversations in Group Messaging \nBug fixes \nNext up for the Xbox One would be Redstone 2 - which is now known as the Creators Update - and next for the app would be the features that coincide with the system update. \nIf you want to get early access to some features, the Xbox One Preview Program is now the Xbox Insider Program , and anyone can sign up. New members won't get system update previews just yet., but you'll still get game and app previews. \nYou can download Xbox for Windows here , Android here , and iOS here . Tags",

      "text": "From 360 video to 3D emoji , there's a big movement from Microsoft and others to make 3D imagery accessible to everyone . However, the act of scanning a real-word environment ‚Äî a room and everything in it, for example ‚Äî remains an expensive chore, involving hours of manual measurements and subsequent building in 3D software.\nThat will no longer be the case if the Structure Sensor has anything to say about it. Introduced by Occipital two years ago as a way to quickly scan objects and spaces and turn them into 3D imagery, the $379 gadget is getting an upgrade. With a new app called Canvas, the scanner can scan a room in incredible detail, letting users measure things like the length of furniture and the distance from floor to ceiling. Typical time for capturing a room scan: less than a minute.\nSEE ALSO: Inside Microsoft's plan to bring 3D to everyone\nImportantly, Canvas isn't just an app; it's a cloud-based service where users can upload and share access to their scans.\n\"With Canvas, we're trying to build a real end-to-end application,\" says Jeff Powers, CEO of Occipital. \"This is not demo ware. Canvas is a product that we wanted to see exist on top of 3D sensing, so we built it.\"\nQuick refresher on the Structure Sensor : It's an oblong-shaped device, roughly the length of a pen, that's loaded with sensors for capturing objects for 3D imagery. It's meant to attach the back of an iPad, but it can be used with smartphones, too. Occipital conceived the Structure Sensor as a means to create 3D scans that were a step up from what you could get via a regular smartphone camera. It launched on Kickstarter, and surpassed its $100,000 goal by over 10x.\nWhile the Sensor is excellent at scanning objects, it was sometimes challenged to accurately capture a 3D space. The scans were \"coarse\" and couldn't correct for errors on the fly. With the launch of Canvas, Occipital is fixing that ‚Äî Structure Sensor now comes with a screw-on lens for your iPad camera (it uses both its own cameras and the device's) that improves room capture.\nThe Structure Sensor can attach to an iPad or smartphone\nImage: Occipital\nThere's more ‚Äî a lot more, if you're a looking to do detailed work with your 3D creations. The biggest feature of the Canvas app is \"Scan to CAD,\" which does exactly what it says. Pressing the button will send your raw, scale-accurate scan to Occipital's new cloud service, which will transform it into a clean CAD drawing, complete with labeling, with objects (like furniture) removed.\nThe bad news: Scan to CAD costs $29 per scan, and it takes up to 48 hours to get the CAD files. Still, professionals such as contractors will likely think that's a hell of a deal, since building a CAD drawing from scratch takes a ton of costly manual work, whereas with the Structure Sensor, all you need to do is point your iPad at a space, press a button and wait.\nHow Occipital's Canvas 3D-capture app scans its environment.\nImage: Occipital\n\"Most remodeling projects ‚Äî you're looking at seven hours of measurement time, and it's even more time to take those measurements and build a model,\" says Alex Schiff, Occipital product manager. \"Whereas with Canvas, you take the scan, you upload it, and two days later you have something that's ready to design. So we're saving easily $1,000 per project and hours and hours of people's time.\"\nOccipital's new app is potentially a big step forward in cost and convenience for a lot of users. Assuming it finds a big demand for its Scan to CAD feature, the startup might have trouble scaling, since it's a human-assisted service.\n\"The two ways to scale is to train more humans to help out, and continue to make the software more powerful so they have to spend less time per scan,\" Powers says.\n\"We hope it's a problem we hit.\"\nBONUS: Using 3D printing to help blind people 'see' art",

      "text": "Patrick Awuah, founder and president of Ashesi University, Microsoft vet, and a MacArthur fellow, in Seattle this week. Photo: Todd Bishop, GeekWire. Many computer science and engineering departments across the U.S. are still struggling to bring more women into their programs, but a former Microsoft program manager has come up with a formula for gender diversity in Africa.\nPatrick Awuah spent eight years at the Redmond company in its heyday, before leaving the company to found and lead Ashesi University in his home country of Ghana in 2002. He was awarded a 2015 MacArthur Fellowship , a highly selective grant also known as the ‚ÄúMacArthur Genius Award,‚Äù for his work at the school.\nAnd Ashesi boasts more than just an accomplished founder and president. The school has also achieved that rare and difficult feat of STEM education ‚Äî gender diversity in technology education. In Ashesi‚Äôs engineering program , women represent 33 percent of the current 53-student sophomore class and 40 percent of the freshman engineering class, out of 74 students total.\nHow are they doing it? Awuah says the way we talk and think about engineering can have a huge impact on who is interested in the field. The school has taken that into account in the way it approaches recruiting.\n\n‚ÄúI turns out that if you go to a high school and you talk with the kids about engineering and you just talk about machines, the boys are interested, the girls are not. If you talk about solving problems for humanity using engineering, the girls are all in,‚Äù Awuah said.\nHe also said the way engineering is taught at the college level can have a large impact on its diversity. Ashesi‚Äôs engineering curriculum is project-based, with students working collaboratively on real-world problems.\n‚ÄúStudents are not thrown into a bunch of hard math and science courses to weed people out. They start engineering actually solving problems and designing and building things,‚Äù he said.\nThe spirit of tackling real problems and encouraging a diverse campus also plays into another goal for the school: encouraging entrepreneurship. Awuah said this topic is particularly important in Ghana as Africa‚Äôs total population is expected to nearly double by 2050, creating the need for many more businesses and jobs in the coming decades.\n‚ÄúThe idea that people should be educated broadly, that people should be educated to think critically, to look at problems from different perspectives and to learn how to ask the right questions‚Äù is integrated into all parts of the school‚Äôs curriculum, Awuah said.\nListen to Awuah‚Äôs full interview with GeekWire editor Todd Bishop above, or download the MP3 here , and keep reading for an edited transcript of the conversation. \nTodd Bishop: You‚Äôve done something remarkable that many schools in the United States are still trying to do ‚Äî and that is bring gender diversity into your engineering program. Tell us about the engineering program at Ashesi and how you‚Äôve accomplished the sheer number of women that you brought into the program.\nPatrick Awuah: When we started planning our engineering program about 3 or 4 years ago, we were starting from a place where our campus was gender balanced. It was 48 percent women and so we decided with engineering, we were going to achieve the same thing.\nNow, the purpose for starting an engineering program at Ashesi was that we wanted to educate people who are going to apply engineering to solve some of the hardest problems in Africa. We felt that it was really important to have diversity in thinking about what are the most important problems to solve in the first place and what those solutions should look like. If we just had an engineering program that was very male-dominated like most engineering programs are now in Africa, the decisions about what problems to tackle and what the solutions should look like would be different than if we had a gender-balanced one.\nThis was a major driving force for us. The second reason we did this was that we look around the world ‚Äî whether it‚Äôs corporate or public service ‚Äî we find that people who are trained as engineers often end up in very senior management roles in different fields, not just in engineering. And so with a mission that is about educating leaders for Africa, we felt that having gender balance in engineering was completely aligned with this goal of having gender balance in Africa‚Äôs leaders, leadership core in the future. You asked, ‚ÄúHow did we do it?‚Äù\nBishop: We should say what you‚Äôve done: 33 percent of the current sophomore class is women and 40 percent of the freshman class is women. Those are the first two classes.\nAwuah: That‚Äôs right.\nBishop: People in the U.S. hear that and it‚Äôs astonishing, so go ahead.\nAwuah: It‚Äôs fantastic, and we have this engineering department that‚Äôs already not male dominated, and the ratio of women is growing, as well. Now, it turns out that if you go to a high school and you talk with the kids about engineering and you just talk about machines, the boys are interested, the girls are not. If you talk about solving problems for humanity using engineering, the girls are all in. Just even the way we talked about engineering was important. When we‚Äôd go visit high schools, talking about solving problems for society and for people was very important.\nWe also implemented a curriculum that is very project-based. Students are not thrown into a bunch of hard math and science courses to weed people out. They start engineering actually solving problems and designing and building things. This has been very important, I think, for getting young women to be interested in the field of engineering.\nBishop: Let‚Äôs take a big step back. Tell us about Ashesi University, how it started, and what your goals are with the school.\nAwuah: While I was at Microsoft, my first child was born. Our son was born and that caused me to think about what Africa would mean for my children and for their generation and for future generations. I felt that I needed to go back to Ghana and help with development. I decided that higher ed was the way to do it because if you look at all the people in positions of influence, they‚Äôre the people who have had a college education. At the time I was thinking about this, only 5 percent of people aged between 18 and 24 would get a college education in Ghana.\nAlmost by definition, the people who went to college were going to be running the country fast forward 20, 30 years. So I decided to get into higher ed and specifically to bring the kind of education that I had experienced here, when I came to college in the United States: the liberal arts and sciences. The idea that people should be educated broadly, that people should be educated to think critically, to look at problems from different perspectives and to learn how to ask the right questions.\nThe bet was that if we could get Ghana‚Äôs educational system and higher ed to shift from rote learning ‚Äî which is what it has been for a very long time ‚Äî to a model of critical thinking and problem solving and getting all students to look at the connections between fields and get them all to think deeply about ethics and the good society and their role in society, that we would make a change, fast forward 20, 30 years. That‚Äôs what Ashesi is about, educating the next bench of leaders in Africa.\nStudents gather in the Archer Cornfield Courtyard on Ashesi University‚Äôs campus in Berekuso, Ghana. Photo: Ashesi University. Bishop: It‚Äôs not just about that though, because you have a very specific focus as well on ethics in your curriculum. It‚Äôs not the kind of ethics that I think a lot of students experience in the US where it‚Äôs maybe part of a capstone course and it‚Äôs a lot of preaching from a professor. You integrated into the curriculum.\nAwuah: That‚Äôs right. We‚Äôve integrated it in the curriculum in two ways. One is that we have a set of leadership seminars ‚Äî there are 4 of them ‚Äî that get students to think deeply about leadership and ethics and the good society. There‚Äôs a seminar on what constitutes a good leader. There‚Äôs one on what constitutes the governance of the good society, so that‚Äôs about the rule of law, human rights, ethics at a macro level. There‚Äôs one on what constitutes the economy of the good society and there‚Äôs one on servant leadership. Those seminars have very explicitly ethics and empathy built into the fabric of those courses.\nRELATED: See Ashesi University‚Äôs Examination Honour Code The other thing we do is that we have a set of 7 learning goals for our institution. We ask all the faculty when they draw up their course syllabi to think about which of the 7 learning goals they‚Äôre going to address in addition to their normal course objectives and how they‚Äôre going to grade and so on, to list 3 or 4 of the 7 that they‚Äôre going to address and how they‚Äôre going to do it. So this way, every course is addressing these core values of Ashesi.\nFinally, we encouraged our students to build a community of trust on campus outside the classroom and inside the classroom. Everything about how we operate, and I try to model that as the leader of the institution ‚Äî I‚Äôm very transparent. We‚Äôre very ethical, we never pay bribes. We do things in a very principled way, and we demonstrate to our students and to everybody else the kind of leadership and the kind of society that we want to create.\nBishop: Why is that important in society in Ghana? Why is it important to have this new wave of ethical leaders given the current climate? Maybe you could explain a little bit of that to folks who may not be familiar.\nAwuah: That‚Äôs right. Currently, Africa is about, most countries are about 50 or 60 years old since independence from colonial rule, so relatively young countries. They went through several decades of military government and strife and democracy is now starting to ripple through the continent. But we do have problems with corruption. When I look at Africa today, there‚Äôs about 1.1 billion people and the World Bank estimates that by 2050, there will be 2.5 billion people.\nThat will constitute 40 percent of the world‚Äôs workforce in terms of working age people. We‚Äôre going to have to create a lot of jobs, we‚Äôre going to have to grow economies across the continent. And this demographic change will be a dividend for Africa if we have good governance and we have strong educational systems. If we have an environment where the private sector can flourish and people are empowered to create new businesses and to create jobs for everybody.\nSo this is a central question: governance and innovation and entrepreneurship. We need to make it a part of our mandate as educators that we‚Äôre going to educate the people who are going to drive that change. Development will not happen just because time is passing. Development will happen when we have a leadership core that is determined to make it happen. That‚Äôs what Ashesi is trying to do, and we‚Äôre trying to demonstrate to other universities that it can be done and that we should all put our shoulders to the wheel and make it happen.\nBishop: The school was founded in 2002. You have more than 800 students now. Ashesi means ‚Äúbeginning.‚Äù You‚Äôre no longer really at the beginning. How would you assess your progress so far?\nAwuah: Our progress has been phenomenal. Things have gone a lot better than I thought they would. I hoped that they would go well. We have about 900 alumni, about 800 students and our students all get jobs right after graduation or they started a business or they go to grad school. So in terms of career placement, it‚Äôs been fantastic. But more than that, when we go to corporate Ghana, and we ask them to rate our students in terms of ethics, in terms of communication skills, professional skills, their ability to deal with ambiguity, they‚Äôre ranking them on a scale from 0 to 100 and they‚Äôre ranking them above 75 percent, which is the upper quadrant. We feel that we‚Äôve actually made a lot of progress in achieving our goals.\nA typical Ashesi classroom. Photo: Ashesi University. The other thing that we‚Äôve done that I‚Äôm very proud of is that we‚Äôve been able to build a very inclusive community. Fifty percent of our students are getting financial support from the university and our supporters. Thirty percent pay no fees, 20 percent pay partial tuition, 50 percent are paying the full ride. We have 48 percent women, 20 percent are from outside Ghana. It‚Äôs a very inclusive campus, and beyond that, it‚Äôs a campus that does not have walls in the sense that we‚Äôre very connected with the communities around us, and very intentionally so. Every student does community service as a requirement for graduation, for example. Things have gone incredibly well.\nBishop: One reason it‚Äôs significant that the employment rate is so high among the graduates is that that‚Äôs not the case in the broader population, even among college graduates in Ghana.\nAwuah: That‚Äôs right.\nBishop: One of your areas of focus is on entrepreneurship, so these folks can go out and not just find a job but create jobs.\nAwuah: That‚Äôs right. Create jobs or if they enter a job, to help it multiply. If they enter a company, help it grow.\nBishop: So how do you do that within the setting of a school? How do you prepare people to go out and do that?\nAwuah: Well, first of all, it turns out that the liberal arts are a great way to educate entrepreneurs, because you think about what entrepreneurs do: they question the status quo, they imagine something new, and they somehow get the courage to go do it. They take risks. The liberal arts approach actually helps do all of those 3 things. Even the process of sticking to a position in class and debating with others in a Socratic method is you‚Äôre taking an intellectual risk. You‚Äôre putting an idea forward to be challenged by others. This is very different than an education where there‚Äôs a teacher in front saying, ‚ÄúThis is the answer and that‚Äôs the only answer,‚Äù and you just repeat back to that person. So the liberal arts is a big part of it.\nThe second thing is, we have structured our curriculum now so that in the first year, we have a course called, Foundations of Design and Entrepreneurship. It‚Äôs a one-year course. Students study design thinking and then they apply design thinking to a range of things. They‚Äôre designing products, they‚Äôre designing solutions to problems that they see and then at the end of the first semester, they design a business or an organization to address a problem.\nThe second semester, some of those businesses are selected. They get a small grant from the university and students in teams will run those businesses on campus. It‚Äôs very experiential. By the end of their first year, they‚Äôve had a full range of what an entrepreneur does. Ask the questions, imagine something new and actually go do it. They might be successful or they might not. They might make mistakes but it becomes this incredible experience, shared experience that all the students have had that gives them context for when they go into their other courses. Whether they‚Äôre doing computer science, or engineering or business management, they can draw on the lessons learned from Foundations of Design and Entrepreneurship and it also builds confidence. Once you‚Äôve done that before, you get this bug.\nBishop: You were educated at Swarthmore College and UC Berkeley here in the U.S.\nAwuah: That‚Äôs right.\nBishop: Now having been through this experience starting, running, shaping a school, what would you go back and change about your own college experience? Lessons here for people in the U.S.?\nAwuah: There‚Äôs not a lot that I would change because I think that both of those organizations are quite dynamic. One of the things that I think has been very powerful at Ashesi is this decision that we made based on input that we got from corporate Ghana that we need to do a model that is blending what one would normally think of as traditionally liberal arts which applied majors. That blend has been a very strong thing for Ashesi. Giving that opportunity and providing that opportunity to students everywhere is a very good thing.\nThe second thing that we did a little differently than, for example, what I experienced at Swathmore is that we created this leadership seminar series. What those seminars are doing are they‚Äôre distilling and pulling material from philosophy and economics and social theory and quantitative reasoning and all of that around a theme of leadership, a focus of leadership. Swarthmore is this gourmet grocery store and you pick all these great ingredients and you create your own education and then you stitch it together yourself. Our students can do some of that but having this theme of leadership and giving that focus around that, I think was very good decision that we made.\nBishop: You‚Äôre back here in Seattle visiting. How much do you visit the U.S.? What kind of a role do U.S. nonprofits and corporations play in supporting Ashesi?\nAwuah: I‚Äôm back and forth to the U.S, quite a bit. I think I come to the U.S, at least 3 or 4 times a year and it‚Äôs a combination of connecting with financial supporters and donors and also other universities and colleges in the U.S so actually, when I‚Äôm done with this interview, a couple hours from now, I‚Äôm heading out to Denison University where I‚Äôm going to be meeting with the presidents of over 20 universities and colleges. We‚Äôre all having a conference together. So I‚Äôm staying very connected with the United States.\nBishop: You were at Microsoft from 1989 to 1997. I cannot imagine a more interesting time to be at that company. If you think about it, Windows 95 launched in ‚Äô95. That was in some ways the pinnacle.\nAwuah: That‚Äôs right.\nBishop: What was it like to be there and do you keep tabs on the company today?\nAwuah: I do keep tabs on the company and it was an incredible experience joining Microsoft. I remember my first day at work, my manager saw me in the halls and he said, ‚ÄúWhere do you live?‚Äù And I told him where my apartment was and he said, ‚ÄúNo, where‚Äôs your office?‚Äù He wasn‚Äôt kidding. I mean, we all actually lived there. The apartment is where we just went to crash to go to sleep and then we spent all our time at work. It was a fun, intense, very interesting time. People forget, ‚Äô89, when I joined the company, Microsoft was number 2 against most of its competitors, so this was word processing, spreadsheets, networking, even developer tools. We were the ones who were striving to get to the top. I was amazed that all the people around me were in their 20s. I was having conversations with people from IBM and Dell and others, other companies who took us all seriously. It was a lot of fun and a lot of hard work but it was great.\nBishop: Do you still own your shares?\nAwuah: I‚Äôve diversified. I own some but it‚Äôs diversified.\nBishop: Obviously that was what allowed you to start a university, the stock.\nAwuah: That‚Äôs right. I think having that financial cushion from my days at Microsoft made a big difference but also other people who worked with me who supported my project and who started projects of their own. One of the things that I find really remarkable about Microsoft and the Microsoft alumni body is that a lot of us are very involved with the nonprofit sector. A few years ago, I was at a Microsoft Alumni Association event and they counted for the first time was happening and realized that we were engaged in over 100 countries around the world, that alumni giving to nonprofit causes was at that time $100 million a year, and that does not include Bill‚Äôs giving. So it‚Äôs just this force for good that has been happening quietly.\nBishop: It‚Äôs remarkable in part because if people followed Microsoft in the 90s and the early 2000s, most of the things they would‚Äôve heard was about this company wielding its clout, being embroiled in antitrust and if you look at it now, in fact, we were talking just the other day in the newsroom about the comparison to Amazon ‚Äî which is just now trying to get into the world of philanthropy and at least show that they‚Äôre involved in the community. But you‚Äôve got Microsoft, and especially through the Giving Program, it really has become a model in corporate philanthropy.\nAwuah: That‚Äôs right. I think part of what has happened is when I joined the company from day one, Bill and the executives were encouraging us to give. I said am I giving to United Way and Swarthmore, of course, and the company would match it. I think that culture of giving has just remained, and when people leave the company, they keep doing it. I remember sitting in that room and hearing that statistic and feeling very proud about it.\nBishop: As we mentioned at the beginning, you are a 2015 MacArthur fellow. What‚Äôs that done for you? There was a pretty substantial financial award, more than $600,000. Tell us what the last year has been like for you in that regard.\nAwuah: I knew of the MacArthur fellowship and I knew it was a big deal, but it‚Äôs a bigger deal than I thought. The credibility of my work has dramatically increased. We‚Äôve been able to get meetings that we‚Äôd been struggling to get for years. I think that the MacArthur fellowship had something to do with that. It‚Äôs been really remarkable. I remember getting the call and I just finished inspecting a building that had been constructed on campus. The contractors were about to hand it over to us and I get this call and it‚Äôs from the MacArthur Foundation and they‚Äôre telling me that I won the MacArthur fellowship, the MacArthur Award. I wasn‚Äôt sure what to make of it. It was just surreal. It‚Äôs been great in terms of raising Ashesi‚Äôs stature and the credibility of the work that we‚Äôre doing.\nBishop: What‚Äôs next for Ashesi? Where do you want to take the school over the next 10 years?\nAwuah: Right now, we‚Äôre on a trajectory to increase the work we‚Äôre doing with innovation. We‚Äôve done a lot of work in building ethical reasoning but we‚Äôre really focusing on driving entrepreneurship now and also educating people who are going to be working in the public sector who will create an enabling environment. One thing that I‚Äôm really, really excited about is that we‚Äôve decided we‚Äôre going to start being very proactive about sharing our ideas and lessons from Ashesi with other universities. We‚Äôre in the process of developing a summer institute, if you will, that will bring the leadership of other universities, the faculty from other universities around the continent to Ashesi so we can work together and think together about how we really strengthen African higher education.\nI‚Äôm very excited about that because we all say, ‚ÄúWell, it, it takes a village to educate a child.‚Äù The transformation that we‚Äôre trying to achieve in Africa is going to take 1,000 villages. It‚Äôs not going to be done by one institution called Ashesi University. It‚Äôs going to be done by thousands of institutions that are working in concert. I‚Äôm very excited about that project.",

      "text": "from Kristian Bannister 200 views \nIn case you missed it, Slack took out a full-page ad in the New York Times to publish an open letter to Microsoft. The letter was in response to Microsoft unveiling Teams, a product that will be a direct competitor to Slack. Read it in full I've heard people arguing for and against such a move. \nTwo of my colleagues think it was a smart move to be on the front foot. Some think it shows they are scared . While others think the tone is smarmy . \nProbably worth pointing out that Apple ran a similar letter to IBM back in 1981. \nWhat do you think? Was this a good or bad move by Slack? Or was it a potentially good move, but they executed it poorly? Get more things like this direct to your inbox. Email ",

      "text": "In some corners of the Internet, the Zune still lives. \nMicrosoft‚Äôs defunct line of music players was launched 10 years ago this week with promotional concerts around the country, a marketing blitz, and promises that this was only the first step in a growing line of entertainment-focused Microsoft devices and software. \n‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just the beginning of this vision,‚Äù co-founder Bill Gates told revelers at Seattle‚Äôs Westlake Park. \nThe vision didn‚Äôt pan out. The Zune was no iPod killer, despite hardware that impressed reviewers. Its timing was not impeccable, just seven months before the iPhone kicked off the modern smartphone era and rendered standalone MP3 players obsolete. \n  Microsoft pulled the plug on Zune hardware in 2011 , and support for the software was turned off last year. The foray into MP3 players is widely viewed as one of Microsoft‚Äôs most prominent blunders during a decade spent chasing Apple‚Äôs success in consumer hardware. \nBut five years after the last Zune rolled off the assembly line, some fans still carry the torch for the device.\nEvidence of that lives on Reddit, the online message board community for groups uniting around virtually any niche interest. Look there and you‚Äôll find the home of a small but enthusiastic crew of Zune aficionados. \nGadget fans are a tribal set, prone to clustering around communities that use a certain app, or products built by Apple or Google or Microsoft. The louder among them take to social media to defend their selection as if choice of gadget or software is part of a grand competition. \nMuch of the activity on the Zune appreciation site is related to troubleshooting technical issues. Others swap success stories of hunting for deals on secondhand Zunes (‚ÄúGot a 30GB for $20!‚Äù). One superfan touted his collection of more than 60 Zunes . \nThere are more personal tales, too, including one user‚Äôs lament posted last month.\n‚ÄúA piece of me is gone,‚Äù the user wrote of his Zune, which, at the age of seven, will no longer power on. ‚ÄúHe lived as he played, loud and with clarity. Rest in piece.‚Äù \nAnother user, working on some unspecified research, asked the community if the Zune was still an active brand. \n‚ÄúThe Zune brand is no more,‚Äù someone replied. \nSome might beg to differ, Zune fan. \nMatt Day: 206-464-2420 or mday@seattletimes.com .

      "text": "LinkedIn, the social networking site for professionals that will soon be bought by Microsoft, is to be blocked in Russia after a local court ruled on Thursday that it had breached the country‚Äôs data protection rules, a sign of growing tensions for U.S. tech companies operating in the country.\nThe case in the Moscow city courts arose at a time of debate in Washington, D.C., over how the United States might retaliate for what American security officials said was the Russian government‚Äôs hacking of emails from the Democratic National Committee and other digital interference in the presidential election.\nRussia has a history of increasing regulatory pressure on businesses in political disputes. The case began in August, before Donald Trump‚Äôs victory in Tuesday‚Äôs election, and there is currently no connection between the LinkedIn case and the hacking scandal.\nThe country‚Äôs push to gain greater control over its internet users is one of a number of attempts by governments worldwide to dictate how people use digital services.\n  Russia imposed its ban ‚Äî a rare occasion of LinkedIn being blocked in a country ‚Äî after lawmakers passed new rules last year that required any personal digital data on Russian citizens collected by companies to be stored within the country.\nOfficials said the rules were aimed at protecting people‚Äôs online privacy from hackers, but critics have claimed the legislation could allow Russian authorities to force companies to hand over sensitive information about their users.\nMany of Silicon Valley‚Äôs largest tech companies, like Facebook and Twitter, also do not store data locally within Russia, but Roskomnadzor, the country‚Äôs telecommunications watchdog, targeted LinkedIn for its failure to comply with the new data rules.\nIt was unclear why LinkedIn was targeted in particular. Analysts have suggested that the Russian authorities focused on the company, an also-ran in the country‚Äôs social networking market, as a warning to larger tech companies.\nThe Moscow court decision, upholding a previous ruling against LinkedIn, means the company will now be blocked from operating across the country.\nThe ban could take effect as early as Monday. The company, which has fewer than 5 million Russian users among its 467 million global users, could still appeal the court‚Äôs decision.\nMARK SCOTT  ",

      "text": "Source \nA similar thing‚Äôs been happening with security products. \nWhen you upgrade to Windows 10, Microsoft automatically and without any warning deactivates all ‚Äòincompatible‚Äô security software and in its place installs‚Ä¶ you guessed it ‚Äì its own Defender antivirus. But what did it expect when independent developers were given all of one week before the release of the new version of the OS to make their software compatible? Even if software did manage to be compatible according to the initial check before the upgrade, weird things tended to happen and Defender would still take over. \nIt gets worse‚Ä¶ \nEven if users have compatible protection from an independent developer already installed, Defender appears with an alarming window . It fairly shouts that Defender is switched off, because you‚Äôve some other AV installed. There‚Äôs a big juicy Defender ‚ÄòTurn on‚Äô button too. Of course, many users will be inclined to press this button: ‚Äòwell, it‚Äôs from Microsoft ‚Äì the people who make the OS; must be good; no harm in turning it on for sure‚Äô. \nIn fact, pressing the big juicy button will also deactivate your existing AV. But a user only gets to find this out from a tiny text in a pop-up window (and you need to know how to get that window to pop-up): \nNo, wait; there‚Äôs more. \nMicrosoft has even limited the possibility of independent developers to warn users about their licenses expiring in the first three days after expiration. Actually, a warning is there, but it‚Äôs buried in a Windows Security Center notification, which hardly ever gets read. \nSo what‚Äôs the big deal about three days? It‚Äôs a big deal because this is the crucial period during which a significant number of users seek extensions of their security software licenses. And if a user forgets to renew a license, then Microsoft deactivates the existing AV, and turns on Defender. \nHold on; it doesn‚Äôt stop there! \nMicrosoft has introduced a limit on the number of antiviruses you can have on a PC: one (or two ‚Äì if one of them is Defender; see below). At first glance this looks like sense : all for a more comfortable user experience. But the devil‚Äôs in the details‚Ä¶ \nLet‚Äôs say you‚Äôve an independent AV. You intentionally ‚Äì or not (e.g., with bundled software) ‚Äì install a trial version of a different AV, but forget to delete it or purchase a license for it. When the trial period is up, Windows quietly turns off both AVs, and ‚Äì you guessed it ‚Äì turns on Defender! So, it‚Äôs out with two non-Microsoft products, and in with one Microsoft product, in no way whatsoever for a more comfortable ‚Äì or safer ‚Äì user experience. \nNo, really; there is more!‚Ä¶ \n‚Äò All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others ‚Äò. \nI quote Orwell as‚Ä¶ get a load o‚Äô dis: \nMicrosoft violates its own rule regarding only being able to have one AV on a system. The rule doesn‚Äôt apply to Defender: despite the presence of an independent AV, Windows will occasionally turn on its AV scanner. It demonstrates the results of its blustery activity, again egging the user on to ditch the other AV and stick with Defender. Defender is far from the best protection you can get. In fact ‚Äì just the opposite \nThe following question could arise at this point: ‚ÄòWell, if its protection is better and the user has a better experience with their software, seems fair enough: move over other AV‚Äô. \nThing is, Defender is far from the best protection you can get. In fact ‚Äì just the opposite. \nAccording to independent test labs, Defender gives by far not the best experience , but a below average one in the market. Not to mention the fact that it noticeably lags behind on the functionality front: it doesn‚Äôt have: parental control , built-in VPN , webcam protection , password manager , backups , exploit protection , protection for online banking and online shopping , proactive protection against future threats and dozens scores hundreds of other features which are all useful in providing maximum protection and a better user experience. \nThe trend is clear: Microsoft is gradually squeezing independent developers out of the Windows ecosystem if it has its own application for this or that purpose. \nIn doing so, Microsoft is acting against the interests of users since a lot of its products are of inferior quality. Browsers, gaming hubs, image viewing, processing of multimedia files and PDF documents, cybersecurity and many others are already suffering from this and, as a consequence, so are users. And it looks like this is only the beginning. What‚Äôll be next in the firing line? Virtual machines ? Cloud services? \nIf you still have doubts ‚Äì check this out, from 58.30: \nIn case you missed it: \n‚ÄúI want you to think about kicking out the third party antivirus because we‚Äôve got a great solution right now and it‚Äôs going to be even better in the months to come.‚Äù \n‚Ä¶ as they say ‚Äì from the horse‚Äôs mouth. \nRewind‚Ä¶ \nSo, like, how many times has Microsoft tried to come up with its own antivirus? At the last count, four: MSAV , OneCare , Security Essentials , ForeFront . They‚Äôve used up sooo much time and money on such projects ‚Äì but not one of them got off the ground. But sooner or later Microsoft‚Äôs investors will ask: ‚Äòwhere‚Äôs all the money gone?‚Äô So Microsoft, in its desperation, decides it needs to get to the top of AV-Everest ‚Äì AVerest ‚Äì by any means necessary, including with alarming pop-up windows. In doing so, users get protection markedly below the industry standard. Great job, Microsoft.",

      "text": "ZDNet Japan Windows 10 supremacy? Eve V comes gunning for Microsoft's mighty Surface Pro 4 Cheekily squaring up to the Surface Pro 4, the community-designed Eve V finds its own 2-in-1 spec superior to Microsoft's in almost every department. \nEve V goes head to head with Microsoft's Surface Pro 4. Image: Eve \nNiche Finnish hardware brand Eve thinks its forthcoming Eve V can outshine the gold standard in Windows 10 hardware, Microsoft's popular Surface Pro 4. \nFor now, the Intel-backed Eve V is just a prototype with on-paper specs that have been honed down over months of asking fans what they want in Windows 10 hardware. The company has now finalized those specs and held them up against Microsoft's Surface Pro 4. \nSince Microsoft hasn't updated the Surface Pro since Intel released its seventh-generation Core processors, Eve boasts that its hardware will outshine Microsoft on this front, while matching the Surface Pro 4 memory, configurable with either 8GB or 16GB RAM. \nThe Eve V will also feature up to 512GB SSD storage, two full-sized USB ports, one USB-C port, and a Thunderbolt 3 USB-C port. \nIt not only matches the Surface Pro 4's 12.3 inch LCD screen size and resolution, but packs a battery with 20 percent more capacity. As Eve recently revealed, its Windows 10 2-in-1 will also have a fingerprint reader and GPS, neither of which is offered by the Surface Pro 4. \nEve has also opted for four speakers over the Surface Pro 4's dual setup, and will include noise-canceling microphones. It eschewed the Surface Pro's 8MP and 5MP cameras, for a 5MP and 2MP setup. After all, who takes photos with a tablet? \nBased on community feedback, Eve also settled on a wireless backlit keyboard with a touchpad by Synaptics. Eve claims its hardware will have a continuous typing battery life of 15 hours. \nThe one catch is that the Eve V will only available to 500 backers during its Indiegogo campaign, which starts later this month. \nArriving at the final design through surveys posed a number of challenges for Eve. For example, most fans said they are unhappy with the battery life of their current device. But while they are willing to accept a heavier device if the battery life is better, they also want a slimmer device. \nEve's makers contend that by looking at their own preferences for battery life and mobility, they came up with an attractive compromise. \n\"In our hearts we knew the answer to the age-old 'how long?' question for us was: 10 to 12 hours of continuous use. Extending the thickness a little bit gave us also the possibility to factor in the USB A ports. To achieve the high-performance requirements, we designed Eve V's interiors to hide in a high-capacity battery, totaling 48 lithium-ion powered Watt hours. That's over 20 percent more capacity than Surface Pro 4 or MacBook 12. And roughly the same as the new MacBook Pro,\" they write. \nMicrosoft's power-management problems in the Surface Pro 4 have proved a major source of angst for users and Eve claims it has focused on that too, with \"custom algorithms, enabling smart power management\". \nFans are also sensitive to the quality of the keyboard, with 89 percent urging Eve to spend more on a sturdy one, and go for a high-quality trackpad.

You can manually edit the .csproj file and disable certain bits, but it seems like overkill having to do this for every SPA (especially where there's no C# code) being developed. I came into this game for the action, the excitement. Go anywhere, travel light, get in, get out, wherever there's trouble, a man alone.

      "text": "0 0 \nSurface Pro 3 is notorious for its battery drain issues. For months, Microsoft has been trying to solve these battery issues to no avail. The Surface Pro 3 devices powered by LGC batteries are particularly affected by this bug , and it appears this is going to be the case for a long time. \nMicrosoft recently rolled out a new firmware update for the Surface Pro 3, aimed at fixing the never-ending battery issues plaguing the device. \nv38.11.50.0 corrects an error that may occur on a limited number of Surface Pro 3 devices where the full charge capacity of the battery is misreported to the operating system and device firmware. This update corrects the firmware component that functions as a ‚Äúfuel gauge‚Äù so that the battery capacity is accurately reported. \nUnfortunately, this firmware update proved to be as useless as the previous update and failed to fix the battery issues , as users report . \nI‚Äôve installed the update and did the double restart as listed. My Surface still experiences the same issue caused by the previous firmware update ‚Äì as soon as I detach the power, the Surface turns off. Can anyone sound off with the same? Looks like the ‚Äúfix‚Äù wasn‚Äôt an actual fix after all. Look like you need to try again Microsoft. Third firmware update‚Äôs the charm? \nOne thing is clear: For the time being, Surface Pro 3 battery issues are here to stay. But what choices do users have given this situation? The first choice, and the dearest one to Microsoft‚Äôs support agents, is to accept the $450 out of warranty exchange. The bad news is that there‚Äôs no guarantee you will receive a device that won‚Äôt develop issues after the short warranty on it expires. \nThe second solution is to simply vote with your feet. If you are no longer willing to give Microsoft a third chance to release a firmware update that actually does what it promises, then you should consider buying another 2-in-1 device. \nWhat‚Äôs your stance in this Surface Pro 3 battery saga? Are you willing to give Microsoft a third chance? \nRELATED STORIES YOU NEED TO CHECK OUT:",

Best Buy is an American multinational consumer electronics corporation. Advertisement \nBest Buy and Walmart are the latest to compile their Black Friday ads but it was it worth the wait because they have a pretty great deal on the Samsung Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 Edge. As the Galaxy Note 7 has been retired, the South Korean information technology giant has been focusing more on the Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 Edge and so have retailers. \nBest Buy is selling smartphones like the Galaxy S7 on contract as well as unlocked. So, if you're wanting to give the Galaxy S7 as a gift for the holidays, it would probably be a smarter to give an unlocked model rather than one on contract. Also, Best Buy and Walmart are offering up a $250 gift card with the purchase of either device on Black Friday. Advertisement \nPeople who want to buy a fitness tracker can look for a good deal at Walmart as the Fitbit Charge 2 will cost $129 ($20 off) and the Fitbit Alta $99 ($30). The Braven BRV-1 Bluetooth speaker will also be on sale for just $39. \nBest Buy will be offering their customers the Netgear Arlo security cameras for $349- a four camera kit. VIZIO's 70-inch 4K TV at $999, Grand Theft Auto V for PlayStation 4 will for $29.99, and much more. \nIf you visit them on the Black Friday, you can save $400 On Microsoft Surface Pro 4 . Since it's specialized in technology, Best Buy will definitely be the better place to go if you're looking for some decent devices for a great price. \nThere will be plenty more deals coming from both Walmart and Best Buy as well as other retailers as we get closer to November 25 th . Besides that, they will be offering pre-Black Friday bargains in the week of Thanksgiving, to get people in the door and purchasing products even before the big day. Advertisement ",

      "text": "Microsoft - History of a Computing Giant Microsoft co-founders Paul Allen (left) and Bill Gates. Courtesy of Microsoft By Mary Bellis \nWho is Microsoft?: \nMicrosoft is an American corporation headquartered in Redmond, Washington, USA. Microsoft supports the invention of, manufactures, and licenses goods and services related to computing. \nWho Started Microsoft?: \nChildhood friends, Paul Allen and Bill Gates are the co-founders of Microsoft. The pair were total computer geeks in an age when any access to computers was hard to come by. Allen and Gates skipped classes to live and breathe in their school's computer room. Eventually, they hacked the school's computer but instead of expulsion, the duo were offered unlimited computer time in exchange for helping to improve the computer's performance. Bill Gates and Paul Allen even ran their own small company called Traf-O-Data and sold a computer to the city of Seattle for counting city traffic. \nBill Gates Harvard DropOut: \nIn 1973, Bill Gates left Seattle to attend Harvard University as a pre-law student. However, Gate's first love never left him, as he spent most of his time in Harvard's computer center where he kept improving his programming skills. \ncontinue reading below our video Should I Roll Over my 401K to an IRA? Soon Paul Allen moved to Boston as well, pressuring Gates to quit Harvard so that the team could work full-time together on their projects. Bill Gates was uncertain of what to do, however, fate stepped in. \nThe Birth of Microsoft: \nIn January 1975, Paul Allen read an article about the Altair 8800 microcomputer in Popular Electronics magazine. He showed the article to Bill. \nBill Gates called MITS, the makers of the Altair, and offered his and Paul Allen's services to write a version of the new BASIC programming language for the Altair. \nIn eight weeks, Allen and Gates were able to demonstrate their program to MITS, who agreed to distribute and market the product under the name of Altair BASIC. \nThe Altair deal inspired Gates and Allen to form their own software company, and Microsoft was started on April 4, 1975, with Bill Gates as the first CEO. \nWhere Did The Name Microsoft Come From?: \nOn July 29, 1975, Bill Gates used the name \"Micro-soft\" in a letter to Paul Allen to refer to their partnership. The name was registered with the secretary of state of New Mexico on November 26, 1976. \nIn August 1977, the company opened their first international office in Japan, called ASCII Microsoft. \nIn 1981, the company incorporated in the state of Washington and became Microsoft Inc. Bill Gates was the President of the Company and the Chairman of the Board, and Paul Allen was the Executive VP. \nHistory of Micosoft Products: \nThe majority of Microsoft's products are related to computing and the interent. Microsoft's Operating Systems An operating system is the fundamental software that allows a computer to operate. As a newly formed company, Microsoft's first operating system product that was publicly released was a version of Unix called Xenix, released in 1980.\nXenix was later used as the basis for Microsoft's first word processor, called Multi-Tool Word (a predecessor to Microsoft Word). \nMicrosoft's first wildly successful operating system was MS-DOS or Microsoft Disk Operating System , which Microsoft wrote for IBM in 1981, based on Tim Paterson's QDOS. In the deal of the century, Bill Gates only licensed MS-DOS to IBM, by retaining the rights to the software, Bill Gates made a fortune for Microsoft and Microsoft had become a major soft vendor. Microsoft Mouse Microsoft Mouse was released on May 2, 1983. Windows In 1983, Microsoft's crowning achievement was released, Microsoft Windows was an operating system with a novel graphical user interface and a multitasking environment for IBM computers.\nIn 1986, the company went public, and Bill Gates became a 31-year old billionaire. Microsoft Office In 1989, Microsoft Office was released. Office is a software package that as the name describes is a collection of programs that you might use in the office including: a word possessor, spreadsheet, a mail program, business presentation software, and more. Internet Explorer In August 1995, Microsoft released Windows 95, which includes technologies for connecting to the Internet: built-in support for dial-up networking. and TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol), and a web browser Internet Explorer 1.0. Xbox In 2001, Microsoft introduced their first gaming unit, the Xbox system, the first home gaming console on the market. However, Xbox faced stiff competition from Sony's PlayStation 2 and eventually Microsoft discontinued the Xbox. However, in 2005, Microsoft released their Xbox 360 gaming console which was a success and is still available on the market.",
