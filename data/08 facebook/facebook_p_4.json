      "text": "Facebook \nThere is always something endearing about plus-size women; this goes beyond the confidence they exude and their body mass. \nPlus-size women are the real deal since many men love hanging out with them. They are people who have learnt how to take care of themselves since they know the kind of controversies their curves and hips would cause in the society. \nREAD ALSO: Meet the hot female soldier rocking Lagos NYSC camp \nAs women, they have to learn how to speak for themselves as there will always be people who will try to bring them down because of their looks. On the other hand, some people appreciate them and cannot get over their tempting curves and hips. \nThe savvy black woman in this post is definitely going to get you stuck here. Her heavy backside is enough to make you reconsider your vows.

      "text": "Facebook \nIt is beautiful watching mothers bond with their daughters in amazing ways. When they make out time to bond, their relationship wax stronger and they are able to function more as a family. \nIn the past, children were raised to be afraid of their parents; daughters particularly find it difficult to relate with their mothers as they know they will end up getting scolded on the issues they seek reassurance on. \nBut in this present day and time, children have full access to their parents. The parenting manual has been changed to the latest version that supports things being done in the 21st century. This new parenting manual allows a son to kiss his mother on the mouth and touch her butts . \nREAD ALSO: Help! I’m tired of collecting money from my woman \nSome parenting manuals have child control as children are conscious of the things they do to and with their parents no matter how free they are with them. In view of this, parents go on family vacation with their wards and try to come down to their level in order to know what is going on in their lives. \nIyabo Ojo is a sensational Nollywood actress that we simply cannot get enough of. The beautiful and talented actress is a mother of two who dotes on her kids and give them the best of the bests. \nShe is a fashionista who knows how to leave her fans tripping each time she steps out for an event. Iyabo Ojo and her teenage daughter slayed a hundred and ten percent when they dropped a video on the social media. The Nollywood actress and her daughter danced to Korede Bello’s song while showing us the latest and baddest moves in town. \nREAD ALSO: Meet the hot female soldier rocking Lagos NYSC camp \nIt is interesting having a hippy mum who knows what is happening in the society. The duo must have invested a lot of time and energy into the creation of this entertaining video. Their dance is something you will love to watch over and over because of their coordination and their sleekness. \nIf you think you and your daughter can do better, then bring it on. Iyabo Ojo and her daughter are in every way current judging by their moves and steps in this video. Watch the video below and tell us what you think in the comment section:",

      "text": "Facebook 0 Twitter \nAlexandrina Karadjov a, also known as Acrista, is best known for her exquisite feminine paintings, which reveal her poetic vision of the world. The figures, subjects of her vivid imagination, tell so many stories and are so emotionally rich that admirers often ask if they are real people. \nWe live in a world where the conceptual art is valued by a too narrow circle of admirers, but Acrista’s paintings, being sought after and bought still wet on the easel, prove that representative art still has its lovers. \nA curious fact is Alexandrina is a third-generation self-taught artist (after her mother and grandfather). She is one of those people who were on one career path, but ended up somewhere entirely different. \nGraduated as a master of economics, worked in IT, including Microsoft, when she finally gathered the courage to leave the corporate world behind and be a full-time artist. \nAcrista dedicated more than 10 years of her life mastering soft pastel. But in 2013, she set a new challenge in front of herself, deciding to devote to oil painting. \nThe new medium to master, in combination with the work on various commissions and the exceptionally high demand for her paintings in general, forced her into working in solitude. She literally had to hide herself from the art scene for more than three years. \nJust this fall she finally managed to organise a comeback with an exhibition, comprised entirely of oil paintings. Another bold step is the publishing of her new art book, which she is crowdfunding on Indiegogo. \nThe art book is bilingual (in English and Bulgarian). Other than containing Acrista’s paintings, it also has some of her poems, impressions, thoughts on the art process, and photos from her studio. \nYou can support Acrista’s Indiegogo campaign here .

Austin Smith, for Motley Fool 9:01 a.m. EST December 2, 2016 Story provided and presented by Motley Fool How does your income compare to the average American household? (Photo: Getty Images) \nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau, the average household income was $73,298 in 2014, the latest year for which complete data is available. However, this doesn't tell the whole story. Depending on your family situation and where you live, average household income can vary dramatically. \nThe average American household income As I mentioned, the overall average household income was $65,751 in 2014. However, the average can vary significantly depending on your household's composition. For example, a single-person household earning $65,751 could have a completely different financial situation than a family of five with the same income. \nWith that in mind, here's the average American household income by tax filing status: \nTax Filing Status",

      "text": "MONTGOMERY, AL (WSFA) - Facebook is a wonderful thing. It allows us to keep up with friends, to share our photos and videos with family, and even to discover fascinating things from all over the world.\nBut it is not a reliable source of news, as evidenced by the Facebook \"fake news\" controversy during the election cycle.\nYet, according to Pew Research, 62 percent of all U.S. adults get news from social media, and 64 percent of them get it from only one site, most commonly, Facebook.\nPerhaps the biggest danger of this practice is that Facebook's algorithm puts posts on your feed based on what you like. Imagine if bona fide news outlets only showed you the news you agreed with. Is that really the only news you want to hear? It shouldn't be.\nAll successful news outlets, WSFA included, use Facebook as well as other social media to let you know some of the stories we're covering, and we will continue to do that. That's part of our job.\nYour job is to show good judgment about what you see on social media and not use it as your primary source of the news, certainly not your only source.\nUse news sources whom you have grown to trust over time to give you all the news, fairly presented, not just the news you like. We all have that responsibility as informed citizens.\nCopyright 2016 WSFA 12 News . All rights reserved.",

Share story Mike Rosenberg \nFacebook, which just opened a big Seattle office, is expanding again by leasing a pair of new South Lake Union buildings with the potential to double the tech giant’s presence in Seattle. \nPaul Allen’s Vulcan Real Estate announced Friday that Facebook will be the sole office tenant of its new $246 million Arbor Blocks project along 8th Avenue between Harrison and Thomas streets. \nThe two buildings will total 383,900 square feet of office space when they open. For perspective, Facebook this spring just moved most of its roughly 1,000 employees in the area into a new building on Dexter Ave N. that is 335,000 square feet. \nThe current Facebook office has potential to hold about 2,000 employees total, and the upcoming offices are slightly bigger. Most Read Stories Unlimited Digital Access. $1 for 4 weeks. \nConstruction on the Arbor Blocks project, which consists of two six-story offices with ground-floor retail, is slated to start later this month. Facebook could move in during the third quarter of 2018. \nThe Menlo Park, Calif.-based company first opened an office in Seattle in 2010 and the city now houses its largest engineering outpost outside of its Silicon Valley headquarters. \nSeattle-based teams have led development of the Facebook Messenger chat service’s video calling and the “cold storage” technology that helps company data centers more efficiently store the photos and other content people post to the social-networking site, among other initiatives. \n“Seattle is really a key part of our long-term mission,” Mike Schroepfer, Facebook’s chief technology officer, said in May. \nVulcan is also building the new Google campus in South Lake Union and has built most of Amazon’s constellation of buildings in the neighborhood. \nInformation from the Seattle Times archives was used in this report.

      "text": "Now is the time of year when Christmas music saturates the airwaves, and many of my Facebook friends have told me that it’s not really the holiday season until I post my first anti-“Christmas Shoes” status update.\nIn case you haven’t seen any of my previous rants on the subject, I should preface this by saying that the song “Christmas Shoes” and I have a very checkered history. I have long considered it a mawkish and maudlin piece of claptrap, and I don’t understand why a kid with a dying mother would carry a sock full of pennies to a department store on Christmas Eve just to buy her a pair of shoes that she’ll never actually use. I’ve long thought it’s a perfect recipe for a scam — just tug at some stranger’s heartstrings and get them to buy you the most expensive shoes you can find and then return them after the New Year to pocket the refund. I admit that’s not the most charitable interpretation of the song, and I confess to being quite the “Christmas Shoes” cynic.\nEvery year, that put me at odds with J.J. Malone.\nJ.J. and I both grew up in Southern California, where we attended A.E. Wright Middle School and Calabasas High. We lived in close proximity to each other for the better part of a decade, so it’s a bit strange to admit that I can’t ever recall us having a single face-to-face conversation. I remember watching him from afar as he would actually talk to pretty girls who wouldn’t have been willing to give me the time of day. Not being one of the cool kids myself, I always found myself on the outside looking in, whereas by sixth grade, J.J. was something of a legend. Even though he had a reputation for being very friendly and personable, I found him quite intimidating.\nSo I never said a word to him because I assumed he wouldn’t have been willing to waste any of his cool kid cachet on a geek like me.\nFortunately, time has a way of diffusing adolescent anxieties and decades after high school graduation, J.J. sent me a Facebook friend request. I was quite flattered and somewhat surprised that he even knew who I was. I soon discovered that we had a lot more in common than I had assumed back in the day. I realized that his legendary status was well-deserved and came to appreciate his quick wit and kind heart.\nThat’s probably why J.J. was quite taken aback the first time he saw me rail on “Christmas Shoes.” He loved the song, and I’m sure it pained him to learn that I was such a black-hearted scoundrel. Still, he was patient with me in our good-natured “Christmas Shoes” exchanges where he tried to get me to see the error of my ways. And as much as I enjoyed ripping on “Christmas Shoes,” I also enjoyed reading J.J.’s impassioned defenses, which were usually playful and never rude. He couldn’t convince me to love “Christmas Shoes,” but he always made me want to be a better person.\nComment on this story Suddenly and unexpectedly, J.J. passed away this summer. I didn’t fully appreciate how heartbreaking that was until I heard “Christmas Shoes” on the radio for the first time this season. Instead of thinking all my usual cynical thoughts, I thought about my friend, and the song brought me to tears.\nSo don’t look for any more nasty “Christmas Shoes” rants from me in the future. As far as I’m concerned, that’s an argument that J.J. Malone has forever won.\nJim Bennett is a recovering actor, theater producer and politico, and he writes about pop culture and politics at his blog, stallioncornell.com .",

      "title": "Pharrell Williams produced 'Hidden Figures' because 'it lifts women in an amazing way'",
      "text": "Share on Facebook \n\"Hidden Figures\" tells the true story of three African American women who were instrumental to the success of the U.S. space race in the 1960s. \nKatherine Johnson, Dorothy Vaughan and Mary Jackson were mathematicians who worked at the NASA Langley Research Center. They helped plot trajectories that put astronaut John Glenn into orbit and brought him back to earth. But the women couldn’t even use the same bathrooms as their white colleagues in Jim Crow-era Virginia. \nSongwriter and producer Pharrell Williams has a producer credit on the film and he wrote music for the soundtrack, along with composers Hans Zimmer and Benjamin Wallfisch. \nWe met up with Pharrell in a Hollywood recording studio to talk about the film, and I asked him: of all the projects he’s offered, why did this film speak to him in particular? Interview Highlights: On what attracted him to the story: \nFirst of all, it lifts women in an amazing way. It wasn't a movie about a weekend trip or divorces or whatever. It's a movie about three African American female protagonists who were into science, technology, engineering and mathematics. And the idea that this all happened in Hampton Roads [Virginia], which is my stomping grounds. As soon as I heard about it, I couldn't believe that I hadn't heard the story before. As I get older, I realize that there's nothing random in life, and there's often more times of serendipity. Six years ago our charitable organization, called From One Hand to Another — [which] is largely based on the STEM program — had an African American astronaut by the name of Leland Melvin. And he came and brought Katherine Johnson. I didn't know her then, and even when I told my mom the story, I didn't remember that I met her because it was very briefly. That's when my mom said, You met her before ... That was mind blowing. On the story not being well known: \nThe story is not more widely celebrated, not just because of segregation [but] because of what's going on with women and what's always going on with women. Women have been an integral part of everything we've ever done. Just think: anything that a man has ever made, a woman made him. But women's direct contributions in terms of achievements, the accolades have always been slighted, dismissed or forgotten. These women were dealing with a double whammy of not only being female, but also being African American. So it was tough. \"Hidden Figures\" is the untold story of brilliant African-American women working at NASA, who served as the brains behind the launch of astronaut John Glenn into orbit. Hopper Stone On how he figured out the style and sound of the film's music: \nWhen I first started the project I wanted Hans Zimmer to do it, and he insisted that we all do it together. We found ourselves in the room the first couple of days just throwing ideas and chord progressions around, asking ourselves, How did it make us feel? The lowest common denominator for us is that when you think about film scores, a lot of them —chord progression-wise — tend to go a bit Anglo, a bit Euro. That may not be the feeling that these women were feeling — these African American women in the 1960s. They were feeling something completely different. Music is one of the only things that can penetrate barriers. When there's a physical wall, music — because it's sonic, on a wavelength — literally can penetrate the walls. So we thought, Why not give them music that felt a little more hopeful toward them? We really wanted to think about that. So again, it was, both things considered. It was not only African American, but there was a female consideration. Mary Jackson (Janelle Monae, left), Katherine Johnson (Taraji P. Henson) and Dorothy Vaughan (Octavia Spencer) celebrate their stunning achievements in one of the greatest operations in history. Hopper Stone On segregation and discrimination at NASA: \nIn the 1960s, as an African American female working at NASA, it was an amazing opportunity and such a great stride and progression for our culture. However, it did come with obstacles. As an African American woman, their bathrooms were not in the same buildings or the adjacent buildings. They had to go all the way to the other side of the campus. In the 1960s — we forget that women were frowned upon for wearing shorts or pants. Women had to wear skirts and dresses, so there was no campus bike riding for them. So she had to make a 30-45 minute round trip to the bathroom every day whenever she had to use the bathroom. And because things were so timely and you needed to be punctual, she had to run. Rain or shine, this woman had to run. I thought to myself, What must she have been thinking? She was a mathematics savant. Her numbers obviously superseded that time. They superseded everything that was going on to help us in the space race. As she was running every day, what was she thinking? What is a mind like that thinking? On his hopes for the audience's takeaway: \nI can tell you this: you see what you want to see, right? When people talk about their [political] candidates and they talk about the bad things and the good things, they see what they want to see. So I don't know what people are going to see in this film, but I hope they see the equality. I hope they look at this, look at their wives, look at their grandmothers, look at their aunts, look at their nieces and their daughters and say, Man, I had no idea that you go through this . I want to come out of this and see what I can do more. Of the different viewings that we've done, it's been amazing to see men hold their women closer. It's been amazing to see women recognize that, yeah, they're having their moment in the film, but they can have more than that moment. They can have a lifetime if they just band together. It's been beautiful to see the strength that I see in women when they see this film. Katherine G. Johnson (Taraji P. Henson), flanked by fellow mathematicians Dorothy Vaughan (Octavia Spencer) and Mary Jackson (Janelle Monáe) meet the man they helped send into orbit, John Glenn (Glen Powell), in HIDDEN FIGURES. Hopper Stone On whether or not art can change the way people think: \nArt has always played an integral part of any kind of messaging. Message, muses, musician — it's all the same. Art was meant to convey a message any way you look at it. Any artistic discipline — from an automobile to a chair to a blouse to a painting, sculpture or song. It's all meant to convey a message. So I'm hoping that the messengers recognize that it's our time. On if he expects it'll be seen by President-elect Trump? \nThe current president and First Lady are due to see it in December. We're going to go. That'll be interesting. The next administration ... How do you judge? ... It takes ugliness to recognize what is beautiful and for us to recognize the things that we should cherish. So in the face of ugliness and ugly messages, I think that people are going to galvanize. They're going to recognize that there's power in numbers. I think they're going to think everyone who was afraid is going to recognize that if they come together, they're going to be stronger. I was thinking women would galvanize and just say, You know, we're going to make that decision . It's my opinion that women, if they wanted to end the human race now, they could do it. They'd just simply say, No more children . And there's nothing that men could do. I think that day is coming when they recognize that they have that power. I'm waiting on the women, personally.

(Larry MacDougal/The Canadian Press via AP) (Photo: The Associated Press) \nCALGARY, Alberta (AP) — Sean Monahan's split-second decision sent the Calgary Flames to their second consecutive win. \nMonahan waited out Minnesota goalie Devan Dubnyk before snapping a shot over his right pad for the shootout winner as Calgary edged the Wild 3-2 on Friday night. \n\"I had no idea what I was doing, to be honest,\" Monahan acknowledged. \"I thought I was going to come in and go high blocker, but it wasn't there. He's pretty tall, so I just tried a little move and lucky enough something opened up.\" \nCalgary goalie Chad Johnson then stopped Charlie Coyle's attempt at the other end of the ice to seal the victory. \n\"It's nice when you get the lead,\" said Johnson, who commended Monahan. \"If you can get a lead in the shootout, it gives you confidence. You have a little bit more breathing room.\" \nKris Versteeg and Mikael Backlund scored in regulation for the Flames (12-13-2), who are 4-1-1 in their past six games. \nJohnson made 26 saves for his second straight victory and fifth in the last six starts. \n\"Obviously, Johnny stood on his head again for us, made some big saves there in the shootout and in that third period and kept us in that game,\" Monahan said. \"It's a lot of credit to him and we've got to build some momentum here at home.\" \nChris Stewart and Mikko Koivu scored for Minnesota (11-8-4), which is 0-1-2 in its past three games. \nDubnyk finished with 30 saves, including four in overtime, before allowing goals to Versteeg and Monahan in the shootout. \n\"We're not going to overthink the skills competition,\" Dubnyk said. \"I'd like to make the save, but we'll work on that. Those are just things you do your best and try to bear down. Obviously it feels better when you get the extra point, but I think in a game that wasn't our best — we weren't as sharp as we'd like to be — to come out with a point and get a big goal in the third is something to build on.\" \nStewart opened the scoring at 3:50 of the first period when he redirected defenseman Jared Spurgeon's shot past Johnson. \nThe Flames pulled even at 12:26 when Versteeg backhanded a rebound past Dubnyk, who made a pad save to stop the initial point shot by defenseman Jyrki Jokipakka. \nJust 1:07 later during a man advantage for the Flames, Backlund tapped a loose puck in the crease into the net behind Dubnyk, who had made back-to-back saves to deny scoring attempts by Mark Giordano and Matthew Tkachuk. \nAlthough the Wild outshot Calgary 7-5 in the second, they weren't able to get any pucks past Johnson, who made a nice save to stop a one-timer off the stick of Zach Parise early in the period. \nKoivu scored the equalizer for the Wild at 7:40 in the third when he took a pass from Jason Zucker in the slot and fired a shot to the top corner, glove side, past Johnson. \nTkachuk had a great chance to score for Calgary when Alex Chiasson set him up in the slot with 6:18 left in regulation, but Koivu reached back with the shaft of his stick to deflect the puck over the net. \nThe Flames had a power play to start overtime, but weren't able to capitalize. \nNOTES: Stewart had gone 14 games without a point and 15 games without scoring before his goal in the first period. ... Monahan extended his points streak to three games with an assist on Versteeg's goal. Prior to his streak, Monahan had gone five games without a point. \nUP NEXT \nWild: At Edmonton on Sunday night. \nFlames: Host Anaheim on Sunday night.

      "text": "Can’t be neutral about charismatic leaders\nThere are few celebrated public figures on Earth. These peoples are so charismatic and attractive that one cannot remain neutral. Either people agree or disagree. Fidel Castro is one of them. For me he was the one who restored his people’s dignity, freedom and sovereignty. Apart from his contribution to Cubans, he also raised his voice for nations who were colonised and oppressed. He was the only symbol against imperialist powers and mafias that limit and control people’s freedom and resources. During the 2005 earthquake in Pakistan, 300 Cuban doctors and paramedics worked day and night in relief activities without any interest. God bless him.\nFrom Mr Suhail Abdul Wadood\nDubai\nThe people’s love\nCastro was trustworthy for the people Cuba. Only outsiders and greedy people saw the wrong in him.\nFrom Mr Bheki Buthelezi\nUAE\nLeaders shouldn’t be feared\nWhy do people have such rose-coloured glasses when it comes to Castro? He was a brutal dictator who caused many citizens to flee, and he killed and imprisoned many. You can’t just ignore that.\nFrom Mr Eshtiaq Sulaiman\nRiyadh, Saudi Arabia\nCaring for the people\nFidel Castro was a humanist. He was characterised by a strong concern for human welfare, especially the poor. He emphasised dignity and worth of individual people. Castro stressed the need for people to achieve improvements in society and self-fulfilment through reason and to develop human-orientated ethical values. Castro believed in a better life for all and in a better world. He fought the good fight, has finished the race and has kept his faith in a better world.\nFrom Mr Osama Masood\nUAE\nBeing merciful\nIf you appreciate Castro, then North Korea’s Kim Jong Un would also be a fine example of leadership. According to you, the whole world should follow their examples. He was a murderer.\nFrom Mr Kevin Henson\nAngouleme, France\nLead by example\nA good leader must understand first the needs of the nation. Secondly, he must devote himself in serving those needs. Third, he, himself must be a good follower, too.\nFrom Ms Lizzie Gamboa\nUAE\nIt takes a planner\nSimply loving the nation and sacrificing doesn’t work. Strategies, planning, development and the betterment of the nation shows real leadership. It is not possible in vote bank politics.\nFrom Mr Dhayalan Ramaiyan\nSharjah\nLeading, not commanding\nA good leader is one who can hold the nation together despite the odds and bring beneficial results for the nation’s survival. One who leads – not commands.\nFrom Ms Arlyne Olavere-Ocampo\nUAE\nUse power to empower\nCastro was a revolutionary whose supporters described him as the champion of anti-imperialism, humanity, socialism and the environment, whereas his detractors defined him as a dictator who oversaw numerous human rights violations inflicted on Cuban people. For better or for worse, his life shaped the history of Cuba for more than four decades. A leader of the country has to possess certain sterling qualities. Even though citizens are vital for the progress of the country, it is the leader who helms the responsibility to take the country to the zenith of progress. The qualities of honesty, integrity, selflessness, wisdom, pragmatism, prudence, courage and genuine concern and binding people together will make a leader effective. A leader should utilise his power to empower his countrymen.\nFrom Ms Jayashree Kulkarni\nUAE\nWalks the walk\nA good leader has a selfless love and compassion for his or her people and for all the next generations. He is not arrogant, rather he’s gentle and uplifting the people who are suffering from misery and pain. A great leader is a role model of hard work. He walks his talk and inspires his people through his actions. He makes sure that his promises are done and not broken.\nFrom Mr Bertrand Richemond\nUAE\nHis people hated him\nI can’t believe what I just read, Mr Bertrand Richemond. His people hated him! He was a brutal dictator who killed many innocent people.\nFrom Mr Mike Byrd\nDubai\nA hero\nBut why did the US think whoever opposed their ideas on is a dictator? The man was a hero to Cubans. I rest my case!\nFrom Mr Kwizera Ali Bin Omar\nMbarara, Uganda\nCastro was a dictator\nCalling someone a dictator isn’t name-calling, Mr Kwizera Ali Bin Omar. It’s a political term that precisely describes what he was.\nFrom Ms Shaina Gregory\nDubai\nEditor’s note: Is there a debate topic that you feel strongly about?

What a glorious view to wake up to and as my Facebook feed floods with reports of dedicated, hardcore snowmobiling friends who are heading for higher elevations in neighboring areas to experience there first thrill, their first smells of the sport and hopefully find a cure for that throttle twitch, I can’t help but smile. I’m envious as I hurry to finish up my holiday shopping (got to grab those hot sled gear specials as they come by); decorating the house, baking up a storm of holiday treats and cranks up the holiday tunes on XM. \nDid I mention how much I love this time of the year? My favorite color…WHITE! Ok, technically it really isn’t a color but it’s the color of glory, hope and winter! My favorite smells remind me even more of why I love snow…comforting smells of the holidays cooking in grandma’s kitchen are reintroduced now to my brood; of that fresh pine tree hauled into the living room to be adorned with bright lights of the season; and the first smell of that 2-stroke cologne! \nBut all of this beauty comes with a price…and I’m not talking about shoveling, heating our homes and all that good stuff…I’m talking about hundreds of hours of dedicated men and women who have a passion for what the white stuff brings, who get ready and work hard and without compensation for those many months of getting those super highways for sledding and majestic snowy paths for snowshoeing or skiing, ready for those of us who have an addiction to white powder. \nOne of the many issues that arise throughout the summer and fall months, and into the frozen season has to do with little fur critters who are so busy getting ready for winter themselves, that they don’t realize the havoc and headaches they cause us, as we struggle to find a balance for us and for them. Busy beavers are probably the hardest working critter in the animal kingdom, and man have they been busy this year! \nWhile many of you may be getting your snowmobiles out of hibernation, the Madawaska Snowmobile Club, in conjunction with the Frenchville ATV Club, has once again removed the beaver dam from the Airport bridge. Third time in the last month!!! Busy Beavers!! \nThere’s always plenty to do before the season gets underway. Volunteers are always needed throughout the season. Thanks to all the club volunteers throughout the northeast… and we thank our members who faithfully pay to be a member of a club, because membership monies goes a long way, especially in those small communities or those busy, high traffic areas. \nStay tuned and Let it Snow!

(Photo: Peter DeJong, AP) \n(NEWSER) – A study suggesting that magic mushrooms have a place in the cancer ward and a surprise find under a Mexican supermarket were among the discoveries of the week: Magic mushrooms had big effect on cancer patients : Two studies of cancer patients with symptoms of depression and anxiety suggest that a single dose of psilocybin — think magic mushrooms — has immediate positive effects, ones that persisted more than 6 months later among most patients. One likened it to an \"epiphany.\" 650-year-old temple found under Mexican supermarket : Archaeologists working at the site of a demolished supermarket in Mexico City only had to dig 10 feet down to find a temple built more than 650 years ago. The circular platform, about 36 feet in diameter and 4 feet tall, now sits in the shadow of a shopping mall under construction, and the public will eventually be able to view it. Researchers think they know which god it honored. Scientists explain deadly wave of molasses in Boston : Nearly a century after what researchers call a \"tsunami of molasses\" descended on Boston, Harvard physicists say that fluid dynamics equations that hadn't yet been written now explain why the disaster proved so deadly — and that the cold weather is partly to blame. When the tank first burst, the molasses moved at a speed that is a little hard to fathom. New theory on what's hurting astronauts' vision : One serious drawback for astronauts is that they often return to Earth with degraded vision, and a new study may have pinpointed the problem. It's a buildup of spinal fluid around the eyes, say University of Miami researchers. This cerebrospinal fluid is the stuff that cushions the brain and keeps it safe when we move around, but the lack of gravity in space seems to throw it out of whack — and that results in uncomfortable-sounding changes to eyeballs. These mummy legs likely belong to a great queen : Archaeologists say they've likely identified the mummified remains of \"one of the truly great and important queens of Egypt,\" in the same league as Nefertiti and Cleopatra. Three portions of mummified legs found more than a century ago almost certainly belonged to Queen Nefertari, wife of Ramesses the Great, who ruled during Egypt's 19th Dynasty about 3,300 years ago. The sandals were one clue. \nClick to read about more discoveries . \nRead about more discoveries on Newser , a USA TODAY content partner providing general news, commentary and coverage from around the Web.

Join the Conversation EJ Montini , The Republic | azcentral.com 6:53 a.m. MST December 2, 2016 91 Shares \nRep. Paul Gosar (Photo: Gannett) \nArizona Rep. Paul Gosar announced in a press release that his has been named the chairman of the Congressional Western Caucus, which is sort of like being named the fruitiest, nuttiest slice in the fruitcake. \nThe caucus is an all-Republican collection of climate deniers, many of them (like Gosar) beholding to mining interests and the Koch Brothers who would like to dig for uranium near America’s most precious natural wonder, the Grand Canyon. \nAnd with Trump in office, who knows what could happen. \nSo it’s fallen to President Obama to decide if he will use the Antiquities Act, which has been around since the days of Teddy Roosevelt, to designate a 1.7 million-acre area around the Grand Canyon as a national monument. \nIt wouldn’t stop hunting or other uses on the land. But it would stop mining, the effects of which are not fulling known on the natural resources of the Canyon, including the water that trickles all the way down the Valley and beyond. \nUnlike 97 percent of climate scientists Gosar doesn’t believe that humans, by way of the greenhouse gases we produce, have anything to do with climate change. \nHe boycotted a visit by Pope Francis because the Pope believes that God gave us brains to study things like, oh, the environment. And that we should not ignore scientific facts. Or, as the pope put it, “to commit a crime against the natural world is a sin against ourselves and a sin against God.” \nFor which Gosar called him a “leftist politician.” \nExpect Gosar and his caucus, with the help of Trump and the dark money interests, to go nuclear on just about every unprotected natural treasure in the land, and every person who wants to protect them, which probably includes you, since polls consistently show that a vast majority of regular folks agree with the creation of the monument around the Grand Canyon. \nPresident Obama can’t prevent all of the destruction possible under radioactive Gosar and friends. \nBut at this one grand national treasure he can limit the fallout.

It still doesn't block the fact that Facebook are analysing streaming or even voice talks when their app is on your phone. They became a bigger brother than the government, and they have way more information than you can imagine. I bet the governments will kill to get their hands on the data Facebook has.",

      "text": "Slideshow A stunning sweet wine from the Canary Islands Advertisment of Gallery: Facebook icon Twitter icon Pinterest Mail icon\nThe wines of the Canary Islands were once very big in Philadelphia, say, about 240 years ago, when ships docked from Tenerife and the Founders toasted their independence, according to some reports, with glasses of \"Canary Madeira.\" Well, a new wave of Canary wines has arrived here, and I'm fascinated by their character. In particular, the white Malvasías that grow on 200-year-old vines on the cratered black volcanic lunarscape of Lanzarote are especially intriguing, with a proximity to the salty ocean air, African winds, and flinty, smoky, minerally soils that inform their distinctive sense of place. Perhaps even more fascinating is how different two versions of the same grape made by Bodega Los Bermejos can be. The dry white (\"seco\") has a crisp, citrusy edge and a rich mouthfeel to balance its snap. The copper-hued sweet dulce is the real stunner. Made from late-harvested grapes in the \"solera\" style that blends multiple vintages, there's an oxidized quality that tempers the sweetness, an almost ice-cidery savor of reduced apples, with a tint of oranges, acidity, and spice.\n- Craig LaBan\nBodega Los Bermejos Lanzarote Malvasía Seco 2015 750 ml, $18 or so; Lanzarote Malvasía Dulce (NV) 500 ml, $27, at WineWorks in Marlton; Joe Canal's, West Deptford. The dry Malvasía is at a.Kitchen and Vetri. The dulce is also at Townsend, Vedge, Amada, and Laurel.",

      "text": "Now is the time of year when Christmas music saturates the airwaves, and many of my Facebook friends have told me that it’s not really the holiday season until I post my first anti-“Christmas Shoes” status update.\nIn case you haven’t seen any of my previous rants on the subject, I should preface this by saying that the song “Christmas Shoes” and I have a very checkered history. I have long considered it a mawkish and maudlin piece of claptrap, and I don’t understand why a kid with a dying mother would carry a sock full of pennies to a department store on Christmas Eve just to buy her a pair of shoes that she’ll never actually use. I’ve long thought it’s a perfect recipe for a scam — just tug at some stranger’s heartstrings and get them to buy you the most expensive shoes you can find and then return them after the New Year to pocket the refund. I admit that’s not the most charitable interpretation of the song, and I confess to being quite the “Christmas Shoes” cynic.\nEvery year, that put me at odds with J.J. Malone.\nJ.J. and I both grew up in Southern California, where we attended A.E. Wright Middle School and Calabasas High. We lived in close proximity to each other for the better part of a decade, so it’s a bit strange to admit that I can’t ever recall us having a single face-to-face conversation. I remember watching him from afar as he would actually talk to pretty girls who wouldn’t have been willing to give me the time of day. Not being one of the cool kids myself, I always found myself on the outside looking in, whereas by sixth grade, J.J. was something of a legend. Even though he had a reputation for being very friendly and personable, I found him quite intimidating.\nSo I never said a word to him because I assumed he wouldn’t have been willing to waste any of his cool kid cachet on a geek like me.\nFortunately, time has a way of diffusing adolescent anxieties and decades after high school graduation, J.J. sent me a Facebook friend request. I was quite flattered and somewhat surprised that he even knew who I was. I soon discovered that we had a lot more in common than I had assumed back in the day. I realized that his legendary status was well-deserved and came to appreciate his quick wit and kind heart.\nThat’s probably why J.J. was quite taken aback the first time he saw me rail on “Christmas Shoes.” He loved the song, and I’m sure it pained him to learn that I was such a black-hearted scoundrel. Still, he was patient with me in our good-natured “Christmas Shoes” exchanges where he tried to get me to see the error of my ways. And as much as I enjoyed ripping on “Christmas Shoes,” I also enjoyed reading J.J.’s impassioned defenses, which were usually playful and never rude. He couldn’t convince me to love “Christmas Shoes,” but he always made me want to be a better person.\n1 comment on this story Suddenly and unexpectedly, J.J. passed away this summer. I didn’t fully appreciate how heartbreaking that was until I heard “Christmas Shoes” on the radio for the first time this season. Instead of thinking all my usual cynical thoughts, I thought about my friend, and the song brought me to tears.\nSo don’t look for any more nasty “Christmas Shoes” rants from me in the future. As far as I’m concerned, that’s an argument that J.J. Malone has forever won.\nJim Bennett is a recovering actor, theater producer and politico, and he writes about pop culture and politics at his blog, stallioncornell.com .",

It comes to us from designer Elena Moraru , who is based in our Madison Beltline store. \nElena explains, “We do not live in a time anymore where you need to make millions to afford a luxurious lifestyle. Manufacturers like Bernhardt make exquisite, beautiful, and high quality furniture that is super affordable. You can live a life full of joy and color and have furniture around you that will uplift you every day.” \nAffordable Elegance (Photo: Submitted by Steinhafels) \nSounds nice, right? Elena adds, “The detail in the wood grain, the craft in the metal shaping and the tones of the fabric textures can create a space that elevates you emotionally every single day. Bring some more color, texture, and beauty into your space–so you can enjoy life and create an environment of well-being for yourself!” \nAffordable Elegance (Photo: Submitted by Steinhafels) \nDo you like this uplifting tip?

(Photo: Alessandro Trovati, AP) \nVAL D’ISERE, France - Mathieu Faivre led a fierce French challenge on first-run leader Marcel Hirscher of Austria to win a giant slalom on Sunday for his first World Cup victory. \nFaivre secured the fastest second run to beat Hirscher, the five-time defending World Cup overall winner and a Val d’Isere specialist, by 0.49 seconds. \nFrance placed four racers in the top five, roared on by a noisy crowd that sang the French anthem — La Marseillaise — when an emotional Faivre stood on the top step of the podium. \nFaivre had 0.01 to make up from the first leg, and the 24-year-old racer’s debut victory denied Hirscher a fifth GS win on this course since 2009. \nFrance team leader Alexis Pinturault was third, trailing 1.11 behind the winner. Teammates Thomas Fanara and Victor Muffat-Jeandet placed fourth and fifth. \nHirscher has now lost to two Frenchmen in defense of his season-long giant slalom trophy after being runner-up to Pinturault in the season-opening race at Soelden, Austria. \nFaivre, a former world junior champion, has had three podium finishes in World Cup giant slalom in 2016 and Pinturault was alongside him each time. \nIn what has become the France team’s top event, its streak of placing at least one racer in the top-3 of men’s giant slalom now extends to 14 World Cup races since March 2015. Kjetil Jansrud wins World Cup men's downhill in France \nFrance also got its only Alpine skiing medals at the 2014 Sochi Winter Games in men’s GS, when Steve Missillier and Pinturault took silver and bronze behind Olympic champion Ted Ligety. \nLigety led a five-strong United States challenge on Sunday in 11th, 2.63 back. He had been the only racer other than Hirscher to win a Val d’Isere GS in recent years. \nIn his return to racing amid a dispute with Norway’s ski federation, Henrik Kristoffersen was eighth, trailing by 2.38. \nKristoffersen, the World Cup slalom winner last season, skipped a slalom at Levi, Finland, last month to protest being blocked from wearing the helmet of a personal sponsor. The dispute is due in court. \nHirscher restored some Austrian pride after the team’s embarrassing showing in downhill on Saturday, when the traditional Alpine power placed no one in the top 15. \nHe now leads the overall standings after just five races of the season. Kjetil Jansrud of Norway had been tied with Hirscher atop the overall standings but did not finish the first run Sunday after winning the downhill and super-G this weekend. \nFrance’s strong showing Sunday was fair reward for Val d’Isere stepping in to host the three-race meeting at short notice. It was cancelled at Beaver Creek, Colorado, because of a lack of snow and warm temperatures. \nThe men’s circuit stays in Val d’Isere next weekend when the highlight of two regularly scheduled races is a giant slalom on Saturday.

      "text": "3 Well, kind of. Facebook certainly isn’t a conducive environment for the kind of news consumption we rather wistfully imagine: open-minded readers, scanning articles on a range of topics and from a range of perspectives, to reach a balanced, informed judgement on the events of the day. Facebook is never going to provide that at scale, unless it can discern from your actions that that’s the way of optimising your particular engagement. But Facebook is a conducive environment for the kind of news most people actually want, and always have consumed: partial, one-sided, emotional, on topics that matter to them and their friends, and that reinforce their views. And people are certainly getting that there: Pew data show almost half of all adult Americans get news on Facebook, weaved, as you say, into feeds which consist mainly of friends and family updates. That’s actually how people like to consume news, when given the chance. So what are news providers and policymakers concerned by the public interest impacts of news consumption supposed to do? It would be odd and self-defeating just to shrug our shoulders, try to pretend Facebook isn’t happening.",

      "text": "in Girl Squad \nPhotographer Trina Cary ‘s work is gorgeous and super-sensual. Earlier this year, she did a shoot of a mom who had three babies in just 12 months that was absolutely stunning and understandably went viral. Since then, she’s tried to post self-portraits that she says keep getting her banned from Facebook, and the most recent incident sent her over the edge. \nHere’s the photo Facebook kicked her out for sharing. \nWithin 10 minutes of sharing the image, it was reported ,and Cary was banned from Facebook for 7 days. “It’s unfair,” Cary tells Berry. “I see girls’ butts and blurred out boobs all over my newsfeed, and they don’t get reported. … Getting banned over this one particularly upset me, as I covered my breasts with my hands, and I darkened my lower half so much that even if you zoom in, you can’t see anything.” \nPlus, it felt like even more of a slap in the face, because as Cary notes on her blog, “I loved this photo. I felt like me in it. I felt strong and beautiful.” \nIn response, Cary created a photo series called Censored Women , featuring 32 women naked with the exception of “censor tape.” Volunteers included “w omen who had been reported for posting pics of themselves fully clothed in labor, women who had posted photos of their kids playing that were reported, and they couldn’t fight it!” Cary shared. “These women were with me. They agreed. It’s stupid.” \nHere are just a few of the gorgeous images that came out of Cary’s shoot. \nOf the shoot, Cary writes on her blog: “Yesterday, we stood together tall and proud. I watched as they helped tape each other, they encouraged one another, and complimented each other’s beauty. Not one of them did not have a smile on their face. Not one of them left with hunched shoulders. Each and every woman was proud of baring it all. It felt good. It felt empowering, and I am so proud of all of them. Thank you for having my back. Thank you for being beautiful and strong and saying FUCK YOU to the haters with me.”",

      "text": "Share Oliver Dingley and Ellen Keane Named Swim Ireland Athletes of the Year on Facebook \nDiver Oliver Dingley and swimmer Ellen Keane have been named the 2016 Swim Ireland Athletes of the Year, the organization announced over the weekend. Swim Ireland is the governing body for all aquatic sports in Ireland. \nDingley became the first Irish diver in 68 years to qualify for the Olympic Games, and the first in history to final when he was 9th in the semi-finals of the 3 meter springboard, and then 8th in the final. Dingley, the country’s first international-caliber diver in a generation, won a Commonwealth Games bronze medal in 2014 while representing England , but has since changed his sporting citizenship to Irish. \nDingley’s performance builds momentum for the sport in Ireland. By way of his 8th-place finish on the 3-meter final, he qualifies to dive in the 2017 FINA Diving World Series, meaning that a diver will remain at least tangentially in the Irish consciousness for another year. \nKeane, meanwhile, won her award after she completed her third Paralympic Games with a 100m breaststroke bronze medal in the SB8 classification – the first Paralympic medal of her career. She also finaled in the 100 back and 100 breaststroke. \nThe Swim Ireland Awards ceremony are usually held in May, where the previous year’s honorees are administered. In 2017, the event will be moved to November “to ensure (they) are in line with the swimming season.” These awards were given to 2016 athletes, who otherwise would’ve been bypassed as a result of the change in timing. \nWatch a feature video on Ellen Keene below: Other Award Winners: 16-year old Mona McSharry was named Junior Performance Athlete of the Year after winning silver in the 100 breaststroke and bronze in the 50 breaststroke at the 2016 European Junior Championships. She set Irish Records in the 100 and 200 meter breaststrokes, won 5 Irish national titles, and qualified for the European Senior Championships in May. There, she placed 26th in the 200 and 30th in the 100 breaststrokes. Oliver Dingley’s coach Damian Ball, the head of the Ireland National Performance Program, was named the 2016 Performance Coach of the Year. Ball left Southend Diving in 2014 to travel to Ireland with Dingley, citing his desire to coach at the Olympics.",
