      "text": "26 min ago ( … ) \n‘Demands respect at every corner’ is the tag line that greeted us on the Toyota website and when the vehicle arrived on a Wednesday for our week long test drive and included the new ‘Hybrid’ package, it was pretty much shouting that line at us every time we slipped a glance in its direction, or had the opportunity to spend time in it. \nOf course Toyota has earned the right to use this new moniker; as over the past two decades Camry has been the best-selling sedan in the U.S. market. Should they demand respect? Certainly as they have set the standard pretty high for others that want in on the sedan market. They have always had a great looking vehicle that was part sport, part mom and part economic- giving the greater masses of the motoring public what they wanted and needed in a family vehicle. \nFor those looking for a vehicle that comes with all the Toyota technology included, especially things that we associate with cars that cost much more, a good look and a way to get the family around in comfort, the Camry is a great way to go and most will not be disappointed with the purchase. Add to that fantastic gas mileage and the Camry Hybrid is the answer for any family, especially those that want to go green. \nAfter our first hour with the Camry, the new ‘Let’s go places’ line that Toyota is using, became not just something that we associated with the Toyota brand but we really wanted to get out of the house and spend time behind the wheel of the Camry, again… one of the reasons it is a best seller here in the states. Much of that response was because of the hybrid system that puts out a respectable 200 horsepower combined, add that to the fact that it seemed we could never get the fuel gauge to go down and we just kept wanting to drive and drive. \nThe current version of the Camry was introduced in 2011 and has received minor changes and enhancements over the past 5 years, getting a refresh 2 years ago, and has come to have what we would consider almost a Lexus like look with a lower stance and dynamic lines on the exterior. The front end now features LED headlamps along with LED running lights inset to the sides of a stylish new black grill that sweeps around the front of the vehicle giving it a very aggressive look. \nOur test ride came in a ‘Parisian night pearl blue’ color or a very deep and beautiful summer twilight sky blue that was highlighted by awesome 17- inch machined alloy wheels with black painted inlays. The rear was accented with the perfect spoiler on the trunk, and dual chrome tipped tail pipes. As we mentioned above, at first glance we would have thought we had been delivered a new Lexus, the exterior looked that good. \nThe beautiful blue exterior would not have been complete without the many soft touch updates to the interior of the Camry. The seats are made of a SofTex material with nice white accent stitching. Both front seats are powered and adjustable in 8 different ways, they are both comfortable and have a great sporty look and feel to them. \nThe hybrid Camry also comes with a new Qi wireless charging pad, this is a new technology that allows certain wireless devices such as phones and music units to be charged simply by putting the device on top the pad. It is a really cool technology no more plugging in to get a charge, it is an opt-in technology run by the Wireless Power Consortium that Apple has not yet joined, so their devices currently do not charge this way, which is too bad because it is a really cool tech feature. \nThe hybrid Camry can be had in 3 different trim levels the LE, XLE and SE, we drove what would be considered the middle or XLE version and were perfectly happy with all of the comforts and power that came with the Hybrid. All in all, we averaged around 37.9 miles per gallon for the week, quite an accomplishment for a regular sedan. This is quite a large improvement on the base Camry that comes with an EPA estimate of 25 city and 35 highway, as the hybrid should score in the 43 mpg for the city. \nStandard also in the Camry hybrid is keyless entry that included a pushbutton start, along with the door handles, our personal favorites, it worked exactly like those of a Lexus, meaning that with the key in our pocket and just putting our hand behind door handle it would unlock and by just walking up to the Camry on a dark night would cause the lighting to come on inside and out. \nThere is also a powered moon roof that came as an extra in our hybrid Camry, along with the 7” touch screen that controls all of the audio functions, along with monitoring other vital vehicle functions including all hybrid and gas usage. We found that we could also use a smart phone to put navigation on the screen from said device; however, ours did have the upgrade that included navigation from Toyota. \nThe Camry came with the new Toyota Entune system that uses an app downloaded to a smart phone to access a number of different functions such as Iheart radio, and Pandora radio. By adding the Premium Navigation package there are a number of other options that become available through this system- like weather, gas prices and dining options and real-time traffic and weather reports. \nThe upgraded Entune package also included Siri Eyes Free system that allowed texting and reading of texts through the car automatically without taking our eyes of the road, by just using the voice control system to access our iPhones. \nOf course riding in the new hybrid Camry was more comfortable than even we expected. This is a real gem in hiding and will make for a great competitor in the mid-sized sedan market standing on its own four wheels. The Camry will hold its own, and we would expect that it will continue to be, if not the top contender in the market. Much of the choices that abound in this segment will definitely come to one’s own personal preference. Make sure and give the Camry a test ride before the final decision; we would expect everyone to be as pleasantly surprised as we were, yet again in the Toyota Camry. \nSee the new Camry XLE today at Brent Brown Toyota at 1400 South Sandhill Road Orem, (801) 224-1320. \nBase Price: $30,140 \nPrice as Driven: $35,405 Craig and Deanne Conover have been test-driving vehicles for over 6 years and have had the opportunity to drive many makes and models.

Photo: Reuters Tweet Published: 7:30 AM, November 13, 2016 \nToyota Motor Corp <7203.T> has agreed to a settlement of up to $3.4 billion for a federal class action brought by U.S. owners of pickup trucks and SUVs whose frames could rust through, plaintiffs lawyers have said in court papers. \nThe proposed settlement covers about 1.5 million Tacoma compact pickups, Tundra full-size pickups and Sequoia SUVs alleged to have received inadequate rust protection that could lead to corrosion serious enough to jeopardize their structural integrity, according to court papers. \nAttorneys for the plaintiffs in court papers supporting the settlement estimated the value of frame replacements at about $3.375 billion based on a cost of about $15,000 per vehicle and the inspections at about $90 million at $60 per vehicle. \nToyota admitted no liability or wrongdoing in the proposed settlement filed on Wednesday before U.S. District Judge Fernando Olguin in Los Angeles. \n\"We want our customers to have a great ownership experience, so we are pleased to resolve this litigation in a way that benefits them and demonstrates that we stand behind the quality and reliability of our vehicles,\" Toyota said in a statement. \nUnder the settlement terms, Toyota will inspect the vehicles for 12 years from the day they were first sold or leased to determine whether frames need to be replaced at company expense and reimburse owners who previously paid for frame replacement. \nThe settlement reached on Oct. 31 covers Tacoma trucks from the model years 2005 through 2010, Sequoias from 2005 through 2008 and Tundras from the 2007 and 2008 model years. \nToyota also agreed to pay $9.75 million in attorneys' fees, $150,000 in costs and expenses, and $2,500 each to the named eight class representatives as well as the cost of advertising the settlement.

      "text": "November 12 at 11:46 PM I am not a socialist who believes everyone should drive small, unadorned economy cars.\nI am a realist who understands that most of us cannot comfortably afford automobiles marketed as luxury or high-performance machines.\nAlso increasingly evident is that our national and global environments cannot forever support bigger, faster, high-horsepower automobiles. That is reality, which in no way means I am against driving or the pursuit of the “fun to drive.”\nI am in and out of hundreds of cars and trucks annually — products priced at myriad levels, from tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of dollars, to several million dollars in some cases. The experience is revealing: Regardless of price, all cars get stuck in traffic jams; and there are always traffic jams somewhere.\n“Prestige” does not help you move any faster. Nothing is more humbling than being stuck behind a Hyundai Elantra in an Aston Martin on the Pacific Coast Highway, or shuffling behind a Volkswagen Beetle in a high-performance Porsche on a London street or some segment of the Washington area’s Beltway.\nNo law enforcement officer anywhere ever served me a traffic citation with the words: “Wow! That’s a prestigious car!”\nSpeeding from 0 to 60 miles per hour in 4.5 seconds impresses some automotive journalists or other proudly self-avowed “gearheads.” But try doing that in a quiet neighborhood — especially with a loud exhaust note — on a late night or early morning. How to make friends and influence people? That is definitely not the way.\nDo I like luxury and high-performance cars? Yes. But rapid technological advances, available in what we once called “economy” cars, makes some luxury metal seem vapidly foolish; and a super-high-horsepower car on an otherwise calm local street seems particularly out of place. High-performance on a racetrack or other designated space is fine, assuming you have the money or are lucky enough to get an invitation to share that venue.\nAll of this helps to explain the many Toyota, Ford, General Motors, Nissan, Honda, Chrysler, Volkswagen, Fiat, Hyundai and Kia vehicles you see in daily traffic on the Beltway and worldwide. They are vehicles that make sense, cars and trucks that real people really can afford.\nReality: I regretted having to return the 2017 compact Toyota Yaris LE hatchback I drove last week. It was such a worry-free drive. Fast? Not particularly. Equipped with a 1.5-liter four-cylinder gasoline engine, it stubbornly moved from 0 to 60 miles per hour in nearly 10 seconds. But it was a solid, reliable, reasonably safe and comfortable little car that could be parked almost anywhere and that got me and mine everywhere we wanted to go without necessitating a stop by bankruptcy court.\nAnd there was this about the Yaris: Toyota is to be congratulated for standardizing advanced electronic safety items through its Safety Sense package. That gives the motorist needed items such as forward-collision and lane-departure warning systems. I like this. I will look for this in all vehicles regardless of price or performance boasting.\nNuts & Bolts 2017 Toyota Yaris Bottom line: Prestige vastly is overrated. Think safety, need, cost when buying a car. Impressing a neighbor will not impress your credit rating, doctor or police officer.\nRide, acceleration and handling: This is a get-about car that serves that purpose well. It’s not a racer and does not move like one.\nHead-turning quotient: It’s not about that. Most heads will miss it and you won’t care.\nBody style and layout: It is a front engine, front-wheel-drive compact car available with two or four doors, manual or automatic transmission, or hatchback or sedan format. There are three trim levels — L, LE and SE.\nEngine/transmission: It comes with a 1.5-liter, 16-valve four-cylinder gasoline engine with variable valve timing. A five-speed manual transmission is standard. An antiquated four-speed automatic is optional. Hint: Buy the much more enjoyable manual transmission.\nCapacities: Seating is for five people. Cargo capacity is 15.3 cubic feet with all seats in place. The fuel tank holds 11.1 gallons of regular grade gasoline.\nMileage: I averaged 34 miles per gallon on the highway.\nSafety: Standard equipment includes ventilated front disc and rear drum brakes; four-wheel anti-lock brake system; Safety Sense package; stability and traction control; pre-collision safety system; and side and head air bags.\nPricing: The 2017 Toyota Yaris LE with automatic transmission starts at $18,000 with a dealer’s invoice price of $17,278. Price as tested is $19,104 including $239 in options and an $865 factory-to-dealer shipment charge.",

      "text": "Toyota's Prius 54 miles per gallon isn't even its best trait   \nBy Warren Brown The Washington Post \nExcellent gasoline mileage is good. It's not everything.\nThe 2016 Toyota Prius Two Eco hatchback gas-electric hybrid, specially built for maximum mileage, has a federal average mileage rating of 58 miles per gallon in the city and 53 miles per gallon on the highway.\nCity mileage is higher because that is where the car relies more on its electric drivetrain and start-stop engine technology. The highway demands more gasoline. Still, using the government's rating, you get a city-highway rating of 56 miles per gallon. My real-world mileage was 54 mpg using regular-grade gasoline.\nThat is excellent if yours is a commuting life. But my humble recommendation is that you skip the generally well-done 2016 Prius Two Eco hatchback, all new for 2016, and go with the slightly more expensive 2017 Prius Two hatchback.\nWhy? There's more to driving than fuel economy, and the 2017 model comes standard with many of the things that make a modern car a modern car - Toyota's excellent \"Safety Sense\" package, to be exact.\n\"Safety Sense\" includes full-speed adaptive cruise control, forward-collision warning and lane-departure warning and intervention. Those technologies can make an inches-moments difference between a serious vehicle crash and no crash, a serious injury and no injury, a traffic fatality and none.\n\"Safety Sense\" should be standard. I'd also recommend standardizing items such as blind-side warning, rear cross-traffic alert, and rear-camera feeds. But I drive and write about cars. I don't sell them. The new standard safety technologies I want cost money, which means they either contribute to or detract from a vehicle manufacturer's profit column. It is easy for me to demand that the companies carry the cost.\nBut \"Safety Sense\" works and works well. That means the package contributes to safer driving and less traffic mayhem. Toyota is moving in the right direction here. With continuing rapid improvements in advanced electronic safety technologies, maybe, it can go further. I hope so.\nAt any rate, the 2016 and 2017 Toyota Prius hatchbacks, the latter with mild cosmetic exterior changes, give you everything you could possibly want: reasonable comfort and quiet, with superb fit-finish quality and hard-to-beat gas mileage.\nKeep in mind that you buy either the 2016 or 2017 model for fuel economy. They do OK with their 1.8-liter, four-cylinder gasoline engines and electric motor drivetrains. But \"okay,\" here, is a very relative thing - a combined gas-electric oomph of 121 horsepower and moving from 0 to 60 miles per hour in 9.8 seconds.\nYou won't win any races at that speed. But you can drive to the racetrack and have more than enough fuel to visit that venue several times over without visiting a gasoline pump. And this is a hatchback - which means, as I and my wife, Mary Anne, discovered, that you can carry lots of stuff.\nNuts and Bolts\n2016 TOYOTA PRIUS\nBottom line: If your primary concern is fuel economy, it is hard to beat any Toyota Prius gas-electric. There are six trim levels in the 2016/17 Prius hatchbacks - Two, Three, Four, Three Touring, Two Eco (2016 only) and Four Touring.\nRide, acceleration and handling: All OK. It gets you there. It is not a high-performance car and was never designed or engineered to be.\nHead-turning quotient: It is a science project gone mainstream.\nBody style/layout: The 2016/17 Toyota Prius hatchback is a front engine/electric motor, front-wheel-drive, four-door gas-electric hybrid with a rear hatch.\nDrivetrain: It uses a 1.8-liter, four-cylinder 16-valve gasoline engine with variable valve timing in combination with a pair of electric motor/generators to produce 121 horsepower, which is transmitted to the front wheels via a continuously variable automatic transmission.\nCapacities: Seating is for five people. Cargo capacity with all seats in place is 24.6 cubic feet. Fuel capacity is 11.3 gallons of gasoline. Regular grade is OK.\nMileage: I experienced a combined city-highway mileage of 54 miles per gallon using regular grade gasoline. I'm still blinking!\nSafety: Standard equipment includes four-wheel disc brakes, ventilated front and solid rear; four-wheel anti-lock brake protection; emergency braking assistance; traction and stability control; rear center 3-point seat belt; side and head air bags.\nPrices: The 2016 Prius Two Eco hatchback starts at $24,700, with a $23,218 dealer's invoice price. Price as tested is $26,203, including $668 in mostly cosmetic options and an $835 factory-to-dealer shipment charge. Dealer's price as tested is $24,473. Add about $1,000 more for the 2017 model.",

Photo by LAT PHOTOGRAPHIC Kyle Busch, Toyota dominate penultimate NASCAR XFINITY race as Championship 4 is set Defending Sprint Cup champion wins for the 10th time this season \nNovember 13, 2016 \nIt was just another routine Saturday at Phoenix International Raceway for Kyle Busch.But nothing else in the Ticket Galaxy 200 was at all ordinary.All the drama unfolded behind Busch, as eight drivers scrambled for four positions in the NASCAR XFINITY Series Chase’s Championship 4 round at Homestead-Miami Speedway.Busch led 190 of 200 laps on the way to his 10th NASCAR XFINITY Series victory of the season, his 10th at the one-mile track and the 86th of his career, extending his own series record.Busch beat runner-up Austin Dillon to the finish line by 6.115 seconds. Ricky Stenhouse Jr. ran third in his first XFINITY Series start since 2013.“It means a lot,” said Busch, who won his 170th race across NASCAR’s top three touring series. “That’s what we set out to do tonight, and we’ve been really fast here at Phoenix.“We’ve had some great race cars, and Chris Gayle (crew chief) and all these guys do such a great job each and every week preparing these things. And it’s fun to win here.”Justin Allgaier and Daniel Suarez secured spots in the Championship 4 with respective fourth- and fifth-place finishes, as did Erik Jones, who recovered from a pit road mistake on lap 93 to finish 10th.But the real tension waited until after the race. Elliott Sadler sat anxiously on pit road as NASCAR officials decided whether loose lug nuts would cost the 13th-place finisher the services of his crew chief, Kevin Meendering, in the season finale.NASCAR found two loose lug nuts, and that means Meendering will serve a suspension next week. Sadler does not know who his crew chief will be at Homestead, though he was lobbying, somewhat facetiously, for team owner Dale Earnhardt Jr. to take over the pit box.“The emotions of the last 30 minutes have been tough,” Sadler said. “We knew one was loose, and one was in question. Kevin’s pretty much become my best friend, and Kevin’s made me a race car driver again this year …“We’ve saved our Darlington car -- our best car -- for Homestead. We’ve put all our eggs in that car. We’ve done everything right as a race team to go to Homestead with a legitimate shot of walking away a champion. … Now that we know he’s going to be suspended, it’s going to be tough.”NASCAR XFINITY Series Managing Director Wayne Auton said there was never a possibility of Sadler losing his spot in the Championship 4.“At the end of the race, we bring all the cars down to the entrance of pit road for inspection of the wheels and the lug nuts,” Auton said. “We observed that the No. 1 car had two lug nuts not secured to the wheel. With that being said, all the teams were very much aware at the start of the Chase of the violations that could come about.“We’ve advised the team that they’re going to be looking for a crew chief for next week and a monetary fine of about $10,000. It’s clearly in the 2016 NASCAR Xfinity Series rule book.”Blake Koch finished eighth and lost the final Championship 4 position to Sadler by four points. Joining Koch on the Chase sidelines were Ryan Reed, who finished sixth, and Brendan Gaughan and Darrell Wallace Jr., who were wrecked and eliminated before the race was 150 laps old.Gaughan, who needed a victory to advance to Homestead, was playing fuel strategy when his right front tire went flat on the front stretch on lap 138. Gaughan pounded the turn one wall and retired in 35th place.“It was about to play out the way we wanted,” Gaughan said after exiting the infield care center. “Did not want to be the caution. Did not want to hit that hard -- but we took a shot.”Wallace’s grandmother passed away during the week before the race, and the No. 6 Ford carried her name, “Granny Jan,” above the driver’s door. On lap 148, Koch ducked to the inside off turn four and knocked Wallace’s Mustang into the inside front stretch wall.“My grandmother was giving me the ride of my life,” Wallace said, his voice breaking with emotion. “That was the most fun I have had all year. Just circumstances took us out. It’s just hard. Thanks, Granny, I love you. We will go on to Homestead and let her ride again.” \nNASCAR XFINITY Series Race - Ticket Galaxy 200Phoenix International Raceway",

Click here to submit a Letter to the Editor , and we may publish it in print. \nToyota Motor Corp. agreed to a settlement of up to $3.4 billion for a federal class action brought by U.S. owners of pickup trucks and SUVs whose frames could rust through, plaintiffs lawyers have said in court papers. \nThe proposed settlement covers about 1.5 million Tacoma compact pickups, Tundra full-size pickups and Sequoia SUVs alleged to have received inadequate rust protection that could lead to corrosion serious enough to jeopardize their structural integrity, according to court papers. \nAttorneys for the plaintiffs in court papers supporting the settlement estimated the value of frame replacements at about $3.375 billion based on a cost of about $15,000 per vehicle and the inspections at about $90 million at $60 per vehicle. \nToyota admitted no liability or wrongdoing in the proposed settlement filed on Wednesday before U.S. District Judge Fernando Olguin in Los Angeles. \n\"We want our customers to have a great ownership experience, so we are pleased to resolve this litigation in a way that benefits them and demonstrates that we stand behind the quality and reliability of our vehicles,\" Toyota said in a statement. \nUnder the settlement terms, Toyota will inspect the vehicles for 12 years from the day they were first sold or leased to determine whether frames need to be replaced at company expense and reimburse owners who previously paid for frame replacement. \nThe settlement reached on Oct. 31 covers Tacoma trucks from the model years 2005 through 2010, Sequoias from 2005 through 2008 and Tundras from the 2007 and 2008 model years. \nToyota also agreed to pay $9.75 million in attorneys' fees, $150,000 in costs and expenses, and $2,500 each to the named eight class representatives as well as the cost of advertising the settlement.

      "text": "San Francisco: Toyota has agreed to settle a class-action lawsuit and pay approximately $3.4 billion to owners of trucks and SUVs in the United States who complained that their vehicles lacked proper rust protection.\nThe agreement relates to some 1.5 million Toyota Tacomas, Sequoias and Tundras sold in the United States by the Japanese manufacturer between 2005 and 2010. Plaintiffs allege that the frames in the sports utility vehicles did not undergo proper rust prevention during manufacturing, causing them to corrode prematurely.\nUnder the agreement, which was filed on Wednesday and is still subject to court approval, Toyota admitted no wrongdoing. However it has offered to inspect the affected vehicles and replace their frames free of charge.\nIt will also reimburse owners who have already made the replacement at their own expense. Another motion filed by the manufacturer stated that Toyota disputes the accusations but found the agreement a reasonable and fair way to end the controversy.",

      "text": "Toyota Agrees to $3.4 Billion Settlement in Corrosion Case By REUTERS Continue reading the main story Toyota Motors has agreed to a settlement of up to $3.4 billion for a federal class-action lawsuit brought by American owners of pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles whose frames could rust through, plaintiffs’ lawyers said in court papers. The proposed settlement covers about 1.5 million Tacoma compact pickup trucks, Tundra full-size pickup trucks and Sequoia S.U.V.s suspected of receiving inadequate rust protection that could lead to corrosion serious enough to jeopardize their structural integrity, according to the court papers. Attorneys for the plaintiffs in court papers supporting the settlement estimated the value of frame replacements at about $3.375 billion based on a cost of about $15,000 per vehicle. They estimated the cost of inspections at about $90 million, at $60 per vehicle. Toyota admitted no liability or wrongdoing in the proposed settlement filed last Wednesday before Judge Fernando Olguin of Federal District Court in Los Angeles. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story “We want our customers to have a great ownership experience, so we are pleased to resolve this litigation in a way that benefits them and demonstrates that we stand behind the quality and reliability of our vehicles,” Toyota said in a statement. Under the settlement terms, Toyota will inspect the vehicles for 12 years from the day they were first sold or leased to determine whether the frames need to be replaced at company expense. It will also reimburse owners who previously paid for frame replacement. The settlement reached on Oct. 31 covers Tacoma trucks from the model years 2005 through 2010, Sequoias from 2005 through 2008 and Tundras from the 2007 and 2008 model years. Toyota also agreed to pay $9.75 million in attorneys’ fees, $150,000 in costs and expenses, and $2,500 each to the named eight class representatives as well as the cost of advertising the settlement.",

      "title": "The 5 Models in Toyota's SUV Lineup",
      "text": "By Jason Fogelson Updated December 24, 2015 . \nToyota has an extensive lineup of SUVs, from compact to gigantic. Each has unique characteristics, abilities and design qualities. Toyota's lineup may be the most comprehensive SUV line in the automotive industry. \nKeeping the models straight can be a challenge -- so I've put together this brief Toyota SUV Spotter's guide to help. Just think of me as the Audubon of SUVs. \nRAV4 \nThe smallest of the Toyota SUVs, RAV4 is a crossover vehicle, an SUV with the underpinnings of a car. RAV4 was first introduced in Japan in 1994, and made its way to the US in 1996. The first generation RAV4 was available as a four-door or two-door through 1999; thereafter it became a four-door crossover exclusively (a two-door soft-top was available briefly in 1998 and 1999). The second-generation RAV4 came about in 2001, followed by the third-generation in 2006 and fourth-gen in 2013. For 2016, RAV4 is available with a 2.4 liter 176 hp/172 lb-ft inline 4-cylinder engine hooked up to a 6-speed automatic transmission and front-wheel drive or all-wheel drive, or a 194-hp hybrid gas/electric powertrain with a continuously variable automatic (CVT) and all-wheel drive. EPA estimates range from 24 city/31 highway for the front-wheel drive 4-cylinder to 22 city/29 highway for the four-wheel drive to 34 city/31 highway for the hybrid. 2016 prices start at $24,350 for LE; $26,270 for XLE; $28,370 for XLE Hybrid; $29,265 for SE; $31,510 for Limited; and $33,610 for Limited Hybrid.",

      "text": "\nIn recent days, news of Toyota’s settlement for a reported $3.4 billion, or thereabouts, has made headlines. Owners of certain vehicle models claimed that they were insufficiently protected from rust and corrosion, and Toyota will now be digging deep into its pockets to settle the claims.\nToyota to settle U.S. truck rust lawsuit for up to $3.4 billion https://t.co/7CUehlXmKv pic.twitter.com/y3NXD8KU5Q \n— Reuters Top News (@Reuters) November 13, 2016 \nAccording to Sara Randazzo of The Wall Street Journal , the Toyota settlement covers 1.5 million compact and full-size trucks (also known as the Tacoma and Tundra models, respectively) as well as the Sequoia sport-utility vehicle. All of the vehicles covered in the agreement were made in the year 2010 or before.\nToyota’s settlement includes Tacomas made from 2005-10, Tundras made from 2007-08, and Sequoias made from 2005-08. The Wall Street Journal also reports that this is an obvious and clear setback for the Japanese automaker.\n“The agreement is a substantial financial setback at a time when the Japanese auto giant’s record-breaking profit streak has slowed in recent quarters as a strong yen dents its performance. The company also is part of a broader group of auto makers facing plateauing retail sales in the profitable U.S. market.”\nAs reported by Keith Laing of the Detroit News, Toyota’s settlement was approved by a U.S. District Judge in Los Angeles, California this past Wednesday . As also reported by the Detroit News, Toyota’s settlement does not include an admission of wrongdoing by the company.\n“The settlement agreement states that the deal is not “an admission or concession of any liability or wrongdoing whatsoever” on behalf of Toyota.”\nToyota further seemed to reassure customers that it cares deeply about customer satisfaction, and it is dedicated to maintaining a high level of excellence in its vehicles.\n“Toyota said in a statement “we want our customers to have a great ownership experience, so we are pleased to resolve this litigation in a way that benefits them and demonstrates that we stand behind the quality and reliability of our vehicles.””\nToyota’s settlement also means that the company will have other expenses , as Reuters reports. \n“Toyota also agreed to pay $9.75 million in attorneys’ fees, $150,000 in costs and expenses, and $2,500 each to the named eight class representatives as well as the cost of advertising the settlement.”\nFor a little bit more background, Laing’s article in the Detroit News reports that the lawsuit began with a plaintiff in Arkansas, who was an owner of one of the Tacomas that was affected. The lawsuit was later changed to also include Tundra and Sequoia owners in four other states, per the Detroit News. According to Reuters , court documents showed that the problem was serious enough to put the “structural integrity” of the vehicles at risk.\nPer the agreement, owners of the vehicles in question will now have the opportunity to have Toyota inspect their frames for a period of 12 years from the day they were originally leased or sold. According to Reuters, if the frames of the affected vehicles do indeed need to be replaced, it will come at the company’s expense. Moreover, if owners have already paid for a frame replacement, they will be reimbursed.\nHaving rust on a vehicle is certainly not a fun thing to deal with, and it is worth noting that the news of Toyota’s settlement also comes as winter is approaching. Rust can be a big problem for vehicle owners who live in the “salt belt,” which are states where salt is used to combat snow and ice on the roads. DMV.org has a few helpful tips on how to protect vehicles from rusting due to road salt. Among them are planning ahead by thoroughly cleaning and waxing your automobile during the fall months.\nThe smooth running 2017 @Toyota Tacoma TRD is comfy on and off road https://t.co/IO6UcbTJ5m pic.twitter.com/DUi3bI2NcT \n— Autoblog (@therealautoblog) November 11, 2016 \nThough still behind trucks made by American companies, such as the Ford F-150, Chevrolet Silverado, and Dodge Ram, the Toyota Tacoma and Tundra have become quite popular in the United States. According to GoodCarBadCar.net , the Tacoma and Tundra were recently ranked as the fifth and sixth best-selling pickup trucks in the country.\nThe news of Toyota’s settlement is clearly a big blow for the company, but it still wouldn’t be shocking to see sales of the Tacoma and Tundra remain steady.\n[Featured Image by David McNew/Getty Images]\nToyota Settlement: Automaker Agrees To Pay $3.4 Billion Over Rust Disputes is an article from: The Inquisitr News \n",

The settlement applies to Tacoma trucks made from 2005 to 2010, Sequoias from 2005 to 2008 and Tundras from 2007 to 2008. \nThe settlement estimates the value of replacing the frame at roughly $15,000 per vehicle. Under the settlement, Toyota will inspect vehicles for 12 years from their initial sales or lease date to decide if the owner is eligible for a replaced frame or reimbursement.",

The settlement applies to Tacoma trucks made from 2005 to 2010, Sequoias from 2005 to 2008 and Tundras from 2007 to 2008. \nThe settlement estimates the value of replacing the frame at roughly $15,000 per vehicle. Under the settlement, Toyota will inspect vehicles for 12 years from their initial sales or lease date to decide if the owner is eligible for a replaced frame or reimbursement.",

The settlement applies to Tacoma trucks made from 2005 to 2010, Sequoias from 2005 to 2008 and Tundras from 2007 to 2008. \nThe settlement estimates the value of replacing the frame at roughly $15,000 per vehicle. Under the settlement, Toyota will inspect vehicles for 12 years from their initial sales or lease date to decide if the owner is eligible for a replaced frame or reimbursement. Related content",

The settlement applies to Tacoma trucks made from 2005 to 2010, Sequoias from 2005 to 2008 and Tundras from 2007 to 2008. \nThe settlement estimates the value of replacing the frame at roughly $15,000 per vehicle.

Needs completely new brake pads and a possibly a battery but other than that runs smooth. Just threw a price out there but hearing offers/ maybe trades. 170,000 miles on it Would have to be towed wherever it's going, believe the brake pads have cut through. Right now to start the car I use a portable jump that takes 30 secs. DONT CONTACT ME IF YOURE NORMALLY A FLAKE PLEASE. WOULD DO $3,000 at the absolute lowest. Over 6 people have offered this price and then never came to see the car! do NOT contact me with unsolicited services or offers post id: 5861441614",
