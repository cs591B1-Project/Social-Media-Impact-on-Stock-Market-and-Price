      "text": "Parker Posey Cast as Dr. Smith in Netflix's Lost In Space Reboot Jay Jayson Tweet This \nParker \"Queen of the Indies\" Posey, who is best known to mainstream audiences for her memorable supporting roles in 1993's Dazed and Confused and 2006's Superman Returns , will play a gender-bent version of Dr. Smith in Netflix's Lost in Space reboot. \nJonathan Harris portrayed the selfish, lazy, and sometimes-wicked Dr. Zachary Smith in the original 1965 television series. To prevent the Robinsons from successfully carrying out their mission to colonize a planet orbiting the nearest star, Alpha Centauri, Dr. Smith — a surgeon, a psychologist, and a secret-agent — sabotaged the Jupiter 2 spacecraft, causing it to become lost in... (Now, where was it again? Oh, yeah.) Space! Unintentionally, Smith became trapped aboard the ship. \nGary Oldman ( Batman Begins ) portrayed the character in the forgettable 1998 film. \nPosey joins a cast that already features Molly Parker ( House of Cards ) as Maureen Robinson, Toby Stephens ( Black Sails ) as John Robinson, Maxwell Jenkins ( Sense8 ) as Will Robinson, and Taylor Russell ( Falling Skies ) as Judy Robinson. \nTaking its cues from the original series, the show centers around the Robinson family, who is forced to come together in a time of crisis. Stranded light years from their intended destination, they find themselves battling a strange new alien environment and also their own personal demons. Equal parts family drama and sci-fi adventure, it is a survival story for the ages. \nZack Estrin ( Prison Break ) serves as executive producer alongside writers Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless ( Dracula Untold , Last Witch Hunter ); Synthesis Entertainment’s Kevin Burns ( The Curse of Oak Island , Ancient Aliens ) and Jon Jashni ( Godzilla , Pacific Rim ); and Applebox’s Emmy®-nominated director Neil Marshall ( Game of Thrones , The Descent ) and Marc Helwig. Marshall is also set to direct several episodes of the series. Lost in Space is a Legendary TV production for Netflix. \n10-episode first season of the one-hour sci-fi drama, from Legendary TV, will premiere worldwide on Netflix in 2018.",

      "text": "by Autumn A. Arnett, Education Dive \nCoursera is shifting away from a pay-by-the-course model towards a monthly subscription plan to encourage “binge learning,” Financial Times reports. An initial pilot of the program found a 250% increase in course completion. The company’s chief product officer, who came to Coursera from Netflix, told Financial Times, “We’re not introducing a new payment model so much as a new psychological model,” saying learners are financially motivated to complete more courses faster. The new payment model will apply to any specialization area that includes six to eight courses on one subject. Prices will range from $39-$89 per month — previously, learners paid between $19-$99 per course.\nhttp://www.educationdive.com/news/coursera-embraces-netflix-subscription-model-for-course-access/430432/ \nShare on Facebook ",

      "text": "'Gilmore Girls': 5 Exclusive Photos From the Netflix Revival \nWith Netflix’s upcoming four-part Gilmore Girls revival, titled Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life , a large number of the show’s original cast members were given the opportunity to reinhabit the characters they said goodbye to years ago. However, getting back into character after eight years is an experience every actor approached differently. \nAs far as Lauren Graham and Kelly Bishop were concerned, snapping back into the mindsets of their Stars Hollow — or Hartford, Connecticut — counterpart was simple. “To pick it up again felt really kind of inevitable,” Graham tells EW of playing Lorelai. “[It was] definitely easy in most ways.” \nFor Bishop, Emily Gilmore was easy to tap back into because she never went anywhere. “She’s been there all along,” Bishop says. “She travels around with me, so as far as Emily’s personality and her character, it was just waiting for me to climb into the suit and zip it up.” \nBut not everyone made such a seamless transition. For many of the returning actors, it was about preparation, putting in the work before returning to set. “I thought a lot about it and what I wanted to bring to the character now that would be different from where we left off,” Alexis Bledel says of Rory. “I mostly just imagined where she’s been since we left off, what she’s been doing, how that’s shaped her.” \nIronically, it was Jared Padalecki, who plays Dean, who took the most Rory-esque approach to his preparation: Research, research, research. “I watched a few of those first seasons,” Padalecki says. “I wanted to see what my initial take was on the character. I tried to study who I was and who I wanted Dean to be. I really focused on seasons 2 and 3, not 4 and 5 as much because Dean was embroiled in controversies. I got to focus on the parts of Dean that I liked the most and thought stood the test of time.” \nThen there’s Matt Czuchry, who focused first on reacquainting himself with the pace of the show’s dialogue, and then from there, tried to tap into the mental state of Logan Huntzberger. “Logan’s in a different place in his life,” Czuchry says. “The relationships that he has throughout these four chapters are in a different place, so there was a lot of preparation that went into that to get into that headspace. At the same time, what I love about all four chapters that Amy [Sherman-Palladino] and Dan [Palladino] wrote is that it’s just so perfect in terms of where the characters have been, where they are now, and where they’re going. So in some ways, once we did that preparation, when I got on set, it felt like we had never left.” \nWatch EW Reunites: Gilmore Girls here now on the new People/Entertainment Weekly Network (PEN). Go to PEOPLE.com/PEN , or download the PEN app on Apple TV, Roku Players, Amazon Fire TV, Xumo, Chromecast, iOS, and Android devices. \nSpeaking of getting back on set, for Scott Patterson, reconnecting with Luke didn’t happen until he was standing foot in the diner. Actually, it happened right after that. “I got on set the first day, walked into the diner, started rehearsing a scene, and I just didn’t have it,” Scott Patterson says. “I think I came in there with some overconfidence, and it just wasn’t there for me. So I asked Amy if I could just take a break so I could stroll around Stars Hollow. I walked around and tried to relive some of the moments, really take it in. And that actually worked. I got the walk back, and I just felt like him, and then after that, it was a breeze.” \nGilmore Girls: A Year in the Life hits Netflix on Friday, Nov. 25.",

      "text": "Duluth School Board rejects pay raise for staff \nAfter seven seasons and 154 episodes of watching the lives of Lorelai and Rory Gilmore unfold among family and friends, \"Gilmore Girls\" came to an end. Fans wept. \nThe voices are back on Netflix in the four-part series \"Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life.\" The story is told through 90-minute chapters — each spanning one season: winter, spring, summer, fall. Lauren Graham and Alexis Bledel headline the returning cast that features some very familiar faces to fans of the show. \nIt's been almost a decade but Graham and Bledel found it easy to slip back into their mother-daughter world. \n\"It was literally like no time had passed. It was not difficult. It was easy. It was joyous. It was fun. It was exhilarating. It was the old show. I mean, there was no sense of having to resuscitate something. It was just like it was meant to continue,\" Graham says. \nOne reason it was so easy to return was that conversations about \"Gilmore Girls\" never stopped, despite the cast going off to do other roles. That's why both actors signed on to reprise their roles even before scripts had been written. \nIt didn't hurt that those scripts would be penned by series creator Amy Sherman-Palladino. The energetic writer and producer, along with her husband Dan Palladino, had left the series before the start of the seventh, and final, season. \nOne conversation with the fast-talking Sherman-Palladino and it's obvious the rapid fire conversations on the series are of her making. Bledel says slipping back into playing Rory was a breeze because Sherman-Palladino's writing gives an actor all the information they need to play the role. \nA simple question to Sherman-Palladino about returning to the sets on the Warner Bros. lot ignites a verbal barrage. \n\"(Expletive deleted), they changed our Stars Hollow. They got a deal on brown paint. I've never seen so much brown paint in my entire life. I'm like, 'Who the (expletive deleted) doesn't want some color in your town?' There wasn't any red. There wasn't any yellow,\" Sherman-Palladino says. \"There wasn't a posy. There was still the sidewalks that we put in. They're cracked. So we had to go back in and zhoosh up Stars Hollow. We had to rebuild all the sets. I just remember the day that Scott (Patterson) walked into Luke's Diner for the first time, because it wasn't Luke's Diner. It's the 'Pretty Little Liars' are lying in there constantly now. So we had to get the lies out and put the diner back in.\" \nBledel had a few conversations over the years away from Stars Hollow where Sherman-Palladino told here that she still loved the characters and wanted to explore stories with them. \nThe actor knows \"The Gilmore Girls\" is Sherman-Palladino's vision. The only thing Bledel wanted to make sure happened in the new episodes was a reveal that all of the hard work Rory had gone through in those 154 episodes had paid off. \nBledel is coy when she talks about where her character's love life has gone. She does say that all of her ex-boyfriends make an appearance. \nFor years, both Graham and Bledel have had people approach them lamenting the loss of the program. A major reason for the feeling of loss was the relationship the Gilmore mom and daughter had. \n\"More people than I would have ever thought said it was the same relationship they have with their mother or daughter,\" Graham says. \"I would think, 'Wow, you must be really cool.' I think people see themselves in the characters more than they don't. That probably has to do at least in part with us being here. Some of those daughters are now mothers and the cycle begins again.\" \n\"Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life\" \n12:01 a.m. Friday, Netflix",

      "text": "By ROB LOWMAN Nov. 24, 2016 Updated: 3:04 p.m. 'Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life' What: Four new 90-minute episodes update the series with original stars Lauren Graham and Alexis Bledel.\nWhen: All episodes drop at 12:01 a.m. Friday, Nov. 25\nWhere: Netflix\nCan you go home again? Will they still love you? Will it feel the same?\nThese are questions “Gilmore Girls” and its fans are asking.\nThe beloved series that ran 2000-’07 on the WB and later CW networks has been revived for four hotly anticipated 90-minute chapters, each launching globally on Netflix Friday .\nWhen “Gilmore Girls” debuted, it told the story of a close relationship between a 32-year-old mother (Lauren Graham as Lorelai Gilmore) and her 16-year-old daughter (Alexis Bledel as Rory Gilmore). Their stories were often entwined in the lives of the eccentric characters in their cozy town of Stars Hollow, Conn., and visits to Luke’s Diner.\n“It’s amazing to know that people are eagerly awaiting the release of these episodes and have loved the show all these years,” says Bledel, 35.\n“I think it’s because it’s extremely comforting in a world that is lacking comfort,” says Graham, 49, about the enduring appeal of “GG.”\nUnder the heading “A Year in the Life,” the four new episodes will bring back a number of the original characters, including Emily Gilmore, Lorelai’s tough mother (Kelly Bishop) and Luke Danes, owner of the diner and Lorelai’s other half (Scott Patterson). The new series also will pay tribute to the late Edward Herrmann, who played Lorelai’s father. The actor died in 2014.\nThe four episodes – written, directed and executive produced by series creator Amy Sherman-Palladino – depict each season over a year in Stars Hollow. Of course, nothing much happens in the picturesque berg. The installation of a new sewer system is the issue at hand, but “Gilmore Girls” always provided an emotional landscape for its fans.\nAt its heart, it always has been about the incredible bond of love between Lorelai and Rory, which is rendered so engagingly that it’s fair to say everyone might wish to have a relationship like that.\n“It’s not a story about a little girl who’s in high school anymore,” says Graham about the new show. “It’s a story about a young woman and kind of the struggles she faces.”\nYet the actress notes that the dynamics between Lorelai and her mother and between Lorelai and Rory remain the same even if they have grown older.\nIn the original story, the young Lorelai had fled her disapproving parents in upscale Hartford at 16 to give birth to a daughter, Rory, and remake her life in Stars Hollow.\nAs warm as Rory’s relationship is with Lorelai, the one between Rory’s mother and grandmother is chilly. Often, Rory finds herself trying to make peace between them, and as she grew older, tried to find her place between the two strong women.\nThe storyline for the new season finds all three of the Gilmore women facing new challenges in their lives. Though Rory graduated from Yale and began a career in journalism when the series ended in 2007, she now finds herself unable to land a full-time job and must scramble around freelancing.\nLorelai is still with Luke, but she is unsure about what to do with her life and feels somewhat in a rut. Emily finds herself alone and still coping with the death of her husband.\n1 2 Next Page Related: Here are 5 shows on Netflix, Amazon you should binge watch after Thanksgiving ",

      "text": "6 Excellent New Comedy Specials You Can Watch on Netflix Right Now By Netflix The best of 2016, all in one place. \nThis year has been rough. We lost Glenn (R.I.P.), Cruel Winter still isn’t on Spotify, and, of course, you know, the thing happened . If you’re like me, you’re probably using this Thanksgiving break to R&R, and right now you could probably use a good laugh. Luckily, Netflix has been on a roll with its comedy specials. If you logged on right now your biggest problem would be figuring out where to start. EDITOR’S PICK Your Thanksgiving Netflix Guide: What to Binge-Watch After You Binge-Eat \nLuckily, after watching hundreds of one-liners, impersonations, and crude sex jokes I’ve whittled 2016’s Netflix comedy specials down to the six essentials. Between these half dozen comedians there’s something for everybody. Their material ranges from witty to raunchy to like, super meta . So log off your newsfeeds for a while and grab a beer and a spot on the couch. Bo Burnham: Make Happy \nOf all the specials on this list, Bo Burnham’s Make Happy is the most likely to become a classic. It’s a daring work, one that sees the 25-year old polymath exploring much heavier themes than in his in past routines. But every time Burnham pushes the audience into uncomfortable territory, like mental illness or white male privilege, it pays off with major laughs and incredible music. \nHis songs are flawless (even his nursery rap over a Metro Boomin-esque trap beat could probably chart), and his prevailing theme—that most entertainment only offers temporary relief from the harsh truths of the world—is thoughtful, if a little too real at times. Joe Rogan: Triggered \nJoe Rogan performs the entirety of Triggered while extraordinarily stoned. For those familiar with his podcast, “The Joe Rogan Experience,” this probably isn’t a surprise. But, given how many witty ideas he packs into 63 minutes, they must smoke some serious stuff in California. \nWith a name like “Triggered,” you already know Rogan isn’t afraid to ruffle a few feathers–i.e. his backhanded reason for wanting a woman president: “That way we can realize chicks can't do that fucking job either.” Yet Rogan is thoughtful enough that his less PC musings aren’t wantonly offensive. Overall, he’s more focused on figuring out why weed gummy bears are so strong than pushing some sort of agenda. \nTriggered works because it makes you feel like you’re hanging out with your smartest stoner friend. Rogan has a way with weaving brainy observations into goofy stories, and his transitions are razor-sharp for a guy with such a passion for being blunted. (His abrupt segue into a story of his life-changing dolphin encounter made me spit my drink.) Rogan leaves the special on a high note–and you’ll laugh whether or not you’re up there with him. Ali Wong: Baby Cobra \nIt’s rare to see a comedian perform 7½ months pregnant. Rarer still is for that fact to be one of the less shocking elements of their set. See, in Baby Cobra , Ali Wong (whose work as a writer on Fresh Off the Boat you’ve laughed at before) holds nothing back. In her words “When you’re pregnant, you’re hungry, tired, and fat, so you have this ‘I don’t give a fuck’ attitude that lends itself very well to performance.” \nThe 34-year old Vietnamese-Chinese-American comedian specializes in the kind of comedy that makes you wince and laugh at once. At one point she recounts an accidental hookup with a homeless guy, at another she delves into the joys of anal sex. While I suppose the rules of TMI are suspended for a comedy routine, she walks the line with finesse. \nWong is clearly aware that comedy is generally a boys’ club. But by doubling down on her unique perspective, she tells stories most other comedians would never think of with a raunchiness they wouldn’t dare match. Kathleen Madigan: Bothering Jesus \nIf you’re looking for a special you can enjoy without worrying if Mom wanders into the living room, Bothering Jesus is your best bet. Kathleen Madigan has more than 25 years of stand-up experience behind her. Her jokes about a drinking in Ireland, her obsession with Malaysia Airlines flight 370, and her strategies to keep your kid out of ISIS make for a PG-13 (at most) affair. \nIf you’re looking for a special you can enjoy without worrying if Mom wanders into the living room, Bothering Jesus is your best bet. \nMadigan’s conversational tone gives her an Irish pub bartender vibe. She’s never has to stretch for laughs. Her impressions (especially of parents) are charming, her accents are spot-on, she never runs out of creative ways to express her love for beer, and her jokes are just plain endearing. So don’t be fooled: Just because Bothering Jesus is the most family- oriented special on the list doesn’t mean it won’t make you spill a Guinness all over the couch. Tom Segura: Mostly Stories \nTom Segura knows that story telling is his biggest strength. He tells the type of stories you’ll inevitably try and fail to recreate to friends—t. The kind where he yells back and forth with parents who brought their babies to movie theaters, or visits a strip club named B“beef,” or gets a cell-phone call from Mike Tyson after meeting him on a flight. You really can’t make this stuff up–though Segura sprinkles in subtle bits of fiction. Even hearing him retell his favorite episode of Beyond Scared Straight can bring tears of laughter. \nWhen Segura deviates from the stories he’s admittedly on shakier ground. His segment on racism is pretty rough, and though his imitation of a person who patronizes the handicapped is well intentioned, it’s still a bit clumsy. Luckily these parts are few and far in between, sandwiched by some truly hilarious stories. Dwayne Perkins: Take Note \nDwayne Perkins is a thinking man’s comic. In Take Note , he steers clear of the usual cursing or needlessly offensive material most comics use to pad their first specials and relies on his talent for poking at people’s perceptions. He casually flips stereotypes on their heads, like when he declares white people the best dancers because “they have more fun.” After talking U.S. foreign policy, he takes an extra second to make fun of both the conservative and liberal response to his bit. And just try using his criterion of what makes a game a sport or an activity while watching ESPN2. Take Note treads the same ground Fresh Prince or Martin might’ve if they had lasted into 2016. \nTake Note has been 10 years in the making. Perkins, based in L.A. via Brooklyn, has been honing his skills on Comedy Central, Conan, Leno, and Carson Daly all the while. He’s probably the least well-known comic on the list, but he won’t be for long.",

      "text": "By Nick Schager Nov 23, 2016 There's never a busier time for cinephiles than December, when the studios decide to unload a year's worth of A-list works in theaters . That, coupled with the usual onslaught of fresh streaming options, means there's scant opportunity to see everything you want—much less make sure you're not missing a chance to catch those Netflix titles about to disappear from the service. Fortunately, this month's collection of departing movies is relatively light on classics, and below we've got a rundown of the ones you should most make time to see.   American Beauty (December 1) Most Popular Sam Mendes' Oscar winner (for Best Picture, Director, Actor, Screenplay, and Cinematography) stars Kevin Spacey and Annette Bening as a couple coping with crushing suburban discontent. Don't Be A Menace to South Central While Drinking Your Juice In the Hood (December 1) Produced by Keenen Ivory Wayans and starring his brothers Shawn and Marlon, this amusing spoof of '90s African-American coming-of-age movies set the stage for the actors' subsequent Scary Movie series. Elizabeth: The Golden Age (December 1)   Cate Blanchett reprises her role as Queen Elizabeth I of England in Shekhar Kapur's lavish 2007 sequel, which earned the star an Academy Award nomination for Best Actress. Event Horizon (December 1) Recounting the nightmarish ordeal suffered by a crew of astronauts after they discover a long-missing ship with an experimental gravity drive, Paul W. S. Anderson's stellar 1997 sci-fi/horror hybrid (starring Sam Neill and Laurence Fishburne) operates like a cross between Alien and Hellraiser .   Neil Young: Heart of Gold (December 1) Most Popular Jonathan Demme reconfirmed his status as modern cinema's finest concert-movie director with this masterful 2006 effort detailing Neil Young's two shows at the Ryman Auditorium in Nashville, Tennessee in August 2005. Paycheck (December 1) Even in a formulaic sci-fi thriller like this (based on Philip K. Dick's short story), John Woo–here working with Ben Affleck and Uma Thurman–shows that he's one of the action genre's most accomplished filmmakers. Top Gun (December 1)   Tom Cruise hits the highway to the danger zone –with Kelly McGillis, Val Kilmer, and Anthony Edwards in tow–in Tony Scott's still-awesome 1986 military action hit. World Trade Center (December 1) Nicolas Cage is a Port Authority Police Officer who finds himself trapped in the rubble of New York City's Twin Towers on 9/11 in Oliver Stone's stirring (and surprisingly non-preachy) 2006 drama. Holes (December 5) Shia LaBeouf first proved that he had the talent to headline an A-list big-screen adventure with this 2003 adaptation of Louis Sachar's book (co-starring Sigourney Weaver, Jon Voight, Patricia Arquette, and Tim Blake Nelson) about a group of juvenile detention kids forced by their warden to dig holes in an empty lakebed.   Dark Skies (December 22) Most Popular Keri Russell and Josh Hamilton are a married couple whose lives are hopelessly disrupted, and whose children wind up in peril, after the arrival of mysterious alien visitors in this sturdy 2013 sci-fi thriller. Just Friends (December 26) Ryan Reynolds is a former fat outcast who returns to his hometown hoping to reconnect with his high-school crush (Amy Smart), even as he deals with a wild pop star (Anna Faris) in his custody, in this 2005 rom-com. Spy Kids (December 27) Robert Rodriguez's kids franchise may have increasingly gone off the rails with its subsequent sequels, but 2001's original–about two siblings (Daryl Sabara and Alexa Vega) who must save their spy parents (Carla Gugino and Antonio Banderas)–remains a cheeky, outlandish family affair. The full list of movies leaving Netflix in December are below: 12/1/16",

      "title": "Steven Avery of 'Making a Murderer' Receives New Evidence Testing",
      "text": "\nLast Christmas season, we all binge-watched Netflix's true crime documentary Making a Murderer . The show surrounding the story of the mysterious death of Teresa Halbach has been confirmed for a second season , which will continue to focus on the convictions of her alleged murderer, Steven Avery. This follows the major announcement by Avery’s lawyer, Kathleen Zellner, that an agreement to start independent scientific testing on critical pieces of evidence has been signed. This agreement comes nearly three months after Zellner planned to have the 2007 murder conviction overturned.\nThe new testing will include key pieces of evidence such as the spare key from Halbach's car found inside Avery's bedroom, as well as Avery's blood sample. Avery was sentenced to life in prison after being convicted of first-degree intentional homicide in the 2005 death of photographer Teresa Halbach in Manitowoc County, Wisconsin. Earlier this month, a judge granted the release of Brendan Dassey, Avery’s nephew, who was convicted in 2007 of helping Avery allegedly rape, kill and mutilate Halbach. Make sure to stay tuned for season two of Making a Murderer .\nClick here to view full gallery at Hypebeast.com \n\n",

      "text": "‘Gilmore Girls’ are back – on Netflix | \nThe familiar voices float softly from a black screen, as if in a dream. \nThere’s Luke, gruffly: “How many cups have you had this morning?” \nAnd this parent-child banter: “Did you do something slutty?” Rory teasingly asks her mom. “I’m not THAT happy,” shoots back Lorelai. \nThankfully, it’s not imagined. It’s the reality of “Gilmore Girls,” returning Friday after a nine-year absence, during which longtime fans pined for what they’d lost and newcomers discovered what they’d missed through reruns. \nOpening-credit snippets of the show’s hallmark dialogue kick off Netflix’s sequel to the 2000-07 broadcast series with a promise: the characters, their snappy banter and the show’s key notes will be honored. \nBut the four-part “Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life” is aimed at more than true believers, creator Amy Sherman-Palladino said in an interview. \n“We want it to be something that fans are going to know, but if you haven’t watched ‘Gilmore,’ you can come to it fresh and take it on face value: It’s a story of three women, an intergenerational, multigenerational story, and you are catching them at times that each of their lives is changing.” \nThat trio around which the universe rotates consists of devoted single mom Lorelai Gilmore (Lauren Graham), her equally devoted daughter Rory (Alexis Bledel) and stern grandmother Emily (Kelly Bishop). As the first chapter opens, Lorelai and Rory are still the belles of fictional Connecticut hamlet Stars Hollow – so perfect, quips Lorelai, it belongs in a snow globe. \nLuke (Scott Patterson), Lorelai’s on-again, off-again love is here, as are the supporting characters who gave the show, well, character. That includes official town nudge Taylor (now lobbying for a sewer system); reliably idiosyncratic Kirk (he’s just launched Ooober, a nonapp version of Uber) and even, in one episode, buoyant chef Sookie (courtesy of film star Melissa McCarthy’s return to her TV roots). \nWhatever bliss viewers find in the girl-power dramedy’s resurrection may be exceeded only by that of Sherman-Palladino, who wrote and produced it with Dan Palladino, her husband and creative partner on the sequel and the original. \nThere’s a sad shadow, however, cast by the passing of family head Richard Gilmore. That reflects the December 2014 death of Edward Herr-mann, the respected actor who played him in the original series. \nThe 90-minute episodes follow the seasons and are titled for each, starting with “Winter.” While Lorelai and Emily face Richard’s death in their own way, they also find their relationship affected by it. \nGiven that all the episodes will be made available at once on streaming service Netflix, Sherman-Palladino sees trouble on the horizon. \nAfter holding close the four words she’s long said should end the Gilmore saga (she wasn’t in charge of the show’s last season on the CW network), she wants viewers to avoid spoiling the experience, either by posting the phrase or by impatiently jumping to the final scene. \n“It’s going to mean a lot more if you’ve taken the journey, and it’s going to mean a lot less if you just flip to the last page. ... It’s a fun trip. It’s worth it,” she said.  ",

      "text": "Report: Netflix is paying Dave Chappelle $60 million for comedy specials Posted by Liam McGuire on Nov 24, 2016 14:00 Dave Chappelle was a valuable asset for Comedy Central a decade ago, and as it turns out, he’s still a major draw in 2016. \nThe legendary comedian returned to the spotlight a few weeks back, hosting one of the most poignant, memorable Saturday Night Live episodes in recent memory. With the show being a critical success , Chappelle’s comeback after leaving Chappelle’s Show in 2006 is in full-force, especially once it was announced he’d be doing comedy specials for Netflix . \nWhat wasn’t known, though, was how much Netflix offered Chappelle to bring him back. The answer? \nA whole lot of money, according to Page Six : \n“Dave was offered $20 million a special,” an unnamed source told Page Six. “Netflix basically has a war chest for this kind of content. Whether it’s a loss or not, Dave Chappelle’s specials will get a lot of press and bring in new subscribers.” \nIt might seem like an insane cost, but Netflix hasn’t been shy about spending serious coin to get premium content. The networks early successful drama House of Cards reportedly cost $4.5 million per episode . Netflix also reportedly paid Chris Rock the same $20 million per special rate as Chappelle for his two releases. \nRegardless of the cost, Dave Chappelle returning to comedy is something for which we can all be thankful. \nWelcome back, Dave. \n[ Business Insider ] About Liam McGuire Staff writer for The Comeback.

      "text": "By SHANNON O'CONNOR / STAFF WRITER\nPublished: Nov. 24, 2016 Updated: 3:04 p.m. Here are 5 shows on Netflix, Amazon you should binge watch after Thanksgiving Print Photo Share Pin It More Galleries Rachel Bloom, left, stars as Rebecca Bunch and Santino Fontana stars as Greg Serrano in \"Crazy Ex-Girlfriend.\" EDDY CHEN, THE CW Related article » The dishes have been licked clean, the football games have ended and the turkey coma is finally setting in, so what is there to do now? Binge-watch some TV.\nThere is no better day to indulge in the cultural phenomenon than the day after Thanksgiving. So jump in (or stay in) your pajamas, find a comfy position on the couch and boot up Netflix or Amazon to one (or, if you are feeling adventurous, all) of these shows.\n\"Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life\"\nIt’s back! After months of hype and promotion, the four new 90-minute installments of “Gilmore Girls” are finally here . Take a trip back to Stars Hollow, Connecticut, and revisit Lorelai, Rory, Emily, Luke and all the other colorful townsfolk fans have come to adore. Whether you have been a long-time Gilmore fan or are just discovering the series (in this case, bonus because you get to binge more!) these installments should provide some laughs, tears and nostalgia. To accompany this binge, I suggest copious amounts of coffee, pop tarts and tater tots. Also keep pizza and tacos nearby, you know, just in case. All previous seasons are currently streaming on Netflix and the new episodes arrive on Nov. 25 at 12:01 a.m.\n\"Good Girls Revolt\"\nIn the past few weeks journalism has been an issue of much discussion, so there is no better time to dive into Amazon’s new series “Good Girls Revolt.” The series is loosely based on Lynn Povich’s book of the same name and is a fictionalized account of Povich and her female co-workers' struggle with a sexual discrimination case against Newsweek magazine over pay and gender equality in 1969. Though the show is set a few decades in the past, it brings to light many issues still plaguing women in the workforce today (ahem, the pay gap). All episodes of the series first season are available on Amazon.\n\"Crazy Ex-Girlfriend\"\nMusical lovers and people who love a good Southern California joke or reference, here's a show for you. Rachel Bloom’s “Crazy Ex-Girlfriend” is the musical-comedy extravaganza about a young New York hotshot lawyer who uproots her high-powered life to follow her old high school boyfriend back to West Covina only to find that he is in a serious relationship. Laughs, heartbreak and big (paradoxical) musical numbers ensue, but it is the heart in the show that will keep you coming back (although the music is pretty catchy, too). All episodes of the first season are available for streaming on Netflix. Season 2 is currently airing on The CW.\n\"Black Mirror\"\nIf you are in the mood for some more serious TV fare, try the bizarre but captivating anthology series “Black Mirror.” The series, which returned for a 6-episode third season late last month, tackles complex storylines that contribute to society’s greatest fears, including blackmail, technology and social media. And be ready for some twists and surprises. The show may make you paranoid, but just remember it is fiction (for now). All episodes are streaming on Netflix.\n“The Crown”\nThough at this point you may be a bit tired of politics and government, Netflix’s latest series “The Crown” about Queen Elizabeth II shouldn't be missed. Though we have seen versions of the Queen’s life on screen before, this 10-part series not only focuses on the life of Elizabeth herself but the lives of those around her. Fans of series such as “The Tudors” or “Reign” will undoubtedly be drawn to this British monarchy tale that has critics raving. All episodes of the first season are streaming on Netflix.\nRelated: 'Gilmore Girls' stars Lauren Graham and Alexis Bledel dish on new Netflix episodes Digital & Driveway Delivery - 50% Off",

      "text": "\nThe revival series Gilmore Girls: A Year In the Life is set to be released at 3:00 a.m. Eastern time and midnight Pacific time on Friday, November 25, 2016 (technically, tonight). If that is too late for you to stay awake, you can watch it all at your convenience, just beware of spoilers. Click here to watch the new season once it begins on Netflix. \nNetflix’s official synopsis of the series reads: \nSet nearly a decade after the finale of the original series, this revival follows Lorelai, Rory and Emily Gilmore through four seasons of change.\nOver the course of the mini-series, minus actor Edward Hermann who passed away in 2014, all of the men in Rory Gilmore’s life will return – Logan, Jess and Dean. And, all of the delightfully odd characters from the original television series are back as well. Even actress Melissa McCarthy has come back.\nWhen it comes to the overall storyline, show-runner Amy Sherman-Pallidino told Entertainment Weekly , that Grandpa Richard Gilmore’s death will carry throughout the series. \nActress Kelly Bishop, who plays Richard’s wife Emily, recalled found memories of having Hermann on set, telling EW : \nIt’s sad without my darling Edward Herrmann. We used to do our crossword puzzle together in the makeup trailer. If we had a short day and were feeling festive or belligerent, we’d go across the street and have a martini together.\nScott Patterson, who plays Luke Danes on the show, added: \n[Herrmann’s death] left a big void, but Amy honored it beautifully. He’s throughout … these stories. It’s a wonderful homage to him as a person and to his character as well. It’s nice to have him around.\nAs for what to expect from the mini-series revival in terms of where the characters are in their lives on the show, Palladino told USA Today :\nIt had been enough time that all the stories seemed clear, where they would be, what they would be grappling with. If we had done it earlier, it might have been too soon. \nActress Lauren Graham also stated: \nIt’s been exactly like the old show and then completely new and different. Just a little grown up … That wonderful, fun language that’s so playful. We get to play a million different little characters within the character. It’s just been an overwhelmingly happy experience. I have been weirdly and inappropriately emotional the whole time.\nSo, now that you know what to expect and what time the show will be released, get ready for a year of the Gilmore Girls . And, though the series is set to be released at 3:00 a.m., Netflix has been known to surprise viewers with slightly early releases. So, you never know if it could come out a couple hours earlier. But, most likely, the show will premiere as scheduled. \nGilmore Girls Reunion at ATX Festival 2015: The Photos You Need to See Tonight was the Gilmore Girls reunion at the 2015 ATX Festival.

      "text": "If you’ve seen Michael Che’s subtle and deadpan comedy as the co-host of Saturday Night Live ‘s “Weekend Update,” you’ll be surprised by his hilarious, take-no-prisoners style on controversial topics in his Netflix special, Michael Che Matters , which will premiere Friday on the streaming service.\nNetflix is leading the charge ahead of networks like Comedy Central by hosting up-and-coming black comedians along with seasoned veterans. Che, who grew up on New York’s Lower East Side and was named after Che Guevara by his father (the comedian was born Michael Che Campbell), is one of several comedians who are part of Netflix’s rollout of comedy specials, including Cedric the Entertainer, whose special aired Sept. 16; Reggie Watts, whose special will air Dec. 6; and Gabriel Iglesias whose special will air Dec. 20. Chris Rock is returning to stand-up after an eight-year absence with two new specials for Netflix that will tape in 2017.\nNetflix also dropped the bomb earlier this week that Dave Chappelle will be airing two never-before-seen specials that come directly from his personal comedy vault along with another show in 2017. He reportedly received $60 million for the deal.\nFor Che, 33, this will be his first comedy special. He has worked as a correspondent for The Daily Show , a writer and cast member for SNL and in 2014, became the first black co-anchor in the history of “Weekend Update.”\nHe brings an understated New York B-boy sensibility, dressed in a hoodie, jeans and Air Force 1s, and mixes it with a quirky take on serious issues like police brutality, homophobia, white Jesus, catcalling and white supremacy, all with unpredictable twists.\nChe on the black man’s burdens of being called a n–ger and then having to fight: You can’t say, “I got my ass kicked for 15 minutes.”\nOn white supremacy and racism: “You know what kind of self-confidence you need to be a supremacist. You think Hitler had body-image issues?”\nOn saying All Lives Matter over Black Live Matters: “That’s like my wife asking me if I love her. Baby, I love everybody, what are you talking about?”\nOn police brutality: “Blacks and cops aren’t getting along. I don’t know if you’ve seen the news in the last 400 years.”\nOn white people asking can they say the n-word: “It’s like having an alcoholic ask for a sip of my drink. I don’t want to be responsible for what happens.”\nOn Jesus being black: “You insist on having that black baby. Well, keep him in the manger over there.”\nChe’s special, Michael Che Matters , taped at Greenpoint Terminal Warehouse in Brooklyn, N.Y., airs Friday on Netflix. \n",

      "text": "'Gilmore Girls' Returns On Netflix, Just In Time For A Holiday Binge 'Gilmore Girls' Returns On Netflix, Just In Time For A Holiday Binge Audio will be available later today. \nLauren Graham and Alexis Bledel return for four movies continuing the Gilmore Girls story. Saeed Adyani/Netflix hide caption toggle caption Lauren Graham and Alexis Bledel return for four movies continuing the Gilmore Girls story. Saeed Adyani/Netflix \nMost television shows arrive accompanied by the question, \"Is it good?\" Revivals of old shows, however, often arrive with the question, \"Is it necessary?\" \nThe four new 90-minute installments of Gilmore Girls that arrived Friday on Netflix under the title Gilmore Girls: A Year In The Life fare better by that adjusted standard than most. Gilmore Girls , which ran from 2000 to 2007, was a good show, and because creator Amy Sherman-Palladino left before the seventh and final season following a contractual dispute, she didn't get to end it the way she wanted to. Moreover, the reason to watch Gilmore Girls was always to spend time in its constructed universe, observing the relationships it built, and listening to its stylish dialogue and its \"la-la-la\" music. Most of the frustrations were around plot developments, in fact; most of the pleasures came from being in the characters' company. To be in their company again feels very much like television's closest approximation of the same holiday catch-up that happens in real life — that's one of the reasons the Thanksgiving weekend release is such clever timing. Article continues after sponsorship \nWe don't find Lorelai Gilmore (Lauren Graham) and her daughter Rory (Alexis Bledel) where we left them in 2007. The original series followed Lorelai from the 32-year-old mom of a 16-year-old to the almost-40 mom of a college graduate, and now Lorelai is pushing 50 and Rory is a grown, published writer. Time has been allowed to pass in their lives, and in the lives of everyone they knew. \nThe biggest change in Gilmore world is that Lorelai's father, Richard, has passed away like Edward Herrmann, who played him. This leaves Lorelai's mother, Emily — beautifully performed without so much as a dropped beat by the divine Kelly Bishop — to find a path forward without her husband of 50 years. As much as Herrmann is missed, and he is missed, the mother-daughter relationships between Emily and Lorelai and Lorelai and Rory have always been the best reason to watch Gilmore Girls . Sherman-Palladino, like any good writer, uses the grief that can't be avoided to tell new stories and to push particularly Lorelai's relationship with her mother to new places. And that, again, plays to the show's longtime strengths: other shows had snappy dialogue and other shows embraced quirky small towns, but very few writers cared about moms and daughters with the depth and focus that Sherman-Palladino did. \nIt's sort of funny, then, that so much of the chatter around the revival has been around revisiting the long-arc love story of Lorelai and Luke, and — inevitably — squabbling over the prospects of Rory's assorted disappointing boyfriends. For many women, the expectation that if you're single at the end of college, you are destined to either remain so or return to a man you already know would be alarming. But for Rory, there's a lot of fan talk about preferences as between Dean (the nice-guy first boyfriend turned disastrous affair), Jess (the rebellious second boyfriend), and Logan (the rich Yalie boyfriend). All return for the revival, but not in equal measure. As in life, some ghosts hang around, and some do not. I wouldn't dream of giving away the game here, but I will say that my own sympathies regarding The Legion Of Disappointing Boyfriends are not the same as they were when all these young men were younger men. And that's true to life, as well. \nSherman-Palladino has always been an idiosyncratic creator; that's what makes her work special. The bargain, though, is that every idiosyncratic creator will baffle you at some point with an offbeat idea that seems not to belong. There are a couple of those sequences here, particularly in the middle two segments, \"Spring\" and \"Summer,\" both of which have their writing and direction credited to Sherman-Palladino's husband, Daniel Palladino (the two collaborated on the original show as well). Some of these are easier to forgive given that they seem to arise from efforts to use guest stars well — particularly Sutton Foster, who starred in Sherman-Palladino's short-lived but dearly missed series Bunheads and who shows up in Stars Hollow under circumstances that it would be impolite to spoil and that, frankly, don't matter very much. There are actually a number of Bunheads -related sightings, which is entirely consistent with the truism that whatever else is said about Sherman-Palladino's work, it's never less than fully transparent how dearly she loves it and how personally she takes it. In fact, that's one of the reasons it's good to see her wrap up this story as she intended, even independent of whether it entirely pleases you or not. \nA friend of mine coined the term \"anticippointment\" to describe the way eagerness to return to a show like this often gives way to a realization that it couldn't quite give you everything you hoped for. This revival is not immune. Four 90-minute episodes amount to about the same running time as maybe eight and a half vintage Gilmore Girls episodes, or a little more than a third of a season. And in that third of a season, they have seven seasons of history to acknowledge, ignore, recall, or expand upon. They've also got to establish what's happened in the last nine years, complete three major storylines (Lorelai's, Rory's and Emily's), and perform a lot of what's derisively known as \"fan service\" — giving the people what they want. The people want to see Mrs. Kim again, and Babette, and Kirk, and if those names aren't meaningful to you, this revival probably isn't intended for you, particularly. \nThe good news is that if you're not a Gilmore Girls person and your relatives are eager to watch it over the holidays, there's plenty of that staccato dialogue and family playfulness to entertain and divert you. It just won't resonate the way it might if you've been watching since Rory wore her private-school uniform and formed her first friendships.",

      "text": "Thanksgiving Horror Film Kristy Lands on Netflix Posted on Pinterest Stumbleupon Pocket Tumblr Google Subscribe \nThe release strategy for Oliver Blackburn’s Kristy has been anything but conventional, as the film finally premiered on Lifetime last month – two years after making a splash at the 2013 AFM. Those who missed it will be happy to learn that it’s now available for instant streaming on Netflix. \nRead on for everything you need to know before streaming! \nFrom director Oliver “Olly” Blackburn ( Donkey Punch ) and producers David Kirschner (the Child’s Play series), Corey Sienega ( Frailty, Bride of Chucky, Seed of Chucky ), and Jamie Patricof and Lynette Howell ( Blue Valentine, Place Beyond the Pines ), comes a new thriller starring Haley Bennett ( Music and Lyrics ), Ashley Greene ( The Twilight Saga, The Apparition ), Erica Ash ( Scary Movie 5 ), Lucas Till ( X-Men: First Class ), and Chris Coy (TV’s “True Blood”). Anthony Jaswinski ( Vanishing on 7th Street ) penned the script. \nSynopsis: With the rest of the campus at home for the Thanksgiving holiday, Justine (Bennett) and a few of her friends spend the weekend in their college dormitory: studying, relaxing, and blissfully unaware of the terror that is about to unfold outside in the cold. Suddenly, confronted by a gang of violent outcasts, Justine’s quiet weekend becomes one long lesson in survival as she and her classmates are terrorized in increasingly bizarre and brutal ways, leaving it up to her to figure out who the attackers are… and if they can be stopped.

      "text": "13 hours ago 10:02 PM © Netflix 25 November 2016 11:24 AM Shares Warning: This article contains spoilers for the Gilmore Girls revival - and particularly the final episode. Read at your own risk! It's been a long wait... but the final four words of Gilmore Girls have finally been revealed. Series creator Amy Sherman-Palladino has apparently always known exactly how the show would wrap up - and got to deliver her vision in 'Fall'. © Netflix Advertisement - Continue Reading Below The final instalment of the Netflix revival ended with Lorelai (Graham) and Rory (Alexis Bledel) sitting together on a gazebo - shortly after Lorelai and Luke (Scott Patterson) finally tied the knot. But Rory had some surprising news to deliver... \"Mom?\" \"Yeah?\" \"I'm pregnant.\" So there you have it. But who's the daddy? Odds are it's Rory's dud boyfriend Paul (Jack Carpenter) - though Logan (Matt Czuchry) could be a contender. Sherman-Palladino told the Hollywood Reporter that she found the \"emotional moment\" very \"satisfying\" after so long. \"We really had a very specific journey in our minds and we fulfilled the journey. So to us, this is the piece that we wanted to do.\" © Netflix So does that mean another trip to Stars Hollow is a no-go? Even though A Year in the Life ends on something of a cliffhanger? Lauren Graham told Digital Spy that it's \" hard to say \" whether Gilmore Girls will come back... again. \"I'll be curious when all the episodes are out because this feels like such a grassroots thing – the people brought Gilmore Girls back so I think it's up to the people if they think the ending feels satisfying enough. \"If it does I wouldn't want to touch it. To me it ends in a really satisfying way that could also continue... so I guess we'll see.\" Want up-to-the-minute entertainment and tech news?

      "text": "Jimmy Fallon has plenty of theories for the long-rumored final four words in Netflix's upcoming Gilmore Girls revival.\nSitting down Tuesday with Gilmore Girls' Luke, Kirk and Paris (Scott Patterson, Sean Gunn and Liza Weil), Fallon pitched his ideas for the last scene as well. Fallon even started off the segment with his own rendition of his new favorite show's theme song by Carol King.\n\"I'm freaking out,\" Fallon said in announcing his favorite three characters. Calling it the \"best show ever,\" Fallon confirmed that \"every night I go to sleep to Gilmore Girls.\" He's currently on season five, and already has a theory about those last four words , said to have been showrunner Amy Sherman-Palladino's plan for the show all along. Is the whole town inside a snow globe?\nRead more: 'Gilmore Girls' \"Epic\" Final Four Words: Cast Shares Their Predictions\nWelcoming three of his favorite Gilmore Girls characters, Fallon grilled the trio on those rumored final words.\nGunn said he still doesn't know what they are. \"I want to watch it with the fans and see,\" he told Fallon. \"Maybe it's 'Kirk is your overlord.' \"\nPatterson said he pitched \"Drop the gun, Kirk,\" but Sherman-Palladino rejected his idea. Fallon's idea? \"Stars Hollow never existed.\"\nOn the Netflix revival, which debuts Nov. 25, Patterson said the outpouring of excitement from the fans now is touching, but not too surprising. \"The fans see it as a religion, it's not just a show to them,\" he explained. \"And we knew during the original run how the fans were reacting to it, so it's not really a surprise.\"\nGunn agreed, adding that \"it feels like the show is more popular now than it ever was. So to hear fans are so excited for it, for a show that we did 15 years ago, it's crazy.\"\nWeil said it was \"bizarre to go back\" to the show after leaving her character of Paris so long ago and moving on to ABC's How to Get Away With Murder. Patterson told Fallon that he had to take a walk around the town before being able to find his character again.\nLast week, the Tonight Show host updated the audience on his binge-watching of the original series (he was still on season four) and listed his favorite characters . Taylor Doose, Luke, Kirk and Sookie all made the cut, with his all-time favorite being Paris Geller (Weil), Rory Gilmore's friend and rival.\nWatch the video below.\nRead more: 'Gilmore Girls': 9 Big Takeaways From the Netflix Revival Trailer",

      "text": "Frank Yemi \nSeason 2 of Stranger Things has been confirmed and the anticipated Netflix original has a lot more in store for fans. The air date is expected in 2017 and while no official release date has been announced, it is expected that Netflix will continue its original scheduled lineup and release it around July 2017. Finn Wolfhard for Dazed Magazine #StrangerThings pic.twitter.com/pH4uve4BAQ \n— MEFeater Magazine (@mefeater) November 23, 2016 \nMillie Bobby Brown is returning as Eleven; however, it is still unclear if she will be a regular or a guest star as the series have added several additional cast members. Stranger Things creators The Duffer Brothers revealed that they may change some of the titles for season 2 because they don’t want to give too much away. \nMillie Bobby Brown’s Eleven is one of the biggest secrets of Stranger Things Season 2. In an interview, David Harbour, who plays Hopper, confirmed that the Eggo waffles he leaves in the season finale are in fact for Eleven. He revealed that his character believes that Eleven exist in “some form,” which suggest the beloved character may not be herself when she returns in season 2.

It's lit. #StrangerThings pic.twitter.com/ZxL4ZItaTr \n— Geeks Of Color (@GeeksOfColor) November 8, 2016 \nThere are several new cast members joining in season 2 of Stranger Things . Two new characters Max played by actress Sadie Sink and Billy played by Dacre Montgomery will be siblings. The first episode of season 2 is titled “Madmax”, which provides some insight to a character who is described as “a tough and confident girl whose appearance, behavior, and pursuits seem more typical of boys than of girls in this era. She has a complicated history and is generally suspicious of those around her,” according to The Hollywood Reporter . Sadie Sink will play tomboy Max, and Dacre Montgomery will play step-brother Billy in Season 2 of Stranger Things. pic.twitter.com/HX3QeMe6w5 \n— Anne (@momsfilms) October 16, 2016 \nHer step-brother Billy is more of a bad boy who drives a black Camaro and it good with the ladies. Comedian Brett Gelman will join the cast of season two to play a conspiracy theorist and disgraced journalist Murray Bauman who shows up in Hawkins, Indiana – a very strange town that could potentially prove a story he is chasing.

(@ComicBookNOW) November 18, 2016 \nThe Duffer brother have revealed that there are a lot of details about the Upside Down world that will slowly be introduced as the series progresses. The show will continue it’s 80’s themed plot and draw inspiration from popular pop culture classics of that era. Just when you thought #StrangerThings couldn't get more '80s … https://t.co/waJg5hjPla \n— Mashable (@mashable) November 7, 2016 \nThe Stranger Things kids included Will Byers are expected to return and have been photographed filming scenes from season 2 of Stranger Things . Due to the maturation of the young cast members, the second season will begin about 12 months after the events of the first season’s finale. The Duffer Brothers have said that the time jump will be explained and viewers will have to put some of the pieces together as the episodes progress. \nNancy Wheeler and Jonathan may not end up together but the writers have not written off the idea. Many fans are hoping that recovering d-bag Steve Harrington blows it with Nancy so that she could be with Jonathan. Barbara will also get some form of justice; however, she will remain dead. \nAnother mystery of Stranger Things Season 2 is whether the monster is dead or there is more of them out there. Some fans are making theories based off the titles for the episodes, which sort of confirms that the next season will feature nine episodes as follows: \n1 – Madmax \n2 – The Boy Who Came Back to Life \n3 – The Pumpkin Patch",

      "text": "[Warning: This story contains spoilers from the fourth and final installment of Netflix's Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life, \"Fall.\"]\nThe final four words have finally been spoken.\nFor nearly a decade, Gilmore Girls fans have been clamoring to find out the final four words that creator Amy Sherman-Palladino wanted the series to end with. When Netflix officially greenlit the four-part revival, Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life, last January, it not only represented a chance for die-hard viewers to get to revisit Stars Hollow and catch up with all their favorite residents, but much more importantly, a chance to finally see just how Sherman-Palladino intended for the beloved series to wrap.\nEveryone, that is, except Lauren Graham.\n\"I didn't know it was a thing actually,\" Graham told The Hollywood Reporter about the highly anticipated final scene. \"I didn't know until halfway through filming this that those existed and then Amy told them to me on the set. I was surprised for a minute and then it made complete sense.\"\nThe fourth and final 90-minute chapter of the revival, titled \"Fall,\" ended with Lorelai (Graham) and Rory (Alexis Bledel) sitting together in the gazebo mere hours after Lorelai and Luke (Scott Patterson) finally tied the knot. Rory (finally) got dumped from her basically non-existent and very unmemorable boyfriend Paul but as Lorelai reassured her that both she and Paul would find their \"someone amazing,\" Rory began to look increasingly distraught. Then, Rory turned to her mother suddenly. \"Mom?\" she said. \"Yeah,\" Lorelai responded. \"I'm pregnant,\" Rory said. Cue a profile shot of Lorelai's stunned face and then the screen cut to the credits, with the iconic theme song playing.\nRead more: 'Gilmore Girls' Team Open Up About Netflix Revival and \"Journey\" to Those Final Four Words\nAlthough the final four words were never written down in the script for \"Fall,\" Graham said she was still reluctant to read the script for the final installment and find out just how things would wrap up.\n\"I had a very general sense of where Lorelai was that made complete sense to me and then, what I didn't know exactly is how it would end,\" Graham recalled. \"For the longest time, I couldn't read 'Fall,' which is our last episode. I was like, 'This is psychotic, I have to read where this ends up,' but I think I was both worried it wouldn't be satisfying and also just kind of wanted to save it. Eventually, I read it and it was very satisfying.\"\nWhen it came time to actually film the famed final four words, Bledel said she felt \"a lot of pressure to get it right, to make it awesome. More than anything, I was just trying to be really focused and really present just to make sure that whatever I did in the scene felt rooted in my experience of the character and I was communicating something that felt real to me.\"\nLooking back, Sherman-Palladino said it was an \"interesting\" experience finally seeing the words that had been living in her head come to life so many years later.\nRead more: 'Gilmore Girls' \"Epic\" Final Four Words: Cast Shares Their Predictions\n\"It was emotional for like Lauren, Alexis, [executive producer] Dan [Palladino] and me, but you're surrounded by a giant crew that only care about lunch and they want to move on and the [director of photography]'s losing the light, the [production assistants] are all talking to each other or on their headphones and we're trying to get the extras to shut up…\"\nPalladino chimed in: \"You're surrounded by people that don't give a flying f-.\"\nHowever, Sherman-Palladino said there was a silver lining to filming the highly anticipated moment under such \"weird\" circumstances, as she herself called it. \"Otherwise it would just be a sob fest and we'd all be like lying on the ground waiting until the valium arrived.\"\nDespite years of build-up, Sherman-Palladino said the final scene lived up to her expectations. \"It was satisfying in the context of when we put it altogether,\" she said. \"It's an emotional moment.\"\nBut will that emotional - and surprising - moment really be the end of Gilmore Girls? As Sherman-Palladino previously told THR , she's waiting to see just how viewers embrace A Year in the Life before plotting a next move.\n\"We really had a very specific journey in our minds and we fulfilled the journey. So to us, this is the piece that we wanted to do. And the whole thought about, is there more, is there more, is there more - this has to go out into the universe now,\" Sherman-Palladino said. \"And then whatever happens, happens.\"\nWhat did you think of the final four words?

      "text": "gg2 More In lieu of a second Gilmore Girls revival, perhaps Netflix could just release footage of Team Palladino’s initial pitch for A Year in the Life ? Because we have a hunch it would play very well with audiences.\nRELATED Gilmore Girls Revival Ends on a Cliffhanger?! Plus: Lorelai and Luke Are Definitely Not [Spoiler]\nAs exec producer Daniel Palladino tells me, he and series creator Amy Sherman-Palladino prepared an hour-long pitch for the four-part continuation and presented it to three outlets (including the winning suitor, Netflix). At each of the three meetings, “It was me, Amy and a couple of Warner Bros. executives,” Palladino shares. “And we went into some detail.”\nThat’s putting it mildly.\n“Amy and I would perform certain key dialogue moments — especially comedic ones where describing them just wouldn’t do it justice — with a performance,” he explains. “Otherwise, over the course of the hour it would’ve gotten very dull. There were whole monologues of Lorelai’s that Amy would perform. I would sometimes play Lorelai, too. And sometimes we would recite dialogue back and forth. And sometimes we would stand. That’s how we always pitch things — with a lot of dialogue and a lot of performance.”\nThe duo — who wrote and directed all four 90-minute revival chapters (which drop this Friday at 3:01 am EST) — went into the pitching sessions with only a verbal commitment from the cast. “We talked to the principal four — Lauren [Graham], Alexis [Bledel], Scott [Patterson]and Kelly [Bishop],” notes Palladino. “And we asked them, ‘If we were to do this, would you do it?’ If one of them said they absolutely wouldn’t do it, we would not have proceeded.”\nCheck back in the coming hours and days for more from Stars Hollow’s elite as TVLine’s “ 18 Days of Gilmore ” scoop countdown continues.\nLaunch Gallery: <i>Gilmore</i> Revival: Ausiello's Take\nRelated stories\nGilmore Girls: A Year in the Life Recap: 'Spring' Is For (Troubled) Lovers\nGilmore Girls: A Year in the Life Recap: 'Winter' Is a Fan's Wonderland\nGilmore Girls' Keiko Agena Tackles That Other Mystery: Where Is Mr. Kim?!\nGet more from TVLine : Follow us on Twitter , Facebook , Newsletter",

      "text": "Jimmy Fallon has plenty of theories for the long-rumored final four words in Netflix's upcoming Gilmore Girls revival.\nSitting down on Tuesday with Gilmore Girls' Luke, Kirk and Paris (Scott Patterson, Sean Gunn and Liza Weil), Fallon pitched his ideas for the last scene as well. Fallon even started off the segment with his own rendition of his new favorite show's theme song by Carol King.\n\"I'm freaking out,\" Fallon said in announcing his favorite three characters. Calling it the \"best show ever,\" Fallon confirmed that \"every night I go to sleep to Gilmore Girls.\" He's currently in season five, and already has a theory about those last four words , said to have been showrunner Amy Sherman-Palladino's plan for the show all along. Is the whole town inside a snow globe?\nRead more: 'Gilmore Girls' \"Epic\" Final Four Words: Cast Shares Their Predictions\nWelcoming three of his favorite Gilmore Girls characters, Fallon grilled the trio on those rumored final words.\nGunn said he still doesn't know what they are. \"I want to watch it with the fans and see,\" he told Fallon. \"Maybe it's 'Kirk is your overlord.'\"\nPatterson said he pitched \"Drop the gun, Kirk,\" but Sherman-Palladino rejected his idea. Fallon's idea? \"Stars Hollow never existed.\"\nOn the Netflix revival, which debuts Nov. 25, Patterson said the outpouring of excitement from the fans now is touching, but not too surprising. \"The fans see it as a religion, it's not just a show to them,\" he explained. \"And we knew during the original run how the fans were reacting to it, so it's not really a surprise.\"\nGunn agreed, adding that \"it feels like the show is more popular now than it ever was. So to hear fans are so excited for it, for a show that we did 15 years ago, it's crazy.\"\nWeil said it was \"bizarre to go back\" to the show after leaving her character of Paris so long ago and moving on to ABC's How to Get Away With Murder. Patterson told Fallon that he had to take a walk around the town before being able to find his character again.\nLast week, the Tonight Show host updated the audience on his binge-watching of the original series (he was still on season four) and listed out his favorite characters . Taylor Doose, Luke, Kirk and Sookie all made the cut, with his all-time favorite being Paris Geller (Weil), Rory Gilmore's friend and rival.\nWatch the video below.\nRead more: 'Gilmore Girls': 9 Big Takeaways From the Netflix Revival Trailer",

      "text": "By Mallory Carra 2 hours ago \nThere are so many things to love about Netflix's Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life , which premieres Nov. 25, but one of the best parts about it is all the people who have returned to reprise their roles. Stars Hollow just wouldn't be the same without Sookie, Jackson, Lane, Kirk, Babette, Taylor, and so many others. But in addition to those familiar faces, there are so many awesome guest stars and cameo appearances in the Gilmore Girls revival . There are spoilers ahead for Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life , so stop reading now if you don't want to know who plays who. \nFrom celebrity chefs to Tony-award winners, these exciting new faces grace Stars Hollow (and beyond) as themselves or various characters in the four-part revival of the beloved 2000s TV show. G ilmore Girls: A Year in the Life takes viewers back into the world of Stars Hollow and everyone's favorite mother-daughter pair, Lorelai (Lauren Graham) and Rory Gilmore (Alexis Bledel). In the four new extended episodes on Netflix, fans are literally taken through a year in the life of the Gilmores now — and all the fan favorite characters have grown since the original series ended in 2007, yet they've also stayed true to themselves. \nBut part of the fun of the show is seeing who drops by the Gilmore world— and many big names do come on by throughout episodes \"Winter, \"Spring,\" Summer,\" and \"Fall.\" 1. Roy Choi (Himself) \nIf you've ever chased down a food truck, you have this Los Angeles-based chef legend to thank for making the trend popular. Choi is the inspiration behind the movie Chef and the mastermind behind the famous Kogi BBQ trucks, among other acclaimed restaurants in LA. So foodies will be delighted to see Choi hosting a pop-up dinner at the Dragonfly Inn — that is, until Lorelai fires him for not being Sookie. 2. Rachael Ray (Herself) \nThe quintessential Food Network cook and morning show host also does a short stint as the Dragonfly Inn chef, but like Choi, Ray isn't the beloved Sookie. Seriously though, Sookie is the best. 3. Melissa McCarthy (Sookie) \nAnd yes, then Sookie finally reunites with Lorelai. This is considered a high-profile cameo now, because McCarthy has deservedly become a comedy superstar since the original Gilmore Girls series ended. 4. Sutton Foster (Violet) \nThe Tony Award-winning actor and self-proclaimed Gilmore Girls superfan appears in the revival as Violet , a struggling actor in the Stars Hollow Musical and a role created for her, according to an interview with Entertainment Weekly . \nFoster is new to Gilmore world, but she's a frequent collaborator with creator Amy Sherman-Palladino. Her Gilmore Girls character name could be a reference to the musical Violet , in which Foster starred in and Sherman-Palladino produced. Before starring in Younger , Foster headlined the short-lived series Bunheads , also created by Sherman-Palladino. 5. Mae Whitman (Marcy) \nGraham's former Parenthood co-star makes a brief, but memorable cameo in Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life . 6. Christian Borle (Carl) \nThe two-time Tony Award-winner guest stars as Carl in the episode \"Summer,\" in which he co-stars with ex-wife Foster in the Stars Hollow musical, as reported by Playbill. According to the publication, Borle and Foster became big fans of the show when they used to watch it together. 7. Alex Kingston (Naomi Shropshire) \nThe Doctor Who alum plays an eccentric, but elegant Brit who Rory works with on a book proposal. 8. Vanessa Marano (April) \nYep, the Switched at Birth actor returns as Luke's daughter in the revival series. 9. Danny Strong (Doyle) \nThe actor is now the co-creator and executive producer of the Fox hit TV series Empire , but Strong makes a brief cameo as Paris Gellar's now-ex-husband Doyle — who is also now a big shot screenwriter (ahem). 10. David Sutcliffe (Christopher) \nSigh. Of course, Christopher makes a cameo, because he just can't stay away from the Gilmore women. 11. Chris Eigeman (Jason Stiles) \nLorelai's ex-boyfriend and Richard's former colleague makes a cameo at the Gilmore patriarch's funeral. 12. Dan Bucatinsky (Jim Nelson) \nThe former Scandal star makes a cameo as a big time editor with whom Rory meets with at Conde Nast. 13. Gregg Henry (Mitchum Huntzberger) \nYep, Logan's father briefly returns in the revival and he seems to have softened towards Rory. 14. Paula Anka (Himself/Paul Anka The Dog) \nThe legendary singer himself returns to the series for another cameo in another Lorelai dream sequence. 15. Julia Goldani Telles (Sandee) \nThe Bunheads and The Affair actor plays the CEO of the website SandeeSays, which is pursuing Rory for her work. 16. Carole King (Sophie Bloom) \nThe Gilmore Girls theme song singer reprises her role as Sophie Bloom and even belts a few notes of one of her famous tunes. 17. Jared Padalecki (Dean) \nThe Supernatural star drops by to step back into the role of Rory's first boyfriend. 18. Stacey Oristano (Allie) \nThe former Bunheads actor plays a character named Allie in the revival. 19. Milo Ventimiglia (Jess) \nBe still my heart. The This is Us star returns to the series in his breakout role, sending Team Jess hearts a-flutter everywhere. 20. Emily Bergl (Francie) \nThe leader of The Puffs indeed returns for one more showdown with Paris Gellar. 21. Matt Czuchry (Logan) \nThe former Good Wife actor returns to the role of Rory's college boyfriend. 22. Jason Mantzoukas (Robert Castellanos) \nThe Brooklyn Nine-Nine actor appears in the episode \"Spring\" as Naomi's laywer. 23. Kerry Butler (Claudia) \nThe actor steps into the challenging role of being Emily and Lorelai's therapist. 24. George Anthony Bell (Stanley) \nThe actor and dialogue coach for the show made a cameo as Stanley at the cemetery in \"Summer.\" 25. Peter Krause \nGraham's Parenthood co-star and boyfriend made a cameo as a park ranger (who calls himself Park Ranger) who Lorelai encounters on the Pacific Crest Trail in \"Summer.\" 26. Jason Ritter \nGraham's Parenthood co-star also makes a cameo as Ranger Bill on the Pacific Coast Trail in \"Summer.\" \nMore to come... \nImages: Saeed Adyani/Netflix; staceyoristano /Twitter Must Reads ",

      "text": "Two weeks after its launch, Netflix content boss Ted Sarandos seems extremely pleased with The Crown.\nThe pricey drama about the Queen Elizabeth II debuted to solid reviews on Nov. 4. And, speaking at a Thursday panel for nonprofit Visionary Women, Sarandos assured the room that the streamer would be airing the drama for the next decade.\n\"We're in production now on the second season,\" said Sarandos, appearing with Arrested Development collaborator Brian Grazer. \"This is going to take Queen Elizabeth from age 29 to, presumably, the current day. We'll see it lay out over decades. We've seen a lot of things about Queen Elizabeth, but we've already learned more about her than we ever had by watching the first ten hours.\"\nFrom royal family enthusiast Peter Morgan, who previous chronicled her majesty in The Queen, The Crown was eyed as a long-running series from the start - perhaps why Netflix ponied up north of $100 million for the first two seasons. \"It's a crazy idea to come in with a 60-hour pitch,\" Sarandos continued. \"The idea is to do this over six decades, in six seasons presumably, and make the whole show over eight to 10 years.\"\nRead more: 'The Crown': TV Review\nSarandos' eagerness to give the green light was a recurring theme in the conversation. He and Grazer also spoke about the pitch process and Sarandos' particular reluctance to turn people down.\n\"Most people in town spend all day saying no, and I try to figure out how to say yes,\" said Sarandos. \"I want them all to work when they come in. When I'm watching a TV show or a movie, I never walk out or turn it off - no matter how bad. I think I'm waiting for the good part.\"\nNetflix's widely reported spending spree was an obvious undertone of the conversation as well. The $6 billion (and growing) commitment for original programming is going to lead to more and more niche shows. Sarandos pointed to senior-centric comedy Grace and Frankie as one area where Netflix had been underserving a segment of its existing (and potential) subscribership.\n\"If you have a global business, like Netflix, little niches can be big business,\" he added. \"Our shows just have to work eventually. \"",

All that really needs to be said — not quite a decade after the show concluded its seven-year run — is that 32-year-old Rory (Alexis Bledel) comes back to visit Stars Hollow, where she finds her mom Lorelai (Lauren Graham) as feisty and fast-talking as ever, along with a lot of other familiar faces. \nThose include Lorelai’s mom (Kelly Bishop), still wrestling with the grief of her loss; and Luke (Scott Patterson), who in one of the amusing recurring gags keeps giving out wrong passwords for his diner’s Wi-Fi access. \nThe four-season structure actually creates some problems. At 90 minutes, the story tends to meander, providing lots of time for rat-a-tat banter (and references to things that weren’t on the radar when the show signed off, like “Game of Thrones”) but moving the plot along at a snail’s pace. \nSo while there’s plenty of trademark whimsy, there are also indulgences like the musical number in the third episode, which is clever but drags on too long. \nThose pacing issues also apply to the closing chapter, which, without giving anything away, allowed Sherman-Palladino to craft an ending she was denied, having left before the show completed its network run. \nGranted, this tepid appraisal comes from someone who, unlike much of the critical community, wasn’t gaga for “Gilmore” during its original incarnation. For the faithful, just seeing the cast re-inhabit these characters — or savoring interludes like Lorelai and her mom awkwardly braving therapy sessions — is probably reward enough. \nNetflix’s pragmatism in bankrolling such revivals nevertheless contains a whiff of cynicism, inasmuch as it’s so obviously designed to bolster the “If you just watched” part of its algorithm, while exploiting a media sphere that increasingly caters to the passions of small fan bases, in essence serving as its eager marketing partner. \nIt’s hard to argue with the strategy, validated by the fact “Gilmore Girls” has been trending since the review embargo broke November 16. To borrow from a Carole King song, that’s because the streaming service has recognized that even if something like “Gilmore Girls” isn’t a showstopper, where it leads, we will follow. \n“Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life” premieres November 25 on Netflix.

      "text": "in You Do You \nNow that Thanksgiving is just days away, we have to come to terms with the fact that November is basically over. Seriously, where did the time go? Fortunately, the weather is cooling down and we can take that as an excuse to be lazy AF without any remorse. \nSo, curl up with your favorite soft blanket or holiday beverage and hit play on one of these Netflix December additions. You deserve it. 1. National Lampoon’s Animal House (1978) \nIf you’ve never seen this National Lampoon film, you officially have no more excuses because the ’70s cult classic is hitting Netflix next month. When college freshmen Larry (Thomas Hulce) and Kent (Stephen Furst) join a rowdy fraternity on campus, things get hilariously out of control and you might just need a pitcher of beer to really laugh at this one. \nWatch the trailer HERE 2. Beverly Hills Cop (1984) \nIn one of Eddie Murphy’s first starring roles, he plays a rebellious cop from Detroit (Axel Foley) who is determined to find his best friend’s killer. His investigation leads him to Beverly Hills where he continues to dig deeper under the guise of a vacation. If you haven’t seen this movie, what rock have you been living under? But really, go get youreself a couple of Jack and cokes to enjoy with this ’80s classic. \nWatch the trailer HERE 3. Harry And The Hendersons (1987) \nAnother addition coming to Netflix in December is the the tale of the lovable sasquatch Harry and his adoptive family the Hendersons. If you’ve never seen this film, you might need to revert back to your childhood years. Though, watching it now Harry does look a little creepy, tbh. \nWatch the trailer HERE 4. Honey I Shrunk the Kids (1989) \nAnother ’80s cinema staple, Honey I Shrunk The Kids will never cease to give us hours of entertainment (either from the movie itself or the ridiculous production value). Those special effects though… \nWatch the trailer HERE 5. Chill With Rob Ross: Collection (1990) \nI think we could all use a little more Rob Ross in our lives, don’t you? Especially with this crazy world we currently live in, it’s nice to take a moment for simple paint and canvas masterpieces. Also, Rob Ross is even better drunk so grab a bottle of wine, put your feet up, and relax. \nWatch an episode HERE 6. Toys (1992) \nOur forever favorite Robin Williams stars in this ’90s film about a hi-tech toy factory that’s under seige by an army general who turns the models into killing machines. The deceased owner of the factory’s children must find a way to stop him and save the empire. \nWatch the trailer HERE 7. The Little Rascals (1994) \nFINALLY! It’s about damn time Netflix added this spectacular piece of cinema to its library. The whole gang is back including Alfalfa and his hair, of course. “ You are so beautiful to me…” \nWatch the trailer HERE 8. D2: The Mighty Ducks (1994) \nThe Mighty Ducks are back in action! Well, they came back in 1994, but now they’re officially joining Netflix’s library so we can have our very own Mighty Ducks -athon. Yes, that’s a thing. Coach Gordon Bombay (Emilio Estevez) reunites his team of teenage misfits and takes on Iceland. \nWatch the trailer HERE 9 . The Rock (1996) \nBefore Armageddon or the Transformers series, Micheal Bay directed The Rock, a film about a FBI chemical warfare expert who’s sent on a top secret mission with a former British spy. It stars the one and only Sean Connery alongside Nicholas Cage. \nWatch the trailer HERE 10. Picture Perfect (1997) \nThis ’90s Jennifer Aniston flick is perfect for a wine night with the girls. When single woman Kate Mosley (Aniston) realizes that her boss is more likely to promote married employees, she enlists a fake husband-to-be Nick (Jay Mohr). Unsurprisingly, things prove to be much more complicated than she anticipated. \nWatch the trailer HERE 11. Hannibal (2001) \nSeven years after Dr. Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins) escaped from custody, he is once again at large in Europe. One of the doctor’s victims who survived, though horribly disfigured, is determined to get revenge by using Clarice Starling (Julianne Moore) as bait. Needless to say, things get a bit…dicey. Don’t watch this alone, for any reason whatsoever. \nWatch the trailer HERE 12. Marvel’s Captain America Civil War (2016) \nThis recent Marvel release should be at the top of your December movie list, mostly because of Chris Evans and his gloriously sculpted physique and of course, the badass action scenes. Plus, Marvel never really lets us down too much, right? \nWatch the trailer HERE 13. Fuller House Season 2 – Netflix Original \nThe second season in Netflix’s remake of Full House is set to hit streaming services next month and we can’t wait to see what sort of shenanigans the family will get into next. Also, can we just take a moment for Uncle Jesse? \nWatch the trailer HERE 14. Barry – Netflix Original \nLast, but certainly not least on our list is the Netflix original film Barry which is based on the life and journey of our now-former president Obama. Watch the trailer and you will immediately be hooked, we promise. \nWatch the trailer HERE And here’s the full list: \nAvailable 12/1/16 \nAngels in the Snow (2015) \nBeverly Hills Cop (1984)",

      "text": "Photo: Netflix \nThe Gilmore Girls revival is full of revelations (not least of which are those famous four final words ). But one reveal is a bit more subtle and not entirely unexpected. During the show’s original seven-season run, Michel, the resident concierge of first the Independence Inn and then the Dragonfly, is haughty, snotty, and portrayed entirely without a romantic backstory or subplot. In the first installment of Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life , his ambiguous sexuality (which many fans saw as an open-and-shut closet case) is addressed when we find out Michel is now married, and to a man. Yanic Truesdale, who plays the thickly accented Frenchman, wasn’t privy to how that came about, but he wasn’t surprised either. “I didn’t have a conversation with [creator] Amy [Sherman-Palladino] about it, I discovered it when I read the script,” he told Vulture at the Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life premiere in Los Angeles. “Amy and I have discussed this in the past, but years ago: ‘What do you think? Does he have a personal life? Do you think he’s dating someone? Who is he dating? Do you think he’s dating a woman, a guy?’ Because, you know, there’s been a lot of speculation with it. So when I read it on the page I was like, ‘OK!’”\nTruesdale continued: “Because that character was never defined by his personal life, it didn’t really matter to me either way, whatever direction his personal life would be, it didn’t affect the essence of who he is and how people perceive him.” Still, that didn’t stop him from having a positive reaction to the news. “I felt great! Either way I was open,” he said, noting that this new insight into Michel is a welcome evolution. “The more you can share about who your character is, the more you feel like you’re connecting with the audience. Because they get to know you more, right? And so it was a challenge to have the little information about who he was, and still connect with the audience. It is gratifying to reveal more.”",

      "text": "See Netflix's 'Gilmore Girls' coffee shop takeover 01:20 Story highlights Actor Sean Gunn spoke with CNN about coming back to 'Gilmore Girls' \"I'm ready to see what the fans think of it — how much they like it,\" he said (CNN) Thanks to his work as Kraglin in Marvel's \"Guardians of the Galaxy,\" Sean Gunn has had his fair share of exposure to a notoriously passionate group -- comic book fans. But even they, he said, aren't quite as fervent as fans of \" Gilmore Girls .\" \"The 'Gilmore Girls' fans might be crazier, which is insane to even say that,\" Gunn, who played Kirk,   interview leading up to the Netflix revival of the beloved show. \"It's weird to see the parallel between 'Gilmore Girls' and a lot of the Comic-Con-type, sci-fi-fantasy fans. In a weird way, even though 'Gilmore Girls' is not in that genre, the way the fandom conducts itself and has created this community is similar.\" That community is a big part of why the series is seeing a second life. Despite wrapping up its run in 2007, the love for \"Gilmore Girls\" has never really died. If anything, it grew thanks to Netflix, who made all the seasons available for streaming in 2014. Netflix greenlit a revival in January, a few months after much of the cast reunited at the ATX Television Festival in Austin to much fanfare. Read More RELATED: 'Gilmore Girls' follows TV's nostalgia wave to Netflix Gunn was not at the Austin event, but remembers hearing rumblings about a possible return in the weeks and months that followed. He thought it was \"strange and exciting.\" \"It was very, very cool,\" he said. \"I'm ready to see what the fans think of it — how much they like it.\" Four \"Gilmore Girls\" mini-movies debut on Netflix November 25. Lauren Graham, Alexis Bledel and most of the supporting cast will reprise their roles. \"I was a little nervous at first, sure,\" Gunn said of stepping back into quirky Kirk's shoes. \"Then I walked onto set and I'm walking around and here I am in Stars Hollow and everything looked exactly how I remembered it looking ... he came back pretty quickly.\" The hope is also that the warm, joy-filled feelings fans got from watching the original series comes roaring back, too. With creator Amy Sherman-Palladino back at the helm -- she was not part of Season 7 -- chances are they will. But also, Gunn said, the show's message about community is still one that resonates. \"I think the idea that the community you live in is an extension of your family is a really nice thing for people to think about and to wish for in their own lives,\" he said. \"The idea that a place like Stars Hollow exists, that's safe and comforting and the people there actually look out for one another, that's what appeals about the show to me.\"",

      "text": "5 hours ago Netflix \nThe wait is over! “ Gilmore Girls ” fans don’t have to wait one more minute for the Netflix revival, “A Year in the Life,” which premiered on November 25. The series originally ran for more than 150 episodes from 2000 to 2007, while the revival consists of four 90-minute episodes, all ready for immediate binging. As of this writing the miniseries has scored 74 on MetaCritic and 83% freshness on Rotten Tomatoes ,   \nThe four episodes of “ Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life ” represent the four seasons of the year: winter, spring, summer and fall. We’re reintroduced to the close-knit mother-daughter pair of Lorelai ( Lauren Graham ) and Rory ( Alexis Bledel ), along with Lorelai’s mother Emily ( Kelly Bishop ) and myriad familiar faces in their town, Stars Hollow. It delivers a “sweetly satisfying and powerfully emotional rush” for longtime fans of the show —“I laughed, I cried, I immediately wanted another helping.” \nSo let’s hope awards voters will finally take notice. Graham earned one Golden Globe nomination and two SAG bids, and the series won a single Emmy (Best Non-Prosthetic Makeup in 2004) on its only nomination. “Gilmore Girls” originally aired on the WB and CW networks, which were mostly invisible to awards groups. But Netflix has proven to be an awards favorite, so perhaps the acclaimed revival will finally earn the show some hardware. \nCheck out some of the reviews below, and join the discussion in our forums . \nMatt Roush ( TV Guide Magazine ): “Ever known a special someone who comes back into your life after years of absence, and when you reconnect, it’s as if no time has passed at all? That’s the sweetly satisfying and powerfully emotional rush any ‘Gilmore Girls’ fan is bound to experience when gorging on the post-Thanksgiving feast of ‘A Year in the Life,’ a blissful four-part reunion cooked up by the show’s creator, Amy Sherman-Palladino.” \nWilla Paskin ( Slate ): “The show champions not only boundaryless mother-daughter relationships, but fast-talking dames mating with taciturn men, loud hats, well-made bad musicals, and hellaciously civic-minded American towns. I’m not objectively convinced of the virtues of any of these things, but when ‘Gilmore Girls’ is working its magic, it can be pretty persuasive.” Photo Gallery: Top 10 Best ‘Gilmore Girls’ Episodes of All Time \nJanice Page ( Boston Globe ): “Episode four is vintage ‘GG,’ an untamed, highly emotional ride that delivers incisive cultural commentary, rich introspection, and poignant moments that are no less valid just because they’re covered in Cheez Whiz. I laughed, I cried, I immediately wanted another helping.” \nKen Tucker ( Yahoo! ): “Was it worth the wait? I think the proper question is: Will fans be satisfied? Having seen all four episodes, I cannot imagine the answer will be anything but ‘Yes.’ Lauren Graham and Alexis Bledel deliver the show’s trademark fast-paced intricate dialogue with no sign of strain. And every character you hope will show up, shows up.” Make your Golden Globe predictions now; change them till Dec. 12 \nMake your Golden Globes TV Awards picks now and tell industry insiders which shows and performers you have out front to win on January 8.

      "text": "Photo: Netflix \nFor the most part, Stars Hollow exists somewhat out of time. That’s part of the appeal of Gilmore Girls , which takes places in an invented version of small-town America, where the people can keep up with obscure aspects of pop culture, even while they enjoy a slew of seasonal festivals and wacky layered outfits heavy on scarves. Inspired by Washington Depot, Connecticut, and technically shot at the “Midwest Business & Residential Street” set on the Warner Bros. lot in Burbank, California, Stars Hollow is a beautiful bubble. In Netflix’s Gilmore revival, the bubble hasn’t popped. The town’s background actors are noticeably more diverse than they were on the WB or CW, and a few storefronts have come and gone, but for the most part, the sets are as familiar as ever. Still, just as you might notice any difference in your childhood home when you come back for the holidays, even the small changes to Stars Hollow stick out. Here’s a guide to what’s new, what’s old, and what’s ever-so-slightly adjusted.\nMost of the familiar locations look a little different.\nUpon returning to the Warner Bros. lot, creator Amy Sherman-Palladino told Indiewire that her reaction was: “Goddammit, they changed our Stars Hollow,” which had, in the years since Gilmore , become a shooting location for Pretty Little Liars , among several other shows. “They got a deal on brown paint. I’ve never seen so much brown paint in my entire life,” Palladino said. I’m like, ‘Who the fuck doesn’t want some color in your town?’ There wasn’t any red. There wasn’t any yellow ... So we had to go back in and zhoosh up Stars Hollow. We had to rebuild all the sets.”\nTo that end, Luke’s Diner, which had yellow accents in the original series...\n\n\n...seems larger, with a blue color scheme and a few pillars.\n\n\nThe same goes for Doose’s market, which in the revival has a much brighter look and feel This is also the effect of HD cameras, which make everything more surreal.\nThen. Now. \nA few storefronts have changed. \nThe town square still has its signature gazebo, but a few of the stores seem to be new. There’s a new store called Posey’s on the town square, which appears in the background of “Winter.\"\n\n\nThere's also a sporting-goods store called Bacos, which Rory and the Life and Death Brigade raid in “Fall.”\n\n\nStars Hollow Video, meanwhile, seems to have gone the way of Blockbuster and vanished from the map — though it stills appears on the Stars Hollow promotional site . \n\nRIP. \nIn dialogue in “Winter,” we also learn that Le Chat Club had to close due to rats (again). In “Fall,” we find out that Pretty Pastures, an old-age home, is being sold by a group of nuns, possibly to Katy Perry.\nSome locations seem to have been in Stars Hollow all along, though they were never mentioned before. Rory goes inside the Stars Hollow Gazette   in “Summer.” \n\n\nAlso in “Summer,” Lorelai and Rory take a trip to the town pool...\n\n... and later, to the secret bar.\n\n\nAnd there are some upgraded amenities.\nWhile Rory has been away, Taylor Doose has redoubled his efforts to improve Stars Hollow’s quality of life. He installed new parking meters and then took them out because no one would pay, and now, he’s on a campaign to install sewers instead of septic tanks. We also learn that Taylor has also installed an A/C for town meetings.\nLuke’s Diner, meanwhile, seems like it’s taken a leap into the future after Luke installed Wi-Fi, though of course he won’t let anyone use it. Gypsy still works at her garage, while Kirk maintains the Black, White, and Read movie theater, which is still the place to take snacks to see classic films, even though food is technically banned.\nBut the traditions are mostly the same. \nStars Hollow continues its proud tradition of having gigantic themed festivals in the Netflix revival. The spring festival includes a basket auction, in a throwback to season two's “A-Tisket, A-Tasket,” where Jess and Dean competed over Rory’s basket . There’s always space for more celebration, however. In “Spring,” Taylor plans to stage a Stars Hollow gay-pride parade, but realizes there aren’t enough gay people in Stars Hollow. He also plans a Stars Hollow musical, which we see in “Summer,” in order to raise money for, among other causes, “gazebo upkeep.”\nAnd so is the confusion. \nThe cartography of Stars Hollow never made much sense, a fact which A Year in the Life lampshades when Rory and Lorelai traverse the town to deliver papers in “Summer” and realize that neither of them know which direction is east and which is west. The point being, nobody really knows where anything is in Stars Hollow, just as nobody will ever get to see what Al’s Pancake World looks like, only that it never really serves pancakes.",

However, it wasn’t just their personalities and relationships that left fans wanting more — it was also the quirky clothes. Lorelai’s unconventional but memorable style in particular gave the show even more charm. Who can forget the episode where she wore jorts and cowboy boots to meet the headmaster on Rory’s first day of school? Or her absurdly large collection of bandanas? And, of course, her obsession with shoes, which her pup, Paul Anka, shared. To celebrate the return of Gilmore Girls , here are some of Lorelai’s most noteworthy looks.  ",

      "text": "print \nGetty/Gaye Gerard \nJeremy Clarkson has fired back at Netflix's claim that his new show, \"The Grand Tour,\" cost Amazon a whopping $250 million. \n“Amazon spent far less than Netflix would have you believe,” Clarkson told CNN . “It’s no way near as expensive as people have been saying.” \nNetflix content boss Ted Sarandos recently told The Telegraph that \"The Grand Tour,\" starring Clarkson and the \"Top Gear\" team, cost Amazon \"about a quarter of a billion dollars.\" The FT had previously reported that Amazon had paid $250 million for three seasons of the show. \nClarkson disputes that number. While he wouldn't reveal how much the show actually cost, he said he knew the figure and it wasn't close to $250 million. \nThe first episode of the show's 12-episode first season dropped November 18. The big rollout \n\"The Grand Tour\" is a huge moment for Amazon in its bid to rival Netflix as the top producer of high-quality streaming content. \nNetflix even mentioned the show in its most recent earnings report, saying the company assumed it would make Amazon \"as global as YouTube and Netflix.\" Amazon is poised to expand its video service to more than 200 countries, most likely starting in December, according to The Wall Street Journal . \nAmazon is doubling its spend on video content in the second half of this year, compared with last year, the company's CFO, Brian Olsavsky, said previously. Amazon most recently disclosed its investment amount on video content back in 2014, when it spent $1.3 billion. \nBut while Amazon may want \"The Grand Tour\" as its calling card for an international rollout, Sarandos said, for Netflix, the price was just too high. \n\"We made a play for that show, definitely,\" Sarandos told The Telegraph. \"But we've had every season of 'Top Gear' on Netflix in most territories in the world, so we had a better sense than most of what the audience was for 'Top Gear' on our platform. We knew what it was worth.\" \nNetflix, for its part, plans to spend $6 billion on content in 2017. \nAdditional reporting by Eugene Kim.

      "text": "(Netflix)\nSummer has begun and Rory Gilmore is back at home with her mom. Oh, wait … She insists that she is NOT back and that she is just staying in town temporarily. \nNext, we see dinner at the Gilmore girls’ house in Stars Hollow, with a visitor – a grown up April, Luke’s daughter. She is an MIT girl, 22 years old, and has a nose ring. Soon, she’s going to head into graduate school, but is going on a road trip with friends, exploring the legalization of marijuana. It seems pretty clear that she’s a pot-smoker, though Luke believes her when she says she isn’t. She confesses in private to Rory that she does actually smoke weed. She then goes back on what she said and reveals she only smoked pot once. April begins to have a melt down, showing her true self, that she wants to get rid of her nose ring and that she’s not as “cool” as she was putting on. Rory talks April off the ledge. \n(Netflix)\nLater in the night, Rory calls back Logan, who had left her voicemails. She wants to visit him sooner and finds out that his fiancee moved in with him. Rory settles on visiting Logan in three weeks, though she’s clearly disappointed. \nRory heads to a town meeting and is bombarded with “welcome backs.” Taylor is going to make a “big announcement” at the meeting when the air system goes haywire. Taylor ends up revealing that they are creating “Stars Hollow: The Musical” and Lorelai volunteers to be in the advisory committee. Taylor also reveals that the Stars Hollow Gazette is closing down since the editor has retired and there’s no one to take his place. Rory becomes upset about the news. \nMiss Patty and Babette are working on casting for the musical. While walking past the auditions for the musical, Lorelai sees her overly-enthusiastic psychiatrist in line to audition. Rory continues to dwell on the Stars Hollow Gazette closing and confronts Taylor, telling him not to close it down. Rory, now has the job of heading up the Gazette as the new editor. \nBack at the Dragonfly Inn, we are in the Twilight Zone as Michel is being extra nice to customers. Michel asks Lorelai if she knows that he recently celebrated his birthday. He asks that she take him out for a drink “to talk.” They hit up a local place called The Secret Bar, where Lane and Zach are quietly playing music in the back. Michel tells Lorelai that he is leaving the Dragonfly Inn and recently met with the W Hotel. Michel says he needs more money and more expansion, saying he has a baby on the way. \nAll of a sudden, the entire place goes dark and everyone hides as Taylor walks by. Once Taylor leaves, the bar action resumes. \nWhile trying to figure out the ways of the Stars Hollow Gazette, Rory finds that the computer equipment is insanely out-of-date. Lorelai stops by to talk with Rory, who busts some alcohol out of her desk for the two of them. Lorelai cries that Michel is leaving the Inn and that he’s given her three months to find someone new. \nOnce Rory gets all the issues of the paper printed, she tries to figure out how to deliver them all. At the Inn, Luke is stepping in to help in the kitchen and is taking his frustrations out on Michel, as well as Lorelai. Rory interrupts them, enlisting Lorelai to help her deliver her first edition of the Stars Hollow Gazette. Rory receives criticism after she decides to not post a poem on the cover, which is a tradition of the Gazette. Rory also gets an angry phone call from Doyle, whose movie review she criticized in the Gazette. Doyle also complains about the missing poem to boot. \n(Netflix)\nRory calls Grandma Emily and she gets woken up by the phone call, which is at noon. She seems very disoriented and her behavior is of concern to Rory. \nLorelai and the other advisers for the Stars Hollow musical sit back and watch the first presentation of the musical. The presentation is made for feedback and critiques. Lorelai exclaims, “What the …?” when she sees it’s a story of domestic abuse and alcoholism. The actors then change into Pilgrims’ outfits out of nowhere, singing about building Stars Hollow. The musical continues to time hop. Then, in the middle of the show, another actor comes out and tries to rap, mimicking the essence of the Broadway musical “Hamilton.” Lorelai is hating the show, while the others in the crowd seem to enjoy it. \nCarole King is actually playing one of the advisers on the advisory committee and her character reveals that she has some original songs she could contribute to the show. She then starts to perform “I Feel the Earth Move,” a famous Carole King song. Taylor is not a fan and declines the offer. \nEmily is meeting with her fellow members of the D.A.R. (Daughters of the Revolution). Rory drops by and the meeting is adjourned. One big change that Rory notices is that there is a TV in the living room, where they always have their pre and post-dinner drinks. Rory worries that Emily hasn’t been getting out of the house or socializing. Rory encourages Emily to update her membership at The Club, where she and Richard would frequent. After the visit, Emily sends Lorelai to go see Grandpa Richard’s latest grave stone. \nRory decides to put back the usual poem on the cover of the Gazette. While at the paper’s office, ex-boyfriend Jess walks in and asks about how Rory landed the job at the not-so-prestigious Gazette. Rory pours the two of them a drink and Jess reveals he still works in books. Rory then remembers she still needs to break up with her boyfriend. She reveals to Jess that she’s broke, her license has expired, she has no home and she feels like a failure. Jess offers to give her money, which she says she doesn’t need. He tells her that she is just in a rut and that rut’s are normal for writers. \n(Netflix)\nJess tells Rory she should write a book and she should write what she’s passionate about. He then tells her to write a book about her relationship with her mother Lorelai. \nOne week later, Lorelai goes to her mother’s house, finding Richard’s friend Jack Smith sitting down with Emily. Jack is going to drive them to the cemetery to see the grave stone and Lorelai freaks out, calling Rory on the phone. Rory is caught off-guard as well and Lorelai ends up confronting her mother about Jack. Rory agrees to meet them at the cemetery because she lost track of time at the Gazette. \nEmily ends up revealing to Lorelai that she took Luke traveling around to scout franchise locations for the diner. \nRory, Lorelai and Emily bring flowers to Richard’s grave site while Jack waits at the car. Again Emily has an issue with the head stone, which is the fifth one so far. While at the cemetery, Rory tells Lorelai she’s been looking for a place to live in Queens, New York. She also tells her mother that she’s writing a book, a non-fiction book about their relationship. Lorelai gets upset and says she doesn’t want Rory to write about her life. And, when Lorelai hears that Jess suggested it, she becomes extra defensive. Rory feels that Lorelai is overreacting and she feels it’s a sign that this is what she is supposed to do in life. Rory pleads with her mother for her blessing on the project, but Lorelai refuses. \nA frantic Lorelai heads over to Luke’s diner, where she confronts him about his grumpy behavior. It then comes out that they each lied to each other about the franchise locations and about not going to therapy with her mother anymore. Luke doesn’t quite believe Lorelai is going to therapy just by herself. This blows up into a discussion about why their lives have been so separated from each other. \nRory vents to Lane about her mother’s meltdown over the book. Amid their discussion, she accidentally calls Logan … three times. When Logan finally speaks with her on the phone, Rory sadly breaks off their “arrangement.” \n(Netflix)\nAfter some reflection at the Stars Hollow Musical, Lorelai tells Luke that she’s going to “do the movie Wild .” She says she’s going away for a few weeks or even longer. Luke asks her why she’s going and she says, “because it’s never or now.” \nAnd the episode ends.\n‘Gilmore Girls’ Netflix 2016 Cast The 2016 Netflix revival of the Gilmore Girls premieres with new and old cast members. \nClick here to read more ‘Gilmore Girls’ Netflix Revival: Episode 1 Recap & Spoilers – ‘Winter’ The premiere episode of \"Gilmore Girls\", the Netflix revival has premiered.

      "text": "Michel’s Sexuality Is Finally Confirmed In Netflix’s “Gilmore Girls” Revival Happy \"Gilmore Girls\" Day! by Christopher Rudolph 5m ago \nFor seven seasons Yanic Truesdale played the uptight, easily annoyed Frenchman Michel Gerard who worked alongside Lorelai Gilmore (Lauren Graham) on Gilmore Girls . \nHis sexuality was never discussed—in fact Michel was never given much of a backstory at all—but in the first episode of Netflix’s Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life it is revealed that Michel is now married to a man. Maury Phillips/Getty Images for GBK Productions \n“I didn’t have a conversation with [creator] Amy [Sherman-Palladino] about it, I discovered it when I read the script,” Truesdale told Vulture . “Amy and I have discussed this in the past, but years ago: ‘What do you think? Does he have a personal life? Do you think he’s dating someone? Because, you know, there’s been a lot of speculation with it. So when I read it on the page I was like, ‘OK!’” \nHow did Truesdale feel about the news of Michel’s sexuality? \n“I felt great! Either way I was open,” he added. “The more you can share about who your character is, the more you feel like you’re connecting with the audience. Because they get to know you more, right? And so it was a challenge to have the little information about who he was, and still connect with the audience. It is gratifying to reveal more.” \nWe’re just glad Michel is back to dish out more of his classic catty insults.",

      "text": "  Ariana Romero 0 Shares \nWarning: Huge, huge spoilers ahead for Netflix ’s Gilmore Girls revival \nGilmore Girls: A Year in the Life brought us many post- Thanksgiving treats: another stroll through Stars Hollow, more rapid-fire Rory and Lorelai Gilmore banter, and the greatest gift of all, the reveal of the show’s ever-secret final four words . \nThe mythology behind the FFWs exist because creator Amy Sherman-Palladino and her executive producer husband Daniel Palladino exited Gilmore ahead of the series’ polarizing final seventh season. \nNEWS: Everything You Need to Know About the Gilmore Girls Revival Reviews \nSo, what has AS-P been hiding under her signature hats for all of these years? \nThe final four words come from Rory and Lorelai, because there was zero chance that honor would go to any other set of characters. \nNEWS: There Was a Secret Gilmore Girls Relationship No One Knew About \nThe mother-daughter pair’s last Gilmore conversation comes after Lorelai marries her One True Love, Luke Danes, in a midnight ceremony ahead of the couple’s actual wedding. \n“I want to remember it all. Every detail,” Rory says, leading us to believe she hopes to hold on to each moment of her mom’s big day. \nAnd then she drops the bombshell. A video posted by Gilmore girls (@gilmoregirls) on Nov 18, 2016 at 8:03am PST \n“Mom,” the youngest Gilmore girl says. \n“Yeah?” Lorelai responds. \nQUIZ: Which Gilmore Girls Guy Would You End Up With? \nLorelai is just as shocked as the rest of us. \nAlthough we’re still processing the final four words, one Gilmore Girls star is definitively less than impressed. A video posted by Gilmore girls (@gilmoregirls) on Nov 18, 2016 at 9:35pm PST \nEmily Gilmore’s portrayer Kelly Bishop admits the AYITL script didn’t evenreveal the final four words, instead ending with the sentence, “And then the last four words are said.” \nWhen the 72-year-old was eventually clued in to the top-secret news, her response was, “Oh,” she tells The Daily Beast . \nHer opinion hasn’t improved since then. \n“If it’s true, this is a really lousy thing to say, if it’s really true that those are the last four words then my reaction is, ‘Eh,’” she confesses. \nQUIZ: Which Gilmore Girls Duo Are You and Your BFF? \nAt least the FFWs have a fan! \n“I was surprised as well, a bit taken aback really,” Lorelai's portrayer Lauren Graham tells UK newspaper Metro . \n“And then I thought, ‘Of course Amy would do that!’”",

      "title": "‘The Brady Bunch’ matriarch Florence Henderson dies at 82",
      "text": "Netflix coming to Comcast’s cable. Here’s how it will work \nMaureen McCormick, who played the eldest Brady daughter, Marcia, tweeted, “You are in my heart forever Florence.” ”Dancing With the Stars” host Tom Bergeron tweeted, “Heartbroken. I’ll miss you, my friend.” Henderson’s last public appearance was Monday at the “Dancing With The Stars” taping where she was in the audience to support McCormick, who competed this season. \nThe blond, ever-smiling Henderson was already a Broadway star when the show began, having originated the title role in the musical “Fanny.” But after “The Brady Bunch,” she would always be known to fans as Carol Brady. \n“We had to have security guards with us. Fans were hanging on our doors. We couldn’t go out by ourselves. We were like the Beatles!” she said of the attention the show brought the cast. \nLike the Beatles, there was even a Saturday morning cartoon version called “Brady Kids,” though Henderson was not in that show. \nShe and Reed did return, however, for “The Brady Bunch Hour, “The Brady Brides” and “The Bradys.” So did most of the original cast. \nShe was also back again in 1995 when a new cast was assembled for “The Brady Bunch Movie,” a playful spoof of the original show. \nThis time she was Grandma Brady opposite Shelley Long’s Carol. Numerous memoirs also kept interest in the show alive as cast members revealed they were more than just siblings off camera. Barry Williams, who played eldest son Greg Brady, would confess to having a crush on his TV stepmom. Henderson, in her own book, denied having any relationship with Williams but did acknowledge a fling with former New York City mayor John Lindsay. \nHenderson was a 19-year-old drama student in New York when she landed a one-line role in the play “Wish You Were Here.” \nRichard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II were so impressed they made her the female lead in a 1952 road tour of “Oklahoma!” When the show returned to Broadway for a revival in 1954, she continued in the role and won rave reviews. \n“She is the real thing,” wrote Walter Kerr of the New York Herald Tribune. \nTo broaden her career, Henderson took acting, dancing, singing and guitar lessons, even studying French and Italian. \nShe went on to play Maria in a road production of “The Sound of Music,” was Nellie Forbush in a revival of “South Pacific” and was back on Broadway with Jose Ferrer in “The Girl Who Came to Supper” in 1963. \nShe made her movie debut in 1970 in “Song of Norway,” based on the 1944 operetta with music by Norwegian composer Edvard Grieg. \nHer career nearly came to an end in 1965 when she suddenly lost her hearing while appearing in “The King and I” in Los Angeles. \nShe was diagnosed with a condition linked to heredity. \n“Corrective surgery in both ears restored my hearing,” she said in 2007. \nAs her TV career blossomed with “The Brady Bunch,” Henderson also began to make frequent TV guest appearances. She was the first woman to host “The Tonight Show” for the vacationing Johnny Carson. \nFor eight years she also commuted to Nashville to conduct a cooking and talk series, “Country Kitchen,” on The Nashville Network. The show resulted in a book, “Florence Henderson’s Short Cut Cooking.” \nAfter “The Brady Bunch” ended its first run, Henderson alternated her appearances in revivals of the show with guest appearances on other programs, including “Hart to Hart,” ”Fantasy Island” and “The Love Boat.” \nIn later years she also made guest appearances on such shows as “Roseanne, “Ally McBeal” and “The King of Queens.” \nShe also became a commercial spokeswoman and co-produced “Country Kitchen,” a Nashville Network series, The Los Angeles Times reported. \nFlorence Agnes Henderson was born Feb. 14, 1934, in the small town of Dale in southern Indiana. She was the 10th child of a tobacco sharecropper of Irish descent. \nIn grade school, she joined the choir at a Catholic church in Rockport, Indiana. \nAfter high school she moved to New York, where she enrolled in a two-year program at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts, her studies financed by a theatrical couple who had been impressed by her singing when they saw her perform in high school. \nShe dropped out of the program after one year, however, to take the role in “Wish You Were There.” \nHenderson married theater executive Ira Bernstein and the couple had four children before the union ended in divorce after 29 years. \nHer second husband, John Kappas, died in 2002. \nPressman said she is survived by her children, Barbara, Joseph, Robert and Lizzie, their spouses and five grandchildren.

      "text": "All episodes of the Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life revival series have been released on Netflix and many fans have already binge-watched them all!\nNow, stars Lauren Graham and Alexis Bledel are sharing their thoughts on the final scene of the series and the “last four words” that everyone wanted to know. Just a heads up, this post contains no spoilers.\nLauren told THR that she didn’t even know the whole “last four words” lore was actually a thing.\n“I didn’t know until halfway through filming this that those existed and then Amy told them to me on the set. I was surprised for a minute and then it made complete sense,” she said.\nClick inside to read what the ladies said about the final four words… \nAlexis said she felt “a lot of pressure to get it right, to make it awesome. More than anything, I was just trying to be really focused and really present just to make sure that whatever I did in the scene felt rooted in my experience of the character and I was communicating something that felt real to me.”\nLauren tried to avoid reading the final script for the series as she didn’t want the experience to end, even though the final words weren’t even in the script.\n“I had a very general sense of where Lorelai was that made complete sense to me and then, what I didn’t know exactly is how it would end,” Lauren told THR . “For the longest time, I couldn’t read ‘Fall,’ which is our last episode. I was like, ‘This is psychotic, I have to read where this ends up,’ but I think I was both worried it wouldn’t be satisfying and also just kind of wanted to save it. Eventually, I read it and it was very satisfying.”\nSeries creator Amy Sherman-Palladino is satisfied with how she ended the series.\n“It was satisfying in the context of when we put it altogether,” she said. “It’s an emotional moment.”",

      "text": "Live What The Reviews Have To Say About Netflix's 'Gilmore Girls' Reboot Netflix LIKE A WARM CUP OF LUKE'S COFFEE What The Reviews Have To Say About Netflix's 'Gilmore Girls' Reboot Nov 25 2016, 1:10 PM digg Blacklist story Blacklist domain ​It's Black Friday, and Gilmore Girls is back. Nearly 10 years after the series wrapped up its 8th and (then) final season, Lorelai, Rory and most of the crew are back in Stars Hollow for a one-season Netflix event . If you're looking for post-Thanksgiving binge, it's a strong candidate — but is it any good? Here's what the reviews say. It's More Of The Same — Without Being Stale Breathe a sigh of relief: The “Gilmore Girls” we knew and loved is back, and at its best, it’s the equivalent of a platter of powdered donuts and extra-crispy french fries. [ Variety ] Amy Sherman-Palladino and Daniel Palladino manage to create a story that feels both fittingly current and just like the good ol’ days. Part of the former may come from an onslaught of pop culture references that feel completist in covering the years between seasons, but that’s an established element of the series, making each quick jab at Marvel movies and nod to David Cronenberg a nostalgic rush as much as a means to ground these new stories in the present. [ IndieWire ] [P]erfectly timed TV comfort food — a faithful reproduction of the quirky, cozy vibe we fell in love with. But it’s also not afraid to push its characters towards new, sometimes painful realizations. Because nothing ever stays quite the same… even in Stars Hollow. The Banter Is Back, Baby Listening to the rhythm, lilt, and inspired language of their dialogue is music to the ears. [ Entertainment Weekly ] The rapid-fire patter gets more room to breathe, all the better for cheeky asides or pointed repetitions. That’s good news for those who come for the witty repartee, and bad news for the Luke Daneses in the audience who dread set-pieces featuring elaborate festivals or Stars Hollow town meetings. [ AV Club ] Amy Sherman-Palladino’s banter is profligate. The creator of Gilmore Girls writes dialogue that winds and meanders from tangent to pop culture joke to pun, the speech flying fast, the meaning coming slow, simultaneously a sprint and a dawdle. Unlike most scripted language, it is not economical. It does not further plot or what we already know about a character. Instead, it creates a rhythm... G ilmore Girls returns to Netflix this Thanksgiving weekend after a nine-year hiatus. Everyone still talks a lot. [ Slate ] But The 90-Minute Episode Format Has Its Issues (And What's Up With The Musical?) Endless wisecracks, some dated but some not, just wither on the vine in scene after endless scene. An hourlong drama with commercials is tight because it has to be; six hours’ worth of Gilmore Girls in 90-minute installments has to be nothing but itself, and that’s a dangerous blank check to write a show that even at its best could be indulgent. By the time a musical about the town’s history—in which neither Gilmore girl is involved—is unfolding, my bemusement had given way to frustration. [ TIME ] Scenes tend to go on for a skosh too long. (Or, in the case of “Stars Hollow: The Musical,” way too long.) Musical montages that I don’t recall being used this frequently—if ever?—in the original, feel masturbatory and sometimes emotionally manipulative, which is the bigger bummer considering that, emotionally, Gilmore Girls almost never hit a false note. [ The Daily Beast ] And It Needs More Sookie Because Melissa McCarthy is otherwise engaged being one of the biggest movie stars in the world, for instance, we get a lot of clumsy rationalizations for why Sookie is never around whenever something’s happening at the Dragonfly Inn, despite being Lorelai’s best friend and business partner. The one scene in which she was able to appear is excellent — one of the highlights of the entire enterprise — but it also makes her absence from a later scene more distracting than if she hadn’t popped up at all.",

      "text": "‘ Gilmore Girls’ Returns On Netflix, Just In Time For A Holiday Binge   Photo by Saeed Adyani Netflix Lauren Graham and Alexis Bledel return for four movies continuing the Gilmore Girls story. Audio Aired 11/25/16 \nMost television shows arrive accompanied by the question, \"Is it good?\" Revivals of old shows, however, often arrive with the question, \"Is it necessary?\" \nThe four new 90-minute installments of Gilmore Girls that arrived Friday on Netflix under the title Gilmore Girls: A Year In The Life fare better by that adjusted standard than most. Gilmore Girls , which ran from 2000 to 2007, was a good show, and because creator Amy Sherman-Palladino left before the seventh and final season following a contractual dispute, she didn't get to end it the way she wanted to. Moreover, the reason to watch Gilmore Girls was always to spend time in its constructed universe, observing the relationships it built, and listening to its stylish dialogue and its \"la-la-la\" music. Most of the frustrations were around plot developments, in fact; most of the pleasures came from being in the characters' company. To be in their company again feels very much like television's closest approximation of the same holiday catch-up that happens in real life — that's one of the reasons the Thanksgiving weekend release is such clever timing. \nWe don't find Lorelai Gilmore (Lauren Graham) and her daughter Rory (Alexis Bledel) where we left them in 2007. The original series followed Lorelai from the 32-year-old mom of a 16-year-old to the almost-40 mom of a college graduate, and now Lorelai is pushing 50 and Rory is a grown, published writer. Time has been allowed to pass in their lives, and in the lives of everyone they knew. \nThe biggest change in Gilmore world is that Lorelai's father, Richard, has passed away like Edward Herrmann, who played him. This leaves Lorelai's mother, Emily — beautifully performed without so much as a dropped beat by the divine Kelly Bishop — to find a path forward without her husband of 50 years. As much as Herrmann is missed, and he is missed, the mother-daughter relationships between Emily and Lorelai and Lorelai and Rory have always been the best reason to watch Gilmore Girls . Sherman-Palladino, like any good writer, uses the grief that can't be avoided to tell new stories and to push particularly Lorelai's relationship with her mother to new places. And that, again, plays to the show's longtime strengths: other shows had snappy dialogue and other shows embraced quirky small towns, but very few writers cared about moms and daughters with the depth and focus that Sherman-Palladino did. \nIt's sort of funny, then, that so much of the chatter around the revival has been around revisiting the long-arc love story of Lorelai and Luke, and — inevitably — squabbling over the prospects of Rory's assorted disappointing boyfriends. For many women, the expectation that if you're single at the end of college, you are destined to either remain so or return to a man you already know would be alarming. But for Rory, there's a lot of fan talk about preferences as between Dean (the nice-guy first boyfriend turned disastrous affair), Jess (the rebellious second boyfriend), and Logan (the rich Yalie boyfriend). All return for the revival, but not in equal measure. As in life, some ghosts hang around, and some do not. I wouldn't dream of giving away the game here, but I will say that my own sympathies regarding The Legion Of Disappointing Boyfriends are not the same as they were when all these young men were younger men. And that's true to life, as well. \nSherman-Palladino has always been an idiosyncratic creator; that's what makes her work special. The bargain, though, is that every idiosyncratic creator will baffle you at some point with an offbeat idea that seems not to belong. There are a couple of those sequences here, particularly in the middle two segments, \"Spring\" and \"Summer,\" both of which have their writing and direction credited to Sherman-Palladino's husband, Daniel Palladino (the two collaborated on the original show as well). Some of these are easier to forgive given that they seem to arise from efforts to use guest stars well — particularly Sutton Foster, who starred in Sherman-Palladino's short-lived but dearly missed series Bunheads and who shows up in Stars Hollow under circumstances that it would be impolite to spoil and that, frankly, don't matter very much. There are actually a number of Bunheads -related sightings, which is entirely consistent with the truism that whatever else is said about Sherman-Palladino's work, it's never less than fully transparent how dearly she loves it and how personally she takes it. In fact, that's one of the reasons it's good to see her wrap up this story as she intended, even independent of whether it entirely pleases you or not. \nA friend of mine coined the term \"anticippointment\" to describe the way eagerness to return to a show like this often gives way to a realization that it couldn't quite give you everything you hoped for. This revival is not immune. Four 90-minute episodes amount to about the same running time as maybe eight and a half vintage Gilmore Girls episodes, or a little more than a third of a season. And in that third of a season, they have seven seasons of history to acknowledge, ignore, recall, or expand upon. They've also got to establish what's happened in the last nine years, complete three major storylines (Lorelai's, Rory's and Emily's), and perform a lot of what's derisively known as \"fan service\" — giving the people what they want. The people want to see Mrs. Kim again, and Babette, and Kirk, and if those names aren't meaningful to you, this revival probably isn't intended for you, particularly. \nThe good news is that if you're not a Gilmore Girls person and your relatives are eager to watch it over the holidays, there's plenty of that staccato dialogue and family playfulness to entertain and divert you. It just won't resonate the way it might if you've been watching since Rory wore her private-school uniform and formed her first friendships. \nCopyright 2016 NPR.

      "text": "Expert Charts, Trading Tips and Technical Analysis from INO.com Realized 14% Gain After Netflix's Recent Beat - Without Owning Shares November 25, 2016 By Noah Kiedrowski Leave a Comment Introduction \nNetflix Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) recently reported stellar quarterly numbers alongside robust subscriber growth that propelled the shares from ~$100 to $120 by the next day and ultimately to $130 within a few days (Figure 1). Netflix announced that it brought in 370 thousand net subscribers in the U.S. during Q3 while posting only 160 thousand net subscribers during the previous quarter. Furthermore, its international strength was very robust, adding 3.2 million against a 2.0 million consensus. Netflix’s guidance was higher than most estimates as well coming in 520 thousand and 3.75 million subscribers domestically and internationally, respectively. I’ve written a series of articles highlighting ways to leverage options trading to augment a long position or potentially entering into a position in Netflix. I’ve highlighted ways in which one can layer in covered calls to mitigate risk in a long position as well as utilizing secured puts to enter into a position at a lower price or avoid owning the stock altogether while making money. I’ll discuss my covered call/secured put combination strategy to unlock additional value, mitigate risk and generate income. I’ll break this strategy out into segments to exemplify the power of options when dealing with an intrinsically volatile stock with significant upside potential such as Netflix. In brief, I’ve realized a 13.2% gain relative to a -3.1% loss based on the traditional buy and hold strategy based on the closing price on 11Nov16 of ~$115. \nFigure 1 – Netflix’s upward movement after announcing numbers that beat analysts’ expectations Overview \nNetflix is a highly volatile stock with a 52-week range of $80-$133 per share or a $53 per share range. Layered within that range are swings of $10 per share or more (~10%) throughout the course of any given day. These swings to the upside or downside can be difficult to stomach especially after the most recent earnings announcement where the stock cratered by $15 per share in one day (~$100 to $85). There’s no disputing the fact that Netflix has an outrageous valuation and a wide range of intrinsic volatility. Case in point, a $20 move per share was witnessed the day after Netflix beat expectations when they announced Q3 numbers. This intrinsic volatility is more pronounced during any major news story (i.e. expansion into international markets or subscriber price increases) and specifically around earnings announcements. As a result of the nosebleed valuation and volatility, in my opinion, options are a great companion when committing capital to Netflix stock. Netflix is a high growth and industry disruptor stock thus investors are willing to pay a premium for this growth and technology innovation in the traditionally stagnant media space. However, the trade-off is that traditional metrics such as the price-to-earnings multiple (P/E ratio) and the PEG ratio do not apply. Due to its rapid growth, expanding critically acclaimed original programming such as the new hit Stranger Things followed by Narcos, Orange is the New Black and House of Cards. Netflix has been wrestling market share away from big cable companies, expansion into international markets, partnerships and its overall ubiquity; it's easy to see why investors are willing to pay a premium for this media disruptor. Due to these aforementioned factors, an options strategy may be an effective way to leverage and hedge this high growth stock while mitigating risk. Netflix offers high-yielding options premiums whether one owns the stock or attempting to gain a good entry point. This bodes well for those who are willing to leverage options trading to augment returns and mitigate risk throughout the volatile nature of Netflix’s stock. This could come in the form of covered calls and/or secured puts or a combination of a call/put strategy. \nNote: This article discusses a covered call/secured put strategy to mitigate downside risk and generate income around trading Netflix stock. I provide my real life examples embedded around trading Netflix and its intrinsic volatility. I utilize options to extract additional value out of positions in addition to mitigating risk. I earmark a portion of my portfolio solely for options trading in more volatile stocks. The empirical example demonstrated here is part of my overall options strategy. There are numerous positions that I’ve written covered calls and puts on in which my overall position realized a net loss, despite the options income. I do not want to misconstrue readers into the belief that options are trivial in any sense. The Covered Call/Secured Put Combination \nI prefer to break out the options strategy into segments to compartmentalize each segment in order to better understand the overall strategy in digestible pieces. An example of an options segment, in this case, would be if one owns the underlying security and writes covered calls against her position until the stock is relinquished. Hence the stock was purchased and sold (in between the purchase and sale, options were written against the position). The position was opened and closed with a realized gain or loss. Alternatively, when one doesn’t own the stock with respect to secured puts, the secured put option is sold and either the option is bought back and canceled or the stock is assigned. In the case of assignment, until the stock is relinquished with covered calls the segment will not be complete. Thus a leg constitutes money going into the investment and money coming out of the investment for realized gains/losses. Netflix’s Volatility and Covered Calls – Segment #1 \nTo contend with Netflix’s volatility, one can leverage her stock via writing covered call options to mitigate these swings while remaining long in this volatile stock. I initiated a position in Netflix at a price of $118.17 and sold a series of covered calls against the underlying position on the downward trend from ~$118 to the high $90s as detailed in figure 2. \nFigure 2 – Details of my covered call results of the call/put combination strategy \nTaken together, leveraging covered calls against my original Netflix position generated a realized income per share of $21.84 in cash. This equates to a realized 18.5% yield ($21.84/$118.17). This strategy has rendered my effective share price to $96.33 at the time of relinquishment ($118.17-$21.84). I reduced my average share price from $118.17 to $96.33 by executing options on my Netflix position. The underlying security was purchased at $118.17 and sold at $93.00 however I realized $21.84 in options income thus my loss was confined to $3.33 a share as opposed to $25.70 per share loss at the time. I mitigated my losses by 87% in this scenario albeit my overall position had resulted in a loss. Layering In Secured Puts – Segment #2 \nI’ve since layered in the secured put side of options as part of my combination options strategy. This simply stated presents a situation where I sell a put option and receive a premium in exchange for the obligation to buy the shares at a specified price by a specified date. A recent contact that I sold was a secured put at a strike price of $105 in exchange for $10.16 per share while at the time the shares were ~$100. As expiration approached, I decided to buy back the contract at a gain so I would not be assigned the shares and I could use this freed-up capital to make additional moves. I was paid $10.16 per share, and I paid $8.89 per share to cancel the contract for a net gain of $1.27 per share without ever owning the shares. Since money was allocated to the option contract and the shares were not assigned as a result of my cancellation of the contract, this constituted the closing of an options segment at a profit. Recent Secured Put – Segment #3 \nI sold a secured put with a strike of $110 on 19-Aug-16 when the underlying security was trading at $96 per share. This contract provided two months’ worth or trading activity at a price of $15.56 per share. Any price above $94.44 is profitable ($110 less $15.56 premium) thus my strategy is to buy back the contract when the stock hit an uptrend approaching the $110 level to capture the majority of the option premium. Netflix reported earnings on 17-Oct-16 just prior to the expiration of the option contract (21-Oct-16). My plan was to hold the contract through earnings and exercise a buy-to-close cancellation of the contract. Since earnings expectations were low as a result of the previous two disappointing quarterly results and lowered numbers by analysts, I felt that Netflix could easily beat the low expectations thus a secured put contract was sold. The Results \nI originally purchased the shares at $118.70 and wrote covered call contracts until relinquishment that generated a net income of $21.84 per share rendering my average share price to $96.33. I relinquished my shares at $92.92 per share thus $9,292 from the underlying equity plus $2,184 from options premiums equates to $11,484 total. Taken together, money going into Netflix was $11,817 and money coming out Netflix was $11,484 or a $394 loss (-2.8%). Adding in the profit that was made from segment #2, the loss is then decreased to $267 or -2.2% compared to a loss of -16.2% at the time (trading at $99.50) had I kept the shares and sold them at the same price. With segment #3 factored into the covered call/secured put combination strategy, adding in the $15.46 per share profit I arrive at a net profit of $12.79 per share or 13.2% ($15.46 less $3.94 and $15.46/$96.76) (Table 1 and Figure 3). \nTable 1 – Comprehensive results of my call/put combination strategy in mitigating downside risk \nFigure 3 – Details from each options segment and the resulting differences between the traditional buy and hold versus the call/put combination resulting in an overall return of 10.8% versus -3.1% return, respectively. Summary \nWhether you’re investing or trading in Netflix Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) , an options strategy can be highly beneficial in augmenting this position and mitigating risk. As a result of its valuation and volatility, in my opinion, options are the ideal defense when deploying capital to Netflix stock. Thus far I’ve demonstrated my overall covered call/secured put combination strategy with a realized gain of 13.2% without owning any shares. This compares to a loss of (3.1%) with the traditional buy and hold strategy as a result of my call/put combination or alternatively a 5-fold greater return or difference of 16%. Due to Netflix’s intrinsic volatility, an options strategy may be an effective way to leverage and hedge this high growth stock while mitigating risk. This could come in the form of covered calls and/or secured puts or a combination call/put strategy as I outlined above. Netflix’s recent string of earnings disappointments followed by a strong earnings announcement highlights the value of an options strategy to mitigate losses and smooth out drastic moves in the stock price. \nNoah Kiedrowski INO.com Contributor - Biotech \nDisclosure: The author has no business relationship with any companies mentioned in this article.

      "text": "Netflix users may see their monthly subscription fee go up\nThe government wants to make sure you aren’t enjoying your streaming services too much. \nLawmakers are looking for ways to pull in money and now even digital services won’t be spared. In the entertainment realm, a streaming services tax is actually an appealing alternative to taxing local businesses like movie theaters. As people ditch old telecom technology like landlines, cities have lost an important source of revenue. \nIn Pasadena, California the tax on subscription streaming services like Netflix has been raised to 9.4 percent. There are over 40 cities in California that must cough up money for using Netflix, Hulu and the like, according to CBS News. Here are some places where subscribers to streaming services like Netflix must pay the fee.\nPasadena 9.4 Percent Pasadena raised the tax on services like Netflix to 9.4 percent, which would bump a 9 dollar monthly subscription cost to nearly 10 dollars. Even some city officials said they were surprised by the tax, which came from a law Pasadena voters approved in 2008 that taxed cellphones like landlines. Pasadena City Council member Tyron Hampton told CBS News that the tax was meant to compensate for lost revenue due to falling cable TV subscriptions. However, some don’t think the tax is lawful. The Internet Association Director Robert Callahan said Internet services shouldn’t be counted among utilities that are taxed. \nWhile some cities may propose their own taxes on streaming services, others can simply adjust existing legislation to enact the tax. Here are some cities in California that could implement the tax without asking voters for approval again, according to SiliconValley.com . \nAlameda\nAlbany\nEmeryville\nGilroy\nHayward\nHercules\nMenlo Park\nLos Altos\nNewark\nSan Leandro \nChicago 9 Percent Chicago is the first major city to charge a “cloud tax” for digital entertainment services, according to Slate. In what could be its own revolutionary drama, six Cook County residents are taking the city to court. They challenged the city after it expanded its 9 percent “amusement tax” on 2015 June 9 to include streaming services. The Liberty Justice Center, a small Chicago-based law firm, is representing the plaintiffs, who claim the tax harms them and was not approved by Chicago’s City Council. In addition to the so-called “Netflix Tax” the city has raised money through a cloud tax, which applies to B2B services that provide cloud hosting like Amazon Web Services. \nPennsylvania 6 Percent Pennsylvania debuted its 6 percent sales tax on digital downloads and streaming subscription services in August. The so-called Netflix tax was included in a revenue package meant to bridge the state’s $1.3 billion budget gap. The taxation of digital products, which includes apps and downloads, is projected to bring in $47 billion to the state, according to Pittsburgh’s local station Action 4 News. \nEdward Cox is a Heavy contributor.

      "title": "Jeremy Clarkson Denies Netflix’s Claim That Amazon Spent $250 Million on ‘The Grand Tour’",
      "text": " 01AM PT \nThe war of words between Netflix and Amazon shifted into a new gear this week. \nJeremy Clarkson , one of the hosts of Amazon’s “ The Grand Tour ” globe-trotting auto show, disputed the claim by one of Netflix’s senior execs that the e-retailer paid a whopping $250 million for the series. “The Grand Tour” reunites Clarkson with his fellow “Top Gear” co-hosts, Richard Hammond and James May. The BBC fired Clarkson from the popular show following allegations that he assaulted a producer. \n“Amazon spent far less than Netflix would have you believe,” Clarkson said in an interview published Wednesday with CNN . “It’s nowhere near as expensive as people have been saying.” \nHe was responding to a claim by Netflix chief content officer Ted Sarandos, who said in an interview with the Telegraph newspaper earlier this week that A mazon paid far more than the previously reported $160 million for the 12-episode series. \n“That’s an under-reported number,” said Sarandos, who acknowledged that Netflix had bid for the show. “It was about a quarter of a billion dollars.” \nIn the CNN interview, Clarkson said that “of course” he knew what Amazon is spending on “The Grand Tour,” but declined to reveal the figure: “It’s just not a British thing,” he said, adding, “I mean, look at me. Do I look like I’m making $300 million a year?” \nThis past Monday, Amazon said “Grand Tour” broke Prime Video records after the first episode’s Nov. 18 premiere among members in the U.S., U.K., Germany, Austria and Germany. The company didn’t provide specific numbers except to say “millions” of users streamed the episode over the opening weekend, beating Prime Video’s previous record-holder, “The Man in the High Castle.” Related Amazon’s ‘The Grand Tour’ Leaves ‘Top Gear’ in the Dust, British TV Critics Say \nAmazon last year announced a deal with the three former “Top Gear” hosts for a new show produced by the trio’s longtime executive producer, Andy Wilman. According to Amazon, on Nov. 18 when “The Grand Tour” debuted, total new Prime membership signups exceeded all previous days with the exception of Amazon’s Prime Day, when it has offered special discounts. \nNetflix, meanwhile, has reportedly acquired streaming rights to the BBC’s revamped “Top Gear” with Matt LeBlanc . In the Telegraph interview, Sarandos tried to cast doubt on how successful “Grand Tour” would be: “It’ll be interesting with ‘Grand Tour’ to see how much of that is the players, who in many cases are big personalities, but what elements of ‘Top Gear’ will people miss?” he said. \nAmazon has said “The Grand Tour” will be available to stream in 200 countries worldwide in December — leading to speculation that the ecommerce giant will also be launching Prime Video in a global challenge to Netflix. To date, Amazon has not confirmed its plans for international expansion beyond its current Prime Video footprint, although it quietly launched the service in Australia last week . \n“Grand Tour” — which Clarkson dubbed “‘Top Gear’ in witness protection” — is the highest-rated TV show or movie by users on Amazon-owned IMDb. It currently has an overall rating of 9.6 out of 10 stars based on more than 13,000 ratings. It also currently has an audience score of 98% on Rotten Tomatoes . \nIn Amazon’s “Grand Tour,” Clarkson, Hammond and May host the show from a travelling tent in locations around the world including Johannesburg, California, Scotland, Rotterdam, Lapland, Nashville, Whitby in North Yorkshire, Stuttgart and Dubai. \nThe first episode kicked off in California, when the trio set up camp at Dry Rabbit Lake in the Mojave Desert near Lucerne Valley, outside of L.A. There, they staged a “Burning Van” festival for thousands of fans, which was featured in the series opener. Filed Under:",

      "text": "Lauren Graham and Alexis Bledel (Credit: Netflix) More Today is the day Netflix unveils all four new episodes of Gilmore Girls , collectively known as Gilmore Girls: A Year In The Life . I’ve already written a spoiler-free, overall review of the quartet of Stars Hollow specials, but beginning today I will write one review a day for the next four days, of each individual episode. Today’s review is of “Winter.” You are hereby and loudly warned: WALL-TO-WALL SPOILERS OF GILMORE GIRLS: A YEAR IN THE LIFE FOLLOW . Grab a mug of coffee and some Tater Tots. Creator Amy Sherman-Palladino, who wrote and directed this episode, knows how to transport us back to the Gilmore Girls circa 2005-6, AKA, The Last Real Gilmore Girls Era. Before, that is, the well-intentioned but generally misconceived Sherman-Palladino-less seventh season. And the way to do that immediate transportation in the Netflix series is via the lovely “la-la-la”s of Sam Phillips on the soundtrack, as a camera pans across the town square of Stars Hollow to settle on Lauren Graham’s Lorelai Gilmore, bundled against the cold, coffee in her mittened hands. She’s soon joined by Alexis Bledel’s Rory, who, now at age 32, is leading the wastrel freelancer’s life and finds it difficult to pick up cellphone reception in Stars Hollow — “the town we constructed in a giant snow globe,” says Lorlelai, in what I’ll assume doubles as a Sherman-Palladino reference to the finale of St. Elsewhere . Indeed, the pop-culture references fly fast and furiously, with Lorelai and Rory getting off a rapid-fire set of them upon first hugging hello, just so we can relax and be confident that Graham and Bledel still have the chops to handle Sherman-Palladino’s unique mixture of His Girl Friday -meets-Gwyneth Paltrow frame of reference. (Early on, one of those compulsive name-droppings takes on unexpected added poignance when a joke is made about Lane’s husband Zack resembling “a young Leonard Cohen.”) And so it zings along. Lena Dunham, Gail Collins, John McPhee , Ben Affleck, and The Sopranos go into the Gilmore blender along with scores more; the air is thick with snow and the zeitgeist. In the initial seasons of Gilmore Girls, it was a constant surprise to hear so many real-life names, historical events, and brand-name foods stuffed into any given hour — a happy surprise for fans, a puzzlement for anyone benighted enough to be able to resist the show’s methodology. The “Winter” episode takes full advantage of its 90-minute length to re-establish certain core elements. Luke (Scott Patterson) is still backward-baseball-cap-wearing Luke, still cranky in his café. (He has the added crank of contending with layabout customers nursing half a cup of java while bleating at him for his WiFi password, which he invents willy-nilly, just to thwart them.) The small town is still dense with familiar eccentrics, and this episode shines a particular spotlight on Sean Gunn’s Kirk, whose latest crack-brained business idea is his own variation on Uber called (I’m trying to reproduce this phonetically here) h-ber, which consists of you calling Kirk’s mom, who’ll then call him, and he’ll pick you up in whatever vehicle is at hand in the moment. It’s ridiculous; it’s sublime. Gilmore Girls is not Gilmore Girls , however, without a certain amount of tension, and Amy S-P provides three crackling electric eels to jolt our beloved mother and daughter. First is Rory’s current life status: Single, unemployed, and not doing all that well in either of these categories. She had a “Talk of the Town” piece published in The New Yorker — my guess is that it was at the least a year or two earlier — and she’s been trying to ride that impressive surge in professional recognition into regular employment of some sort: more assignments, or a book project, or a staff job somewhere. Gotta say, I feel for Rory, that she’s spent the years we’ve been Gilmore -less trying to get further along; given what a golden academic life she led, we ought to think that her current situation must be depressing for her. Especially since everyone in Stars Hollow keeps talking about that damn “Talk of the Town” piece! Luke’s even laminated it onto the back of the cafe menu! I firmly believe that Lorelai would have/should have talked him out of this — she, of all people, would know how heavily this must weigh upon Rory. Related: ‘Gilmore Girls’: A Journey Through Lorelai’s Love Life Read More Speaking of Lorelai and Luke: They’re living together, and Lorelai is wondering whether she and Luke should have a child — via surrogacy (Stars Hollow is a magical place, but it can’t perform ovarian miracles). This subplot reintroduces Liza Weil and Paris, as sleek as though she’d just stepped off the How To Get Away With Murder soundstage, which she probably did, with Paris now the boss of a high-profile surrogacy clinic in Manhattan. This is not the profession I’d have pegged Paris to pursue, but I’ll go with it, especially since it enables Amy S-P to write many funny jokes about “breeders” and elicits some of Scott Patterson’s best comic acting when he’s confused about whether or not he’s supposed to have one-on-one sex with each surrogate. Finally: Emily Gilmore. The entire quartet of new episodes is heavy with the memory of the late Richard Gilmore, who was played by the late Edward Herrmann. The new Gilmore s play this death for everything it deserves, which is a lot. Herrmann’s performance was an anchor for the series, and not because he was the strongest — most rooted; most comfortable in his own skin — male figure that Amy S-P created. Certainly Kelly Bishop’s Emily matched Richard when it came to strength of character and will. But this show went all-in on the perhaps now unfashionable idea that daughters can relate to their fathers in a different way than they do with their mothers. In this case, Richard was quicker to forgive and more overtly eager to reestablish regular contact with Lorelai when the series first began. (Emily was, too, but she held onto her reservations/grudges more stubbornly and kept that particular yearning for mother-daughter kinship pushed down, in the great WASP tradition.) His death left a huge hole in the lives of Emily and Lorelai in particular. (Rory, having always enjoyed an unconflicted relationship with her grandfather, passed through the stages of grief with more serenity.) And that hole will not be entirely filled — even by the gigantic portrait of Richard commissioned by Emily that inspires one of this episode’s best testy exchanges. The Richard-less Emily is at once adrift and in flux; numb with sadness, unmoored in what has always been a balanced life, she tries to find some solace in changing her immediate surroundings. She falls for the fad of “de-cluttering” her house, an impeccable set-up for the moment in which Amy S-P takes full advantage of being on Netflix: The sight of prim Emily in jeans and a t-shirt, an outfit so shockingly unthinkable that Lorleai reacts with a barely-suppressed, “Holy s–t!” “Winter” takes us back four months, to Richard’s funeral, and explores the different ways people express grief. Emily is able to keep up a brave front while breaking inside; Lorelai is cracking, self-medicating with booze, and she (as Richard would put it) lets down the side by telling an awfully inappropriate — in part because it is so uncharacteristically-for-her banal — anecdote at the funeral reception that tears open the wound between mother and daughter yet again. That the episode ends with Emily deciding she’ll see a therapist, and tricking Lorelai into coming along, sends A Year In The Life aloft with the best sort of beginning. Extra Gilmore Gifts: Ray Wise appearing as Richard’s old pal from Yale made me wonder momentarily whether Sherman-Palladino was setting up a Twin Peaks joke. Revelation of the episode: Emily has never met Kirk before now!!! Lane, Zack and the band Hep Alien execute a killer cover of Joe Jackson’s “I’m The Man” in a show that exalts women above all. Best insult: Emily referring to Stars Hollow as being composed of “carnys and misfits.” Best line-reading: Lauren Graham biting down hard on the words, “You’re horrible!” Gilmore Girls: A Year In The Life is streaming now on Netflix.",

      "text": "Experts say the excitement about the new episodes of Gilmore Girls, released today on Netflix, could signal a broader audience hunger for less distressing, more comforting television. \"I think that TV has been dominated, particularly cable, for years by antiheroes: by the Sopranos, by the Don Drapers, by the characters from Breaking Bad, who are all monsters on different levels,\" says Daniel Fienberg, TV critic for the Hollywood Reporter. The protagonists of the Gilmore Girls, he says, are complex but essentially loveable.\n\"They're a mother and a daughter who are best friends, who love each other. And that is a comforting, happy, pleasant thing.\"\nStressful television\nBut Fienberg and other TV observers think it's not just the scripted-television stress that the viewers are seeking shelter from. He says shows like Gilmore Girls, with its scenic setting in fictional town Stars Hollow, provide a respite for viewers \"who have been glued to the TV for 12 months for one of the ugliest political campaigns in American history.\"\nBritish writers Caroline Crampton and Anna Leszkiewicz, who host the pop culture podcast SRSLY, know the soothing power of Gilmore Girls firsthand.\nThey are huge fans of the show, and turned to it after a long week of U.S. election coverage at New Statesman, a British magazine where they both work.\n\"We work at a predominantly political magazine; it was a really tough few days of work,\" said Crampton in an interview with CBC in London. \"When I got home, the first thing I could think of to do was get really warm and go to Stars Hollow, watch some Gilmore Girls and it did calm me down enough to finally go to sleep, so it worked.\"\nCozy, but not cutesy\nGilmore Girls isnot the only TV equivalent of a warm blanket and a cup of tea. A few recent family dramas have also shown promise to delight viewers without resorting to violence, graphic sexuality, or a cynical world view.\nOn NBC, newbie family drama This is Us recently drew more than 14 million viewers, the numbers usually reserved for shows like the Walking Dead.\nQueen Sugar, a new family saga by Selma director Ava Duvernay, is getting critical acclaim and a loyal audience buzz on social media for its portrayal of siblings whose lives are turned upside down when their father leaves them a sugar plantation.\nBad things do happen on these shows: family members face crises and characters even die. On the new episodes of Gilmore Girls, the family patriarch is gone (the actor who played him, Edward Herrmann, died in 2014), and the Gilmore women have to learn to get along without him.\nBut the essential underpinning of these shows is that the world isn't an evil place.\n\"It's about the idea that problems that you have, some of which may come from your family, can also sometimes be solved by your family, and by community, and by coming together,\" says TV critic Fienberg.\n\nThe future of family drama\nBut do these family dramas have a chance for a lasting future in a TV landscape that's more competitive than ever?\nLeszkiewicz cautions the show's easy charms may not be palatable to viewers conditioned to cliffhangers and dramatic plot twists.\n\"It's about people and place more than it's about drama,\" said Leszkiewicz in an interview with CBC in London. \"So if you're someone who wants racing plot lines, huge dramatic arcs, you are probably not going to find it in Gilmore Girls.\"\nAnd there is a reason these types of shows have not dominated award shows in recent years in the way Game of Thrones or House of Cards have. Family dramas have always been around, but a good one comes only once in a while, and that has likely contributed to the image of these shows as cheesy and maudlin in the minds of uninitiated viewers.\n\"It's one of the toughest genres to do right. Because you can't have just one star or two stars, you have to have the whole family, you have to be able to reproduce decades of family history, and that's something that isn't easy,\" says Fienberg.\nBut he adds that the enduring appeal of Gilmore Girls, which he says has more fans now than it did in its original run between 2000 and 2007, proves that family dramas can be a winner.\n\"There ought to be room for shows that play emotionally broadly but maybe play to only a limited audience that happen to love them,\" says Fienberg, urging TV networks to not only consider ratings, but audience loyalty and engagement when deciding which shows to greenlight and renew. \n\"How many of us have survived the zombie apocalypse? Not that many. How many of us have survived Thanksgiving with our families? The answer is hopefully most of us.\"",

      "text": "(Netflix)\nEpisode 2 of Gilmore Girls: A Year In the Life opens up with Emily and Lorelai in therapy together, barely speaking to each other. The two then turn on the therapist before their session ends. In the next scene, Luke, Lorelai and Rory are checking out the International Food Festival in Stars Hollow. Rory against has to head out on a flight after. In the meantime, she heads over to Lane and her mother, Mrs. Kim’s table. \nSoon comes the picnic basket auction and Lorelai decides to big on a basket. And finally, we get to see what Lane’s father looks like as he waves to Lane and Rory from across the festival. Then, Lorelai runs into Jackson, Sookie’s husband. Check out Mr. Kim in the below screenshot photo. \n(Netflix)\nAfter the festival scene, Rory is shown back in London, continuing to try to nail down a solid job. She sits down for lunch with Logan and the two are interrupted by his father, aka the thorn in Rory’s side. Logan’s dad offers to help Rory book her meeting with Condenast, which keeps getting pushed back. Rory thanks him, but rejects his offer. \nIn the next scene, a town meeting is taking place. This is where we see Babbett for the first time and Gypsy for the second time. A movie is being filmed in nearby Woodbury and Taylor Dosey wants the town to get in on the action. \nOne night at Lorelai’s house, Luke’s sister Liz and her husband TJ call and reveal they accidentally joined a vegetable cult. \nIn the middle of the night, Lorelai wakes up from a dream and calls Rory, who is in London at Logan’s place. Lorelai is worried that Michel will leave the Dragonfly and that the dream she and Sookie had with the Inn will fall apart. \nAgain we see the ups and downs of Lorelai and Emily’s therapy sessions. This time, Emily recalls a terrible letter that Loreai wrote her on her birthday, but Lorelai insists no letter exists. \nBack in London, Rory struggles professionally and offers to stay longer with Logan, but he has another “friend” coming into town, so Rory realizes she cannot stay. \n(Netflix)\nIn the next scene, we are back in the Stars Hollow movie theater and Kirk talks about one of the first film shorts he debuted ever in town. Now, he is debuting his second film. As the film airs, Luke receives a phone call from Emily, which he ignores. Emily leaves a message that she wants him to go to her house for dinner that week. \nBack at the Inn, Lorelai is missing Michel, who is on the schedule as being on vacation. Lorelai heads into the kitchen where Rachael Ray is cooking up sandwiches. Lorelai vents to her that she worries Michel will leave the Inn. Then, Lorelai tells Rachael that she has to let her go because her pop-up restaurant is unsuccessful. \nLuke and Lorelai head to Emily’s for dinner, where Emily tells Luke in private that he needs a will. She then tells Luke that Richard left him a sum of money with the purpose of expanding Luke’s Diner and creating an empire. \nLater on in the episode, Rory meets with Chairmaster Charleston, who tells Rory that he’s enjoyed reading her work over the years. Charleston also offers his sympathies when it comes to the death of Grandpa. Rory and Paris hit up Chilton together., going back to Chilton in order to speak to the students at the school about their journeys going forward. Rory’s presentation was full of nostalgia and encouragement while Paris’ made children cry.\nEmily and Lorelai, back in therapy, argue over the status of Lorelai’s relationship with Luke because they never married. \nBack at Chilton, suddenly Paris becomes unglued and nauseous, running for the bathroom, when she spots former high school crush Tristan. Tristan was not played by original actor Chad Michael Murray. Paris worries she is still in love with Tristan and confesses that her own children like the nanny more than her. Suddenly, former nemesis Francie enters the bathroom and Paris fires off at her. Their interaction concludes with a “screw you” and an “eat me.” When Francie leaves the room, Paris wonders about Doyle and talks about the relationship they had. \nBefore leaving the school, Headmaster Charleston asks Rory if she would consider getting her Masters Degree and coming back to teach at Chilton. He praises her accomplishments and says that she’s welcome to teach at the school if she chooses. Rory thanks Charleston, but declines his offer before the students from Paris’ lecture head into his office. \nRory and Paris head back to Paris house. As they are chatting, Doyle comes home with the kids and catches up with Rory, who he reveals he keeps in contact with. Paris then asks Rory if she was having an affair with Doyle. Rory offers to babysit their kids and, while sitting, she calls Logan and asks if his father could still put in a good word for her with Condenast. Logan is happy to do so. In the background, we see a woman asleep in his bed. After Rory’s meeting with GQ, she worries that nothing will come of it. \n(Netflix)\nEmily decides that she wants to quit therapy, leaving Lorelai at the therapist’s office. She recalls when Richard passed away, finding out he had a big heart attack and ended up in the ICU. While in the ICU, Lorelai says he was very angry that something like that could take him down. She says his last words were, “Get the hell away from me,” to the nurse. She says that she and her mother never got that sweet “goodbye” moment. Lorelai then talks about her happiness with Luke and begins to look confused. \nBack at the diner, Emily shows up to talk about franchising the diner and insists that Luke head out with her and an adviser to check out possible franchise locations. On their outing, Emily reveals to Luke that she stopped going to therapy with Lorelai. When Luke gets home, he asks Lorelai about therapy and she lies to him, saying her mother did most of the talking at the psychiatrist’s office. \nAfter receiving a call from a failed book collaboration, Rory calls GQ and confidently tells them she’ll be working on a story for them … for free. And so, Lorelai joins Rory in the city to do research on Rory’s story. Lorelai gets tired and heads back to the hotel while Rory hangs out with a comic book crowd. She ends up upset and back at the hotel, telling her mother she had a one-night stand with one of the guys in the crowd. Rory then reveals to Lorelai that she has been sleeping with Logan for a long time. Apparently Logan is actually engage to a french heiress, so this is definitely worse than a one-night stand. \nRory worries about her future and her mother lends her advice about life in general. \nRory ends up with an interview at a company called “Sandy Says.” Unfortunately, Rory is thrown off guard by the interviewer’s questions and it doesn’t go well.

      "text": "(Netflix)\nThe very first part in the new Gilmore Girls revival for Netflix began with the sounds of scenes from throughout the original series as the opening credits rolled. And then of course, Winter came, Lorelai’s favorite time of year as she always waited anxiously for the snow to fall. And there she is, waiting on the steps of the town gazebo, surrounded by snow and towns people. Soon, Rory runs up, free off of a flight back to Stars Hollow. Rory is traveling for work and has almost no time to see her mother, who she doesn’t get to see very often. \nDue to a lack of time, the mother-daughter duo decide to explore the town a bit. So what’s new?\nTaylor has decided the town should switch from septic to sewer. Miss Patty is thinned and grayed, but she is still teaching dance. As Rory and Lorelai begin their tour, Rory gets a phone call but she has trouble hearing the call, with little reception. Trying to find reception, Rory heads into Dosey’s market where she runs into BFF Lane, who starts talking about how her hubby is no longer with his band.\nMeanwhile, on the street, Kirk runs into Lorelai and tells her about his latest business venture “Ooohber,” which is the same thing as the Uber app. Kirk is walking his pet pig and appears to still be with Lulu. \nWhen Rory meets her mother back on the street, Lorelai utters the words, “I smell snow.” She and Rory smile as the snowflakes begin to fall and then the town troubadour plays a soft song as the two stroll through town. \nNight hits and the girls head back to the Gilmore house to find Luke making dinner in the kitchen. Luke gushes over Rory, who apparently had one of her pieces published in The New Yorker, and he argues with the girls over their poor eating habits. Rory and Lorelai head into Rory’s room, which is filled with boxes from Rory’s Brooklyn apartment, which she recently moved out of. Soon, Rory’s boyfriend Paul shows up for dinner, which is unexpected because Rory forget she invited him. And, he seems very forgettable, especially when Lorelai and Luke are concerned. Rory scolds her mom and Luke for ragging on her boyfriend, though she almost seems to have the same opinion of him herself. \n(Netflix)\nWhile in bed, Luke is trying to use the DVR, but realizes it’s full of Lorelai’s movie picks. The two then carry on a pre-goodnight dialogue, picking at each other in true Lorelai-Luke fashion. In the middle of the night, Lorelai wakes up from having a nightmare and ventures downstairs where she finds Rory tap dancing her anxiety away in the kitchen.\nThe two then engage in a little gab session that turns serious when Lorelai says she’s been feeling her mortality lately. Rory asks if it’s “because of Grandpa.” Lorelai tears up and it’s clear she misses him. This is the first mention of Richard Gilmore’s passing. \nIn the next scene, Luke is working at the diner and he still has his “No Cell Phones” sign up, but is shown giving a customer his wifi password and login. At the diner, Taylor comes in to pester Luke about his sewer plan and then Kirk begins to brag about his new business. Soon, Paul shows up to find Lorelai and Rory at the diner. They forgot about him once again. Paul heads to the bathroom, the girls get their food to go, and they end up leaving, forgetting about him again … but Rory quickly remembers to wait for him. \nNext we see Lorelai and the Dragonfly Inn listening to Michel’s complaints. Then it’s revealed that they have a brand new chef named Roy for a pop-up dinner at the inn and Lorelai does not sound thrilled about the new guy. When we meet the chef, he thanks Lorelai for having Sookie set the kitchen up so perfectly for him. Soon, Lorelai realizes that the coffee machine is missing. Because Roy moves the coffee maker, Lorelai pushes him out the door. Michel complains that, once again, they have an empty kitchen. So, why is Sookie no longer at the inn? Apparently she took a 6-month leave that has lasted a lot longer than 6 months. Michel feels that Sookie abandoned them, while Lorelai says she has found her calling on a farm. \nLorelai tries out Kirk’s new “Ooohber” and Kirk serenades her with songs of The Carpenters to start the ride. Kirk’s rundown vehicle slowly pulls into Lorelai’s parents’ driveway. When Lorelai realizes that Rory has not yet arrived, she decides to wait and enter the Gilmore home as a team. When the two enter the Gilmore mansion, they realize that Grandma Emily’s maid’s entire family is living in the house with her. \nUpon venturing into the living room for drinks before dinner, Rory and Lorelai are shocked to see an unusually large portrait hanging of their grandfather. Lorelai is in disbelief that her mother would want a portrait of Richard that is so ridiculously huge. Emily finally admits she messed up the dimensions of the painting and she storms out of the room. Apparently, there was a mishap at Richard’s funeral 4 months earlier and Lorelai tells Rory about what happened in a flashback scene. \n(Netflix)\nThe funeral scene has no dialogue, just tears and somber music. Emily remains by the casket after the service, after everyone has left, sad to lose her husband and partner. Friends and family then gather at the Gilmore home after the services. A cause of death is not mentioned, but, in the original series, Grandpa had suffered from heart issues over the years, so we’re going to guess his death probably was of that nature. At the house, Jason Stiles shows up to pay his respects. Lorelai does say to Jason that, “At least it was sudden. Mom didn’t have to watch him fade away.” The two share some cute dialogue, using each other’s old nicknames – Oomlatts and Digger.\nRory leaves early to catch a flight and Lorelai stays behind to keep her mother company. Lorelai, Emily and Richard’s comrades all end up sharing stories about Richard to enjoy some memories together. When it comes to be a distracted Lorelai’s turn, she fumbles and accidentally tells some unflattering stories about her father. She even talks about when her dad caught her having sex.\nWhen everyone leaves, Lorelai cries to her mother that she’s sorry and that she didn’t mean what she said, that she was frazzled. Emily felt that what Lorelai said was pre-meditated. Lorelai cries about the pain she’s in and pleads with her mother to forgive her. Emily accuses her daughter of not caring that she lost her father and then she kicks her out of the house. \nThe show then switches back to “present day”, back at the Gilmore house. Kirk, who chauffeured Lorelai to the house, sits down with them for dinner. Rory reveals that she is still friends with Paris and that she is pretty much homeless. Soon, Luke shows up since Kirk’s car broke down. As the family gets into a discussion about Rory’s future, Kirk realizes that the maid’s children are playing soccer outside, so he excuses himself to join them. After dinner, Rory heads out to fly to London.\nLuke and Lorelai head to the diner and are tidying up. While cleaning, Lorelai finds a recent letter from Luke’s daughter April. Lorelai then asks Luke if he ever wanted to have a kid with her and the two get into a random discussion on the topic. Lorelai and Luke then consider parenthood and having a surrogate carrying the baby. While Luke and Lorelai sit in a doctor’s office waiting to discuss having a baby, we hear an angry Paris coming from inside the office. Then Paris appears and takes the couple in to talk about surrogate possibilities. Paris says she will offer them a considerable discount. Luke is turned off and does not wish to take part in surrogacy.\nRory is next shown making business deals in London before she heads back to an apartment, rambling about her lunch. Out of nowhere, we’re surprised to see Rory’s ex Logan emerge from another room and give Rory a kiss. Could this be?! Apparently the two of them have a “hook up” agreement when they see each other every now and then. Rory is soon reminded that she needs to break up with her forgettable boyfriend Paul. When it comes to Lorelai’s knowledge about where Rory stays in London, Rory tells her she always stays with her friend “DD.”\n(Netflix)\nIn the next scene, Paris ventures to the diner to try to convince Luke to engage in the surrogacy idea. Soon, Rory heads into the diner, running into Paris, who she asks if she can crash at her place. \nTaylor barges in and reveals to the customers that Luke only gives out fake Wifi passwords because he doesn’t want them using electronic devices in his diner. It looks like Luke is still Luke. Upon leaving, Taylor walks by a female troubadour, who is then chased away by the town troubadour. \nParis reveals that she and Doyle have split up and that he’s in film. Paris reveals to Rory that she will “kill him in court.” The couple apparently even has kids together. Paris and Rory then head to Lane’s house. She, her husband Zach and their sons still appear to live with band-mate Brian. The old band, including Gil get together in the living room to practice. \n(Netflix)\nWhile at Lane’s Rory gets on a call with her mother and asks her to check on Grandma Emily. When Lorelai gets to Emily’s she is practically emptying her house to start anew. She wishes to de-clutter her life. Emily is found wearing jeans and a t-shirt, which is highly unusual. Her explanation is that she’s given away most of her clothes upon de-cluttering the house. Emily and Lorelai share a drink and Emily talks about losing the love of her life for 50 years. Lorelai suggests that her mom seek therapy with a psychiatrist, something that Emily decides to follow up on later.\nAfter their little chat, Emily realizes she needs to get out of her jeans as they are pretty much beneath her. \nLuke and Lorelai run into Kirk in town and he reveals that the official Uber has threatened to sue him. While at the Polar Petting Zoo in town, Emily calls Lorelai and thanks her for suggesting a psychiatrist. Emily then tricks Lorelai into going with her to therapy. \nAnd that is where the premiere ends. \n‘Gilmore Girls’ Netflix Revival: Episode 4 Recap & Last Four Words Spoilers – ‘Fall’ The finale episode of the Gilmore Girls revival is titled \"Fall.\" Get the spoilers and recap on episode 4 at last, along with the shocking final four words.\nClick here to read more ‘Gilmore Girls’ Netflix Revival: Episode 2 Recap & Spoilers – ‘Spring’ Check out the full recap and spoilers for episode 2, titled \"Spring,\" from Netflix's Gilmore Girls. \nClick here to read more ‘Gilmore Girls’ Netflix 2016 Cast The 2016 Netflix revival of the Gilmore Girls premieres with new and old cast members. \nClick here to read more Lauren Weigle is a senior contributor to Heavy specializing in celebrity and reality television.

      "text": "Posted on November 25, 2016 by Travel News Headlines - Yahoo! News \n  \nThe holiday season has arrived, which means it’s time to eat yourself to the point of extreme discomfort, spend time with family and mentally check out during your time off to recharge before getting back to the grind. And while you’re stuck at home with your family and unable to move due to that crippling food coma, you’ll probably wind up on your couch watching movies. \nSo to help you avoid spending hours arguing with your family about what to watch (or the recent election), we’ve mined through Netflix to find the 10 best travel films currently available for you to watch over the holidays. Thank us later. 1. O Brother, Where Art Thou? \n[embedded content] A film based on one of the great adventure stories of all time, created by one of the greatest directors of all time, starring one of the greatest actors of our generation; what else do you need? George Clooney and John Turturro star in the Coen Brothers’ reimagining of The Odyssey as escaped convicts searching for hidden treasure in 1930s rural Mississippi. It’s epic, funny, dramatic and the folk-driven soundtrack is pretty much perfect. 2. Chef \n[embedded content] Part ode to cooking, part classic road trip, Chef is a feel-good movie that follows a struggling chef on a cross-country road trip in a recently purchased food truck as he tries to build a relationship with his young son and revive his career by getting back to his roots cooking Cuban sandwiches. It’s a little cheesy at times, but there’s enough food porn, witty banter and Sofia Vergara that it doesn’t matter. 3. Coming to America \n[embedded content] \nIt may be hard to remember now, but once upon a time, Eddie Murphy was actually funny. And back in 1988, when Murphy was still one of the most hilarious men on earth, he played Prince Akeem Joffer of the fictional country of Zamunda, who decides he wants to slum it in 1980s Queens before getting married and inheriting an African kingdom. \nThe satire calls attention to racial stereotypes and socioeconomic issues. It also makes light of travelers who want to live like the locals, even if that means sacrificing the enjoyment of their trip. Considering the desire of millennial travelers to get “authentic” experiences, the movie holds up perfectly. 4. Touching the Void \n[embedded content] Touching the Void is a documentary reenacting two adventurers’ harrowing 1985 climb of the nearly 21,000-foot Siula Grande in the Peruvian Andes. Tense throughout, the film follows Joe Simpson and Simon Yates as they battle extreme conditions on their descent from the summit of the previously unclimbed mountain after Simpson breaks his leg and Yates is forced to cut him loose to save his own life. Not exactly a cuddle-up-with-your-family-and-a-big-bowl-of-popcorn kind of movie, but definitely worth watching if you want an affirmation of the power of the human spirit. 5. Tommy Boy \n[embedded content] One of the ultimate buddy movies from one of the best comedy duos of the 90s, Chris Farley plays lovable buffoon Tommy Callahan (basically the same as every other Chris Farley character) and David Spade plays irritating know-it-all Richard. They’re forced into a cross-country sales trip in an attempt to save Tommy’s father’s company and the town it supports. Shenanigans ensue, slapstick comedy dominates and it’s got something for everyone, from a cow-poo covered Chris Farley singing Hall and Oates to Bo Derek in a bikini. 6. Kingpin \n[embedded content] Another great buddy film and road-trip movie, an even more politically incorrect farce starring Woody Harrelson, playing a hook-handed former-pro-bowler-turned-hustler, and Randy Quaid, playing an innocent young Amish man with dreams of bowling glory. The two set out on the road from Pennsylvania to Reno to compete in a bowling tournament to win $1 million to save an Amish community (and get Harrelson’s charcter out of poverty). This early Farrelly brothers movie is really about the glorious corruption of an innocent, the redemption of a lost soul and fast-paced comedy. 7. What About Bob? \n[embedded content] \nIn what might be his most underrated movie ever, Bill Murray plays a man who has a paralyzing fear of, well, just about everything. Murray’s character, Bob Wiley, has never even been on a vacation, but when his psychiatrist leaves town with his family for Labor Day, a panicked Bob goes full stalker and follows him. \nBob endears himself enough to steal the love of his shrink’s family, and as he hilariously expands his comfort zone and cures himself of his mental disorder, he simultaneously drives his shrink, played by Richard Dreyfuss, to the loony bin. Perfect to watch with your family. Or better yet, someone else’s family. 8. The Painted Veil \n[embedded content] Part period piece, part romance, part travel tale, The Painted Veil is set in 1920s China, where Edward Norton plays a doctor sent to a small village to treat a cholera epidemic with his unfaithful wife, played by Naomi Watts. As Norton tries to heal his patients, the couple tries to heal their relationship, and the whole thing is set in the jaw-dropping backdrop of the lush landscapes and karst peaks of rural China. 9. The Great Alone \n[embedded content] There are few greater adventures in the world than the Iditarod, or so it seems (nobody here at 10Best knows personally, because nobody at 10Best is crazy enough to go on a 1,150-mile dog-sled race in the Alaskan winter through temperatures that reach well below zero). The Great Alone tells the story of Lance Mackey, a four-time winner of both the Iditarod and Yukon Quest, from his childhood to his cancer diagnosis to his near miraculous comeback. If that’s not enough to convince you it’s worth watching, consider this: there are adorable puppies. So. Many. Adorable. Puppies. 10. Across the Universe \n[embedded content] Love The Beatles? Check out this film in which a character named Jude makes his way from Liverpool, England to New York. The film ambitiously tells the story of the 1960s – with all its Vietnam activism and hippies and existentialism – through 34 Beatles songs. Hate The Beatles? Go seek help. Bonus: Chasing Ice \n[embedded content] We know it’s the holiday season, and as much as we want your holiday to be a barrel of laughs, this is an important film worth watching. In Chasing Ice , environmental photographer and former global warming skeptic James Balog goes to the arctic with a team of adventurers to capture the movement of ice formations over the course of several years. Incredible time-lapse footage results in a visually stunning, dramatically captivating film that shows years’ worth of environmental change in a matter of seconds. The result is hauntingly beautiful, a little terrifying and truly mind-blowing. Share This:",

      "text": "Hands-on: Netflix 4K streaming on a Windows 10 PC   20:18   \nEarlier this week Microsoft announced that Netflix content could be watched on a Windows 10 PCs in the 4K. Together with the announcement also system requirements were revealed, a 7th generation Intel CPU and Microsoft’s Edge browser. \nGerman website Heise tested several hardware configurations for 4K streaming and found that modern graphics cards such as the GeForce GTX 1000 and Radeon RX 400 series can’t display Netflix’s 4K content. (Image Credit: Heise ) As expected, the video service only switched to the 4K resolution when an Intel CPU of the 7th generation (Kaby Lake) is available. \nThe GeForce GTX 1000 and Radeon RX 400 graphic cards likely don’t work with 4K streaming because the drivers don’t support the required PlayReady 3.0 copy protection yet. Nevertheless, the hardware should be compatible for both the required PlayReady 3.0 SL3000 and HDCP 2.2 copy protections. \nStreaming of 4K content is limited to Microsoft’s Edge browser on Windows 10, it can’t even be watched with the official Windows 10 Netflix app. That should change in the future, the streaming service is reportedly working on an update for the app that adds 4K streaming. \nHeise also tested 4K streaming on a Mini PC Asrock Beebox-S that is powered by a laptop class Core i3-7100U (with an integrated Intel HD Graphics 620 video chip). After a while Netflix switched to the 4K resolution as indicated by the A/V stats which can be revealed by pressing CTRL+ALT+SHIFT + D. During playback of the 4K-compatible re-release of the Gilmore Girls, “res” displayed with the value of “3840 × 2160″. \nThe Beebox has an additional chip for HDMI 2.0; To HDCP 2.2. The Kaby Lake generation CPUs are generally also compatible with its predecessors. Netflix 4K streaming also worked in a test with a Kaby Lake desktop processor. The used mainboard had no additional HDMI 2.0 chip and therefore only HDMI 1.4 was supported. Netflix requires a complete HDCP-2.2 copy protection chain for 4K streaming, but doesn’t require HDMI 2.0 but 4K displays via HDMI 1.4 are limited to a maximum refresh rate of 30 Hz. \nHeise concludes the story with, ” it’s astonishing that modern AMD-Polaris and Nvidia-Pascal graphics cards are not supported, although they support HDMI 2.0b and HDCP 2.2″. As stated before, the website thinks that is because the drives are not compatible with the required PlayReady 3.0 copy protection. It’s expected support will be added in the (near) future, AMD previously told Heise that Polaris should get PlayReady 3.0 support through a driver update. Related Forum:",

      "text": "Watch These 10 Great Travel Movies Currently on Netflix The best way to avoid a family argument this holiday season is by watching a movie \nNovember 25, 2016 \nThe holiday season has arrived, which means it's time to eat yourself to the point of extreme discomfort, spend time with family and mentally check out during your time off to recharge before getting back to the grind. And while you're stuck at home with your family and unable to move due to that crippling food coma, you'll probably wind up on your couch watching movies. \nSo to help you avoid spending hours arguing with your family about what to watch (or the recent election), we've mined through Netflix to find the 10 best travel films currently available for you to watch over the holidays. Thank us later. 1. O Brother, Where Art Thou? A film based on one of the great adventure stories of all time, created by one of the greatest directors of all time, starring one of the greatest actors of our generation; what else do you need? George Clooney and John Turturro star in the Coen Brothers' reimagining of The Odyssey as escaped convicts searching for hidden treasure in 1930s rural Mississippi. It's epic, funny, dramatic and the folk-driven soundtrack is pretty much perfect. 2. Chef Part ode to cooking, part classic road trip, Chef is a feel-good movie that follows a struggling chef on a cross-country road trip in a recently purchased food truck as he tries to build a relationship with his young son and revive his career by getting back to his roots cooking Cuban sandwiches. It’s a little cheesy at times, but there’s enough food porn, witty banter and Sofia Vergara that it doesn't matter. 3. Coming to America \nIt may be hard to remember now, but once upon a time, Eddie Murphy was actually funny. And back in 1988, when Murphy was still one of the most hilarious men on earth, he played Prince Akeem Joffer of the fictional country of Zamunda, who decides he wants to slum it in 1980s Queens before getting married and inheriting an African kingdom. \nThe satire calls attention to racial stereotypes and socioeconomic issues. It also makes light of travelers who want to live like the locals, even if that means sacrificing the enjoyment of their trip. Considering the desire of millennial travelers to get \"authentic\" experiences, the movie holds up perfectly. 4. Touching the Void Touching the Void is a documentary reenacting two adventurers’ harrowing 1985 climb of the nearly 21,000-foot Siula Grande in the Peruvian Andes. Tense throughout, the film follows Joe Simpson and Simon Yates as they battle extreme conditions on their descent from the summit of the previously unclimbed mountain after Simpson breaks his leg and Yates is forced to cut him loose to save his own life. Not exactly a cuddle-up-with-your-family-and-a-big-bowl-of-popcorn kind of movie, but definitely worth watching if you want an affirmation of the power of the human spirit. 5. Tommy Boy One of the ultimate buddy movies from one of the best comedy duos of the 90s, Chris Farley plays lovable buffoon Tommy Callahan (basically the same as every other Chris Farley character) and David Spade plays irritating know-it-all Richard. They're forced into a cross-country sales trip in an attempt to save Tommy’s father’s company and the town it supports. Shenanigans ensue, slapstick comedy dominates and it's got something for everyone, from a cow-poo covered Chris Farley singing Hall and Oates to Bo Derek in a bikini. 6. Kingpin Another great buddy film and road-trip movie, an even more politically incorrect farce starring Woody Harrelson, playing a hook-handed former-pro-bowler-turned-hustler, and Randy Quaid, playing an innocent young Amish man with dreams of bowling glory. The two set out on the road from Pennsylvania to Reno to compete in a bowling tournament to win $1 million to save an Amish community (and get Harrelson's charcter out of poverty). This early Farrelly brothers movie is really about the glorious corruption of an innocent, the redemption of a lost soul and fast-paced comedy. 7. What About Bob? \nIn what might be his most underrated movie ever, Bill Murray plays a man who has a paralyzing fear of, well, just about everything. Murray’s character, Bob Wiley, has never even been on a vacation, but when his psychiatrist leaves town with his family for Labor Day, a panicked Bob goes full stalker and follows him. \nBob endears himself enough to steal the love of his shrink’s family, and as he hilariously expands his comfort zone and cures himself of his mental disorder, he simultaneously drives his shrink, played by Richard Dreyfuss, to the loony bin. Perfect to watch with your family. Or better yet, someone else’s family. 8. The Painted Veil Part period piece, part romance, part travel tale, The Painted Veil is set in 1920s China, where Edward Norton plays a doctor sent to a small village to treat a cholera epidemic with his unfaithful wife, played by Naomi Watts. As Norton tries to heal his patients, the couple tries to heal their relationship, and the whole thing is set in the jaw-dropping backdrop of the lush landscapes and karst peaks of rural China. 9. The Great Alone There are few greater adventures in the world than the Iditarod, or so it seems (nobody here at 10Best knows personally, because nobody at 10Best is crazy enough to go on a 1,150-mile dog-sled race in the Alaskan winter through temperatures that reach well below zero). The Great Alone tells the story of Lance Mackey, a four-time winner of both the Iditarod and Yukon Quest, from his childhood to his cancer diagnosis to his near miraculous comeback. If that’s not enough to convince you it's worth watching, consider this: there are adorable puppies. So. Many. Adorable. Puppies. 10. Across the Universe Love The Beatles? Check out this film in which a character named Jude makes his way from Liverpool, England to New York. The film ambitiously tells the story of the 1960s – with all its Vietnam activism and hippies and existentialism – through 34 Beatles songs. Hate The Beatles? Go seek help. Bonus: Chasing Ice We know it’s the holiday season, and as much as we want your holiday to be a barrel of laughs, this is an important film worth watching. In Chasing Ice , environmental photographer and former global warming skeptic James Balog goes to the arctic with a team of adventurers to capture the movement of ice formations over the course of several years. Incredible time-lapse footage results in a visually stunning, dramatically captivating film that shows years' worth of environmental change in a matter of seconds. The result is hauntingly beautiful, a little terrifying and truly mind-blowing.",

      "title": "The Final Four Words, Emily Vs. Lorelai, Rory’s Love Life & More ‘Gilmore Girls’ Netflix SPOILERS",
      "text": "\nNetflix\n\nEarlier today, Netflix debuted Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life , the four-part, six-hour reunion of the beloved family dramedy. I posted my overall thoughts on the revival last week, and now that some of you have had time to watch the whole thing, let’s get into more detail of the parts that worked for me and the parts that didn’t — with full spoilers for the whole limited series — coming up just as soon as I accidentally join a vegetable cult… GREAT: The opening. \nThough I watched these episodes while New Jersey was in the midst of an unseasonable warm streak, I got chills during the entire opening sequence, which perfectly set the mood for the return by opening with snippets of classic dialogue (“Oy, with the poodles already!”) against a black background, all building the sense of nostalgia and anticipation until we hear Lorelai say, once again, “I smell snow”…\n… and then it is winter in Stars Hollow, and Sam Phillips is la-la-la’ing, and Lauren Graham sits on the steps of the gazebo, looking serene and happy even before Rory surprises her and they dive into their first bit of epic Amy Sherman-Palladino banter in a decade. After so much time away — not to mention the Palladino-less final season(*) — that opening instantly recaptures the feeling of the show at its best and sets a mood that led me to forgive many of the bumps that followed.\n(*) By the way, I’m not one offended by the seventh season’s existence. There had already been a lot of problems near the end of the Palladinos’ tenure (the introduction of April and the Lorelai/Luke estrangement that followed, to name a couple), and all things considered, David Rosenthal wrote a pretty good series finale . But neither he nor any of the other writers that year could duplicate Sherman-Palladino’s unique voice, even if they occasionally came up with strong moments that weren’t quip-dependent, like Lorelai singing “I Will Always Love You” at karaoke . \nNOT-SO-GREAT: The famous Final Four Words. \n“Mom.”\n“Yeah.”\n“I’m pregnant.”\nThis exchange between Rory and Lorelai was apparently how Amy Sherman-Palladino always intended to end the series, and she just carried it over to A Year in the Life . And you can see some very clear “all this has happened before, and all of it will happen again” full circle storytelling here, as Rory winds up repeating the unplanned(*) pregnancy that came to define her mother’s life.\n(*) In the days after I watched the episodes, I briefly pondered the idea that Rory planned this out with help from her fertility specialist pal Paris, but then Myles McNutt suggested I rewatch the Kiefer Sutherland discussion in “Fall,” which is interrupted in the middle by Rory getting a phone call that seems to completely throw her, which in turn makes the Christopher scene play very differently in hindsight: it’s not her doing research for the book, but her feeling him out for whether or not she should make Logan — her history-repeats-itself version of Christopher, a guy who’s perfect on paper but too weak to stand with her — a part of the baby’s life. \nBut like a lot of Rory’s character arc in the miniseries, it’s something that has a very different connotation when she’s 22 than when she’s 32. Even had Sherman-Palladino gotten to do it back in the ’00s, it wouldn’t have been nearly as big a life-exploding event as when Lorelai became pregnant with her — Rory would be a Yale graduate, an adult, and someone with a much healthier relationship with both her mother and grandparents (and would be more willing to accept the money Emily and Richard could offer to help her manage single motherhood) than Lorelai ever had — but it’s still a major bump in the road for someone who had her entire future mapped out. But in A Year in the Life , we see that Rory got badly lost on the way to that future. She didn’t become the next Christiane Amanpour, or Susan Orlean, or any of the other women to whose careers she might have aspired. There’s no great job in journalism for a baby to get in the way of, no incredible plan that becomes impossible if Rory is now a single mom. If anything — not that this should be a motivating factor towards Rory deciding to have and keep the baby — her pregnancy offers both a conclusion to the memoir she’s writing and an extra marketing hook when it’s published.\nAlso, the Final Four Words are more frustrating now than they would have been a decade ago, because back then they would have definitely meant the end of the story, where here it’s fodder for talk of Netflix doing yet another limited series, or maybe even a Rory-centric sequel series (James Poniewozik suggested the best title to me: Gilmost Girls ). Because anything can be revived now, and often is, it’s no longer the period on the end of the sentence — leaving us up in the air as to what’s coming next, but bringing some thematic closure to the story — but an ellipsis that, whether Sherman-Palladino intended it this way or not, will only drive speculation about more more more. \nGREAT: Emily and Lorelai’s reconciliation. \nEdward Herrmann’s death was a huge loss, but Richard’s absence gives A Year in the Life the strongest of its three main narratives, as it leads to an ugly falling-out between Emily and Lorelai, and forces the Gilmore matriarch to reconsider who she is and what she wants in a world without her beloved husband.\nWhere the passage of time has radically altered the nature of Rory and Lorelai’s relationship — it’s simply less remarkable for an adult daughter to be so friendly with her mother than when she was a teenager — the decade that’s passed changes nothing about who Emily and Lorelai are in relation to one another, which makes it easier to jump right back into their dynamic, and to offer some real growth and closure to it.\nKelly Bishop and Lauren Graham both did great work together, and apart, throughout this arc, but particularly in its climactic scene, where Lorelai — having failed in her attempt to recreate Chery Strayed’s Pacific Crest Trail hike from Wild — calls her mother and tells her the story she wishes she had told on the day of Richard’s funeral, with both women smiling through tears as they finally get to grieve this great man at the same time, in the same way. Beautiful.\nNOT-SO-GREAT: Most of the material about the men in Lorelai and Rory’s lives. \n\nThis is more a Rory issue than a Lorelai one, but neither thrilled me.\nI’ve been rewatching the early seasons with my daughter, and given how distant the characters grew towards the end of the series, it’s startling to be reminded of how palpable and hot their chemistry was back in the days when Lorelai was helping Luke repaint the diner. It was a bummer in later seasons when they seemed like they barely wanted to be in the same room together (even at times when the characters were meant to be getting along), and the lack of passion in their relationship when we revisit with them is also disappointing, even if it’s meant to be the point. Relationships don’t burn hot and bright forever, and they’ve reached the comfortable, if boring, old (non-)married couple phase of things — a rut that eventually sends Lorelai across the country to figure things out. It’s not an unrealistic story, but it reminds me of how one of my sisters used to complain about TV reunion movies (or long-delayed sequel films) because she didn’t like seeing how much older the characters looked after all that time away. Here, everybody looks great, but Luke and Lorelai going through the motions (even if they get it together in the end and get married) had just as much of an air of “you can’t go home again” as Rory’s adulthood – even if things ended happily with them realizing they have exactly what they want and finally getting married. \nAs for the younger Gilmore girl, at times A Year in the Life seemed designed specifically to frustrate the members of fandom’s various romantic teams – as well as those who were never crazy about any of the guys in her orbit. \nTeam Logan partisans get to enjoy that he has the most screentime of the three, is still romantically involved with Rory on some level, and appears to be responsible for Rory’s pregnancy (the timing’s all wrong for the Wookiee), and he’s less overtly a jerk than he was when they were in college together. But in many ways, their relationship is even crueler now, because for all of her protestations about their arrangement and understanding of its rules, he’s still cheating on his fiance with her, and will never commit to her, even if they might otherwise fit together so well.\nTeam Jess fans get to appreciate Milo Ventimiglia’s new pumped-up This Is Us physique, the fact that the nicer and more mature version of Jess we last saw in “The Real Paul Anka” seems to have stuck, and the way that he gives Rory the inspiration to start writing the book. And they can maybe even take comfort in the lovelorn look we see on his face when he leaves the Gilmore house late in “Fall.” But his appearances are brief, and it’s clear that Rory has stopped viewing him as a romantic option, though perhaps that could change in the wake of her pregnancy: if Logan is her Christopher, then Jess could be her Luke, content to help her raise another man’s child.\nI suppose there are still members of Team Dean, who have perhaps forgotten all of the many signs of how wrong he ultimately would have been for Rory, but as it is, Jared Padalecki only pops up for a brief, semi-obligatory cameo to remind us that he is married with many, many kids and still understandably uncomfortable around Rory.\nRory’s love life was never as compelling to me as her many friendships and familial bonds, and the way that she’s still so bound to Logan a decade later is another sad way in which it feels her life has been trapped in amber since last we saw her, because the Palladinos had a specific story they wanted to tell about her and were going to do it, come what may. The introduction of Paul (Antony Del Rio, the first of several Bunheads alums to pop up in small roles) seemed to be mocking the idea that Rory might have actually developed another love interest in the time away — as well as stealing a running gag from Arrested Development in a fashion that became particularly obvious when Mae Whitman (“Her?”) stood in line with Rory for half a minute in “Spring” — but mainly made Rory, Lorelai, and Luke all come across as self-involved jerks. (Rory is sleeping with Logan while technically still in a relationship with Paul, among other issues.) The Gilmore girls are often in danger of that to begin with (Lorelai in particular), so anything that emphasizes that quality is a bad idea.\nGREAT: Sookie’s one scene. \nMelissa McCarthy’s availability was extremely limited, but Sherman-Palladino got the maximum amount of value from the one scene she could commit to, which had virtually everything (other than flirting and/or bickering with Jackson) we might have wanted both from her returning to the role and her on screen with Lauren Graham again. It gets meta at points — Sookie on no longer being at the Dragonfly could just as easily be McCarthy comparing her first big role to her career today: “I miss it. I mean, I love what I’m doing…” — but largely stays focused on the dynamic between the best friends, and also the constant tension between Sookie and Michel, which is magnified now because Michel has had to take over Sookie’s role in Lorelai’s life, more or less.\nAnd speaking of which…\nNOT-SO-GREAT: Everything about Sookie’s absence. \nObviously, McCarthy’s stardom — and whatever level of estrangement she may or may not have from the rest of the Gilmore alums (who didn’t mention her by name once at the huge ATX Fest reunion of nearly every other surviving actor) — tied the Palladinos’ hands somewhat, especially since they didn’t know until late in the game whether she would appear at all. Still, many of the choices made to cover for Sookie were less than ideal, like having various celebrity chefs randomly opening pop-up kitchens at a small-town Connecticut inn. And good as the Lorelai/Sookie conversation was, I’d have gladly sacrificed a chunk of it if it had given the production enough time for McCarthy to do a quick wardrobe change, stand in front of a green screen, and smile broadly so that Sookie could be digitally inserted into the impromptu wedding scene. Once you establish that Lorelai’s best friend is back in town and eager to be a big part of her wedding, it becomes distracting and kind of sad to have her not standing there — even w y off on the fringes of that gazebo — when the nuptials actually happen. The Palladinos and Yanic Truesdale did a good job plausibly suggesting that Michel had risen up in Lorelai’s friendship rankings over the past 9 years, but it’s not right to have him standing up for her there and not Sookie. The wedding sequence as a whole — with its dancing girls, endless floral arrangements, and Luke passing Lorelai off to Rory (the true love of her life) — is so pretty and quintessentially Gilmore , but Sookie’s absence from it was unfortunate.\n\nGREAT: Everything Paris-related. \nI gave up on How To Get Away With Murder a long time ago, so I’m glad Liza Weil was able to find time in her schedule to reprise her role as Paris, who seemed to pop up whenever possible throughout the first two episodes, still capable of firing out Palladino dialogue with a speed and force equaled only by Graham and Bishop(*). And Paris was the show’s biggest success story in terms of showing a character transformed by the years and yet still fundamentally the same person we loved to watch way back when. She is older, a mom, and “the Pablo Escobar of the fertility world,” but she is also as neurotic and terrifying as always, whether she is hurling statuesque blondes at Luke, quoting Joseph Stalin at unnerved Chilton students, or yelling at Doyle(**) about the exhausting stairs in their house.\n(*) Alexis Bledel’s greatest strength was always on the dramatic end of things (watch the look on Rory’s face as another encounter with her dad has gone south), but even now, she has to flatten out her delivery to get all the banter out on time, where Weil, Graham, Bishop and a few others can fire it out while changing inflection as needed to really make the jokes land.\n(**) It’s unfortunate that she and Doyle couldn’t make it work, but not surprising — again, Paris is very difficult — and the show got to have fun with Danny Strong’s screenwriting career with Doyle’s new d-bag airs. \nNOT-SO-GREAT: Continuity errors. \nEven in the good old days, Gilmore Girls wasn’t all that diligent at keeping track of its own history, particularly when it came to how long and how well Luke and Lorelai knew each other before the events of the pilot. So it’s not surprising that the Palladinos would get some small details wrong a decade later. But because I’ve recently been rewatching season 1 with my daughter, some of the gaffes stood out more to me than if it had been a while since I’d refreshed my memory. For instance, Taylor spends much of “Winter” trying to get rid of Stars Hollow’s septic tank system, when one of the key facts that Lorelai and Rory tell Christopher upon his first visit to the town is that they recently replaced their septic tanks with a sewer, while the business about Emily and Richard’s familiar fall vacation rental in Nantucket ignores that their favorite rental place was on Martha’s Vineyard, and they went in the spring, because the fall was for their periodic trips to Europe. Neither of those, nor any of the other small continuity slip-ups, is a big deal, but when you make a show that’s primarily designed for obsessives, you are going to have the obsessives notice things that don’t fit.\n(On the other hand, Lorelai’s anecdote about her 13th birthday also flies in the face of things said in the original series — where Lorelai once lamented that she and Richard never had some great big moment almost exactly along these lines — but the execution of that scene is so lovely that I didn’t care. Plus, you can always choose to read it as Lorelai telling a very elaborate fib as a kindness to her mother.)\nGREAT: Sutton Foster’s closing musical number. \nThe solo that Foster sings near the end of “Summer” is every bit the show-stopper you might have hoped for from the Tony winner and former Bunheads star, one of a handful of the very best things in all of A Year in the Life , and easily the best part not involving someone from the original series. (Though some of the scene’s power obviously comes from seeing Lorelai’s reaction to it as she considers the state of her life and relationship.)\nNOT-SO-GREAT: The rest of the musical performances in “Summer.” \nAt first, the spectacle of Foster and her Tony-winning ex-husband Christian Borle giving their all to Taylor’s awful musical about the history of Stars Hollow is funny in a Waiting for Guffman sort of way. But it just… keeps… going. The sequence lasts over nine minutes, by which point the joke has long since been exhausted — not just due to the length, but because in the attempt to make clear how terrible the show is (which Lorelai can see and Gypsy and the others somehow can’t), it goes wildly off-brand for Taylor and for the town, which have always been portrayed as Pollyanna-ish to a fault. It’s the sort of indulgence made possible because of the 90-minute length of each episode, and surely the first thing that would have been trimmed, if not removed outright, if the Palladinos had to deal with time limits.\n(Even Carole King’s cameo as a Stars Hollow townie whose private singer-songwritering is not appreciated didn’t fit the worldview of a show that gleefully marinates itself in popular culture. You don’t have to have King play herself, but if you’re going to have her in another role, play one of her signature songs, and get dismissed by Taylor and company, it’s going to feel off.)\nGREAT: Hep Alien plays Joe Jackson. \nAs happened throughout the later seasons of the series, Lane and her band got pretty short shrift in A Year in the Life , but it was still sweet to have the band get together for one performance, tearing their way through a cover of “I’m the Man.” It feels fair that the band never hit the big time — or even the medium time — and that Zach has had to take a straight job while Lane helps her mom run the store, but the group still gets together to play their tight power-pop covers after all these years.\nPlus, Paris’ reaction to the performance is maybe the best thing Liza Weil does in the whole endeavor.\n\nNOT-SO-GREAT: The Life and Death Brigade rides again. \nAs with the continuity errors, your feelings about the Life and Death Brigade will likely depend on how recently you rewatched the series, and how far you got into it. I honestly had to look up these guys on the Gilmore wiki to remind me who they were. Parts of the sequence with them were fun — feeling more like a musical version of the show than the Foster/Borle songs from “Summer” did — but like Taylor’s musical, it just ran and ran. If you’re a big fan of season 5, you may have delighted at it all; as someone who prefers the Chilton years, I’d have rather seen some of that time go to Lane, or Gypsy, or even a catch-up with someone the miniseries otherwise didn’t have time for. (Max Medina? Luke’s sister Liz and her boyfriend T.J. finally getting out of escrow ? Even more Digger? Okay, maybe not that last one.)\nGREAT: Emily — and only Emily — swears. \nIt doesn’t happen until more than midway through “Fall,” but hearing Emily Gilmore loudly — and in the repressed, social norm-revering company of her friends from the DAR — say “Bullshit” was delightful. She says it a few more times, and in a later scene, she gets to refer to her Nantucket neighbors the Blackstones as “pricks.”\nI wouldn’t have blamed the Palladinos if they had wanted to go full Mamet after spending all those years dealing with WB censors, but it wouldn’t really fit the voice of the show any more than most of season 7 did. At the same time, mistress of decorum Emily Gilmore learning the joy of Words You Can’t Say on Broadcast Television felt very true to the story A Year in the Life was telling about the woman she’s become in the aftermath of Richard’s death.\nNOT-SO-GREAT: All the cameos from Gilmore newbies. \nWith the exception of Foster’s solo, plus a few newcomers (fellow Bunheads alum Julia Goldani Telles, Ray Wise, Alex Kingston) who stuck around long enough to be given actual characters, nearly all the cameos were so clumsy and perfunctory that Graham might as well have just turned to the camera at the start of each to say things like, “Why, it’s my other TV daughter Mae Whitman!” I’m aware that in many cases, these are busy actors (or celebrity chefs) who couldn’t stop by for more, or in different places, but even the context in which many of them were used was disappointing. How do you put Whitman, TV’s best crier, on such a tear-friendly show and not give her some excuse to let the waterworks fly — even if it’s just over her failure to get a new cronut? Since Jason Ritter has played love interest to both Graham and Bledel (even if This Is Us never aired), couldn’t he have popped up in a scene with both Gilmore girls? (If you’re going to go in-jokey anyway, might as well have Lorelai and Rory uncomfortably realizing they’re attracted to the same guy for the first time ever.)\nAlso, you don’t have Luke explain that he’s secretly good friends with Kiefer Sutherland and then not actually produce Kiefer Sutherland. That’s poor sportsmanship.\n\nSome other thoughts that didn’t quite fit the high/low format:\n* Would it have been so hard to cut together scenes from the whole miniseries to create a new title sequence when it finally came time to play “Where You Lead” over the closing credits? Lane plays drums, Paris yells about the steps, etc.\n* Though the Richard story was mostly about Emily and Lorelai, the scene where Rory enters Richard’s study to start writing the book — and an archival Edward Herrmann clip is inserted for a moment to make it feel like Richard is still there — was incredibly poignant. Rory was ultimately closer to Richard than Lorelai ever was, and her loss needed to be acknowledged, too.\n* Character I was most pleasantly surprised to see return: Alex Borstein as Gilmore family personal stylist Miss Celine. Borstein was originally cast as Sookie (I’ve seen that version of the pilot; Sookie’s clumsiness in the final version and the next few episodes are an artifact of how good Borstein was at slapstick) but couldn’t get out of her Mad TV contract, so the Palladinos wrote her a few consolation prize roles, first as the Independence Inn’s harpist Drella, then as Miss Celine. Since A Year in the Life is as much an ode to the entire life of the series as it is a continuation of the story, it felt good to have Borstein there, playing a very broad character, but one who works in small doses.\n* Character I wasn’t expecting to see in that way: Tristan, but only from the back of his head. I don’t know if Chad Michael Murray was busy, or just uninterested in coming back for a role he hasn’t played in 15 years, but if he wasn’t going to do it, better to just have Paris reference an off-camera Tristan than to show a blonde stand-in.\n* Mixed feelings about Emily’s newest housekeeper Berta. On the one hand, it’s another running gag the miniseries devotes a lot of time to with diminishing comic returns. On the other, by the end, the presence of Berta and her ever-expanding family in Emily’s homes is sweet, even touching — as crucial a sign of Emily’s transformation post-Richard as the cursing. Once upon a time, Emily Gilmore replaced her housekeepers weekly for the most minor of sins; now, she keeps Berta and her family in her life, despite Berta not being particularly good at her job, because she and her cousins make the house feel less lonely.\n* Another nice nod to the show’s origins in a different way: in the Christopher scene, Rory quotes Faith from Buffy the Vampire Slayer , the show that helped define the WB and make it a place where Gilmore Girls would soon belong.\n* Kirk having a pet pig is one of those ideas that was probably funnier in theory than it turned out in execution, but the Oober running gag from “Winter” kept amusing me, particularly when we hear Lorelai yell “Do not make that sound!” from off-camera at one point.\n* Michel’s personal life was a mystery on the original series, but here he’s written as explicitly gay, while there’s also a weird joke at one of the town meetings where all the locals are eager to hear Taylor finally out himself.\n* For a show that usually steered far away from body-shaming humor (and rarely even alluded to the difference in size between Lorelai and Sookie), the running gag early in “Summer” about the overweight guy in the Speedo at the pool felt very wrong.\n* Michel with possibly the line of the miniseries, cruelly interviewing his potential replacement: “So, your name is Molly. Why?”\n* One smaller disappointment about the musical: we only got about five seconds of Kerry Butler — the Tony-nominated actress who played Emily’s therapist Claudia — singing a number from Bye Bye Birdie in her audition. She’s not as famous — particularly in TV circles — as Foster or Borle, but once I saw her as Claudia, I assumed she was cast because she’d get a chance to sing. Which she did — just very, very briefly.\n* Given his hatred of technology intruding into the diner, why would Luke have installed wifi in the first place, especially if it meant constantly being asked about the passcode?\n* Grant-Lee Phillips singing Fountains of Wayne’s “Valley Winter Song”? Thank you very much for that, Gilmore Girls .\nWhat did everybody else think?

      "text": "12 minutes ago \nMinor spoilers ahead for Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life . \nToday is one of the most glorious days of TV fandom history. While Black Friday might be exciting for people who want to get a new TV or start their Christmas Shopping, Black Friday 2016 will forever be associated with the release of Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life . The Netflix miniseries features four 90-minute episodes of the dramedy, and features the return of basically every major character in the WB/CW show's seven season tenure. And while some actors' schedules made it hard for them to be featured, one actor has to be recast completely: Chad Michael Murray's character Tristan. \nThe third episode of A Year in the Life , \"Spring\" Tristan reemerges in the lives of Rory and Paris Gellar. This revival of the love triangle is a lovely call back to Season 1 and 2 of Gilmore Girls , and once again allows us to peel back the layers of Paris' complicated psyche. Unfortunately, this moment is a little strange because One Tree Hill actor Chad Michael Murray isn't playing the role, and it was instead recast. Bummer. \nSources close to TV Line are reporting that this recast was due to Chad Michael Murray himself. He was apparently invited to reprise the role, as was Digger, Rory's boyfriends, Logan's father and the entire town of Stars Hollow. But Murray turned it down, and production had to find a replacement so that Tristan's role in the miniseries (and therefore, Paris' role as well) would still appear in \"Spring\". \nIt seems strange that Chad Michael Murray would decline to return for Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life . Regardless of your relationship with the series or how well it's currently being received, you can't deny that the reboot is a bit of a pop culture phenomenon. The four episode season has garnered a ton of press, and A-list alums like Melissa McCarthy and Milo Ventimiglia have returned to Stars Hollow to have fun and speak really, really quickly. \nChad Michael Murray hasn't exactly had the busiest of careers in recent years. While he was fairly successful in the early 2000's through his work on Gilmore Girls , One Tree Hill , House of Wax , and Freaky Friday , he hasn't continued this exhausting pace of film and TV roles. Agent Carter was just tragically cancelled, leaving his schedule fairly open for new projects. While he did a quick guest spot on the first season of Scream Queens , it should have been easy for him to return for Tristan's scenes. \nAlas, Chad Michael Murray was about the only actor in Gilmore Girls ' ensemble cast to decline returning. Luckily for us, he was about the only one, and this weekend will be full of tears, laughter, and lots and lots of coffee.",

      "text": "\n\nIt’s not often you get a second chance to make a last impression.\nWell, if you assume this Netflix revival is the last we see of Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life (Nov. 25, *** 1/2 out of four), which these days in general — and with this show in particular — is probably unwise.\nWhen WB’s cult hit ended in 2007, after one last, unsatisfying season on CW produced without creator Amy Sherman-Palladino and writer Daniel Palladino, most fans feared they’d seen the last of Lauren Graham and Alexis Bledel as Lorelai and Rory Gilmore. Compounding the agony was a predominant — though hardly universal — feeling that the ending was unsatisfactory, a belief that has hardened with time into immutable truth.\nNow the show is back with four 90-minute episodes, each named for one of the seasons, and all of them written by the Palladinos. You get the same stars (for the most part) and the same rapid-fire, pop-culture-infused dialogue, in a more concise package that actually serves the show well. The pace and the arch theatricality of all that chatter could grow exhausting over 22 hours — a problem clearly lessened when you only have to listen for six.\nLorelai (Lauren Graham), left, and Luke (Scott Patterson) take a walk through Stars Hollow in Netflix’s ‘Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life.’ (Photo: Saeed Adyani, Netflix)\nBrevity, however, is not the only advantage Girls has this time around. It benefits from having been gone long enough for many of us to miss it. And it returns, in all its dreamy, slightly loopy, generally optimistic lightness, at a time when many of us could use an escape, and TV could undoubtedly use a break from the grim, violent, conspiracy-laden dramas that currently dominate the landscape.\nOnce again, you’re following the Gilmores and their extended family — led by Lorelai’s on-again/off-again lover Luke (Scott Patterson) and her mother Emily (the always fabulous Kelly Bishop) — as they talk their way around the tourist trap that is Stars Hollow. Time has passed, and relationships have changed, but there’s nothing or no one fans won’t recognize and newcomers won’t be able to figure out.\nNot everyone was able to return, of course: the late Edward Herrmann is much missed, though his character, Richard, remains a heartwarming presence. A few other actors are either under- or overused: You get much less of Melissa McCarthy’s Sookie than most would like, and much more of Sean Gunn’s Kirk than some will like. But overall, the balance feels about right.\nGilmore Girls (Photo: Saeed Adyani, Netflix)\nAs always, Gilmore is not without its frustrations, which means that those who always found the constant babble and the flights of fancy unbearably twee will continue to do so. There are plots that just peter out, abruptly change course, or get lost in some eye-roll-inducing diversion. Even the combined gifts of Christian Borle and Sutton Fostercan’t quite excuse a musical sequence that defies belief and owes far too much to Christopher Guest’s parody Waiting for Guffman and Borle’s own Something Rotten .\nYet for every misstep, there’s a moment from Graham or Bledel that makes you laugh or breaks your heart, or that cuts through the cuteness to ring absolutely true. And even at its most exasperating (as with those infamous “final four words”), there is so much talent and charm on display, you’re likely to be in a forgiving mood.\nSo welcome back, Girls . Here’s hoping the wait for the next last episode is a shorter one.",

      "text": "Dillen Phelps \nStreaming boxes are all grown up. Being an adult is boring. \nWe’ve made it through the infancy of the set top box category—when we were excited just to have a way to stream anything to a TV—and through adolescence—when we hoped to make it all the way through a stream without it crashing. Let’s not discuss those terrible teens when we tried to play Angry Birds with a TV remote. \nRoku was a pioneer in set top boxes, and it’s been a favorite of mine as it took each step toward a mature product. Now, looking at Roku’s new lineup of set top boxes, I find all of them to be solid streamers than get the job done. Yawn. This is not a criticism of the products, just a reality check. \nThe past few years have seen some pretty great innovation in streaming boxes. With Roku , Apple TV, Amazon Fire TV , and Android TV , we have more options than ever. We can pick a platform that matched the rest of our digital lives, whether we’re iOS focused or Amazon Prime subscribers. Features like 4K, voice search, and faster Wifi made us eager to upgrade to get the best experience. \nWith little need for new features this year, Roku instead looked at giving people more for less. Its latest generation of products aims to provide something for every sized wallet, with six different models ranging from $30 to $130. I tested the flagship Roku Ultra and the inexpensive Roku Express . Both do what you expect for the money, but neither inspire enthusiasm. AGE OF ULTRA Photo: Roku \nWith few new features available, Roku instead created a streaming box that has just about every feature you can imagine. The $130 Roku Ultra displays 4K HDR video—that’s quadruple the resolution of HD with millions more colors. It uses fast 802.11AC Wifi, which has less congestion that 802.11N networks. It packs a quad-core processor, which means it takes a blink of the eye from the time you press the remote until you start a stream. The list goes on; it even has a digital optical output so you can connect it straight to a soundbar, because why not? \nThe result is very fast streaming experience. Channels launch quickly and streams start almost immediately. It reacts faster than last year’s Roku 4; in direct comparison, the Ultra did a better job rendering 4K video than the 4. \nThe unit’s only shortcoming is its voice search. I asked for Luke Cage , and it gave me Kate Beckinsale. Apple’s Siri and Amazon’s Alexa do a better job interpreting what I say and getting me closer to what I’m trying to find. EXPRESS YOURSELF \nThe Roku Express , the least expensive streamer you can buy, is cheap and its streams videos. What else is there to say? \nThe $30 unit also comes with a remote control, which is perfect if you don’t carry your phone at all times or just want to add a streaming box in the guest bedroom. The remote is nothing special. It feels kind of cheap and requires a direct line-of-sight to the Express (the Ultra’s remote uses Wifi so you can point it anywhere). But it works. \nFor the money you get what most people need from a streamer, including 1080p quality and access to all those Netflix channels. Several reviewers had issues with the Express being slow to load channels and displaying interface issues. I didn’t experience those, though Netflix takes about twice as long to load and start a stream as the Roku Ultra. (And by twice as long, I mean a couple of seconds.) The Ultra is really fast. It’s worth considering that the Express is slower than the latest Chromecast, which costs just $5 more—though it doesn’t come with a remote. The remote is the key here. BUYING ADVICE \nRoku remains the best streaming box for people who aren’t dedicated to Apple, Amazon, or Android, and the latest models offer a good mix of price and features. For most of us, Roku’s other products, the $50 Roku Streaming Stick or $80 Roku Premiere set top box , will be the right choice. Both are faster than the Express, but have fewer features than the Ultra. \nThe competition is keeping up. Amazon will soon release a $40 Fire TV streaming stick and Google’s got a 4K Chromecast on the way. Expect Amazon to also release a new Fire TV box before the holidays. But if you got a new streamer last year, you probably don’t need to upgrade yet. Go buy yourself a treat instead—or put it into an IRA like adults do. ",

      "title": "‘Gilmore Girls’ poll results: Rory should end up with bad boy Jess according to 54% of readers",
      "text": "13 mins ago Netflix \nSince Wednesday “ Gilmore Girls ” fans have been voting on who Rory ( Alexis Bledel ) should end up with. Of the five options in our poll, our readers have decided overwhelmingly for bad boy Jess ( Milo Ventimiglia ). Below, let’s take a closer look at the results. And no matter which way you voted you can find out right away if you got your wish by watching the Netflix revival, “A Year in the Life,” which premiered on Friday, November 25. Sign up to get Gold Derby’s free newsletter with experts’ latest predictions and breaking news \nOverwhelmingly in first place was Rory’s second boyfriend Jess with 54% of the vote. Maybe it was how Ventimiglia perfectly played the bad boy turned wise friend in later seasons. But maybe part of it was seeing the actor in full daddy mode on the Thanksgiving episode of “This Is Us” that tipped the scales in his favor. \nIn second place is the gentleman who got the closest to winning Rory’s heart during the show’s original run: Logan ( Matt Czuchry ) with 35% of your votes. Logan actually proposed to Rory near the end of the series’ original run, but she turned him down. Voters might’ve been a little hesitant to see Rory walk down the aisle before her mother, Lorelai ( Lauren Graham ). Or maybe voters remembered Lorerai’s drunken meltdown during Lane’s ( Keiko Agena ) wedding in season six and didn’t want a repeat. Dish ‘Gilmore Girls’ with Hollywood insiders in our notorious forums \nFinally, poor Dean ( Jared Padalecki ), who did nothing but love Rory, got only 6% of the vote. It appears viewers, like Rory herself, have moved on from her first relationship. Scoring lower than Dean was Rory ending up with no one, which scored 3% of the votes. Rory’s professional idol Christiane Amanpour scored just 2% of the vote. Who knew Thanksgiving was a holiday for lovers! Leave a Reply Your email address will not be published.

Netflix says two additional never before seen specials come straight out of Chappelle's personal vault. \nThis will mark Chappelle's first concert specials in 12 years since his sudden exit from \"Chappelle's Show\" in 2005. \n#1 on the charts \nRap duo Rae Sremmurd lands at the top of the Billboard Hot 100 for a consecutive week. \nIn celebration of their song \"Black Beatles\" claiming the number one spot, the group's label Interscope Records participated in the mannequin challenge. \nMany dubbed their hit song as the unofficial song for the challenge so it's only right they take a shot at it too. Money hung from the ceiling and one man is seen balancing on his head. \nCheck out the full video below. \nBruno Mars on tour \nBruno Mars isn't too far away from the top spot on the music charts. \nHis \"feel-good\" new song \"24k Magic\" comes in at number 6 on the Billboard Hot 100. \nMars will make a stop in New Orleans for his world tour on October 21, 2017. According to Live Nation, Mars sold more than a million tickets in just 24 hours. \nSome tickets to see the groovy artist sell for as much as $700. \nListen to his latest track below. \nCopyright WVUE 2016.

      "text": "November 25, 2016 7:30 am Netflix \nAfter a nearly a decade off the air, Gilmore Girls fans can now experience another year in the life of mother-daughter duo Lorelai (Lauren Graham) and Rory (Alexis Bledel)—coffee, fast-talking, romantic ups-and-downs and all. \nThe cast recnetly shared a few secrets about what fans can expect in Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life , which premieres Friday on Netflix. The cast is able to embrace how important this experience is. \nWhen Graham read the original Gilmore Girls pilot, \"it was the time I connected most strongly to a piece of material, and I was dying to do it from the first words,\" she told reporters. \"To get to do it again, to come back with a sense of appreciation for the fans and to get to be in the moment and know how lucky you are was a real treat.\" \n\"It was almost as if no time had passed,\" David Sutcliffe (Christopher) adds. \"When you're making a show, you have a lot of long hours, you don't always have an appreciation for what you're doing. It's nice to come back together and fully appreciate what the show is and what it meant to us and the fans.\" Saeed Adyani/Netflix Lauren Graham, Scott Patterson Luke (Scott Patterson) and Lorelai are together…for now. \nIn the years since fans saw the off-on couple, the duo have settled down. But avoiding certain big topics in their relationship puts them at a crossroads when the show picks up. \"We're figuring out our next steps,\" Patterson previews. \"It's a minute and day at a time. And me with my classic patience, gritting my teeth.\" \nThings were considerably smoother when Patterson first walked into Luke's Diner after all these years. \"It was spectacular,\" he says. \"It just seemed better. It seemed fresher, newer, better materials were used. It seemed bigger and better and the floors were soft. They really did a great job. Hundreds of people spent months on the sets. You walk on the sets and you see the winter, spring, summer, fall—it makes our job easier, because we believe it. This is the place, and I really feel like this guy.\" \nAnd Caesar (Aris Alvarado), Luke's ever-present chef, is still around. \"The same old same old banter with Luke,\" Alvarado says. \"The same old chemistry.\" Where will Rory's career take her? \nAs Rory figures out what she's going to do with her life, Alex Kingston's mysterious new character offers the youngest Gilmore a unique opportunity. \"My character gives Rory a run for her money,\" Kingston teases. \nRELATED: Gilmore Girls : Netflix Revival Was Like 'Seeing Old Friends Again' How will Emily (Kelly Bishop) cope without Richard (Edward Herrmann)? \nAs Emily copes with the loss of Richard—who died a few months before the revival starts; Herrmann passed away in 2014)—she'll lean on members of the DAR. \"My scenes were with Kelly Bishop; she could not have been more generous; not have been more gracious, welcoming, savvy, smart,\" says Gilmore newbie Carolyn Hennesy (Tori), who plays a member of the organization. \"And the fact that not only Emily lost her husband, but we all lost Ed Herrmann. Watching Emily and Kelly navigate those waters…it brought so much richness to her character.\" Christopher's relationships remain a struggle. \nThough Christopher's relationships with the Gilmore women has been quite the roller coaster ride over the run of the series (including his brief marriage to Lorelai in Season 7), and the revival will be no different. \"I think all of Christopher's relationships with his family, that part of his family, is always going to be a struggle,\" Sutcliffe says. Earlier in the original show's run, \"I didn't like the struggle; I wanted it to work out,\" he allows. \"But now I love it. It provokes so much feeling in people.\" \nOne minor disappoint for Sutcliffe? He wasn't in Stars Hollow. \"My [stuff] took place in another location. That was a bit of a bummer.\" The series will (finally) explore Michel's (Yanic Truesdale) personal life. \nThough the Dragonfly Inn has had some personnel changes in the past decade, Michel is \"still working with Lorelai,\" Truesdale previews. \"But he's definitely at a crossroads personally and professionally. Mainly, we'll learn much more about him, who he is [in] his personal life.\" \nRELATED: Gilmore Girls ' Yanic Truesdale on Returning to Stars Hollow Kirk (Sean Gunn) and Lulu (Rini Bell) have expanded their family. \nThough the duo are considering having a baby, in the meantime, \"there's an animal motherhood situation,\" Bell laughs. \"I didn't get to meet my animal child. I'm pretty devastated. [But] I did see my animal child and fall deeply in love because it's a pig.\" \nAnd Kirk is still hustling around Stars Hollow, taking on multiple new (and revisiting a few former) jobs in the new episodes. One particular job brings him into the Gilmore's traditional Friday night dinners. \"Kirk doesn't have a great history of going and doing what he's supposed to do,\" Gunn allows. \"You can imagine it's some sort of tomfoolery that gets him there.\" \nBut experience did allow him to share rare screen time with the Gilmore matriarch. \"That was my favorite part of it: I so rarely got to work with Kelly Bishop,\" Gunn says. \"I love her work, she's so good.\" The Life and Death Brigade is back! \nThe notorious secret Yale organization makes its presence felt in the Netflix episode. \"The only thing I'm allowed to say is the Life and Death Brigade has probably the most whimsical, wonderful, swoop in, in a storyline that has ever happened in Gilmore Girls history,\" Nick Holmes (Robert) says. \"I think the stuff we shot was just so whimsical and Gilmore and wonderful and I'm thrilled to see it myself.\" \nRELATED: Gilmore Girls : Behind the Scenes as Everyone Returns to Stars Hollow for Netflix Revival Miss Patty's (Liz Torres) girls have grown up. \nMiss Patty is still hard at work, teaching dancers in Stars Hollow, but \"the little girls grew up!\" Torres says. \"I had a class with real ballet dancers. It was like all the girls had grown up. I'm so grateful for Amy for giving me that moment.\" And though the dancers were new to the show, \"in my mind, they had grown up, and they were doing [fancy moves]. In my mind, I was so proud that she was a great teacher.\" April (Vanessa Marano) gets a decidedly less dramatic arc. \nLuke's daughter—whose existence surprised him, and led to fractures in his relationship with Lorelai—will have a controversy-free arc this go-round. \"It's all very happy,\" Marano promises. \"It's not a dramatic relationship with anybody. I want to do something happy on Gilmore Girls ! I don't want to break people up.\" \nIn the decade since the show went off the air, April has grown up, as well. \"It's funny, because the path that she is on is the path I was hoping she would be on,\" Marano says. \"She's also in a weird place, too, where you can be on the right path for you, but you're still finding yourself. That's April.\" \n\"She's some comedic relief,\" she continues. \"Which is funny, because I always felt her personality was a lot of comedic relief, but it got buried in a lot of drama, because she may or may not have been responsible for breaking up a major couple. All of that aside, she gets to be very funny, which I was excited about.\" The show's history was never too far from the cast. \nIn addition to bringing much of the cast back together (and filming on the same sets), reusing certain costumes allowed for unexpected nostalgia. \"When I got the overalls back on, I felt like no time had passed,\" Rose Abdoo, who plays mechanic Gypsy, says. \"We had a jacket that Gypsy wore, and I put my hand in the jacket and the sides from 2005 from the episode where Luke and Lorelai broke up and [the town was split]—that scene was in the pocket. That was overwhelming…To see that rolled up little script that many years later—that was an emotional moment.\" Could the show come back again? \nThough the revival will include the much teased final four words, some cast members aren't entirely convinced this is the end of our time in Stars Hollow. \"I never know what the future holds, especially these days,\" Keiko Agena (Lane)—who was there when the Stars Hollow signs were put on the set and when they were taken down— says. \"And especially because I never thought this would be possible. I know all of this love is completely unexpected and totally appreciated.\" \nGilmore Girls: A Year in the Life , now streaming Netflix Related Stories",

      "text": "by Autumn A. Arnett, Education Dive \nCoursera is shifting away from a pay-by-the-course model towards a monthly subscription plan to encourage “binge learning,” Financial Times reports. An initial pilot of the program found a 250% increase in course completion. The company’s chief product officer, who came to Coursera from Netflix, told Financial Times, “We’re not introducing a new payment model so much as a new psychological model,” saying learners are financially motivated to complete more courses faster. The new payment model will apply to any specialization area that includes six to eight courses on one subject. Prices will range from $39-$89 per month — previously, learners paid between $19-$99 per course.\nhttp://www.educationdive.com/news/coursera-embraces-netflix-subscription-model-for-course-access/430432/ \nShare on Facebook Tweet This Post \n",

      "text": "Printer-friendly version \nInternet Broadcasters like Netflix can’t be exempted from broadcast regulation, says performers’ union \nTORONTO, ON (November 25, 2016) — The Canadian union representing 23,000 performers in film and television from across the country has laid out its submission for Canadian Heritage Minister Mélanie Joly’s Canadian Content in a Digital World consultations. \n“Working with government, Canada’s creative talent has built an internationally-renowned creative sector,” said ACTRA National President Ferne Downey. “ It generates thousands of jobs and millions in economic activity, and helps shape our national identity. We have to keep building on an already successful system that continues to work in the 21st century. ” \nNational Executive Director Stephen Waddell noted that while Canada’s system of government support has led to success, the emergence of new Internet-based players have to be addressed. \n“Our system of balanced regulation has created a world-class industry — if new Internet-based broadcasters don’t have to play by the same rules, this system won’t work in the future,” said Waddell. “Netflix hauls $620 million out of the country every year without paying a dime in sales tax or having any obligation to contribute to our country’s production ecosystem. This has to change.” \nAmong its recommendations, ACTRA calls for: Maintaining core policies and putting creators at the heart of the process. The key principles of the Broadcasting Act remain maintaining a sound foundation for government audiovisual policymaking, including in the digital world. While the digital age poses new challenges, the solution is not to use less Canadian creative talent – but the opposite. We should celebrate and support Canadian creative talent and give them the tools to succeed. Bringing emerging Internet broadcasters, like Netflix, into the system so that they play by the same rules as traditional broadcasters and make the same contributions. As viewing habits change, the government must take steps to adapt our successful system to new technologies, and ensure the corporations profiting from the digital shift make fair contributions to Canadian content production. Embracing our diversity as a competitive advantage in the digital world. Canada is one of the most diverse countries in the world. We should embrace this diversity. Canada’s screen-based industries are far better positioned to tackle inequality in the recorded media industries than any other country in the world. \nACTRA (Alliance of Canadian Cinema, Television and Radio Artists) is the national union of professional performers working in the English-language recorded media in Canada. ACTRA represents the interests of 23,000 members across the country – the foundation of Canada’s highly-acclaimed professional performing community.

      "text": "“Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life” four-part series debuts on Netflix HV By Haley Velasco - 25 November 2016 21:40pm “Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life” four-part series debuts on Netflix \nAs the US cleaned up turkeys and went Black Friday shopping , Netflix released its four-part “Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life.” Released at 3:01 a.m. Friday, the four 90-minute episodes, which were broke down into fall, winter, spring and summer, had many glued to their couches with their Pop Tarts, cups of coffee and streaming subscription. \nOne of the most anticipated arrivals —16 years after the premiere of the first episode on October 5, 2000 — has had much fanfare around it since the announcement that Rory, Lorelei and the rest of the cast would make their return to the screen. \nBeginning with teasers that captured everything from season recaps to the announcement that Netflix was to expand “Gilmore Girls” internationally on July 1, to sneak peeks from the actors, to countdowns, fans were transported to Stars Hollow, just like they were watching the original season all those years ago. \nTo keep the momentum going heading into the revival, Netflix created Luke’s Diner in over 200 coffee shops to transport visitors to the show’s fictional Stars Hollow on the show’s anniversary on October 5. Giving out free coffee from 7 am to 12 pm, visitors grabbed a free cup with Luke’s sleeve, as well as were met with Luke cutouts, menus and more. \nAdditionally, the quaint town that the show is based on, Washington, Connecticut opened its doors to fans from October 21-23 for its Fan Fest. With screenings of a collection of past Gilmore Girls episodes, a Friday night dinner, tea at a local inn, dance recitals, book readings, and even a knit-a-thon, fans got to experience their favorite parts of the town with several cast members including Kelly Bishop (Emily), Jackson Douglas (Jackson), Yanic Truesdale (Michel), and Vanessa Marano (April). Playing along with the show’s storyline and its addiction to coffee, according to the festival’s event description, they worked to “provide as much caffeine as possible.” \nMany years in the making, series creator Amy Sherman-Palladino, who left the series before the seventh season, as teased the last four words of the series that she never had the chance to see lived out. Building up the anticipation of the proper show’s ending, viewers now have their answer. \nSPOILER AHEAD",

      "text": "Patrick O'Rourke \nNovember 25, 2016 12:38pm \nArguments that Netflix should be regulated by the CRTC have been swirling in one form or another for several years now, particularly since the service continues to grow in popularity. The streaming service, however, claims that it already makes substantial investments in Canadian content on its platform and that regulation is not necessary. \nOn Thursday, Netflix filed a new submission to the Canadian Heritage’s public consultation on homegrown content. The filing comes two years after Netflix first told the CRTC that it does not believe its service falls under the Canadian Broadcasting Act since the company doesn’t operate like a traditional broadcaster. While there’s merit to Netflix’s argument given that the company delivers its content via the internet, the platform has grown to hold a significant presence in Canada since its initial launch back in 2010. \nIn an interview with The Canadian Press , Elizabeth Bradley, vice-president of content at Netflix, said, “We want to continue to invest in content in Canada in the way we have, which means continuing to spend money but not under a system that’s similar to the Canadian broadcasters, where there’s regulation and paying into the Canada Media Fund.” \nIf Netflix were under the Canadian Broadcasting Act, the company would be required to make specific financial commitments to Canadian content. Netflix, however, states that it has already made significant investments in Canadian content, despite not being forced to do so under the Canadian Broadcasting Act. \nExamples of Netflix content with Canadian involvement include Alias Grace and Anne, a remake of Anne of Green Gables that Netflix and the CBC will simulcast. The Trailer Park Boys , a true Canadian classic, is another example of Netflix’s efforts in Canada, along with Travellers , Frontier and Degrassi: The Next Class . \nNetflix claims that in 2016 it has commissioned hundreds of millions of dollars of original programming in Canada, with “dozens of commitments” in 2016 for Netflix original movies and TV series that will be produced in Canada. Source The Canadian Press byron blackmore \nIt should be regulated but I don’t think the regulations should require them to be much more invested than they are right now. Gewurttraminer \nWhy then do they need to be regulated? There is nothing wrong with the way things are now and you seem to be advocating for a solution to a problem that doesn’t exist. Vito R. \nEither they are a traditional broadcaster under CRTC’s definition or their not. Considering it was just determined that Vmedia ISN’T because they deliver content via the Internet (actually, not sure how relevant that actually is) then I would think Netflix isn’t as well. \nHowever, if they ARE considered a broadcaster then they need to follow the same rules and collect tax. It’s not a big deal if they say they are already paying contributing their share to Canadian content. Don’t worry, Netflix isn’t going anywhere. \nThat said, I’d be fine if they removed the Canadian content rules all together – but while we still have them I think everyone should abide by the same rules (if applicable). AlanStrangis \nI’m all for reasonable Can-Con rules, and don’t think Netflix interferes with them at all. \nThey’re making Canadian productions more viable, as they work WITH broadcasters to produce shows that might not get off the ground otherwise. As they point out, Netflix currently has 5 or six co-pros with Canadian broadcasters. \nBy doing a Netflix co-production, it gives the broadcaster some extra breathing room budget-wise, while expanding the audience beyond the tiny Canadian market. Netflix actually helps level the playing field in this way, by allowing broadcasters to step outside of their “safe zones”.If Netflix gets value of making such shows by partnering with domestic broadcasters, like Frontiers (which is a bigger risk than another DeGrassi, or TPB, or Anne of Green Gables), while being able to present them to a global audience, all the better. Vito R. \nI like Netflix as much as the next guy, but the rules are the rules. Frankly, I don’t consider Netflix a “broadcaster” so I don’t think these rules apply to them. \nIf they ARE considered a “broadcaster” by whatever metrics are used to determine that then I think they should abide by the same rules as the other “broadcasters”. I would even be fine loosening the rules for all broadcasters – but it should be noted that it *will* have a negative impact on the Canadian TV & movie industry. Gewurttraminer \nWell basically you post a comment I agree with so no argument there. I don’t think they should be considered a broadcaster either and really they aren’t as no Internet entertainment provider is nor should be. Further regulation, particularly of Internet content is not needed and certainly not welcomed. Jordan \nIt’s only a matter of time before Netflix leaves Canada altogether.. but yes, let’s keep pushing them to be more “Canadian”. Why is Canada so busy trying to make more Canadian content and not with making the Canadian economy better that would benefit many more Canadians.. Vito R. \nIf Netflix invested more in Canada it would make the economy better. AlanStrangis \nJust as the list in the article shows, Netflix is doing a LOT to fund Canadian productions. Vito R. \nAre they? Can you tell me how much they are funding relative to their size and income and how it compares to Bell & Rogers? Dr. \nCanCon needs to die – it’s the only reason Avril Levigne has a career and it needs to stop. Leave Netflix out of it and let us watch in peace. Ryan \nAgree. When I think of “Canadian” shows like Corner Gas, Trailer Park Boys or whatever new show the CBC is trying to push…none of them are appealing to me as a 20 something. The shows I like are US produced, and I don’t have patriotism for forced investment in Canadian focused shows. If it’s good, I’ll watch it. Gewurttraminer \nThe truth is that shows like Corner Gas and Trailer Park Boys are really total crap compared to any U.S. produced show, whatever the genre. I never understood the appeal of a show like TPB because after a couple seasons it gets stale watching the same characters get liquored up, do drugs and generally glorify the lazy/do nothing lifestyle it promotes.

      "title": "Gilmore Girls' Lauren Graham and Alexis Bledel tell us if season 8 on Netflix is the final farewell",
      "text": "We heart Gilmore Girls and, at long last, the wait almost over: their hotly-anticipated four-part feature-length comeback is now streaming on Netflix. Season seven divided fans, when new writers took the show in a different (and unwelcome) direction. But now original creator and showrunner Amy Sherman-Palladino is back (yay!), and the stars promise we'll finally get the answers we want. But what's in store for Lorelai and Alexis? Will they get their happy endings? Far away from Stars Hollow, Digital Spy went to Berlin to catch up with Lauren Graham and Alexis Bledel, who revealed all about crying on set, working harder than Rob Lowe and whether this new mini-series could pave the way for more episodes… Were you worried about rekindling the magic? Lauren: My only concern was that I just wanted it to be so good and worth it. There was pressure, and during all these conversations with Amy she just had note cards, there were no scripts. So we were negotiating contracts and even though I was pretty sure the show would be good, I hadn't read anything. But I liked the idea of a mini-series – I grew up with TV events, like five night specials, and it seemed appropriate. Alexis: We've been talking about bringing the show back for years. I think the characters were still very much alive for Amy and she felt she didn't get to end the show properly. We were talking about maybe doing a movie but then when Netflix came along a younger audience discovered the show, and it seemed more viable. The more I knew about the story Amy wanted to tell, the more excited I became. Did it take long to find Lorelai and Rory again? Alexis: It wasn't hard to jump back in because the writing is so distinct, it's very clear how it should be performed. Lauren: It was instant – I'd been dying to return to Lorelai and I'd missed the series. When I finally did read that first page I was like, \"Ah OK, this feels exactly the same, it's just the old show.\" So totes emosh, then? Lauren: I'm not a super emotional person but everything made me cry, it was just so moving. There were so many interesting, crazy, magical, strange things happening on set and I couldn't believe we were there after talking about it for so long. Just being back on that lot, in a place I spent so many hours. People who work there remembered us from the first time because we were always the last people on set. We filmed alongside The West Wing and Aaron Sorkin shows are known for having the worst hours ever, they go on and on, but we were always there even after they had gone home, because you couldn't change a word of the script. The fans are so excited to see new episodes. Did you ever worry about letting them down? Alexis: It's very rewarding that people like the series. When you start work on a new TV show you don't know if anyone will like it and you're nervous, but now we're nervous about fulfilling people's expectations. It's a much nicer thing to be worried about though, because we know people love the characters, so you're moving toward a warm reception already. It's a lovely experience. Season seven divided fans – were you unhappy with it? Alexis: It definitely felt different because Amy's voice is so unique and can't be replicated. Luckily we had established our characters over 6 years, so it didn't leave us completely aimless, but it just wasn't quite the same. Lauren: When we started having this conversation there was no reboot trend, even though they're bringing back everything now. But I always felt we had good reason to return because we didn't have Amy in the 7th season, and even then we didn't know that the last episode was the end. Rory's living in London now – did you come to the UK, Alexis? Alexis: No, we filmed everything in California, but it would have been nice to come to London! I was filming with Alex Kingston, who is amazing and she made those scenes really funny. Rory works so hard, she's flailing when we pick up, but I talked to Amy about my desire to see her really succeed. Rory inspired so many young women to get the best education and job they could. Now she's trying to create the right kind of balance in her professional and personal life, which is a realistic crossroads at her stage of life, especially for someone so ambitious. Edward Herrmann, who played Lorelai's dad Richard Gilmore, has sadly passed away since you last filmed, and we see the character's funeral on screen. That must have been tough to film? Lauren: It was so hard because it's real for us. I think the whole show was emotional, because we wanted it to honour his memory. It's hard not to have him there because he absolutely loved the series. Alexis: Amy honoured him really well, integrating his loss into the story and making it a catalyst for all the characters to experience significant change. We've waited so long for you to come back. Tell us this isn't the end! Alexis: The idea was for Amy to get the chance to conclude the story the way she always wanted to. I certainly feel we answer a lot of questions in this and we are delivering things to fans that maybe they wanted and didn't get from the season seven finale. So it feels conclusive but I suppose anything is possible, and I don't have any expectations either way. Lauren: It's hard to say. I'll be curious when all the episodes are out because this feels like such a grassroots thing – the people brought Gilmore Girls back so I think it's up to the people if they think the ending feels satisfying enough. If it does I wouldn't want to touch it. To me it ends in a really satisfying way that could also continue… so I guess we'll see. Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life is now available to stream exclusively on Netflix.",

      "text": "sharethis 11/25/16 6:30pm \nSteven Avery, subject of the Netflix documentary \"Making a Murderer\" has been given the opportunity to conduct scientific testing on the evidence (mainly blood) used to convict him of the 2005 murder of Teresa Halbach, USA Today reports. \nThe entire documentary raised so many disturbing questions, from watching how Avery was wrongly convicted of a rape he didn't commit and forced to serve 18 years in prison to the circumstances of his second case, a murder, which was pinned on him the day he was set to receive a massive settlement from Manitowoc County. Nothing seemed right, yet all every judge, lawyer and detective seemed to be conspiring against him. \nAvery’s current lawyer, Kathleen Zellner, reports that this past Wednesday, the day before Thanksgiving, an agreement was reached authorizing independent scientific testing on the critical pieces of evidence to determine whether there was tampering or planting. Some of the evidence in question are the various blood spots in the Halbach's car, which Avery claims were taken from a blood vial being held by the police dept and the lack of fingerprints on Halbach's car key. \nEarlier this month there were developments in Brendan Dassey, Avery's nephew and co-defendant in the Halbach murder. He was granted release pending a retrial, but a federal appeals court blocked his release. The circumstances of his conviction were even more shocking to viewers of the documentary as they showed Dassey's own lawyer conspiring to get him convicted, massive manipulation by the detectives handling the case and a shocking disregard for his low IQ and diminished functioning. \nIt will be interesting to see if this will once and for all exonerate Avery and Dassey from the crime. After Avery's release from prison for the rape, he chose to stay in Manitowoc County. My recommendation, if he is released, would be to move as far away as possible.",

If you don’t feel like reading it, and I don’t suggest you do because it’s tripe, the gist is that the author is super interesting and adventurous and not a lame boring person who likes to watch TV. She makes a long list of requests and suggestions for how a partner can keep up with her special self. I found it positively adorable… like oh bless your heart sweet pea, you are like twenty two and so cute and have no idea that in 10 more years, your relationship will be boring like the rest of ours. The comments are fantastic too– in particular I enjoyed “In 55 years, your horde of cats will devour your corpse when you die miserable and alone” which made me laugh out loud and wake up the baby on my chest.

      "text": "Lauren Graham and Alexis Bledel (Credit: Netflix) More Today is the day Netflix unveils all four new episodes of Gilmore Girls , collectively known as Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life . I’ve already written a spoiler-free, overall review of the quartet of Stars Hollow specials, but beginning today I will write one review a day, for the next four days, of each individual episode. Today’s review is of “Winter.” You are hereby and loudly warned: WALL-TO-WALL SPOILERS OF GILMORE GIRLS: A YEAR IN THE LIFE FOLLOW . Grab a mug of coffee and some Tater Tots.\nCreator Amy Sherman-Palladino, who wrote and directed this episode, knows how to transport us back to the Gilmore Girls circa 2005-06, aka the Last Real Gilmore Girls Era. Before, that is, the well-intentioned but generally misconceived Sherman-Palladino-less seventh season. And the way to do that immediate transportation in the Netflix series is via the lovely “la-la-la”s of Sam Phillips on the soundtrack, as a camera pans across the town square of Stars Hollow to settle on Lauren Graham’s Lorelai Gilmore, bundled against the cold, coffee in her mittened hands. She’s soon joined by Alexis Bledel’s Rory, who, now at age 32, is leading the wastrel freelancer’s life and finds it difficult to pick up cellphone reception in Stars Hollow — “the town we constructed in a giant snow globe,” says Lorelai, in what I’ll assume doubles as a Sherman-Palladino reference to the finale of St. Elsewhere .\nIndeed, the pop-culture references fly fast and furiously, with Lorelai and Rory getting off a rapid-fire set of them upon first hugging hello, just so we can relax and be confident that Graham and Bledel still have the chops to handle Sherman-Palladino’s unique mixture of His Girl Friday -meets-Gwyneth Paltrow frame of reference. (Early on, one of those compulsive name-droppings takes on unexpected added poignance when a joke is made about Lane’s husband, Zack, resembling “a young Leonard Cohen.”)\nAnd so it zings along. Lena Dunham, Gail Collins, John McPhee , Ben Affleck, and The Sopranos go into the Gilmore blender along with scores more; the air is thick with snow and the Zeitgeist. In the initial seasons of Gilmore Girls, it was a constant surprise to hear so many real-life names, historical events, and brand-name foods stuffed into any given hour — a happy surprise for fans, and a puzzlement for anyone benighted enough to be able to resist the show’s methodology.\nThe “Winter” episode takes full advantage of its 90-minute length to reestablish certain core elements. Luke (Scott Patterson) is still backward-baseball-cap-wearing Luke, still cranky in his café. (He has the added crank of contending with layabout customers nursing half a cup of java while bleating at him for his Wi-Fi password, which he invents willy-nilly, just to thwart them.) The small town is still dense with familiar eccentrics, and this episode shines a particular spotlight on Sean Gunn’s Kirk, whose latest crack-brained business idea is his own variation on Uber called (I’m trying to reproduce this phonetically here) h-ber, which consists of you calling Kirk’s mom, who’ll then call him, and he’ll pick you up in whatever vehicle is at hand in the moment. It’s ridiculous; it’s sublime.\nGilmore Girls is not Gilmore Girls , however, without a certain amount of tension, and Amy S-P provides three crackling electric eels to jolt our beloved mother and daughter. First is Rory’s current life status: Single, unemployed, and not doing all that well in either of these categories. She had a “Talk of the Town” piece published in The New Yorker — my guess is that it was at least a year or two earlier — and she’s been trying to ride that impressive surge in professional recognition into regular employment of some sort: more assignments, or a book project, or a staff job somewhere. Gotta say I feel for Rory, that she’s spent the years we’ve been Gilmore -less trying to get further along; given what a golden academic life she led, we ought to think that her current situation must be depressing for her. Especially since everyone in Stars Hollow keeps talking about that damn “Talk of the Town” piece! Luke’s even laminated it onto the back of the cafe menu! I firmly believe that Lorelai would have/should have talked him out of this — she, of all people, would know how heavily this must weigh upon Rory.\nRelated: Gilmore Girls: A Journey Through Lorelai’s Love Life\nRead More Speaking of Lorelai and Luke: They’re living together, and Lorelai is wondering whether she and Luke should have a child — via surrogacy (Stars Hollow is a magical place, but it can’t perform ovarian miracles). This subplot reintroduces Liza Weil and Paris, as sleek as though she’d just stepped off the How to Get Away With Murder soundstage, which she probably did, with Paris now the boss of a high-profile surrogacy clinic in Manhattan.\nThis is not the profession I’d have pegged Paris to pursue, but I’ll go with it, especially because it enables Amy S-P to write many funny jokes about “breeders” and elicits some of Scott Patterson’s best comic acting when he’s confused about whether or not he’s supposed to have one-on-one sex with each surrogate.\nFinally: Emily Gilmore. The entire quartet of new episodes is heavy with the memory of the late Richard Gilmore, who was played by the late Edward Herrmann. The new Gilmore s play this death for everything it deserves, which is a lot. Herrmann’s performance was an anchor for the series, and not because he was the strongest — most rooted; most comfortable in his own skin — male figure that Amy S-P created. Certainly Kelly Bishop’s Emily matched Richard when it came to strength of character and will.\nBut this show went all-in on the perhaps now-unfashionable idea that daughters can relate to their fathers in a different way than they do with their mothers. In this case, Richard was quicker to forgive and more overtly eager to reestablish regular contact with Lorelai when the series first began. (Emily was too, but she held onto her reservations/grudges more stubbornly and kept that particular yearning for mother-daughter kinship pushed down, in the great WASP tradition.) His death left a huge hole in the lives of Emily and Lorelai in particular. (Rory, having always enjoyed an unconflicted relationship with her grandfather, passed through the stages of grief with more serenity.) And that hole will not be entirely filled — even by the gigantic portrait of Richard commissioned by Emily that inspires one of this episode’s best testy exchanges. The Richard-less Emily is at once adrift and in flux; numb with sadness, unmoored in what has always been a balanced life, she tries to find some solace in changing her immediate surroundings. She falls for the fad of “de-cluttering” her house, an impeccable setup for the moment in which Amy S-P takes full advantage of being on Netflix: the sight of prim Emily in jeans and a T-shirt, an outfit so shockingly unthinkable that Lorelai reacts with a barely suppressed, “Holy s***!”\n“Winter” takes us back four months, to Richard’s funeral, and explores the different ways people express grief. Emily is able to keep up a brave front while breaking inside; Lorelai is cracking, self-medicating with booze, and she (as Richard would put it) lets down the side by telling an awfully inappropriate — in part because it is so uncharacteristically banal for her — anecdote at the funeral reception that tears open the wound between mother and daughter yet again.\nThat the episode ends with Emily deciding she’ll see a therapist, and tricking Lorelai into coming along, sends A Year in the Life aloft with the best sort of beginning.\nExtra Gilmore Gifts:\nRay Wise appearing as Richard’s old pal from Yale made me wonder momentarily whether Sherman-Palladino was setting up a Twin Peaks joke. Revelation of the episode: Emily has never met Kirk before now!!! Lane, Zack, and the band Hep Alien execute a killer cover of Joe Jackson’s “I’m the Man” in a show that exalts women above all. Best insult: Emily referring to Stars Hollow as being composed of “carnies and misfits.” Best line-reading: Lauren Graham biting down hard on the words, “You’re horrible!” Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life is streaming now on Netflix.",

      "text": "Netflix 4K Playback on PC Locked to Edge Browser, Latest Intel CPU, Due to DRM Posted by: Sean F , 16:07 AEDT, Sat November 26, 2016 Image/Photo Credit: YayAdrian @ Flickr, CC \nPC users who have entered the 4K age for gaming may still have to purchase expensive hardware upgrades in order to stream Netflix at Ultra HD resolution. Microsoft announced this week that Netflix's 4K streaming, previously limited to 4K TVs and compatible Ultra HD Blu-ray players, is coming to PCs at long last. But the hardware and software requirements listed will ensure most users won't be able to streaming in 4K, as it force users to use a browser almost nobody users, and the latest Intel CPU only launched in August. Hollywood's insistence on DRM, unfortunately, is to blame. Netflix 4K on Windows PCs require the DRM platform PlayReady 3.0. This straight away limits users to use Windows 10, as PlayReady 3.0 was just introduced in to the OS in the recent Anniversary Update. This also forces users to use Microsoft's little used Edge browser, as it's the only browser that supports PlayReady 3.0 at the moment (Netflix's own Windows app doesn't work either). PlayReady 3.0 is also a hardware based DRM, meaning that only hardware that supports the new DRM standard will work with Netflix 4K. This then limits users to latest Intel 'Kaby Lake' processors, the only Intel processors to currently support PlayReady 3.0. Nvidia's latest 10-series graphics cards support PlayReady 3.0, but is currently not compatible with Netflix/Microsoft's implementation (this may change with a software update in the future). PCs that don't meet all of these requirements will be prevented from playing Netflix in 4K, even if the hardware is powerful enough to do so. \nIt's also worth noting that it's not Netflix that's putting these requirements into play, but rather rights-holders such as Hollywood studios that force Netflix to adopt these hardline requirements on DRM. Apart from DRM requirements, there is also a performance advantage of using the latest 'Kaby Lake' processors for Netflix 4K. These latest CPUs are the only ones capable of providing hardware accelerated decoding support for 10-bit HEVC, the video encoding format that Netflix 4K uses. The previous generation Intel CPUs only support accelerated 8-bit decoding. Users not keen on jumping through these DRM hoops are advised to use a $99 Chromecast Ultra device with their 4K monitor to get your Netflix 4K fix.",

      "text": "0 Amanda Kerr \nLooking to keep the warm and fuzzy feelings of Thanksgiving going through the holiday weekend? Well, if a tasty helping of early 2000s nostalgia and quality mother-daughter bonding warms your heart, then you’re in luck! \nNetflix is reprising the hit TV series Gilmore Girls with a four-part miniseries Gilmore Girls: A year in the Life debuting on Nov. 25, 2016. Want even better news? CofC alum Matt Czuchry ’99 will be rejoining the cast as Logan Huntzberger, the former love interest of the younger Gilmore Girl, Rory. His return to Stars Hollow follows Czuchry’s successful turn portraying ambitious, young lawyer Cary Agos on the CBS drama The Good Wife from 2009 to 2016. \nRELATED: Read about Matt Czuchry’s journey to television stardom in College of Charleston Magazine . \nCzuchry originally portrayed media heir Huntzberger from 2004 to 2007. In the lead up to the series finale, Czuchry’s character proposed to Rory Gilmore only to be rejected. The Netflix reprisal picks up nearly 10 years later – and the question on everyone’s mind is whether Logan and Rory will reunite. Czuchry recently told reporters with Entertainment Tonight that he’s been sworn to secrecy until the new episodes premiere. So, we’ll have to wait and see.",

      "text": "Close The Associated Press \nThis image released by Netflix shows Lauren Graham, left, and Alexis Bledel in a scene from, \"Gilmore Girls: A Year In The Life,\" premiering Friday on Netflix. Q&A with 'Gilmore Girls' stars: Dynamic duo are back again Yvonne Villarreal Los Angeles Times 17 hrs ago 0 The Associated Press \nThis image released by Netflix shows Lauren Graham, left, and Alexis Bledel in a scene from, \"Gilmore Girls: A Year In The Life,\" premiering Friday on Netflix. \nTheirs is a love story of Mallomars and \"Billy Jack\" viewings; of dance marathons and mandatory family dinners; of coffee and, well, more coffee. \nLorelai and Rory Gilmore are the duo at the center of \"Gilmore Girls.\" \nTogether they redefined mothers and daughters as besties — the kind that talk in a cadence that doesn't leave room for much breathing. Basically, where one would lead, the other would follow. \nThe dynamic relationship, brought to life by Lauren Graham and Alexis Bledel, is making a return in a way that would surely incite witty pop culture commentary from Lorelai and Rory: as a four-part revival for Netflix, which starts today. \nWe spoke with Graham and Bledel about reprising their career-defining characters. \nQ: Creator Amy Sherman-Palladino has said that she's known the final four words of \"Gilmore Girls\" since 2006, when she left the show ahead of the seventh and final season. Fans are eager to finally hear them. Did you realize this was a thing? \nGraham: I did not know that that was a thing. I did not know what they were or that they existed until filming this, which is weird. Amy was like, \"You do not know what they are?\" I was like, \"I don't know, this missed me somehow.\" There is a lot of story leading up to that, so of course it is a fun journey getting there. Maybe the four words will become a hashtag. Who knows? \nQ: What do you think about the fact that we live in a world today where something like this revival is possible? \nGraham: It is incredible. The fact that we got a chance to revisit these characters all these years later, it's amazing. I think it is a great thing that people can tell stories in just the way they want to tell it, because these online platforms are available to do that. These 90-minute installments are the perfect way for Amy and (fellow \"Gilmore\" executive producer and Sherman-Palladino's husband) Dan to work. A 60-minute episode is just not enough for all that they have to offer. \nQ: What do you remember about reading the original pilot and the world that Amy had created? \nBledel: It really stood out from other pilots and scripts that I had read because it just seemed very contained. It was a very distinct world that she created, and all the characters in it seemed real, and they seemed like they belonged there. My character, I remember, was so different from any character that was on TV. I remember there was a show called \"Popular\" on TV where girls were, I don't know, really stylish and all about the looks and sometimes very mean. Very opposite of Rory. I thought, \"This is so great and different.\" \nGraham: I was like, \"Get out of my way, this is mine.\" I felt that way very seldom in my life, where I am like, \"It is as if somebody wrote this for me, but how is that possible she does not even know me?\" It was a very intense connection, and at the time, not only was Rory an unusual character, but there were not that many single parents on TV. All my actress friends said, \"Aren't you afraid to play a mom? That will put you in a different category.\" I was like, \"This character, one of the 10 things she is is a mom.\" She is this person that I connect to. The whole point of this story is having this child young, so the usual things I might have worried about just did not even occur to me. \nQ: What was it like doing that first table read for the new episodes? \nGraham: The table read was insane. We had not seen each other. We walked in that room, and there is just so much energy and expectation, and I thought, \"Do I still ... wait, do I know how to do this?\" \"I know how to do this. I can still do this.\" Then it comes out of your mouth, because we had not said it out loud. You do not have to audition for your old part back. Then, it just settles in. \nBledel: I remember being most panicked or stressed before the big scenes: the first scene, the last scene. Then, because it was a finite story with these installments, I knew that there were also some scenes that I really wanted to be present for, get right. A limited number of them that had all the things I wanted to do in the character. I thought the table read was pretty energizing, pretty nerve-racking. We had a lot of new faces; with Netflix being a part of it. \nQ: How was it getting through a 90-minute episode, dialogue-wise? \nBledel: A lot of water was needed. But it felt the same. (Laughs.)

      "text": "Chris Polk via Getty Images Dave Chappelle is coming back with three Netflix specials. Fresh off his stint as host of “ Saturday Night Live ,” Dave Chappelle appears to be finally ready to give the people what they want.\nNetflix announced Monday that the company has ordered up three new Chappelle comedy specials.\n“Dave Chappelle is a legendary voice in comedy — searing, vital, and now more than ever, essential,” Lisa Nishimura, Netflix’s vice president of original documentary and comedy, said in a statement issued Monday. “Dave’s three new specials promise to be some of the most anticipated events in comedy.”\nThe shows ― one of which will reportedly be a Netflix original special, and two of which will come from past performances at Austin City Limits Live and the Hollywood Palladium ― will constitute his first TV specials in 12 years, after the comedian largely disappeared from the public eye at the height of his celebrity. The two already-recorded specials will be released simultaneously in 2017.\nNews: 3 new Dave Chappelle comedy specials, coming soon. pic.twitter.com/OzrDukBPk6\n— Netflix US (@netflix) November 21, 2016 The news comes just over a month after Netflix announced that it had ordered two specials from Chris Rock, and the company will reportedly pay Rock a total of $40 million . The dollar amount shocked the comedy world when it was first announced, but it is indicative of a mission that regards original programming as vital to future success. The company announced in October that it would spend $6 billion in 2017 on content, more than NBC and CBS.\nNetflix has also released comedy specials by comedians including Aziz Ansari and Patton Oswalt, the latter of which earned an Emmy this year.\nAlso on HuffPost: 12 Highest-Rated Movies on Netflix 12 Highest-Rated Movies on Netflix 1 of 12 \"Reservoir Dogs\" (1992) (IMDB: 8.4) A bunch of dudes are super terrible at stealing diamonds.

      "text": "Jeremy Clarkson Denies Netflix's Claim That Amazon Spent $250 Million on 'The Grand Tour' Updated: November 25, 2016 — 4:07 PM EST Share Reuters \nBy Todd Spangler \nLOS ANGELES (Variety.com) - The war of words between Netflix and Amazon shifted into a new gear this week. \nJeremy Clarkson, one of the hosts of Amazon's \"The Grand Tour\" globe-trotting auto show, disputed the claim by one of Netflix's senior execs that the e-retailer paid a whopping $250 million for the series. \"The Grand Tour\" reunites Clarkson with his fellow \"Top Gear\" co-hosts, Richard Hammond and James May. The BBC fired Clarkson from the popular show following allegations that he assaulted a producer. \n\"Amazon spent far less than Netflix would have you believe,\" Clarkson said in an interview published Wednesday with CNN. \"It's nowhere near as expensive as people have been saying.\" \nHe was responding to a claim by Netflix chief content officer Ted Sarandos, who said in an interview with the Telegraph newspaper earlier this week that Amazon paid far more than the previously reported $160 million for the 12-episode series. \n\"That's an under-reported number,\" said Sarandos, who acknowledged that Netflix had bid for the show. \"It was about a quarter of a billion dollars.\" \nIn the CNN interview, Clarkson said that \"of course\" he knew what Amazon is spending on \"The Grand Tour,\" but declined to reveal the figure: \"It's just not a British thing,\" he said, adding, \"I mean, look at me. Do I look like I'm making $300 million a year?\" \nThis past Monday, Amazon said \"Grand Tour\" broke Prime Video records after the first episode's Nov. 18 premiere among members in the U.S., U.K., Germany, Austria and Germany. The company didn't provide specific numbers except to say \"millions\" of users streamed the episode over the opening weekend, beating Prime Video's previous record-holder, \"The Man in the High Castle.\" \nAmazon last year announced a deal with the three former \"Top Gear\" hosts for a new show produced by the trio's longtime executive producer, Andy Wilman. According to Amazon, on Nov. 18 when \"The Grand Tour\" debuted, total new Prime membership signups exceeded all previous days with the exception of Amazon's Prime Day, when it has offered special discounts. \nNetflix, meanwhile, has reportedly acquired streaming rights to the BBC's revamped \"Top Gear\" with Matt LeBlanc. In the Telegraph interview, Sarandos tried to cast doubt on how successful \"Grand Tour\" would be: \"It'll be interesting with 'Grand Tour' to see how much of that is the players, who in many cases are big personalities, but what elements of 'Top Gear' will people miss?\" he said. \nAmazon has said \"The Grand Tour\" will be available to stream in 200 countries worldwide in December -- leading to speculation that the ecommerce giant will also be launching Prime Video in a global challenge to Netflix. To date, Amazon has not confirmed its plans for international expansion beyond its current Prime Video footprint, although it quietly launched the service in Australia last week. \n\"Grand Tour\" -- which Clarkson dubbed \"'Top Gear' in witness protection\" -- is the highest-rated TV show or movie by users on Amazon-owned IMDb. It currently has an overall rating of 9.6 out of 10 stars based on more than 13,000 ratings. It also currently has an audience score of 98% on Rotten Tomatoes. \nIn Amazon's \"Grand Tour,\" Clarkson, Hammond and May host the show from a traveling tent in locations around the world including Johannesburg, California, Scotland, Rotterdam, Lapland, Nashville, Whitby in North Yorkshire, Stuttgart and Dubai. \nThe first episode kicked off in California, when the trio set up camp at Dry Rabbit Lake in the Mojave Desert near Lucerne Valley, outside of L.A. There, they staged a \"Burning Van\" festival for thousands of fans, which was featured in the series opener.

      "text": "Jeremy Clarkson Denies Netflix's Claim That Amazon Spent $250 Million on 'The Grand Tour' Updated: November 25, 2016 — 1:01 PM EST Share Variety Media, LLC \nBy Todd Spangler \nLOS ANGELES (Variety.com) - The war of words between Netflix and Amazon shifted into a new gear this week. \nJeremy Clarkson, one of the hosts of Amazon's \"The Grand Tour\" globe-trotting auto show, disputed the claim by one of Netflix's senior execs that the e-retailer paid a whopping $250 million for the series. \"The Grand Tour\" reunites Clarkson with his fellow \"Top Gear\" co-hosts, Richard Hammond and James May. The BBC fired Clarkson from the popular show following allegations that he assaulted a producer. \n\"Amazon spent far less than Netflix would have you believe,\" Clarkson said in an interview published Wednesday with CNN. \"It's nowhere near as expensive as people have been saying.\" \nHe was responding to a claim by Netflix chief content officer Ted Sarandos, who said in an interview with the Telegraph newspaper earlier this week that Amazon paid far more than the previously reported $160 million for the 12-episode series. \n\"That's an under-reported number,\" said Sarandos, who acknowledged that Netflix had bid for the show. \"It was about a quarter of a billion dollars.\" \nIn the CNN interview, Clarkson said that \"of course\" he knew what Amazon is spending on \"The Grand Tour,\" but declined to reveal the figure: \"It's just not a British thing,\" he said, adding, \"I mean, look at me. Do I look like I'm making $300 million a year?\" \nThis past Monday, Amazon said \"Grand Tour\" broke Prime Video records after the first episode's Nov. 18 premiere among members in the U.S., U.K., Germany, Austria and Germany. The company didn't provide specific numbers except to say \"millions\" of users streamed the episode over the opening weekend, beating Prime Video's previous record-holder, \"The Man in the High Castle.\" \nRelated Amazon's 'The Grand Tour' Leaves 'Top Gear' in the Dust, British TV Critics Say \nAmazon last year announced a deal with the three former \"Top Gear\" hosts for a new show produced by the trio's longtime executive producer, Andy Wilman. According to Amazon, on Nov. 18 when \"The Grand Tour\" debuted, total new Prime membership signups exceeded all previous days with the exception of Amazon's Prime Day, when it has offered special discounts. \nNetflix, meanwhile, has reportedly acquired streaming rights to the BBC's revamped \"Top Gear\" with Matt LeBlanc. In the Telegraph interview, Sarandos tried to cast doubt on how successful \"Grand Tour\" would be: \"It'll be interesting with 'Grand Tour' to see how much of that is the players, who in many cases are big personalities, but what elements of 'Top Gear' will people miss?\" he said. \nAmazon has said \"The Grand Tour\" will be available to stream in 200 countries worldwide in December -- leading to speculation that the ecommerce giant will also be launching Prime Video in a global challenge to Netflix. To date, Amazon has not confirmed its plans for international expansion beyond its current Prime Video footprint, although it quietly launched the service in Australia last week. \n\"Grand Tour\" -- which Clarkson dubbed \"'Top Gear' in witness protection\" -- is the highest-rated TV show or movie by users on Amazon-owned IMDb. It currently has an overall rating of 9.6 out of 10 stars based on more than 13,000 ratings. It also currently has an audience score of 98% on Rotten Tomatoes. \nIn Amazon's \"Grand Tour,\" Clarkson, Hammond and May host the show from a travelling tent in locations around the world including Johannesburg, California, Scotland, Rotterdam, Lapland, Nashville, Whitby in North Yorkshire, Stuttgart and Dubai. \nThe first episode kicked off in California, when the trio set up camp at Dry Rabbit Lake in the Mojave Desert near Lucerne Valley, outside of L.A. There, they staged a \"Burning Van\" festival for thousands of fans, which was featured in the series opener.
