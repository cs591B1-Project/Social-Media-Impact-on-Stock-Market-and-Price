To that end, the front features a 7-inch, 1,024 x 600 resolution IPS display and VGA selfie camera, while the rear features a 2-megapixel sensor. The Nook branding on the back is the only thing keeping the Nook from looking like generic Android tablets you might find at a Walmart or gas station, but, again, it aims to fill basic tablet needs and nothing more.\nMore: New $250 Verizon Ellipsis 8 HD tablet boasts Snapdragon 617 and 3GB RAM\nThat theme continues under the hood, where you will find an unnamed quad-core processor and 8GB of storage, though the MicroSD card slot lets you add up to an additional 128GB of memory. As a small bonus, you can save most Nook books to your MicroSD card. Since the Nook is an Android tablet, the tablet runs a seemingly stock version of Android 6.0 Marshmallow. More specifically, even though there are plenty of pre-loaded Nook-related apps, the Nook also has access to Google Play and Google’s slew of Android apps.\nThere are a few key features Barnes & Noble points out with the Nook, the first being Readouts. The feature lets users read brief excerpts from new books, as well as a number of articles from different magazines. Furthermore, anyone who buys the Nook can get free support from physical Barnes & Noble locations. Finally, the Nook will be sold for just $50, putting the tablet in direct competition with Amazon’s own cheap Fire tablet.\nThe two tablets are very similar to each other, down to the amount of storage, so buyers will need to weigh whether Barnes & Noble or Amazon will best fulfill their needs. If you find that the Nook is the tablet for you, it is currently available for pre-order online, with in-store availability slated for Black Friday, November 25.\nTCL’s kitchen-ready tablet adds Amazon Alexa integration Joy is a $500 tablet that’s a curated digital frame for your photos Want the new S Pen without the exploding phone?

      "title": "Amazon Wants Live-Streaming Sports Rights for Prime Video, But What Will It Really Be Able to Secure?",
      "text": "Courtesy of Amazon November 21, 2016 | 03:30PM PT \nAmazon has dreams of crashing into the big leagues of televised sports, and it’s been quietly working to try to assemble a package of live-streaming sports that might be offered as part of its Prime membership program. \nThe most salient question, though, is what the internet retail giant will be able secure in the way of compelling sports programming — given that the TV and digital rights to the most popular sports around the world are locked up, in some cases for the next decade or beyond. Note that CBS and Turner clinched rights to the NCAA March Madness basketball tournament through 2032 in an $8.8 billion deal earlier this year. \nDespite the high prices and paucity of available rights, Amazon has been making the rounds recently at a number of leagues and rights-holders about potential deals. According to a Wall Street Journal report citing anonymous sources, Amazon has met with the NBA, NFL and Major League Baseball, as well as Major League Soccer, the ACC, and other smaller players to discuss licensing their content. \nBut the meetings may just be mostly talk. \nThe NBA, for one, turned down Amazon’s request to make the NBA League Pass out-of-market service available on an exclusive basis, according to the Journal. And even if leagues were interested in going digital-only, it’s hard to imagine Amazon forking over billions to outbid TV networks for exclusive broadcast right to their games. \nSports leagues are interested in boosting their digital reach, but they don’t want to destroy their existing lucrative TV deals in the process. The NFL, for example, carved out a small subset of its live games for digital distribution this season, in a deal with Twitter. Under that pact, Twitter is streaming 10 “Thursday Night Football” matchups free on the internet, redistributing the broadcasts of CBS and NBC. The NFL is looking at the Twitter deal an experiment to see if it can fruitfully slice up broadcast rights among multiple parties. \nThe sports deals Amazon is able to get might end up looking like what ESPN has talked about for its forthcoming over-the-top “multi-sport” service , delivered via its partnership with MLB’s BAMTech streaming-video division. The ESPN-branded OTT package will include college sports, including football and basketball, as well as tennis, rugby and cricket, according to execs — but the most-watched games will remain only on TV and the WatchESPN authenticated streaming services, according to ESPN president John Skipper. \nAn agglomeration of second- or third-tier sporting events might be appealing to some Amazon customers, but the bottom line is that the company is not in a position to be a seriously disruptive force in the market for TV sports rights. \nWord of Amazon’s interest in live sports surfaced in September , when Tennis Channel CEO Ken Solomon said the network had been in talks with the e-commerce giant for more than a year on a distribution deal. \nAmazon’s sports programming acquisition efforts are being led by James DeLorenzo, the former VP and GM of Sports Illustrated Digital, who joined the company earlier this year as head of sports video channels.

      "text": "Grand Tour premiered on Amazon Prime Video Friday and broke viewership. (Amazon Photo Via Twitter) I guess we know why Amazon paid $250 million for the Top Gear guys’ newest project, The Grand Tour .\nAmazon said the show, which follows Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May as they travel the world and indulge in their automotive dreams, broke viewership records for a premiere episode on Prime Video, surpassing The Man in the High Castle . Amazon didn’t say how many people watched the first episode, but put the figure in the millions.\nFriday’s premiere date saw the most new Prime membership sign-ups than outside of Prime Day, Amazon’s shopping holiday. Amazon encouraged this by offering a one-day discount for new Prime members, dropping its annual fee from $99 to $79 for the first year.\n“The guys are back, doing what they do best – the chemistry between Jeremy, Richard and James is what makes The Grand Tour so entertaining,” Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos said in a statement. “Their creativity, along with the amazing production quality and 4K HDR streaming, has Prime members responding in a big way. Kudos and congrats to the whole team.”\nBezos, who rarely tweets, hyped the show prior to its debut last week, as did Clarkson.\nLong wait is over… Clarkson, Hammond, May are back… #TheGrandTour premieres tonight in UK, US, DE, JP. And globally in Dec. pic.twitter.com/dfQjGGuDFW \n— Jeff Bezos (@JeffBezos) November 17, 2016 \nSo. People of Ireland, Canada, Australia and pretty well everywhere else. You WILL be able to watch the Grand Tour. Amazon has gone global.\n— Jeremy Clarkson (@JeremyClarkson) November 16, 2016 \nIt's going to be available in 200 territories. That's pretty much everywhere.\n— Jeremy Clarkson (@JeremyClarkson) November 16, 2016 \nThe premiere comes more than a year after the team began filming the 12-episode season. New episodes will be released every Friday.\nAmazon is preparing for a huge expansion of its Prime streaming video service, with The Grand Tour as a major selling point. Right now, Prime customers in the U.S., U.K., Germany, Austria and Japan have access to The Grand Tour , and the show will premiere worldwide for Amazon customers in more than 200 countries and territories in December.\nIt’s unclear if the expansion will include other Amazon content beyond the existing countries where video service is offered, but Clarkson’s Twitter feed gives some hints.\n@steve_ahier Yes. That's what I just said.\n— Jeremy Clarkson (@JeremyClarkson) November 16, 2016 \nWith a growing list of signature shows and expanding reach, Amazon seems poised to further challenge industry leader Netflix, which is now available in more than 190 countries after a big expansion this past January .\nIn July, Amazon said it planned to double down on its spending for video content during the second half of 2016 compared to the same period last year. Amazon CFO Brian Olsavsky added that the company will “nearly triple our offering to customers of new Amazon original TV shows and movies” compared to last year. \nIn his annual letter to shareholders , Bezos spotlighted Amazon’s original shows, noting how they “feed the Prime flywheel.”\n“These shows are great for customers, and they feed the Prime flywheel – Prime members who watch Prime Video are more likely to convert from a free trial to a paid membership, and more likely to renew their annual subscriptions,” Bezos wrote.\nIn the shareholders letter, Bezos also noted that Prime is one of three pillars of success at Amazon, in addition to its e-commerce marketplace business and cloud computing platform, Amazon Web Services. Some say that Amazon’s video arm could ultimately become the company’s fourth pillar.\nOriginally, Amazon’s original content was only available to annual Prime subscribers who pay $99 per year. In April, Amazon began offering a monthly $8.99 Prime subscription so members could access its video streaming service. The move was a direct swing at Netflix and its popular monthly subscription plan.",

      "text": "The e-commerce giant is looking to acquire the rights to a broad range of sporting events. \nIt’s only been a few days since the news broke that Amazon is rolling out its Prime Video streaming service in more than 200 countries to go head-to-head with Netflix . And now the e-commerce giant is said to be looking at putting together a premium sports package to go with it.\nThe company has been in talks with a wide range of different sports leagues about acquiring broadcasting rights, according to a report in the Wall Street Journal .\nObviously, Amazon would probably be most interested in the top National Basketball Association, Major League Baseball, and National Football League events, but it is also talking to the National Lacrosse League and the World Surf League, the newspaper’s sources said.\nThe big problem with trying to buy up basketball, football, and baseball programming is that the major networks—especially ESPN—have already locked up most of them for the next decade or so.\nFor example, the deal that ESPN has with the NBA doesn’t end until 2024, and the rights packages that ESPN, CBS and NBC have for National Football League games run into the next decade as well. Even college football teams have locked up rights with various cable networks.\nESPN’s parent Disney is also looking to expand its streaming offerings, including a new service that is expected to be launched soon. That’s why the entertainment giant recently spent $1 billion to buy a stake in BAMTech, the tech provider that handles streaming for Major League Baseball and a number of other clients including ESPN.\nAccording to the Journal , Amazon is “keenly aware” that the NFL Sunday Ticket games offered by DirecTV helped give that cable competitor a boost when it first launched, and therefore Amazon wants to do something similar by signing up whatever sports it can.\nAs with almost everything Amazon does, the content in this case is just a lure to get customers to sign up for its Prime subscription service, which generates significant returns for the company and now incorporates everything from free shipping on products to a Spotify-style music service.\nThere’s one big reason why we shouldn’t dismiss either the online giant’s sports ambitions or its global Netflix competitor: Namely, Amazon’s $380 billion market capitalization, and the massive river of cash that spins out of its Amazon Web Services division, where hundreds of Fortune 500 companies store their data. It generates about $10 billion in revenue every year.\nThat’s definitely enough to spend buying up sporting rights. All Amazon has to do is find someone who is willing to sell and who hasn’t already cut a deal with an existing network.\nThis story originally appeared on Fortune.com . Copyright 2016 \n",

      "title": "Amazon's $250 million bet on Jeremy Clarkson's new show is already starting to pay off (AMZN)",
      "text": "print Amazon Prime Video \nAmazon is rumored to have paid about $250 million for \"The Grand Tour,\" a new series featuring Jeremy Clarkson and his former team that produced BBC's \"Top Gear.\" \nAnd based on early results, that investment is already starting to pay off. \nAccording to Amazon, The Grand Tour's debut episode last Friday was the biggest premiere ever on Amazon Prime Video. The company declined to share specific numbers, only saying it attracted \"millions\" of viewers, but said it broke the previous record held by \"The Man in The High Castle.\" \nIt's also become the top rated TV show or movie on IMDb, with an overall rating of 9.6 and over 10,000 votes, while getting a 4.9 out of 5 rating on Amazon and a 97% score on Rotten Tomatoes. \nBut perhaps what Amazon is most happy about is The Grand Tour's ability to draw in new Prime members. Amazon said it saw the second most number of new Prime member sign-ups on the day of the show's debut — after Prime Day, its big annual sales holiday that draws tens of millions of shoppers to its site. \nAmazon doesn't disclose the actual number of new sign-ups from either Prime Day or last Friday, so it's hard to tell how big an impact it had on the total number of Prime members. Still, it's an important development because it proves Amazon's investment in Prime Video is having a direct impact on the growth of its Prime members, who tend to spend more on Amazon than non-Prime members . \nAmazon has previously said that it's doubling its spending on video content in the second half of this year, compared with last year. The last time Amazon disclosed its investment amount on video content was back in 2014, when it said it spent $1.3 billion. \nPrime is Amazon's paid membership program that costs $99/year or $10.99/month. Members get access to free two-day shipping, a bunch of streaming video and music content, and online storage space. \nPrime members purchased $123 billion worth of goods from Amazon last year, accounting for nearly 60% of the company's total GMV (gross merchandise value), according to Deutsche Bank . They also spend about 4.6-times more money on Amazon than non-Prime members, Morgan Stanley said .

      "text": "2 Amazon Explores Possible Premium Sports Package With Prime Membership \nAmazon.com is exploring an ambitious offensive aimed at infiltrating the last bastion of traditional pay-television: live sports. In recent months, the e-commerce giant has been in talks for live game rights with heavy-hitters like the National Basketball Association, Major League Baseball and the National Football League, as well as smaller players. With at least some leagues, including the NBA, Amazon has floated creating a premium, exclusive sports package that would accompany a Prime membership. My sense is they are interested in anything that might be out there. Chad Swofford, VP of digital for the ACC 3 Pope Francis Extends Abortion-Forgiveness Edict \nPope Francis indefinitely extended the power of priests to forgive the “grave sin” of abortion, one of his signature gestures from the Catholic Church’s just-ended Jubilee Year of Mercy. The pope’s move, which allows priests to forgive women who have had abortions and any other people involved in the process, is largely symbolic. Pope Francis 4 Terror Finance Abroad Touches Thanksgiving at Home \nAn American food producer that counts Butterball turkeys among its brands has done millions of dollars of business in Africa with a company blacklisted by U.S. authorities for supporting terror, The Wall Street Journal has found . The Justice Department is conducting a criminal probe; and Seaboard, which holds a 50% noncontrolling stake in Butterball, denies the government’s allegations. The Journal’s findings underscore the complexity of policing the global economy, which relies on relatively unrestricted movements of goods and capital. 5 Parenting Style Affects Children in Unexpected Ways \nThe way parents relate to their children affects their physical well-being , not just their mental and emotional health, research has shown. In one study, a parenting style known as poor monitoring and supervision was associated with higher levels of inflammation and an overactive immune-system response in children. Additional research showed how family environment can affect brain development . We do know changes like this are associated with great risk for mental-health problems Nick Allen, University of Oregon psychology professor More",

      "text": "Despite the complications that the Brexit vote has caused for some British cloud computing buyers, IBM Corp. still sees a big growth opportunity in the local infrastructure-as-a-service market.\nThe company plans to address the increasing demand by launching four new data centers in the U.K. through 2017. The first facility is set to open by the end of this year in Fareham, a southern town located near the busy port cities of Southampton and Portsmouth. It should enable IBM to better target the numerous companies that operate in the two municipalities and the encompassing County of Hampshire, which is the fifth-largest in England with a population of nearly 2 million.\nBig Blue’s second planned cloud facility will come online in mid-2017 on a site leased from Ark Data Centres Ltd. The latter firm became the main infrastructure provider to the U.K. government last year after winning a £700 million ($865 million) contract known as the Crown Hosting Framework. IBM hopes that delivering services from the same location where several local agencies already run their workloads will put it in a better position to target the lucrative British public sector. Like the White House before it, the U.K. government adopted a “cloud-first” policy towards technology spending in 2013.\nIBM didn’t divulge where the two other planned facilities will be located or when they’re scheduled to come online. But the company did specify that the data centers are set to offer services that are currently available to customers stateside, including Watson, Bluemix and its recently introduced blockchain platform .\nThe expansion will bring the number of data centers that IBM operates in the U.K. to six, which puts it well ahead of bigger rivals such as Amazon.com Inc. that have only recently started establishing a local presence. Overall, Big Blue expects to have a total of 16 cloud facilities in Europe and more than 50 worldwide when construction completes next year. The company must keep investing in infrastructure if it wants to stay ahead of the competition, which is working hard to close the gap.\nAmazon Web Services powered up three new data centers in Ohio just a few weeks ago as part of an effort to court companies from the Great Lakes region. And a few months earlier, Google announced plans to launch 10 new cloud facilities of its own by 2018 in a bid to target international customers.\nImage courtesy of IBM ",

      "text": "The Grand Tour Amazon Studios \nThe Grand Tour has overtaken The Man In The High Castle as Amazon ’s most-streamed original show ever. Anil Kapoor Joins Amazon Pilot Based On 'Book Of Strange New Things' \nAs per usual, Amazon would not release specific audience numbers, but notes that viewership was in the millions in the U.S., UK, Germany, Austria and Japan over the opening weekend, which began at 00.01 GMT on Friday, November 18. \nThe motoring show reunites former Top Gear hosts Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May, with the first season taking place in far-flung locales across the globe. The studio portion of the show takes place in a travelling tent in locations ranging from Johannesburg to California, Scotland to Rotterdam, Lapland to Nashville, Whitby in North Yorkshire to Stuttgart and the final stop in Dubai. The first episode kicked off in California, when Jeremy, Richard and James took their famous studio tent to Dry Rabbit Lake. \nFurther episodes will be released weekly over the next 11 weeks for Prime members in the U.S., U.K., Germany, Austria and Japan, and the show will premiere worldwide for Amazon customers in over 200 countries and territories in December. \n“The guys are back, doing what they do best – the chemistry between Jeremy, Richard and James is what makes The Grand Tour so entertaining,” said Jeff Bezos, Chief Executive Officer of Amazon. “Their creativity, along with the amazing production quality and 4K HDR streaming, has Prime members responding in a big way. Kudos and congrats to the whole team.”",

      "text": "\nAmazon explores live sports streaming: WSJ Reuters 1 hr ago © REUTERS/Mike Segar/File Photo Amazon boxes are seen stacked for delivery in the Manhattan borough of New York City Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) is exploring live sports streaming and has held talks with leagues including the National Basketball Association, Major League Baseball and the National Football League for live game rights, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing sources.\nAmazon has held discussions to create a premium, exclusive sports package with a Prime membership. However, details are still not clear, the Journal reported on Monday.\nThe e-commerce giant's Prime loyalty program offers original TV programming and access to digital entertainment products such as Prime Music and Prime Video, as well as one-hour delivery of purchases, for an annual fee of $99.\nThe company, which has reached out to smaller leagues, has also contacted traditional TV networks for game rights they are not using, the Journal reported.\nAmong those approached include Univision Communications Inc [UVN.UL] for Mexican soccer league games, Walt Disney Co's (DIS.N) ESPN and ONE World Sports, the report said.\nAmazon, NBA, NFL and the Major League Baseball were not immediately available for comment.\nAmazon's move comes as sports fans increasingly rely on the internet to watch video at the expense of traditional cable and satellite connections.\nTech-giants such as Facebook Inc (FB.O) and Twitter Inc (TWTR.N) have signed up deals to beef up their video services.\nTwitter has a deal with the NFL to stream its Thursday night games during the 2016 regular season, while Facebook streamed some U.S. men's Olympic team games in partnership with the NBA.\n(Reporting by Rishika Sadam in Bengaluru; Editing by Sriraj Kalluvila)\nGo to MSN Home",

      "text": "Amazon Prime Video \nAmazon is rumored to have paid about $250 million for \"The Grand Tour,\" a new series featuring Jeremy Clarkson and his former team that produced BBC's \"Top Gear.\"\nAnd based on early results, that investment is already starting to pay off.\nAccording to Amazon, The Grand Tour's debut episode last Friday was the biggest premiere ever on Amazon Prime Video. The company declined to share specific numbers, only saying it attracted \"millions\" of viewers, but said it broke the previous record held by \"The Man in The High Castle.\"\nIt's also become the top rated TV show or movie on IMDb, with an overall rating of 9.6 and over 10,000 votes, while getting a 4.9 out of 5 rating on Amazon and a 97% score on Rotten Tomatoes. \nBut perhaps what Amazon is most happy about is The Grand Tour's ability to draw in new Prime members. Amazon said it saw the second most number of new Prime member sign-ups on the day of the show's debut — after Prime Day, its big annual sales holiday that draws tens of millions of shoppers to its site. \nAmazon doesn't disclose the actual number of new sign-ups from either Prime Day or last Friday, so it's hard to tell how big an impact it had on the total number of Prime members. Still, it's an important development because it proves Amazon's investment in Prime Video is having a direct impact on the growth of its Prime members, who tend to spend more on Amazon than non-Prime members . \nAmazon has previously said that it's doubling its spending on video content in the second half of this year, compared with last year. The last time Amazon disclosed its investment amount on video content was back in 2014, when it said it spent $1.3 billion. \nPrime is Amazon's paid membership program that costs $99/year or $10.99/month. Members get access to free two-day shipping, a bunch of streaming video and music content, and online storage space.  \nPrime members purchased $123 billion worth of goods from Amazon last year, accounting for nearly 60% of the company's total GMV (gross merchandise value), according to Deutsche Bank . They also  spend about 4.6-times more money on Amazon than non-Prime members, Morgan Stanley said . \nNOW WATCH: Scientists have discovered why American honey bees are turning into zombies \n",

      "text": "According to a new report from The Wall Street Journal, Amazon ( AMZN - Free Report ) is exploring several different options for entering into the sports broadcasting sphere and has been in talks for the livestreaming rights to games from the NBA, MLB, NFL, and a variety of smaller leagues.\nThe WSJ report cites people familiar with the matter who say that Amazon has been in discussions with these leagues over the past several months. Other than these giant domestic leagues, Amazon has also reportedly been in talks with Major League Soccer, the Atlantic Coast Conference, the National Lacrosse League, Major League Lacrosse, World Surf League, and sports networks like Campus Insiders and 120 Sports.\nThe report goes on to suggest that Amazon is interested in setting up a “premium, exclusive sports package” with some of these leagues, including the NBA, which would accompany an Amazon Prime subscription.\nAmazon has also apparently approached traditional TV networks, seeking game rights that aren’t currently being used. For example, the report says that Amazon has approached Univision Communications to see if it would consider packaging Mexican soccer league games that it could air but doesn’t; the report also says that Amazon has talked to Walt Disney Co.’s ( DIS - Free Report ) ESPN and ONE World Sports, which have the rights to a range of offbeat games and leagues.\nAmazon’s sports interest is also at an international level, as the company recently paid $10,000 for a tender document to potentially bid on Indian Premier League cricket games. Amazon is also looking at packaging an international package for NBA games, according to the report.\nIt seems like Amazon is going with the “cast a wide enough net” philosophy when it comes to its sports ventures, and that makes sense for a company that has no experience in this business. Whatever happens, any sports streaming offerings would take Amazon Prime one step closer to being a must-have living room feature.\nStocks that Aren't in the News.

      "text": "( Wikimedia Commons )\nBREAKING: Amazon explores possible premium sports package w/ Prime membership; has held talks w/NBA, MLB, NFL, MLS for live game rights – DJ\n— CNBC (@CNBC) November 21, 2016 \n\nWhile obviously nothing is imminent, if Amazon could acquire the rights to a few sports leagues, that could be a game-changer.\nBecause right now Amazon Prime Video is a nice luxury for those of us whose parents have Amazon Prime but isn’t an essential in the way Netflix is. But if Amazon were able to create a premium sports package then not only would it become a more serious player in streaming, but it would eliminate my last excuse for paying way too much for cable.\nBasically any show you want to watch right now, you can stream and that’s only going to accelerate in the coming years. But live games are what still makes a cable box necessary for us single dudes who watch sports every night to try to escape our feelings of loneliness. Put all those games on Amazon Prime and it completely changes the equation.\nThe Wall Street Journal first reported the news:\nWith at least some leagues, including the NBA, Amazon has floated the idea of creating an exclusive premium sports package available with its Amazon Prime program, though the details are unclear, the people said. Such a package could attract new members to the $99-a-year Prime program, which offers expedited shipping and streaming video, as well as to a “skinny bundle” of live online channels that Amazon is pursuing.\nOf course, it’ll be extremely challenging for Amazon to acquire the rights for such a service.\nOne big hurdle: many premium rights are tied up. The NBA’s deal with ESPN and TNT stretches until the 2024-2025 season, while the NFL’s pacts with ESPN, CBS, Fox and NBC run through early next decade. Many college conferences’ rights lie with various TV networks. And Disney’s recent investment in BAMTech means ESPN’s untapped sports rights likely will land in its coming multisport streaming service with BAMTech, a person familiar with ESPN’s thinking said.\nStill, Amazon has a history of making big long-term bets on its quest for total world domination. When Jeff Bezos wants something, he usually makes it happen, so it’ll be intriguing to see if this comes to fruition.  ",

      "text": "Amazon ( AMZN ) is continuing its investment in eSports with the announcement of the Champions of Fire Invitational, a casual mobile game competition hosted on its Amazon Appstore.\nThe one-day tournament will be held Dec. 2 in Las Vegas, where 16 video game streamers will compete for a share of a $100,000 cash prize.\nAmazon-owned video-game-streaming site Twitch, Amazon.com and Amazon Fire TV all will stream the event. CBS Sports Network also will air highlights from the event 10 days later.\nParticipants will compete across five \"top rated\" casual games, including Disney 's ( DIS ) Crossy Road , Bloons TD Battles , Pac-Man 256 , 8 Ball Pool and Fruit Ninja Tournament Edition , Amazon said.\nThe move represents Amazon's latest foray into the gaming world, a venture that was largely kicked off by its $1 billion acquisition of Twitch in 2014.\nAmazon is capitalizing on a market that continues to expand: The eSports industry in 2016 saw its global audience increase 13.3% year over year, according to the Casual Games Association .\n\"Competitive video gaming has seen huge growth, and we see tremendous customer value in expanding the tournament experience to include the casual mobile games played by millions of people today,\" Amazon Appstore Director Aaron Rubenson said in a statement Monday. \"The Champions of Fire Invitational will see some of the top gaming pros square off in the same fun games our customers can download and enjoy today from the Amazon Appstore.\"\nAmazon Game Studios, which came out of Amazon's acquisition of game developer Double Helix Games in 2014, in September released three games with extensive support for Twitch live streaming.\nEarlier this year, the Seattle e-commerce company launched Lumberyard, a platform monetized through Amazon Web Services that allows users to develop games for PCs, Microsoft 's ( MSFT ) Xbox One and Sony 's ( SNE ) PlayStation 4.\nAdditionally, Twitch in April introduced the eSports Championship Series, a \"professional league\" of eSports gaming that allows co-ownership among teams, the league's website notes .",

      "title": "Amazon is pushing for sports rights, but NBA turned them down for League Pass",
      "text": "NFL considering pushing London games back to 1 p.m. ET It sounds like Amazon has some heavy hitters on its side, including DeLorenzo and former Dish executive Sunil Dave, and they certainly have the resources to compete. As the article notes, higher bids for streaming sports rights may make more sense for Amazon than for other players in the space, too; Amazon already charges a fee to streaming users (with Prime Video or Prime) and could potentially charge an extra fee for premium sports content, something that would be harder on free-to-use, ad-dependent services like Twitter, Facebook or Snapchat. Netflix has that same advantage, but they’ve indicated that they’re not overly interested in non-replayable content.\nThe other big advantage for Amazon is that they’re also a retailer, and the information gained from what sports members watch could help with ad targeting and product sales. An example Ramachandran cites is potentially selling lacrosse equipment to those who watch lacrosse streams, and that could apply to almost any sport. It’s not just about equipment, either; Amazon could target relevant books, games, videos, apparel, team-licensed products and more to those who watch sports on its streaming service. Thus, there are revenue streams available to Amazon that aren’t available to some of their competitors who also want to stream sports. \nDespite all this talk, though, Amazon hasn’t actually picked up much yet. They’ve ventured into sports in small ways, as with their “ All Or Nothing ” behind-the-scenes in-season documentary series on the Arizona Cardinals, but there haven’t been any big streaming deals yet. They were reportedly in contention for the NFL’s Thursday Night Football streaming rights at one point, but Twitter won those. Ramachandran’s piece also notes that Amazon made a specific offer to be the exclusive licensee of NBA League Pass, but the NBA turned them down to stick with their current many-outlet approach. A lot of premium sports contracts (including digital rights) don’t expire for another eight years or more, too, so there isn’t a ton of inventory Amazon can immediately grab. And Ramachandran notes that Amazon has floated ideas before backing away in the past. Still, this report seems further evidence Amazon’s looking to become a big player in the sports-streaming world. Where they go from here will certainly be worth keeping an eye on. \n[ The Wall Street Journal ] About Andrew Bucholtz Andrew Bucholtz is a staff writer for Awful Announcing.

Prime members get a 20 percent discount on pre-order and new video games and two-day shipping. It costs $99 a year to become a prime member. \nAccording to the National Retail Federation , the average American consumer will spend $935.58 during the holiday shopping season. More than half of that shopping, 56.5 percent, will be done online, the organization says. © 2016 Cox Media Group. ",

Amazon reportedly in talks to carry live sports 0 Up Next The biggest tech turkeys of 2016 \nAmazon may be getting ready to step up its game a bit. \nThe internet retailer has spoken in recent months with representatives from the National Basketball Association , Major League Baseball and the National Football League for the rights to carry live games, the Wall Street Journal reported Monday. Part of the proposal has included the idea of offering the games through a premium sports package tied to its Amazon Prime program, the paper reported, citing unidentified people familiar with the matter. \nAmazon representatives did not immediate respond to a request for comment. \nAn exclusive sports package could go a long way toward attracting new subscribers to Amazon Prime , the $99-a-year service that already offers free two-day shipping and Netflix-style video streaming. In the past two months, the internet retailer has rolled out three free Prime perks -- Audible Channels, Prime Reading and an updated Prime Music -- that double as gateways to its monthly subscription services. \nAmazon isn't alone in its quest to attract more of the nation's mammoth sports-loving demographic. Twitter already struck an agreement for National Football League streaming rights in April, beating out Amazon and Verizon . Share your voice",

      "title": "Amazon ad features Muslim cleric",
      "text": "Subscribe to culture \nSAN FRANCISCO (USA Today) The most surprising thing about Amazon’s latest ad for its Prime service is that it appears to be the first time a Muslim cleric has been featured in a television ad shown in the United States. \n“I can’t think of one. There are plenty of religious figures in televisions, especially sitcoms and police procedurals. But no ads with imams,” said Tobe Berkovitz, a professor of advertising at Boston University. \nAmazon has done several wordless ads for Prime featuring people buying what it terms charming solutions for everyday problems. They include a father buying a lion’s mane for the family dog so the new baby isn’t scared of it, a dog with a broken leg getting a lift in a baby carrier and a grandfather using a leaf blower to power his granddaughter’s swing. \nThe new ad, which begins airing in the United States, United Kingdom and Germany last Wednesday (Nov. 16), would be no different were the subject matter not so rare. \nSet in England, the commercial begins with an Episcopal priest opening the door for his good friend, a Muslim imam. The two older men talk, laugh and share a cup of tea, both wincing at their creaky knees as they sit and stand. \nAfter they part, both pull out their phones, tap the Prime app and order something. \nNext we see them getting a delivery at their respective homes and it’s clear they’ve each bought the other identical knee pads. \nThe end of the 120-second ad features both men in their respective houses of worship, kneeling in prayer. \nAmazon didn’t set out to make any kind of political statement and the subject had nothing to do with the recently concluded U.S. presidential election, the company was quick to say. Work on the ad had already begun in June, said Simon Morris, Amazon’s European Union director of advertising. \nHowever, it’s clear that the topic is of concern, as Amazon does not generally reach out to the press in advance about its television ads, but did with this one. Groups that track hate crimes say there has been a rise in anti-immigrant and anti-Muslim incidents since the Nov. 8 election of Donald Trump, who called for a halt to all immigrants who were Muslim during his campaign. Respectful \nThe Amazon producers worked with several religious groups Including the Interfaith Alliance, the National Council of Churches and the Islamic Circle of North America to insure the ad was respectful, said Morris. \nThe lead characters in the commercial are played by actual religious leaders. They are Gary Bradley, vicar at St Mary’s and Paddington Green in London and Zubier Mohammad, principal of the Muslim School Oadby in Leicester, Morris said. The advertisement was filmed at two churches, St. Dunstan and All Saints Stepney Church in London, and at the East London Mosque. \nWhile Muslims are a small minority in the United States, making up just under 1 percent of the U.S. population, there are 3.3 million of them and there have been Muslim communities in the country for decades. \nDespite that, advertising professors and historians had to think hard about whether an Islamic religious leader had ever been depicted in an ad. \n“We certainly have used priests, nuns, ministers, rabbis and many other clerical types, but I have no memory of a Muslim Cleric ever being used,” said John Verret, who worked in advertising for 40 years and now faculty advisor to the Boston University AdLab, a student-run advertising agency. \nThat could be because advertisers have faced backlash in the past. \nIn 2011 Lowe’s pulled ads from a TLC reality series, All-American Muslim, because of pressure from a Florida conservative group that objected to the fact that the show depicted Muslims as “ ordinary folks while excluding many Islamic believers whose agenda poses a clear and present danger to liberties and traditional values that the majority of Americans cherish.” The show was later cancelled. \nIn England, where Muslims make up 5 percent of the population, the ad follows the U.K.’s vote to leave the European Union. The so-called Brexit referendum stemmed in part with dissatisfaction with a surge in immigration and set off a wave of attacks on Poles and Muslims in late June. \nWhile holiday ads are just ads in the United States, they have a whole different cultural connotation in the United Kingdom. There, the annual arrival of “Christmas adverts” is awaited with the same anticipation that is reserved for Super Bowl ads in the United States. Most Popular",

      "text": "Doesn't seem too bad, basically get £4 off the purchase of something you want via a button. Buy Dash Button for £0.99 and get a £4.99 discount after your first press. Ends Tuesday, 22nd November 2016, 11:59pm. Offer valid while stocks last. Amazon Dash Button is a Wi-Fi-connected device that reorders your favourite product with the press of a button. Each Dash Button is paired with a product of your choice, which is selected during the setup process. When you're running low, simply press Dash Button—ensuring you never run out of your essentials again. T&C's This offer is available to Prime members only. When you buy Amazon Dash Button for £4.99 and you press it for the first time, we will deduct the same £4.99 amount from your first order on Amazon.co.uk as long as the order results in an actual purchase. The £4.99 amount will be allocated proportionally among all qualifying items in your order(s). If your order amount is lower than £4.99, the difference will be deducted from the amount of the following order on Amazon.co.uk as long as this order results in an actual purchase. The £4.99 deduction only applies to eligible products sold by Amazon EU S.à r.l. through Amazon.co.uk. The £4.99 deduction does not apply to the purchase of Amazon Gift Cards, Warehouse Deals items, delivery and handling charges, gift wrapping costs, digital content, baby and infant formula. The deduction applies only one time per Dash Button, only to the customer account connected to Dash Button when you make the first press. This offer is non-transferable and may not be resold. There is no cash alternative. This offer may not be combined with other offers. Amazon reserves the right to modify or cancel the offer at any time. Deal Tags:",

      "text": "Amazon Reportedly Considering Live Sports Streaming For Prime Members  55 PST \nAt its inception, Amazon Prime could have come off as being pricey considering that all you got was free two-day shipping in the US. Fast forward to today, it seems that Prime is starting to become pretty value for money considering all that you’re getting, such as expedited shipping, video streaming, music streaming, photo storage, and more. \nIn fact it seems that Prime could be set to become very enticing to sports enthusiasts. According to a report from The Wall Street Journal , word on the street has it that Amazon could be considering adding the ability to live stream sporting events for Prime members. Amazon has apparently been in talks with the National Basketball Association, Major League Baseball and the National Football League for the rights to live stream their games. \nOther sports such as soccer, lacrosse and surfing leagues are also reportedly being considered. The report also adds that Amazon could also be considering a “skinny bundle”, which are basically just the live online channels which could be ideal for those who don’t really want the other features offered by Prime. Unsurprisingly Amazon declined to comment on the rumors. \nThat being said, trying to acquire these rights might not be quite as easy as there are other platforms who have already secured live streaming deals of their own, such as Twitter and Yahoo . Whether or not such a service will materialize remains to be seen, so take it with a grain of salt for now. \nFiled in General > Rumors . Read more about Amazon . Related Articles",

      "title": "Amazon targets Aussie market",
      "text": "@SupratimA \nThe entry of online retail giant Amazon.com into the Australian market has been seen as an existentialist threat to local retailers for some time now. \nSpoken about in hushed tones in the boardrooms of retailers big and small, the ultimate disrupter is getting ready to finally make its Australian entry, but doubts remain on whether the nation’s retail sector is equipped to deal with the US giant. \nBritish payment facilitator World First has been working closely with Amazon since 2008 and Ray Ridgeway, the chief commercial officer for World First Australia, says that following the US giant around the globe has given the company an insight into how it ticks. \n“We assess which markets they are looking to enter and we set up the bank accounts so when they look to sell into the country they don’t have to worry about the payment logistics,” he said. \nWhile Amazon’s entry has been mooted for many years, Mr Ridgway reckons the current conditions might be just right for it to pull the trigger. \n“Amazon sees Australia as a $4 billion market. It’s never been seen as an attractive market but what’s happening now is that Australians are rising up the ranks when it comes to online spending. \n“We are in the top 10 when it comes to online basket size, so that’s grabbing their attention. \n“Also, we don’t have too many international marketplaces in the market.” \nWith 7,630,000 Australians aged 14 and above — almost 40 per cent of the population — buying one or more products via the internet every four weeks, the market opportunity down under is becoming more attractive. Amazon has been characteristically quiet about the latest rumours but Mr Ridgeway said there was anecdotal evidence in the sector that the US retailer was getting closer to putting the warehouses and staffing in place for a full launch. Australian retailers haven’t been shy about professing their willingness to adapt to the “bricks and clicks” paradigm. \nHowever, Mr Ridgeway said the impact of Amazon’s marketplace model would force many established retailers to re-evaluate their game plans. \n“Australian retailers will have to take this seriously and any retailers in the business of selling quick-moving, cheap shippable products are going to get hit hardest,” he said. While big retailers were moving in the right direction, he warned that countering the overall impact of Amazon on moulding customer expectations of how they shopped, what they could buy and how it was delivered would be a challenge. \nHe said Amazon was likely to disrupt logistics in Australia. \n“The power of Amazon is the quick logistics turnaround which I don’t think we have in Australia, so they will shake things up on that front. When you buy something you don’t want to wait a week, and Australian retailers will have to change that.” \nSo who are the winners and losers once Amazon finally goes live? \nApart from Australian consumers, Mr Ridgeway said local online marketplace sellers would benefit. \n“There’s no doubt existing local Amazon sellers will be keen to be the first merchants on Amazon Australia to ensure they get first mover’s advantage and benefit from the buzz of the new platform before competition in­creases,” he said. \n“These sellers also have the experience, products and relationships to really hit the ground running.” \nAs for international online sellers, Amazon’s prowess in the logistics space will provide a valuable opportunity. While Australia is a small market it’s a wealthy market with an active consumer base. \nMr Ridgeway warned Amazon would be bad news for the big end retailers, ramping up the disruption dynamic in way that would force them to ask some hard questions. \nBut it’s not all doom and gloom, provided our retailers can leverage their traditional strengths. Amazon.com may be a wonderful marketplace but there’s a lot of junk sold on it. The trick, according to Mr Ridgeway is whether retailers can use the advantages the right way to provide greater value and quality to shoppers. ",

      "text": "Amazon Reportedly Interested In Sports Streaming November 21, 2016, 05:18:00 PM EDT By Ryan McQueeney, Zacks.com Shutterstock photo \nAccording to a new report from The Wall Street Journal, Amazon AMZN is exploring several different options for entering into the sports broadcasting sphere and has been in talks for the livestreaming rights to games from the NBA, MLB, NFL, and a variety of smaller leagues. \nThe WSJ report cites people familiar with the matter who say that Amazon has been in discussions with these leagues over the past several months. Other than these giant domestic leagues, Amazon has also reportedly been in talks with Major League Soccer, the Atlantic Coast Conference, the National Lacrosse League, Major League Lacrosse, World Surf League, and sports networks like Campus Insiders and 120 Sports. \nThe report goes on to suggest that Amazon is interested in setting up a \"premium, exclusive sports package\" with some of these leagues, including the NBA, which would accompany an Amazon Prime subscription. \nAmazon has also apparently approached traditional TV networks, seeking game rights that aren't currently being used. For example, the report says that Amazon has approached Univision Communications to see if it would consider packaging Mexican soccer league games that it could air but doesn't; the report also says that Amazon has talked to Walt Disney Co.'s DIS ESPN and ONE World Sports, which have the rights to a range of offbeat games and leagues. \nAmazon's sports interest is also at an international level, as the company recently paid $10,000 for a tender document to potentially bid on Indian Premier League cricket games. Amazon is also looking at packaging an international package for NBA games, according to the report. \nIt seems like Amazon is going with the \"cast a wide enough net\" philosophy when it comes to its sports ventures, and that makes sense for a company that has no experience in this business. Whatever happens, any sports streaming offerings would take Amazon Prime one step closer to being a must-have living room feature. \nStocks that Aren't in the News.

      "text": "on Nov 21, 2016, 6:00 PM TechSpot \nIf Amazon has its way, its Prime Video service might one day serve as your one stop shop for live sports broadcasts. \nSources familiar with the matter tell The Wall Street Journal that the Seattle-based e-commerce giant has conducted talks with representatives from major sports leagues including the National Football League, the National Basketball Association and Major League Baseball as well as smaller organizations such as Major League Soccer, Major League Lacrosse, the National Lacrosse League and college sports network Campus Insider with regard to licensing rights to carry live games. \nDetails are still fluid although one person said Amazon has proposed the idea of creating a premium sports package that would serve as an add-on of sorts for Prime subscribers. \nAmazon has also reportedly asked traditional TV networks for access to games they own the broadcasting rights to but don’t actually air. For example, Univision has the rights to broadcast Mexican soccer league games but doesn’t air all of them. Amazon believes it could make a business out of these unused games. \nIf Amazon could somehow break into the live sports market with top-tier content on offer, it would be a serious threat to similarly-minded new-age media players like Sling TV and even social networks like Facebook and Twitter . Getting network executives and broadcasting partners to let go of their traditional business model – one that is incredibly lucrative, mind you – won’t be easy. \nAnother major hurdle is the fact that many leagues are already locked into long-term deals with broadcasters. The NBA’s deal with ESPN and TNT, for example, runs through the 2025 season while the NFL has agreements in place with CBS, Fox, NBC and ESPN through early next decade.

      "text": "Alexa & Allrecipes Integration Makes Holiday Cooking Easier   Alexander Maxham \nAlexa, Amazon’s own personal assistant, has continued to get better and better by the day. After launching in 2014, and most people wondering what Amazon was planning to do with Alexa, it’s now one of the better personal assistants out there. Even better than Google Home which launched just this month. Alexa is a part of a number of products from Amazon, like the Echo, Echo Dot, Amazon Tap and a few of their Fire tablets and Fire TV sticks/set-top boxes. Amazon is always giving Alexa more “skills”, and it can now do things like control the lights in your home, your thermostat, call you an Uber and even help you save on some deals for Black Friday. \nNow, Amazon has added a new skill to Alexa, and that is thanks to Allrecipes. What this integration means is that users will be able to simply ask Alexa for a recipe and it’ll give it to you. Now of course you can do this with the Allrecipes app on your smartphone, but with Alexa you can do it all with your voice, without getting the Echo (or whatever device you are using Alexa on) dirty. It makes it a much more convenient way of using a recipe while you’re cooking this holiday season. \nTo enable this new skill for Alexa, all you need to do is open the app on your smartphone (the app is available for both Android and iOS). Then tap on “Skills” and find the Allrecipes skill and enable it. After that you’ll be asked to link your Allrecipes account, and that’s it. All you’ll need to do now is ask Alexa for a recipe and you’re all set. \nThe Amazon Echo is currently selling for $179, while the Amazon Tap will cost you $129 and the Amazon Echo Dot is $49.99. The Echo Dot plugs into another speaker, while the Amazon Tap is a portable way of having Alexa (although you need to tap it to access Alexa, instead of it being listening all the time), while the Amazon Echo is a full-on speaker with Alexa built in. You can pick these three up at Amazon, of course, as well as Best Buy and most other retailers.",

By Nov. 21, 2016 1:15 p.m. ET Text Size Large Photo: Getty Images \nThe ranks of Amazon Prime members continues to grow. The e-commerce giant now has 49.5 million Prime members in the United States, according to new third-party data from Cowen & Co. \nAmazon.com doesn’t disclose its Prime membership count, so Cowen bases its estimate off a panel of 2,500 U.S. consumers. Some 45% of that panel now has Prime, which translates to 49.5 million total consumers, Cowen estimates, up 23% from a year ago, when the firm estimated 40 million Prime subscriptions. \nPrime costs $99 a year. It gives Amazon shoppers free two-day shipping, plus free access to the company’s growing library of streaming TV and music. \nSome other data from Cowen’s new report: 83% of Prime members purchased an item from Amazon in October versus 49% of U.S. consumers that don’t have Prime. The number of people making “Grocery and consumable” purchases at Amazon are up 12% from last year, Cowen estimates. Meanwhile, those making the same kind of purchases fell 2% at Wal-Mart and rose just 1% at Target . \nThe swelling Prime base is good news for Amazon and its stock, especially as consumers gear up for holiday shopping. \nBig Picture: Amazon Prime members tend to make more purchases from Amazon, so the latest growth of Prime is a good sign for Amazon’s holiday sales.

      "text": "WSJ : Amazon Explores Possible Premium Sports Package With Prime Membership  19:  Amazon.com Inc. ( AMZN ) has been in talks with heavy hitters like the National Basketball Association, Major League Baseball and the National Football League for the rights to carry live games, the Wall Street Journal reported citing people familiar with the matter. It also has talked with soccer, lacrosse and surfing leagues. \nWith at least some leagues, including the NBA, Amazon has floated the idea of creating an exclusive premium sports package available with its Amazon Prime program, though the details are unclear. Such a package could attract new members to the $99-a-year Prime program, as well as to a \"skinny bundle\" of live online channels that Amazon is pursuing, the report said. \nAmazon, meanwhile, is also racing to compete against rival tech giants like Facebook Inc. and Twitter Inc., as well as BAMTech, a spinoff of Major League Baseball, which are seeking sports rights to beef up their video offerings. \nFor comments and feedback: contact",

Some viewers found it hilarious — “You nailed it girl,” @shanefrazier13 tweeted — but Hadid also received a lot of backlash on social media.\nGigi hadid is \"anti bullying\", but then turns around and bullyies melania trump for her accent & face. Classless. @GiGiHadid #amas\n— Lauren James (@LaurenJlovalova) November 21, 2016\nMore hypocrisy from the left, celebrate women & immigrants but @GiGiHadid makes fun of Melania's accent, bashing a woman immigrant. #noclass\n— Tina BW (@tinabeenaw) November 21, 2016\nAmazon’s holiday commercial hits us right in the feels.\nAmazon screenshot via Youtube. Touching, clever, & timely interfaith commercial by #Amazon , ray of hope in these divided times.

Times’ tweet read. Many readers took issue with the newspaper for normalizing a hate group.\nWTF?! Why are you glamorizing this guy, @latimes ? This is not a think tank. It's a hate group. https://t.co/Rd7rXHYD0c\n— Adam Shapiro (@adamshapiro) November 21, 2016\nmedia is covering groups who want minorities dead like they're unions or chamber of commerce and we're going to die https://t.co/bW66d6cv3w\n— Oliver Willis (@owillis) November 21, 2016\nInstagram updates to include basically all of Snapchat’s features.\n@instagram wow very innovative and creative, wonder where you got that idea from\n— Levi (@levibrandon48) November 21, 2016\n@levibrandon48 notices how similar Instagram’s updated new features are to those of other popular apps.

And now the e-commerce giant is said to be looking at putting together a premium sports package to go with it. \nThe company has been in talks with a wide range of different sports leagues about acquiring broadcasting rights, according to a report in the Wall Street Journal . \nObviously, Amazon would probably be most interested in the top National Basketball Association, Major League Baseball, and National Football League events, but it is also talking to the National Lacrosse League and the World Surf League, the newspaper’s sources said. \nThe big problem with trying to buy up basketball, football, and baseball programming is that the major networks—especially ESPN—have already locked up most of them for the next decade or so. \nFor example, the deal that ESPN has with the NBA doesn’t end until 2024, and the rights packages that ESPN, CBS and NBC have for National Football League games run into the next decade as well. Even college football teams have locked up rights with various cable networks. \nESPN’s parent Disney is also looking to expand its streaming offerings, including a new service that is expected to be launched soon. That’s why the entertainment giant recently spent $1 billion to buy a stake in BAMTech, the tech provider that handles streaming for Major League Baseball and a number of other clients including ESPN. \nAccording to the Journal , Amazon is “keenly aware” that the NFL Sunday Ticket games offered by DirecTV helped give that cable competitor a boost when it first launched, and therefore Amazon wants to do something similar by signing up whatever sports it can. \nAs with almost everything Amazon does, the content in this case is just a lure to get customers to sign up for its Prime subscription service, which generates significant returns for the company and now incorporates everything from free shipping on products to a Spotify-style music service. \nThere’s one big reason why we shouldn’t dismiss either the online giant’s sports ambitions or its global Netflix competitor: Namely, Amazon’s $380 billion market capitalization, and the massive river of cash that spins out of its Amazon Web Services division, where hundreds of Fortune 500 companies store their data. It generates about $10 billion in revenue every year. \nThat’s definitely enough to spend buying up sporting rights. All Amazon has to do is find someone who is willing to sell and who hasn’t already cut a deal with an existing network. \nThis story originally appeared on Fortune.com . Copyright 2016",

      "text": "\nThe Wii U is dead . Long live the Wii U.\nAlthough The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild  has been delayed repeatedly, Nintendo insists that it'll still come out on the Wii U next year. For anyone hoping to pick it up on Nintendo's current home console, Amazon has a pretty good deal going right now.\nYou can preorder Breath of the Wild  for 15% off of its normal MSRP right now by following this link . This knocks the price from $60 down to $51. This discount stacks with the 20% savings Amazon Prime members receive on all new games, meaning you can preorder Breath of the Wild  for as little as $47.99 before tax. \n\nThis sounds like a pretty solid deal on what will probably be the Wii U's swan song, though Nintendo has confirmed that Breath of the Wild  will also be available on the Switch. It's not clear whether this is a limited time promotion, so you may want to hurry if this deal piques your interest.\nEdit: Apparently, this deal also extends to the 3DS version of Mario Maker , Pokémon Sun and Moon , as well as the recent Paper Mario: Color Splash .\n",

      "text": "Amazon.com Inc is exploring live sports streaming and has held talks with leagues including the National Basketball Association, Major League Baseball and the National Football League for live game rights, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing sources. Amazon has held discussions to create a premium, exclusive sports package with a Prime membership. However, details are still not clear, the Journal reported on Monday.\nThe e-commerce giant’s Prime loyalty programme offers original TV programming and access to digital entertainment products such as Prime Music and Prime Video, as well as one-hour delivery of purchases, for an annual fee of $99.\nAmazon has also reached out to smaller leagues such as Major League Soccer, the Atlantic Coast Conference, college sports network Campus Insiders, 120 Sports, National Lacrosse League, Major League Lacrosse and World Surf League for game rights, according to the Journal. The company has also contacted traditional TV networks for game rights they are not using, the report said.\nAmong those approached include Univision Communications Inc for Mexican football league games, Walt Disney Co’s ESPN and ONE World Sports, the report said. Amazon, the NBA, the NFL and the Major League Baseball were not immediately available for comment. “We don’t comment on any partnership, potential or otherwise, until appropriate,” World Surf League spokesman said.\nMLS confirmed the talks with Amazon but declined to comment further. ACC, 120 Sports, NLL, MLL and Campus Insiders could not be immediately reached for comment. Amazon’s move comes as sports fans increasingly rely on the internet to watch video at the expense of traditional cable and satellite connections.\nTech-giants such as Facebook Inc and Twitter Inc have signed up deals to beef up their video services. Twitter has a deal with the NFL to stream its Thursday night games during the 2016 regular season, while Facebook streamed some U.S. men’s Olympic team games in partnership with the NBA.\nReuters \nThe post Amazon could be looking to expand in live sports streaming appeared first on Tech2 .",

      "text": "View Comments \nAmazon boxes are seen stacked for delivery in the Manhattan borough of New York City, January 29, 2016. REUTERS/Mike Segar/File Photo Amazon.com Inc is exploring live sports streaming and has held talks with leagues including the National Basketball Association, Major League Baseball and the National Football League for live game rights, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing sources. Amazon has held discussions to create a premium, exclusive sports package with a Prime membership. However, details are still not clear, the Journal reported on Monday. The e-commerce giant's Prime loyalty program offers original TV programming and access to digital entertainment products such as Prime Music and Prime Video, as well as one-hour delivery of purchases, for an annual fee of $99. Amazon has also reached out to smaller leagues such as Major League Soccer, the Atlantic Coast Conference, college sports network Campus Insiders, 120 Sports, National Lacrosse League, Major League Lacrosse and World Surf League for game rights, according to the Journal. The company has also contacted traditional TV networks for game rights they are not using, the report said. Among those approached include Univision Communications Inc [UVN.UL] for Mexican soccer league games, Walt Disney Co's ESPN and ONE World Sports, the report said. Amazon, the NBA, the NFL and the Major League Baseball were not immediately available for comment. \"We don't comment on any partnership, potential or otherwise, until appropriate,\" World Surf League spokesman said. MLS confirmed the talks with Amazon but declined to comment further. ACC, 120 Sports, NLL, MLL and Campus Insiders could not be immediately reached for comment. Amazon's move comes as sports fans increasingly rely on the internet to watch video at the expense of traditional cable and satellite connections. - Reuters ",

      "title": "kambo/ Sapo- story of my frog medicine experience — Amazon rainforest , Peru",
      "text": "kambo/ Sapo- story of my frog medicine experience - Amazon rainforest , Peru \nAmazon rainforest , Peru \n\nRecently i participated in a Kambo ceremony. I wanted to share my experience. As another jungle medicine has changed my life again.... Kambo or Sapo is a secretion from a very large frog found in the amazon of Peru and Brazil in South America. Known as the giant monkey frog - Phyllomedusa bicolor. I am truly fascinated by what i have experienced during, but more so the ongoing changes to me weeks after the ceremonys. I believe the only way to explain it is... i now feel more like a warrior. Well i guess this medicine is warrior medicine. The process of this medicine starts with you drinking two letres of water down as fast as you can. This is not as easy as it sounds. And can be the hardest part of this journey with kambo. Once you have sufficiently filled your tummy with water. Your upper arm is burnt with a small stick to make a \"gate\" and the burnt skin is removed to apply the kambo directly into the bloodstream. Generally the kambo is felt immediately or soon after applyed. Your body will react as if it is being poisoned and the first part of the cooking process begins. You feel as if your body is cooking and like you might be dying. But your not and you dont. Haha. The most fascinating things are happening in your body. Where this frogs secretion has entered into.your bloodstream it is now cleaning up all of the deep toxins that have collected in our arteries and fat cells and wow its incredible. It just hurts a bit. But its a good pain. You then purge these toxins out your system and into a bucket or in the toilet. This may not seem like the most exciting thing to do. But honestly, if you think about all the mindless **** we constantly have fed our systems our bodys -our temples. Constantly putting **** into it. It only makes sense its not going to be pleasant to get this toxic build up out. Once its out well i have felt good before. And i have felt clear before. But i experienced something more from kambo then i have never felt before... like my stystem is now switched to reset - warrior. I have way more energy. Way more motivation. I dont need near as much food as what i was endulging in. Physically my body is better. And i am now realizing more to treat it better. Cleaner eating. Physical activity daily. Nature. Nurture. Everyone i experienced kambo with. Has some kind of magic frog sun beams coming out of there souls now. This bond with the frog is now with us all. And im so grateful to have experienced this medicine. Kambo is being used to help with addictions, depression, physical illnesses and many many more extraordinary conditions. Looking forward to my next trip back to peru with ayahuasca to learn more from the plants and be with the heart medicines. for anyone interested in kambo/ sapo - frog medicine i highly recommend this book by Peter Gorman called SAPO in my SOUL And if you ever get the chance to experience it. Please be brave and reep the befits of being a fully activated human being :)\n",

      "text": "WSJ: Amazon Explores Live Video Streaming of Sporting Events \n(Dreamstime) Monday, 21 Nov 2016 04:27 PM Close A A \nAmazon.com Inc is exploring live sports streaming and has held talks with leagues including the National Basketball Association, Major League Baseball and the National Football League for live game rights, the Wall Street Journal reported , citing sources. \nAmazon has held discussions to create a premium, exclusive sports package with a Prime membership. However, details are still not clear, the Journal reported on Monday. \nThe e-commerce giant's Prime loyalty program offers original TV programming and access to digital entertainment products such as Prime Music and Prime Video, as well as one-hour delivery of purchases, for an annual fee of $99. \nThe company, which has reached out to smaller leagues, has also contacted traditional TV networks for game rights they are not using, the Journal reported. \nAmong those approached include Univision Communications Inc for Mexican soccer league games, Walt Disney Co's ESPN and ONE World Sports, the report said. \nAmazon, NBA, NFL and the Major League Baseball were not immediately available for comment. \nAmazon's move comes as sports fans increasingly rely on the internet to watch video at the expense of traditional cable and satellite connections. \nTech-giants such as Facebook Inc and Twitter Inc have signed up deals to beef up their video services. \nTwitter has a deal with the NFL to stream its Thursday night games during the 2016 regular season, while Facebook streamed some U.S. men's Olympic team games in partnership with the NBA. \n\n© 2016 Thomson/Reuters.

      "text": "Edit: Apparently, this deal also extends to the 3DS version of  Mario Maker ,  Pokémon Sun   and  Moon , as well as the recent  Paper Mario: Color Splash .\nThe Wii U is dead . Long live the Wii U.\nAlthough The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild  has been delayed repeatedly, Nintendo insists that it'll still come out on the Wii U next year. For anyone hoping to pick it up on Nintendo's current home console, Amazon has a pretty good deal going right now.\nYou can preorder Breath of the Wild  for 15% off of its normal MSRP right now by following this link . This knocks the price from $60 down to $51. This discount stacks with the 20% savings Amazon Prime members receive on all new games, meaning you can preorder Breath of the Wild  for as little as $47.99 before tax. \n\nThis sounds like a pretty solid deal on what will probably be the Wii U's swan song, though Nintendo has confirmed that Breath of the Wild  will also be available on the Switch. It's not clear whether this is a limited time promotion, so you may want to hurry if this deal piques your interest.\n \n\nRead more... ",
