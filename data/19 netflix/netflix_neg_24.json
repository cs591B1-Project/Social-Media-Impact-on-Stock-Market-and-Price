      "text": "Everyone Can Finally Watch Netflix Offline By Facebook At last, Netflix is giving the people what they want (but not a good season of Arrested Development ). \nEarlier today, without warning, Netflix dropped one of its coolest, most anticipated features ever: Offline Mode. In typical new-media fashion, this announcement came in the form of a smug little tweet. \nhttps://twitter.com/netflix/status/803962377997688832 \nThe official website was updated shortly thereafter to give us some more information: Starting today, users on iOS and Android phones/tablets can, on certain movies and shows, download videos to watch later without an internet connection. As long as you have an account, and the latest version of the app, that's all you need. \nThis is something Netflix users have been asking for for many years now. The company has never exactly been fast to address its fans (except that one time they tried to stop doing DVDs altogether, remember that disaster? ). In fact, just two years ago the higher-ups at Netflix said the ability to download content would never happen. \nSo far, it looks like you can only download Netflix Original shows/movies, along with some selected other stuff (there's no official list running around just yet.) But Netflix promised there are \"more on the way\" so your sick, sick dream of watching American Pie Presents: The Book Of Love on a crowded bus could still become a reality.

Netflix hasn't released a full list of compatible shows, but it appears to mostly favor Netflix originals like \"Narcos\" and \"Stranger Things.\" It's unclear how many licensed titles from third parties will be available to download. \nAmazon Video, which offers thousands of free TV shows and movies for Prime members, lets you download just about any video for offline viewing. Netflix appears to be taking a more cautious approach to video downloads for now. \nThe \"Available for Download\" section on Netflix does include a variety of third-party shows and movies though, including \"Parks and Recreation,\" \"Mad Men,\" and a bunch of documentaries. Netflix said in a statement that \"many more\" titles are coming. \nScreenshot \nNetflix downloads work on iOS and Android devices. You'll need to update your Netflix app to the latest version, which launches Wednesday. A download button will appear next to the videos you can store for offline viewing. \nLike this: \nNetflix \nNetflix has historically been against allowing offline viewing, even as recently as the end of last year. But executives have loosened their opposition to video downloads this year, leading many to speculate it'd happen soon. Well, here it is, even if it's pretty limited for now. \nFindTheCompany | Graphiq",

      "text": "Netflix Finally Made It Possible to Watch Your Favorite TV Shows and Movies Offline By Email Latest News Email Netflix \nWe've all been there: You've just gotten settled in to your (probably germ-infested) airplane seat for a long flight across the country. You've got your comfy pants, your comfy socks and your don't-even-try-to-talk-to-me-seatmate headphones. You pull out your iPad, giddy with the anticipation over being able to finish the Gilmore Girls revival while you travel home from Thanksgiving, when the worst thing happens. The plane doesn't have WiFi . \nOr it has Internet, but it costs way more money than you're willing to spend (here's looking at you, United!). Or it has reasonably-priced Internet, but it's so slow that you'd have to have the patience of Mother Theresa to get through even the opening credits of your favorite show. \nWell, since airplanes aren't going to up their game anytime soon, Netflix is going to instead. Photos \nGilmore Girls: A Year in the Life Fashion Secrets Revealed \nAs of this very moment in time, users will be able to download programming right off of Netflix to watch anytime, Internet connection or data plan be damned. The company teased the change earlier this month, but today Netflix announced that it was coming to all users today. \nAs always, there are a few things you'll need to know. First, this only works on the app (for Android or iOS), so you won't be able to stream offline on your laptop—but iPad and iPhone users, rejoice! Second, the feature isn't available for every single title just yet. It presumably takes a bit of time to build this out, so while it will eventually be a company-wide option, for now there's an ever-growing list of shows you can download. Fortunately it includes heavy-hitters like Orange Is the New Black and The Crown , so we won't be deprived while we wait for the full rollout. \nAnd now, we celebrate the fact that we'll never have to (gasp!) talk to our travel companions again.

      "text": "Binge watching on Netflix no longer requires internet access By MICHAEL LIEDTKEAP Technology Writer \nSAN FRANCISCO (AP) - Netflix subscribers can now binge on many of their favorite shows and movies even when they don't have an internet connection. \nThe long-awaited offline option announced Wednesday gives Netflix's 87 million subscribers offline access to videos for the first time in the streaming service's decade-long history. \nNetflix is matching a downloading feature that one of its biggest rivals, Amazon.com, has been offering to its video subscribers for the past year. It's something that also has been available on YouTube's popular video site, though a subscription is required in the U.S. and other countries where the site sells its \"Red\" premium service. \nThe new feature puts Netflix a step ahead of two other major rivals. Offline options aren't available on HBO's internet-only package, HBO Now, or Hulu, although that service has publicly said it hopes to introduce a downloading feature. \nNetflix subscribers wishing to download a video on their smartphone or tablet need to update the app on their Apple or Android device. \nNot all of the selections in Netflix's video library can be downloaded, although several of the service's most popular shows, including \"Orange Is The New Black,\" ''House of Cards,\" and \"Stranger Things,\" are now available to watch offline. \nDownloadable movies include \"Spotlight,\" this year's Oscar winner for best film. Notably missing from the downloadable menu are movies and TV shows made by Walt Disney Co. Those still require an internet connection to watch on Netflix. \nThe Los Gatos, California, company is promising to continue to adding more titles to its offline roster. \nNetflix CEO Reed Hastings had long resisted calls for an offline-viewing option, much to the frustration of customers who wanted flexibility to use their subscriptions to watch a show or movie when traveling on a train, plane or car where internet connections are spotty or completely unavailable. \nEarlier this year, Hastings finally indicated he might relent and introduce downloading. \nThe change of heart coincided with Netflix's expansion into more than 130 countries, including many areas with shoddy or expensive internet connections that make the ability to watch video offline even more appealing. \nNetflix ended September with 39 million subscribers outside of the U.S. \nThe offline option may accelerate the decline of Netflix's steadily shrinking DVD-by-mail service, which offers the ability to watch video without an internet connection. Netflix's DVD side still has one distinct advantage - access to recent theatrical releases before they are available for streaming. \nNetflix's DVD service ended September with 4.3 million subscribers, a decrease of nearly 10 million customers during the past five years.

      "text": "Binge watching on Netflix no longer requires internet access \nPosted 16   MICHAEL LIEDTKE, AP Technology Writer \nSAN FRANCISCO — Netflix subscribers can now binge on many of their favorite shows and movies even when they don't have an internet connection. \nThe long-awaited offline option announced Wednesday gives Netflix's 87 million subscribers offline access to videos for the first time in the streaming service's decade-long history. \nNetflix is matching a downloading feature that one of its biggest rivals, Amazon.com, has been offering to its video subscribers for the past year. It's something that also has been available on YouTube's popular video site, though a subscription is required in the U.S. and other countries where the site sells its \"Red\" premium service. \nThe new feature puts Netflix a step ahead of two other major rivals. Offline options aren't available on HBO's internet-only package, HBO Now, or Hulu, although that service has publicly said it hopes to introduce a downloading feature. \nNetflix subscribers wishing to download a video on their smartphone or tablet need to update the app on their Apple or Android device. \nNot all of the selections in Netflix's video library can be downloaded, although several of the service's most popular shows, including \"Orange Is The New Black,\" ''House of Cards,\" and \"Stranger Things,\" are now available to watch offline. \nDownloadable movies include \"Spotlight,\" this year's Oscar winner for best film. Notably missing from the downloadable menu are movies and TV shows made by Walt Disney Co. Those still require an internet connection to watch on Netflix. \nThe Los Gatos, California, company is promising to continue to adding more titles to its offline roster. \nNetflix CEO Reed Hastings had long resisted calls for an offline-viewing option, much to the frustration of customers who wanted flexibility to use their subscriptions to watch a show or movie when traveling on a train, plane or car where internet connections are spotty or completely unavailable. \nEarlier this year, Hastings finally indicated he might relent and introduce downloading. \nThe change of heart coincided with Netflix's expansion into more than 130 countries, including many areas with shoddy or expensive internet connections that make the ability to watch video offline even more appealing. \nNetflix ended September with 39 million subscribers outside of the U.S. \nThe offline option may accelerate the decline of Netflix's steadily shrinking DVD-by-mail service, which offers the ability to watch video without an internet connection. Netflix's DVD side still has one distinct advantage — access to recent theatrical releases before they are available for streaming. \nNetflix's DVD service ended September with 4.3 million subscribers, a decrease of nearly 10 million customers during the past five years. \n ",

      "text": "Quentyn Kennemer Nov 30th, 2016 \nNetflix has long been asked to add offline playback to their service, and while their earlier stance on the matter was a strong “screw that,” they’ve warmed up to it in recent times. Well, they’ve finally come around to give us what we’ve been asking for. \nThe feature works as you’d expect: go to the movie or show you want to be available offline, and a nice download button will be on the page for you to get it moved to your phone’s storage. You’ll be able to access that content if you have on connection, so binge watching a season of House of Cards or Luke Cage on a flight is finally within your power. \nWhat’s better is that the feature is available at no additional cost, save for the amount of data you’ll need to update the app. It’s iOS and Android only for now, but for those in unique situations where this feature would be useful on multimedia boxes and other such home-use products, we’re reaching out to Netflix to see if anything is in the works.",

      "text": "SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Netflix subscribers can now binge on many of their favorite shows and movies even when they don’t have an internet connection.\nThe long-awaited offline option announced Wednesday gives Netflix’s 87 million subscribers offline access to videos for the first time in the streaming service’s decade-long history.\nNetflix is matching a downloading feature that one of its biggest rivals, Amazon.com, has been offering to its video subscribers for the past year. It’s something that also has been available on YouTube’s popular video site, though a subscription is required in the U.S. and other countries where the site sells its “Red” premium service.\nThe new feature puts Netflix a step ahead of two other major rivals. Offline options aren’t available on HBO’s internet-only package, HBO Now, or Hulu, although that service has publicly said it hopes to introduce a downloading feature.\nNetflix subscribers wishing to download a video on their smartphone or tablet need to update the app on their Apple or Android device.\nNot all of the selections in Netflix’s video library can be downloaded, although several of the service’s most popular shows, including “Orange Is The New Black,” ”House of Cards,” and “Stranger Things,” are now available to watch offline.\nDownloadable movies include “Spotlight,” this year’s Oscar winner for best film. Notably missing from the downloadable menu are movies and TV shows made by Walt Disney Co. Those still require an internet connection to watch on Netflix.\nThe Los Gatos, California, company is promising to continue to adding more titles to its offline roster.\nNetflix CEO Reed Hastings had long resisted calls for an offline-viewing option, much to the frustration of customers who wanted flexibility to use their subscriptions to watch a show or movie when traveling on a train, plane or car where internet connections are spotty or completely unavailable.\nEarlier this year, Hastings finally indicated he might relent and introduce downloading.\nThe change of heart coincided with Netflix’s expansion into more than 130 countries, including many areas with shoddy or expensive internet connections that make the ability to watch video offline even more appealing.\nNetflix ended September with 39 million subscribers outside of the U.S.\nThe offline option may accelerate the decline of Netflix’s steadily shrinking DVD-by-mail service, which offers the ability to watch video without an internet connection. Netflix’s DVD side still has one distinct advantage — access to recent theatrical releases before they are available for streaming.\nNetflix’s DVD service ended September with 4.3 million subscribers, a decrease of nearly 10 million customers during the past five years.\n(TM and © Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

      "text": "Binge watching on Netflix no longer requires internet access By MICHAEL LIEDTKEAP Technology Writer \nSAN FRANCISCO (AP) - Netflix subscribers can now binge on many of their favorite shows and movies even when they don't have an internet connection. \nThe long-awaited offline option announced Wednesday gives Netflix's 87 million subscribers offline access to videos for the first time in the streaming service's decade-long history. \nNetflix is matching a downloading feature that one of its biggest rivals, Amazon.com, has been offering to its video subscribers for the past year. It's something that also has been available on YouTube's popular video site, though a subscription is required in the U.S. and other countries where the site sells its \"Red\" premium service. \nThe new feature puts Netflix a step ahead of two other major rivals. Offline options aren't available on HBO's internet-only package, HBO Now, or Hulu, although that service has publicly said it hopes to introduce a downloading feature. \nNetflix subscribers wishing to download a video on their smartphone or tablet need to update the app on their Apple or Android device. \nNot all of the selections in Netflix's video library can be downloaded, although several of the service's most popular shows, including \"Orange Is The New Black,\" ''House of Cards,\" and \"Stranger Things,\" are now available to watch offline. \nDownloadable movies include \"Spotlight,\" this year's Oscar winner for best film. Notably missing from the downloadable menu are movies and TV shows made by Walt Disney Co. Those still require an internet connection to watch on Netflix. \nThe Los Gatos, California, company is promising to continue to adding more titles to its offline roster. \nNetflix CEO Reed Hastings had long resisted calls for an offline-viewing option, much to the frustration of customers who wanted flexibility to use their subscriptions to watch a show or movie when traveling on a train, plane or car where internet connections are spotty or completely unavailable. \nEarlier this year, Hastings finally indicated he might relent and introduce downloading. \nThe change of heart coincided with Netflix's expansion into more than 130 countries, including many areas with shoddy or expensive internet connections that make the ability to watch video offline even more appealing. \nNetflix ended September with 39 million subscribers outside of the U.S. \nThe offline option may accelerate the decline of Netflix's steadily shrinking DVD-by-mail service, which offers the ability to watch video without an internet connection. Netflix's DVD side still has one distinct advantage - access to recent theatrical releases before they are available for streaming. \nNetflix's DVD service ended September with 4.3 million subscribers, a decrease of nearly 10 million customers during the past five years.

      "text": "Netflix Canada announced Wednesday that users worldwide can download some videos to their mobile devices instead of streaming them over cellular data, a feature that could keep eyeballs on the app when Internet signals are spotty or unavailable.\nUsers boarding an airplane, leaving on a road trip or ducking into the subway, for example, could use Wi-Fi to download their favourite movies and TV shows beforehand, then view them when the cellular signal dips out.\nNetflix said that initially, only some of the content in its library will be available off-line via the feature, available in the latest version of its app on phones and tablets using iOS or Android. The company did not specify how many programs would become available for download later, saying only that there would be \"more on the way.\"\nEven in areas with strong cellular coverage, watching content off-line would allow users to avoid depleting their monthly data limits, addressing a major frustration of mobile video, which eats up data ravenously.\nCustomers who watch only a limited amount of video before incurring overage fees with their cellular carriers are more likely to stop watching videos — an unpalatable option for media companies like Netflix that want to keep eyes glued to their products.\nThe company offers a choice between downloading videos in \"standard\" quality or \"higher\" quality, which has a higher resolution but takes up more storage space.\nAirplane mode. Road trip mode. Stuck-in-the-subway-for-20-minutes mode. Your favourite stories are now available for download any time. pic.twitter.com/KnDGxoapLP\n— Netflix Canada (@Netflix_CA) November 30, 2016",

      "text": "Email \nNEW YORK — It just got even easier to binge on Netflix. \nNetflix announced on Wednesday members now have the option to download movies and shows to watch offline later. This means you can finally watch Gilmore Girls and Stranger Things while on a flight or stuck in the subway. \nThe feature comes free of cost with all Netflix memberships. \nUp until now, you need a place with a reliable internet connection to access the streaming service. But Netflix wants to make its product more nimble to suit the lives of those on-the-go. \nThe company previously argued the feature was unnecessary, calling it a “short term fix for a bigger problem.” That problem, of course, being wireless internet availability. \nBut its competitor Amazon Prime embraced offline downloads for iOS and Android users more than a year ago. \nAccording to Netflix’s Help Center page, “you’ll want to delete” downloaded titles before attempting to download a new content. \nIt is unclear as of now if there’s a cap on how many shows or films people can download at once. \nNetflix did not immediately respond to CNNMoney’s request for comment ",

      "text": "Binge watching on Netflix no longer requires internet access Posted: By MICHAEL LIEDTKEAP Technology Writer \nSAN FRANCISCO (AP) - Netflix subscribers can now binge on many of their favorite shows and movies even when they don't have an internet connection. \nThe long-awaited offline option announced Wednesday gives Netflix's 87 million subscribers offline access to videos for the first time in the streaming service's decade-long history. \nNetflix is matching a downloading feature that one of its biggest rivals, Amazon.com, has been offering to its video subscribers for the past year. It's something that also has been available on YouTube's popular video site, though a subscription is required in the U.S. and other countries where the site sells its \"Red\" premium service. \nThe new feature puts Netflix a step ahead of two other major rivals. Offline options aren't available on HBO's internet-only package, HBO Now, or Hulu, although that service has publicly said it hopes to introduce a downloading feature. \nNetflix subscribers wishing to download a video on their smartphone or tablet need to update the app on their Apple or Android device. \nNot all of the selections in Netflix's video library can be downloaded, although several of the service's most popular shows, including \"Orange Is The New Black,\" ''House of Cards,\" and \"Stranger Things,\" are now available to watch offline. \nDownloadable movies include \"Spotlight,\" this year's Oscar winner for best film. Notably missing from the downloadable menu are movies and TV shows made by Walt Disney Co. Those still require an internet connection to watch on Netflix. \nThe Los Gatos, California, company is promising to continue to adding more titles to its offline roster. \nNetflix CEO Reed Hastings had long resisted calls for an offline-viewing option, much to the frustration of customers who wanted flexibility to use their subscriptions to watch a show or movie when traveling on a train, plane or car where internet connections are spotty or completely unavailable. \nEarlier this year, Hastings finally indicated he might relent and introduce downloading. \nThe change of heart coincided with Netflix's expansion into more than 130 countries, including many areas with shoddy or expensive internet connections that make the ability to watch video offline even more appealing. \nNetflix ended September with 39 million subscribers outside of the U.S. \nThe offline option may accelerate the decline of Netflix's steadily shrinking DVD-by-mail service, which offers the ability to watch video without an internet connection. Netflix's DVD side still has one distinct advantage - access to recent theatrical releases before they are available for streaming. \nNetflix's DVD service ended September with 4.3 million subscribers, a decrease of nearly 10 million customers during the past five years.

      "text": "Thursday 1 Dec 2016 7:28 a.m. \nOffline downloads are only available on smartphones and tablets (Reuters) Share this story \nYou can now download Netflix shows and watch them offline. \nThe global streaming service announced on Thursday morning (NZ time) users can now download select TV shows and films to view later on smartphones and tablets - but not PCs. \nShows available for download at this stage include Netflix originals Stranger Things , The Crown , Narcos , House of Cards and Orange is the New Black , and other networks' shows like Shameless and Broadchurch . (Grady Connell/Newshub.) (Grady Connell/Newshub.) \nIn a blog post announcing the feature, Netflix director of product innovation Eddy Wu said the feature was in response to customer feedback on viewing habits. \n\"While many members enjoy watching Netflix at home, we've often heard they also want to continue their Stranger Things binge while on airplanes and other places where internet is expensive or limited.\" \nHe said more content will become available for download in the future. Netflix and bill: Payment errors leave customers fuming \nProgrammes can be downloaded within the Netflix app on iOS and Android. \nThe addition of the service is somewhat of a U-turn for the streaming service; in 2014, Netflix director of corporate communications and technology Cliff Edwards told TechRadar that offline viewing was \"never going to happen\". \nWhen rival service Amazon Prime Video announced offline viewing in 2015, Netflix Chief Product officer Neil Hunt said, \"I still don't think it's a very compelling proposition.\" Netflix cracks down on foreign access in NZ \nNetflix has 86 million subscribers in more than 190 countries. \nNetflix NZ, which launched in March 2015, had 264,000 paid subscribers at the end of 2015, according to Roy Morgan Research. \nNewshub.",

      "text": "Binge watching on Netflix no longer requires internet access Posted: By MICHAEL LIEDTKEAP Technology Writer \nSAN FRANCISCO (AP) - Netflix subscribers can now binge on many of their favorite shows and movies even when they don't have an internet connection. \nThe long-awaited offline option announced Wednesday gives Netflix's 87 million subscribers offline access to videos for the first time in the streaming service's decade-long history. \nNetflix is matching a downloading feature that one of its biggest rivals, Amazon.com, has been offering to its video subscribers for the past year. It's something that also has been available on YouTube's popular video site, though a subscription is required in the U.S. and other countries where the site sells its \"Red\" premium service. \nThe new feature puts Netflix a step ahead of two other major rivals. Offline options aren't available on HBO's internet-only package, HBO Now, or Hulu, although that service has publicly said it hopes to introduce a downloading feature. \nNetflix subscribers wishing to download a video on their smartphone or tablet need to update the app on their Apple or Android device. \nNot all of the selections in Netflix's video library can be downloaded, although several of the service's most popular shows, including \"Orange Is The New Black,\" ''House of Cards,\" and \"Stranger Things,\" are now available to watch offline. \nDownloadable movies include \"Spotlight,\" this year's Oscar winner for best film. Notably missing from the downloadable menu are movies and TV shows made by Walt Disney Co. Those still require an internet connection to watch on Netflix. \nThe Los Gatos, California, company is promising to continue to adding more titles to its offline roster. \nNetflix CEO Reed Hastings had long resisted calls for an offline-viewing option, much to the frustration of customers who wanted flexibility to use their subscriptions to watch a show or movie when traveling on a train, plane or car where internet connections are spotty or completely unavailable. \nEarlier this year, Hastings finally indicated he might relent and introduce downloading. \nThe change of heart coincided with Netflix's expansion into more than 130 countries, including many areas with shoddy or expensive internet connections that make the ability to watch video offline even more appealing. \nNetflix ended September with 39 million subscribers outside of the U.S. \nThe offline option may accelerate the decline of Netflix's steadily shrinking DVD-by-mail service, which offers the ability to watch video without an internet connection. Netflix's DVD side still has one distinct advantage - access to recent theatrical releases before they are available for streaming. \nNetflix's DVD service ended September with 4.3 million subscribers, a decrease of nearly 10 million customers during the past five years.

And the time is now!! \nIt's available at no extra cost. Netflix released a statement: \nWhile many members enjoy watching Netflix at home, we’ve often heard they also want to continue their Stranger Things binge while on airplanes and other places where Internet is expensive or limited. Just click the download button on the details page for a film or TV series and you can watch it later without an internet connection. \nRight now not EVERYTHING is available for download but there's definitely a huge chunk! Netflix said it will add more series and movies to download in the future. \nOriginal series including “Orange Is the New Black,”“Narcos,”“House of Cards,”“Stranger Things,”“Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt,”“Master of None” and “The Crown” are available for download starting Wednesday. Other titles available for offline viewing include TV shows “Supernatural,”“The Office,”“The Flash” and “The 100,” and animated movies “Minions” and “Home.” Airplane mode. Road trip mode.

      "text": "SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Netflix subscribers can now binge on many of their favorite shows and movies even when they don&apos;t have an internet connection.\nThe long-awaited offline option announced Wednesday gives Netflix&apos;s 87 million subscribers offline access to videos for the first time in the streaming service&apos;s decade-long history.\nNetflix is matching a downloading feature that one of its biggest rivals, Amazon.com, has been offering to its video subscribers for the past year. It&apos;s something that also has been available on YouTube&apos;s popular video site, though a subscription is required in the U.S. and other countries where the site sells its \"Red\" premium service.\nThe new feature puts Netflix a step ahead of two other major rivals. Offline options aren&apos;t available on HBO&apos;s internet-only package, HBO Now, or Hulu, although that service has publicly said it hopes to introduce a downloading feature.\nNetflix subscribers wishing to download a video on their smartphone or tablet need to update the app on their Apple or Android device.\nNot all of the selections in Netflix&apos;s video library can be downloaded, although several of the service&apos;s most popular shows, including \"Orange Is The New Black,\" &apos;&apos;House of Cards,\" and \"Stranger Things,\" are now available to watch offline.\nDownloadable movies include \"Spotlight,\" this year&apos;s Oscar winner for best film. Notably missing from the downloadable menu are movies and TV shows made by Walt Disney Co. Those still require an internet connection to watch on Netflix.\nThe Los Gatos, California, company is promising to continue to adding more titles to its offline roster.\nNetflix CEO Reed Hastings had long resisted calls for an offline-viewing option, much to the frustration of customers who wanted flexibility to use their subscriptions to watch a show or movie when traveling on a train, plane or car where internet connections are spotty or completely unavailable.\nEarlier this year, Hastings finally indicated he might relent and introduce downloading.\nThe change of heart coincided with Netflix&apos;s expansion into more than 130 countries, including many areas with shoddy or expensive internet connections that make the ability to watch video offline even more appealing.\nNetflix ended September with 39 million subscribers outside of the U.S.\nThe offline option may accelerate the decline of Netflix&apos;s steadily shrinking DVD-by-mail service, which offers the ability to watch video without an internet connection. Netflix&apos;s DVD side still has one distinct advantage - access to recent theatrical releases before they are available for streaming.\nNetflix&apos;s DVD service ended September with 4.3 million subscribers, a decrease of nearly 10 million customers during the past five years.\n ",

      "text": "TV 28 mins ago \n“ Haters Back Off ” star Angela Kinsey is finding little on the side of hate these days as awards buzz and critical praise mount for her turn as downtrodden Bethany, mother to Miranda Sings ( Colleen Ballinger ), on the Netflix laffer. Kinsey chatted with Gold Derby recently ( watch above ) about not just the reception the show has received but her reaction to receiving career-best reviews such as one from Robert Lloyd ( Los Angeles Times ), who says “Kinsey … owns the show. She takes the series from a twisted lark to something deeper and grander.” Sign up to get Gold Derby’s free newsletter with experts’ latest predictions and breaking news \n“It feels really great,” Kinsey says, “because I think a lot of times as a character actress — and that’s what I am, a character actress, I’ve never been the leading lady — you sort of are in the background a little bit, so it’s nice when the character actor gets to anchor a show emotionally.” \n“Haters Back Off” is a take on YouTube star Miranda Sings’s family life and mission to become as famous as she possibly can get. In real life Ballinger’s character Miranda Sings is a YouTube sensation with over seven million subscribers and over a billion views on her channel. Dish ‘Haters Back Off’ with Hollywood insiders in our notorious forums \nAs famous as Miranda Sings may be from a social media perspective, Kinsey admits she had never heard of her before she auditioned for the show, and she was curious how the YouTube videos would translate to a series, but her questions were quickly answered: “I read the pilot, and that’s what really got it for me. The whole time I was there I kept feeling like I was part of something unique. I felt like that when I did ‘The Office,’ and that was exciting for me. I knew some people would love it and some people would be like ‘I don’t get it,’ but just the fact that I was part of something that different was fun and exciting.” \nKinsey felt those similarities between “The Office” and “Haters Back Off,” and Ballinger’s transformation into Miranda also brought back memories of her own metamorphosis into “The Office’s” Angela Martin: “I met her as Colleen and then she went right into Miranda. It’s such a cool thing to see happen in her face. I really respect it because you really see the shift. Jenna Fischer would always say that I did that when I became Angela Martin. We’d be talking and then they’d be like ‘rolling, settling, and action!’ and then I would just become dead inside.” Photo Gallery: Top 10 Best Moments from ‘Haters Back Off’ \nPart of the draw for Kinsey in playing Bethany was that it was a role unlike her “The Office” character: Angela was known for her judgmental and sarcastic remarks, while Bethany is on the opposite side of the spectrum. “Part of Bethany has given up, and then this small part of her still has hope. She wants to find a partner, and she wants to be pretty, and she wants people to see her, and all of that is going on at the same time in this household with her idiot brother and her daughters who sort of don’t appreciate her, and it made it very compelling to me to play.” \nSo what would Angela Martin say about Bethany, and which “The Office” alum would Kinsey like to see guest star on “Haters Back Off”?

Netflix subscribers can now download shows and movies to watch later when they’re not online, like during a flight or car. The download option was added to phone and tablet apps Wednesday, Nov. 30, 2016. (AP Photo/Elise Amendola, File) \nSAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Netflix subscribers can now binge on many of their favorite shows and movies even when they don't have an internet connection. \nThe long-awaited offline option announced Wednesday gives Netflix's 87 million subscribers offline access to videos for the first time in the streaming service's decade-long history. \nNetflix is matching a downloading feature that one of its biggest rivals, Amazon.com , has been offering to its video subscribers for the past year. It's something that also has been available on YouTube's popular video site, though a subscription is required in the U.S. and other countries where the site sells its \"Red\" premium service. \nThe new feature puts Netflix a step ahead of two other major rivals. Offline options aren't available on HBO's internet-only package, HBO Now, or Hulu, although that service has publicly said it hopes to introduce a downloading feature. \nNetflix subscribers wishing to download a video on their smartphone or tablet need to update the app on their Apple or Android device. \nNot all of the selections in Netflix's video library can be downloaded, although several of the service's most popular shows, including \"Orange Is The New Black,\" ''House of Cards,\" and \"Stranger Things,\" are now available to watch offline. \nDownloadable movies include \"Spotlight,\" this year's Oscar winner for best film. Notably missing from the downloadable menu are movies and TV shows made by Walt Disney Co. Those still require an internet connection to watch on Netflix. \nThe Los Gatos, California, company is promising to continue to adding more titles to its offline roster. \nNetflix CEO Reed Hastings had long resisted calls for an offline-viewing option, much to the frustration of customers who wanted flexibility to use their subscriptions to watch a show or movie when traveling on a train, plane or car where internet connections are spotty or completely unavailable. \nEarlier this year, Hastings finally indicated he might relent and introduce downloading.

Netflix's DVD side still has one distinct advantage — access to recent theatrical releases before they are available for streaming. \nNetflix's DVD service ended September with 4.3 million subscribers, a decrease of nearly 10 million customers during the past five years.

      "text": "SAN FRANCISCO — Netflix subscribers can now binge on many of their favourite shows and movies even when they don't have an internet connection. The long-awaited offline option announced Wednesday gives Netflix's 87 million subscribers offline access to videos for the first time in the streaming service's decade-long history.\nNetflix is matching a downloading feature that one of its biggest rivals, Amazon.com, has been offering to its video subscribers for the past year. It's something that also has been available on YouTube's popular video site, though a subscription is required in the U.S. and other countries where the site sells its \"Red\" premium service.\nThe new feature puts Netflix a step ahead of two other major rivals. Offline options aren't available on HBO's internet-only package, HBO Now, or Hulu, although that service has publicly said it hopes to introduce a downloading feature.\nNetflix subscribers wishing to download a video on their smartphone or tablet need to update the app on their Apple or Android device.\nNot all of the selections in Netflix's video library can be downloaded, although several of the service's most popular shows, including \"Orange Is The New Black,\" ''House of Cards,\" and \"Stranger Things,\" are now available to watch offline.\nDownloadable movies include \"Spotlight,\" this year's Oscar winner for best film. Notably missing from the downloadable menu are movies and TV shows made by Walt Disney Co. Those still require an internet connection to watch on Netflix.\nThe Los Gatos, California, company is promising to continue to adding more titles to its offline roster.\nNetflix CEO Reed Hastings had long resisted calls for an offline-viewing option, much to the frustration of customers who wanted flexibility to use their subscriptions to watch a show or movie when travelling on a train, plane or car where internet connections are spotty or completely unavailable.\nEarlier this year, Hastings finally indicated he might relent and introduce downloading.\nThe change of heart coincided with Netflix's expansion into more than 130 countries, including many areas with shoddy or expensive internet connections that make the ability to watch video offline even more appealing.\nNetflix ended September with 39 million subscribers outside of the U.S.\nThe offline option may accelerate the decline of Netflix's steadily shrinking DVD-by-mail service, which offers the ability to watch video without an internet connection. Netflix's DVD side still has one distinct advantage — access to recent theatrical releases before they are available for streaming.\nNetflix's DVD service ended September with 4.3 million subscribers, a decrease of nearly 10 million customers during the past five years.\nMichael Liedtke, The Associated Press",

Netflix announced on Wednesday members now have the option to download movies and shows to watch offline later. This means you can finally watch the new season of Stranger Things and Bloodline while on a flight or stuck in the subway. By Sara Ashley O'Brien \nNEW YORK (CNNMoney) -- It just got even easier to binge on Netflix. \nNetflix announced on Wednesday members now have the option to download movies and shows to watch offline later. This means you can finally watch the new season of Stranger Things and Bloodline while on a flight or stuck in the subway. \nThe feature comes free of cost with all Netflix memberships. Members will want to make sure they have the most recent Netflix app on their Android or iOS devices to access the new \"download\" button. \nUp until now, you needed a place with a reliable internet connection to access the streaming service. But Netflix wants to make its product more nimble to suit the lives of those on the go. \nYou'll find Orange Is the New Black, Narcos and The Crown available -- but you can't download everything. Shows like the new season of Gilmore Girls, Friends and New Girl are restricted for now. \nThe company previously argued the feature was unnecessary, calling it a \"short term fix for a bigger problem.\" That problem, of course, being wireless internet availability. \nBut its competitor Amazon Prime embraced offline downloads for iOS and Android users more than a year ago. \nAccording to Netflix's Help Center page, \"you'll want to delete\" downloaded titles before attempting to download new content. \nThat's because some licensing agreements have limits on the number of titles people can download at the same time. The length of time Netflix users will have to watch a show or movie will vary by title. The \"My Downloads\" page will show members how long, such as 48 hours, they have with each title. \nThe company said in an email to CNNMoney it is working with \"lots\" of partners globally on securing downloading rights \"for the bulk of the content on our service.\" \nTM &© 2016 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

      "text": "Email \nNEW YORK — You can now Netflix and chill without internet connection. \nNetflix is allowing users to download their favorite TV shows and movies on its streaming services to watch offline. The company announced Friday that the new feature will be available worldwide. \n\"While many members enjoy watching Netflix at home, we’ve often heard they also want to continue their Stranger Things binge while on airplanes and other places where Internet is expensive or limited,\" the streaming service wrote in a press release . Airplane mode. Road trip mode. Stuck-in-the-subway-for-20-minutes mode. Your favorite stories are now available for download any time. pic.twitter.com/g7QZA3TyE8 \n— Netflix US (@netflix) November 30, 2016 \nSo Netflix lovers will no longer have to worry about data usage or searching for the nearest wifi connection. \nOnly a few shows, such as \"Orange is the New Black,\" \"Narcos\" and \"The Crown\" are available for download, but Netflix promises more will be added in the near future. \nThe feature is available for all phones and tablets on Android and iOS. \nNetflix seems to be a latecomer to the offline-streaming world. Amazon offers an offline viewing option for select movies and TV shows on its Instant Video service. Epix and Starz also have the same service.",

      "text": "Email \nNEW YORK (CNNMoney) — It just got even easier to binge on Netflix. \nNetflix announced on Wednesday members now have the option to download movies and shows to watch offline later. This means you can finally watch Gilmore Girls and Stranger Things while on a flight or stuck in the subway. \nThe feature comes free of cost with all Netflix memberships. \nUp until now, you need a place with a reliable internet connection to access the streaming service. But Netflix wants to make its product more nimble to suit the lives of those on-the-go. \nThe company previously argued the feature was unnecessary, calling it a “short term fix for a bigger problem.” That problem, of course, being wireless internet availability. \nBut its competitor Amazon Prime embraced offline downloads for iOS and Android users more than a year ago. \nAccording to Netflix’s Help Center page, “you’ll want to delete” downloaded titles before attempting to download a new content. \nIt is unclear as of now if there’s a cap on how many shows or films people can download at once. \nNetflix did not immediately respond to CNNMoney’s request for comment ",

      "text": "Netflix Inc. is making some TV shows and movies available for download to watch offline, providing its users a feature that has become a must-have for binge-watchers.\nMany fans have requested to watch Netflix content without an internet connection, especially those in emerging markets with limited internet access. The world's largest online TV network will roll out the feature on phones and tablets for all subscribers, but only for select shows such as \"The Crown\" and \"Orange is the New Black\" at first, according to a statement Wednesday.\nNetflix has been signaling it would add a downloading option in recent months, as a way to continue increasing its subscriber base and match video-streaming Amazon.com. Offline viewing will make Netflix shows more accessible to customers around the world, particularly in developing markets in Asia and Africa.\nNetflix has 86.7 million customers worldwide, 47.5 million of whom live in the U.S. The company now relies on international markets for most of its growth, and earlier this year expanded its footprint to the entire world, save for China, Syria, North Korea and Crimea.\n\"While many members enjoy watching Netflix at home, we've often heard they also want to continue their 'Stranger Things' binge while on airplanes and other places where internet is expensive or limited,\" said Eddy Wu, Netflix's director of product innovation, in a web post.\nPrivacy Policy Copyright © 2016, Chicago Tribune",

Now, thanks in large part to a new deal between the service and Disney, some of the year's biggest hits are coming to Netflix just a few months after they were in theaters. \nFor December, the big news among new movies on Netflix is Captain America: Civil War . It's the second-highest-grossing movie of 2016, and it's going to be available for streaming before the end of the year. You'll have to wait until Christmas Day to see it on Netflix, though. \nYou won't have to wait nearly as long to see The Angry Birds Movie , which was a hit, at least briefly, in the late spring of this year. The Angry Birds come to Netflix on December. \nAlso new this month will be the Obama biopic Barry and the classic comedy National Lampoon's Animal House . \nIf you prefer TV, look for new seasons of Fuller House , White Rabbit Project, My Little Pony Friendship is Magic , Captive and Trollhunters.

In order to do so, the Netflix app must be updated to the most recent version for phones and tablets on Android and iOS. \nThe download ability allows for offline playback and so members can continue to binge watch in places where internet is expensive or limited. All they have to do click the download button on the details page for a film or TV series and the series can be watched later without an internet connection. \nQuite a few series and movies are already available for download, with more expected to have that capacity shortly. Netflix originals like Orange Is the New Black, Narcos and The Crown are available to download now. Airplane mode. Road trip mode. Stuck-in-the-subway-for-20-minutes mode.

It's something that also has been available on YouTube's popular video site, though a subscription is required in the U.S. and other countries where the site sells its \"Red\" premium service. \nThe new feature puts Netflix a step ahead of two other major rivals. Offline options aren't available on HBO's internet-only package, HBO Now, or Hulu, although that service has publicly said it hopes to introduce a downloading feature. \nNetflix subscribers wishing to download a video on their smartphone or tablet need to update the app on their Apple or Android device. \nNot all of the selections in Netflix's video library can be downloaded, although several of the service's most popular shows, including \"Orange Is The New Black,\" ''House of Cards,\" and \"Stranger Things,\" are now available to watch offline. \nDownloadable movies include \"Spotlight,\" this year's Oscar winner for best film. Notably missing from the downloadable menu are movies and TV shows made by Walt Disney Co. Those still require an internet connection to watch on Netflix. \nThe Los Gatos, California, company is promising to continue to adding more titles to its offline roster. \nNetflix CEO Reed Hastings had long resisted calls for an offline-viewing option, much to the frustration of customers who wanted flexibility to use their subscriptions to watch a show or movie when traveling on a train, plane or car where internet connections are spotty or completely unavailable. \nEarlier this year, Hastings finally indicated he might relent and introduce downloading. \nThe change of heart coincided with Netflix's expansion into more than 130 countries, including many areas with shoddy or expensive internet connections that make the ability to watch video offline even more appealing. \nNetflix ended September with 39 million subscribers outside of the U.S. \nThe offline option may accelerate the decline of Netflix's steadily shrinking DVD-by-mail service, which offers the ability to watch video without an internet connection. Netflix's DVD side still has one distinct advantage — access to recent theatrical releases before they are available for streaming. \nNetflix's DVD service ended September with 4.3 million subscribers, a decrease of nearly 10 million customers during the past five years. \n  Photos",

It’s seen as an especially attractive feature for many overseas markets where subscribers can’t depend on a consistently strong internet connection. \nNetflix shares are up 1.9% in early trading. \nAmazon Prime has allowed users to download many of its programs since September.

The popular streaming service announced Wednesday (Nov. 30) catching up on shows will be easier with the introduction of the offline download feature, which allows you to watch your favorite shows without Internet access. Now, whether you’re stuck on a long car ride or a tiring flight, Netflix has got your back. Airplane mode. Road trip mode. Stuck-in-the-subway-for-20-minutes mode. Your favorite stories are now available for download any time. pic.twitter.com/g7QZA3TyE8 Read: Dave Chappelle Is Rich Forever Thanks To New Netflix Deal \n“While many members enjoy watching Netflix at home, we’ve often heard they also want to continue their Stranger Things binge while on airplanes and other places where Internet is expensive or limited,” said Eddy Wu, Netflix’s director of product innovation. “Just click the download button on the details page for a film or TV series and you can watch it later without an internet connection.” \nMake sure to head over to the “Available For Download” section to see if the show you are about to binge-watch is open to offline viewing. Shows like Narcos and Orange Is The New Black are the first to test out the new feature on Android and iOS, but other content is reportedly “on the way” as well. \nAvoiding your annoying family members while traveling just got a little easier.

It's something that also has been available on YouTube's popular video site, though a subscription is required in the U.S. and other countries where the site sells its \"Red\" premium service. \nThe new feature puts Netflix a step ahead of two other major rivals. Offline options aren't available on HBO's internet-only package, HBO Now, or Hulu, although that service has publicly said it hopes to introduce a downloading feature. \nNetflix subscribers wishing to download a video on their smartphone or tablet need to update the app on their Apple or Android device. \nNot all of the selections in Netflix's video library can be downloaded, although several of the service's most popular shows, including \"Orange Is The New Black,\" ''House of Cards,\" and \"Stranger Things,\" are now available to watch offline. \nDownloadable movies include \"Spotlight,\" this year's Oscar winner for best film. Notably missing from the downloadable menu are movies and TV shows made by Walt Disney Co. Those still require an internet connection to watch on Netflix. \nThe Los Gatos, California, company is promising to continue to adding more titles to its offline roster. \nNetflix CEO Reed Hastings had long resisted calls for an offline-viewing option, much to the frustration of customers who wanted flexibility to use their subscriptions to watch a show or movie when traveling on a train, plane or car where internet connections are spotty or completely unavailable. \nEarlier this year, Hastings finally indicated he might relent and introduce downloading. \nThe change of heart coincided with Netflix's expansion into more than 130 countries, including many areas with shoddy or expensive internet connections that make the ability to watch video offline even more appealing. \nNetflix ended September with 39 million subscribers outside of the U.S. \nThe offline option may accelerate the decline of Netflix's steadily shrinking DVD-by-mail service, which offers the ability to watch video without an internet connection. Netflix's DVD side still has one distinct advantage - access to recent theatrical releases before they are available for streaming. \nNetflix's DVD service ended September with 4.3 million subscribers, a decrease of nearly 10 million customers during the past five years.

      "text": "SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Netflix subscribers can now binge on many of their favorite shows and movies even when they don’t have an internet connection.\nThe long-awaited offline option announced Wednesday gives Netflix’s 87 million subscribers offline access to videos for the first time in the streaming service’s decade-long history.\nNetflix is matching a downloading feature that one of its biggest rivals, Amazon.com, has been offering to its video subscribers for the past year. It’s something that also has been available on YouTube’s popular video site, though a subscription is required in the U.S. and other countries where the site sells its “Red” premium service.\nThe new feature puts Netflix a step ahead of two other major rivals.

      "text": "\nScreengrab via Gilmore Life/YouTube Get your Netflix ready. \nWith last week’s release of Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life , fans got a chance to get the ending they had long been deprived of, while new fans finally had a reason to cross the show off their watch list. But if you’re one of the people who’s always been meaning to stream the show but never had time, we’re here for you. \nGilmore Girls originally ran for seven years. These are not the new normal of 13-episode seasons, but network hauls that lead to six- and seven-disc DVD sets. So that means the seven seasons are 22 course meals apiece. That’s 154 courses for you to catch up with, and that math is making my stomach turn just typing it out. \nAs someone who’s been through the show a gloriously obscene number of times I can ease your pain. I’ve combed over the series and made a list of 10 must-see episodes. These can serve as an appetizer to convince you to commit to a pilot-to-finale watch, or be your CliffsNotes guide before you watch A Year in the Life . Whichever route you choose, grab your coffeecoffeecoffee , cue up Netflix , and settle in. 1) 'Pilot' (season 1, episode 1) Starting at the beginning is obvious, but for a show with such a distinct voice it’s a good idea to use this as a way to get on the show’s wavelength before it really starts bringing the heat. (Bonus viewing: “Dear Emily and Richard” from season 3 provides a great deal of exposition on pre-“Pilot” events). 2) ‘Rory’s Birthday Parties’ (season 1, episode 6) Rory turns 16 and her upper-crust grandparents throw her a party to compete with a more standard (re: fun) party thrown by her mom. It highlights the show’s bread and butter themes (familial discord and class divide). 3) ‘Nick & Nora/Sid & Nancy’ (season 2, episode 6) Everyone’s favorite leather-clad brooder, Jess, makes his debut—and quite the mark on an impressionable Rory. 4) ‘The Bracebridge Dinner’ (season 2, episode 10) Two of Gilmore ’s trademarks (quirky small-town events and dinner scenes) are on display here. The Rory-Dean-Jess love triangle becomes angle-ier, and the Jess-Dean scenes are always a treat. 5) ‘They Shoot Gilmores, Don’t They?’ (season 3, episode 7) This 10-episode pack is meant to save you time, here we’re jumping ahead to the inevitable conclusion of Dean versus Jess. This episode, set largely at Stars Hollow’s annual 24-hour dance marathon, is a top-three Gilmore outing. 6) ‘Max! Keg!’ (season 3, episode 19) We all need more Jess and Dean conflict. Hep Alien has their debut show at a house party, Jess and Dean are the closing act. (Bonus viewing: Let Netflix roll into the next episode and stay for the cold open, which shows the morning after the party brawl.) 7) ‘Festival of Living Art’ (season 4, episode 7) Of all the events seen on Gilmore , the titular festival is among the most eccentric and impressive. The town comes together to recreate famous pieces of art, which makes for an oddly dramatic climax of watching people be completely still. It’s also a great showcase for the supporting players. 8) ‘Raincoats and Recipes’ (season 4, episode 22) This is the best episode of the show. Long-gestating tension between Luke and Lorelai, and Rory and Dean, finally pays off. It’s worth the 87-episode wait. 9) ‘We Got Us a Pippi Virgin’ (season 5, episode 5) Poor Dean can’t catch a break. One of the series’ running themes is that Rory’s suitors are never good enough. Dean is the butt of that one again, but this time the judgement is coming from working man’s hero (and the proto-Dean) Luke. 10) ‘Wedding Bell Blues’ (season 5, episode 13) Congratulations, after this one you’re now equipped to take a side in the “Team Dean,” “Team Jess,” “Team Logan” shipping that divides the show’s fans faster than the show’s theme song can bring them together. This one has everything Gilmore fans have come to love: Emily-Lorelai drama, Luke-Lorelai drama, Christopher-Lorelai drama, Rory-Logan drama. All that drama and the show still has time for some immaculate punchlines. ",

      "text": "Netflix offers downloadable shows so subscribers can watch without streaming \nNEW YORK —It just got even easier to binge on Netflix. \nNetflix announced on Wednesday members now have the option to download movies and shows to watch offline later. This means you can finally watch Gilmore Girls and Stranger Things while on a flight or stuck in the subway. \nThe feature comes free of cost with all Netflix memberships. \nUp until now, you need a place with a reliable internet connection to access the streaming service. But Netflix wants to make its product more nimble to suit the lives of those on-the-go. \nThe company previously argued the feature was unnecessary, calling it a “short term fix for a bigger problem.” That problem, of course, being wireless internet availability. \nBut its competitor Amazon Prime embraced offline downloads for iOS and Android users more than a year ago. \nAccording to Netflix’s Help Center page, “you’ll want to delete” downloaded titles before attempting to download a new content. \nIt is unclear as of now if there’s a cap on how many shows or films people can download at once. \nNetflix said the feature is included in all plans and available for phones and tablets on Android and iOS. From the company’s announcement: \nTo start downloading today, please update your Netflix app to the most recent version and take us with you to enjoy Netflix everywhere you go. If you have any questions, please visit our Help Center. \nNetflix did not immediately respond to CNNMoney’s request for comment ",

      "text": "Courtesy Netflix Stay on target You Can Finally Watch (Some) Netflix Videos Offline The First Full A Series of Unfortunate Events Trailer “I don’t think I’m ready to go down this rabbit hole,” said Tory Belleci in the first trailer for White Rabbit Project , a show that I hope features at least one Alice in Wonderland reference per episode.\nThe trailer, which was released Monday, shows Belleci, Kari Byron, and Grant Imahara teaming up once again for the new Netflix series, which works as an extension of their work on Mythbusters .\nThe synopsis says the team will be ranking “history’s greatest inventions, heists and more.” From the trailer, we can see that the trio will be touching upon at least one prison escape, an airplane heist (most likely the D.B Cooper hijacking), and a lot of drinking.\nOther things to look out for: explosions, ridiculous weapons, crazy costumes, and even more explosions. It’s like Mythbusters never left.\nThe final season of Mythbusters was sad for a number of reasons, including the fact it had been on for over a decade by that point, but it was also missing the Build Team. Byron, Belleci, and Imahara were let go by the network in 2014 due to money disputes and as a way to keep the show fresh after ratings were dropping .\nEven as the team was on the way out, hosts Adam Savage and Jamie Hyneman wished them the best.\n“It has been a total pleasure not only to work with you but to call you our friends,” Savage said, “We wish you the very best of luck and thank you.”\nSavage sent his regards to the team on Twitter following the trailer announcement.\nI can't wait to check White Rabbit Project out. Congrats to @KariByron @ToryBelleci and @grantimahara ! @netflix https://t.co/6BvOHmrjkP \n— Adam Savage (@donttrythis) November 28, 2016 \n\nWhite Rabbit Project will premiere on Netflix on Dec. 9. As is Netflix tradition, all episodes of the first season will be available.",

      "text": " Netflix will now let you download videos and watch them offline Tech Insider 2 hrs ago Steve Kovach © Bloomberg Netflix announced Wednesday that it will let you download videos and watch them even if your device isn't connected to the internet.\nHowever, there appear to be some limitations. Not all videos will work with the new offline mode. Netflix hasn't released a full list of compatible shows, but it appears to mostly include Netflix Originals like \"Narcos\" and \"Stranger Things.\" It's unclear how many licensed titles from third parties will be availble to download.\nAmazon Video, which offers thousands of free TV shows and movies for Prime members, lets you download just about any video for offline viewing. Netflix appears to be taking a more cautious approach to video downloads for now.\nNetflix downloads work on iOS and Android devices. You'll need to update your Netflix app to the latest version, which is rolling out Wednesday. A download button will appear next to the videos you can store for offline viewing.\nLike this:\n© Provided by Business Insider Inc Netflix Netflix has historically been against allowing offline viewing, even as recently as the end of last year. But executives have loosened their opposition to video downloads this year , leading many to speculate it'd happen soon. Well, here it is, even if it's pretty limited for now.\nHere's the announcement, which was tweeted by Netflix:\nAirplane mode. Road trip mode. Stuck-in-the-subway-for-20-minutes mode. Your favorite stories are now available for download any time. pic.twitter.com/g7QZA3TyE8\n— Netflix US (@netflix) November 30, 2016\nGo to MSN Home",

      "text": "— Netflix US (@netflix) November 30, 2016 \nNetflix just introduced a feature we’ve basically been waiting for since its creation: the ability to watch our favorite TV shows sans internet. \nStuck on the subway for the third time this week? At your relatives who don’t understand the concept of Wi-Fi? On a plane with no in-flight entertainment? Now, you can take your binge-watching addiction with you wherever you go. \nAccording to a post from the company , once members update their Netflix app, a button will appear that allows you to download individual episodes. Many are already available (like Orange is the New Black , Narcos , and The Crown ), while others are coming soon. \nHere’s a list of some Netflix originals to consider adding to your bingeing docket. If you thought you were addicted to your phone before, just you wait! On the flip side, holiday traveling just got a teensy bit less agitating. NYLON Video",

      "text": "Could there be better news? As of today, Netflix 's mobile apps will let you download content for offline viewing. That's awesome news for anyone who wants to stock up on videos for the gym, the airplane, the car (passengers only, please) or anywhere else that's Wi-Fi-challenged.\nFirst things first: Make room for all those downloads. Find out how to free up extra space on your Android phone or tablet . iOS users, check out these 5 tricks to free up space -- and this weird trick that might net you extra gigabytes.\nWith that out of the way, let's turn our attention to TV. Not everything in the Netflix library is available for download (no \"Bob's Burgers\" or \"Sherlock\"?!), but there's plenty of good material you can get right now. Here are nine shows you'll want to download for your on-the-go binges.\n'30 Rock' I can't recall another comedy from the past decade that made me laugh out loud as hard or as often as \"30 Rock.\" Tina Fey's brilliant single-camera series about a late-night sketch-comedy show debuted alongside Aaron Sorkin's similarly themed dramedy \"Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip,\" which was expected to crush its cast-of-unknowns competitor. But \"30 Rock\" ran for seven glorious seasons, while Sorkin's show lasted just one. \n'Arrow' and 'The Flash' You don't have to be a fan of the source material -- I should know, because I wasn't -- to enjoy these two action-packed comic-book series. \"Arrow,\" a modern take on the \"Green Arrow\" comics, started out a little slow, but really hit its stride in season 2. \"The Flash,\" meanwhile, hit the ground (sorry) running, with a superb first season buoyed by a great cast.\n'Black Mirror' It's hard to describe this as anything but a \"'Twilight Zone' for the 21st century,\" because \"Black Mirror\" is a collection of trippy, standalone stories that leave you chilled. Each expertly crafted episode -- just three each in the first two seasons, and a blessed six in the recent made-for-Netflix third -- explores some uneasy aspect of the modern world and how technology can lead us down dark roads.\n'Freaks and Geeks' I recently rewatched this entire 1999 series -- just 18 episodes, sigh -- with my kids, and I'm happy to report it holds up really well. It's just as funny, awkward, touching and occasionally painful as ever, with a cast of extremely familiar faces -- many of whom went on to varying levels of stardom. (James Franco and Seth Rogen, anyone?) Even if you didn't grow up in the early '80s (I did) and didn't identify as either a freak or geek (I did), you can't help but love every single character in this show.\n'Love' Normally I wouldn't bother watching a show with such a vague (and ultimately misleading) title, but because I so liked Gillian Jacobs in \"Community,\" I decided to give this Judd Apatow-produced series a chance. I'm glad I did, because although it features two frequently unlikable leads, it delivers what feels like a very realistic look at modern single life. In fact, it's arguably the perfect West Coast companion to my next pick...\n'Master of None' Photo by Netflix If you know Aziz Ansari only as his somewhat annoying one-note character on \"Parks and Recreation,\" you owe it to yourself to check out his Netflix original series, \"Master of None.\" It's a smart, funny, honest and insightful look at life in your late '20s (or maybe early '30s), with episodes that focus on everything from dating to parents (having them and becoming them) to old people. It's the New York answer to \"Love,\" but with more amusing and touching moments than cringe-worthy ones.\n'Orange is the New Black' What started out as a novelty show -- entitled white girl goes to prison -- has evolved into one of the most rich and diverse series I've ever seen. Indeed, right around the middle of Season 2, the show stops focusing primarily on Piper and grows into a superb ensemble, branching out its back-stories to include seemingly minor characters -- who often turn out to be even more interesting than the main ones. Just take note that this is a TV-MA show, definitely one for adults only.\n'Stranger Things' The TV equivalent of a book you cannot put down , Netflix-original \"Stranger Things\" spans eight amazing episodes of '80s-themed mystery, horror, sci-fi and friendship. Indeed, if you liked \"The Goonies,\" \"E.T.\" and/or \"Stand By Me,\" you'll love this. Even the casting harks back to the '80s: Hello, Matthew Modine and Winona Ryder! \nOK, those are my picks -- now let's hear yours! And check back soon for my list of must-download movies.\n ",

Road trip mode. Stuck-in-the-subway-for-20-minutes mode. Your favorite stories are now available for download any time,” Netflix tweeted. \nThe new feature is included in all Netflix plans and already has a range of content available including all of Netflix’s original shows.\nWhen users are connected to the Internet, a download button will appear next to the play button of shows that can be saved.\nUsers can choose two different quality options — standard, which is a lower resolution that requires less storage space and downloads faster, and higher, which takes up more space on the device and will take longer to download.\nThe offline library will continually be updated with more content, but already has dozens of hit shows like “Breaking Bad” and “Mad Men,” kids movies including “Kung Fu Panda 3” and “Minions” as well as award-winning films like “Boyhood,” Good Will Hunting” and “Nightcrawler.”\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google WhatsApp Email Copy",

      "title": "How To Download Netflix Videos",
      "text": "by Rexly Peñaflorida November 30, 2016 at 3:51 PM \nBy now, you’ve heard that Netflix now allows users to download movies and TV shows on mobile devices , but how do you actually access the full list of titles available for download? Well, you’ve come to the right place. We’ll show you how to download a TV show or movie from Netflix, as well as important settings for the download as well. Locating And Downloading Content \nTo access the movies and shows available for download, all you need to do is find the “Available for Download” section on the app’s sidebar. From there, you can view the massive lineup of content available for offline viewing. Just like the homepage, the app spreads the videos in the download section out into multiple categories such as New Releases, Recently Added and recommendations based on a show or movie you previously watched. From there, just tap on your favorite show or movie (that’s available on the list) and press the download button. To view your now-offline content, go to the My Downloads tab in the sidebar. \nIf you go back to the sidebar and scroll down to the App Settings tab, you can see multiple options such as the ability to delete all downloaded content from your device and restricting downloads to a Wi-Fi connection. There’s even a handy storage bar that shows how much space each episode or movie takes up on your phone. iOS Versus Android \nHowever, there’s a major difference between the iOS and Android versions of the Netflix app. For iOS users, there’s an additional option to change the video quality of the downloaded content. By default, the video quality is set to \"Standard,\" but you can change it to the \"Higher\" setting. Obviously, the Higher video quality means a larger file size. For some reason, this option isn’t available on Android devices. I downloaded the first episode of Stranger Things on both Standard and Higher settings on an iPhone 6 as well as on an Android device (HTC 10). As you can see below, all three files are different sizes. It's unclear as to why the file sizes between iOS and Android devices are different, although you could chalk it up to varying file types or encoding methods. Stranger Things Episode 1 File Size iPhone 6 (Standard quality)",

      "text": "Tweet \nIn case 2016 wasn't already full of enough unprecedented changes in the world, here's another one. Netflix has now done what they said they'd never do : allow users to download movies to watch offline. \nSince its inception, Netflix has insisted that movies streamed on its service had to be, well, streamed. A while ago Netflix' biggest competitor, Amazon, gave its users the ability to download videos for offline viewing, but even then Netflix drew a hard line in the sand about it. Their logic, at the time , was that users don't really want to spend all their time managing the storage of their content. They don't want to deal with downloads and space management. They just want to press play and watch something instantly. \nBut that was a year ago. Amazon's video business has continued to thrive and expand globally and Netflix has finally given in to match the competition's features. Kind of. \nAs of now the download option is only available on some of Netflix's offerings. Its original shows, like Stranger Things and Orange is the New Black , have it, but they've also enabled the download option for non-Netflix productions as well. At this early stage you basically need to update your Netflix mobile app and check for downloadable titles on a case-by-case basis as they continue to expand what can be stored offline.",

This means you can finally watch Gilmore Girls and Stranger Things while on a flight or stuck in the subway. \nThe feature comes free of cost with all Netflix memberships. \nUp until now, you need a place with a reliable internet connection to access the streaming service. But Netflix wants to make its product more nimble to suit the lives of those on-the-go. \nThe company previously argued the feature was unnecessary, calling it a \"short term fix for a bigger problem.\" That problem, of course, being wireless internet availability. \nBut its competitor Amazon Prime embraced offline downloads for iOS and Android users more than a year ago. \nAccording to Netflix's Help Center page, \"you'll want to delete\" downloaded titles before attempting to download a new content. \nIt is unclear as of now if there's a cap on how many shows or films people can download at once. \nNetflix did not immediately respond to CNNMoney's request for comment \nThe-CNN-Wire™&© 2016 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

      "text": "Binge watching on Netflix no longer requires internet access   2:10 PM EST 0 Share MICHAEL LIEDTKE The Associated Press \nSAN FRANCISCO (AP) - Netflix subscribers can now binge on many of their favorite shows and movies even when they don't have an internet connection. \nThe long-awaited offline option announced Wednesday gives Netflix's 87 million subscribers offline access to videos for the first time in the streaming service's decade-long history. \nNetflix is matching a downloading feature that one of its biggest rivals, Amazon.com, has been offering to its video subscribers for the past year. It's something that also has been available on YouTube's popular video site, though a subscription is required in the U.S. and other countries where the site sells its \"Red\" premium service. \nThe new feature puts Netflix a step ahead of two other major rivals. Offline options aren't available on HBO's internet-only package, HBO Now, or Hulu, although that service has publicly said it hopes to introduce a downloading feature. \nNetflix subscribers wishing to download a video on their smartphone or tablet need to update the app on their Apple or Android device. \nNot all of the selections in Netflix's video library can be downloaded, although several of the service's most popular shows, including \"Orange Is The New Black,\" ''House of Cards,\" and \"Stranger Things,\" are now available to watch offline. \nDownloadable movies include \"Spotlight,\" this year's Oscar winner for best film. Notably missing from the downloadable menu are movies and TV shows made by Walt Disney Co. Those still require an internet connection to watch on Netflix. \nThe Los Gatos, California, company is promising to continue to adding more titles to its offline roster. \nNetflix CEO Reed Hastings had long resisted calls for an offline-viewing option, much to the frustration of customers who wanted flexibility to use their subscriptions to watch a show or movie when traveling on a train, plane or car where internet connections are spotty or completely unavailable. \nEarlier this year, Hastings finally indicated he might relent and introduce downloading. \nThe change of heart coincided with Netflix's expansion into more than 130 countries, including many areas with shoddy or expensive internet connections that make the ability to watch video offline even more appealing. \nNetflix ended September with 39 million subscribers outside of the U.S. \nThe offline option may accelerate the decline of Netflix's steadily shrinking DVD-by-mail service, which offers the ability to watch video without an internet connection. Netflix's DVD side still has one distinct advantage - access to recent theatrical releases before they are available for streaming. \nNetflix's DVD service ended September with 4.3 million subscribers, a decrease of nearly 10 million customers during the past five years.

      "text": "View photos\nThe Netflix sign on is shown on an iPad in Encinitas, California, April 19,2013. REUTERS/Mike Blake/Files More REUTERS - Video streaming pioneer Netflix Inc has added an option that allows subscribers to download shows at no additional cost on their mobile device to watch without an internet connection.\nNetflix signaled in recent months it would add an offline viewing option to better compete as the streaming video market becomes more and more crowded. Amazon.com Inc’s rival streaming video service, Prime Video, has had this option for about a year.\nWhile the new option announced on Wednesday is available for all of Netflix’s subscribers, it could have greater appeal in international markets such as Africa and Asia, where internet service is less ubiquitous than it is in the United States.\nThe international market is becoming the main driver of growth for Netflix. Of their 86.7 million subscribers, 47.5 million of them come from the United States.\nGrowth among U.S. subscribers has slowed in 2016. Netflix added just 370,000 subscribers during the third quarter and only 4.3 million since the third quarter of last year, suggesting they are reaching a saturation point.\nIn that same time frame, Netflix has added 13.2 million international subscribers, including 3.2 million in the third quarter. Much of that has to do with Netflix’s expansion by more than 130 countries earlier this year to over 190 nations currently. China is a notable holdout.\nNot everything in Netflix’s vast library is available to download just yet, including the recently released “Gilmore Girls” revival. Currently available shows include Netflix-owned “Stranger Things,” “The Crown” and “Narcos” along with licensed shows and movies like “Parks and Recreation” and “Spotlight.”\n\"While many members enjoy watching Netflix at home, we've often heard they also want to continue their 'Stranger Things' binge while on airplanes and other places where Internet is expensive or limited,\" Eddy Wu, director of product innovation, wrote in a blog post.\nThe new feature is included in all plans and available for phones and tablets on Alphabet Inc's Android and Apple Inc's iOS platforms, the company said.\nNetflix shares rose as much as 2.4 percent before it eased, up 0.1 percent to $117.62 on Wednesday on the Nasdaq.\nThe new option received widespread praise on social media Wednesday.\n“You can now download stuff off Netflix to watch without internet,” wrote Twitter user kt (@Katie_Ottaway_), “what did we do to deserve this miracle.”\n#NetflixOffline was also the top-trending hashtag on Twitter, worldwide.\n(Reporting by Supantha Mukherjee in Bengaluru and Tim Baysinger and Amy Tennery in New York; Editing by Saumyadeb Chakrabarty and Jeffrey Benkoe)",

That’s not a problem any longer: Netflix is, as promised , finally letting you download certain shows and movies for off-line viewing.\nAccording to a press release :\nMany of your favorite streaming series and movies are already available for download, with more on the way, so there is plenty of content available for those times when you are offline. For example, Orange is The New Black , Narcos , and The Crown are available for download today. ( Via )\nEddy Wu, Netflix’s director of product innovation, said the downloads feature, which Amazon Prime Video debuted last year, was introduced because “while many members enjoy watching Netflix at home, we’ve often heard they also want to continue their Stranger Things ’ binge while on airplanes and other places where internet is expensive or limited.” There’s no need to make awkward chit-chat with strangers while 40,000 feet in the air ever again. BoJack Horseman season three is the only company you need.\nThe feature is currently available through the Netflix app for all plans.\nAirplane mode. Road trip mode. Stuck-in-the-subway-for-20-minutes mode. Your favorite stories are now available for download any time. pic.twitter.com/g7QZA3TyE8\n— Netflix US (@netflix) November 30, 2016\n(Via Netflix )",

      "text": "Binge watchers rejoice! Netflix adds \"Download & Go\" feature to mobile apps Posted By Gabriel Goodwin on Wed, Nov 30, 2016 at 3:27 PM When certain people get bored, they binge watch television shows. Its a fact. Most of us have some form of entertainment streaming capabilities - whether it be music, movies, or books - but, contrary to popular belief, there isn't always an available internet connection. Netflix looks to alleviate some of the trouble accessing content in those situations with their new \"Download and Go\" feature on mobile devices. In my limited experience with the update, not every movie and television show is available for download quite yet. There are some decent selections available. Apex (in my opinion, the best movie I saw available for download) , Meet the Blacks, Intruder, Minions, Home, and Hotel Transylvania 2 were some of the movies with \"Download & Go\" capability. Shows like Narcos, The Crown, Orange is the New Black, Stranger Things, and Bojack Horseman are also available for download to your device. There is no \"one-click\" option to download an entire season or series yet, although you can download the episodes individually. This probably should have been considered and implemented years ago because it seems like every streaming service offers (and has offered) a similar feature since their respective inception, but Netflix's accessibility across so many platforms never made the feature mandatory to me. It has been reported the feature was added to make the streaming service more marketable in countries with less reliable and/or miniscule internet access. Whatever the reason is, this feature benefits all it's subscribers and does make the service more attractive. The feature is available on all mobile devices and subscribers can begin to download shows and movies within seconds of updating the app. The device needs to have the necessary free space on its hard drive. The shows and movies can be downloaded in standard definition or high(er) definition, but file sizes are not listed. Downloads can take place over WiFi or cellular network. As a precaution, be sure you know your plan's data limits because you could (and probably will) be charged for overages. More and more content should become available in the future.",

Netflix subscribers can now download shows and movies to watch later when they’re not online, like during a flight or car. The download option was added to phone and tablet apps Wednesday, Nov. 30, 2016. (AP Photo/Elise Amendola, File) \nSAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Netflix subscribers can now binge on many of their favorite shows and movies even when they don't have an internet connection. \nThe long-awaited offline option announced Wednesday gives Netflix's 87 million subscribers offline access to videos for the first time in the streaming service's decade-long history. \nNetflix is matching a downloading feature that one of its biggest rivals, Amazon.com , has been offering to its video subscribers for the past year. It's something that also has been available on YouTube's popular video site, though a subscription is required in the U.S. and other countries where the site sells its \"Red\" premium service. \nThe new feature puts Netflix a step ahead of two other major rivals. Offline options aren't available on HBO's internet-only package, HBO Now, or Hulu, although that service has publicly said it hopes to introduce a downloading feature. \nNetflix subscribers wishing to download a video on their smartphone or tablet need to update the app on their Apple or Android device. \nNot all of the selections in Netflix's video library can be downloaded, although several of the service's most popular shows, including \"Orange Is The New Black,\" ''House of Cards,\" and \"Stranger Things,\" are now available to watch offline. \nDownloadable movies include \"Spotlight,\" this year's Oscar winner for best film. Notably missing from the downloadable menu are movies and TV shows made by Walt Disney Co. Those still require an internet connection to watch on Netflix. \nThe Los Gatos, California, company is promising to continue to adding more titles to its offline roster. \nNetflix CEO Reed Hastings had long resisted calls for an offline-viewing option, much to the frustration of customers who wanted flexibility to use their subscriptions to watch a show or movie when traveling on a train, plane or car where internet connections are spotty or completely unavailable. \nEarlier this year, Hastings finally indicated he might relent and introduce downloading.",

      "text": "Mandy Stadtmiller Rather than Netflix and chill, why not try Netflix and align (with the stars)?There are very few things I love as much as binge-watching something addictive, terrifying, hilarious, and inspiring from my queue — but astrology runs a pretty close second. And if you’ve ever read your horoscope, you know it can be pretty addictive, terrifying, hilarious, and inspiring in its own right.Which is why we decided to combine the two to come up with “Netflix Horoscopes,” mixing all the fun of astrology with the very serious matter of what to stream on TV next. (I’ve also highlighted folks involved in the production of these cinematic offerings who share your monthly sign. Trust me: It’s oddly comforting knowing your favorite actor might be facing a similar forecast ahead.)I’ll be using predictions from AstrologyClub.com (quoted throughout) to forecast your December, and hand-picking Netflix recommendations from new releases, hidden gems, and classics you may not realize are available to get you through the unique challenges of the season. And while each horoscope is tailored to your sun sign, don’t worry: You won’t send Mercury into retrograde should you decide to cheat and try out another sign’s recs.

      "text": "Email \nNEW YORK — It just got even easier to binge on Netflix. \nNetflix announced Wednesday members now have the option to download movies and shows to watch offline later. This means they can finally watch the new season of “Stranger Things” and “Bloodline” while on a flight or stuck in the subway. \nThe feature comes free of cost with all Netflix memberships. Members will want to make sure they have the most recent Netflix app on their Android or iOS devices to access the new “download” button. \nUp until now, you needed a place with a reliable internet connection to access the streaming service. But Netflix wants to make its product more nimble to suit the lives of those on the go. \nYou’ll find “Orange Is the New Black,”“Narcos” and “The Crown” available — but you can’t download everything. Shows like the new season of “Gilmore Girls,”“Friends” and “New Girl” are restricted for now. \nThe company previously argued the feature was unnecessary, calling it a “short term fix for a bigger problem.” That problem, of course, being wireless internet availability. \nBut its competitor Amazon Prime embraced offline downloads for iOS and Android users more than a year ago. \nAccording to Netflix’s Help Center page, “you’ll want to delete” downloaded titles before attempting to download new content. \nThat’s because some licensing agreements have limits on the number of titles people can download at the same time. The length of time Netflix users will have to watch a show or movie will vary by title. The “My Downloads” page will show members how long, such as 48 hours, they have with each title. \nThe company said in an email it is working with “lots” of partners globally on securing downloading rights “for the bulk of the content on our service.” ",

      "text": "Trent Moore Wed, Nov 30, 2016 12:41pm \nIt’s the killer feature Netflix has lacked for years, but it’s finally here: offline viewing. Now, you can finally take your watch list with you anywhere, regardless of internet connection. \nNetflix is rolling out an update to its iOS and Android apps today that will allow users to download shows and movies for offline viewing (no desktop downloads, it would seem). So, if you’re on a plane, stuck on the subway, low on data, or generally anywhere without a good connection, you can still use Netflix. You just have to download whatever you want beforehand, obviously. “While many members enjoy watching Netflix at home, we’ve often heard they also want to continue their Stranger Things binge while on airplanes and other places where Internet is expensive or limited,” Netflix’s Director Product Innovation Eddy Wu said in a statement . “Just click the download button on the details page for a film or TV series and you can watch it later without an internet connection.” \nNetflix is rolling the feature out with a smattering of shows, including Stranger Things, Flash, Black Mirror, Mad Men, Breaking Bad, Supergirl, Pulp Fiction, Hot Fuzz, Supernatural, Penny Dreadful, Limitless, iZombie, Danger Mouse, Arrow, Z Nation, Sense8, Star Trek: Voyager, The Road , and a bunch of other (random stuff). Netflix promises more stuff will be added in the near future. \nThis is a huge feature addition for Netflix in regard to usability (though if you use Amazon Prime, you’ve already had it for a while) and will especially be a massive boon for users who travel. \nAre you pumped to finally be able to download Netflix shows and movies?",

      "text": "Netflix Announces Offline Download Option © Getty Images Netflix Announces Offline Download Option Trending News: Netflix Finally Added The Most-Requested Feature Of All Time Shares Long Story Short \nWith their latest update, Netflix has finally added an offline download option for some of their most popular content. User's can download shows and movies to watch anywhere at a later time, and it's included in all streaming plans. Long Story \nThe cool thing about Netflix is that it's a streaming service — you don't need a bunch of DVDs or terabytes of hard drive space to have the entirety of Arrested Development at your fingertips. But the sucky thing about Netflix is that it's a streaming service — if you have data caps on your mobile devices, or you just moved and your internet's not setup yet, you're shit outta luck until something changes. \nThankfully, something did: Netflix's newest update includes an option to download content to watch it offline. Airplane mode. Road trip mode. Stuck-in-the-subway-for-20-minutes mode. Your favorite stories are now available for download any time. pic.twitter.com/g7QZA3TyE8 — Netflix US (@netflix) November 30, 2016 \nIf you download the latest version of Netflix for iOS or Android (both updates should be available today), you'll notice a download button appear next to a lot of your favorite shows. Right now it's mostly limited to Netflix originals , though a bunch of movies and shows from other studios are available as well. And more are on their way, according to Netflix. They've also added a helpful new \"sort by available to download\" feature. Netflix \nThis is pretty handy in a lot of scenarios, mostly when traveling wherever WiFi and/or 4G cellular internet isn't reliable. But watching Netflix on a phone isn't ideal (a tablet is better), and right now the feature is only available in the app for mobile devices — if you primarily watch Netflix on your computer, smart TV or streaming device (Apple TV, Roku, etc.), not much has changed. But given how well devices interact nowadays, it shouldn't be hard to migrate video from your phone to a computer, if Netflix allows it. \nContent will be available in both standard and \"higher\" quality download options, though Netflix doesn't state the actual resolution for either. The offline download option is included with all streaming plans. Own The Conversation Ask The Big Question \nWill this help Netflix keep up with services like Amazon, who've already had offline downloads for a while? Drop This Fact \nAs of last year, Netflix users stream about 10 billion hours of content each month. Show comments",

Once you have found a title, follow the steps below: \n1) Select the title you would like to download \n2) On the description page, tap the download icon \n3) Once the title has completed downloading, you can access it from the My Downloads section of the app \nThe move follows similar strategies by Netflix's rivals, including Amazon, who introduced Amazon Prime - which allows you to watch content offline - last year. \nNetflix announced the update, which allows members to download programmes to watch offline, in a blog today. \nEddy Wu, Director of Product Innovation, said: 'While many members enjoy watching Netflix at home, we've often heard they also want to continue their Stranger Things binge while on airplanes and other places where Internet is expensive or limited. \n'Just click the download button on the details page for a film or TV series and you can watch it later without an internet connection.' \nWhile programmes including Orange Is The New Black, Narcos and The Crown can be downloaded, not all of Netflix's content is available for download yet. \nTo browse all the downloadable titles, users can select 'Available for Download' from the Netflix menu, and then download by clicking the arrow icon on a title. \nThere will also be the option to download in standard or high quality, depending on how much space you have available on your device. \nUsers around the world have reacted to the news on Twitter, expressing their happiness at the long awaited update. \nWhile programmes including Orange Is The New Black, Narcos and The Crown can be downloaded, not all of Netflix's content is available for download yet \nScott McLean tweeted: 'Thank you so much! I am a Seafarer and don't have a connection at sea, so this makes me so happy!' \nChrissy Roberts tweeted: 'Netflix adding the option to download & watch on the go has more than made up for all the crap bits of 2016. Marvellous.' \nThe update is now available worldwide for users on iOS 8.0 or later, and Android 4.4.2 or later, with the latest version of the Netflix app. \nChrissy Roberts tweeted: 'Netflix adding the option to download & watch on the go has more than made up for all the crap bits of 2016. Marvellous.' \nScott McLean tweeted: 'Thank you so much! I am a Seafarer and don't have a connection at sea, so this makes me so happy!' OUR NETFLIX ADDICTION \nCordcutting.com calculated numbers from Netflix earlier this month and found members spend even less time reading, relaxing and think or exercising. \nThe average subscriber spends one hour and 40 minutes a day binge watching, which is compared to the 38 minutes a day they are 'socializing and communicating'. \nThis statistic suggests that Netflix fans are spending twice as much time cuddled on the couch with their remote than they do hanging out with friends. \nThe average American workouts for just 17 minutes a day, so, according to the calculations, Netflix members spend about six times more surfing through movie and show titles.",

      "text": "Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends \nTiVo is extending its partnership with streaming TV service Netflix through a licensing agreement that will see the two companies pair up in new ways. \nOn the product end, TiVo set-top box owners will be able to continue to access Netflix directly through the devices. This will allow subscribers to enjoy unified search across the entire content catalog. Most significantly, they can now also access Netflix through a dedicated button on the TiVo remote. \nRelated : You can finally watch Netflix on airplanes and the subway with offline downloads \nFurther, a new intellectual property agreement gives Netflix the opportunity to license TiVo’s patent portfolios, as well as patents for over-the-top (OTT) offerings, which are held by Intellectual Ventures. \nTiVo’s new parent company Rovi, which acquired the firm this year for $1.1 billion, had previously filed suit against Netlix for allegedly infringing on five of its patents — a suit that Netflix eventually won. This new agreement would give Netflix access to TiVo and Rovi’s more than 6,000 patents and pending applications for use in its streaming service. The patents relate to DVR and interactive program guide functions. \nBill Holmes, global head of business development at Netflix, says the agreement will help provide “an integrated experience across more devices.” \nTom Carson, CEO of TiVo, deems the new agreement a “major milestone” for the company as it expands its offerings in the OTT space. \nNetflix currently has more than 86 million members in over 190 countries. TiVo offers its intuitive interactive program guide, as well as its own DVRs. \nEarlier this month, TiVo entered into an intellectual property agreement with Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. that provides certain rights under TiVo’s patent portfolios for Samsung’s line of mobile, consumer electronics, and set-top box businesses. The deal followed ongoing litigation between the two. And at the end of October, TiVo renewed its product and intellectual property licenses with Panasonic. Also watch:",

      "text": "Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends \n‘Tis the season for oversized meals, oversized sweaters, and now, oversized quantities of Netflix. That’s because the streaming service has now made it possible for users to “download in addition to stream great series and films at no extra cost.” That’s right — you can now watch Netflix offline, as long as you remember to hit that little download button on the details page before heading off to a Wi-Fi-less land. \n“While many members enjoy watching Netflix at home, we’ve often heard they also want to continue their Stranger Things binge while on airplanes and other places where Internet is expensive or limited,” wrote Eddy Wu, Director of Product Innovation at Netflix. But now, you don’t have to depend on a Wi-Fi connection in order to enjoy your favorite pastime. \nNetflix has been hinting at the possibility of such a feature for quite some time now, with Netflix CEO Reed Hastings suggesting during the company’s first-quarter earnings call that offline viewing could be on the horizon. And now, he’s made good on that suggestion. \n“Many of your favorite streaming series and movies are already available for download, with more on the way, so there is plenty of content available for those times when you are offline,” Wu continued. “For example, Orange is The New Black , Narcos and The Crown are available for download today.” \nMore : LeEco, the ‘Netflix of China,’ ramps up U.S. push by offering products at retailers \nThe best part is that Netflix hasn’t limited this feature to just some subscription tiers — rather, regardless of what plan you may have, you can start downloading and watching offline today. If you’ve got an Android or iOS device, offline viewing is now a possibility. \nThere are some stipulations, of course. As mentioned above, Netflix’s own series are the first to be available for download, and it’s not yet clear how many titles outside of Netflix’s own creation will be available. The service is also currently limited to mobile devices and won’t work on a laptop, so those who want to watch a larger screen will need to do so on a tablet. Still, this is a major move for the service, especially for those in areas where high-speed internet is hard to come by. \nYou will, of course, have to update the Netflix app on your device to the latest version in order to take advantage of the new feature, but that hardly seems like a steep price to pay for binge watching your favorite programs just about anytime, anywhere. So consider this an early holiday present from Netflix. Also watch:",

      "text": "Netflix Is Finally Letting You Download Movies and TV Shows \nYour holiday travel just got a major upgrade. Most Popular By Megan Friedman Nov 30, 2016 The holidays are for family togetherness, eating tons of food, and binge-watching Netflix shows. (Or at least having their yule log playing constantly on the television.) Now, you can keep watching shows like The Crown , even on the bus ride to and from your parents' house. That's because Netflix is letting you download your favorite movies and TV shows so you can watch them when you have no signal. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below The company made the announcement on Twitter Wednesday morning: Airplane mode. Road trip mode. Stuck-in-the-subway-for-20-minutes mode. Your favorite stories are now available for download any time. pic.twitter.com/g7QZA3TyE8 \n— Netflix US (@netflix) November 30, 2016 Most Popular According to a company blog post , you can now go to the details page on a movie or show and click the download button, so you can watch it later. Some titles are already available for download, and more will become available later. Downloads are now available for all plans, for no extra cost, but only for phones and tablets on Android and iOS. Just make sure you have the most recent update on the Netflix app. The feature is similar to what is already available for Amazon Prime members. If you're a Prime subscriber, you can use the Amazon Video app to download select videos and TV shows to your phone or tablet, sometimes for a limited time, so you can watch while you lack signal or simply don't want to rack up data charges. But the Netflix announcement changes the game when it comes to the site's original series and movie catalog. The Netflix app now has an \"Available for Download\" section that can help you find stuff to pre-install for your next long trip or subway commute. Though Gilmore Girls is weirdly not on there, Black Mirror , Stranger Things , and Orange Is the New Black are there for you when you need an escape from family.

Image copyright Netflix Image caption Shows are downloaded to the device for offline playback \n\"It's surprising because just weeks ago they said it wasn't going to happen,\" said Tom Harrington from the consultancy Enders Analysis. \n\"You can understand why they wouldn't want to do it because it opens up a whole pot of rights issues. Offering a download service will cost Netflix more. \n\"But everyone else is already doing it. Amazon is doing it, Sky has been doing something similar with Sky Q. Netflix doesn't want to be left behind, or compared unfavourably to rivals.\"",

The download option was added to phone and tablet apps Wednesday, Nov. 30, 2016. (AP Photo/Elise Amendola, File) Share This Article ARTICLE PHOTO GALLERY (1) San Francisco • Netflix subscribers can now binge on many of their favorite shows and movies even when they don't have an internet connection. The long-awaited offline option announced Wednesday gives Netflix's 87 million subscribers offline access to videos for the first time in the streaming service's decade-long history. Netflix is matching a downloading feature that one of its biggest rivals, Amazon.com, has been offering to its video subscribers for the past year. It's something that also has been available on YouTube's popular video site, though a subscription is required in the U.S. and other countries where the site sells its \"Red\" premium service. VIDEOS TOP JOBS The new feature puts Netflix a step ahead of two other major rivals. Offline options aren't available on HBO's internet-only package, HBO Now, or Hulu, although that service has publicly said it hopes to introduce a downloading feature. Netflix subscribers wishing to download a video on their smartphone or tablet need to update the app on their Apple or Android device. Not all of the selections in Netflix's video library can be downloaded, although several of the service's most popular shows, including \"Orange Is The New Black,\" \"House of Cards,\" and \"Stranger Things,\" are now available to watch offline. Downloadable movies include \"Spotlight,\" this year's Oscar winner for best film. Notably missing from the downloadable menu are movies and TV shows made by Walt Disney Co. Those still require an internet connection to watch on Netflix. The Los Gatos, California, company is promising to continue to adding more titles to its offline roster. Netflix CEO Reed Hastings had long resisted calls for an offline-viewing option, much to the frustration of customers who wanted flexibility to use their subscriptions to watch a show or movie when traveling on a train, plane or car where internet connections are spotty or completely unavailable. Earlier this year, Hastings finally indicated he might relent and introduce downloading. The change of heart coincided with Netflix's expansion into more than 130 countries, including many areas with shoddy or expensive internet connections that make the ability to watch video offline even more appealing. Netflix ended September with 39 million subscribers outside of the U.S. The offline option may accelerate the decline of Netflix's steadily shrinking DVD-by-mail service, which offers the ability to watch video without an internet connection. Netflix's DVD side still has one distinct advantage — access to recent theatrical releases before they are available for streaming. Netflix's DVD service ended September with 4.3 million subscribers, a decrease of nearly 10 million customers during the past five years.",
