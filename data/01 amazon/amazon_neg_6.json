      "text": "GettyImages/Alex Wong \nAmazon CEO Jeff Bezos wished president-elect Donald Trump success moving forward, and congratulated him on his election win, in a tweet on Thursday.\n\"Congratulations to @realDonaldTrump,\" Bezos wrote . \"I for one give him my most open mind and wish him great success in his service to the country.\"\nThis tweet is quite a reversal of attitude for Bezos.\nDuring Trump's campaign, Bezos, who owns The Washington Post, called Trump out for his accusations of mainstream media bias. Bezos said Trump was \" eroding our democracy ,\" and suggested that Trump take a trip to space instead. Not exactly the \"open mind\" Bezos expressed in his tweet.\nOn the other side, Trump has often criticized Bezos and Amazon.\n\"I have respect for Jeff Bezos, but he bought The Washington Post to have political influence, and I gotta tell you, we have a different country than we used to have,\" Trump said during his campaign . \"He owns Amazon. He wants political influence so that Amazon will benefit from it. That's not right. And believe me, if I become president, oh, do they have problems. They're going to have such problems.\" \nIt seems that Bezos, however, wants to start the presidency off on a note of unity instead of bickering. We'll have to see if Trump feels the same way.\nThere are many ways a Trump administration could give Amazon a headache — from taxes to anti-trust. See my colleague Eugene Kim's article on all the ways Trump's presidency might affect Amazon .\nHere is the tweet from Bezos:\nTweet Embed:\nhttps://twitter.com/mims/statuses/796729498075099136\nCongratulations to @realDonaldTrump . I for one give him my most open mind and wish him great success in his service to the country. \nNOW WATCH: The ‘Apple of China’ just unveiled a phone that’s more powerful and better looking than the iPhone \n",

      "text": "Jeff Bezos at the Museum of Flights 2016 Pathfinder Awards. (GeekWire Photo / Kevin Lisota) Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, who once joked about blasting Donald Trump into space , congratulated the new president-elect in a tweet Thursday morning.\nCongratulations to @realDonaldTrump . I for one give him my most open mind and wish him great success in his service to the country.\n— Jeff Bezos (@JeffBezos) November 10, 2016 \nThe tech and business communities have displayed a variety of feelings on Trump’s victory. Some are upset , others stunned and some were diplomatic about the outcome . Bezos is taking an open-minded approach to his sometimes rival.\nTrump’s first dustup with Bezos came late last year. Bezos bought the Washington Post in 2013 for $250 million . Trump has claimed he used the paper to influence politicians in Washington D.C. and keep them from taxing Amazon.\nTrump has alluded to the possibility that Amazon could face antitrust issues under his presidency. In an appearance on Sean Hannity’s show on Fox News in May he said: “He’s worried about me — I think he said that to somebody, it was in some article — where he thinks I would go after him for antitrust, because he’s got a huge antitrust problem, because he’s controlling so much. Amazon is controlling so much of what they’re doing.”\nBezos’ congratulatory message strays somewhat from his tone on Trump in the past. After Trump’s December volley, Bezos made the joke on Twitter that he would “reserve him a seat on the Blue Origin rocket,” another venture that the Amazon founder is pursuing with his private fortune. In May, Bezos said Trump’s remarks were “not an appropriate way for a presidential candidate to behave.” \nIt is unclear if Trump will actually go after Bezos or Amazon as president and what kind of effect this political sea change will have on the company . Amazon’s stock opened down 3 percent Wednesday morning, and is down another 5 percent Thursday.",

      "title": "Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos congratulates Donald Trump and wishes him 'great success' in a huge reversal of tone (AMZN)",
      "text": "print Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos GettyImages/Alex Wong \nAmazon CEO Jeff Bezos wished president-elect Donald Trump success moving forward, and congratulated him on his election win, in a tweet on Thursday. \n\"Congratulations to @realDonaldTrump,\" Bezos wrote . \"I for one give him my most open mind and wish him great success in his service to the country.\" \nThis tweet is quite a reversal of attitude for Bezos. \nDuring Trump's campaign, Bezos, who owns The Washington Post, called Trump out for his accusations of mainstream media bias. Bezos said Trump was \" eroding our democracy ,\" and suggested that Trump take a trip to space instead. Not exactly the \"open mind\" Bezos expressed in his tweet. \nOn the other side, Trump has often criticized Bezos and Amazon. \n\"I have respect for Jeff Bezos, but he bought The Washington Post to have political influence, and I gotta tell you, we have a different country than we used to have,\" Trump said during his campaign . \"He owns Amazon. He wants political influence so that Amazon will benefit from it. That's not right. And believe me, if I become president, oh, do they have problems. They're going to have such problems.\" \nIt seems that Bezos, however, wants to start the presidency off on a note of unity instead of bickering. We'll have to see if Trump feels the same way. \nThere are many ways a Trump administration could give Amazon a headache — from taxes to anti-trust. See my colleague Eugene Kim's article on all the ways Trump's presidency might affect Amazon . \nInvestors might be sensing the risk. Amazon stock was down over 4% on Thursday. \nHere is the tweet from Bezos: \nCongratulations to @realDonaldTrump . I for one give him my most open mind and wish him great success in his service to the country. — Jeff Bezos (@JeffBezos) November 10, 2016 \nPrevious reporting by Eugene Kim. Disclosure: Jeff Bezos is an investor in Business Insider through his personal investment company Bezos Expeditions.",

      "text": "Jeff Bezos extended an olive branch to Amazon foe Donald Trump, but Amazon stock is tanking Related question: Is Jeff Bezos a “Simpsons” fan? share Drew Angerer / Getty Images Jeff Bezos and Donald Trump sparred repeatedly during the presidential election, and that could be a problem for Amazon and the Washington Post once Trump takes office . Now Bezos, like many other business leaders, is offering Trump a post-election thumbs up, with a reserved but positive statement: Congratulations to @realDonaldTrump . I for one give him my most open mind and wish him great success in his service to the country. — Jeff Bezos (@JeffBezos) November 10, 2016 Two things to note. For whatever reason, Amazon’s stock is tanking this morning. It’s down more than 5 percent today, and its slide accelerated after Bezos’s tweet: — zerohedge (@zerohedge) November 10, 2016 The construction of Bezos’s congratulations note immediately struck some of us as familiar. That’s because it’s the same construction as one of the internet’s most overused memes, courtesy of “The Simpsons”: It’s possible that Bezos and his team aren’t familiar with that one. Bezos spends a lot of time on things that don’t involve pop culture — he doesn’t do sports at all — and it’s possible he’s never come across this one before. But if I were betting, I would bet that he knew what he was doing. recode_divider",

Post to Facebook Bezos congratulates Trump on election victory Amazon CEO has joked about sending president-elect to space.  //usat.ly/2fFl4cR   Bezos congratulates Trump on election victory Brett Molina , USA TODAY 10:57 a.m. EST November 10, 2016 Amazon founder and Washington Post owner Jeff Bezos talks about the history and character of the Post during a dedication ceremony for its new headquarters in Washington. (Photo: J. Scott Applewhite, AP) \nSo much for sending Donald Trump to space. \nAmazon CEO Jeff Bezos offered congratulations to the president-elect Thursday after his election victory, following several critical comments during the campaign questioning Trump's push to the White House. \n\"I for one give him my most open mind and wish him great success in his service to the country,\" wrote Bezos on Twitter about Trump's victory. Congratulations to @realDonaldTrump . I for one give him my most open mind and wish him great success in his service to the country. — Jeff Bezos (@JeffBezos) November 10, 2016 \nBezos has criticized Trump in the past for how he ran his presidential campaign, claiming it \"erodes our democracy.\" Bezos — owner of the aerospace company Blue Origin — also joked about sending Trump to space. \n\"I have a rocket company, so the capability is there,\" said Bezos during a talk at Vanity Fair's New Establishment Summit held last month in San Francisco. Bezos also discussed Facebook's move to keep venture capitalist Peter Thiel — a Trump supporter — on its board of directors. \n\"Peter Thiel is a contrarian, first and foremost,\" Bezos said, as reported by Vanity Fair . \"You just have to remember that contrarians are usually wrong.\" \nIn a May interview with Sean Hannity, Trump said Bezos used his purchase of The Washington Post in 2013 \"for power so that the politicians in Washington don't tax Amazon like they should be taxed.\" Trump also claimed Bezos \"has a huge anti-trust problem.\"",

It’s as much nothing as what Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella offered last night, more or less an acknowledgement that they’re stuck together.\n\n\n\nCongratulations to @realDonaldTrump.

      "text": "Amazon.com CEO Jeff Bezos on Thursday congratulated president elect Donald Trump, extending an olive branch to a man who during the campaign criticized both Bezos and his empire and now is bound for the White House. \n“Congratulations to @realDonaldTrump. I for one give him my most open mind and wish him great success in his service to the country,” he wrote on Twitter.\nBezos is also the owner of the Washington Post, a newspaper that aggressively investigated the Republican candidate during the campaign. \nTrump directly mentioned Bezos, his ownership of the Post, and Amazon, highlighting potential antitrust issues with the e-commerce giant. \nMost Read Stories Trump   5   continues  WATCH Trucker   Those comments, as well as Trump’s public stance on free trade, have fostered questions about how it will fare in a geopolitical environment where Trump presides over the world’s largest economy and Amazon’s homebase. \nExperts have downplayed any big impacts stemming from decisions made by a Trump administration, but Amazon has lost billions in capitalization since Tuesday. Shares on Thursday were down 5.14 percent at $732.17, at a time when the wider stock market reached record highs, having shed its initial trepidation about a Trump presidency.\nÁngel González: 206-464-2250 or agonzalez@seattletimes.com .

      "title": "Amazon Black Friday 2016 Deals: Electronics Deals Ramping Up As Thanksgiving Week Nears",
      "text": "\nAmazon’s Black Friday 2016 deals won’t be starting until Thanksgiving week itself, but the company is getting ready for the year’s biggest retail holiday with some nice electronics deals. Not surprisingly, Amazon’s own products are among the gadgets selling at discount prices ahead of Black Friday, as shoppers can take advantage as early as now of deals on the Echo Dot and select Kindle e-readers.\nAlthough Thanksgiving week is still about a week and a half away from kicking off, Amazon is preparing for what should be another busy holiday shopping season with the Amazon Black Friday Deals Store. According to CNN , the new portal launched on Tuesday , and aside from electronics, the retailer also has clothing, toys, and a variety of other products selling at considerably lower prices than usual. CNN adds that the site will be offering new deals every day, and that the store will remain open for holiday shoppers until December 22.\nOnline shopping from the earth's biggest selection of books, magazines, music… > https://t.co/ajgYOf0ods < #amazon #blackfriday #giftideas pic.twitter.com/8EiVJTIQqL \n— Roy M. (@DailyFinds4U) November 8, 2016 \n\nThose who want to start their Black Friday shopping early on Amazon can do so right now, and pick up any one of several Amazon-branded devices for less than full retail. The Echo Dot, for starters, isn’t discounted if you choose to buy a single unit at the list price of $49.99, but those who buy three will get a $20 discount off the total price of all three units, simply by using promo code DOT3PACK upon checkout. You can also opt to buy six Echo Dots for the price of five by entering the promo code DOT6PACK.\nAmazon’s original Alexa-powered virtual assistant, the Echo, can be purchased at a lower price ahead of Black Friday. The company has the device priced at $119.99, or 30 percent off the regular price of $170.99, though there is a bit of a catch; this price pertains to a certified refurbished version of the Echo.\nIn addition to the Echo and Echo Dot, Amazon’s Black Friday 2016 deals on the company’s own devices include several discounts off the price of the Paperwhite and Voyage e-readers. The former device costs $79.99 (27 percent off full pricing of $109), while the latter sells for $119.99 (29 percent off full pricing of $119.99), though once again, the slight caveat is that these are refurbs — they’re guaranteed to be in very good condition at the very least, but aren’t brand-new devices.\n[Image by Ethan Miller/Getty Images] Amazon has several Black Friday 2016 deals listed in the Cell Phones and Accessories category, though an initial look would reveal that the company is selling far more of the latter than the former at this early stage of the game. A lot of the current electronics deals also appear to be for off-brand accessories and gadgets, though if you look closely, the company is selling a Sony Bluetooth stereo headset for $59.99, or 40 percent off regular pricing of $99.99. And while it may be too much to expect any deals on the all-new iPhone 7, or even last year’s iPhone 6s, Amazon has several cases selling on the cheap, including a SUPCASE Unicorn Beetle Style case for the iPhone 7 ($11.04, down from $13.99), and a Vibrance case for the iPhone 6s ($12.99, down from $19.99).\nFortunately, Amazon has a few laptops included among its electronics deals, including an ASUS ROG configuration with 17-inch display, 8GB RAM, and 1TB hard drive/256GB SSD that’s selling for $1,799.99, or 31 percent off full pricing of $2,599.\nAlthough it’s true that Amazon is prepping for the holiday shopping season as it adds to the deals with each day in the run-up to Thanksgiving week, the above deals only represent a tiny percentage of what one can expect from Amazon this coming Black Friday. The deals should continue ramping up in the days to come, and aside from the Deals of the Day and the longer-lasting discounts available per category, Amazon also has Lightning Deals, which offer a range of items at much lower prices, albeit only for a few hours.\n[Featured Image by David McNew/Getty Images]\nAmazon Black Friday 2016 Deals: Electronics Deals Ramping Up As Thanksgiving Week Nears is an article from: The Inquisitr News \n",

      "text": "share Amazon CEO and Washington Post owner Jeff Bezos congratulated Donald Trump this morning for winning the presidency. “I for one give him my most open mind and wish him great success in his service to the country,” Bezos wrote on Twitter. The statement says basically nothing, neither condemning Trump’s racist, sexist, xenophobic, vitriolic language and, presumably, future policies, nor expressing much support for him, beyond an implicit hope that he won’t tank the country. It’s as much nothing as what Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella offered last night, more or less an acknowledgement that they’re stuck together. Congratulations to @realDonaldTrump . I for one give him my most open mind and wish him great success in his service to the country. — Jeff Bezos (@JeffBezos) November 10, 2016 Bezos has a lot on the line under a Trump presidency, which may be why he’s now approaching with a halfhearted congratulations rather than reaffirming his offer to shoot Trump into space — a comment he made this time last year. Trump has repeatedly said that Amazon has “ a huge antitrust problem ” and that it ought to be paying more taxes. He’s also routinely criticized The Washington Post , denying its reporters press credentials, saying it was merely a mouthpiece for Amazon, and threatening to sue it for reporting on him. Trump’s infamous quote about how he will “open up our libel laws” specifically called out the Post . Needless to say, Bezos and his companies are in for a challenging four years. And as much as it’d be nice to see some of this country’s most powerful business leaders standing up to Trump’s bigoted ways, no one in tech seems eager to start a fight with him. Especially not Bezos, who’s already on Trump’s grudge list. More From The Verge",

      "text": "Amazon CEO and Washington Post owner Jeff Bezos congratulated President-elect Donald Trump on Thursday. “Congratulations to @realDonaldTrump. I for one give him my most open mind and wish him great success in his service to the country,” Bezos wrote on Twitter.\nBezos and Trump have traded barbs over the course of the presidential campaign.\nAt the Vanity Fair New Establishment summit, Bezos said of Trump:\n\"Saying that he may not give a graceful concession speech if he loses the election, that erodes our democracy around the edges. Saying that he may lock up his opponent erodes our democracy around the edges. It is inappropriate for a presidential candidate to erode that around the edges. They should be trying to burnish it.\"\nTrump, meanwhile, has said that Bezos is “using [The Washington Post] for political purposes.,” when the newspaper was looking into his past.\n\"He thinks I'll go after him for antitrust,\" Trump said in May. \"Because he's got a huge antitrust problem because he's controlling so much, Amazon is controlling so much of what they are doing. … He's using the Washington Post, which is peanuts, he's using that for political purposes to save Amazon in terms of taxes and in terms of antitrust.\"",

      "text": "November 10, 2016 at 10:13 AM EST New Baby Rear View Mirror Launched On Amazon Provides Parents With A Clear View of Their Children Aunt Mo’s has launched a new baby rear view mirror on Amazon that helps a parent keep an eye on their children while driving safely. \nEach day in the USA eight people are killed, and over one thousand people are injured due to distractive driving. One of the main reasons for distractive driving is the use of a mobile phone, another reason for so many accidents is a parent trying to see what their child is doing in the back seat of their vehicle. To reduce the number of accidents on the road, and allow a parent to see what their young child is doing, a new baby rear view mirror by Aunt Mo’s has been launched on Amazon. \nThe new baby rear view back seat car mirror launched by Aunt Mo’s has been hailed as one of the most important motoring accessories for parents of little ones. It allows a parent to keep an eye on their young child while in a rear-facing seat of the vehicle. Without installing the mirror, which is easy to install and is shatterproof, it means the parent does not have a clear view of their child without taking their eyes off the road. \nA spokesman for Aunt Mo’s said: “Our rear view mirror is not just an important device for the parent so they can keep an eye on their young child, but it also allows the parent to interact with the child safely.” \nFor $24.99, it has been described as one of the most important accessories a parent will purchase for their vehicle, allowing them to see the baby and for the baby to see them. It features a double strap for easy mounting and can be adjusted to suit the drivers view with the 360-degree ability. The product is bigger and wider than other mirrors on the market and can be installed in one minute. It stays in place and can easily be adjusted when needed. Unlike many other mirrors available on the market, the Aunt Mo’s rear view back seat car mirror is perfectly stable, and to show their faith in the product it comes with a money back satisfaction guarantee. \nKey Features: \n• DRIVE WITH PEACE OF MIND: Keep an eye on your baby while on the go and never have to worry again. \n• ADJUST TO YOUR PREFERRED ANGLE: Featuring a convenient double strap for easy mounting and superior stability, you can easily set up your infant back seat mirror in just a few minutes. The mirror’s position is easily adjustable thanks to the 360 degrees, strong pivot ball joint so that you can set it to your preferred angle. \n• KEEP AN EYE OF YOUR CHILD IN THE CRIB: Multipurpose and convenient, this baby car back seat mirror can also be used in the crib or nursery and help you monitor your infant at all times. \nTo learn more about the new baby rear view back mirror, which is made out of high quality material and to see why it has become one of the most recommended products for parents, please visit https://www.amazon.com/Aunt-Mos-Adjustable-Shatterproof-Accessories/dp/B01HXXATPC/ref=sr_1_1_a_it?ie=UTF8&qid=1478518083&sr=8-1&keywords=aunt+mo%27s \nAbout Aunt Mo’s \nAunt Mo’s provides quality products that help with lifestyle issues and provides a quality satisfaction guarantee. The baby rear view back seat car mirror has gained a great deal of attention with parents for providing them with an important vehicle safety tool.",

      "text": "NES Classic Hits Amazon At 2 P.M. Nov. 11, Here's How To Get Yours 10 November 2016, 12:05 pm EST By Cameron Koch Tech Times Nintendo's retro console is expected to be in high demand. ( Nintendo ) Advertisement \nWith retailers like Best Buy and GameStop not offering preorders for Nintendo's NES Classic console, the battle to find one on its November 11 launch day has become all the more competitive. Many gamers are looking to Amazon for a chance to snag one of the retro consoles, and now we have more details on exactly when the machines will go on sale. \nGo ahead and set your alarm: the NES Classic will go on sale on Amazon starting at 2 p.m Pacific Time on November 11. You'll probably want to have your mouse hovering over the buy button a few minutes early, however, as Amazon expects demand to be high and says they have limited quantities. \n\"Demand is expected to be very high, and there's no guarantee that it will remain in stock for long,\" an email from Amazon about the product reads. \"We will make similar announcements when additional inventory becomes available.\" \nAmazon will be disabling one-click purchases and encourages those interested in trying to snag a NES Classic to make sure the credit card information on their Amazon account is up to date. Because of high demand, there will be a one NES Classic per customer limit. Amazon did not offer specifics on when it expected to receive more of the retro consoles. \nNintendo's $59.99 NES Classic looks to be one of the hot items this holiday season. The miniature NES console comes preloaded with 30 classic NES games ranging from Super Mario Bros. to Legend of Zelda , Mega Man to Castlevania and many, many more. The machine comes with one controller, with customers able to purchase a second controller for $9.99. (Photo : Nintendo) \nAs stated above, Best Buy and GameStop didn't offer preorders for the machine as the retailers do for most other products, for reasons that aren't entirely known. Target briefly offered preorders for the NES Classic in August before stopping. According to IGN , GameStops could be receiving up to 12 NES Classics per store, and those will likely go fast. \nMeanwhile, those looking for Nintendo's next generation console will have to wait a little longer. The recently revealed Nintendo Switch will go on sale sometime in March. Nintendo has yet to discuss its new machine in detail, with its game lineup, price and specific release date still a mystery. Nintendo plans to reveal more details about the Switch in January.  ",

      "text": "Amazon Is Getting Serious About Streaming newsfeedback@fool.com (Jeremy Bowman) 7 min ago Image Source: Motley Fool. \nAmazon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN) stock pulled back after its recent earnings report as profits came in short of estimates. Among the many culprits, including increased shipping costs and new warehouses, was video content. \nThe e-commerce giant is on track to become one of the biggest content buyers in the country. Amazon notoriously keeps its data close to the vest on metrics like Prime membership and content spending, but according to some estimates, it's planning to spend $3 billion to $4 billion on video content this year, and should increase that in 2017. \nFor the second quarter in a row, CFO Brian Olsavsky highlighted video investment on the earnings call, saying the company would continue to spend in areas where it's seeing \"significant customer traction.\" \nAmazon is nearly doubling its video content and marketing in the second half of this year. In many ways, it seems to be following Netflix 's (NASDAQ: NFLX) playbook of investing heavily in original content and methodically expanding around the globe. In addition to the U.S., Amazon Prime Video is now available in the U.K., Germany, and Japan, and Prime will soon launch in India with a special introductory rate of just $7.50 a year, a more than 90% discount to its price in the U.S. \nNetflix, by comparison, is offering its service in India for $7.50 a month. The future of Amazon Prime Video \nAmazon's strategy with Prime Video seems to mimic its efforts with e-commerce and AWS -- offer rock-bottom prices in order to build a customer base, then use that scale as a competitive advantage. Video has fast become the second-most important perk in Prime's $99 membership package after the original benefit, free two-day shipping. \nAmazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos explained why video was a smart bet for the company at a recent conference, saying it helps make Prime more attractive to users. \"We get to monetize our video content in a very unusual way. When we win a Golden Globe, it helps win more shoes.\" The company knows that Prime members spend more than non-Prime customers, so attracting people to the service will build the company's retail sales. Because Amazon is building a network of services that link together under Prime, it's willing to sacrifice margins if it will lead to loyal customers and sales growth down the road. Amazon refers to this as the flywheel effect. \nBezos has even said that video could be a \"fourth pillar\" for Amazon, after retail, Prime, and AWS, indicating it may become a significant standalone business of its own. The bottom line \nWhile video content cannot be found anywhere in Amazon's financial results, the category is becoming more costly for the company, as are Prime services in general. Net shipping costs in the most recent quarter, for example, jumped 42% to $1.7 billion another sign of the costs of Prime. \nThe billions Amazon is spending on video should also put a significant dent into profits, especially as it expands Prime and Prime Video to new countries. As Netflix's experience has shown, profits in the streaming industry don't come easy -- that company introduced streaming nearly 10 years ago and started expanding abroad in 2010, and is only marginally profitable today. \nAmazon, however, has shown time and again that it is prepared to play the long game. Since going public nearly 20 years ago, the company has consistently put customers ahead of profits. With video, it seems to be doing the same thing, but its bottom line may only be able to withstand so much additional spending, especially with Prime at just $99 a year, and a rock-bottom $7.50 a year in India. \nAmazon hinted at potential plans for Prime Video when it began offering a standalone video service this summer for $8.99 a month, compared to a $10.99 monthly price for Prime. If the company continues to invest more in video, it may need to either increase the price of Prime or attract more subscribers to a Prime-only video service. Without more data on Prime membership, it's unclear if the $99 yearly fee will be enough to sustain it. Amazon's core e-commerce business reported an operating loss in the most recent quarter, a sign that spending on Prime may be eclipsing the income it generates. \nEither way, it's clear that Amazon has major aspirations in streaming. Expect the company to continue to challenge Netflix and the traditional media giants as it spends billions on video content in the coming years. \n10 stocks we like better than Amazon.com \nWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

      "title": "Amazon's Jeff Bezos Congratulates Trump a Year After the \"Space\" Tweet",
      "text": "Jeff Bezos 1h ago \nA fter Tuesday’s election results came in, Jeff Bezos realized that he had made a mistake: A year ago, he joked that he’d save now-President-elect Donald Trump a seat on a Blue Origin rocket to space, with no hint of a return journey. Now, Bezos is quickly covering. On Thursday, he publicly congratulated Trump on his victory. If Bezos wants to get humans off Earth, he’d best hope Trump accepts his apology. \n“Congratulations to @realDonaldTrump,” Bezos posted on Twitter. “I for one give him my most open mind and wish him great success in his service to the country.” \nIt’s therefore a sensible move for the Amazon and Blue Origin founder. Bezos’s indignant tweet last December, in which he joked that he should #sendDonaldtospace, was in response to Trump’s own negativity and accusations. Earlier that day, Trump went on a tirade against Bezos and Amazon. He suggested that Bezos purchased the Washington Post “for purposes of keeping taxes down” at Amazon. He restated the same basic idea three times over, and Bezos, who has a reputation to protect, was not pleased — though he did not respond to the direct accusations. The @washingtonpost loses money (a deduction) and gives owner @JeffBezos power to screw public on low taxation of @Amazon ! Big tax shelter — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 7, 2015 \nBezos’s response, in full, was as follows: Finally trashed by @realDonaldTrump . Will still reserve him a seat on the Blue Origin rocket. #sendDonaldtospace https://t.co/9OypFoxZk3 — Jeff Bezos (@JeffBezos) December 7, 2015 \nCommenters were quick to clarify that it should be a one-way trip, or a test rocket, or anything that guaranteed Trump would not just travel to space, but stay there. But on Thursday, Bezos was singing a different tune. Given Bezos’s ambitions, it’s understandable. It’s just not clear how forgiving Trump is. Congratulations to @realDonaldTrump . I for one give him my most open mind and wish him great success in his service to the country. — Jeff Bezos (@JeffBezos) November 10, 2016 \nBezos’s goal, he says, is to get humans to space, much like SpaceX CEO Elon Musk. Trump, who will soon be Commander in Chief, will preside over space policy. He’s said nothing to suggest an anti-private enterprise approach to space exploration; on the contrary, he seems to support public-private cooperation. But there’s nothing to prevent a Trump administration from favoring one company over another — SpaceX, say, over Blue Origin. If Trump is resolute in his vendettas, Bezos should be worried. \nIn the past, however, Trump’s quoted Bezos, evidently finding inspiration in Bezos’s words. \"If you never want to be criticized, for goodness' sake don't do anything new.\" -- Jeff Bezos — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 13, 2014 \nIt’s an odd relationship, and has significant implications for our chances to get to Mars . If Trump doesn’t forgive Bezos, and accept his congratulations, then perhaps Bezos will redirect some of his funds to the brewing Silicon Valley secession movement .

      "text": "Amazon / iStock Like us on Facebook \nBy now, you probably know that Amazon's Prime Pantry can be a great tool for stocking up on non-perishable food and household staples. With Prime Pantry 's new Holiday Store special promotion, it just got even better. The promotion is discounting dozens of items by 20% or more, with a number of solid on-screen instant coupons in the mix. If you have been needing to restock on things like dryer sheets , Tide laundry detergent pods , Dove , Aveeno , or Neutrogena personal care products, it just got less expensive. And if you drew pie-baking duty for this year's Thanksgiving dinner, the Holiday Store promotion includes a large selection of baking essentials like McCormick spices and extracts that your recipe will likely require. \nIf you've picked through the sale items and still need to fill out your box, Prime Pantry still has eight-packs of the revived Crystal Pepsi available. \nShipping for a Prime Pantry box is usually $5.99, but as always, if you buy five select items from Amazon's monthly promotion, your box will ship free. This month's free-shipping items include lots of body washes, popular breakfast cereals, Listerine, Neutrogena products, and a lot more. Between these two promotions, you can save some holiday cash and avoid clawing at the supermarket for that last container of cinnamon. \nShop Amazon's Prime Pantry Holiday Store promotion. \nMental Floss has affiliate relationships with certain retailers, including Amazon, and may receive a small percentage of any sale. But we only get commission on items you buy and don’t return, so we’re only happy if you’re happy. Good luck deal hunting! More from mental_floss...",

      "text": "The Nasdaq fell sharply in mid-morning trading Thursday, with Amazon, Facebook and other large tech stocks tumbling on worries about policy changes and protectionism under the administration of President-elect Donald Trump.\nThe Nasdaq opened in positive territory but fell as much as 2 percent, even as the blue-chip Dow index lingered in record territory.\nNear 1610 GMT, the Nasdaq was down 1.4 percent to 5,178.03.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.3 percent at 18,643.99, while the broad-based S&P 500 slipped 0.4 percent to 2,153.69.\nArt Hogan, chief market strategist at Wunderlich Securities, said Trump stance during the campaign created concerns about how new policies could affect the technology sector.\n\"The rhetoric around the large technology companies is neutral to negative,\" Hogan said.\n\"If we ever get back to that rhetoric that's more protectionist, that doesn't help people that manufacture a bunch of their products overseas, or companies that are putting smaller companies out of business.\n\"I wouldn't say 'exacting revenge,' but if you listened to what you heard on the campaign trail, you could certainly make a case that there's not a clear discernible tail wind for these large cap technology companies.\nHogan noted that many prominent Silicon Valley executives publicly backed Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton in the presidential race. And Trump attacked Apple directly after it refused to cooperate with intelligence experts seeking help in accessing a mobile phone.\nTrump also went after Amazon for its business practices, as well as Amazon chief executive Jeff Bezos. Bezos owns the Washington Post, which sharply criticized Trump throughout the campaign.\nApple fell 3.3 percent, Amazon 4.3 percent, Google parent Alphabet 3.3 percent, Facebook 4.7 percent and Microsoft 3.3 percent.\nJPMorgan Chase jumped 3.5 percent and Pfizer rose 4.1 percent. Caterpillar, which is expected to prosper from ramped-up public works spending, rose 2.5 percent.\nNasdaq's move lower marked a reversal from the initial market reaction Wednesday when the three major indices rallied.",

      "text": "COMMENTS Michael N. Todaro/Getty Images for Amazon Studios Amazon.com founder and CEO Jeff Bezos attends Amazon Studios Premiere Screening for \"Alpha House\" on Nov. 11, 2013 in New York City. \nLast month, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos said he regretted not taking Donald Trump ’s candidacy more seriously, warning that some of the then-candidate’s rhetoric on the campaign trail \"erodes our democracy around the edges.\" Fast-forward a few weeks and now Trump -- who has been very critical of Bezos -- is the next President and Amazon’s stock price is taking a hit. \nIt would appear Bezos has taken notice of his falling stock price (down 5 percent), and on Thursday morning the CEO sent out a congratulatory tweet to the next POTUS. \"Congratulations to @realDonaldTrump,\" Bezos wrote. \"I for one give him my most open mind and wish him great success in his service to the country.\" \nWhether Trump will appreciate the congrats from Bezos is anyone’s guess, but during the campaign he often criticized the tech billionaire for purchasing the Washington Post , claiming he \"wants political influence so that Amazon will benefit from it. That's not right. And believe me, if I become president, oh, do they have problems. They're going to have such problems.\" \nAnother reason for Bezos (and everyone else) to worry: Trump surrogate Omarosa said this week that the campaign keeps a \"list\" of enemies. \nBezos’ olive branch follows a similarly innocuous statement from Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella . \"Yesterday we witnessed the democratic process in action here in the US,\" he wrote on LinekedIn. \"The results are of importance around the world, and I know that interest is shared among Microsoft employees. We congratulate the president-elect, and look forward to working with all those elected yesterday. Our commitment to our mission and values are steadfast, and in particular fostering a diverse and inclusive culture.\"",

      "text": "Stuart Leave a Comment \nAmazon’s 2016 Black Friday and Holiday tool deals kicked off already, and more are on the way. \nMost of the money-off tool brand deals kicked off at the beginning of November, and the rest are expected to go live mid-month. Advertisement \nIn past years’ promos, I’ve learned that the popular tools can sometimes sell out quickly. If a tool is not in stock, but still orderable direct from Amazon with a “shipping soon” notice or similar, placing an order will usually get you a place in the fulfillment line. \nI’ll post about the more notable deals separately, but here’s a quick list:",

      "text": "Nov 10, 2016 12:26 PM Photo: Amazon Share Tweet \nThere’s a new Mad Men box set available on Amazon that comes with all sorts of goodies to help you drown your sorrows about the fact that Mad Men has been off the air for over a year, as well as your sorrows about this week in general. Like Kodak’s Carousel , the complete box set promises nostalgia, memories, and the ability to go backward and forward in time. Like a night at the Draper’s, it also promises booze. It also comes with two handmade low-ball tumblers that you should fill with nothing other than straight liquor if you’re going for Mad Men authenticity. The tumblers are accompanied by four collectable cork coasters featuring images from the opening credits. \nThe DVDs include all the special features ever released in pervious sets, commentaries for every single episode, and over four hours of brand new, exclusive special features, including: Mad Men Cast Wrap Ups, One On One With Matthew Weiner, Casting Mad Men, Design Of A Decade, Mad Men Advertising Archives, and a Show/Historical Milestones Timeline. So, if nothing else, it will at least provide a lengthy distraction from the perils that surround us. For $85, you can escape to Don Draper’s world. We also recommend just watching “ Zou Bisou Bisou ” on a loop for the foreseeable future. \nSend your Newswire tips to",

      "text": "SHARES Adam Jeffery | CNBC Jeff Bezos speaking at the new New York Economic Club luncheon in New York on Oct. 27, 2016. \nAmazon.com is being shut out of the post-election stock market rally. \nShares of the e-commerce giant plunged almost 5 percent on Thursday and have dropped 6.4 percent since Donald Trump was elected president early Wednesday morning. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 has climbed 1.5 percent over the past two trading days. \nWhether Amazon is dropping because Trump won the election isn't totally clear, but the idea that investors would take a more skeptical approach isn't totally crazy. Trump and Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos had multiple public spats during the campaign. \nTrump criticized Amazon for not paying its fair share of taxes, and claimed the company was somehow sheltered due to Bezos's ownership of The Washington Post , a newspaper that Trump routinely called dishonest. Here are some tweets from Dec. 7. @realdonaldtrump: The @washingtonpost, which loses a fortune, is owned by @JeffBezos for purposes of keeping taxes down at his no profit company, @amazon. \nWith the exception of offering Trump a spot on his rocket ship to space, Bezos didn't engage in a Twitter war with Trump. But he wasn't shy about taking shots when given the opportunity. \nLast month, at a Vanity Fair conference in San Francisco, Bezos said that Trump's efforts to \"try and chill the media and threaten retribution, retalation\" are inappropriate. \nBezos also said Trump's suggestion that he may not concede the election if he loses or that he might lock up Hillary Clinton if he wins \"erodes our democracy around the edges.\" show chapters <p>Trump team considers Dimon for Treasury -Sources</p> <p>CNBC&#039;s Kate Kelly discusses reports that the Trump campaign is considering appointing JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon as Treasury Secretary.</p> 1 Hour Ago | 04:37 \nTrump hasn't made any specific policy proposals that threaten Amazon's ability to dominate the e-commerce market or that would change the company's tax status. But people in the investment world are at least talking about it. \n\"At best it's business as usual for Amazon,\" said Colin Gillis, an analyst at BGC Partners. \"At worst the company could face increased federal scrutiny,\" \nJohn Blackledge, an analyst at Cowen & Co., isn't concerned. He already had a \"buy\" rating on the stock and told CNBC today that the dip represents a buying opporutnity. \n\"Fundamentals of the company are very strong,\" said Blackledge. \"I don't see any disruption in their business.\" \nFor his part, Bezos sent a congratulatory tweet to Trump on Thursday, only the second time he's mentioned the now President-elect on Twitter. @JeffBezos: Congratulations to @realDonaldTrump. I for one give him my most open mind and wish him great success in his service to the country. \nHandicapping the degree of an incoming president's score-settling is a new task for investors. Of course, it's not limited to the business world. Trump's most high-profile feuds have been with the media and politicians on both sides of the aisle. \nAri Fleischer, a former White House press secretary for President George W. Bush, said Trump shouldn't be threatening anyone, whether Clinton for alleged crimes or Bezos with antitrust issues. Fleischer said he didn't vote in this election. \n\"Presidents should not be involved in that matter,\" said Fleishcer. \"But I would be concerned.\" \n— CNBC's John Melloy and Josh Lipton contributed to this report.

      "text": "Last month, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos said he regretted not taking Donald Trump ’s candidacy more seriously, warning that some of the then-candidate’s rhetoric on the campaign trail \"erodes our democracy around the edges.\" Fast-forward a few weeks and now Trump -- who has been very critical of Bezos -- is the next President and Amazon’s stock price is taking a hit.\nIt would appear Bezos has taken notice of his falling stock price (down 5 percent), and on Thursday morning the CEO sent out a congratulatory tweet to the next POTUS. \"Congratulations to @realDonaldTrump,\" Bezos wrote. \"I for one give him my most open mind and wish him great success in his service to the country.\"\nWhether Trump will appreciate the congrats from Bezos is anyone’s guess, but during the campaign he often criticized the tech billionaire for purchasing the Washington Post , claiming he \"wants political influence so that Amazon will benefit from it. That's not right. And believe me, if I become president, oh, do they have problems. They're going to have such problems.\"\nRead more: Scooter Braun on Donald Trump Win: 'We Don't Have Time to Be Sad'\nAnother reason for Bezos (and everyone else) to worry: Trump surrogate Omarosa said this week that the campaign keeps a \"list\" of enemies.\nBezos’ olive branch follows a similarly innocuous statement from Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella . \"Yesterday we witnessed the democratic process in action here in the US,\" he wrote on LinekedIn. \"The results are of importance around the world, and I know that interest is shared among Microsoft employees. We congratulate the president-elect, and look forward to working with all those elected yesterday. Our commitment to our mission and values are steadfast, and in particular fostering a diverse and inclusive culture.\"",

      "title": "How Amazon Uses Twitter to Drive Website Traffic: Bad Jokes Ahead",
      "text": "Thinking about all of the great retailers online, there is perhaps no bigger name in the industry than Amazon. They have created an incredible sales system that is centered around a website that is second to none, with an inventory that includes …everything from A → Z!\nWith so much going on from their website alone you’d think they’d slack off on Twitter. Look through it careful and you’ll plainly see that they do not. Amazon use a very unique approach to customer acquisition on Twitter which:\nKeeps their followers engaged. Uses a wide variety of content. Creates customer-acquiring contests. Uses multiple accounts. Participates in trends. Everything that Amazon does to get clicks to their landing pages is out there for us to look at. Let’s take the time them to learn from them so we can apply it to our own Twitter marketing, and customer acquisition efforts.\nHow Amazon Uses Twitter to Acquire Customers Content style: Keeping it light and breezy Before you get too caught up in terms like customer acquisition, click through rates , and return on investment , you need to first see Twitter for what it is: Social. There is still a ‘social’ in ‘social media,’ after all.\nAmazon has taken the social aspect of Twitter and really ran with it. Their conversational tone and informal content presentation style have made sure that their followers know that they’re part of a conversation. Amazon’s followers don’t feel like they’re being advertised to:\nS . https://t.co/MsHmx3NAnN pic.twitter.com/m0ukmmdKhF \n— Amazon (@amazon) October 18, 2016 \n\nAre they actually being advertised to though? Of course! Click that link to see that this silly joke is a direct customer acquisition tactic that’s masked by their conversational, almost too silly, style.\nDogs in costumes. Repeat: dogs in costumes. https://t.co/Mq4lTDOx9v pic.twitter.com/XJhuteYW4K pic.twitter.com/8i9LvVW2Wb \n— Amazon (@amazon) October 14, 2016 \n\nEven dogs in costumes are a topic they’ll touch on, and sell with, when the opportunity comes. It’s just a fun account, and having some fun should be a goal of any Twitter marketing plan.\nHow They Acquire Customers via Contests and Hashtags Running a Twitter contest is a right of passage for anyone trying to acquire customers via Twitter. While there are many ways to get this right, and wrong, Amazon is currently running one which helps them:\nSpread their Twitter account around Tell a story Get people on their website Here’s the one that they’re making a big push for right now for Halloween:\nPrime rib. Get it? Join the #AmazonPrime box costume challenge and share your photos for a chance to be featured: https://t.co/bmHVtHuYfx pic.twitter.com/Iyh9vDkQzo \n— Amazon (@amazon) October 18, 2016 \n\nYes, it’s goofy. Yes, they make a pretty bad pun. But look at what they’re really doing with this one tweet for their contest:\nThey remind their followers once again of the paid ‘Amazon Prime’ service. They create a hashtag for anyone to click on to see not only more about this contest, but more about Amazon Prime in general. They prompt their followers to create user-generated content as another one of their promotional tools. And that user-generated content isn’t just a theory. It’s in practice already as fans send in pictures which Amazon then uses:\nWith a few #AmazonPrime boxes & a little creativity, just imagine the costume possibilities. Join the challenge https://t.co/UdkUGwhXXd pic.twitter.com/SuJkZ9Tz5b \n— Amazon (@amazon) October 17, 2016 \n\nEvery time one of their followers tweet out this user generated content related to their hashtag they have another chance to draw in new customers from the followers of that user. This is the great strength of user generated content . Contests which incorporate user generated content may just be your best bet at truly creating a contest which goes somewhere, and goes a long way to helping you find new customers.\nClever Use of Media We all need images, videos and GIFs to survive on Twitter. Amazon use some of the user-generated content discussed above, but the vast majority of it is produced in-house by their team.\nWhen they do create content, it is always with a distinct goal in mind, and that goal is always to drive traffic to a very focused landing page on their website. Here are two examples:\nWith eight spooky stories come eight good reasons to sleep with the lights on: https://t.co/1yNJfAZkmr pic.twitter.com/9fE2TwVilH \n— Amazon (@amazon) October 7, 2016 \n\nBecause it only happens once a year. https://t.co/oTbDWgISTg #NationalTacoDay pic.twitter.com/u2qjWWAWMR \n— Amazon (@amazon) October 4, 2016 \n\nClick on either of those links and you’ll be sent to a custom landing page packed full of products that are 100% relevant to the media used in the tweet. This is the type of content which can catch your eye as you scroll through your Timeline, and get you to stop on the most perfect link that you’re clearly interested in.\nThe other interesting thing they do with content is keep it varied. They seem to have every type of content which Twitter allows at some point. Be it plain images:\nWhen you tell all your friends you're going as Bigfoot. https://t.co/g1CYmaLQHG #Halloween pic.twitter.com/i8wkFYkF2h \n— Amazon (@amazon) October 18, 2016 \n\nLive Periscope events:\nLIVE on #Periscope : 3D printing: Is it a trick or treat? Watch for hidden giveaways! Thanks @monoprice for making… https://t.co/FQpX6JpFJ4 \n— Amazon (@amazon) October 13, 2016 \n\nPre-shot video:\n“If you make a good product, you’ll be successful.” pic.twitter.com/QCiR5D8TBC \n— Amazon (@amazon) October 18, 2016 \n\nLooping Vine video:\nDressed to impress, because it's #NationalTacoDay . https://t.co/ClRGOUdq98 \n— Amazon (@amazon) October 5, 2016 \n\nNot to mention their interesting ‘can you find it’ images:\nSomewhere, among this pile o' candy corn, is a yellow M&M. Can you spot it? pic.twitter.com/YNzfx5TEXR \n— Amazon (@amazon) October 1, 2016 \n\nThis wide variety of content keeps them from becoming stale, and makes their Timeline something very interesting to scroll through. This wide variety of content keeping interest high makes their links all the more clickable, and their content all the better at driving customers that will convert.\nIf you don’t personally have a team that can create this wide of variety of content, don’t worry. You can always tweet out the videos, GIFs, Vines, and images you find online. I, for one, would like to see them start using GIFs on Twitter .\nUsing multiple accounts to better appeal to specific customers A trend that more and more corporations are picking up on is the use of multiple accounts . With Amazon offering so much content they knew that some audience segmentation would do a lot to help them reach different groups of people, and connect with them deeply.\nI did a count of how many different accounts are directly associated with Amazon, and are verified, and that number was 39. This doesn’t include Twitter accounts for their Amazon TV shows either.\nThis means they can create content which appeals directly to music fans:\n. @GreenDay are back with more anthems to rock your world! Turn up 'Revolution Radio\" https://t.co/XtMFMcV0Hf pic.twitter.com/XMIYpTvxQ5 \n— Amazon Music (@amazonmusic) October 14, 2016 \n\nWithout annoying their book fans:\n6 new Star Wars books hitting shelves before \"Rogue One\": https://t.co/VF6WuxbOVu #starwars pic.twitter.com/YlJU6Bp0Oa \n— Amazon Books (@amazonbooks) September 7, 2016 \n\nOr spamming their video game lovers:\nFollow and RT for your chance to win the Amazon #Battlefield 1 CE and the new #XboxOneS . #BF1CESweepstakes https://t.co/ZJojg9ARRX pic.twitter.com/c42wzNtrrq \n— Amazon Video Games (@amazongames) October 1, 2016 \n\nIf you don’t have a Kindle, you don’t have to see tweets about the Kindle. If you don’t live in the UK, you don’t have to see tweets about, you know, British things:\nEverybody needs a hero. Our super toys will save the day https://t.co/2LPuVfym6h pic.twitter.com/DPjC30h1fM \n— Amazon.co.uk (@AmazonUK) September 14, 2016 \n\nWhen has Superman ever called someone ‘mate’? Do they add those British-isms in when they ship DC Comics over to the UK? Regardless, they make little tweaks to their content to better appeal to the specific audiences attracted by all of these accounts. This helps them find, attract, and drive more specific customer groups and lead to more conversions.\nYour company may not need a minimum of 39 different accounts, but it can do some audience segmentation to reach different audiences on a deeper level. This can be content and product segmentation, regional segmentation, or just the development of a support account.\n@PastaSC2 That's not what we want to hear. Are you having a current issue with a delivery? If so, what was the delivery date quoted? ^JA\n— Amazon Help (@AmazonHelp) July 4, 2016 \n\nParticipating in Trending Hashtags, and ‘National’ Holidays We’re all clearly obsessed with having some sort of silly national ‘holiday’ to ‘celebrate’ online almost daily, especially on Twitter where fresh content is King, Queen, and the court jester. Since Amazon seems to sell nearly everything, they also have content for nearly everything, and link with that content that drives customers.\nThey get content out there for #ForceFriday :\nThe Force is strong in this family. #ForceFriday https://t.co/utlD73lFWE pic.twitter.com/hlciW3m2pm \n— Amazon (@amazon) October 1, 2016 \n\nWake up for #NationalCoffeeDay :\nPrime members, buy a select coffee maker or accessory & get a FREE bag of Happy Belly coffee: https://t.co/sUWZ3BT9KB #NationalCoffeeDay pic.twitter.com/mQv6k589Ah \n— Amazon (@amazon) September 29, 2016 \n\nSing along without irony on #NationalOneHitWonderDay :\nFinish this lyric… #NationalOneHitWonderDay HINT: you'll find it in this playlist. https://t.co/1EgnqZa2tz pic.twitter.com/0eljVCh7Eu \n— Amazon (@amazon) September 25, 2016 \n\nAnd they went absolutely crazy about #NationalTacoDay , with 5 tweets about it on the day:\nBecause it only happens once a year. https://t.co/oTbDWgISTg #NationalTacoDay pic.twitter.com/u2qjWWAWMR \n— Amazon (@amazon) October 4, 2016 \n\nIs this content all really, really silly? Yep. Is it going to show up in the Timeline of those looking through these trending hashtags for silly content. Yep! That’s the whole point of using trending hashtags : To reach people you may not otherwise reach. \nAmazon stretches as far as they can to incorporate customer acquisition, via the highly relevant landing pages they link to in each tweet, into their trending tweets. You always have to be cautious when using trending topics in your customer acquisition strategy as you can quickly become spam, or even worse do something which leads to you sending a tweet like this:\nA million apologies. Did not read what the hashtag was about before posting.\n— DiGiorno Pizza (@DiGiornoPizza) September 9, 2014 \n\nKnow what the hashtag is about, and know whether or not your should use it for customer acquisition, before you tweet! Goofy ‘national’ holiday are usually safe. Force Friday and Taco Tuesday? Safe. DiGiorno used #WhyIStayed , which was about domestic violence: Not safe at all. Choose the right trends carefully and you’ll gain customers, pick up a few more retweets , and entertain your followers.\nAmazon’s Imitable Customer Acquisition Strategy Amazon exists entirely in an online environment. You can’t find them on Twitter and then take a drive over to their store ( yet ). Their storefront is online. Their ‘driveway’, or ‘parking lot’, exists in every possible online platform. Twitter is just another one of those platforms, and they must use it to acquire customers as they have no other way of obtaining them besides online.\nWe saw 5 key strategies they use to drive traffic from Twitter to their website. These tactics include:\nEngagement style: They keep things informal, leading to more conversations and shares which attract potential clicks. Contests and hashtag: They use contests as a way to drive people to their website, and associate these contests with hashtags connected to a larger story. Media usage: The majority of their eye-catching media is associated with a link to a dedicated landing page. Multiple accounts: They create accounts which appeal to specific segments of potential customers in a direct way. Trending topics: They have something for sale that matches every trend. They’re sure to jump in when it’s appropriate with something fun, and link to a landing page with highly-relevant products for sale. There is no great secret to any of this. All you have to do is see it for what it is, come up with ways that these customer acquisition tactics can apply to your account, and put that plan in action.\nAre you thinking about using any of these customer acquisition tactics on Twitter?

      "text": "This Amazon Review For A Pair Of Rainbow Suspenders Is Guaranteed To Make You Smile “This is honestly just so pure.” by Cody Gohl 1h ago \nAt a time when so few things seem to be making any sense , at least one part of the Internet is choosing to celebrate joy in the form of an adorable Amazon review of a pair of rainbow-colored suspenders. \nThe review was written by 70-year-old user blueyes who bought the suspenders in celebration of his 48th gay Pride march. \n“I have never worn any rainbow colored items,” he wrote, “but this year as I turn 70 years old, I decided to purchase some rainbow suspenders and wear them with a white suit, and purple brooks brothers shirt.” \n“I could not ask for a better made pair,” he concluded. “It seems every time I need something, Amazon finds it for me and makes it easy for me to purchase. How very wonderful.” \nOne Tumblr user was so struck by the genuinely sweet message that they decided to share a screenshot of it along with the caption: “This is honestly just so pure.” http://fangirlingoverdemigods.tumblr.com/post/152479592916/this-is-honestly-just-so-pure \nThe post quickly went viral, with users reblogging the screencap over 30,000 times. \n“I came across the review after my girlfriend showed it to me. We both thought it was super adorable,” Tumblr user fangirlingoverdemigods told BuzzFeed News. “It made my day and I thought it could make other people’s days too.” \nTurns out, it made a lot of people’s days, as users came out in waves to express their appreciation for the review. \nThankfully for us, this isn’t the first time blueyes has taken to Amazon with a beautifully touching post. \nA few years back, he reviewed a pair of headphones he’d bought for a coworker in need, writing: “It makes me happy to make someone else happy.” \nWe’re not crying, you’re crying.",

      "text": "by Valerie Richardson November 10, 2016, 2:40 pm \nThe 2016 # Amazon # FireTablet is now selling via eBay for $49 . The seller is offering the 7-inch version of the tablet, which is arguably the cheapest offering compared to contemporary offerings. There’s a ton of cool features on board here, so don’t write it off just because it’s priced cheaply. \nThe Fire Tablet comes with a 1024 x 600 display, a 1.3 GHz quad-core processor, a 2-megapixel rear camera, a VGA front camera, 1GB of RAM, 8GB of storage (expandable), Fire OS (based on Android), and a 7-hour battery life. \nInterestingly, you can get the tablet for the same cost at Amazon. So you’re not saving much here. But it’s always good to have an alternative option for people interested in getting Amazon’s premier budget tablet. Hit the eBay page below for additional details on the deal. The stocks might not stay for long, so make sure you hurry.",

      "text": "Shares of Amazon have dropped about 5 percent since Donald Trump was elected president of the United States, however John Blackledge, an Amazon analyst for Cowen and Company, believes there is nothing to worry about. \nWhen asked if Amazon will be able to continue the way it's doing business when Trump becomes president, Blackledge told CNBC's \"Power Lunch\" on Thursday, \"I don't see any disruption in their business. They are crushing it on the e-commerce side both domestically and internationally. The growth in the Prime customers has been great, the growth in their units and their e-commerce business have accelerated at scale over the past year.\" \nEarlier this year, Trump accused Amazon for not paying its fair share of taxes due to Jeff Bezos' ownership of the The Washington Post. \nHowever, Bezos sent out a congratulatory tweet to Trump on Thursday saying how how he'll give the president-elect his \"most open mind\" and wishing him \"great success\" for the future. \nBlackledge acknowledged the recent plunge in Amazon's stock, however he believes that Amazon will continue at the same growth, even with America potentially transitioning to a protectionist country with higher tariffs under Trump. \n\"The fundamentals of [Amazon] are very strong,\" Blackledge said. \"We look at this as a buying opportunity. I mean right now, the stock's trading at 15 times next year's EBITDA. This is for a company that's seeing accelerated e-commerce growth doing a billion dollars in revenue at massive scale, with huge consumer demands as we head into the holidays and the next year or so. We remain super bullish on Amazon and think this is just a blip in the road.\" \nAnd if the congratulatory tweet doesn't solve tensions with Trump, Blackledge suggested that maybe Bezos should gift him their voice-control speaker, the Echo, for the White House. \n\"We think there's about 11 million Echo devices in the U.S. sold and a ton more sold this holiday season,\" Blackledge said. \"So I'm sure maybe they could outfit the White House with one.\" Rachel Cao Special to CNBC.com Related Securities",

      "text": "Markets Today Amazon's Stock May Be Suffering From the Trump Effect The e-commerce giant's shares have slipped about 6% since the presidential election, perhaps reflecting hostile comments Trump has made about Amazon and Jeff Bezos in the past. Nov10,20163:10PMEST \nIs Amazon.com ( AMZN ) becoming a victim of the Trump effect? \nShares of the e-commerce giant and Wall Street darling have fallen about 6% since the U.S. presidential election. The stock was down 3.5% mid-day Thursday at $745.20. \nDonald Trump's surprising victory against Hillary Clinton may be causing investors to flash back to Trump's comments in May to Fox News ' Sean Hannity. \nTrump fired shots at Jeff Bezos, claiming that Amazon's founder, president and CEO had a \"huge antitrust problem\" and that Amazon was \"getting away with murder, tax-wise.\" \nThe now president-elect also asserted that Bezos was using The Washington Post as his own political tool. (Bezos bought The Post for $250 million in 2013). \nIn a potential attempt to reach a truce, Bezos tweeted Thursday morning to congratulate Trump. Congratulations to @realDonaldTrump . I for one give him my most open mind and wish him great success in his service to the country. Prev 0 of 3 Next If you liked this article you might like",

I think it comes towards the end of November, but I could be mistaken $20 is 50% off for Castles of Burgundy. If you go by Amazon's (incorrect) $42 as list price, it's more than 50% off. Maybe it ends up cheaper, but not because there's a 50% off sale.",

      "text": "latest posts from Election Day Live Chelsea Bailey Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos Congratulates Trump, Pledges an 'Open Mind' \nAmazon CEO Jeff Bezos extended an olive branch to Pres.-elect Donald Trump Thursday, congratulating him on his election and echoing Hillary Clinton's pledge to give him an \"open mind.\" \n\"I for one give him my most open mind and wish him great success in his service to the country,\" Bezos wrote on Twitter. \nBezos also owns The Washington Post. The media outlet was a frequent target of Trump's criticism during his campaign. In June, Trump revoked the newspaper's press credentials calling its reporting \"phony\" and \"dishonest.\" \nAt the realization of four years of a Trump presidency, Silicon Valley leaders expressed their sorrow but said they're ready to get back to work. Congratulations to @realDonaldTrump . I for one give him my most open mind and wish him great success in his service to the country. Adam Howard Pistons Coach: Trump Supporters Threw Part of Country 'Under the Bus' \nWhen Detroit Pistons coach Stan Van Gundy lashed out at President-elect Donald Trump on Wednesday, calling him \"brazenly racist\" and suggesting that his supporters had thrown \"a good part of this country under the bus,\" he wasn't just speaking for his own players — he was articulating the viewpoint of a number of NBA athletes. \nIn the wake of Trump's shocking Election Night upset, several pro basketball players took to social media to express their disappointment and anger at the results. Meanwhile, the New York Knicks' Carmelo Anthony , one of the most outspoken stars in league, has called for more activism in the aftermath of Trump's election. \nThe league has demonstrated its clout already in the last two years by taking a stand against religious freedom bills in Indiana and North Carolina. With the commissioner's blessing, the league relocated a planned 2017 All-Star game from Charlotte to New Orleans after the state of North Carolina passed a law curtailing LGBTQ rights, enraging fans and players alike. That move had a real economic impact on the city and state, and may have contributed to Republican Gov. Pat McCrory's imperiled (but currently unsettled ) re-election bid. And in 2014, player protests contributed to the national outcry and eventual permanent expulsion of former Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling from the league following an unearthed audio of him making bigoted remarks. This feels something close to a purge night 🙄 #ElectionDay — Wave Papi (@KELLYOUBREJR) November 9, 2016 I hope not!!!

How do you want to make America great? We want to hear from you. Tell us your story or share your idea here: https://t.co/49KtTmXLs1 Eun Kyung Kim Christie Takes Big Pause After Chief of Staff Question \nChristie's early endorsement of Trump was seen as shocking at the time, given how critical he was of the real estate developer-turned-reality show star when the two were rivals. But the gamble paid off following Trump's surprise Election Day victory over Hillary Clinton. \nChristie said he and Trump spoke on election night, \"but we didn't speak about me, we spoke about the transition.\" \nAsked specifically whether he'd like to serve as Trump's chief of staff or attorney general, Christie refused to answer. â€œWhat role do you want in a Trump administration?â€ - @MLauer â€œWe have not talked about anything.â€ - @GovChristie pic.twitter.com/8aN1BFOzts Twitter Trump Arrives for White House Meeting Pres.-elect Trump waves as he arrives with future First Lady Melania Trump in DC for mtg. with Pres. Obama - @MSNBC pic.twitter.com/vicdiwBB3P Adam Howard Giuliani Calls Trump Protesters 'Spoiled Crybabies' \nDonald Trump advisor and rumored potential cabinet pick Rudy Giuliani lashed out at the thousands of protesters who took to the streets on Wednesday in cities across America to protest the Republican real estate mogul's upset victory on Tuesday. \nDuring a Thursday morning appearance on Fox News, the former New York City mayor told host Steve Doocy: \"The reality is they're a bunch of spoiled crybabies.\" \nIn that same interview, Giuliani was coy about the possibility of being nominated to be the U.S. Attorney General, and suggested the President Obama should not pardon Hillary Clinton -- overlooking the fact that she has not been charged with any crimes and the FBI has cleared her of wrongdoing twice in its investigation of her private email server. \nMeanwhile, Giuliani is not the only Trump surrogate to throw shade at the protesters. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie questioned whether the demonstrations were \"spontaneous\" during a phone interview Wednesday on MSNBC's \"The 11th Hour.\" \n\"My take on this is these things will happen especially after a highly charged emotional campaign that went on for the better part of 18 months in this country,\" he said. \"You can't shut it off -- that emotion and that energy and that commitment -- overnight.\" Phil McCausland Bernie Sanders Releases Biting Statement in Response to Trump Presidency \nBernie Sanders was one of the last major politicians to release a statement that responded to Donald Trump's presidential victory. \nOne of his advisers started the day by telling CNN's Jeff Zelaney, \"We have nothing nice to say right now,\" when asked to comment. \nIn the evening, Sanders' office finally provided an official statement. In it, Sanders did not offer congratulations. \n\"Donald Trump tapped into the anger of a declining middle class that is sick and tired of establishment economics, establishment politics and the establishment media. People are tired of working longer hours for lower wages, of seeing decent paying jobs go to China and other low-wage countries, of billionaires not paying any federal income taxes and of not being able to afford a college education for their kids — all while the very rich become much richer.\" \nHe then outlined exactly where he could find common ground with the Republican — and where he could not. \n\"To the degree that Mr. Trump is serious about pursuing policies that improve the lives of working families in this country, I and other progressives are prepared to work with him. To the degree that he pursues racist, sexist, xenophobic and anti-environmental policies, we will vigorously oppose him.\" Andrew Rafferty Ayotte Concedes to Hassan in N.H. Senate Race \nNew Hampshire Sen. Kelly Ayotte conceded her re-election campaign against Gov. Maggie Hassan, giving Democrats their second Senate pickup of 2016. \nThe two were separated by just a few hundred votes come Wednesday afternoon. The presidential race in the state is still too close to call. \nHassan becomes the second Democrat this year to defeat an incumbent Republican senator. The first came in Illinois, where Democratic Rep. Tammy Duckworth defeated incumbent GOP Sen. Mark Kirk. Marianna Sotomayor McConnell Differs From Trump on Term Limits, NATO \nSen. Mitch McConnell congratulated Donald Trump for a \"stunning election\" and pledged to work closely with the new president-elect on Wednesday. \nThough McConnell has refused to comment on Trump in the past, he opened up during a press conference, saying that Senate Republicans are \"enthusiastically for\" many of Trump's positions. The first thing McConnell is expecting from Trump during the next Congress is his recommendation for SCOTUS nominee. \nMcConnell also talked about some of the differences he and Trump had throughout the campaign. He said the Senate will not discuss term limits on member of Congress at all, a position Trump advocated strongly during his \"Drain the Swamp\" pitch. He also mentioned that the US will not break away from NATO, issuing this warning to Russia in particular: \"If you attack any member of NATO you have us to deal with.\" \nThe Majority Leader was encouraged to see that voters chose to keep the Senate under Republican control given that the races were against their favor.

      "text": "Amazon streaming TV devices won't be so Amazon-focused SEATTLE (AP) -- A federal judge has laid out rules for how Amazon must reimburse customers whose kids made in-app purchases without permission. The Federal Trade Commission sued the Seattle company in 2014, saying it was too easy for children to spend their parents' money while playing games on mobile devices. The agency settled similar cases against Apple and Google. All three companies now require a password for in-app purchases or an opt-in to enable purchases without a password. Seattle U.S. District Judge John Coughenour found Amazon liable last spring, but he rejected the FTC's request for a $26.5 million penalty as excessive. Instead, he said Thursday that Amazon should notify affected customers and allow them to make claims. The judge denied Amazon's request to reimburse the customers with Amazon gift cards.",

The agency settled similar cases against Apple and Google. \nAll three companies now require a password for in-app purchases or an opt-in to enable purchases without a password. \nSeattle U.S. District Judge John Coughenour found Amazon liable last spring, but he rejected the FTC's request for a $26.5 million penalty as excessive. Instead, he said Thursday that Amazon should notify affected customers and allow them to make claims. \nThe judge denied Amazon's request to reimburse the customers with Amazon gift cards.  ",

      "text": "UPDATE 2-Zalando sees marketing costs down even as Amazon spends Updated: November 10, 2016 — 7:54 AM EST Share \n* Managing board member dismisses Amazon threat \n* Overlap seen at only 20 pct of current season stock \n* Marketing spending set to keep falling as pct of sales \n* Optimistic for Black Friday, Christmas sales \n* Sales growth slows in Germany, Austria, Switzerland (Adds comments from analyst call, updates shares) \nBy Emma Thomasson \nBERLIN, Nov 10 (Reuters) - Zalando, Europe's biggest online-only fashion retailer, expects its marketing costs will keep falling as a percentage of sales even as Amazon invests in promoting its fashion business. \nZalando's shares have been under pressure this week after a downgrade by UBS analysts, who say the German company will need to increase marketing to maintain sales growth. The stock was down 2.2 percent at 1110 GMT on Thursday. \nZalando said on Thursday that more efficient logistics and marketing helped it report a stronger-than-expected third-quarter adjusted earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margin of 2.3 percent. \nTotal marketing spend will keep rising but will fall as a percentage of sales, which are growing at up to 25 percent a year. \nMarketing costs fell to 9.5 percent of sales from 12.3 percent a year ago, partly due to unseasonably warm weather delaying campaigns to promote purchases of winter gear. \nZalando's quarterly sales rose 17.1 percent to 835 million euros ($910 million), easing from 25 percent the previous quarter, with growth slowing sharply in Germany, Austria and Switzerland to 9.7 percent from 34.4 percent a year ago. \n\"We expect that as the sales environment improves, marketing costs could increase again in order to drive sales growth,\" said Bernstein analyst Jamie Merriman, who rates the stock \"outperform.\" \nManaging board member Rubin Ritter told an analyst call he expected marketing costs to keep coming down as a percentage of sales, allowing Zalando to invest more into speedier delivery, including possible new satellite warehouses. \nHe said Zalando had not seen any major impact from an international television advertising campaign for Amazon fashion launched in September, shrugging off investor concerns about the threat posed by the U.S. ecommerce giant. \n\"We are serving a much more fashionable customer looking for a curated assortment and recommendations... not an 'everything' store,\" Ritter said. \nRitter said that Amazon was more focused on older season and basic items, compared with Zalando's offering of the latest fashions, adding that the overlap between the two companies' offering in the current season was only about 20 percent. \nZalando confirmed it expects sales growth for 2016 to come in at the upper end of a 20-25 percent range and forecast an adjusted EBIT margin of 5.0 to 6.0 percent. \nRitter said he was optimistic for trading around the Black Friday sales event on Nov. 25 and the Christmas season. \n\"We are looking forward to a great fourth quarter,\" he told journalists on a conference call. our guidelines | Comments FAQ ",

      "text": "Judge: Amazon to reimburse customers for in-app buys by kids Updated 1:31 pm, Thursday, November 10, 2016 SEATTLE (AP) — A federal judge has laid out rules for how Amazon must reimburse customers whose kids made in-app purchases without permission. The Federal Trade Commission sued the Seattle company in 2014, saying it was too easy for children to spend their parents' money while playing games on mobile devices. The agency settled similar cases against Apple and Google. All three companies now require a password for in-app purchases or an opt-in to enable purchases without a password. Seattle U.S. District Judge John Coughenour found Amazon liable last spring, but he rejected the FTC's request for a $26.5 million penalty as excessive. Instead, he said Thursday that Amazon should notify affected customers and allow them to make claims. The judge denied Amazon's request to reimburse the customers with Amazon gift cards.

Instead, he said Thursday that Amazon should notify affected customers and allow them to make claims. \nThe judge denied Amazon's request to reimburse the customers with Amazon gift cards.

      "text": " Over the past few months, the <a href=\"/tag/robin\"><strong>Robin</strong></a> from Nextbit has seen itself on sale many times through Amazon, but today might be its lowest price to date. At 57% off, the total price for a new Robin is only $169, which is a great price for any smartphone.<span id=\"more-193578\"></span>\nFor a refresher, the Robin features a 5.2″ FHD display, Snapdragon 808 processor, 3GB of RAM, 32GB of onboard storage, 100GB of cloud storage for the offload and download of applications, plus a very unique look, courtesy of former-HTC designer Scott Croyle.\nConsidering how low this pricing is, we don’t know how long it will last. If you still want to try out Nextbit’s cloud storage solution for smartphones, go grab one.\nOh, and both Mint and Midnight colors are available at the same price.\n<strong>Amazon Links</strong>: <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Nextbit-Robin-Factory-Unlocked-Smartphone/dp/B01D9LVCAI/\" target=\"_blank\">Mint</a> | <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Nextbit-Robin-Factory-Unlocked-Phone/dp/B01D3Q8EGY/\" target=\"_blank\">Midnight</a>\n<h6 style=\"text-align: right;\"><em>Cheers Travis!</em></h6> </div>",

I for one give him my most open mind and wish him great success in his service to the country,\" he wrote on Twitter.\nBezos is also the owner of The Washington Post, which aggressively investigated the Republican candidate during the campaign.\nTrump directly mentioned Bezos, his ownership of The Post, and Amazon, highlighting potential antitrust issues with the e-commerce giant.\nThose comments, as well as Trump's public stance on free trade, have fostered questions about how Amazon will fare in a geopolitical environment where Trump presides over the world's largest economy and Amazon's home base.\nExperts have downplayed any big impacts stemming from decisions made by a Trump administration, but Amazon has lost billions in capitalization since Tuesday.

      "text": "Messaging 48 mins ago \nAmazon’s tentacles are spreading far and wide. The one-time book delivery service is now a TV and film studio, a book publisher, and in its latest venture, an experimental fiction maker. \nIts new app launched on Nov. 2, Amazon Rapids, tells stories to kids by simulating two people messaging each other. The reader-user reads more by tapping after each text. \nDesigned to look like a messaging app, Rapids imitates a narrative unfolding through live conversation, much the same way Quartz’s own news app does. \nIts looks mimic that of the addictive app Hooked, which tells stories through the same conversational UI. Billed as “Fiction for the Snapchat generation” and marketed toward readers aged 13 to 24, Hooked was a finalist for this year’s Fast Company’s Co.Design innovation awards in the app category. \n“The text message format appeals to young readers, because it is visceral, conversational and bite-sized,” says Hooked CEO Prerna Gupta. “All critical elements when you’re trying to capture the attention of a young person who is otherwise glued to Instagram and Snapchat all day.” \nAvailable on iOS, Android, and Amazon’s Fire tablets, a subscription to Rapids is available for $2.99 a month. According to a release, “dozens” of new stories will be added monthly. Read full story",
