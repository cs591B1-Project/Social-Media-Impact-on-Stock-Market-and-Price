      "title": "Exclusive: Microsoft set to win EU approval for LinkedIn buy - sources",
      "text": "A \nBRUSSELS: Microsoft is set to gain EU approval for its US$26 billion buy of professional social network LinkedIn with tweaks to concessions aimed at addressing competition concerns, three people close to the matter said on Wednesday. \nMicrosoft last week told the European Commission that it would still allow LinkedIn's rivals access to its software such as its Outlook program and give hardware makers the option of installing competing professional social networks on computers after the acquisition. \nThe second plank of the concession is important because of the company's battle with the EU competition authority over the last decade and the policy of tying its products to block rivals, resulting in fines of more than 2.2 billion euros. \nThe slight modifications came following feedback from rivals and customers, the people said, declining to provide details because of the sensitivity of the issue. \nThe deal, Microsoft's largest ever acquisition, will allow the company to add a suite of sales, marketing and recruiting services to its core business products as it gears up for next-generation computing. \nHowever, it came amidst regulatory concerns and citizens' worries about big data and that some companies may use the huge amount of information they gather to squeeze out competitors and encroach on users' privacy. \nThe deal has been criticized by U.S. rival Salesforce , which lost out on the bidding for LinkedIn and which urged regulators to examine the antitrust and data privacy issues thoroughly before approving it. \nThe Commission, which is scheduled to decide on the deal by Dec. 6, as well as Microsoft, declined to comment. \nAuthorities in the United States, Canada, Brazil and South Africa have already nodded through the acquisition without demanding concessions. \nThe bulk of LinkedIn's US$3 billion annual revenue comes from job hunters and recruiters who pay a monthly fee to post resumes and connect with people. \n(Reporting by Foo Yun Chee; editing by Robin Emmott) - Reuters",

      "text": "Tweet \nBack in the the mid-1990's, everyone thought they needed a computer. After all, Windows 95 made using one particularly easy, and the internet was a very attractive thing. Unfortunately, once some people got their first-ever PC set up in their homes, they didn't really know what to do with it. In the end, it would turn out that some consumers spent thousands of dollars for a machine dedicated to one thing -- playing Solitaire! Yes, this fun Windows game is responsible for much wasted time, but not just at home -- at businesses too. The card game has historically been viewed as a negative for productivity. \nFast forward to 2016 and fewer people are sitting in front of large desktop computers at home -- people are increasingly turning to tablets and smartphones for entertainment. Today, just in time for Thanksgiving , Microsoft Solitaire Collection comes to both Android and iOS. \n\"Microsoft Solitaire continues to be one of the most-played games of all time on Windows for more than 25 years. Whatâs more, the version of Solitaire you know and love on Windows 10 and Windows 8 PC and mobile devices, Microsoft Solitaire Collection, has reached more than 119 million unique players in the last four years alone! And now, those on iPhone, iPad and Android devices can play the popular card game for free\", says Paul Jensen, Studio Manager of Microsoft Casual Games. \nJensen further says, \"with Xbox Live integration, you can sign in with your Xbox Live gamertag or Microsoft account to earn Xbox Live achievements and Gamerscore, compete with friends, and continue playing on any Windows 10, iPhone, iPad, or Android device while on the go since your progress and game data are saved in the cloud. If you're not an Xbox Live member, signing up for a free membership through the game is easy and totally worth it\". \nWhile the game is free to play, there is one caveat -- it is sort of a 'freemium' model. In other words, without ponying up some money, you will see advertisements when playing. For $1.99 per month, you can go \"Premium\", which gets rid of the ads and delivers other little perks. \nQuite frankly, $24 a year is a lot to ask for an ad-free card game, but at least it is optional. For rest of the year, however, Microsoft will be giving the first month free to subscribers. At the very least, this should be a great way to kill time tomorrow during Thanksgiving if you find yourself bored at a family member's home. \nWill you try Microsoft Solitaire Collection on your iPhone, iPad, or Android device? Tell me in the comments.",

      "text": "By Andy Weir Senior   @gcaweir Â· 4 seconds ago with 0 comments \nIn June, Microsoft announced its intention to purchase professional networking platform LinkedIn, in an all-cash deal worth $26.2 billion . Such a massive acquisition - Microsoft's largest to date - requires regulatory approval, and it looks like Microsoft is finally going to get the green light from authorities in the European Union. \nRegulators must consider the potential impact of such a deal on the wider market, including the possibility that it could stifle competition. Salesforce was among those to have objected to the acquisition, claiming that it \"raises significant antitrust and data privacy issues that need to be fully scrutinized by competition and data privacy authorities in the United States and in the European Union\". \nEU antitrust regulators also voiced concerns about the acquisition , prompting Microsoft to propose some concessions in an effort to allay fears that the deal might limit competition in the European market. Reuters reports that the European Commission has requested 'tweaks' to those concessions, following further consultation with interested parties, including rivals and customers. But according to multiple sources, the EC is now satisfied with the modified concessions, and is preparing to formally approve the deal. \nThe EC is due to announce its decision on, or before, December 6. Microsoft has already received approval for the acquisition from regulators in the US, Canada, Brazil and South Africa.",

      "text": "Microsoft CEO Nadella wants to build the ultimate mobile device Microsoft CEO Nadella wants to build the ultimate mobile device Posted: Tags : Windows - Windows + Microsoft - Microsoft + Microsoft has not had much luck in the mobile phone business. Perhaps that is why we seem surprised by the recent comments made by CEO Satya Nadella. While the executive admits that Microsoft has missed the entire mobile boom, he states that Microsoft will continue to stay in the phone market with \"unique features,\" and will build the most ultimate mobile device.Last year, Microsoft wrote down $7.6 million , which was the approximate amount of what it spent to buy Nokia Devices and Services in 2014. Now that Microsoft has cleared the decks on its balance sheet, will it build the long rumored Surface Phone? Nadella says that Microsoft won't return to the industry without bringing something different to the table.Pointing to the enterprise-focused HP Elite x3 Windows 10 Mobile handset, Microsoft's CEO says that his company already has a role in \"structural innovation\" in the smartphone world. The focus now is on productivity, management and security. And those certainly sound like buzzwords related to the business world. That meas that those who have talked about a Surface Phone being directed at the enterprise could be right. The Lumia line apparently failed to connect with consumers. But companies are an easier sell for Microsoft since most are familiar with Windows. So instead of rushing back into an industry where it will have to battle Samsung and Apple for consumers' cash, Nadella is biding his time until Microsoft can come up with something so different that it becomes an easier sell. \"We will continue to be in the phone market not as defined by today's market leaders, but by what it is that we can uniquely do in what is the most ultimate mobile device. Therefore [with Nokia assets], we stopped doing things that were me-too and started doing things, even if they are today very sub-scale, to be very focused on a specific set of customers who need a specific set of capabilities that are differentiated and that we can do a good job of.\"-Satya Nadella-CEO, Microsoft PhoneArena is on Instagram .

      "text": "Microsoft today announced Office 365 is now available in 10 new countries: Bhutan, Cambodia, Greenland, Guadeloupe, Laos, Maldives, Martinique, Mozambique, Myanmar, and Vatican City. This brings the total for Office 365 to 150 markets, with support for 44 languages.\nEven after a quarter of a century, Office is still incredibly important to Microsoftâs bottom line. Office 365 is a prime example of the company successfully transitioning from a traditional software model to a subscription revenue stream. Last quarter , the company added 0.9 million subscribers for a total of 24 million. Office commercial products and cloud services revenue grew 5 percent, with Office 365 revenue up 51 percent.\nThat said, Microsoft estimates that over 1.2 billion people around the world use Office. That figure encompasses those who use the software suite at home, at work, and/or at school. \nBut Microsoft is most focused on growing Office 365 availability, since thatâs the productâs future. This map shows the remaining countries that have yet to be added to the fold:\n\nAdding the 10 latest countries wasnât as simple as flipping a switch. The Office team explains:\nAs our service expands, we are mindful of the incredible and increasing diversity of Office users. This latest market expansion required innovative engineering work to create new languages, cultures and currencies. Our team works tirelessly to meet the highest levels of security, compliance and feature parity so that we can deliver the same first-class experience in Office 365 to every market where itâs offered.\nItâs worth underlining that Microsoft is using the word âmarketâ and not âcountryâ on purpose. There are 196 countries in the world today, but the company plans to launch Office 365 in âa further 97 markets over the next year.â That would bring the total to 247 markets â the extra markets are differentiated by certain cultural and language differences that require more work on Microsoftâs part, even if they are part of the same geographic country.\n",

      "text": "Microsoft Releases Solitaire For iOS And Android  30 PST \nIf youâve ever used Windows then you might have played Solitaire. Itâs a small game that has been included in every major Windows release for more than 25 years. It has been limited to Microsoftâs platform for over two decades but the company is now expanding the gameâs reach beyond its own platform. Microsoft has confirmed today that it has released Solitaire for iOS and Android. \nThe game thatâs headed to iOS and Android is actually called Solitaire Collection and the best part is that itâs going to be available as a free download. \nThe company says that more than 119 million people have played this game on Windows 8 and Windows 10 so itâs now looking for more players to join in the fun on iOS and Android. \nMicrosoft Solitaire Collection features Spider, FreeCell, Klondike, Tripeaks, and Pyramid game types. Players will also be able to compete in daily challenges. Xbox Live is integrated so players can sign in and compete with friends. \nThe company is also going to offer a Premium Edition of Solitaire Collection for $1.99 per month which is going to provide an ad-free experience as well as double coin rewards for game boosts and daily challenges. \nItâs not like you canât already find a plethora of Solitaire games on iOS and Android but many of us remember having played this game so that nostalgic effect works well in Microsoftâs favor. Solitaire Collection is now available as a free download from the App Store and the Google Play Store . \nFiled in Gaming . Read more about Android , iOS and Microsoft . Related Articles",

      "text": "Microsoft's foray into room video conferencing is taking shape as the vendor integrates Skype for Business with hardware components from video partners.\nMicrosoft is expanding Skype for Business as hardware products from its Project Rigel initiative become available for purchase. Project Rigel, announced earlier this year, is a partnership with video conferencing hardware vendors Logitech, Polycom and Crestron to integrate Skype for Business with room video conferencing systems.\n\"It's an opportunity to expand from just a desktop collaboration product to be the center of meetings,\" said Nemertes Research analyst Irwin Lazar.\nUntil now, Skype for Business has not penetrated the meeting room, said Joan Vandermate, head of video collaboration marketing at Logitech. Organizations that have Skype for Business on the desktop usually have room video conferencing services from Cisco or Polycom.\nIt's an opportunity to expand from just a desktop collaboration product to be the center of meetings. Irwin Lazar analyst, Nemertes Research But with integrated room system hardware, Microsoft can offer a unified Skype for Business video experience across the organization. The initiative also adds to Microsoft's rivalry with Cisco in the unified communications space as Microsoft can now compete in conference room video.\nIf an organization uses Cisco for room video conferencing but is moving to a Microsoft desktop environment, the organization can buy hardware from Microsoft's video conferencing partners for an integrated Skype for Business room deployment, Lazar said.\n\"It's the last bastion,\" Vandermate added. \"It's the last place Microsoft hasn't been able to knock Cisco out of.\"",

      "text": "By Foo Yun Chee | BRUSSELS \nMicrosoft ( MSFT.O ) is set to gain EU approval for its $26 billion buy of professional social network LinkedIn ( LNKD.N ) with tweaks to concessions aimed at addressing competition concerns, three people close to the matter said on Wednesday. \nMicrosoft last week told the European Commission that it would still allow LinkedInâs rivals access to its software such as its Outlook program and give hardware makers the option of installing competing professional social networks on computers after the acquisition. \nThe second plank of the concession is important because of the companyâs battle with the EU competition authority over the last decade and the policy of tying its products to block rivals, resulting in fines of more than 2.2 billion euros. \nThe slight modifications came following feedback from rivals and customers, the people said, declining to provide details because of the sensitivity of the issue. \nThe deal, Microsoftâs largest ever acquisition, will allow the company to add a suite of sales, marketing and recruiting services to its core business products as it gears up for next-generation computing. \nHowever, it came amidst regulatory concerns and citizensâ worries about big data and that some companies may use the huge amount of information they gather to squeeze out competitors and encroach on usersâ privacy. \nThe deal has been criticized by U.S. rival Salesforce ( CRM.N ), which lost out on the bidding for LinkedIn and which urged regulators to examine the antitrust and data privacy issues thoroughly before approving it. \nThe Commission, which is scheduled to decide on the deal by Dec. 6, as well as Microsoft, declined to comment. \nAuthorities in the United States, Canada, Brazil and South Africa have already nodded through the acquisition without demanding concessions. \nThe bulk of LinkedInâs $3 billion annual revenue comes from job hunters and recruiters who pay a monthly fee to post resumes and connect with people. \n(Reporting by Foo Yun Chee; editing by Robin Emmott) Share This:",

      "text": "Building an application on Azure while ensuring that the resources being properly, optimally used by that application is a challenging task. To curb this challenge, Microsoft has recently introduced a public preview of Azure Advisor.\nThis article provides a quick, high-level overview of Microsoft Azure Advisor (preview) with a practical example.\nFor novice cloud developers, aspiring cloud architects, pre-sales consultants, and all other IT professionals associated with cloud computing, especially with Microsoft Azure, this tutorial will explain the importance and capabilities of the Microsoft Azure Advisor.\nQuick High-Level Overview As defined, Azure Advisor is â a personalized recommendation engine that provides proactive best practices guidance for optimally configuring your Azure resources. â\nIts capabilities to recommend and analyze resource configuration and usage telemetry for identifying any possible threats or risk makes Azure Advisor a solid mentor to rely on.\nThe best part is that it not only provides recommendations with respect to resources but also provides step-by-step guidance and walks you through implementing the fixes.\nPrerequisites Microsoft Azure account.\nAccess to at least one subscription.\nYour role must be either Owner, Contributor, or Reader for the subscription\nLetâs Start There are three ways to open Azure Advisor Dashboard, for all you need to , \nGo to the  Microsoft Azure portal  and log in with your Azure account credentials . \nFor the first, click âMore Servicesâ => Type âAdvisorâ at top text box => Azure Advisor \n\n\n\nOr, click âMore Servicesâ => Go to âMonitoring + Managementâ => Azure Advisor \n\n\n\nOr third, click on your subscription. (This appears only once).\nOnce you've performed any of the above steps, you will be redirected over to the Azure Advisor Dashboard,\nClick on Get Started and you will see the below screen:\n\n\n\nYour subscription will be listed under the Subscription dropdown. You can see the resources provisioned with the selected subscription be listed under the \"Resource groups\" dropdown.\n\nHere, you can select all the resources listed or specific resources you want Azure Advisor to analyze, as shown in the image below.\n\nActive or snoozed may be used for as a reminder for listed recommendations.\n\n\n\nClick on the â Get recommendations â button to allow Azure Advisor to analyze resources and providing recommendations. The recommendations are divided into four categories.\nHigh Availability â to ensure and improve the continuity of your applications.\nSecurity â to detect threats that could lead to potential security breaches.\nPerformance â to enhance the speed of your applications.\nCost â to optimize and reduce your overall Azure spending.\nAny recommendations will be displayed as shown below.\n\n\n\nClick on â Recommendationsâ  listed under the Resource section. Details of the recommendations will be displayed in another blade. Here, you can sort recommendations by description, resource, state, and severity.\n\nYou can also pin recommendations to the dashboard or just dismiss it from the list, as seen below:\n\n\n\nLetâs try to implement one recommendation from the list. As mentioned earlier, it not only recommends but also guides you through a step-by-step process to implement them.\nFor this article , will select, â Provide security contact details â with Medium severity. Click it to continue.\nAs you can see, it opens a window for providing security contact details as recommended.\n\nOnce you enter the required information, the \"Recommendations\" state updates to â In progress â from â Openâ and will get resolved later.\n\n\n\nPoints to Remember Subscription owners and contributors can compute/generate recommendations.

Last week, we reported that Microsoft has offered concessions to EU to get approval for its LinkedIn buy after the EU competition enforcer expressed concerns about the deal at a meeting with Microsoft executives. According to Reuters, Microsoft assured EC that it would allow LinkedInâs rivals access to its software such as Outlook and also allow hardware OEMs to install competing professional social networks on PCs after the acquisition. As per the sources of Reuters, Microsoft will get approval from EU for its LinkedIn buy with tweaks to concessions aimed at addressing competition concerns.\nThe slight modifications came following feedback from rivals and customers, the people said, declining to provide details because of the sensitivity of the issue.\nThe EU competition authority can either approve the deal or approve it with some conditions or it can open a formal investigation if it has serious concerns. The Commission will rule on the deal by Dec. 6.\nRead more about it here .",

      "text": "News \nSolitaire has been bundled with Windows since version 3.0, released all the way back in 1990. With Windows 8, Microsoft replaced it with 'Microsoft Solitaire Collection.' The new version offered more game modes, as well as achievements and cloud saves through Xbox Live, but famously included banner and full-screen advertisements unless you paid for the Premium edition. \n\nToday Microsoft has released Solitaire Collection for Android and iOS. The mobile versions have all the functionality of the Windows 10/Windows 10 Mobile game, including achievements, cloud sync, and daily challenges. \nTo celebrate the release on Android and iOS, users will receive one free month of Premium Edition, which normally costs $1.99. Microsoft is sticking with the ad-supported model, which means removing ads either costs $1.99/month or $9.99/year. With so many free alternatives available, I can't imagine many people will be paying.",

      "title": "Microsoftâs Concessions to EU Include Special Outlook Deal",
      "text": "Translate \nMicrosoft is promising the European Commission it will offer its rivals access to its Outlook add-ins program in a bid to get the agency to sign off on its $26-billion acquisition of professional social network LinkedIn. \nAccording to The Wall Street Journal , Microsoftâs offer means that profiles from rival social networks would be able to appear in Outlook. \nThe software giant has said it will also permit PC makers such as Dell and HP to disable a LinkedIn shortcut that is packaged on the desktop of some computers. \nMicrosoft recently met with European Commission officials to discuss a deal in a bid to avoid anti-trust charges as well as the resulting fine. Until now, however, the media had no idea what concessions Microsoft had offered. \nMicrosoft in June announced its intention to acquire LinkedIn for $26.2 billion in cash. The deal is Microsoftâs largest acquisition to-date, and would give the software king access to the professional social networkâs 433 million members. \nMicrosoftâs success in wooing LinkedIn left Salesforce, which also tried to acquire the professional social networking firm, out in the cold. \nSince then, Salesforce has been vocal in its opposition of the deal, asking regulators to block it, saying that rivals will not be given access to LinkedInâs dataset of users. \nSalesforce said if it had purchased LinkedIn it would âhave used the data within our own services appropriately and also licensed it to others,â adding the âchances of Microsoft doing the same without government intervention are slim.â It is not known if Microsoft plans to address that concern. \nThe Commission, which will rule on the matter by Dec. 6, will first seek feedback from rivals and customers before deciding if it will accept Microsoftâs concessions. If it does not accept them, the Commission could demand more concessions or opt to embark on a full investigation. Jennifer Cowan is the Managing Editor for SiteProNews. Related Posts",

      "text": "0 0 \nIt seems that Microsoft is trying to make more and more people ditch third-party antivirus applications and start using Windows Defender. The company just released the Windows Defender Hub application for the Windows PC users as a result. The application can be downloaded and installed from the Windows Store . \nThis application will only open the Windows Defender interface and display news regarding new viruses, links to blog posts from Windows Defender and other tips that will help you keep your computer clean. With this application, you will be able to scan your computer and check its protection status as well. \nWeâre not sure why Microsoft has not added access to the Windows Firewall Settings from the Windows Defender Hub. The company could have also added additional configuration options which would allow users to tweak security settings in order to improve Windows 10 security. \nIf you want quick access to Windows Defender and read about new viruses and malware, we suggest you install this application on your Windows 10 PC. In order to do so, open the Windows Store, search for Windows Defender Hub and click the âFREEâ button. We hope that Microsoft will add some more features to the Windows Defender Hub because, currently, this application looks quite simple. \nHowever, we remind you that according to specialists, Windows Defender is not as good as other third-party antivirus applications. In other words, if you want to make sure that your computer stays more secure, you should purchase a third-party antivirus application that will offer much more protection than free Windows Defender. \nAre you using Windows Defender on your Windows 10 PC ? Do you think that this application is good enough to keep your computer clean? \nRELATED STORIES TO CHECK OUT:",

      "text": "0 0 \nMicrosoft has slashed the prices of a few of its products as an offer for its consumers on Black Friday. They have even set up a dedicated page for Black Friday deals whose discounts will be up on Microsoftâs Online store starting Wednesday, November 23rd at 9pm Pacific Time. As for Microsoft Stores, they will be open for customers to enjoy holiday discounts starting November 24th, the day after the online sale goes live. From November 25th, all participating Microsoft Stores will be good to go for Black Friday. \nThe Black Friday deals extend from smartphones to laptops and from consoles to gaming hardware. While browsing through its details, we noticed something that didnât really fit in, though. The Lumia 950 XL (currently priced at $499) and the HP Elite x3 (currently priced at $799 with a Desk Dock) show some out of the ordinary discounted pricing. The numbers shown as âsavingsâ donât add up and, moreover, there was no additional detail on the site explaining the strange price tag. \nWhen contacted, Microsoft elaborated the specifications of their Black Friday offers for Lumia 950 XL and HP Elite X3. As part of its Black Friday offers, Microsoft, starting from November 24, will be throwing in a free unlocked Lumia 950 ($379.05 value) and a free Microsoft Display Dock ($99 value) with the purchase of $499 Lumia 950 XL . An HP Elite x3 Bundle, including the handset priced for $799 , the HP Laptop Dock priced for $599 , a free silicon case and a free screen protector, all for just $1,148 allowing consumers to save $313. \nMicrosoft offered a similar deal back in April, giving away Lumia 950 with the purchase of Lumia 950 XL sans the Display Dock for US and Canadian residents. \nIf you are looking for similar deals from the commencement of the Black Friday sale until Cyber Monday, which is on November 28th, the Microsoft Surface Pro 4 will be offered with discounts as high as $429. \nBuzz up out comments section if you are willing to take advantage any of these offers amazing Black Friday deals .",

      "text": "by Brandon Hill â Wednesday, November 23, 2016 Microsoft Brings Solitaire Collection to Android And iOS Platforms, Enables Xbox Live Support Who hasnât played a few rounds of Solitaire on a Windows PC when looking to pass the time? I know I spent too many hours playing the game in my high school drafting classes during the 90s (along with excessive amounts of Worms and the original SimCity ). Microsoftâs take on Solitaire goes all the way back to Windows 3.0 in 1990, and now Microsoft is bringing the game to competing platforms.\nMicrosoft announced today that the version of Solitaire included in Windows 10 will come to mobile gamers who carry around iPad s, iPhone s, and Samsung Galaxy smartphones (among other devices). Called the Solitaire Collection , the bundle actually includes five Solitaire card games: Klondike, Spider, FreeCell, Pyramid and Tripeaks . \nThe Solitaire Collection is provided free of charge, but you will have to put up with ads for that privilege. The free version does, however, include one month free of Premium Edition, which gets rid of the ads and doubles the coin bonus for daily challenges. If youâd prefer to roll with the Premium Edition full-time, it will set you back $1.99 per month. \nTo help further entice iOS and Android gamers to choose its version of Solitaire over the hundreds of versions available across the App Store and Google Play, Microsoft has baked in support for Xbox Live . This allows you to play online against friends, earn Achievements and continue your progress across multiple devices and platforms. \nMicrosoft adds that in the past four years, over 119 million people have played Solitaire on Windows 8, Windows 10 and Windows Mobile platforms. You can download Microsoft Solitaire Collection from Google Play and the App Store .",

The app works by connecting the PC with a home network that also has an Xbox One connected. Rift owners are then asked to choose between several VR environments to get started. \nâRift works natively with Windows 10, which makes it easy to set up, jump in and have an incredible VR gaming experience,â the company said in a statement. âCombined with DirectX 12 technology that unlocks the full capabilities of new Windows 10 graphics hardware, made-for-VR games on Windows 10 will have the fastest frame rates and top performance. \nMeanwhile, Microsoft also announced that Windows 10 PCs can now handle Netflix 4K content, with Windows 10 users also receiving some exclusive Netflix 4K content, including Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life , premiering Nov. 25.

      "text": "Malwarebytes Telecrypt Decryptor is a free program for devices running Microsoft Windows to decrypt files that are encrypted by the ransomware Telecrypt.\nTelecrypt is a rather troubling piece of ransomware that is distributed through various means including emails, exploits, and drive by downloads.\nWhat makes Telecrypt special is that it uses the API of the popular messaging service TeleGram for communication, and not a control server or servers on the Internet.\nTeleGram communication is encrypted and the team behind the service has released an open API and protocol for anyone to use.\nTeleCrypt will encrypt files on the system, and launches a program which informs users about the encryption. The ransomware looks for more than hundred different file types including jpg, xlsx, docx, mp3, 7z, torrent or ppt.\nMalwarebytes Telecrypt Decryptor \nThe decrypter has been developed by Malwarebytes. It requires that you have access to a good copy of one of the encrypted files. The file type does not matter at all.\nYour best chances are backups, online cloud storage used by sync software, or any other form of back up space that you may have access to. A suggestion that Malwarebytes has is to use sample photos that Windows ships with, as they are usually easy to get hold of. You may also re-download email attachments if email is kept on a mail server.\nYou need to load the encrypted file, and the good copy, on the screen that opens. Once you have done so, click the start button and follow the process.\nTelecrypt Decryptor verifies the files that you have supplied. If the files match and are encrypted by the encryption scheme that Telecrypt uses, you are taken to the second page of the program interface.\nHere you may either add the list of files that the ransomware has encrypted on the device, or may point the program to a single folder containing encrypted files.\nYou may copy any encrypted files to a single folder location, and pick the folder decrypt option to decrypt all files copied to the folder at once.\nIt is suggested that you work with backup files and not the original files to avoid any issues that may arise during the process.\nYou find additional instructions and screenshots on the Malwarebytes blog .\nNow You : Have you ever been the victim of a ransomware attack?\nGhacks needs you. You can find out how to support us here or support the site directly by becoming a Patreon . Thank you for being a Ghacks reader.\nThe post Malwarebytes releases Telecrypt ransomware Decrypter appeared first on gHacks Technology News .\n",

      "text": "\nIn September 2010, Nokia announced it had hired Stephen Elop, formerly of Microsoft. In a surprise move, he became the new CEO for the Finland-based mobile phone company. Then in February 2011, Elop announced that Nokia had signed a partnership with Microsoft to make Windows Phone its primary smartphone operating system, ahead of Nokiaâs own Symbian OS.\nAt the time, Nokia was still the biggest maker of mobile phones, but with the launch of the iPhone and the Android OS a few years earlier, the company knew that it needed to make some changes to stay competitive. Unfortunately, it hooked its saddle onto the wrong horse in this race with Windows Phone. Indeed, many people at the time questioned why Elop and Nokia didnât start creating Android phones instead.\nNokiaâs new Android-powered smartphones might arrive at MWC 2017 Nokia will rise again, says newly-appointed marketing chief \nWhole books will likely be written about Nokiaâs fall from the mobile phone market in the future\nWhole books will likely be written about Nokiaâs fall from the mobile phone market in the future. In short, the gamble with Windows Phone ultimately didnât work, and in September of 2013, it was announced that the companyâs Devices and Services division was being sold to Microsoft, which was then being run by CEO Steve Ballmer. That deal was completed in 2014, but Microsoft failed to use the resources it bought from Nokia to make a dent against the iPhone and Android phones in the smartphone market. Under its current CEO Satya Nadella, Microsoft has since laid off nearly every former Nokia employee it brought in with the company in 2014 and shut down all of its phone manufacturing facilities. As part of its deal with Microsoft, Nokia could not launch any new smartphones until at least the fourth quarter of 2016. \nJust a few months before the deal for Microsoft to buy Nokiaâs phone division closed, Nokia did in fact launch three Android-based phones as its swan song in the phone business in early 2014: the Nokia X, X+ and XL. However, after the deal closed, Microsoft quickly shut down the Android phone lineup. In 2015, the company launched the Android-based N1 tablet , as its agreement with Microsoft did not cover tablet products.\nSee also: HMD global gearing up for release of its Nokia Android phones 3 weeks ago \nThe name 'Nokia' continues to be one of the most well known properties in mobile phones worldwide\nThe Nokia brand name continues to be one of the most well known properties in mobile phones worldwide, and the company clearly wants to go back and compete with Apple, Samsung and others in the industry. Earlier this year, the company announced that it is offering its brand name and IP to a new company called HMD Global. This new company is based in Nokiaâs home country of Finland, and has a number of former Nokia team members on board. It will design new smartphones and tablets , and yes, they will use Android as the OS. Nokia will not be a direct investor in HMD, but it will be setting âmandatory brand requirements and performance related provisionsâ for the company to follow as it creates its new mobile devices. There are already some rumors about what those first phones will be like in terms of hardware, but at the moment nothing is confirmed yet, so take any of those reports with a big grain of salt. Android-powered Nokia phones are coming in 2017\nA few days ago, Nokia confirmed that smartphones with its branding will launch sometime in 2017 . Itâs possible that the official announcement will come at the Mobile World Congress trade show in Barcelona, Spain in February. While the name is still well known, it will take a lot of effort, and ultimately time, to take market share away from the companies that have been working on Android phones for the past few years. However, it is not impossible. Here are five things that I personally think HMD will need to do to have a successful smartphone launch in 2017.\nDonât be afraid to innovate \nEven though Nokia saddled itself with Windows Phone as its OS for a few years, it still made big strides in smartphone hardware and software. The Lumia 1020, with its 41MP rear camera, launched in 2013, and has yet to be surpassed in terms of megapixels for smartphones. The company also released a number of apps that were ahead of its time, including AR apps before it became a trend, and more. In short, HMD needs to offer things that no other smartphone company has yet to release, yet still make those features attractive to consumers as well. That wonât be easy, but if Nokia could do it with Windows Phone, then HMD can with Android.\nRelease smartphones for every audience Nokia launched Windows Phone devices that reached large audiences, ranging from the 6-inch Lumia 1520 for high-end users, to the budget-priced 4-inch Lumia 520. HMD must also offer a range of devices that will be embraced by people who just need a cheap phone all the way to customers who want to get all of the latest in hardware and software.\nIgnore the tablet industry for now \nThe tablet industry is in a bit of a slowdown\nIn its announcement, HMD said it would also be designing tablets as well as phones. However, it might be a mistake to begin a launch of products with a tablet device. Frankly, the tablet industry itself is in a bit of a slowdown, as more people are embracing 2-in-1 devices like the Surface lineup from Microsoft. While we think HMD could make a great 2-in-1 tablet or notebook in the future, itâs perhaps best if they hold off and concentrate on the smartphone market for its product launches in 2017. Keep the nostalgia factor of the Nokia brand Many people have fond memories of using a Nokia mobile phone, including listening to its classic ringtone. HMD needs to use that song and other items from the history of its partner company in new and clever ways to help promote and market its new smartphones. It will certainly help to break the Nokia name away from its Windows Phone days.\nDonât even mention Microsoft or Windows Phone \nThereâs likely still a lot of bad blood at the current incarnation of Nokia about the decision to partner with Microsoft and go all in with Windows Phone. There might be a temptation for HMD to take a few pot shots at Elop and Windows Phone when they launch their smartphone products with the Nokia brand. However, we think that would be in poor taste. Itâs best not to mention that part of Nokiaâs past at all, except to perhaps highlight some of the companyâs smartphone innovations that it had with its Lumia family. The names âMicrosoftâ, âWindows Phoneâ and Elop should be ignored completely in the relaunch.\nConclusions: High hopes and expectations The return of the Nokia name to the smartphone market will likely be one of the most anticipated in 2017, and there will likely be some high expectations from HMD to delivery. We think that it can do just that, if it can combine innovative features and a wide range of devices with the Android OS backing it up.\nWhat do you think of the Nokia name returning to smartphones next year? Can HMD launch a series of devices that can compete with the major companies? What do you think it should do to ensure a successful rebirth of the company brand in the smartphone market?

      "text": "By Queenie Wong / November 23, 2016 at 11:45 AM \nMicrosoftâs $26 billion bid for LinkedIn is expected to gain approval from the European Union after the tech firm offered concession to quell competition concerns from its rivals. \nReuters, citing anonymous sources , reported that Microsoft has proposed giving its competitors access to its Outlook program. It would also allow computer manufacturers to display profiles of professional social networks outside of LinkedIn. \nMicrosoft has been fined more than $2.2 billion euros over the last decade for bundling its products to block rivals, the media outlet reported. The European Commission, the EUâs antitrust regulator, is expected to complete its review of the merger by Dec. 6, which is Microsoftâs largest to date. \nIn September, Salesforce.com raised antitrust and privacy concerns about Microsoftâs purchase of the business-oriented social media network, arguing that the tech firm will be able to deny competitors access to LinkedInâs data. \nSalesforce wanted to buy LinkedIn too, but lost out to Microsoft in June. With the EU set to approve the Microsoft-LinkedIn deal, it looks like the software company will be out of luck. \n\nPhoto: People walk past a Microsoft office in New York on October 6, 2015.

      "text": "Microsoft has faced a tough battle getting its $26 billion acquisition of LinkedIn approved in Europe. Salesforce has challenged the move on competitive grounds, and the EU competition authority has reached out to a number of competitors for comment. Now Microsoft reportedly is suggesting a set of concessions to European regulators in an attempt to get the deal approved.\n\nThe tech titan has suggested that LinkedIn's competitors could create add-ins that let their content show up inside Outlook, according to the Wall Street Journal. Specifically, the add-ins would let competing social networks display their information in Outlook, so users could do things like see someoneâs profile in a calendar entry.\n\nTo read this article in full or to leave a comment, please click here",

      "title": "Satya Nadella: Microsoft building the 'ultimate mobile device'",
      "text": "By James Walker 7 mins ago in Technology Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has again reaffirmed the company's commitment to developing smartphones. Unfazed by its market share dropping beneath 1%, Nadella said Microsoft is looking to the future and planning a revolutionary \"ultimate mobile device.\" Nadella made the comments during an interview with the Australian Financial Review . He visited Sydney last week to address a local developers conference about Microsoft's cognitive computing systems and Azure cloud services. Nadella outlined his plans for Microsoft's future involvement with smartphones. He suggested the company has stopped trying to rival the established leaders in the field. Instead, Microsoft is working on something for the future that it thinks will give it the upper-hand in the long term. Nadella hinted at an \"ultimate mobile device\" that could give Microsoft a credible presence in the industry. The company seems keen to develop a product with unique capabilities that aren't replicated by its rivals. A key feature that already fits this description is the company's Continuum tech, Windows 10 Mobile's ability to transform itself into a desktop PC at a moment's notice. \"We will continue to be in the phone market not as defined by today's market leaders, but by what it is that we can uniquely do in what is the most ultimate mobile device,\" Nadella said . \"Therefore [with Nokia assets], we stopped doing things that were me-too and started doing things, even if they are today very sub-scale, to be very focused on a specific set of customers who need a specific set of capabilities that are differentiated and that we can do a good job of.\" Continuum on Windows 10 Mobile - when connected to a display, the phone powers a Windows 10 desktop experience via a dock Microsoft October 2015 Live Event Some widespread rumours have now long suggested Microsoft could relaunch its mobile efforts under its established and popular Surface brand. Nadella avoided direct discussion of the elusive \"Surface Phone,\" instead saying Microsoft is not prepared to launch a new handset just for the sake of competing with others. He expressed a desire to wait and develop something unique and valuable, rather than rushing another ill-fated Windows phone to market. \"We don't want to be driven by just envy of what others have, the question is, what can we bring? That's where I look at any device form factor or any technology, even AI,\" said Nadella . Currently, Microsoft's mobile selling point is the productivity and security features of Windows 10 Mobile. The platform also features rich management capabilities that have made it popular with some large organisations . Nadella appears to be hinting at more distinguishing features being in the pipeline, again aimed at professionals and businesses rather than consumers. One standout capability could be x86 app emulation on Windows 10 devices, allowing traditional Windows desktop programs to be run on smartphone processors. While this wouldn't make sense on a phone display, it could greatly expand the possibilities presented by Continuum. According to a report from ZDNet this week, Microsoft is actively working to enable x86 on ARM emulation by fall 2017, coinciding with the \" Redstone 3 \" Windows 10 update. It's also thought Microsoft may be collaborating with HP to build a new premium Windows 10 phone for launch early next year. Windows 10 Mobile may be a long way from catching up with iOS and Android but Microsoft appears committed to the platform in the long-term. How exactly smartphones will fit into the company's future remains unclear but Microsoft has consistently said it's not ready to let Windows Mobile disappear entirely.",

      "title": "Xiaomi is pre-installing Cortana on its Mi MIX smartphone",
      "text": "\nItâs no secret that some Android OEMs, including Samsung, have been pre-installing some Microsoft apps on their Android apps as part of a partnership with Microsoft. Xiaomi, one of the biggest players in the Chinese tech market also teamed up with Microsoft to pre-install its Android apps on their devices back in June. In return, Microsoft sold more than a thousand patents to the company. Initially, Microsoft and Xiaomi announced that Xiaomi will be pre-installing Microsoftâs Office suite of apps (Word, Excel, PowerPoint) and Skype on its smartphones. And now, it looks like the company is also pre-installing Cortana on its devices such as the bezel-less Mi MIX.\n\nBack in June, the Senior Vice President at Xiaomi, Xiang Wang stated:\nâWe are excited to be working closely with Microsoft on a broad technology collaboration partnership. As demonstrated by this agreement with Microsoft, Xiaomi is looking to build sustainable, long-term partnerships with global technology leaders, with the ultimate goal of bringing the best user experience to our Mi fans.â\nXiaomi is likely the second company to pre-install Cortana on its devices, as Microsoft also teamed up with Cyanogen back in 2015 to integrate its services into the Cyanogen OS. As a result, devices like the OnePlus One got Cortana with an over-the-air update more than a year ago.\nAs for Microsoft, the company has done some pretty good stuff integrating Android with Windows 10. For example, the software giant brought some interesting features such as notification syncing to Cortana on Android with the Windows 10 Anniversary Update recently. Most recently, the company added a to-do list feature to Cortana on Android, Windows 10 (PC and Mobile) and iOS which was also very neat.\n",

      "text": "Microsoft's reported LinkedIn concessions don't amount to much To win EU approval for its buyout, Microsoft seems to be offering capabilities that aren't new U.S. Correspondent, IDG News Service | November 23, 2016 Email a friend   There was an error emailing this page. \nA pedestrian walks past a sign on Microsoft Headquarters campus July 17, 2014 in Redmond, Washington. Credit: Stephen Brashear/Getty Images for Microsoft More good reads $29.99 for the IT Security & Ethical Hacking Certification Training ($1,895... \nMicrosoft has faced a tough battle getting its $26 billion acquisition of LinkedIn approved in Europe. Salesforce has challenged the move on competitive grounds, and the EU competition authority has reached out to a number of competitors for comment. Now Microsoft reportedly is suggesting a set of concessions to European regulators in an attempt to get the deal approved. \nThe tech titan has suggested that LinkedIn's competitors could create add-ins that let their content show up inside Outlook, according to the Wall Street Journal . Specifically, the add-ins would let competing social networks display their information in Outlook, so users could do things like see someoneâs profile in a calendar entry. \nAllowing companies like German professional social network XING to get real estate inside Microsoft's email client may sound generous, but it's not much of a concession, all things considered. [ Best Bluetooth speakers: We'll help you find the best wireless speakers for pairing with your smartphone or tabletâwhatever your budget, and whatever music floats your boat. ] \nMicrosoft already offers an open platform for companies to create and publish Office add-ins, including those that run in Outlook. Any company can develop an add-in and distribute it through its own channels or Microsoft's Office Store, so long as it meets certain requirements around security and performance. \nIt's likely to be an even less appealing concession for Salesforce, which already has an Outlook add-in that it developed in partnership with Microsoft. The proposal also doesn't address one of Salesforce's leading concerns: that Microsoft is going to hoard LinkedIn's data, which it could use to gain a competitive edge in the CRM market. \nMicrosoft reportedly also proposed that manufacturers like Dell would be able to disable any sort of LinkedIn \"shortcut\" on computers they produce, in echoes of previous settlements the company has made around its bundling of browsers with Windows. \nMicrosoft declined to comment on the report, and a representative for Salesforce did not respond by press time. \nIt remains unclear how those suggested concessions have been received by regulators and whether the deal will be drawing to a close any time soon. Microsoft announced the blockbuster acquisition in June and said then that it expected the deal to close by the end of the year. Related:",

The app works by connected the PC with a home network that also has an Xbox One connected. Rift owners are then asked to choose between several VR environments to get started. \n\nMeanwhile, Microsoft also announced that Windows 10 PCs can now handle Netflix 4K content, with Windows 10 users also received some exclusive Netflix 4K content, including Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life , premiering Nov. 25. \n\nRead more at B&C.

      "title": "Microsoft gives third-parties access to Windows 10 Telemetry data",
      "text": "Microsoft struck a deal with security company FireEye recently according to a report on Australian news magazin Arn which gives FireEye access to all Windows 10 Telemetry data.\nThe report states that FireEye in return will provide Microsoft with the company's iSIGHT Intelligence software for Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection on Windows 10 devices.\nFireEye iSIGHT Intelligence is a proactive, forward-looking means of qualifying threats poised to disrupt business based on the intents, tools and tactics of the attacker.\nWindows Defender is built-in to Windows 10 and enabled by default unless other security software is recognized by the operating system.\nPro and Enterprise customers may upgrade to Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection featuring endpoint behavioral sensors, cloud security analysis and threat intelligence.\nThe news article suggests that the partnership benefits Microsoft, and specifically the reputation and credibility of the commercial version of Windows Defender.\nA press release by FireEye on November 3, 2016 provides additional details on the deal. The company's iSIGHT Intelligence software is available through Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection (WDATP) but not the free version of Windows Defender.\nWDATP customers gain access to several technical indicators that are provided by the software. These include the main motivation of the attacker, related tools, information about target sectors and geographies, and a description of the actor and operation.\nAccording to the report on ARN, security teams may also get their hands on Windows 10 Telemetry data via subscription billing models.\nThird-parties will get access to telemetry data of all Windows 10 devices. An overview of what that may include is provided on this Technet page .\nNeither FireEye, Microsoft or ARN reveal details on the range of Telemetry data that FireEye gains access to.\n\nWindows 10 Telemetry data is loosely sorted into the four groups security, basic, enhanced and full.\nTip: you can check the Telemetry level on any Windows 10 device by using Windows-I to open the Settings app, and checking the \"Diagnostics and usage data\" value under Privacy > Feedback & Diagnostics.\nSecurity level The Security level gathers only the telemetry info that is required to keep Windows devices, Windows Server, and guests protected with the latest security updates.\nData gathered at this level includes the Malicious Software Removal Tool reports, information that Windows Defender and Endpoint Protection require to function.\nThis includes anti-malware signatures, diagnostic information, User Account Control settings, UEFI settings, and IP address.\nNo user content, such as user files or communications, is gathered at the Security telemetry level, and we take steps to avoid gathering any information that directly identifies a company or user, such as name, email address, or account ID\nBasic Level The Basic level gathers a limited set of data thatâs critical for understanding the device and its configuration. This level also includes the Security level data.\nBasic device data such as attributes, Internet Explorer version, hardware information, operating system information, network attributes and more are collected at this level.\nCollected data includes app usage data, Internet Explorer add-ons, driver data, system data, Windows Store activity and more on top of that.\nEnhanced Level The Enhanced level gathers data about how Windows and apps are used and how they perform. This level also includes data from both the Basic and Security levels.\nOperating system events, app events, device specific events and \"some\" crash dump types are included at this level.\nFull Level The Full level gathers data necessary to identify and to help fix problems, following the approval process described below. This level also includes data from the Basic, Enhanced, and Security levels.\nMicrosoft may pull additional information from a device if the diagnostics request is approved by Microsoftâs privacy governance team, including privacy and other subject matter experts.\nClosing Words Terms of the deal are not known so that we don't know whether FireEye gets access to all Telemetry data or only to a snapshot.\nThe fact that Telemetry data is offered to third-parties is quite problematic however.\nNow You : What's your take on this?\nGhacks needs you.

      "text": "Computing giant Microsoft joins open source software focused group The Linux Foundation as âPlatinumâ member, with board representation. The Linux Foundation recently scored a significant new member in Microsoft, which joined the open source-focused organization as a âPlatinumâ member. The coup was announced by Microsoft at its recent Connect developer event.\nThe computing software giant has increasingly pushed its focus into the open source world, including recently releasing the open source .Net Core 1.0 platform; saddled up with Canonical to deploy Ubuntu on Windows 10; partnered with FreeBSD on releasing a version of its Azure cloud platform; and in acquiring Xamarin moved its software development kit to open source.\nâAs a cloud platform company we aim to help developers achieve more using the platforms and languages they know,â said Scott Guthrie, EVP for Microsoft Cloud and Enterprise Group, in a statement. âThe Linux Foundation is home not only to Linux, but many of the communityâs most innovative open source projects. We are excited to join The Linux Foundation and partner with the community to help developers capitalize on the shift to intelligent cloud and mobile experiences.â\nAs part of its Platinum membership, which reports indicate typically runs $500,000, Microsoft placed John Gossman, architect on its Azure team, on The Linux Foundation board of directors. Other Platinum members include Cisco, Fujitsu, Hewlett-Packard Enterprise, Huawei, IBM, Intel, NEC, Oracle, Qualcomm and Samsung.\nThe move came as a surprise to some as Microsoftâs past history of basing platforms on proprietary software seemed counter to what The Linux Foundation was attempting to do. That history was somewhat noticeable in comments from the open source group in connection with the announcement.\nâMicrosoft has grown and matured in its use of and contributions to open source technology,â said Jim Zemlin, executive director at The Linux Foundation. âThe company has become an enthusiastic supporter of Linux and of open source and a very active member of many important projects. Membership is an important step for Microsoft, but also for the open source community at large, which stands to benefit from the companyâs expanding range of contributions.â\nThe Linux Foundation houses a number of telecom-focused open source working groups like Open Platform Network Functions Virtualization and OpenDaylight.\nBored?

      "text": "\nWe all have only so many days on this green earth, and Microsoft is suggesting you do not waste them waiting on your PC to boot each day.\nAccording to their research PCs more than 3 years old take 65% longer to boot up than newer PCs, resulting on UK users wasting on average 23.5 hours a year waiting to get started.\nBesides no longer wasting your few days Microsoft also has other reasons why your should splash out on a new PC this holiday season. According to their research if your PC is more than 3 years old you are likely to spend 3.5 times longer attempting to fix issues such as viruses. Microsoft notes that older, slower PCs are also a major source of frustration, with nearly two-thirds (65%) of those with a computer between five and 10 years old admitted to either hitting or shouting at it in frustration and around six per cent even saying computer issues had driven them to tears or drink.\nThe issue most affects those who have the fewest time to lose, with 19% of over 55âs having PCs more than 5 years old, losing them two hours a month in boot-up time. Many are not even aware that modern PCs can be voice controlled (42% unaware) and that you can log in via facial recognition, with the majority thinking this is more than two years away.\nThe take away message is clearly that now is the time to buy a new PC, leaving more time to stop and smell the roses, before the cold embrace of death takes you away.\nSee Microsoftâs new Surface range here .",

      "text": "Microsoft picks SAP for core HCM tools and global talent management by Dan Ring News Writer Microsoft chooses SAP SuccessFactors for core HR and talent management, and SAP selects Microsoft Azure as a preferred public cloud-based service for SuccessFactors products.   \nIn a high-profile customer win for SAP, Microsoft has begun to implement SAP SuccessFactors HCM tools, including Employee Central, with plans to roll it out for its 114,000 full-time global employees.

But SAP is now touting Microsoft and other big new users, and Oracle said it is growing more than twice as fast as Workday in software as a service (SaaS) . Phased rollout planned \nMicrosoft chose SuccessFactors HCM tools partly for their global capabilities, flexibility and open platform strategy, according to SAP. The company will conduct a phased rollout of the HCM Suite, said Vivan Mirchandani, senior director of business operations at Microsoft, in response to emailed questions. \nMicrosoft recently went live with SAP SuccessFactors Succession Planning and Learning Management systems, and its next area of focus will be to implement Employee Central , which is core HR , and onboarding, Mirchandani said, adding that Microsoft is also evaluating Workforce Planning and Workforce Analytics for implementation. Recruiting is also part of the suite purchased by Microsoft. \n\"No decisions have been made at this time about additional modules that we will look to implement,\" he said. Microsoft to lead implementation \nAt this time, Microsoft has not decided whether to implement SuccessFactors Performance & Goals, for example, or the SAP continuous performance management application, he said. \nMicrosoft eliminated performance ratings for employees in 2013 and adopted a process called Connects, which emphasizes more timely feedback and meaningful discussions. \nMicrosoft will lead the implementation of the SAP HCM tools and is working with SAP to determine how the two vendors can best partner on implementation. Custom software scrapped \nMirchandani said SAP SuccessFactors will replace a combination of Microsoft's homegrown custom software and SaaS products from other providers across the HR domain. \nHe did not comment on whether Microsoft conducted a formal request-for-proposal process for the HCM tools. \"There were a number of considerations we made in selecting an HCM system, but, ultimately, we determined that SAP was the right partner for us,\" he said. \nWhile there were a number of reasons for Microsoft choosing the HCM tools, one is that SAP will use Microsoft Azure as a public cloud service for SAP SuccessFactors products. Microsoft in October unveiled an expansion of a longstanding partnership with SAP, saying SAP will make its cloud-based HCM products available on Microsoft Azure over the next five years. \n\"Of course, partnering with a company that integrates with our ecosystem and extends our cloud platform was a factor,\" Mirchandani said. SAP selects Azure \nThe selection of Azure was SAP's first move to supplement its own infrastructure and operate SAP SuccessFactors modules in a third-party public cloud. The selection recognizes the experience both companies have in supporting global enterprise clients, Microsoft said in a release. \nSAP will have significant additional capacity to run operational workloads of SAP SuccessFactors on Azure, beginning with demonstration environments, to support its continuing growth. \nMirchandani said Microsoft uses a number of custom, on-premises and SaaS offerings, including Microsoft Dynamics , for ERP. He said it is premature to comment on specific types of analysis, but he said integrating software like SAP SuccessFactors Employee Central with the internal ecosystem of Microsoft is one way to deliver greater business value. \n\"Enabling business insights is a key driver of digital transformation,\" he said. Others tap SAP HCM tools \nMore than 1,350 leading companies, including Microsoft and Ernst & Young, have selected SAP SuccessFactors Employee Central , a cloud-based core HR system that goes beyond automation to help businesses manage global workforces more efficiently, SAP said. \nIn addition to Microsoft, SAP also released a list of seven companies it said chose SuccessFactors HCM tools during the third quarter, such as Ernst & Young, Cintas Corp., SIX Group and CPFL Energia. \n\"HR today has become overly complex, especially for large global enterprises contending with hundreds of legal and regulatory jurisdictions,\" Mike Ettling, president of SAP SuccessFactors, said in a statement. \"Microsoft recognizes that transformation requires simplifying that environment, but just as importantly, as a global technology innovator, it also realizes the importance of providing its people with cloud-based solutions that are cool and easy to use. We're proud to partner in supporting Microsoft's continuing journey.\" Next Steps \nSAP tests new performance management system \nWorkday and rivals jockey over learning management \nHR Tech conference credits SAP, Oracle and Workday Dig Deeper on Human Resource Management Systems",

      "title": "Microsoft joining the Linux Foundation comes down to one word: Cloud",
      "text": "Subscribe to TechRepublic's Open Source Weekly newsletter A perfect union \nThe Linux Foundation has been doing amazing work serving as a bridge between the open source community and the rest of the world â not just enterprise business, but end users, home office, small business, mid-sized businesses, and governments. They've fostered important relationships that have helped to drive innovation in ways that may not have been possible otherwise. The Linux Foundation has hundreds of members and thousands of projects (some of which have become essential to enterprise business); it makes perfect sense that Microsoft would not only want to get in on the action, but would truly need to be a part of this union. Why? One word. Cloud. \nThat's right, the \"C\" word. \nIt is no great secret that Linux owns the cloud. Even from the Microsoft perspective, nearly 1 in 3 Azure virtual machines are Linux . Amazon Web Services , Apache CloudStack , Rackspace , Google Cloud Platform , and OpenStack are all powered by Linux. That is a piece of pie Microsoft wants to get the tines of their fork into. And why shouldn't they? Cloud is the thing and cloud is going nowhere but up. \nBut this isn't a one-way street. Ten years ago, had this same thing happened, everyone would be crying foul that Microsoft was only in this for themselves. However, I see a different shade of humble happening from Redmond these days. Microsoft understands one very important thing: As the cloud succeeds, so too does Microsoft. That sentiment is amended with the idea that the cloud cannot, in any way, succeed without open source. So it is in the best interest of Microsoft to ensure that open source does, in fact, succeed. \nWhat better way to see to this than to join the cause? The shift in strategy \nMicrosoft, the once very closed company, now: Has open-sourced parts of its own .NET platform Purchased, and subsequently open-sourced, Xamarin Partnered with Canonical to bring Ubuntu to Windows Worked with FreeBSD to release an image for Azure Partnered with Redhat and SUSE to bring Linux to Azure Has become a leading contributor on Github Announced the porting of SQL server to Linux Offers its own Linux certification \nThose feats cannot be ignored. The company now delivers and is not showing any signs of backing down from its promise to embrace and extend. This is the same company that was once run by a man who said Linux was a cancer. What we have witnessed, over the last few years, is nothing short of a tectonic shift in strategy on the part of Microsoft...one that can help to redefine the reach and power of open source for years to come. \nWe have come a long way, baby. A sizable win-win \nI cannot help but come back to the Linux Foundation. A lesser organization might have scoffed at Microsoft's advances, citing the years of FUD and damaging business practices. Fortunately, the Linux Foundation is bigger and better than that. They know bringing Microsoft into the fold is a huge win for them, for open source, and for the Redmond company itself. In fact, this is a sizable win-win for everyone, from end users to the biggest enterprise companies on the planet. \nThanks to the tireless work on the part of the Linux Foundation, open source has a juggernaut champion in its corner. That tectonic shift in the open source landscape is the beginning of a new world order for users, IT, and business.

      "text": "11/23/16 AT 4:11 PM Close \nIn an effort to lock in the European Unionâs approval for its $26 billion acquisition of LinkedIn, Microsoft has offered concessions directed at addressing competition concerns, Reuters reported Wednesday . \nThe concessions come after Microsoft announced in June that it signed a deal with LinkedIn to acquire the social professional platform for $26.2 billion in an all-cash deal. Microsoft sold $19.75 billion worth of bonds in August to finance the companyâs acquisition of the social platform. \nMicrosoft has now proposed concessions that would give access to rival networks similar to LinkedIn to Microsoftâs Outlook add-ins program, according to Reuters . The company will also give PC makers like HP and Dell the option to disable a Linkedin shortcut on its desktops. Related Stories Microsoft To Work With Elon Musk's OpenAI \nThe latter part of the concession is vital because of Microsoftâs clash with the EU competition authority over the past years and the guideline of using its products to block rivals, which has led to over 2.2 billion euros in fines. The concessions were brought up after feedback from rivals and consumers, sources told Reuters . \nThe agreement has been criticized by Microsoft rival Salesforce, who has asked European regulators to analyze the acquisition over antitrust and data privacy concerns. \nThe deal, which will be Microsoftâs largest acquisition in the companyâs history, is scheduled to be decided by Dec. 6. The deal has already been approved by the United States, Canada, Brazil and South Africa.

      "text": "ZDNet Japan Microsoft's data announcements, and what they mean Last week, Microsoft made a slew of announcements around its data and analytics offerings. Here's a rundown of the announcements, and an analysis of where they take Microsoft...and us. | Topic: Big Data Analytics \nLast week, Microsoft held its annual Connect() event in New York City, at an event space right at the mouth of the Holland Tunnel . Connect() tends to be focused on Visual Studio and the application development stack. But just as the Holland Tunnel joins a hip part of Manhattan to Jersey City, NJ, Connect() tied together the dev stack announcements with a bunch of announcements around the Microsoft Data Platform. \nMicrosoft had two huge announcements around SQL Server , arguably the Data Platform's component tied most closely to the developer world. But it also had announcements in the worlds of Big Data and analytics, specifically around Azure Data Lake ; R Server , HDInsight and Apache Kafka . \nAlso read: Microsoft's SQL Server Next: What's under the covers \nLet's get relational Let's start with the stuff pertaining to SQL Server, my Microsoft data first love. And if I loved it before, there's an even greater attraction now. The reasons: (1) the first version of the product to run on Linux is now in public preview as part of SQL Server \"vNext\" Community Technology Preview 1 (CTP 1) and (2) almost all the cool features of the product that were exclusive to the Enterprise Edition are now, with the release of SQL Server 2016 Service Pack 1 (SP1), available in every edition, including Standard , Web, Express and, with some footnotes, even in LocalDB , the application-embedded version of the product. \nAs someone who was involved early on in the private preview of SQL Server on Linux , I'm really glad that everyone can check it out now. While the product contains only the core relational engine, and not broader components like Reporting Services , Analysis Services or Integration Services , it is nonetheless a full fledged implementation of the product, and can run both \"on the metal,\" or in a Docker container. It's compatible with Suse , Ubuntu and Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) distributions. \nClose the Windows The most remarkable thing about SQL Server on Linux is how, once it's installed and working, it's not remarkable at all. In other words, while there are some Linux command line tools for the product which are clearly unique, interacting with the server from an application, BI tool or even a Windows-based tool like SQL Server Management Studio , is practically indistinguishable from working withe Windows version. It's almost a let down. \nBut the big difference is that developers who are targeting Linux servers can work with SQL Server now. And even developers using Macs can run it locally, without a LAN or Internet connection, by running it in a Docker container. This makes SQL Server more competitive with Oracle , to be sure. But it also makes it more competitive with open source relational databases like MySQL and PostgreSQL . \nYou get columnstore, and you get in-memory, and you get PolyBase! Of course, SQL Sever, even on Linux, isn't open source. But free versions do exist. Specifically, SQL Server Express and LocalDB are both free products. While they impose memory restrictions and other constraints, they work well where smaller databases are needed. The problem with these editions, and even their older, paid siblings like Web Edition and Standard Edition, is that Microsoft has kept most of its latest breakthrough SQL Server technologies out of them. \nCool features like columnstore indexes (which turns SQL Server into a column store database, enabling data warehouse, data mart and hybrid transactional-analytics implementations), memory-optimized tables (an in-memory transactional database technology) and PolyBase (which allows data in Hadoop and Azure Blob Storage be queried and joined as if it were located in SQL Server tables) have been off limits to non-Enterprise customers. This has inhibited their adoption among developers, Independent Software Vendors (ISVs -- who need to build their applications to work on Standard Edition for those customers who have it) and, by extension, the entire ecosystem. \nThat's a thing of the past now though, with Microsoft's announcing the general availability (GA) of SQL 2016 SP1 last week, virtually all features are available in all editions. Are there a few exceptions? Yes, but they're logical, based on how those editions are deployed. And Microsoft is also being very plain and transparent about the exceptions, summarizing them in the blog post on SP1 that I linked to in the third paragraph of this post. Microsoft hearts developers So we can start to see a path where developers on their Macs and Linux servers, used to working with free, open source tools, can also code against SQL Server and its most advanced features, without it costing them money, and without needing a machine (even a virtual one) running Windows. We're not there yet, but when SQL Server vNext on Linux, and the feature/licensing policies in SQL 2016 SP1 converge, we'll be damned close. \nAs a longtime Microsoft ecosystem professional, that gives me optimism. In an age when working with data has come to mean working with Linux and open source, this is a good turn of events. \n\"R with you is really a Kafkaesque experience...\" A similarly positive development occurred when Microsoft decided to release a Linux version of its cloud-based Hadoop distribution, HDInsight. It meant that companies in the Hadoop ecosystem, virtually all of whom (including my employer, Datameer) are Linux-focused, could partner and integrate with HDInsight. \nThis has helped HDInsight become a full-fledged Hadoop distribution, offering specialized cluster types not just for generic Hadoop work, but also for working with Apache HBase , Storm and Spark . And, just announced last week, a new cluster type for working with streaming data-oriented Apache Kafka, is in public preview. \nAnd when Microsoft acquired Revolution Analytics , which had become the principal commercial entity behind the open source R programming language for statistics and machine learning, that was good too. That company's Revolution R Enterprise (RRE) product, now sold as Microsoft R Server, was noteworthy in its ability to run on a server, or scale across entire clusters, running in a distributed, in-database mode, rather than running standalone on a local PC or Mac. \nSQL Server 2016 includes integration of the R Server technology in the form of SQL Server R Services . And while that's not yet part of SQL Server on Linux, another integration is Linux-based: R Server for HDInsight , which is integrated with Apache Spark, running on HDInsight. That product had been in preview for some time, and last week went into GA. \nThe GA version is tuned to work with Spark 2.0, can access data stored in Apache Hive or in Parquet format in HDFS directly, and can also access data in Microsoft's HDFS-compatible storage service called Azure Data Lake Store (ADLS) . \nData Lake, and more The latter, though based on Azure Blob Storage, provides even more robust fault tolerance and has no limit on file sizes. It too has gone GA, as has its companion query service, Azure Data Lake Analytics (ADLA) . The combination of ADLS and ADLA let you do Big Data work using U-SQL , a SQL-like query language that is extensible using Microsoft .NET and C#. Plus, ADLA jobs are run on-demand, rather than requiring a dedicated cluster, which brings a Platform as a Service sensibility to Hadoop, upon which ADLA runs. \nThat's about all there is, but it's quite a lot. From SQL Server relational technology to R, Hadoop, Spark, Kafka and various integrations between them, on both Windows and on Linux, Microsoft, if nothing else, has data and analytics passion, big time. When you add things like Cognitive Services and Power BI on top of all this, Microsoft has a sprawling, formidable wall of data technology that's integrated, open and cross-platform.

      "text": "Windows is famous for a few things. Itâs the most used computer operating system in the world and it includes some sweet games like Solitaire and Minesweeper. The included Windows games were a significant part of many peopleâs lives.\nThings are a bit different with Windows 10. Some games like Solitaire are now ad-supported, but theyâre prettier and come with many more features. And for some reason, Microsoft decided to bring Solitaire to Android.\nThe game is still ad-supported, but you can get rid of ads for $1.99 a month or $9.99 a year. Obviously paying for an ad-free subscription is crazy for a solitaire game, especially with so many other options, but the game starts free and doesnât show ads for the first month.

      "text": "European Union antitrust regulators are reportedly in favor of the Microsoft's proposed $26 billion buy out of social network LinkedIn after Microsoft made some market concessions competitors in the EU. Microsoft's $26 billion bid to acquire LinkedIn is taking a big step closer toward becoming a done deal. The European Union's (EU) antitrust authority is set to give the merger its approval when it decides on the matter on Dec. 6, Reuters reported today, citing information from unnamed insiders. EU regulators had originally set a Nov. 22 deadline, but extended its review after Microsoft proposed new concessions intended to ease concerns about how the deal could affect the competitive landscape. The Redmond, Wash. software giant has already gained the approval of regulators in the United States, as well as Brazil Canada and South Africa. To win the European Commission's blessing, Microsoft is proposing to allow rival professional social networks access to the company's Outlook add-ins program, enabling them to integrate with the email and calendar client, according a Nov. 22 report in the Wall Street Journal . Microsoft also said it would allow Dell and other computer makers to disable the LinkedIn shortcut on their desktop PCs.One of the deal's biggest opponents is Salesforce, which lost a bid to acquire the massive professional network. Burke Norton, chief legal officer of Salesforce, said the \"acquisition of LinkedIn threatens the future of innovation and competition,\" in a Sept. 29 statement to the press.\"By gaining ownership of LinkedInâs unique dataset of over 450 million professionals in more than 200 countries, Microsoft will be able to deny competitors access to that data, and in doing so obtain an unfair competitive advantage,\" continued Norton. \"We intend to work closely with regulators, lawmakers and other stakeholders to make the case that this merger is anticompetitive.\" Microsoft anticipates that bringing LinkedIn and its millions of members into the fold will have a big ripple effect across its business software ecosystem. \"This deal is the next step forward for Office 365 and Dynamics as they connect to the world's largest and most valuable professional network,\" wrote Satya Nadella, CEO of Microsoft, in a June 13 letter to employees. \"In essence, we can reinvent ways to make professionals more productive while at the same time reinventing selling, marketing and talent-management business processes.\" Meanwhile, recent moves by Roskomnadzor, Russia's communications oversight agency, have added a new wrinkle to the proceedings. Last week, Roskomnadzor blocked access to LinkedIn after a court ruled that the company had violated a law requiring that data pertaining to Russian citizens be stored on servers within the country's borders. Users who point their browsers to LinkedIn are greeted by messages from their internet service providers indicating that they are attempting to access a restricted site. LinkedIn and the bulk of its infrastructure resides in the U.S. The law was enacted by President Vladimir Putin in 2014, but it went into effect this year. The dust up is unlikely to have much of an effect on the multi-billion-dollar acquisition since LinkedIn only has 6 million users in Russia.",

      "text": "Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends \nOf all the time-wasting tools we have used to chip away a few of the dayâs hours, Solitaire is the granddaddy. Now that old friend is bursting forth into the 21st century, as Microsoft made it available on both iOS and Android for the first time. \nAlthough there are certainly many fans of Solitaire who have been playing it since its first digital inception, it is old enough now that there are drinkers in the world who have not. In fact, this year marks the 26th year since it was available on a Windows platform. Now itâs going mobile and that opens it up for a much wider audience. \nReimagined as an app, Microsoftâs Solitaire comes with a number of different modes. If you never understood how to play Spider Solitaire, now is your chance. It comes along with the classic Klondike mode, Freecell, Tripeaks and Pyramid too, all with their own unique rulesets. \nMore: Bye-bye productivity: Google lets you play Solitaire, Tic-Tac-Toe with just a search \nTo keep you coming back â other than to avoid whatever it is youâre supposed to be doing â Microsoft has also implemented daily challenges, so you can play specific puzzles which challenge you to figure out how to complete the puzzle of the layered cards. New ones will be released every day, with varied difficulty levels. \nIf you manage to complete some hard ones too, you can even brag about it to your friends, since there is Xbox Live Support too. That way you can earn achievements and prove that you really did win without cycling through the deck more than once. \nThis being a free mobile game, there are some advertisements that you are forced to deal with, but if you like playing enough, you can put down $2 and Microsoft will strip them out and give you double coin rewards by becoming a premium member. \nOf course, there are other mobile Solitaire games available and have been for some time â it is a timeless classic after all.",

      "text": "\nMicrosoft today announced some new pricing changes coming to Azure Media Servicesâ encoding features. In a new blog post today, the company announced a new pricing model for on-demand encoding of media with Azure Media Services which will go live next year â exactly on the 1st of January. In the new pricing model, the company will calculate usage based on the total duration of media files produced by the encoder when using the Standard and Premium encoder. And if you use the Media Reserved Units, youâll be charged based on the active usage of MRUs once the new pricing model goes live next year.\nBased on customer demand and feedback, starting January 1, 2017, we will implement a new pricing model for on-demand encoding of media with Azure Media Services. For the Standard Encoder and Premium Encoder, we will be calculating usage based on the total duration of the media files produced as output by the encoder. Further, for Media Reserved Units, we are lowering the rate, and making a change to calculate usage on a per-minute basis. In this post, Iâll be walking you through some examples to show how the new pricing models work.\nMicrosoft has detailed the upcoming changes with a couple of examples, which you can find here. Additionally, you can find the current pricing for Azure Media Services here. ",

Share Save \nIf you're one of the millions addicted to Microsoft's Solitaire on Windows, now you'll be able to get your card fix for free on iOS and Android . This marks the first time the Solitaire Collection has appeared outside of Windows, as The Verge reports . The mobile version will include FreeCell, Klondike, Spider, Tripeaks and Pyramid game modes, and it'll sport Xbox Live integration as well, so you you won't have to play it alone. (Yes, I realize that's the point of Solitaire for many.) \nWhile there are already countless versions of Solitaire available for iOS and Android, it makes sense for Microsoft to bring its popular version of the game over. I know some PC users who refuse to play anything but Microsoft's version of the game. While both versions are free, you can also shell out $2 a month for a \"Premium Edition,\" which will remove ads and double coin rewards.",

      "text": "  @05:40PM from the global-expansion dept. Microsoft is bringing Office 365 to 10 new markets. The company today announced that people in Bhutan, Cambodia, Greenland, Guadeloupe, Laos, Maldives, Martinique, Mozambique, Myanmar, and Vatican City can now also subscribe to its productivity suite . The company says it plans to launch Office 365 in nearly 100 more markets by next year. VentureBeat adds: It's worth underlining that Microsoft is using the word \"market\" and not \"country\" on purpose. There are 196 countries in the world today, but the company plans to launch Office 365 in \"a further 97 markets over the next year.\" That would bring the total to 247 markets -- the extra markets are differentiated by certain cultural and language differences that require more work on Microsoft's part, even if they are part of the same geographic country. Office is one of Microsoft's biggest cash cows. The company says over 1.2 billion people worldwide use its productivity suite.",

      "title": "Tesla grabs top Microsoft HoloLens designer",
      "text": "Reddit \nTesla has snagged one of Microsoftâs top designers, with former HoloLens industrial designer Andrew Kim leaving to join the electric car company. Kim will take up the role of Lead Designer at Tesla, his LinkedIn confirms. A graduate of the Art Center College of Design, the designer spent three and a half years at Microsoft. \nMost recently, his time there involved work on Microsoftâs HoloLens headset , the augmented reality wearable with which the company is pushing Windows Holographic. However, Kim was also heavily involved with the design of the Xbox One S before that. In a since-removed post about the console, he described the brief for the slimmer hardware as being âa more friendly and universal product that doesnât evoke traditional âgamingâ cuesâ in its aesthetic. \nKim came to the attention of Microsoft after taking it upon himself to come up with a new branding concept back in 2012. Replacing the traditional Windows âwindowâ logo with a more minimalistic parallelogram, which could be repurposed across four silos into which the companyâs computing, software, services, and other products would fall, the idea was to make Microsoft appear more futuristic and modern than rivals like Google and Apple. âPromise to deliver the future today,â Kim wrote at the time. âBe almost science fiction.â \nHowever, signs of his design talents started much further back than that. In 2007, we featured his Butterfly smartphone concept , a horizontal-sliding handset with dual OLED touchscreens that predated several companies attempting to commercialize the same thing. Three years later, Kim came up with â HTC 1 â, a conceptual handset that he suggested better matched hardware to the software work HTC had been doing at the time with Sense. \nExactly what Kim will be doing at Tesla is unclear, though the automaker has an ambitious roadmap ahead. While the design of the Model 3, set to be Teslaâs most affordable electric car, has been finalized ahead of production kicking off late next year, thereâs also the promise of an all-new Roadster on the horizon. Chief executive Elon Musk has also teased a Tesla pick-up truck based on the companyâs EV platform. \nAs for cabin design â an area Tesla has been criticized from some quarters for lagging its mainstream automaker rivals â that could be another area where the new Lead Designer might be employed. Teslaâs dashboard may be dominated by its touchscreen, but luxury car buyers expect the design, fit, and finish of the wood, metal, leather, and other materials surrounding the core controls to be just as pristine as the drivetrain. \nMeanwhile with Teslaâs acquisition of SolarCity also complete, thatâs a whole new segment Kimâs design talents could go in. Part of the Teslaâs big announcement recently regarding its solar roof was that the electricity-generating tiles looked just like â or better than â traditional roofing materials, particularly when seen from a pedestrianâs point of view. Inside the home, thereâs the design of future Powerwall batteries and other hardware to consider. \nOf course, Teslaâs interest in Kim could also be around the use of holographic or AR interfaces in automotive settings. A year ago, for instance, Volvo revealed that it would be using HoloLens in dealerships , taking advantage of the augmented reality wearableâs potential for giving car buyers a way to see under the skin of new vehicles. \nItâs something of an all-change period in car design right now. Earlier this month, Gael Buzyn â partly responsible for the striking Elmiraj concept in 2013, among other cars â quietly left Cadillac and joined Audi. The German automaker confirmed to SlashGear that Buzyn will be opening a new Audi design studio in Los Angeles, though declined to say what specific projects he might be working on. \nWeâve asked Tesla and Kim for comment on the move, though have yet to hear anything at time of publication. Weâll update if we hear more. A photo posted by Andrew Kim (@mnmllymnml) on Nov 23, 2016 at 12:42pm PST",

      "text": "\nMicrosoftâs Holoportation is a type of remote presence system designed for uses such as tele-commuting where users are able to project their presence into a new environment and be visible in augmented or virtual reality head mounted displays.\nThe technology uses a new type of 3D capture technology that allows high quality 3D models of people to be reconstructed, compressed, and transmitted anywhere in the world in real-time. When combined with mixed reality displays such as HoloLens, this technology allows users to see and interact with remote participants in 3D as if they are actually present in their physical space. Communicating and interacting with remote users becomes as natural as face to face communication.\nNow Microsoft has given themselves the task of making the technology work while mobile. The biggest challenge was cutting down on the amount of bandwidth transmitting the 3D model consumes and Microsoft writes that they managed to reduce the data needed by 97%, to only 30-50 Mb/sec.\nThis is still a bit too much for even LTE networks, but should allow future 5G networks to send your avatar anywhere in the world, no matter where you actually are.\nSee a video demo of the technology below:\nRead more about the work at Microsoft here .\n",

      "title": "Microsoftâs next phone could be the âultimate mobile device,â CEO says",
      "text": "Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends \nDespite trying again and again, Microsoft just canât seem to catch a break in the mobile world. But the company isnât done trying yet â according to CEO Satya Nadella, the next Microsoft phone could be one of the best smartphones weâve ever seen. \nIn an interview with the Australian Financial Review, Nadella said that Microsoft would âcontinue to be in the phone marketâ and that it would pave its own path to create the âultimate mobile device.â In other words, Microsoft doesnât even want to create the best phone by todayâs standards â it wants to build a device that could herald a new generation of smartphones. \nMore: Procrastinators prepare: Microsoftâs Solitaire is on iOS and Android devices \nOf course, just because Microsoft wants to have such an impact on the smartphone industry, that doesnât mean that it will â as weâve seen time and time again, Microsoftâs mobile attempts have generally always missed the mark in some way. \nStill, even though the company has largely failed in the smartphone market, Microsoft is in the best position that it has ever been in to make waves. The Surface computers are selling like hotcakes, and theyâve even inspired a range of knockoff devices. Not only that, but the new Surface Studio was released to quite a bit of fanfare, and itâs likely weâll see more successful hardware products in the computer world from Microsoft, too. If the company can somehow use that momentum to woo potential smartphone buyers, we could see a radical shift in the companyâs smartphone prospects. \nIt will certainly be interesting to see what the company comes up with. Critics have called for Microsoft to quit that smartphone market at least a few times â hopefully it can now prove those critics wrong.",

      "text": "Microsoft announces minimum specs for its Windows 10 VR headsets 23 News The company's VR HMDs come with requirements separate from those of established devices like Oculus Rift and HTC Vive. \nMicrosoft recently announced a new line of VR headsets to tap into Windows 10's VR and holographic capabilities. Earlier this week, the company revealed the PC specs you'll need to use them. 4GB of RAM A graphics card that supports DirectX 12 4 CPU cores boasting dual-core processors with hyperthreading \nThose are minimum specifications, but you can test your Windows 10 PC to see how close you come to meeting the bar for entry. The latest builds of Windows 10 include a tool called Windows Holographic First Run that scans your computer's hardware and lets you know what weak links need to be shored up, if any. \nNot much is known about Microsoft's VR headset, other than a few bullet points: the price starts at $299, and uses inside-out tracking to eschew extra hardware like external cameras. Its partners include Acer, HP, Lenovo, Asus, and Dell.",

      "text": "  @07:05PM from the classic-games dept. BrianFagioli quotes a report from BetaNews: Back in the the mid-1990's, everyone thought they needed a computer. After all, Windows 95 made using one particularly easy, and the internet was a very attractive thing. Unfortunately, once some people got their first-ever PC set up in their homes, they didn't really know what to do with it. In the end, it would turn out that some consumers spent thousands of dollars for a machine dedicated to one thing -- playing Solitaire! Yes, this fun Windows game is responsible for much wasted time, but not just at home -- at businesses too. The card game has historically been viewed as a negative for productivity. Fast forward to 2016 and fewer people are sitting in front of large desktop computers at home -- people are increasingly turning to tablets and smartphones for entertainment. Today, just in time for Thanksgiving, Microsoft Solitaire Collection comes to both Android and iOS . \"Microsoft Solitaire continues to be one of the most-played games of all time on Windows for more than 25 years. What's more, the version of Solitaire you know and love on Windows 10 and Windows 8 PC and mobile devices, Microsoft Solitaire Collection, has reached more than 119 million unique players in the last four years alone! And now, those on iPhone, iPad and Android devices can play the popular card game for free,\" says Paul Jensen , Studio Manager of Microsoft Casual Games. \"[...] with Xbox Live integration, you can sign in with your Xbox Live gamertag or Microsoft account to earn Xbox Live achievements and Gamerscore, compete with friends, and continue playing on any Windows 10, iPhone, iPad, or Android device while on the go since your progress and game data are saved in the cloud. If you're not an Xbox Live member, signing up for a free membership through the game is easy and totally worth it.\" It's worth noting that the \"freemium\" model features advertisements, but players can go \"Premium\" to remove those ads for $2 per month and receive other perks. You can download Microsoft Solitaire Collection from the App Store , Google Play , and Windows Store .",

      "text": "Microsoft brings Solitaire Collection to Android and iOS One of the most-played games of all time on Nov 23, 2016, 5:15 PM TechSpot \nAnyone who has been in the Windows ecosystem at some point in the past couple of decades likely has played a little Solitaire. The game was first included in Windows 3.0 back in 1990 as a way to familiarize users with many aspects of a graphical user interface, and has been bundled with nearly every version of Windows since â it was removed from Windows 8 but still available as a free download on the Windows Store. Microsoft brought it back for Windows 10 with a new âSolitaire Collectionâ that includes the classic game along with a few other variants. Now, that game bundle is available on Android and iOS . \nMicrosoftâs new Solitaire app for iOS and Android includes five games that you can play for free: Klondike, Spider, FreeCell, Pyramid, and Tripeaks game types. It also includes daily challenges for all five games that give players badges and rewards, and integrates with Xbox Live for achievements and more. \nWhile the game is free (ad-supported), a âPremium Editionâ of the Solitaire Collection is available for $1.99 and will get rid of in-game advertising, as well as doubling what coin rewards players receive for completing the daily challenges. If you download the collection before December 31, however, you'll enjoy a free one-month Premium Edition subscription for the game. \nWhile Microsoftâs Solitaire Collection will be available outside of Windows for the first time, a quick search on Appleâs App Store or Google Play reveals there are countless versions of the game already available. \nSure, itâs not groundbreaking stuff, but a milestone for what has been called âthe most-used Windows application in the world.â The most recent official numbers claim more than 119 million unique players on Windows 10 and Windows 8 PC and mobile devices in the last four years alone.

      "text": "App Tour - Dropbox App on Windows PCs and Mobile \n\nWhen Microsoft added a skill to Cortana last week to help you create and add items for to do lists it included very basic capabilities within Cortana herself however, if you want to get deeper into managing those lists then you will want to take advantage of the connection that is possible between Cortana and Wunderlist . \nSo when I posted the closer look at this new skill for Cortana earlier today, I thought an App Tour of Wunderslist would be the perfect match today. \nI was impressed as I tested adding items separately through Cortana and in Wunderlist - the new updates sync very quickly between each system - and Wunderslist definitely provides a more granular level of control for the lists you are working with. \nI only found one issue with Wunderlist and that was on each settings page - it appears the text is in white because it does not appear properly in any of those pages. See the last image in this gallery for an example. \nBeyond that one issue Wunderlist appears to be a good option for managing the To Do lists you create with Cortana.",

      "text": "RSS Feeds: ownCloud Now with Plug-in for Microsoft Outlook Secure email delivery without size limitation by automatically replacing attachments with links to files or folders in ownCloud. Colorado Springs, CO, November 23, 2016 --( PR.com )-- A new plug-in for Microsoft Outlook means that ownCloud users can now send their files easily and securely, even when sharing entire folders. Instead of attachments, the plug-in automatically adds links to the corresponding file in ownCloud, without the user having to change his normal workflow. The plug-in is fully integrated into Outlook, easy to use, and works with secure SSL encryption.Integrated split functionality also offers an added layer of security. It ensures that the link to the files and the password needed for downloading them are automatically sent separately. To facilitate proactive virus protection, all the data is checked for malicious software prior to being deposited on the sender's ownCloud server.In view of the current security problems caused by crypto viruses, many companies are already implementing protocol to prevent sending or receiving attachments by email. The ownCloud Outlook plug-in provides a simple and safe alternative to those limits, which in no way restricts users at a company, and still offers a maximum in security.The Outlook plug-in was originally developed by BW-Tech GmbH as an extension to its own ownCloud-based file sharing solution epiKshare. Following the necessary customizations, the plug-in is now available for all ownCloud users.Under this link , both subscription and community-based users of ownCloud can download the plug-in and try it out first for 30 days free of charge. English and German versions are available for Microsoft Outlook 2010, 2013, and 2016.Holger Dyroff, CEO of ownCloud GmbH in Nuremberg, views the plug-in as an important addition to the platform: \"Outlook is still the default solution for emails, calendars, and tasks at many companies. With the new plug-in, we are opening up a new dimension in secure email-based file sharing for the more than ten million ownCloud users. Many Microsoft Exchange operators have explicitly asked us for an Outlook plug-in. Thanks to our partnership with BW-Tech, we are now able to make one available for the market!\"Further advantages of the plug-in benefit ownCloud users who frequently transfer large amounts of data or send out mass mailings. Since only the links and access data for the downloads are sent, size limitations do not need to be observed on the source or destination mail servers when using the plug-in. At the same time, network traffic and the memory load on the mail and file server are reduced, thus significantly lowering costs.The option available for setting a time limit for accessing the files or folders is viewed by Frank BÃ¶ttcher, COO of BW-Tech GmbH, as an important additional advantage of the plug-in: \"The sender decides whether he wants to set a time limit for accessing the files or folders or not. The default access time has no limit set, but he can also enter an expiry date, after which the data can no longer be accessed.\"The ownCloud plug-in for Outlook costs $5.50 per user per year.
