      "text": "Apple Highlights Mac Apps Updated With Support for MacBook Pro Touch Bar   1:42 pm PST by Juli Clover As the new MacBook Pro models with Touch Bar begin arriving to customers , Apple has updated the Mac App Store with a featured section highlighting a selection of Mac apps that have been updated with Touch Bar support. Apple's list includes 14 apps that now work with the Touch Bar, like Day One, OmniGraffle 7, PocketCAS, Mail Designer Pro 3, Focus, and 1Password. Some of the apps, like Final Cut Pro and djay Pro, were previously shown off by Apple on stage when the MacBook Pro was announced. The scope of Touch Bar support varies by app, but in many apps, once-buried settings and frequently used shortcuts are now available in the Touch Bar, allowing users to speed up their workflows. In djay Pro, for example, the Touch Bar can be used for full music manipulation, while in 1Password, it offers options for quickly adding or finding passwords. One of the chief complaints in MacBook Pro reviews released today was the lack of support by third-party apps, but that should soon improve as developers finish updating their apps with Touch Bar compatibility. Many apps, including popular titles like Pixelmator, Photoshop, Affinity Design, and Microsoft Office, will be introducing Touch Bar support in the coming weeks.",

According to a release from the Spring Hill Police Department, the juvenile then accelerated away from the officer before losing control of the vehicle and striking two mailboxes. \nThe juvenile then drove the car through a garage on Dewey Drive before running from the officer. The car was later confirmed stolen, according to the release. \nJust before 3 a.m., police received another call of an unidentified person asleep on a couch at another home on Dewey Drive. Police determined it was the juvenile who ran from police earlier and took the juvenile into custody. \nOfficers later found a laundry basket full of a large amount of Apple products. According to the release, the juvenile told officers he used a sledgehammer to break through the front doors at the Target Supercenter at 1033 Crossings Blvd. The juvenile went into the electronics department and stole $9,820 worth of Apple products, according to the release. \nThe juvenile was taken into custody and charged with three counts of vandalism, runaway, leaving the scene of an accident, felony evading, criminal trespass, theft over $500, theft over $1,000, theft over $10,000 and burglary. \nReach Ray Howze at 615-664-2251 and on Twitter @rayhowze1 .

      "text": "By Tiernan Ray J.P. Morgan ’s Rod Hall today shuffles the deck of his networking equipment names, with Ciena ( CIEN ) still his top pick, but Cisco Systems ( CSCO ) and Apple ( AAPL ) both dropping some points in his ranking.\nHall puts last week’s upset victory by Donald Trump in the U.S. presidential election front and center, noting “the sector underperformed last month with a 0.6% gain vs. the S&P500 up 1.3%.”\n“We note that post election moves have not been helpful,” writes Hall, “with large tech names generally selling off as overall growth optimism increases.”\nCisco, whose shares Hall rates Neutral, plummet in his rankings from 8th place back in October to 16th place, following “multiple negative enterprise data points in Q3 reporting.\nHe sums up that “as enterprise spending has weakened in late 2016 we see Cisco at some short term risk,” and “we also believe that increasing expectations for inflation and economic growth would likely be bad news for Cisco.”\nAlthough he rates Apple shares Overweight, it does to 15th place from October’s 10th place ranking, as “Apple has shown itself to be exposed to weakening macro conditions which the company downplayed late in 2015.”\n“The December numbers benefit from an extra week of sales Q/Q and Y/Y but we see potential for deteriorating high end smartphone demand in early 2017.”\nFor Ciena, which he also rates Overweight, it holds onto its 1st-place status, “due to an expected multi- year ramp in 100G optical spending which should continue to accelerate in 2017.” The shares are “materially undervalued,” he believes.",

      "text": "Apple stock extends losses after China warning about Trump Reuters Photo: \nBy Noel Randewich \nSAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Apple's <AAPL.O> stock extended recent losses on Monday after a warning that iPhone sales could suffer if President-elect Donald Trump follows through on campaign threats to impose new tariffs on China. \nApple is among several major technology stocks, including Amazon.com <AMZN.O>, Facebook <FB.O> and Alphabet <GOOGL.O>, selling off since Tuesday's election as investors shift funds into financial and public works companies seen benefiting from deregulation and infrastructure spending under President-elect Trump. \nIn a continuation of that trend, the Cupertino, California company's stock fell 2.5 percent on Monday, bringing its loss since Tuesday's election to almost 5 percent, compared to the S&P 500's <.SPX> 1.16 percent advance. \nAdding to concern for Apple investors, an op-ed published in the China government-backed Global Times on Sunday warned of \"tit-for-tat\" retaliation should Trump follow through on a campaign pledge to impose 45-percent tariffs on all imports from China. \n\"A batch of Boeing <BA.N> orders will be replaced by Airbus. US auto and iPhone sales in China will suffer a setback, and US soybean and maize imports will be halted,\" the op-ed said. \nChina has already become a disappointment for Apple, failing to deliver rapid growth that the company hoped would make up for slower iPhone sales in the United States and other mature markets. \nRevenue from China slumped 30 percent in Apple's September quarter, worse than the Americas' 7 percent decline. \nApple's China sales could be hurt by potential trade conflicts as well as the country's weakening currency, said Rosenblatt Securities analyst Jun Zhang by email. He said he believes China iPhone sales fell in October, even after fixing supply issues affecting the iPhone 7 Plus. \nSynovus Trust Company Senior Portfolio Manager Daniel Morgan, who owns $33 million worth of Apple shares, warned not to read too much into Trump's campaign trail threats against China, at least in the near term. \n\"You just don't just jump in and start rewriting trade agreements,\" Morgan said. \n(Reporting by Noel Randewich; Editing by Tom Brown)",

Apple had limited this to buying goods and services — until now. \nThe American Red Cross, United Way and 18 other nonprofits will accept Apple Pay starting Monday.

      "text": "By Noel Randewich\nSAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Apple's (AAPL.O) stock extended recent losses on Monday after a warning that iPhone sales could suffer if President-elect Donald Trump follows through on campaign threats to impose new tariffs on China.\nApple is among several major technology stocks, including Amazon.com (AMZN.O), Facebook (FB.O) and Alphabet (GOOGL.O), selling off since Tuesday's election as investors shift funds into financial and public works companies seen benefiting from deregulation and infrastructure spending under President-elect Trump.\nIn a continuation of that trend, the Cupertino, California company's stock fell 2.5 percent on Monday, bringing its loss since Tuesday's election to almost 5 percent, compared to the S&P 500's (.SPX) 1.16 percent advance.\nAdding to concern for Apple investors, an op-ed published in the China government-backed Global Times on Sunday warned of \"tit-for-tat\" retaliation should Trump follow through on a campaign pledge to impose 45-percent tariffs on all imports from China. \n\"A batch of Boeing (BA.N) orders will be replaced by Airbus. US auto and iPhone sales in China will suffer a setback, and US soybean and maize imports will be halted,\" the op-ed said. \nChina has already become a disappointment for Apple, failing to deliver rapid growth that the company hoped would make up for slower iPhone sales in the United States and other mature markets.\nRevenue from China slumped 30 percent in Apple's September quarter, worse than the Americas' 7 percent decline.\nApple's China sales could be hurt by potential trade conflicts as well as the country's weakening currency, said Rosenblatt Securities analyst Jun Zhang by email. He said he believes China iPhone sales fell in October, even after fixing supply issues affecting the iPhone 7 Plus.\nSynovus Trust Company Senior Portfolio Manager Daniel Morgan, who owns $33 million worth of Apple shares, warned not to read too much into Trump's campaign trail threats against China, at least in the near term.\n\"You just don't just jump in and start rewriting trade agreements,\" Morgan said.\n\n\n(Reporting by Noel Randewich; Editing by Tom Brown)",

      "text": "Apple Pay expands to charities, Samsung Pay to offer rewards Updated 0 \nNEW YORK (AP) — Apple is making it easier for people to give to charities by expanding its Apple Pay payments service to nonprofits. \nApple Pay is mostly known for enabling purchases at retail stores with the tap of an iPhone, although the service can also be used for online transactions on apps and websites. Apple had limited this to buying goods and services — until now. \nThe American Red Cross, United Way and 18 other nonprofits will accept Apple Pay starting Monday. Others are coming soon. \nApple Pay can speed transactions because people don't have to re-enter card and contact information, though people need to enable the service first. Apple says that websites and apps accepting Apple Pay report seeing twice as many people complete transactions, compared with other payment methods. What's going on in the markets today? \nSeparately, Samsung says a payment service on its phones, Samsung Pay, will start offering points for each transaction, regardless of the amount spent. They will be redeemable for gift cards and Samsung products. \nAmericans are just starting to warm up to mobile payment services such as Apple Pay and Samsung Pay. One of the chief hurdles is the fact that for in-store transactions, it's not that difficult to pull out a plastic card to pay. And many merchants still do not accept such mobile payments. Although usage is growing, mobile payments are still a small portion of overall sales. Tags",

      "text": "The MacBook Pro’s Touchy Feely Thing I check out Apple’s faster, thinner, louder notebook with the Multi-Touch strip on the keyboard. And Phil Schiller helps me decode it. I didn’t ask Apple for a Touch Bar. No one did. Yet here it is, perched on top of the keyboard of the new MacBook Pro, like a strand of Technicolor ribbon. Clearly, Apple ascribes to the school of innovation that says great products come only when you produce stuff that your users never imagined. But why a Touch Bar, and is it really valuable?\nFor months now, I have been staring at a tiny whirling beach ball on my screen, thinking, “When is Apple coming out with the next generation notebook— thinner, lighter, more powerful? — so I can replace this?” Hundreds of thousands of others share my plight: The current generation of the MacBook Pro, known as the Retina model, appeared in 2012.\nApple hopes to answer our prayers with this generation. It is thinner than the MacBook Air, weighs virtually the same (for the 13\" models, 3.02 pounds compared to the Air’s 2.96), and is much faster. More powerful speakers than the previous Pro make it a svelte boombox. The screen pops with an intense gamut of color.\nIt’s also more expensive than the Retina Pros: $1,500 for a stripped down version without the Touch Bar, $1,700 for the flagship 13\" screen Touch Bar model, and configurations for the 15\" version that rise well north of $2,500. For many current users, the priciness might flip that now to later . And with its all-in approach to the newfangled, speedier Thunderbolt 3 (USB-C) connectors — which won’t work with current peripherals unless you purchase the proper “dongles” — the new MacBook Pro embraces the future so lustily that you might experience coitus interruptus with the present.\nBut really, this otherwise evolutionary computer will be defined by the Touch Bar. We all knew that the new version of the MacBook Pro was going to be more powerful and easier to carry around. It’s no surprise that it looks great. Space grey is definitely the new black, or at least the new aluminum. (One pleasant bonus — the Apple logo on the lid no longer lights up, sparing you from serving as a glowing advertisement for the Cupertino computer maker.) What we did not know, at least until the inevitable leaks began spouting, was that there would be an interactive display strip where function keys once lived. Now we have to figure out if we like it.\nI’ve been bellying up to the Touch Bar for over a week now, but before I render a verdict, I’d like to situate this feature in the Apple universe. As I wrote a few days after launch, the coincidental introduction of the new MacBook Pro a day after the Microsoft unveiled its Surface Studio  — a behemoth with a 28-inch touch screen — led a lot of commentators to charge that the historically unimaginative plodders from Redmond had out-innovated the flashy cool kids in Cupertino. How can Apple’s quarter-inch strip of OLED on a keyboard compare to a Microsoft’s whole frigging table ’ s- worth of touch goodness?\nCertainly some Apple fans are restless. Based on the cost of the MacBook Pro and the need to buy a basket of deplorable dongles to mediate between devices and Thunderbolt 3, they are taking to social media to express doubts and—in some cases—apostasy.\nFortunately, I do not have to make guesses at what’s going on in Apple’s mind. Perhaps motivated by the grumbling in rainbow-fruit land, Apple’s SVP of worldwide marketing Phil Schiller came to the phone last week to decode the company’s motivations, and stridently counter the cavils of the doubters.\nTo understand the Touch Bar, it’s helpful to revisit a conversation I had with Schiller a year ago, upon the introduction of a new iteration of the iMac. Replying to my query as to why Apple did not, as some expected, give the iMac a touch screen, Schiller laid out to me what would be known as the Grand Unified Theory of Apple Hardware. The philosophy is best understood, he told me, by visualizing the various devices Apple sells on a horizontal plane, like the famous illustration of Darwinian human evolution. Only in this case, the series doesn’t represent a progression, but rather a taxonomy of ideal forms, a Cupertino World Order in which the interface for each is perfectly suited for the function and form of each device.\n“Watch, iPhone, iPad, Macbook, iMac,” he said. “They really are all computers. Each one is offering customers something unique and each one is made with a simple form that perhaps is eternal. People in the industry may question them — we don’t, for some very simple reasons.”\nSeen in that context, making the Macintosh screen—even just on the laptop—touch-centric is a crime against nature, as it violates the functionality intrinsic to the form of a notebook or desktop computer, at least as Apple sees it. Indeed, last week, Schiller was even more emphatic when that subject came up.\n“We think of the whole platform,” he says. “If we were to do Multi-Touch on the screen of the notebook, that wouldn’t be enough — then the desktop wouldn’t work that way.” And touch on the desktop, he says, would be a disaster. “Can you imagine a 27-inch iMac where you have to reach over the air to try to touch and do things? That becomes absurd.” He also explains that such a move would mean totally redesigning the menu bar for fingers, in a way that would ruin the experience for those using pointer devices like the touch or mouse. “You can’t optimize for both,” he says. “It’s the lowest common denominator thinking.”\nApple came to this conclusion by testing if touch screens made sense on the Mac. “Our instincts were that it didn't, but, what the heck, we could be wrong—so our teams worked on that for a number of times over the years,” says Schiller. “We’ve absolutely come away with the belief that it isn't the right thing to do. Our instincts were correct.”\nOn the other hand, he notes, Multi-Touch has already found it way onto the Mac platform, as gestures used on the iPhone — pinch, twirl, swipe — have migrated to the touch pad. The Touch Bar is an extension of that movement of making the Macintosh “a part-time touch experience.”\nA big fat target for that transformation was the function key row, which was just sitting there largely unused. (Though the appearance of the Touch Bar has revealed a suddenly vocal population, mainly of programmers, passionately devoted to the escape key.). For a number of years, Schiller says, engineers at Apple have been figuring out how to colonize that function row territory with touch technology. It was a way to make Mac a touch experience without toppling the Grand Unified Theory. “This notebook design has been with us for 25 years and that fills a need for many people,” he says. “Having an interactive place where your hands are down on the keyboard is celebrating what makes a notebook a great notebook.”\nWhen I suggested that this might be only the latest in a number of mobile innovations moving to the Mac, in an overall annexation of the Macintosh platform, Schiller pushed back, hard. “Its implementation is pure Mac,” he said. “The thought and vision from the very beginning was not at all, ‘How do we put iOS in the Mac?’ It was entirely, ‘How to you use the [iOS] technology to make a better Mac experience?’”\nWhile I had Schiller, I asked him what Apple made of the furor over the MacBook Pro’s switch to the new Thunderbolt USB-C connectors, without including even one retro port so that people could use their current devices without using a dongle. Schiller sees this as a non-issue. Apple is building this device for the future, he says, and in five years the nascent USB-C technology will be in its prime.\nFurthermore, with its speed and versatility (a big advantage is that you can use any of these ports for video, charging, and pretty much anything you’d ever do by connecting with a computer), USB-C is right for now. As far as dongles, he claims that most people won’t need them. For the small number of people that do, ones are available. (Apple, obviously sensitive to the issue, recently cut dongle prices on its store.) “We’re absolutely more sure than ever that we’ve done the right thing.”\nAnd how about the charge that Apple has lost its innovative edge?\nSchiller disputes that, too. “We work hard on these things, and they are the best,” he says. “We care about the feedback but we know that the fundamental difference on where their opinions are coming is between those who had a chance to use it and those who haven’t. There are people who want us to innovate faster and when we do there’s people who say, ‘Whoa, whoa, you’re going too fast.’ That’s just a balance in the world.”\nIn the case of the MacBook Pro specifically, Schiller thinks that pushback is natural, particularly before people have had a chance to try it.\n“There’s always something for a critic to beat up on anybody’s notebook, because you have to make choices,” he says. “I know our team made very smart choices and this is the best notebook that can be made with the greatest technology.”\nSo what is it like to use the Touch Bar? First of all, it looks great: a strip of arcade-bright fettuccine. The high resolution, especially when it displays color, is a delightful contrast to the doggedly steampunk preserve of a physical keyboard.\nFrom the get-go, the Touch Bar begins earning its keep by the inclusion of a fingerprint sensor on its right edge that allows Touch ID. (It’s also the power button.) Unlike the case with the iPhone sensor, where you essentially have to train multiple fingers (because you grip a phone in a lot of different angles), a laptop only needs a single finger — obviously, the index finger — to unlock the screen or make an Apple Pay purchase. For us sloppy typists who commonly have to peck out our passwords multiple times in a row, dozens of times a day, this alone might be worth the cost of the Touch Bar.\nThe Touch Bar can be an alternative to remembering a keyboard shortcut to open an app, or a much easier way of performing intuitive tasks such as scrolling through photos or fast-forwarding a QuickTime video. It’s at its best when choosing emojis, which does away with the awkward task of pulling up the choices on screen by letting you invoke a chorus line of cartoony icons. If you don’t see the one you like, you call in the next troupe by poking the proper category.\nPerhaps the most powerful function of the keyboard is a feature originally introduced on the iPhone to make up for the difficulty of typing on its tiny screen: one-touch suggestions of the word Apple guesses you’d like to type next.\nAt first I had difficulty using that shortcut: Slipping a finger toward what used to be a function key row to choose a word screwed up my orientation to the standard part of the keyboard, and interrupted my typing flow. Ultimately, I got a little better at it. But then, I found that if I got into a mode of looking at the next word Apple suggested, I wound up making choices determined by the company’s machine learning algorithms as opposed to the supposedly clever original language I am paid to craft. (For instance, in the above paragraph, the word “powerful” popped up when I was mentally searching for the right adjective. Done!)\nFor the immediate future, there will be only a limited number of applications that fully use the Touch Bar (Apple’s own, of course, and some key ones including Microsoft Office and Photoshop). Developers are free to use Apple’s API’s to make their products Touch Bar friendly (if they adhere to Apple’s rules the text suggestions should work already), but how many do that will depend on the size of the MacBook Pro’s user base. Another key variable is whether web services will be able make use of the bar. Schiller says only, “There is opportunity for that.” As for now, the Touch Bar pushes you to use Apple’s own browser, Safari. Writing this review now on the Medium online platform, I get word suggestions when using Safari, but not on Chrome.\nOverall, the experience made me wonder whether the Touch Bar is a step toward Apple’s rejection of a physical keyboard. After all, the default Touch Bar configuration has an icon to invoke Siri, and you can add a button to instantly trigger voice dictation. Will we ever see a notebook where Apple shows the “courage” (to use Schiller’s term when the iPhone 7 ditched the headphone jack) get rid of those physical keys, which are, after all, are greasy relics of the industrial age?\n“It’s certainly not on the horizon right now,” Schiller says. “We do want to add those experiences that you are talking about — talking to talk to Siri, voice dictation, suggestions. Although for us right now, there’s no reason to make that trade off. Instead, we focused on not removing the keyboard but making a better keyboard.” Got that?\nThere are other things to say about the MacBook Pro —for instance, it’s nice that the speakers are more muscular. And, despite Schiller’s claim that only a minority of users should care, it will be a constant annoyance that those high-speed USB-C ports need those unlovely dongles to connect with your current printers, flash drives, SD-cards, Ethernet, displays, and yes, even the iPhone introduced last month .\nBut you know what? It doesn’t really make much of a difference. Reports are that people are snapping it up , with online sales the highest ever for a notebook.\nI know I will, even if it’s a couple hundred dollars more than my ideal price. And I will indeed choose a Macbook Pro with the Touch Bar, if only for the fingerprint sensor. I am still not totally convinced that this innovation — and yes, I will call it that — is really transformative, and not just a cool way to save a few seconds here and there. If developers don’t take the trouble to integrate it with their applications, or if Apple doesn’t figure out how to get it to work with web services, there’s always the danger that Touch Bar will be remembered not as a breakthrough but as a relic, a medium-difficult item in a future game of Tech Jeopardy.\nBut, hell, I’m sick of watching the spinning ball on my six-year-old MacBook Air. I’ve already bought my first dongle.",

      "text": "NEW YORK — Apple is making it easier for people to give to charities by expanding its Apple Pay payments service to nonprofits.\nApple Pay is mostly known for enabling purchases at retail stores with the tap of an iPhone, although the service can also be used for online transactions on apps and websites. Apple had limited this to buying goods and services — until now.\nThe American Red Cross, United Way and 18 other nonprofits will accept Apple Pay starting Monday. Others are coming soon.\nApple Pay can speed transactions because people don’t have to re-enter card and contact information, though people need to enable the service first. Apple says that websites and apps accepting Apple Pay report seeing twice as many people complete transactions, compared with other payment methods.\nSeparately, Samsung says a payment service on its phones, Samsung Pay, will start offering points for each transaction, regardless of the amount spent. They will be redeemable for gift cards and Samsung products.\nAmericans are just starting to warm up to mobile payment services such as Apple Pay and Samsung Pay. One of the chief hurdles is the fact that for in-store transactions, it’s not that difficult to pull out a plastic card to pay. And many merchants still do not accept such mobile payments. Although usage is growing, mobile payments are still a small portion of overall sales.\n# apple pay apple inc.",

      "text": "last » \nLaptop Rivalry \nFor years, the battle for the mobility space has been all about Apple versus Samsung. But it’s not just about smartphones and tablets, as demonstrated by Samsung’s Notebook 9. In terms of look and feel, the Notebook 9 may be the most similar laptop out there to the MacBook Pro -- especially in terms of the touchpad, keyboard and aluminum body. And until the release of the new MacBook Pro, the Notebook 9 had actually been well ahead of the MacBook Pro line on portability. That's changed with the MacBook Pro 2016. To give a sense of how the competing laptops line up overall, the CRN Test Center compares the Notebook 9 and MacBook Pro 2016 on price and specs. Pages",

If users make 30 or more transactions a month then they’ll earn four-times the points. \nIf the card you’re using within the app has its own rewards initiative, this program will not interfere with those points. In effect, users will be doubling down. \nRelated: Apple Pay vs Samsung Pay \nMeanwhile, Apple is making it easier for people to make charitable donations by opening up Apple Pay to non-profit organisations. \n“ Apple Pay is making it easier and more secure to donate to your favorite nonprofit organizations with just a touch ,” the company said in an Apple Newsroom post on Monday. \n“Apple Pay support for charitable donations kicks off today with nonprofits ranging from global organizations such as UNICEF to startups like charity: water, and more nonprofits will offer Apple Pay over the coming months so their supporters can make easy, secure and private payments.” \nAmong the charities already on board are Unicef, the American Red Cross, Doctors Without Borders and the World Wildlife Fund. \nWatch The Refresh: The best tech gossip and reviews every week 0 shares",

      "title": "Surface Book vs. MacBook Pro 2016: Can The Updated Microsoft Laptop Give The New MacBook A Run For Its Money?",
      "text": "Microsoft launched the Surface Book i7 a day before Apple unveiled the MacBook Pro 2016 lineup. With specs for both laptops closely similar to one another, which laptop is the better option? ( Andrew Burton | Getty Images ) Advertisement \nThere is no denying Microsoft and Apple have been rivals for at least the past three decades. This year is no exception: both companies revealed their new flagship laptops just a few hours apart, with the hope of tempting customers away from the other. \nMicrosoft unveiled the Surface Book i7, a revamped version from last year's flexible laptop with a funny hinge , on Oct. 26. Representing Apple, on the other hand, is the latest MacBook Pro variant complete with a new Touch Bar display right above the keyboard. \nBut which is the better option? Design \nMicrosoft has not changed the physical appearance of the Surface Book i7 model. It still has the matte gray color and dynamic hinge, a spring-like system that folds into itself, leaving a noticeable gap between screen and keyboard when closing the laptop, in which the tech giant takes pride. \nMore importantly, users can completely detach the screen from the keyboard, leaving a 13.5-inch tablet to use, something that the MacBook Pro 2016 does not offer. \nMeanwhile, Apple slimmed and lightened the MacBook Pro 2016 and added a new Touch Bar feature above the keyboard that changes the controls it shows according to the application currently in use. \nFor example, bookmarks and favorites appear when opening the Safari browser, while editing tools show up when viewing photos. It can also display emoji suggestions or predicted words when typing out sentences. \nIn terms of size, the MacBook Pro is available in 13-inch or 15-inch variants whereas the Surface Book i7 only has the 13.3-inch model. As for the resolution, the former can render up to 2,880 x 1,800 pixels while the latter has 3,000 x 2,000 pixels. Specs and Battery Life \nBoth laptops use Intel's latest 6th generation i7 and i5 chipsets. Both devices use SSD drives and dedicated graphics cards for gaming and video rendering: NVIDIA GTX 965M for Microsoft and Radeon Pro 455 for Apple. In fact, both devices are so alike that it is difficult to exactly pinpoint which performs better straight out. \nOne thing the Surface Book i7 has an advantage over the MacBook Pro is battery life: the former reportedly lasts up to 16 hours while the latter only promises 10 hours of laptop usage . Price \nTo put it mildly, pricing for both laptops is quite expensive. The entry level Apple MacBook Pro 13-inch with Touch Bar display costs $1,799 while the 15-inch variant costs $2,399. A 13-inch MacBook Pro sans the feature retails for $1,499. \nMicrosoft's Surface Book i7 starts at $1,899 for the 8 GB RAM and 256 GB storage option, while the higher 16 GB RAM and 1 TB variant retails for a whopping $2,999 thanks to a $200 discount. Conclusion \nMicrosoft clearly edges out Apple in terms of pricing. As regards specs too, it would appear that the Surface Book i7 is slightly better with its superior battery life and screen resolution than the MacBook Pro 2016. \nOf course, there are other things to consider such as software, operating system, and compatibility with other devices. Apple's MacBook Pro would work better with an iPhone or iPad. For those who want more customizability and compatibility options, Microsoft's Surface Book i7 could be a better choice.  ",

      "text": "Apple surprises its customers with every iPhone it releases, but next year will be very special, as it’s the iPhone’s tenth anniversary. So Apple could release its biggest iPhone to date next year, reports Forbes . Photo by GONZALO BAEZA Will Apple remove the Home button? \nApple’s next iPhone might be the iPhone 7s, iPhone 8 or Tenth Anniversary iPhone, but at least one of the models will come with a really big organic light-emitting diode (OLED) display, MacRumors reported recently. The report cited Barclays analysts, who cited sources within Apple’s supply chain during their Asian trip. \nHow different and big the next device will be is the question for now. It is expected that the device will come with a bezel-less display design with a screen size of 5.8 inches — bigger than the 5.5-inch 7 Plus. However, a reader pointed out that the bezel-less design of the next iPhone would not allow the actual dimensions of the 5.8-inch iPhone to be much bigger than the 5.5-inch iPhone 7 Plus, notes Forbes. \nTo make bezel-free iPhones, Apple would need to remove the iconic Home button on the next iPhone, according to the widespread rumors. Barclays, however, differs and does not believe that the Home button will be moved to an in-screen solution. It does expect the company to extend the screen, both vertically and horizontally, but exactly how it will do it remains to be seen. \n“[The] iPhone 8 design didn’t sound 100% locked down but we believe the move is to a bezel-less design with screen sizes getting larger and curved edges in the original envelope,” Barclays noted. Only the bigger iPhone 8 to sport OLED display? \nThough MacRumors notes that the display sizes cannot be said with surety for now, Barclays believes that Apple will likely continue its trend of introducing phones with larger screen sizes and curved edges which might resemble the Galaxy S7 Edge. \nAlso, according to Japanese publication Nikkei, the large iPhone 8 to be introduced next year will be a premium model and will be sold alongside the more traditional 4.7-inch and 5-inch iPhones with more conventional LCD screens. \nBarclays reported that only the 5.8-inch iPhone will come with a OLED display which could be brighter, sharper and more energy efficient compared to the LCD technology used currently. It is said that Samsung and LG will be the primary OLED suppliers for Apple, and Foxconn-owned Sharp too will join the supplier list by 2018.",

      "text": "Apple Pay expands to charities, Samsung Pay to offer rewards Updated 0 \nNEW YORK (AP) — Apple is making it easier for people to give to charities by expanding its Apple Pay payments service to nonprofits. \nApple Pay is mostly known for enabling purchases at retail stores with the tap of an iPhone, although the service can also be used for online transactions on apps and websites. Apple had limited this to buying goods and services — until now. \nThe American Red Cross, United Way and 18 other nonprofits will accept Apple Pay starting Monday. Others are coming soon. \nApple Pay can speed transactions because people don't have to re-enter card and contact information, though people need to enable the service first. Apple says that websites and apps accepting Apple Pay report seeing twice as many people complete transactions, compared with other payment methods. \nSeparately, Samsung says a payment service on its phones, Samsung Pay, will start offering points for each transaction, regardless of the amount spent. They will be redeemable for gift cards and Samsung products. \nAmericans are just starting to warm up to mobile payment services such as Apple Pay and Samsung Pay. One of the chief hurdles is the fact that for in-store transactions, it's not that difficult to pull out a plastic card to pay. And many merchants still do not accept such mobile payments. Although usage is growing, mobile payments are still a small portion of overall sales. Tags",

There are new options for the TV app in Settings. The SOS feature that was introduced in iOS 10.2 public beta 2 has been restricted to India, according to MacRumors . Also, now you can send messages “with love” — a big heart will show up in the background — in the Messages app, according to 9to5Mac .\nThe iOS 10.2 update will eventually become available to everyone, just as iOS 10.1 did last month. But if you want to check out this update before most other people see it, you can install it by going to Settings > General > Software Update if you’re a member of Apple’s Beta Software Program. If you’re not, you can sign up now, free of charge, by going here .\nApple released iOS 10 for everyone in September. It includes revamped Apple Maps, Apple Music, Messages, and Photos apps, along with a new Home app, QuickType predictions featuring the intelligence of the Siri virtual assistant, and the ability for third-party apps to integrate with Siri.\nAccording to Apple, which cites App Store data , 60 percent of iOS devices were running iOS 10 as of October 25. Meanwhile, just 0.3 percent of Android devices were running Android Nougat as of November 7, Google said .\nGet more stories like this on Twitter & Facebook ",

      "text": "1 hour ago \nAfter about four years, Apple has finally overhauled its flagship laptop, the MacBook Pro. \nThe new machines are thinner, lighter, and potentially faster than their predecessors. They also come with a fancy new tiny touchscreen sitting atop the keyboard, called a Touch Bar, which replaces the traditional function keys on a keyboard. Reviews for the new machines hit the internet today, and for the first time in years, reviewers aren’t overwhelmingly thrilled by them. Some miss all the ports the older machines had; others bemoan their battery life; and others their price. \nQuartz rounded up the opinions of some of the major reviewers below, hopefully helping you figure out whether it’s time to get a new laptop. The Touch Bar is gimmicky \nApple’s new tiny second screen works well, but isn’t indispensable, at least yet, according to Wired’s David Pierce: “Technically, the Touch Bar works brilliantly. It’s fast and smooth and responsive. The textured glass feels great, and looks fantastic. Using my fingerprint on the Touch ID reader to log in and to pay for stuff is the best. But the implementation feels unfinished.” The screen will change what digital buttons appear based on what programs you’re using at any given moment. “Right now, I’m subject to Apple’s best guess about what I want,” Pierce added. “Apple often guesses wrong.” The Touch Bar, being used to scroll through photos. (Apple) \nEngadget’s Dana Wollman agreed : “It’s inconvenient enough that I eventually started using my mouse to do things like pause Spotify or raise the volume on a track. Apple made me change my way of doing things, and not necessarily for the better. That pisses me off.” \nConversely, Macworld’s Susie Ochs found the Touch Bar to be useful: “The Touch Bar is incredibly handy not only because its controls change to match the app you’re using, but also because it’s so customizable.” \n(It’s worth noting that the Touch Bar also adds $300 to the price of Apple’s new laptop.) New keyboard \nThe MacBook Pro follows in the new MacBook’s footsteps and removed the chiclet-style keyboard found on old Mac laptops, replacing them with keys that barely move when you press them down. Pierce didn’t mind them: “The keyboard (a refined take on the 12-inch MacBook’s butterfly keys) doesn’t have much travel and takes getting used to, but it’s accurate and crisp and works beautifully.” \nThe Wall Street Journal’s Joanna Stern was a little less impressed: “You will get used to the spring of the keys on the new flat keyboard. You also get used to sleeping on a rock when camping. What won’t the people around you get used to? The loud clacking sound of the keys.” Not a lot of ports. (Apple) No ports \nThe new MacBook Pros only sport four new USB-C ports, meaning that you’re likely going to need adapters to connect any devices that you used to be able to connect to older MacBook Pros with ease. Stern called using the new Macs a “dongle nightmare.” But long-term, Recode’s Walt Mossberg thinks this won’t likely be an issue for the average user: “I honestly don’t think this is a big problem for average Mac users, whose main need will likely be a new Mac-to-iPhone cable ($19 from Apple). And I believe that, over time, most peripherals will switch to USB-C, since other companies—not just Apple—are behind it.” \n(Mossberg also called the new laptops a “tweener” but I have no idea if that’s a good or a bad thing or even what that means.) \nThere are some advantages to USB-C, however, such as how fast they can transfer data, and the fact that you can’t you won’t spend hours trying to make sure you’re putting your cables in the right way up. As Ochs put it: “That standard is the future, and offers some real benefits like transfer speeds of up to 40Gbps and support for two external monitors up to 5K each. Right now, though, in the year 2016, I would have preferred a mix of USB-C and full-size USB sockets.” Poor battery life \nThe Verge’s Jacob Kastrenakes said the batteries were an issue , and he only get a charge of more than about six hours once: “It turns out, however, that the bigger issue with these machines isn’t the performance, but the battery life. Apple promises 10 hours, but our tests fell far short of that.” Engadget’s Dana Wollman found “inconsistencies ” in her battery life tests, only sometimes getting close to the 10 hours Apple promised that the computer would have. Regardless, she said, that’s lower than the 12-ish hours battery life she got on old MacBook Pros she tested. Good design \nLike just about every Apple product for the last decade or so, most reviewers agree that Apple’s industrial design is still second-to-none. Stern said, “Compared with my rotting MacBook Air and the old MacBook Pro, the new Pros look like they’ve been on a serious juice cleanse.” Kastrenakes agreed: “The hardware is incredible, macOS is a joy to use, and I don’t want to give up this screen and keyboard. It’s a fantastic laptop on build alone.” \nMany reviewers also commented on the inexplicably massive new trackpad, which is nearly twice as large as the one on last year’s 13-inch model. The new trackpad also has a pressure-sensitive function like the screen on an iPhone 6S or 7, which allows you to access different functions if you press harder. Stern said that “Apple makes the best trackpad on any laptop, regardless of operating system,” but did have issues touching by mistake because of its omnipresence. Use your finger to pay for things. (Apple) The price \nMacBook Pros have never been cheap machines, and the new ones are no different. The 13-inch model with a Touch Bar starts at $1,800, and the 15-inch model at $2,400. The New York Times’ Brian X. Chen said that storage constraints may be an issue for some owners, adding, “The MacBook Pros are also expensive, and some users may end up spending thousands of dollars above the retail price for add-ons like extra storage.” (The new Pros all ship with either 256 or 512 GB hard drives, and only the more expensive models can be upgraded to 1 TB—for an extra $400). Chen’s review even goes as far as to potentially suggest a cheaper Chromebook, or a “Hackintosh”—a standard Windows PC that’s been modified to run macOS—over the new Macs. \nKastrenakes called the 13-inch model “Overpriced and underpowered,” and Pierce put it in even simpler terms: “Laptops aren’t supposed to be this expensive, are they?”",

Sorry By Bob Brown , Network World | Nov 14, 2016 11:05 AM PT MacBook sales rare so far for Black Friday 2016 See larger image Apple appetite \nApple traditionally gives retailers little leeway on iPhone, iPad and Mac promotions, even around Black Friday, but retailers do find ways around these restrictions by bundling phones with gift cards and other goodies. Apple typically slips a few Black Friday deals out close to the Thanksgiving holiday. But here are deals we know about already on iPhones, iPads, Apple Watches and more. (Black Friday watchers such as BFads and Best Black Friday have been a big help in keeping tabs on deals.) See larger image Target: iPhone 7 or 7 Plus \nPut $0 down and sign up for a 24-month installment plan ($36 for 128GB Plus, $31 for 128GB iPhone 7) and you’ll get a $250 Target gift card.

Phone activations begin at 9 pm on Thanksgiving night. See larger image Toys R Us: Apple iPod Touch \nThere’s a product you don’t hear much about anymore, but some parents still like to ease their kids into smartphones with these Apple gadgets. Toys R Us is knocking $50 off the price of these devices, which range from $200 to $400 depending See larger image Walmart: iPad mini 2 tablet \nWalmart is making the price on this pretty mini, by cutting $70 off the usual $270 price for this 32GB model. See larger image hhgregg: iPad Air 2 with WiFi \nThe retailer knocks $50 off this lightweight 32GB Apple tablet with a 9.7-inch Retina Display screen, for a final price of $350. See larger image Target: Apple iPad Pro 9.7-inch tablet \nGet the big Apple iPad with 128GB of storage for $450, which is about $150 off via this deal.

Best Buy is cutting $200 off the regular price to sell it for $800. See larger image Kohl’s: Apple Watch Series 1 & 2 \nApple and Kohl’s have buddied up so that the retailer better known for its clothing sales will be adding Apple Watches to the accessories it sells. The Series 1 & 2 watches will sell for $269 and $369, respectively, which is no bargain, but Kohl’s sweetens the deal for holiday shoppers by including $105 in Kohl’s cash for Series 2 buyers and $75 in Kohl’s cash for Series 1 buyers. See larger image Target: Apple Watch Series 1 \nTarget is lopping about $80 off the Series 1 model, which will then cost about $200. It’s not offering any breaks on Series 2 as of now.

      "text": "David Einhorn’s hedge fund Greenlight Capital Inc. reduced its positions in some of its biggest holdings including Apple Inc. and General Motors Co. in the third quarter, while disclosing a new stake in U.S. Steel Corp.\nThe hedge fund again reduced its holdings in Apple AAPL, -2.51% , this time by 24%, or 1.7 million shares. The iPhone maker remains Greenlight’s largest position, worth $586.8 million as of Sept. 30. Greenlight also shed 1.2%, or about 212,000 shares, of GM GM, -2.18% , its No. 2 investment.\nThe hedge fund exited its position in rental-car company Hertz Global Holdings Inc. HRI, +0.24% in the quarter, selling 3.3 million shares valued at roughly $36.5 million. That moved proved timely as Hertz shares plunged last week in the wake of disappointing financial results and a lowered outlook for the year.\nMeanwhile, Greenlight acquired 3.09 million shares of U.S. Steel X, +8.05% , valued at roughly $58.3 million as of Sept. 30. Though U.S. Steel recently lowered its outlook for 2016, its shares have surged this year.\nAn expanded version of this report appears on WSJ.com .\nAlso popular on WSJ.com:\nRNC Chair Reince Priebus is named Donald Trump’s chief of staff.\nCalifornia, as Clinton territory, finds itself a political outlier.\nMore from MarketWatch What Donald Trump's Presidency Could Mean for Taxes Why investors could come to regret last week’s appetite for stocks ‘Suspicious’ China has a pointed message for Donald Trump about Apple and Boeing",

      "text": "report malware 1 screenshot An easy to install software package that helps you update the firmware of your Apple TV device to the latest officially released version. The Apple TV devices offer you the possibility to access a wide collection of video content at HD quality, such as TV shows, movies, live transmissions, and so on. You can also use the device to listen to music or to browse through photo collections. However, to make sure that you have access to everything your Apple TV device has to offer, you must patch its firmware periodically, using the latest Apple released updater packages. Each new patch includes either stability and performance improvements, or new features, so updating the firmware to the latest version as soon as possible is highly advisable. Manually download the latest Apple TV firmware Usually, you can download and install the latest Apple TV firmware through the device: in the Settings menu, select the General panel, and check the Update Software option. If there are any available downloads, Apple TV saves them locally, and then starts installing the new patch (note that you must not disconnect the Apple TV device during this process). However, if you want to bypass this channel, you can manually download the firmware patch from the Apple support page, regardless of your Apple TV model. This is very useful if you have a poor internet connection and you want to apply the same patch to multiple devices. Effortlessly update or restore the Apple TV firmware To get started you must connect the Apple TV device to your Mac via USB, launch iTunes, and identify the device model. The next step is to manually download the appropriate firmware package and then proceed to update or restore the firmware for the connected device, via iTunes. To conclude, if you need to troubleshoot your Apple TV device, or if you want to simply apply the latest firmware update without making use of the over-the-air feature, you can manually download the software package and install them via USB.

      "text": "NEW YORK — Apple is making it easier for people to give to charities by expanding its Apple Pay payments service to nonprofits.\nApple Pay is mostly known for enabling purchases at retail stores with the tap of an iPhone, although the service can also be used for online transactions on apps and websites. Apple had limited this to buying goods and services — until now.\nThe American Red Cross, United Way and 18 other nonprofits will accept Apple Pay starting Monday. Others are coming soon.\nApple Pay can speed transactions because people don’t have to re-enter card and contact information, though people need to enable the service first. Apple says that websites and apps accepting Apple Pay report seeing twice as many people complete transactions, compared with other payment methods.\nSeparately, Samsung says a payment service on its phones, Samsung Pay, will start offering points for each transaction, regardless of the amount spent. They will be redeemable for gift cards and Samsung products.\nAmericans are just starting to warm up to mobile payment services such as Apple Pay and Samsung Pay. One of the chief hurdles is the fact that for in-store transactions, it’s not that difficult to pull out a plastic card to pay. And many merchants still do not accept such mobile payments. Although usage is growing, mobile payments are still a small portion of overall sales.\n ",

      "text": "Apple stock extends losses after China warning about Trump By Noel Randewich Pin it Share An Apple logo hangs above the entrance to the Apple store on 5th Avenue in the Manhattan borough of New York City, July 21, 2015. REUTERS/Mike Segar/File Photo More By Noel Randewich SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Apple's stock extended recent losses on Monday after a warning that iPhone sales could suffer if President-elect Donald Trump follows through on campaign threats to impose new tariffs on China. Apple is among several major technology stocks, including Amazon.com , Facebook and Alphabet , selling off since Tuesday's election as investors shift funds into financial and public works companies seen benefiting from deregulation and infrastructure spending under President-elect Trump. In a continuation of that trend, the Cupertino, California company's stock fell 2.5 percent on Monday, bringing its loss since Tuesday's election to almost 5 percent, compared to the S&P 500's <.SPX> 1.16 percent advance. Adding to concern for Apple investors, an op-ed published in the China government-backed Global Times on Sunday warned of \"tit-for-tat\" retaliation should Trump follow through on a campaign pledge to impose 45-percent tariffs on all imports from China. \"A batch of Boeing orders will be replaced by Airbus. US auto and iPhone sales in China will suffer a setback, and US soybean and maize imports will be halted,\" the op-ed said. China has already become a disappointment for Apple, failing to deliver rapid growth that the company hoped would make up for slower iPhone sales in the United States and other mature markets. Revenue from China slumped 30 percent in Apple's September quarter, worse than the Americas' 7 percent decline. Apple's China sales could be hurt by potential trade conflicts as well as the country's weakening currency, said Rosenblatt Securities analyst Jun Zhang by email. He said he believes China iPhone sales fell in October, even after fixing supply issues affecting the iPhone 7 Plus. Synovus Trust Company Senior Portfolio Manager Daniel Morgan, who owns $33 million worth of Apple shares, warned not to read too much into Trump's campaign trail threats against China, at least in the near term. \"You just don't just jump in and start rewriting trade agreements,\" Morgan said.

      "text": "Business Apple stock extends losses after China warning about Trump An Apple logo hangs above the entrance to the Apple store on 5th Avenue in the Manhattan borough of New York City. Photo: Reuters Published: 6:20   Updated: 6:50   \nSAN FRANCISCO - Apple's <AAPL.O> stock extended recent losses on Monday after a warning that iPhone sales could suffer if President-elect Donald Trump follows through on campaign threats to impose new tariffs on China. \nApple is among several major technology stocks, including Amazon.com <AMZN.O>, Facebook <FB.O> and Alphabet <GOOGL.O>, selling off since Tuesday's election as investors shift funds into financial and public works companies seen benefiting from deregulation and infrastructure spending under President-elect Trump. \nIn a continuation of that trend, the Cupertino, California company's stock fell 2.5 percent on Monday, bringing its loss since Tuesday's election to almost 5 percent, compared to the S&P 500's <.SPX> 1.16 percent advance. \nAdding to concern for Apple investors, an op-ed published in the China government-backed Global Times on Sunday warned of \"tit-for-tat\" retaliation should Trump follow through on a campaign pledge to impose 45-percent tariffs on all imports from China. \n\"A batch of Boeing <BA.N> orders will be replaced by Airbus. US auto and iPhone sales in China will suffer a setback, and US soybean and maize imports will be halted,\" the op-ed said. \nChina has already become a disappointment for Apple, failing to deliver rapid growth that the company hoped would make up for slower iPhone sales in the United States and other mature markets. \nRevenue from China slumped 30 percent in Apple's September quarter, worse than the Americas' 7 percent decline. \nApple's China sales could be hurt by potential trade conflicts as well as the country's weakening currency, said Rosenblatt Securities analyst Jun Zhang by email. He said he believes China iPhone sales fell in October, even after fixing supply issues affecting the iPhone 7 Plus. \nSynovus Trust Company Senior Portfolio Manager Daniel Morgan, who owns $33 million worth of Apple shares, warned not to read too much into Trump's campaign trail threats against China, at least in the near term. \n\"You just don't just jump in and start rewriting trade agreements,\" Morgan said.

      "text": "  @05:50PM from the new-and-improved dept. Whereas Apple's new 13-inch MacBook Pros feature integrated Iris Pro graphics, the 15-inch MacBook Pros feature dedicated AMD graphics, resulting in significant performance improvements over previous MacBook Pro models . Ars Technica's Andrew Cunningham found the Radeon Pro 455 graphics chip in particular to be a \" significant boost \" over the dedicated GPUs available in the 2012-2015 MacBook Pro models, such as the Nvidia GeForce GTX 650M, Nvidia GeForce GTX 750M, and AMD Radeon R9 M370X. MacRumors reports: AMD's Polaris-based Radeon Pro 450, Radeon Pro 455, and built-to-order Radeon Pro 460 GPUs in the new 15-inch MacBook Pro support up to six displays, whereas Intel's integrated GPUs affixed to the logic board can drive a total of three displays. The expanded support enables the new MacBook Pro to drive two of Apple and LG's new UltraFine 5K displays at 60Hz simultaneously. Intel's GPUs can't because, due to bandwidth limitations of the DisplayPort 1.2 spec, the two 5K displays technically function as four displays. This method is known as Multi-Stream Transport (MST). Apple could have used Nvidia's faster Pascal-based GPUs, which support DisplayPort 1.3, but Thunderbolt 3 and most monitors do not support the higher-bandwidth spec yet. In the meantime, Nvidia's GPUs can only drive up to three displays beyond the main MacBook Pro screen -- not enough for dual 5K displays over MST. Apple officially says the 15-inch MacBook Pro offers up to 130% faster graphics performance, and up to 2.5x more computing power per watt, compared to the previous-generation 15-inch MacBook Pro, but those stats are based on the built-to-order Radeon Pro 460 chip that costs between $100 and $200 extra.",

      "text": "Samsung's $8 billion deal to buy infotainment and audio hardware giant Harman ( HAR ) might not be disastrous for Apple's ( AAPL ) automotive efforts, given Harman's business model. But it does arguably show how Apple's hardware philosophy can be a problem.\nThe acquisition features a 28% premium to Harman's Friday close, but still only involves a moderate valuation of 15 times Harman's expected 2017 earnings. It gives Samsung a company that supplies infotainment systems to automakers such as Audi, Toyota, Jeep, Mercedes-Benz, BMW and Chrysler, as well as popular audio products for homes and cars under brands such as JBL, Bang & Olufsen (automotive only) and Harman Kardon. Parts of the latter business complement Samsung's TV business.\nHarman claims that 30 million cars feature its technology, and that its automotive backlog stands at $24 billion. In addition to its core car and audio businesses, the company provides custom audio and lighting solutions to enterprise and entertainment clients, and IoT and analytics solutions for a variety of customers.\nHarman lowers the dependence of Samsung's consumer electronics business on a smartphone business that has had some issues lately, and for which slowing industry growth and tougher competition from Google are going to be long-term problems.\nIt makes the company a top player in a connected car market seeing healthy if unspectacular growth as consumer interest in advanced entertainment, navigation and connectivity features grows, and also in an audio hardware market where Harman has been taking share.\nApple is a holding in Jim Cramer's Action Alerts PLUS Charitable Trust Portfolio .

It's one offered by comedian Bill Maher on his HBO show \"Real Time\"(around the 49-minute mark). \nLiberals \"just need survival products tailored to our lifestyle,\" said Maher. And who understands lifestyle better than Apple?\nWelcome, then, to the iDefender. This fine and necessary new product is, according to Maher, \"like any other shotgun, just twice as expensive, only accepts Apple's proprietary iShells and they removed the barrel sight to make it thinner.\"\nSurely, once these are launched -- my tagline: Now You Can Shoot And Be Hip -- open carry will be embraced by all.\nMore Technically Incorrect Facebook is a 'cesspool of nonsense,' says John Oliver Man started wildfire to get more Facebook views, police say Donald Trump slams Times for 'inaccurate coverage' Who wouldn't want to be seen with this marvelously-designed gun? It seems to have elements of aluminium, as Jony Ive would say, plenty of sleek white and even an actual iPhone placed near your chin, as you begin shooting.\nHow easy it would be to open fire and broadcast on Facebook Live at the same time. And how much it would add to your own personal style to walk into a San Francisco speakeasy and find it so much easier to speak to people.\nI see fashion brands competing with this Apple trend. Who wouldn't want a Gucci gun for Christmas?",

      "text": " Shares of Apple ( AAPL ) have been retreating since Donald Trump was elected president last Tuesday, because investors are concerned about a trade war with China, BGC Financial analyst Colin Gillis said on CNBC's \"Power Lunch\" on Monday afternoon. The firm has a \"sell\" rating and $85 price target on the stock.\nPeople are scared that \"Apple is going to suffer and that it will suffer more so than some of the other multi-national tech companies,\" he said.\nApple trades at the lowest P/E multiple of companies with a $200 billion or higher market cap because it's a \"one-product company,\" Gillis explained. The company relies on its iPhone too much and lacks innovation so it doesn't \"deserve\" to trade at a premium.\nA trade war would mean Apple's products would become more expensive in the U.S., which is its biggest market.\nBut an even bigger concern than a trade war is domestic competitors in China that will limit Apple's growth there, Gillis claimed. \"The number one item to drive Apple to my price target of $85 is the rise of the domestic Chinese producers.\"\nInstead of Apple, investors should buy shares of Alphabet (GOOGL) because it has multiple products that allow for new revenue streams, he advised.\n(Alphabet and Apple are held in Jim Cramer's charitable trust Action Alerts PLUS. See all of his holding with a free trial here. )\nSeparately, TheStreet Ratings objectively rated this stock according to its \"risk-adjusted\" total return prospect over a 12-month investment horizon. Not based on the news in any given day, the rating may differ from Jim Cramer's view or that of this articles's author.",

      "text": "Google Pixel Gets Hacked in Less than One Minute, Apple's Safari in 20 Seconds GO Chinese team of white-hat hackers uses 0-day vulnerability Nov 14, 2016 13:15   The entire debacle about security in the smartphone industry has just received another chapter and it doesn't look good for Android and iOS platforms. First of all, it doesn't look good for Google and Android , as one of the most recent smartphones launched by the search giant has been compromised in less than 60 seconds. During the PwnFest hacking competition , a team of white-hat hackers from China managed to compromise Google's Pixel smartphone in under 1 minute. The team called Qihoo 360 managed to achieve the hack using a zero-day vulnerability to remotely install code on the smartphone. Upon installing the new code, both the Google Play store and Chrome for Android displayed the message “Pwned by 360 Alpha Team.” Since this was a competition for white-hackers, the achievement did not go unrewarded. Google offered Qihoo 360 a prize of $120,000 just for being able to hack its Pixel smartphone. Those of you who own the Pixel phone shouldn't be worried though, as Google announced that the exploit found was patched within 24 hours of the event and the changes have already been pushed into the stable version of Chrome. Safari, Microsoft Edge and Adobe Flash fell, too However, the Chinese team eventually got home with no less than $520,000 in cash prizes after demonstrating additional vulnerabilities in Microsoft Edge on Windows 10 and another exploit on Adobe Flash. On a side note, iOS fans shouldn't be laughing at all, as reputable Chinese hackers Pangu Team and JH managed to hack Apple's Safari browser in just 20 seconds, thus earning no less than $80,000 in prizes. The Chinese team used a root privilege escalation zero-day to compromise the Safari browser so fast, but Apple is likely to patch the exploit in their next update. So, no matter what smartphone you own, there will always be ways to hack into someone else's data, it's just a matter of time before hackers find these methods.",

      "text": "Apple Tested Touch Screens On Macs, But Found It Absurd: MacBook Pro With Touch Bar Is As Far As It Goes 14 November 2016, 6:44 pm EST By Alexandra Burlacu Tech Times Computer Technology - How Laptops, Personal Computers And Tablets Are Changing The World Now Playing Apple has apparently toyed with the idea of adding multi-touch to the Mac, but thought it would be a disaster. The MacBook Pro's touch bar is one thing, but adding touch to a 27-inch iMac would be absurd and it's not going to happen, says Apple's Phil Schiller. ( Stephen Lam | Getty Images ) Advertisement \nApple tried enabling touch screen support on its desktops and laptops, but the result was disastrous, according to Phil Schiller, Apple SVP of Worldwide Marketing. \nThe MacBook Pro 2016 drew lots of attention with its new Touch Bar , which adds somewhat of a part-time touch experience without going full on as a touchpad. \nNevertheless, some saw the Touch Bar as a stepping stone toward real touch screens adorning Macs and MacBooks sometime in the future, but that's not the case. \nAs Schiller explains to Backchannel, a multi-touch display on a MacBook would not work out and would not be enough, as it would start a divide between the iMac and MacBook. \nImplementing a full-on touch display on an iMac all-in-one PC would be \"absurd,\" Schiller says, because it would make it really cumbersome to interact with the screen rather than the traditional keyboard and mouse. It Would Be A Disaster, Absurd \nDespite its instincts, however, Apple decided to try it out just in case it was wrong. To ensure it's not missing out on anything, Apple tested touch screen technology on the Mac and it bolstered its belief that it would be a \"disaster.\" \n\"Can you imagine a 27-inch iMac where you have to reach over the air to try to touch and do things? That becomes absurd,\" Schiller explains. \nHe further points out that adding multi-touch would imply a complete redesign of the menu bar for touch, which would in turn mar the experience for users who continue to rely on more standard pointer devices such as a mouse. \n\"You can't optimize for both,\" adds Schiller. \"It's the lowest common denominator thinking.\" MacBook Pro Touch Bar Is As Close As It Gets \nOver the years, Apple has revisited the idea several times and tested touch screens on a Mac, only to be more convinced that it wouldn't work well. It would be cumbersome and inconvenient, quite the opposite of what Apple is trying to achieve with its devices. \nWhen asked whether the MacBook Pro Touch Bar was the start of a larger bid to bring iOS influences to the macOS platform, Schiller assured that it's not the case. The idea behind the Touch Bar gracing the latest MacBook Pro was not to port iOS to the Mac, but rather to tap iOS technology to improve the Mac experience. What About The MacBook Pro Ports? \nThe MacBook Pro also raised a bit of controversy over its port situation, adding only USB-C/Thunderbolt 3 ports. This drew plenty of criticism from Apple fans who didn't want to be forced into purchasing additional adapters, cables and dongles to connect other Apple devices to their MacBook Pro. \nIn this respect, Schiller stands by the company's decision to redesign ports and says that Apple is \"absolutely more sure than ever\" that it was the right thing to do because USB-C will become the standard. MacBook Pro 2016: Love It Or Hate It \nLastly, according to Schiller, the most major difference between MacBook Pro fans and critics comes down to one thing: those who have interacted with the MacBook Pro and those who haven't. \nFor the latter category, things would perhaps change soon since the first batch of MacBook Pro 2016 laptops has started shipping out to preorder customers.

      "text": "In what's become something of an unofficial tradition, Apple's latest product introduction was not met with applause, but rather with an incessant onslaught of criticism. I'm talking of course about Apple's new Touch Bar equipped MacBook Pro which helped kick-start a firestorm of controversy surrounding company's overall concern for bonafide pro users like developers and creatives. While we've already covered a number of technical criticisms regarding Apple's new MacBook Pro, from a 16GB ceiling on RAM to a lack of even one USB-A port, a related narrative emerging in the wake of the MacBook Pro introduction is that Apple has lost its ability to innovate. With many quick to proclaim the Touch Bar as nothing more than a gimmick, many were just as quick to claim that Apple could learn a lot from Microsoft and its recently unveiled Surface Studio. \n\n(more…) Trending right now: \nBest Buy just released a brand new Black Friday ad: Here’s what changed 11 paid iPhone apps on sale for free today The 5 best new features coming to your iPhone in iOS 10.2 ",

      "text": "Apple Pay expands to charities, Samsung Pay to offer rewards Updated 0 \nNEW YORK (AP) — Apple is making it easier for people to give to charities by expanding its Apple Pay payments service to nonprofits. \nApple Pay is mostly known for enabling purchases at retail stores with the tap of an iPhone, although the service can also be used for online transactions on apps and websites. Apple had limited this to buying goods and services — until now. \nThe American Red Cross, United Way and 18 other nonprofits will accept Apple Pay starting Monday. Others are coming soon. \nApple Pay can speed transactions because people don't have to re-enter card and contact information, though people need to enable the service first. Apple says that websites and apps accepting Apple Pay report seeing twice as many people complete transactions, compared with other payment methods. \nSeparately, Samsung says a payment service on its phones, Samsung Pay, will start offering points for each transaction, regardless of the amount spent. They will be redeemable for gift cards and Samsung products. \nAmericans are just starting to warm up to mobile payment services such as Apple Pay and Samsung Pay. One of the chief hurdles is the fact that for in-store transactions, it's not that difficult to pull out a plastic card to pay. And many merchants still do not accept such mobile payments. Although usage is growing, mobile payments are still a small portion of overall sales. Tags",

      "text": "Sales at Apple ( AAPL ) , Boeing ( BA ) and top U.S. automakers could take a hit if President-elect Donald Trump carries out his promise to impose a 45% tariff on Chinese imports, China's state-backed newspaper Global Times warned in an editorial published on Sunday.\nTrump repeatedly criticized China throughout his presidential campaign, saying he would label the government as a \"currency manipulator\" immediately upon entering the White House. The Global Times threatened that actions like that could trigger \"countermeasures\" by the Chinese government, causing a \"number of U.S. industries\" to be impaired.\n\"A batch of Boeing orders will be replaced by Airbus. U.S. auto and iPhone sales in China will suffer a setback, and U.S. soybean and maize imports will be halted,\" the Global Times said in its editorial. \"China can also limit the number of Chinese students studying in the U.S.\"\nCounter-measures could spell further trouble for Apple in the region. In its latest earnings report, sales in Greater China fell 30% year-over-year. The region made up about 19% of the Cupertino, CA-based company's revenue during the quarter.\nThe slump is believed to be tied to increased demand for smartphones from local manufactures like Huawei and Xiaomi, according to Barron's . Additionally, China in April shut down Apple's online book and movie services in the country.\nApple shares were trading down 2.7% to $105.48 on Monday afternoon.\nApple is a holding in Jim Cramer's Action Alerts PLUS Charitable Trust Portfolio.

By: Reuters | San Francisco | Published: November 15, 2016 3:14 AM Revenue from China slumped 30 percent in Apple’s September quarter, worse than the Americas’ 7 percent decline. (Reuters) \nApple’s stock extended recent losses on Monday after a warning that iPhone sales could suffer if President-elect Donald Trump follows through on campaign threats to impose new tariffs on China. \nApple is among several major technology stocks, including Amazon .com, Facebook and Alphabet, selling off since Tuesday’s election as investors shift funds into financial and public works companies seen benefitting from deregulation and infrastructure spending under President-elect Trump. \nIn a continuation of that trend, the Cupertino, California company’s stock fell 2.5 percent on Monday, bringing its loss since Tuesday’s election to almost 5 percent, compared to the S&P 500’s 1.16 percent advance. \nAdding to concern for Apple investors, an op-ed published in the China government-backed Global Times on Sunday warned of “tit-for-tat” retaliation should Trump follow through on a campaign pledge to impose 45-percent tariffs on all imports from China. \n“A batch of Boeing orders will be replaced by Airbus. US auto and iPhone sales in China will suffer a setback, and US soybean and maize imports will be halted,” the op-ed said. \nChina has already become a disappointment for Apple, failing to deliver rapid growth that the company hoped would make up for slower iPhone sales in the United States and other mature markets. \nRevenue from China slumped 30 percent in Apple’s September quarter, worse than the Americas’ 7 percent decline. \nApple’s China sales could be hurt by potential trade conflicts as well as the country’s weakening currency, said Rosenblatt Securities analyst Jun Zhang by email. He said he believes China iPhone sales fell in October, even after fixing supply issues affecting the iPhone 7 Plus. \nSynovus Trust Company Senior Portfolio Manager Daniel Morgan, who owns $33 million worth of Apple shares, warned not to read too much into Trump’s campaign trail threats against China, at least in the near term. \n“You just don’t just jump in and start rewriting trade agreements,” Morgan said.

(Reuters) \nApple is making it easier for people to give to charities by expanding its Apple Pay payments service to nonprofits. Apple Pay is mostly known for enabling purchases at retail stores with the tap of an iPhone, although the service can also be used for online transactions on apps and websites. Apple had limited this to buying goods and services – until now. \nThe American Red Cross, United Way and 18 other nonprofits will accept Apple Pay starting Monday. Others are coming soon. \nApple Pay can speed up transactions because people don’t have to re-enter card and contact information. \nSeparately, Samsung says a payment service on its phones, Samsung Pay, will start offering points for each transaction, redeemable for gift cards and products.

      "title": "Apple Highlights Mac Apps Updated With Support for MacBook Pro Touch Bar",
      "text": "As the new MacBook Pro models with Touch Bar begin arriving to customers, Apple has updated the Mac App Store with a featured section highlighting a selection of Mac apps that have been updated with Touch Bar support.\n\nApple's list includes 14 apps that now work with the Touch Bar, like Day One, OmniGraffle 7, PocketCAS, Mail Designer Pro 3, Focus, and 1Password. Some of the apps, like Final Cut Pro and djay Pro, were previously shown off by Apple on stage when the MacBook Pro was announced.\nThe scope of Touch Bar support varies by app, but in many apps, once-buried settings and frequently used shortcuts are now available in the Touch Bar, allowing users to speed up their workflows. In djay Pro, for example, the Touch Bar can be used for full music manipulation, while in 1Password, it offers options for quickly adding or finding passwords.\n\nOne of the chief complaints in MacBook Pro reviews released today was the lack of support by third-party apps, but that should soon improve as developers finish updating their apps with Touch Bar compatibility.\n\nMany apps, including popular titles like Pixelmator, Photoshop , Affinity Design, and Microsoft Office, will be introducing Touch Bar support in the coming weeks.\nRelated Roundup: MacBook Pro\nBuyer's Guide: MacBook Pro (Buy Now)\n\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

      "text": "© 2016 Time Inc. All rights reserved. Citibank Launches Challenge to Apple and Google With Citi Pay \nCiti is the latest company to enter the mobile wallet wars, which is dominated by Apple Pay, Android Pay, PayPal , Samsung Pay, and others. \nOn Thursday, the finance titan c unveiled Citi Pay, a new mobile wallet for Android phone users. The concept is similar to Android Pay, Google’s googl mobile payments service, in that customers load Citibank credit card and debit card information onto an Android app. \nShoppers can then use that app to make in-store purchases at any merchant equipped with point-of-sale registers supporting near-field communication (NFC) technology, which enables frictionless payments between smartphones and registers. Users place their phones near the registers’ sensors for payments instead of swiping a card. Get Data Sheet , Fortune’s technology newsletter. \nCustomers can also use Citibank online login and password information to make online purchases and in-app purchases. Citi is also partnering with Mastercard ma to allow Citi Pay customers to use the platform as a payment method with hundreds of thousands of online merchants across 33 countries at launch. \nCiti Pay won’t launch in the United States until early 2017, but it will roll out later this year to customers in Singapore, Australia, and Mexico. \nCiti isn’t the first financial institution to take aim at the mobile wallet. Chase Bank ccf debuted its own mobile wallet in 2015. Earlier this year, Wells Fargo wfc launched a similar mobile wallet. \nBanks, like Apple aapl and Google, are hoping to connect with their customers where they are spending the most time: on their smartphones. Citibank even has a financial technology innovations group, called Citi FinTech, which is comprised of 40 employees from various parts of Citi and poached from tech companies such as Amazon and PayPal.",

      "text": "CNBC.com SHARES \nAs the market digested the news of a Donald Trump win and the Dow rally extended to six days, Jim Cramer said investors are now starting to realize there's another negative side to the story . \n\"I smell a trade war. That is what I think this market has become all about,\" the \" Mad Money \" host said. \nStocks initially rallied last week from the prospects of tax cuts and infrastructure and defense spending. \nOn Monday, however, investors finally realized that President-elect Trump could crack down on trading partners who take advantage of the U.S. market without opening theirs, Cramer said. They are starting to see what it could mean if Trump does more than just talk tough about imports and dumping. \nApple shares declined more than 2 percent on Monday, revealing the company's vulnerability to a Trump regime. \n\"Trump has stated repeatedly that Apple should make more products here. Apple might be caught between the proverbial rock and a hard place ... I know the Chinese picked the wrong day to single out Apple,\" Cramer said. Carlo Allegri | Reuters A ship is unloaded in Miami, Florida. \nHarman International Industries CEO Dinesh Paliwal told Cramer on Monday that he is thrilled that Samsung Electronics is acquiring the company for $8 billion. \n\"Frankly when we see that the integration of these two companies, when we put it together, this is really dynamite because it's so complimentary,\" Paliwal said. \nShares of Harman skyrocketed 25 percent on the news that Samsung is acquiring the company for $112 per share, a nearly 28 percent premium over where it traded on Friday. It signaled a major push for Samsung into auto-related technology. \nMoving forward, Paliwal added that he plans to double down in cybersecurity. He believes that the threat has now extended into individuals homes, cars and personal devices. \nCyberark Software 's CEO Udi Mokady echoed the same sentiment to Cramer on Monday, stating that anything connected to the internet can be hacked. \nCyberark is the Israeli cybersecurity company that helps companies to protect administrator and privileged accounts. These are the accounts frequently targeted by hackers with the aim of getting the \"keys to the kingdom.\" \nMokady commented on the changing landscape of the cybersecurity industry. \n\"I think in the last couple of years we have seen a change. It's called the post-breach proactive security measure,\" Mokady said. \"We are coming in ahead of time to help secure against these advanced attacks, but we are seeing that the modern day customer is thinking 'OK we will be breached, let's make sure it's contained.'\" Ashlee Espinal | CNBC Dinesh Paliwal, Harman International CEO \nBank stocks have also rebounded since the presidential election. Cramer noted that all of the signals were there for investors to buy the banks, starting when JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon purchased 500,000 shares in the open market for $26.6 million on Feb. 11. \nWith JPMorgan closing at $79 on Monday, those shares are worth nearly $40 million. \n\"Maybe Dimon was lucky. Maybe he's just good. Either way, he's obviously still optimistic about JPMorgan, or else he would have taken up Trump on his offer to be Treasury secretary,\" Cramer said. \nAfter years of outperformance, the stock of CVS Health suffered a 10-point straight decline last week, leading Jim Cramer to wonder if it is a broken company or merely a broken stock . \n\"CVS has gone from a market darling to a total dog, as its once-vaunted pharmacy benefit manager business has become an albatross around its neck and the company loses share to its rivals,\" Cramer said. \nShares of CVS tripled from the summer of 2011 to the summer of 2015, but then fell into free-fall. They closed at $76 on Monday. The business includes both its 7,800 retail pharmacies, and its pharmacy benefit manager (PBM) segments. \n\"Maybe they can turn things around, but for now, CVS remains in the penalty box until we see them take concrete steps to lessen their dependence on what was once the golden goose, now just a turkey headed for a carving,\" Cramer said. \nIn the Lightning Round , Cramer gave his take on a few caller favorite stocks: \nAmerican Tower : \"There was a piece out today that Sprint might merge with T-Mobile and everybody decided to dump on American Tower. My thinking is when you get this kind of a move, you've got to wait until tomorrow mid-day because there are so many sellers out there.\" \nAmSurg Corp : \"This group is under pressure. Everything is so in flux in healthcare because of the new President that we just have to be on the sidelines. It's tough, because it looks so inexpensive. But sidelines is where we have to be.\"",

      "text": "Apple Explores Smart Glasses in Wearables Push Mark Gurman November 14, 2016 — 6:50 PM EST Early product testing comes as company searches for next hit Similar Google Glass project flopped as a consumer product \nApple Inc. is weighing an expansion into digital glasses, a risky but potentially lucrative area of wearable computing, according to people familiar with the matter. \nWhile still in an exploration phase, the device would connect wirelessly to iPhones, show images and other information in the wearer’s field of vision, and may use augmented reality, the people said. They asked not to be identified speaking about a secret project. \nApple has talked about its glasses project with potential suppliers, according to people familiar with those discussions. The company has ordered small quantities of near-eye displays from one supplier for testing, the people said. Apple hasn’t ordered enough components so far to indicate imminent mass-production, one of the people added. \nShould Apple ultimately decide to proceed with the device, it would be introduced in 2018 at the earliest, another person said. The Cupertino, California-based company tests many different products and is known to pivot, pause, or cancel projects without disclosing them. Apple spokeswoman Trudy Muller declined to comment.

You will now receive the Game Plan newsletter Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook is under pressure to deliver new products amid slowing sales of the iPhone, which accounts for two-thirds of Apple’s revenue. In July, he expressed enthusiasm for augmented reality after the rise of Pokemon Go, a location-based game that uses the technology. AR, as it’s known, adds images and other digital information to people’s view of the real world, while virtual reality completely surrounds them with a computer-generated environment.\nThe glasses may be Apple’s first hardware product targeted directly at AR, one of the people said. Cook has beefed up AR capabilities through acquisitions. In 2013, Apple bought PrimeSense, which developed motion-sensing technology in Microsoft Corp.’s Kinect gaming system. Purchases of software startups in the field, Metaio Inc. and Flyby Media Inc., followed in 2015 and 2016. \n“AR can be really great, and we have been and continue to invest a lot in this,” Cook said in a July 26 conference call with analysts. “We are high on AR for the long run. We think there are great things for customers and a great commercial opportunity.” \nApple has AR patents for things like street view in mapping apps. It was also awarded patents for smart glasses that make use of full-fledged virtual reality. Apple is unlikely to leverage VR in a mass-consumer product, Cook suggested in October. \n\"I can’t imagine everyone in here getting in an enclosed VR experience while you’re sitting in here with me, but I could imagine everyone in here in an AR experience right now,\" he said during an onstage discussion in Utah. \nApple’s challenge is fitting all the technology needed into a useful pair of internet-connected glasses that are small and sleek enough for regular people to wear. Google’s attempt to develop internet-connected eye wear flopped in part because its tiny battery ran out quickly. Google Glass, as it was called, also suffered a privacy backlash and poor public perception of its external design. \nAfter that disappointment, technology companies largely turned their immediate focus to VR and away from AR. Google recently introduced a VR headset alongside its Pixel smartphone, and Facebook Inc.’s Oculus VR unit has teamed up with Samsung Electronics Co. on a similar headset. Microsoft has the most public AR offering. Its HoloLens product shows holographic images in a user’s field of vision. \nApple’s effort may be more difficult because the chips, batteries and other components that will be available in a year or two may still not be small enough and powerful enough to build slim glasses capable of handling compelling AR experiences. \nHowever, given time, technical challenges may play to Apple’s strengths. The company specializes in turning technology that others have struggled with into easy-to-use devices for the masses. For example, Apple simplified fingerprint technology into an unlocking mechanism for the iPhone and took touch screens mainstream with the original iPhone. \nAugmented reality “is going to take a while, because there are some really hard technology challenges there, but it will happen in a big way, and we will wonder when it does, how we ever lived without it,” Cook said last month. “Like we wonder how we lived without our phone today.\" Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.",

      "text": "Xamarin \nMicrosoft is bringing Visual Studio, its widely used tool for writing software, to Apple's Macs.\nThe news will be announced at Microsoft's Connect conference later this week, but it was revealed early when the official blog entry went live a few days before. The blog has since been taken down, but a cached version remains via Google .\nVisual Studio is how a lot of programmers get work done, particularly those building software for Microsoft Windows or the web.\nBringing Visual Studio to Apple MacOS, the operating system preferred by many programmers, is going to turn a lot of heads. It's just the latest way Microsoft is reaching across the aisle to former rivals to win over programmers.\nThere's a catch: As Ars Technica points out in more technical detail , Visual Studio for Mac may share a name and aesthetic with its PC counterpart, but it won't be exactly the same as Visual Studio for Windows.\nUnder the hood, the Mac version of Visual Studio mainly functions as an update to Xamarin Studio, a tool for quickly and easily building apps that can run on Windows, iPhone, Android, Mac, the web, or anywhere else. Microsoft got Xamarin Studio, alongside the rest of Xamarin's technology , in a big buy earlier in 2016. Xamarin \nIn the same way that Microsoft's excellent Outlook apps for iPhone and Android are a direct successor to Acompli, a startup Microsoft bought in 2014 , this new Visual Studio for Mac looks to be a new name and face for Xamarin's technology.\nLots of programmers love Xamarin in its own right, though. So while Visual Studio for Windows may be more powerful on paper, there are still lots of developers who will still be able to do what they need to do on the Mac version, too.\nAnd it's a big flag in the ground for Microsoft — Xamarin Studio, and now Visual Studio for Mac, are designed to make it really easy for programmers to build their apps to the Microsoft Azure cloud , which is a big focus for Microsoft. By bringing a flagship brand to Mac, Microsoft is hoping to give that business a leg up.\nNOW WATCH: Here's what it's like to use Microsoft's new Paint 3D \n",

      "text": "(Reuters) – Apple’s stock extended recent losses on Monday after a warning that iPhone sales could suffer if President-elect Donald Trump follows through on campaign threats to impose new tariffs on China.\nApple is among several major technology stocks, including Amazon.com, Facebook and Alphabet, selling off since Tuesday’s election as investors shift funds into financial and public works companies seen benefiting from deregulation and infrastructure spending under President-elect Trump.\nIn a continuation of that trend, the Cupertino, California company’s stock fell 2.5 percent on Monday, bringing its loss since Tuesday’s election to almost 5 percent, compared to the S&P 500’s 1.16 percent advance.\nAdding to concern for Apple investors, an op-ed published in the China government-backed Global Times on Sunday warned of “tit-for-tat” retaliation should Trump follow through on a campaign pledge to impose 45-percent tariffs on all imports from China.\n“A batch of Boeing orders will be replaced by Airbus. US auto and iPhone sales in China will suffer a setback, and US soybean and maize imports will be halted,” the op-ed said.\nChina has already become a disappointment for Apple, failing to deliver rapid growth that the company hoped would make up for slower iPhone sales in the United States and other mature markets.\nRevenue from China slumped 30 percent in Apple’s September quarter, worse than the Americas’ 7 percent decline.\nApple’s China sales could be hurt by potential trade conflicts as well as the country’s weakening currency, said Rosenblatt Securities analyst Jun Zhang by email. He said he believes China iPhone sales fell in October, even after fixing supply issues affecting the iPhone 7 Plus.\nSynovus Trust Company Senior Portfolio Manager Daniel Morgan, who owns $33 million worth of Apple shares, warned not to read too much into Trump’s campaign trail threats against China, at least in the near term.\n“You just don’t just jump in and start rewriting trade agreements,” Morgan said.\n(Reporting by Noel Randewich; Editing by Tom Brown) \nGet more stories like this on Twitter & Facebook ",

      "text": "Touché Lets You Test Apple’s Touch Bar On Your Mac Before Upgrading  24 PST \nApple’s new 2016 MacBook Pros are an investment simply because they are so incredibly expensive. Whether or not you can justify paying for the laptops is entirely up to you, but we’re sure that some are also wondering if getting the version without the Touch Bar could be a way to save money, or would you end up be missing out on a feature? \nSure, you could play around with the Touch Bar in the Apple Store, but obviously this pales in comparison compared to using it on a daily basis. The good news that thanks to developer Daniel Jalkut of Red Sweater Software, he has created an app for Mac computers called Touché that will simulate the Touch Bar on the MacBook Pro . \nPrior to this, there was an app created for the Mac and iPad that would do the same thing, but installing that particular app was a tad tricky , so if you’re looking for something more simple and straightforward, this could be an alternative. Of course the experience of using Touch Bar on the screen versus on the touch panel is very different, but hopefully it will still give you a good enough idea of what to expect. \nThe app itself is a free download so if you’d like to check it out, then head on over to its website for the download . Uses will also be required to run the latest version of macOS which is 10.12.1 build number 16B2657. \nFiled in Apple > Computers . Read more about laptops and Macbook Pro . Related Articles",

      "text": "Apple is gearing up for the release of its latest software update, iOS 10.2. According to CNET , it's arriving in December with a string of new features that offer convenience and new ways to express yourself. Here's what we're most excited for:\nTV app Apple's new TV app for the Apple TV was demoed during October's Macbook keynote , but the program is coming to iOS as well. It will create a one-stop shop for all of your entertainment viewing needs, pulling content from numerous streaming apps into one organized service, which will then make recommendations based on viewing history over time.\nEmergency SOS This is a feature we hope you never have to use, but important nonetheless. Once updated to iOS 10.2, you'll be able to contact emergency services like 911 by simply tapping the iPhone's power button five times in a row. It'll be handy if you're ever in a precarious situation where you can't remove the phone from your pocket.\nNew emojis On a more lighthearted note, new emojis are coming to iOS. In total, 72 new emojis will become available with options like a face palm, avocado and, yes, a gorilla that everyone will undoubtedly call Harambe. Check out the full list of incoming emojis at the Unicode website.\nPreserve camera settings Fond of shooting in square mode for Instagram ? Really into black and white shots? Now you can save your favorite camera settings to open automatically instead of reverting back to the default options whenever you open the Camera app.\nCelebration iMessage effect Adopters of iOS 10 are aware of the special text effects available in iMessage. Now you can add one more to your repertoire: Celebration . 3D Touch any message you want to send as a celebration and watch as sparklers fill the screen and recipient with joy.",

An Apple logo hangs above the entrance to the Apple store on 5th Avenue in the Manhattan borough of New York City \nBy Noel Randewich \nSAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Apple's (O: AAPL ) stock extended recent losses on Monday after a warning that iPhone sales could suffer if President-elect Donald Trump follows through on campaign threats to impose new tariffs on China. \nApple is among several major technology stocks, including Amazon.com (O: AMZN ), Facebook (O: FB ) and Alphabet (O: GOOGL ), selling off since Tuesday's election as investors shift funds into financial and public works companies seen benefiting from deregulation and infrastructure spending under President-elect Trump. \nIn a continuation of that trend, the Cupertino, California company's stock fell 2.5 percent on Monday, bringing its loss since Tuesday's election to almost 5 percent, compared to the S&P 500's ( SPX ) 1.16 percent advance. \nAdding to concern for Apple investors, an op-ed published in the China government-backed Global Times on Sunday warned of \"tit-for-tat\" retaliation should Trump follow through on a campaign pledge to impose 45-percent tariffs on all imports from China. \n\"A batch of Boeing (N: BA ) orders will be replaced by Airbus. US auto and iPhone sales in China will suffer a setback, and US soybean and maize imports will be halted,\" the op-ed said. \nChina has already become a disappointment for Apple, failing to deliver rapid growth that the company hoped would make up for slower iPhone sales in the United States and other mature markets. \nRevenue from China slumped 30 percent in Apple's September quarter, worse than the Americas' 7 percent decline. \nApple's China sales could be hurt by potential trade conflicts as well as the country's weakening currency, said Rosenblatt Securities analyst Jun Zhang by email. He said he believes China iPhone sales fell in October, even after fixing supply issues affecting the iPhone 7 Plus. \nSynovus Trust Company Senior Portfolio Manager Daniel Morgan, who owns $33 million worth of Apple shares, warned not to read too much into Trump's campaign trail threats against China, at least in the near term. \n\"You just don't just jump in and start rewriting trade agreements,\" Morgan said.

Apple said to be mulling new focus on smart glasses 0 Share: Up Next Fantastic Beasts' Dan Fogler sees magic in tech \nApple is considering an expansion into the wearables market with the launch of its own line of smart glasses, Bloomberg News reported Monday. \nThe device would connect wirelessly to the user's iPhone, displaying images and other information to the glasses wearer, Bloomberg reported, citing unidentified people described as familiar with the matter. The device, which is described as still being in the exploration phase, might also include augmented reality, Bloomberg reported. \nApple did not immediately respond to a request for comment. \nWhile a smart watch play could help expand Apple's footprint in the wearables market, it's not without its pitfalls. The company is already the leading smartwatch maker, but that market is said to be in decline . \nMeanwhile, the smart glasses market is tricky. The biggest player in that sector so far has been Google with its Google Glass, but it couldn't shake a nerd factor that made the $1,500 wearable uncool. Google paused the project in January, discontinuing production of the costly prototype. The company is reportedly working on a new model that is less nerdy.",

      "text": "Apple’s CEO, Tim Cook , has an obvious passion for augmented reality , and a new report might shed some light on what that could turn into eventually. \nBloomberg reports that Apple is reportedly considering launching a pair of smart glasses. The report cites information gathered from people familiar with the matter, and it says that Apple is still in the “exploration phase” of the idea, which means if the company is indeed working on it, it’s still in the early days of the long process. \n“Apple is weighing an expansion into digital glasses, a risky but potentially lucrative area of wearable computing, according to people familiar with the matter, Bloomberg News reports.” \nThe digital glasses would connect to the wearer’s iPhone, and the glasses would be able to display information in the user’s field of view. This is the same idea we’ve seen from companies like Google, and even more recently with Snap’s Spectacles product, which just recently launched and has seen a bevy of positive feedback ever since. \nTim Cook sees augmented reality as a way to expand a user’s capabilities, while at the same time not restricting their interaction with other human beings, something that is important to Apple. These digital glasses are far from official, but considering the lengths that Cook has gone to promote AR, it would certainly make sense.",

      "text": "Apple Reportedly Mulling Move Into AR Smart Glasses Apple reportedly is exploring creating smart glasses, likely using AR, like the Microsoft HoloLens. (Microsoft) Reprints \nApple is exploring the idea of creating digital glasses that show information in the wearer's field of vision, Bloomberg reported late Monday, citing sources. \nThe device would wirelessly connect to an iPhone, Bloomberg said , which stressed that Apple may not enter the field. \nApple has ordered some related components, but not enough to suggest mass production is near. \nAlphabet ( GOOGL ) unit Google introduced the Google Glass to much hype in 2012, but they never took off amid privacy concerns and aesthetic drawbacks. Apple, which has always made design a key focus, presumably would work to make any smart glasses look cool. \nApple smart glasses could use augmented reality, something Tim Cook has touted multiple times in recent months, largely downplayed the likelihood of Apple getting into virtual reality. \nFacebook ( FB )has entered VR in a big way with its acquisition of Oculus. Oculus and Samsung have teamed up as well. Google itself recently released a VR handset to go with its new Pixel smartphones. \nMicrosoft ( MSFT ) has the highest-profile augmented reality device, the HoloLens. The HoloLens overlays images and information over a user's field of vision. \nApple still relies heavily on the iPhone for revenue. So far its Apple Watch is a nice product, though it may be undercutting fitness tracker maker Fitbit ( FIT ). \nBig-cap tech stocks are facing a grimmer reality on the stock market today . Apple fell 2.5% Monday, though it found support at the 200-day moving average. Alphabet and Facebook fell 2.4% and 3.3%, respectively, undercutting their 200-day lines. Microsoft slid 1.5% to 58.12, undercutting a 58.80 buy point once again and closing just below its 50-day line. \nRELATED:",

      "text": "Trump's tax plan could save Apple big bucks if it repatriates overseas cash holdings Trump's tax plan could save Apple big bucks if it repatriates overseas cash holdings Posted: Tags : Apple - Apple + On the campaign trail, Donald Trump attacked Apple for a number of different reasons. Early in the year, he tried to start a boycott of the company because of its refusal to unlock an iPhone that belonged to a deceased terrorist. He also complained that Apple was manufacturing its products using overseas labor. He called for a 35% import tax on products made by U.S. companies in other countries .Yet, Trump's proposed tax plan could actually help Apple save a ton of money if it becomes the law of the land. Thanks in great part to the iPhone, Apple currently has an astounding cash hoard of $237 billion. Close to $200 billion of that money is currently sitting in overseas bank vaults, collecting interest. A chart produced by Statista reveals that only $16.6 billion of Apple's cash holdings are in U.S. banks. Apple keeps its funds overseas so that the company isn't required to pay the top corporate tax rate of 35% in the U.S.This isn't unusual in the corporate world. Many pharmaceutical firms keep money in overseas banks, and other tech firms like Google also keep a large amount of cash overseas. All of these companies, including Apple, will be given a chance to bring home a large amount of money at a significant tax savings according to the President-Elect's web site. Funds repatriated back to the U.S. will be subject to a one time tax of 10% instead of the current 35%. \"The Trump Plan will lower the business tax rate from 35 percent to 15 percent, and eliminate the corporate alternative minimum tax. This rate is available to all businesses, both small and large, that want to retain the profits within the business. It will provide a deemed repatriation of corporate profits held offshore at a one-time tax rate of 10 percent.\"-Trump's Tax Plan We don't know how much money Apple would choose to bring back home if this Tax holiday becomes law. But considering that it would be a one-time break, we wouldn't be surprised if the tech titan wired at least half of its overseas cash holdings back home. \nThe vast majority of Apple's cash is held overseas",

      "text": "share Apple is working on a wearable device similar to Google Glass that would blend an augmented reality display with a standard pair of glasses, according to a report from Bloomberg News . The company is still exploring the smart glasses market, the report states, so it’s unclear when a finished product will materialize. The earliest time frame for a product reveal is 2018, yet Apple could sit on the project for much longer or change its direction as it has with its automotive ambitions . Apple is exploring both AR and VR It’s been well known for months now that Apple has been collecting AR talent and putting minds to work in secret on some type of consumer product. CEO Tim Cook has repeatedly answered AR-related questions on quarterly earnings calls , saying he thinks the technology has more potential than its virtual reality counterpart and coyly hinting at Apple’s plans to enter the space. However, as of September of this year, Apple continues to hire both AR and VR experts , leaving open the possibility that it could develop products in both categories. According to Bloomberg , Apple has already had talks with potential suppliers for components like near-eye displays. It also has the expertise behind companies like PrimeSense, Metaio, and Flyby, all startups that were focused on AR software, 3D mapping, and computer vision before Apple acquired them over the course of the last three years. The goal is to develop a pair of glasses that could connect wirelessly to an iPhone and overlay information on the wearer’s field of vision. Apple has acquired a number of startups specializing in AR software AR is not without its hurdles. Google Glass was a massive flop, giving AR a sour public image and showing just how far the technology needs to go before it can be worn on our face. The most capable headset available to the public right now is the developer version of Microsoft’s HoloLens, which costs $3,000. Another startup, Magic Leap, continues to work in secret on AR technology it will not discuss in detail. Meanwhile, the rest of the tech community has turned its focus to VR. Google has its Daydream platform and new View headsets , while Facebook-owned Oculus VR and Samsung are working on all manner of high-end and mobile headsets. It’s unclear where Apple will fall on the spectrum, but Cook remains bullish on AR. “There are some really hard technology challenges there, but it will happen in a big way, and we will wonder when it does, how we ever lived without it,” he said of AR last month .",

      "text": "Share By Noel Randewich SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Apple's (AAPL.O) stock extended recent losses on Monday after a warning that iPhone sales could suffer if President-elect Donald Trump follows through on campaign threats to impose new tariffs on China. Apple is among several major technology stocks, including Amazon.com (AMZN.O), Facebook (FB.O) and Alphabet (GOOGL.O), selling off since Tuesday's election as investors shift funds into financial and public works companies seen benefiting from deregulation and infrastructure spending under President-elect Trump. In a continuation of that trend, the Cupertino, California company's stock fell 2.5 percent on Monday, bringing its loss since Tuesday's election to almost 5 percent, compared to the S&P 500's (.SPX) 1.16 percent advance. Adding to concern for Apple investors, an op-ed published in the China government-backed Global Times on Sunday warned of \"tit-for-tat\" retaliation should Trump follow through on a campaign pledge to impose 45-percent tariffs on all imports from China. \"A batch of Boeing (BA.N) orders will be replaced by Airbus. US auto and iPhone sales in China will suffer a setback, and US soybean and maize imports will be halted,\" the op-ed said. China has already become a disappointment for Apple, failing to deliver rapid growth that the company hoped would make up for slower iPhone sales in the United States and other mature markets. Revenue from China slumped 30 percent in Apple's September quarter, worse than the Americas' 7 percent decline. Apple's China sales could be hurt by potential trade conflicts as well as the country's weakening currency, said Rosenblatt Securities analyst Jun Zhang by email. He said he believes China iPhone sales fell in October, even after fixing supply issues affecting the iPhone 7 Plus. Synovus Trust Company Senior Portfolio Manager Daniel Morgan, who owns $33 million worth of Apple shares, warned not to read too much into Trump's campaign trail threats against China, at least in the near term. \"You just don't just jump in and start rewriting trade agreements,\" Morgan said.

      "text": "President-elect Donald Trump’s threats against China and its policies could ultimately hurt Apple , the Chinese government said on Monday.\nThe Global Times, a state-run news agency in China, on Monday issued its strongest rebuke of Trump and his policies, saying that if he “wrecks Sino-U.S. trade,” several U.S. industries could be “impaired.” The news outlet, which called Trump “naive,” signaled Apple’s AAPL iPhone sales could be targeted by the Chinese government.\n“China will take a tit-for-tat approach then,” the Global Times threatens in its editorial. “A batch of Boeing orders will be replaced by Airbus. U.S. auto and iPhone sales in China will suffer a setback, and U.S. soybean and maize imports will be halted. China can also limit the number of Chinese students studying in the U.S.”\nTrump was one of the most outspoken critics of trade with China during the protracted Presidential campaign. He said on numerous occasions that China was acting unfairly in its trade dealings with the U.S. and said he would label the government as a “currency manipulator” when he becomes President. Trump said earlier this year that he could impose expensive tariffs on Chinese imports and has called the Chinese government the world’s biggest thief.\nGet Data Sheet , Fortune’s technology newsletter\nWhile China has not said that it will definitely engage in activities that could hurt American companies, there’s little stopping it from doing so. China, after all, has an iron-like grip on the trade in its country and has banned several American companies from its borders, including Google , Facebook, and others. Limiting sales on iPhones, then, wouldn’t be much of a stretch.\nFor affected companies, China trouble could be disconcerting. The country has a massive middle class that’s anxiously demanding the latest and greatest products. American companies have generated massive sums of revenue in the country despite trade regulations and continue to believe China will be critical to their growth and profit in the future.\nApple, one of the companies China cited in its editorial on Monday, last quarter generated nearly $9 billion in revenue in the country. While that figure was down 30% year-over-year , during an earnings call with investors and analysts, CEO Tim Cook said he believes China will continue to play an integral role in his company’s operation in the coming years.\nAmerican presidents have for years criticized China for some of its trade policies, but none have gone so far as to impose the expensive tariff on the country’s goods Trump has floated. Trump, though, has said that he would be acting in the best interests of the American people by taking a tougher stance against China.\nFor more about Apple’s iPhone 7, watch:\nThere has been some debate over how much influence a President Trump could actually have over trade between the countries. Even the Global Times acknowledged that in its editorial, saying that even a President Trump “can exert limited influence” on what it believes is a mutually beneficial and “win-win” relationship for both countries.\nStill, the Global Times ends its editorial with a prediction on how Trump could be viewed if he engages in a trade war with China, questioning if the U.S. media is attempting to bait Trump into a mistake.\n“The new president will be condemned for his recklessness, ignorance and incompetence and bear all the consequences,” the Global Times predicts, adding it’s “very suspicious the trade war scenario is a trap set up by some American media to trip up the new president.”",

      "text": "Apple Pay expands to charities, Samsung Pay to offer rewards Updated 5 hrs ago ( … ) \nNEW YORK (AP) — Apple is making it easier for people to give to charities by expanding its Apple Pay payments service to nonprofits. \nApple Pay is mostly known for enabling purchases at retail stores with the tap of an iPhone, although the service can also be used for online transactions on apps and websites. Apple had limited this to buying goods and services — until now. \nThe American Red Cross, United Way and 18 other nonprofits will accept Apple Pay starting Monday. Others are coming soon. \nApple Pay can speed transactions because people don't have to re-enter card and contact information, though people need to enable the service first. Apple says that websites and apps accepting Apple Pay report seeing twice as many people complete transactions, compared with other payment methods. \nSeparately, Samsung says a payment service on its phones, Samsung Pay, will start offering points for each transaction, regardless of the amount spent. They will be redeemable for gift cards and Samsung products. \nAmericans are just starting to warm up to mobile payment services such as Apple Pay and Samsung Pay. One of the chief hurdles is the fact that for in-store transactions, it's not that difficult to pull out a plastic card to pay. And many merchants still do not accept such mobile payments. Although usage is growing, mobile payments are still a small portion of overall sales. Tags",

      "text": "(Reuters) – Apple is considering expanding into wearable glass headsets and has talked about the project with potential suppliers, Bloomberg reported citing people familiar with the matter.\nThe wearable headset would show images, along with other information and may use augmented reality, according to the report.\nChief executive Tim Cook, who has been struggling with a slowdown in iPhone sales in recent quarters, said earlier this year that the company would continue to invest a lot into augmented reality.\nApple, the world’s largest technology company, has ordered a small number of near-eye displays for testing but has not obtained enough for production on a larger scale, the report added.\nApple declined to comment.\nThe move would make Apple the latest tech company to venture into wearable glasses.\nAlphabet discontinued its own wearable glass headset, Google Glass, and closed the social media account linked to the device earlier this year, ending its attempt to popularize the expensive devices with consumers.\nThe device received plenty of attention when it was launched in 2012, but quickly ran into problems with its awkward appearance and privacy concerns over video recording.\nSnap, an $18 billion company which makes the popular messaging app Snapchat, also launched its own video-camera sunglasses last week.\n(Reporting by Narottam Medhora in Bengaluru; Editing by Bernard Orr)\nGet more stories like this on Twitter & Facebook ",

(NASDAQ: BLKB), the world's leading cloud software company powering social good, announced today it has added Apple Pay® to Blackbaud Merchant Services™ so its nonprofit customers can offer donors an easy, secure and private option for digital checkout, just in time for holiday giving.\nThis news comes in conjunction with Apple's announcement that Apple Pay now supports charitable donations, and now Blackbaud has made Apple Pay available as part of its integrated digital payments solution, which already services tens of millions of users for charitable giving.\nBlackbaud Merchant Services is an end-to-end payment processing solution designed exclusively for nonprofits. The addition of Apple Pay as a new checkout option within Blackbaud's solution allows nonprofits to offer their donors an easy and secure way to pay -- all within the secure, simple and affordable donation processing system they have come to rely on from Blackbaud.\n\"At Blackbaud, we're innovating to power every moment that helps nonprofits better understand and engage supporters,\" said Kevin McDearis , chief products officer at Blackbaud. \"This also means building solutions that create frictionless, integrated and secure experiences across devices and platforms to support the work of philanthropy-from cultivation, to fundraising, donation processing and more. Integrating Apple Pay into our digital payments solution is a great example of how we're working to help nonprofits provide their donors with a modern, agile checkout experience that mirrors the convenience and mobility they enjoy as consumers.\"\nMany well-known charities using Blackbaud Merchant Services are already live today with Apple Pay, including American Heart Association, Crohn's & Colitis Foundation of America (CCFA), Feeding America, The Nature Conservancy, WNET and World Wildlife Fund (WWF).\n\"Donor behavior is constantly changing and we want to be able to quickly respond to those changes. Apple Pay lets Feeding America offer our donors a checkout experience that is as easy and fast as the best e-commerce experiences,\" said Liz Nielsen , senior vice president of Direct Marketing & Digital Engagement at Feeding America. \"It is critical that we stay on the front-end of mobile technology if we want to continue to grow support for Feeding America and ultimately get more food to more people facing hunger in our country.\"\nNonprofits have signaled that offering Apple Pay as an option for donors will increase conversion rates from mobile and website visitors, simplify the donation process and reduce the information required for donors to give; potentially even increasing donation frequency as a result.\n\"We are excited to be among the first nonprofit organizations to offer the ability to donate with Apple Pay,\" said Michael Osso , president and CEO of Crohn's & Colitis Foundation of America. \"CCFA has always been on the forefront of technology to ensure a smooth donor experience. Offering fast and convenient technology that enhances our ability to raise crucial funds, especially during the end-of-year giving season, will help us deliver on our mission to improve the lives of patients with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis.\"\nDavid Glass , senior director of online marketing for World Wildlife Fund added, \"Giving donors new and simple ways to contribute to World Wildlife Fund's mission to protect the future of nature is critical to our work.\"\nApple Pay is available today for organizations using Blackbaud Merchant Services to process donations in Luminate Online™. In 2017, Blackbaud will expand Apple Pay functionality across the portfolio.\nFor more information, visit www.blackbaud.com/apple-pay .\nAbout Blackbaud\nBlackbaud (NASDAQ: BLKB) is the world's leading cloud software company powering social good.

      "text": "Apple’s Next Wearable Could Be A Pair Of Smart Glasses  35 PST \nSmart glasses aren’t exactly new in terms of technology. We’ve seen Google attempt it with Google Glass, Snapchat with Spectacles , and Microsoft with HoloLens, although that seems more of a headset than smart glasses. Now it seems that there is a possibility that we can add Apple to that list. \nAccording to a report from Bloomberg , it seems that they have heard from their sources that Apple could be considering a new wearable device that comes in the form of smart glasses. Before you get too excited, Bloomberg notes that at the moment this seems to be more in its exploratory phase rather than developmental, meaning that Apple is still exploring the idea and fleshing it out as opposed to actually working on it. \nThe idea is that the device would connect to the iPhone and will rely on augmented reality technology to project images onto the lens. Given that Apple’s CEO has constantly sung the praises of the technology , going as far as saying it could be part of our daily lives , the choice of going AR instead of VR makes sense. \nApple is also said to have placed small orders of near-eye displays from one of their suppliers, but like we said, it is still exploratory. Will Apple push ahead with this project? We guess that remains to be seen, but so far none of the smart glasses that have been launched have been particularly successful, so color us skeptical until then. \nFiled in Apple > Gadgets > Rumors .

      "text": "Search Northrop Grumman, Realogy Holdings, Alibaba, Nike and Apple highlighted as Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day November 14, 2016, 09:30:00 AM EDT By Zacks Equity Research, Zacks.com Shutterstock photo \nFor Immediate Release \nChicago, IL - November 14, 2016 - Zacks Equity Research highlights Northrop Grumman (NYSE: NOC - Free Report ) as the Bull of the Day and Realogy Holdings (NYSE: RLGY - Free Report ) as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Alibaba (NYSE: BABA - Free Report ) , Nike Inc. (NYSE: NKE - Free Report ) and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL - Free Report ). \nHere is a synopsis of all five stocks: \nBull of the Day : \nWith Trump's stunning victory, investors are quickly reallocating their portfolios to prepare for a Republican president, and a Republican-controlled Congress as well. While there are a number of areas that look to benefit from this political situation, one that may do especially well is the defense market. \nThis corner of the economy could benefit from a massive surge in defense spending, as some believe that Trump will look to spend somewhere near $500 billion more on defense , pushing total U.S. defense spending near the one trillion dollar mark. As you might be able to guess, this huge increase is being viewed favorably by the defense stocks, and we have seen several of these surge following Trump's win. Plus, the industry rank here is in the top 20% overall, so there is plenty to like in terms of investment choices. \nOne that might be worth a closer look by investors though, is Northrop Grumman (NYSE: NOC - Free Report ). This company was recently upgraded into Zacks Rank #1 (strong buy) territory while it could be a prime beneficiary of the Trump defense spending surge. \nOther Factors \nBut beyond Trump, analysts also seem to like NOC's prospects, as we saw a number of analysts raise their earnings estimates on NOC shares, and that was before the election took place. In fact, analysts were already baking in a year-over-year earnings growth rate of 27% for Northrop, and that is before considering Trump's huge spending surge. \nBut before worrying about these lofty expectations, investors should consider that NOC does a great job in earnings season, and that it has a great history of beating estimates. This includes four straight beats of at least four percent, and only two misses in the past five years. \nBear of the Day : \nIn the wake of Trump's surprising victory, investors have seen incredible volatility in a number of market sectors. One area that has been on the move more than others is the world of real estate. \nThat is because interest rates are soaring in anticipation of some inflationary policies from Trump (including a burst of new spending), while some think that foreign holders of Treasury bonds may be reducing their positions as well. Either way, this has pushed the 10-year yield to within striking distance of its 52 week high, hurting the appeal of housing and real estate markets in the process. \nWhile this has obviously hit companies in the high dividend area of the real estate world, those in the services side of the market could also be impacted. Lower home sales or a more difficult housing market could definitely impact companies like Realogy Holdings (NYSE: RLGY - Free Report ) and force these companies lower in the process. \nRLGY in Focus \nRLGY provides real estate and relocation services across the globe. This is done via a number of real estate brands, including pretty well-known ones such as Century 21, Coldwell Banker, and Sotheby's International Realty to name a few. \nThe company could be under pressure if the housing market faces turmoil in the near term, while the sector outlook isn't much better, including a bottom 25% industry rank. But it isn't just the jarring industry outlook that is a problem for RLGY, as the company's   report also brought up some big questions. \nRecent Earnings \nIn the latest report, RLGY missed earnings estimates for the second time in a row, posting 74 cents a share in earnings compared to expectations of 76 cents per share. Additionally, the most recent estimates for RLGY earnings have come in below previous expectations, as we have seen two estimates go lower for the current quarter in the past week, and one lower for the full year time frame too. \nIn fact, if we look at the most accurate estimate and compare it to the consensus from 30 days ago, the current quarter expectations have fallen by over 25%, while the full year and next year periods have also trended lower. Clearly, analysts aren't big believers in RLGY's near term potential, and it is hard to blame them considering the macro forces at play as well. \nAdditional content: \nAlibaba's 'Singles Day' Posts Record Sales of $178 Billion \nOn Friday, China's e-commerce king Alibaba (NYSE: BABA - Free Report ) held its annual Singles' Day shopping event, posting record sales of $17.8 billion worth of gross merchandise volume (GMV) and soaring past last year's results of $14.3 billion. This figure was easily beaten in Chinese Yuan before 3:30pm. \nBack in the 1990s, Singles' Day was first celebrated by young, single Chinese people as a pushback against Valentine's Day. Now, it's become one of the country's biggest shopping events. Alibaba began to capitalize on the \"holiday\" in 2009, promoting discounts at certain retailers on its various digital platforms; the company uses Singles' Day as a way to boost its revenues in the typically slow sales period before the Lunar New Year season. \nThis year, Alibaba said that deals offered by athletic giants Nike Inc. (NYSE: NKE - Free Report ), iPhone maker Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL - Free Report ), industrial automation company Siemens AG and fast fashion retailer Uniqlo. Many international brands have jumped on the holiday over recent years. According to CNBC , 14,000 brands took part of 2016 Singles' Say, making up roughly 30% of total GMV just half-way into the shopping event. Big Chinese brands like appliance manufacturers Haier and Midea and smartphone maker Meizu also reported strong profits in the event. \nPopular celebrities made appearances at the four-hour \"countdown event\" in Shenzhen this year, including actress Scarlett Johansson, David Beckham and his wife, fashion designer Victoria Beckham, Kobe Bryant, and live music from OneRepublic. Even Alibaba CEO Jack Ma showed up and performed a magic trick on stage, along with promotional spots for the new Alibaba Pictures' latest film production. \nFor some perspective on how big of a sale Singles' Day is, 2015's Black Friday, the annual day-after-Thanksgiving sale here in the U.S., only reached $4.5 billion in GMV; Cyber Monday, the annual Monday-after-Thanksgiving e-commerce sale event, only saw a record $3 billion last year, or pocket change compared to what Singles' Day brings in. \n\"Jack Ma likes to say that they're no longer an e-commerce company. They're sort of transcending that,\" said Duncan Clark, chairman and MD of the business advisory BDA China, to CNBC 's \"Squawk Box\" on Friday. \"It's about data, it's about finance, it's about media.\" This is very similar to how Amazon has evolved over the years, turning into not just the biggest e-commerce platform in the U.S., but also a top video streaming choice for many consumers through its Prime membership. \nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

      "text": "Apple’s Phil Schiller Thinks A Touchscreen iMac Would Be ‘Absurd’  33 PST \nWith there being so many touchscreen laptops and desktops out there today, safe to say many surprised that Apple chose to go with something of an in-between with the Touch Bar on the new MacBook Pros . So does that mean we’ll never see a full touchscreen Mac computer? Probably not because according to Apple’s SVP of Marketing, Phil Schiller, it would be absurd. \nSpeaking in an interview with Backchannel , he was quoted as saying, “We think of the whole platform. If we were to do Multi-Touch on the screen of the notebook, that wouldn’t be enough — then the desktop wouldn’t work that way. Can you imagine a 27-inch iMac where you have to reach over the air to try to touch and do things? That becomes absurd.” \nHe goes on to say that it would be impossible to optimize for both touch and other input devices, like a mouse. Schiller said, “You can’t optimize for both. It’s the lowest common denominator thinking.” To a certain extent he is right because as you can tell, websites and apps designed for mobile tend to feature larger buttons for touch, whereas apps for desktops are designed to fill larger displays. \nPerhaps one day someone could come up with a happy middle, but for now don’t expect Apple to embrace full touchscreen computers just yet. This isn’t the first time that the company has shot down the idea , so maybe don’t hold your breath just yet. \nFiled in Apple > Computers . Read more about iMac . Related Articles",

(http://bloom.bg/2fAjdFm)\nChief Executive Tim Cook, who has been struggling with a slowdown in iPhone sales in recent quarters, said earlier this year that the company would continue to invest a lot into augmented reality.\nApple, the world's largest technology company, has ordered a small number of near-eye displays for testing but has not obtained enough for production on a larger scale, the report added.\nApple declined to comment.\nThe move would make Apple the latest tech company to venture into wearable glasses.\nAlphabet Inc's discontinued its own wearable glass headset, Google Glass, and closed the social media account linked to the device earlier this year, ending its attempt to popularize the expensive devices with consumers.\nThe device received plenty of attention when it was launched in 2012, but quickly ran into problems with its awkward appearance and privacy concerns over video recording.\nSnap, an $18 billion company which makes the popular messaging app Snapchat, also launched its own video-camera sunglasses last week.\n(Reporting by Narottam Medhora in Bengaluru; Editing by Bernard Orr)\nRead the original article on Reuters .

      "title": "iPhone 6 iOS 10.1.1 Update: 9 Things to Know After Two Weeks",
      "text": "Its been two weeks since Apple replaced iOS 10.1 with iOS 10.1.1. With that in mind, we want to take a look at the most important things you need to know about the iPhone 6 iOS 10.1.1 update as we push toward the next big iOS 10 release.\nIn September, Apple confirmed an iOS 10 release date for the iPhone 6 and its other iOS 9 powered devices and on September 13th the company pushed the iOS 10 update to iPhone 6 models around the globe.\nAdvertisement\niOS 10 delivered new features and enhancements but it also brought problems to the iPhone 6 and Apple’s other mobile devices.\nIn an effort to clean up iOS 10, the company’s released several bug fix updates for the iPhone 6 and its other iOS 10-powered devices. The latest is iOS 10.1.1, a small update that brings a key fix to the former flagship smartphone.\nThe iPhone 6 iOS 10.1.1 update is a tiny update if you’re coming directly from iOS 10.1. If you’re coming to iOS 10.1.1 from iOS 9 or iOS 8, it’ll be much larger due to iOS 10.1 and iOS 10. The features from Apple’s previous iOS 10 updates are baked in.\nAdvertisement\nWith the smoke from the iOS 10.1.1 release nice and settled we want to take a look at the most important things iPhone 6 owners need to know about the iOS 10.1.1 update.\nThis roundup offers a quick iPhone 6 iOS 10.1.1 review, details about the iOS 10 downgrade, a look at some of the problems plaguing the iPhone 6 after iOS 10.1.1, and a whole lot more.\nCheck back for regular updates as we make our way into the month.\niPhone 6 iOS 10.1.1 Update Review: Two Weeks Later 1 / 9 Apple's iPhone 6 iOS 10.1.1 update is small if you're coming to it from iOS 10.1. It took us about seven minutes to download and install.\nAdvertisement\nIf you're coming from something older than iOS 10.1 you'll want to give yourself a little more time to get the installation done. Your update will, again, be much larger.\nWe've been using the iPhone 6 iOS 10.1.1 update for two weeks and we've been keeping a close eye on key areas like battery life, connectivity, and UI speed. Here's what we've found during our time with the latest version of iOS 10.\nWe haven't noticed any major problems with iPhone 6 battery life with the iOS 10.1.1 update on board. The device continues to hold an excellent charge at the two week mark.\nIf you're seeing battery drain issues and you recently installed iOS 10.1.1, give it a couple of days to settle. If it fails to settle after a couple of days with iOS 10.1.1 installed, you'll want to try some manual fixes for battery life problems.\nWe've tested the phone and its update with several ISPs, routers, and Bluetooth devices and we've come away impressed. We haven't noticed any major problems or dropped connections. AT&T LTE/4G continues to perform at a high level as well.\nThe iPhone 6 is still extremely fast with iOS 10.1.1 on board. The operating system still feels much faster than iOS 9. Animations and transitions are incredibly fluid and we haven't experienced any lag in problem areas like Control Center and the Notifications tray.\nThe iOS 10.1.1 update is treating our iPhone 6 well at the two week milestone. We recommend it for most iOS 10 users.\nThat said, you'll want to seek out a second or third opinion before you make your move. This is especially important if you're coming from iOS 9.3.5 or below. You can't go back to iOS 9 once you make the move to iOS 10.\n1 / 9",

      "text": "View Comments Pic: Reuters SAN FRANCISCO : Apple's stock extended recent losses on Monday after a warning that iPhone sales could suffer if President-elect Donald Trump follows through on campaign threats to impose new tariffs on China. Apple is among several major technology stocks, including Amazon.com, Facebook and Alphabet, selling off since Tuesday's election as investors shift funds into financial and public works companies seen benefiting from deregulation and infrastructure spending under President-elect Trump. In a continuation of that trend, the Cupertino, California company's stock fell 2.5 percent on Monday, bringing its loss since Tuesday's election to almost 5 percent, compared to the S&P 500's .SPX 1.16 percent advance. Adding to concern for Apple investors, an op-ed published in the China government-backed Global Times on Sunday warned of \"tit-for-tat\" retaliation should Trump follow through on a campaign pledge to impose 45-percent tariffs on all imports from China. \"A batch of Boeing orders will be replaced by Airbus. US auto and iPhone sales in China will suffer a setback, and US soybean and maize imports will be halted,\" the op-ed said. China has already become a disappointment for Apple, failing to deliver rapid growth that the company hoped would make up for slower iPhone sales in the United States and other mature markets. Revenue from China slumped 30 percent in Apple's September quarter, worse than the Americas' 7 percent decline. Apple's China sales could be hurt by potential trade conflicts as well as the country's weakening currency, said Rosenblatt Securities analyst Jun Zhang by email. He said he believes China iPhone sales fell in October, even after fixing supply issues affecting the iPhone 7 Plus. Synovus Trust Company Senior Portfolio Manager Daniel Morgan, who owns $33 million worth of Apple shares, warned not to read too much into Trump's campaign trail threats against China, at least in the near term. \"You just don't just jump in and start rewriting trade agreements,\" Morgan said. -Reuters",

Apple is Reportedly Testing a Google Glass-Like Wearable Device The glasses would arrive in 2018 at the earliest by Brent Dirks November 15, 2016 \nAre you ready for Apple Glass? According to a new report from Bloomberg , Apple is reportedly testing a pair of augmented reality glasses that sync to an iPhone. A push into AR A push into AR \nRemember Google Glass? \nThe device is in early testing and wouldn’t arrive before 2018 at the earliest. Here’s more from the report: \nWhile still in an exploration phase, the device would connect wirelessly to iPhones, show images and other information in the wearer’s field of vision, and may use augmented reality, the people said. They asked not to be identified speaking about a secret project. \nApple has talked about its glasses project with potential suppliers, according to people familiar with those discussions. The company has ordered small quantities of near-eye displays from one supplier for testing, the people said. Apple hasn’t ordered enough components so far to indicate imminent mass-production, one of the people added. \nThe pictured Google Glass turned into a major flop for Apple’s competitor over major privacy and usability concerns. Time for a reality check? \nDoes Pokémon Go's popularity show that AR is here to stay? \nBoth augmented and virtual reality technology has continued to move into the mainstream in 2016. \nApple CEO Tim Cook has previously stated a preference for augmented reality technology that overlays information over what’s currently happening around a user. On the other hand, virtual reality provides a completely new environment for users. \nA great example of the technology is the smash hit Pokémon Go that landed this summer. Using an iPhone, players catch and train different AR Pokémon that appear on screen and at different locations. \nIt’s become the most popular mobile game ever. \nWhile I’m still skeptical about AR and VR technology, the rumored device sure sounds more exciting (and practical) than an Apple Car. \nThe hit AR game",
