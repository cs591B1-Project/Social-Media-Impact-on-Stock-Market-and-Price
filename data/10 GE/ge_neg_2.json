      "text": "More from Deborah Yedlin, Calgary Herald Published on: November 10, 2016 | Last Updated: November 11, 2016 7:42 PM MST \nGE Canada president and CEO Elyse Allan was named the Energy Council of Canada's Energy Person of the Year on Thursday. Colleen De Neve / Calgary Herald Share Adjust Comment Print \nThe Energy Council of Canada’s selection of Elyse Allan as its energy person of the year sent a powerful message about the organization focus on the sector’s future and path forward. \n“It’s meant to be a forward-looking award, recognizing the contribution of the recipients to the energy sector, the economic future of our country, but also in the context of how they are mentoring the next generation and their philanthropic commitment to society,” said council chairman Colin Anderson. \nAllan, the president and CEO of GE Canada, accepted the award Thursday night in Toronto. She is only the second woman the council has named its Energy Person of the Year. The first was former politician and Inuvialuit Regional Corporation chair Nellie Cournoyea, in 2004. \nA passionate and inspired advocate for innovation in energy, Allan is also committed to the community at large as a director with many not-for-profit organizations. She also gives her time to the advisory board of the Ecofiscal Commission and is part of the federal government’s Advisory Council on Economic Growth. \nAllan is determined to see GE continue to apply the mindset and discipline of innovation — a hallmark of the 124-year-old company’s success — to the energy sector by working with players across the spectrum, from oil and gas to electricity and renewables. \nThe company’s merger with Baker Hughes means it can marry the old industrial age — typified by oilfield services — with the new, like the Internet of things. The economic potential of GE applying its digital and technological expertise to an oilfield services giant is massive, and also constitutes a big, bullish bet on the future of energy. \nFor Allan, the answer to making progress on difficult challenges lies in collaboration, as demonstrated by her acceptance of the Energy Council award — on behalf of the GE team, she said — on Thursday. \n“It’s wonderful to be recognized but its equally important to share that recognition with a great team that I have the opportunity to work with and learn from, every day,” Allan said in an interview. \nWhether it’s about decreasing emissions from the extraction process, using less water, finding better methods to detect pipeline leaks or applying data analytics to increase efficiency, productivity and profitability, the end game is to increase competitiveness at every level. And decrease the endless criticism of the energy sector. \nIt’s a key reason GE Canada was first to sign up as a supplier to the Canadian Oil Sands Innovation Alliance (COSIA), the organization formed by industry in 2012 to share technologies and improve environmental performance. \nEnvironmental performance and operational excellence are not mutually exclusive. \nAllan, like Cenvous CEO Brian Ferguson, believes the goal of an emissions-free barrel from the oilsands can be achieved. She sees Canada’s role as an energy superpower through its leadership on innovation, not production capacity. \nAllan is energized by the challenge of cracking the environmental nut, and, in her words, making sure carbon pricing ultimately forces the energy sector to be more competitive by investing in and adopting new technologies, systems and processes. \nShe is equally committed to ensuring the next generation has the skill set to become meaningful participants in an ever-changing economy. \nThat means supporting not-for-profit organizations such as Actua, which works with engineering schools in Canada to offer outreach programs in science, technology, engineering and math in places such as Nunavut and on First Nations reserves. \nThe fact not enough women are rising through the ranks and cracking the glass ceiling — highlighted by Tuesday’s U.S. election results — rankles Allan, who is committed to fostering in girls an interest in science and math at younger ages. \nThat way, she says, we can create a critical mass of women ready to enter engineering. \n“We need to have a robust pipeline coming through the system, not just in sixth grade but sticking to it in ninth grade and continuing to university,” said Allan. “The energy sector is an exciting and complex industry and I don’t know that we showcase it enough and tell that story enough to build that pipeline.” \nEnergy companies can also do better. \n“We have to have leadership that builds a culture committed to diversity at the table. Appreciating diversity of opinion, the debate around an idea leads to a more robust solution and drives more creativity,” she said. \n“The leadership is responsible for setting a table where ideas and different perspectives and voices can be heard. I think we have to look to ourselves and ask if we are doing all we can to set that table.” \nOne variable to solving that challenge, Allan suggested, lies in changing the energy dialogue and being more innovative in terms of how industry communicates with — and educates — the public. \n“The nature of how messages are communicated and received has changed dramatically and we have to be totally on top of that, if not leading it,” she said. \nDone right, it has the potential of turning protests into support. Ask a millenial if they’re interested in helping rid the world of energy poverty, where 1.2 billion people don’t have access to energy, and the chances of shifting both perception and dialogue are very good. \nEither way, as Allan said Thursday night, the energy sector doesn’t have a generation to figure things out about how to accelerate the development and application of technology. \nThat means striking down many barriers – and quickly. It means ensuring diversity in the leadership ranks and around boardroom tables and fostering corporate cultures that are enthusiastic about innovation, eager to develop and adopt new practices and technologies. \nAll these elements, as Allan suggested, are ‘must haves’ in today’s competitive energy world, where driving the cost and emissions per barrel through the application of innovation are not negotiable. \nTo cast it a bit differently, it’s about industry having the right coach to make sure it’s skating to where the puck is going. \nAllan might be the Energy Person of the Year, but given her leadership and indefatigable commitment to innovation, ‘coach’ is also appropriate. \nDeborah Yedlin is a Calgary Herald columnist \ndyedlin@postmedia. com ",

      "text": "Peter Lynch Chart of GE Though the number of insider trades of GE remained the same from 2014 to 2015, the volume of insider buys grew from 168,900 to 883,500. There was also a decrease in insider sells of GE from 19 transactions totaling 2,299,733 shares to no insider sells the following year. This may be in part due to the merging of General Electric Capital Corp. into General Electric Co. in 2015, as GE Capital Equity Investments ( Insider Trades ) sold 100% of all insider shares sold in 2014. Immelt purchased a total of 312,500 shares of the company since 2013 and 167,600 shares in 2016 to date. Immelt's earliest insider purchase with GE, 40,000 shares at an average price of $25.04 per share, increased in value by about 20% since then. For more information about insider trades with GE, click here . For the three months ended Sept. 30, the company reported total revenue of $29.266 billion. This is a 4% increase from the company's reported total revenue of $28.03 billion in the third quarter of the previous year. Despite the increase in revenue when comparing the third quarter of 2015 to 2016, net earnings for the same period of time decreased by about 20%, from $2.506 billion, to $1.994 billion. This equates to diluted earnings per share of 19 cents and 23 cents for the third quarters of 2015 and 2016, respectively. Dividends per common share remained the same for both quarters. On Nov. 10, GE announced that its agreement with Clarke Energy, an authorized distributor of GE's Jenbacher gas and diesel engines, will connect more than 700 assets globally to GE's myPlant Asset Performance Management (APM) solution. Anthony Hayes, group IT director at Clarke Energy, commented that Clarke has \"good reason to advance its use of GE's myPlant Asset Performance Management solution,\" because the engineers at Clarke are \"automatically notified about unscheduled generator stops at customer sites... via text message or email.\" This allows the engineers to monitor and diagnose problems, and ultimately solve issues with a decreased need for manpower. According to GuruFocus information, General Electric Co. has a business predictability rank of 1 out of 5 stars. For more information about business predictability rank, click here . In the third quarter, John Hussman ( Trades , Portfolio) and Steven Romick (Trades, Portfolio) reduced their stakes in GE. Hussman sold all 400,000 shares of the company at an average per-share price of $31.13 after increasing his stake by 14.29% at an average per share price of $29.47 in the first quarter of 2016. The total estimated gain of the holding since the fourth quarter of 2015 is 5%. Romick sold 1,011,640 shares of the company during the third quarter of 2016, reducing his stake in the company by 12.01%. Romick reduced his stake each quarter since the first quarter of 2016. The total estimated gain of the holding since the first quarter of 2015 is 22%. For more information about guru trades with GE, click here.

      "text": "Engine: 2x Cummins HBI-600 Length: 33ft 5in* Each locomotive used two diesel engines. Each engine powered a single electric traction motor on one truck. \nPrototype History \nOne ton may not seem to make much of a difference on something as large as a diesel locomotive, but those 2,000 pounds made a world of difference between GE's 45 ton switcher and its also popular 44 ton model. \nComing in under the weight limit established in 1937 for single-operator status, the 44 Tonner became a popular choice with many railroads for light switching and even branchline duties. \nDespite the need for a fireman on the railroads, the 45 Tonner also found more than ample popularity with a variety of industries in North America and abroad and even a few railroads as well. \ncontinue reading below our video 5 Hobbies That Look Good on Your Resume \nSimilar in form to the 44 Tonner, and surprisingly slightly smaller in overall size, the 45 Tonner featured a center cab with low hoods on either side which each covered a 6 cylinder Cummins engine. (Like all industrial locomotives, there were variations including some end-cab 45 Tonners those these were very rare.) \nThe seats inside the cab for the engineer and fireman were raised an additional two feet, placed on top of cabinets used for the air brake equipment, providing the crew with better visibility for switching. A standard train line air brake system was an optional feature on the 45 Tonner. \nThe most distinctive spotting feature on the 45 Tonner was found on earlier production units. Each motor powered a single electric traction motor on each truck. On early units, the other axle was powered by a pair of siderods. The distinctive look of the siderods gave the 45 Tonner a lot of character. Later models used a chain drive inside the truck to accomplish the same purpose. \nSimple, easy to maintain, and powerful for their weight and size, the 45 Tonner found a home in many industries. The majority of purchases were for just a single unit, although several large industries purchased a single locomotive at multiple locations. \nCustomers included steel mills, military and government installations, cement plants, quarries, even a couple of universities. A handful were purchased by common carrier railroads as well. In addition to North American customers, GE exported 132 locomotives to Argentina, Belgium, Brazil, Chile, Cuba, Dominican Republic, Israel, Ivory Coast, Peru, Philippines, Portugal, South Africa, South Korea, United Kingdom, Uruguay and Venezuela. \nCommon to all industrial locomotives, the 45 Tonners changed hands frequently. Tracking their individual histories is a challenge. Many are still in industrial service today. Others are still at work or on static display at museums, tourist railroads and historic sites. \nOperating Railroads \nThe 45 Ton locomotives ran on an amazing variety of companies. Of 467 built, they went to nearly 400 different places! For a complete list of the original owners, see this roster . Many of these locomotives went on to serve other customers as well through mergers and sales. \nThanks to their proliferation, you would be hard pressed to find a model railroad that couldn't use one of these characteristic critters at an online industry. \nModels \nDespite larger sales and, arguably more visual interest than the 44 Tonner, the 45 Tonner has only seen limited production in model form. Undoubtedly the lack of well-known roadnames as owners has a lot to do with this. Still, a 45 Ton switcher would be perfect power for many small layouts or as an industrial switcher assigned to a big industry on a larger layout. \nLike any industrial engine, there are lots of opportunities to add detail parts to customize these models. Many wore colorful paint schemes, but with the nature of their work, heavy weathering is also always a reality. \nHO Scale: Bachmann Spectrum (see the product review ) O Scale: Yoder (On3)",

      "text": "model name / number: model 100   As you can see from the photos this is quite an antique air compressor. The GE motor that drives it is no spring chicken either ;-) Being constructed of cast iron and steel it is quite heavy. Cast in to the side it says: Made in USA & No. 100... unfortunately I do not see the name of the company that manufactured it anywhere on the unit. It has grease cups for the bottom end of the connecting rod and for both crankshaft journals. It works fine, and would be the perfect addition to a man cave or vintage garage. Asking $90 ... OBO Notes: 1) I am \"conveniently located\" very close to Park Road shopping center. 2) If you have a appointment time to come and inspect an item I will hold it for you until that time. If you are not going to be able to make the appointment please call and let me know. Thanks for looking! do NOT contact me with unsolicited services or offers post id: 5857430330",

      "text": "Dramatic GE engine explosion on Boeing 767 poses puzzle for investigators Industry experts say the cause of the incident was the first of its kind. By Dominic Gates Seattle Times November 13, 2016 — 2:00pm Purchase: Order Reprint The nearly catastrophic explosion of an engine that caused a fire on an American Airlines Boeing 767 just short of takeoff in Chicago on Oct. 28 occurred when a specific part that had never before failed broke into pieces. The breakup of a heavy metal disk that rotates in the engine core reveals a new risk to airline passengers that, however rare, has already spurred a scramble by engine-maker General Electric and government safety agencies to find and fix the vulnerability. \"The risk will be eliminated,\" said John Goglia, a former National Transportation Safety Board member with more than 40 years' experience in the aviation-safety industry. \"Will it be eliminated before the next one? That's the real question. Everything relies upon the timeliness of the system to correct itself.\" American Airlines Flight 383 to Miami was speeding down the runway at O'Hare International Airport in Chicago when the second-stage disk of the high-pressure turbine broke apart inside the right engine with a loud explosion that blew metal shrapnel out through the engine casing. Hot metal ripped through the wing, igniting aviation fuel. In an update this month, the National Safety Board, often called the NTSB, described how the pilot aborted the takeoff just seconds before reaching a speed at which he would have had to leave the ground. Slamming on the brakes as the jet reached a speed of 154 miles per hour, he brought the plane to a halt within 25 seconds and 900 yards further down the runway. Moving quickly, the cabin staff evacuated all 161 passengers and nine crew using the escape slides on the undamaged left side of the aircraft. Twenty people suffered minor injuries. Behind them on the runway, the black smoke billowing skyward and the blaze melting the right wing into a drooping mess testified to how close the passengers had come to a large-scale tragedy. GE spokesman Rick Kennedy stresses the reliability of the CF6 engine involved. The latest models, introduced in the 1980s, currently power about 4,000 widebody jets, including Boeing 767s, 747s and Airbus A330s, and have flown for more than 220 million hours. \"The CF6 is the workhorse engine of jumbo jets on a level never experienced before,\" Kennedy said. Yet the danger posed by a so-called \"uncontained engine failure\" cannot be overstated. The disk that broke apart in Chicago — one of two disks in what's called the high-pressure turbine that drives the engine's air compressor — is about 2 feet in diameter and weighs more than 100 pounds. At full power for takeoff, the temperature in the high-pressure turbine reaches more than 2,200 degrees. The pod around the engine has Kevlar armor around the big fan at the front, designed to contain any blades that fly off. But the pod cannot possibly contain the enormous energy of flying metal ejected from an engine-core breakup. The NTSB has said one piece of the broken disk went through the right wing, then arced high over the airplane and came crashing through the roof of a UPS warehouse almost 1,000 yards away. \"Any time a turbine disk fails, it's a big deal,\" Goglia said. In 2006, a CF6-80 engine — the same model as in the Chicago incident — on another American Airlines 767 that was powered up during maintenance, exploded on the ground in Los Angeles, with no passengers aboard. A big piece of the high-pressure turbine disk in the left engine pierced the engine casing, sliced through the airplane's lower fuselage and embedded itself like an ax-head in the casing of the right engine on the other side of the airplane. That jarring incident came after two other CF6-80 high-pressure turbine-disk breakups. In 2000, as a US Airways 767 was undergoing engine maintenance on the ground in Philadelphia, a disk rupture split the left engine clean in two and ignited a fire under the wing. In 2002, it happened while a jet was in the air. The left engine of an Air New Zealand 767 blew up six minutes after takeoff from Brisbane, Australia, damaging the wing flaps and forcing an emergency landing. Luckily, there was no fire that time, and all 200 people on board were safe. In all three of those CF6-80 incidents, the disk that broke up was the first of two inside the turbine. Although the two disks look alike, the first stage is next to the hottest part of the engine core and must withstand the highest temperatures and air pressure. After the 2006 incident, the government safety system kicked into high gear. The Federal Aviation Administration, or FAA, issued an Airworthiness Directive ordering urgent inspections of these disks inside older CF6-80 engines. Subsequently, GE redesigned the first-stage disk to take more stress, adjusting the shape and the composition of the sophisticated nickel alloy. All planes flying today have been retrofitted with that redesigned disk, Kennedy said. \"That's behind us,\" he said. But the disk that exploded in Chicago was the second-stage disk. This disk is subject to lower temperatures and air flow, so it undergoes relatively less stress than the first. \"There has never been an Airworthiness Directive associated with a second-stage disk,\" Kennedy said. \"This is new.\" That's what's raised alarm bells at the NTSB and the FAA. The NTSB said that particular disk had been flying for 18 years and completed almost 11,000 flights, short of the limit of 15,000 cycles after which it must be replaced. Goglia and other industry experts said the sudden breakup almost certainly stemmed from a microscopic crack, caused by a flaw in the metal invisible to the eye, that grew over years of service. Using electron microscopes, metallurgists at the NTSB Materials Laboratory in Washington, D.C., are now scanning the pieces of the broken stage-two disk, 95 percent of which was recovered. \"They'll examine the metal down to the tiniest element to determine the cause,\" said Goglia.",

      "text": "make / manufacturer: General Electric   For sale is a wonderful retro 1961 GE four burner range with double ovens in good working order. Fantastic retro range with a lot of chrome and lights! Rainbow colored burner control lights! Very much of the period. The burners and ovens are good working order. The thermostat is a little off, but then again the oven is 55 years old! We just used a hanging thermometer in the stove to guarantee temperature. Comes with an original booklet and plug-in meat thermometer. We remodeled our kitchen and this stove no longer fits. Great for your retro kitchen or for your camp! Asking $200 or best offer   5874760047",

Starbucks, General Electric and Pfizer are among the stocks discussed. Jim Cramer Nov14,20161:00AMEST \nJim Cramer shares his views every day on RealMoney. Click here for a real-time look at his insights and musings. \nCramer: We're Entering a World of Unknowns \nPosted at 4:13 p.m. EDT on Wednesday, Nov. 9, 2016 \nFar be it from me to throw cold water on any rally, relief or otherwise. But a week from now, we will probably not be talking about a magnanimous Donald Trump and a gracious Hillary Clinton around here. We may not remember that this week's rally so far, 3.5%, is the strongest of 2016. \nNo, I am not saying they will be pointing fingers any more or trash talking every minute. I am saying we will be stuck in a world of some unknowns that will be a source of anxiety and therefore selling, and not comfort and therefore buying. \nWhen the euphoria dies down, here's what we will be thinking about. \nFirst, how independent will the Federal Reserve be of President Trump? Will Janet Yellen finish her term? Will Trump break with protocol and denounce the Fed for keeping rates recklessly low? That's a bad headline. \nTwo, we think Trump will greenlight mergers because they are good for business, but what if he says they are anti-competitive and he'll appoint people to block them, like he wants the Time Warner ( TWX ) - AT&T ( T ) tie-up blocked? Maybe he puts a stop to the big healthcare mergers like Humana ( HUM ) - Aetna ( AET ) and Cigna ( CI ) - Anthem ( ANTM ) , which are already being contested by the Justice Department? M&A has been a major prop of this stock market. Prev 0 of 9 Next If you liked this article you might like",

      "text": "As one Air Force veteran and GE leader explains, sometimes the best solution starts in a spreadsheet. \n[Photo: courtesy of CFM International] Paul Thienprayoon 11.14.16 5:00 AM \nOn any given day at GE Aviation, there are thousands of engine parts in circulation. Finding used parts has often meant calling up facility managers and asking them to physically search for material, sometimes to the point of walking to the shelves to see what was on hand. When a replacement request came in, there was no efficient way to sort through the materials available, stalling our process to get that plane back in the air. \nThis didn't sit well with me. In a past life, I flew B-1s for the U.S. Air Force, where I provided Close Air Support for friendly troops in enemy contact. My training and experience helped me learn to diagnose a problem quickly, consider the possible solutions, and take action. When I tried to do something similar at GE, my goal was simply to make the lives of my team members a little easier. Instead—and to my surprise—the simple workflow tool I created has changed the way the our aviation division operates. Seeing Problems Through Others' Eyes \nIf you've flown in the last year, chances are good that you were on a plane powered by one of GE's engines—which are real labors of love. Hundreds of hours of work go into each one, from creating parts to assembly to testing. At the same time, we're taking calls from customers and fielding requests for servicing and maintenance. Every second lost and every unfulfilled request impacts the level of service we're able to provide. With so many things going on at at once, time management couldn't be more critical. We already had a pretty useful tracker that was available to each program manager . . . but it was sent through email, cumbersome, and often lost in the shuffle. \nWe already had a pretty useful tracker that was available to each program manager, showing an updated inventory of used parts. But it was sent through email, cumbersome, and often lost in the shuffle. My time in the military helped teach me to see issues through the eyes of others, and I knew that if we improved on this email-based system, it could have a big impact—on customer interaction, engineers servicing engines, the materials team, and those tasked with identifying spare parts. \nSo I opened up a new spreadsheet in Microsoft Excel and got to work. I had a background in IT, but there was no need—or, frankly, reason—to start developing a full-blown software solution before testing a simple, scrappy prototype. In Excel, we started manually entering all the data that the ideal tool would ultimately do for us automatically. It tracked each spare part, along with the new and used costs, in one easy-to-digest form that would be updated in real time. Simple Solutions Can Make The Biggest Difference \nIf that sounds simple, it was. But a lot of the time, the best solutions are those that can merely overcome the most problematic \"best practices\" rather than try to change everything all at once. Every workplace has its own standard operating procedures, and even an inefficient system, once learned, becomes part of the \"way things are done.\" \nBut just because it's routine doesn't make it right. The surest way to change course is often to show others how a less-than-ideal system impacts them, too. Sometimes the answer is right under your nose (or in your inbox), and all it takes is using the existing process as a foundation for a new one. After all, the best improvements don't always overhaul an entire system. In my experience, the ones that create minimal disruption at first, with the most benefit for as many people as possible, are the ones to look for. \nIt wasn't long before that Excel prototype turned into a fully developed software solution. Today, more than 70 people at GE Aviation are using it to track parts and make smarter decisions about inventory and repair. That number is continuing to grow. The tool logged 9,000 minutes of usage in the last month alone. More and more, GE is using digital analytics and insights to improve productivity and connectivity, often in ways that start small and emerge from people right in the thick of things, like me, rather than being imposed from on high. Rules For Turning Process Hacks Into Major Workflow Changes \nAs more and more people at GE start using this digital tool, it continues to grow—and it's spitting out much more data about our workflows that we didn't have before. So we're constantly discovering new ways of utilizing that information. For one thing, that's proved really useful for gaining new users within the company, but it blurs the original intent of the tool as people try to pull it in different directions. The best improvements don't always overhaul an entire system. \nI'm fine with this. In fact, I'm excited by it. The key, as I see it, is to regularly revisit the primary use of the tool and its impact on the users it was originally developed for—even as others put it to new uses. As their needs change, the tool should change, too. For me, though, keeping that original mission in sight is important. You shouldn't get caught up chasing good ideas and over-complicating something that's already proven itself useful. \nProbably your team isn't trying to track thousands of spare airplane engine parts. But maybe you're trying to locate specific information from within your company, or you're trying to cut down the time spent on administrative tasks. As you look to tackle your own challenges, it's important to remember a few lessons I learned watching my software tool catch on at GE Aviation and beyond. \nFirst, take good notes. Make sure that the process, adoption, and results are all well documented, even as you experiment and tinker. That way you'll have a drawing board to go back to if you need to, and (if it's an immediate success and you don't) you'll be able to demonstrate the value of your idea. \nSecond, be careful of implementing any change that might erode the value of your original solution. And finally, don't just build it and step away once you see it working. It's important to regularly evaluate the purpose and the focus of your idea or solution. As circumstances evolve, your idea needs to evolve with them. Today's inventory tracker is tomorrow's...something else. That's something innovators look forward to. \nPaul Thienprayoon is CFM56 Engine Fulfillment Project Management Lead in GE Aviation's Junior Officer Leadership Program. Never  ",

Click here for a real-time look at his insights and musings.\nCramer: We're Entering a World of Unknowns\nPosted at 4:13 p.m. EDT on Wednesday, Nov. 9, 2016\nFar be it from me to throw cold water on any rally, relief or otherwise. But a week from now, we will probably not be talking about a magnanimous Donald Trump and a gracious Hillary Clinton around here. We may not remember that this week's rally so far, 3.5%, is the strongest of 2016.\nNo, I am not saying they will be pointing fingers any more or trash talking every minute. I am saying we will be stuck in a world of some unknowns that will be a source of anxiety and therefore selling, and not comfort and therefore buying.\nWhen the euphoria dies down, here's what we will be thinking about.\nFirst, how independent will the Federal Reserve be of President Trump? Will Janet Yellen finish her term? Will Trump break with protocol and denounce the Fed for keeping rates recklessly low? That's a bad headline.\nTwo, we think Trump will greenlight mergers because they are good for business, but what if he says they are anti-competitive and he'll appoint people to block them, like he wants the Time Warner ( TWX ) - AT&T ( T ) tie-up blocked? Maybe he puts a stop to the big health care mergers like Humana ( HUM ) - Aetna ( AET ) and Cigna ( CI ) - Anthem ( ANTM ) , which are already being contested by the Justice Department? M&A has been a major prop of this stock market.",

      "text": "Immelt says GE adapting to Trump, populism By Larry Rulison Published 8:53 am, Monday, November 14, 2016 \nGeneral Electric Co. CEO Jeff Immelt told employees in the aftermath of Donald Trump's stunning presidential election that while the company values \"diversity and respect for each other above all else,\" it is also adapting to the wave of global populism that helped get Trump elected. \n\"Globally, we've worked to adapt the company to this trend,\" Immelt wrote on his internal blog for GE employees last week. \"We are localizing our operations and building strong relationships with suppliers and customers around the world. We are providing the goods and services needed to grow economies and improve the lives of all people - reliable, cost-effective power, healthcare, transportation. We will continue to do this in the (United States) as we do elsewhere.\" \nImmelt was critical of Trump over the summer in a Vanity Fair interview, but appeared to put those differences aside in his blog post. \n\"The American people have spoken loudly and voted for change and Donald Trump won a decisive victory,\" Immelt wrote. \"The company will support the new congress and the president elect and work with his administration as we have with each administration for the past 125 years.\" \nGE depends heavily on free trade, which would appear to run counter with Trump's views on the subject. In Schenectady, the company's steam turbine and generator factory exports 85 percent of production. \nStill, Immelt made clear that GE, which he said was run as the ultimate \"meritocracy,\" will not abandon its core values to bend to global trends of populism and doubled down on the company's support for globalism. \n\"We support people of all races, genders and sexual orientations and will continue to ensure a level playing field,\" Immelt wrote. \"We celebrate and will continue to strengthen our affinity groups as a key pipeline for talent. We believe in the importance of globalization and investment. With these core values, we are able to run a global company that adds value to the countries and communities in which we do business.\" Today's Deals",

      "text": "  Tina Casey   Tina Casey Trump or no Trump, the global clean energy train has left the station. A case in point is a new wind, hydropower, and energy storage collaboration between US-based GE and Germany’s Max Bögl Wind AG. The project is on track to connect its four wind turbines to the grid next year, with the hydropower component coming online in 2018. The project represents an innovative combo of two different forms of renewable energy with an energy storage bonus thrown in. Wind turbines and real estate GE dropped a bit of a clue regarding one aspect of the project a couple of years ago, when it introduced its “space frame” turbine tower . The company invited me to take a sneak peek of its prototype in California on behalf of CleanTechnica , and one thing I learned is that GE was beginning to think of wind turbine towers in terms of their footprint. Our guide on the tour pointed out that the hollow design of the turbine tower provides the potential for piggybacking other uses inside the frame. Here’s a view of the interior: That’s a lot of useful space, right? The polyvinyl cladding allows daylight to filter through, so you could imagine indoor farming among many other options. Wind power and energy storage GE’s new project takes the piggyback idea to a whole new level. The project is located at the Gaildorf wind farm. It includes four wind turbines with a combined capacity of 13.6 megawatts. The base of each turbine will double as a water storage reservoir, for a total of 1.6 million gallons (to be clear, these are not GE space frame towers — for obvious reasons, they are fully enclosed). These storage units will interact with a nearby lake with a 9 million gallon capacity, and a 16 megawatt hydropower plant. In effect, the turbines will act as giant batteries and provide an opportunity for the hydroplant to operate economically: During times of peak demand and high electricity prices, the hydro plant will be in production mode. During times of low electricity demand and lower prices, the hydro plant will be in pump mode, pumping and storing water–and hence energy–in the upper reservoir for later use. Here’s a schematic representing how the storage will help ensure the reliable delivery of electricity from the system: To ice the renewable energy cake, the added storage raises the height of each turbine tower by 40 meters. The end result is a “record-breaking” height of 246.5 meters, making these turbines the tallest in the world. GE will contribute its new 3.4-137 (3.4 megawatts, 137 meter rotor diameter) wind turbines to the project. That includes the company’s Digital Wind Farm platform with Predix* software to maximize efficiency. For those of you new to the wind energy topic, stronger, more consistent winds are located at higher altitudes. So, the taller the wind turbine, the better. When the wind is blowing strong, excess energy from the turbines will go directly to the grid. During lulls, the hydropower plant will draw additional water from the turbine towers as needed. Onward And Upwards For Pumped Storage Compared to other forms of energy storage, conventional pumped hydro has a limited opportunity for global application. Geography is the main limiting factor because two reservoirs are required, and one must be located higher up than the other. The innovative approach offered by the GE – Bögl collaboration expands those opportunities to more sites, where an in-ground upper reservoir is otherwise unfeasible. According to GE, Bögl is already anticipating that it will engage in one or two similar projects in Germany annually after the Gaildorf project goes online. As for GE, the company’s GE Renewable Energy arm has been front and center in the clean energy revolution, especially in the area of wind turbine technology. The company positioned its wind turbine business to take full advantage of the federal Production Tax Credit for wind, and now it has been expanding into the wind transmission sector . GE recently got back into the high voltage converter business after a 20-year hiatus, just in time to hook up with the proposed 720-mile Plains & Eastern wind transmission line. The company will provide three converter stations for the project, which also has the support of the Energy Department .",

      "title": "GE Podcast Theater Returns A New Sci-Fi Thriller \"LifeAfter\"",
      "text": "Last year, General Electric saw a glimpse of marketing&apos;s future in entertainment by harking back to the past. The brand teamed with its agency BBDO New York, and Slate&apos;s Panoply to launch the GE Podcast Theater with an eight-episode, fictional sci-fi thriller podcast called \"The Message.\" The pod, utilizing storytelling techniques reminiscent of 1940s and 50s radio, was a hit , garnering millions of downloads, and a shelf-full of industry awards.\nFollowing up a blockbuster, as any band or film director can tell you, is no guarantee of success. And now GE gets to find out if \"The Message\" was a one-hit wonder. The brand has unveiled its second podcast, \"LifeAfter,\" which it describes as a \" Her meets Ex Machina \" AI adventure, pondering the question of what happens to our digital identities after we pass, and what role AI can play in the grieving process. \nGE&apos;s head of media innovation Alexa Christon says the goal and process behind \"LifeAfter\" follows very closely to that of its predecessor, to tell a really good story that touches on a theme reflecting on the company&apos;s work in science and technology. For \"The Message,\" that was sound-based medical treatments, but this time the broad theme revolves around digital twinning.\n\"Obviously it&apos;s completely fictional in the podcast, but from a business standpoint we talk about digital twins as the virtual twin of a physical product,\" says Christon. \"Like a jet engine will have a digital twin of its physical object, so as that object performs and does things, the digital version will do the same thing. So from an industrial standpoint—gas turbines, jet engines, those types of big iron we talk about—the digital twin is crucial in how our customers and how we will manage efficiencies in those big iron products in a virtual way and in a virtual space.\"\n\nChriston says the success of \"The Message\" really put a skip in GE&apos;s creative step. \"I think we saw there&apos;s really a white space in storytelling, and we&apos;re pushing that even more in this second podcast,\" she says. \"What we learned is that while the space is flooded with content, there still isn&apos;t a defined space for this fictional, dramatic radio-style storytelling, and people are really enjoying it. We also learned that people feel this one-to-one relationship with their podcast hosts, and in this space, it&apos;s almost literary, in that you set the stage, create this platform and listeners are imagining it with you, and that&apos;s compelling and exciting.\"\nIt&apos;s a basic tenet of branded content which too often, too many marketers ignore—it&apos;s the quality that generates the audience reaction you&apos;re hoping for, not the number of times you can fit a brand mention in. By being up front and clear about its involvement—it&apos;s called GE Podcast Theater, after all—then stepping aside and letting the story do the work, the brand is fostering a valuable trust with listeners.\n\"This is a very interesting space where people are making a very conscious choice—you have to download a podcast, you have to subscribe and listen, and creating that relationship is something that brands in general covet. How do you create that relationship? How do you provide that &apos;value&apos;?\" sats Christon. \"The brand coming across as providing a really entertaining experience that people find fun and smart, is something we&apos;ve been really excited about experimenting with.\"",

      "text": "Blog This \nGE Digital (NYSE: GE) today announced it has acquired ServiceMax, a leader in cloud-based field service management (FSM) solutions, for $915 million. The acquisition provides GE Digital with enhanced capabilities to advance its Industrial Internet vision, enabling customers to immediately gain more value from their assets and find greater efficiency in their field service processes. \nService has always been a core part of GE’s strategy and capability and was an early target for the company’s work in analytics and productivity. GE has invested in the build out of digital twins for industrial assets. In addition the company has accelerated productivity improvements through digitizing service processes. The ServiceMax product offering was an essential element to driving GE internal productivity. With this acquisition GE plans to add analytics and insights into the ServiceMax logistics, workforce optimization and deployment models. GE estimates there is a market-wide opportunity to improve service productivity by $25 billion through the use of analytical tools. \nServiceMax’s platform provides a full suite of applications, including inventory and parts logistics, scheduling and workforce optimization, and work order management. As a result of this transaction, customers will be able to access these offerings from a modern rapid application development cloud and field-ready mobile platform that combines the strength of GE’s deep domain expertise and advanced industrial portfolio with ServiceMax’s field service expertise. The company plans to leverage the Predix platform to further the development of additional industrial applications focused on service delivery. \n“This acquisition builds upon our ongoing efforts to enhance our overall technology stack around the Predix platform and advance our Industrial Internet vision,” said Bill Ruh, CEO, GE Digital. “Improved productivity is critical for the Industrial Internet and digitizing field services is a cornerstone of a successful digital industrial strategy. This transaction, along with our previous acquisitions of Wurldtech and Meridium, is directly aligned with our strategy to drive growth both inorganically and organically by building the capabilities to support the digital industrial transformation through Predix, APM and the Digital Thread.” \nThe addition of ServiceMax’s complementary capabilities and highly-talented team better positions GE Digital to develop and accelerate the commercialization of Predix applications, delivering service products through a single, robust platform. This platform will address the service needs of enterprises across the entire service delivery process and provide the critical expertise and technologies needed to accelerate GE Digital’s existing services solution roadmaps. Coupled with the recent acquisition of Meridium, GE Digital will now provide a full suite of applications centered on driving comprehensive asset management for the Industrial Internet. \nIn addition, this transaction brings to GE Digital an immediate vertical customer base as well as significant recognition in the market and enhances GE Digital’s ability to commercialize its field services solutions. ServiceMax will have access to new verticals and will be able to utilize GE Digital’s scale and comprehensive Predix platform to enhance and strengthen their offerings for customers. \nDave Yarnold, CEO, ServiceMax, said, “The transaction will help position ServiceMax to reach its next phase of growth by having access to GE’s broad and advanced industrial portfolio, deep domain expertise and substantial customer footprint. We look forward to benefitting from GE’s experience, capabilities and resources as we expand into new markets while continuing to deliver the best tools to help customers maximize productivity and efficiency.” \nAcquisitions are part of the GE Digital strategy to accelerate efforts in leading the Industrial Internet. The company will provide an update on their strategy and demonstrate progress at their flagship Minds and Machines event November 15-16 in San Francisco. \nThe acquisition of ServiceMax is expected to close in January, subject to customary closing conditions, including receipt of applicable regulatory approvals. \nMorgan Stanley acted as exclusive financial advisor to ServiceMax with Gundersen Dettmer LLP serving as legal counsel for ServiceMax. King & Spalding, LLP served as legal counsel for GE Digital. \nABOUT GE DIGITAL \nGE Digital connects streams of machine data to powerful analytics, providing Industrial companies with valuable insights to manage assets and operations more efficiently.

      "title": "GE deepens Silicon Valley push with $915 million cloud purchase",
      "text": "GE deepens Silicon Valley push with $915 million cloud purchase By Richard Clough, Bloomberg Published: November 14, 2016 12:23 PM CDT Updated: November 14, 2016 12:35 PM CDT 0 shares facebook twitter email comments × \nGeneral Electric Co. agreed to buy ServiceMax, a cloud-based software company, for $915 million to expand its digital operations and enhance equipment maintenance. \nThe deal will help GE automate and digitize the servicing of heavy-duty machinery, the Boston-based company said Monday in a statement. GE expects the acquisition to close in January. \n\"It's no secret our services revenue is the bulk of our earnings and is a key part of what makes us successful,\" Bill Ruh, chief executive officer of GE Digital, said in an interview. \"We're moving away from where it's all on paper to where it's all becoming fully automated. Services are becoming a key part of the digital economy.\" \nGE is investing in software operations and attempting to position itself as a \"digital industrial\" company that makes equipment outfitted with sensors to improve productivity. CEO Jeffrey Immelt has sold off most finance and consumer businesses while focusing on industries such as energy and aviation. \nGE Digital, established last year and based on the outskirts of Silicon Valley, may become a $15 billion business by 2020, the company has said. GE has developed an operating system called Predix to help run industrial equipment more reliably and efficiently. \nGerman rival Siemens also has been expanding its digital presence. The engineering company on Monday agreed to buy U.S. software maker Mentor Graphics Corp. for $4.5 billion. \nServiceMax provides field-service management software to remotely track equipment maintenance, create work orders and manage repair schedules. The Pleasanton, California-based company had raised more than $200 million from investors including GE's venture arm. \nGE considered developing its own ability to automate and digitize servicing, but opted to buy ServiceMax after using its products over the last two years, Ruh said. Industrial servicing, including maintenance and upgrades of previously sold equipment, could be a $1 trillion global market over the next 10 years, and digitizing the process could account for a significant percentage of that, Ruh said. \n\"This is a large opportunity,\" he said. \nThe acquisition of ServiceMax extends a recent shopping spree for GE, including a tie-up between the oil division and Baker Hughes Inc., deals in the 3-D printer market and the purchase of a maker of wind-turbine blades. \nServiceMax also complements other moves GE has made to fill out its digital business, Ruh said. The company in September paid $495 million for Meridium Inc., a software developer focused on asset performance management, or the monitoring of equipment. \nGE will continue to look for \"tuck-in\" acquisitions for the digital business, he said. \"These things fit together as a string of pearls.\" \nMorgan Stanley was the financial adviser for ServiceMax and Gundersen Dettmer served as legal counsel, according to the statement. King & Spalding was legal counsel for GE Digital. \n(c) 2016, Bloomberg Subscribe to NewsOK's Business Headlines Stay up to date with business news in Oklahoma and around the country.

      "title": "GE acquires field operations specalist ServiceMax for $915M",
      "text": "Two months after forming a new division to widen the adoption of cloud computing and analytics in the industrial world, General Electric Co. is acquiring ServiceMax Inc. for $915 million to fast-track its efforts.\nThe deal buys the company one of the world’s most widely-used platforms for managing field service operations. ServiceMax boasts thousands of corporate clients including among others GE itself, which has been using the platform for more than two years now to coordinate technical activities. The industrial giant derives most of its revenue from providing equipment inspections, repair assistance and other professional services to organizations that use its gear.\nBill Ruh, the head of GE’s recently formed digital division, told Bloomberg that his group originally wanted to develop a homegrown automation platform but was so impressed with ServiceMax it opted for an acquisition instead. GE will incorporate new analytics features into the suite after the deal completes next year to try and increase its usefulness even further.\nThe acquisition announcement didn’t go into too much detail, but a quick glance at the industrial giant’s data processing portfolio should provide a good idea of what’s to come. GE likely intends to connect ServiceMax with its cloud-based Predix platform for analyzing machine-generated transmissions to give field staff a better understanding of the equipment they maintain. Such integration has the potential to streamline many tasks that currently require manually accessing and communicating operational information.\nGE could, for example, make equipment logs from Predix accessible in ServiceMax’s dispatcher console to let team leaders coordinate the work of their technicians more effectively. And those technicians in turn would likewise benefit from the ability to access real-time data about a piece of machinery while carrying out repairs. There’s also a chance that the industrial giant will integrate ServiceMax with the asset tracking tools that it gained through the purchase of Meridium Inc. in September to provide an even more complete view of operations.\nGE’s Bill Ruh suggested during his interview with Bloomberg that more acquisitions will follow as his division continues to expand its technology portfolio. The company will certainly need to invest heavily if it wants to achieve CEO Jeffrey Immelt’s ambitious goal of reaching $15 billion in digital sales by 2020.\nImage via Pixabay ",

      "text": "Peter Lynch Chart of GE \nPrinters that once cost $30,000 are now priced closer to $1,000 and have the potential to rewrite the rules of global manufacturing. Additive manufacturing will be an industry disruptor to many major industries, including medical equipment, healthcare, automotive, defense and even architecture. With a little bit of finesse recently, companies like General Electric ( NYSE:GE ) and HP Inc. ( NYSE:HPQ ) are targeting this space through acquisitions. \nIn late October, GE made a play on the space through a $599 million acquisition of German 3-D printing company Concept Laser. This new style of manufacturing produces parts with less of a workload than antiquated production systems, creates less scrap overall and increases capabilities for design immensely. This confirmed acquisition came shortly after the company failed to come to an agreement with Concept Laser rival SLM Solutions. \nThe major reason for this failure simply came down to the 20% owner of SLM, Elliott Advisors, rejecting GE’s offer for nearly $800 million . Considering this, it was reported that GE increased its bid for Swedish 3-D printer manufacturer Arcam. Ultimately, GE is looking to increase exposure to 3-D printing and additive manufacturing to enhance its position for its $25 billion jet-engine business. \nThis anticipated surge that 3-D printing is expected to see has also sparked others to take a first step. HP introduced its Jet Fusion 3-D printing solution earlier this year. They labeled it “the world’s first production-ready 3-D printing system.” Even though the failure to be an early adopter to this segment initially hurt HP, the company has quickly taken measures to remedy this. The Jet Fusion solution is aimed at being faster, simplified and hold higher quality in comparison to its competitors. \nThen again, many would think that a company known for two-dimensional printing would have already been well behind this movement from the beginning. With other products like HP’s Sprout technology, this may not only be a commercial focus but a consumer one as well. Sprout is basically a 3-D scanning device that helps to simplify the printing process overall. It takes several 2-D images, stitches them together and spits out instructions for a desktop style printer to get the job done. \nHP and GE are still a bit behind the ball. Although they are making strides, there have already been leaders established in the space. Companies like Stratasys ( NASDAQ:SSYS ) and 3D Systems ( NYSE:DDD ) continue to lead the market when it comes to the “3-D printing pure play.” \nStratasys is expected to release earnings this week and street estimates are already showing a speculative nature. This will be the first full quarter the newly appointed CEO, Ilan Levin, has held the position. Street expectations as of Oct. 28 show expected earnings per share of about five cents with revenue of roughly $174.5 million. This would represent a year over year growth of 400% based on EPS and 4.2% based on revenue projections. The first quarter launch of the company’s J750 brought a breath of fresh air to a somewhat stale story. The device became the world’s first multimaterial, full-color 3-D printer. Furthermore, this summer, the company announced it would be building ties with companies like Ford, Siemens and Boeing to enhance modeling-based 3-D printing technologies for different functions of production. Again, another situation where the greater focus is on commercial scale methods instead of a more novelty, consumer grade product. \nThat being said, the long-term approach to 3-D printing has proven to be a great payoff for investors. Not only for companies like Stratasys, but also 3D Systems. 3D Systems was one of the first to make a strong push into the arena, ahead of any initial hype. For instance, 3D Systems Inc.’s sales into design and manufacturing increased 27% from 2013 to 2014, growing to $609.8 million in sales. Sales into health care increased 80%, from $71.7 million in 2013 to $129.3 million in 2014. \nRecently, the company reported earnings for the 3rd quarter, showing a rise to $156.4 million. That is a year over year growth increase of 3% compared to the same period in 2015. 3D Systems boasts a current cash position of nearly $180 million on hand. 3D Systems was trading at $1.25 before it shot up to nearly $100 per share in just a few years. Now the stock trades between roughly $14 to $20 per share. \nOther companies that investors should look at are also in the small-cap space. Organovo Holdings ( NASDAQ:ONVO ) and Heritage Printing Technology Corp. ( HAGE ) have had their fair share of milestones ahead of this boom in 3-D printing. Organovo, for instance, focuses on the biological applications that 3-D printing can offer. The company reported its fiscal second-quarter earnings results earlier this month. Even though they reported a net loss, total revenue increased nearly 360% in comparison to fiscal 2016. In addition, in comparison to the first quarter, second quarter revenues were up over 50%. The company only has two months behind it since commercialization and, per management, the company has “gained early traction of its kidney tissue.” \nSince stutter-stepping earlier this month, share prices for Organovo have recovered significantly, to the tune of roughly 33%. Heritage Printing experienced its own spike in trading activity during October and November. Since hitting lows of 15 cents last month, share prices seem to be stabilizing above 20 cents over recent trading periods. Currently. the company is focused on the emerging Chinese market for 3-D printing and the anticipated increase in government expenditure that will be seen through 2020. Not only this, but many large-scale Chinese manufacturers have looked to 3-D printing as an alternative to older methods. \nFoxconn, for instance, is completely changing its view on the sector. Terry Gou, Foxconn’s president, originally called 3-D printing “just a gimmick.” Now the company is targeting 3-D printing to enhance its research and deveopment and manufacturing processes. If you are not familiar with the Taiwan-based contract manufacturer, you may not need to look any further than the room around you. Notable products manufactured by the company include Blackberry phones, iPads, iPhones, Xbox One, Nokias and Playstations. \nSo, this is the bare-bones of it all. Three-dimensional printing could be starting to regain market interest and now it is not just 3-D printing-only companies spearheading that charge. Large organizations that once thought this was a gimmick industry are now coming into the space at full force. It may be only a matter of time until the next big wave of interest comes back into the 3-D printing and additive manufacturing industry. Just make sure you know what side to be on when it does. \nDisclosure: The author owns ZERO shares in any stock mentioned.",

Credit: Stephen Lawson Use commas to separate multiple email addresses From Your message has been sent. Sorry IDG News Service | Nov 14, 2016 12:38 PM PT RELATED TOPICS Comments \nGeneral Electric’s US$915 million acquisition of field service management company ServiceMax on Monday should help enterprises combine what GE does for industrial products and assets with more tools for those who work on them. \nGE Digital, the division that’s buying ServiceMax, sells software and services for connecting industrial assets and products in the field, then collecting and analyzing data about them. ServiceMax has a cloud-based platform for tasks like scheduling maintenance calls and making sure the right technician is on each job with the right part. \nThat service management system will get smarter when GE Digital adds its analytics and insights, the companies said. Using its cloud-based industrial internet platform, Predix , GE Digital plans to develop more applications for service delivery. The buyout will also bring ServiceMax into new industries, they said. \n[ Also on CIO.com: Don't rush your company into an IoT app platform ] \n“This acquisition builds upon our ongoing efforts to enhance our overall technology stack around the Predix platform and advance our Industrial Internet vision,” GE Digital CEO Bill Ruh said in a press release. \nPredix began as an internal tool that GE used to glean insights from data coming in from systems the company made, such as jet engines. Now, GE Digital sells it as a kind of operating system for the internet of things for others to take advantage of their own industrial data. \nCombining intelligence about industrial assets in the field with software to manage the servicing of those assets should be a natural fit and a boon to efficiency. ServiceMax is 10 years old and a big player in its field, with customers including companies in manufacturing, retail, energy, aerospace, and other businesses. GE itself says it has been a big user of ServiceMax internally. \nThe latest acquisition dovetails with GE Digital’s recent purchase of Meridium , a provider of asset performance management tools, which also will be integrated into Predix. \nThe ServiceMax acquisition comes just a day before GE’s Minds + Machines conference in San Francisco, where the company will give an update on Predix and the ecosystem of developers around it. On Monday, GE Digital announced a program to help independent software vendors use Predix as the foundation for new applications. \nThe acquisition is expected to close in January. RELATED TOPICS ",

      "text": "Expands existing partnership that has driven significant productivity across GE; adds new capability to offer in the $1 trillion market for industrial service\nSAN RAMON, Calif. --(BUSINESS WIRE) GE Digital (NYSE: GE) today announced it has acquired ServiceMax, a leader in cloud-based field service management (FSM) solutions, for $915 million. The acquisition provides GE Digital with enhanced capabilities to advance its Industrial Internet vision, enabling customers to immediately gain more value from their assets and find greater efficiency in their field service processes.\nService has always been a core part of GE’s strategy and capability and was an early target for the company’s work in analytics and productivity. GE has invested in the build out of digital twins for industrial assets. In addition the company has accelerated productivity improvements through digitizing service processes. The ServiceMax product offering was an essential element to driving GE internal productivity. With this acquisition GE plans to add analytics and insights into the ServiceMax logistics, workforce optimization and deployment models. GE estimates there is a market-wide opportunity to improve service productivity by $25 billion through the use of analytical tools.\nServiceMax’s platform provides a full suite of applications, including inventory and parts logistics, scheduling and workforce optimization, and work order management. As a result of this transaction, customers will be able to access these offerings from a modern rapid application development cloud and field-ready mobile platform that combines the strength of GE’s deep domain expertise and advanced industrial portfolio with ServiceMax’s field service expertise. The company plans to leverage the Predix platform to further the development of additional industrial applications focused on service delivery.\n“This acquisition builds upon our ongoing efforts to enhance our overall technology stack around the Predix platform and advance our Industrial Internet vision,” said Bill Ruh, CEO, GE Digital. “Improved productivity is critical for the Industrial Internet and digitizing field services is a cornerstone of a successful digital industrial strategy. This transaction, along with our previous acquisitions of Wurldtech and Meridium, is directly aligned with our strategy to drive growth both inorganically and organically by building the capabilities to support the digital industrial transformation through Predix, APM and the Digital Thread.”\nThe addition of ServiceMax’s complementary capabilities and highly-talented team better positions GE Digital to develop and accelerate the commercialization of Predix applications, delivering service products through a single, robust platform. This platform will address the service needs of enterprises across the entire service delivery process and provide the critical expertise and technologies needed to accelerate GE Digital’s existing services solution roadmaps. Coupled with the recent acquisition of Meridium, GE Digital will now provide a full suite of applications centered on driving comprehensive asset management for the Industrial Internet.\nIn addition, this transaction brings to GE Digital an immediate vertical customer base as well as significant recognition in the market and enhances GE Digital’s ability to commercialize its field services solutions. ServiceMax will have access to new verticals and will be able to utilize GE Digital’s scale and comprehensive Predix platform to enhance and strengthen their offerings for customers.\nDave Yarnold, CEO, ServiceMax, said, “The transaction will help position ServiceMax to reach its next phase of growth by having access to GE’s broad and advanced industrial portfolio, deep domain expertise and substantial customer footprint. We look forward to benefitting from GE’s experience, capabilities and resources as we expand into new markets while continuing to deliver the best tools to help customers maximize productivity and efficiency.”\nAcquisitions are part of the GE Digital strategy to accelerate efforts in leading the Industrial Internet. The company will provide an update on their strategy and demonstrate progress at their flagship Minds and Machines event November 15-16 in San Francisco.\nThe acquisition of ServiceMax is expected to close in January, subject to customary closing conditions, including receipt of applicable regulatory approvals.\nMorgan Stanley acted as exclusive financial advisor to ServiceMax with Gundersen Dettmer LLP serving as legal counsel for ServiceMax.

Credit: Stephen Lawson Use commas to separate multiple email addresses From Your message has been sent. Sorry IDG News Service | November 14, 2016 RELATED TOPICS Software as a Service (SaaS) \nGeneral Electric’s US$915 million acquisition of field service management company ServiceMax on Monday should help enterprises combine what GE does for industrial products and assets with more tools for those who work on them. \nGE Digital, the division that’s buying ServiceMax, sells software and services for connecting industrial assets and products in the field, then collecting and analyzing data about them. ServiceMax has a cloud-based platform for tasks like scheduling maintenance calls and making sure the right technician is on each job with the right part. \nThat service management system will get smarter when GE Digital adds its analytics and insights, the companies said. Using its cloud-based industrial internet platform, Predix , GE Digital plans to develop more applications for service delivery. The buyout will also bring ServiceMax into new industries, they said. [ Best Bluetooth speakers: We'll help you find the best wireless speakers for pairing with your smartphone or tablet—whatever your budget, and whatever music floats your boat. ] \n“This acquisition builds upon our ongoing efforts to enhance our overall technology stack around the Predix platform and advance our Industrial Internet vision,” GE Digital CEO Bill Ruh said in a press release. \nPredix began as an internal tool that GE used to glean insights from data coming in from systems the company made, such as jet engines. Now, GE Digital sells it as a kind of operating system for the internet of things for others to take advantage of their own industrial data. \nCombining intelligence about industrial assets in the field with software to manage the servicing of those assets should be a natural fit and a boon to efficiency. ServiceMax is 10 years old and a big player in its field, with customers including companies in manufacturing, retail, energy, aerospace, and other businesses. GE itself says it has been a big user of ServiceMax internally. \nThe latest acquisition dovetails with GE Digital’s recent purchase of Meridium , a provider of asset performance management tools, which also will be integrated into Predix. \nThe ServiceMax acquisition comes just a day before GE’s Minds + Machines conference in San Francisco, where the company will give an update on Predix and the ecosystem of developers around it. On Monday, GE Digital announced a program to help independent software vendors use Predix as the foundation for new applications. \nThe acquisition is expected to close in January. RELATED TOPICS",

      "text": "General Electric is paying $915 million to buy ServiceMax, a purveyor of software for scheduling field service visits. The move pits the company directly against Microsoft , Salesforce , and Oracle.\nUnder the agreement disclosed Monday and expected to close in Jan. 2017, ServiceMax will become part of GE Digital, the group that owns GE’s investments in software for managing a wide range of machines connected to the Internet. The centerpiece of that strategy is the company’s Predix technology , which collects and analyzes data from jet engines, wind turbines, and other heavy-duty equipment. GE plans to connect the data collected with Predix to the ServiceMax applications. The idea is to help anticipate service needs more proactively.\nThis is the group’s third big acquisition. Two years ago, GE bought cybersecurity firm Wurldtech, and in September, the company paid almost $500 million for Meridium, which specializes in software for monitoring equipment.\nGet Data Sheet , Fortune's technology newsletter. \nServiceMax , based in San Ramon, Calif., makes applications that more than 400 companies--including Coca-Cola and Tyco tyc --use to schedule and manage visits by field service technicians. (Prior to the acquisition, GE was also a customer.) As an independent company, ServiceMax has raised more than $202 million in backing.\nThe deal will pit GE more directly against some pretty formidable software companies.\nIn July 2015, Microsoft msft acquired ServiceMax rival FieldOne Services , which supplies software to United Technologies and Mitsubishi-Hitachi Power Systems. Salesforce crm introduced its own field service application in March, and Oracle orcl is also building out cloud services for field services, as a result of its July 2014 buyout of TOA Technologies .\n \n \n \n \n ",

Credit: Stephen Lawson Use commas to separate multiple email addresses From Your message has been sent. Sorry IDG News Service | Nov 14, 2016 12:38 PM PT RELATED TOPICS Comments \nGeneral Electric’s US$915 million acquisition of field service management company ServiceMax on Monday should help enterprises combine what GE does for industrial products and assets with more tools for those who work on them. \nGE Digital, the division that’s buying ServiceMax, sells software and services for connecting industrial assets and products in the field, then collecting and analyzing data about them. ServiceMax has a cloud-based platform for tasks like scheduling maintenance calls and making sure the right technician is on each job with the right part. \nThat service management system will get smarter when GE Digital adds its analytics and insights, the companies said. Using its cloud-based industrial internet platform, Predix , GE Digital plans to develop more applications for service delivery. The buyout will also bring ServiceMax into new industries, they said. INSIDER: 5 ways to prepare for Internet of Things security threats \n“This acquisition builds upon our ongoing efforts to enhance our overall technology stack around the Predix platform and advance our Industrial Internet vision,” GE Digital CEO Bill Ruh said in a press release. \nPredix began as an internal tool that GE used to glean insights from data coming in from systems the company made, such as jet engines. Now, GE Digital sells it as a kind of operating system for the internet of things for others to take advantage of their own industrial data. \nCombining intelligence about industrial assets in the field with software to manage the servicing of those assets should be a natural fit and a boon to efficiency. ServiceMax is 10 years old and a big player in its field, with customers including companies in manufacturing, retail, energy, aerospace, and other businesses. GE itself says it has been a big user of ServiceMax internally. \nThe latest acquisition dovetails with GE Digital’s recent purchase of Meridium , a provider of asset performance management tools, which also will be integrated into Predix. \nThe ServiceMax acquisition comes just a day before GE’s Minds + Machines conference in San Francisco, where the company will give an update on Predix and the ecosystem of developers around it. On Monday, GE Digital announced a program to help independent software vendors use Predix as the foundation for new applications. \nThe acquisition is expected to close in January. RELATED TOPICS",
