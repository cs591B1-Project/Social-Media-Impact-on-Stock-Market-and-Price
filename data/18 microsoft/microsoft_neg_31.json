      "text": "| Topic: Data Management \nTo me, the biggest surprise announcement coming out of Microsoft's Connect() 2016 conference last week wasn't that Microsoft was joining the Linux Foundation. Instead, it was that SQL Server Next would be \"the same\" on Linux and Windows Server , and be available for both by mid-2017. \nI was surprised because the idea of \"one SQL Server with support for two operating systems,\" seemed inconsistent with Microsoft's claim earlier this year that SQL Server on Linux would include a subset of features in SQL Server 2016 for Windows , a product which Microsoft only made generally available in June this year. \nAs The Walking Cat, @h0x0d, discovered by taking a peek into the public preview of SQL Server on Linux released last week, Microsoft seemed to be using the Microsoft Research \"Drawbridge\" technology to bring SQL Server to Linux. \nDrawbridge is an adaptation of the Library OS concept on which Microsoft Research has been working for the past several years. It's a form of virtualization specifically for application sandboxing. Drawbridge played a role in getting the Bash shell to run on Windows 10 , too. \nA Microsoft spokesperson confirmed that Drawbridge, was, indeed, at the core of how Microsoft got SQL Server running on Linux. \n\"To enable SQL Server on Linux we have created the SQL Platform Abstraction Layer (SQLPAL), which evolved from Drawbridge,\" the spokesperson said when I asked. \nSo what about Microsoft's claim that \"all features of the SQL Server Next database will be available in Linux and Windows\"? \nMicrosoft's documenation for SQL Server on Linux clarifies things a bit here. Here's the specific wording: \"It's the same SQL Server database engine (for both the Windows and Linux versions), with many similar features and services regardless of your operating system.\" \nCurrently, quite a few of SQL Server for Windows' features are not yet available on Linux, though Microsoft's plan is to \"increasingly enable\" these during monthly updates during the preview program.",

      "title": "Does Microsoft's \"Password Ban\" list insecurely store user passwords?",
      "text": "A stripped down version of this may be helpful (as addition): Consider the \"hash function\" that maps uppercase to A, lowercase to a, digits to 1, specials to % and immediately ban anything hashing to Aaaa, Aaaa11, Aaaa1111, or similar totally overused patterns – Hagen von Eitzen May 29 at 13:23 up vote 0 down vote \nI think the best thing to do is just checking for password weakness on server side, this can be an expensive operation (in example lookup from dictionaries). Also passwords commonly used or checked for attacks are a good bet. \nIt is possible MS first try to hash the password and compare it with a list of unsecure passwords (that are actually not used by any real user). If the hash fail, then it could in example try to look for password strenght with another euristic , finally it can either refuse or accept the password and forget it in its non-hashed version. If the password is refused it is likely it is added to unsecure hash list . \nPassword weakness check can also keep into account common used attacks, so it has to be a evolving algorithm. \nThis has either 2 advantages: You do not need to store ALL unsecure passwords' hashes. You can ban altogheter collisions in hashes (in example a strong password with same hash of a weak password). \nOf course those are just speculations, we cannot know password security measures taken by such a big corp like microsoft. \nAs final measure I would just use a different hash for weak passwords compared to real user passwords. \nEDIT: Why even weak passwords should be hashed? To me there's no need for strong hashing, but hashing weak passwords would allow at least to \"secure\" valuable data. It is no cost do some simple hashing, but if any database data leak, you know at least competitors won't be able to easily reverse weak passwords, wich may still be a security concern for services that do not use the ban list or at least may just cause a minor economical advantage . \nSo to answer GroundZero comment: No, to me neither weak passwords should stored in plain text. A simple hash would benefit the corporation anyway. This is because there are passwords that are culture specific, gather that information would require massive investement, so why should you store valuable info in an easy to retrieve way?",

      "text": "Microsoft agrees to more transparency on taxes in Australia   21, 2016 at 1:23 pm The Australian government is one of the most aggressive in highlighting the issue of multinational corporations avoiding taxes through extensive use of tax havens. Share story Matt Day Seattle Times technology reporter \nMicrosoft’s Australian subsidiary will start disclosing the amount of tax it pays in Australia, opting in to a government transparency program aimed at shedding light on the shadowy world of global tax avoidance, the Australian Financial Review reported. \nAustralia’s government is one of the most aggressive in a global crackdown on multinational corporations that avoid taxes by stashing income in tax havens. \nA statute recently enacted there sets up a voluntary reporting scheme in which companies publicly disclose their profit and income tax paid to Australia, “to highlight those that are paying their fair share and to encourage all businesses not to engage in aggressive tax avoidance.” \nMicrosoft Australia will be the first local arm of a multinational technology firm to join the program, the Australian Financial Review reported Friday . Microsoft declined to comment.   \nMicrosoft, like many multinational companies, has spent decades building a corporate structure designed to minimize taxes by funneling revenue to tax havens, including Singapore, Ireland and Bermuda. A portion of that structure is being scrutinized by the Internal Revenue Service, part of a contentious audit that has wound up in federal court in Seattle. \nThe Redmond-based company as of June 30 had accumulated more than $124 billion in income, untaxed in the U.S., that it deems permanently reinvested in other countries. \nMicrosoft says the sum would be subject to $39.3 billion in U.S. taxes if it were repatriated. That disclosure indicates that some income generated by Microsoft’s overseas operations is subject to a tax of as low as 4 percent, lower than the going rate in any of Microsoft’s major markets. \nAustralia’s top corporate tax rate is 30 percent. The U.S. has the highest corporate rate in the developed world, at 35 percent, though many multinational companies actually pay a lower effective rate. \nThe scope of the figures Microsoft will report under the new Australian disclosure program likely won’t be a surprise. \nIn December, Australian tax authorities published tax data for more than 1,800 companies, showing Microsoft paid about $31 million Australian dollars to the treasury during the 2013-14 tax year there. \nThat sum would be higher if Microsoft didn’t route the vast majority of its sales to Australian consumers through its Singapore unit. \nBill Sample, Microsoft’s tax chief, told Australian lawmakers at a hearing last year that just 5 percent of its sales to Australian consumers during the company’s 2014 fiscal year were subject to Australian income taxes. The rest were technically made by a Singapore-based entity. \nA structure similar to Microsoft’s Australia-Singapore arrangement helped the company avoid paying up to $143 million a year in U.K. taxes by attributing sales to British customers to an Irish unit, the London-based Sunday Times reported earlier this year. \nThe Australian disclosure regime follows guidelines released last year by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development recommending that companies disclose to governments where they pay their taxes and generate income. \nThe recommendations from the OECD, a policy coordinating group for developed nations, are designed to compel tax regulators to ensure that corporate income taxes more closely align with actual economic activity.

      "text": "Microsoft’s awesome Surface devices are up to $280 off Excellent Surface deals make it hard to resist...so give in already! Brendan Nystedt November 21, 2016 \nWhile there have been ups and downs with Microsoft's flagship computer line, there's been no better time to buy. At least until next year, the current Surface Book and Surface Pro 4 are the best you can get from Microsoft, and they've had time to iron out some quirks we saw when trying them earlier this year. \nFor the time being, Microsoft's official Microsoft Store website is giving out substantial price cuts on these devices. It still depends on which you think suits your needs best, but both Surface Pro 4 and Surface Book have distinct benefits and drawbacks. I've used both devices a lot and can recommend either. Here are the current official deals from Microsoft, and the reasons to buy. Surface Book i5, $250 off \nI thought this notebook was cool when I tried it earlier this year, and I'm even more bullish on it today then I was then . With the initial bugs worked out, it's a safe buy with fast internals and all the premium design you'd expect for the price. The entry-level model is down to only $1,249 with the current sale, and even though it has a 128 GB SSD inside, it's a great device. Credit: Reviewed.com / Brendan Nystedt \nFor the money, this looks more and more like the premium 2-in-1 to beat for the holidays. Not only is it a super nice notebook PC, its tablet form is as svelte as you'd want (granted, it'll only last a couple hours in that form) and a Surface Pen is included in the box. Especially if you love drawing and taking notes, Surface Book offers a blend of style and substance that even the new MacBook Pros struggle to compete with. Surface Pro 4 i5, up to $280 off with a Type Cover \nEven though it's a slightly tricker sell as a laptop, Surface Pro 4 continues to be an awesome 2-in-1 . Over the past year, I spent plenty of time with both this Pro, as well as Apple's iPad Pro. There's a reason I grabbed the Pro 4 way more often than I reached for the Apple device, and that's because the Surface is more useful for real pro functionality. It's cheaper, too, thanks to this awesome deal. Normally $1,000, this Surface Pro is down to $799. Credit: Reviewed.com / Brendan Nystedt \nNormally, the Pro 4 comes only with a charger and Surface Pen, but if you spend $50 more right now, you get your choice of Type Cover. Type Cover is an essential accessory, and one that normally retails for $130, so you're saving a grand total of $280. Even with its Core i5 chip and 4 GB RAM, it's enough computer for a light user that would otherwise consider an iPad. \nWe’ve scoured the web to find you the best deals on good products.

      "text": "Microsoft today announced the public preview of Service Map, a new solution in Operations Management Suite Insight & Analytics that helps organizations discover and map server and process dependencies in real-time, without any predefinition, and visualize application components, service dependencies, and supports infrastructure configuration. It supports Windows and Linux guests, in any cloud and on-premises, discovering dependencies for any TCP-connected process running in those guests.\nService Map will help in eliminating the guesswork of problem isolation, identify surprise connections and broken links in an environment, and perform Azure migrations knowing that critical systems and endpoints won’t be left behind.\nAs part of the cloud management capabilities in Operations Management Suite, Service Map enhances your ability to track dependencies in your hybrid cloud environment, making it easier to manage the complexity of multiple clouds.\nRead more about Service Map on its documentation page.\n",

      "text": "on Monday November 21, 2016 @05:00PM from the new-hardware-required dept. An anonymous reader quotes a report from The Verge: Netflix 4K streaming is finally heading to Windows PCs this week . While a number of TVs and set-top-boxes already support 4K Netflix streams, the PC has largely been left out of the high-quality streams due to piracy fears. Netflix is now supporting 4K streaming through Microsoft's Edge browser, but you'll need a new PC to actually make use of it. Netflix is only supporting 7th generation (Kaby Lake) Intel Core processors, and there aren't many laptops that actually support both the 4K display required and the new Intel processors. As a result, Microsoft is using the 4K Netflix support as a marketing effort for its Edge browser and to encourage people to upgrade their hardware to watch new episodes of the Gilmore Girls. It all might seem like a bit of a con, but it's largely the fault of DRM requirements from Hollywood studios and TV networks. Content providers have strict controls for 4K playback, so that streams can't be captured and redistributed illegally. The latest hardware decryption features simply aren't available on older Intel processors, and the new Kaby Lake chips now support 10-bit HEVC, a popular 4K video codec.",

      "text": "Tweet x To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video Microsoft's official logo is shown during the unveiling of the Windows 10 operating system last year at Roosevelt Field in New York. Reuters/Shannon Stapleton \nIt looks like Microsoft's next smartphone will not be the heavily-rumored Surface Phone, but one that the Redmond-based giant will work on with HP. \nRumor has it that the companies are teaming up for a Windows Phone set to be released in February 2017, presumably at the Mobile World Congress (MWC). \nThe timing suggests that the device will not be the Microsoft Surface Phone, but the successor of the HP Elite X3, which was released at the MWC early this year. \nAccording to Dr. Windows , Microsoft has announced the new Windows Phone during an event at Redmond. From the looks of it, the Microsoft Surface Phone is not coming anytime soon. \nIn the partnership, HP will reportedly shoulder most of the work such as putting together and selling the new Windows Phone while Microsoft will provide some resources to help HP with the development. Advertisement \nMicrosoft will also provide HP with the technology used in the Lumia devices such as the ClearBlack screens, Glance, double tap to wake, as well as advanced camera functionality. There is no information on the specifications and the features, though. Sponsored Watch Your Favorite Christian Films, 24/7. Click Here To Start Your Free Trial Today \nIt is unclear what this plan means for Microsoft Surface Phone, which was also expected to be released in spring next year. However, many reports have cast doubts on the device seeing the light of day. \nLast month, Mary Jo Foley of ZDNet stated that the device may not arrive at all. She said that, based on her contacts, \"If and when anything like a Surface Phone ends up materializing, it will likely be late 2017 or maybe even not until 2018.\" \nThat being said, the only Windows-powered device to expect next year is the HP Elite X3 successor, although MS Power User is not even sure if Windows fans will be able to wait that long for a Windows Phone. \nAfter all, it has been a year since Microsoft came out with one in the form of the Lumia 950. Whether or not Microsoft will push for the Surface Phone remains a mystery at the moment. ",

Credit: Julian Kelly/Google Mingis on Tech: From superfast SSDs to Bluetooth locks and solar shingles \nMicrosoft is accelerating its efforts to make a quantum computer as it looks to a future of computing beyond today's PCs and servers. \nMicrosoft has researched quantum computing for more than a decade. Now the company's goal is to put the theory to work and create actual hardware and software. \nTo that effect, Microsoft has put Todd Holmdahl -- who was involved in the development of Kinect, HoloLens, and Xbox -- to lead the effort to create quantum hardware and software. The company has also hired four prominent university professors to contribute to the company's research. \nQuantum computers, in theory, can significantly outperform today's supercomputers. The ultimate goal is to create universal quantum computers that can run all existing programs and conduct a wide range of calculations, much like today's computers. Early quantum computers can be used to run only a limited number of applications. \nCompanies like IBM, D-Wave and Google are researching quantum computing. IBM researchers have said a universal quantum computer is still decades out, so their focus is on creating hardware targeted at solving specific problems. \nD-Wave and IBM have created quantum computers based on different theories, and the companies have bashed each other's designs. D-Wave is trying to get more programmers to test its hardware so it can be used for more applications. \nIt's not known when Microsoft's quantum hardware will come out. Like others, Microsoft will have to make quantum circuits on which it can test applications and tackle issues like error correction, fault tolerance and gating. Practical hardware will be released only after a number of quantum computing issues are resolved. But Microsoft is already offering a simulation of quantum computers via a software toolkit . \nConventional computers represent data in the forms of 1s and 0s, but quantum computers are far more complex. At the center of quantum computers are qubits, which can harness the laws of quantum mechanics to achieve various states. A qubit can hold a one and zero simultaneously and expand to states beyond that. \nQubits allow quantum computers to calculate in parallel, making them more powerful than today's fastest computers. But qubits can be fragile, and interference from matter or electromagnetic radiation can wreck a calculation. \nResearchers at Microsoft are working on an entirely new topological quantum computer, which uses exotic materials to limit errors. There are still questions about the viability of such materials and outcomes, so it could take a long time for Microsoft to make practical quantum circuits. \nInterest in quantum computing is growing as it becomes difficult to manufacture smaller chips to speed up PCs and servers. Neuromorphic chips and quantum circuits represent a way to move computing into the future. \nMicrosoft's new hires include Leo Kouwenhoven, a professor at the Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands; Charles Marcus, a professor at the University of Copenhagen; Matthias Troyer, a professor at ETH Zurich; and David Reilly, a professor at the University of Sydney in Australia. All of them are retaining their professor titles.  ",

Computerworld | Nov 21, 2016 12:38   \nA 512-qubit processor used in D-Wave's quantum computers. Credit: D-Wave Systems Inc. Mingis on Tech: From superfast SSDs to Bluetooth locks and solar shingles \nQuantum computing sounds like something out of Star Trek, even when explained at the simplest of levels, but it's a field the tech sector is anxious to crack because of the enormous leap in computation power it offers. Google and IBM have spent a lot of money on their projects, and now Microsoft is bringing its considerable research facilities to bear. \nQuantum computing offers potential leaps forward in computing because unlike conventional transistors, operates on the binary level of 0 or 1, which translates to an on or off state for the transistors -- quantum computing uses quantum bits, or qubits , which can exist simultaneously in both 0 and 1 states. This means potentially representing enormous number of values simultaneously, which translates to much faster computation. \nQubits are very hard to work with because they are so easily destabilized. They exist in a very fragile, delicate state and any little bit of interference, such as a wave of light, vibration from heat, or even cosmic waves passing by, can destabilize them. That's why quantum computing has been so elusive for so long. The idea was first proposed in 1982 and is still vaporware. It was only recently that researchers were able to develop circuitry that detects these errors and corrects them. \nNeedless to say this is not for playing \"Angry Birds.\" It's for A.I., drug research and advanced climate simulations, where processing bits by 0 and 1 is simply too slow, even with today's supercomputers and algorithms. \nFor years Microsoft has invested in other quantum computing projects, but now it's launching its own. The project will be led by Todd Holmdahl, an engineer previously involved in the Kinect, Xbox and HoloLens teams. \nIn the announcement for the project, Holmdahl, now a corporate vice president, tempered expectations because quantum computing is so challenging. \n\"None of these things are a given. But you have to take some amount of risk in order to make a big impact in the world, and I think we’re at the point now that we have the opportunity to do that,” he said. \nTo show how serious it is, Microsoft has hired two heavyweights in the field of quantum computing to be a part of Holmdahl's team. Leo Kouwenhoven is a distinguished professor at Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands and was founding director of QuTech, the Advanced Research Center on Quantum Technologies. Charles Marcus is the Villum Kann Rasmussen Professor at the Niels Bohr Institute at the University of Copenhagen and director of the Danish National Research Foundation-sponsored Center for Quantum Devices. \nHolmdahl's group will be a part of the Artificial Intelligence and Research Group that Microsoft recently created . It brought several A.I. research groups under one very large umbrella -- more than 5,000 people are in the group -- under the leadership of Harry Shum, who is considered one of the top A.I. and robotics engineers in the world. \nThis article is published as part of the IDG Contributor Network.

      "text": "REUTERS/Baz Ratner \nBack in 2012, when Microsoft first announced its first-ever Surface, a Wall Street analyst asked Apple CEO Tim Cook if the Cupertino company would ever follow suit with a laptop/tablet hybrid of its own.\n“You can converge a toaster and a refrigerator, but you know those things are not going to be probably be pleasing to the user,\" Cook famously replied . \nFast forward to today, and Apple is selling no fewer than two versions of the iPad Pro , a tablet that looks a lot like a Microsoft Surface. Apple is even  billing it as a suitable replacement for a Windows laptop . \nThe irony hasn't escaped Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella. \n\"Three years ago, the two-in-one as a form factor was questioned. Does anybody need one? And now guess what, even our competition has decided that it's not a refrigerator and a toaster but it's actually a two-in-one,\" Nadella quipped this week to the Australian Financial Times .\n\nMicrosoft has actually been having a lot of fun at Apple's expense over the whole affair: This last summer, Microsoft ran TV commercials slamming Apple's claim  that an iPad Pro was as capable a laptop replacement as a Surface Pro 4 tablet.  \nREUTERS/Baz Ratner \n\nIn that same interview, Nadella indicated once more that Microsoft is all but out of the smartphone business, choosing instead to focus on apps and tools like Microsoft Office and its Enterprise Mobility Management, which work across iPhone and Android as well as Macs and PCs. \n\"We will continue to be in the phone market not as defined by today's market leaders, but by what it is that we can uniquely do in what is the most ultimate mobile device,\" Nadella told the Australian Financial Times. \nMicrosoft will soon be releasing the new Surface Studio , which has been generating a ton of buzz for its unique hybridization of the tablet and the PC. It raises the question: Will Apple follow Microsoft's lead once again? Or is the iPad Pro Apple's only refrigerator-toaster hybrid? \n \nNOW WATCH: The ‘Apple of China’ just unveiled a phone that’s more powerful and better looking than the iPhone \n",

      "text": "print Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella REUTERS/Baz Ratner \nBack in 2012, when Microsoft first announced its first-ever Surface, a Wall Street analyst asked Apple CEO Tim Cook if the Cupertino company would ever follow suit with a laptop/tablet hybrid of its own. \n“You can converge a toaster and a refrigerator, but you know those things are not going to be probably be pleasing to the user,\" Cook famously replied . \nFast forward to today, and Apple is selling no fewer than two versions of the iPad Pro , a tablet that looks a lot like a Microsoft Surface. Apple is even billing it as a suitable replacement for a Windows laptop . \nThe irony hasn't escaped Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella. \n\"Three years ago, the two-in-one as a form factor was questioned. Does anybody need one? And now guess what, even our competition has decided that it's not a refrigerator and a toaster but it's actually a two-in-one,\" Nadella quipped this week to the Australian Financial Times . Microsoft has actually been having a lot of fun at Apple's expense over the whole affair: This last summer, Microsoft ran TV commercials slamming Apple's claim that an iPad Pro was as capable a laptop replacement as a Surface Pro 4 tablet. \nMicrosoft Surface Pro 4 (left) and Apple iPad Pro (right) Matt Weinberger/Business Insider \nIn that same interview, Nadella indicated once more that Microsoft is all but out of the smartphone business, choosing instead to focus on apps and tools like Microsoft Office and its Enterprise Mobility Management, which work across iPhone and Android as well as Macs and PCs. \n\"We will continue to be in the phone market not as defined by today's market leaders, but by what it is that we can uniquely do in what is the most ultimate mobile device,\" Nadella told the Australian Financial Times. \nMicrosoft will soon be releasing the new Surface Studio , which has been generating a ton of buzz for its unique hybridization of the tablet and the PC. It raises the question: Will Apple follow Microsoft's lead once again? Or is the iPad Pro Apple's only refrigerator-toaster hybrid?",

      "text": "Originally Posted by Omega X You don't have to believe it. Just wait and watch what they do. So far, we've seen them: - Join the Linux foundation - Open sourced a NUMBER of back end components like the Edge JS engine, .NET core, and PowerShell. - Ported Visual Studio to Mac where many OSS developers like to work - Embrace a number of OSS software across its properties - Bring BASH to Windows - Brought SQL Server to LINUX - Put Office and Outlook on Android Microsoft can't tie all sectors down to a vertical stack anymore. The alternatives are too good and there's very good competition. If Microsoft's software is only on Microsoft's platforms that very few use, then its a waste of time and money to keep developing them. SO, what do they do? Break them down into things that the other platforms can use individually. That is true, and it doesn't stop with just Outlook and Office, there is a huge array of Microsoft Apps that works standalone in Google Store https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Microsoft+Corporation&hl=en it's good, at least they (people in charge at Microsoft) recognizes it's a losing battle if they don't go with the flow. something BlackBerry should have learned when it was ahead of the game, but now they are playing catch-up. Microsoft can at least financially hang in there, even if they are also hanging in there. who knows overtime they might win up some customers back to the windows platform.",

      "text": "Microsoft Spends Big to Build a Computer Out of Science Fiction By The New York Times November 21, 2016 Todd Holmdahl will direct Microsoft's quantum computing efforts. Credit: Ian C. Bates / The New York Times \nMicrosoft is dedicating significant funding and manpower to its efforts related to quantum computing. Microsoft's decision to move on from pure research to a legitimate effort to build a working prototype highlights a global competition among technology companies to develop the world's first quantum computing system. \nHowever, Microsoft has chosen a different path than its competitors in the quest for quantum computing technologies. Microsoft's approach is based on \"braiding\" particles known as anyons, which exist in just two dimensions, to form the building blocks of a supercomputer based on subatomic particles. However, researchers acknowledge barriers still remain to building practical quantum machines, including those at the level of basic physics and in developing new kinds of software to exploit the qualities of quantum bits (qubits). Microsoft researcher Todd Holmdahl says the company is close to designing the basic qubit building block and it is ready to begin building a complete computer. \"Once we get the first qubit figured out, we have a road map that allows us to go to thousands of qubits in a rather straightforward way,\" Holmdahl says. \nThe Microsoft approach, known as topological quantum computing, follows scientific advances made in the last two years that give its scientists confidence the company will be able to create more stable qubits. \nFrom The New York Times View Full Article – May Require Registration \n\nAbstracts Copyright © 2016 Information Inc. , Bethesda, Maryland, USA Sign In for Full Access User Name",

      "title": "Microsoft Rumored To Include x86 on ARM64 Emulation In Windows 10 'Redstone 3'",
      "text": "by Rob Williams   Microsoft Rumored To Include x86 on ARM64 Emulation In Windows 10 'Redstone 3' \nEach new \"Redstone\" release of Windows 10 is notable for a handful of reasons, but Redstone 3 could include one of the most ambitious features yet: x86 on ARM64 emulation. What that ultimately means is that ARM-based devices running Windows 10 Mobile , such as the Lumia 950 XL , could see an immediate boost of supported applications. \nx86 emulation could prove extremely important for ARM-based Windows devices, as it would allow users to run the same applications they're used to running on their x86 desktops and notebooks. If the emulation works well, it could dramatically bolster the number of apps Microsoft's mobile platforms could run, essentially giving it the best of both worlds -- especially when paired with Continuum . \nWhile Adobe Photoshop might suddenly run on an ARM platform, it doesn't mean that it'd run well, or that all of its functionality would work as expected. Simpler apps, such as the FileZilla FTP client or Sublime Text (just to name two), should work with minor issues as both are simpler apps. \nBut that's reading a bit too far into the future, as this feature itself is still a year away. For that reason, Microsoft is not going to be targeting the enterprise with this feature, although that could change over time if the performance nears native x86 performance. \nInterestingly, the codename for this functionality is \"Colbalt\", which Mojang fans will recognize, as it's the name of one of the developer's games. Microsoft owns Mojang, and thus its major Windows 10 builds have taken the Redstone nomenclature. Let's see if Microsoft somehow wraps the name \"Scrolls\" into an upcoming feature.",

      "text": "SEATTLE -- Microsoft's Australian subsidiary will start disclosing the amount of tax it pays in Australia, opting in to a government transparency program aimed at shedding light on the shadowy world of global tax avoidance, the Australian Financial Review reported.\nAustralia's government is one of the most aggressive in a global crackdown on multinational corporations that avoid taxes by stashing income in tax havens.\nA statute recently enacted there sets up a voluntary reporting scheme in which companies publicly disclose their profit and income tax paid to Australia, \"to highlight those that are paying their fair share and to encourage all businesses not to engage in aggressive tax avoidance.\"\nMicrosoft Australia will be the first local arm of a multinational technology firm to join the program, the Australian Financial Review reported Friday. Microsoft declined to comment. Microsoft, like many multinational companies, has spent decades building a corporate structure designed to minimize taxes by funneling revenue to tax havens, including Singapore, Ireland and Bermuda. A portion of that structure is being scrutinized by the Internal Revenue Service, part of a contentious audit that has wound up in federal court in Seattle.\nThe company, headquartered just outside Seattle, as of June 30 had accumulated more than $124 billion in income, untaxed in the U.S., that it deems permanently reinvested in other countries.\nMicrosoft says the sum would be subject to $39.3 billion in U.S. taxes if it were repatriated. That disclosure indicates that some income generated by Microsoft's overseas operations is subject to a tax of as low as 4 percent, lower than the going rate in any of Microsoft's major markets.\nAustralia's top corporate tax rate is 30 percent. The U.S. has the highest corporate rate in the developed world, at 35 percent, though many multinational companies actually pay a lower effective rate.\nThe scope of the figures Microsoft will report under the new Australian disclosure program likely won't be a surprise.\nIn December, Australian tax authorities published tax data for more than 1,800 companies, showing Microsoft paid about $31 million Australian dollars to the treasury during the 2013-14 tax year there.\nThat sum would be higher if Microsoft didn't route the vast majority of its sales to Australian consumers through its Singapore unit.\nBill Sample, Microsoft's tax chief, told Australian lawmakers at a hearing last year that just 5 percent of its sales to Australian consumers during the company's 2014 fiscal year were subject to Australian income taxes. The rest were technically made by a Singapore-based entity.\nA structure similar to Microsoft's Australia-Singapore arrangement helped the company avoid paying up to $143 million a year in U.K. taxes by attributing sales to British customers to an Irish unit, the London-based Sunday Times reported earlier this year.\nThe Australian disclosure regime follows guidelines released last year by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development recommending that companies disclose to governments where they pay their taxes and generate income.\nThe recommendations from the OECD, a policy coordinating group for developed nations, are designed to compel tax regulators to ensure that corporate income taxes more closely align with actual economic activity.\n(c)2016 The Seattle Times\nVisit The Seattle Times at www.seattletimes.com\n ",

      "text": "Microsoft is opening itself up a bit more. \nThis will likely have long-term implications. \nWe can use long-term options to bet small. I thought the concept of open innovation was just theory. When a behemoth, Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ), just took another step closer to fully embrace openness , I was surprised. Open innovation is the concept of freely allowing access to knowledge resources and other factors that can benefit a firm. However, this form of innovation can be described as collaborative innovation. Collaborative innovation allows firms such as Microsoft to pursue innovation outside of its boundaries. According to the article, it appears that Microsoft used to be tightly held. For instance, no one would have expected Microsoft to have Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) on its .NET Foundation technical steering committee. This strategic alliance can be beneficial for both firms as the learning and knowledge transfer take place between both companies. Since both companies tend to compete in the same space, the strategic alliance can be considered a form of related diversification, where the synergies between both companies should be realized. The only negative thing to worry about is the size of both companies could hinder the progress if the internal cultures in the alliance do not mesh (I can cite hundreds of academic studies on this paragraph alone, but it will confuse you more than help you). Typically, to stay relevant, companies need to keep innovating their business model. Most of the time, it is not feasible because the costs of R&D and the short product lifecycle make consistent innovations difficult to pursue. Jim Zemlin's quote says it all: \nThere's just too much software to be written for any organization to it by themselves. We need to collaborate on these things. It appears that Nadella's leadership is responsible for this organizational shift. So far, under his reign, the stock has nearly doubled. However, we do not want to concern ourselves with the stock price since it is a short-term indicator.   Yahoo Finance The difference in language between Nadella and Ballmer is of a different tone. Ballmer was quoted saying how much of a cancer Linux was. Note that openness is a form of business model innovation. Business model innovation generally leads to enhanced stock prices . Ultimately, I do believe the shift towards a more open business model will positively affect Microsoft in the long run due to the reduction in R&D spending . However, with the positives of openness, there is the dark side. Being extremely open can result in too much knowledge transfer from Microsoft and result in the loss of core competencies and even loss of control over the business. What Microsoft has done was slowly build trust with Linux. It did that by changing the organizational culture within the company. Unless the organizational culture is changed, an alliance will not be accepted by the firms involved. This is similar to the \" not made here \" syndrome. Recall Ballmer and Gates were not fans of being open. Thus, a balancing act is required, however, since Microsoft is competing in a high velocity environment . Openness has its advantage due to the quicker time to market versus being closed. Hence, my belief that more openness will continue to benefit Microsoft. Options It is hard to predict where the stock will be over the long term. For those of you who held the stock since its 1999 high, I understand your frustration. That is why an alternative to purchasing the stock with your hard-earned money is using options to bet small. Long-term in the options world is a six-month time frame. Thus, the June 2017 monthly options satisfy this criterion. Naked Call Buying You do not want too far out of the money. Looking at the current open interest can help you decided which option to pick. We will want to buy the options with the largest open interest, which is currently at the 65 strike (It is a myth that selling an option is safer. Buying and selling are equally risky). The thinking is that as the stock moves higher and the open interest increases, it confirms that the stock will continue to trend higher. The downside to this strategy is that annoying theta decay that eats away at your potential profit. However, the beauty of the long-term option is the time decay does not take effect until one to two months before expiration. Plus, your risk is limited. 1 option controlling 100 shares will cost you approximately 200 dollars versus buying 100 shares of the actual stock at 60 dollars a share. Debit Spread I prefer debit spread over credit spread since the loss is a lot less. For this strategy, you want one leg to be out of the money and one leg to be in the money. The reason for this is to increase your odds of success. If you do a debit spread where both legs are out of the money, then you indirectly did a pure directional play. Because the debit spread will drastically slow down the rate of time decay, you will be more likely to make a profit if the stock hits 65 dollars on expiration. Because of Microsoft's tendency to have moves of around 50 cents, you are better off using a debit spread than a naked call.  ",

Microsoft CEO laughs at Apple for making iPad Pro like Surface 0 \nTechnically Incorrect offers a slightly twisted take on the tech that's taken over our lives. Enlarge Image Photo by Stephen Brashear, Getty Images \nWords can come back to haunt you. \nSometimes, they even slap you about the chops while sniggering: \"Heh, heh, heh.\" \nAnd so it is that Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has taken some of Tim Cook's words and gently wafted them right back at him. \nIn an interview with the Australian Financial Review , Nadella mused on the increasing success of the Surface. \nHe painted it as an example of Microsoft's risk-taking nature. He also contrasted this attitude with that of his competitors. \n\"Three years ago, the two-in-one as a form factor was questioned,\" he said. \"Does anybody need one? And now guess what, even our competition has decided that it's not a refrigerator and a toaster, but it's actually a two-in-one.\" \nActually, it was four years ago. Should you not be familiar with the subtext here, Cook was on a 2012 earnings call when he mused about hybrid computers. He said converging two different products involved too many trade-offs. \nThen he added , quite immortally: \"You can converge a toaster and a refrigerator, but those things are probably not going be pleasing to the user.\" \nThis may not have been quite right. Indeed, in its August launch of the iPad Pro, Apple expressly claimed that it was a computer. Which confused a lot of people, as Apple had always insisted it was a tablet.

Sorry There was an error emailing this page. \nA superconducting quantum chip with nine qubits. Credit: Julian Kelly/Google 26% off Western Digital 2TB My Passport Ultra Portable External Hard Drive -... \nMicrosoft is accelerating its efforts to make a quantum computer as it looks to a future of computing beyond today's PCs and servers. \nMicrosoft has researched quantum computing for more than a decade. Now the company's goal is to put the theory to work and create actual hardware and software. \nTo that effect, Microsoft has put Todd Holmdahl -- who was involved in the development of Kinect, HoloLens, and Xbox -- to lead the effort to create quantum hardware and software. The company has also hired four prominent university professors to contribute to the company's research. [ Best Bluetooth speakers: We'll help you find the best wireless speakers for pairing with your smartphone or tablet—whatever your budget, and whatever music floats your boat. ] \nQuantum computers, in theory, can significantly outperform today's supercomputers. The ultimate goal is to create universal quantum computers that can run all existing programs and conduct a wide range of calculations, much like today's computers. Early quantum computers can be used to run only a limited number of applications. \nCompanies like IBM, D-Wave, and Google are researching quantum computing. IBM researchers have said a universal quantum computer is still decades out, so their focus is on creating hardware targeted at solving specific problems. \nD-Wave and IBM have created quantum computers based on different theories, and the companies have bashed each other's designs. D-Wave is trying to get more programmers to test its hardware so it can be used for more applications. \nIt's not known when Microsoft's quantum hardware will come out. Like others, Microsoft will have to make quantum circuits on which it can test applications and tackle issues like error correction, fault tolerance, and gating. Practical hardware will be released only after a number of quantum computing issues are resolved. But Microsoft is already offering a simulation of quantum computers via a software toolkit . \nConventional computers represent data in the forms of 1s and 0s, but quantum computers are far more complex. At the center of quantum computers are qubits, which can harness the laws of quantum mechanics to achieve various states. A qubit can hold a one and zero simultaneously and expand to states beyond that. \nQubits allow quantum computers to calculate in parallel, making them more powerful than today's fastest computers. But qubits can be fragile, and interference from matter or electromagnetic radiation can wreck a calculation. \nResearchers at Microsoft are working on an entirely new topological quantum computer, which uses exotic materials to limit errors. There are still questions about the viability of such materials and outcomes, so it could take a long time for Microsoft to make practical quantum circuits. \nInterest in quantum computing is growing as it becomes difficult to manufacture smaller chips to speed up PCs and servers. Neuromorphic chips and quantum circuits represent a way to move computing into the future. \nMicrosoft's new hires include Leo Kouwenhoven, a professor at the Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands; Charles Marcus, a professor at the University of Copenhagen; Matthias Troyer, a professor at ETH Zurich; and David Reilly, a professor at the University of Sydney in Australia. All of them are retaining their professor titles. Related:",

Administrators entering this brave, new world of virtualization will need to know the basics of containers -- and how they fit with Docker Datacenter, the tool for creating and maintaining Docker hosts and containers. Containers are typically the domain of application developers, but the operations team -- the ones who build and maintain the infrastructure for developers -- can benefit from learning how Docker Datacenter and containerized apps fit in the data center. Docker and Microsoft Windows \nDocker is an open source technology that uses OS virtualization to support lightweight, isolated application environments. For example, imagine that a developer needs to test a PHP/MySQL web application for compatibility with several different versions of PHP, MySQL and Apache web server. Traditionally, the developer would ask the IT operations staff to build separate virtual machines that contain each server version. This takes a lot of effort, time, computing power and disk space. It's not very agile. \nBecause Docker virtualizes each application along with its dependencies, you can spawn a number of different containers -- each running target app versions -- in a matter of seconds . Moreover, because Docker images are defined in text-based source code, developers can apply version control and rollback to Docker images. In other words, if there's a problem with a container build, the developer can edit the image script and redeploy it instead of having to rebuild a VM. VMs vs. containers VMs are much thicker than containers because each VM needs its own guest OS to run (Figure 1). One downside to Windows Server containers is that they present a security hazard because Docker containers share the host operating system's kernel, while each VM has its own kernel. Figure 1: Virtual machines take up more space because they need a guest operating system to run. Containers don't consume as much space because each container shares the host's operating system. Microsoft developed Hyper-V containers to give each container its own kernel, adding a layer of security. Organizations that require high security and want to use containers should deploy their apps in a VM instead of a container. Managing containers with Docker Datacenter Docker Datacenter is a container as a service that makes it easier to design, build and maintain highly available clusters of Docker hosts and containers. Similar to what Microsoft aims to do with Azure Stack , Docker Datacenter brings the functionality that was developed in the cloud to the on-premises data center. The following components make up the Docker Datacenter stack: Free and open source host operating systems -- Ubuntu Linux is the most common choice. Docker engine -- This component is also called the container runtime environment. Docker Universal Control Plane -- This is the clustering engine that makes containerized apps highly available. Docker Swarm -- This is the orchestration engine that lets containers \"float\" between multiple Docker hosts for high availability and agility. Docker Trusted Registry -- This is a catalog system that makes it easy to manage and distribute Docker images. Administrators access the Docker Datacenter management and monitoring capabilities through a web portal. How Docker and open source will affect the Windows admin Docker Datacenter is a container as a service that makes it easier to design, build and maintain highly available clusters of Docker hosts and containers. Microsoft is investing more in open source development, including competing operating systems and application development frameworks. The introduction of .NET Core means organizations can run proprietary Microsoft software, such as SQL Server, on Linux servers. In addition, the role of containers in Windows Server 2016 enables IT teams deploy Windows applications in Windows Server and/or Hyper-V Docker containers. It would benefit Windows administrators to learn how to apply Docker technology in the data center. To see how popular Windows Server in Docker is, go to the Docker Hub -- Docker's public container image gallery – and run a search for Windows Server. This will show how many Docker images and applications are available. Deploying a Docker Datacenter environment in Azure \nDocker has a public cloud service called Docker Cloud, but a Windows-based shop with an Azure subscription can host the Docker infrastructure in Azure. Deploying a Docker Datacenter cluster via Azure makes sense for businesses that don't want to invest in on-premises physical hardware to support these clusters. It takes four steps to deploy Docker Cloud from the Microsoft Azure web portal (Figure 2). Figure 2: Administrators can deploy a Docker Datacenter cluster from the Azure web portal after installing a template. Click New to start the Azure deployment. Locate the Docker Datacenter Azure Resource Manage template in the Azure Marketplace. Click Deploy to start the deployment process. Fill out the form, give Azure about 20 minutes, and the Docker Datacenter cluster should be ready. \nA valid Docker Datacenter license is required to deploy a cluster in Azure; Docker offers a free 30-day evaluation. Azure has its own cloud offering for Windows Server containers called the Azure Container Service .

      "text": "Microsoft Releases First Office Online Server Update \nThe company doles out new features and performance enhancements while pledging better forward update visibility. Office Online Server , a version of the browser-based Office Online application suite that businesses can host out of their own data centers, is getting its first major update since Microsoft released the server edition six months ago. Office Online Server essentially allows organizations to grant their users access to web-based versions of Word, PowerPoint, Excel and OneNote that are delivered from their own servers instead of Microsoft's Azure Cloud infrastructure. The software can be coupled with Exchange Server 2016 and Skype for Business Server 2016 to practically enable advanced content sharing using the browser-based Outlook client and remote presentations. The November update includes a performance bump to the software's co-authoring feature and picture resizing capabilities in Word. Now with improved drag-and-drop support, users should notice that creating tables in Word and PowerPoint is a less arduous affair. PowerPoint also gains improved inline spell check and copy/past operations.Excel users can also now embed Power View sheets and see graphics in the software's viewer. Finally, the latest version of Office Online Server includes HTML markup that more closely adheres to the W3C's accessibility standards.Administrators, meanwhile, will want to set some time aside to roll out the new features to their users. Unlike the customary in-line upgrades the company typically releases, the Office team cautioned that customers \"must uninstall the previous version of OOS [Office Online Server] to install the November release,\" in a blog post . \"Moving forward, we have a release planned every four months to ensure that we can continuously deliver new value to OOS users. We will only support the latest version of OOS with bug fixes and security patches, available via the Microsoft Updates.\" As for those future releases, Microsoft pledged to deliver most of the features present in the browser version's continuously-updated cloud counterpart on a regular basis. The company also said it would provide \"a more detailed timeline\" indicating when those updates will arrive by early December. On Nov. 21 Microsoft announced it had enabled new business intelligence (BI) capabilities in Excel Online with updates to SharePoint Server 2016 BI. In a separate blog post, the company explained that \"Excel Services has evolved from an optional add-on application for SharePoint Server 2007 to an inherent part of Office Online Server for on-premises. In this newest 2016 release, Excel Services capabilities are moving to Office Online Server (which used to be called Office Web Apps Server) and as a result Excel Services is being replaced with Office Online Server.\" By switching from Excel Services to Office Online Server, organizations can access Excel JavaScript (application programming interfaces) and users can tap more Excel features, including number formatting options and Pivot Table filter search. Customers can also dole out access to basic Excel BI functionality, including access to external data, using standard SharePoint client access licenses. Finally, Excel's BI capabilities inherit many of same upgrades and enhancements made to their Office 365 equivalents, assured Microsoft.",

      "title": "Microsoft Surface Studio: A Gigantic Surface Pro 4 On Steroids?",
      "text": "Daryl Deino \nLast month, Microsoft introduced the Surface Studio, a gigantic Mac-like product that you can draw on. It’s the “desktop” version of the Surface Pro 4 and Surface Book. According to MS Power User , the Surface Studio, which sells from $2,999 to $4,199, has just started to ship to some lucky (and perhaps rich) customers. \n“If you’re lucky enough to have purchased a Surface Studio shortly after launch, check your emails, Microsoft has apparently begun shipping those pre-orders this week. There are reports that some early purchasers have received an email notifying them that their package has been processed and will be out for delivery the week of November 21 (this week).” \nReviews have started pouring in for the Surface Studio, and they are mostly positive, if a little mixes. Engadget thinks that the Surface Studio proves that desktops can still be cool. <noscript><iframe width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/HyDlKDa48rU?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></noscript> \n“The Surface Studio is both familiar and new. It empowers us to work the way we always have, while also giving us entirely new modes of productivity. Personally, that’s a philosophy I can get behind — especially when you contrast it with Apple’s habit of pushing consumers down new roads that aren’t necessarily improvements (hello, dongle life).” \nThe article adds that the Surface Studio’s high price and lack of expandability could make it a difficult sell for a market that is already a niche one. Digital Arts Online has a lot of good things to say about the new Surface Studio, but they aren’t sure if it the perfect device for professional artists. \n“I’m obviously reserving judgement until we get a review unit into the Digital Arts studio to test. From what I’ve seen, it’s a definite step-up from the iMac – but if you’re serious about drawing you might want to consider paying extra for a desktop (or laptop) and Wacom’s Cintiq 27QHD.” \nThe article especially praises the 4,500 x 3,000 pixel 28-inch screen, but says the color capabilities aren’t outstanding. One of the commenters below the article isn’t sure Microsoft’s new device can succeed in the marketplace. \n“The Surface Studio is great looking and a rather show of machine. It does not offer value for money. A real workhorse would be the Cintiq and a separate PC,” claims Even Fotis. \nHowever, there are a lot of people excited about the Microsoft Surface Studio on Twitter. I want to go to the Microsoft Store and use the Surface Studio. Hmmm….. \n— D.J. Kirkland (@OhHeyDJ) November 20, 2016 Oh I want the Microsoft's Surface Studio soo much! #SurfaceStudio https://t.co/nBhtt9bcOz \n— Jakub Puchalski (@jakubpuchalski) November 18, 2016 \nIn addition to releasing what many think is the most interesting desktop system in years, Microsoft has also updated its Surface Book. While Microsoft is scheduled to release the Surface Book 2 next spring, they have given the higher-end versions of the Surface Book some slight, but important updates. \n“Microsoft has only made two internal changes: the graphics processor has been bumped up to a Nvidia GeForce GTX 965M with 2GB GDDR5 memory and the battery has been increased in capacity to provide an estimated 16 hours of stamina, four hours more than last year’s model,” points out columnist Dan Seifert of The Verge , adding that Microsoft was forced to adjust the base of the updated Surface Book, which is now heavier than last year’s model Microsoft has made some small (but important) changes to the latest Surface Book. [Image by Daryl Deino] \nWhile some people are still upset that the original Surface Book arrived with several bugs when released last year, Forbes is impressed with the 2016 Surface Book. Columnist Ewan Spence believes that Microsoft has taken another direction and has the luxury to make a great machine for power users. Spence notes that the updated Book has excellent battery life and graphics horsepower. \nMicrosoft still has a way to go before they make the Surface Studio and the Surface Book as successful as their flagship device, the Surface Pro 4. Given their resources and popularity at the moment, the Surface Studio and Surface Book can become big hits in 2017. \n[Featured Image by Amy Sussman/AP Images]",

      "text": "\nMicrosoft recently launched the Security Program for Azure IoT , which helps customers understand, manage and deploy IoT faster and with full confidence that their devices, assets and data are secure. Microsoft also offered guidance on the security built into Azure IoT Suite and Azure IoT Hub. Today, they announced a security Azure IoT feature: IP filtering.\nThis new feature enables customers to instruct IoT Hub to only accept connections from certain IP addresses, to reject certain IP addresses or a combination of both. These rules apply any time a device or a back-end application is connecting on any supported protocols (currently AMQP, MQTT, AMQP/WS, MQTT/WS, HTTP/1). Any application from an IPv4 address that matches a rejecting IP rule receives an unauthorized 401 status code without specific mention of the IP rule in the message. And this filter allows maximum 10 rules each rejecting or accepting an individual IPv4 address or a subnet using the CIDR-notation format.\n",

      "title": "Quick Tip: Add an Item to the Microsoft Edge Reading List",
      "text": "Advertisement \nOne of the most popular read it later services is Pocket. \nThe idea behind the service is to be able to save content you want to read later in one central place and then go back to it when you have time to sit down and read it at your leisure. \nIt works well but one downfall of course is that it is yet another service to sign up for and for many regular users that level of service is simply not needed. \nWhen Microsoft released Microsoft Edge with Windows 10 last year it had a basic option to add websites and pages to a Reading List that you could then use to come back and read the content at a later time. Over the last two Feature Updates for Windows 10 that tool has become much more reliable and is a viable option for users who do not need full fledged read it later services. \nOne additional benefit of using the Microsoft Edge Reading List is that if you use the same Microsoft Account across multiple devices then your Reading List items will sync across all of those machines. No additional account needed. \nUsing the Reading List in Microsoft Edge is the same process as marking a site as a Favorite with one small deviation to select Reading List instead of Favorites. \nOnce you are browsing a website/page you want to save here is how you add that item. \nNear the top right of the Microsoft Edge browser window look for the star icon. When you hover over that it will turn yellow - just click/tap that to open the next dialog box for adding Favorites/Reading List items. \nNext make sure Reading List (1) is selected and then click/tap Add (2) to place this page in your Reading List. \nIf you want to retrieve your Reading List in Microsoft Edge just go back up to the top right hand corner of the Edge browser window and look in the tool bar for the Microsoft Edge Hub icon. It looks like a left justification icon from a word processing program. \nThe Microsoft Edge Hub is where you will find a tab interfaced for accessing your Favorites, Reading List, History, and Downloads. \nTo clean up and remove items from your Reading List that are no longer needed just open the Microsoft Edge Hub, select the Reading List tab and then Right Click the entry you want to remove. Select Delete and it will be removed from this devices and others it is synched on through your Microsoft Account. \nAs I mentioned earlier, the Reading List in Microsoft Edge is synched to any device on which you use Windows 10 and the same Microsoft Account. \nOn Microsoft Edge Mobile syncing of Favorites and Reading Lists items is turned on by default so to retrieve your Reading List items just open the browser; tap the ellipsis menu (the three dots) in the lower right corner and select Reading List . \nNOTE: This is the same menu you would use to add items to the Reading List using Microsoft Edge Mobile - just tap the Add to reading list menu entry. \nHere is the Reading List on Microsoft Edge Mobile: \nSo, is the Microsoft Edge Reading List sufficient for your own read it later activities? \nBut, wait...there's probably more so be sure to follow me on Twitter and Google+ .",

      "text": "Everything you need to know about Microsoft's Windows 10 VR headset It's the cheaper alternative to Microsoft HoloLens   @lilyhulk \nDuring the Microsoft Surface event, GM Megan Saunders stated \"powerful and affordable VR is coming to you.\" With that, the company then announced VR hardware 'accessories' for the upcoming Windows 10 Creator's Edition software update. \nMore information will be revealed during a December event, but here's everything we know so far about Microsoft's Windows 10 VR headset so far... Microsoft VR: Design and specs \nFurther details about the new, cheaper VR headset were not released - it doesn't even have a name beyond 'accessory.' During the demos, it seemed to be untethered and running Windows 10. It also doesn't seem to be directly a Microsoft device - rather the companies will be running the software provided by Microsoft. \nHowever from the video released by the company, the headset appears to be tethered and the person is using a large controller to navigate the interface. \nMust read: Everything you need to know about Microsoft HoloLens \nThere's no headset specs so far but we do know the minimum PC requirements as discovered by The Verge . Apparently your computer will need 4GB of RAM, USB 3.0 port, graphics card with DirectX 12 support and four CPU cores, including dual-core processors with hyperthreading. \nThis is great for people who don't want to spend a ton of money on a beastly machine - which is what's needed for Oculus Rift and HTC Vive. \nBut there's no telling what you'll be getting in terms of VR experiences. With this power, you could be looking at apps and games on the same level as mobile VR, or slightly better depending on the headset's own specs. Microsoft VR: Price and release date \nThe company is working with HP, Dell, Lenovo, Asus and Acer to launch $299 VR/mixed reality headsets to work with Creator's Edition PC's. \nMicrosoft's push into VR is likely a move to make mixed reality devices more accessible since the developer's kit for HoloLens is so ridiculously high at $3,000. There's no actual release date yet but we're expecting next spring when the Windows 10 update hits. \nMicrosoft made its augmented reality headset available to buy in the US and Canada back in August allowing anyone with a Microsoft account and a US/Canada address to buy one, then released it in the UK in October. With the new partnerships, it can in a way, add affordable headsets to its lineup. However it's still early - we'll have to wait and see just how good this accessory really is next year.

      "text": "View Comments Pic: Reuters Microsoft (MSFT.O) will still allow LinkedIn's (LNKD.N) rivals access to its software and give hardware makers the option of installing other services to try to win EU approval for its takeover of the U.S. firm, people familiar with the matter said. The U.S. software company submitted its LinkedIn concessions to the European Commission last week after the EU competition enforcer expressed concerns about the $26 billion deal, Microsoft's biggest ever acquisition. The offer aims to show that Microsoft will not favor LinkedIn at the expense of rivals, the people said, in an attempt to address a key concern for regulators. Both the Commission and Microsoft, which have not provided details of the offer, declined to comment on Monday. The EU is now seeking feedback from rivals and customers before deciding whether to accept the concessions, demand more or open an investigation which can take up to five months. They have until Tuesday to do so. The Commission is scheduled to rule on the deal by Dec. 6. Professional social networks which have access to Microsoft's API (application program interface) will continue to have this facility once LinkedIn becomes part of the company, the people said. The other key element of the company's concessions is the option for computer hardware makers to install either LinkedIn or rival networks on computers, indicating that the company is keen to avoid any suggestion of packaging products to crush competitors. Microsoft's website shows it has software deals with hardware makers such as Dell, HP (HPE.N), Lenovo (0992.HK), Acer (2353.TW) and Huawei [HWT.UL], among others. The Commission has fined Microsoft more than 2.2 billion euros ($2.3 billion) over the past decade for various infringements, one of them being the tying of some products to its Windows operating system to stifle competition. LinkedIn generates the bulk of its $3 billion annual revenue from job hunters and recruiters who pay a monthly fee to post resumes and connect with people. - Reuters",

Sorry There was an error emailing this page. \nA superconducting quantum chip with nine qubits. Credit: Julian Kelly/Google How sound masking helps reduce office noise \nMicrosoft is accelerating its efforts to make a quantum computer as it looks to a future of computing beyond today's PCs and servers. \nMicrosoft has researched quantum computing for more than a decade. Now the company's goal is to put the theory to work and create actual hardware and software. \nTo that effect, Microsoft has put Todd Holmdahl -- who was involved in the development of Kinect, HoloLens, and Xbox -- to lead the effort to create quantum hardware and software. The company has also hired four prominent university professors to contribute to the company's research. \nQuantum computers, in theory, can significantly outperform today's supercomputers. The ultimate goal is to create universal quantum computers that can run all existing programs and conduct a wide range of calculations, much like today's computers. Early quantum computers can be used to run only a limited number of applications. \nCompanies like IBM, D-Wave, and Google are researching quantum computing. IBM researchers have said a universal quantum computer is still decades out, so their focus is on creating hardware targeted at solving specific problems. \nD-Wave and IBM have created quantum computers based on different theories, and the companies have bashed each other's designs. D-Wave is trying to get more programmers to test its hardware so it can be used for more applications. \nIt's not known when Microsoft's quantum hardware will come out. Like others, Microsoft will have to make quantum circuits on which it can test applications and tackle issues like error correction, fault tolerance, and gating. Practical hardware will be released only after a number of quantum computing issues are resolved. But Microsoft is already offering a simulation of quantum computers via a software toolkit . \nConventional computers represent data in the forms of 1s and 0s, but quantum computers are far more complex. At the center of quantum computers are qubits, which can harness the laws of quantum mechanics to achieve various states. A qubit can hold a one and zero simultaneously and expand to states beyond that. \nQubits allow quantum computers to calculate in parallel, making them more powerful than today's fastest computers. But qubits can be fragile, and interference from matter or electromagnetic radiation can wreck a calculation. \nResearchers at Microsoft are working on an entirely new topological quantum computer, which uses exotic materials to limit errors. There are still questions about the viability of such materials and outcomes, so it could take a long time for Microsoft to make practical quantum circuits. \nInterest in quantum computing is growing as it becomes difficult to manufacture smaller chips to speed up PCs and servers. Neuromorphic chips and quantum circuits represent a way to move computing into the future. \nMicrosoft's new hires include Leo Kouwenhoven, a professor at the Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands; Charles Marcus, a professor at the University of Copenhagen; Matthias Troyer, a professor at ETH Zurich; and David Reilly, a professor at the University of Sydney in Australia. All of them are retaining their professor titles. To comment on this article and other Network World content, visit our Facebook page or our Twitter stream . Related:",

      "text": "Microsoft will still allow LinkedIn’s rivals access to its software and give hardware makers the option of installing other services to try to win EU approval for its takeover of the U.S. firm, people familiar with the matter said.\nThe U.S. software company submitted its LinkedIn concessions to the European Commission last week after the EU competition enforcer expressed concerns about the $26 billion deal, Microsoft’s biggest ever acquisition.\nThe offer aims to show that Microsoft will not favour LinkedIn at the expense of rivals, the people said, in an attempt to address a key concern for regulators. Both the Commission and Microsoft, which have not provided details of the offer, declined to comment on Monday.\nThe EU is now seeking feedback from rivals and customers before deciding whether to accept the concessions, demand more or open an investigation which can take up to five months. They have until Tuesday to do so. The Commission is scheduled to rule on the deal by Dec. 6.\nProfessional social networks which have access to Microsoft’s API (application programme interface) will continue to have this facility once LinkedIn becomes part of the company, the people said.\nThe other key element of the company’s concessions is the option for computer hardware makers to install either LinkedIn or rival networks on computers, indicating that the company is keen to avoid any suggestion of packaging products to crush competitors.\nMicrosoft’s website shows it has software deals with hardware makers such as Dell, HP, Lenovo, Acer and Huawei, among others. The Commission has fined Microsoft more than 2.2 billion euros ($2.3 billion) over the past decade for various infringements, one of them being the tying of some products to its Windows operating system to stifle competition.\nLinkedIn generates the bulk of its $3 billion annual revenue from job hunters and recruiters who pay a monthly fee to post resumes and connect with people.\nReuters \nThe post Microsoft may give concessions in software and hardware to win EU approval appeared first on Tech2 .",

      "title": "Microsoft Reveals Minimum PC Hardware Requirements For Upcoming Windows 10 VR Platform",
      "text": "11/21/16 AT 10:25 PM Close \nMicrosoft recently announced that it will be adding virtual reality support for all Windows 10 PC next year in the Creators Update in 2017 as it prepares to launch its own VR platform. In light of this, Microsoft appears to have settled on some of the PC minimum hardware requirements to support the upcoming feature. \nOn the latest builds of Windows 10, Microsoft has added an app called the Windows Holographic First Run. The app tests a PC whether its compatible with its VR platform, called Windows Holographic. A user’s machine must have USB 3.0 support, at least 4GB of RAM, a video card that supports DirectX 12 and a processor/CPU with at least four cores, according to The Verge . \nThe minimum requirements appears to be quite basic, and it looks like Windows 10 PCs bought in the last two years are compatible. Users who only have dual-core (two cores) processors on their PCs should also work as long as it comes with hyper threading. Dual-core CPUs with hyper threading are recognized by Windows as having four cores, according to Engadget . Related Stories Project Scorpio Will Be More Expensive Than Xbox One S \nThese are not the final hardware requirements for Microsoft’s Windows Holographic VR platform. The company hasn’t specified processor speeds and the type of graphics cards required. However, it does look like mid-range computers will be able to support Windows Holographic. \nCompanies like Oculus and HTC have their own VR platforms, and Windows Holographic will be Microsoft’s own. Windows Holographic is based on the same software that powers Microsoft’s HoloLens. The company is also planning to sell its own VR headsets next year and those will have a starting price of just $299. \nMicrosoft seems to be making a lot of effort in ensuring that virtual reality is accessible to a lot of Windows 10 users. In comparison, the Oculus Rift and the HTC Vive requires high-end PCs to work smoothly. In addition, the Rift and Vive headsets are also very expensive.

      "text": "Benioff on Trump, ‘old’ Microsoft and doubling Salesforce (Stuart) \nJon’s grab bag – Stuart vents some productive spleen in Britain’s post-Brexit Industrial Strategy needs more realism, less rhetoric , bringing up to date on the nuances of a situation that is far beyond “good” or “bad” at this point. Chris Middleton raises some interesting questions in How the Echo could kill marketing . Check this: \nMarketers will soon spend a great deal of time marketing brands, products, and services to machines – to platforms such as Amazon, Google, and Apple – and not to human beings. And that contradicts everything that marketing professionals have learned about their business over centuries. \nI’m usually wary of handing our human foibles over to machines, but if it will spare me the robo-calls from hell and their lowest-common-denominator ilk, then sure – let marketers pummel my Alexa with their roman candle slot machine “personalized” omni-channel messages to their heart’s content. Best of the rest \nFacebook, fake news, and the problematic future of media – by Ben Thompson and Tom Foremski \nquotage : “ Let me be clear: I am well aware of the problematic aspects of Facebook’s impact; I am particularly worried about the ease with which we sort ourselves into tribes, in part because of the filter bubble effect noted above (that’s one of the reasons Why Twitter Must Be Saved ). But the solution is not the reimposition of gatekeepers done in by the Internet.”– Ben Thompson, Fake News \nmyPOV: I didn’t want to write about Facebook again. I’d rather write about Tinder Pinterest Tumblr. But the fake news fallout continues, and that’s where the best content landed. If you want me to write about something else, get busy blogging! Media blogger Tom Foremski holds Facebook’s feet to the fire in Facebook is a tech-enabled media company . Foremski takes the position that Facebook is indeed a media company, which would completely disrupt not only Facebook’s business model, but almost any media platform, from Google search to YouTube. \nI don’t see that happening, but the debate over Facebook’s accountability matters. I think we grasp how Fox News and/or CNN shapes people’s views; we are only beginning to understand how Facebook’s attitude-shaping power – and that’s excluding the fake news brouhaha. Ben Thompson is clearly struggling with these issues; it’s caused him to take a more critical eye to Facebook, the once-and-future poster child of his aggregation theory. But if you check Fake News , you’ll see him grappling – as all free-thinking citizens should do. \nThis begs the question: how should enterprises respond? I addressed that recently in Digital media disruptions XV – Overcoming Facebook’s algos and media monetization woes . \nOther standouts: What Motivates Gig Economy Workers – Via Frank Scavo I picked up on this interesting gig economy piece, which examines the learnings from a survey of 85 Uber and Lyft drivers. There’s a problem assessing the gig economy due to the mix of supplemental income and full-time workers. For now, gig economy platforms must find a way to accommodate the motivations of both. Lecko on collaboration and Microsoft on Teams at SMILE – I’m not sure I could bring myself to attend an event with the acronym SMILE, resulting in the unenviable Twitter hashtag of #smilelondon, but The Agile Elephant’s David Terrar made it happen. Terrar posted this useful roundup on the state of collaboration, and Microsoft’s own positioning of Teams and Yammer. As for the “Yammer is going nowhere!” assertions, that sounds like Florida swampland to me – but good to get the official take. \nHonorable mention \nWalmart Plans To Track Fresh Produce Like Bitcoin – one of the more interesting blockchain pilots is underway. Twitter Rolls Out New And Long-Awaited Anti-Harassment Tools – not sure why Twitter insists on moving in slow motion on issues it should have conquered years ago. My bank rolls out innovation faster than this. Open source and coopetition are the new normal – Not sure this is a new insight but there sure are some strange corporate bedfellows of late. Event Report – Microsoft Connect – No April’s Fools – Linux, Google and more – Anyhow, back to those strange bedfellows. Microsoft and… Linux? Whiffs \nThis week in lifestyle fetish innovations, we’ve got Rovables Are Tiny Multipurpose Bots That Crawl on Your Clothes . Why put smart minds on the world’s ills when they can be lowering their own bar working on… rovables? \nGot a funny PR snafu from my colleague Phil Wainewright. An eager PR was pitching him an AWS customer story from Yubl. Here’s Phil’s condensed version of the PR timeline: Nov 10: “Yubl is the UK’s fastest growing social messaging app start-up that is taking on the established social networks” Nov 21: “Unfortunately as you may know by now Yubl went into administration last week.” \nExtra PR points for the level of denial implicit in “went into administration.” Good to know that no one ever dies or fails anymore – we just “go into administration.” Too bad, as Yubl was supposed to move “‘digital conversation’ significantly closer to genuine human interaction.” If you’re wondering what “genuine human interaction” would have looked like, worry not, I’ve got a screen shot for you: \nDunno about you, but I reek of nostalgia for all that could have been – boo for “admin”. \nBefore I wish the U.S. readers a Happy Thanksgiving, and the rest of you a lovely week, I’d like to usher in the most dreaded bloviated insufferable inescapable tradition in our industry: tech predictions: PR rep to me: “Are you planning on writing a 2017 predictions piece?” Me: “How did you know how I spent my weekend?” #lovetechpredictions \n— Jon Reed (@jonerp) November 14, 2016 \nThen, the inevitable: Received some exciting 2017 predictions from a thought leader: “More data will be external and generated in the Cloud” -> gutty call! \n— Jon Reed (@jonerp) November 18, 2016 \nOver to you, Clive. \nWhich #ensw pieces of merit did I miss?

      "text": "73 shares \nAt an event to announce its feature-packed Creators Update for Windows 10, Microsoft revealed that it’s working with hardware makers to release PC-tethered VR headsets that’ll start at $299 – a lot cheaper than existing options like the Oculus Rift and HTC Vive. \nThe trouble with the current generation of headsets is that they not only cost a lot on their own, but also require high-end PCs to VR experiences on them – raising the price of admission to at least $1,500. The Verge reports that Microsoft’s cheaper offerings won’t be all that demanding. \nIt noted that a “Windows Holographic First Run” app for testing compatibility with Microsoft’s upcoming VR platform is included in the latest test builds of Windows 10, and it revealed the minimum hardware requirements for VR experiences: 4GB of RAM A graphics card with DirectX 12 support 4 CPU cores, including dual-core processors with hyperthreading \nThat’s not scary at all, and it should be possible for most folks with modest PCs to give VR a try. Of course, we’ll have to wait and see what sort of apps run on such machines. \nPlus, Alex Kipman, who heads the HoloLens project at Microsoft, said that the upcoming range of VR headsets will offer different classes of experiences across numerous price points. He explained, “There is a difference if you want to play Halo or you want to play Solitaire. The entry to play anything was a $1,500 PC; that’s what we lowered.” \nMicrosoft is also expected to share more information about how the headsets will work next month , when it hosts a couple of Windows Hardware Engineering Community (WinHEC) events – the first will be in Shenzen, China, on December 8-9; the second will be in Taipei, Taiwan from December 14-15.",

      "text": "Microsoft offers EU hardware, software LinkedIn concessions: Report Reuters Email Author \nMicrosoft will still allow LinkedIn's rivals access to its software and give hardware makers the option of installing other services to try to win EU approval for its takeover of the U.S. firm, people familiar with the matter said. \nThe U.S. software company submitted its LinkedIn concessions to the European Commission last week after the EU competition enforcer expressed concerns about the $26 billion deal, Microsoft's biggest ever acquisition. \nThe offer aims to show that Microsoft will not favor LinkedIn at the expense of rivals, the people said, in an attempt to address a key concern for regulators. \nBoth the Commission and Microsoft, which have not provided details of the offer, declined to comment on Monday. \nThe EU is now seeking feedback from rivals and customers before deciding whether to accept the concessions, demand more or open an investigation which can take up to five months. They have until Tuesday to do so. The Commission is scheduled to rule on the deal by Dec. 6. \nProfessional social networks which have access to Microsoft's API (application program interface) will continue to have this facility once LinkedIn becomes part of the company, the people said. \nThe other key element of the company's concessions is the option for computer hardware makers to install either LinkedIn or rival networks on computers, indicating that the company is keen to avoid any suggestion of packaging products to crush competitors. \nMicrosoft's website shows it has software deals with hardware makers such as Dell, HP, Lenovo, Acer and Huawei, among others. \nThe Commission has fined Microsoft more than 2.2 billion euros ($2.3 billion) over the past decade for various infringements, one of them being the tying of some products to its Windows operating system to stifle competition. \nLinkedIn generates the bulk of its $3 billion annual revenue from job hunters and recruiters who pay a monthly fee to post resumes and connect with people.

After all, the Madden version of Thomas helped Watson prevail at Monday’s ‘Pros vs GI Joes’ event. ], they saved me. Without a doubt. Absolutely.” But while Watson’s late touchdown throw to Thomas gave him the 6-0 victory in his Madden matchup, his opponent was far more important. Watson was one of more than half a dozen players who spent the evening with current and former servicemen and servicewomen, as well as their children. \nAs the Broncos approach their official Salute to Service game on Sunday against the Chiefs, the evening served as a reminder of the sacrifice made by those in the armed forces. “It means everything,” Watson said. “To be able to come out here and work with the military and their sons or their daughters and playing a game and just giving back a little back, I love stuff like this. It’s a no-brainer for me to come out. It’s been two weeks since we went to the base, now we’re here in the Microsoft store, so I’m having a lot of fun. Watson said he’s surpassed his goal of one community service outing per week and sits closer to an average of two. On Tuesday, he’ll attend another event. On Monday night, however, his focus was entirely on the troops, who sit close to his heart. One of Watson’s closest friends is currently serving overseas, and Watson said he sent a game system over to him so that they could stay connected. He could certainly use some practice at Madden, he admitted. “I don’t know how y’all play this game,” Watson said. “All my NFL games are still in wrappers because I don’t play the game personally. Thank god that I’m a gamer.”",

      "text": "- Source: Microsoft Blogs \nTodd Holmdahl, Microsoft executive who will lead new topological quantum computing efforts \nAs new research shows that quantum computers are within reach, at least at small scales with a small number of qubits, Microsoft is rising as one of the companies to bet big on quantum computers. A New Quantum Era May Soon Be Upon Us \nThe reason why Microsoft, as well as Google , IBM , and other big companies are starting to invest heavily in quantum computing is because it could provide a big boost to machine learning, an already hot investment category with significant potential. \nThe new “tech wars” are probably going to be won by those with the most know-how and computing resources for machine learning. Quantum computers could give some machine learning players a significant edge over those without quantum computers. \nBeyond using quantum computers to boost machine learning computation, they could also be used to break virtually all of the existing encryption. Because of this, there are already efforts underway to implement quantum-resistant encryption algorithms in browsers such as Chrome, but those new algorithms still need to be proven. \nIt may take at least a few more years for cryptography researchers to see whether the new algorithms are safe to use or whether they can be broken. Google has already promised a ~50 qubit universal quantum computer in the next few years, but it will probably be a few more generations before it can do any real damage to existing encryption. \nQuantum computers could also be used to simulate molecules , which could make drug research much more accurate. It would ultimately make drugs more precise and more effective, and also cheaper due to a much faster turnaround. \n“There is a real opportunity to apply these computers to things that I’ll call material sciences of physical systems,” said Todd Holmdahl, who will lead the new scientific and engineering efforts to create the first topological quantum computer, as well as the software running on it. \n“A lot of these problems are intractable on a classical computer, but on a quantum computer we believe that they are tractable in a reasonable period of time,” he explained. \nHolmdahl has previously had key roles in turning the Xbox, Kinect, and HoloLens projects from pure research into real products. Microsoft’s Topological Quantum Computer \nMicrosoft intends to build a “topological” quantum computer that uses two-dimensional particles, called anyons, whose world lines pass around one another to form three-dimensional “braids” (with the three dimensions including the two spacial dimensions of anyons and one temporal dimension). \nUnlike some other quantum computers that use trapped quantum particles, the topological quantum computer is supposed to create more stable qubits . How to make stable qubits has been the bulk of quantum research for the past few decades, because stable qubits are vital for a practical quantum computer. \n“A topological design is less impacted by changes in its environment,” noted Holmdahl. \nMicrosoft has already been working on developing software for quantum computers , recognizing that quantum computing software will be just as important as the hardware. The software is what will give quantum computers all the “killer apps” that will be necessary to make them useful. Some of the projects to which we’ll want to give a quantum computing boost will be obvious, while others won’t be, until we try them out. \n“My guess is that back in the 40s and 50s, when they were thinking about the first transistor, they didn’t necessarily know how this thing was going to be used. And I think we’re a little bit like that,” Holmdahl added. \nTo make its first topological quantum computer, Microsoft is bringing on board multiple quantum computing experts from top universities in Denmark, the Netherlands, Switzerland, and Australia. Microsoft hopes that by combining their theoretical research with its own engineering expertise, it can create a topological quantum computer more quickly.

      "title": "Microsoft Surface Book vs Apple MacBook Pro: Both companies charm consumers with high-quality upgrades; Specs & features discussed",
      "text": "0 A woman listens to a store employee talk about the Microsoft Surface during the grand opening of a flagship Microsoft Corp. retail store in New York, October 26, 2015. Reuters/Lucas Jackson \nApple and Microsoft have just updated their high-in-demand laptops, the Apple MacBook Pro and Microsoft Surface Book. Both the companies have included latest technologies and innovations in their devices so as to compete with each other successfully. As both laptops are favourites for the tech-savvy customers, it might be tough to choose between the two. \nThe Microsoft Surface Book has been updated with some top-class features whereas the Apple MacBook Pro now has the crystal-clear Retina Display. In fact, the Apple MacBook Pro has received a major design upgrade after four years. \nThis has created a lot of hype among fans. Apart from the high-res Retina Display, the laptop is now much thinner and lighter when compared to Apple MacBook Air. Among the top features included in the Microsoft Surface Book, fans are really upbeat about the Surface Pen Stylus, touchscreen display and a lot of processing power. \nHowever, fans have been mesmerised by the Microsoft Surface Book’s detachable screen that transforms the portable laptop into a portable tablet. In terms of operating system, the Apple MacBook Pro runs on the latest version of MacOS Sierra. Sierra provides an amazing user experience with seamless running of Siri, iMessage, iCloud among others. \nThe Microsoft Surface Book runs on Windows 10 and users can also use the Microsoft Cortana virtual assistant for regular activities. The Surface Book can be purchased from Microsoft Store Australia for $2,299 inclusive of GST. It would include the basic 128GB storage, 8GB RAM and Core Intel i5 processor. \nOn the other hand, the basic 128GB storage, 2.7GHz dual-core Intel Core i5 processor and 8GB RAM, 13-inch model costs $1,999, as per Apple Australia . \nThus, for the experimenting buyer who can shell out some extra dollars, may go for the Microsoft Surface Book. Hardcore Apple fans would love to get their hands on the MacBook Pro as they have been waiting for upgrades for a long time. Moreover, its basic model is less expensive than the Surface Book.",

      "text": "Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends \nMany companies and researchers are investigating quantum computing as one of the next major steps in the evolution of computers. The “spooky” effects of quantum physics, it is hoped, will enable the creation of computers that operate on certain tasks at unprecedented levels of performance. \nMicrosoft is one of those companies, and it has been looking at quantum computing for some time now. Today, however, the company is taking the next step of actively investing in the creation of a real, scaleable quantum computer that can be used to tackle real-world problems, as the company outlines on the official Microsoft blog . \nMore: MIT’s newest quantum computer puts us one step closer to defeating modern encryption \nAs Microsoft executive Todd Holmdahl puts it, ““I think we’re at an inflection point in which we are ready to go from research to engineering.” The executive has some experience within Microsoft of bringing pie-in-the-sky projects to the market, having been involved in the development of the Xbox, Kinect, and the HoloLens — all projects that started out as mere research projects and made it all the way to consumer products. \nMicrosoft will be drawing on the skills and knowledge of two prominent quantum computing researchers in moving the initiative outside of the lab and into a real product. Charles Marcus is Villum Kann Rasmussen Professor at the Niels Bohr Institute at the University of Copenhagen and also serves as director of the Danish National Research Foundation-sponsored Center for Quantum Devices. Joining him at the center of Microsoft’s efforts is Leo Kouwenhoven, distinguished professor at Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands and founding director of QuTech, the Advanced Research Center on Quantum Technologies. \nBoth researchers have been working with Microsoft on their quantum computing tech for some time, and now the company is funding more work on basic research in the lab. Both scientists will retain their titles and affiliations after joining Microsoft and will continue working with their respective teams. At the heart of their efforts will be the ultimate goal of bringing a quantum computer into the real world. \nAccording to Marcus, “I knew that to get over the hump and get to the point where you started to be able to create machines that have never existed before, it was necessary to change the way we did business. We need scientists, engineers of all sorts, technicians, programmers, all working on the same team.” \nMore: Researchers in Australia develop more stable qubits for quantum computers \nMicrosoft hasn’t announced any firm plans to deploy a product, but its focus will be on the type of qubit, which stands for a unit of quantum information, call the “topological cubit.” Qubits are used as the key building blocks in a quantum computer, and could allow them to determine multiple solutions to a problem at once, in contrast to today’s sequential computers. \nThe company will have a number of obstacles to overcome in building a quantum computer. For example, the devices will require incredibly cold and static environments to avoid external influence on the system’s quantum state, as that will disturb the state and disrupt processing. According to Microsoft, qubits are less susceptible to heat and electrical noise, meaning they can be used to maintain quantum states for longer periods of time. \nClearly, the challenge will be a significant one. At the end, however, will be the creation of a quantum computer that can dramatically reduce the time to develop new drugs and study biological processes, to take two examples. A quantum-powered intelligent cloud would exceed existing computers in power in the same way that the smartphone exceeds the first cell phones. Holmdahl expanded on the opportunity, saying, “There is a real opportunity to apply these computers to things that I’ll call material sciences of physical systems. A lot of these problems are intractable on a classical computer, but on a quantum computer we believe that they are tractable in a reasonable period of time.” \nOne day, a quantum computer might help delve into the secrets of quantum physics itself. It’s conceivable that questions about dark matter and other mysteries of the universe might one day be solved on a Microsoft quantum computer running the company’s own specialized software.

Microsoft has 115,000 employees and 650,000 partners across 100+ countries. Objective Streamline the entire partner-incentive contracting process, from onboarding to verifying proof of execution to authorizing payment. Results Better partner experience Increased partner adoption Ongoing ROI through additional customers and revenue Microsoft streamlined its complex partner-incentive contracting process Microsoft jointly sponsors many events with its over 650,000 partners worldwide, and those partners earn incentive payments for the role the events play in driving additional customers and revenue to Microsoft. The Icertis Contract Management platform provided a secure and cost- effective solution that greatly simplified Microsoft’s process for onboarding these partners, verifying their compliance with contractual obligations, and executing their incentive payments. Business Challenge Microsoft had decided that its existing solution for handling partner-incentive contracts was too time-consuming and that different steps in the process involved too many disparate and poorly integrated systems. Some tools were manual or only semi- automated, and there was very little standardization. Multiple back- and-forth emails were often required to verify proof of execution, which came in many forms such as photographs, scanned copies, videos, and receipts. As a result, partner payments were typically delayed and partner experience was inconsistent. What’s more, the solution wasn’t agile and couldn’t take advantage of the cloud. Slide 2 Solution When Microsoft first began evaluating alternatives, program administrators predicted that its situation was so complicated and unique to Microsoft’s business that it would have to build its own solution. But the Icertis platform was so flexible and configurable that Microsoft achieved the functionality it required—quickly, securely and cost-effectively. With the Icertis platform, Microsoft could simplify its overall process and integrate with numerous applications. The Icertis platform is an open API-based solution allowing Microsoft to create an easy-to-navigate, seamless partner experience—from onboarding all the way to payment. Improved and automated workflows helped Microsoft program administrators manage the program much more efficiently. The solution was delivered on Azure Cloud, taking advantage of its agility and security in handling personal partner data coming from outside the firewall. Results Microsoft program administrators have become much more productive, and partners are having a better experience and getting paid much faster. “The Icertis solution simplified and accelerated the process for how we exchanged, reviewed and approved critical documentation between Microsoft and our partners,” says Microsoft Senior Director Sarathy Annamraju. “We’re now broadening our deployment to support electronic proof of execution for incentives.” We’re now broadening our deployment to support electronic proof of execution for incentives.” Sarathy Annamraju, Senior Director, Microsoft About Icertis Icertis is the leading provider of contract lifecycle management in the cloud with more than a half- million users in over 90 countries.

      "text": "Technically Incorrect offers a slightly twisted take on the tech that's taken over our lives.\nEnlarge Image Throwing a little jab?\nPhoto by Stephen Brashear, Getty Images Words can come back to haunt you.\nSometimes, they even slap you about the chops while sniggering: \"Heh, heh, heh.\"\nAnd so it is that Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has taken some of Tim Cook's words and gently wafted them right back at him.\nIn an interview with the Australian Financial Review , Nadella mused on the increasing success of the Surface.\nHe painted it as an example of Microsoft's risk-taking nature. He also contrasted this attitude with that of his competitors.\n\"Three years ago, the two-in-one as a form factor was questioned,\" he said. \"Does anybody need one? And now guess what, even our competition has decided that it's not a refrigerator and a toaster, but it's actually a two-in-one.\"\nActually, it was four years ago. Should you not be familiar with the subtext here, Cook was on a 2012 earnings call when he mused about hybrid computers. He said converging two different products involved too many trade-offs.\nThen he added , quite immortally: \"You can converge a toaster and a refrigerator, but those things are probably not going be pleasing to the user.\"\nThis may not have been quite right. Indeed, in its August launch of the iPad Pro, Apple expressly claimed that it was a computer. Which confused a lot of people, as Apple had always insisted it was a tablet.\nMore Technically Incorrect Apple preaches inclusiveness with Frankenstein's monster Drake reveals Taylor Swift weakness in new Apple Music News anchor tries to draw cannon, draws oh, look At the time, Microsoft couldn't help emitting a guffaw in the form of an ad whose message was -- my paraphrase -- \"Yo, Apple. Please do shove it.\"\nApple didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. Nadella, though, is projecting some confidence. He explained to the Financial Review that you have to make room for failures. Not everything will work.\nAnd sometimes, you have to take the jokes for a while before you suddenly get imitated.\nI cannot confirm that Jony Ive is already working on a revolutionary refrigerator/toaster design. Still, it took a very long time for NFL announcers to stop calling a Surface an iPad .\nSo perhaps both companies have a little work to do here.\n ",

      "text": "Igor Bonifacic \nNovember 21, 2016 9:29am \nIt looks like Microsoft’s upcoming $300 VR headsets won’t just be more affordable than the competition, they also won’t need to be powered by an expensive high-end PC. \nThe latest Windows 10 test build includes an app called “Windows Holographic First Run.” Launching the application initiates a compatibility test that checks whether the user’s machine can run Windows Holographic apps. \nAccording to the app, the minimum specs for Windows Holographic is a machine with 4GB of RAM, at least one USB 3.0 port, a graphics card with DirectX 12 and a four core processor — though a dual core processor with hyperthreading will also do, according to The Verge ‘s Tom Warren. Based on those specs, the majority of Windows 10 PCs should be VR ready. \nOf course, that’s merely the minimum spec, meaning there’s no guarantee the VR experiences at this level will be great. \nMicrosoft is scheduled to share more information on its VR ambitions at two events in mid-December. Source The Verge Gewurttraminer \nMore RAM would be helpful for sure. I’d say 16GB but the fact that you are able to experience VR with these basic requirements at least introduces it in a way that most people could afford. The idea you have to spend thousands on new hardware just to open up these possibilities is really absurd. Smanny \nPeople have had mobile VR with Android since 2014. Each year mobile VR has greatly improved. So it makes sense that Microsoft gave these as the minimum specs. I look at Google’s latest Pixel with its Daydream VR, and it offers a great VR experience. Not to mention that is using an ARM processor, so it makes total sense that we will see lower end VR/AR/mixed headsets that can take advantage of it. Especially when we are seeing smartphones with QHD displays with the latest ARM processors with 6 GB of ram, 128 GB of storage for around $500 Canadian dollars. The $300 that Microsoft mentions is in US dollars.

      "text": "Microsoft promised 2017 to be a much more exciting year for Windows phones, and while everybody expects the upcoming Creators Update to bring many new features on Windows 10 Mobile devices, it appears that it’s another release the one that’ll blow our minds. Windows 10 Redstone 3, which is scheduled to launch in the fall of 2017, could represent Microsoft’s first step towards x86 emulation for ARM64, which is currently supported by Windows 10 Mobile devices. In other words, Windows 10 Redstone 3 could allow Windows phones to run x86 programs thanks to emulation technology that Microsoft is currently on, but there is more to find out about Redmond’s plans. Twitter user WalkingCat discovered references to a technology called “CHPE,” which according to ZDNet, could stand for Cobal...",

      "text": "Netflix Viewers on Windows 10 Can Now Stream 4K Content in Microsoft Edge PCs are required to have seventh-generation Intel Core processor 4K capable screens are required for UHD streaming from Netflix Not all subscriptions are offering option of streaming in 4K \nNetflix has allowed users to stream 4K content for quite some time now but kept PC users away from this privilege up until now. The video streaming service has now announced that users with Windows 10 PCs will now be able to stream content in Ultra HD resolution using the Microsoft Edge browser. \nMicrosoft has clarified that in order to stream 4K content from Netflix, the user's set up \"must have a 4K-capable screen and use a 7th Gen Intel Core Processor.\" Further it should be noted that neither all content is available in Ultra-HD resolution nor all subscriptions allow streaming in 4K. In order to enjoy the 4K content users will be required to upgrade to Premium monthly subscription, which is available for Rs. 800 a month in India. \n( Also see : Microsoft Woos Users to Edge Browser by Touting 1080p Netflix Playback ) \"Your binge-watching favourites on Netflix are now available in 4K exclusively on compatible PCs and 2-in-1 devices, on Windows 10. Check out the new streaming experience with Microsoft Edge, the only browser that supports Netflix 4K content,\" Microsoft said in a blog post on Monday.\nThe blog post includes a plug for Microsoft Edge's power consumption claims, says that Edge users will be able to watch at least 1 more episode than Chrome users due to the improved battery life they will enjoy. The new Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life, premieres on Friday. \nNetflix has clearly stated on its website that a download speed of at least 25Mbps per stream is recommended to receive Ultra HD content. \nRecently, Google started testing 4K UHD movie purchase and rental options through Google Play store and Google Play Movies & TV app. The company also started shipping its Chromecast Ultra dongle, with support for 4K, earlier this month in the US.",

      "text": "Microsoft itself admitted that it failed in the mobile business , but the firm is still not willing to give up on phones entirely and is still looking into ways to innovate in this side of the market. Inventing new product categories seems to be Microsoft’s new thing after the Surface and the Surface Studio, and now the company is trying to do the same thing with Windows phones.

      "text": "'Xbox One' Scorpio Confirmed To Run 4K Native Resolution; Microsoft Claims That It Is The Most Powerful Video Game Console By Troy Woodridge ,   21, 10:34 pm The new \"Xbox One\" Scorpio will deliver the native 4K resolution confirmed by the Microsoft. \"Xbox One\" Scorpio is said to be the most powerful video game console once it's released.(Photo : Xbox - YouTube) \nMicrosoft is about to release the new \"Xbox One\" Scorpio next year and it will be equipped with very powerful chipset and peripherals. The \"Xbox One\" Scorpio has confirmed that it be able to run a native 4K resolution. Advertisement \nAccording to the Gigets , during an interview, Microsoft's general manager Shannon Loftis said that the upcoming \"Xbox One\" Scorpio will run 4K native games. With this feature, it will make the \"Xbox One\" Scorpio stands out among any other video game console that is currently available in the market. \nThe 4K resolution capability is something that the Sony PlayStation 4 Pro doesn't have. The PS4 Pro doesn't even have the Blu-Ray feature that keeps \"Xbox One\" S on top of it. When talking to someone NOT excited about #Xbox Project Scorpio but is looking for excitement, want to be like.. pic.twitter.com/IVI8GZlnKM \n— Ken Microsoftee (@XboxFloat) November 20, 2016 \nSeveral experts said that we may find the \"Xbox One\" Project Scorpio running below 60FPS when running 4K resolution. This is due to the fact that it needs to have very powerful peripherals, especially the GPU for it to maintain its stable FPS, that even a high powered gaming PC are experiencing the bottleneck of running the 4K. \nMeanwhile, the Microsoft has confirmed that the most affordable video game console next year will be the \"Xbox One\" S, looking at its features and capabilities. With this statement coming from the Microsoft, it hints that the \"Xbox One\" S might come next year with a price cut once the \"Xbox One\" Scorpio is out according to the International Business Times . \nIn addition, the Microsoft said that the new \"Xbox One\" Project Scorpio will be a premium video game console. The upcoming game console will obviously have a higher market price than the \"Xbox One\" S as Phil Spencer confirmed. \nHowever, having a higher price will surely have its equal performance and features. The Microsoft company claims that the new \"Xbox One\" Scorpio will be the most powerful and the most advanced video game console ever made.   Related Articles",

      "text": "\n© 2016 Time Inc. All rights reserved. Here’s What Microsoft Could Be Doing to Win EU Approval for LinkedIn Bid \nMicrosoft will still allow LinkedIn’s rivals access to its software and give hardware makers the option of installing other services to try to win EU approval for its takeover of the U.S. firm, people familiar with the matter said. \nThe U.S. software company submitted its LinkedIn concessions to the European Commission last week after the EU competition enforcer expressed concerns about the $26 billion deal, Microsoft’s biggest ever acquisition. \nThe offer aims to show that Microsoft msft will not favor LinkedIn at the expense of rivals, the people said, in an attempt to address a key concern for regulators. \nBoth the Commission and Microsoft, which have not provided details of the offer, declined to comment on Monday. \nThe EU is now seeking feedback from rivals and customers before deciding whether to accept the concessions, demand more or open an investigation which can take up to five months. They have until Tuesday to do so. The Commission is scheduled to rule on the deal by Dec. 6. \nProfessional social networks which have access to Microsoft’s API (application program interface) will continue to have this facility once LinkedIn becomes part of the company, the people said. Get Data Sheet , Fortune’s technology newsletter \nThe other key element of the company’s concessions is the option for computer hardware makers to install either LinkedIn or rival networks on computers, indicating that the company is keen to avoid any suggestion of packaging products to crush competitors. \nMicrosoft’s website shows it has software deals with hardware makers such as Dell, HP , Lenovo, Acer and Huawei, among others. \nThe Commission has fined Microsoft more than 2.2 billion euros ($2.3 billion) over the past decade for various infringements, one of them being the tying of some products to its Windows operating system to stifle competition. \nLinkedIn generates the bulk of its $3 billion annual revenue from job hunters and recruiters who pay a monthly fee to post resumes and connect with people.

      "text": "Shots Fired: Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella Pokes Fun At Apple's iPad Pro For Being Too Similar To Surface 22 November 2016, 4:29 am EST By Carl Velasco Tech Times Apple - Here's What You May Not Know Now Playing Satya Nadella, Microsoft's chief executive, isn't letting Apple's chief executive Tim Cook slip with his infamous \"toaster and refrigerator\" analogy for hybrids. In a recent interview, Nadella poked fun at Apple for essentially eating its own words. ( Stephen Brashear | Getty Images ) Advertisement Satya Nadella, Microsoft's chief executive, has jestingly lifted back up Tim Cook's previous words and turned it against him, musing about the growing success of the Surface . For those who can't recall, Cook, Apple's chief executive, during an earnings call way back in 2012, offered a bizarre analogy of the abysmal appeal of hybrid computers, noting that users won't be pleased with the convergence of a \"refrigerator and a toaster,\" in his own words. Tim Cook might have been spitballing four years ago, since it now bills the iPad Pro as a computer instead of a glorified tablet, leaving many people puzzled at the oft-shuffling designations. Additionally, with the iPad Pro now identified as a full computer, Cook's words are pretty much nonsensical, at least, in terms of what Apple seems to believe in. Nadella's Jabs At Apple Cook's previous undermining of the idea of hybrid computers and the increasing success of Microsoft's Surface, the direct rival to Apple's iPad Pro, has rendered Nadella in joking spirits. An interview with the Australian Financial Review sees Nadella pinning the Surface as Microsoft's symbol for risk-taking, in contrast with that of other companies, specifically but indirectly, Apple. \"Three years ago, the two-in-one as a form factor was questioned,\" Nadella said. \"And now guess what, even our competition has decided that it's not a refrigerator and a toaster, but it's actually a two-in-one.\" Nadella is of course talking about the Apple iPad Pro, who Apple one day decided to call a computer. Apple And Microsoft's Hybrid Feud Upon touting the iPad Pro as a computer, Microsoft wasn't able to hold back on a sinister and mordant but witty bashing in the form of a 30-seconder, depicting the iPad Pro as unable to respond to the Surface's various questions with regard to its performance. The tug-o-war stretches far back, however. Tim Cook had previously belittled the Surface , calling it a \"deluded\" and \"trying hard\" product. Microsoft has continuously poked fun at Apple's imitation game, running a host of TV commercials, rolling eyes at Apple's iPad Pro and its questionable status of being a computer. CNET has reached out to Apple for a comment, but the company has so far stayed mum about Nadella's jests. In the same interview, Nadella has expressed confidence, explaining to the Australian Financial Review, that one has to carve wiggle room for potential failures because not everything will work. \nDo you agree with Nadella's statements about Apple and the iPad Pro?

      "text": "\nApple has attracted derision for its new MacBook Pro laptops, not only because it lacks ports, but also because it features a tiny touch sensitive screen which seemed to cram much too much functionality into too small an area.\nNow a Microsoft patent application has surfaced, applied for well before the MacBook Pro unveil, on July 25, 2016, for a “KEYBOARD WITH INPUT-SENSITIVE DISPLAY DEVICE”.\nThe keyboard is designed primarily to ease text entry for Asian phonic languages where Microsoft notes that the routine method of text entry has an error rate of 20% or worse, making the manual correction of entered text (from a potential of 1600 characters) a tedious part of writing which normally involved stopping what you are doing and moving your hands from the keyboard to the mouse, scrolling from a selection of auto-correct suggestions, making a selection and then having to return the cursor to the text and starting the next character.\nMicrosoft’s invention features an additional screen which may be detachable or form part of the keyboard and which shows suggestions for characters entered and simplifies the process of correction of text entered.\nMicrosoft notes that besides being used to text entry correction it could also be used for other tasks, such as user interface navigation, and for other functions such as drawing on or acting a notification manager.\n\nAs some-one who produces both an OS and hardware such as the excellent range of Microsoft keyboard and mice Microsoft is well positioned to bring such a device to life, though I suppose the need for such as accessory will depend largely on how annoying it actually is to enter Kanji on a Roman keyboard.\nThe full patent can be seen at the USPTO here .\n",

      "text": "Search Problem Notes Usage Note 59142: Backing up garbage-collection (GC) log files in Microsoft Windows operating environments \nIf you enable GC logging (for the SAS ® 9.4 Web Application Server, the Cache Locator, and so on) in a Windows environment, the GC log is overwritten each time the Java virtual machine (JVM) restarts. There is no workaround for this behavior, and when it happens, important diagnostic information is lost. If you are instructed to enable GC logging by SAS Technical Support, you need to frequently back up the GC log file in order to avoid losing your diagnostic information. You can use the following method to back up a GC log file. Download this ZIP file to your middle-tier machine and unzip the file. Within the ..\\gcbackup\\conf folder that you unzipped, open the wrapper.conf file in a text editor and edit the following variables within that file: set.SASHOME: Set this variable to the path of your SASHome directory that contains the SAS Private Java Runtime Environment instance, as shown in this example: set.SASHOME=C:\\SAS\\SASHome set.GC_LOG: Set this variable to the full path that contains the GC log file that you want to back up, as shown in this example: set.GC_LOG=C:\\SAS\\Lev1\\Web\\Logs\\gcSASServer01_1.log Save the modified wrapper.conf file. Open a command prompt and submit a command similar to the following to navigate to the bin directory that is within the gcbackup folder: cd ..\\gcbackup\\bin From that directory, submit the following command to install the service: install.bat \nAfter you install the service, you should see the service named SAS Midtier TS - GC Backup in your Windows Services interface, as shown below: \nRight-click that service and select Start . The GC Backup service should now be running. \nAfter you perform these steps, you should see that *.BKUP files are created for the GC log file that you are backing up (the file that you specified in the set.GC_LOG variable) These *.BKUP files are in the same directory as the original GC log file. You should see up to ten *.BKUP files. \nIf you have any issues running the backup service or if the .BKUP files are not created, see the wrapper.log file in the ..\\gcbackup\\logs\\ folder for troubleshooting information.

      "text": "​Apple was one of the companies that laughed at Microsoft’s investments in the Surface lineup from the very beginning, with CEO Tim Cook himself poking fun at the idea of mixing tablets and keyboards. And now, the iPhone maker itself is focusing on 2-in-1 devices with the iPad Pro, which gives Microsoft the opportunity of goofing on its rival for copying a strategy that it didn’t believe it can work. Microsoft’s CEO Satya Nadella is the latest high-profile Redmond executive who did that, as the Steve Ballmer successor talked about the success of the Surface in an interview with AFR. “Three years ago, the two-in-one as a form factor was questioned,” he said. “Does anybody need one? And now guess what, even our competition has decided that it's not a refrigerator and a toaster, but it's actually a ...",

      "text": "A few years ago, Microsoft launched a Office 365 campaign with the slogan of #GetItDone. The basic premise was fitting more work into more places of your life. Well, not so much just fitting as shoving, cramming, and crunching it into every damn nook and cranny of your existence.\nLike, why shouldn’t you check up on that Excel spreadsheet with the latest TPS numbers from the bathroom? Or take that conference call from your kid’s soccer game? Or fake presence with your spouse reviewing Word revisions while watch a show “together”?\nSeriously. I’m not making these scenarios up. Microsoft’s campaign included all of them, complete with stats to alleviate the guilt of living such a shackled life. See, everyone is doing it! And Microsoft 365 makes it easier!!\nFuck. That. Shit.\nWe tried to push back against Microsoft’s #GetItDone back in 2013 with #WorkCanWait . That lead to a whole series of features in Basecamp 3 to encourage the exact opposite of what Microsoft wanted the future of work to look like. Basecamp 3 has a literal feature called Work Can Wait , which ensures that work stays out of your kid’s soccer game or your family’s movie night.\nAnyway, that was then. I kinda thought Microsoft would have wised up since. In 2013, you could at least excuse the company somewhat since the dancing buffoon was still in charge. But in 2016? No. No, you cannot excuse that any more.\nSo watch this:\nhttps://medium.com/media/f0133d84e92c4f5ea2d9727a657adbe4/href Oh yeah, that’s just Microsoft putting a chipper fucking jingle to an ideal of work that’s literally presented as “14 hour days, 7 days a week, for decades”. Say what now? In what alternate universe is that an ideal you want to endorse?\nMaybe that’s what the new Surface is all about. Perfect for sweatshops like Marvel to churn out yet another superhero rehash. Just so everyone else who’s working death shift after death shift for decades can escape the hell that is their life in make-believe fantasy. Swell.\nBut hey, THIS IS THE FUTURE OF WORK, right? The Surface Pro 4 is just here to enable the inevitable transition to this glorious paradise of productivity. Your life: 14 hours a day, 7 days a week, running Microsoft gear. Wouldn’t you want this too? Isn’t this aspirational? No. It’s death.\nSleep is good . Sleep works . Fuck companies and products that endorse skimping or skipping it as some kind of superpower. Fuck the Surface Pro 4’s marketing team. I seriously hope that this is just Microsoft temporarily slipping up, not a trend worthy of retracting forgiveness for.\nMicrosoft reboots war on sleep was originally published in Signal v.

      "text": "Microsoft’s minimum spec for their $299 VR gear is seriously minimal By Dave James \nMicrosoft really are setting out their stall as the budget airline of VR. Back in October they announced to the world their intentions to bring a new range of VR headsets to the market, starting at $299, and now the minimum specs for those devices have been revealed. And boy, are they minimal. \nHardware is nothing without software, so what are the best VR games to play with your headset? \nAs part of the latest test build of Windows 10 - currently build 14971 - Microsoft have included an app called Windows Holographic First Run. It runs a short background compatibility check to test whether your hardware is good enough to run it virtual and mixed reality headsets. \nAnd it pretty much looks like if your PC is capable of booting into Windows 10 then it’s able to match the minimum specs for Microsoft’s VR ecosystem. You don’t have to go to the effort of loading the app or switching over to the test build of Windows 10 ‘cos the specs are pretty basic. CPU - Quad-core processor Memory - 4GB I/O - USB 3.0 \nThe only thing in there which might be an issue for older machines is the necessity of DirectX 12 hardware, but it doesn’t seem like it’s particularly fussy over whether that’s a discrete card or integrated graphics. It seems to be happy even if you’re just running from your DX12-compatible Intel GPU or AMD APU. \nWhich would also mean the experience isn’t meant to have the same level of fidelity as the far more expensive Vive or Rift headsets which require seriously meaty graphics silicon, even after recent advances in lowering the graphical specs for high-end VR devices. \nIt has to be said that these are the minimum specs though and may just be what your hardware needs to be to enable you to stick on a budget headset and check your Outlook calendar on the kitchen wall. It may be that higher-spec PCs and/or headsets will be capable of the sort of gaming experience we crave from VR. \nWe don’t have a timeline for when the first batch of new VR devices are set to appear, but Microsoft are working with HP, Acer, Asus, Lenovo and Dell to get these third-party products out into the wild. Will these more basic, budget-oriented headsets be able to further the VR cause? Only time will tell. \nPersonally, I'm kinda sceptical that low-end VR is going to do anything other than put people off. Having spent the weekend going deep with the Vive on a GTX 1070 laptop, and still having to run most games on pretty low settings, it's obvious you need a whole lot of power to get the sort of experiences that we've been promised by manufacturers, developers and Hollywood.",
