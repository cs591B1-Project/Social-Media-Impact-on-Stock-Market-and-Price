      "text": "Ability To Create ‘Moments’ Now Available in Twitter’s Apps December 1, 2016 - Written By Kristin Spradlin \nTwitter introduced a new addition to its Moments feature back in September of this year. Basically, the feature lets you create a collection of relevant tweets which then can be shared with your friends and followers. Before September, “Moments” were curated automatically by Twitter. While the feature was only available on the web version of Twitter at the time of launch, now, Twitter officially announced that Moments is now available for Android and iOS apps as well. \nThe feature comes in handy, especially when you want to share a collection of tweets of the same topic, for example, during a sporting event, you can create a collection of tweets that include, tweets of score updates and commentary to give a better picture of the ongoing game. The fact that Twitter has a character limit of 140 words for a single tweet, Moments will probably help create richer experiences on one of the most popular social media platforms. Creating your Moments is easy, all you have to do is: open up the Twitter app on your device, locate the tweets you want to make a collection of, then click on drop-down arrow placed on the top right corner, and select “Add to Moment” from the options to start making your Moments. Not only that, you can even customize your Moments to create a unique experience, for instance, you can rearrange the order of the tweets, set background colors for tweets which only has text content, select a cover, and finally write a description and title for your Moment. \nTo get the feature, you will need to be running on the latest version of the Twitter app. It’s not clear whether this is a server side roll out or you’ll need an app update to get the feature working. At the time of writing this story, we were unable to get this feature working on the latest version, 6.24.0 to be precise, of the Twitter app, so a new app update might be on the way which will turn on this feature. In any case, if you want to try out this cool feature, hit the link below to update/download the Twitter app now on your device, and if you’re not seeing any new update yet, it’s worth waiting for a couple of days as staged software roll outs often take some time to reach every device.",

By: Associated Press | Published: December 2, 2016 3:06 AM As per the deal, Globe Telecom will advertise on Twitter’s livestream of ‘The Starters’ and ‘The Warmups’ for the social network’s digital audiences, said the company in its recent statement. (Source: AP) \nSocial media platform Twitter Inc has recently inked a major livestreaming deal with its first Asian partner, Globe Telecom Inc from Philippines for two of its exclusive US National Basketball Association shows, the company announced on Thursday. \nAs per the deal, Globe Telecom will advertise on Twitter’s livestream of ‘The Starters’ and ‘The Warmups’ for the social network’s digital audiences, said the company in its recent statement. The shows, produced by Time Warner Inc’s Tuner Sports, will air exclusively on Twitter throughout the basketball league season from late October till June. The financial details are yet to be disclosed. \nPhilippines is touted to be one of NBA’s biggest international markets, especially when it comes to digital audience. The league recently opened its fourth NBA Store in the island province of Cebu. \nBasketball content will be created specifically for Twitter and Globe ads will run on highlight clips aired on the social media platform in the region. \nTwitter has made livestreaming video integral to its future as user and revenue growth from other forms of advertising has flattened. The company has signed numerous deals with U.S. college and professional sports leagues, most notably the National Football League, and partnered with media companies on the U.S. presidential debates and election night coverage. \nHowever, many analysts believe Twitter’s best chance to increase its ad revenue growth could lie overseas. \nIn its third-quarter earnings report, Twitter said overall ad revenue grew by just 6 percent year-over-year, mainly driven by 21 percent growth in international markets. Its U.S.-based ad revenue was down 2 percent. \nA report issued by eMarketer on Wednesday found that more U.S. advertisers are planning to use Facebook Inc’s Instagram than Twitter for the first time. Shares of Twitter fell 2.3 percent to $18.07 on the New York Stock Exchange early Thursday afternoon. \nNinety percent of male Twitter users in the Philippines are interested in basketball, with 76 percent of them actively following and watching the NBA, Maya Hari, Twitter’s managing director for Southeast Asia and India, said in the statement. \nIn May, NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said that more than half of the viewers on the association’s YouTube channel was outside the United States, led by the Philippines.

      "text": "As per the deal, Globe Telecom will advertise on Twitter’s livestream of ‘The Starters’ and ‘The Warmups’ for the social network’s digital audiences, said the company in its recent statement. (Source: AP) Social media platform Twitter Inc has recently inked a major livestreaming deal with its first Asian partner, Globe Telecom Inc from Philippines for two of its exclusive US National Basketball Association shows, the company announced on Thursday.\nAs per the deal, Globe Telecom will advertise on Twitter’s livestream of ‘The Starters’ and ‘The Warmups’ for the social network’s digital audiences, said the company in its recent statement. The shows, produced by Time Warner Inc’s Tuner Sports, will air exclusively on Twitter throughout the basketball league season from late October till June. The financial details are yet to be disclosed.\nPhilippines is touted to be one of NBA’s biggest international markets, especially when it comes to digital audience. The league recently opened its fourth NBA Store in the island province of Cebu.\nBasketball content will be created specifically for Twitter and Globe ads will run on highlight clips aired on the social media platform in the region.\nTwitter has made livestreaming video integral to its future as user and revenue growth from other forms of advertising has flattened. The company has signed numerous deals with U.S. college and professional sports leagues, most notably the National Football League, and partnered with media companies on the U.S. presidential debates and election night coverage.\nHowever, many analysts believe Twitter’s best chance to increase its ad revenue growth could lie overseas.\nIn its third-quarter earnings report, Twitter said overall ad revenue grew by just 6 percent year-over-year, mainly driven by 21 percent growth in international markets. Its U.S.-based ad revenue was down 2 percent.\nA report issued by eMarketer on Wednesday found that more U.S. advertisers are planning to use Facebook Inc’s Instagram than Twitter for the first time.\nShares of Twitter fell 2.3 percent to $18.07 on the New York Stock Exchange early Thursday afternoon.\nNinety percent of male Twitter users in the Philippines are interested in basketball, with 76 percent of them actively following and watching the NBA, Maya Hari, Twitter’s managing director for Southeast Asia and India, said in the statement.\nIn May, NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said that more than half of the viewers on the association’s YouTube channel was outside the United States, led by the Philippines.",

      "text": "Twitter buys startup Yes, Inc. and scores a new VP of product in the process Posted Bullpen closes   million to back post-seed stage startups \nOne-hundred and forty-three. That’s not the new character limit or the number of heads of product Twitter has employed over the few years (though close). That, rather, is the amount of times the new fellow filling that role has tweeted over the course of the past nine years – a number that includes two recent updates from the past couple of hours acknowledging the gig, one of which was enthusiastically retweeted by Jack Dorsey about an hour or so ago. Yes! Keith and team are joining Twitter to help lead and strengthen our service! https://t.co/5aFouFxTsh \n— 🚶🏽jack (@jack) December 1, 2016 \nThe role, which has been vacant since the summer, has seen a number of names come and go as the service has struggled to figure out the ideal way forward in the face of new competition and mounting user complaints. The gig was filled, most recently, by Jeff Seibert, who went back to his previous job at Twitter development platform Fabric, back in June. \nThe new VP of Product, Keith Coleman, steps into the role as part of Twitter’s purchase of seven-person mobile app startup Yes, Inc., where he served as CEO. Prior to that gig, the exec worked as a product manager for another little startup called Google. \nYes Inc’s other half-dozen employees will also be joining the Twitter staff, with design and product roles at the company. Yes, meanwhile, will be shutting down its own offerings in the coming weeks, in anticipation of the transition. That should give Coleman some time to engage a bit more with the platform he’ll be helping lead. Only 6,100 or so until he catches up with his predecessor. 0",

      "text": "Published December 01, 2016 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 Email Print ALLEN PARK, Mich. (AP) A'Shawn Robinson said he had enough skills on basketball courts to draw offers to play at UCLA, Boise State and Holy Cross.\nWhen he was a 6-foot-4 freshman at Arlington Heights High School in Fort Worth, Texas, he had hoop dreams.\n''When I got bigger, I didn't anymore,'' Robinson said.\nMore from FoxSports Whitlock 1-on-1: Warren Moon on Colin Kaepernick, social protests | SPEAK FOR YOURSELF Bird Talk with Jody and Jurecki: Little things costly for the Cardinals Colin Cowherd lists all the quarterbacks he would rather have than Cam Newton | THE HERD Rob Gronkowski is reportedly out for 8 weeks - How much will it matter? | THE HERD Taking his talents to football fields, and keeping them there, has panned out for him and the Detroit Lions.\nThe 6-foot-4, 320-pound rookie defensive tackle is emerging as a key player for the NFC North-leading Lions (7-4) as they surge into contention for their first division title since 1993 .\nRobinson started in his first game on Thanksgiving when Detroit beat the Minnesota Vikings, breaking a first-place tie.\n''He's been good and steady,'' Lions coach Jim Caldwell said. ''He's made some plays for us and does a good job of when he doesn't get to the passer, getting his hands up. He's got a bit of a knack for that, but he's also made plays in the running game. He's coming along.''\nRobinson has knocked down five passes, tying him for third among NFL defensive linemen.\nDespite not being an every-down player this season, it is an impressive feat to rank among league leaders in any category and Robinson credits his hoops history.\n''I think it helps my ability to know when the ball is going to get released from the quarterback and when to get my hand up and bat it,'' he said.\nWhen the New Orleans Saints (5-6) host the Lions on Sunday, they've got a plan to combat Robinson's knack for knocking down passes when Drew Brees is throwing.\n''Anytime a guy puts his hands up, we like to try to get back into his chest and get him to lower his hands,'' Saints right tackle Zach Strief said.\n''But ultimately if a guy stops and jumps, all you can really do is push him. There's been more and more of an emphasis of guys doing that as the passing game has gotten a little quicker over time. Sometimes you can't get home, and that's what you do.''\nLions defensive line coach Kris Kocurek puts his players through drills designed to rush and sack quarterbacks, not bat down passes.\nSo when Robinson is hailed for his ability to do it, he makes it clear his coach isn't celebrating.\n''If I can't get a sack, a batted ball takes a down away from the other team and I see it as a great thing,'' Robinson said. ''Coach Kris doesn't like it. He wants sacks instead. But you can't always get to the quarterback, so the next best thing is to bat the ball down.''\nRobinson has two sacks this season and is credited with two quarterback hurries. He has made 17 tackles, including four for losses.\nKnocking down passes, though, has become his best asset because he clearly has a feel for passing lanes and the timing of throws.\n''He's reminded me a couple times that he was a basketball player and offered a scholarship by a couple schools,'' Caldwell said with a grin. ''So, he's a pretty good athlete.''\n---\nAP freelance writer Guerry Smith in Metairie, Louisiana, contributed to this report.\n---\nFor more NFL coverage: http://www.pro32.ap.org and http://www.twitter.com/AP-NFL",

But we're going to have a lot of Democrats joining us on a lot of these things, maybe even health care.\"\nThe interview followed the first rally of Trump's so-called \"victory tour\" to states that helped him defeat Hillary Clinton in last month's presidential election. \nRead the full story at FoxNews.com→",

      "text": "By Ralph Peters \nPublished December 01, 2016 FoxNews.com Facebook 0 Twitter 0 Email Print   \nI’m lucky enough to know General James Mattis slightly. Just well enough to trust him unreservedly with our military and our nation’s security.\nThe president-elect could not choose a better man to be our next Secretary of Defense. Not just because Mattis is a battle-hardened Marine with a remarkable combat record. And not just because he has a mind of remarkable clarity and is, without question, the best-read general of his generation.\nI trust Jim Mattis because he’s a man of character, that most un-Washingtonian quality. His public image is of one rough-and-tough Marine, but the man I’ve encountered is, above all, one of integrity. His code of honor is so out of fashion that one has to reach back to a Victorian vocabulary:  He has a noble spirit.\nAnd he’s a genuine patriot, not a shouter with his eye on the next chance. He will do what’s right, not what’s expedient.  And he will never go along with anything he believes might harm our country.\nIn addition to plenty of dirty-boots experience in the Middle East and a deep knowledge of history—that most underrated study—Jim Mattis has another great qualification to be SecDef: He wasn’t looking for a job. He was happy in retirement, studying, helping his fellow Marines, and contributing thoughtfully to our national security behind the scenes. \nThe last time I heard from him—a bit before the election—he mentioned, not for the first time, that he was glad to be west of the Rockies. A Washington, D.C. post was not part of the plan; rather, he thought of farming in rural Washington State.  \nThis matters. In an age of sycophants and clawing ambition, it’s a splendid prospect to have a classic patriot who’s willing to sacrifice to serve (as Jim Mattis already has for four decades in uniform).\nOur most underrated president of the last century, Dwight D. “Ike” Eisenhower, didn’t want anyone in his cabinet who actively sought the position. He wanted successful men from various walks of life who would have to leave successful careers and contented lives to come to Washington and run a department ethically (an earlier version of “draining the swamp”).\nFor General Mattis, the position of Secretary of Defense wouldn’t be just another inside-the-Beltway badge to add to his resume. The greatest danger would be that he would prove too honest for D.C.\nYet another quality Mattis would bring to the office—a vital one—is that he’s a superb listener (yet another rare quality in Washington). He’s not quick to speak, but when he finally does have his say, his words show command of the subject under discussion. And he uses words with the same economy as a rifleman uses bullets: no wasted rounds.\nAs a member of the Hoover Institution’s Military History Working Group, he’d listen to the rest of us blather on for hours before saying a word. Then he would succinctly, politely and irrefutably explain why we had no idea what we were talking about.\nWhat would the nation get with General James Mattis as Secretary of Defense? Integrity. Deep knowledge. Courage, both moral and physical. Humility. Decency. Vision. A steely sense of duty. Fiscal responsibility. A natural leader of men.\nIn short, character.\nInevitably, we’ve heard plaints from the left about the “danger” of generals in high government positions, with the suggestion that they’ll take us into wars. But it hasn’t been the generals who’ve gotten us into our recent conflicts or who have failed to resolve them. For the last sixteen years, we’ve seen civilians with no military experience launch ill-considered wars and impulsive interventions without considering the second- and third-order effects. Generals, by contrast, are reluctant to send our troops to war—they know the complexity and the cost.\nGeneral Mattis has a long list of military accomplishments, but I suspect that one of the experiences that cut deepest came in 2004, in Fallujah. After a week of brutal, successful combat his Marines stood within forty-eight hours of a clear-cut victory over a terrorist army. And the Bush administration lost its collective nerve, calling a halt just short of the finish line. I watched the tragedy unfold from northern Iraq, where I was a guest of the Kurds. And we all said the same thing to each other:  “We’ll have to go back and finish this.” And we did have to go back, in less than a year.\nHaving seen his Marines die, only to be denied victory at the eleventh hour because the global media was howling, must have been terribly painful for General Mattis. One of the many reasons he’s so widely respected in military circles—not just by Marines—is that he understands that, contrary to academic pronunciamentos, victory is not only possible, but essential.\nJim Mattis not only fights the good fight—he fights to win. With him as our next Secretary of Defense, the United States of America would win.\n\nFox News Strategic Analyst Ralph Peters is a retired U.S. Army officer and former enlisted man.

(Photo by Thearon W. Henderson/Getty Images) \nCam Newton isn't buying Richard Sherman's assertion that karma is the reason for the Carolina Panthers' poor season. The reigning NFL MVP defended his decision to take away a \"12\" flag from a Seattle Seahawks fan after last season's home playoff win, scoffing at Sherman's notion that disrespecting the flag has come back to haunt him.\n\"Where was the flag at? Was it at our house?\" Newton asked after practice Thursday, via ESPN .\nSherman was asked Wednesday if Newton's actions, crumpling the flag and throwing it to the ground, went too far after the Panthers' 31-24 win in January.\nMore from FoxSports Whitlock 1-on-1: Warren Moon on Colin Kaepernick, social protests | SPEAK FOR YOURSELF Bird Talk with Jody and Jurecki: Little things costly for the Cardinals Colin Cowherd lists all the quarterbacks he would rather have than Cam Newton | THE HERD Rob Gronkowski is reportedly out for 8 weeks - How much will it matter? | THE HERD \"Yeah, he probably did,'' Sherman said. \"I guess karma gets you. It doesn't look like you're going to be in the playoffs this year.\"\nNewton dismissed that theory Thursday.\n\"It's irrelevant what he says right now,\" Newton said. \"I have a lot of respect for Richard. I don't think that has nothing to do with karma that another opposing team's flag was in my stadium.\"\nThe two Pro Bowl players will face off Sunday night, when the 4-7 Panthers take on 7-3-1 Seahawks in Seattle.",

The bi-lateral agreement, which Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull called a “one-off,” involves 2,465 people currently being held in Papua New Guinea and Nauru who will now be transferred onto U.S. soil.\n“This is a backroom deal, wheeling and dealing with another country's refugee problem,” Center for Immigration Studies fellow Don Barnett told FoxNews.com. “I don’t believe for a moment it’s a one-time deal. That’s for public consumption.”\nThe move has also raised a red flag among Congressional oversight members.\nRead the full story at FoxNews.com→",

Keith and team are joining Twitter to help lead and strengthen our service!,\" Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey tweeted on Thursday. http://bit.ly/2fLHFrd \nJeff Seibert, who was recently head of product, stepped down from in June after being in the role for about five months. \nKevin Weil, who now heads Facebook Inc's <FB.O> Instagram product division, was with Twitter for more than five years and was vice-president of product development before Seibert. \nTwitter, which faces stagnating user growth amid stiff competition from rivals, has for months been rumored to be up for sale and hired bankers last month to field acquisition offers. \nCompanies including Walt Disney Co <DIS.N> and Alphabet Inc <GOOGL.O> were reported to be interested in the company.

      "text": "Comments The exec producer took to Twitter to share a photo collage with several pictures of more suitable footwear to be sported by Howard's Claire. \nUnlike \" Jurassic World \", the sequel apparently won't feature \"that worst possible shoes\" donned by Bryce Dallas Howard 's Claire to escape from dinosaurs. Colin Trevorrow, the director of the first movie who is now serving as an executive producer for \" Jurassic World 2 \", has confirmed that Claire won't wear high heels. Trevorrow took to Twitter on Thursday, December 1 to share a photo collage with several pictures of flat leather boots to be sported by Claire. \"See you soon,\" he wrote, promising that the Jurassic World operations manager would don more suitable footwear in the upcoming raptor movie. — Colin Trevorrow (@colintrevorrow) December 1, 2016 \"Jurassic World 2\" is expected to start filming in the coming spring for its June 22, 2018 U.S. release, with J.A. Bayona directing. Also returning in the sequel is Chris Pratt . As previously reported, B.D. Wong is expected to once again play the weaponized-dinosaur-obsessed scientist named Dr. Henry Wu. The trio will be joined by \" Sherlock \" actor Toby Jones and Rafe Spall. Additionally, a new report has emerged saying that a young actor has been added to the cast ensemble. According to The Hollywood Reporter , Baz Lurhmann's \" The Get Down \" star Justice Smith has signed on to join the upcoming movie, but details about his character are still kept under wraps. \n© AceShowbiz.com",

      "text": "Published December 2, 2016 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre 0 Email Print \n \nBy Ralph Peters \nPublished December 01, 2016 | FoxNews.com \nI’m lucky enough to know General James Mattis slightly. Just well enough to trust him unreservedly with our military and our nation’s security.\nThe president-elect could not choose a better man to be our next Secretary of Defense. Not just because Mattis is a battle-hardened Marine with a remarkable combat record. And not just because he has a mind of remarkable clarity and is, without question, the best-read general of his generation.\nI trust Jim Mattis because he’s a man of character, that most un-Washingtonian quality. His public image is of one rough-and-tough Marine, but the man I’ve encountered is, above all, one of integrity. His code of honor is so out of fashion that one has to reach back to a Victorian vocabulary:  He has a noble spirit.\nAnd he’s a genuine patriot, not a shouter with his eye on the next chance. He will do what’s right, not what’s expedient.  And he will never go along with anything he believes might harm our country.\nIn addition to plenty of dirty-boots experience in the Middle East and a deep knowledge of history—that most underrated study—Jim Mattis has another great qualification to be SecDef: He wasn’t looking for a job. He was happy in retirement, studying, helping his fellow Marines, and contributing thoughtfully to our national security behind the scenes.\nThe last time I heard from him—a bit before the election—he mentioned, not for the first time, that he was glad to be west of the Rockies. A Washington, D.C. post was not part of the plan; rather, he thought of farming in rural Washington State. \nThis matters. In an age of sycophants and clawing ambition, it’s a splendid prospect to have a classic patriot who’s willing to sacrifice to serve (as Jim Mattis already has for four decades in uniform).\nRead the full story in the Opinion Section on FoxNews.com→",

The games often involved suspense, intrigue and a healthy dose of conjecture.\nAnd so it remains today among the Washington elite as they speculate on what President-elect Donald Trump will do on December 15 when he reveals how he intends to avoid conflicts of interest by “leaving my great business.”\nAT CARRIER, TRUMP PROVES AMERICA FIRST IS AN ATTITUDE, NOT A SLOGAN What exactly does he mean by the word “leaving”?   Sell his assets?  Sell his ownership interest?  Transfer control to his children?  Convey his corporation to a trust, blind or otherwise? How does he avoid running afoul of the Emoluments Clause in the Constitution?\nWhatever he decides, you can expect a new parlour game to emerge.  One which poses the question, how long will it take Democrats to level accusations of wrongdoing?\nNot long.  And that may be their mistake.  Americans knew Donald Trump is a billionaire with vast holdings.  They knew his presidency could pose conflicts of interest.  But they elected him anyway.\nIt appears they cared more about instituting his policies than whether his businesses might also reap financial benefits.\nRead the full story in the Opinion Section on FoxNews.com→",

      "text": "Published December 2, 2016 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre 0 Email Print \n \nBy Greg Gutfeld \n \nPublished December 01, 2016 | FoxNews.com \n \nIn a recent interview in that reprehensible wad of trash called Rolling Stone, President Obama pinpointed why the Democrats lost the election. He blamed it on Fox News.\nHe initially blamed his own party for its inability to connect with voters, but then he couldn't help himself. He did what he's done in the past when faced with denial or defeat: He targeted my place of employment.\nYes, his party sucks for losing, he says. But then he adds:\n“Part of it is Fox News in every bar and restaurant in big chunks of the country.”\n8 Years Later: The #1 name in news, still giving Mr. Obama the blues? #FoxNews pic.twitter.com/uuHOMhw5xm \n— Fox News Research (@FoxNewsResearch) December 1, 2016 So, where to begin?\nFirst, let's call BS on this observation. If Barack Obama actually traveled the United States, he'd laugh at his own words. It's true that \"big chunks\" watch Fox News, but they don't have it on in their bars and restaurants, because those who are not leftists are usually not outwardly political. They have no desire to enforce their views on you.\nAnd perhaps they're used to keeping their views to themselves because people like Obama often mock them for having them. Trump's outgoingness may have changed this, but for the most part, the average non-liberal would rather talk pets than politics.\nFor the left, it's always been the reverse. For them, the personal is always political, and they have no choice but to infect every arena in life with their strident opinions. Whether it's in the work cafeteria, at Thanksgiving dinner or at a play date with assorted brats … if you're a strong, dedicated progressive, every moment in life is simply an opportunity for proclaiming evidence of your heroic, sensitive belief system.\nThose of us who aren't liberals have no such reflex. When I'm among friends or strangers and politics comes up, I generally find a way to subvert or deviate from debate. I tell a joke. I say something stupid. I comment on my assorted body aches. It's essentially what I do on The Five.\nTrue, as you enter the political season, this changes.\nRead the full story in the Opinion Section on FoxNews.com→",

      "text": "Published December 2, 2016 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre 0 Email Print \n \nWorkers don’t prosper when politicians force companies to make noneconomic decisions \n\nTHE WALL STREET JOURNAL -   A giant flaw in President Obama’s economic policy has been the politicized allocation of capital, from green energy to housing. Donald Trump suffers from a similar industrial-policy temptation, as we’ve seen this week with his arm-twisting of Carrier to change its decision to move a plant to Mexico from Indiana.\nCarrier announced Wednesday that it will retain about 1,000 jobs in Indianapolis that would have moved to Mexico over the next three years, and on Thursday Mr. Trump held a rally at the plant and claimed political credit. The President-elect had made Carrier a piñata for his trade politics during the campaign, and post-election he lobbied Gregory Hayes, the CEO of United Technologies Corp. (UTC) that owns Carrier, to reconsider.\nEveryone—even the Obama White House—is hailing the move as a great political victory, and in the short term it is for those Indianapolis workers, who make more than $20 an hour on average. But as U.S. auto workers have learned the hard way, real job security depends on the profitability of the business. Carrier wanted to move the production line to Mexico to stay competitive in the market for gas furnaces. If the extra costs of staying in Indianapolis erode that business, those workers will lose their jobs eventually in any case.\nThis isn’t to fault Mr. Hayes’s decision, since Mr. Trump made him an offer he couldn’t refuse. The state of Indiana threw in $7 million in tax incentives, but those weren’t decisive. Mr. Trump’s real hammer is his threat to impose a tariff on Carrier imports to the U.S. Carrier has a 30% share of the U.S. gas-furnace market, and a 35% tariff could kill the business. That’s the same sword Mr. Trump previously held over Ford Motor Co.\nRead the full story at the Wall Street Journal→",

      "text": "Published December 2, 2016 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre 0 Email Print \n \nBy Peter Navarro  \nPublished December 02, 2016  | FoxNews.com \nThe new dawn of American manufacturing broke Thursday with one big step for the workers of Indiana and one far bigger step for a more muscular trade policy: Carrier will stay in Indianapolis – along with more than 1,000 jobs.\nThe Never Trumpers will be quick to give others credit or attack the terms of the deal. But there is something much more important going on here that is the real story. It is a story about how the loss of America’s manufacturing base has been a politician-made disaster rather than the inevitable march of globalization.\nT HE INCREDIBLE SECRET WEAPON TRUMP BRINGS TO US-CHINA RELATIONS (AND WHY MATTERS) In this story, American multinationals like United Technologies and its Carrier subsidiary along with other marquee off-shorers like Boeing, Apple, General Motors, GE, and Intel have been operating in a world in which they have been both pushed and pulled to foreign lands – and allowed to have their way with American workers because neither the White House or the collective power of Congress has stood in their way.\nThe “push” offshore has come from excessive regulations, the highest corporate tax rate in the world, and energy and electricity costs that are needlessly burdensome.  In this case, on the regulatory front alone,, the president and CEO of UTC Climate Controls and Security told Governor Pence that 53 of the 260 new federal regulations passed since 2013 have had a direct impact on their manufacturing business.\nThe “pull” offshore comes from the lure of sweat shop labor, lax environmental regulations, the availability of export subsidies and the advantages to foreign direct investment that come from manipulated, that is undervalued, currencies.\nThe Carrier deal teaches this push and pull can be overcome with strong leadership. Here, it is true that President-elect Trump and his incredibly gifted vice president used their bully pulpits – and all of the implied powers United Technologies saw that it would face -- to keep Carrier in the fold.  But there is much more that will unfold come Inauguration Day in a world where we need far more than a bully pulpit to revitalize America’s manufacturing base. \nRead the full story in the Opinion section on FoxNews.com→",

If you need me to write emails to your bosses so you can fly to Toronto LMK. #SEAvTOR #MLSCup — Brad Evans (@brad_evans3) December 1, 2016 \nLess than 24 hours later, the man delivered. Evans posted a note on Twitter for fans to fill out and submit to their employer or school to \"excuse\" them from work ahead of the Dec. 10 MLS Cup Final at BMO Field ( 5 p.m. PT; FOX; KIRO Radio 97.3 FM, El Rey 1360am ). You ask - I deliver. Share with ALL & see you there! #SEAvTOR #MLSCup pic.twitter.com/gAMkrLraUA — Brad Evans (@brad_evans3) December 2, 2016 \nSo if you were still considering making plans, consider your decision made.

      "text": "Published December 02, 2016 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 Email Print MINNEAPOLIS (AP) The Minnesota Twins have hired James Rowson as their hitting coach.\nRowson was the minor league hitting coordinator for the New York Yankees for seven of the last nine seasons. Between stints, the 40-year-old Rowson was the hitting coach for the Chicago Cubs for 1+ seasons after a midyear promotion from minor league hitting coordinator. Rowson worked at the minor league levels with the Los Angeles Angels prior to that after a minor league playing career with the Seattle Mariners and Yankees organizations.\nWith the Twins, Rowson will replace Tom Brunansky, who was let go by the club's new front office leadership after four seasons in the role. Joe Vavra, currently the team's bench coach under Paul Molitor, was the hitting coach for seven years before Brunansky was hired.\nMore from FoxSports Royals spine-tingling moment No. 1: Salvy's walk-off, a father's tears Edinson Volquez calls it an honor to be able to play in Miami Royals spine-tingling moment No. 2: Gordon ovation at ring ceremony Bill DeWitt III on all things Cardinals",

      "text": "Published December 02, 2016 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 Email Print MINNEAPOLIS -- The Minnesota Twins have hired James Rowson as their hitting coach.\nRowson was the minor league hitting coordinator for the New York Yankees for seven of the last nine seasons. Between stints, the 40-year-old Rowson was the hitting coach for the Chicago Cubs for 1 seasons after a midyear promotion from minor league hitting coordinator. Rowson worked at the minor league levels with the Los Angeles Angels prior to that after a minor league playing career with the Seattle Mariners and Yankees organizations.\nWith the Twins, Rowson will replace Tom Brunansky, who was let go by the club's new front office leadership after four seasons in the role. Joe Vavra, currently the team's bench coach under Paul Molitor, was the hitting coach for seven years before Brunansky was hired.\nMore from FoxSports Royals spine-tingling moment No. 1: Salvy's walk-off, a father's tears Edinson Volquez calls it an honor to be able to play in Miami Royals spine-tingling moment No. 2: Gordon ovation at ring ceremony Bill DeWitt III on all things Cardinals",

      "text": "By Andrea Riquier\nPaychecks are nearly 7% higher for lower-paid workers in states that increased the minimum wage\nEarly Friday morning, the Labor Department released a strong jobs report for November: 178,000 net new jobs created and a nine-year low for the unemployment rate.\nShortly after the numbers hit, Jason Furman, chairman of the White House's Council of Economic Advisors, tweeted about the report (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/us-jobless-rates-hits-nine-year-low-of-46-in-november-2016-12-02).\n(https://twitter.com/CEAChair/status/804696000334069760)\nFurman had a few thoughts on the effects of the recent spate of state minimum wage increases, many of which were enacted amid criticism that higher wages would depress hiring and economic activity.\n(https://twitter.com/CEAChair/status/804696644759539713)\nHe drilled down on the leisure space:\n(https://twitter.com/CEAChair/status/804697196918669312)\nFurman's victory lap on the strength of the economy is a bit more clear-cut than his take on the minimum wage. The Obama administration has backed various efforts to raise the federal minimum wage, with little success.\nRead: This is why you can't survive on the minimum wage (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/this-is-why-you-cant-survive-on-the-minimum-wage-2016-10-25)\nAnd President-elect Trump has said (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/trump-let-states-decide-minimum-wage-sarah-palin-will-work-to-defeat-paul-ryan-revised-puerto-rico-bill-eyed-2016-05-09) he thinks decisions on the minimum wage should be left to states.\nFurman's tweets Friday came barely a day after wealth manager and pundit Barry Ritholtz emphasized that a higher minimum wage in Seattle, which many analysts feared would crush the local economy, had the opposite effect, at least so far.\n(https://twitter.com/ritholtz/status/804436726018031616)\nThe jobless rate in Seattle is 3.4%, the restaurant business is \"booming,\" and \"the minimum wage experiment is over,\" Ritholtz wrote in his column.\n-Andrea Riquier;\n 1116ET\n ",

      "text": "When asked if Trump could potentially be banned if he violates Twitter’s policies, the company said, “The Twitter Rules apply to all accounts, including verified accounts.” \nTrump wouldn’t be the first to be banned from the site. \nMilo Yiannopoulos, an editor at the conservative news website Breitbart, was banned in July after he tweeted that Ghostbusters actress Leslie Jones was “barely literate,” and urged his followers to attack Jones. After the actress was pelted with racist and sexist remarks she reported Yiannopoulos for the abuse. \nTwitter has recently taken new steps to curb online bullying by expanding its “mute” function and making it easier to report online abuse. The company said earlier this month that online abuse on its platform has “risen sharply” over the years. On the same day Twitter introduced new steps to curb online abuse, the company removed numerous alt-right accounts .

      "text": "Ronald Glasser (via Twitter) \n*Earlier we reported on the shooting death of former NFL player Joe McKnight in Louisiana. \nNow we’ve learned that the man who shot him, Ronald Glasser , in a supposed fit of road rage, has been released from custody and no charges have been filed in the case. \nGasser, 54-year-old white male, was questioned by the Jefferson Parish Sheriff’d Dept. and released “sometime overnight” after officials believed they had no reason to hold him any longer. \nThe Sheriff’s Dept. told TMZ that Gasser “definitely” shot the ex-NFL running back — but there are “questions about the circumstances surrounding what led up to it.” \nThe rep says the investigation is ongoing and the case would go to the grand jury or the DA’s office. \nREAD RELATED STORY: KANYE WEST: LEAKED 911 CALL REVEALS DOC’S CONCERN FOR HIS HEALTH AND SAFETY \nMeanwhile, 50 Cent is going on the record saying that – like a lot of observer – he noticed that Kanye West was dropping hints he was in a bad place before his emotional and mental meltdown. \n50 cstood up for ‘Kanye on “Watch What Happens Live” Thursday night as Andy Cohen fired off questions about Kanye’s condition, the Paris robbery and Kanye’s insurance claim for cancelled tour dates. \nAs you know, Fifty is known for not cutting other celebs any slack when they’re dealing with a problem, but we suppose he was feeling magnanimous toward Kanye ’cause he did speak kindly.",

She said she at first tried to laugh off the cheating rumors but admitted it made her feel insecure.\n\"Chris and I, we talk about this a lot,\" Faris told fellow actress Isla Fisher on Faris' podcast \"Anna Faris Is Unqualified.\" \"We grapple with a lot of the ideas of being a public couple.\"\nTheir first challenge as a couple happened one year ago when Faris said \"there were some tabloid rumors about strain in our relationship.\"\nThey tried to brush it off but Faris recalls feeling \"so hurt in a way that bothered\" her.\n\"I didn’t want to think of myself as somebody who could be bothered by...tabloid s--t.\"\nShe added, \"It made me feel incredibly very insecure.\"\nFisher asked Faris what about the rumors hurt her the most.\n\"I think it was a combination of things,\" Faris replied. \"I take pride in how great my relationship is with Chris, but having said that, of course, in this crazy world where he’s off doing movies and I’m in L.A. raising our child, of course I’m going to feel vulnerable, like any normal human would.\"\nFaris and Pratt married in 2009.

      "text": "Published December 02, 2016 FoxNews.com Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print   \nIf you need a gift idea for the holiday season, you can now buy small, powerful, rare earth magnets known generally as Buckyballs.\nOnce regulated and banned because of the danger they pose to kids— they can cause very serious injuries requiring surgery— the magnets are now available for purchase again, following a ruling by the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit that overturned the ban.\nThe decision is a landmark moment in a long dispute that dates back to 2009, after a man named Craig Zucker started selling Buckyballs and then later  clashed  with the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC). The commission was concerned about the hazards of the powerful small magnets to children.\n'BUCKYBALLS' MAGNATE SAYS FEDS TOOK HIM DOWN FOR SPEAKING OUT \n“Specifically, if two or more magnets are ingested—a temptation to which children are especially at risk—they can cause serious damage to intestinal tissue that becomes tightly clamped between them,” the recent court ruling  explains  in background section.\nThat recent court decision overturned the ban on the magnets that are commonly used a desktop distraction. Zen Magnets, which makes “Buckyball”-like little magnets that it says are much more powerful than a typical refrigerator magnet, celebrated the victory.\n“A week ago there was no acceptable warning, no acceptable age, no sales restriction nor waiver that allowed production of magnets like Zen Magnets, Buckyballs, Neoballs, Magnicube or Neocubes,” Zen magnets wrote in a post on their website.\n“Today we are excited to  once again take orders  of Zen Magnets for immediate production,” they added.",

      "text": "By Perry Chiaramonte \nPublished December 02, 2016 FoxNews.com Facebook 0 Twitter 0 Email Print Over 4,000 migrants have died while crossing the Mediterranean Sea in 2016, the highest amount to date.  (Mathieu Willcocks) \nThis year is set to become the deadliest on record for migrants and refugees crossing the Mediterranean Sea.\nThe number of people who perished traversing the sea in hopes of a better life in Europe has reached nearly 4,300 for 2016. The rising death toll comes despite a decrease in the number of people crossing the Mediterranean, but most of this year’s deaths have occurred on one specific route—from Libya to Italy.\nThe rise in deaths may be due to increasingly ruthless smugglers capitalizing on the ongoing refugee crisis, according to officials at the Migrant Offshore Aid Station (MOAS.)\n“[Our] research and analysis suggests that this change in approach might be both an attempt to maximize opportunity and meet demand on the part of the smugglers,” reads a statement  from MOAS officials. “The smuggling networks appear to be industrializing, with increased competition representing a new challenge for them in procuring enough rubber boats, engines, and fuel containers to meet the demand.”\nDEDICATED CREWS PLUCK DESPERATE REFUGEES FROM DANGEROUS WATERS \nRelated Image Expand / Contract The number of people crossing the Mediterranean as a whole has actually decreased when compared to previous years, but a majority of these deaths are occurring on one specific route and may be attributed to greedy smugglers capitalizing on the ongoing refugee crisis. (Mathieu Willcocks) \nThe rescue organization charges that smugglers are cutting corners by packing unprecedented numbers of migrants and refugees, often in the hundreds, onto unseaworthy rubber boats and dinghies.\n“The combination of heavier loads and inferior quality is a recipe for disaster”, MOAS Head of Operations Ian Ruggier said in the statement. “Rescue assets have had to deal with increased challenges. There is no doubt that the vessels are built to last a few miles to see people beyond Libyan territorial waters”.\nMOAS officials say that it’s almost certain that the true death toll is much higher than the grim, official figure.\nFoxNews.com first reported on the peril faced by refugees crossing the Mediterranean in October in an interview with one relief worker, Janelle Eli, who volunteered for rescue efforts aboard the vessels operated by MOAS.\n“I never understood how dangerous the journey from Libya to Europe by sea could be until I saw it with my own eyes,” Eli, who also works with the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies , said in a new interview with Foxnews.com regarding the latest numbers from MOAS.\n“When we spotted flimsy rafts and boats with our searchlight in the pitch dark, my heart always skipped a beat,\" she said. \"We could see through binoculars that rubber rafts were bowing under the weight of so many people. Hundreds of eyes looking back at us —  stunned and panicked, but hopeful they’d be rescued.”\nEli said deaths are caused by a host of reasons.\nRelated Image Expand / Contract MOAS officials say that it’s almost certain that the true death toll is much higher than the record figure of 4,300 people. (Mathieu Willcocks) \nRelated Image Expand / Contract Rescue outfit MOAS has longed called for the creation of safe and legal routes for migrants and refugees to minimize the danger and death. (mathieu willcocks) \n“[D]rowning isn’t the only cause of death,” she said. “Others die from dehydration, hypothermia, hyperthermia, fuel burns, asphyxiation, crush injuries from overcrowding, or wounds from being beaten by smugglers or captors in Libya.”\n\nPerry Chiaramonte is a reporter for FoxNews.com.

The study out of the University of Wisconsin focused on working memory, which covers immediate stuff like new phone numbers or where we left our car keys.\nThe prevailing theory on this type of memory has long been that the information disappears if a person tucks it away and doesn't think about it for a while.\nBut the researchers found that the memory does, in fact, remain stored in the brain and can be essentially zapped back into play through magnetic stimulation to specific cells, they report in Science .\nMore From Newser Take that, Martin Shkreli: Schoolkids cook up $2 dose",

      "text": "By Maxim Lott \nPublished December 02, 2016 FoxNews.com Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print   \nThe social media site Reddit.com, which has hundreds of millions of users, has begun censoring one the site’s most active communities: supporters of President-elect Donald Trump.\nThe trouble began over the Thanksgiving holiday when Reddit’s CEO, Steve Huffman, secretly used his administrative access to the site to alter angry comments directed at him – changing the text of the comments to make them appear directed at Trump supporters on the site instead.\nAfter an uproar, Huffman admitted doing that and said “as the CEO, I shouldn’t play such games, and it’s all fixed now… I most assuredly won’t do this again.”\nBut Wednesday, while issuing a further apology, Huffman announced that due to some “toxic” users, he would begin to censor all posts in a pro-Trump section of the site (called “ r/The_Donald ”) by limiting the ability of posts there to reach what many consider the “front page” of Reddit – where the posts get seen by a wider audience.\nREDDIT ADMINISTRATORS ACCUSED OF CENSORSHIP \nHuffman added: “We have identified hundreds of the most toxic users and are taking action against them, ranging from warnings to timeouts to permanent bans.”\nReddit’s “ r/The_Donald ” community has more than 300,000 users, who are known for being both enthusiastic and irreverent. In July, Donald Trump visited the page and answered fans’ questions there.\nReddit and the company that owns it, Advance Publications, did not respond to requests for comment.\nHuffman also hinted that he may further target the Trump section of Reddit. Responding to a question Thursday about whether the new limits impacted anyone besides the “ r/The_Donald ” community, he replied, “Right now, just them… Going forward, we'll just take away their toys specifically and move on.”\nREDDIT UPDATES CONTENT POLICY, BANS A 'HANDFUL' OF GROUPS THAT EXIST 'SOLELY TO ANNOY' OTHERS \nMany Reddit users welcomed their CEO’s crackdown on the Trump section, with some saying he should go further.\n“’The_donald’ is not something that should be on Reddit… It should be banned, along with all its members,” user “Tyler_Vakarian” wrote.\nThe volunteer moderators who support and run the Trump section of Reddit told FoxNews.com through a spokesperson (user “PrinceCamelton”) that they were not surprised by the censorship given censorship by other social media CEOs such as Twitter’s Jack Dorsey – but were surprised that Huffman had not apologized to the users of r/The_Donald for using his administrative access to falsely direct angry comments towards them.\n“Huffman has not directly issued our community an apology. Instead, he has the audacity to call us ‘toxic.’ They are trying to control and push the radical left-wing narrative that our country has turned away by electing Mr. Trump.”\nACTOR JAMES WOODS LEAVES TWITTER OVER ALT-RIGHT 'CENSORSHIP' \nThe moderators added that their section of Reddit does not allow either hateful comments or harassment.\n“We are not a toxic community. Huffman is trying to frame us as a community that harbors harassment. This couldn't be any further from the truth. We have let our community know multiple times that we do not support harassment. We've even been complimented by the Staff Coordinator of Reddit,” moderators from “ r/The_Donald ” told FoxNews.com in an emailed statement.\nThe moderators said that despite the limits imposed on them, they will continue spreading their pro-Trump message on the site as long as they are allowed to.\n“We live in a phenomenal information age that makes it so easy to pass on information. Do not allow these radical leftists push you around. Stand up for what you believe in.”\nThe author, Maxim Lott, is Supervising Producer for the Stossel show on Fox Business and a creator of  ElectionBettingOdds.com .

In the 1940s, he was in charge of running banquets for the Chinese Nationalist government. But a military uprising in the country forced his family to flee to Taiwan. \nMCDONALD'S FRANCHISE OWNER WHO INVENTED THE BIG MAC DIES \nHe created the dish in 1952 during a four-day visit from U.S. Seventh Fleet commander Admiral Arthur W. Radford.\nThe dish consists of fried, breaded chicken chunks tossed in a thick, sugary ginger-garlic sauce. It is usually served with broccoli and rice\nHero down. All fall silent. Wu-Tangy forever. \"Inventor of General Tso's Chicken dies in Taipei at age 98\" https://t.co/CRTYtmOoKF pic.twitter.com/P9lWBjvwAH \n— pourmecoffee (@pourmecoffee) December 2, 2016 \n\nThe chef named the dish in honor of Tso Tsung T'ang, a respected Hunan war general.\nAMERICA'S BEST CHINESE RESTAURANTS \nThe dish made it to America when the chef opened a restaurant in New York City in 1973. Located near the United Nations, the restaurant drew large crowds and high praise from many high profile diners, including U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger. The New York Times first wrote about the dish in 1977 praising it as “a stir‐fried masterpiece, sizzling hot in both flavor and temperature.”\nFans of the dish are already morning the chef’s death online:\nThe inventor of General Tso's chicken has died, just days after the Big Mac guy passed on. Sad time for guys like me with bad diets. #RIP \n— Jim Hayes (@TheCatOnFox) December 2, 2016 \n\nWe lose the inventor of the Big Mac AND General Tso's chicken in the same week?! WHY?!? WHYYY?!? pic.twitter.com/faQ13pFcsk \n— Damon Amendolara (@DAonCBS) December 2, 2016 \n\nA 2014 documentary, \"The Search for General Tso,\" chronicled the origins of the iconic dish and the famed general behind it. That same year, Peng was honored by the Taipei city government as an “outstanding citizen” for his culinary creation.",

      "text": "Published December 2, 2016 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre 0 Email Print \nBy Newt Gingrich, Fox News \nWe have a successful President-elect before he is even sworn in. We have 1,100 excited families looking forward to a happy Christmas when for weeks they had been sick with worry about their futures. And we have a news media unable to report on success.\nHow? President-elect Donald Trump convinced Carrier to keep 1,100 jobs in the United States. He was helped by Vice President-elect Mike Pence who had additional interest in and leverage over this decision because he is Governor of Indiana where Carrier is located.\nThe people employed at Carrier are ecstatic.\nThey were about to face a gloomy Christmas. Now they have their jobs and they are thrilled that the President-elect intervened decisively and successfully.\nThis was actually Trump's second intervention. (He earlier convinced Ford not to move one of its assembly lines to Mexico.) But because the media focused so much on the 1,100 jobs, and because Carrier's management had been so much more public about its determination to move to Mexico, the Carrier case has acquired much more intensity and importance than Ford.\nThere are several important points about this achievement.\nFirst, this was pure Trumpism. Don't wait to be inaugurated. Don't spend a lot of time with staff studying the issue. Don't delegate to someone else and hope for the best.\nTrumpism includes intuitive decisions followed by rapid, personal intervention to force success. Its clearest predecessor in style was President Theodore Roosevelt. Trump is similar to Roosevelt in the sheer exuberant energy with which he lives out each day.\nread more at foxnews.com→",

      "text": "  \nTwitter has finally found a VP of product — having left the executive position vacant for almost a year — thanks to its new acquisition. \nThe company just snapped up Yes Inc., a small San Francisco-based startup best known for its social messaging apps Frenzy and WYD. With the purchase comes the announcement that Yes founder Keith Coleman is assuming the important role. \nMore: Twitter will now rank your conversations and count your tweet replies \nColeman previously spent more than ten years as director of product management at Google, where he served as the lead on offerings such as Gmail, Gchat, and other Google products. \nIn Coleman’s words, Yes was a “little” company, and now it is joining the ranks of a much larger organization. According to the startup’s website , its other employees helped build products like Android and PayPal. As a result of the acquisition, the company’s apps will be shutting down over the coming weeks. \n“Our team has always admired Twitter, a product that brings the whole world closer,” reads a statement posted on Yes’ website. “Twitter also speaks to our love of working at a global scale.” \nKeith Coleman, via LinkedIn \nAs head of Twitter’s product team, Coleman will be charged with developing new user experience features for the platform. It’s a tumultuous role, with five individuals having served as head of product since 2007, four of whom arrived in the wake of Twitter’s IPO in 2013. \nSome will say it’s just business as usual for the company, which by now is used to its fair share of ups and downs. This year alone, Twitter cut 9 percent of its workforce, axed its once-popular video-looping app Vine , and lost a number of executives . And that’s not to mention the drama regarding its highly publicized (failed) attempt at offering itself up for a takeover or merger. \nIn terms of recent product changes, Twitter has pursued live video with notable broadcasting deals, and it pushed through a keyword filter aimed at combating harassment. If he can pin down the position, these are the types of consumer-oriented products Coleman will oversee. Maybe he can even put to rest the conundrum that continues to baffle onlookers: what exactly is Twitter? That’s a question that even CEO Jack Dorsey reportedly hasn’t been able to offer a concrete answer to. Also watch:",

      "text": "\nThe Twitter logo is shown at its corporate headquarters in San Francisco Thomson Reuters \nBy Tim Baysinger \n(Reuters) - Twitter Inc has signed a major livestreaming deal with its first Asian partner, Globe Telecom Inc of the Philippines, for its two exclusive U.S. National Basketball Association shows, the companies said on Thursday. \nGlobe will advertise on Twitter's livestream of \"The Starters\" and \"The Warmups\" to the telecom provider's digital audiences, they said in a statement. The shows, produced by Time Warner Inc's Turner Sports, will air only on Twitter throughout the basketball league's season from late October through June. \nFinancial details were not disclosed. \nThe Philippines is one of the NBA's biggest international markets, especially online. The league recently opened its fourth NBA Store in the island province of Cebu. \nBasketball content will be created specifically for Twitter and Globe ads will run on highlight clips aired on the social media platform in the region. \nTwitter has made livestreaming video integral to its future as user and revenue growth from other forms of advertising has flattened. The company has signed numerous deals with U.S. college and professional sports leagues, most notably the National Football League, and partnered with media companies on the U.S. presidential debates and election night coverage. \nHowever, many analysts believe Twitter's best chance to increase its ad revenue growth could lie overseas. \nIn its third-quarter earnings report, Twitter said overall ad revenue grew by just 6 percent year-over-year, mainly driven by 21 percent growth in international markets. Its U.S.-based ad revenue was down 2 percent. \nA report issued by eMarketer on Wednesday found that more U.S. advertisers are planning to use Facebook Inc's Instagram than Twitter for the first time. \nShares of Twitter fell 2.3 percent to $18.07 on the New York Stock Exchange early Thursday afternoon. \nNinety percent of male Twitter users in the Philippines are interested in basketball, with 76 percent of them actively following and watching the NBA, Maya Hari, Twitter's managing director for Southeast Asia and India, said in the statement. \nIn May, NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said that more than half of the viewers on the association's YouTube channel was outside the United States, led by the Philippines. \n(Reporting by Tim Baysinger; Editing by Richard Chang) Read the original article on Reuters .

      "text": "San Bernardino terror attack remembered by city Published December 03, 2016 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 Email Print People stand by a make shift memorial for county workers near the Inland Regional Center in San Bernardino, Calif., Friday, Dec. 2, 2016. (The Associated Press) \nSAN BERNARDINO, Calif. – Exactly a year to the moment that a pair of shooters unleashed a terrorist attack on San Bernardino, a bell rang 14 times Friday at the city's Inland Regional Center in honor of the people who died there. \n\"We will never forget that day or the victims of this senseless act of violence. We strive to move forward and search for the good that is in us all,\" said Lavinia Johnson, the center's executive director. \nDuring the ceremony outside the center, employees of nearby businesses who sheltered people during the chaos were also thanked by Keith Nelson, the center's chairman. \nIn all, 14 people were killed and 22 wounded. \nAmong those attending the ceremony was Zen Martinsen, 56, a clerical supervisor for San Bernardino County. While she didn't know the victims who had gathered at the center for a county event that day, she said all county employees are like family. \n\"This affects everybody and I think it's just really important that terrorism doesn't win,\" she said. \"We can't let it win.\" \nThe ceremony was just one of a series of events scheduled in the hardscrabble city of 216,000 people east of Los Angeles to mark the anniversary of the Dec. 2, 2015, attack by husband-and-wife assailants on a holiday luncheon for county health employees. Investigators say the attackers were inspired by the Islamic State group. \nEarlier, cyclists conducted a 14-mile bike ride — one mile for each person who was killed. More on this... OSU terror suspect's radicalizing videos may have carried all-American advertisements \nFriday evening some 500 people gathered at California State University, San Bernardino's, Caussoulis Arena for a somber memorial for the victims. \nAmong the numerous speakers, which included the city's police chief and mayor, was Julie Swann-Paez, who was gravely wounded by the shooters. \nSwann-Paez, whose pelvis was shattered by a bullet, spoke warmly, and sometimes humorously of each of those killed. Still, she choked up from time to time, while some in the audience wept. \nMost of those killed in the attack by county health inspector Syed Rizwan Farook, and Farook's Pakistani wife Tashfeen Malik, were Farook's colleagues. \nWhile the city of San Bernardino has been grappling with a spike in homicides this year, community residents have worked hard to prevent a hate-filled backlash to the terror attack. Clergy have formed an interfaith alliance, victims' families have encouraged tolerance and Muslim residents undertook a campaign to educate neighbors about Islam. \nSince the attack, San Bernardino police Sgt. Emil Kokesh said he has also been reminded of the need to stay fit. Kokesh arrived at the scene of the onslaught minutes after the shooting and was there for more than a day. He said he was sore for two weeks, which prompted him to take up cycling to get in shape with some fellow officers. \nThat led to the memorial bike ride. \n\"On that day, it pushed a lot of us to our limits — physically, mentally, and emotionally,\" he said. Now, Kokesh said he often reminds his fellow officers: \"You may work in an office, you may do investigations, and not do much field work anymore, but you are going to be the ones who respond to something like this, so stay fit, stay prepared.\" \nThe Inland Regional Center provides case management services for people with developmental disabilities, cerebral palsy, epilepsy and autism. The building where the attack occurred is still closed and is undergoing remodeling. It is expected to reopen in early 2017, and a memorial to the victims is planned, Kevin Urtz, the center's associate executive director said. Advertisement",

Thank you!\nInteresting how the U.S. sells Taiwan billions of dollars of military equipment but I should not accept a congratulatory call.\nTaiwanese media is reporting the Trump team initiated the call, but regardless of who the call came from, it could potentially incite backlash from China for its \" One-China policy\" w ith the United States. For the agreement, started by former President Jimmy Carter in 1978, the U.S. acknowledges Beijing as China's only center of power, excluding Taiwan and its capital Taipei.\nIn response to Trump's call with the Taiwanese president, China's state-run CCTV issued a statement saying the president-elect made \"an unprecedented break with the One-China policy and accepted U S-Mainland protocol\" and the country \"firmly opposes official contact in any form between Washington and Taipei.\"\nTrump's phone call, and corresponding tweets, have brought newfound concerns on how Trump's four years in office could pan out. Many expressed these thoughts on Twitter — some of which centered on Trump's apparent business interests in Taiwan conflicting with his responsibilities as president.\nI know when that hotline bling That can only mean one thing* *(decades of fragile diplomacy are about to be trampled upon) https://t.co/MEW1hhBcPV\n(2) What has happened in the last 48 hours is not a shift. These are major pivots in foreign policy w/out any plan. That's how wars start.\nThis tweet is an admission that Trump got played like a fool and his team is not ready for prime time https://t.co/oCRHIvk8hr\nStory is not: Trump broke diplomatic norms by calling Taiwan. Story is his motives are suspect. He's seeking to expand his business there.\nSo did Trump just risk serious international conflict to further his business interests? This is not at all a ridiculous question to ask\nI can report from London that Trump's goal of a less predictable and reliable America has already been magnificently accomplished.\nI don't think Americans have fully pondered what a deep decline their national reputation is about to suffer.\nIt's not who calls who. God, things are getting stupid. https://t.co/XEBEckFv2s\nTrump can disavow the call by pleading ignorance if that turns out to be optimal, risk is in emboldening Taiwan more than from China side.\nThough it's been echoed in the past, perhaps the president-elect should finally delete his account .",

Mandatory Credit: James Snook-USA TODAY Sports \nMark Helfrich could read the writing on the wall weeks before he was fired as Oregon's head coach. And he even reached out to Chip Kelly to ease the awkwardness in case the San Francisco 49ers' head coach had any desire to return to the Ducks.\nHelfrich, who was fired by Oregon on Tuesday after four seasons leading the program, was on Kelly's coaching staff before Kelly left for the NFL after the 2012 season.\nBecause Helfrich knew he was on the hot seat in the midst of a 4-8 season -- and because Kelly hasn't exactly found the success he'd hoped for in the NFL -- he gave Kelly a call. Helfrich detailed that conversation during an appearance on ESPN Radio on Friday. From that interview:\nMore from FoxSports 2016-17 Washington Huskies capture the Pac-12 title | 2016 College Football Highlights Jake Browning found John Ross for unusual Washington TD Washington Huskies awarded 2016 Pac-12 Championship Trophy Taylor Rapp returns Sefo Liufau's interception for a Washington touchdown Helfrich's full comments regarding Chip Kelly: pic.twitter.com/iMCeZjApNI \n— Tyson Alger (@tysonalger) December 2, 2016 Helfrich also admitted that he was thinking about his assistants and staff members when he reached out to Kelly.\n\"When you start thinking of your assistants and all your support staff, if he were to come back, some of those people would be safe,\" Helfrich said. \"Just trying to take our personal relationship out of it, remove me from the equation, and let him think of it that way.\" \nNot long after Helfrich's dismissal, however, Kelly said he wasn't interested in returning to Oregon and had no plans to leave the 49ers. In his first season with San Francisco, Kelly is 1-10. He was fired by the Philadelphia Eagles toward the end of the 2015 after three years as their head coach.",

      "text": "By Andrew Lynch \nPublished December 03, 2016 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 Email Print You've almost certainly heard of a playoff beard, a staple of offensive linemen and hockey players the world over. Consider this the polar opposite -- a tanking beard, perhaps.\nBrowns fan and FOX8 Cleveland meteorologist Scott Sabol made a commitment in the early part of the 2016 NFL season: he wouldn't shave his beard until the Browns, currently 0-12, won a game.\nFor clarification I'm growing my beard until either the Browns win or the end of the season, whatever comes first pic.twitter.com/TKFzXHGKP3 \n— Scott Sabol (@ScottSabolFOX8) October 12, 2016 More from FoxSports Philip Rivers on Antonio Gates' career and the touchdown record Could Rob Gronkowski be out in New England? | SPEAK FOR YOURSELF Recent Chargers relocation story is just opinions stirring the pot Should Chargers fans be worried about the latest relocation news? By Week 8, when Cleveland nearly knocked off the New York Jets, Sabol looked to be regretting his decision:\nBrowns Beard 2016: Day#52 #ihateselfies pic.twitter.com/NPBCMNLwhp \n— Scott Sabol (@ScottSabolFOX8) October 30, 2016 Now, though, with Cleveland 0-12 and no relief in sight, Sabol looks like a veritable mountainman:\nI fluffed up the Browns \"0-for beard\" today marking day#83. Last game of season would be Day#115 #beards #0-16 #browns pic.twitter.com/VDdeGTN1gX \n— Scott Sabol (@ScottSabolFOX8) November 30, 2016 The more pedantic among us might point out that Sabol clearly trimmed his beard from time to time, but that's literally splitting hairs. The man has a job to do and a (semi-)professional appearance to maintain, after all. If anything, his bosses deserve kudos for going along with the shtick.\nSeriously, look at that bearded face one more time:\nFortunately for Sabol, he's only committed to this bit until the season mercifully ends (assuming the Browns don't get a win before that, anyway). We asked our photo department to come up with an interpretation of what Sabol might look like if he were to grow his beard until Cleveland won their next game, regardless of the season, and this is what they came up with:\nTruly, though, this is making a sacrifice for your team -- especially when you're as handsome as Sabol:\nCleveland weatherman is sporting an enormous bushy beard since the Browns are winless https://t.co/ghEbIkOIE0 pic.twitter.com/DFYd4CyVsY \n— Las Vegas NV Blog (@LasVegasNvBlog) December 3, 2016 Beards aren't the only way Browns fans are \"celebrating\" their team's perfectly imperfect record; some Cleveland-area supporters are planning a parade should the Browns join the 2008 Detroit Lions as the only teams to finish 0-16.\nFor now, the big question is whether Sabol will be able to find relief before the final seconds tick off the clock of the Browns' Week 17 game in Pittsburgh on Jan. 1. Sabol's beard-based nightmare will continue for at least one more week, of course, since Cleveland is on a bye. The Browns then face the Bengals in Week 14, before traveling to Buffalo in Week 15, hosting the Chargers the following Saturday on Christmas Eve, and taking on the Steelers in that aforementioned season-ending game.\nGood luck, sir. You're going to need it.\n( Thanks to Sports Illustrated for sharing .)",

      "text": "Published December 03, 2016 Associated Press Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print   \nALEPPO, Syria –   Syrian warplanes, artillery and mortar rounds pounded areas in eastern Aleppo on Saturday drawing rebel rockets, as government troops gain new ground in the shrinking opposition-held enclave.\nAfter four years of holding nearly half of the divided city, rebel fighters have been increasingly squeezed into the center of the eastern enclave. Government and allied troops, including Lebanese, Iraqi and Iranian fighters, have concentrated their fight on the northeastern part of the enclave, swiftly taking new districts since their offensive began last week. Another front on the southern outskirts of the city has been slower, as rebel fighters push back government advances there.\nThe advances have caused massive displacement. The U.N. estimated that more than 31,000 have already fled their homes, either to government or Kurdish areas, or deeper into the besieged enclave. The fighting has also intensified the rebel shelling of government-held areas in Aleppo.\nThe state broadcaster al-Ikhbariya said \"precise operations\" by government and allied troops aim to rout out \"terrorists,\" which is how the government refers to all armed opposition groups.\nRelated Image Expand / Contract Syrian army soldiers flash V for Victory signs as they patrol in east Aleppo, Syria, Dec. 3. (AP) \nThe sound of war prevailed in the city early Saturday. Warplanes made several runs overhead, drawing what appeared to be rebel machine gun fire toward the aircraft.\nThe Russian Interfax news agency report quoted an unnamed Syrian military official as saying that a light ground attack aircraft, L-39 jet, was shot down near Aleppo, and its crew was killed. The opposition Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which relies on a network of activists on the ground, said two pilots were killed when rebel fighters targeted the aircraft as it approached Aleppo airport to the east of the city.\nAsked about reports of the downed plane, Syrian army spokesman Brig. Gen. Samir Suleiman said \"we have no such information about such an incident and when such things happen the army announces them.\" He was speaking to reporters in Aleppo.\nSuleiman said the Syrian army has regained control of 45-to-50 percent of east Aleppo, and accused insurgents of hiding among civilians.\nSyria's Defense Minister and other senior officers visited newly captured areas in Aleppo on Saturday, according to state-run media.\nThe Syrian Civil Defense in eastern Aleppo said six people were killed in bombings of the central al-Shaar neighborhood. Opposition news agency Thiqa also put the death toll at six. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights put the death toll at three, adding it was likely to rise. In government-held Aleppo, rebel shelling killed five people, according to the state news agency SANA.\nTo the south of the city, government cannons could be heard firing toward rebel-held areas.\nRelated Image Expand / Contract Smoke rises in east Aleppo after insurgent militants launch a mortar shell on government soldiers, Syria, Dec. 3. (AP) \nResidents in eastern Aleppo also reported intense shelling in al-Sukkari neighborhood on the southern edge of the enclave, where many of the newly displaced have sought refuge.\n\"The noose is tightening quickly,\" said Mohammed Abu Jaafar, a medical official in besieged eastern Aleppo. \"Our resources are also running low and beginning to disappear.\"\nThe bombings Saturday came hours after government troops made new advances on eastern parts of the enclave, including in Tariq al-Bab and al-Khaterji districts. State media reported that government and allied troops have moved in on new neighborhoods, pushing one kilometer (0.6 mile) deeper into the enclave from the far east.\nThe new advances tighten the government's grip on the enclave and reduce the territory the rebels hold by more than half, according to the Observatory.\nThe new advances also secure the airport road east of Aleppo, leading to the city's international airport and a military airbase. The pan-Arab Mayadeen TV station said intense bombing in eastern Aleppo was designed to ensure rebels have been cleared from the airport road.\nMoscow, a main backer of the Syrian government, says its warplanes haven't bombed Aleppo since Oct. 18. But the Russian military has helped fend off rebel attempts to break the siege of the city.\n\"We and the Russians are allies and everything that is happening is coordinated between Russian and Syrian leadership,\" said Syrian army spokesman Suleiman.\nRussian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said Moscow is ready to hold quick talks with the U.S. \"'to ensure the withdrawal of all rebels without exception from eastern Aleppo, ensure humanitarian supplies to the city residents and the restoration of normal life in eastern Aleppo.\"\nLavrov and U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry will meet in Geneva early next week. After their meeting in Rome Friday, Lavrov said Kerry gave him Washington's proposals for settling the situation in Aleppo, which he described as conforming to Russia's longtime offers. Lavrov said Moscow is ready to immediately send its experts to Geneva for talks with the U.S. to coordinate.",

      "title": "Fans know Big Ten championship game lacks relevance",
      "text": "Published December 03, 2016 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 Email Print INDIANAPOLIS, Ind. -- It's right there, in bold type, on the College Football Playoff website.\n\"Every Game Counts.\" Well, and sorry if this seems a little weird, truth is that maybe not quite every game. Maybe the game that does not count is a conference championship game, like Saturday night's Big Ten matchup of Penn State and Wisconsin, and try to explain that one.\nBecause, in the very next paragraph, the playoff website's criteria go on to proclaim, \"The selection committee ranks the teams based on conference championships won . . .\"\nMore from FoxSports (9) Oklahoma takes down (10) Oklahoma State, wins Big 12 Kansas State Wildcats take down TCU Horned Frogs in Fort Worth 2016-17 Washington Huskies capture the Pac-12 title | 2016 College Football Highlights Washington Huskies awarded 2016 Pac-12 Championship Trophy In other words, a conference championship is the key factor.\nExcept when it isn't.\nCritics used to mock the people who run the college football bowl games because they paraded around looking like peacocks in all those brightly colored blazers with their oversize logos, spending fall weekends wining and dining athletic directors.\nWell, those guys look like Einstein compared to the clowns now in charge of the college playoff.\nThey played the Big Ten championship game Saturday night at the dome in Indianapolis, and as game time approached, tickets could be had for less than $10, which should give you some idea of what the public thought of it.\nAnd about a dozen hours after the end of the game, Ohio State, which failed even to qualify for the conference title game, is expected to be chosen one of the four teams for the college playoff.\nThe Big Ten champion will finish the season with a high place in the national rankings and a boost in its recruiting. It just will not be given a chance to play for the national championship, not be allowed a Cinderella champion like Texas Western in 1966 or a Villanova in 1985 in the NCAA basketball tournament.\nThe consolation prize will be a trip to the Rose Bowl.\nThat's not bad.\nAnd, an argument can be made that Ohio State was the best team in the Big Ten this year, anyway, and maybe it was, although it lost to Penn State and beat Michigan only because of a few dunderhead plays by the Wolverines in critical spots. But the point is the Buckeyes did not even win their conference championship and they are going to get a chance to play for the national championship and the team(s) that finished ahead of them in the conference are not.\nYou have to wonder what the geniuses who dreamed up the college playoff were thinking when, by design, they guaranteed a degree of controversy by setting up a four-team playoff among five power conferences. In other words, you know you are starting out by leaving out one of the conference champions. Period.\nIt's a small step from there to leaving out another.\nThe playoff, of course, was supposedly designed to eliminate the controversy that occurred in the past when the national champion was decided by a vote instead of, oh, say, an actual game. Which is how an undefeated Nebraska was selected over an undefeated Penn State in 1994 or several years when two groups of voters selected different teams as national champions, giving a little for everybody.\nA word, \"supposedly,\" appears in the previous paragraph because it would never pass a lie detector test. Let's face it, the playoff was set up to give a small group power and a bigger group money, because nothing much happens in college sports that does not really involve power and money.\nThe five major conferences brought six bowls into their playoff orbit and only under pressure allowed one of the dozen spots to go to a school not a member of their cartel. But they certainly did not want one of the outliers getting super rich on the playoff, which is why they limited the playoff field to four teams and put the rest into a so-called \"Group of 6\" bowl lineup which they controlled - and, of course, sold for a huge sum to television.\nOne interesting sidelight is that the people who run this sham championship arrangement, try as they might, could not fool everybody. You'd think, ordinarily, the championship game of the richest conference would be a huge magnet for fans, but since the fans realized it had so little to do with the national championship they smelled it for what it is.\nOn Stubhub earlier in the week, there were more than 15,000 tickets available for the Penn State-Wisconsin matchup. As late as Saturday morning, more than 5,000 were still available, with sideline seats going for as little as, get this, $9.71.\nYou can be sure that would not have been the case were the winner assured of going on to play for a bigger prize, but as it was, even Penn State and Wisconsin fans kept their wallets in their pockets because, since the meaning of the game was diminished, they'd prefer to save for, say, a trip to Pasadena instead of Indianapolis.\nGoing into the game, the coaches, of course, tried to downplay the bigger picture by simply talking about the import of a conference championship -- \"huge,\" said Penn State's James Franklin -- and deferring any questions about the playoff possibilities.\nBut it didn't take a deep reading of Franklin's comments to know how he felt.\n\"You could make a really good argument that the Big Ten, specifically the Big Ten East, may be the best conference in all of college football right now,\" Franklin said.\nHe is probably right. The Big Ten is probably the best conference in college football right now, just a couple years after people were writing obituaries about the league's weakness. It's just not a good enough conference, apparently, to allow its champion to play for the national title.\n--Ira Miller is an award-winning sportswriter who has covered the National Football League for more than five decades and is a member of the Pro Football Hall of Fame Selection Committee.

      "text": "Published December 03, 2016 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 Email Print TV : CBS\nTime : Sunday, 1 p.m.\nMiami Dolphins quarterback Ryan Tannehill has avoided costly mistakes during his team's six-game winning streak.\nMore from FoxSports Philip Rivers on Antonio Gates' career and the touchdown record Could Rob Gronkowski be out in New England? | SPEAK FOR YOURSELF Recent Chargers relocation story is just opinions stirring the pot Should Chargers fans be worried about the latest relocation news? Tannehill likely will need to maintain that level of play Sunday against a stout Baltimore Ravens' defense if Miami is to exit with a victory.\nTannehill has made several key adjustments under first-year head coach Adam Gase, who has helped his quarterback develop better footwork in the pocket. Tannehill has responded with his best year as a pro. He has thrown for nine touchdowns and one interception with a passer rating of 104.7 over the past six games.\nThe Ravens, however, pose the biggest challenge so far with the league's second-ranked defense. Still, Tannehill's confidence is riding high and he is poised to make some key plays in this tough road matchup.\n\"It is exciting to be where we're at right now,\" Tannehill said. \"Obviously you want to be playing meaningful games in December to get yourself playing in January and February, and we've done that. I'm not surprised because we just kind of stuck to the process. We believed in each other and just kept growing as a football team.\"\nTannehill may have to make some more big plays, especially if the Dolphins cannot effectively run the ball. Baltimore has the league's top rushing defense, allowing 74.9 yards per game.\nLast week, the San Francisco 49ers stacked the box to shut down Miami's running attack, and Tannehill responded with three touchdown passes. Ravens head coach John Harbaugh has been impressed by Tannehill's performance and is preparing for a versatile offense.\n\"Tannehill has done a great job all year,\" Harbaugh said. \"Obviously, he has not made a lot of mistakes since they have started winning - more touchdown passes with fewer interceptions. They have run the ball. They have three really good receivers and a great running back. It is a good combination of players.\"\nThe Dolphins have won each of their past five games by seven points or fewer. They could be faced with another closely contested matchup at M&T Bank Stadium.\nBaltimore is 32-15 at home during the month of December. Since 2008, the Ravens have allowed just 16.4 points per game at M&T Bank Stadium -- the NFL's best defensive mark.\nWhile the Dolphins lead the all-time series 6-5, the Ravens have won four of the past five regular-season meetings. Baltimore has also beaten Miami twice in the postseason in the wild-card round (2002 and 2009).\nRavens linebacker Terrell Suggs has been the dominant player with 9.5 sacks in seven games.\nBaltimore's defense got a boost with the return of fellow linebacker Elvis Dumervil from a foot injury. Dumervil secured the Ravens' 19-14 victory over the Cincinnati Bengals with a strip-sack on quarterback Andy Dalton with just over a minute to play.\nRavens top cornerback Jimmy Smith also returned to practice this week after missing the past two games. This could help Baltimore contain the Dolphins' talented pair of receivers Jarvis Landry and DeVante Parker.\n\"I think any time you play a defense that has the players that they have and then the coaching staff that they have - it's a very good coaching staff to where those guys will be in great position,\" said Gase, who interviewed for the Ravens' offensive coordinator position in 2015. \"They'll obviously be dialed in to our scheme.\"\nThe onus could be on Miami running back Jay Ajayi to relieve some of that pressure on the offense. Ajayi is ranked seventh in the NFL with 847 yards on 161 carries. However, he has been held to under 80 yards in the past three games.\nThe Dolphins got some good news this week as injured offensive lineman Branden Albert (wrist) and Laremy Tunsil (shoulder) were able to return to practice.\n\"We still have a lot of room to grow,\" Ajayi said. \"It's comforting because if we can figure those little things out and hone in on those details now at this time and really get rolling, then December is going to be huge for us.\"\nThe Ravens need more production from quarterback Joe Flacco and the rest of the offense. Flacco has thrown for 2,877 yards with 11 touchdowns and six interceptions in 11 games. He is expected to face some pressure this week from Dolphins defensive tackle Ndamukong Suh, who has five sacks.\nBaltimore is averaging 19.8 points per game -- tied with Minnesota for 24th in the league. In the victory over the Bengals, the Ravens had to rely on four field goals from Justin Tucker -- three of those kicks were over 50 yards.\n\"We need to score more points as an offense,\" Harbaugh said. \"That's the bottom line. We just have to continue to find a way to do that. I believe we can do it. I know we can do it. Making plays here and there, blocking a little bit better, seeing some reads, calling some plays, building a good game plan, those are all things that you try to do.\"\nIt will also be the first time Ravens receiver Mike Wallace plays against the Dolphins since he left there in 2014 after two tumultuous seasons. Wallace said he has no bad feelings toward Miami, but he would like nothing more than to have a big game against them as a Raven.\n\"I'm happy for those guys,\" Wallace said Wednesday about Miami. \"No ill feelings. But I feel like I've been taken on this path for a reason. The way the (Ravens) organization is run is more my speed here.\"",

      "title": "Denver Broncos at Jacksonville Jaguars game preview",
      "text": "Published December 03, 2016 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 Email Print TV : CBS\nTime : Sunday, 1 p.m.\nJACKSONVILLE, Fla. -- During a season full of disappointment, the Jacksonville Jaguars' patchwork offensive line has actually been mostly steady.\nMore from FoxSports Philip Rivers on Antonio Gates' career and the touchdown record Could Rob Gronkowski be out in New England? | SPEAK FOR YOURSELF Recent Chargers relocation story is just opinions stirring the pot Should Chargers fans be worried about the latest relocation news? That unit is about to collide with its biggest challenge of the season when the Denver Broncos come to town.\nAgain relying on a ferocious pass rush to boost one of the league's top defenses, the Broncos will be looking to keep a frustrating season going for the Jaguars as they try to keep pace in a heated AFC playoff race on Sunday at EverBank Field.\n\"They are obviously one of the best, if not the best, and rightfully so,\" Jaguars quarterback Blake Bortles said of Denver's defense. \"At every position, they are extremely talented and they do a good job.\"\nThe Super Bowl champion Broncos (7-4) will have to fight to return to the postseason while playing in a resurgent AFC West. Denver is currently two games behind the division-leading Oakland Raiders and a game back of the Kansas City Chiefs with five games to play, and it is dealing with an injury to quarterback Trevor Siemian.\nSiemian missed another practice Friday because of his left foot injury and was ruled out for Sunday's game.\nFirst-round rookie quarterback Paxton Lynch will start after Broncos head coach Gary Kubiak made the switch official following Friday's practice.\nLynch gets his second start of the season in place of Siemian, who sustained the foot injury in the first possession of overtime in last Sunday night's 30-27 overtime loss to the Kansas City Chiefs.\nThe 24-year-old Siemian finished the game but experienced pain in his foot the next morning. He was placed in a walking boot Tuesday and did not practice all week. Siemian threw for a career-high 368 yards and three touchdowns against the Chiefs.\nThe Jaguars (2-9), losers of six straight games, have already clinched their ninth consecutive season without a winning record and won't be headed to the playoffs without some sort of miracle.\nInstead, they will mostly spend the last chunk of the season building for the future.\n\"We just want to finish and win games here,\" defensive end Tyson Alualu said. \"You've heard it all year about how we have the talent and the guys to be contenders in this league. For us to have the season that we're having, at 2-9, it is frustrating. You have to go out there and continue to do your job the best you know how.\"\nThat's the message preached by Jaguars head coach Gus Bradley, particularly to the offensive line this week.\nDenver is first in the league in pass defense and fourth in total defense, largely because of a pass rush that hounds opposing quarterbacks.\nIt starts with outside linebacker Von Miller, who has a league-leading 12.5 sacks, and extends throughout a unit that has gotten to opposing quarterbacks 35 times -- more than any other team this season.\nJacksonville has done a solid job protecting Bortles. He has been sacked just 23 times while being among the league leaders in pass attempts despite losing left guard Luke Joeckel for the season in October and having to shuffle players at several spots along the offensive line at different points.\nBut they haven't faced a group as talented as that of the Broncos, who boast Miller and linebackers DeMarcus Ware and Shane Ray as part of a fearsome unit.\n\"He's special,\" Kubiak said of Miller. \"He's obviously a great player, and he's become a leader on the football team. Von has played very consistent level for us this year, playing at a Pro-Bowl level.\"\nMiller said, \"We are just sitting here trying to get wins. Whatever it takes to get those, we are going to do it.\"\nWhile the Broncos are busy planning to get after Bortles, Jaguars defensive coordinator Todd Wash is doing the same to harass the inexperienced Lynch.\nFor the Jaguars, that starts with rookie defensive end Yannick Ngakoue, who leads the team with six sacks, and former Broncos standout Malik Jackson, who has 4.5.\nThe Jaguars are also dealing with several injuries, notably running back Chris Ivory, who was ruled out against Denver after leaving during the first quarter of a loss to the Buffalo Bills last week with a hamstring injury.\nJacksonville wide receiver Allen Hurns (hamstring), wide receiver/punt returner Rashad Greene (Achilles) and defensive end Jared Odrick (shoulder) have also been ruled out. Tight end Julius Thomas (back) is officially listed as doubtful and will likely miss his second straight game.\nMeanwhile, the Jaguars will search for any way to limit a talented Broncos pass rush -- and get their first win of the season in Jacksonville.\n\"We are excited to get a chance to come back after two away games to come play at home,\" Bortles said. \"We feel as though, offensively, there are some good things going on, so we would like to continue that and bring it here and hopefully win at home in front of our crowd.\"",

      "text": "Tweet \nPresident-elect Donald Trump took to Twitter early Sunday to offer strong criticism of American companies that outsource jobs, while saying that as long as he is president, there will be big penalties for them if they sell their outsources products back in the U.S. \n“[E]xpensive mistake!” Trump wrote in the sixth tweet of his rapid-fire tweet storm. “THE UNITED STATES IS OPEN FOR BUSINESS.” The U.S. is going to substantialy reduce taxes and regulations on businesses, but any business that leaves our country for another country, \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 4, 2016 fires its employees, builds a new factory or plant in the other country, and then thinks it will sell its product back into the U.S. …… \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 4, 2016 without retribution or consequence, is WRONG! There will be a tax on our soon to be strong border of 35% for these companies …… \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 4, 2016 wanting to sell their product, cars, A.C. units etc., back across the border. This tax will make leaving financially difficult, but….. \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 4, 2016 these companies are able to move between all 50 states, with no tax or tariff being charged. Please be forewarned prior to making a very … \nMore from Politico : \nA central theme of Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign had been bringing back jobs that had been outsourced to other countries over the years. \nThat point was something he emphasized last week with a deal that was to retain some jobs at Carrier, a division of United Technologies that manufactures air conditioners in Indiana, rather than having those jobs exported to Mexico. That deal has come under some criticism, even by the likes of Sarah Palin, for rewarding an individual company for what amounted to economic blackmail. \nMany conservatives and free-market thinkers alike are likely to have problems with Trump’s proposed 35 percent tax. Palin labeled Trump’s market tinkering “crony capitalism,” and it appears that “cronyism” — the government’s meddling in what is suppose to be a market largely free from government intervention — will continue. \nInstead of threatening companies with a hefty tax, many conservative thinkers instead believe that Trump’s administration should make the business environment more favorable and conducive for businesses — something the Obama administration never tried to do.

Trump (@ realDonaldTrump ) \nThe SNL skit starts by pointing out something that actually happened last week - Trump retweeting \n\" @ FiIibuster : @ jeffzeleny \n— Donald J. Trump (@ realDonaldTrump ) \n\"God, Seth seems so cool,\" Baldwin’s Trump said after retweeting \nKate McKinnon , once again playing GOP campaign manager Kellyanne Conway, explained the strategy behind Trump’ \n“He does it to distract the media from his business conflicts and the scary people in his cabinet,” McKinnon’s Conway said, only to be corrected by Baldwin’ \n“Actually, that’s not why I do it. I do it because my brain is bad,” Baldwin’ \nThe ‘SNL’ skit highlights Trump’s apparently lack of interest in intelligence briefings, even as two aides (played by cast members Kenan Thompson and Alex Moffat ) plead, \"Mr. Trump, please stop retweeting \n\"That's not true. I was elected 25 days ago and already unemployment is at a 9-year low, millions and millions of people have health care, and Osama Bin Laden is dead,” Baldwin’ \nAs a Reuters story explained earlier this week, only one member of Trump’s transition team, Geoffrey Kahn , is dealing with the CIA and 16 other offices that represent the country’ \n\"It seems like an odd time to put issues like cyber security and international terrorism on the back burner,\" said one senior career intelligence officer, who said briefing books are “waiting for someone to read them. \nThe 'SNL' skit goes on to mock two more real Trump retweets , one from “Siberian Husky Lover” @JoeBowman12 and another from @ sdcritic , who said “liberalism is a mental illness” \n\" @JoeBowman12 : @ jeffzeleny just another generic CNN part time wannabe journalist !\" @CNN \n— Donald J. Trump (@ realDonaldTrump ) \n\"@ sdcritic : @ @ @CNN There is NO QUESTION THAT # voterfraud did take place, and in favor of # CorruptHillary \n— Donald J. Trump (@ realDonaldTrump ) \nOf course, this isn’t the first time Trump has taken to Twitter to criticize how SNL has portrayed him. While still on the campaign trail, Trump called the show “boring and unfunny” and claimed it was part of a media conspiracy that was “rigging” the election for Clinton. \nThen in November, Trump once again blasted the show as “totally once-sided” and “biased,” and complained about the lack of “equal time” \nLast night, Baldwin jumped on Twitter to respond to Trump’ \nRelease your tax returns and I'll stop.",

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 4, 2016 expensive mistake! THE UNITED STATES IS OPEN FOR BUSINESS \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 4, 2016 \nThere’s one glaring obvious problem – it is unconstitutional to target a specific company with different laws, i.e., tariffs, because they did something the President didn’t like. But they can’t slam an entire industry with a tariff to punish one company moving jobs overseas. So will they go the way of FDR when he hit this problem? \nClearly, nobody gives a crap that the government is now telling companies what to do and calling it free market economics. Because controlling the means of production is only socialist when Democrats do it, duh!! \nMike Pence also reinforced this morning that they don’t care if this is crony capitalism, they’re going to do it anyway. More and more Trump just sounds like our FDR – he even used the “forgotten man” narrative from Amity Shlaes’ excellent book about Coolidge and FDR. But the point is that he’s not guided by any conservative principle or ideology – he’s just gonna use his personal whim and the power of the federal government to try to make the economy do what he wants. I would say that he’ll be as successful as FDR was, but the federal government is VASTLY more powerful now than it was back then…",

      "text": "Published December 04, 2016 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 Email Print OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) Derek Carr threw for 260 yards and two touchdowns to rally the Oakland Raiders to their biggest comeback in 16 years with a 38-24 victory over the Buffalo Bills on Sunday.\nAfter falling behind 24-9 following touchdowns on the first two drives of the second half for Buffalo (6-6), the Raiders (10-2) took the game over with 29 straight points and won their sixth straight to remain one game ahead of Kansas City in the tough AFC West.\nOakland scored touchdowns on three straight drives, including scoring strikes from Carr to Michael Crabtree and Amari Cooper for his sixth fourth-quarter comeback of the season. This was the biggest comeback for the Raiders since overcoming a 21-point deficit to Indianapolis to win 38-31 on Sept. 10, 2000.\nMore from FoxSports Fantasy Football: give Mike Gillislee a waiver wire look Larry Fitzgerald passes Marvin Harrison for 3rd on NFL's all-time receptions list Julian Edelman sums up Tom Brady's record-setting NFL win vs. Los Angeles Ben Roethlisberger speaks after Steelers Week 13 win vs. New York Giants The defense also tightened by forcing three straight three-and-outs and then getting a turnover when Khalil Mack deflected Tyrod Taylor's pass that Nate Allen intercepted . Oakland took over at the 16 and put the game away with Latavius Murray's second touchdown run of the game to make it 38-24 on Carr's 2-point conversion pass to Seth Roberts.\nThe loss was crushing for the Bills, who entered December with hopes of ending the league's longest playoff drought. A big day by LeSean McCoy, who had 130 yards rushing, helped stake Buffalo to the big lead, but it wasn't enough.\nThe Bills are two games behind Denver for the second wild-card spot in the AFC and could be headed to a 17th straight season without a playoff berth.\nRARE TURNOVER: The Bills have been on a record pace protecting the ball, but had a bad time for a rare turnover. After taking over at their own 4 midway through the fourth quarter trailing by six, Taylor was hit by Mack on the first play, leading to just the seventh turnover of the season for Buffalo. Mack then sealed the game with a sack and fumble recovery with Buffalo driving late.\nCARR'S FINGER: A week after injuring the pinkie on his throwing hand and missing a series, Carr was able to play without a glove on his right hand. But the injury still hampered Carr to a degree as he took no snaps under center to protect the injury, even in short-yardage situations.\nENCORE PERFORMANCE: A week after scoring on a 75-yard run against Jacksonville on the first play from scrimmage of the second half, McCoy struck big again to open the third quarter. He ran 54 yards on the first play and Taylor followed with a 12-yard keeper on the next play to put Buffalo up 17-9.\nFAST START: The Bills gained a season-high 147 yards in the first quarter and scored on their first two drives with a field goal by Dan Carpenter and Mike Gillislee's 1-yard run early in the second. Buffalo ran just once on nine plays on the opening drive and then ran on nine of 11 plays the next drive.\nFAST FINISH: The Raiders took over with 30 seconds left in the first half at their own 15 and managed to get points. Carr completed four straight passes for 57 yards to set up Sebastian Janikowski's 47-yard field goal that cut Buffalo's lead to 10-9 at the half. The last time a team started a drive shy of its own 20 with 30 seconds or fewer remaining in the first half and scored came in 2005 when San Francisco did it for a field goal against Jacksonville, according to Pro Football Reference .\n---\nFor more NFL coverage: http://www.pro32.ap.org and http://www.twitter.com/AP-NFL",

The 49ers defeated the Giants 16-10. (Photo by Jim McIsaac/Getty Images) \nThe New York Giants' six-game win streak came to an end Sunday after they lost the Pittsburgh Steelers 24-14, and though Odell Beckham Jr. didn't blame the refs for the loss, he was critical of the officiating.\nAfter his 10-catch, 100-yard receiving performance, Beckham told reporters that he doesn't think Terry McAulay's officiating crew should be assigned to Giants games going forward.\nBeckham claimed that one of the officiates said \"get out of my face\" when the Pro Bowl wideout was flagged for offensive pass interference.\nMore from FoxSports Fantasy Football: give Mike Gillislee a waiver wire look Larry Fitzgerald passes Marvin Harrison for 3rd on NFL's all-time receptions list Julian Edelman sums up Tom Brady's record-setting NFL win vs. Los Angeles Ben Roethlisberger speaks after Steelers Week 13 win vs. New York Giants New York has no time to dwell on this loss.

      "text": "Published December 04, 2016 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 Email Print NEW ORLEANS (AP) Detroit safety Glover Quin recognized a deep route by Brandin Cooks just in time to make a diving breakup of a long pass down the middle of the field.\nA few plays later, Quin intercepted Brees along the sideline.\n''Obviously Drew Brees is a great player with great talent around him; we knew it was going to be a challenge, so we locked in - all week,'' Quin said.\nMore from FoxSports Fantasy Football: give Mike Gillislee a waiver wire look Larry Fitzgerald passes Marvin Harrison for 3rd on NFL's all-time receptions list Julian Edelman sums up Tom Brady's record-setting NFL win vs. Los Angeles Ben Roethlisberger speaks after Steelers Week 13 win vs. New York Giants That much was evident in the Lions' 28-13 victory over the Saints on Sunday in the Superdome, where Brees had a touchdown pass in 60 straight home games before Detroit derailed that streak.\nIf there was ever an outing that could embolden a defense as the stakes rise for the NFC North Division-leading Lions (8-4) late in the season, that was it.\nAfter all, the Saints (5-7) had scored seven TDs in the Superdome one week earlier in a blowout victory over the Los Angeles Rams.\nThis week, the Lions intercepted Brees three times - once each by Quin , Tavon Wilson and Miles Killebrew .\n''We just did what we do. That's what great defenses do,'' Quin said. ''They put up 49 points in this building last week, so for us to come in here and not allow (Brees) to throw a touchdown, to get three turnovers, to hold them to 13 points, 50 yards rushing ... against an offense like this, I think it was a good performance.''\nWhile Brees finished with 326 yards passing, he had only had 94 yards at halftime and didn't get his last 75 yards until New Orleans' final drive, when Detroit led by 15 and was giving up underneath routes in an effort to reduce the chances of a quick strike.\nThe more productive quarterback on the day was Detroit's Matthew Stafford, who completed 31 of 44 passes for 341 yards, two touchdowns and did not turn the ball over.\nHis only regret was that Detroit failed to score touchdowns on four trips inside the New Orleans 20. This time, though, the Lions didn't need those points.\n''Our defense, giving up 13 to that group, is pretty incredible,'' Stafford said.\nDetroit's suffocating defense emerged as one key story line from the Lions victory in New Orleans. Here are some others:\nSLOPPY SAINTS\nThe Saints regretted several chances to make game-changing plays which slipped through their fingers. Cornerback Sterling Moore dropped what had the makings of a certain interception of a tipped pass with the potential for a long return.\nTight Coby Fleener had a pass bounce off his hands at the goal line. Cameron Jordan made a strong play to bat one of Stafford's passes into the air in the fourth quarter when the Saints trailed by six, but he couldn't pick up the ball in time to catch it before it dropped right next to him. Brees also failed to handle a shotgun snap on third-and-1.\nSaints coach Sean Payton said his team looked, ''sluggish, like we came off a short week or something.''\nGOLDEN TOUCH\nStafford connected with Golden Tate eight times for 145 yards , and the pair was particularly in synch on a third-and-10 play early in the fourth quarter.\nWith the Superdome crowd roaring in hopes of disrupting the Lions' communication at the line of scrimmage, Stafford recognized safety Kenny Vaccaro's impending blitz, checked into a different play and rifled a pass to a wide-open Tate for a 66-yard TD pass that gave the Lions a 25-13 lead.\nPLAYOFF PICTURE\nWhile the Lions consolidated their perch atop their division with a seventh victory in eight games, the Saints slid closer to the brink of elimination. New Orleans was only fortunate that NFC South leader Atlanta lost, as did the Redskins, who entered the day holding the last wild-card slot. The results left the Saints two games out of a playoff spot with four games left.\n''It's nice to have something that we're still playing for,'' Saints right tackle Zach Strief said. ''We're not out. We're not done, and yet, if you thought your back was against the wall before, look now.''\nDetroit is trying to win its first division crown since 1993, when it played in the NFC Central. The Lions have a two-game lead over second-place Minnesota and Green Bay.\nKEEPING IT CLEAN\nWith his latest game without a turnover, Stafford has thrown just one interception in his past eight games.\nAs he has done regularly this season, Stafford mixes in a few timely scrambles rather than force throws. He rushed three times for 22 yards, including an 11-yard run for a first down, giving him 30 rushes for a career-high 178 yards, an average of 5.9 yards per carry.\n---\nFor more NFL coverage: http://www.pro32.ap.org and http://www.twitter.com/AP-NFL",

      "text": "Trump calls out China on Twitter after breaking protocol with Taiwan call Share this on | @ascorrespondent \nU.S. President-elect Donald Trump. Pic: Reuters/Mark Kauzlarich. \nAFTER irking China and sparking a media frenzy with his historic call with Taiwan last Friday, U.S. President-elect Donald Trump had yet another go at the rising Asian powerhouse two days later, this time critiquing the country’s economic and military policy on Twitter. \nIn two back-to-back postings, Trump, who is just weeks away from becoming one of the most powerful leaders in the world, accused Beijing of manipulating currency, unfairly taxing U.S. products and taking military control of the South China Sea. \n“Did China ask us if it was OK to devalue their currency (making it hard for our companies to compete), heavily tax our products going into their country (the U.S. doesn’t tax them) or to build a massive military complex in the middle of the South China Sea? I don’t think so!” he wrote on the social media platform, after a Twitter-heavy weekend. Did China ask us if it was OK to devalue their currency (making it hard for our companies to compete), heavily tax our products going into.. \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 4, 2016 their country (the U.S. doesn't tax them) or to build a massive military complex in the middle of the South China Sea? I don't think so! \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 4, 2016 \nThe rant suggests Trump was thumbing his nose at China, ignoring the diplomatic protest note lodged by Beijing on Saturday over his phone call with Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen. \nThe congratulatory call made by Tsai signaled a break in decades of protocol, and was the first such contact made by a U.S. president-elect or president with Taiwan since President Jimmy Carter switched diplomatic recognition in 1979 to acknowledge Taiwan as part of “one China”. \nSEE ALSO: Donald Trump speaks to Taiwan’s leader in move that could anger China \nAccording to CNBC , China’s Foreign Minister said it lodged “stern representations” with the “relevant U.S. side” over the call, urging for careful handling of the Taiwan issue. \nIt was not clear who in the “U.S. side” the protest note reached but Beijing appeared to blame Taiwan for the exchange and not Trump. Some media reports also suggested that the call was a mere oversight on the part of Trump, who is a real estate mogul and billionaire businessman, but a novice in foreign policy. \nTrump’s transition team tried to contain the backlash or at least downplay its significance, with vice-president-elect Mike Pence saying Sunday that the row was just a “tempest in a teapot”, according to the South China Morning Post . \nPence, who was speaking on ABC’s This Week , pointed out that the call was placed to Trump by Taiwan’s Tsai, who had wanted to congratulate the U.S. leader on his Nov 8 presidential victory. \n“They reached out to offer congratulations as leaders around the world have and he took the call, accepted her congratulations and good wishes and it was precisely that.” \nPence’s remarks appeared to suggest that there was nothing more to Trump’s exchange with Tsai than a mere congratulatory call. It was also not the first time the U.S. president-elect has raised eyebrows since winning the presidential polls last month. \nAmong others, Trump has made headlines for calling Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif a “terrific guy” and offering to help solve the country’s problems; meeting with Philippine Rodrigo Duterte who said Trump showed he understood his deadly crackdown on drug dealers; and was also hailed a “clever man” by Russian President Vladimir Putin, who has been locking horns with President Barack Obama over Russia’s actions in Ukraine and Syria. \nSEE ALSO: Duterte congratulates Trump, expresses wish to bolster US-Philippines ties \nHowever, with Trump’s Twitter outburst against China coming right after Pence’s explanation, observers and Trump detractors have been loath to agree that the Taiwan call was just a diplomatic slip-up and not an indication of an impending shift in U.S. policy on China. \nTrump’s actions are also clearly in line with his plan to label China a currency manipulator on his first day in office, a promise that forms part of the real estate magnate’s larger bid to overhaul the nation’s trade policy. \nFurthermore, reports citing interviews with those behind the planning of that call with Taiwan indicate that the exchange was an intentionally provocative move. \nAccording to Washington Post , people involved in or briefed on the talks said the call was the product of “months of quiet preparation and deliberations among Trump’s advisers about a new strategy for engagement with Taiwan that began even before he became the Republican presidential nominee”. \nOn Reuters , Tsai’s spokesman Alex Huang appeared to confirm this when he said: “Of course both sides agreed ahead of time before making contact.” Huang also told CNN something similar, that both sides agreed ahead of time before making contact. \nOn Saturday during the storm over Trump’s call with Taiwan, Chris Murphy, a member of the Senate Foreign Relations committee blasted the U.S. president-elect over Twitter. \nHe acknowledged that it would soon be Trump’s right to shift policy, alliances and strategy but stressed, “What has happened in the last 48 hours is not a shift. These are major pivots in foreign policy w/out any plan.

      "text": "Published December 5, 2016 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre 0 Email Print \n \nTHE WALL STREET JOURNAL -   Americans had to get used to Donald Trump breaking all the rules of presidential campaigning, and it looks like the world will have to adjust to a President Trump who will also violate diplomatic convention. One early lesson is not to overreact to every break with State Department protocol as if it’s the start of World War III.\nThe U.S. media had their 19th nervous breakdown Friday after the Trump transition said the President-elect had taken a congratulatory call from Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen. Mr. Trump also later tweeted that he had spoken to “the President of Taiwan.” Doesn’t he understand this simply isn’t done? No American President or President-elect has talked to a Taiwanese President since 1979, and this violation of tradition is being portrayed as a careless, bone-headed provocation to Beijing.\nWell, maybe it was calculated—and perhaps even useful. Trump Asia adviser Peter Navarro has advocated cabinet-level visits to Taiwan and an end to the U.S. bow to Beijing’s “one China” policy, which insists that Taiwan is part of China and shouldn’t be treated as an independent state. Perhaps that goes too far, but it is past time for the U.S. to recalibrate its Taiwan policy.\nNed Price, spokesman at the Obama National Security Council, suggested that Mr. Trump made a mistake, saying the U.S. remains “firmly committed to our ‘one China’ policy based on the three Joint Communiqués and the Taiwan Relations Act.” But the communiqués from the 1970s and ’80s do not say that the U.S. supports Beijing’s view of “one China,” only that the U.S. acknowledges that both China and Taiwan agree on that principle. That is a crucial distinction.\nTaiwan and the world have also changed since those communiqués. Taiwan has become a prosperous and democratic polity integrated into the world economy. Most Taiwanese now want to maintain their de facto independence. They resent Beijing’s bullying to force their leaders to move toward reunification.\nPrevious U.S. Presidents have eased restrictions on contact with Taiwanese officials to reflect this reality. Bill Clinton let President Lee Teng-hui give a speech at Cornell University in 1995. George W. Bush allowed President Chen Shui-bian to visit the U.S. in transit to countries in Latin America that maintain diplomatic relations with Taiwan.\nThe U.S. is obligated to assist the self-governing territory in defending itself under the 1979 Taiwan Relations Act, and every Administration since has sold weapons to Taiwan. Mr. Clinton sent a U.S. carrier through the Taiwan Strait in 1996 when China was especially threatening.\nRead the full story at The Wall Street Journal→",

      "text": "Published December 5, 2016 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre 0 Email Print \n \nBy Bryan Dean Wright \nPublished December 05, 2016 | FoxNews.com \nDuring a shouting matching Thursday night between top aides of Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton, the President-elect’s campaign manager Kellyanne Conway summed up a key reason for why my Democratic Party lost – and will likely continue to lose. “There’s a difference for voters between what offends you and what affects you.”  \nTo understand what she meant, look to the recent developments in Indiana. Millions of voters in the Rust Belt are in awe as 1,100 of their fellow blue-collar workers at Carrier narrowly missed being laid off. Instead of training Mexican replacements, these Hoosiers are celebrating an American paycheck.\nIn normal times, my fellow Democrats would have celebrated this modest victory in the fight against globalization. They might have even applauded the president-elect for helping make it happen.\nBut these are not normal times.\nMedia reaction captures how tone deaf we have become. My party is advancing stories of outrage over the generous tax incentives that Carrier received – some $7.0 million at present.\nWe’re hearing disbelief that companies can now blackmail Trump into getting their own sweetheart tax deals. Even trade critics like Bernie Sanders are complaining that Trump didn’t save enough jobs from being shipped overseas.\nWhile there’s merit to these concerns, Ms. Conway knows that however offended some people may be, there are far more who are affected by the outcome.\nFrom now until Christmas, we will see narratives of hard working Americans emotionally recalling how much they feared joblessness and bankruptcy once Carrier shut off the lights. They will tell us of the Christmas that almost was, complete with heartbroken children with no presents under the tree.\nBut now? There will be presents aplenty. And they will have President-elect Trump to thank for it.\nRead the full story in the Opinion Section on FoxNews.com→",

      "text": "​Microsoft, Google, Facebook, and Twitter signed a so-called code of conduct in May that would have them tackle the issue of hate speech in a more efficient way, but their reaction has so far been below expectations, the European Commission said. As a result, the EU is calling for all companies to combat hate speech and content promoting violence and terrorism faster and more efficiently, or otherwise be forced to do it with laws that would regulate how tech firms must act in such cases. “In practice the companies take longer and do not yet achieve this goal. They only reviewed 40% of the recorded cases in less than 24 hours. After 48 hours the figure is more than 80%.

If you would allow that, then that is what I would like to do.\"\nDeath penalty cases are split into two parts: the guilt phase, and then a separate portion that focuses on whether or not the defendant will be sentenced to death or life in prison.\nRelated News... Can Dylann Roof provide a competent defense for himself?",

And even though it may feel like yesterday, most of us have joined Twitter years ago.\nHow often do you look back? Do you know if it’s even possible?\nToday’s round up has three tools allowing you to go back in time and access your personal Twitter archives.\nTweetStory Do you like “On this day” feature? With how social media platforms have been developing, you’d guess Twitter would add something like that too soon! While we are waiting, there’s already an app for that.\nTweetStory is an iPhone app that shows you what you tweeted on this specific day in previous years. For someone who tweets A LOT, this app has been a huge discovery!\n\nTweetStory focuses on this aspect by offering you the possibility to see your tweets on current day but from 2007 and until last year.\nThe app also has push notifications in case you don’t want to miss a thing!\nSnapbird Snapbird is a handy tool that lets you search your personal Twitter archives. I still cannot quite understand why Twitter doesn’t have this feature built in, but it makes perfect sense to me.\nYou can search your own tweets and DMs. You can also choose to search your friends’ tweets to in case you are in need of quotes for your article or presentations.\nI use the tool often because I tweet plenty of URLs and that’s the only way to find those URLs to reference in my future articles.\nNaturally, you need to authenticate Snapbird using your Twitter credentials to give it access to your archives.\n\nSearch:\nAny user’s timeline (including yourself) Any user’s favorites (including yours) Your friends’ tweets Tweets mentioning you Your sent and received direct messages \nFirst Tweet The simplest tool on our list, this one does only one thing: Shows your very first Tweet. All you need to do is to sign in .\n\nAnd what was your first tweet? Do share! Where did it all get started?\nThe post 3 Tools Access and Search Your Personal Twitter Archives appeared first on Internet Marketing Ninjas Blog .\n",

      "text": "Twitter is the new social media darling for travelers, solving problems and saving money Terry Gardner \nWhen I’m in a travel bind, whether it’s before a trip or at the airport, I often use Twitter to contact the airlines. That social media outlet can lead to better service and sometimes even savings. \nAnthony Berklich, founder of the travel platform Inspired Citizen , has used Twitter for his travel conundrums too, often using direct message (more on that below). \nHis most extreme example: The cab that was taking him to the airport got into an accident. He tweeted what happened to American Airlines (@AmericanAir), the carrier he was to be flying. \nAmerican, he said, replied within 10 minutes and asked for a picture of the cab. Berklich sent back a photo, and American rebooked him on a later flight with no penalty. \nOn another trip, Berklich realized weather would delay his flight home from Rome. He tweeted to Delta (@Delta) about the weather issue and suggested a flight from Milan instead. Delta rebooked him at no extra charge. \nWhen you contact an airline using its public Twitter channel, most airlines will follow you back on Twitter and ask you to follow them back so you can direct message, or DM. \nYes, it takes whiners off the public channel (and protects the airline’s brand), but it also protects your personal information. \nUnlike regular Twitter messages, a DM isn’t limited to 140 characters. Instead, you have up to 10,000 characters to describe a travel problem. \nTaking things a step beyond, Delta has added a button on its Twitter page to make sending a direct message easier: You don’t have to follow each other to send a DM. \nMost major U.S. carriers monitor social media 24 hours a day every day, which helps if you need assistance in the middle of the night. \nIf problem resolution doesn’t entice you onto Twitter, deals may. \nBerklich follows airlines for deals and also looks to Scott Keyes (@smkeyes) of Scott’s Cheap Flights for deals and steals. Thanks to Keyes, Berklich found a round trip from Miami to Brazil for $75 and a nonstop round trip from New York to Belgrade, Serbia, for $164. \n“Sometimes it’s a mistake or [sometimes it’s] certain dates,” Berklich said. \nKeyes got started after he stumbled on a great airfare. “In 2013, I got the best deal I've ever bought in my life: New York City to Milan, direct, for $130 round trip,” he said in an email. “When I got back … friends asked me if I could let them know next time an incredible deal like that popped up.” \nThe $130 NYC-Milan deal was a mistake fare on United. Those erroneous fares — an airline sells seats at a price it didn't intend to —“pop up every once in a while,” he said. “Some stick around for a day or two; others are gone in a half-hour.” \nHow does he do it? “No real secret sauce per se to finding mistake fares, mostly just keeping your ear to the ground, monitoring Twitter and message boards and constantly searching different routes.” \nKeyes also maintains email lists, which include 13,000 premium subscribers and 117,000 free subscribers. \nThe free subscribers see only about one-third of the deals he emails to the premium subscribers, and those are the deals Keyes tweets. \nIf you don’t want to pay for a premium subscription, try following Keyes on Twitter. \nJohn DiScala, founder of travel site JohnnyJet.com , and Brett Snyder, the Cranky Concierge , use Twitter for quick communication, of course, but they also follow deal tweeters. Among the Twitter feeds worth following are: @JetBlueCheeps (a favorite of DiScala’s), @airfarewatchdog, @TheFlightDeal, @Hopper_Deals and @ExitFares. \nAdding these to your follows on Twitter just could subtract from how much you pay for an airfare. \n\nCaption The edgy beauty of Arizona's Sonoran Desert \nBotanical wonders abound in the wild Sonoran Desert of Organ Pipe National Monument and Saguaro National Park.

(Fox 29) \n“Once you see the breath, when you wake up in the morning, you see your breath in the air when you're going to work, then the only thing on your mind is January 1st!”\nTom Kelhower and Tom Kee are counting down the days to the Mummers Parade. They're with the Riverfront Wench brigade, going for a record three wins in a row. But preparation this year? It's been different.\nPHILADELPHIA MAN ARRESTED AFTER PRO-TRUMP, RACIST GRAFFITI SPREE \n“That's one of the toughest decisions I think we have to make this year, is our makeup, I really do. So that we don't offend anybody,” Kelhower said.\nTheir theme is horse racing's Triple Crown, the costumes coming together. The starting gates already built.\nSTUDENT REMOVED FROM SCHOOL OVER FAKE RACIST HUNTING LICENSE \n“We're doing a jockey theme. It's been brought up to use mud. Jockeys get the mud on their face. You gotta use a brown. They're asking us not to use brown makeup because it will offend someone.”\nIt follows last year's controversy, after a different brigade wore brownface and another mocked Caitlyn Jenner.\nThis year, all brigades had to submit the details of their performances, many went through sensitivity training, and all are encouraged to watch a series on online videos.\n\"What's entertaining and fun for one group may not ever be considered entertainment or fun to another group.\"\nThe Chairman of Love the Mummers says-- it's not about censorship or stifling creativity. It is about understanding the line between satire and being just plain offensive.\nClick for more from Fox 29.",

      "text": "Published December 05, 2016 FoxNews.com Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print European Union flags flutter outside the EU Commission headquarters in Brussels, Belgium, April 20, 2016. (REUTERS/Francois Lenoir) \nThe European Commission has slammed tech titans Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and Microsoft, saying that they are not moving quickly enough to deal with online hate speech.\nIn late May, Silicon Valley giants agreed in a “ Code of Conduct ” to keep tackling illegal hate speech on their platforms. As part of that code of conduct, a goal was set of reviewing most notifications of illegal hate speech and dealing with them within 24 hours. According to a new report, set to be presented and discussed in Europe on Wednesday and Thursday, tech companies are only meeting that 24-hour goal 40 percent of the time.\n\"If Facebook, YouTube, Twitter and Microsoft want to convince me and the ministers that the non-legislative approach can work, they will have to act quickly and make a strong effort in the coming months,\" Vera Jourova, a commissioner in charge of justice, consumers, and gender equality for the European Commission,  said  according to the Financial Times.\nTWITTER SAYS IT WILL BAN TRUMP IF HE VIOLATES HATE-SPEECH RULES \nThe report is the result of a monitoring exercise of how hate speech is handled online. According to a European Commission official, there were 316 cases in which a non-profit organization flagged content as being hate speech and one of the tech companies responded. Forty percent of the time, the review happened within 24 hours, and over 80 percent of the time, it happened within 48 hours. Of those 316 cases, there were 163 removals.\nThe European Commission says that the 24-hour target is achievable but that the tech companies need to increase their efforts. The report was based on a review period of six weeks.\nThe rate at which illegal hate speech was removed varied considerably between countries. For example, Germany and France saw removal rates of over 50 percent, but in Austria that figure was 11 percent, and in Italy, just 4 percent, according a Commission official.\nAnti-Semitism, national origin, and hatred towards Muslims were the three biggest categories that together represented the majority of notified content.\nSOCIAL MEDIA SITE REDDIT CENSORS TRUMP SUPPORTERS \nFacebook, Twitter, YouTube (owned by Google) and Microsoft did not immediately reply to requests for comment on this story from FoxNews.com. A Google official, however, said in a statement in the  code of conduct  in May that: “We’re committed to giving people access to information through our services, but we have always prohibited illegal hate speech on our platforms. We have efficient systems to review valid notifications in less than 24 hours and to remove illegal content.”",

The percentage of women who voted for Trump was insanely high.\"\nShe said the women who voted for Trump are \"women [who] hate women.\"\nMadonna also said she's asked her friends that voted for Trump to explain their reasoning.\n\"They would rather have a successful businessman running the country than a woman who lies. Just absurd.... In a way, it makes sense that Donald Trump is the president. Because money rules. Not intelligence, not experience, not a moral compass, not the ability to make wise ­decisions, not the ability to think of the future of the human race.\"",

      "text": "Published December 05, 2016 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 Email Print TORONTO (AP) The Toronto Blue Jays signed utility player Steve Pearce to a two-year, $12.5 million contract.\nThe Blue Jays announced the move Monday. It could spell the end of Edwin Encarnacion's tenure in Toronto as Pearce primarily plays first base and first baseman Kendrys Morales and Justin Smoak are also on the roster.\nPearce hit .288 with 13 home runs in 85 games for Tampa Bay and Baltimore last season. The right-handed hitter can also play second base and left and right field and hit .309 against left-handed pitchers.\nMore from FoxSports John Schuerholz continues run of Braves legends in Cooperstown What will Winter Meetings have in store for Braves? Royals spine-tingling moment No. 1: Salvy's walk-off, a father's tears Edinson Volquez calls it an honor to be able to play in Miami Not signing fan favorite Encarnacion will not go over well in Toronto, which led the American League in attendance. Encarnacion hit 42 home runs and led the AL with 127 RBIs along with David Ortiz. The Blue Jays might also let free agent right fielder Jose Bautista sign elsewhere.\nToronto has avoided large long-term contracts since Mark Shapiro became president of the club following the 2015 season.\nPearce, 33, underwent surgery to repair flexor tendons in his right forearm in late September and was expected to be out four to six months.",

      "text": "Published December 05, 2016 FoxNews.com Facebook 0 Twitter 0 Email Print   \nA 15-year-old Iraqi boy caught by police moments before he could blow himself up last August is now speaking out, claiming the Islamic State terror group had brainwashed him.\nPHOTOS: BOY CAUGHT BEFORE DETONATING EXPLOSIVE BELT IN IRAQ \nThe boy said an older teenager ordered him to carry out the attack at a football stadium in Kirkuk.\nRelated Image Expand / Contract Iraqi security services remove suicide vest from boy (REUTERS/Ako Rasheed) \n“I was hesitating. Dureed kept urging, ‘just walk into the middle of them and blow yourself up’, but there was something inside me that was resisting. I couldn’t do it,” the teen told The Times .\nHe went onto say, “I felt a bit relieved, but also confused.  I didn’t know what to do anymore.”\nFOX NEWS GETS FIRST LOOK AT ISIS TUNNELS NEAR MOS UL \nWhile under the guise of ISIS, the boy said the terrorists gave him a new name and put him through months of brainwashing and indoctrination. “No one ever called me by my real name again.”\nRelated Image Expand / Contract Iraqi security detains teenage suicide bomber (REUTERS/Ako Rasheed) \nThe group controls an army of child soldiers, which it calls \"cubs of the caliphate,\" and seeks to re-educate children at ISIS-run schools, drugging some of them, exposing children to violent acts, including beheadings in an effort to create a young army of suicide bombers.\nThe photos from August showed the boy in tears as police restrained him and cut off his suicide vest.  \nISIS has a track record of using children in their terrorist attacks. Just before the incident in Kirkuk, a teenage bomber blew up a wedding in Turkey killing at least 54 people.\nIn addition, a gruesome attack at a Baghdad soccer game last March killed 29 people and wounded 60, with many of the victims children, officials said. The bomber was believed to be a teenager.",
