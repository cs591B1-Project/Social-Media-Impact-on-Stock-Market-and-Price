      "text": "Pilots to Amazon: Timely Christmas deliveries threatened by understaffing by Corwin Haeck, KOMO News \nKOMO photo A A \nSEATTLE - An employee protest Wednesday at Amazon's downtown Seattle headquarters features a seldom-talked-about segment of Amazon's workforce: Their pilots. \nThe pilots, who deliver Amazon goods worldwide, want to send a message to Amazon executives - their air freight carriers are so understaffed they might not be able to make timely deliveries for the Christmas season. \nThe pilots are not directly employed by Amazon. They work for freight carriers Atlas Air and Southern Air, which are under contract to Amazon. \nThe pilots say their beef is with these freight carriers. They say their current contract is substandard - causing more pilots to leave for better opportunities at other airlines. \nPilots say the defections threaten their ability to serve customers this holiday season. They also say a recent union study found they are paid less and work longer hours than pilots who fly for UPS or FedEx, leading to dangerous fatigue. \nThey're calling on Amazon to pressure the carriers to offer an industry-standard contract. \nThe pilot protest will continue through 2 p.m. Wednesday at 410 Terry Avenue. close ",

      "text": "0 COMMENTS Amazon is pushing further into ad technology with the release of two new products aimed at helping web publishers make more money from digital ads. \nAs part of its Publisher Services group, Amazon is rolling out a new “header bidding” product designed to help web publishers enable multiple ad buyers, including ad networks and ad agencies, to bid on ad space simultaneously. \nHeader bidding, which is designed to help publishers gain better control over their ad inventory and generate higher revenue from it, has become an increasingly popular tactic in the digital publishing world. Amazon, a quiet but potentially huge online advertising player , has been an early leader on this front.\nAmazon already provides some header bidding tools to publishers. The twist with this new header bidding product, dubbed Transparent Ad Marketplace, is that it is cloud based. That should let publishers pull in multiple sources of demand without clogging up their websites with lots of code from different header bidding providers, and slowing down their page loads, said Tim Craycroft, Amazon’s vice president of worldwide advertising platforms. That’s because the header bidding auction happens in Amazon’s cloud, not on publishers’ sites, he explained. \nBesides offering simplicity, Amazon says the new product will offer more greater transparency. “Publishers will know where their money is going,” said Mr. Craycroft. Some of that money will come from Amazon itself, as the company buys ads on many publishers via header bidding.\nAd Age first reported on Amazon’s move into cloud-based header bidding. \nIn addition, Amazon is rolling out a new analytics offering, Shopping Insights Service, aimed at helping publishers better understand who is visiting their own sites, using Amazon’s rich set of consumer shopping data.\n“This gives them more insights,” Mr. Craycroft said.\nAudience insights are something that many traditional media companies have lacked on the web, since their visitors don’t typically log in or provide any identifying information.\nTime Inc. has been an early tester of this audience insights data. Kavata Mbondo, the magazine publisher’s vice president of digital revenue strategy and operations, said that already, the title Real Simple has found that its website reaches a significant number of new moms looking for baby products--information the magazine’s sales team can use in courting advertisers.\n“This has been a gap for us,” she said. “This allows us to have much more powerful conversations with brands.” \nFor both services, publishers pay Amazon a monthly fee rather than sharing a percentage of media spending, Mr. Craycroft said.\nWrite to Mike Shields at mike.shields@wsj.com",

      "text": "print Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos David Ryder/Getty Images \nAmazon Payments, the e-commerce company's payments service that competes with PayPal, Apple Pay, and Google Wallet, already owns a sizeable market share and may be its most \"underappreciated\" business, according to RBC Capital's managing director Mark Mahaney. \nSpeaking at Business Insider's Ignition conference on Wednesday, Mahaney said Amazon Payments is showing a lot of potential to \"disrupt\" the payments space, and perhaps, could become the next big revenue driver for the company. \n\"I think Amazon’s ability to disrupt payments is vastly underappreciated,\" Mahaney said. \nMahaney's thinking is based on data from ChannelAdvisor, a leading e-commerce software maker that publishes quarterly data on the general market. As seen in the chart below, 15% of the market cited Amazon Payments as the most preferred payments method after credit card, only trailing PayPal, and coming in way ahead of Apple and Google's competing products. \nRBC Capital \nAmazon Payments enables customers to pay through their Amazon accounts while shopping on other e-commerce sites, saving them the hassle of entering their credit card and shipping info again. Since its launch, the product has gotten thousands of sites on board, but with only a few big names — like the inflight Internet service Gogo — making the list. \nIn April, Amazon Payments launched a new Global Partner Program which allows e-commerce platform providers to easily integrate its service. TechCrunch reported at the time that Amazon has 285 million account holders, with over 23 million of them having paid through their accounts on other sites. \nStill, Mahaney said it's unclear if Amazon Payments will be able to catch up to PayPal and become the de facto paying platform. Payments in general is not a completely underserved market, and Amazon may decide to invest more on growing other initiatives, like its grocery delivery or shipping logistics businesses. \n\"The one challenge here to whether this really becomes the fourth pillar for Amazon is that it’s already a reasonably efficiently served market,\" Mahaney said.",

      "title": "Amazon's Next Big Growth Opportunity Could Be Apparel | Stock News & Stock Market Analysis - IBD",
      "text": "Amazon's Next Big Growth Opportunity Could Be Apparel Apparel sales could be the next big growth opportunity for Amazon.com. (AP) Reprints \nThe notion that Amazon ( AMZN ) will push deeper into apparel and make it a strategic focus was amplified Tuesday when the e-commerce giant unveiled a line of private-label dress shirts for men. \nAmazon announced Buttoned Down, a private-label shirt brand with a starting price of $39.99 and available to members of Amazon Prime. The company said it plans to expand into dress pants, sport shirts and sweaters in the future. Analysts have been watching Amazon closely as it continues an expansion into the apparel category. \n\"Growing consumer acceptance of apparel via e-commerce, as well as the high-value/low-volume characteristics, make this an attractive product category,\" said a research note from Pacific Crest Securities. \"We think that apparel may serve as one of the single biggest incremental growth opportunities within the retail business.\" IBD'S TAKE: New products or services represent the N in IBD's CAN SLIM investing system . Strong earnings growth (the C and A in CAN SLIM, for Current earnings and Annual earnings) is the No. 1 factor to look for in a stock, but New products or services often generate stellar profitability. \nPacific Crest said the Buttoned Down launch is significant for two reasons. First, the offering is being billed as a Prime exclusive. \"We think that the attractive pricing of the men's dress shirts may serve as a compelling incentive for a Prime membership,\" the investment bank said. \"Second, we think the launch shows that Amazon is interested in using private label to fill in areas of apparel that lack strong, national, wholesale-focused brands.\" \nAmazon stock was near 768, up 0.5%, in afternoon trading in the stock market today , getting back above its 10-day line. \nPacific Crest pegs the U.S. apparel market at about $400 billion and says disruptive distribution and business-model changes provide an opportunity for Amazon to make inroads in the market. \nThe move follows the Monday announcement of Amazon Go, a high-tech convenience store in Seattle, where Amazon is based. The 1,800-square-foot store is in beta-testing for now; it opens to all in early 2017. Amazon Go takes dead aim at the physical-store world and poses an increasing threat to Wal-Mart ( WMT ) and others. \nAmazon also reportedly plans to open dozens of small retail storefronts in shopping malls over the next year, designed to showcase its hardware devices, such as the Kindle and Amazon Echo. \nWith the continuing aggression of Amazon, Wal-Mart intends to bring online ordering of groceries and curbside pickup service to nearly a quarter of its roughly 4,600 U.S. stores by the end of 2017, Wal-Mart executives recently said.

      "title": "Amazon's grocery store of the future was predicted in this IBM commercial from 10 years ago (AMZN, IBM)",
      "text": "print \nAmazon plans to open 2,000 of its new, futuristic grocery stores. Amazon \nWhen Amazon debuted its new, futuristic grocery store on Monday, it may have looked a little familiar if you were paying attention in the mid-2000s. \nThat's because IBM predicted nearly the exact same setup — a grocery store with no registers, no cashiers, and no checkout lines — in a TV commercial that aired more than a decade ago. \nTitled \"The Future Market,\" IBM's ad depicts how supermarkets could evolve with the use of r adio-frequency identification, or RFID. In the ad, a man takes products off the shelf, stuffing them in his overcoat and leaving the store, seemingly without paying. The ad makes you think this guy is a stereotypical shoplifter, but in reality, the store was able to identify what he'd grabbed from the shelves and printed out a receipt for him anyway. \nWatch the ad for yourself: \nThe ad looks eerily similar to what Amazon just launched. \nAmazon Go is similarly designed so the store automatically knows which products shoppers have taken from their shelves, adding those products to a digital shopping cart, and knows when they've left the store. Amazon's machine-learning technology can identify the products, so you don't have to manually add them to your account, and o nce you leave the store, Amazon automatically charges the credit card it has on file in your Amazon account. \nWhile IBM's depiction of how this would work is decidedly creepier than Amazon's cheerful video of a woman who just can't decide if she wants a cheesecake cupcake or not, the idea is almost identical — although IBM forgot to innovate on the idea the paper receipt, but we'll forgive them since the iPhone hadn't been introduced yet. \nWe'll have to wait next year to see how Go pans out for Amazon — the first store will open to the public in Seattle next year — but one thing is for sure: IBM was ahead of the curve.

Home Features Amazon's Champions of Fire Invitational Takes a Unique and Casual Approach To eSports [Event Feature] Amazon's Champions of Fire Invitational Takes a Unique and Casual Approach To eSports [Event Feature] Posted on Wednesday, December 7 @ 13:00:00 PST by AFillari With eSports on the rise, there seems to be more and more events happening than people can keep track of. I'm sure many eSports enthusiasts can name several tournaments and invitationals for MOBA and FPS titles, but what about a competition focused around casual games? Well, Amazon AppStore felt it was time to hold the largest ever eSports event focused on the cutthroat and intense genre of mobile games. Held in Las Vegas last week, Amazon's Champions of Fire invitational had various online streamers and personalities square off against each other in several games of skills and reflexes. Broadcast live on Twitch, and with the televised version set to debut on CBS Sports Network on December 12, the tournament aimed to have a new approach to eSports focused on personalities and accessibility, with some surprising results. When you usually think of eSports events, games like Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, League of Legends, and DOTA 2 come to mind, and that what many of the competitors at this event were certainly used to. However, Amazon wanted to try something different. In a round-robin style tournament, players battled it out in a variety of mobile titles like Disney Crossy Road, Fruit Ninja: Tournament Edition, Pac-Man 256, Bloons TD Battles, and 8 Ball Pool. Not quite the fast paced and high-octane titles you'd see at most other invitationals, so it was definitely something that had to be shown in practice. Several of the players also felt a similar apprehension to the concept at first.\"Initially, I was like 'really?', but after they explained it further and that it was going to be a proper production on a large stage, and that other influencers like myself were going to attend, I felt that this could be really entertaining and interesting,\" said Max Gonzales, also known as GassyMexican on Twitch. \"Even if it is a casual game that not a lot of us have played a whole bunch...I think if you get the right kind of competitors and set it up properly, then it can make for something really interesting. Especially with games like Crossy Road, which I think is one of the most hype games they've got in the competition.\" The influencers, which included Boxbox, Professor Broman, Sky Williams, Northernlion, lolRenaynay, Brian Kibler, TangentGaming and many more, were all very receptive to the invitational and were engaged throughout. Even during the show, the talent were simulcasting on their twitch channels for fans, which brought several different communities together during the competition. Every single competitor took the time to thank their fans for the support, which they feel gives them the drive to keep being active in their field.\"It all started as a hobby like way back when, and I was fortunate to start it awhile ago, obviously since so many people are doing it,\" stated Gonzales. \"But I went forward with the motto that 'if you guys keep watching it, I'll keep making content'. And I'm surprised i'm still doing it, it's an amazing job.\" Fellow competitor Michael Nolte, AKA CobaltStreak, also shared these feelings, crediting his fans for his success as an online entertainer.\"It's one of the sole motivating forces that has me loving my job everyday. It's basically like growing up with your friends and having an all-nighter playing videogames, and the folks online are there with you experiencing it. It's really great.\" Following several eliminations in the back off of the event, things began to pick up considerably. Crossy Road ended up becoming the crowd favorite, as the speed and timing required to come out on top resulted in a lot of close calls. Much of the crowd got amped up when seeing players like BoxBox cut through traffic with ease. Albert Zheng, also known as BoxBox, who's made a name for himself in League of Legends competitions, would go on to win the invitational and the $100,000 grand prize. Shortly after the competition, he spoke about his experiences prepping for the competition.\"Coming into this event, I felt pretty confident I was going to win. I did my research on my opponents and did my research on the games, and I was like ninty-percent sure I was going win,\" said Zheng rather confidently. \"The only issues I had were problems with games with luck in them, and if the luck based factors turned against me I could lose....I was mostly scarred by Hafu and Sky as they were the most talented players. But after this event, I'm just gonna go back to normal streaming. This money won't have too much of an effect on me.\" I was fairly skeptical of the event early on. Obviously, eSports tends to focus on the bigger titles that have dedicated and passionate communities, so seeing mobile and casual titles being propped up for tournament play was a bit odd to say the least. With that said, it definitely got exciting towards the end. Once the player pool was slimmed down, and the rounds increased among the surviving players, matches became more intense. I never thought I'd say this, but Crossy Road has an interesting future for tournament play. Seeing it all come together was pretty exciting. There's certainly potential for something worthwhile should this ever become more of a thing, as the barrier for entry is much lower than for games like League or Dota II. I never thought I'd attend an eSports event focused on mobile titles, yet there I was, having fun and watching an entertaining show.",

      "text": "Photo by Amazon It's not even mid-December yet, but Amazon says it knows what the top-selling books of 2016 are. In a just-announced list , the company puts \" Harry Potter and the Cursed Child, Parts 1 & 2, Special Rehearsal Edition Script,\" by J.K. Rowling, Jack Thorne and John Tiffany, in the top spot. Amazon says this is the first time a script has made it into the annual top 20, which includes both hardcover and e-book sales.\nThe No. 2 spot is especially interesting in a list dominated by ongoing series and airport staples like John Grisham and Lee Child. It's \"When Breath Becomes Air,\" a memoir by the late neurosurgeon Paul Kalanithi about his battle with lung cancer.\nNine of the top 20 could be described as mysteries or thrillers, and \"The Nest\" by Cynthia D'Aprix Sweeney was the top debut novel of the year.\nHere's the full list:\n\"Harry Potter and the Cursed Child, Parts 1 & 2, Special Rehearsal Edition Script\" by J.K. Rowling, Jack Thorne and John Tiffany \"When Breath Becomes Air\" by Paul Kalanithi \"The Whistler\" by John Grisham \"The Last Mile\" (Amos Decker series) by David Baldacci \"Killing the Rising Sun: How America Vanquished World War II Japan\" by Bill O'Reilly and Martin Dugard \"Hillbilly Elegy: A Memoir of a Family and Culture in Crisis\" by J.D. Vance \"Truly Madly Guilty\" by Liane Moriarty \"Night School: A Jack Reacher Novel\" by Lee Child \"The Black Widow: Book 16 of Gabriel Allon Series\" by Daniel Silva \"Diary of a Wimpy Kid No. 11: Double Down\" by Jeff Kinney \"15th Affair (Women's Murder Club)\" by James Patterson and Maxine Paetro \"Before the Fall\" by Noah Hawley \"Fool Me Once\" by Harlan Coben \"Crisis of Character: A White House Secret Service Officer Discloses His Firsthand Experience with Hillary, Bill, and How They Operate\" by Gary J.

      "text": "News \nAs the WalMart of the Internet age, Amazon has its fair share of detractors, and for some of the same reasons. With tens of thousands of vendors using Amazon as a storefront, to say nothing of millions of products the company sells directly, sometimes its wares can be a bit on the obscure side. A new system from the retailer is trying to offer a bit of transparency, showing consumers where the products they've ordered were made and packaged. The app is appropriately titled Transparency. \nHere's the gist: certain products and packages from Amazon will come emblazoned with the Transparency logo and an accompanying QR code. Scan said code with the Transparency app and you'll be presented with a brief summary of where your item came from and when, including a \"Best by\" date for perishables. If applicable, it even includes a list of ingredients with explanations for anything not immediately recognizable. \nWhile the sentiment is appreciated, it looks like the Transparency program is in its infancy, with Amazon itself being the only verified participating vendor. When presented with an option to show the production history of their wares, presumably with added time and expense included, I can't imagine many of Amazon's retail partners will be keen to jump on board.",

      "text": "3 mins ago This is one of the world’s largest, most endangered, and most mysterious air-breathing fish! \nNational Geographic recently reported that a new species of the giant air-breathing fish known as the Arapaima has been discovered in Guyana. \nScientists suggest these fish can grow up to 10 feet in length and reach around 400 pounds. \nNat Geo’s explorer Donald J. Stewart recently published the new findings that revealed the evidence for the new species of arapaima. According to the original report, the team was able to take samples of hundred of fish from the Essequibo and Branco River basins. They uncovered two different sets of fish with extremely distinct genetic markers. \nThe concept surrounding this genetic find is that because the fish have not bred across the two groups for so long, they have become different enough to be categorized as separate species. \n“If you have two types of fish swimming along together but not interbreeding, that’s pretty good evidence they are new species,” Stewart explains. “But we still have to work out the details.” \nClassifying these fish is just the beginning. Nat Geo suggests the species continues to remain highly endangered due to pollution and disruption of their natural habitat. While laws were passed back in 2002 to help protect the fish, some illegal poaching still goes on. \nAt this moment scientists are unsure exactly how many arapaimas are actually out there. \n“We need to pay attention to this diversity so we don’t eliminate one of them,” says Stewart. \nStewart continued to suggest that the species was as important to conserve as a “tiger or an elephant.”",

      "text": "Dec 7, 2016 3:56 PM (Screenshot: Amazon) Share Tweet \nLook out, look out, look out, look out , the plant known as Audrey II is coming to devour mankind once again. According to Deadline , Greg Berlanti is going to direct a reboot of Little Shop Of Horrors for Warner Bros. Deadline ’s report says that it will be “a fresh version of the 30-year old Frank Oz-directed film,” which in turn was based on Howard Ashman and Alan Menken’s Off-Broadway musical adapted from a 1960 Roger Corman movie. Matthew Robinson, whose credits include The Invention Of Lying , is tasked with the new screenplay. \nSo what does a 21st-century Little Shop movie mean? Well, they are probably going to CGI the shit out of Audrey II for one. The one possibly positive change they could make to the 1986 film is to restore the musical’s original, more gruesome ending in which Audrey and Seymour are both eaten. The circumstances are slightly different in the play than in the director’s cut of Oz’s movie, but, needless to say, both end in death . Hopefully Berlanti will embrace the darkness in Little Shop ’s soul, and not fuck around with Ashman and Menken’s unimpeachable score. \nAnd, if anyone needs casting advice, Jake Gyllenhaal recently did a well-received Seymour in a concert production opposite original Audrey, Ellen Greene. \n ",

      "text": "By Tonya Garcia, MarketWatch\nE-commerce retailers hit the refresh button on store format\nWhen Amazon.com Inc. unveiled the video for its new Amazon Go convenience stores, many on Twitter felt they were getting a sneak peek into the future of stores. Highlighting its use of technology like artificial intelligence, Amazon (AMZN) presented viewers with a vision for brick-and-mortar stores that is a departure from what shoppers have come to know at the local mall.\n(https://twitter.com/saradietschy/status/805790710427308033)\n(https://twitter.com/dansvibes/status/805791634319347714?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\nIn the clip, shoppers check in with their Amazon Go apps by scanning their phone on a kiosk and simply start shopping. The technology tracks what's being purchased and, without stopping first at checkout, sends a receipt through the app after they leave the store.\nOnline retailers are increasingly setting up shop in brick-and-mortar locations. However, they have liberated themselves free from customary store rules, giving them the flexibility to create the kind of in-store experience that they hope will drive traffic.\n\"Even as e-commerce and home delivery emerged in the late 90s to present a new shopper expectation of instant gratification, the approaches to merchandising in physical retail have not fundamentally changed in 100-plus years,\" said Justin Behar, chief executive of retail data and analytics company Quri.\nSee also:Amazon takes on tech's white whale: grocery shopping (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/amazon-takes-on-techs-white-whale-grocery-shopping-2016-12-05)\nNowadays, consumers are focused on experiences over stuff, which is tough for companies that specialize in selling stuff. Retailers are trying to give shoppers a reason to peel themselves off the couch and head to a store. That's not just a matter of more bells and whistles, but rather fashioning a shopping experience that fits the lifestyle of the shopper.\n(https://twitter.com/amazon/status/805785561768357888)\nOn Tuesday, Rent the Runway, a fashion company that allows subscribers to rent a rotating wardrobe, opened its new New York City flagship store. The company has six other stores in places like Chicago and San Francisco.\nSee also: Cyber Monday goes mobile, breaks $1 billion in sales (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/cyber-monday-sales-results-show-mobile-investments-are-paying-off-2016-11-29)\nOf Rent the Runway's six million members, 90% are working women, according to company data. When it launched in 2009, many of the outfits rented were for special events. Now, work wear is a big area.\nA third of rentals are for same-day wear. About 16 % of orders are picked up and dropped off in stores. Using the concierge feature on the Rent the Runway app, users can chat with a sales associate and have items ready for them when they arrive. Or, if they can't make it to the store, items can be sent using Uber Rush.\n\"We want to get you in and out of the store in whatever time you're willing to give us,\" Rent the Runway Chief Operating Officer Maureen Sullivan told MarketWatch during a tour of the new store.\nMaking shopping a time-efficient task is one of the things traditional retailers can learn from this new breed of brick-and-mortar store. Note the first guy in the Amazon Go video who walks in and out of the store in about 10 seconds.\n\"Putting me in control of how much time it will take to get out of the store and how to organize my life is a value add,\" said Brendan Witcher, principal analyst at Forrester. \"Companies like Amazon and others are challenging what retail should be and can be.\"\nRetailers like Macy's Inc. (M) , Gap Inc. (GPS) and Guess Inc. (GES) are rethinking their brick-and-mortar footprint, part of an effort to become the \"omnichannel\" operations that modern retail requires. But reaching that goal is about more than just rationalizing the number of stores they have.\nSee also:Guess joins list of retailers that are shrinking their store footprint (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/guess-joins-list-of-retailers-that-are-shrinking-their-store-footprint-2016-12-01)\n\"Traditional retailers need to start becoming customer obsessed,\" said Witcher. \"Today retailers need to take a step back and look at the customer journey and ask, 'Are we enhancing that customer journey, creating value, consistency and convenience?' By removing things that add no value, in essence you actually add value.\"\nSee also: What not to buy at Target and Walmart (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/what-not-to-buy-at-target-and-walmart-2014-11-19)\nBonobos, an online men's apparel retailer, has 29 \"Guideshops\" across the country with a Nashville location coming this month. At the Bonobos store on Madison Avenue in Manhattan, one goal is to be hands on while using technology to personalize a shopper's visit, said Chief Revenue Officer Erin Ersenkal.\nThe company never intended to have actual locations. \"What we discovered, which is pretty obvious, was there are some customers who do still like to try on and touch things before purchasing,\" said Ersenkal.\nBesides that, if you build a store where the shopper feels like a VIP, they will come.\nSee also:Customers hate fitting rooms - and clothing retailers are paying the price (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/customers-hate-fitting-rooms-and-clothing-retailers-are-paying-the-price-2016-06-08)\n\"Because orders are fulfilled through [the website], we're able to focus on providing every customer with a unique and personal experience,\" Ersenkal said, highlighting the company's iOS system, created by Tulip Retail, a mobile platform that offers \"a more seamless checkout experience.\"\nPerhaps the key to the modern store is simply finding a way to get rid of the queue at the register.\n\"People don't walk into a store saying, 'I hope I spend five minutes in a checkout line,'\" said Witcher.\n-Tonya Garcia; 1628ET\n ",

      "title": "Amazon's Newest Grocery Store: Could There Have Been A Mistake?",
      "text": "With Amazon's release of their grocery store, could they have made a mistake?(Photo : David McNew/Getty Images) \nAmazon is believed to have failed a move recently, particularly on their retail grocery stores called Amazon Go. \nAfter the launch of their intriguingly convenient video about their newest grocery store, there has been news as to how the e-commerce store missed out on one important detail in business that might affect the store's overall success, reported USA Today . \nBusiness Insider talks about this and refers to the Prime benefits as the \"problem.\" Basically, the Prime annual membership of Amazon, that's been giving its consumers a lot of additional perks, is reported to be too exclusive. Because of this, non-Prime members have had no way of getting into this new project. \nNaturally, there is a significant disparity between the cost of having Prime-exclusive benefits and having non-Prime-exclusive ones. Unfortunately, for the non-members, the reports say that Amazon Go will be Prime-exclusive. \nAccording to Business Insider, Amazon may have missed out on the fact that the non-Prime members have a strong purchasing power that can affect the market margin too. But then again, business analyst John Blackledge forecasts that this would still relatively be quite a fair deal. \nHe noted that Amazon may only be taking this decision as an initial step and that in the next couple of months they will be opening their doors to the non-Prime members already. In his interview with the Insider, he says, \"this might be a way to first expand their customer base and then over time, convert non-Prime members to Prime members.\" \nThis then ends with the non-Prime members happy and Amazon Go growing. If that is indeed the plan, then it only means that this move for expansion could still help Amazon finish on the 7th place of the top 20 e-commerce stores, which is not only fair but wise as well.

I realize this is probably of limited use for some of you, but I thought it was worth posting for the gear users and the truly cheap slick deal population. It was $6 a few weeks ago at Amazon, but was part of the add-on program.\n\nAmazon, $5 [ amazon.com ] \n\nSure, getting new stuff at a hot price is great, but I still think a real slick deal is keeping something I already own in functioning condition. To that end, this is a great product for fixing outdoor gear and adding some extra life to things like shoes, waders, and so on. Think of it as a modern, super-strong \"shoe goo.\" According to CCC, this is the lowest price ever.\n",

      "title": "Amazon Go's \"just walk out\" technology sounds like a headache for shoppers of color",
      "text": "Amazon, the internet retailer eager to put drones in your skies and holiday deals in your inbox, now brings us Amazon Go . The physical store, which will open next year in Seattle, lets customers purchase goods by literally taking the item off the shelf and leaving the store — a system called \"just walk out.\" (The item is automatically charged to your Amazon account.) If or when that trend trickles down to traditional retailers, it'll cut the time of shopping in half.\nAmazon Go looks like this:\nSource: YouTube If time is money, Amazon just made everyone a fortune. But the frustration it could cause shoppers of color has the potential to erase that value, as many people on Twitter pointed out.\nOh the profiling and misunderstandings leading to shoplifiting accusations using this we'll get is gonna be *kisses fingers* https://t.co/iFpVIvZhWg\nRacial profiling is a major problem for retailers. M inority shoppers know this feeling all too well: A store employee singling us out, continually checking on us, issuing warnings. Store managers operate under the false assumption that people of color are more likely to steal. It's an effort known as \"loss prevention,\" but it looks and acts like racial profiling .\nW hich is why a store like Amazon Go is exciting, yet unnerving.\n\"In a world where even Oprah has been profiled for walking around a store, there are lots of people who might not want to risk trusting a store to treat them fairly,\" tech CEO Anil Dash said in an email.\nT he stats reveal why. The tale of the black person being unfairly watched and followed while shopping is not new . And it's still around . In a 2013 study by the Pew Research Center , 44% of blacks reported unfair treatment in stores compared to just 16% of whites — even though the FBI's data on shoplifting and race suggests f ar more white people are arrested for larceny , which includes shoplifting. Unfair treatment can turn deadly for black shoppers like William Chapman , a teen killed by police in 2015 after he was accused of shoplifting at a Walmart in Virginia.\nWhite people who have never been \"randomly\" followed around at a Walgreens may have no problem walking into a store, grabbing an item and leaving — like this guy in the Amazon Go promo video.\nWhite people who have never been \"randomly\" followed around at a Walgreens will have no problem walking into a store, grabbing an item and leaving. Source: Amazon/YouTube But shoppers of color, who already see enough unwanted attention, may have their doubts. Especially in a store where the employees are mostly there for customer service, as Amazon's promo video suggests. They roam the store, stock shelves and hang out near shoppers.\n\"The danger isn't just being stopped,\" Dash said, \"but more the low-level desire to not be potentially hassled even if it's easily resolved.\"\nAmazon Go is a beautiful system for a perfect world. \"No lines. No checkout.\" Source: Amazon/YouTube Silicon Valley's utopian ideas have a tendency to include unintentional bias — if only because employees of tech companies don't often properly represent the variety of their customers.\nAmazon's bold idea for the retailer of the future isn't entirely new. Apple Stores, for example, allow you to purchase on the app and then take your item off the shelf and leave. But as Dash notes, even the Apple Store can make some buyers hesitant. \"Potential embarrassment alone stops many people,\" he said. (In 2015, a woman named Christine Wisne sued Apple Inc. for racial discrimination; similar complaints have followed.)\nThe difference with Amazon's version is that it uses cameras and deep learning to keep track of what you pick up and put back. Meaning you can grab and go without buying on the app first, and the orange-shirted Amazon employees hovering around won't hassle you.\nThe Amazon store will also be filled with cameras that enable Amazon's artificial intelligence to recognize the faces of those lifting items. But we know cameras have failed people of color in the past, and more recently, AI has failed us too . (So has surveillance data meant to keep us and our communities safe.)\nIt's too early to call foul on Amazon, a retailer known for its aggressive experimentation: The store hasn't opened yet, and the company will have plenty of time to add anti-bias practices to its employee training.\nFew can say for sure what Seattle residents will experience. Though we'll be anxious to find out when Amazon Go opens its doors to the public in 2017.",

      "text": "Buffett’s shrinking Wal-Mart stake signals Amazon holiday threat   12:09 P.M. Berkshire Hathaway Chairman and CEO Warren Buffett is shown May 2. Berkshire said last month that it cut its holding in Wal-Mart to 13 million shares as of Sept. 30, marking the third-straight quarter that Buffett’s company lowered its stake. (John Peterson / Associated Press) By Katherine Chiglinsky, Shannon Pettypiece and Jordyn Holman Bloomberg SMS \nWhen Berkshire Hathaway Inc. Vice Chairman Charles Munger lamented the mistakes made in the company’s first 50 years under Warren Buffett, he cited the failure to buy Wal-Mart Stores stock early enough in the retailer’s history. Judging by recent events, Buffett doesn’t think Wal-Mart is such a great idea for his company’s next half-century. \nBerkshire said last month that it cut its holding in the Bentonville, Arkansas-based retailer to 13 million shares as of Sept. 30, marking the third-straight quarter that Buffett’s company lowered its stake. Online shopping has shifted the balance of power among retailers, a trend that’s become more evident this holiday season, and Wal-Mart stock has trailed Amazon.com in recent years. \n“He makes mistakes too,” Brian Yarbrough, an analyst with Edward Jones & Co., said of Buffett. “There are a lot of better places to put new money than Wal-Mart,” he added. “They are going to have to continue to fight this headwind of Amazon.” \nBuffett, 86, has long highlighted the vulnerability of even the largest retailers, citing Sears, F.W. Woolworth, Kresge and Montgomery Ward as merchants that lost their dominant positions. More recently, he’s focused on the threat from companies like Jeff Bezos’s Amazon that sell everything from food to clothes and electronic gadgets online. \n“It is a big, big force and it has already disrupted plenty of people and it will disrupt more,” Buffett told shareholders at Omaha, Nebraska-based Berkshire’s most recent annual meeting. Many competitors, “including us in a few areas, have not figured the way to either participate in it, or to counter it.” \nWal-Mart still trades below its closing price from 2013, even after rallying 15 percent since Dec. 31. Berkshire’s stake topped 60 million shares in 2014, when Wal-Mart was one of Buffett’s five biggest equity positions, valued at more than $5 billion at the end of the year. The holding was cut by more than half in the three months ended Sept. 30, according to a regulatory filing, and now it doesn’t crack the top-15 list in Berkshire’s portfolio, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. \nWhile Buffett is known for sticking with stocks like Coca-Cola Co. for decades, he’s not wedded to old favorites when circumstances change. In recent years, he got rid of most of Berkshire’s stock in Procter & Gamble Co. and Graham Holdings Co., the former owner of the Washington Post. \nHis company recently invested in airlines, an industry that Buffett long dismissed as too risky. Also, he’s empowered deputy stock pickers to diversify the portfolio, a move that led to an investment in iPhone maker Apple. Buffett has mostly avoided tech stocks, and missed out on the years-long rally at Amazon, even as he repeatedly praised Bezos. \nBerkshire’s units include several retailers, such as Helzberg Diamonds, Jordan’s Furniture and Nebraska Furniture Mart. They are a fraction of the size, however, of subsidiaries like the BNSF railway, the Geico auto insurer and an energy operation. And Buffett has said he learned some tough lessons in the retail business. \n“We have a really bad record, starting in 1966,” Buffett told CNBC in 2014. “We bought what we thought was a second-rate department store in Baltimore at a third-rate price, but we found out very quickly that we bought a fourth-rate department store.” \nStill, he saw something different in Wal-Mart, which, like Geico, established itself as a dominant low-cost provider. Berkshire disclosed a stake of 19.9 million shares in 2005 and doubled the holding by the end of 2009. The stock had already surged more than 4,000 percent in the two decades through 2004. Munger, 92, has lamented that Berkshire didn’t invest sooner. \n“While mistakes of commission were common, almost all huge errors were in not making a purchase, including not purchasing Wal-Mart stock when that was sure to work out enormously well,” Munger wrote in a 2015 letter to investors. “The errors of omission were of much importance. Berkshire’s net worth would now be at least $50 billion higher if it had seized several opportunities it was not quite smart enough to recognize as virtually sure things.” \nWal-Mart’s efforts in e-commerce haven’t inspired the same confidence. More than half of U.S. online consumers say they go to Amazon first when searching for a product. The nation’s shoppers spend 30 percent of their time online at Amazon.com, compared with 3 percent on Walmart.com. \nWal-Mart in September acquired Jet.com, giving a boost to e-commerce sales. The company is also encouraging customers to order over the internet and pick up items at stores, and is even bringing grocery orders to online shoppers’ cars in parking lots. Buffett didn’t immediately return a message left with an assistant seeking comment. Wal-Mart had no immediate comment. \nBuffett has a long history with the retailer, buying its McLane food-distribution business in 2003. The billionaire wrote the next year that he often voted for Wal-Mart in Fortune magazine’s “most-admired” survey, and acquired the trucking unit after a two-hour negotiation and without any due diligence. \n“We knew everything would be exactly as Wal-Mart said it would be,” Buffett wrote. “And it was.” Sales from Berkshire’s units to Wal-Mart were about $13 billion for three straight years, according to the billionaire’s most recent annual report. \nBuffett says that he and Munger look for growth in industries like energy production and some manufacturing operations, where there are substantial barriers to entry for potential competitors. This year, they acquired Precision Castparts, which provides specialized products to the world’s largest aerospace companies. \n“Charlie and I are not going to out-Bezos Bezos by a long shot,” Buffett said at the annual meeting. The retail consumer’s shift to online ordering “does not worry us, obviously, with Precision Castparts. It doesn’t worry us in terms of the overwhelming majority of our businesses. But it is a huge economic trend that 20 years ago was not on anybody’s radar screen. And lately it’s been on everybody’s radar screen.”   12:09 p.m.",

      "text": "Alexa Finds Her Way into a Lamp By SV Staff   GE has integrated Amazon’s Alexa Voice Service into a prototype LED table lamp, the first in a planned suite of connected products. \nThe company envisions homeowners gathering around the “C by GE” lamp to “order your dinner, listen to the latest headlines, preheat your oven, or give a host of other voice commands.” \nWith an embedded speaker and microphones, the voice-controlled lamp/personal assistant is hailed as the first lighting product to incorporate Alexa. The system operates on its own without a hub or connected smartphone, according to GE. Plug in the lamp and connect to Alexa to “unleash a whole new world of tech functionality and smart device interoperability throughout the home.” \nThe lamp will be available for pre-order in early 2017 on CbyGE.com with product availability slated for the second quarter of 2017. It will be designed in part by Richard Clarkson , designer of The Cloud , a cloud-shaped ceiling fixture that produces a motion-triggered lightning and thunder performance. \nJeff Patton, general manager of GE Lighting’s Connected Home Products group said: “This integration is so much more than connecting lighting to voice integration. It’s really about simplifying and extending an experience for consumers, allowing them to add smart capabilities throughout the home through a really simple form factor. Consumers don’t need a cell phone, a special switch or a hub. They just need their voice.” \nGE said it is incubating a suite of connected products, through GE Lighting’s C by GE brand, and working with ecosystem partners to create a seamless connected experience that elevates what you can do at home, helping you free up time, add security, enable broader control and have fun doing it. \nFrom the press release: The connected home market is expected to grow threefold over the next few years, and consumers expect a seamless experience as part of that process. This introduction springboards that by leveraging something ubiquitous in the home today—lighting. \n“We’re excited to work with GE Lighting to bring Alexa to their LED lamp and enable new types of voice experiences,” said Aaron Brown, director of Alexa. “Voice is the future of home automation and the combination of Alexa with the GE LED table lamp, provides people with a simple and frictionless way to interact with their homes.” \nTo propel the connected home experience, GE is not only relying on inventors within its own walls, but drawing inspiration from companies like Amazon, real-world homeowners it’s learning from and incubating with everyday inventors. The Alexa-enabled GE lamp drew inspiration from GE Lighting’s real-world living labs, whereby the company tests lighting and connected home features and functionality with real-world consumers to learn and iterate based on their feedback. \nThe concept also was influenced by a recent crowdsourcing challenge where GE, Masker Media and Hackster partnered to solicit makers, from college students to data scientists, to bring LEDs to life in new and unexpected ways. The winning ideas, which will be considered as part of future connected lighting designs, included lighting that notifies you when you are sitting idle for too long and encourages you to get moving; lighting-based motion detection that syncs with security services; a lit crib mobile that detects a baby’s heart rate and oxygen levels to protect against SIDS; and lighting that tracks activity in the home to know who is home and where they are to customize lighting based on an individual’s preferences and habits.

      "text": "Share There is currently a price error on Amazon which doubles up on discounts on a select range of Blu-Rays and DVDs. The DVD or Blu-Ray needs to be in both the 2 for £10 offer and the 3 for £20 offer to apply. I bought the following for the sum of £18.29 (free delivery because it was over £20 before the discount): 12 Years a Slave Blu-Ray American Beauty BR Hot Tub Time Machine 2 BR An American Werewolf in London BR Watership Down BR It appears adding different items has a different effect on the discount. I have seen it lower than the £18.29 I got those for. I believe it can go under £17 for six items. Other Blu-Ray titles that appear to be in both offers include amongst others: Chinatown",

The world's biggest store is reducing prices by 20 percent or more on a handful of LEGO Star Wars sets, and there's something at almost any price point. A few sets have already sold out, so if you're still looking for a perfect gift for the LEGO or Star Wars buff in your life, act quickly. \nMental Floss has affiliate relationships with certain retailers (including Amazon) and may receive a small percentage of any sale.

It's the same deal Amazon offered on the Alta for Cyber Monday, so if you've been mulling a Fitbit purchase, it's probably going to be hard to top this deal. Buy at Amazon: Fitbit Alta Fitness Tracker, Silver/Black, All Sizes for $84.96 (list price $129.95) \nMental Floss has affiliate relationships with certain retailers (including Amazon) and may receive a small percentage of any sale.

      "text": "Amazon Go: Yep, They Really Invented A Checkout-Free Convenience Store December 7, 2016 \nYes, Amazon really built an actual convenience store. And it’s unlike any mini-mart set up in your neighborhood. Called Amazon Go, the brick-and-mortar store ditches the checkout line entirely, using AI and a variety of sensors to identify whatever you take from the store and automatically charge your account. \nThat’s right, Amazon built a store that works just like your kitchen, so you can grab anything off the shelf, dump it on your bag, and be on your merry way. No more queueing long lines, having each item scanned, and swiping your card at the register – the store can automatically identify anything you take and bill you all on its own. \nWhen you first get to an Amazon Go location, all you need to do is sign in with the accompanying app. From there, you just grab anything you want from the shelves and leave when you’re done. Described as “the most advanced shopping technology,” the store uses computer vision, sensor fusion, and deep learning to accurately track everything you take, even going so far as to identify when you’ve decided to put an item back, so you won’t end up incorrectly billed. \nThe first store, situated in Seattle, consists of 1,800 square feet of retail space, with a layout not unlike most convenience stores, albeit without cash registers and store clerks standing behind them. As of now, the store is in beta and only available to Amazon employees, although once they fully-open, any customer with an Amazon account and a phone with the accompanying app can shop. \nLearn more about Amazon Go from the official site.",
