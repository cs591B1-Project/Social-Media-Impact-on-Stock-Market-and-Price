      "text": "Boeing: Working With US Air Force On Subsequent Phases Of Air Force One Program December 06, 2016, 08:39:00   Boeing Co. ( BA ) said that it is currently under contract for $170 million to help determine the capabilities of complex military aircraft that serve the unique requirements of the President of the United States. It looks forward to working with the U.S. Air Force on subsequent phases of the Air Force One program allowing the company to deliver the best planes for the President at the best value for the American taxpayer. \nEarlier today, US President-elect Donald Trump has asked the US government to cancel the order with aircraft maker Boeing for new Air Force One, the official air plane for US President, as its costs were out of control. \n\"Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order!\" he tweeted Tuesday morning. \nBoeing will build two or more new planes for US Presidents that would enter service around 2024. Meanwhile, Trump would not be able to use the new planes unless he won a second term in the 2020 election. \nDonald Trump will have the power to cancel the contract with Boeing for the new planes when he takes power as the US President and Commander-in-chief in January. \n ",

      "text": "President-elect Donald Trump caused a stir Tuesday morning, attacking the airline company Boeing for out of control costs and issuing a \"cancel order\" on the renovation for Air Force One.\n\"Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion,\" Trump tweeted. In his typical fashion, he punctuated the tweet with a final declaration — \"Cancel order!\"\nBoeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order!\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 6, 2016\n\"The plane is totally out of control,\" Trump told reporters Tuesday afternoon inside Trump Tower. \"It's going to be over $4 billion for Air Force One program and I think it's ridiculous. I think Boeing is doing a little bit of a number. We want Boeing to make a lot of money, but not that much money.\"\nPresident-elect Trump on his desire to cancel Boeing’s Air Force One order: “We want Boeing to make a lot of money, but not that much money” pic.twitter.com/kIdpCy0JuX\n— CNN (@CNN) December 6, 2016\nWhile Trump's desire to save money is admirable, his numbers and his assessment that the project is \"out of control\" are quite questionable. Shortly after this tweet, Boeing released a statement on the project. \"We are currently under contract for $170 million to help determine the capabilities of these complex military aircraft that serve the unique requirements of the President of the United States,\" the statement read.\n\"We look forward to working with the U.S. Air Force on subsequent phases of the program allowing us to deliver the best planes for the President at the best value for the American taxpayer,\" the statement concluded.\n\"We don't know where the $4 billion number came from,\" Boeing spokesman Todd Blecher told PJ Media in an email statement. \"The Air Force estimate released today is around $3 billion.\" When asked if there has been any recent increase in estimates or spending to justify Trump's claim that costs are \"out of control,\" Blecher said, \"Not that we are aware of.\"\nThe $3 billion refers to an Air Force budgetary document which projects that research, development, testing, and evaluation of the new pair of Air Force Ones (they are always manufactured into pairs) will cost $2.87 billion between fiscal years 2015 and 2021. The project will not be over in 2021, however, and PolitiFact reported that it would require another $1 billion after 2021 to finish the job. Specifically, the Teal Group estimated the project will require $858 million more between fiscal years 2022 and 2026.\nThe grand total? $3.73 billion over 12 years. Although that isn't \"more than $4 billion,\" it is reasonably close — and an Air Force spokesman said the $2.7 billion estimate would likely \"change as the program matures.\" Furthermore, this estimate does not include operations and maintenance costs, including aviation fuel, upkeep, and pilot salaries.\n\"Canada was in line to buy the F-35, but then realized that they would [ sic ] actually had to operate the things, and they had sticker shock,\" explained John Pike, director of globalsecurity.org. \"Malaysia bought a bunch of Mig-29s without a service contract, to save money, and they soon turned into hangar queens.\"\nSo while Trump's general estimate of above $4 billion might be accurate, his description of this cost as \"out of control\" is not exactly fair.\nBoeing Makes Deal After 'Several Official Visits' to Iran\nNext Page: Why the Air Force One project is so expensive, and why it needs to go through.\nhttps://pjmedia.com/trending/2016/12/06/trump-to-boeing-cancel-order-on-air-force-one/\nprevious Page 1 of 2 next View as single page",

      "text": "Trump may cancel Boeing order for new Air Force One King 5 Travis Pittman, KING 6:43 PM. CST December 06, 2016 Air Force One flying over Mount Rushmore. (Photo by USAF) \nPresident-elect Donald Trump says construction of the next Air Force One -- a Boeing 747-8 -- should be canceled due to the costs. \nTrump tweeted Tuesday morning: Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 6, 2016 \n\"The plane is totally out of control. It's going to be over $4 billion for the Air Force One program,\" Trump later said in the lobby of Trump Tower Tuesday. “I think its ridiculous. I think Boeing is doing a little bit of a number. We want Boeing to make a lot of money but not that much money.” \nBoeing released this statement in response. \n\"We are currently under contract for $170 million to help determine the capabilities of this complex military aircraft that serves the unique requirements of the President of the United States. We look forward to working with the US Air Force on subsequent phases of the program allowing us to deliver the best plane for the president at the best value for the American taxpayer.\" \nMultiple reports say the total cost for the new 747-8s would be between $2,7 billion and $3.2 billion. UPDATE: White House says some of Trump's Air Force One statistics don't appear to reflect arrangements between Boeing, Department of Defense \nRelated: History and background of Air Force One The Wall Street Journal reports the two current Air Force One planes, which are heavily-modified 747-200s, are due to reach the end of their designed 30-year lifespan next year. Although Boeing has a contract to begin development on the new versions, it has not yet reached a deal to build the planes. \nKING 5 Aviation Specialist Glenn Farley says Boeing would be paid to build the basic airplane. The rest of the cost would be paid to a contractor who would be hired to make extensive modifications to the plane. \nThe government would not just be buying one but two 747-8s. And they aren't your average passenger jets. They would undergo heavy modifications needed to make the planes into mobile command centers complete with an anti-missile system and countermeasures. \nThe executive director of SPEEA, the union which represents Boeing engineers, tweeted this in response. @Reuters The Presidential airplanes aren't just fancy airplanes. They are mobile Whitehouses hardened to survive WWIII. ",

      "text": "President-elect Donald Trump slammed the cost of a new Air Force One and used Twitter to call for canceling the new aircraft fleet Tuesday, raising questions about the future of the program managed at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base.\n>> Read more trending stories\nIn a tweet sent at 8:52 a.m., the Quote: : \"Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order!\"\nBoeing spokesman Todd Blecher declined comment and referred all questions to the Air Force, which did not immediately release a response.\nThe Air Force is planning to replace two aging Boeing 747-200s that serve as Air Force One when the president is aboard with two newer and highly modified Boeing 747-8 airliners. The jets were expected to join the fleet by 2024, replacing a current fleet that will be more than three decades old at the time.\nA program official at Wright-Patterson has said the White House has urgently asked for the jets because of reliability concerns as the planes age, among other concerns.\nRichard Aboulafia, a senior aviation analyst with the Virginia-based Teal Group, said in an email the tweet was \"complete nonsense. But making program management and military requirements decisions via tweet is just very wrong.\"\nIn an interview, he said the president-elect's position on the Air Force One replacement was \"very concerning.\"\n\"This is not from the standpoint of the contract, but just from deeper lack of understanding for what the president does,\" he said. \"It's very important for the president to travel, visit other places in the country, and other countries and be able to manage national emergencies while he travels. You can't do that without Air Force One.\n\"Now the alternative is he thinks a 50-year-old Air Force One will do the job,\" Aboulafia said. \"Hopefully, nobody can be that completely misinformed.\"\nA message seeking comment was sent to Trump spokespersons this morning.\nTodd Harrison, director of the aerospace project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, D.C., said it's a tradition for an outgoing president to request a new Air Force One \"so that it would not be seen as being for personal benefit.\" President George H.W. Bush's administration OK'd the purchase of the current fleet, he noted.\n\"If Trump cancels the program now, it could be another eight years before a new replacement program is started, so that aircraft would be pushing 40 years old by then,\" Harrison wrote.\nThe production of the iconic Boeing 747 jumbo jet could come to an end \"so it's not clear that the Air Force would be able to buy a commercial derivative plane like the 747 from a U.S. company in the future.\"\nNeither Boeing nor the Air Force has released the latest figures on the program.\nAboulafia said the more than $4 billion Trump cited was \"about right over 10 years.\"\n\"It's incredibly expensive to be able to manage a country and fight a war from the air, and build two planes that can do that,\" he said. But he rejected the claim the costs were \"out of control.\"\nLoren B. Thompson, a senior defense analyst at the Virginia-based Lexington Institute and a defense industry consultant, said in an email the president-elect \"probably overstates\" the cost of the two new jets.\n\"Boeing thinks the program will cost less, but it is hard to say precisely how much because the Air Force hasn't finalized the requirements for the program.\n\"This is a plane that might need to remain airborne for days during a nuclear war,\" Thompson wrote. \"It must be able to carry out functions no other plane in the world would need to accomplish.\"\nThe jet's cost is driven by its mission with self-protection measures such as shielding against electromagnetic pulse in a nuclear explosion and specialized communication gear to command a nuclear strike \"which is why it is so much more expensive than the planes Trump is used to buying,\" Harrison wrote.\nThe National Museum of the U.S. Air Force hopes to land one of the current Air Force Ones when the plane was expected to be retired in the next decade to add to its collection of 10 presidential aircraft.",

      "text": "Trump on Boeing's Air Force One contract: 'Cancel order!' Phil Stewart and Amy Tennery, Reuters Posted at Dec 07 2016 07:29 AM \nShare Facebook Air Force One sits ready for boarding on the tarmac at Joint Base Andrews in Washington, US, Tuesday. Kevin Lamarque, Reuters \nWASHINGTON/NEW YORK - U.S. President-elect Donald Trump urged the government on Tuesday to cancel an order with Boeing Co for a revamped Air Force One - a prominent symbol of the U.S. presidency - complaining that costs were out of control. \nIt was the latest example of Trump using his podium, often via brief Twitter messages, to rattle companies and foreign countries as he seeks to shake up business as usual in Washington. Trump, who takes office on Jan. 20, took aim at what he called cost overruns even though the plane is only in development stages. \n\"Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order!\" Trump said on Twitter. It was not immediately clear what prompted the timing of his complaint. \nTrump, who has vowed to use his skills as a businessman to make good deals that benefit American taxpayers, then made a surprise appearance in the lobby of Trump Tower in New York, where he amplified his comments. \n\"The plane is totally out of control. I think it's ridiculous. I think Boeing is doing a little bit of a number. We want Boeing to make a lot of money but not that much money,\" he told reporters. \nBoeing, which has built planes for U.S. presidents since 1943, has not yet begun building the two replacements for the current Air Force One planes, which are scheduled to be in service by 2024. \nBoeing has not yet been awarded the money to build the proposed replacements. \n\"We are currently under contract for $170 million to help determine the capabilities of these complex military aircraft that serve the unique requirements of the President of the United States,\" the company said in a statement. \nNOT A 'VANILLA' JUMBO JET \nThe U.S. Air Force, which operates the presidential planes, first announced in January 2015 that Boeing's 747-8 would be used to replace the two current presidential planes. \nThe planes can fly direct from Washington to Hong Kong, 1,000 miles (1,600 km) farther than the current Air Force One. They are designed to be an airborne White House able to fly in worst-case security scenarios, such as nuclear war. \nPresident Barack Obama, who was flying on the aging Air Force One to Tampa, Florida, on Tuesday, has called the plane one of the best perks of the presidency. \nThe Air Force said in a statement that it had budgeted $2.7 billion in the coming year for the initial stage of the project involving research, development, testing and evaluation. \nThe current Air Force plan envisions extensive modifications to a Boeing 747-8, including military avionics, advanced communications and a self-defense system, according to budget documents seen by Reuters. \n\"Of course it’s not like buying a vanilla Boeing jumbo jet,\" said defense consultant Loren Thompson, who has close ties to Boeing and other companies. \nA March report from the Government Accountability Office, the investigative arm of Congress, estimated the cost of the overall program at $3.21 billion, including the purchase of two aircraft. \nBut the GAO estimated the costs for research and development would be would be low, at just under $2 billion. If the GAO report used the same Air Force estimate for research and development, then its estimate would be around $4 billion. \nBoeing shares dipped after Trump's tweet but were flat at the end of the trading day. \nHIS OWN PLANE US President-elect Donald Trump speaks to members of the news media in the main lobby at Trump Tower in Manhattan, New York City, US, Wednesday. Brendan McDermid, Reuters \nTrump is known for his love of his own Boeing 757 jet. In a 2015 Rolling Stone profile, he said his plane was \"bigger than Air Force One, which is a step down from this in every way.\" \n\"Did you know it was featured on the Discovery Channel as the world's most luxurious jetliner?\" he said. \nBoeing says current Air Force One contract worth $170 million Trump's broadside against Boeing comes as Washington's business lobbyists are bracing for a wild ride. \nA New York real estate developer, Trump took aim at big corporations during his campaign, saying that they often harm ordinary Americans by sending jobs abroad. \nSince winning the Nov. 8 election he has taken credit for pushing United Technologies Corp and Ford Motor Co to backtrack on outsourcing plans. \nBoth Ford and United Technologies said they support Trump's efforts to cut corporate tax rates and overhaul regulations, which could save the companies billions in the long run. \nTrump’s attack on Boeing was the main topic of discussion at the annual luncheon of the Aerospace Industries Association on Tuesday, where the group’s CEO Dave Melcher urged the new administration to promote trade and bolster the high-paying manufacturing jobs that the $143 billion a year sector offers. \nIndustry executives say they are seeing willingness from the Trump team to take another look at export controls that limit exports of U.S. weapons. But in the short term, his tweets and comments on Boeing put defense contractors on notice. \n\"The chilling effect on industry is huge, if you are a contractor,\" said Franklin Turner, a partner specializing in government contracts at law firm McCarter & English. \nBoeing relies on the U.S. military and other arms of the federal government for a significant share of its defense, space and security business which is worth $30 billion a year. \nThe company clashed during the past year with Republicans in Congress over the Export-Import Bank, a federal program Boeing uses to finance sales to certain overseas customers. Boeing executives have also been outspoken supporters of the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal with Asia, which Trump opposed. \n(Additional reporting by Timothy Gardner, Emily Stephenson, Mike Stone, Susan Heavey, Andrea Shalal and Doina Chiacu in Washington; Ayesha Rascoe aboard Air Force One; Steve Holland, Alana Wise, Jeffrey Dastin, and Lewis Krauskopf in New York; Writing by Roberta Rampton; Editing by Frances Kerry and Alistair Bell) \n",

      "text": "View Comments A tweet from president-elect Donald Trump calling on the U.S. government to scrap an order with Boeing Co. for the development of a replacement for the Air Force One jet temporarily knocked about $1 billion US off the stock market value of the aircraft maker. Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 6, 2016 \"Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order!\" Trump tweeted Tuesday morning. \"The plane is totally out of control. I think it's ridiculous. I think Boeing is doing a little bit of a number. We want Boeing to make a lot of money but not that much money,\" Trump later told reporters when he spoke in the lobby of the Trump Tower in New York. Reuters reported that Boeing has not begun building the two replacement aircraft for the current Air Force One, and has not been awarded the money for them. The company is currently working on design and engineering for the aircraft. \"We are currently under contract for $170 million to help determine the capabilities of these complex military aircraft that serve the unique requirements of the president of the United States,\" Boeing said in a statement. It was not clear what Trump was using as the source for his claims about the cost of the planes. The White House also said it didn't know where Trump got his figure. \"Some of the statistics that have been cited, shall we say, don't appear to reflect the nature of the financial arrangement between Boeing and the Department of Defence,\" White House spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters. The Government Accountability Office, the U.S. government's auditing arm, in March 2016 estimated total program costs at more than $3.2 billion US between the 2010 and 2020 federal budget years. According to the Associated Press, U.S. military officials say two new aircraft could cost at least $4 billion US for development, construction and future maintenance, matching the figure Trump cited. The officials were not authorized to comment publicly about the sensitive military project and spoke on condition of anonymity. Boeing aircraft have been used to shuttle U.S. presidents since 1943. The new replacements for Air Force One are due to be in service by 2024. Illustrating the power of Trump's words, shares of Boeing opened sharply lower at the start of trading on the New York Stock Exchange on Tuesday. After finishing Monday at $152.16, the stock opened at $150.84 and got as low as $150.02, representing a drop in stock market value of about $1 billion US. Following the initial shock, Boeing's stock regained ground to finish the day at $152.64. In the wake of Trump's tweet, the Washington Post later reported that a Trump spokesman said the president-elect had sold all of his shares in companies earlier this year. Jay Miller didn't say why Trump had sold the shares or what he got for them. Selling his stock portfolio could solve an issue for Trump: concerns that his holdings could present potential conflicts of interest. -CBC ",

      "title": "Q&A: A look at Trump's call to cancel new Air Force One",
      "text": "WASHINGTON (AP) — President-elect Donald Trump suggested Tuesday that he would cancel Boeing's contract to build a new fleet of presidential aircraft to replace the aging models that shuttle the president around the world. He cited \"out of control\" costs of more than $4 billion in a tweet that ended with \"Cancel order!\"\nThe New York businessman, who flies on his own Boeing plane, later told reporters the cost to the government was \"ridiculous,\" though he appeared to be citing more than just the bare acquisition costs. Trump said he wanted the aircraft manufacturer to make money, \"but not that much.\"\nHere's a look at Trump's claims about Air Force One, one of the most recognized symbols of the American presidency.\nHOW MUCH WILL THE PROJECT COST?\nThe Government Accountability Office, the government's auditing arm, in March of this year estimated total program costs at more than $3.2 billion, much of it for research and development, through the 2020 federal budget year. Separately, Defense Department and Air Force officials put the cost for two new aircraft at around Trump's figure of $4 billion. That estimate includes the cost of research and development, construction and future maintenance, according to the officials who were not authorized to comment publicly about the sensitive military project and spoke on condition of anonymity.\nWHY DOES THE GOVERNMENT WANT NEW PLANES? DOESN'T THE CURRENT AIR FORCE ONE WORK JUST FINE?\nThat's true, but the two modified Boeing 747s the president uses for the bulk of his travels are getting older and breaking down more often, officials say. They were built in the 1980s and began flying in the early 1990s. One flew President Barack Obama to MacDill Air Force in Tampa, Florida, on Tuesday.\nThe distinctive blue-and-white plane with the U.S. flag on its tail and the presidential seal on its belly is basically a flying office for the president, complete with sophisticated communications, military and other capabilities. Safety of the president is paramount, and the government started the process to replace the aging aircraft with younger versions that incorporate updated capabilities and technological advances.\nAir Force One is unlike most aircraft. It can be refueled in the air and, with an unlimited range, can take the president wherever he needs to go. Its electrical systems are hardened to protect against an electromagnetic pulse, and the plane has advanced, secure communications equipment that will allow it to function as mobile command center in the event of an attack on the United States, according to the White House.\nThe president and most of those who fly with him enjoy 4,000 square feet of floor space on three levels, including a suite for the president with an office and a conference room. A medical suite can function as an operating room in an emergency, and a doctor is always on board. The plane has quarters for those who regularly accompany the president on trips, including White House staff, Secret Service agents, traveling journalists and other guests.\nWHAT IS BOEING'S ROLE?\nThe Air Force has spent about $170 million on three contracts to begin to identify the types of military and specialized systems that would have to be added to a commercial plane to adapt it for use by the president. Boeing has that contract, and also would build the replacement Air Force One.\nUnder the deal, the Air Force would buy the 747-8 aircraft, a newer version of those currently in use as Air Force One. The new aircraft wouldn't be ready until around 2023 or 2024, the end of Trump's second term, should he seek and win re-election.\nIn a statement, Boeing said it looks forward to working with the Air Force \"to deliver the best planes for the president at the best value for the American taxpayer.\"\nCOULD TRUMP ASK ANOTHER COMPANY TO BUILD THE NEW AIRCRAFT?\nIt's unclear. Trump did not elaborate, either on Twitter or during a brief appearance before reporters Tuesday. Presidents have flown on Boeing aircraft for more than seven decades and the Chicago-based company is the only American maker of these types of planes. Its closest rival would be French aircraft manufacturer Airbus.\nDIDN'T OBAMA CANCEL THE CONTRACT FOR A NEW PRESIDENTIAL HELICOPTER?\nWhite House press secretary Josh Earnest said Obama didn't scrap the project entirely, but ordered the military to restart it to bring the cost projections under control. The Marine One project was further along in the process than the Air Force One upgrade, and with costs much greater than originally expected.\nCAN TRUMP CANCEL THE PROJECT?\nYes, but not before he is sworn in to office on Jan. 20.\nAssociated Press writers Lolita C. Baldor in Washington, David Koenig in Dallas and Joseph Pisani in New York contributed to this report.",

      "title": "Trump Sold All of His Stocks in June, Spokesman Miller Says",
      "text": "Turns out, Donald Trump doesn't own stock in Boeing. Nor in Microsoft, or Ford, or Amazon, or AT&T, or any of several other companies whose policies may be affected by his future administration, and all of which he said he held as of a financial disclosure he made in May. He's gotten rid of all that stock, his spokesman Jason Miller said today. Sold it all in June, Miller said.\nMiller made the comment on a call with the press regarding Trump's morning tweet criticizing Boeing ( BA ) for overcharging the government on the sale of a new version of Air Force One. Miller later confirmed to the AP that he did indeed mean that Trump had sold not just his Boeing stock, but all of his stocks at that time. The AP asked for proof, and Miller declined to provide it.\nThe Trump transition team did not respond to requests for comment on the stock sales or to provide any evidence of it.\nThe announcement comes amid growing conflict-of-interest concerns regarding Trump's business endeavors that are not necessarily shared by the president-elect, his family or his business associates. In his May 2016 financial disclosure , the self-described billionaire listed millions of dollars in investments in dozens of publicly-traded companies across a wide range of industries, including banking, technology, energy and autos.\nTrump's camp has been rather coy regarding what will happen to his private business interests, including stock holdings, now that he has been elected. The Washington Post reported as recently as last week that a Trump spokeswoman did not respond to requests for comment for one of its stories on Trump's stock portfolio. Trump announced on Twitter in late November that he will discuss what will happen with the Trump Organization at a December 15 news conference. There is no indication he will divest of the company, and signs point to him holding control over to his children instead.\nTrump held positions in a number of companies about which he spoke frequently while campaigning and after his election. One such example is Apple ( AAPL ) , of which he previously held as much as $2.25 million in shares.\nOn the campaign trail, the real estate magnate was at times critical of the tech giant, claiming that as president he would get Apple to manufacture their \"damn computers\" in America and at one point floating the idea of boycotting the company until it helped the FBI break into the iPhone of one of the San Bernardino shooters.\nAfter his election, the president-elect told the New York Times he had been in touch with Apple CEO Tim Cook and asked him to get the company to \"build a big plant in the United States.\" He also said he told him his administration would be going after a \"very large tax cut for corporations.\" Trump has proposed dropping the corporate tax rate to 15%.\nTrump also told the Times that Microsoft ( MSFT ) founder Bill Gates had called him after the election. During a campaign speech in South Carolina a year ago , Trump said he would work on closing up parts of the Internet to fight terrorism by going to see Gates and \"a lot of different people that really understand what's happening.\" In his May filing, he listed up to $600,000 in Microsoft shares.\nHe disclosed a position in Amazon ( AMZN ) of up to $100,000. Trump frequently criticized the e-commerce company's CEO, Jeff Bezos.\nIn May, Trump contended Amazon has a \"huge antitrust problem\" and said the company is \"getting away with murder, tax-wise.\" He accused Bezos of using the Post, which he owns, to wield power over lawmakers to avoid taxes.\nHe disclosed holdings in Ford ( F ) as well, which he frequently criticized for outsourcing on the campaign trail. After his election, he falsely took credit for the company's decision to keep one of its plants in Kentucky.\nTrump listed holdings in companies about which his administration stands to make important decisions once he is in the White House.\nHe held shares of both AT&T ( T ) and Time Warner ( TWX ) , which announced an $85 billion merger in October that his Justice Department will oversee. Trump said he would seek to block the deal when it was first announced because it concentrated too much \"power in the hands of too few.\" However, he may have since changed his tune. The Financial Times reported last week that AT&T was encouraged by Trump's appointments of two former competition antitrust officials with a hands-off record on enforcement.\nHe listed holdings in Wells Fargo ( WFC ) as well, which earlier this year was flagged and fined by the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau for creating millions of phony accounts.\nTrump had also previously listed holdings in Energy Transfer Partners ( ETP ) , the owner of the $3.7 billion Dakota Access pipeline that has become a political flashpoint in recent months. A Trump spokeswoman confirmed in late November he had sold off his stake over the summer . Trump has been supportive of the project, a stance Miller reaffirmed on Monday .\nAlso in the Trump portfolio was IBM ( IBM ) , whose CEO, Ginni Rometty, reached out to Trump soon after his election in an open letter outlining areas for cooperation . She will now form part of a CEO advisory forum to Trump . And, he listed holdings of Goldman Sachs ( GS ) , where his Treasury Secretary nominee, Steve Mnuchin, was a former executive and his top adviser, Steve Bannon, worked as well.\nThis is not the first time Trump has said he bought and sold a significant number of stocks all at once.\nWhen he made his first personal finance disclosure in July 2015, soon after announcing his candidacy, he claimed to have sold 45 stocks in January 2014 for a gain of more than $27 million. He said he made only five losing picks: Coca-Cola ( KO ) , D.R. Horton ( DHI ) , Enbridge Inc. ( ENB ) , Occidental Petroleum ( OXY ) and PepsiCo ( PEP ) .\nThe Trump camp did not return request for comment on how much the president-elect made on his stock sales this time around.",

      "text": "Trump says cancel new Air Force One: Boeing costs 'totally out of control' by Associated Press & KOMO Staff \nPresident-elect Donald Trump .(AP Photo/ Evan Vucci) 3 photos A A \nNEW YORK - Six weeks from taking office, Donald Trump says he wants the government to cut some costs by canceling its order for a new Air Force One, the plane that carries presidents around the globe. \nThe government has contracted with Boeing to build two or more new planes, which would go into service around 2024. That means Trump wouldn't fly on the new planes unless he pursued and won a second term. But the Air Force has pressed for a faster schedule, saying the current planes are becoming too expensive to repair and keep in good flying shape. \nThe contract for the planes was to be about $3 billion, but costs have been reported to be rising. Trump tweeted early Tuesday, \"Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order!\" \nAsked later by reports to clarify, Trump said, \"Well, the plane is totally out of control. It's going to be over $4 billion for this Air Force One program, and I think it's ridiculous. I think Boeing is trying to do a little bit of a number. We want Boeing to make a lot of money, but not that much money.” \nThe General Accountability Office estimated in March that about $2 billion of the total - for work between 2010 and 2020 - was for research and development, not the actual planes. The inflated $4 billion figure Trump cited appears to include operation and maintenance as well. \nTrump began his Twitter onslaught against Boeing at 8:52 a.m., 22 minutes after The Chicago Tribune posted a story in which the Boeing CEO voiced concerns about Trump's views on trade. \nAsked for comment on Trump's statement, Boeing spokesman Todd Blecher said, \"We are going to have to get back to you after we figure out what's going on.\" \nThe aerospace giant, which manufactures the jumbo 747 planes in Everett, later issued a statement saying: \n\"We are currently under contract for $170 million to help determine the capabilities of this complex military aircraft that serves the unique requirements of the President of the United States. We look forward to working with the U.S. Air Force on subsequent phases of the program allowing us to deliver the best planes for the president at the best value for the American taxpayer.\" \nThe $170 million figure is just for a portion of the research and development efforts. \nThe Washington Post reported Tuesday that the plane hasn't been ordered, so there can't be cost overruns. But experts said $4 billion might be a reasonable estimate. \nHowever, the newspaper reported that Boeing doesn't expect to make money on Air Force One and that this is no off-the-shelf jet. \n\"Air Force One needs to be designed to survive a nuclear war. It requires all sorts of undisclosed security upgrades and countermeasures. It can refuel in flight. The actual cost of the plane will depend on the equipment that goes into it. There also needs to be extensive testing, probably lasting two years, before the plane is deemed ready for presidential travel.\" \nWashington Sens. Patty Murray and Maria Cantwell and U.S. Rep. Rick Larsen, who represents the Boeing Everett plant where the 747 is made, backed Boeing in a statement they released \n“Replacing the 26-year-old Air Force One aircraft will support good-paying jobs throughout Northwest Washington and is important to ensuring the safety and security of future presidents. The president-elect’s tweet does nothing to change those basic facts.” \nThe price of Boeing stock dipped after his comments but not drastically. Trump had tweeted in 2013 that he owned Boeing stock, but a spokesman said Tuesday he sold all of his stocks in June. \nRichard Aboulafia, an aviation analyst with the Washington D.C.-based Teal Group, said he doesn't believe that Air Force One costs are as high as Trump suggests. \n\"I think this is based on exactly nothing. He just felt like tweeting it, for whatever - grudge, or whatever purpose. But in terms of basis in reality, no, there's none,\" Aboulafia said. \nBut he admits President Trump would have the power to cancel the program. \n\"He does have the power to cancel it. It would be a baffling move,\" he said. \nTrump now uses his own plane, a Boeing 757, which he has outfitted with white leather and gold, a large flat-screen television and a bedroom. But as president it is expected that he would travel aboard the Air Force jet, which is equipped with special safety, defensive and communications equipment. Air Force One also has seating for reporters; Trump generally does not allow the press on his own plane. close ",

      "text": "Did Donald Trump tank Boeing’s stock because he was mad about a news article? TUESDAY, DEC. 6, 2016, 7:05 P.M. By Philip Bump Washington Post SMS Aide: Trump sold all stock \nIn 2013, Trump tweeted about having just bought stock in Boeing (“great company!”), but his spokesman said on Tuesday that the president-elect no longer holds stock in Boeing, or anything else, having sold it all in June. \nShares of stock in aircraft manufacturer Boeing fell nearly $2 a share before markets opened on Tuesday. \nThe reason? A tweet from the president-elect. \n“Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order!” \nWere Boeing to lose a $4 billion contract, that would certainly cause people to be skeptical of future earnings. But this, as seems always to be the case with Donald Trump tweets, is not the full story. \nAs the Washington Post’s Christian Davenport reports, the contract with Boeing is currently $170 million. The government’s plan to replace Air Force One actually involves two different planes which would serve future presidents for years to come. Boeing won the contract in 2015; the new planes are expected to be operational in about a decade. The $170 million isn’t for manufacturing, after all. It’s for Boeing’s work “determining the capabilities” of the planes they will eventually produce. \nIt was natural to wonder, given the apparently unprompted nature of Trump’s tweet, if part of his comment was meant to suggest he would prefer to use his existing aircraft for the job of the presidency. His campaign spent $6.7 million on his personal aircraft after he announced his candidacy, and he has called Air Force One “a step down” from his personal aircraft “in every way.” (Not size, mind you.) Once Trump received a Secret Service detail, the agency paid $1.6 million for its agents to travel with him – money that went to TAG Air, a company owned by Trump. \nTrump’s current plane is also a Boeing. \nThe Air Force wouldn’t let Trump keep using his plane as president, though, unless it were significantly upgraded. As CNN reported earlier this month, Trump’s personal plane would need to be upgraded with critical functionality to serve as his official aircraft. That includes missile detection and avoidance systems, electromagnetic shielding, midair refueling mechanisms and confidential communications systems. The cost of those upgrades would be up to Trump. \nAs it turns out, though, the Trump tweet may not have been unprompted. CNN’s Jake Tapper noted on Twitter that shortly before the tweet (which was posted at 8:52 a.m. Eastern) the Chicago Tribune posted an interview with the company’s CEO, Dennis Muilenberg. \n“Anyone who paid attention to the recent campaigns and the election results realizes that one of the overarching themes was apprehension about free and fair trade,” Muilenberg told the Tribune’s Robert Reed. Fair trade has helped Boeing, which prides itself on being America’s largest manufacturing exporter. \n“Last year, we delivered 495 737s from our factory in Renton, Wash., to customers around the world,” Muilenberg continued, noting that a third of the planes were sent to China. “This phenomenon would have been unimaginable when I started at the company in 1985.” \nThose are pointed comments. It was Trump, of course, who robustly criticized free trade during the general election. And it is Trump who, this week, seemed to threaten a trade war with China. \nThat story has a dateline of 7:30 Central time – 8:30 Eastern. Trump’s tweet came out a few minutes later. \nWe don’t know that Trump was responding to the Tribune story. We do know that the last time he tweeted an out-of-the-blue opinion, about flag-burning, it was immediately after a Fox News segment showing students burning flags. \nWe also know that Trump’s tweet tanked Boeing’s stock price, albeit only briefly. In 2013, Trump tweeted about having just bought stock in Boeing (“great company!”), but his spokesman said on Tuesday that the president-elect no longer holds stock in Boeing, or anything else, having sold it all in June. \nThe fluctuations in Boeing’s stock price that may have stemmed from Trump’s annoyance at a news article criticizing his policies in the lightest of terms, then, only affected other people.   7:05 p.m.",

      "text": "Trump wants to cancel Air Force One order from Boeing Posted: Updated: \nCNN Money — Donald Trump wants to cancel government plans to build two new Air Force One jets. \nThe president-elect said in a tweet Tuesday that the new Boeing 747 jet that's being built to carry \"future presidents\" already costs more than $4 billion, and that he wants to cancel the order. \n\"Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order!\" \nAsked by reporters Tuesday morning about the tweet, Trump responded, \"Well the plane is totally out of control. It's going to be over $4 billion for [the] Air Force One program,\" he said. \"And I think it's ridiculous. I think Boeing is doing a little bit of a number. We want Boeing to make a lot of money, but not that much money.\" \nTrump did not say why he believes the planes will cost \"more than $4 billion.\" Boeing says it currently has an Air Force One contract worth $170 million. \nA Boeing source familiar with the program told CNN that not even the company can estimate the cost of the program at this time, since \"the Pentagon has not even decided all the bells and whistles it wants on the new Air Force One.\" \nWithout knowing all the security features it is hard to estimate the cost, the source added, and the Air Force isn't even sure whether it wants two or three of the planes. \n\"We are not sure where he is getting that number from,\" said the Boeing official. \n\"The statistics that have been cited [by Trump], shall we say, don't appear to reflect the nature of the financial arrangement between Boeing and the Department of Defense,\" said Obama White House spokesman Josh Earnest. \nIn an official statement, Boeing said that its current contract allows it \"to help determine the capabilities of these complex military aircraft that serve the unique requirements of the President of the United States.\" \nThe company was caught completely off guard by Trump's comments and contacted the president-elect's team soon after his tweet, a Boeing official told CNN. \nSo far the Air Force has budgeted $2.9 billion through 2021 for two new Air Force Ones. They'll replace the aging pair of blue, white and polished aluminum 747-200Bs currently serving the President. \nThe new planes aren't expected to be ready to fly until 2022. The Air Force has already spent about $93 million preparing to build the new jets,according to Defense Department budget documents. That $93 million is included in Boeing's current contract. Manufacturing has yet to begin. \n\"We look forward to working with the U.S. Air Force on subsequent phases of the program allowing us to deliver the best planes for the President at the best value for the American taxpayer,\" said Boeing's statement. \nTrump's comment emphasizes that he's looking for ways to cut government costs where he can, according to his spokesman Jason Miller. \n\"The point that the President-elect was making here was that a $4 billion price tag is a very big number, the taxpayers want to make sure we're seeing absolute accountability and that the government is doing the best to drive costs down,\" he said. \nBut Earnest told reporters aboard Air Force One Tuesday that the planes need to be upgraded. \n\"This Air Force One that we're currently flying on is in great shape, thanks to the skilled professionalism of the men and women in the United States Air Force,\" Earnest said. \"It is, however, an aircraft that is nearing the end of its projected life.\" \nThe two Air Force One jets currently in use were ordered by President Reagan -- the interiors were selected by Nancy Reagan -- and were delivered in 1990 during George H.W. Bush's administration. Both are getting increasingly expensive to fly and maintain. \nThe Air Force has yet to place a formal order for the new planes. It has chosen the latest version of Boeing's jumbo jet, the 747-8, as the platform for the new Air Force One planes. The list price for a basic 747-8 is about $378.5 million. \nA team of engineers and aircraft machinists would then add state of the art communications, missile avoidance systems, inflight refueling, VIP interior and protections from the electromagnetic pulse of a nuclear blast. That takes years to do and adds hundreds of millions of dollars to the cost. \nBoeing builds the 747 at its factories in Washington state, and it currently has a large back order for its commercial jets, especially the 787 Dreamliner. Airlines regularly cancel orders for planes, although it would be a loss of both prestige as well as billions in revenue should the Air Force drop plans to build a new version of Air Force One. \nThe current planes have 4,000 square feet of interior floor space. The 747-8 is a longer and more spacious version of the current version, and features four General Electric engines. Those expand its range by 1,000 miles thanks to considerably better fuel economy than the 1970s-era engines used on the current Air Force Ones. \nBoeing's first presidential plane was used by Franklin Roosevelt back in 1943, and it has made every Air Force One since President John Kennedy. \nBoeing is the nation's largest exporter. But it has recently been criticized by Trump for both its deal to sell commercial jets to Iran and its decision to open a factory in China to finish passenger cabins on planes purchased by Chinese airlines. \nRecently retired Boeing CEO Jim McNerney was named just last week to an all-star team of corporate executives who will advise Trump on jobs and the economy. \nShares of Boeing were slightly lower after Trump's comment. \nTrump held between $50,000 to $100,000 worth of Boeing stock, according to a financial disclosure from June of this year. But Trump spokesman Miller said Tuesday that he sold all his publicly-traded stock that same month. \nIn January of 2013, when the Boeing 787 Dreamliner was grounded by problems with its batteries, Trump tweeted that he had bought just bought stock in Boeing at depressed prices, calling it a \"great company!\" \n-- CNN's Kevin Liptak and Jeff Zeleny contributed to this story \nThe-CNN-Wire™&© 2016 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

      "text": "Boeing Says Trump Wrong On Air Force One 4 hours ago share \n(Chicago, IL) -- Chicago-based Boeing is fighting back against President-elect Donald Trump's Twitter proclamation today that the contract for a new 747 Air Force One plane should be cancelled because costs are out of control. Boeing replied that the current contract is actually for 170-million-dollars to evaluate and design the new generation of a flying White House and command center, not the four-billion-dollars production contract Trump complained about. The current plane is nearing the end of its 25-year lifespan and the two copies of the new plane were expected to be delivered in 2023. #TrendingTracks ",

      "title": "Trump on Boeing's Air Force One contract: 'Cancel order!'",
      "text": "Article Attribution and Read More at: Article Source By Andrea Shalal and Amy Tennery WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) – U.S. President-elect Donald Trump urged the government on Tuesday to cancel an order with Boeing Co for a revamped Air Force One – one of the most prominent symbols of the U.S. presidency – saying costs were out of control. It was the latest example of Trump using his podium, often via Twitter messages, to rattle companies and foreign countries as he seeks to shake up business as usual in Washington. Trump, who takes office on Jan. 20, took aim at what he called cost overruns even though the plane is only in development stages. “Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order!” Trump said on Twitter. It was not immediately clear what prompted the timing of his complaint. Trump, who has vowed to use his skills as a businessman to make good deals that benefit American taxpayers, then made a surprise appearance in the lobby of Trump Tower in New York, where he amplified his comments. “The plane is totally out of control. I think it’s ridiculous. I think Boeing is doing a little bit of a number. We want Boeing to make a lot of money but not that much money,” he told reporters. Boeing, which has built planes for U.S. presidents since 1943, has not yet begun building the two replacements for the current Air Force One planes, which are scheduled to be in service by 2024. Boeing has not yet been awarded the money to build the proposed replacements. “We are currently under contract for $170 million to help determine the capabilities of these complex military aircraft that serve the unique requirements of the President of the United States,” the company said in a statement. Boeing Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg called Trump after his remarks and they had a constructive dialogue, sources familiar with the conversation told Reuters. Muilenburg told Trump the cost of the airplane could be lowered if the U.S. Air Force changed its requirements and the issue would likely be resolved without a major dispute, the sources said. NOT A ‘VANILLA’ JUMBO JET The Air Force, which operates the presidential planes, announced in January 2015 that Boeing’s 747-8 would be used to replace the two current presidential planes. The planes can fly direct from Washington to Hong Kong, 1,000 miles (1,600 km) farther than the current Air Force One. They are designed to be an airborne White House able to fly in worst-case security scenarios, such as nuclear war. President Barack Obama, who flew on the aging Air Force One to Tampa, Florida, on Tuesday, has called the plane one of the best perks of the presidency. His spokesman, Josh Earnest, told reporters on board that the contracting arrangements for replacements were “rather complicated” and said the recommendations for upgrades had been made by national security experts. The budgeted costs for the replacement program are $2.87 billion for the fiscal years 2015 through 2021, just on research and development, testing and evaluation, according to budget documents seen by Reuters. The current Air Force plan envisions extensive modifications to a Boeing 747-8 plane, adding military avionics and advanced communications to a self-defense system. “Of course it’s not like buying a vanilla Boeing jumbo jet,” said defense consultant Loren Thompson, who has close ties to Boeing and other companies. A March 2016 report from the Government Accountability Office, the investigative arm of Congress, estimated the cost of the overall program at $3.21 billion, including the purchase of two aircraft. But the GAO estimated the costs for research and development would be lower, at just under $2 billion. If the GAO report used the same Air Force estimate for research and development, then its estimate would be around $4 billion. Boeing shares dipped after Trump’s tweet but closed up 0.1 percent at $152.24. LATEST BROADSIDE Trump’s broadside against Boeing comes as Washington’s business lobbyists are bracing for a wild ride. A New York real estate developer, Trump took aim at big corporations during his campaign, saying that they often harmed ordinary Americans by sending jobs abroad. Since winning the Nov. 8 election, he has taken credit for pushing United Technologies Corp and Ford Motor Co to backtrack on outsourcing plans. Trump’s attack on Boeing was the main topic of discussion at the annual luncheon of the Aerospace Industries Association, where the group’s chief executive, Dave Melcher, urged the new administration to promote trade and bolster the high-paying manufacturing jobs that the $143 billion-a-year sector offers. Industry executives say they are seeing willingness from the Trump team to take another look at export controls that limit exports of U.S. weapons. But in the short term, his tweets and comments on Boeing put defense contractors on notice. “The chilling effect on industry is huge, if you are a contractor,” said Franklin Turner, a partner specializing in government contracts at law firm McCarter & English. Boeing relies on the U.S. military and other arms of the federal government for a significant share of its defense, space and security business which is worth $30 billion a year. The company clashed during the past year with Republicans in Congress over the Export-Import Bank, a federal program Boeing uses to finance sales to certain overseas customers. Boeing executives have also been outspoken supporters of the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal with Asia, which Trump opposed.

      "text": "Trump calls for canceling Boeing's Air Force One contract in morning tweet \nby: Barrie Barber, Dayton Daily News Updated: Dec 6, 2016 - 1:01 PM President-elect Donald Trump slammed the cost of a new Air Force One and used Twitter to call for canceling the new aircraft fleet Tuesday, raising questions about the future of the program managed at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base. >> Read more trending stories In a tweet sent at 8:52 a.m., the president-elect wrote: \"Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order!\" Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 6, 2016 Boeing spokesman Todd Blecher declined comment and referred all questions to the Air Force, which did not immediately release a response. The Air Force is planning to replace two aging Boeing 747-200s that serve as Air Force One when the president is aboard with two newer and highly modified Boeing 747-8 airliners. The jets were expected to join the fleet by 2024, replacing a current fleet that will be more than three decades old at the time. A program official at Wright-Patterson has said the White House has urgently asked for the jets because of reliability concerns as the planes age, among other concerns. Richard Aboulafia, a senior aviation analyst with the Virginia-based Teal Group, said in an email the tweet was \"complete nonsense. But making program management and military requirements decisions via tweet is just very wrong.\" In an interview, he said the president-elect's position on the Air Force One replacement was \"very concerning.\" \"This is not from the standpoint of the contract, but just from deeper lack of understanding for what the president does,\" he said. \"It's very important for the president to travel, visit other places in the country, and other countries and be able to manage national emergencies while he travels. You can't do that without Air Force One. \"Now the alternative is he thinks a 50-year-old Air Force One will do the job,\" Aboulafia said. \"Hopefully, nobody can be that completely misinformed.\" A message seeking comment was sent to Trump spokespersons this morning. Todd Harrison, director of the aerospace project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, D.C., said it's a tradition for an outgoing president to request a new Air Force One \"so that it would not be seen as being for personal benefit.\" President George H.W. Bush's administration OK'd the purchase of the current fleet, he noted. \"If Trump cancels the program now, it could be another eight years before a new replacement program is started, so that aircraft would be pushing 40 years old by then,\" Harrison wrote. The production of the iconic Boeing 747 jumbo jet could come to an end \"so it's not clear that the Air Force would be able to buy a commercial derivative plane like the 747 from a U.S. company in the future.\" Neither Boeing nor the Air Force has released the latest figures on the program. Aboulafia said the more than $4 billion Trump cited was \"about right over 10 years.\" \"It's incredibly expensive to be able to manage a country and fight a war from the air, and build two planes that can do that,\" he said. But he rejected the claim the costs were \"out of control.\" Loren B. Thompson, a senior defense analyst at the Virginia-based Lexington Institute and a defense industry consultant, said in an email the president-elect \"probably overstates\" the cost of the two new jets. \"Boeing thinks the program will cost less, but it is hard to say precisely how much because the Air Force hasn't finalized the requirements for the program. \"This is a plane that might need to remain airborne for days during a nuclear war,\" Thompson wrote. \"It must be able to carry out functions no other plane in the world would need to accomplish.\" The jet's cost is driven by its mission with self-protection measures such as shielding against electromagnetic pulse in a nuclear explosion and specialized communication gear to command a nuclear strike \"which is why it is so much more expensive than the planes Trump is used to buying,\" Harrison wrote. The National Museum of the U.S. Air Force hopes to land one of the current Air Force Ones when the plane was expected to be retired in the next decade to add to its collection of 10 presidential aircraft.

      "text": "President-elect Donald Trump’s bold gesture last week of persuading Indianapolis-based Carrier Corporation to cancel plans to shift about 800 jobs to Mexico – and his threat to punish other companies contemplating similar moves -- has been met with widespread voter approval.\nThe hard-nosed New York real estate magnate signaled last week that he intends to use his formidable bargaining skills to bend U.S. industry to his will in pursuit of his “America First” agenda of preserving manufacturing jobs at home while imposing protective tariffs and tearing up international trade deals.\nRelated: Carrier Gets State Incentives, Trump Pledge for Keeping U.S. Jobs\n“Companies are not going to leave the United States anymore without consequences,” Trump said during a tour of the Indianapolis furnace plant last Thursday that employs more than 1,100 workers. “Not gonna happen. It’s not gonna happen.”\nA new Morning Consult/Politico survey released on Tuesday found that six out of ten voters across the political spectrum view Trump in a more favorable light following his efforts to persuade Carrier officials to keep those jobs in this country. Even among those who supported Democrat Hillary Clinton for president, 32 percent said the deal in which Carrier would receive $7 million in tax incentives from the state and assurances of major federal tax relief improved their view of Trump.\nNow the president-elect appears to have his eyes on much bigger fish.\nTrump on Tuesday called for the federal government to cancel a deal with Boeing, the premier aircraft manufacturer, for the development of a new generation of Air Force One, insisting that the multi-billion-dollar contract is far too costly. The Air Force signed agreements with Boeing in January and July to design and develop aspects of the new presidential aircraft, including its interior and electrical and power systems, according to USA Today . While only a small fraction of the total cost has been accounted for so far in the procurement process, the entire program likely will cost about $3.2 billion through fiscal 2020, the U.S. Government Accountability Office estimated in March.\nRelated: The Pentagon Wasted $125 Billion and Buried the Evidence\nHowever, without explaining how he came up with his figure, Trump insisted today that the real cost would be $4 billion and that as far as he was concerned that was out of the question. He tweeted:\nBoeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order!\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 6, 2016 “Well, the plane is totally out of control,” Trump later told reporters who were camped out in the lobby of Trump Tower in New York. “It’s gonna be over $4 billion for the Air Force One program, and I think it’s ridiculous. I think Boeing is doing a little bit of a number. We want Boeing to make a lot of money, but not that much.”\nTrump’s pronouncement clearly caught the Pentagon and Air Force by surprise, and the government had no immediate response. Boeing was first awarded the contract in January 2015 with virtually no competition, according to The Washington Post . That’s because Boeing’s 747-8 was the only plane manufactured in the U.S. that could meet the stringent national security and safety standards for a plane to carry the president, his family and top aides and guests around the world. The current Air Force One will be 30 years old next year and is slated to be replaced by 2020 at the earliest.\nTodd Blecher, a spokesperson for Boeing, issued a statement saying that the company was currently under contract for $170 million “to help determine the capabilities of these complex military aircraft that serve the unique requirements of the President of the United States.” He added, “We look forward to working with the U.S. Air Force on subsequent phases of the program allowing us to deliver the best planes for the President at the best value for the American taxpayer.”\nRelated: The Pentagon Wasted $125 Billion and Buried the Evidence\nTrump, the master dealmaker who made billions of dollars in business ventures worldwide by keeping his rivals and contractors off balance, appears to be applying his same tactics as a successful CEO in trying to run roughshod over government bureaucrats and private contractors. In a conference call with reporters today, Trump spokesperson Jason Miller said that the president-elect intends to closely examine the Defense Department’s budget in search of potential big savings.\n“I think this really speaks to the President-elect’s focus on keeping costs down across the board with regard to government spending,” Miller said. “I think people are really frustrated with some of the big price tags that are coming out for programs, even in addition to this one. So we’re going to look for areas.”\nTrump’s concern about runaway defense spending and waste is clearly justified. The Pentagon has routinely been hit with criticism of massive waste and cost overruns, as in the case of the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program. The Washington Post reported today that the Pentagon had “buried” an internal audit that revealed $125 billion of administrative waste for fear that Congress would retaliate with cuts in its budget.\nHowever, Trump may be signaling far bigger concerns about Boeing than simply what he is portraying as excessive spending on the next generation of Air Force One planes. The Obama administration reportedly is negotiating a deal with India that would allow Boeing and Lockheed Martin to build U.S. combat aircraft in India that would replace that country’s aging fleet of mostly Russian-built aircraft.\nRelated: Pentagon’s Sloppy Bookkeeping Means $6.5 Trillion Can’t Pass an Audit\nUnder that arrangement, Lockheed Martin and Boeing would outsource manufacturing of the F-16 Fighting Falcon and the F/A-18 Super Hornet to India to substantially save labor costs. In both cases, the aviation contractors would be building production plants in India, according to The Post . Indeed, Lockheed Martin is proposing to shift its entire F-16 assembly line from Texas to India, “making India the sole producer of the single-engine combat aircraft,” the newspaper reported.\nIt wouldn’t be surprising if Trump – with his sharp focus on keeping U.S. jobs at home and bringing others back from overseas -- might have a different idea once he takes office Jan. 20. Although the president-elect made no mention about the brewing deal with India, which was first reported late yesterday. He may have decided to yank Boeing’s chain over the Air Force One contract to give company executives fair warning of a much bigger confrontation to come over their efforts to export manufacturing jobs.\nOr, he may have been vexed by a speech delivered by Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg to a group of Illinois manufacturers last Friday that suggested that Trump and his allies temper their rhetoric about trade policy, as the Chicago Tribune noted today . \"Anyone who paid attention to the recent campaigns and the election results realizes that one of the overarching themes was apprehension about free and fair trade,\" he said, without specifically mentioning Trump by name.\nAfterward, Muilenburg told reporters that “Free and fair global trade is important, and it definitely creates U.S. manufacturing jobs. We want to make sure that doesn’t get lost in the political rhetoric,” he added.\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:\nThe Campaign Promise Congress Won’t Let Trump Keep 8 Big Changes Under Tom Price’s Obamacare Replacement Plan Yellen Sends a Message to Trump: Hands Off Dodd-Frank",

      "text": "Trump stuns Boeing; China exchange controls; May’s Brexit plan President-elect says ‘$4bn’ price tag means Air Force One contract should be cancelled by: Neil Munshi , Siona Jenkins and Mercedes Ruehl \nSign up to receive FirstFT by email here \nDonald Trump has called for a Boeing contract to build the Air Force One aircraft that carries the US president to be cancelled. He cited “out of control” costs, in a fresh example of the president-elect using his bully pulpit to pressure American companies . \n“Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4bn. Cancel order!” Mr Trump tweeted on Tuesday. Some journalists noted that the tweet came 22 minutes after the Chicago Tribune published a story that suggests that Dennis Muilenburg, Boeing chief executive, was mildly critical of the Trump team’s anti-trade rhetoric. \nBoeing did not address the tweet directly. But the company said it was under contract for $170m to “help determine the capabilities of these complex military aircraft that serve the unique requirements of the president”. \nThe news comes the day after publication of a blockbuster investigation that revealed that the Pentagon tried to bury an internal study that exposed $125bn in administrative waste in its business operations. (FT, Twitter, Chicago Tribune, WaPo) In the news \nEU companies hit by new Chinese exchange controls The EU Chamber of Commerce in Beijing said payment difficulties experienced by EU companies — which were unable to remit dividends abroad following a new complicated approval process for making payments out of China — were “ disruptive to business operations ”. (FT) \nTheresa May agrees to set out Brexit strategy before Article 50 The UK prime minister bowed to pressure on Tuesday to set out her Brexit plans before triggering the Article 50 exit clause next year, as the EU’s chief negotiator Michel Barnier set an October 2018 deadline for completing exit talks . \nTrump claims SoftBank deal President-elect took to Twitter again on Tuesday to say Japan’s SoftBank plans to invest $50bn in the US in a move that would create 50,000 jobs. The large telecom and technology group had already been plotting a $100bn fund that plans to invest in technology groups globally, along with Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund. It was not immediately clear whether SoftBank’s investment would be related to that endeavour or a new one. (FT) \nSecretary of state candidate with Putin ties Donald Trump met Rex Tillerson, the ExxonMobil chief executive, on Tuesday to discuss him becoming the next US secretary of state. The oil man is a seasoned deal-maker with close ties to a man close to Mr Trump’s heart, Vladimir Putin, and other world leaders, which could redefine US interests abroad . (WSJ) \nAngela Merkel calls for burqa ban German chancellor calls for a ban on the full Islamic veil in a hardening of her approach to integration by immigrants as she seeks to win over critics of her refugee policies before next year’s parliamentary elections. (FT) \nJapan rolls the dice Topyo took a step toward legalising casinos, fulfilling an ambition of prime minister Shinzo Abe and firing the starting gun on a race to control a potential $40bn gaming industry . (FT) \nShinzo Abe’s Pearl Harbour boost Japanese prime minister is expecting a boost in approval ratings after making a historic trip to Pearl Harbour with Barack Obama later this month. If all goes according to plan, he would probably call a snap election in January. (NAR) \nGoogle’s climate change fight Google plans to buy enough renewable energy next year to match the entire needs of all its data centres and offices around the world, in one of the biggest gestures by a private company to combat climate change. (FT) It's a big day for \nHSBC, JPMorgan and Crédit Agricole Brussels will hit the three banks with multimillion-euro fines for rigging the Euribor interest rate benchmark, closing a five-year cartel probe into a scandal that shook the financial world. (FT) \nKeep up with the important business, economic and political stories in the coming days with the FT’s WeekAhead . Food for thought \nIs Trump using Taiwan as a China bargaining chip? Was the president-elect’s phone call a show of ignorance, crazy like a fox or something in between ? The call was brokered by the law firm of former Senator Bob Dole, which was paid $20,000 a month by Taipei to advance its interests in Washington. (FT, BuzzFeed) \nThe Asian credit binge is leaving companies exposed According to a JPMorgan report, the ratio of private non-financial debt to GDP in emerging markets, excluding China, now exceeds the peak level of developed market debt around the time of the global financial crisis: about 175 per cent. But that credit binge looks problematic in the wake of Donald Trump’s election, which has boosted both the dollar and expectations that the Fed will soon raise US interest rates. (FT) \n‘Just walk out’ Amazon is looking to eliminate the checkout in real-world supermarkets with the opening of its first physical grocery store early next year. The Seattle-based company said stores would use the same technology as driverless cars to determine which products were placed in a bag. (FT) \nThe trouble with texting Predictive text is forcing us to confront some uncomfortable truths about our personalities. (Quartz) \nThe Amazon of drug trafficking How a mail-order opioid operation took root on the high plains of Texas. (Stat) Video of the day \nFuture energy in Scottish mountains Mure Dickie visits a pumped-storage hydroelectric site in Scotland to see how it can act like a battery for renewable energy .

      "text": "Email \nNEW YORK — Donald Trump wants to cancel government plans to build two new Air Force One jets. \nThe president-elect said in a tweet Tuesday that the new Boeing 747 jet that’s being built to carry “future presidents” already costs more than $4 billion, and that he wants to cancel the order. \n“Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order!” \nAsked by reporters Tuesday morning about the tweet, he responded, “Well the plane is totally out of control. It’s going to be over $4 billion for [the] Air Force One program,” he said. “And I think it’s ridiculous. I think Boeing is doing a little bit of a number. We want Boeing to make a lot of money, but not that much money.” Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order! \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 6, 2016 \nTrump did not say why he believes the planes will cost “more than $4 billion.” Boeing says currently has an Air Force Once contract worth $170 million. \nA Boeing source familiar with the program told CNN that not even the company can estimate the cost of the program at this time since “the Pentagon has not even decided all the bells and whistles they want on the new Air Force One.” \nWithout knowing all the security features it is hard to give an estimated cost, the source added, and the Air Force isn’t even sure whether it wants two or three of the planes. \n“We are not sure where he is getting that number from,” said the Boeing official. \nIn an official statement, Boeing that its current contract allows it “to help determine the capabilities of these complex military aircraft that serve the unique requirements of the President of the United States.” \nSo far the Air Force has budgeted $2.9 billion through 2021 for two new Air Force Ones, which will replace the aging pair of blue, white and polished aluminum 747-200Bs serving the President. \nThe new planes aren’t expected to be ready to fly until 2022. The Air Force has already spent about $93 million preparing to build the new jets, according to Defense Department budget documents. That $93 million is included in Boeing’s current contract. Manufacturing has yet to begin. \n“We look forward to working with the U.S. Air Force on subsequent phases of the program allowing us to deliver the best planes for the President at the best value for the American taxpayer,” said Boeing’s statement. \nThe Air Force has yet to place a formal order for the new planes. It has chosen the latest version of Boeing’s jumbo jet, the 747-8, as the platform for the new Air Force One planes. Building the basic planes would take about two years. A team of engineers and aircraft machinists would then add state of the art communications, missile avoidance systems, inflight refueling, VIP interior and protections from the electromagnetic pulse of a nuclear blast. That takes years to do. \nBoeing builds the 747 at its factories in Washington state, and it currently has a large back order for its commercial jets, especially the 787 Dreamliner. And airlines regularly cancel orders for planes, although it would be a loss of both prestige and revenue should the Air Force drop plans to build two new Air Force Ones. \nThe current planes have 4,000 square feet of interior floor space. The 747-8 can travel an additional 1,000 miles without refueling, fly faster with a heavier maximum takeoff weight and get better fuel economy than the 747-200 that’s used for the current Air Force Ones. \nBoeing is the nation’s largest exporter. But it has recently been criticized by Trump for both its deal to sell commercial jets to Iran and its decision to open a factory in China to finish passenger cabins on planes purchased by Chinese airlines. \nIt did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Recently retired Boeing CEO Jim McNerney was named just last week to an all-star team of corporate executives who will advise Trump on jobs and the economy. \nShares of Boeing were slightly lower after Trump’s comment. 47.978985 -122.202079 ",

      "text": "By Jon Hecht 6 hours ago \nOf the many, many, many ways that Donald Trump's presidency is shaping up to be the complete opposite of Barack Obama's, perhaps the clearest is in their speaking styles. The 44th president is known for his cautious, deliberate style; Obama was compared to Dr. Spock by the New York Times ' Maureen Dowd early in his presidency, and it stuck. Trump, on the other hand is boisterous and speaks his mind, even when what he says is inaccurate or is alienates many Americans and allies . \nMillions of Americans chose Trump's no-filter style, but as he approaches actually becoming president, I'm beginning to see what it could mean for a president to be as carefree as Trump about what he says. \nAt 8:52 on Tuesday morning , like many other mornings, Trump tweeted: \"Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order!\" \nWithin minutes, Boeing's stock plunged , losing more than $2 a share before the market opened Trump spoke to reporters in Trump tower about his tweet, saying, \"We want Boeing to make a lot of money but not that much money.\" [Embed] \nOver the course of the day, further reporting revealed that the $4 billion Trump asserted as the cost for taxpayers was hugely inflated — the actual contract that Boeing has for Air Force One is $170 million. The stock eventually returned to normal trading. [Twitter Embed: https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/806134244384899072] \nCNN's Jake Tapper pointed to a possible reason for Trump's inaccurate outburst: a Chicago Tribune interview with Boeing's CEO, Dennie Muilenberg, that was posted Tuesday morning included subtle digs at Trump's trade proposals and the potential of trade war with China: \"Last year, we delivered 495 737s from our factory in Renton, Wash., to customers around the world. One in every 3 of those 737s were bound for China.\" [Twitter Embed: https://twitter.com/jaketapper/status/806192671891083264] \nBut let's give Trump the most charitable benefit of the doubt. Perhaps he, working on a brief slip of mistaken information, really did feel that Boeing was poised to make too much money off the American taxpayer and proposed paying less via Twitter, only finding out later his numbers were off. \nWell that was a pretty powerful slip of the tongue and finger. It affected millions of dollars for investors, and turned out to be wrong. [Twitter Embed: https://twitter.com/melissayeagr/status/806171069044420608] [Twitter Embed: https://twitter.com/Max_Fisher/status/806225598674771968] \nDuring the election, Trump often got in trouble for running his mouth, but in the end, it wasn't enough to sink his presidency, perhaps due to his opponent being the preternaturally cautious Hillary Clinton. But now that he's soon to become the single person on the planet whose word has the biggest impact, the reality of Trump speaking his mind could be coming fast. \nThe Boeing tweet and subsequent answer to questions is a small-bore example of one company not facing acute economic pain. But what happens when Trump speaks (or tweets) this carelessly in a crisis? Back in 2009, in the midst of the financial crisis, Obama's Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner sent stocks cratering after a speech and press conference about the administration's response went badly for the new cabinet official. Let's hope that we don't have to rely on careful parsing of Trump's language to get us through a similar moment. Must Reads ",

      "title": "Trump Says Boeing's Contract To Build Air Force One Should Be Canceled",
      "text": "World | ÂŠ 2016 The Washington Post | Christian Davenport, The Washington Post | Updated:  10 IST EMAIL PRINT COMMENTS US President-elect Donald Trump belived, $4 billion for the Air Force One program is ridiculous. (AFP) President-elect Donald Trump on Tuesday took aim at one of the preeminent symbols of presidential power, saying on Twitter that the amount the Pentagon plans to spend on a new Air Force One is far too much and that the contract with Boeing should be killed.\"Cancel the order!\" he tweeted.Speaking to reporters later in the lobby of New York's Trump Tower, he said the effort to build the plane \"is totally out of control. It's going to be over $4 billion for the Air Force One program, and I think that's ridiculous. I think Boeing is doing a little bit of a number. We want Boeing to make a lot of money, but not that much money.\"The tweet and comments are further evidence that as president, Trump intends to use the power of the office to intervene in individual programs, policy decisions and the actions of companies. And it comes just a week after he pushed Carrier to give up plans to shift jobs from Indiana to Mexico. Boeing, by contrast, would build Air Force One in the United States, and canceling the program could cost U.S. jobs.During his campaign, Trump has repeatedly said he wants to strengthen the nation's military by expanding the size of the Army and the Marine Corps and buy new equipment, from Navy ships to upgrading the nuclear arsenal - promises that Mackenzie Eaglen, a defense analyst at the American Enterprise Institute calculated could cost at least an additional $55 billion.But Trump has also pledged to eliminate wasteful spending, and clamp down on costly programs that have gone over budget or lag behind schedule. His tweet comes as the Pentagon is facing scrutiny after The Washington Post reported that the Pentagon buried an internal study that found $125 billion in bureaucratic waste for fear that Congress would slash its budget.In a call with reporters, Trump spokesman Jason Miller said Trump plans to closely examine the Pentagon's budget and look for areas where he can find savings.\"I think this really speaks to the president-elect's focus on keeping costs down across the board with regard to government spending,\" he said. \"I think people are really frustrated with some of the big price tags that are coming out for programs, even in addition to this one. So we're going to look for areas where we can keep costs down and look for ways where we can save money.\"The Air Force hasn't released a total dollar amount for the program. The program includes two aircraft and is still in the development stages. So far the Air Force has budgeted $2.7 billion for the program. But that's for research, development and testing - not manufacturing. And the Air Force expects \"this number to change as the program matures with the completion of risk reduction activities,\" the Air Force said in a statement.The real cost could grow to $4 billion, according to an analysis by Todd Harrison, a defense analyst with the Center for Strategic and International Studies. The aircraft are projected to be operational by the mid-2020s, officials said.That price tag was justified because of the enormous capabilities of the planes, he said. The plane, which flies under the call sign \"Air Force One\" when the president is on board, is a \"flying command post,\" Harrison said. \"In the event of a nuclear attack, this is where the military will keep the president safe.\"Richard Aboulafia, an aerospace analyst with the Teal Group, said the \"capabilities of this plane were there for everyone to see on 9/11\" when Bush was whisked aboard Air Force One and responded to the crisis from there.In a statement, Boeing said it is under contract only for $170 million for work \"to help determine the capabilities of this complex military aircraft that serves the unique requirements of the President of the United States. We look forward to working with the U.S. Air Force on subsequent phases of the program allowing us to deliver the best plane for the president at the best value for the American taxpayer.\"The company wouldn't be eligible for the more-lucrative manufacturing contracts until after the development is completed.When the Air Force selected Boeing, it was the only U.S. manufacturer that could build such an aircraft. The other would be European-based Airbus.\"We don't know what it will ultimately cost, but if President-elect Trump is suggesting we give this work to Airbus, that's not good for American jobs,\" said Sen. Richard Durbin, a Democrat from Illinois, where Boeing is based.While it is Congress that controls the nation's purse, Trump could have enormous influence over the Air Force One program. He could pick an Air Force secretary who, like him, wants to rein in costs, or go in an entirely different direction.That's what Obama did shortly after taking office in 2009. At the time, Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., took aim at the fleet of presidential helicopters, saying, \"I don't think that there's any more graphic demonstration of how good ideas have cost taxpayers an enormous amount of money.\"Obama, then just a few weeks in office, said the fleet, generally known as Marine One, was \"an example of the procurement process gone amok.\" That led defense officials to kill the program outright and then restart the procurement process.But by then, the helicopter program was well underway and did have significant problems. The Air Force One program is at a much different stage.\"It's still very, very early,\" Harrison said. \"It hasn't had a chance to have any cost overruns yet.\"He said it was curious that Trump would single out Air Force One when there are so many other defense programs that have gone wildly over budget and behind schedule.This isn't the first time Trump has highlighted the costs of Air Force One. In July, he objected to the use of the plane for campaign events. \"Taxpayers are paying a fortune for the use of Air Force One on the campaign trail by President Obama and Crooked Hillary,\" he tweeted. \"A total disgrace!\"He brought it up again at a rally in North Carolina in July. \"Now Air Force One is a very old Boeing 747,\" Trump said. \"It sucks up a lot of gas. A lot of fuel. Boy, the fuel bill. You turn on those engines, I can tell you, it's a lot of money.\"Boeing could be in a difficult negotiating position. In addition to his concerns about the plane's costs, Trump has vowed to rewrite trade agreements with China, which could have a huge affect on the company.During a recent talk, Dennis Muilenburg, Boeing's chief executive, said a third of the 737s it built for customers across the globe went to China, according to the Chicago Tribune.\"I'm not a political pundit or prognosticator - we have too many of those - but anyone who paid attention to the recent campaigns and the election results realizes that one of the overarching themes was apprehension about free and fair trade,\" he said, according to the newspaper.An Air Force official, not authorized to speak publicly about the Air Force One program, said that the current presidential plane will be 30 years old next year, and the new ones aren't slated to come online until the mid-2020s. By then the technology aboard the current plane will be dated, and it will become increasingly hard to maintain. Any delays to replace it could cause significant problems, the official said.Boeing was selected as the manufacturer in January 2015, but it wasn't much of a competition. Boeing's 747-8 was the only plane made in the United States that could meet the requirements for the presidential aircraft while also being \"consistent with the national public interest,\" Air Force Secretary Deborah Lee James said in a statement at the time.She said the Pentagon \"will insist upon program affordability through cost-conscious procurement practices.\"Trump accuses Boeing of 'doing a little bit of a number' with new Air Force One:--- (Jenna Johnson contributed to this report.)

      "text": "Trump slams Boeing deal for new Air Force One Advertisement President-elect Donald Trump on Tuesday called for the government to cancel a deal with aircraft manufacturer Boeing for development of the next generation of Air Force One, citing concerns about cost overruns. The Air Force signed deals with Boeing in January and July to design certain aspects of the new presidential aircraft, including its interior, electrical and power system, and maintenance systems. The U.S. Government Accountability Office estimated in March that the entire program would cost about $3.2 billion from the 2010 through 2020 fiscal years, including $2 billion for research and development. Trump cited different numbers without providing the basis for them. The military has not yet awarded a contract to actually assemble the planes. \"Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order!\" he tweeted Tuesday morning. Shortly after his tweet, he told reporters at Trump Tower: \"The plane is totally out of control. It’s going to be over $4 billion for Air Force One program and I think it’s ridiculous. I think Boeing is doing a little bit of a number. We want Boeing to make a lot of money  ",

      "text": "Trump says cancel new Air Force One: Costs 'out of control;' Boeing responds by JONATHAN LEMIRE, Associated Press and Sinclair Broadcast Group \nFILE - In this Monday, Nov. 7, 2016, file photo, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump arrives to speak to a campaign rally in Raleigh, N.C. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci, File) A A MORE VIDEO Sen. Maria Cantwell, D-Wash., on Boeing, Air Force One \nNEW YORK (AP/ SBG ) — The government should cancel its multibillion-dollar order for new Air Force One presidential planes, Donald Trump declared Tuesday, serving notice he's ready to jump in and start making decisions six weeks before his inauguration. \nCosts for the two Boeing 747s are \"totally out of control,\" Trump told reporters in the lobby of his New York skyscraper. \nThe government has contracted with Boeing to build two or more new planes, which would go into service around 2024. That means Trump wouldn't fly on the new planes, which carry U.S. presidents around the globe, unless he pursued and won a second term. But the Air Force has pressed for a faster schedule, saying the current planes are becoming too expensive to repair and keep in good flying shape. \nThe contract for the planes was to be about $3 billion, but costs have been reported to be rising. Trump tweeted early Tuesday, \"Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order!\" \nLater, he said the costs are ridiculous: \"I think Boeing is doing a little bit of a number. We want Boeing to make a lot of money, but not that much money.\" \nThe price of Boeing stock dipped after his comments but not drastically. \n\"We are currently under contract for $170 million to help determine the capabilities of these complex military aircraft that serve the unique requirements of the President of the United States,\" Todd Blecher, a Boeing spokesman, said in a statement. \"We look forward to working with the U.S. Air Force on subsequent phases of the program allowing us to deliver the best planes for the President at the best value for the American taxpayer.\" \nSpeaking exclusively to Sinclair Broadcast Group, Sen. Maria Cantwell, D-Wash., praised Boeing despite the planes' high price tag. \n\"Boeing makes a great airplane and I think that, uh, making sure that we continue to show the great quality of product that's made in the Northwest and get people to understand what goes into that, I'm sure there's gonna be lots of discussion, but I think it'd be great to have the president of the United States flying around in an American-built plane,\" she said. \nSen. Cantwell added, \"I just know this, that, uh, American workers make a great product here that has flown many presidents of the United States.\" \nTrump now uses his own plane, a Boeing 757, but as president he would travel aboard the Air Force jet, which is equipped with special safety, defensive and communications equipment. \nLater Tuesday, Trump is making the second stop of this \"thank you\" tour in North Carolina, less than a week after his bombastic return to rallies at an Ohio appearance that felt more like a raucous campaign stop than a traditional speech by a president-to-be. \nAt that Cincinnati stop, Trump disparaged the media as \"dishonest,\" inspired loud \"Build the wall\" chants, took swipes at fellow Republicans and stunned his own aides with his surprise announcement from the stage that he was appointing retired Gen. James Mattis as secretary of defense. \nMattis' selection was being formally announced Tuesday, and Mattis will appear with Trump at the evening event in Fayetteville, Vice President-elect Mike Pence said on MSNBC's \"Morning Joe.\" \nLater this week there will be rallies in Iowa and Michigan as Trump barnstorms the country to salute his supporters who delivered the victories in the battleground states he needed to capture the White House. \nThe North Carolina rally comes a day after Trump chose retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson to be secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development, raising fresh concerns about the lack of experience some of Trump's Cabinet picks have with agencies they're now being chosen to lead. \nCarson, who opposed Trump in the Republican primaries, has no background in government or running a large bureaucracy. \nPence defended Carson's selection, saying he was \"absolutely qualified\" for the post. \nSouth Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, Trump's choice to be ambassador to the United Nations, has no foreign policy experience. Steve Mnuchin, a former Goldman Sachs partner and Hollywood executive, is Trump's man to lead the Treasury Department but has never worked in government. And Mattis, a widely praised battlefield commander, spent decades in the Marines but now is tapped to run the nation's largest government agency, the Defense Department, with 740,000 civilian employees in addition to 1.3 million service personnel. \nDemocrats swiftly criticized Carson's qualifications for his job. House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi called him a \"disconcerting and disturbingly unqualified choice.\" And New York Sen. Charles Schumer said he had \"serious concerns about Dr. Carson's lack of expertise and experience in dealing with housing issues. Someone who is as anti-government as him is a strange fit for housing secretary, to say the least.\" \nCarson would oversee a budget of nearly $50 billion that provides rental assistance for more than 5 million households. Demand for that assistance is high in part because housing costs are rising faster than incomes. HUD also promotes home ownership with the Federal Housing Administration underwriting about 1 in 6 mortgages issued in the U.S. The agency is charged with enforcing federal fair housing laws, too. \nIn a statement, Trump said he was \"thrilled to nominate\" Carson, citing his \"brilliant mind\" and his passion \"about strengthening communities and families within those communities.\" \nCarson, who grew up poor, quickly endorsed Trump after ending his own presidential bid despite Trump noting what he called Carson's \"pathological temper.\" Carson has been coy about joining the new administration, saying shortly after Trump's election victory that he wasn't certain he'd fit into a Cabinet-style role in a job like Health and Human Services secretary. \nTrump's selections also highlight a frequent divide between the two major political parties in their strategies in filling out a Cabinet: In early 2009, Republicans criticized incoming President Barack Obama for not making enough selections with private-sector experience. close ",

      "text": "SIMI VALLEY, Calif. (Reuters) - Boeing Co on Tuesday responded to a call by President-elect Donald Trump about the costs of a new Air Force One, saying that it currently had only a $170 million contract to determine the capabilities of the new presidential aircraft.\n\"We look forward to working with the U.S. Air Force on subsequent phases of the program allowing us to deliver the best plane for the president at the best value for the American taxpayer,\" said spokesman Todd Blecher.\nTrump on Tuesday said costs for the new plane were expected to reach $4 billion and urged the government to cancel a contract with Boeing for the jet.\nThe budgeted costs for the Air Force One replacement program are $2.87 billion for the fiscal years 2015 through 2021, according to budget documents. But the production contract has not yet been awarded to Boeing.\n(Reporting by Andrea Shalal)",

      "text": "Donald Trump declared Tuesday morning that the Air Force should cancel its contract with Boeing to build two new presidential airplanes, asserting that the agreement had a $4 billion price tag.\n“Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order!” the president-elect tweeted.\nIt’s not clear how Trump, who frequently tweets exaggerated or baseless claims, arrived at that number. Reuters, citing budget documents, reported that the “budgeted costs for the Air Force One replacement program are $2.87 billion for the fiscal years 2015 through 2021.”\nThe aircraft manufacturing company issued a statement clarifying that it is currently under contract for $170 million to determine the capabilities of the new aircraft.\n“We are currently under contract for $170 million to help determine the capabilities of these complex military aircraft that serve the unique requirements of the President of the United States. We look forward to working with the U.S. Air Force on subsequent phases of the program allowing us to deliver the best planes for the President at the best value for the American taxpayer.”\nThis preliminary process is expected to determine the ultimate cost that the forthcoming Air Force One aircraft will cost taxpayers.\n“Well, the plane is totally out of control,” Trump told reporters in Trump Tower. “It’s going to be over $4 billion for the Air Force One program. And I think it’s ridiculous. I think Boeing is doing a little bit of a number. We want Boeing to make a lot of money, but not that much money.”\nAn Air Force One aircraft at Joint Base Andrews near Washington, D.C. (Photo: Kevin Lamarque/Reuters) More Jason Miller, Trump’s communications director, further told reporters that Trump’s tweet “really speaks to the president-elect’s focus on keeping costs down across the board with regard to government spending.”\nHe continued: “I think people are really frustrated with some of the big price tags that are coming out for programs even in addition to this one. So we’re going to look for areas where we can keep costs down and look for ways where we can save money.”\nThe full details of the new contract have not yet been released, but some of the costs can be attributed to the high-end security and communications demands of a roaming commander in chief.\nA president needs the ability to travel anywhere on the planet quickly and with little notice. The aircraft has unlimited range because it is capable of refueling while airborne. The jet can function as a mobile command center if the U.S. is under attack. It contains sophisticated, secure communications equipment and onboard electronics that can protect against electromagnetic pulses.\nThe term “Air Force One” can be used to describe any aircraft carrying the president, but since the mid-20th century, it became associated with jets specifically equipped for the president. Now the term refers to one of two modified Boeing 747-200B series aircraft.\n“We have many decades of productive relationships with presidential administrations from both political parties and I would expect that we will reach the same point with the Trump administration,” Todd Blecher, a spokesman for Boeing, told Yahoo News.\nAboard Air Force One, White House press secretary Josh Earnest said there are unique technical requirements for the project to ensure that future presidents have upgraded capabilities while representing the United States abroad.\nAs for Trump’s tweet, Earnest said, “I’d refer to my colleagues at the Department of Defense for the particulars of the procurement contract. Some on the statistics that have been, uh, cited, shall we say, don’t appear to reflect the nature of the financial agreement between Boeing and the Department of Defense,” according to a pool report.\nHe said that the current Air Force One is “nearing the end of its projected life” and that future presidents should have a “modern presidential aircraft.”\nA profile on the White House’s website says Air Force One is operated by the Presidential Airlift Group, founded during the administration of Franklin Roosevelt in 1944. The group is part of the White House Military Office.\nRead More\n“Air Force One is one of the most recognizable symbols of the presidency, spawning countless references not just in American culture but across the world,” the website reads. “Emblazoned with the words ‘United States of America,’ the American flag, and the Seal of the President of the United States, it is an undeniable presence wherever it flies.”\nKevin W. Buckley, an executive officer at the Air Force Life Cycle Management Center at Wright-Patterson in Ohio, told the Dayton Daily News that it’s become harder to keep Air Force One airborne now that the aircraft are reaching to end of their 30-year life expectancies.\n“The real challenge, and the challenge that is forcing us to buy newer aircraft for the president, is to overcome the fact that there are heroics going on every day to keep the current aircraft flying and it’s becoming way too expensive and way too difficult to do that,” he said to the paper.\nAccording to the Associated Press, the new Air Force One planes would go into use around 2024, so Trump would not use them to travel around the world unless he won a second term.\nDonald Trump arrives in the lobby of Trump Tower in New York to speak to members of the media, Dec. 6, 2016. (Photo: Andrew Harnik/AP) More Trump does have plenty of familiarity with Boeing’s products. While campaigning, he crisscrossed the country in a private Boeing 757 with his last name emblazoned on the sides. As with all things bearing his name, Trump has praised his private jet as being the best of its kind.\nThe Trump Organization released a video gushing about the plane’s Rolls Royce engine, 24-carat gold-plated seat belts and luxury amenities.\nBack in January 2013, Trump tweeted that he was buying stock in Boeing after it had gone “way down.” At the time, the Boeing 787 Dreamliner’s lithium batteries were a widely reported problem.\n“@Boeing stock went way down because of 787 — so I just bought stock in @Boeing — great company!” he wrote.\nHis comments Tuesday seemed to have knocked that stock price down some, but his net worth apparently won’t be affected. “The president-elect sold all of his stock back in June,” Miller, Trump’s spokesman, told Yahoo News on a conference call with reporters.\nAdditional reporting by Hunter Walker.",

      "text": "\n© 2016 Time Inc. All rights reserved. Donald Trump Wants to Cancel Boeing’s Air Force One Contract \nPresident-elect Donald Trump on Tuesday demanded that the U.S. Air Force cancel its Air Force One contract with Boeing , claiming that “costs are out of control.” \nTrump’s tweet claimed the cost of the new Air Force One fleet would be more than $4 billion. In January, the U.S. Air Force awarded Boeing a preliminary contract worth $25.8 million, Reuters reported . And in a statement Tuesday afternoon, the Air Force said it had budgeted $2.7 billion for research, development, testing and evaluation for the project in 2017. \nIt’s not clear exactly what Trump’s $4 billion figure referred to, but a Government Accountability Office report published in March estimated that the total cost of replacing both jets would be $3.2 billion, before inflation, for fiscal years 2010 to 2020. \nBoeing, whose shares fell slightly after Trump’s tweet, released a statement Tuesday about its work on Air Force One. \n“We are currently under contract for $170 million to help determine the capabilities of these complex military aircraft that serve the unique requirements of the President of the United States,” spokesman Todd Blecher said in a statement. “We look forward to working with the U.S. Air Force on subsequent phases of the program allowing us to deliver the best planes for the President at the best value for the American taxpayer.” \nTrump’s transition team did not immediately respond to a request for more information. “The plane is totally out of control,” Trump told reporters in Trump Tower on Tuesday, according to a pool report. “It’s going to be over $4 billion for Air Force One program and I think it’s ridiculous. I think Boeing is doing a little bit of a number. We want Boeing to make a lot of money, but not that much money.” Asked about Trump’s comments Tuesday afternoon, White House spokesman Josh Earnest referred questions about contract details to the Department of Defense. “ Some of the statistics that have been, uh, cited, shall we say, don’t appear to reflect the nature of the financial agreement between Boeing and the Department of Defense,” Earnest said, according to a pool report. \nBoeing had been planning to replace the current Air Force One fleet—two Boeing 747-200s—with Boeing 747-8 jets, according to its website. The current jets will reach the end of their 30-year lifespan in 2017, the Wall Street Journal reported . Earlier this year, Trump criticized the age and condition of Air Force One, attacking President Barack Obama’s use of the plane to travel to campaign events for Hillary Clinton. “Now Air Force One is a very old Boeing 747,” Trump said July, according to the Washington Post . “It sucks up a lot of gas. A lot of fuel. Boy, the fuel bill. You turn on those engines, I can tell you, it’s a lot of money.” The Air Force did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Tuesday. ",

      "text": "Tweet By Ed Nickow , today at 8:51 pm \nOn Tuesday, Trump complained (via Twitter, of course) about the cost of Boeing's contract to build the new Air Force One fleet. Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order! \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 6, 2016 \nNot surprisingly, Trump's tweet is misleading. Politifact calls it half-true , pointing out that not only is Trump's figure overstated, but it lacks important context. That lack of context is probably a good reason why presidents shouldn't be making statements like this on Twitter. \nHere's how CNBC reported the story: As Trump pushes back on Boeing, consider this: His private jet cost a fraction of Air Force One https://t.co/hcs5HC5ASp \n— CNBC (@CNBC) December 6, 2016 \nThe CNBC article includes this passage beginning in sentence three: \nTrump's plane has gold seat buckles, gold faucets, gold inlaid in the wood and gold lighting hardware. It's also got a state-of-the-art multimedia system for watching movies and live TV anywhere in the world, and it's got leather seats custom-dyed with Trump's favorite color, and the Trump family crest is embroidered on all the sofas, seats and cushions. \nIt's not until paragraph six that we learn, \"Air Force One is a technology marvel, with an anti-missile system, scramblers, massive communications systems and back-up systems. So the two aircraft are not really comparable.\" \nThis is what \"normalization\" of Trump's bullshit looks like. CNBC should be ashamed of themselves for headlining their article with a ridiculous comparison and burying important details deep in the story. \nFor a good laugh or two at CNBC's expense, click on their tweet above and read some of the replies. \nFor an example of how this story can be reported in a way that provides meaningful information to readers, check out this article from the Washington Post .

America as largest aviation market \nAn Air China aircraft at Shanghai Hongqiao International Airport. Photographer: Qilai Shen/Bloomberg \nAirlines in China need to hire 5,550 pilots a year for the next two decades as new plane orders and demand for air travel surges, according to Boeing Co. \nWith the nation on course to eclipse North America as the world’s largest travel market, China will need 111,000 new aviators through 2035, Boeing said in a forecast released on Wednesday. That’s more than anywhere else in the Asia-Pacific region, which accounts for 40 percent of the global pilot requirement, the Chicago-based plane maker said. \nAviation is booming in China, where the number of airlines has increased 28 percent to 55 in the past five years. Air traffic over China is set to almost quadruple in the next two decades, making it the world’s busiest market, according to rival \n\"We are continuing to see a significant need for new pilots and maintenance technicians in the Asia-Pacific region and across the globe,” Sherry Carbary, vice president of Boeing Flight Services, said in a statement. \nAs China endures a pilot shortage, local airlines are dangling lucrative pay packages at foreigners with cockpit experience, according to recruiters. Foreign aviators can earn as much as $26,000 a month in net pay in China. \nThe Asian country also needs 119,000 flight technicians over the next two decades, while Southeast Asia requires 62,000 pilots and 67,000 technicians, Boeing said. \nIn a global forecast in July, the aircraft maker said airlines worldwide will need to recruit and train about 617,000 pilots to fly 39,620 planes, valued at $5.9 trillion, that are expected to be added through 2035. \nThe Asia-Pacific region will need 15,130 new aircraft valued at $2.35 trillion in the next two decades, according to Boeing. Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal. ",

      "text": "Secret Service advertised as hot amenity at Trump Tower \nDonald Trump on Tuesday demanded that the government cancel a deal with Boeing for two new Air Force One jets because, he claimed, it’s too expensive. \n“Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order!” he wrote on Twitter. \nHe later elaborated at Trump Tower, suggesting the aeronautics firm was “doing a little bit of a number” to pad its bottom line. \n“The plane is totally out of control. It’s going to be over $4 billion for the Air Force One program, and I think it’s ridiculous. I think Boeing is doing a little bit of a number. We want Boeing to make a lot of money, but not that much money,” he said. \nA March 2016 report from the Government Accountability Office estimated the overall cost of the replacement program at $3.21 billion, including the purchase of two planes. \nBut the GAO estimated the costs for research and development would be lower, at just under $2 billion, while the Air Force said R&D costs would be closer to $2.8 billion. If the GAO report used the same Air Force estimate for R&D, its estimate would be around the $4 billion Trump cited. \nAir Force Secretary Deborah Lee James said the two new Air Force Ones cost so much because the jets require state-of-the-art security as well as defense and communication systems. “It really is, in many ways, a flying White House, in terms of the security. There’s [electronic] countermeasures built in, communications, very high- level communications, security of all types. So it is a bit more complicated than perhaps meets the eye,” James told Politico. \nBoeing offered a muted response on it’s Web site. SEE ALSO ",

We have to look at it almost like a war,\" Trump thundered in North Carolina, vowing to keep companies from moving overseas during the second stop of his \"thank you\" tour to salute his supporters. \"We want the next generation of innovation and production to happen right here in America.\" \nTrump was far less bombastic than during the tour's kickoff in Ohio last week, striking more of the healing notes traditionally delivered by a president-to-be in the weeks after a bruising election. \n\"We will heal our divisions and unify our country. When Americans are unified there is nothing we cannot do — nothing!\" he told the crowd in Fayetteville. \"I'm asking you to dream big again as Americans. I'm asking you to believe in yourselves.\" \nThe Republican businessman largely stuck to the script Tuesday — and, in a change, even stopped the crowd when it started to boo the media — and avoided some of the score-settling and scorched-earth rhetoric that defined his campaign and was present again last week in Cincinnati. He also repeated his vow to fortify the nation's military and brought Marine Gen. James Mattis on stage, officially naming his choice to be Defense Secretary after teasing it last week. \nEarlier in the day, Trump plainly telegraphed that when he takes office in six weeks he'll take an interventionist role in the nation's economy — as well as play showman when he sees a chance. The celebrity businessman's declaration about Air Force One caused manufacturer Boeing's stock to drop temporarily and raised fresh questions about how his administration — not to mention his Twitter volleys — could affect the economy. \n\"The plane is totally out of control,\" Trump told reporters in the lobby of Trump Tower. \"I think Boeing is doing a little bit of a number. We want Boeing to make a lot of money, but not that much money.\" Earlier he had tweeted that the deal's costs were \"out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order!\" \nNot long after his first appearance, Trump returned to the lobby with Masayoshi Son, the CEO of SoftBank, a massive telecommunications company that counts Sprint among its holdings. Trump pointed proudly to Son's commitment to invest $50 billion in the United States, which Trump said could create 50,000 jobs. \nTrump — who also tweeted the deal — shook Son's hand and posed for photos, reveling as he had last week when he toured a Carrier plant in Indiana where he said he had instigated an agreement that will preserve about 1,000 jobs the appliance maker had planned to move to Mexico. Details of the deal were scarce and it was unclear if the money was part of a fund of up to $100 billion in global technology investments that SoftBank and the government of Saudi Arabia announced in October. \nAs for Air Force One, the government has agreed that Boeing will build two new planes, which would go into service around 2024. That means Trump might never fly on the aircraft, which carry U.S. presidents around the globe. \nThe Air Force has pressed for a faster schedule, saying the aging current Boeing 747s are becoming too expensive to repair and keep in good flying shape. The overall deal for researching, developing and building new planes was to be about $3 billion, but costs have been reported to be rising. \nThe General Accountability Office estimated in March that about $2 billion of the total — for work between 2010 and 2020 — was for research and development on complex systems, not for building the actual aircraft. The inflated $4 billion figure Trump cited appears to include operation and maintenance as well. \nBoeing responded to Trump Tuesday in a statement: \"We are currently under contract for $170 million to help determine the capabilities of these complex military aircraft that serve the unique requirements of the president of the United States. We look forward to working with the U.S. Air Force on subsequent phases of the program allowing us to deliver the best planes for the president at the best value for the American taxpayer.\" \nThe $170 million figure is just for a portion of the research and development efforts. \nTrump began his onslaught against Boeing at 8:52 a.m., tweeting \"Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order!\" \nThat tweet came 22 minutes after The Chicago Tribune posted a story in which the Boeing CEO voiced concerns about Trump's views on trade. \nThe president-elect then descended to the lobby of the Manhattan skyscraper that bears his name to reiterate his case. \nTrump had tweeted in 2013 that he owned Boeing stock, but a spokesman said Tuesday he sold all of his stock holdings in June. That sale was not publicized by the campaign at the time, and aides did not reveal how much cash it might have generated. \nIf Trump had held onto his stock portfolio, he would have been required to repeatedly file reports with the U.S. Office of Government Ethics. A 2012 update of the Ethics in Government Act obliges presidents and other senior government officials to report such transactions. \nTrump now uses his own plane, a Boeing 757, which he has outfitted with white leather and gold, a large flat-screen television and a bedroom. But as president it is expected that he would travel aboard the Air Force jet, which is equipped with special safety, defensive and communications equipment. Air Force One also has seating for reporters; Trump generally does not allow the press on his own plane. \nLater this week, Trump will use that plane to travel to rallies in Iowa and Michigan, And on Saturday, Trump will attend the 117th annual Army-Navy football game. The game between the two military academies often draws the commander in chief; both Barack Obama and George W. Bush have attended in recent years. \n___ \nAssociated Press Writers Joseph Pisani in New York and Stephen Braun and Richard Lardner in Washington contributed reporting. previous coverage President-elect Donald Trump greets retired Marine Corps Gen.

      "text": "Home | Global Economy | Trump On Boeing's Air Force One Contract: 'Cancel Order!' U.S. President-elect Donald Trump urged the government on Tuesday to cancel an order with Boeing Co for a revamped Air Force One - one of the most prominent symbols of the U.S. presidency - saying costs were out of control. Thomson Reuters | Last Updated:  05 (IST) Thomson Reuters EMAIL COMMENTS \nWashington/New York : U.S. President-elect Donald Trump urged the government on Tuesday to cancel an order with Boeing Co for a revamped Air Force One - one of the most prominent symbols of the U.S. presidency - saying costs were out of control. It was the latest example of Trump using his podium, often via Twitter messages, to rattle companies and foreign countries as he seeks to shake up business as usual in Washington. Trump, who takes office on Jan. 20, took aim at what he called cost overruns even though the plane is only in development stages. \"Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order!\" Trump said on Twitter. It was not immediately clear what prompted the timing of his complaint. Trump, who has vowed to use his skills as a businessman to make good deals that benefit American taxpayers, then made a surprise appearance in the lobby of Trump Tower in New York, where he amplified his comments. \"The plane is totally out of control. I think it's ridiculous. I think Boeing is doing a little bit of a number. We want Boeing to make a lot of money but not that much money,\" he told reporters. Boeing, which has built planes for U.S. presidents since 1943, has not yet begun building the two replacements for the current Air Force One planes, which are scheduled to be in service by 2024. Boeing has not yet been awarded the money to build the proposed replacements. \"We are currently under contract for $170 million to help determine the capabilities of these complex military aircraft that serve the unique requirements of the President of the United States,\" the company said in a statement. Boeing Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg called Trump after his remarks and they had a constructive dialogue, sources familiar with the conversation told Reuters. Muilenburg told Trump the cost of the airplane could be lowered if the U.S. Air Force changed its requirements and the issue would likely be resolved without a major dispute, the sources said. NOT A 'VANILLA' JUMBO JET The Air Force, which operates the presidential planes, announced in January 2015 that Boeing's 747-8 would be used to replace the two current presidential planes. The planes can fly direct from Washington to Hong Kong, 1,000 miles (1,600 km) farther than the current Air Force One. They are designed to be an airborne White House able to fly in worst-case security scenarios, such as nuclear war. President Barack Obama, who flew on the aging Air Force One to Tampa, Florida, on Tuesday, has called the plane one of the best perks of the presidency. His spokesman, Josh Earnest, told reporters on board that the contracting arrangements for replacements were \"rather complicated\" and said the recommendations for upgrades had been made by national security experts. The budgeted costs for the replacement program are $2.87 billion for the fiscal years 2015 through 2021, just on research and development, testing and evaluation, according to budget documents seen by Reuters. The current Air Force plan envisions extensive modifications to a Boeing 747-8 plane, adding military avionics and advanced communications to a self-defense system. \"Of course it's not like buying a vanilla Boeing jumbo jet,\" said defense consultant Loren Thompson, who has close ties to Boeing and other companies. A March 2016 report from the Government Accountability Office, the investigative arm of Congress, estimated the cost of the overall program at $3.21 billion, including the purchase of two aircraft. But the GAO estimated the costs for research and development would be lower, at just under $2 billion. If the GAO report used the same Air Force estimate for research and development, then its estimate would be around $4 billion. Boeing shares dipped after Trump's tweet but closed up 0.1 percent at $152.24. LATEST BROADSIDE Trump's broadside against Boeing comes as Washington's business lobbyists are bracing for a wild ride. A New York real estate developer, Trump took aim at big corporations during his campaign, saying that they often harmed ordinary Americans by sending jobs abroad. Since winning the Nov. 8 election, he has taken credit for pushing United Technologies Corp and Ford Motor Co to backtrack on outsourcing plans. Trump's attack on Boeing was the main topic of discussion at the annual luncheon of the Aerospace Industries Association, where the group's chief executive, Dave Melcher, urged the new administration to promote trade and bolster the high-paying manufacturing jobs that the $143 billion-a-year sector offers. Industry executives say they are seeing willingness from the Trump team to take another look at export controls that limit exports of U.S. weapons. But in the short term, his tweets and comments on Boeing put defense contractors on notice. \"The chilling effect on industry is huge, if you are a contractor,\" said Franklin Turner, a partner specializing in government contracts at law firm McCarter & English. Boeing relies on the U.S. military and other arms of the federal government for a significant share of its defense, space and security business which is worth $30 billion a year. The company clashed during the past year with Republicans in Congress over the Export-Import Bank, a federal program Boeing uses to finance sales to certain overseas customers. Boeing executives have also been outspoken supporters of the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal with Asia, which Trump opposed. © Thomson Reuters 2016 (This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)

      "title": "Trump on Boeing's Air Force One contract: 'Cancel order!'",
      "text": "By Andrea Shalal and Amy Tennery\nWASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. President-elect Donald Trump urged the government on Tuesday to cancel an order with Boeing Co for a revamped Air Force One - one of the most prominent symbols of the U.S. presidency - saying costs were out of control.\nIt was the latest example of Trump using his podium, often via Twitter messages, to rattle companies and foreign countries as he seeks to shake up business as usual in Washington. Trump, who takes office on Jan. 20, took aim at what he called cost overruns even though the plane is only in development stages.\n\"Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order!\" Trump said on Twitter. It was not immediately clear what prompted the timing of his complaint.\nTrump, who has vowed to use his skills as a businessman to make good deals that benefit American taxpayers, then made a surprise appearance in the lobby of Trump Tower in New York, where he amplified his comments.\n\"The plane is totally out of control. I think it's ridiculous. I think Boeing is doing a little bit of a number. We want Boeing to make a lot of money but not that much money,\" he told reporters.\nBoeing, which has built planes for U.S. presidents since 1943, has not yet begun building the two replacements for the current Air Force One planes, which are scheduled to be in service by 2024.\nBoeing has not yet been awarded the money to build the proposed replacements.\n\"We are currently under contract for $170 million to help determine the capabilities of these complex military aircraft that serve the unique requirements of the President of the United States,\" the company said in a statement.\nBoeing Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg called Trump after his remarks and they had a constructive dialogue, sources familiar with the conversation told Reuters. Muilenburg told Trump the cost of the airplane could be lowered if the U.S. Air Force changed its requirements and the issue would likely be resolved without a major dispute, the sources said.\nNOT A 'VANILLA' JUMBO JET\nThe Air Force, which operates the presidential planes, announced in January 2015 that Boeing's 747-8 would be used to replace the two current presidential planes.\nThe planes can fly direct from Washington to Hong Kong, 1,000 miles (1,600 km) farther than the current Air Force One. They are designed to be an airborne White House able to fly in worst-case security scenarios, such as nuclear war.\nPresident Barack Obama, who flew on the aging Air Force One to Tampa, Florida, on Tuesday, has called the plane one of the best perks of the presidency.\nHis spokesman, Josh Earnest, told reporters on board that the contracting arrangements for replacements were \"rather complicated\" and said the recommendations for upgrades had been made by national security experts.\nThe budgeted costs for the replacement program are $2.87 billion for the fiscal years 2015 through 2021, just on research and development, testing and evaluation, according to budget documents seen by Reuters.\nThe current Air Force plan envisions extensive modifications to a Boeing 747-8 plane, adding military avionics and advanced communications to a self-defense system.\n\"Of course it’s not like buying a vanilla Boeing jumbo jet,\" said defense consultant Loren Thompson, who has close ties to Boeing and other companies.\nA March 2016 report from the Government Accountability Office, the investigative arm of Congress, estimated the cost of the overall program at $3.21 billion, including the purchase of two aircraft.\nBut the GAO estimated the costs for research and development would be lower, at just under $2 billion. If the GAO report used the same Air Force estimate for research and development, then its estimate would be around $4 billion.\nBoeing shares dipped after Trump's tweet but closed up 0.1 percent at $152.24.\nLATEST BROADSIDE\nTrump's broadside against Boeing comes as Washington's business lobbyists are bracing for a wild ride.\nA New York real estate developer, Trump took aim at big corporations during his campaign, saying that they often harmed ordinary Americans by sending jobs abroad.\nSince winning the Nov. 8 election, he has taken credit for pushing United Technologies Corp and Ford Motor Co to backtrack on outsourcing plans.\nTrump’s attack on Boeing was the main topic of discussion at the annual luncheon of the Aerospace Industries Association, where the group’s chief executive, Dave Melcher, urged the new administration to promote trade and bolster the high-paying manufacturing jobs that the $143 billion-a-year sector offers.\nIndustry executives say they are seeing willingness from the Trump team to take another look at export controls that limit exports of U.S. weapons. But in the short term, his tweets and comments on Boeing put defense contractors on notice.\n\"The chilling effect on industry is huge, if you are a contractor,\" said Franklin Turner, a partner specializing in government contracts at law firm McCarter & English.\nBoeing relies on the U.S. military and other arms of the federal government for a significant share of its defense, space and security business which is worth $30 billion a year.\nThe company clashed during the past year with Republicans in Congress over the Export-Import Bank, a federal program Boeing uses to finance sales to certain overseas customers. Boeing executives have also been outspoken supporters of the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal with Asia, which Trump opposed.\n(Additional reporting by Timothy Gardner, Emily Stephenson, Mike Stone, Susan Heavey, Andrea Shalal and Doina Chiacu in Washington; Ayesha Rascoe aboard Air Force One; Steve Holland, Alana Wise, Jeffrey Dastin, and Lewis Krauskopf in New York; Writing by Roberta Rampton and Amanda Becker; Editing by Alistair Bell and Peter Cooney)",

      "text": "× Trump wants to cancel Air Force One order from Boeing \nNEW YORK — Donald Trump wants to cancel government plans to build two new Air Force One jets. \nThe president-elect said in a tweet Tuesday that the new Boeing 747 jet that’s being built to carry “future presidents” already costs more than $4 billion, and that he wants to cancel the order. \n“Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order!” \nAsked by reporters Tuesday morning about the tweet, Trump responded, “Well the plane is totally out of control. It’s going to be over $4 billion for [the] Air Force One program,” he said. “And I think it’s ridiculous. I think Boeing is doing a little bit of a number. We want Boeing to make a lot of money, but not that much money.” \nTrump did not say why he believes the planes will cost “more than $4 billion.” Boeing says it currently has an Air Force One contract worth $170 million. Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order! \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 6, 2016 \nA Boeing source familiar with the program told CNN that not even the company can estimate the cost of the program at this time since “the Pentagon has not even decided all the bells and whistles they want on the new Air Force One.” \nWithout knowing all the security features it is hard to give an estimated cost, the source added, and the Air Force isn’t even sure whether it wants two or three of the planes. \n“We are not sure where he is getting that number from,” said the Boeing official. \n“The statistics that have been cited [by Trump], shall we say, don’t appear to reflect the nature of the financial arrangement between Boeing and the Department of Defense,” said Obama White House spokesman Josh Earnest. \nIn an official statement, Boeing that its current contract allows it “to help determine the capabilities of these complex military aircraft that serve the unique requirements of the President of the United States.” \nSo far the Air Force has budgeted $2.9 billion through 2021 for two new Air Force Ones, which will replace the aging pair of blue, white and polished aluminum 747-200Bs serving the President. \nThe new planes aren’t expected to be ready to fly until 2022. The Air Force has already spent about $93 million preparing to build the new jets, according to Defense Department budget documents. \nThat $93 million is included in Boeing’s current contract. Manufacturing has yet to begin. \n“We look forward to working with the U.S. Air Force on subsequent phases of the program allowing us to deliver the best planes for the President at the best value for the American taxpayer,” said Boeing’s statement. \nTrump’s comment emphasizes that he’s looking for ways to cut government costs where he can, according to his spokesman Jason Miller. \n“The point that the President-elect was making here was that a $4 billion price tag is a very big number, the taxpayers want to make sure we’re seeing absolute accountability and that the government is doing the best to drive costs down,” he said. \nOut of the two Air Force One jets that are currently in use, one has been flying since Ronald Reagan was president, and the other was delivered in 1990 during George H.W. Bush’s administration. Both are getting increasingly expensive to fly and maintain. \nThe Air Force has yet to place a formal order for the new planes. It has chosen the latest version of Boeing’s jumbo jet, the 747-8, as the platform for the new Air Force One planes. Building the basic planes would take about two years. A team of engineers and aircraft machinists would then add state of the art communications, missile avoidance systems, inflight refueling, VIP interior and protections from the electromagnetic pulse of a nuclear blast. That takes years to do. \nBoeing builds the 747 at its factories in Washington state, and it currently has a large back order for its commercial jets, especially the 787 Dreamliner. Airlines regularly cancel orders for planes, although it would be a loss of both prestige as well as billions in revenue should the Air Force drop plans to build a new version of Air Force One. \nThe current planes have 4,000 square feet of interior floor space. The 747-8 can travel an additional 1,000 miles without refueling, fly faster with a heavier maximum takeoff weight and get better fuel economy than the 747-200 that’s used for the current Air Force Ones. \nBoeing’s first presidential plane was used by Franklin Roosevelt back in 1943, and it has made every Air Force One since President John Kennedy. \nBoeing is the nation’s largest exporter. But it has recently been criticized by Trump for both its deal to sell commercial jets to Iran and its decision to open a factory in China to finish passenger cabins on planes purchased by Chinese airlines. \nRecently retired Boeing CEO Jim McNerney was named just last week to an all-star team of corporate executives who will advise Trump on jobs and the economy. Shares of Boeing were slightly lower after Trump’s comment. \nTrump held between $50,000 to $100,000 worth of Boeing stock, according to a financial disclosure from June of this year. But Trump spokesman Miller said Tuesday that he sold all his publicly-traded stock that same month. \nIn January of 2013, when the Boeing 787 Dreamliner was grounded by problems with its batteries, Trump tweeted that he had bought just bought stock in Boeing at depressed prices, calling it a “great company!” ",

      "text": "President-elect Donald Trump said the latest Air Force One order should be canceled because of “ridiculous” costs at Boeing Co., taking aim at plans to replace jets that are among the most visible symbols of the American presidency.\n“Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion,” Trump said Tuesday on Twitter. “Cancel order!”\nBoeing is the latest major company to be singled out by Trump, who last week announced a deal with United Technologies Corp. to keep a U.S. factory open instead of moving production to Mexico. The president-elect, who turned jobs and trade into defining issues of his campaign, tweeted about Boeing days after Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg called on him and Congress to ensure that U.S. companies have the tools to compete in a global economy.\nBoeing, the largest U.S. exporter, saw its shares drop and recover Tuesday, closing at $152.24, up less than 1 percent. The company’s planes have been used to ferry presidents since 1943, when Franklin D. Roosevelt rode a Boeing 314 flying boat across the Atlantic for a wartime meeting with British Prime Minister Winston Churchill.\n“We are currently under contract for $170 million to help determine the capabilities of this complex military aircraft that serves the unique requirements of the president of the United States,” Boeing spokesman Todd Blecher said in an email. “We look forward to working with the U.S. Air Force on subsequent phases of the program allowing us to deliver the best plane for the president at the best value for the American taxpayer.”\nPENTAGON BUDGET \nThe Pentagon already is budgeting $3.2 billion for research and development, military construction and acquisition of two of the Air Force One planes through fiscal 2021, said Kevin Brancato, the lead government contracts analyst for Bloomberg Government. More money is anticipated in the two years after that. Boeing 747-8 planes average about $225 million each, he said, which means most of the expenses will go to outfitting the planes for presidential use.\nThe Air Force and Boeing are still conducting work to reduce the program’s technical risks before the company is awarded an advanced development contract, Capt. Michael Hertzog, a spokesman for the service branch, said in an email. Budgeted spending can be expected “to change as the program matures with the completion of the risk-reduction activities,” he said.\n“This is what an Air Force One costs,” Richard Aboulafia, an aerospace analyst at Teal Group, said of Trump’s tweet. “There have been no cost overruns. The ability to fly the president during a war is fundamentally expensive.”\nAIRCRAFT CAPABILITIES \nThe Air Force expects the planes to have the range to fly between continents and to have comparable interiors to the current 747 aircraft, whose features include work and sleeping quarters for the president and first family. Beyond such amenities, the planes must be outfitted for highly advanced, secure communications and classified defensive capabilities that make them flying fortresses.\nPresident George W. Bush stayed airborne for much of the first few hours after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. The new planes will also be equipped for midair refueling.\n“This is madness,” Aboulafia said of Trump’s tweet. “I think about the complications, for example, if the president and his staff had to run the nation on 9/11 and afterward without an Air Force One, and my mind is kind of scrambled on that.”\nAGING FLEET \nThe Pentagon is looking to replace its aging fleet of Boeing 747-200 aircraft, which were built in the 1980s and will reach the planned 30-year service life in 2017. Officials have said the next Air Force One 747-8 jets are estimated to begin operation in fiscal 2023.\nThere’s no clear alternative to Chicago-based Boeing to build a new Air Force One, especially not for a president who wants to buy U.S. products. The only other option for a four-engine plane the Air Force is seeking would come from Europe’s Airbus Group SE, which said in 2013 that it wouldn’t make a proposal.\nThe Air Force said last year that it was giving Boeing the contract without competition because its plane is the only one manufactured in the United States “that when fully missionized meets the necessary critically important capabilities” that a president needs. But the service also said it would encourage other companies to bid for the special equipment needed to convert the aircraft for presidential use.\n“The plane is totally out of control,” Trump said in a brief appearance in the lobby of Trump Tower in New York on Tuesday. “I think Boeing is doing a little bit of a number. We want Boeing to make a lot of money, but not that much money.”\nSen. John McCain, the Arizona Republican who heads the Senate Armed Services Committee, said he counted himself among those who think there are too many bells and whistles on Air Force One. “I think it ought to be reviewed,” he told reporters at the Capitol. “I think it’s a legitimate concern.”\nMARINE ONE \nThe dispute is reminiscent of the controversy over the Pentagon’s efforts to develop a replacement for the helicopters used to ferry the president and executive branch officials, known as Marine One when the president is on board.\nA program managed by Lockheed Martin Corp. to build as many as 28 helicopters was canceled in 2009 after about $3.1 billion was spent, and the planned $6.1 billion project soared to a projected $13 billion. In 2009, President Barack Obama cited it as “an example of the procurement process gone amok.”\nIn 2014, the Pentagon tried again, awarding an initial $1.24 billion contract to a team led by Sikorsky Aircraft. Since then, Lockheed acquired Sikorsky. So it’s back in charge of the helicopter project.\nSTOCK SALES \nTrump transition spokesman Jason Miller said he couldn’t address whether the president-elect or his top advisers had been in contact with Boeing or the Pentagon. Details about Trump’s goal, whether to scrap the plane or renegotiate the cost, will emerge after he’s sworn in next month, he said.\n“This really speaks to the president-elect’s focus on keeping costs down across the board,” Miller told reporters on a conference call. The $4 billion price tag “is a very big number.”\nTrump previously held stock in Boeing but sold all his equity holdings in companies in June, Miller said.",

      "text": "By Tess Stynes and Doug Cameron\nBoeing Co. agreed to acquire Liquid Robotics, maker of a wave and solar-powered autonomous robot, building on a collaboration between the companies and expanding Boeing's capabilities in unmanned underwater vehicles.\nLiquid Robotics's ocean robot, called the Wave Glider, is used for ocean data collection and communications. In September of 2014 Boeing and Liquid Robotics entered a collaboration deal on a version of the Wave Glider to enhance its capabilities.\nFinancial terms weren't provided for the deal, the second acquisition of an unmanned undersea vehicle maker this year by a major defense firm. Rival General Dynamics Corp. acquired submarine robot maker Bluefin Robotics during February.\nBoeing executives have been upbeat about the future of the undersea business, though some rivals said the Navy has been slow to come up with deals for their use after encouraging industry to invest heavily in development.\n\"There's a lot happening,\" said Leanne Caret, chief executive of Boeing's defense arm in an interview on the sidelines of a defense conference last weekend.\nMs. Caret said Boeing had received inquiries from a number of potential government customers about the Echo Voyager, a 51-foot unmanned submarine it has already developed, as well as from companies in the energy sector that make extensive use of underwater vehicles.\nWrite to Tess Stynes at tess.stynes@wsj.com and Doug Cameron at doug.cameron@wsj.com\n 16:28 ET (21:28 ",

By Kevin Nielsen National Online Journalist, Breaking News Global News \nWATCH ABOVE: Trump says Air Force One deal too expensive What is this? \nSponsored content is written by Global News' editorial staff without any editorial influence by the sponsor. If you'd like to learn more... X What is this? \nSponsored content is written by Global News' without any editorial influence by the sponsor. If you'd like to learn more... - \nDonald Trump issued a tweet Tuesday morning suggesting the U.S. government should cancel a $4-billion contract with Boeing to produce a new Air Force One. \n“Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order!” The U.S. president-elect said on Twitter, although the timing of the tweet seemed odd at first. \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 6, 2016 \nWithin minutes, the Boeing shares dropped over $2 before experiencing a full recovery by the time markets closed. \nTrump spoke to reporters afterward in the lobby of the Trump Tower in New York saying, “the plane is totally out of control. I think it’s ridiculous. I think Boeing is doing a little bit of a number. We want Boeing to make a lot of money but not that much money.” \nREAD MORE: Donald Trump wants to cancel Boeing’s Air Force One contract, says it’s too expensive \nBoeing has not actually started to build a new Air Force One but the company says it is currently under contract to determine the requirements of the proposed replacements which are scheduled to come into service in 2024. \n“We are currently under contract for $170 million to help determine the capabilities of these complex military aircraft that serve the unique requirements of the President of the United States,” the company said in a statement. \nTrump is said to have unloaded shares in Boeing and other companies in June, according to a spokesman, so he did not stand to benefit from the fluctuation. So why did he deliver the message? This story in which Boeing CEO expressed concerns about Trump's views on trade posted just before Trump tweet — https://t.co/aBvK87GzzW \nCNN’s Jake Tapper pointed to an article on Twitter in which the Chicago Tribune interviewed Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenberg . \nThe Boeing boss, whose company is the United States’ largest manufacturing exporter , points to the importance of free trade for the American economy, which flies in the face of what Trump is preaching. \nREAD MORE: Donald Trump fires opening shot in risky test of wills with China \n“Last year, we delivered 495 737s from our factory in Renton, Wash., to customers around the world. One in every three of those 737s were bound for China,” he told the newspaper. “And about a quarter of all our airplane deliveries … were bound for Chinese customers.” \n",

      "title": "Trump on Boeing's Air Force One contract: 'Cancel order!'",
      "text": "Viber Copy this link Air Force One sits ready for boarding on the tarmac at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland US December 6, 2016, the same morning that US President-elect Donald Trump urged the government to cancel purchase of Boeing's new Air Force One plane saying it was \"ridiculous\" and too expensive. Photo: Reuters Reuters, Washington/New York \nUS President-elect Donald Trump urged the government on Tuesday to cancel an order with Boeing Co for a revamped Air Force One - one of the most prominent symbols of the US presidency - saying costs were out of control. It was the latest example of Trump using his podium, often via Twitter messages, to rattle companies and foreign countries as he seeks to shake up business as usual in Washington. Trump, who takes office on Jan. 20, took aim at what he called cost overruns even though the plane is only in development stages. \"Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order!\" Trump said on Twitter. It was not immediately clear what prompted the timing of his complaint. Trump, who has vowed to use his skills as a businessman to make good deals that benefit American taxpayers, then made a surprise appearance in the lobby of Trump Tower in New York, where he amplified his comments. \"The plane is totally out of control. I think it's ridiculous. I think Boeing is doing a little bit of a number. We want Boeing to make a lot of money but not that much money,\" he told reporters. Boeing, which has built planes for US presidents since 1943, has not yet begun building the two replacements for the current Air Force One planes, which are scheduled to be in service by 2024. Boeing has not yet been awarded the money to build the proposed replacements. \"We are currently under contract for $170 million to help determine the capabilities of these complex military aircraft that serve the unique requirements of the President of the United States,\" the company said in a statement. Boeing Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg called Trump after his remarks and they had a constructive dialogue, sources familiar with the conversation told Reuters. Muilenburg told Trump the cost of the airplane could be lowered if the US Air Force changed its requirements and the issue would likely be resolved without a major dispute, the sources said. Not a 'Vanilla' jumbo jet \nThe Air Force, which operates the presidential planes, announced in January 2015 that Boeing's 747-8 would be used to replace the two current presidential planes. The planes can fly direct from Washington to Hong Kong, 1,000 miles (1,600 km) farther than the current Air Force One. They are designed to be an airborne White House able to fly in worst-case security scenarios, such as nuclear war. President Barack Obama, who flew on the aging Air Force One to Tampa, Florida, on Tuesday, has called the plane one of the best perks of the presidency. His spokesman, Josh Earnest, told reporters on board that the contracting arrangements for replacements were \"rather complicated\" and said the recommendations for upgrades had been made by national security experts. The budgeted costs for the replacement program are $2.87 billion for the fiscal years 2015 through 2021, just on research and development, testing and evaluation, according to budget documents seen by Reuters. The current Air Force plan envisions extensive modifications to a Boeing 747-8 plane, adding military avionics and advanced communications to a self-defense system. \"Of course it's not like buying a vanilla Boeing jumbo jet,\" said defense consultant Loren Thompson, who has close ties to Boeing and other companies. A March 2016 report from the Government Accountability Office, the investigative arm of Congress, estimated the cost of the overall program at $3.21 billion, including the purchase of two aircraft. But the GAO estimated the costs for research and development would be lower, at just under $2 billion. If the GAO report used the same Air Force estimate for research and development, then its estimate would be around $4 billion. Boeing shares dipped after Trump's tweet but closed up 0.1 percent at $152.24. Latest broadside \nTrump's broadside against Boeing comes as Washington's business lobbyists are bracing for a wild ride. A New York real estate developer, Trump took aim at big corporations during his campaign, saying that they often harmed ordinary Americans by sending jobs abroad. Since winning the November 8 election, he has taken credit for pushing United Technologies Corp and Ford Motor Co to backtrack on outsourcing plans. Trump's attack on Boeing was the main topic of discussion at the annual luncheon of the Aerospace Industries Association, where the group's chief executive, Dave Melcher, urged the new administration to promote trade and bolster the high-paying manufacturing jobs that the $143 billion-a-year sector offers. Industry executives say they are seeing willingness from the Trump team to take another look at export controls that limit exports of US weapons. But in the short term, his tweets and comments on Boeing put defense contractors on notice. \"The chilling effect on industry is huge, if you are a contractor,\" said Franklin Turner, a partner specializing in government contracts at law firm McCarter & English. Boeing relies on the US military and other arms of the federal government for a significant share of its defense, space and security business which is worth $30 billion a year. The company clashed during the past year with Republicans in Congress over the Export-Import Bank, a federal program Boeing uses to finance sales to certain overseas customers. Boeing executives have also been outspoken supporters of the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal with Asia, which Trump opposed. \n\n ",

      "text": "View Comments Pic: Bernama KUALA LUMPUR : Boeing projects that more than 500,000 new pilots and technicians will be needed to support the expanding demand for new airplane deliveries over the next two decades. The outlook anticipates the need for 248,000 new commercial airline pilots and 268,000 new technicians through 2035, it declared in its 2016 Boeing Pilot & Technician Outlook for the Asia-Pacific region today.\"We are continuing to see a significant need for new pilots and maintenance technicians in the Asia-Pacific region and across the globe,\" said Sherry Carbary, Vice President, Boeing Flight Services in a teleconference.\"This translates into exciting career opportunities for those interested in the aerospace industry. \"We recognise that to attract a new generation of pilots and technicians, there is a need to inspire and train them in new ways. \"That’s why, Boeing continues to work closely with airlines, regulators, flight schools and other industry groups to develop innovative training methods and courseware,\" she added.She said leading the region in projected demand for new pilots and technicians is China with 111,000 pilots and 119,000 technicians, followed by · Southeast Asia at 62,000 pilots and 67,000 technicians.Other regions which will also continue to see long-term demand in the tens of thousands of pilots and technicians is South Asia needing 41,000 pilots and 39,000 technicians, Northeast Asia (21,000 pilots, 26,000 technicians) and Oceania (13,000 pilots, 17,000 technicians).Carbary said to support the future growth of training, Boeing has been investing in the development of augmented reality and virtual reality-based training solutions.\"When combined with Boeing’s proven training expertise, augmented reality and virtual reality are certainly promising technologies, that can provide both instructor and student with an immersive learning environment,\" said Michael Edwards, General Manager of Boeing Research & Technology – Australia.The Boeing Pilot & Technician Outlook is closely tied to projections for new airplane deliveries around the globe. The demand for new pilots is primarily driven by new airplane deliveries and fleet mix, while new technician demand is primarily driven by fleet growth.As with personnel demand, the Asia-Pacific region also leads the demand for new commercial airplane deliveries over the next 20 years. The region comprises 40 per cent of the global need due to fleet growth in the single-aisle market, driven by low-cost carriers.According to Boeing's 2016 Current Market Outlook, 15,130 new airplanes, valued at US$2.35 trillion, will be needed in the Asia-Pacific region by 2035. -BERNAMA",

      "text": "Trump may cancel Boeing order for new Air Force One KING 5's Glenn Farley reports. Travis Pittman, KING 9:27 PM. CST December 06, 2016 Air Force One flying over Mount Rushmore. (Photo by USAF) \nPresident-elect Donald Trump says construction of the next Air Force One -- a Boeing 747-8 -- should be canceled due to the costs. \nTrump tweeted Tuesday morning: Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 6, 2016 \n\"The plane is totally out of control. It's going to be over $4 billion for the Air Force One program,\" Trump later said in the lobby of Trump Tower Tuesday. “I think its ridiculous. I think Boeing is doing a little bit of a number. We want Boeing to make a lot of money but not that much money.” \nBoeing released this statement in response. \n\"We are currently under contract for $170 million to help determine the capabilities of this complex military aircraft that serves the unique requirements of the President of the United States. We look forward to working with the US Air Force on subsequent phases of the program allowing us to deliver the best plane for the president at the best value for the American taxpayer.\" \nMultiple reports say the total cost for the new 747-8s would be between $2,7 billion and $3.2 billion. UPDATE: White House says some of Trump's Air Force One statistics don't appear to reflect arrangements between Boeing, Department of Defense \nRelated: History and background of Air Force One The Wall Street Journal reports the two current Air Force One planes, which are heavily-modified 747-200s, are due to reach the end of their designed 30-year lifespan next year. Although Boeing has a contract to begin development on the new versions, it has not yet reached a deal to build the planes. \nKING 5 Aviation Specialist Glenn Farley says Boeing would be paid to build the basic airplane. The rest of the cost would be paid to a contractor who would be hired to make extensive modifications to the plane. \nThe government would not just be buying one but two 747-8s. And they aren't your average passenger jets. They would undergo heavy modifications needed to make the planes into mobile command centers complete with an anti-missile system and countermeasures. \nThe executive director of SPEEA, the union which represents Boeing engineers, tweeted this in response. @Reuters The Presidential airplanes aren't just fancy airplanes. They are mobile Whitehouses hardened to survive WWIII. ",

      "text": "Posted on December 6, 2016 by Editor - Stock Markets News \n  A tweet from president-elect Donald Trump calling on the U.S. government to scrap an order with Boeing Co. for the development of a replacement for the Air Force One jet temporarily knocked about $1 billion US off the stock market value of the aircraft maker. “Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order!” Trump tweeted Tuesday morning. “The plane is totally out of control. I think it’s ridiculous. I think Boeing is doing a little bit of a number. We want Boeing to make a lot of money but not that much money,” Trump later told reporters when he spoke in the lobby of the Trump Tower in New York. Reuters reported that Boeing has not begun building the two replacement aircraft for the current Air Force One, and has not been awarded the money for them. The company is currently working on design and engineering for the aircraft. “We are currently under contract for $170 million to help determine the capabilities of these complex military aircraft that serve the unique requirements of the president of the United States,” Boeing said in a statement. It was not clear what Trump was using as the source for his claims about the cost of the planes. The White House also said it didn’t know where Trump got his figure. The Government Accountability Office, the U.S. government’s auditing arm, in March 2016 estimated total program costs at more than $3.2 billion US between the 2010 and 2020 federal budget years. According to the Associated Press, U.S. military officials say two new aircraft could cost at least $4 billion US for development, construction and future maintenance, matching the figure Trump cited. The officials were not authorized to comment publicly about the sensitive military project and spoke on condition of anonymity. Boeing aircraft have been used to shuttle U.S. presidents since 1943. The new replacements for Air Force One are due to be in service by 2024. Illustrating the power of Trump’s words, shares of Boeing opened sharply lower at the start of trading on the New York Stock Exchange on Tuesday. After finishing Monday at $152.16, the stock opened at $150.84 and got as low as $150.02, representing a drop in stock market value of about $1 billion US. Following the initial shock, Boeing’s stock regained ground to finish the day at $152.64. In the wake of Trump’s tweet, the Washington Post later reported that a Trump spokesman said the president-elect had sold all of his shares in companies earlier this year. Jay Miller didn’t say why Trump had sold the shares or what he got for them. Selling his stock portfolio could solve an issue for Trump: concerns that his holdings could present potential conflicts of interest. Share This:",

      "title": "Q&A: A look at Trump’s call to cancel new Air Force One",
      "text": "WASHINGTON — President-elect Donald Trump suggested Tuesday that he would cancel Boeing’s contract to build a new fleet of presidential aircraft to replace the aging models that shuttle the president around the world. He cited “out of control” costs of more than $4 billion in a tweet that ended with “Cancel order!” The New York businessman, who flies on his own Boeing plane, later told reporters the cost to the government was “ridiculous,” though he appeared to be citing more than just the bare acquisition costs. Trump said he wanted the aircraft manufacturer to make money, “but not that much.”\nHere’s a look at Trump’s claims about Air Force One, one of the most recognized symbols of the American presidency.\n___\nHOW MUCH WILL THE PROJECT COST?\nThe Government Accountability Office, the government’s auditing arm, in March of this year estimated total program costs at more than $3.2 billion, much of it for research and development, through the 2020 federal budget year. Separately, Defense Department and Air Force officials put the cost for two new aircraft at around Trump’s figure of $4 billion. That estimate includes the cost of research and development, construction and future maintenance, according to the officials who were not authorized to comment publicly about the sensitive military project and spoke on condition of anonymity.\n___\nWHY DOES THE GOVERNMENT WANT NEW PLANES? DOESN’T THE CURRENT AIR FORCE ONE WORK JUST FINE?\nThat’s true, but the two modified Boeing 747s the president uses for the bulk of his travels are getting older and breaking down more often, officials say. They were built in the 1980s and began flying in the early 1990s. One flew to MacDill Air Force in Tampa, Florida, on Tuesday.\nThe distinctive blue-and-white plane with the U.S. flag on its tail and the presidential seal on its belly is basically a flying office for the president, complete with sophisticated communications, military and other capabilities. Safety of the president is paramount, and the government started the process to replace the aging aircraft with younger versions that incorporate updated capabilities and technological advances.\nAir Force One is unlike most aircraft. It can be refueled in the air and, with an unlimited range, can take the president wherever he needs to go. Its electrical systems are hardened to protect against an electromagnetic pulse, and the plane has advanced, secure communications equipment that will allow it to function as mobile command center in the event of an attack on the United States, according to the White House.\nThe president and most of those who fly with him enjoy 4,000 square feet of floor space on three levels, including a suite for the president with an office and a conference room. A medical suite can function as an operating room in an emergency, and a doctor is always on board. The plane has quarters for those who regularly accompany the president on trips, including White House staff, Secret Service agents, traveling journalists and other guests.\n___\nWHAT IS BOEING’S ROLE?\nThe Air Force has spent about $170 million on three contracts to begin to identify the types of military and specialized systems that would have to be added to a commercial plane to adapt it for use by the president. Boeing has that contract, and also would build the replacement Air Force One.\nUnder the deal, the Air Force would buy the 747-8 aircraft, a newer version of those currently in use as Air Force One. The new aircraft wouldn’t be ready until around 2023 or 2024, the end of Trump’s second term, should he seek and win re-election.\nIn a statement, Boeing said it looks forward to working with the Air Force “to deliver the best planes for the president at the best value for the American taxpayer.”\n___\nCOULD TRUMP ASK ANOTHER COMPANY TO BUILD THE NEW AIRCRAFT?\nIt’s unclear. Trump did not elaborate, either on Twitter or during a brief appearance before reporters Tuesday. Presidents have flown on Boeing aircraft for more than seven decades and the Chicago-based company is the only American maker of these types of planes. Its closest rival would be French aircraft manufacturer Airbus.\n___\nDIDN’T OBAMA CANCEL THE CONTRACT FOR A NEW PRESIDENTIAL HELICOPTER?\nWhite House press secretary Josh Earnest said Obama didn’t scrap the project entirely, but ordered the military to restart it to bring the cost projections under control. The Marine One project was further along in the process than the Air Force One upgrade, and with costs much greater than originally expected.\n___\nCAN TRUMP CANCEL THE PROJECT?\nYes, but not before he is sworn in to office on Jan. 20.\n writers Lolita C.

      "text": "Aerospace expert: Boeing criticism is ‘complete madness’ By Kipp Robertson , MyNorthwest.com Writer   10:42 am \nPresident-elect Donald Trump speaks to members of the media in the lobby at Trump Tower in New York, Tuesday, Dec. 6, 2016. (AP Photo/Andrew Harnik) Tweet \nOn Tuesday morning, President-elect Donald Trump tweeted that he wants the government to cancel its multi-billion dollar order with Boeing to build the brand new Air Force One. Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order! \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 6, 2016 \nTrump’s reasoning is that Boeing is “doing a little bit of a number.” \nPresident-elect Trump on his desire to cancel Boeing’s Air Force One order: “We want Boeing to make a lot of money, but not that much money” pic.twitter.com/kIdpCy0JuX \nBoeing won the contract to build the new Air Force One in January 2015, but no plane has been officially ordered by the Department of Defense. \nAerospace industry expert Richard Aboulafia says this is “complete madness.” \n“I scratched my head and thought I might be asleep and might be dreaming … but it turns out I was alive, awake, and at my computer,” he told Seattle’s Morning News. \nThe cost for the planes was an estimated $3 billion, according to the Associated Press, but costs have reportedly been rising. Aboulafia says this isn’t Boeing trying to make a ton of money. \n“It’s actually what it costs to have two airplanes that can survive a nuclear war and transport the president in times of national emergency, and any other time for that matter,” he explained. Reading into the tweet \nWhat Trump appears to be saying is either the president doesn’t need the planes to travel, or decades-old Air Force One planes will do the job just fine now and in the future, Aboulafia says. Both are “very concerning statements.” \nThis could be an attempt to cut spending from one area of the budget so Trump can pump more money into national defense . \n“This probably just crossed his radar as something that was expensive and not directly related to the war effort,” Aboulafia said. Give Trump some credit \nKIRO Radio’s Dave Ross suggested perhaps we should give Trump the benefit of the doubt. The president-elect is a negotiator, after all. Maybe this is just another example of Trump telling a company that the administration will be hard bargainers. \nAboulafia says if Trump hadn’t announced this on Twitter he might believe that. But Twitter is not the place to do it. \nAnother thing to remember is that the price is the price. There is a basic plan, and then the added costs of installing all kinds of encrypted technologies. \n“Is Boeing getting rich on this deal? No,” Aboulafia said. “Far from it.” Boeing’s statement \nNot long after Trump tweeted his disgust for the price of two new Air Force One planes, Boeing released this statement: \n“We are currently under contract for $170 million to help determine the capabilities of these complex military aircraft that serve the unique requirements of the President of the United States. We look forward to working with the U.S. Air Force on subsequent phases of the program allowing us to deliver the best planes for the President at the best value for the American taxpayer.”",

      "text": "Donald Trump 's Tuesday morning criticism of Boeing ( BA ) closely followed the publication of a story in which the aerospace giant's CEO expressed concerns about the trade agenda Trump has backed. The Chicago Tribune published a column Tuesday morning which included Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg 's recent comments arguing that free trade is a crucial part of the U.S. economy. Boeing has a lucrative jet business in China.\nMuilenburg expressed concerns about resistance to trade, which is partly driven by Trump repeatedly slamming the Trans-Pacific Partnership and North American Free Trade Agreement. Trump appealed to many blue-collar voters by saying those deals cost Americans jobs and depressed their wages.\nOnly 22 minutes after the article published, Trump threatened on Twitter to \"cancel\" Boeing's contract for new Air Force One jets, arguing that an unconfirmed $4 billion cost was too high for the project.\nThere is no clear indication that the Tribune story, or another Washington Post article about Pentagon waste, specifically prompted Trump's attack. Still, he has used his favorite social media platform repeatedly in the past to respond to coverage he views as unfavorable.\nFor instance, Trump has used Twitter to criticize coverage from The New York Times and CNN, among other outlets.\nTrump's tweet moved markets, as Boeing shares fell as much as 1 percent Tuesday before recovering.\nThe Trump transition team did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nMore From CNBC\nTop News and Analysis\nLatest News Video\nPersonal Finance",

      "title": "Trump Criticizes Boeing Deal To Develop New Air Force One",
      "text": "President-elect Donald Trump called for the U.S. government to cancel a deal with Boeing to develop a new Air Force One due to cost concerns.\nARI SHAPIRO, HOST: \nPresident-elect Donald Trump is lashing out again on Twitter, this time at the Boeing Company. He tweeted this morning that customized 747s meant to replace Air Force One are too expensive and the order should be canceled. He spoke to reporters later in the day in the Trump Tower lobby.\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\nDONALD TRUMP: The plane is totally out of control. It's going to be over $4 billion. It's for Air Force One program. And I think it's ridiculous. I think Boeing is doing a little bit of a number. We want Boeing to make a lot of money but not that much money.\nSHAPIRO: Joining us now is NPR's David Schaper in our Chicago bureau. And David, explain why the government is ordering these new airplanes from Boeing and whether they will really cost $4 billion.\nDAVID SCHAPER, BYLINE: Well, first of all, these are two planes in the Air Force One program. There are always two of the jumbo jets that are identical so that the president has access to one while the other is undergoing maintenance. The last order was under President Reagan. And the planes were delivered under the term of the first President Bush in the early '90s.\nThey're designed to last about 30 years. So it is about time for the Air Force to order a new Air Force One planes. The Government Accountability Office, which is the auditing arm of the federal government, estimated that this program should cost about $3.2 billion between 2010 and 2020. So it's not really clear where the president-elect's $4 billion figure comes from.\nSHAPIRO: Whether it's $3.2 or $4 billion over 10 years, it does seem like a lot of money for two airplanes.\nSCHAPER: It does. But Boeing calls these planes really a flying Oval Office. It's got 4,000 square feet of space, a conference room, a medical suite. There's a bedroom. And because these planes can refuel midair, they have an unlimited flying range. All that plus maintaining the aircraft once they're delivered could possibly push up the price tag to or above that $4 billion figure given by the president-elect. But again, neither he nor his staff would say where that figure came from.\nSHAPIRO: What was Boeing's reaction? Is it conceivable that a European conglomerate, Airbus, Boeing's chief competitor, could be in the running to produce Air Force One?\nSCHAPER: I really think that that's almost unthinkable because of politics in the U.S. Boeing has a long history of making the airplanes that fly the American president dating back to the days of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt in the early 1940s. But this latest controversy over the cost of the project did seem to catch the aerospace giant a little bit by surprise.\nIn a statement, The Boeing Company today says that, we are currently under contract for $170 million to help determine the capabilities of these complex military aircraft. So Boeing has not yet been awarded the rest of the money to develop and build the aircraft.\nBut we should note that Air Force One represents a very small portion of the business the company has with the U.S. government. It's a giant government contractor and - with defense and in aerospace and other programs. Boeing's stock price did dip about 1 percent after the president-elect's tweet. But it recovered all of what it had lost, and the stock price just pretty much closed unchanged.\nSHAPIRO: Do you think the president-elect is trying to send a message to Boeing and other government contractors here?\nSCHAPER: You know it's still not really clear what the intent of Mr. Trump's tweet was. But this tweet about out-of-control costs also comes from the president-elect on a day The Washington Post has a story exposing widespread waste and cost overruns at the Pentagon. Whether or not Mr. Trump was adding the new Air Force One as another example of that I can't really say. But his spokesman did allude to that in a conference call with reporters today - that this could be all about government spending. And that's what his supporters - Trump's supporters - want him to get rid of.\nSHAPIRO: That's NPR's David Schaper speaking with us from Chicago. Thanks, David.\nSCHAPER: Thank you, Ari.\n ",

      "title": "Donald Trump's Air Force One Tweet Didn't Spook Boeing's Investors",
      "text": "In the wake of the 2016 election, it might seem cavalier to shrug off a tweet from President-elect Donald Trump, but that’s what Boeing investors did today.\nBoeing’s stock dipped 1% following an early morning tweet from Trump claiming the cost of new Air Force One planes would exceed $4 billion. Calling those costs “ out of order ,” Trump raised the prospect of nixing the deal. He later told reporters , “I think Boeing is doing a little bit of a number. We want Boeing to make a lot of money, but not that much money.”\nBy the afternoon, Boeing’s stock was back in the black in a day of sluggish trading. Investors seemed content to wait to for more clarity on the President-elect’s intentions. As TIME’s Zeke Miller noted, Trump’s team didn’t back up the $4 billion figure and that the tweet may be “a time-honored ploy to demonstrate a desire to cut costs in the bloated Defense Department.”\nFor now, it’s not clear how hard a blow the loss of the Air Force One contract would be for Boeing, if the blow comes at all. Boeing spokesperson Todd Blecher said the company is “currently on contracts totaling approximately $170 million for the initial design and engineering work” needed before production.\nU.S. presidents have been shuttling around on specially-designed aircraft ever since Franklin D. Roosevelt boarded a plane nicknamed the “ Sacred Cow ” in 1944. The manufacturer of that plane is now part of the Boeing family. The current Air Force One aircraft, however, were manufactured in 1990 and are approaching their planned 30-year service life.\nIn January, the Air Force selected Boeing to manufacture three new Air Force Ones based on its 747-8 jets, outfitting them with features like secure communications, defensive capabilities, in-flight refueling, a presidential suite, accommodations for guests and the Secret Service, a medical room, and two galleys that can serve 100 meals. The planes won’t be ready until 2024 or later, which may be why Trump’s tweet pointed out they would be used by “future presidents.”\nShould the order be canceled, the Air Force is left with tough choices. The only other four-engine plane that could meet its requirements for Air Force One is made by France’s Airbus, which declined to make a proposal in 2013. As for Boeing, the impact would be limited. Boeing’s 747-8 planes are priced around $379 million apiece. Bloomberg reported that the Pentagon is budgeting $3.2 billion for R&D and production of Air Force One planes. Spread out over several years, that would amount to a small fraction of Boeing’s $96 billion in annual revenue.\nThe bigger impact for Boeing and other companies may come if a Trump Administration clamps down on defense spending. Defense projects make up less than a third of Boeing’s total revenue and have been flat for the past few years. The bulk of Boeing’s revenue comes from commercial airplanes, which have been a greater source of concern for investors in 2016.\nAfter rising 10% in 2015, Boeing’s commercial airliner revenue fell 2.2% during the first nine months of 2016 to $49 billion. Operating earnings at the division fell 64% to $1.7 billion. Analysts have cited a number of reasons, such as slack demand for wide-body planes like Boeing’s 777 and airlines waiting longer before replacing aging planes.\nIn January, Boeing warned that it would deliver around 745 planes this year, below the record of 762 in 2015. So far, the company has delivered 617 planes . The smaller 737 planes accounted for two thirds of those deliveries. The 787 made up another 19%. The more expensive, wider-body aircraft such as the 777 and 747 saw fewer deliveries.\nWith demand stronger for lower-cost planes, Boeing said earlier this year it would cut 4,500 jobs to rein in costs. The company has recently faced headwinds in other areas, such as United Continental’s decision to defer deliveries of 61 planes and a vote by the House of Representatives to bar the sale of commercial aircraft to Iran. Boeing said in October it had received a license to sell 80 planes to Iran.\nBoeing also said in November that it would cut 500 jobs from its defense operations over two years. For now, investor concerns center on its commercial operations. As for trimming costs on defense projects like Air Force One, Boeing says it can handle them efficiently. CEO Dennis Muilenburg has said Boeing’s deal to sell 737’s for the Navy’s P-8 program came in $2 billion under budget.\nThat kind of budgeting could save Boeing a high-profile deal to keep the U.S. President up in the air, but either way investors have bigger issues with the aerospace giant right now.",

      "title": "Boeing responds after Trump knocks contract for Air Force One jets [Video]",
      "text": "Donald Trump declared Tuesday morning that the Air Force should cancel its contract with Boeing to build two new presidential airplanes, asserting that the agreement had a $4 billion price tag. “Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order!” the president-elect tweeted.\nIt’s not clear how Trump, who frequently tweets exaggerated or baseless claims, arrived at that number. Reuters, citing budget documents, reported that the “budgeted costs for the Air Force One replacement program are $2.87 billion for the fiscal years 2015 through 2021.”\nThe aircraft manufacturing company issued a statement clarifying that it is currently under contract for $170 million to determine the capabilities of the new aircraft.\n“We are currently under contract for $170 million to help determine the capabilities of these complex military aircraft that serve the unique requirements of the President of the United States. We look forward to working with the U.S. Air Force on subsequent phases of the program allowing us to deliver the best planes for the President at the best value for the American taxpayer.”\nThis preliminary process is expected to determine the ultimate cost that the forthcoming Air Force One aircraft will cost taxpayers.\n“Well, the plane is totally out of control,” Trump told reporters in Trump Tower. “It’s going to be over $4 billion for the Air Force One program. And I think it’s ridiculous. I think Boeing is doing a little bit of a number. We want Boeing to make a lot of money, but not that much money.”\nAn Air Force One aircraft at Joint Base Andrews near Washington, D.C. (Photo: Kevin Lamarque/Reuters) More Jason Miller, Trump’s communications director, further told reporters that Trump’s tweet “really speaks to the president-elect’s focus on keeping costs down across the board with regard to government spending.”\nHe continued: “I think people are really frustrated with some of the big price tags that are coming out for programs even in addition to this one. So we’re going to look for areas where we can keep costs down and look for ways where we can save money.”\nThe full details of the new contract have not yet been released, but some of the costs can be attributed to the high-end security and communications demands of a roaming commander in chief.\nA president needs the ability to travel anywhere on the planet quickly and with little notice. The aircraft has unlimited range because it is capable of refueling while airborne. The jet can function as a mobile command center if the U.S. is under attack. It contains sophisticated, secure communications equipment and onboard electronics that can protect against electromagnetic pulses.\nThe term “Air Force One” can be used to describe any aircraft carrying the president, but since the mid-20th century, it became associated with jets specifically equipped for the president. Now the term refers to one of two modified Boeing 747-200B series aircraft.\n“We have many decades of productive relationships with presidential administrations from both political parties and I would expect that we will reach the same point with the Trump administration,” Todd Blecher, a spokesman for Boeing, told Yahoo News.\nAboard Air Force One, White House press secretary Josh Earnest said there are unique technical requirements for the project to ensure that future presidents have upgraded capabilities while representing the United States abroad.\nAs for Trump’s tweet, Earnest said, “I’d refer to my colleagues at the Department of Defense for the particulars of the procurement contract. Some on the statistics that have been, uh, cited, shall we say, don’t appear to reflect the nature of the financial agreement between Boeing and the Department of Defense,” according to a pool report.\nHe said that the current Air Force One is “nearing the end of its projected life” and that future presidents should have a “modern presidential aircraft.”\nA profile on the White House’s website says Air Force One is operated by the Presidential Airlift Group, founded during the administration of Franklin Roosevelt in 1944. The group is part of the White House Military Office.\nRead More \n\n“Air Force One is one of the most recognizable symbols of the presidency, spawning countless references not just in American culture but across the world,” the website reads. “Emblazoned with the words ‘United States of America,’ the American flag, and the Seal of the President of the United States, it is an undeniable presence wherever it flies.”\nKevin W. Buckley, an executive officer at the Air Force Life Cycle Management Center at Wright-Patterson in Ohio, told the Dayton Daily News that it’s become harder to keep Air Force One airborne now that the aircraft are reaching to end of their 30-year life expectancies.\n“The real challenge, and the challenge that is forcing us to buy newer aircraft for the president, is to overcome the fact that there are heroics going on every day to keep the current aircraft flying and it’s becoming way too expensive and way too difficult to do that,” he said to the paper.\nAccording to the Associated Press, the new Air Force One planes would go into use around 2024, so Trump would not use them to travel around the world unless he won a second term.\nDonald Trump arrives in the lobby of Trump Tower in New York to speak to members of the media, Dec. 6, 2016. (Photo: Andrew Harnik/AP) More Trump does have plenty of familiarity with Boeing’s products. While campaigning, he crisscrossed the country in a private Boeing 757 with his last name emblazoned on the sides. As with all things bearing his name, Trump has praised his private jet as being the best of its kind. \nThe Trump Organization released a video gushing about the plane’s Rolls Royce engine, 24-carat gold-plated seat belts and luxury amenities.\nBack in January 2013, Trump tweeted that he was buying stock in Boeing after it had gone “way down.” At the time, the Boeing 787 Dreamliner’s lithium batteries were a widely reported problem.\n“@Boeing stock went way down because of 787 — so I just bought stock in @Boeing — great company!” he wrote.\nHis comments Tuesday seemed to have knocked that stock price down some, but his net worth apparently won’t be affected. “The president-elect sold all of his stock back in June,” Miller, Trump’s spokesman, told Yahoo News on a conference call with reporters.\nAdditional reporting by Hunter Walker.",

      "text": "Contractor Boeing is Trump’s new target By Drew Harwell and Rosalind S. Helderman / The Washington Post Published Dec 7, 2016 at 12:02AM Trump victory rally — President-elect Donald Trump vowed Tuesday night to strengthen the U.S. military but limit its use, suggesting a pullback from areas like the Middle East where the country has spent decades trying to broker a peace between warring interests. “We’ve spent at last count $6 trillion in the Middle East and our roads have potholes all over, our highways are falling apart, our bridges are falling, our tunnels are no good, our airports are horrible,” Trump said at a victory rally in Fayetteville, North Carolina. “We’ve got to start spending on ourselves.” Invoking his “America First” policy, Trump pledged “to only engage the use of military forces when it’s in the vital national interests of the United States.” — Los Angeles Times The turbulence began Tuesday morning with one of President-elect Donald Trump’s signature tweets of wrath: a public jab at Boeing alleging that the cost of building Air Force One had spiraled out of control. That came an hour after Boeing’s chief executive was quoted questioning Trump’s stance on trade. In the afternoon, Trump directed his attention elsewhere, taking credit in a surprise announcement for a Japanese conglomerate’s months-old pledge to invest $50 billion in the United States. In the raucous hours in between, a top Trump aide announced offhandedly that, months before, Trump had sold his entire stock portfolio, which some ethics advisers had worried could raise questions about conflicts of interest during his presidency. It was a day of big pronouncements and few details, leaving many wondering whether this would be the unusual and unpredictable way that Trump will govern when he takes office next month. That style, including his opaque personal financial dealings and his sudden shots at certain companies, has helped unnerve a corporate America that traditionally craves stability. Some business leaders and economists have worried whether executives can speak their minds about the president-elect or his policies without fear of facing Trump’s rage. “Twisting people’s arms is inherently problematic” for a president, said N. Gregory Mankiw, a professor of economics at Harvard who served as chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under President George W. Bush. “The president has so much power, you always wonder if there’s some implicit threat to individuals, and that goes beyond what I think a limited government should do,” Mankiw said. But some defended Trump’s highly visible way of doing business in his transition to the Oval Office. Lanhee Chen, policy director of Mitt Romney’s presidential campaign, who is now at Stanford University’s Hoover Institution, said he was not terribly concerned by Trump’s interactions with individual corporations and chief executives. “I just assume this is what generally happens,” Chen said. “I don’t think it is that unusual for a president to make appeals to specific companies. What may be unusual is the public nature of the communications. But the activity itself is not uncommon” for presidents or for governors, he said. Trump has for months targeted companies that, like his own, have shipped jobs overseas. In a string of early-morning tweets Sunday, he threatened “retribution or consequence” for companies that move operations out of the country, as well as a 35 percent tariff on goods sold back to the United States. Trump’s Boeing slam Tuesday, though, was something new. The president-elect criticized the Chicago-based jet manufacturer, alleging that the costs of its federal contract to build a new Air Force One had, as Trump said, spiraled “out of control.” Trump’s tweets came roughly an hour after the publication of a Chicago Tribune column citing Boeing chief executive Dennis Muilenburg’s suggestion that Trump and Congress “back off from the 2016 anti-trade rhetoric.” Trump’s holdings Trump spokesmen did not explain why he had targeted Boeing and did not provide other details. But they contributed to the confusion, by claiming Tuesday morning that Trump had in June sold a stock portfolio that by last year was worth up to $40 million. The sale of Trump’s shares in big banks, oil conglomerates and other companies with business before the government would have netted Trump millions of dollars during his costly presidential campaign. It also could help him tamp down worries over conflicts of interest between his private holdings and public job. But beyond spokesman Jason Miller’s comments Tuesday to The Washington Post, Trump representatives have not provided records of stock transactions or other details since a financial-disclosure filing released in May. Over the past five months, Trump campaign officials gave no indication of the stock sale. Trump has also refused to release his tax returns, which would provide more detailed information about his financial holdings. As president, Trump will be subject to the Stock Act, a 2012 law that requires elected officials, including the president, to publicly disclose any stock transactions worth at least $1,000 within 45 days. SoftBank By Tuesday afternoon, Trump had taken a new turn, announcing that a Japanese telecommunications firm, SoftBank, had agreed to invest $50 billion in U.S. start-ups, a move he tweeted that the company would never have done “had we (Trump) not won the election!” The president-elect made a brief showing in the gilded lobby of Trump Tower to announce the investment, smiling for the cameras and shaking hands with the firm’s chief executive, Masayoshi Son. The deal, however, is not new. The money will come from a $100 billion joint investment fund Son established in October using money from partners, including Saudi Arabia’s state-owned investment fund. SoftBank has invested in the United States in the past, including paying $22 billion in 2013 for a 80 percent share of Sprint. The firm also led a $1 billion investment round last year in San Francisco-based online lender Social Finance. Trump’s announcements followed his assertion last week that he had saved 1,100 jobs in Indiana through a deal with air-conditioning company Carrier. The agreement, which includes $7 million in state incentives for the company, will actually keep 800 workers in the state, while 600 jobs will still go to Mexico. In an interview Monday with CNBC’s Jim Cramer, the chief executive of Carrier’s parent company confirmed that it had made the deal in part out of fear. “There was a cost as we thought about keeping the Indiana plant open,” United Technologies chief executive Greg Hayes said. “At the same time … I was born at night but not last night. I also know that about 10 percent of our revenue comes from the U.S. government.” After Trump concluded his public events at Carrier on Thursday night, he took on a second company that has announced it is moving jobs from Indiana to Mexico. “Rexnord of Indiana is moving to Mexico and rather viciously firing all of its 300 workers. This is happening all over our country. No more!” he tweeted Friday. Rexnord, which is based in Milwaukee, announced in June that it was closing an Indiana plant, resulting in the loss of 300 jobs. Keith Hennessey, director of the National Economic Council under Bush, warned about the impact of Trump’s approach to business and trade, which he said could do “long-run economic harm to the U.S.” “When a politician rewards his business friends and punishes his business enemies it’s called crony capitalism,” Hennessey wrote in a blog on his personal website Monday. “It creates incentives for other business leaders to spend their time and money trying to get similar political access with elected officials,” Hennessey added. “And a firm leader now knows it can initiate a negotiation with the Trump Administration simply by threatening to outsource jobs.” In his blog, Hennessey urged Trump to stop “trying to tell individual American business leaders how to run their companies.” He said his criticism was aimed at Trump’s maneuvers around Carrier, Rexnord and tariffs, but said he did not want to comment on Boeing. Mankiw, the former Bush economic adviser, said targeting individual companies runs contrary to “equal protection of the law, which is a fundamental principle of fairness,” violating founder John Adams’s contention that the United States should be a nation of laws and not men. 15823903 ",

      "text": "Boeing ( BA ) declared \"victory\" in a dispute with the European Union and Airbus ( EADSY ) even though the World Trade Organization found that Boeing's tax benefit on its new widebody breaks international trade rules.\nThe WTO said Monday that Boeing received illegal state subsidies for its new 777X and should withdraw the subsidy with 90 days. But the U.S. can appeal the ruling.\n\"After any appeal we fully expect Boeing to preserve every aspect of the Washington state incentives, including the 777X revenue tax rate,\" J. Michael Luttig, Boeing's general counsel, said in a statement.\nBoeing said the 777X tax incentive is worth $50 million a year. The EU argued the benefit has provided Boeing with a $5.7 billion subsidy.\nWhile the WTO ruled in favor of the EU on the Washington tax incentive, it rejected six other incentives, prompting Boeing to call the decision a \"complete victory\" for the U.S. and the company.\nBernstein analysts predicted \"little material impact\" on either company from the WTO ruling.\nBoeing shares fell 0.2% to finish at 149.77 on the stock market today , extended more than 7% past a 139.55 saucer base buy point cleared on Oct. 26. Airbus' U.S.-listed shares dipped 0.5% to 15.84.",

      "text": "Trump Tweets Absurd Remark About Air Force One Being Pricey — Boeing’s Response Was PERFECT (VIDEO) 373 \nOn Tuesday, Trump decided to go after Boeing; the U.S. aerospace giant contracted to build two brand new Air Force One planes for future presidents to travel in. \nThe billionaire said that the planes were overpriced and demanded that the company “cancel” the order. Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order! \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 6, 2016 \nLater during a brief interaction with the press at Trump Tower in New York, Trump went a step further and accused the aerospace company of trying to put one over on the U.S. government. \nWhen asked about his tweet, he told reporters that the expenses are; \n“…Totally out of control. It’s going to be over $4 billion on Air Force One … and I think it’s ridiculous. I think Boeing is doing a little bit of a number.” \n“We want Boeing to make a lot of money, but not that much money,’ he added.” \nBoeing released the following response via a much more professional and adult platform, making the Trump look like a complete moron. \n“We are currently under contract for $170 million to help determine the capabilities of these complex military aircraft that serve the unique requirements of the President of the United States. We look forward to working with the U.S. Air Force on subsequent phases of the program allowing us to deliver the best planes for the President at the best value for the American taxpayer.” \nTrump’s supporters will say that he is trying to “make deals” and cut costs for the American people. \nHowever, his ignorance, like in most things, but especially concerning the current contractual details, as well as what goes into making Air Force One, puts him at a strategic disadvantage. \nAir Force One is designed to survive a nuclear war. It’s built with numerous top secret security technologies that understandably raises the cost. \nThey have to be extremely careful while creating such a plane, perhaps even make it in stages so that no one group of workers know too much about the aircraft. It’s going to also require security clearances and background investigations. \nIn other words, a lot of added expenses designed to make sure the POTUS and national security isn’t compromised. \nIt would have only taken Trump a few minutes to do some research into the details of the current arrangement, and he would have learned, for example, that the planes are not expected to be in service until 2024. \nThis episode is yet another example of how Trump tries to spin his ignorance into gold. \nHopefully, the American people will tell him in four years, that his “gold” just doesn’t fly. \nFeatured image via YouTube",

      "text": "Home / News / Trump wants Air Force One order at Boeing cancelled Trump wants Air Force One order at Boeing cancelled December 7, 2016 News , World Leave a comment Republican U.S. presidential nominee Donald Trump attends a campaign rally at the BB&T Center in Sunrise, Florida August 10, 2016. REUTERS/Eric Thayer \nNew York [United States]: U.S. President-Elect Donald Trump wants to cancel an order of Air Force One from Boeing which is being built to carry “future presidents” as it is costing more than $4 billion. \n“Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than USD4 billion. Cancel order!,” the President-Elect said in a tweet. \n“Well the plane is totally out of control. It’s going to be over $4 billion for the Air Force One program,” he said. And I think it’s ridiculous. I think Boeing is doing a little bit of a number. We want Boeing to make a lot of money, but not that much money,” CNN quoted Trump, responding to reporters on the tweet. \nAccording to a Boeing source familiar with the program, it is hard to estimate the cost without knowing all the security features, and even the company cannot estimate the cost of the program at this time, as the government has not informed them about the features it wants in the new Air Force One. \nThe source said that they are even not sure about the number of planes government wants. \nObama’s White House spokesman Josh Earnest said, “The statistics that have been cited [by Trump], shall we say, don’t appear to reflect the nature of the financial arrangement between Boeing and the Department of Defense.” \nBoeing said in an official statement that its current contract allows it “to help determine the capabilities of these complex military aircraft that serve the unique requirements of the President of the United States.” \nA Boeing official said that they were surprised by Trump’s comments and the company got in touch with his team soon after his tweet. \nThe Air Force till now has a budget of USD $2.9 billion through 2021 for two new Air Force Ones and will be replacing the aging pair of blue, white and polished aluminum 747-200Bs which is currently serving the President. \nThe new planes aren’t expected to be ready to fly until 2022. \nDefense Department budget documents say that about USD 93 million have already been spent by the Air Force on preparing to build the new jets. \nThe amount has been included in Boeing’s current contract. \nHowever, the manufacturing is still to begin. \n“We look forward to working with the U.S. Air Force on subsequent phases of the program allowing us to deliver the best planes for the President at the best value for the American taxpayer,” said Boeing’s statement. \nTrump’s spokesman Jason Miller said that President-Elect’s remarks highlights that he’s is looking for ways to cut government costs where he can. \n“The point that the President-elect was making here was that a $4 billion price tag is a very big number, the taxpayers want to make sure we’re seeing absolute accountability and that the government is doing the best to drive costs down,” he said. \nHowever, Earnest informed reporters on Tuesday that the planes need to be upgraded. \nTrump has criticised Boeing, which is country’s largest exporter over its deal to sell commercial jets to Iran and its decision to open a factory in China.

      "title": "Trump on Boeing's Air Force One contract: 'Cancel order!'",
      "text": "By Andrea Shalal and Amy Tennery WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. President-elect Donald Trump urged the government on Tuesday to cancel an order with Boeing Co for a revamped Air Force One - one of the most prominent symbols of the U.S. presidency - saying costs were out of control.\nIt was the latest example of Trump using his podium, often via Twitter messages, to rattle companies and foreign countries as he seeks to shake up business as usual in Washington. Trump, who takes office on Jan. 20, took aim at what he called cost overruns even though the plane is only in development stages.\n\"Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order!\" Trump said on Twitter. It was not immediately clear what prompted the timing of his complaint.\nTrump, who has vowed to use his skills as a businessman to make good deals that benefit American taxpayers, then made a surprise appearance in the lobby of Trump Tower in New York, where he amplified his comments.\n\"The plane is totally out of control. I think it's ridiculous. I think Boeing is doing a little bit of a number. We want Boeing to make a lot of money but not that much money,\" he told reporters.\nBoeing, which has built planes for U.S. presidents since 1943, has not yet begun building the two replacements for the current Air Force One planes, which are scheduled to be in service by 2024.\nBoeing has not yet been awarded the money to build the proposed replacements.\n\"We are currently under contract for $170 million to help determine the capabilities of these complex military aircraft that serve the unique requirements of the President of the United States,\" the company said in a statement.\nBoeing Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg called Trump after his remarks and they had a constructive dialogue, sources familiar with the conversation told Reuters. Muilenburg told Trump the cost of the airplane could be lowered if the U.S. Air Force changed its requirements and the issue would likely be resolved without a major dispute, the sources said.\nNOT A 'VANILLA' JUMBO JET\nThe Air Force, which operates the presidential planes, announced in January 2015 that Boeing's 747-8 would be used to replace the two current presidential planes.\nThe planes can fly direct from Washington to Hong Kong, 1,000 miles (1,600 km) farther than the current Air Force One. They are designed to be an airborne White House able to fly in worst-case security scenarios, such as nuclear war.\nPresident Barack Obama, who flew on the aging Air Force One to Tampa, Florida, on Tuesday, has called the plane one of the best perks of the presidency.\nHis spokesman, Josh Earnest, told reporters on board that the contracting arrangements for replacements were \"rather complicated\" and said the recommendations for upgrades had been made by national security experts.\nThe budgeted costs for the replacement program are $2.87 billion for the fiscal years 2015 through 2021, just on research and development, testing and evaluation, according to budget documents seen by Reuters.\nThe current Air Force plan envisions extensive modifications to a Boeing 747-8 plane, adding military avionics and advanced communications to a self-defense system.\n\"Of course it’s not like buying a vanilla Boeing jumbo jet,\" said defense consultant Loren Thompson, who has close ties to Boeing and other companies.\nA March 2016 report from the Government Accountability Office, the investigative arm of Congress, estimated the cost of the overall program at $3.21 billion, including the purchase of two aircraft.\nBut the GAO estimated the costs for research and development would be lower, at just under $2 billion. If the GAO report used the same Air Force estimate for research and development, then its estimate would be around $4 billion.\nBoeing shares dipped after Trump's tweet but closed up 0.1 percent at $152.24.\nLATEST BROADSIDE\nTrump's broadside against Boeing comes as Washington's business lobbyists are bracing for a wild ride.\nA New York real estate developer, Trump took aim at big corporations during his campaign, saying that they often harmed ordinary Americans by sending jobs abroad.\nSince winning the Nov. 8 election, he has taken credit for pushing United Technologies Corp and Ford Motor Co to backtrack on outsourcing plans.\nTrump’s attack on Boeing was the main topic of discussion at the annual luncheon of the Aerospace Industries Association, where the group’s chief executive, Dave Melcher, urged the new administration to promote trade and bolster the high-paying manufacturing jobs that the $143 billion-a-year sector offers.\nIndustry executives say they are seeing willingness from the Trump team to take another look at export controls that limit exports of U.S. weapons. But in the short term, his tweets and comments on Boeing put defense contractors on notice.\n\"The chilling effect on industry is huge, if you are a contractor,\" said Franklin Turner, a partner specializing in government contracts at law firm McCarter & English.\nBoeing relies on the U.S. military and other arms of the federal government for a significant share of its defense, space and security business which is worth $30 billion a year.\nThe company clashed during the past year with Republicans in Congress over the Export-Import Bank, a federal program Boeing uses to finance sales to certain overseas customers. Boeing executives have also been outspoken supporters of the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal with Asia, which Trump opposed.\n(Additional reporting by Timothy Gardner, Emily Stephenson, Mike Stone, Susan Heavey, Andrea Shalal and Doina Chiacu in Washington; Ayesha Rascoe aboard Air Force One; Steve Holland, Alana Wise, Jeffrey Dastin, and Lewis Krauskopf in New York; Writing by Roberta Rampton and Amanda Becker; Editing by Alistair Bell and Peter Cooney)",

      "text": "View Comments Pic: Bernama KUALA LUMPUR : Boeing projects that more than 500,000 new pilots and technicians will be needed to support the expanding demand for new airplane deliveries over the next two decades. The outlook anticipates the need for 248,000 new commercial airline pilots and 268,000 new technicians through 2035, it declared in its 2016 Boeing Pilot & Technician Outlook for the Asia-Pacific region today.\"We are continuing to see a significant need for new pilots and maintenance technicians in the Asia-Pacific region and across the globe,\" said Sherry Carbary, Vice President, Boeing Flight Services in a teleconference.\"This translates into exciting career opportunities for those interested in the aerospace industry. \"We recognise that to attract a new generation of pilots and technicians, there is a need to inspire and train them in new ways. \"That’s why, Boeing continues to work closely with airlines, regulators, flight schools and other industry groups to develop innovative training methods and courseware,\" she added.She said leading the region in projected demand for new pilots and technicians is China with 111,000 pilots and 119,000 technicians, followed by · Southeast Asia at 62,000 pilots and 67,000 technicians.Other regions which will also continue to see long-term demand in the tens of thousands of pilots and technicians is South Asia needing 41,000 pilots and 39,000 technicians, Northeast Asia (21,000 pilots, 26,000 technicians) and Oceania (13,000 pilots, 17,000 technicians).Carbary said to support the future growth of training, Boeing has been investing in the development of augmented reality and virtual reality-based training solutions.\"When combined with Boeing’s proven training expertise, augmented reality and virtual reality are certainly promising technologies, that can provide both instructor and student with an immersive learning environment,\" said Michael Edwards, General Manager of Boeing Research & Technology – Australia.The Boeing Pilot & Technician Outlook is closely tied to projections for new airplane deliveries around the globe. The demand for new pilots is primarily driven by new airplane deliveries and fleet mix, while new technician demand is primarily driven by fleet growth.As with personnel demand, the Asia-Pacific region also leads the demand for new commercial airplane deliveries over the next 20 years. The region comprises 40 per cent of the global need due to fleet growth in the single-aisle market, driven by low-cost carriers.According to Boeing's 2016 Current Market Outlook, 15,130 new airplanes, valued at US$2.35 trillion, will be needed in the Asia-Pacific region by 2035. -BERNAMA ",

      "text": "Trump may cancel Boeing order for new Air Force One KING 5's Glenn Farley reports. Travis Pittman, KING 7:27 PM. PST December 06, 2016 Air Force One flying over Mount Rushmore. (Photo by USAF) \nPresident-elect Donald Trump says construction of the next Air Force One -- a Boeing 747-8 -- should be canceled due to the costs. \nTrump tweeted Tuesday morning: Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 6, 2016 \n\"The plane is totally out of control. It's going to be over $4 billion for the Air Force One program,\" Trump later said in the lobby of Trump Tower Tuesday. “I think its ridiculous. I think Boeing is doing a little bit of a number. We want Boeing to make a lot of money but not that much money.” \nBoeing released this statement in response. \n\"We are currently under contract for $170 million to help determine the capabilities of this complex military aircraft that serves the unique requirements of the President of the United States. We look forward to working with the US Air Force on subsequent phases of the program allowing us to deliver the best plane for the president at the best value for the American taxpayer.\" \nMultiple reports say the total cost for the new 747-8s would be between $2,7 billion and $3.2 billion. UPDATE: White House says some of Trump's Air Force One statistics don't appear to reflect arrangements between Boeing, Department of Defense \nRelated: History and background of Air Force One The Wall Street Journal reports the two current Air Force One planes, which are heavily-modified 747-200s, are due to reach the end of their designed 30-year lifespan next year. Although Boeing has a contract to begin development on the new versions, it has not yet reached a deal to build the planes. \nKING 5 Aviation Specialist Glenn Farley says Boeing would be paid to build the basic airplane. The rest of the cost would be paid to a contractor who would be hired to make extensive modifications to the plane. \nThe government would not just be buying one but two 747-8s. And they aren't your average passenger jets. They would undergo heavy modifications needed to make the planes into mobile command centers complete with an anti-missile system and countermeasures. \nThe executive director of SPEEA, the union which represents Boeing engineers, tweeted this in response. @Reuters The Presidential airplanes aren't just fancy airplanes. They are mobile Whitehouses hardened to survive WWIII. ",

      "text": "Home » News » Us News » Trump wants Air Force One order at Boeing cancelled Trump wants Air Force One order at Boeing cancelled 2 hours ago | 07-12-2016 | ANI New York [United States], Dec. 7 : U.S. President-Elect Donald Trump wants to cancel an order of Air Force One from Boeing which is being built to carry \"future presidents\" as it is costing more than $4 billion. [NK US] \"Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than USD4 billion. Cancel order!,\" the President-Elect said in a tweet.\"Well the plane is totally out of control. It's going to be over $4 billion for the Air Force One program,\" he said. And I think it's ridiculous. I think Boeing is doing a little bit of a number. We want Boeing to make a lot of money, but not that much money,\" CNN quoted Trump, responding to reporters on the tweet.According to a Boeing source familiar with the program, it is hard to estimate the cost without knowing all the security features, and even the company cannot estimate the cost of the program at this time, as the government has not informed them about the features it wants in the new Air Force One.The source said that they are even not sure about the number of planes government wants.Obama's White House spokesman Josh Earnest said, \"The statistics that have been cited [by Trump], shall we say, don't appear to reflect the nature of the financial arrangement between Boeing and the Department of Defense.\"Boeing said in an official statement that its current contract allows it \"to help determine the capabilities of these complex military aircraft that serve the unique requirements of the President of the United States.\"A Boeing official said that they were surprised by Trump's comments and the company got in touch with his team soon after his tweet.The Air Force till now has a budget of USD $2.9 billion through 2021 for two new Air Force Ones and will be replacing the aging pair of blue, white and polished aluminum 747-200Bs which is currently serving the President.The new planes aren't expected to be ready to fly until 2022.Defense Department budget documents say that about USD 93 million have already been spent by the Air Force on preparing to build the new jets.The amount has been included in Boeing's current contract.However, the manufacturing is still to begin.\"We look forward to working with the U.S. Air Force on subsequent phases of the program allowing us to deliver the best planes for the President at the best value for the American taxpayer,\" said Boeing's statement.Trump's spokesman Jason Miller said that President-Elect's remarks highlights that he's is looking for ways to cut government costs where he can.\"The point that the President-elect was making here was that a $4 billion price tag is a very big number, the taxpayers want to make sure we're seeing absolute accountability and that the government is doing the best to drive costs down,\" he said.However, Earnest informed reporters on Tuesday that the planes need to be upgraded.Trump has criticised Boeing, which is country's largest exporter over its deal to sell commercial jets to Iran and its decision to open a factory in China.",

      "text": "It didn't take too long for President-elect Donald Trump to send a strong message to Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg.\nThe Chicago-based aerospace and defense giant is waiting to see how the incoming Trump administration will affect its business. Such concern especially applies to Trump's foreign policy and its approach to international trade issues with China -- a huge client of Boeing's commercial jet business and a frequent Trump target.\nTuesday morning, Trump shook up Boeing another way by suggesting the U.S. government abandon a deal with Boeing for development of a new Air Force One.\n\"Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order!\" Trump tweeted.\nTrump's singling out a major U.S. company in such an adversarial manner may be unprecedented. While other incoming and sitting presidents have criticized industries, unions and business groups, it's unusual for one to focus on a single company, especially when you consider Boeing is also a contractor tied to the nation's defense industry. But Trump's cost-containment message isn't aimed just at Boeing but at other major defense contractors too, suggests one industry analyst.\nTrump did not provide specifics backing up his claim of cost overruns. A U.S. Government Accountability Office report said the project would run $3.2 billion between 2010 and 2020.\nBoeing plans to replace the two aging 747-200 aircraft that serve as Air Force One with two new, modified 747-8 planes. In a statement issued after the tweet, Boeing said it looked forward to working with the Air Force on the project and delivering the \"best planes for the president at the best value for the American taxpayer.\"\nThis may not be the last brouhaha between Trump and Boeing.\nIn a speech to Illinois manufacturers last week, Boeing's CEO advocated for a measured and drama-free approach to crafting and improving new and current trade agreements.\nWithout naming Trump, Muilenburg noted that concern about trade deals was a 2016 election campaign theme.\n\"Anyone who paid attention to the recent campaigns and the election results realizes that one of the overarching themes was apprehension about free and fair trade,\" he said.\nMaybe Trump's Air Force One salvo is a down-and-dirty response to Muilenburg's suggestion that the new presidential team, and Congress, cool the anti-trade rhetoric.\nOr Trump simply could be fretting about spiraling defense department costs, including Air Force One, and decided to let fly Tuesday morning.\nBy calling out Boeing, Trump also may be sending a pointed message to other government vendors, such as Lockheed Martin, General Dynamics and Raytheon, that he's prepared to fight defense project cost overruns and excesses.\n\"It puts the defense contractors on notice, even if this (Air Force One) is a small program,\" said Chris Higgins, an equity industry analyst at Morningstar who follows the defense and aerospace industries.\nBoeing has produced Air Force One for decades. But it is possible that European aircraft-maker Airbus, which was a contender for the most recent Air Force One contract, could build it too.\nEven more inexplicable is that Trump appears to be a satisfied Boeing customer and investor. His personal jet is a Boeing 757 and he has held shares in the company, even excitingly tweeting about its rising share price.\nWell, Trump still has the plane. But he's divested those Boeing shares, according to his transition team.\nThe power of Trump's personality and social media combined to rattle Boeing's stock price, which dipped by $2 per share, or just over 1 percent, at the opening bell Tuesday, shortly after the president-elect's tweet zipped through cyberspace. Boeing stock regrouped to close at $152.24 per share, basically flat with Monday's close.\nWhatever his intent, Trump is telling Boeing that he's watching, so it better watch out.\nAbout The Writer\nRobert Reed is a Chicago Tribune business columnist.

      "text": "By Bloomberg / Bloomberg | December 7, 2016 : 6:35 PM MYT Translated by Google Translator: Translated by Google Translator: \nNEW YORK (Dec 7): First came Ford and Carrier. Now Boeing and SoftBank are experiencing the power of Donald Trump’s Twitter feed. \nThe president-elect jumped into corporate affairs again on Tuesday, tweeting first to criticize one company and then to hail another. He began at 8.52am New York time by calling out Boeing Co over costs to develop new Air Force One jets. Just over five hours later he celebrated a US$50 billion investment in the US by Japanese telecommunications firm SoftBank Group Corp. \nThe tweets, coming after Trump last week announced a deal with United Technologies Corp to cancel plans to close a US factory, dominated news and moved markets even as details in both cases remained sketchy and the impacts unclear. Trump again showed a willingness to use his bully pulpit to criticize or congratulate companies over actions affecting American workers and government spending. \n“This is extraordinary,” said Mohan Tatikonda, a professor at Indiana University’s Kelley School of Business. “For a president to get involved at the level of spot locations, spot companies, spot plants, is I think unprecedented.” \nStock moves \nThe president-elect’s moves had consequences for the market, with Boeing falling as much as 1.5% before regular trading. The shares rose less than 0.1% to US$152.24 at the close in New York. \nSprint Corp, which is controlled by SoftBank and is the No 4 US wireless carrier, rose 1.5% to US$8.17 at the close. T-Mobile US Inc, which has long been mentioned as a possible merger partner for Sprint, rose 1.8% to US$55.99 on speculation that SoftBank Chief Masayoshi Son’s pledges could aid an eventual deal. \nA president who’s too eager to pick winners and losers may prompt business owners to seek special treatment in Washington instead of focusing on improving operations, said Anne Krueger, an economics professor at Johns Hopkins University’s School of Advanced International Studies. \n“The rule of law is what prevents crony capitalism, and the minute you have the president-elect, politicians or bureaucrats meeting with business owners to dispense special favours it unlevels the playing field,” said Krueger, a former first deputy director of the International Monetary Fund. “We all ought to be screaming now because if we don’t, we’re going to be a third-world country before we know it.” \n‘Cancel order!’ \nTrump’s tweet about Air Force One — “Cancel order!” he said — came days after Boeing Chief Executive Officer Dennis Muilenburg called on him and Congress to ensure that US companies have the tools to compete in a global economy. Trump said costs for the presidential aircraft program could exceed US$4 billion. \nBoeing, the largest US exporter, is currently working under a US$170 million contract “to help determine the capabilities of this complex military aircraft,” spokesman Todd Blecher said in an e-mail. \nBoeing executives told officials on Trump’s transition team that the cost of a new version of Air Force One could be lowered if the government agrees to reduce its technical requirements, Bloomberg News reported. \nThe Pentagon already is budgeting US$3.2 billion for research and development, military construction and acquisition of two of the Air Force One planes through fiscal 2021, said Kevin Brancato, the lead government contracts analyst for Bloomberg Government. Boeing 747-8 planes average about US$225 million each, he said, which means most of the expenses will go to outfitting the planes with special capabilities for presidential use. They include advanced communications and classified defensive abilities that make them flying fortresses. \nBully pulpit \nTrump’s willingness to attack the programme — one of the most visible symbols of the American presidency — and go after specific companies generates uncertainty over the scrutiny government contractors may face under the new administration, said Jeff Windau, an Edward Jones analyst. \n“That’s something that investors are at least taking notice of today,” he said. \nIntervention of this magnitude has little precedent, but past president such as Lyndon Johnson and John F Kennedy were known for such practices. Johnson, for instance, fought inflation and targeted high prices on products as varied as eggs, steel and televisions. \nJohnson’s impact was limited. But he didn’t have Twitter. \n“Mr Trump’s leadership style and communication style is abetted by the social media capabilities we have today,” Tatikonda said. “With Mr Trump we will continue to see different kinds of executive models and ways of leadership than we’ve ever seen before.” \nSoftbank investment \nFollowing a series of meetings on Tuesday with business leaders, the president-elect tweeted that SoftBank will invest in the US and create 50,000 new jobs. Son, CEO of the Tokyo-based telecommunications company, told reporters the funding would go to “new companies, startup companies in the United States.” The money will come from SoftBank’s previously announced US$100 billion technology fund, Bloomberg News reported. \nTrump followed up the tweet with a second saying the company “would never do this had we (Trump) not won the election!” On Sunday, Vice President-elect Mike Pence said on ABC’s “This Week” that Trump would decide whether to intervene with specific companies “on a day-by-day basis”. \nWhile Trump has turned Twitter into a powerful tool, the companies in his sights may not do the same. \n“I know the right answer is not going to be tweet back, so don’t expect us to be doing that,” David Melcher, president and chief executive officer of the Aerospace Industries Association trade group, said after Trump’s Boeing statement. “The president-elect is going to have to decide how he wants to use that tool going forward.” Related Articles",

      "text": "Trump says Air Force One Boeing order should be cancelled Dec 7, 2016 0 21 \nUS President-elect Donald Trump has said he wants to cut government costs by cancelling the order for new planes to carry the American president. \nMr Trump tweeted: “Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order!” \nThe government has a contract with Boeing to build two or more new planes. \nThe White House appeared to cast doubt on the figures quoted by Mr Trump. \n“Some of the statistics that have been cited, shall we say, don’t appear to reflect the nature of the financial arrangement between Boeing and the Department of Defence,” White House spokesman Josh Earnest said. \nThe new planes would enter service around 2024. \nBoeing shares fell more than 1% after the president-elect’s tweet, but recovered most of their losses in afternoon trading. \nMr Trump would not fly on the new planes unless he won a second term in the 2020 election. \nThe president-elect also announced on Tuesday that Japan’s SoftBank has agreed to invest $50bn (£39.4bn) in the US aimed at creating 50,000 new jobs. \nMr Trump revealed the plan after meeting SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son at Trump Tower. \n“Masa said he would never do this had we (Trump) not won the election!” he tweeted. \nMr Trump now uses his own plane, but as president he would travel aboard Air Force One, which is equipped with special safety, defensive and communications equipment. \nHe is known for his admiration of his Trump-branded Boeing 757 jet, boasting to Rolling Stone last year that his aircraft was “bigger than Air Force One, which is a step down from this in every way”. \n“Did you know it was featured on the Discovery Channel as the world’s most luxurious jetliner?” he said at the time. \nThe president-elect told reporters on Tuesday at Trump Tower in New York that Boeing was “doing a little bit of a number” and the cost was “ridiculous”. \n“We want Boeing to make a lot of money, but not that much money,” he added. \nMr Trump’s remarks came after the Chicago Tribune published a column early on Tuesday in which Boeing chief executive Dennis Muilenburg suggested the president-elect roll back his anti-trade rhetoric. \n“If we do not lead when it comes to writing these [trade] rules, our competitors will write them for us,” Mr Muilenburg told the newspaper. \nThe Government Accountability Office estimates that the project’s overall cost will be $3.2bn, a figure that is expected to rise. \nThe US Air Force said it had budgeted $2.7bn for the project, “but expects this number to change”. \nBoeing spokesman Todd Blecher, in a statement, said: “We are currently under contract for $170m to help determine the capabilities of these complex military aircraft that serve the unique requirements of the president of the United States. \n“We look forward to working with the US Air Force on subsequent phases of the programme, allowing us to deliver the best planes for the president at the best value for the American taxpayer.” BBC News TAGS",

      "text": "By Bloomberg / Bloomberg | December 7, 2016 : 6:35 PM MYT Translated by Google Translator: Translated by Google Translator: \nNEW YORK (Dec 7): First came Ford and Carrier. Now Boeing and SoftBank are experiencing the power of Donald Trump’s Twitter feed. \nThe president-elect jumped into corporate affairs again on Tuesday, tweeting first to criticize one company and then to hail another. He began at 8.52am New York time by calling out Boeing Co over costs to develop new Air Force One jets. Just over five hours later he celebrated a US$50 billion investment in the US by Japanese telecommunications firm SoftBank Group Corp. \nThe tweets, coming after Trump last week announced a deal with United Technologies Corp to cancel plans to close a US factory, dominated news and moved markets even as details in both cases remained sketchy and the impacts unclear. Trump again showed a willingness to use his bully pulpit to criticize or congratulate companies over actions affecting American workers and government spending. \n“This is extraordinary,” said Mohan Tatikonda, a professor at Indiana University’s Kelley School of Business. “For a president to get involved at the level of spot locations, spot companies, spot plants, is I think unprecedented.” \nStock moves \nThe president-elect’s moves had consequences for the market, with Boeing falling as much as 1.5% before regular trading. The shares rose less than 0.1% to US$152.24 at the close in New York. \nSprint Corp, which is controlled by SoftBank and is the No 4 US wireless carrier, rose 1.5% to US$8.17 at the close. T-Mobile US Inc, which has long been mentioned as a possible merger partner for Sprint, rose 1.8% to US$55.99 on speculation that SoftBank Chief Masayoshi Son’s pledges could aid an eventual deal. \nA president who’s too eager to pick winners and losers may prompt business owners to seek special treatment in Washington instead of focusing on improving operations, said Anne Krueger, an economics professor at Johns Hopkins University’s School of Advanced International Studies. \n“The rule of law is what prevents crony capitalism, and the minute you have the president-elect, politicians or bureaucrats meeting with business owners to dispense special favours it unlevels the playing field,” said Krueger, a former first deputy director of the International Monetary Fund. “We all ought to be screaming now because if we don’t, we’re going to be a third-world country before we know it.” \n‘Cancel order!’ \nTrump’s tweet about Air Force One — “Cancel order!” he said — came days after Boeing Chief Executive Officer Dennis Muilenburg called on him and Congress to ensure that US companies have the tools to compete in a global economy. Trump said costs for the presidential aircraft program could exceed US$4 billion. \nBoeing, the largest US exporter, is currently working under a US$170 million contract “to help determine the capabilities of this complex military aircraft,” spokesman Todd Blecher said in an e-mail. \nBoeing executives told officials on Trump’s transition team that the cost of a new version of Air Force One could be lowered if the government agrees to reduce its technical requirements, Bloomberg News reported. \nThe Pentagon already is budgeting US$3.2 billion for research and development, military construction and acquisition of two of the Air Force One planes through fiscal 2021, said Kevin Brancato, the lead government contracts analyst for Bloomberg Government. Boeing 747-8 planes average about US$225 million each, he said, which means most of the expenses will go to outfitting the planes with special capabilities for presidential use. They include advanced communications and classified defensive abilities that make them flying fortresses. \nBully pulpit \nTrump’s willingness to attack the programme — one of the most visible symbols of the American presidency — and go after specific companies generates uncertainty over the scrutiny government contractors may face under the new administration, said Jeff Windau, an Edward Jones analyst. \n“That’s something that investors are at least taking notice of today,” he said. \nIntervention of this magnitude has little precedent, but past president such as Lyndon Johnson and John F Kennedy were known for such practices. Johnson, for instance, fought inflation and targeted high prices on products as varied as eggs, steel and televisions. \nJohnson’s impact was limited. But he didn’t have Twitter. \n“Mr Trump’s leadership style and communication style is abetted by the social media capabilities we have today,” Tatikonda said. “With Mr Trump we will continue to see different kinds of executive models and ways of leadership than we’ve ever seen before.” \nSoftbank investment \nFollowing a series of meetings on Tuesday with business leaders, the president-elect tweeted that SoftBank will invest in the US and create 50,000 new jobs. Son, CEO of the Tokyo-based telecommunications company, told reporters the funding would go to “new companies, startup companies in the United States.” The money will come from SoftBank’s previously announced US$100 billion technology fund, Bloomberg News reported. \nTrump followed up the tweet with a second saying the company “would never do this had we (Trump) not won the election!” On Sunday, Vice President-elect Mike Pence said on ABC’s “This Week” that Trump would decide whether to intervene with specific companies “on a day-by-day basis”. \nWhile Trump has turned Twitter into a powerful tool, the companies in his sights may not do the same. \n“I know the right answer is not going to be tweet back, so don’t expect us to be doing that,” David Melcher, president and chief executive officer of the Aerospace Industries Association trade group, said after Trump’s Boeing statement. “The president-elect is going to have to decide how he wants to use that tool going forward.” Related Articles",

      "title": "Air Force One: Was Trump renegotiating contract or punishing Boeing?",
      "text": "To his supporters, President-elect Donald Trump’s Twitter suggestion to cancel the order for the new Air Force One was a sign that Trump planned to cut governmental spending.\nBut if you didn’t see it that way, you weren’t alone.\nCNN’s Jake Tapper tweeted that Trump’s call to tear up the contract came shortly after the Chicago Tribune posted an interview with the CEO of Boeing, Dennis Muilenberg, who expressed support for free trade and noted that the company shipped nearly 200 737s to China last year. Tapper’s tweet led to speculation by the Washington Post and other outlets that Trump, who criticized free trade during the presidential campaign and has called for a 45 percent tariff on Chinese exports, reacted to Muilenberg’s comments by making a statement he knew would hurt Boeing’s stock price. The price fell $2 on Tuesday.\nSome congressional lawmakers said that if Trump could renegotiate the contract and get a better deal, great. But members of the congressional delegation from Washington, where Boeing is headquartered, weren’t pleased .\n\"Replacing the 26-year-old Air Force One aircraft will support good-paying jobs throughout Northwest Washington and is important to ensuring the safety and security of future Presidents. The President-elect's tweet does nothing to change those basic facts,” read a statement from U.S. Sens. Maria Cantwell and Patty Murray, and Rep. Rick Larsen, D-Wash.\nTrump’s tweet was short, but it prompted a flood of fact-checking. The outcome didn’t make Trump look particularly good, considering that he inaccurately suggested Boeing was building a plane (it’s in the design process) and that the cost will cover construction of two planes, not one.\nAerospace industry expert Richard Aboulafia told Seattle’s Morning News that Trump’s take on the issue was “complete madness.”\n“It’s actually what it costs to have two airplanes that can survive a nuclear war and transport the president in times of national emergency, and any other time for that matter,” he said.\nThe Washington Post and others also speculated that Trump’s tweet was the latest indication that he planned to use his private Boeing 757 — the so-called Trump Force One — instead of Air Force One as president. Trump said during the campaign that he planned to make the switch, but those who think he plans to do so and then charge the government to use the plane should be aware that apparently it would require him to upgrade his plane with expensive security features like a missile avoidance system and special shielding from nuclear blasts.\nTrump’s plane is outfitted with such luxury appointments as a movie theater, a silk-lined master bedroom and 24-karat gold seatbelt fasteners.\nSpeaking of protecting Trump , the Air Force One flap came on the same day that some New York congressional delegates revealed they were seeking $35 million in federal funding to reimburse the state for providing security to the president-elect. Several House Democrats sent a letter urging New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio and New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo not to pay for extra security that Trump will need in New York after being sworn in. Trump’s wife, Melania, and son, Barron, are expected to continue living in New York City until the boy gets out of school.\n\"Should the President-Elect choose to maintain two permanent residences for his family, it is reasonable to request he reimburse the city and the state for all additional security expenses from his own significant personal financial resources,\" said the letter.",

      "text": "12/07/16 AT 5:56 AM Close \nU.S. President-elect Donald Trump seems to have crossed swords with Boeing over the production of Air Force One 747 aircraft. Trump tweeted Tuesday that the plane could cost more than $4 billion, alluding that the airline company may be taking advantage of the United States. \nTrump also suggested that the Air Force One program should be canceled because of the cost. \"Cancel order!\" he remarked in one of his tweets. \n“Well, the plane is totally out of control. It’s going to be over $4 billion for [the] Air Force One program,\" the 70-year-old said Tuesday. “And I think it’s ridiculous. I think Boeing is doing a little bit of a number. We want Boeing to make a lot of money, but not that much money.” \nFollowing Trump’s comments, the White House clarified that the Air Force One cost cited by the president-elect did not correlate with the arrangements made between Boeing and the Department of Defense. \nIt should be noted that Trump’s tweet came 22 minutes after the Chicago Tribune published a story quoting Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg who expressed concerns over Trump’s trade views at a speech Friday. \nMeanwhile, the Republican has credited himself with two deals — Carrier and SoftBank — since he won the presidential election last month. It remains to be seen whether Trump will negotiate a deal with Boeing as well. \nIn February, Carrier had said that it was likely to move 2,100 jobs to Mexico due to increasing cost. The following month, Trump said during his presidential campaign that he would intervene and stop the outsourcing if he's elected as the president. \nLast Thursday, Trump announced at a Carrier plant in Indiana that he had reached a deal with the firm’s parent company United Technologies to keep the plant’s some 1,000 jobs. The deal was reached by giving the company a $7 million tax break.

According to the poll, 60 percent of the respondents said they have a favorable view of Trump after Carrier decided to keep some manufacturing jobs at its Indiana plant. A little over half of the voters also said that it was OK for the president and the vice president to “negotiate with individual private companies on a case-by-case basis,” Politico reported. \nThe poll was carried out last Thursday and Friday after the deal was announced.

      "text": "New York: Donald Trump has called for Boeing to lose its contract to build Air Force One, the president’s private airplane, citing what he claimed was a $4 billion (Dh14.7 billion) price tag.\n“Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order!” Trump wrote on Twitter.\nSpeaking to journalists in the lobby of Trump Tower, the President-elect elaborated on his Twitter post: “The plane is totally out of control. It’s going to be over $4bn for Air Force One programme and I think it’s ridiculous,” he said. “I think Boeing is doing a little bit of a number. We want Boeing to make a lot of money, but not that much money.”\nTrump’s statements briefly sent Boeing’s share price into a tailspin. Shares dropped more than $1 before recovering. Boeing issued a statement shortly after Trump’s remarks: “We are currently under contract for $170m to help determine the capabilities of these complex military aircraft that serve the unique requirements of the President of the United States,” spokesman Todd Blecher wrote on Boeing’s website. The $4bn number is believed to come from an analysis by a Washington thinktank, the Centre for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS).\n“We look forward to working with the US Air Force on subsequent phases of the programme allowing us to deliver the best planes for the President at the best value for the American taxpayer.”\nThe statement and the share price fall also reopened the debate on Trump’s opaque finances. In January 2013, Trump tweeted that he had bought Boeing’s stock after issues with its 787 Dreamliner had hurt its share price. “.@Boeing stock went way down because of 787 — so I just bought stock in @Boeing- great company!” he wrote.\nTrump mentioned the company twice more in 2013, saying he preferred the 757 to the Dreamliner and opining the same day that Boeing should deal with faulty battery problems troubling the latter airplane.\nTrump owned between $50,001 and $100,000 of Boeing stock as of his May 2016 financial disclosure. In July 2015, his campaign stated that he had sold shares in the company in January 2014 for a gain of $3,964,948, according to a press release. Trump’s diverse financial holdings are unusual for an American President-elect. In the release detailing his stock dealings, his then spokesman Corey Lewandowski said that the required FEC report “was not designed for a man of Mr Trump’s massive wealth”.\nDuring a call with the transition team on Tuesday morning, communications director Jason Miller was asked about the movement in Boeing’s share price and said the President-elect had sold all of his stock “back in June”.\nMiller said that Trump’s issues with the Boeing order would be dealt with after his inauguration next month. The post “really speaks to the President-elect’s focus on keeping costs down across the board”, Miller said.\nWhile the President-elect’s team has clearly stated that he has sold his individual holdings, it is unknown whether Trump holds Boeing stock in other investment vehicles. His refusal to release his tax records makes it difficult to assess the full extent of any potential conflicts of interest that will come with his presidency.\nThe President-elect could show brokerage statements and trade confirms to demonstrate that he had sold his stake — like a bank account, it would show all the relevant information. The Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation (DTCC), which holds stock certificates, would also issue paper certificates showing the transfers at Trump’s request. With respect to his individual tax returns, Trump has broken with tradition by refusing to hand them over to the public. His stated reason is that the returns are currently under audit, but the Internal Revenue Service has said repeatedly that the presence of an audit has no bearing on whether Trump is allowed to release his tax information.",

Mr Trump campaigned as an outsider who would use his deal-making skills to upend Washington. Yesterday he said he had cajoled a Japanese billionaire, Masayoshi Son of SoftBank, into investing $50 billion in the US to create 50,000 jobs. \nHowever, his apparent readiness to use the bully pulpit of the presidency to intervene in the business world has unnerved his party’s leadership.

      "text": "Your are here » Home » America Trump wants Boeing's Air Force One contract canceled By Reuters Updated Wed, December 7th 2016 at 13:30 GMT +3 SHARE THIS ARTICLE Air Force One \nU.S. President-elect Donald Trump urged the government on Tuesday to cancel an order with Boeing Co for a revamped Air Force One - one of the most prominent symbols of the U.S. presidency - saying costs were out of control. \nIt was the latest example of Trump using his podium, often via Twitter messages, to rattle companies and foreign countries as he seeks to shake up business as usual in Washington. Trump, who takes office on Jan. 20, took aim at what he called cost overruns even though the plane is only in development stages. \n\"Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order!\" Trump said on Twitter. It was not immediately clear what prompted the timing of his complaint. \nTrump, who has vowed to use his skills as a businessman to make good deals that benefit American taxpayers, then made a surprise appearance in the lobby of Trump Tower in New York, where he amplified his comments. \n\"The plane is totally out of control. I think it's ridiculous. I think Boeing is doing a little bit of a number. We want Boeing to make a lot of money but not that much money,\" he told reporters. \nBoeing, which has built planes for U.S. presidents since 1943, has not yet begun building the two replacements for the current Air Force One planes, which are scheduled to be in service by 2024. READ MORE A great America bad for Africa's growth \nBoeing has not yet been awarded the money to build the proposed replacements. \n\"We are currently under contract for $170 million to help determine the capabilities of these complex military aircraft that serve the unique requirements of the President of the United States,\" the company said in a statement. \nBoeing Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg called Trump after his remarks and they had a constructive dialogue, sources familiar with the conversation told Reuters. Muilenburg told Trump the cost of the airplane could be lowered if the U.S. Air Force changed its requirements and the issue would likely be resolved without a major dispute, the sources said. \nNOT A 'VANILLA' JUMBO JET \nThe Air Force, which operates the presidential planes, announced in January 2015 that Boeing's 747-8 would be used to replace the two current presidential planes. \nThe planes can fly direct from Washington to Hong Kong, 1,000 miles (1,600 km) farther than the current Air Force One. They are designed to be an airborne White House able to fly in worst-case security scenarios, such as nuclear war. \nPresident Barack Obama, who flew on the aging Air Force One to Tampa, Florida, on Tuesday, has called the plane one of the best perks of the presidency. \nHis spokesman, Josh Earnest, told reporters on board that the contracting arrangements for replacements were \"rather complicated\" and said the recommendations for upgrades had been made by national security experts. \nThe budgeted costs for the replacement program are $2.87 billion for the fiscal years 2015 through 2021, just on research and development, testing and evaluation, according to budget documents seen by Reuters. \nThe current Air Force plan envisions extensive modifications to a Boeing 747-8 plane, adding military avionics and advanced communications to a self-defense system. \n\"Of course it’s not like buying a vanilla Boeing jumbo jet,\" said defense consultant Loren Thompson, who has close ties to Boeing and other companies. \nA March 2016 report from the Government Accountability Office, the investigative arm of Congress, estimated the cost of the overall program at $3.21 billion, including the purchase of two aircraft.

      "text": " \nNEW YORK (CNNMoney) — Donald Trump wants to cancel government plans to build two new Air Force One jets.\nThe president-elect said in a tweet Tuesday that the new Boeing 747 jet that’s being built to carry “future presidents” already costs more than $4 billion, and that he wants to cancel the order.\n“Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order!”\nBoeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order!\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 6, 2016 \n\nAsked by reporters Tuesday morning about the tweet, Trump responded, “Well the plane is totally out of control. It’s going to be over $4 billion for [the] Air Force One program,” he said. “And I think it’s ridiculous. I think Boeing is doing a little bit of a number. We want Boeing to make a lot of money, but not that much money.”\nTrump did not say why he believes the planes will cost “more than $4 billion.” Boeing says it currently has an Air Force One contract worth $170 million.\nA Boeing source familiar with the program told CNN that not even the company can estimate the cost of the program at this time, since “the Pentagon has not even decided all the bells and whistles it wants on the new Air Force One.”\nWithout knowing all the security features it is hard to estimate the cost, the source added, and the Air Force isn’t even sure whether it wants two or three of the planes.\n“We are not sure where he is getting that number from,” said the Boeing official.\n“The statistics that have been cited [by Trump], shall we say, don’t appear to reflect the nature of the financial arrangement between Boeing and the Department of Defense,” said Obama White House spokesman Josh Earnest.\nIn an official statement, Boeing said that its current contract allows it “to help determine the capabilities of these complex military aircraft that serve the unique requirements of the President of the United States.”\nThe company was caught completely off guard by Trump’s comments and contacted the president-elect’s team soon after his tweet, a Boeing official told CNN.\nSo far the Air Force has budgeted $2.9 billion through 2021 for two new Air Force Ones. They’ll replace the aging pair of blue, white and polished aluminum 747-200Bs currently serving the President.\nThe new planes aren’t expected to be ready to fly until 2022. The Air Force has already spent about $93 million preparing to build the new jets, according to Defense Department budget documents. That $93 million is included in Boeing’s current contract. Manufacturing has yet to begin.\n“We look forward to working with the U.S. Air Force on subsequent phases of the program allowing us to deliver the best planes for the President at the best value for the American taxpayer,” said Boeing’s statement.\nTrump’s comment emphasizes that he’s looking for ways to cut government costs where he can, according to his spokesman Jason Miller.\n“The point that the President-elect was making here was that a $4 billion price tag is a very big number, the taxpayers want to make sure we’re seeing absolute accountability and that the government is doing the best to drive costs down,” he said.\nBut Earnest told reporters aboard Air Force One Tuesday that the planes need to be upgraded.\n“This Air Force One that we’re currently flying on is in great shape, thanks to the skilled professionalism of the men and women in the United States Air Force,” Earnest said. “It is, however, an aircraft that is nearing the end of its projected life.”\nThe two Air Force One jets currently in use were ordered by President Reagan — the interiors were selected by Nancy Reagan — and were delivered in 1990 during George H.W. Bush’s administration. Both are getting increasingly expensive to fly and maintain.\nThe Air Force has yet to place a formal order for the new planes. It has chosen the latest version of Boeing’s jumbo jet, the 747-8, as the platform for the new Air Force One planes. The list price for a basic 747-8 is about $378.5 million.\nA team of engineers and aircraft machinists would then add state of the art communications, missile avoidance systems, inflight refueling, VIP interior and protections from the electromagnetic pulse of a nuclear blast. That takes years to do and adds hundreds of millions of dollars to the cost.\nBoeing builds the 747 at its factories in Washington state, and it currently has a large back order for its commercial jets, especially the 787 Dreamliner. Airlines regularly cancel orders for planes, although it would be a loss of both prestige as well as billions in revenue should the Air Force drop plans to build a new version of Air Force One.\nThe current planes have 4,000 square feet of interior floor space. The 747-8 is a longer and more spacious version of the current version, and features four General Electric engines. Those expand its range by 1,000 miles thanks to considerably better fuel economy than the 1970s-era engines used on the current Air Force Ones.\nBoeing’s first presidential plane was used by Franklin Roosevelt back in 1943, and it has made every Air Force One since President John Kennedy.\nBoeing is the nation’s largest exporter. But it has recently been criticized by Trump for both its deal to sell commercial jets to Iran and its decision to open a factory in China to finish passenger cabins on planes purchased by Chinese airlines.\nRecently retired Boeing CEO Jim McNerney was named just last week to an all-star team of corporate executives who will advise Trump on jobs and the economy.\nShares of Boeing were slightly lower after Trump’s comment.\nTrump held between $50,000 to $100,000 worth of Boeing stock, according to a financial disclosure from June of this year. But Trump spokesman Miller said Tuesday that he sold all his publicly-traded stock that same month.\nIn January of 2013, when the Boeing 787 Dreamliner was grounded by problems with its batteries, Trump tweeted that he had bought just bought stock in Boeing at depressed prices, calling it a “great company!”",

      "text": "Boeing's falling share prices earlier this year were caused by an overreaction. \nBoeing shares have more or less followed the path I expected. \nFor 2017 I do not expect another opportunity for 50% gains. Year-to-date Boeing (NYSE: BA ) shares have moved very little, yet the smarter investor has been able to book an easy 50% gain on Boeing this year. In this article I will not only look back at how you could have made that easy 50% gain, but also why it happened and how it stacks against my earlier expectations for Boeing share prices and what I expect for 2017. I am currently polling interest for a premium research service on Seeking Alpha focusing on the aerospace sector. Are you interested? Let me know here . Click to enlarge Buying opportunity Shares of Boeing have hardly moved compared to the first trading day of 2016, having won just 5% compared to the Dow Jones (NYSEARCA: DIA ) gaining 10%. So first of all it is important to look at where the main entry point was this year. In the first weeks of January Boeing shares started to sell off in anticipation of the FY15 results. That sell-off already brought down share prices over 10%. After Boeing provided a disappointing guidance for 2016 the stock tanked 9% on a single trading day and investors started to question Boeing's ability to increase returns to investors. In less than a month the stock lost almost 18% of its value and it did not stop there. Early in February Boeing shares set a new 52-week low at $102.10 as the news broke that the company's accounting practices for the Dreamliner and Boeing 747 program were under investigation. After the 9% drop I penned an article in which I looked at the guidance and concluded that the drop was not justified due to the higher guidance for cash flow. Following the 11% drop I wrote another article and concluded that based on the P/E ratio Boeing was undervalued by at least 25%. Taking out the sting After the fear for a multi-billion charge, investors and analysts seem to start realizing that rather than taking a multi-billion charge Boeing could also extend its accounting block size on the Dreamliner program. In the months after Boeing moved more or less sideways between $125-$135 with the top side of the band being close to my projected target of $138. At that time, I also figured that Boeing itself had no near term catalyst to make it worthwhile investment at that point and put price range of $140-$150 for Boeing 2016 and $161 in a bullish market. A small PR trick set Boeing shares higher after its third quarter earnings presentation, where investors were reassured that the company could decrease production for its Boeing 777 while keeping its cash flow growing. With that statement, Boeing really took out the sting and it paved the road towards higher share prices. The run up was amplified as Donald Trump became the President-Elect which sparked hopes on higher budgets that Boeing could possibly benefit from as well as lower taxes. The election of Trump set share prices at the current $150+ level. What will move share prices A thing you could ask yourself is what will move share prices upward. Currently the sentiment on the market is fairly positive. In combination with an end of year rally Boeing could hit $160, a price that I previously attached as a reasonable price target in a bullish market. Share prices could continue their way up as Boeing increases dividend and continues repurchasing shares. Boeing's 2017 guidance will be a moment where the stock prices will be given a new impulse. 2017 will not be an exciting year for Boeing with revenues being roughly flat, but the jet maker is likely to see cash flow and earnings increase. Based on Boeing's current cash flow multiples and share repurchase program I think Boeing shares prices should be able to hit $167. Shares could gain even more if the jet maker books good progress in reducing its deferred balance for the Boeing 787 program, which affects its cash flow and makes decision on the expansion of its narrow body product line. Conclusion The 50% gain that some investors booked on Boeing shares are a result of a nice entry point caused by bad news coupled with an overreaction and properly analyzing the stock's valuation . The rational investors have been able to buy at the right time looking at simple metrics such as the price-earnings ratio. Boeing shares have more or less followed the path that I outlined and even have been beating my expectations after the election of Donald Trump. Looking at the current forward price-earnings ratio I think Boeing is now fairly valued, but an end of year rally could push Boeing shares towards the $160 level. In December Boeing is likely to announce a dividend increase, which will attract investors but I do not expect firework for 2017. The jet maker has to make some important decisions on key programs and developments in 2017, which are more likely to affect share prices. Passive increases in share prices come from increasing free cash flow coupled with share repurchases. More active price movement can be expected as the jet maker works its way through the deferred balance on the Dreamliner program, but another 50% gain is unlikely. Price movements in the range of 10%-15% are more realistic for Boeing in my view. In the end the aerospace industry remains rather boring, but it is important to properly weigh the guidance and detect the right entry point and keep looking what there still is to gain.
