      "text": "Luke Cage Is Getting a Second Season from Marvel and Netflix Sunday Dec 4, 2016 at 12:01 AM Dec 4, 2016 at 7:26 PM TV Guide \nMarvel and Netflix's superhero show Luke Cage reportedly broke the internet when it launched back in September. And now, the studio (and network) are getting ready to break the internet again. As just announced with a short teaser video on Twitter, Luke Cage is returning to Harlem for a second season of fighting crime. \nThe video is right in line with most of Marvel/Netflix's teasers and announcements: a short animation, some news, and that's it. In this case, it's a slow push-in on Pop's Barber Shop, a key location in the first season, as well as the reveal of a neon sign that says \"Season 2 Coming Soon.\" \nThat's it. Always forward. #LukeCage pic.twitter.com/4pnu52KFKr — Luke Cage (@LukeCage) December 4, 2016\nWhat's most interesting to fans about the teaser is that the finale left Pop's Barber Shop destroyed (again), with the cast wondering what they could do with the location. Could Luke (Mike Colter) return to Harlem -- after being taken back to jail in the finale -- in order to bring new life to his mentor's shop? Or is it just a case of finding something simple to sell the idea of Season 2? \nWhatever happens, most likely we won't find out what'll happen with Cage and company until after the launch of the superhero mash-up Marvel's The Defenders, which teams Cage with fellow NYC based heroes Daredevil (Charlie Cox), Iron Fist (Finn Jones), and Jessica Jones (Krysten Ritter), as well as basically every other character who has ever appeared in a Marvel/Netflix series. \nTime to grab a cup of coffee and find out what's next... \nOther Links From TVGuide.com Marvel's Luke CageMike Colter About Us",

      "text": "Sweet Christmas, \" Luke Cage \" is going to be sticking around for a while. On Sunday, Netflix tweeted out a neat and subtle video clip that zoomed in on a neon sign hanging in the window of Pop's Barber Shop. The sign lit up to read: \"Season 2 Coming Soon.\"\nThe first 13-episode season of the series about the Marvel comic hero, which stars Mike Colter as Cage, was released on Netflix on September 30. There's no word yet on when the second season will be available.\nSome fans celebrated the news as a holiday gift come early.\nBut even though no date was announced, some fans were fearing it might be a while.\nMarvel Comics-based shows have done well for Netflix recently, with \" Jessica Jones \" being renewed for a second season and \" Daredevil \" for a third. A new Marvel series, \" Iron Fist ,\" is coming to Netflix March 17, 2017, and another new series, \" The Defenders ,\" will arrive some time in 2017.\n ",

A release date for \"Luke Cage\" Season 2 was not announced on Sunday. \nSeason 1 of \"Luke Cage\" was well received by critics and fans alike. In her review, Variety's Maureen Ryan said, \"Nothing is cooler than watching bullets bounce off Luke Cage as he brings the ruckus and schools all the fools.\" \nMike Colter plays the titular bulletproof superhero in \"Luke Cage,\" which also starred Rosario Dawson, Mahershala Ali, Simone Missick, Theo Rossi, and Alfre Woodard. Colter will also star in \"The Defenders,\" along with Charlie Cox, Krysten Ritter, and Finn Jones. More Coverage ",

      "title": "What's New on Netflix in December, and Our Top 5 Picks",
      "text": "White Rabbit Project, For the Love of Spock, and More on Netflix in December Reddit \nNetflix’s November line-up included its most expensive series to date – a portrait of the longest-in-power Queen Elizabeth II in The Crown. December doesn’t have anything that ambitious, but if you’re looking for something to occupy yourself while you curl up during the onset of winter, there’s enough to go around until the New Year rolls by. \nSo without further ado, we present our five guaranteed-good picks for this month, and the full list of movies and TV shows coming to Netflix India after that. \nWhite Rabbit Project: Season 1 / December 9 Mythbusters may have aired its final episode earlier this year, but three of its hosts – Kari Byron, Tory Belleci and Grant Imahara aka The Build Team – are back with their own show on Netflix. It’s going to “investigate” everything in the popular domain – be it jailbreaks (not the iPhone kind), technology for superpowers, heists, and science and history topics. \nFor the Love of Spock / December 2 For most Star Trek fans, Spock is one of those enduring characters, thanks largely to the fantastic work of Leonard Nimoy, who passed away last year . He not only gave life to an iconic gesture (the Vulcan salute), but also acted out his words – he lived long and prospered. In this new documentary, his son Adam Nimoy explores what made him so special, by sitting down and talking to everyone who worked alongside him in the Trek universe – from William Shatner to JJ Abrams. \nTravelers: Season 1 / December 23 A sci-fi show made in Canada, Travelers involves a very different form of time travel compared to the generally accepted version. Here, humans have figured out how to “send consciousness” back through time into other people, and with humanity facing a terrible future, these people not only have to live someone else’s lives, but also save us all from certain doom. \nBarry / December 4 We’ve witnessed Barack Obama in the public spotlight for the past eight years, but have you wondered what defined him as a person? That’s what Vikram Gandi’s newest film – Barry – explores, picking up in the fall of 1981 when Obama, known to his friends as “Barry”, arrived at Columbia University to further his education, while having to juggle strained relationships with his Kansas mother, Kenyan father, and classmates. \nFauda / December 2 Set amidst the on-going Israeli-Palestinian conflict, Fauda (the Arabic word for chaos) shows that troubling story from both sides. On the Israeli front, there’s Doron – part of an undercover unit – who’s operating in Palestinian territories and hunting down a Hamas activist. On the opposite, there’s Abu-Ahmed (the activist in question) and his family, whose hatred for Israel grows with every passing day. Fauda won six awards at the Israeli Oscars in June, and the first season is now available on Netflix. \nComedy A Case of You (2013) / December 1Merry Kissmas (2015) / December 1The 10 Year Plan (2014) / December 1The Last Five Years (2014) / December 1 Minami-kun no Koibito (My Little Lover): Season 1 (2015) / December 1Rainbow Time (2016) / December 1Rezeta (2012) / December 3Reggie Watts: Spatial (2016) / December 6Fuller House: Season 2 (2016 – Present) / December 9 \nDrama A Little Bit of Heaven (2011) / December 1The Assailant (2009) / December 1Zero Point (2014) / December 1Too Late (2015) / December 1My Week with Marilyn (2011) / December 1Back to 1989: Season 1 (2016 – Present) / December 1Desert Dancer (2014) / December 1How Sarah Got Her Wings (2015) / December 1The Spirit of Christmas (2015) / December 1The Good Wife: Season 7 (2009 – 2016) / December 1Mercenary (2016) / December 4Other People (2016) / December 8Club de Cuervos: Season 2 (2015 – Present) / December 9Medici: Masters of Florence: Season 1 (2016 – Present) / December 9Barry (2016) / December 16Bitten: Season 1-3 (2014 – Present) / December 30 \nAction Code of Honor (2016) / December 1Sherlock Holmes (2009) / December 1Undisputed 3: Redemption (2010) / December 1Undisputed 2: Last Man Standing (2006) / December 1Double Vision (2002) / December 3 \nSci-fi",

      "text": "Luke Cage Is Getting a Second Season from Marvel and Netflix Sunday Dec 4, 2016 at 6:00 AM Dec 4, 2016 at 7:26 PM TV Guide \nMarvel and Netflix's superhero show Luke Cage reportedly broke the internet when it launched back in September. And now, the studio (and network) are getting ready to break the internet again. As just announced with a short teaser video on Twitter, Luke Cage is returning to Harlem for a second season of fighting crime. \nThe video is right in line with most of Marvel/Netflix's teasers and announcements: a short animation, some news, and that's it. In this case, it's a slow push-in on Pop's Barber Shop, a key location in the first season, as well as the reveal of a neon sign that says \"Season 2 Coming Soon.\" \nThat's it. Always forward. #LukeCage pic.twitter.com/4pnu52KFKr — Luke Cage (@LukeCage) December 4, 2016\nWhat's most interesting to fans about the teaser is that the finale left Pop's Barber Shop destroyed (again), with the cast wondering what they could do with the location. Could Luke (Mike Colter) return to Harlem -- after being taken back to jail in the finale -- in order to bring new life to his mentor's shop? Or is it just a case of finding something simple to sell the idea of Season 2? \nWhatever happens, most likely we won't find out what'll happen with Cage and company until after the launch of the superhero mash-up Marvel's The Defenders, which teams Cage with fellow NYC based heroes Daredevil (Charlie Cox), Iron Fist (Finn Jones), and Jessica Jones (Krysten Ritter), as well as basically every other character who has ever appeared in a Marvel/Netflix series. \nTime to grab a cup of coffee and find out what's next... \n  Marvel's Luke CageMike Colter About Us",

      "text": "Netflix And Pill? Emerging Technologies Are Radically Directing The Future Of Film December 02, 2016 at 07:16AM By Scott Wardell , writer at Creators.co Copy Editor at MP. It never gets easier, you just go faster. \nFilmmaking #technology is advancing at an exponential rate, continually edging closer to indiscernibly lifelike graphics and near perfect sound quality — all aimed at improving our cinematic experience and bridging the gap between reality and fiction. While media companies are seeking to further immerse audiences in movies with new technology, we as viewers are also affecting new approaches to #filmmaking , radically changing the future landscape of film and TV as we know it. New Film Mediums Mean New Approaches To Filmmaking Netflix And Pill \nNetflix CEO Reed Hastings dropped a rather quizzical bombshell on attendees at the 2016 Wall Street Journal WSJD conference when he highlighted what he believes to be the future of entertainment media. According to Hastings, the entertainment industry will move in a new direction, one where traditional forms of media like film and TV will be \"substituted\" for new forms of entertainment. One potential substitute for movies? Netflix's @reedhastings muses on the \"pharmacological,\" like a pill that entertains you. #WSJDLive \nOne such substitute, he claims, would be \"pharmacological,\" seemingly suggesting that companies like #Netflix could potentially offer a branded drug that would act as your \"entertainment.\" Nothing worth watching on the streaming service? Just pop a Netflix pill and chill. Chill Pills \nNow, while this is likely a passing comment meant to highlight the company's need to remain relevant as the industry changes (RIP Blockbuster), it's still a pretty revolutionary idea to consider. Taking the idea of consumable media to a literal level, this could see a new level of interaction between the traditional viewer (now, consumer) and media studios. Drugs as a form of entertainment is hardly a new concept, but the idea of a major company offering users a branded drug as a way to spend an evening is more reminiscent of a sci-fi dystopian nightmare than reality. \nMoving away from augmenting our reality, some filmmakers are exploring the realm of virtual reality as a new medium for film. The Virtual Reality (VR) Experience \nGoogle #VR filmmaker Jessica Brillhart has been an active participant in the VR revolution since 2009, speaking at tech conferences, creating her own VR videos and publishing her findings across multiple platforms. Brillhart has pioneered much of what we know about VR filmmaking. Speaking at the Google I/O conference in May 2016, Brillhart provided brilliant insight into what she believes to be the next step in filmmaking. What we're seeing is how new ways of experiencing film are changing the way that films are crafted. \nVirtual reality is changing the way we view film. The shift from a 2D world to a 3D world means that instead of composing a linear sequence of frames that tells a story (as in traditional cinema), filmmakers must craft entire \"worlds,\" where the frame is all-encompassing the viewer. In this sense, narrative (or story) takes a back seat in this predominately visual medium. \nVR places participants in an experiential world, effectively turning the viewer into a camera. However, unlike traditional cameras, which exist outside the scope of what's on screen, viewers are immersed in the scene as it becomes the interactive world around them. 'Suicide Squad' BTS [Credit: Samsung Mobile USA] \nWhat we're seeing is how new ways of experiencing film are changing the way that films are crafted. More specifically, traditional editing processes are forced to be reexamined to reflect this new viewing experience. \nAs Brillhart explains: \n\"Editing in VR can't be frame to frame. Instead of frame to frame, we think of it as world to world. And now [we] can see the potential for everything, where the frame is everywhere. Our jobs as creators are to guide visitors through a crafted universe.\" \nThe question here is: How can filmmakers transition from scene to scene (or, world to world) without interrupting the in-world experience for the viewer? Brillhart approaches this idea by identifying viewers as the camera and then creating large set pieces populated with what she calls POI — points of interest. \nPOI are moments or images in the virtual world that draw the attention of the viewer. These areas of focus are hugely important in VR because they become the gateways through which filmmakers can create transitions between worlds the way that we move from frame to frame in traditional cinema. By cutting between points of attention, filmmakers can align their crafted universes in a way that feels less jarring for the viewer. Two aligned POI 'VR & Cinema' [Credit: Google Developers] \nBrillhart uses the following image to illustrate how POI can be used by filmmakers to move viewers between worlds: Building worlds and aligning POI 'VR & Cinema' [Credit: Google Developers] \nIn the illustration above, the instances where two dots align signifies a moment when jumping between virtual worlds is ideal. The challenge for VR filmmakers is predicting when and where you are likely to draw you attention within the virtual space in order to best facilitate this transition. \nIn essence, filmmakers are crafting their worlds by laying out these intricate moments within the visual chaos. One way that Brillhart cleverly achieves her goal of guiding the viewer through a journey is by placing POI in the corner of your field of vision, thus drawing your eyes (and attention) to another part of the world, and opening up a new area of focus for the viewer to explore. \"Technology enables art. Art challenges technology.\" \nThe X-factor here is the human element. By relinquishing the power of the camera, VR filmmakers must consider the more active role of the audience in this new medium. Brillhart's findings reinforce the idea that the viewer now has a more active role in the filmmaking process, and the industry needs to redesign its approach around audiences' newfound sense of agency. Audiences Are Also Changing \nWhile its easier to see why technological advancements demand that filmmaking techniques adapt to work with emerging technology, there are more nuanced, organic factors that are also working to drive changes in the entertainment industry. Our Attention Spans Are Getting Shorter \nAccording to a study by Microsoft published in Spring 2015, the average human attention span has diminished to even worse than that of a goldfish. The age-old expression has come true [Credit: Microsoft, Spring 2015] \nIn recent years, our increased consumption of social media, simultaneous exposure to multiple screens, and incessant digital stimuli appears to have depleted our ability to focus on singular tasks, especially in non-digital environments. Fortunately, these findings also suggest that while we may be losing focus, we are gaining greater information retention and an increased capacity for short bursts of intense concentration. \n\"Brains are being rewired — any shift in stimuli results in a rewiring...the techniques and mechanisms to engage in rapid-fire attention shifting will be extremely useful” — Microsoft Researcher Danah Boyd Studios Respond By Tinkering With Their Marketing Strategies \nAs a result, media companies have changed their marketing strategies in order to more effectively cater to our evolving habits. Movie studios have begun distributing a staggering amount of promotional content for upcoming features just to keep audiences' attentions. Multiple trailers, countless TV spots, bonus featurettes, and more engaging media are designed to not only appeal to our shortened attention spans, but also create lasting impressions that are not-so-subtly driving audiences into cinemas. 'Captain America: Civil War' [Credit: Marvel Studios] \nBeginning over a year before its theatrical release, Captain American: Civil War released two domestic trailers, one international trailer, three promotional featurettes and no less than 56 TV spots — and that comprises only one facet of the studio's total marketing package. Website banner ads, promotional merchandise, billboard ads, and more are strategically placed in every part of our daily lives in hopes that we can be swayed into purchasing cinema tickets. And seeing as how Civil War grossed over $1.1 billion worldwide, it appears that studios are only gaining a better understanding of how we consume media on a daily basis, and how to best package their products for future consumption. Technology Is Changing, And So Are We \nAs filmmaking takes the next steps into the future, we as audiences can appreciate our growing role in the entertainment industry. We are slowly making the transition from the cinema seat to embodying the camera itself, bringing us one step closer to a more complete immersion into film. Not only are media companies altering their strategies to meet our changing demands, but we are influencing the very technology that entertains us.

      "text": "I Need A Hiro 'Heroes Reborn' [Credit: NBC] \nOka famously played the aptly named Hiro Nakamura in all four main series of Heroes , as well as miniseries Reborn. Since then, he has gone on to serve a seven-season stint on Hawaii 5-O , but has left that behind to pursue other projects. As well as producing #DeathNote , he revealed to EW that there would also be a part for him: \n\"I’m very fortunate to be able to do things also behind-the-scenes, creating some TV shows and also producing a lot of movies. I recently finished producing Death Note for Netflix, which I have a part in as well...I consult for a lot of Japanese companies as well, including the Japanese government, so I’ve always been going back and forth to L.A. to Hawaii to Japan. I’ve literally been doing the shuttle run between those three cities.\" 'Death Note' [Credit: Nippon Television] \nWhile it was only a small piece of information, fans are already guessing that Oka could be playing Touta Matsuda, a rookie member of the Japanese Task Force, who are central to the story. Matsuda starts the #comic and #anime series as an inept officer who often hinders the team's investigations, while he is also described as being socially awkward. Hmmm, sounds familiar to Oka's part as Nakamura, the man for whom nothing would go right and the unwilling hero of Heroes . \nAn unusual R-rating will see and even darker take on the already grim tale of a young man who possesses a notebook which grants the power to kill. Wingard promises that given its rating, the series can go wherever it wants, and with Dafoe voicing Ryuk, expect it to get pretty spooky! \nDeath Note airs on #Netflix sometime in 2017. \nInterest piqued? Check out the opening titles for the anime series of Death Note , and don't forget our poll below. Poll What do you think of Oka's casting? Amazing - I am a huge fan of him and the series Why does this even matter, he is just an actor? I won't even be watching Death Note ",

Symphony, a company that tracks people's streaming habits, has said Gilmore Girls: A Year in The Life attracted almost 5 million viewers from the 18-49 demographic for its first four episodes (via Entertainment Weekly ). We know that sounds impressive, but where does it fit in with the rest of Netflix's smash hits? © Netflix Related: Lauren Graham isn't paying attention to any Gilmore Girls revival backlash Well, it doesn't quite beat Fuller House - which drew in 7.3 million - or Orange is the New Black 's 5.8 million, but it does blow some Marvel classics out the water. Luke Cage and Daredevil trailed behind with audiences of 3.4 million and 3.2 million respectively, which is good going, but doesn't quite reach those Stars Hollow heights. So, this success means more episodes are on their way soon, right? © Netflix Well, kind of. Netflix's chief content officer Ted Sarandos is definitely up for making more episodes - which is just as well when you consider that cliffhanger - but we don't know when they're coming . \"We're definitely open to it if Amy Sherman-Palladino ( Gilmore Girls ' creator) is,\" he explained. Let's have that sooner rather than later, please. 5 million viewers can't be wrong. ",

      "text": "Netflix renews \"Luke Cage\" Marvel series for season 2 December 5, 2016 - 11:30   Netflix can't get enough of \"Luke Cage\". The streaming service officially announces that they have picked up the Marvel series for a second season. \"Always forward,\" the show quotes the hero's signature phrase when breaking the news on Twitter and teasing that the sophomore set is \"coming soon\", AceShowbiz said. \n\"Luke Cage\" became the first ever black superhero series. It premiered on September 30 and Netflix went down soon afterwards. It's unclear whether the problem was caused by \"Luke Cage\" overload, but fans who wanted to binge-watch the Mike Colter-starring show called out the streaming service over the hitch. \n\"Luke Cage\" is the third Marvel series on Netflix. \"Daredevil\" starring Charlie Cox came out first before \"Marvel's Jessica Jones\" starring Krysten Ritter followed. The next series will focus on Marvel's Iron Fist starring Finn Jones before those four outsiders will team up in one big ensemble called \"The Defenders\". Related links:",

      "text": "Netflix 3h ago W hat do NASA and Netflix have in common? Probably more than you would think. Researchers have developed a technique that uses artificial intelligence to help them search for and identify stable planetary systems. The technique is based on learning algorithms used by the streaming giant to offer online recommendations. This new tool will be used in tandem with NASA’s fleet of planet-hunting telescopes to identify planets that could potentially support life. “Machine learning offers a powerful way to tackle a problem in astrophysics, and that’s predicting whether planetary systems are stable,” Dan Tamayo, lead author of the research and a postdoctoral fellow in the Center for Planetary Science at the Univeristy of Toronto Scarborough, explained in a news release . As a form of artificial intelligence, machine learning enables computers to learn on their own, without having to be constantly fed data or programmed for a specific task. These types of advanced systems are specifically designed to learn and adapt on their own when exposed to different data. Tamayo says the team’s technique is 1,000 times faster than traditional methods in predicting stability. The results are available online in the current issue of the Astrophysical Journal Letters . The team hopes the tool will be a valuable asset in astronomy, able to help scientists locate new planetary systems that could potentially hold life, as well as discern new information that would otherwise go undetected with current methods of observation. Artist conception of NASA's TESS spacecraft. Tamayo explains that currently, astronomer rely on multiple methods to detect exoplanets . However, these methods are only capable of providing information on a planet’s size and orbital period — neither of which affects stability. Understanding how stable a system is, will allow researchers to glean insights into how they formed and better assess a planet’s chances for hosting life . With the technique developed by Tamayo and his team, astronomers will now be able to measure a planet’s mass and its orbit, which will come in handy when analyzing data from NASA’s upcoming Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) . The two-year mission will search for new exoplanets by focusing on the brightest stars in close proximity to our solar system and is set to launch next year. “It could be a useful tool because predicting stability would allow us to learn more about the system, from the upper limits of mass to the eccentricities of these planets,” says Tamayo.",

      "text": "Beauty shots of Netflix corporate headquarter campus × It’s now even easier to binge on Netflix Beauty shots of Netflix corporate headquarter campus \nIt just got even easier to binge on Netflix. \nNetflix announced on Wednesday members now have the option to download movies and shows to watch offline later. This means you can finally watch the new season of Stranger Things and Bloodline while on a flight or stuck in the subway. \nThe feature comes free of cost with all Netflix memberships. Members will want to make sure they have the most recent Netflix app on their Android or iOS devices to access the new “download” button. \nUp until now, you needed a place with a reliable internet connection to access the streaming service. But Netflix wants to make its product more nimble to suit the lives of those on the go. \nYou’ll find Orange Is the New Black, Narcos and The Crown available — but you can’t download everything. Shows like the new season of Gilmore Girls, Friends and New Girl are restricted for now. \nThe company previously argued the feature was unnecessary, calling it a “short term fix for a bigger problem.” That problem, of course, being wireless internet availability. \nBut its competitor Amazon Prime embraced offline downloads for iOS and Android users more than a year ago. \nAccording to Netflix’s Help Center page, “you’ll want to delete” downloaded titles before attempting to download new content. \nThat’s because some licensing agreements have limits on the number of titles people can download at the same time. The length of time Netflix users will have to watch a show or movie will vary by title. The “My Downloads” page will show members how long, such as 48 hours, they have with each title. \nThe company said in an email to CNNMoney it is working with “lots” of partners globally on securing downloading rights “for the bulk of the content on our service.” ",

      "text": "Netflix announces “Sense8” X-mas special, season 2 premiere dates December 5, 2016 - 15:06 AMT \nPanARMENIAN.Net - O come, all ye “Sense8” faithful. Netflix has announced a two-hour Christmas special will be available around the globe on Dec. 23. What’s more, Season 2 will pick up with 10 new episodes on May 5, Variey said. \nAs Netflix debuts are wont to do, the shows will be available to stream (and now possibly download) starting at 12:01 a.m. PT on the given release date. \nThe description provided for the Christmas Special leaves a lot to the imagination: “The journey continues as these eight singular hearts and minds weave in and out of each other’s lives finding deeper connections, learning darker, more desperate secrets about one another and struggling to identify with more than just oneself.” A similarly vague setup for Season 2 says that the whole cast will struggle to survive and understand one another “against all odds.” \nIn his review of the first season, Variety TV critic Brian Lowry wrote, “The main problem, simply, is that the show doesn’t make much sense.” Still, the streaming service in banking on the series to hold onto its devoted audience for the foreseeable future. \n“Sense8” stars Tuppence Middleton, Brian J. Smith, Doona Bae, Aml Ameen, Max Riemelt, Tina Desai, Miguel Ángel Silvestre and Jamie Clayton as eight strangers who become mentally and emotionally linked. \nLana Wachowski, Grant Hill and J. Michael Straczynski are the show’s executive producers. Related links:",

      "title": "Netflix Tops Ad Age's 2016 Marketer A-List",
      "text": "Netflix By Jeanine Poggi \nNetflix isn't what you would call a quintessential marketer. For one, the streaming video service does little in the way of traditional marketing. And what it does do, it doesn't like to discuss. \nDespite accolades for its native advertising, use of data to attract and retain subscribers, and flair for creating social content that goes viral, the company remains decidedly tight-lipped in the area of marketing. But that refusal to use marketing as a force multiplier makes it all the more impressive when Netflix drives audiences to an unknown supernatural thriller as easily as it does to a popular TV revival. \nNetflix under co-founder and CEO Reed Hastings has been a case study in how companies can use data to know what their audiences want and deliver the right message to the right viewer. \nWhile the company largely relies on word of mouth, it has become proficient in creating content that gets shared and reshared. In turn, fans generate their own memes, gifs and videos that their friends then see, resulting in a steady buzz for Netflix's original programming. \nThis is how \"Stranger Things,\" which follows a group of junior high misfits who go searching for their missing friend, became one of the most talked-about new shows of the year. While it received little advance hype, \"Stranger Things\" generated a cultlike following after its summer release, and fans include horror author Stephen King. \nNetflix did some initial marketing around the series, including a four-hour live broadcast on Twitch, the social platform for gamers. It also forayed into virtual reality for the first time with a 360-degree video that places viewers into the creepy universe of the series. \nBut it was really viewers who got other people, their friends, to watch. \"Stranger Things\" has spawned plenty of cosplay, with fans dressing up like favorite characters, while a web tool that lets people write in the \"Stranger Things\" font took over social media this summer. Advertisement \nNetflix also used unconventional marketing to promote the third season of the dystopian series \"Black Mirror,\" which explores the dark side of technology. The first two seasons originally aired on British broadcaster Channel 4, but Netflix then ordered a third season of its own. \nIn its marketing, Netflix played on the irony of the implications of its own technology. In one spot for the series, it introduced Netflix Vista, a fictional technology that will allow viewers to stream episodes of \"Black Mirror\" straight to their eyeballs. \nIt also created an app, based on the Rate Me app from the third season of the series, that allows users to rate each other based on their social interactions. And Netflix served special \"Black Mirror\" ads to people who run ad blockers in an attempt to unnerve them. \nNetflix has also learned how to tap into existing fandom for its revivals of prominent TV shows like \"Full House\" and \"Gilmore Girls,\" as well as its collection of original series starring Marvel characters. \nFor the Marvel superhero show \"Luke Cage,\" Netflix gave creators a space on Tumblr to display original \"Luke Cage\" art. \nAnd for \"Gilmore Girls\" fans who have been clamoring for years to return to the fictional town of Stars Hollow, Netflix brought a little piece of it to them. It turned cafés across the country into Luke's Diner, the café on the series, and served free cups of coffee. Ten thousand of its coffee cups included a Snapcode that unlocked a special \"Gilmore Girls\"-sponsored Snapchat filter. 'Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life' ranks as one of most-watched Netflix originals. Credit: courtesy Netflix. \nThe branded filter was viewed over 880,000 times and reached more than 500,000 unique Snapchatters, according to Snap, the parent of Snapchat. There were three times as many snap-to-unlocks as printed cups. \nWhile Netflix doesn't provide details on viewership, measurement firm Symphony Advanced Media said last week that \"Gilmore Girls\" is Netflix's third most-watched original series in the first three days of viewing. The revival pulled a 3.59 rating among 18-to-49-year-old-viewers, according to preliminary data from Symphony Advance Media, behind \"Fuller House\" and \"Orange is the New Black.\" (Netflix has questioned the accuracy of Symphony's approach.) \nNetflix has been able to keep its marketing budget minimal thanks to the media attention its originals receive. The company spent $714.3 million in worldwide advertising in 2015, up from $533.1 million the year prior, according to company SEC filings. Still, advertising is equivalent to just 10.5% of total revenue. \nIn the third quarter, Netflix management said, domestic marketing expenses increased 45% year-over-year to $108 million as it builds awareness for more original titles. \nIt helps that many Netflix originals have been critically acclaimed, with several besting traditional TV networks and premium cable channels for Emmy Awards. \nUltimately, Netflix's content is its biggest marketing tool, said Michael Goodman, director of digital media strategies at Strategy Analytics. The company has managed to turn out enough high-quality content to satisfy subscribers and pique the interest of non-users. It plans to release 1,000 hours of originals in 2017, up from more than 600 this year, with the goal of original content making up 50% of its offering. \nConsumers are responding. In the third quarter, Netflix's streaming revenue topped $2 billion for the first time. It also added 370,000 new subscribers in the U.S., more than the 300,000 it had previously predicted. The company has 86.7 million streaming subscribers worldwide. Marketer A-list Donald Trump By Simon Dumenco \nAs the editorial staff of Advertising Age repeatedly met over the past few weeks to discuss who belonged on our list of 2016 Marketers of the Year, the elephant in the room, President-elect Donald J. Trump, made everyone a little uncomfortable. \nPartially because the elephant wouldn't stop tweeting—about protesters unhappy about the election (\"Very unfair!\"), the cast of \"Hamilton\" (\"Apologize!\"), The New York Times (\"Not nice\"), \"Saturday Night Live\" (\"a totally one-sided, biased show\") and winning (\"I won the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally\"). Credit: Win McNamee/Getty Images. \nBut also because the elephant is, of course, proving to be a faux elephant, just as everyone expected (everyone, that is, who paid attention to his party affiliations over the years: Democratic, Republican, Reform, Democratic again, Republican again, independent and then Republican one more time). \nAnd, well, the \"blue-collar billionaire\" is also turning out to be a faux populist; see Politico's post titled \"Trump's Team of Gazillionaires\" (\"The self-styled champion of the working class assembles an administration that could be worth as much as $35 billion\"). \nAnd, naturally, Mr. \"Drain the Swamp\" sure seems to like things good and swampy after all. As New York magazine's Jonathan Chait wrote, \"He has already dismantled the twin guardrails against presidential kleptocracy, tax disclosure and personal divestment, in quick succession. It is a chillingly impressive achievement for a man still two months away from assuming the powers of office.\" \nIn marketing terms, what product did Americans just buy? Nobody seems quite sure. \nAll we know is that his branding and messaging connected with a critical mass of American voters—enough of them, anyway, to allow him to outdo Hillary Clinton in the Electoral College (i.e., he didn't even win the market-share battle). \nAs my colleague Jack Neff put it, \"Finding a way to fob off a highly defective product through sheer force of marketing counts for something.\" \nBut sorry, Donald, not enough to be Marketer of the Year. (You'll have to make do with the presidency.) \nThe truth is, pretty much every great marketer lies a little or a lot. At the heart of much of the most effective advertising there is a bottomless well of outright nonsense: This crappy junk food is wholesome. This sugar water will bring you happiness. This overpriced gadget will make you cool. And so on. \nWhat's astonishing about Mr. Trump, though, is the speed with which he's casually abandoned some of his most vigorous campaign-trail sales pitches—for instance, going from working his rally crowds into \"Lock her up!\" frenzies to saying he's not interested in seeking prosecution of Hillary Clinton over her private email server because \"I don't want to hurt the Clintons, I really don't.\" \nAt the same time, the image on the Brand Trump box that was so often revolting during the campaign? Turns out the product is exactly as pictured. \nAs Dave Chappelle said, \"America's done it. We've actually elected an internet troll as president.\" \nOr as The New York Times described the man: \"a self-obsessed zealot whose belief in his own destiny was unshakable, a chameleon whose economic and political colors were determined more by pragmatism than by doctrine.\" \nWhoops, sorry. The man in that case happens to be Fidel Castro. That's a line from the Times' obit for the Cuban dictator. \nHe was a tremendous marketer too, right? Marketer A-list Dr Pepper By E.J. Schultz \nMarketing soda in 2016 is not easy. The industry continued to grapple with health concerns and shifting taste preferences. But Dr Pepper Snapple Group has managed to squeeze growth from its flagship regular Dr Pepper brand, thanks to research-driven marketing that has linked the soda with college football. Meanwhile, Diet Dr Pepper outperformed Diet Coke and Diet Pepsi in the very tough diet soda segment. \nRegular Dr Pepper sales volume increased 0.3% in the first nine months of the year, compared with a 1.7% decline for Coke and a 4.1% drop for Pepsi, according to Beverage Digest. While Diet Dr Pepper volume fell 4.4%, that's better than Diet Coke's 5.6% drop and Diet Pepsi's 10.2% decline. \"Dr Pepper has shined in a challenged U.S. soda category in recent years by focusing its marketing on flavor, cultural touch points like college football and multicultural consumers,\" said Beverage Digest editor Duane Stanford. Dr Pepper's campaign featuring quirky stadium concessions character Larry Culpepper has seen success with college football audiences. Credit: Courtesy Dr Pepper Snapple Group. \nJim Trebilcock, the company's exec VP-chief commercial officer, tied the performance to insights gained via an intensive consumer study that began 18 months ago. The research led the Dr Pepper brand to downplay its \"one-of-a-kind\" positioning in favor of marketing that plays up the brand as a soda that \"people actually crave and they drink in very social situations with small groups of friends.\" This is the insight driving the brand's college football marketing. \nAds by Deutsch L.A. feature a quirky stadium concessions character named Larry Culpepper who delusionally thinks he invented the college football playoff. This year, the brand sent him on the road to visit tailgates across the country in a custom-built RV. \"We went from being one-of-a-kind to being an integral part of a social occasion that occurs every single week when you get together with friends,\" Mr. Trebilcock said. \nDiet Dr Pepper has its own character—a diminutive and flashy rock 'n' roller named Lil' Sweet. In ads also by Deutsch, he pops up unexpectedly in people's homes plugging the diet soda as a sweet afternoon reward. Before the campaign launched in 2015, the marketer had been advertising the diet soda along with Dr Pepper in a master-brand approach. The new standalone campaign has paid off to the point that the company gave Diet Dr Pepper a 30% spending boost this year, Mr. Trebilcock said. \nThe marketer is also getting a lift from Canada Dry, whose sales volume surged 7% in the third quarter, according to a recent earnings call. Ads by McGarryBowen plug the ginger ale as the \"root of relaxation,\" touting its \"real ginger and bubbles.\" The company is also keeping pace with the healthy beverage trend with moves such as its recent $1.7 billion acquisition of Bai Brands, whose products include enhanced water, carbonated flavored water, coconut water and premium ready-to-drink teas. Advertisement FX By Jeanine Poggi \nIt was nearly as impossible to avoid hearing about O.J. Simpson in 2016 as it was in 1994, thanks to FX's retelling of the infamous murders of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ron Goldman and subsequent trial that captivated the nation. \nDespite the plethora of documentaries, news interviews, satires and conspiracy theories that have surrounded Mr. Simpson since the murders, FX managed to generate new excitement with \"The People v. O.J. Simpson: American Crime Story,\" from both people who decades earlier sat glued to their TV sets for 11 months to await the verdict and an audience that may not have even been alive when the outcome was delivered. \n\"With O.J., you had a subject matter that had been picked clean like a skeleton in the desert,\" said Stephanie Gibbons, chief marketing officer, FX Networks. \"How are we going to pull flesh off it and bring it back to life? How will people feel reliving something they feel lived nine lives already?\" 'The People v. O.J. Simpson' was cable's most-watched new show of the year. Credit: Michael Becker/FX Networks. \nFX did this not by feeding into the salacious, but by focusing on the things people still didn't know and framing it all in the context of the time. \"This was about so much more than the crime,\" Ms. Gibbons said. \n\"You think you know everything, but you don't know the half of it\" became the mantra for the campaign. \nIn one spot, FX showed the infamous white Bronco driving down a Los Angeles highway. \"So many people saw that,\" Ms. Gibbons said. \"But you weren't inside it.\" \nFX's marketing approach helped make \"The People v. O.J. Simpson\" cable's most-watched new show of the year and the most-watched show in the network's history. It also took home nine Emmy Awards. \nBeyond O.J. Simpson, FX also generated buzz for its sixth season of \"American Horror Story.\" It's become a game for \"AHS\" fans to find out the premise and cast ahead of each season, eventually getting confirmation from the network. But this year, FX kept all the details of the new season tightly under wraps until its premiere in September, including even the title (\"Roanoke\"). \nInstead, the network released 25 teasers with different horror themes and tropes. Only one of them contained the real subject of the plot. \nThat set off an internet frenzy, with \"American Horror Story\" fans trying to predict what the new season would bring. \nMs. Gibbons said the strategy played on people's innate curiosity to find out what they don't know, and the idea that wanting the information can be at least as fulfilling as actually having it. \nThe network's overall marketing strategy is similar to Hollywood marketing, Ms. Gibbons said. It treats every series as a single entity and runs major campaigns for each series and new season. Marketer A-list By Adrianne Pasquarelli \nWhat's inside matters, but two years ago, that strategy wasn't quite cutting it at Intel. \nWhen Steven Fund joined the company in 2014 as senior VP-chief marketing officer, the former Staples executive was challenged with making the 48-year-old tech brand relevant to younger consumers. Though a $55.4 billion, Fortune 500 company, Intel had lost its way with millennials, who saw the brand as a dated chipmaker, if they considered it at all. \n\"On the one hand, you had this powerful, well-known, respected and valued brand in Intel, but on the other hand, it was stuck a little bit in the past,\" said Mr. Fund. \"[We wanted] to take that equity and the world inside and pivot to the future and rebuild our relationship with the millennial generation.\" \nWorking with McGarryBowen and Intel's own 90-person internal Agency Inside, the tech brand immediately developed a host of new initiatives, including a fresh consumer-focused campaign with lovable geek Jim Parsons, and the new tagline \"Experience What's Inside.\" Earlier this year, Intel helped create a groundbreaking, tech-infused performance by Lady Gaga at the Grammys. \nThe efforts are paying off. Santa Clara, Calif.-based Intel, which recently beat analyst expectations by reporting third-quarter revenue of $15.8 billion, a 9% rise over the year-earlier period, has moved beyond its processor roots. On the BrandZ list of the 100 most valuable global brands, Intel moved to No. 51 this year from No. 86 in 2014; it improved in similar rankings from Interbrand and Forbes as well. Intel has worked to rebuild its relationship with millennials. Credit: Courtesy Intel. \nMarianne Besch, managing director and executive creative director at McGarryBowen San Francisco, said that sports, arts, science and medicine are areas where Intel has focused. \"Our strategy was to ingrain ourselves in the experiences people love having and make them possible, push them further and wow ourselves along the way.\" \nThe wow factor was a chief goal in the Grammys work. The live performance included a facial-projection mapping that transformed Lady Gaga into the late David Bowie. She also wore a tech-enabled ring that could change her scenery in real time. The activation resulted in 2 billion earned media impressions in the U.S. and 10 billion globally. \nIntel is also experimenting with three-dimensional, 360-degree replays for sporting events like the NBA Finals. In addition, the company recently created, with Mark Burnett, \"America's Greatest Makers,\" a TBS reality series with a $1 million prize that continues Intel's quest to engage with millennials and be more than a chip. \nNext year, consumers can expect to see fresh Jim Parsons ads, more of a presence at sporting events and a new Grammys activation. Intel will also debut work from TBWAChiatDay, which it tapped for business-to-business marketing earlier this year. \n\"You can't just talk about being an experience brand and advertise it. You have to insert yourself into creating high-visibility experiences,\" said Mr. Fund. \"We inserted our brand into pop culture.\" Advertisement KFC By Jessica Wohl \nMuch of KFC's recent success can be traced to multiple personalities—that is, multiple personalities playing one person: the chain's founder, Colonel Harland Sanders. \nThe idea began two years ago, when the fried chicken chain began thinking about its \"re-colonelization,\" recalled KFC U.S. Chief Marketing Officer Kevin Hochman. That was when Wieden & Kennedy, which was not yet KFC's creative agency, did some positioning work for the Yum Brands chain. \n\"That idea of getting back to a higher standard in everything that we do has kind of pervaded the business,\" said Mr. Hochman, who joined KFC in January 2014 and refers to Colonel Sanders as \"the original celebrity chef.\" \nIn May 2015, after longtime agency FCB was out and Wieden & Kennedy was in, KFC began airing commercials featuring Darrell Hammond in the role of Colonel Sanders. That August, Norm Macdonald stepped into the role. He was followed in 2016 by actors including Jim Gaffigan, Rob Riggle and even wrestling star Dolph Ziggler, who donned the Colonel's white suit for a staged WWE event. \nThen George Hamilton starred as an Extra Crispy Colonel. That campaign helped ignite sales of a product that more than half of KFC's customers did not know about even though it had been on the menu for 40 years. Along with a TV spot, the bronzed actor appeared in web clips showcasing the sound of eating fried chicken and a fried chicken-scented sunscreen. \n\"We think a big part of the campaign has been this idea that we're essentially making fun of advertising and fried chicken advertising,\" said Mr. Hochman. \"That allows us to then get our product benefits across in a humorous way that people can enjoy, and we have a bit more relevance for them because we all know that younger people are generally distrustful of advertising. The fact that we're self-effacing endears us, or creates more relevance.\" \nMore success stems from a new product for KFC, Nashville Hot chicken. Mr. Gaffigan's character helped launch Nashville Hot for a limited run early this year, with ads including a slot during the CBS live stream of Super Bowl 50. \"Mad Men\" actor Vincent Kartheiser followed in a Nashville Hot Colonel role when the product returned later in the year. Vincent Kartheiser, better known as Pete Campbell to 'Mad Men' fans, as KFC's Nashville Hot Colonel. Credit: Courtesy KFC. \n\"I like to think we democratized it for kind of everybody,\" Mr. Hochman said of Nashville Hot. \nFor KFC, reaching everybody matters. The chain used to have an average customer that was older than the rest of the fast-food industry, and now it is slightly over-indexed with a younger crowd, Mr. Hochman said. \nIt's also helped the chain post nine consecutive quarters of U.S. same-store sales gains, including a 6% jump in the third quarter of 2016. \nHeading into 2017, KFC and franchisees are set to continue a remodeling push. Updated locations, with a more modern look that highlights the Colonel, are seeing 8 to 10 percentage-point jumps in same-store sales, according to Mr. Hochman. \nNow, Mr. Hochman aims to tell more of KFC's food story. \n\"Most people don't know it takes 25 minutes for a cook in every KFC to take raw chicken from U.S. farms and bread it, and cook it, and let it rest, and then serve it to the customer. That food story is a big part of what we're trying to push forward both in '16 and beyond,\" he said. Marketer A-list Adidas By E.J. Schultz \nJust two years ago, Adidas seemed destined for the sidelines in the competitive sportswear industry. The nearly 70-year-old company was surpassed by upstart Under Armour in 2014 as the second-biggest sports brand in the U.S. after Nike, prompting Ad Age to name Under Armour our 2014 Marketer of the Year. \nBut now, the shoe is on the other foot. \nThanks to a hot product line and a reinvigorated marketing approach focusing on creativity in sports, Adidas has regained its second-place ranking. By the second quarter, Adidas recorded $890.1 million in North American sales, compared with $827.1 million for Under Armour and $3.7 billion for Nike, according to Bloomberg. Adidas has regained its second-place ranking behind Nike. Credit: Courtesy Adidas. \nThe comeback has been fueled by a series of shoe and fashion hits at the German-based company with North American headquarters in Portland, Ore. \"When Mark King came on board he moved about 200 product and marketing people from Germany to Oregon,\" NPD sports industry analyst Matt Powell said, referring to the mid-2014 promotion of Mr. King to president of Adidas Group North America. \"He gave them one mission: to make shoes American kids wanted to buy. Those shoes began to hit retail about a year ago and the rest is history.\" \nBreakthroughs include collaborations with superstars outside of sports, such as Kanye West. Adidas, which began partnering with Mr. West two years ago on a Yeezy-branded product, in June cemented a long-term relationship with the musician and fashion designer for footwear, apparel and accessories aimed at \"all genders across street and sport.\" Adidas described it as \"the most significant partnership ever created between a non-athlete and an athletic brand.\" \nThe brand is also gaining strength from its Adidas Originals collection, which includes updated versions of classics like Stan Smiths. The Originals line was supported this year with an edgy campaign by Johannes Leonardo called \"Your Future Is Not Mine.\" \nThe house of the Adidas and Reebok brands reported a currency-neutral sales increase of 20% in North America in the third quarter. The growth is being noticed where it counts most—at big retailers. On a Nov. 18 earnings call, Foot Locker CEO Richard Johnson described the continued growth of Adidas as \"one of the most significant dynamics\" in the industry, adding that the company is \"on a great run.\" \nOn the advertising front, Adidas has found its stride by positioning itself as brand for creators. A campaign by 72andSunny debuted in September with an ad starring big-name pros like the NFL's Aaron Rodgers and Von Miller, NBA star James Harden and Paul Pogba of soccer's Manchester United. The narrator urged viewers to \"free your imagination\" and \"make your own luck.\" The spot even included a not-so-subtle dig at Under Armour by mocking its ads that show armies of doppelgängers, like dozens of Tom Bradys, with the Adidas spot describing such scenes as \"cookie-cutter, copy-and-paste blah.\" In November, Adidas debuted an ad starring Mr. Harden that imagined what basketball would look like without creativity—like no players dancing and celebrating on the bench. \"You really want that?\" Mr. Harden asks. For the growing number of Adidas fans, the answer is a resounding no. Credit: Courtesy Adidas. Marijuana By E.J. Schultz \nAd Age normally names companies, not categories, to the Marketer A-List. But we made an exception for marijuana because these are high times for cannabis. Look no further than Election Day, when voters in California, Massachusetts, Maine and Nevada passed recreational pot measures. Voters in other states, including Florida, approved medical marijuana usage. Medical cannabis is now legal or pending in 28 states, while recreational use is on the books in eight states. \nWhat makes the ballot wins remarkable is that they came amid a Republican wave—including Donald Trump's win—proving that cannabis has come a long way from its hippie days. National support for legalizing marijuana is at an all-time high of 60%, according to a recent Gallup poll. \"The transformation in public attitudes about marijuana over the past half-century has mirrored the liberalization of public attitudes about gay rights and the same-sex marriage movement,\" Gallup stated. \nIn 2015, Americans spent more on legal marijuana ($3.4 billion) than they did on Oreos ($711 million), according to \"Rebranding Marijuana,\" a report published in April by cannabis-focused media company High Times and Omnicom Group agency Sparks & Honey. The agency is working in partnership with High Times to reposition how consumers and the ad industry view marijuana. Pot is shedding its stoner status as it moves into the mainstream, propelled by its use in everything from tourism to food and fashion, according to the report. Marijuana \"used to be a taboo and is now evolving into something that is infiltrating people's lives in a variety of different ways,\" said Anna Sofia Martin, a senior writer at Sparks & Honey. Marijuana is shedding its stoner status as it moves into the mainstream. Credit: Andrew Caballero-Reynolds/AFP/Getty Images. \nMarijuana remains a largely unbranded category devoid of traditional marketing. But that is beginning to change. Ad agency Anomaly is helping to lead the way via its September investment in Hmbldt, a cannabis products company that markets devices to deliver specified doses aimed at producing health benefits. Formulas are sold for Bliss, Sleep, Calm and Relief. The so-called vape pens, which sell for $100 each, made Time.com's list of the 25 best inventions of 2016. The company is projecting $25 million in sales in 2017, said Anomaly partner Jason DeLand, who also serves on Hmbldt's board. He predicted that medicinal marijuana, not recreational pot, will account for most of the branding going forward. \nBut cannabis culture is creeping into other industries. That includes food, where \"pot-preneurial chefs and their cookbooks are paving the way for legal highs in foodie culture,\" like weed-infused salmon, according to the Sparks & Honey report. The report also predicted that clothing and accessories will be specifically designed to carry marijuana. One brand, called AnnaBis, already markets fashionable handbags lined with an odor-blocking resin to keep the smell of pot at bay. Products include the Whoopee vape case, designed to hold your pipe, lighter and herb in \"a pretty, compact case.\" Marketer A-list Pokémon By Jessica Wohl \nFrom an anthemic Super Bowl commercial to the introduction of a mobile gaming phenomenon, 2016 was the year of Pokémon. \nPokémon debuted in Japan in February 1996 with two video games, \"Pokémon Red\" and \"Pokémon Green,\" in which humans catch and train the titular characters to fight each other. Today, Pokémon stars in video games and trading card sets, is seen in shows and movies, and appears as Thanksgiving Day parade balloons and on designer clothing. \nFor its 20th anniversary, Pokémon wanted to celebrate the millions of \"trainers,\" those who play the games, rather than look back on its own success. \"It was really just about giving our fans a way to celebrate their fandom,\" said J.C. Smith, Pokémon's senior director of consumer marketing. \nThe Pokémon Co. International began planning for this year's 20th-anniversary celebration two years in advance, leading off with the \"Train On\" spot in Super Bowl 50. \"They knew they wanted to kick off 2016 and the 20th anniversary in a big way,\" said Josh Smutko, a creative director at Omelet, the agency behind the spot. It resonated with fans, who noticed Easter eggs such as the line \"Like No One Ever Was\" from the Pokémon theme song on the wall of the football team's locker room. Omelet's other work this year included spots for new trading card sets and a video for the launch of \"Pokémon Go.\" \nBut it was \"Pokémon Go\" that truly filled the culture this summer. It was hard to walk around without seeing people staring intently at their mobile phones trying to catch virtual Pokémon on sidewalks, in museums, in airports and in parks. \n\"We wanted people to be able to experience Pokémon in a way that they hadn't experienced it before,\" Mr. Smith said of \"Pokémon Go.\" The game, which was developed by Niantic, goes back to 2014. That's when Pokémon and Google, which then owned Niantic, teamed up for an April Fools' Day stunt that gave trainers the chance to find Pokémon within Google Maps. Initial discussions about the mobile game were sparked by the popularity of those searches, Mr. Smith recalls. Niantic, which spun off from Google in 2015, counts the Pokémon Co., Google and Nintendo as investors. \nPokémon shows no signs of slowing. By September, \"Pokémon Go\" had been downloaded 500 million times. In November, Jeffrey New York began selling a Prabal Gurung x Pokémon collection: For $325, there's a Jigglypuff T-shirt. The short-sleeve silk dress with asymmetrical hem goes for $1,795. \nPokémon would not confirm whether it plans to return to the Super Bowl. But it already has new experiences to promote. \"Pokémon Sun\" and \"Pokémon Moon\" games for Nintendo 3DS came out in November. In December, animated shows and movies make their debut on Disney XD. In 2017, production is set to begin on a live-action Pokémon movie. \"All of these pieces work together to really have Pokémon front and center in a variety of different ways to keep people guessing, and keep people excited, and having fun with the brand,\" said Mr. Smith. \"That's the key. If they're not having fun with this, what's the point?\" Credit: Courtesy Nintendo. ANA By Simon Dumenco \nIn a marketing industry awash with trade organizations, one stood out in 2016 by creating a row that questioned the industry's ethical foundations. \nThe Association of National Advertisers pushed the subject of media transparency like never before. The group got wide-ranging media coverage with a long-awaited report by investigative consulting firm K2 Intelligence that alleged widespread, if entirely unidentified, cash rebates, side deals and other \"nontransparent\" practices, particularly in digital marketing. \nThe report followed the uproar resulting from an ANA-commissioned presentation in early 2015 by former Mediacom CEO-turned-consultant Jon Mandel that made similar, if less detailed, allegations. Both broadsides have been roundly criticized by the 4A's and member-agency holding companies, partly for the continued lack of details. \nBut it's clear the effort has had an impact. The K2 report anonymously notes that some marketers had little idea what kind of audit provisions their media-agency contracts had put in place, and cites one marketer that essentially gave up when its agency resisted extending an audit to the holding-company level. A follow-up by consulting firm Ebiquity recommended tougher contracts with audit clauses, including a contract template. \nGiven the publicity, the number of marketers looking to add and exercise audit provisions in contracts has risen dramatically, according to Manuel Reyes, CEO of Cortex Media, who acknowledges he'd been arguing for them to do so for years, with less success. Procter & Gamble Chief Brand Officer Marc Pritchard, now ANA chairman, believes P&G's \"trust-but-verify\" approach has prevented rebate problems, but said some marketers have taken him up on his offer to provide counsel on contract terms. \nIt's less clear whether the effort has been a winner for the ANA financially. After years of double-digit revenue gains, growth slowed to single digits this year, the group's CEO, Bob Liodice, said in an interview. Some of the ANA's revenue comes from sponsorships by the very agency groups it's struggling with. Bob Liodice.

Associate memberships, which include some agency employees, are rising at a healthy pace, Mr. Liodice said. \nThough ANA revenue growth has slowed early in the year, it's picked up in the back half, he said. And longer term, the group has quadrupled staff from 28 to 115 during his 12 years at the helm. \nMore broadly, the transparency campaign is part of the group's larger \"marketer rights\" movement, Mr. Liodice said. \"Marketers need to lead the way in taking this industry back.\" Advertisement L'Oréal By Jack Neff \nThe beauty business has been a tougher place for big brands in recent years as smaller players, fueled by digital and social media, gained ground. L'Oréal and rival Estée Lauder have been active at acquiring emerging brands and growing them, but the latter had been growing faster—until recently. \nAs Estée Lauder, marketer of brands that include MAC and Bobbi Brown, reported surprisingly soft sales last quarter, L'Oréal delivered an upside surprise with 5.6% organic sales growth fueled by a 7.5% increase in North America. \nKey to those numbers were strong results from emerging brands acquired in recent years, such as Urban Decay, Nyx and Carol's Daughter. L'Oréal USA also helped capture some of the space upstart brands have been gaining in haircare with its launch of Garnier Whole Blends, paraben-free products with botanical ingredients. \nL'Oréal has boosted results in part with digital innovation, such as the Makeup Genius augmented-reality app for trying on makeup virtually.

Marketer to Watch Girl Scouts By Jessica Wohl \nGirl Scouts of the USA received a major boost in February when Academy Awards host Chris Rock reached out to a troop leader about girls selling cookies on-air to hungry stars during the Oscars broadcast. Now the Girl Scouts are gaining more attention—this time in the grocery aisle. Quaker Oats began selling Chewy Girl Scouts granola bars in the organization's signature Thin Mints and Caramel Coconut flavors in 2015. The J.M. Smucker Co. followed this year with Girl Scouts-branded Pillsbury baking mixes that essentially extend the famous cookie flavors into blondies, brownies and cupcakes. And beginning in early 2017, the organization moves onto the breakfast table. General Mills will sell Girl Scouts cereal in Thin Mints and Caramel Crunch flavors for a limited time, with a portion of sales supporting Girl Scouts of the USA programming.

Marketer to Watch American Eagle By Adrianne Pasquarelli \nOne of the few apparel brands getting it right with fickle teens, American Eagle Outfitters is flying above the fray. A huge part of that can be attributed to the Pittsburgh-based brand's marketing. American Eagle recently hired Kyle Andrew from Kate Spade as chief marketing officer and has won over millennials with its body-positive messaging, including a no-airbrushing pledge, which resonates with young consumers eager for brand authenticity. Earlier this year, the 1,044-unit retailer, after posting a 7% rise in net revenue in 2015 to $3.5 billion, worked with Laird & Partners to debut \"#WeAllCan,\" a campaign that tapped young actors like Hailee Steinfeld and Cody Christian to post messages of empowerment and love. To keep the momentum going, American Eagle plans to expand its brand on a global level in order to become less reliant on the U.S. mall. Credit: Courtesy American Eagle Outfitters. Marketer to Watch Snapchat By Garett Sloane \nSnapchat has mastered the art of mystery marketing, and it can generate instant attention even while it tries to appear low-key. Just watch how it's rolling out its first hardware product, Spectacles. Snapchat hasn't gone through a traditional retailer to stock its glasses or spent money on TV commercials, yet lines for the video glasses are hours long. That's because supply is restrained; Snapchat is only selling them out of what it calls \"Snapbots.\" These glorified vending machines have the feel of a Snapchat product—they are yellow, giant emojis, spit out receipts that look like rainbows, and vanish after 24 hours. It's this elusive quality that has made Snapchat a must-have app and a company everyone on Madison Avenue wants to play with. So enmeshed is Snapchat with culture that its signature ghost logo is the only billboard art it needs when it materializes into places from Cannes, France, to Times Square.

      "text": "Reddit \nLast week Netflix debuted offline viewing mode , something that subscribers have been wanting for a long time. With the offline mode, users were allowed to download shows and movies directly to their device to watch on the go without having to stream using WiFi or data connections. Netflix has taken steps to ensure that the downloads are as small and as efficient as possible using VP9 content encoding for downloaded content. \nWith streaming content Netflix is using H.264/AVC almost exclusively which helps to reduce the bandwidth needed for the streaming while keeping the shows looking good at the same time. For the downloaded content for offline viewing Netflix is using VP9 encoding. VP9 is an open source encoding format that was developed by Google, VP9 uses tech that allows the same video quality with significantly less data bandwidth required. \nVP9 can also allow better quality videos for the same amount of data needed at download. The challenge is that VP9 isn’t supported by all streaming providers. VP9 is supported on Android devices and via the Chrome browser. That means iPhone users won’t get to use VP9 codec and so far Apple has given no indication that it will ever support VP9. \nTo get around that lack of support, Netflix is offering downloads in H.264/AVC High whereas streams are encoded in H.264/AVC Main. Netflix chooses the optimal encoding format for each title on its service after finding, for instance, that animated films are easier to encode than live-action. Netflix began optimizing encoding for each title last year and claims that change helped users on slower connections save up to 20% of their data. \nNetflix says that H.264 High encoding saves 19% bandwidth compared to other encoding standards while VP9 saves 36%. Netflix wants to be clear that its encoding not only aims to save storage space on devices, but to improve video quality as well.",

      "text": "Posted By: Kazem Sedighzadeh   TV Page 1 of 2 1 2 » \nNetflix has already announced a few weeks after the Season 5 of the American Western crime drama TV series “Longmire” was streamed on the streaming service in September that the show would have its final run next year as its Season 6 is going to be its last. \nWhile most fans of “Longmire” refuse to accept the reality that their favorite show is about to draw to a close, the producers and the cast of characters are happy that they could have one last season to give the show a fitting conclusion that it so deserves. \nAs far as lead actor Robert Taylor is concerned, he is just happy that Season 6 of “Longmire” will give his character Sheriff Walt Longmire the opportunity for his last and final run in catching the bad guys of Absaroka County in the state of Wyoming, reports Game & Guide. \nIt is also expected that Sheriff Walt will be joined by his Deputy Sheriff Vic Moretti, played by Katee Sackhoff, both in his crime-fighting activities and possibly in his life as his romantic partner. \nAccording to the showrunner, Season 6 of “Longmire” is packed with action and excitement and of course, the romance between Walt and Vic. \nBased on the book \n“Longmire” has been adapted for television from Craig Johnson’s mystery novel of the same title. His book is a reflection of the mysteries, interactions, and relationships of the environment and the characters in the modern-day West. \nCraig Johnson revealed that his portrayal of the modern day West catalogs the events he picked up from newspaper articles in the Wyoming and Montana areas. \nThe author has a rich source of story plots in his books for “Longmire” Season 6 to continue the show. However, the end will finally come for the series after six wonderful years on the small screen. \nFrom Craig Johnson’s rich story source, “Longmire” could actually go beyond six seasons but Netflix has decided that six years would be enough for the show. It can be recalled that “Longmire” was aired on A&E during its first three seasons. Netflix rescued it from cancellation and aired its Seasons 4 and 5, as well as its upcoming and final sixth season. \nA possible plotline and spinoff \nMeanwhile, there are also speculations saying that Season 6 of “Longmire” might involve the Irish mob and Ferg’s girlfriend. \nThere are also rumors saying that a possible spinoff TV series might come out of “Longmire” and it would already star Vic Moretti, reports News Everyday. \nHowever, all these are mere speculations and have not been confirmed by Netflix, the showrunner, and even the cast members so the information should all be taken with a fine grain of salt. \nIncidentally, the Season 5 finale of “Longmire” left several cliffhangers so the rumors have caused panic to some fans of the TV series that they decided to initiate a move to make sure that Netflix would renew the show for Season 6. \nThey have decided to make the streaming service realize that there is a strong demand for “Longmire” that is why in social media, they have strongly lobbied for its renewal and used the hashtag #RenewLongmireNetflix. \nApparently, the rumors were not true as it turns out that Netflix is giving the show another season although no official announcement of the renewal has been made or when would the show air its sixth season. \nThe confirmation came from a source who claims to be already privy to the decision of Netflix that there would be a Season 6 of “Longmire.” \nThe downside to the confirmation of a sixth season for “Longmire” comes with the reality as well that Season 6 could be the last for the show.

      "title": "Why Netflix downloads offline video to your iOS device in 1-3 minute chunks",
      "text": "Reddit \nOne of the reasons it took Netflix so long to allow subscribers to download video for offline playback , says the company, is that it wanted to make sure that TV shows and movies didn’t eat up huge amounts of storage on devices. \nA piece in Variety reveals that while it was able to do this reasonably easily for Android devices – using a Google codec designed to significantly reduce the amount of data needed for high-quality video transmission – things weren’t quite so simple on iPhone and iPad. In fact, it ended up splitting video into chunks of just one to three minutes each to do the job … \nThe VP9 codec Netflix uses for Android devices isn’t supported by Apple, so the company had to use a different codec when downloading to iOS devices. In doing so, the company realised that it could actually do better than this by taking what sounds like a pretty extreme approach to encoding video for download. The company’s encoding team also realized that different scenes in different movies require vastly different amounts of data. An action scene with a lot of visual noise contains a lot more visual information than a scenic shot of a blue sky, and animated movies in general are much easier to encode than live-action films. Netflix first started to account for these visual differences last year, when it began to tweak its encoding settings for each and every title […] For its new download option, the company is taking the idea one step further: Instead of changing these settings per title, Netflix is cutting each and every video into one-to-three-minute-long chunks. Computers then analyze the visual complexity of each and every of these clips, and encode with settings that are optimized for its visual complexity. \nThe results is that downloaded video takes up 19% less space, effectively meaning you can store five TV shows in the same amount of storage that would otherwise be needed for four. \nNetflix says that the same approach would also reduce data usage during streaming, so it plans to apply the technique to mobile streaming in the next few months.

If that is not exciting enough, it has been announced that Season 2 will be out with 10 all new episodes of May 5, 2017. \nSpoiler alert! This article contains “Sense8” spoilers. Read on if you would like to know what happens next before the next episode airs. \nThe description for the upcoming Christmas Special does not say much about what is to come and leaves a lot to the imagination. The synopsis merely says that “The journey continues as these eight singular hearts and minds weave in and out of each other’s lives finding deeper connections, learning darker, more desperate secrets about one another and struggling to identify with more than just oneself.” Similarly, the only hint for what is to come for Season 2 is that the whole cast will struggle to survive one another as they go against all odds. \nVariety reports that Brian Lowry wrote in his review of the first season that the main problem is that the show does not make much sense. However, the streaming service is banking on the series to hold onto its devoted audience in the near future. Hopefully, this upcoming Christmas Special and season 2 will change all that and make things much better for all viewers. \nOther reports say that Netflix had renewed Netflix for a second season way back in 2015, but there has been very little news about the series. Therefore, this news of a premiere date of the second season and a Christmas special comes as a pleasant surprise for the show’s fans. \nThe first season of “Sense8” introduced to viewers a group of eight individuals across the world who discover an amazing ability to tap into each other and experience one another’s senses. For its second season, it has been announced that it will take place where the first season left off. That is where the characters were on the run from Whispers (Terrence Mann), and get forced to question their own identity. \n\" Sense8 \" season 2 is set to return in May 2017. Meanwhile, let's have a look back at season 1. \nSense8 | official trailer (2015) J. Michael Straczynski Tom Tykwer Netflix \nSource: YouTube/moviemaniacsDE",

      "text": "Viva Entertainment Group (OTTV) Takes Aim at Netflix (NFLX) and Other Over-the-Top TV Players (Small Cap Network) \nWalt Disney Co (NYSE: DIS ) disclosed in November that its flagship sports network ESPN continued to suffer subscriber losses. \nThe recent speculation of Disney acquiring Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ: NFLX ) would result in only modest cost synergies and Disney’s stock may trade down on such a deal, Brean Capital’s Alan Gould said in a report. \nDisney's US attributable cable subscribers declined 1.6 percent in 2016, versus a 1.9 percent decline in 2015, with ESPN down 2 percent as compared to a 3 percent drop last year. “This could be an indication that the worst of the migration to small programming packages has already occurred,” Gould wrote \nGould maintained a Hold rating on the company, while raising the fair value estimate from $100 to $108. The EPS estimates for FY 2017 and FY 2018 have been raised by $0.15 each to $6.00 and $6.70, respectively. How Disney’s Shares May Respond To A Netflix Purchase \nInvestors have been speculating a Netflix acquisition ever since Disney Bob CEO Iger began indicated plans to use technology to reach consumers more directly. \nWhile such a deal can't be ruled out, Disney is unlikely to make an acquisition worth $65-$70 billion, the analyst noted. At this price, Netflix is worth almost 40 percent Disney’s size. \nNetflix has gained about an estimated 65 million domestic subscribers in five years, while ESPN has more than 80 million subscribers. There would be modest cost synergies, resulting in dilution of an estimated 24 percent to the FY 2017 EPS estimate and 15 percent to FY21. \nDisney’s shares may re-rate higher, although they would likely not trade at a multiple higher than that of Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOGL ), Gould commented. He added that Disney’s shares would likely trade down on a Netflix deal. \n“DIS, more than any other media company is owned by generalist portfolio managers, and it has historically traded as a multiple of EPS, more than other media companies.” Latest Ratings for DIS",

      "text": "Netflix Inc. is making some TV shows and movies available for download to watch offline, providing its users a feature that has become a must-have for binge-watchers.\nMany fans have requested to watch Netflix content without an internet connection, especially those in emerging markets with limited internet access. The world's largest online TV network will roll out the feature on phones and tablets for all subscribers, but only for select shows such as \"The Crown\" and \"Orange is the New Black\" at first, according to a statement Wednesday.\nNetflix has been signaling it would add a downloading option in recent months, as a way to continue increasing its subscriber base and match video-streaming Amazon.com. Offline viewing will make Netflix shows more accessible to customers around the world, particularly in developing markets in Asia and Africa.\nNetflix has 86.7 million customers worldwide, 47.5 million of whom live in the U.S. The company now relies on international markets for most of its growth, and earlier this year expanded its footprint to the entire world, save for China, Syria, North Korea and Crimea.\n\"While many members enjoy watching Netflix at home, we've often heard they also want to continue their 'Stranger Things' binge while on airplanes and other places where internet is expensive or limited,\" said Eddy Wu, Netflix's director of product innovation, in a web post.\n ",

The slicky crafted Canadian-produced drama, about a team from the future that has journeyed back into the present to save humanity, has already aired in its homeland, but will go global later this month when it bows on Netflix. And for McCormack, who stars as FBI Special Agent Grant MacLaren, that move is even more exciting than time-jumps. \nCongratulations on this. This is a nice departure. Yeah, it’s nice to back. Most people don’t know that this is where I got my start. I was all drama before the gay lawyer. [ Laughs ] \nBut this if your first sci-fi drama, right? Not exactly. I had a lot of little guest stars on little things. It’s always weird whenever I’m at a convention that has a lot of sci-fi. People always come up and mention my one episode of the Highlander or my one episode of The Outer Limits . It’s amazing. Sci-fi audiences forget nothing! And in fact, the guy who created Travelers , Brad Wright, wrote the episode of The Outer Limits I was on that I did over 20 years ago. \nWill & Grace still runs on cable and watching Travelers , it's like you haven't aged at all. You’re a sci-fi situation! [ Laughs ] Well, I’m rotting on the inside. That’s my secret. \nSo, let’s talk about Travelers because it won't debut on Netflix until Dec. 23, but when it started to air in Canada, Twitter was all over it. Right. And I’ve got a lot of American followers who were going, “Huh? When do we get this?” So, airing in Canada was like the out-of-town try-out, and so far, from what we hear, the network up there is a traditional network—it’s like a TNT-size network—and their numbers have been great and the response is even great. So, I’m feeling really excited about this country and really, every country, because that’s Netflix, right? 180 countries all at once. So, the whole world gets it. \nRELATED: McCormack Previews His Hallmark Movie, A Heavenly Christmas \nExplain the show. We have an exclusive clip (below) where you and the team realize a mission has gone wrong and it's clear there is time travel, but not physical time travel. What I love about it is that it's sci-fi and it's time travel, yet it doesn’t fit either of those molds because it all takes place entirely now. The Travelers have traveled from a very bleak future to fix those little things that they’ve figured out that are going to make the future better...they hope. So, it’s kind of the opposite of that butterfly effect thing where if you go back in time, you can’t change anything. We’re coming back specifically to change it. And what I think is really cool about the show is that we are not physically jumping into a time machine and then coming back as ourselves and putting on mustaches to disguise ourselves. The only thing that's traveling back in time is our essence, our consciousness—we are taking over the bodies of people who are about to die. We [jump] into their bodies 30 seconds before they [die] and then we continue to just live on, not just in their bodies, but also in their lives. We're like spies, so the real feel of the show ends up being like The Americans . It feels like we are undercover and the body that we’ve been given to each of us, that’s our life now. \nSo, your character doesn’t actually look like Eric McCormack in the future? Exactly. Who knows what I look like? \nDo we ever get to see? Well, certainly not in Season 1. We’ll get a sense of who we are, but not what we look like. The Travelers are here like soldiers, and like soldiers, you don’t fraternize. You have a mission. But it’s very hard when part of your mission is to live someone else’s life complete with kids’ birthday parties and whatever else they have to do. So, it’s a real interesting mix that way. \nHow was your guy about to die before your essence came into him? Well, the other four Travelers, we will see their transformation in the first 10 minutes of the pilot. Me, not so much, so I’d rather not say. It’s kind of interesting. In fact, I’m not a Traveler for a little while, so we actually get to see my character before he goes. That was fun for me too to figure out how to find subtle differences. \nI like that it's not like you’re not going back to kill Hitler. Right, no. It’s a lot more subtle than that. Nowadays it’s like, whenever I start doing interviews people are like, “Oh you’re going to fix 2016? Perfect. Here’s a suggestion for you!” But A) we shot before the election and B) we’re just foot soldiers. There’s a bigger [boss], there’s someone we call the Director, who has figured out how and what we change in order for certain people to live and certain people to not live that will affect the future. So, we know almost as much as the audience does. We’re just following orders. We don’t understand why our piece of the puzzle is going to help. \nThis was all shot in Vancouver? Yes we did, which was great. And so the result was—and the American audience won’t know or care about this but—the young actors [MacKenzie Porter, Nesta Cooper, Jared Abrahamson, Reilly Dolman and Patrick Gilmore], the five of them that are with me in the show are fantastic and I think the show is going to make them breakouts. They are all Canadian. \nYou, Debra Messing, Megan Mullally and Sean Hayes did that Will & Grace pre-election short , which now has NBC talking reboot. Would you want to do that? Well, you know what? The four of us were so surprised that Max [Mutchnick, W&G executive producer] called us up and said, “OK, don’t ask how, but I’ve got the set and everything, so let's do something and help the cause.” It was so much fun to do and the response was so huge. And it’s kind of amazing too that between [director] Jimmy Burrows and our set decorators, they made it look like an episode of the show. So, when NBC came back and said, “Is there more to this?” the talk right now is that we are sort of in talks [for] maybe something limited, a little 10 episodes...but it’s going to be awhile before we can figure it out. I’m the only one with a [regular] series, but the other three could have a series at any moment. So, it is a very hard thing to schedule but we’re certainly all into it.",

      "text": "Dinsan 0 Unable to Cast Netflix To Chromecast \nThe most popular app on my Chromecast is Netflix. I am sure this is true for a lot of you here. These troubleshooting steps for Netflix on Chromecast will come handy the next time your Chromecast has a brain freeze, saying it won’t cast anything! Netflix Chromecast Not Working – The Basics \nThe first thing that I recommend doing is trying to cast from other devices within the same WiFi network, including your laptop or Chromebook . This will help you isolate the issue. If casting works from other devices, this means the issue is with the Netflix app on your phone, or may be the Home (previously Google Cast) app and not the Chromecast device itself. \nYou can also try casting from any other service, for example YouTube, to identify if the issue is related to Netflix app, or Chromecast device or its app. \nIf casting is not working from any of the devices within the same WiFi network, concentrate on troubleshooting for the Chromecast. \nHere are a few basic things to check when your are unable to cast from Netflix: Make sure that you have the latest version of the Netflix and Google Home apps installed. Netflix does not like extra characters in Chromecast’s name. Make sure that your Chromecast’s name does not have any special character. In case you have it configured with some extra characters in the name, here is how to rename your Chromecast . Try clearing cache from your Netflix app on Android. To do this, go to Settings > Apps > Netflix > Storage and touch Clear Cache. Try clearing cache for Google Home app. To do this, go to Settings > Apps > Home > Storage and touch Clear Cache. If clearing cache did not work, try deleting app’s data. This will force you to login to Netflix app again. To do this, Settings > Apps > Netflix > Storage and touch Clear Data. As a last resort, reset your Chromecast . After a reset, you will have to set up your Chromecast again. Chromecast Icon Missing From Netflix App \nHere are a few things to try when the Chromecast icon is no longer present on your Netflix app: Close the Netflix app and open it again. Restart your phone. Try clearing cache of the Netflix app on your Android phone. There Is A Problem Playing This Title At The Moment \nThis is yet another common error message while casting Netflix videos to Chromecast. Here are a few things to try: Close the Netflix app completely and try again. Restart your phone and try again. ",

      "title": "Netflix has started using Google's free VP9 compression format",
      "text": "05 Dec 2016 | Rasmus Larsen | When Netflix rolled out its new download feature, it also quietly started using Googles royalty-free VP9 compression format at scale on some mobile devices. VP9 is a free alternative to the costly HEVC compression format. Googles royalty-free VP9 format Netflix has been testing Googles VP9 format internally for some time but this is the first time that the company has used VP9 at mass scale. The company started using the VP9 format when it rolled out the new download function last week.Netflix has traditionally used the MPEG4 H.264/AVC format almost exclusively (except for 4K/HDR streaming where it uses HEVC). VP9 offers several advantages, including the ability to stream at significantly lower bitrates without compromising picture quality, says Netflix. That is important because mobile devices have limited storage space for downloaded video content or data caps on mobile data connections.- Last month, we started re-encoding our catalog to generate the new mobile bitstreams and the effort is ongoing. The mobile encodes are being used in the brand new downloads feature. In the near future, we will also use these new bitstreams for mobile streaming to broaden the benefit for Netflix members, no matter how theyre watching, says Netflix. \"VP9 is a free alternative to the costly HEVC format\" More importantly, VP9 is a royalty-free format developed by Google as an alternative to the costly HEVC format. VP9 also supports 4K streaming but Netflix has yet to adopt it for 4K, it seems. The latest version called VP9 Profile 2 supports HDR (High Dynamic Range).Only viewers downloading Netflix content on newer Android devices will get the VP9-encoded video. iPhone/iPad users will get a new mobile-optimized stream in the H.264/AVC High profile. Apple has not implemented hardware support for Googles VP9 format in its devices. Netflix video formats MPEG4 H.264: Have to date been used for everything, except 4K/HDR - royalty rates apply HEVC: Used exclusively for 4K/HDR - royalty rates apply VP9: Used to replace MPEG4 H.264 on Android mobile/tablet (only download, later streaming) - free to use Up to 36% reduced bandwidth Together with VP9, Netflix has also optimized its compression technique. In late 2015, Netflix started creating a separate compression for each title in its content catalogue. It now goes even further by dividing everything into 1-to-3 minute long chunks and then optimizing compression based on each separate chunk.Combined the new initiatives can reduce bandwidth by up to 36% on average on mobile devices, as seen below. Left side is the new AVC High that iPhone/iPad users are seeing, right side is VP9 for Android mobile users.To be clear, the above techniques are only being used for downloaded content right now but Netflix has plans to use the same techniques for mobile streaming in the near future.Netflix is also planning to use these techniques to improve picture quality for those with bandwidth to spare.By adopting VP9 at mass scale, Netflix can bring down costs and royalty payments over time. Netflix is also member of AOM (Alliance for Open Media) together with Google, Microsoft, Amazon, and others. AOM is developing a new free and open video format based on Googles work in video compression (VP9 and VP10) that will be called AV1.If you want to know more see Netflixs tech blog . Share on:",

It’s been very intense. So we’re stepping back now. We’re happy it’s out. We’re happy we talk talk about it.”\nThe Palladino’s may need a well deserved break from the world of Stars Hollow, but that doesn’t mean they’re ruling out the possibility of checking in on our favorite Gilmores somewhere down the line.\n“I don’t rule anything in my life out. When people were talking about a Gilmore movie [after the original series ended] I was always like, ‘That’s not going to happen.’ But I wasn’t going to say no. Because…why say no to anything?” Palladino told TV Line. \nThe fate of Gilmore Girls may be up in the air for now, but as long as Amy Sherman-Palladino isn’t saying no, we guess there’s always hope we may get a season two of Year in the Life !\nGilmore Girls: A Year in the Life is available to stream on Netflix now. \n\nTagged: Amy Sherman-Palladino , Gilmore Girls ",

      "text": "Netflix has been doing nostalgia better than just about anyone recently.\nAs Netflix has leaned into making its own shows, a big piece of its strategy has been reviving fan favorites like \"Full House,\" \"Arrested Development,\" and \"Gilmore Girls.\" This summer, Netflix also released smash hit \"Stranger Things,\" a  supernatural sci-fi thriller that draws heavily from '80s movies and TV. \nGiven Netflix's love of data, this commitment to nostalgia makes sense. \nIf you can see that people keep binge-watching \"Gilmore Girls\" over and over again, why not make a new series? You already know there's an audience for it. (That seems to have translated into viewership, at least for the \"Gilmore Girls\" and \"Full House\" revivals). \nBut are these revivals any good? To try and answer that question, we turned to reviews aggregator Metacritic, and looked at what the critics had to say. Here's a list of shows Netflix has brought back from the dead, ranked from worst to best critical reception, along with a short description (we excluded kids' shows).  \n'Fuller House' — 35/100 Netflix \nCritic rating:  35/100\nAudience rating:  6.4/10\nPrevious network:  ABC\nNetflix description:  \" The Tanner family's adventures continue as DJ Tanner-Fuller shares a home with her sister Stephanie and friend Kimmy who help raise her three boys.\" \n\n\n'The Killing' (Season 4) — 53/100 AMC/Netflix \nCritic rating:  53/100\nAudience rating:  8.0/10\nPrevious network: AMC\nNetflix description:  \"Seattle homicide detectives Sarah Linden and Stephen Holder are deeply affected by the murders they investigate in this dark, acclaimed crime series.\"\n\n\n'Arrested Development' (Season 4) — 72/100 Netflix \nCritic rating:  72/100\nAudience rating:  8.2 / 10\nPrevious network:  Fox\nNetflix description:  \"It's the Emmy-winning story of a wealthy family that lost everything, and the one son who had no choice but to keep them all together.\"\n\n\nSee the rest of the story at Business Insider ",

Michael Straczynski ( Babylon 5 ), Sense8 is one of Netflix's most ambitious projects. A sci-fi drama starring eight characters from different parts of the world, its first season aired in 2015. \nIn the year since season 1, there's been a significant shake-up in the Sense8 cast. Aml Ameen left the show after season 1, so the Christmas special will introduce Toby Onwumere as his replacement, playing Nairobi bus driver Capheus. \nThe two-hour Christmas special will be released at 12.01am PT on Dec. 23, with a 10-episode second season arriving in May 2017.

      "text": "Luke Cage Is Getting a Second Season from Marvel and Netflix Sunday Dec 4, 2016 at 12:01 AM Dec 4, 2016 at 7:26 PM TV Guide \nMarvel and Netflix's superhero show Luke Cage reportedly broke the internet when it launched back in September. And now, the studio (and network) are getting ready to break the internet again. As just announced with a short teaser video on Twitter, Luke Cage is returning to Harlem for a second season of fighting crime. \nThe video is right in line with most of Marvel/Netflix's teasers and announcements: a short animation, some news, and that's it. In this case, it's a slow push-in on Pop's Barber Shop, a key location in the first season, as well as the reveal of a neon sign that says \"Season 2 Coming Soon.\" \nThat's it. Always forward. #LukeCage pic.twitter.com/4pnu52KFKr — Luke Cage (@LukeCage) December 4, 2016\nWhat's most interesting to fans about the teaser is that the finale left Pop's Barber Shop destroyed (again), with the cast wondering what they could do with the location. Could Luke (Mike Colter) return to Harlem -- after being taken back to jail in the finale -- in order to bring new life to his mentor's shop? Or is it just a case of finding something simple to sell the idea of Season 2? \nWhatever happens, most likely we won't find out what'll happen with Cage and company until after the launch of the superhero mash-up Marvel's The Defenders, which teams Cage with fellow NYC based heroes Daredevil (Charlie Cox), Iron Fist (Finn Jones), and Jessica Jones (Krysten Ritter), as well as basically every other character who has ever appeared in a Marvel/Netflix series. \nTime to grab a cup of coffee and find out what's next... \n  Marvel's Luke CageMike Colter About Us",

      "text": "Filed in: Entertainment (Photo: Myles Aronowitz/Netflix) \nOn Sunday, Netflix announced that Marvel’s “Luke Cage” will be getting a second season on the streaming giant. \nNetflix announced the show’s return on Twitter and Facebook with a video of a sign in Pop’s Barber Shop that read “Season 2 coming soon” as well as the barber shop’s motto: “Always forward.” In the show, the character of Luke Cage adopts that motto in his journey of becoming a hero. \n–‘Luke Cage’ star Mike Colter responds to criticism over being married to white woman– \nThis is the third Marvel show to get a second season on Netflix, with “Daredevil” and “Jessica Jones” also being renewed for their second seasons. “Dardevil” has already aired Season 2. \nThe next show Marvel expects to put out on Netflix is “Iron Fist,” with the crossover “The Defenders” combining all four shows and their titular heroes to form a superheroic team. \nThe renewal is good news for fans, who have loved “Luke Cage.” The show has received acclaim from both fans and critics alike, with Variety ‘s Maureen Ryan saying of the show, “Nothing is cooler than watching bullets bounce off Luke Cage as he brings the ruckus and schools all the fools.” Related Posts",

As you pull yourself off the sofa and into bed after four hours of watching old 30 Rock , you feel guilty, like you just had a wank over some particularly grizzly porn. And this isn't just a weird feeling; a study released earlier this year found that people who binge watch TV are more likely to experience anxiety, depression and stress. \nSo if having a relaxing night in isn't actually relaxing, what are the other options?

      "text": "Netflix uses 'chunk' analysis on downloaded video to save space, retain quality on iPhone  24 am PT (11:24 am ET) On iOS devices, Netflix has broadened how it handles encoding videos for downloading, looking at a feature in short chunks, and making decisions on how each piece should best be handled. For Netflix's new offline viewing option, the streaming service now examines every piece in 1- to 3-minute chunks . Decisions are made on those pieces independently of the whole, to both conserve device storage space, as well as bandwidth to download. A more visually complex clip is encoded at a higher bitrate than less demanding pieces, with Netflix adding that animated pieces or shots of a relatively static blue sky need to be encoded at a far lower bitrate for the same quality, while retaining the same resolution. Netflix claims that the chunk method can save up to 19 percent on bandwidth and storage space for visually indistinguishable versions for download versus an H.264/High profile streamed copy. The new encoding method will be migrated to mobile streaming in the coming months, according to the company. In general, for iOS streaming, Netflix is using H.264/AVC with a High profile. For Android and other compatible devices, the company utilizes VP9, Google's royalty-free video codec. On Nov. 30, Netflix started letting users download select TV shows and movies from its catalog, with most of the initial offerings coming from the company's unique programming. Netflix has announced that Stranger Things , Orange is The New Black , Narcos and The Crown are now available to download, with more content coming as time goes on. Topics:",

      "text": "Source: Gilbert Carrasquillo / Getty\nMarvel’s Luke Cage will be returning to Netflix for its second season. The announcement was made with an 18-second teaser video shared via Twitter on Sunday (December 4).\nThe video zooms in on the window of Pop’s Barber Shop, which is illuminated by a neon light that reads “Season 2 Coming Soon.” While an official date has yet to be announced, it can probably be assumed that new episodes of Luke Cage will hit Netflix sometime in the new year.\nAlways forward. #LukeCage pic.twitter.com/4pnu52KFKr \n— Luke Cage (@LukeCage) December 4, 2016 \n\nFrom VIBE :\n“ As Variety reports, this make ‘Luke Cage’ the third Marvel series to receive a (well-deserved) second chance. ‘DareDevil,’ a show about a blind attorney by day (who is also fluent in Spanish) and a superhero with heightened senses at night also kicking ass in New York’s Hell’s Kitchen premiered its Second Season in 2016. And everyone’s favorite iron woman, who may also be a little emotionally stunted, ‘Jessica Jones’ will return as well. \nSeason One of ‘Luke Cage’ gave fans a lot of history. We learned how Cage became the insanely strong man he is, watched him defeat several enemies (and due so in a tailor-made suit from Dapper Dan simply for the culture) as well as develop a burgeoning romance for Rosario Dawson’s character Claire. But the last we saw Mr. Cage was on his was back to jail while an overzealous doctor may have given his worst enemy his biggest advantage.” \nShowrunner Cheo Hodari Coker also shared his excitement about the shows return, tweeting: “Sweet Christmas arrived 21 days early!” \nBald & Buff Celebrity Men 10 photos Launch gallery Bald & Buff Celebrity Men 1.

      "text": "Dec. 5 2016 11:47 AM Netflix Announces Second Seasons (and a Christmas Special) for Sense8 and Luke Cage Teaser image of Sense8 Season 2. Netflix \nThough there was little doubt, Netflix has made it official: Sense8 and Luke Cage will be returning for second seasons. In the former’s case, a Christmas special has also been announced and is set to launch on Dec. 23. \nSense8 , created and executive-produced by the Wachowski siblings ( The Matrix ), was met with mixed reviews upon its summer 2015 premiere, but reception improved once critics and viewers were able to binge it in its entirety. The series opened on eight strangers in different parts of the world as they became “sensates”—mentally and emotionally interconnected humans. From there, it explored gender, sexuality, and queer identity , with a particularly infamous orgy scene drawing attention along the way. Its second season, which includes a controversial actor replacement , will premiere May 5. Advertisement \nThe latest entrant in Netflix’s Marvel canon, Luke Cage drew attention for the strong lead performance from Mike Colter and for its intimate atmosphere—particularly, the day-to-day interactions between the residents of its Harlem community. A second season was long considered an inevitability, but as for when that season might debut, that’s very much up in the air. Netflix still has its Defenders team-up series to launch, not to mention new seasons of Jessica Jones and Daredevil . It’s reasonable to assume that the streaming service won’t be prepared to launch Luke Cage Season 2 before 2018 rolls around. Until then: — Marvel Entertainment (@Marvel) December 4, 2016 \nDavid Canfield is a Brow Beat intern. Load Comments",

      "text": "Last week, Netflix launched the one feature that binge-watchers worldwide have been wanting: support for movie downloads on mobile devices. The move is meant to help you binge on your favorite shows while you’re on the move, without worrying whether you’ve got access to a wireless network, or whether you have enough data on your cellular plan. But it turns out that Netflix also wants to help out with the obvious side-effect of downloading movies for offline viewing: killing your phone’s storage.\nDON’T MISS: Microsoft kicks off 12 Days of Deals sale: Good Windows 10, Xbox One, and VR deals\nThe easiest way to save data on downloads is to lower the resolution of movies and TV shows. But streaming giant came up with a way to save data without compromising on video quality. That means you can either download more episodes of your favorite show for less data or improve video quality for offline downloads without taking massive hits when it comes to storage.\nAs Variety explains, Netflix adopted a new video codec for downloads. Netflix uses Google’s open source VP9 codec that makes possible videos of the same video quality but with significantly less data. Or, you can get better video quality for the same amount of data. In either case, your storage does not take a hit.\nThe problem with VP9 is that it’s only used on Android but not the iPhone. Netflix has an H.264/AVC High codec to replace VP9, compared to the H.264/AVC Main is the codec it uses for streaming videos.\nHowever, Netflix didn’t give up and used a different trick to bring the same storage-saving feature to iOS devices.\nNetflix realized that different scenes in different movies need different amounts of data. The more special effects in a scene, the more data it’ll need to play on your device. To make up for the iPhone’s lack of VP9 support, Netflix decided to simply split all videos that can be downloaded on an iPhone into chunks between one and three minutes. The computer then analyzes each scene and chooses how to encode it.\nThese technologies (VP9 and splitting videos in short clips) help Netflix save some 36% data on average for videos that look the same to the human eye. When H.264/AVC High is in use, iPhone users would still save 19% of data. A more technical explanation is available on Netflix’s blog.\nNetflix could use the same new codec technology for mobile streaming in the future, and offer better quality videos to users who are on slower internet connections.\nTrending right now:\nThe Surface Pro 5 might be the Windows 10 MacBook Pro alternative you were looking for Galaxy Note 7 fires were caused by over-ambitious design, engineers find Amazon’s 15 best daily deals: Self-healing iPhone 7 cases, Sony sound bar, Christmas lights, more See the original version of this article on BGR.com",

      "text": "Tweet \nThe announcement that Netflix now allows viewers to download videos for offline viewing caused understandable excitement among subscribers. Of course, the key concern -- particularly with mobile devices -- is storage space. But thanks to a tweaked codec, Netflix has your back. \nIf you were worried that you might not be able to fit many episodes of your favorite shows on your phone or tablet, fear not. For Android users, Netflix opted to use the super-efficient VP9 codec, but as this isn’t supported by Apple, it had to think outside the box a little and ended up plumping for a custom H.264/AVC High codec for iOS users. The space savings are impressive. \nChoosing VP9 for Android downloads is hardly surprising as the codec has Google's backing and it's supported by Chrome. As revealed by Variety , using this particular codec -- in conjunction with a chunking technique that sees videos chopped into three-minute sections which are individually encoded -- Netflix is able to achieve 36 percent bandwidth savings. \nThings are not quite as impressive for iOS users, but it's good news nonetheless. Using the H.264/AVC codec with the High profiles (H.264/AVC High) Netflix has been able to achieve a 19 percent saving -- still not to be sniffed at. \nWhile these codecs are currently only used for the downloadable versions of its videos, Netflix plans to use them for streaming videos as soon as possible, as image quality can be dramatically improved. \nFull details of the encoding techniques used for iOS and Android are available on the Netflix blog .",

      "text": "Ted Sarandos Says Netflix Will Roll Out ‘About 20’ Unscripted Series in 2017   \nNetflix is diving into reality TV in a big way, according to Chief Content Officer Ted Sarandos. \nSpeaking at the UBS Global Media & Communications Conference, Sarandos said that the streaming provider will offer “about 20” unscripted series in 2017, as it moves closer to its goal of 1000 annual hours of original content production. \nNetflix, for example, is making a big bet on “Ultimate Beastmaster,” a previously announced competition series executive produced by Sylvester Stallone. The series will feature simultaneous production around the world, meaning that in South Korea viewers will see local hosts and athletes. “Beastmaster,” Sarandos said, will feature “global scale and production.” Also Read: 'Luke Cage' Renewed for Season 2 on Marvel-Friendly Netflix \nSarandos said that type of production is necessary for Netflix to stand out in the crowded reality genre. He added that Netflix already produces original content in 12 countries around the world. \n“Unscripted television is a very interesting business,” Sarandos said. “The content itself seems to be largely interchangeable. Meaning, if you want to see a show about hoarding, there are three different shows about hoarding.” Given that it’s difficult for the concepts themselves to stand out, he added, Netflix can add value in the scale of the production. var googletag = googletag || {}; googletag.cmd = googletag.cmd || []; googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.defineOutOfPageSlot('/30981161/TheWrapRemnantOOP', 'div-gpt-ad-1470167200293-0').addService(googletag.pubads()); googletag.pubads().enableSingleRequest(); googletag.enableServices(); }); googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1470167200293-0'); }); \nSarandos said that Netflix’s studio division had not yet reached the point of “diminishing returns” in its aggressive push to create more original programming to lure more subscribers. Also Read: Netflix Offers Users Ability to Download Content to Watch on the Go \nHe also turned aside a question about whether Netflix might release detailed viewership statistics. “Not at this point,” Sarandos replied. The service has been heavily criticized by many industry veterans for its lack of detailed audience measurement, a la the Nielsen ratings for TV. \nBut Sarandos remains bullish on the growth prospects for Netflix going forward. \n“I feel like we’re in the early innings of this business: :Internet television,” he said. \nRead original story Ted Sarandos Says Netflix Will Roll Out ‘About 20’ Unscripted Series in 2017  ",

      "text": "Netflix Renews Luke Cage For A Second Season Sweet Christmas indeed! \nWhat happened? Netflix has picked up a second season of its action drama Luke Cage . \nWhy has this happened? Netflix isn't dumb? I feel like there was never going to be a reason for Netflix to turn down the chance to air a show from the Marvel universe -- particularly given that the titular Luke will also be part of Netflix's upcoming team-up series, The Defenders . \nWhat do I do now? Watch the first season of Luke Cage ; it gets a bit flabby in the back half, but it's still worth watching. And given the show's explicit African-American civil rights themes, I especially look forward to seeing how current events work their way into the Season 2 storyline.",

      "text": "videos Advertisement Torrent News: Kickass Torrents coming back to life KAT.cr amid Netflix ‘Download Shows’ feature; End for torrent sites nearing? By Kanika Gupta Dec 05, 2016 10:07 AM EST Is the end for torrent sites nearing? Advertisement \nWhen Kickass Torrents owner, Artem Paulim, was convicted of copyright infringement and arrested in Poland, it spelled immediate doom for many torrent sites, including the popular KAT. However, soon enough many lookalike websites, proxies and mirrors came up to keep the torrent lovers well fed. But these websites were also served legal notices and eventually had to shut down. \nWhen Kickass Torrents went down, new scamming websites mushroomed as the users started looking for similar alternatives that allowed illegal download of media content. However, these websites asked for sensitive financial information, tricking thousands desperate users. \nThe Pirate Bay gained intense popularity and surged to top position in the wake of Kickass Torrents' fall down. However, as the authorities step up their efforts to end piracy, many such websites have either already been shutdown or face constant threat of closure. \nHowever, despite the risk, Kickass Torrents are expected to come back to life in February 2017 as KAT.cr, reported Tech Times . While The Pirate Bay and Extra Torrent are in constant danger of being terminated, Kickass is planning its comeback. \nMeanwhile, recent news reported that Netflix now allows its users to download shows to their device for offline viewing. This free of cost feature is included in the Netflix membership and is completely legal, reported Fox8 News . \nWith Google and law authorities determined to put torrent sites out of business and service providers like Amazon Prime and Netflix allowing users to download their favorite shows on their device, it seems that the end for piracy is near. Advertisement \nDespite the restriction, The Pirate Bay spokesperson said that even though the users will have to look for legitimate sources for their media content such as movies, music and TV shows, the company is not worried about their fate. They believe that the company will never be flagged by Google as a repeat offender. \nAs the rumors about legal implications of using torrent websites started doing the rounds, companies like Kickass Torrents and the Pirate Bay have every reason to be worried. However, it waits to be seen if these websites will be completely out of business someday. © 2016 HNGN , All rights reserved. Do not reproduce without permission.",

      "text": "\"Fuller House\"/Netflix \n\"Full House\" creator Jeff Franklin made headlines recently when he revealed that he had purchased the actual Tanner family home, the front of which has been seen in both the original series and its Netflix spin-off.\n\"I went a little nuts one day and decided that would be a fun house for me to own,\" he told Business Insider.\nThe four-bedroom, four-bathroom, 2,500-square-foot San Francisco house went on sale in May for the first time in about a decade for $4.15 million. The time was right for Franklin, and he nabbed it for around $4 million .\n\"Coincidentally, ‘Fuller House’ is now on the air,\" he said. \"There’s some benefit to the show to be able to go back there and shoot there and maybe we’ll have the cast come up, shoot some scenes outside of the house. I don’t know yet. We’re still waiting for a season-three pickup. It would be good for the show and it’s just fun for me to own that house.\"\nFranklin hadn't been allowed to film the property since \"Full House\" premiered in 1987. Back then, the production paid about $500 to shoot various shots for use on the show. They weren't welcomed back years later when they wanted to shoot again, because the then-owner had become annoyed by the many \"Full House\" fans who visited it. Franklin estimates about 250 fans visit the location every day.\n\"Everyone had been watching the same shot of the outside of the house for 30 years now,\" Franklin said. \"So it would be nice to get some new footage shot in 4K.\"\nFor now, Franklin has some work to do on the house. He needs to seismically retrofit it for safety in the earthquake-prone area.\n\"It’s going to be under construction for a while,\" he said. \"We’re going to make sure it doesn’t fall down on anyone.\"\nBut the show creator sees several ways buying the house will pay off, including a potential tax write-off.\n\"I don’t think it’s going to be a big money-maker for me, for sure. So yeah, it will be some kind of a write-off I hope,\" Franklin responded when we asked if he could write off the purchase for his taxes. \"But it’s more sentimental than anything. Both of these shows have just become a big part of my life. It just felt like the right thing to own it.\"\n\"Fuller House\" returns for its second season December 9 on Netflix.\nNOW WATCH: Netflix is giving part of the ‘Mythbusters’ team their own show — here’s the trailer \n",

      "text": "December 5, 2016 | 10:30AM PT Company plans to debut 20 unscripted shows next year, including 'Ultimate Beastmaster' competition series \nNetflix currently has 30 original scripted series in various stages of development or release, and in 2017 it’s going to go big on unscripted shows, according to chief content officer Ted Sarandos . \nIn 2017, Netflix plans to debut 20 unscripted shows, including global competition series, “Ultimate Beastmaster,” produced by Sylvester Stallone and “The Biggest Loser” EP Dave Broome. \nNext year Netflix’s original programming lineup will grow to up to 1,000 hours, more than doubling from 2016, and “that’s a conservative measure right now,” said Sarandos, speaking Monday at the UBS Global Media & Communications Conference in New York. \n“Unscripted television is a very interesting business,” Sarandos said, saying the company is focusing on shows that are “more likely to travel internationally.” For example, “Ultimate Beastmaster” will feature athletes and announcers from six different countries (the U.S., Brazil, South Korea, Mexico, Germany and Japan). “When ‘Beastmaster’ hits in Korea, they’ll never have seen anything like it.” \nSarandos reiterated Netflix’s previous guidance that the company plans to spend about $6 billion in 2017 on content on a profit-and-loss basis, up from $5 billion in 2016. With the boost in production on originals, that will take up a bigger chunk of the overall content budget, and Netflix execs have said they’re aiming to have 50% of the content on its service to be originals . \nSarandos called supernatural thriller “Stranger Things” a milestone for the company, because it was the first original series developed in-house and produced by Netflix. The show’s creators, the Duffer Brothers, pitched the show 19 times before they took it to Netflix, according to Sarandos. “I knew it was something special,” he said about “Stranger Things,” although he acknowledged that he was surprised by the level of social-media engagement the show has created. Netflix is now in production on season 2 of the show. \nHowever, Sarandos added, “I don’t want to get trapped in that model” of producing every original series or film in-house. He cited the Netflix reboot of “Gilmore Girls,” which was licensed from Warner Bros. “Warner Bros. owned the IP. There was no model I could do that myself. We had a unique ability to do it,” Sarandos said. \nBig TV bets that Netflix has made include “The Crown,” the show about the young Queen Elizabeth II and the British royal family. In January, the company will premiere “Lemony Snicket’s A Series Of Unfortunate Events,” based on the book franchise and starring Neal Patrick Harris. “If this was a movie, it would be a big movie,” Sarandos said. In addition, he called out shows Netflix has greenlit to date including “Santa Clarita Diet,” starring Drew Barrymore and Timothy Olyphant, new series from David Fincher, “Mind Hunter,” about the early days of serial-killer profiling in FBI. \n“What we try to do is take very measured swings for the fences, if that’s possible,” he said. \nAsked about whether Netflix would ever be interested in acquiring sports rights, Sarandos — as he has repeatedly in the past — said the company is not a great vehicle for live programming. “Today, don’t look for us to be bidding for league rights,” he said, but added that “league creation might be interesting.” Filed Under:",

      "text": "(\"Fuller House\"/Netflix) \n\"Full House\" creator Jeff Franklin made headlines recently when he revealed that he had purchased the actual Tanner family home, the front of which has been seen in both the original series and its Netflix spin-off. \n\"I went a little nuts one day and decided that would be a fun house for me to own,\" he told Business Insider.\nThe four-bedroom, four-bathroom, 2,500-square-foot San Francisco house went on sale in May for the first time in about a decade for $4.15 million. The time was right for Franklin, and he nabbed it for around $4 million .\n\"Coincidentally, ‘Fuller House’ is now on the air,\" he said. \"There’s some benefit to the show to be able to go back there and shoot there and maybe we’ll have the cast come up, shoot some scenes outside of the house. I don’t know yet. We’re still waiting for a season-three pickup. It would be good for the show and it’s just fun for me to own that house.\"\nFranklin hadn't been allowed to film the property since \"Full House\" premiered in 1987. Back then, the production paid about $500 to shoot various shots for use on the show. They weren't welcomed back years later when they wanted to shoot again, because the then-owner had become annoyed by the many \"Full House\" fans who visited it. Franklin estimates about 250 fans visit the location every day.\n\"Everyone had been watching the same shot of the outside of the house for 30 years now,\" Franklin said. \"So it would be nice to get some new footage shot in 4K.\"\nFor now, Franklin has some work to do on the house. He needs to seismically retrofit it for safety in the earthquake-prone area.\n\"It’s going to be under construction for a while,\" he said. \"We’re going to make sure it doesn’t fall down on anyone.\"\nBut the show creator sees several ways buying the house will pay off, including a potential tax write-off.\n\"I don’t think it’s going to be a big money-maker for me, for sure. So yeah, it will be some kind of a write-off I hope,\" Franklin responded when we asked if he could write off the purchase for his taxes. \"But it’s more sentimental than anything. Both of these shows have just become a big part of my life. It just felt like the right thing to own it.\"\n\"Fuller House\" returns for its second season December 9 on Netflix.\nNOW WATCH: Netflix is giving part of the ‘Mythbusters’ team their own show — here’s the trailer \n\nMore From Business Insider \nA 'Fuller House' star makes his directing debut on the new season, and the creator was 'nervous' \nHere are the most popular Netflix original shows ranked, according to a research company \nHere's how many people are watching one of Netflix's most expensive shows yet — and it's not great",

But somehow Spectral flew in under my fanboy radar, and I have no idea how. \nThe directing debut of Nic Mathieu, this upcoming feature was originally supposed to be released theatrically by Universal Pictures, only for them to abandon the project along Netflix to swoop in and save the day as they’ve been doing with increased frequency later. And Spectral is a good acquisition for the media streaming service, as it helps to increase their repertoire when it comes to genre films. And it doesn’t get more “genre” than this: A dystopian sci-fi military ghost thriller. Yes, all those words do actually belong next to each other in that order. \nAnd if the appeal of Dale, alongside that particular niche genre was not enough to get you intrigued, the Netflix production also stars fan-favourite veterans Emily Mortimer, Max Martini and Bruce Greenwood. To add to all that talent, the film’s script also boasts the writing skills of George Nolfi ( Salt, The Adjustment Bureau ), John Gatins ( Real Steel , Kong: Skull Island ), and Jamie Moss ( Street King ). And it actually looks pretty cool, with some top notch visual effects and surprisingly interesting narrative hook. \nBut don’t take my word for it. Check out the first trailer below, which was released over the weekend. \nSpectral will drop on Netflix this coming Friday, December 9, 2016. Share this:",

      "text": "Netflix goes big on unscripted programming with 20 original shows planned for 2017 Posted “Bullsh*t and spin”: Autonomy founder mocks HP’s $5B fraud suit against him \nNetflix is making headway on its ambitions to fill half its library with original content. According to Netflix’s Chief Content Officer Ted Sarandos, the company is planning to release about 20 unscripted series next year, bringing it closer to its goal of having 1,000 annual hours of original programming available on its service in 2017. \nThat’s more than the amount of original programming available on Netflix this year, but even so, Sarandos says that the 1,000-plus hours was a “conservative measure.” (Netflix had earlier said that it was aiming for 600 hours of originals in 2016, up from 450 in 2015.) \nHe also restated that Netflix is planning to spend roughly $6 billion in original content on a profit-and-loss basis in 2017, up from $5 billion this year, Variety reports . \nAmid increased competition from new streaming services, Netflix believes that its investment in its own programming will help differentiate its service from rivals, while also simplifying the licensing situation. \nIn addition, unlike with mainstream TV networks, Netflix can target niche audiences with its original programming – something that can help it attract more subscribers. \nToday, it has 30 original scripted series in development or release, and now it’s planning to expand further into unscripted shows. \nSpeaking at the UBS Global Media & Communications Conference, Sarandos referred to unscripted programming as “a very interesting business.” He explained that Netflix’s advantage in this genre is not necessarily that it can come up with unique concepts, but its ability to scale its shows worldwide. \n“The content itself seems to be largely interchangeable. Meaning, if you want to see a show about hoarding, there are three different shows about hoarding,” said Sarandos, as reported by The Wrap. \nAs an example, the exec mentioned Netflix’s previously announced investment in “Ultimate Beastmaster,” a reality competition series produced by Sylvester Stallone and and “The Biggest Loser” exec producer Dave Broome. The series will include six country-specific versions – taking place in the U.S., Brazil, South Korea, Mexico, Germany and Japan – each filmed in their own language, with local competitors and local hosts. \nSarandos also offered a brief update on Netflix’s other efforts in original content, including its investment in feature films. He said the Adam Sandler films Netflix made are popular, but didn’t detail how many customers were viewing them. However, he did note that movies in general account for a third of subscriber viewing on Netflix. \nAdditionally, Sarandos dismissed the idea of bringing live sports to Netflix’s service. Though the exec had said last year the company was open to the idea, it would only get involved if it owned and created the event itself. In other words, Netflix doesn’t plan on bidding on the rights to live sporting events anytime soon. \nToday, Sarandos repeated that position , saying “don’t look for us to be bidding for league rights,” but said that league creation may be something the company could be interested in.

      "text": "Chelsea Lauren/Variety/REX/Shutterstock   \nNetflix chief content officer Ted Sarandos threw cold water on the notion that the company was interested in being acquired, saying the large and diverse nature of a hypothetical media-conglomerate parent would present difficulties for Netflix to maintain its pure-play business model. \n“We’ve been maniacally focused on one product,” said Sarandos, speaking at the UBS Global Media & Communications Conference on Monday. “We sell a product in a way big companies aren’t able to do because they’re so big.” Related Netflix Has 30 Original Series Today, Will Double That in 2017, Content Chief Ted Sarandos Says \nSarandos was responding to a question about whether Netflix would benefit from being acquired by a bigger player. Rumors have kicked around Wall Street recently that Disney might be interested in buying Netflix . Speculation also has surfaced that a big tech company like Apple might make a play for Netflix; Apple CEO Tim Cook in October said the company was “open to acquisitions of any size” that are strategically aligned with its businesses. \nSarandos, in his comments at the UBS conference, noted that with large media congloms, one division makes programming and another buys it — and sometimes they can’t sell it to themselves. The inter-company conflicts within those companies would “make it difficult to stay as disciplined as we’ve been,” Sarandos said. Related Netflix Investors Apparently Excited Over Disney Acquisition Rumor \nAt the same time, Sarandos said that “consolidation will be a necessary outcome” in the media business as the pay-TV sector continues to struggle and advertising rates decline. \nAlso at the UBS conference, Sarandos said Netflix will double its original series slate in 2017 , up from 30 that are in production or released today. That’s set to include some 20 unscripted TV shows, including Sylvester Stallone’s “Ultimate Beastmaster” reality competition series. Filed Under:",

      "text": "Netflix’s offline downloads have a neat trick to save iPhone storage space Chris Smith Pin it Share Last week, Netflix launched the one feature that binge-watchers worldwide have been wanting: support for movie downloads on mobile devices. The move is meant to help you binge on your favorite shows while you’re on the move, without worrying whether you’ve got access to a wireless network, or whether you have enough data on your cellular plan. But it turns out that Netflix also wants to help out with the obvious side-effect of downloading movies for offline viewing: killing your phone’s storage. DON’T MISS: Microsoft kicks off 12 Days of Deals sale: Good Windows 10, Xbox One, and VR deals The easiest way to save data on downloads is to lower the resolution of movies and TV shows. But streaming giant came up with a way to save data without compromising on video quality. That means you can either download more episodes of your favorite show for less data or improve video quality for offline downloads without taking massive hits when it comes to storage. As Variety explains, Netflix adopted a new video codec for downloads. Netflix uses Google’s open source VP9 codec that makes possible videos of the same video quality but with significantly less data. Or, you can get better video quality for the same amount of data. In either case, your storage does not take a hit. The problem with VP9 is that it’s only used on Android but not the iPhone. Netflix has an H.264/AVC High codec to replace VP9, compared to the H.264/AVC Main is the codec it uses for streaming videos. However, Netflix didn’t give up and used a different trick to bring the same storage-saving feature to iOS devices. Netflix realized that different scenes in different movies need different amounts of data. The more special effects in a scene, the more data it’ll need to play on your device. To make up for the iPhone’s lack of VP9 support, Netflix decided to simply split all videos that can be downloaded on an iPhone into chunks between one and three minutes. The computer then analyzes each scene and chooses how to encode it. These technologies (VP9 and splitting videos in short clips) help Netflix save some 36% data on average for videos that look the same to the human eye. When H.264/AVC High is in use, iPhone users would still save 19% of data. A more technical explanation is available on Netflix’s blog. Netflix could use the same new codec technology for mobile streaming in the future, and offer better quality videos to users who are on slower internet connections. Trending right now:",

      "text": "LUKE CAGE Always Forward With Second Season Order from NETFLIX By Chris Arrant, Editor December 5, 2016 06:11am ET Credit: Marvel Television / Netflix \nMarvel Television's Luke Cage has been renewed for a second season on Netflix. Take a look at this announcement video, and pay attention to the locale: — Luke Cage (@LukeCage) December 4, 2016 \nViewers of Luke Cage will recognize the Pop's Barber Shop storefront, restored from the shot-up condition it was in at the end of the season. The usage of this to promote a second season seems to indicate that Luke Cage (played by Mike Colter) and Bobby Fish (Ron Cephas Jones) did indeed restore the shop. \nWith this second season renewal, Luke Cage joins a busy line-up of upcoming shows for Marvel Television: 2017's Iron Fist, The Punisher , and Defenders , as well as the unscheduled third season of Daredevil and second of Jessica Jones .Over on ABC, Marvel TV has Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., the upcoming Inhumans , Damage Control , and the John Ridley-fronted project. Outside of that, they also have Cloak & Dagger ( Freeform ), Runaways (Hulu), and a third untitled comedy project with ABC Studios. \nNo release date or production schedule for Luke Cage has been given; Colter is currently filming Defenders .

      "text": "print Netflix head of content Ted Sarandos Cindy Ord/Getty Images \nNo matter what movies Netflix has on its service, subscribers spend about a third of their time watching films on Netflix, according to the company's content boss Ted Sarandos. \nOn Monday at the UBS Gobal Media and Communications conference in New York, Sarandos was asked about the perceived sparseness of Netflix's movie offerings. \"No matter what, we end up with about 1/3 of our watching being movies,\" he responded. \nSarandos cited two contrasting examples: the US and Canada. In Canada, Netflix has five major movie studio output deals, while in the US, it basically has none, with the exception of the just-starting Disney one. And yet in both places, Netflix sees about 1/3 of its viewing being movies. \nResearch earlier this year showed that Netflix's selection of IMDb's 200 highest-rated movies had gone down in the past two years by a substantial amount , as had its total catalog of movies . And g iven what Sarandos revealed Monday about the viewing habits of Netflix subscribers, that decision makes total sense. Why would you pay a bunch of money for blockbuster movie deals if it's not going to make people watch more Netflix? The future of movies \nSarandos went on to say that Netflix needs to find a way to really differentiate itself in the movie business. \nIf you take a film that that does well at the box office, and get it 7-10 months later on your streaming service, that's not going to create a ton of value, he explained. \"If you were passionate [about the movie], you've already seen it,\" he said. Netflix is \"happy to have\" some of those movies, but the audience isn't particularly passionate (hence the \"1/3 no matter\" what pattern). \nDisney's 'Moana' Walt Disney Animation Studios \nBut there are ways Netflix can elevate its movie strategy. \nAn exception Sarandos pointed to was Disney, which puts out movies people like to watch over and over again, he said. The new Disney deal is a chance for Netflix to shine. He also mentioned Netflix's original film strategy, which is still in its early stages. He said he wanted Netflix to put out original movies people would go to see in theaters, and pointed to the new Will Smith vehicle \"Bright\" as a big test. That's a movie you'll be able to see on Netflix the day it comes out. \nThe bottom line: Netflix still seems to be experimenting with how to make a winning movie strategy that fits the company's goals and bottom line. And if you're a movie buff who has felt like Netflix hasn't exactly been catering to your interests in the past few years, you're not imagining things.

      "text": "Cindy Ord/Getty Images \nNo matter what movies Netflix has on its service, subscribers spend about a third of their time watching films on Netflix, according to the company's content boss Ted Sarandos.\nOn Monday at the UBS Gobal Media and Communications conference in New York, Sarandos was asked about the perceived sparseness of Netflix's movie offerings. \"No matter what, we end up with about 1/3 of our watching being movies,\" he responded.\nSarandos cited two contrasting examples: the US and Canada. In Canada, Netflix has five major movie studio output deals, while in the US, it basically has none, with the exception of the just-starting Disney one. And yet in both places, Netflix sees about 1/3 of its viewing being movies. \nResearch earlier this year showed that  Netflix's selection of IMDb's 200 highest-rated movies had  gone down in the past two years by a substantial amount , as had its total catalog of movies . And g iven what Sarandos revealed Monday about the viewing habits of Netflix subscribers, that decision makes total sense. Why would you pay a bunch of money for blockbuster movie deals if it's not going to make people watch more Netflix? \nThe future of movies Sarandos went on to say that Netflix needs to find a way to really differentiate itself in the movie business.\nIf you take a film that that does well at the box office, and get it 7-10 months later on your streaming service, that's not going to create a ton of value, he explained. \"If you were passionate [about the movie], you've already seen it,\" he said. Netflix is \"happy to have\" some of those movies, but the audience isn't particularly passionate (hence the \"1/3 no matter\" what pattern).\nCindy Ord/Getty Images But there are ways Netflix can elevate its  movie strategy. \nAn exception Sarandos pointed to was Disney, which puts out movies people like to watch over and over again, he said. The new Disney deal is a chance for Netflix to shine. He also mentioned Netflix's original film strategy, which is still in its early stages. He said he wanted Netflix to put out original movies people would go to see in theaters, and pointed to the new Will Smith vehicle \"Bright\" as a big test. That's a movie you'll be able to see on Netflix the day it comes out.\nThe bottom line: Netflix still seems to be experimenting with how to make a winning movie strategy that fits the company's goals and bottom line. And if you're a movie buff who has felt like Netflix hasn't exactly been catering to your interests in the past few years, you're not imagining things.\nNOW WATCH: This science-backed 7-minute workout is all you need to get back in shape \n",

(Photo by Andy Kropa/Invision/AP) \nNetflix – 2016(LOS ANGELES) — Here’s a one-two-three punch of good news for fans of Netflix’s Marvel series. \nThe acclaimed series Luke Cage , staring Mike Colter as a near-indestructible ex-con fighting crime in Harlem, will return for a second season. The announcement came in the form of a short video posted to social media . \nThe character, along with fellow Marvel heroes Daredevil, Jessica Jones, and Iron Fist, will be part of a planned Defenders miniseries on the subscription service. \nThe standalone Iron Fist series will now officially debut March 17, 2017. The series centers on Finn Jones’ Danny Rand, the son of a murdered billionaire, who earns the right to wield a mystic fighting power. \nIn a final bit of news, Jessica Jones , which starred Krysten Ritter as a young woman whose superhero career was cut short due to a personal tragedy, has just been released on DVD and Blu-ray. \nWhile each hero is different, Marvel Television President Jeph Loeb tells ABC Radio that every Marvel series has one thing in common: story and characters come first. \nHe says of Luk e Cage , “The fact that it’s connected [with fans] in the same kind of way that Jessica Jones connected on another level, and the same kind of way Daredevil connected on another level — the same kind of way [ Agents of ] S.H.I.E.L.D. has somehow managed to become the show people really wanna watch with families —what we’re trying to do is what Marvel has done forever, which is just tell stories that people wanna see.” \nMarvel is owned by Disney, the parent company of ABC News. \nCopyright © 2016, ABC Radio.

      "text": "Tweet \nWelcome to your December 2016 Top 50 Movies on Netflix list where we find the best movies currently streaming on Netflix US. \nYou might have noticed that Top Gun lasted as long in our list as a tank of fuel in an F15. Shame. But December sees yet another batch of excellent new entries in our Top 50 movies list. When we first started, the list included some titles that we suggested you watch because they were poor. The good news is that, over time, our list has been self-cleansing and getting stronger; all the movies in the list now merit a viewing for positive reasons. We are not claiming that these are the best 50 movies ever made, but we offer them as a selection from Netflix in good faith as a list of 50 great movies to watch. 50. Dirty Mary, Crazy Larry – 1974 \nTake three idiots, a bank robbery and lots of car chases and throw them into a movie. Dirty Mary, Crazy Larry doesn’t have much of a plot, and it probably doesn’t need one. The characters are all likeable, as idiots their dialogue is hilarious and the situations they get themselves into are all tremendous fun. This movie never quite achieved cult status but it probably ought to have done. Peter Fonda and Susan George deliver some fine entertainment with a nice twist at the end. 49. Pee-wee’s Big Holiday – 2016 \nPee-wee for many was a staple of their childhood. Whether it was from his series or a couple of movies, he was everywhere and such a great figure for kids. It was to many people’s surprise when Netflix announced a brand new movie decades after his last. The result was a true reboot for the character and confirmed Paul Rueben is still one of the best in his field. 48. Tarzan – 1999 \nWhether it’s from the fantastic soundtrack that accompanies the movie or the heart-warming story, Tarzan is an animated movie for the whole family. After two explorers perish at the hand of a tiger, their baby is left all alone, but when a chimpanzee takes him in and raises him as her own, he becomes Tarzan. Now all grown up, he’s forced into a situation of meeting another human for the first time which is an odd experience for Tarzan. It’s a superb Disney movie and also has many fan theories about how it’s linked to other Disney movies too. 47. The Last King – 2016 \nWe know you have been waiting a long time for a bit of 13th-century Norwegian history and here it is. A fine piece of work from the Oscar nominated Nils Gaup, this is the tale of the hidden illegitimate son of the king and a story that, genuinely changed Norway’s history. Actually, you can’t change history but you know what we mean. The photography is excellent and there’s some gentle comedy and plenty of excitement. Some of the acting is rather understated but generally the movie holds together well for foreign audiences. 46. Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon: Sword of Destiny – 2016 \nThe original Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon came exploding out of China, subtitled, in 2000. The miracles, spirits and gods of ancient China were delivered with mind numbing cinematography, and there was a brief flurry of similar movies (Hero, House of Flying Daggers, etc.) that caught the western imagination. Is this Netflix Original sequel as good? Probably not. But the English language makes it easy to watch, and the story is compelling. 45. The Fast and the Furious (2001)/The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift (2006) \nWe’ve bundled these two together because we stopped counting at 7. This is a working franchise if you like cars and action sequences and thin story lines. Good photography is necessary to bring a movie of this ilk, and none of the series fails on that score. But these are movies for the boys which were never going to change the world. If there’s a message, it is “don’t try this at home”. 44. The Babadook – 2014 \nLooking to soil your pants? Sold. Being awarded with the Empire Award for best horror, the Babadook takes your childhood fears and multiplies them to the point where you’re actually that scared little boy/girl who is afraid of the monster under your bed. This haunting tale tells the story of how one child’s book manages to come to life when the monster of said book, haunts their family home. It was an Australian and Canadian movie collaboration, and the result is one of the scariest horror movies on Netflix. 43. The Doors – 1991 \nThe Doors is another docudrama with plenty of top music from director Oliver Stone. Val Kilmer and Meg Ryan star in this window on the 1960s and the life and early death of the enigmatic Jim Morrison. Morrison descended into alcoholism and was 27 when he disappeared in Paris. This was a James Dean live fast die young life that captured everyones imagination and typified the rock culture in California at the time. Like all Stone docudrama’s it liberal with the facts but for lovers of the Doors music, this is a must. 42. The Wedding Planner – 2001 \nOozing charm through it’s characters, storyline and cast, the Wedding Planner is a rather formulaic rom-com. Jennifer Lopez puts in a competent performance in the starring role and Matthew McConaughey plays a good part opposite. It has to be said that not all the comedy works and the movie has rather too many flat spots. But don’t let that deter you if Rom-Com is your thing. If you’re getting married in the near future, ask yourself the question… 41. Sliding Doors – 1998 \nSliding Doors is definitely a chick flick. The lovely Gwyneth Paltrow (hasn’t she got a long neck) exists in two lives; one where she catches a train and the other where doesn’t. You’ve probably twigged that this is not a true story. As an examination of parallel universes and time travel it’s hardly science fiction but it’s pleasantly thought provoking and the acting is fine. And now it’s time to catch a train.

      "text": "Tweet \nThe first week of December brings a mass of 72 titles to the screens of Australian Netflix, an incredible amount consisting of 47 Movies, 11 Documentaries and 14 new TV series. Out of such a large amount we have chosen 3 that we feel are worth a mention this week. \nOur first pick is technically 2 picks in one, lucky you! This Christmas you will be able to settle down and watch both versions of ‘Miricle on 34th Street’, the 1947 and the 1994 film. So if you’re the sort of person who prefers classic original, you won’t be disappointed. \nNext, we have chosen a very different genre of film. ‘The Shining’ a cult classic Horror film about a family in an isolated hotel. Many horror fans will probably agree that it is an iconic Horror film that is a truly brilliant psychological horror that you can now enjoy on Netflix. \nLastly, Season 3 of the popular TV series ‘Hannibal’ has been added to Australia’s screens and is a crime drama following Hannibal Lecter from the books; Red Dragon, The Silence of the Lambs, Hannibal, Hannibal Rising. If you were someone who read and enjoyed those books you are guaranteed to enjoy this TV thriller. \nRead on for the full list of all 72 new releases: 47 New Movies Streaming to Netflix Australia \nWilly Wonka & the Chocolate Factory (1971) Thirteen Ghosts (2001) Something’s Gotta Give (2003) Some Like It Hot (1959) Shakespeare in Love (1998) Miracle on 34th Street (1947) Miracle on 34th Street (1994) Miami Vice (2006) Josie and the Pussycats (2001) A Heavy Heart (2015) God’s Not Dead 2 (2016) Freddy Got Fingered (2001) Drone: This is No Game (2014) Behond Bollywood (2013)",

We’ve got you covered on all of the best Netflix Original series as well as picks from your favourite networks including The CW, AMC, Showtime, ABC, NBC and Fox here too. We’ve tried to pick something for everyone and we think we’ve achieved just that. \nThe list has stayed relatively the same with a few noticeable changes. We’ve dropped Friends further down the list to allow for newer shows to flourish up the top. We’ve included Gilmore Girls for the first time given the release of the new four part special and sadly, that means The X-Files has dropped from our list. 50. Revenge \nIf there was ever a series that does what it says on the tin then it’s Revenge. ABC ran 5 seasons of Revenge which involves our protagonist being abducted at an early age and she grows up she returns to her birthplace to destroy the people that helped her get abducted in the first place. It’s a great show by ABC and one of the few from the network to include the amount of violence there is here. 49. Heartland \nHeartland is a fan-favorite as I discovered when I first covered the show last year. Little did I know that a small country drama made in Canada had as big of a following as I would have ever have imagined. I then realised it’s no fluke as it’s a well-crafted show with characters you care about and its realism is what sets itself aside from the competition. 48. Malcolm in the Middle \nBefore Bryan Cranston was our favorite meth cook he was the nutty father of Malcolm, a smart kid who’s stuck in the middle of a dysfunctional and stupid family. It’s likely to hit all the right notes if you watched the series when you were younger and still holds up very well against current sitcoms. All 7 seasons are available on Netflix. 47. Supergirl \nSuerpgirl first debuted on Netflix in September 2016 and introduced millions of Netflixers to the new world of Supergirl. Portrayed by Melissa Benoist, it tells her origin story and her adventures as part of the DEO, an agency set up to fight threats of aliens that come to Earth. The series first was part of CBS but eventually moved over to The CW and given the deal in place between Netflix and the CW, we got the first 46. Hell on Wheels \nSticking with the historic TV series now is Hell on Wheels. The Western show is really the only one of its kind on TV nowadays and that’s quite sad. With that said it’s certainly one of the best Western shows ever made but often gets looked over compared to AMC’s bigger shows. It follows Cullen Bohannon and his search for his wife’s killer. 45. Mad Men \nMad Men isn’t for everyone; there’s no getting over that. It’s slow but calculated and isn’t your ordinary action thriller either. It’s set in the 1960’s in the cut-throat ad agency is about the staff that work their and their interactions with everyone else in the 60’s in Manhattan. It’s stylish and elegant and the complete show is now available to stream on Netflix. 44. Bloodline \nAt number 48 we have the first season of the Netflix Original Bloodline. From the creator of Damages comes this thriller series which sees a family’s reunion crashed from an unwanted brother that promises to bring up the past to disrupt the festivities. Season 1 has left us with many unanswered questions and looks to grow from strength to strength each season. 43. iZombie \nChomping its way into 40th position is iZombie. The CW show landed on a network that’s mostly known for its superhero roles, and while she could technically be classed as a superhero, she’s probably not your typical one. After being bit by a zombie on a boat party, a young girl with everything to look forward to in life finds a job at the morgue to satisfy her craving for brains. When she eats the brain, she gets a flashback of that person’s life making her extra handy when it comes to finding killers. 42. Sense8 \nWho knew what a TV series from the Wachowskis could be like especially after some questionable movies in the past five years. It delivered however as it told the story of 8 individuals around the world who are connected on a strange supernatural level. It’s production values are through the roof and given it’s a Netflix Original it’s the only place you can watch it and you definitely should. 41. Luke Cage \nLuke Cage is the newest member of The Defenders with his own series that debuted on Netflix in September 2016. The series was highly praised and deals with social issues a lot more than other Marvel series. It’s not quite up there with Daredevil or Jessica Jones but still stands strong.",

While the site found success as a streaming service for films and television shows, the ventures into original series' and films have turned Netflix into an absolute juggernaut. \nNetflix is now the production team behind some of the world's most celebrated TV series, like House Of Cards, Orange Is The New Black, Narcos, Stranger Things, Master Of None, Daredevil, Luke Cage , Jessica Jones , and many more. \nFans are already looking forward to the network's slate of new shows in 2017, with series' like A Series Of Unfortunate Events , Iron Fist, The Defenders , and The Punisher given premiere dates. \nAccording to Variety , Netflix has much more in store for 2017 than everyone thought. When the site spoke with Netflix Chief content officer Ted Sarandos, he spoke on the big plans the network has in store. \nIn addition to the 30 shows currently in production, Netflix is moving forward with 20 new unscripted series that are set to release next year. \nSarandos commented that unscripted shows are the next big thing in television, and that they are vastly different from the traditional series people are used to. Part of the reason they expect success with these new shows, is their ability to appeal to a worldwide audience. Sarandos said shows like Beastmaster , one of their planned unscripted series, are \"more likely to travel internationally.\" \nWith all of this unscripted television planned, Netflix is expected to produce at least 1000 hours of original content in 2017, but that could be a conservative estimate.",

      "text": "Luke Cage is getting a second season from Marvel and Netflix   Alexander Zalben, \nMarvel and Netflix's superhero show Luke Cage reportedly broke the internet when it launched back in September. And now, the studio (and network) are getting ready to break the internet again: as just announced with a short teaser video on Twitter, Luke Cage is returning to Harlem for a second season of fighting crime. \nThe video is right in line with most of Marvel/Netflix's teasers and announcements... A short animation, some news, and that's it. In this case, it's a slow push-in on Pop's Barber Shop, a key location in the first season; and the reveal of a neon sign that says \"Season 2 Coming Soon.\" \nThat's it. — Luke Cage (@LukeCage) December 4, 2016 \nWhat's most interesting about the teaser to fans is that the finale left Pop's Barber Shop destroyed (again), with the cast wondering what they could do with the location. Could Luke ( Mike Colter ) return to Harlem -- after being taken back to jail in the finale -- in order to bring new life to his mentor's shop? Or is it just a case of finding something simple to sell the idea of Season 2? \nWhatever happens, most likely we won't find out what'll happen with Cage and company until after the launch of the superhero mash-up Marvel's The Defenders , which teams Cage with fellow NYC based heroes Daredevil ( Charlie Cox ), Iron Fist ( Finn Jones ), and Jessica Jones ( Krysten Ritter ), as well as basically every other character who has ever appeared in a Marvel/Netflix series. \nTime to grab a cup of coffee and find out what's next...",
