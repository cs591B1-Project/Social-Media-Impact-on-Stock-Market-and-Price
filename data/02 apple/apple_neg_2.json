Those who sign up for one month will get a free Amazon Fire TV Stick. \nThe Apple TV currently retails for $149 while Amazon's Fire TV Stick goes for $39.99. At $35 per month, both offers are cheaper than buying the respective devices outright. \nAT&T declined to comment. AT&T to launch streaming DirecTV service, no dish required \nThe devices will become de facto \"cable boxes\" for DirecTV Now, allowing you to open the app to watch live TV on your television, though you would also be able to use them to watch Netflix, Hulu, HBO or any number of the other apps available. \nSimilar to rival services such as Dish-owned Sling TV, DirecTV Now streams channels over the internet allowing you to also watch from a computer, tablet or phone, untethering you from needing a traditional set-top box and satellite. Sling offers those who prepay for three months of its $20 per month service a free Roku streaming stick (a $49.99 device). \nIn addition to details on devices, Variety also gleaned some information about the channels the service will offer. Among some of the titles spotted were Galavision, Univision and UniMas, Fox and MundoFox, CBS, HDNet Movies, the Hallmark Channel and the Sony Movie Channel. \nAT&T has announced it plans to carry channels from Disney and NBC, including ABC and ESPN, though as with other streaming services exactly which networks — particularly broadcast networks ABC, CBS, NBC and Fox — will be carried in which markets remains unclear. AT&T adds HGTV, Food Network to video service \nThe telecom giant has previously said the service will offer more than 100 channels. A free ad-supported version of the service called DirecTV Preview will also be available, although what channels it will get is also unknown. \nAlso unknown: when exactly AT&T will launch the service, though the company has previously said it plans to launch before the end of the year. \nFollow Eli Blumenthal on Twitter @eliblumenthal .

      "text": "Apple Pay Offers Discounts For The Holidays   10:01 PST \nThe holiday season is upon us and Apple wants you to use its payments service to pay for stuff, assuming you own one of the company’s compatible devices that support Apple Pay. It’s going to offer discounts, rewards, and free rush shipping to customers who use Apple Pay on the web to make purchases. Users are required to have a Touch ID compatible device like an iPhone 7 or a new MacBook Pro in order to qualify for these incentives. \nApple has launched this promotion with partners that include Adidas, Grubhub, Jet, Instacart, JackThreads, Overstock, Shopify, and many more. Additional partners will jump on the bandwagon as well with their own promotions for customers paying with Apple Pay, they include Tumi, Poshmark, Warby Parker, Abercrombie & Fitch, and others. \nThe one basic condition here is that customers pay using Apple Pay on the web . For that, they will need to use Safari on a compatible device like the iPhone 7 or the new MacBook Pro. It’s only then will customers get free rush shipping, rewards, and discounts. \nThe details of all of the incentives offered by its partners to those who pay using Apple Pay are mentioned in a separate section on the Apple Pay website. Additional terms and conditions may apply so customers would do well to see the applicable partner website for more details. \nFiled in Apple . Read more about apple pay . Related Articles",

      "text": "Share View photos An Apple logo is seen in the window of an authorised apple reseller store in Galway, Ireland August 30, 2016. REUTERS/Clodagh Kilcoyne More DUBLIN (Reuters) - Ireland's government will this week formally submit its appeal against the European Commission's multi-billion-euro demand for back taxes from Apple, Finance Minister Michael Noonan said on Tuesday. Ireland's cabinet agreed in September to join the iPhone maker in appealing the Commission's order that the U.S. tech giant pay up to 13 billion euros to Dublin after ruling the firm had received illegal state aid. Dublin is seeking to protect a tax regime that has attracted many multinational employers. The European Commission decision has also angered Washington, which accuses it of trying to grab tax revenue that should go to the United States. \"The government fundamentally disagrees with the European Commission's analysis and the decision left no choice but to take an appeal to the European Courts and this will be submitted tomorrow,\" Noonan told a European Parliament committee in Brussels.

      "text": "Home > Apple > Apple reportedly invests in Omnifone staff and… Apple reportedly invests in Omnifone staff and technology to beef up Apple Music November 8, 2016 10:14 AM Apple Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends \nOne of the more competitive services in the technology industry is streaming music. A number of companies are duking it out for control of the multi-billion dollar market, from Pandora to Spotify to Apple Music and more. Companies are seeking out every advantage they can to grab on to a few more subscribers. \nApple, in particular, has been aggressive in this space, which is particularly important to it given the slowdown in hardware sales across the board. One tactic Apple has often turned to when it needs a component to flesh out a winning strategy is acquisitions. It pulled out the wallet recently in picking up some assets from now-defunct streaming service Omnifone, as Techcrunch reports . \nMore: Check out our comparison of Apple Music and Spotify \nApparently, Apple is cherry-picking some employees and technology to plug into Apple Music, information that was revealed as Omnifone founder Rob Lewis embarks on setting up a new streaming music service, Electric Jukebox. While Apple typically discloses their full acquisitions, the Omnifone investment does not qualify and thus Apple has been mum. \nApple’s investment in Omnifone, which occurred in August, was rumored as early as July when bankruptcy proceedings made note of a potential buyer of parts of the company for $10 million. The rumors, which named Apple specifically, were discredited — seemingly a bit too soon as it turns out. \nThe Omnifone staff that will reportedly be making their way to Apple headquarters include engineers that are now involved with iTunes and app development. Omnifone has more than 50 registered patents across a wide range of streaming technology such as media identification and downloading. While it is unclear which technology was purchased, it is clear that it will make its way into Apple Music and iTunes at some point. \nThe Omnifone investment highlights just how much of Apple’s Music service is a result of acquisitions, as the company also purchased Swell, Lala , MusicMeter and, of course, Beats , the latter of which is an important part of Apple’s music business going forward. Apple is clearly serious about making its streaming music service a success and there is even speculation that it will lower the price of Apple Music plans to make the service more competitive — proving the market is big enough when Apple is willing to spend money to grab a larger share.

      "text": "Comcast's NBCU Takes Bite Out of Apple Ads News Analysis Tweet Oh the irony. Cable operators have struggled for years trying to figure out how to use their own viewership data to better target TV advertising, with progress limited at best. Yet, with NBCUniversal under the Comcast umbrella, one of the most powerful companies in the world is now turning to cable for help with ad sales. \nAccording to multiple news outlets, Apple Inc. (Nasdaq: AAPL) will outsource the advertising sales for its Apple News app to NBCUniversal LLC , starting in 2017. The deal is reportedly exclusive, giving the Comcast Corp. (Nasdaq: CMCSA, CMCSK) subsidiary control over all ad inventory not sold directly by publishers contributing to the app. Publishers, who used to receive only 70% of the revenue from their direct ad sales, will now receive 100%, according to The Wall Street Journal . For ads that NBCU sells, publishers will keep 70% of the income, while the other 30% is divided (split unknown) between NBCU and Apple. \nImportantly, NBCU won't be granted access to Apple user data as part of the deal. Presumably, however, NBCU will bring its own broader consumer data to the table in the ad sales process. \nWant to know more about video and TV market trends? Check out our dedicated video services content channel here on Light Reading. \nThere is no apples-to-apples comparison (pun intended) to be made between the type of ad sales that Comcast manages across its own media properties and the ad sales it will manage for Apple News. The two channels are very different. However, the win for NBCU does reflect a trend throughout Comcast of growing momentum in advertising. On the television front, Comcast has been one of the leaders in pushing dynamic ad insertion (DAI) for video-on-demand content, an initiative that has slowly but surely gained traction. In 2015, the cable-backed ad company Canoe Ventures LLC , which Comcast supports, served more than 11 billion ads into cable VOD services using its DAI platform. (See Canoe Serves Over 11B Viewed Ad Impressions .) \nMore to the point, Comcast Cable is now collaborating closely with NBCU to scale up its advertising business and maximize resources across the entire Comcast corporation. When Comcast acquired NBCU in 2011, it inherited not only new media properties, but also expertise and dedication to the ad business that Comcast alone didn't have. The company also brought in industry veteran Linda Yaccarino in 2011 to head up NBCU ad sales. Yaccarino has since led the way in initiatives like the combining of NBCU's broadcast, cable and digital assets into a single upfront sales process, as well as a strategic offering called Symphony, which unites the assets of NBCU and Comcast Cable for wide-reaching promotional campaigns. \nFrom an Apple perspective, the new deal with NBCU is a sign that the consumer electronics giant recognizes its advertising weakness. From a Comcast and NBCU perspective, however, it's a signal that the cable media giant is serious about the ad business. And while Comcast may not be an advertising king like Facebook or Google (Nasdaq: GOOG), it does have one (ironic) advantage over those companies for a customer like Apple today: Comcast is less of a threat. At least for now. \n— Mari Silbey, Senior Editor, Cable/Video, Light Reading (0) |",

      "text": "Tweet Not the SATs \nEvery business from Wix to Apple to the mom and pop shop next door wants to know what their clients like best. That’s why they run business tests on new products, services or marketing materials; these tests help companies learn what their audience is looking for. \nIf you are creating a new website or updating the site you have, you don’t have to guess which design, image or text will have the best results; business tests offer a way to know for sure. It’s time to learn what business tests are and how they can help you create the most effective online presence possible. Now you can master how tweaking details of your site can increase your conversion rates and snag you more sales. Intrigued? Read on! What are business tests? \nBusiness tests refer to any tests you run among your target market to help you make decisions about your business. The most common type of business test is called an A/B Test. Put simply, it’s when you create a few versions of your website, newsletter or a new product and then distribute each one out to similar segments of your market and see which one converts best. Why run business tests? \nWhether you run a nail salon, a restaurant or a law firm, you want to engage your potential clientele and boost sales. When considering a new logo, homepage image, newsletter or Call to Action , business tests help you figure what your audience likes best. When to use A/B testing in your business? \nYou can run a business test for nearly any element of your site. To be able to accurately evaluate the results, however, make sure that you only change one or two things on each version. Otherwise, you won’t be able to tell what elements affected the results. Try testing out a new color scheme, images, testimonials or your slogan to start. How to run an A/B test? \nIt’s simple! First, create a version of your website (or landing page ) that you love. Then, make a copy of the page. On the second site, change just one element that you want to test. It could be the design of your eCommerce shop, the headline on your homepage or the color of your “Shop Now!” button. \nNext, send out each version of your page to similar groups in your target market. You can distribute the sites using an email newsletter (Have you tried ShoutOut ?) or by running a PPC campaign on Google. Another option is to post both versions on your Facebook page and ask for direct feedback from your fans and friends. Track the engagement levels on each site to see which one generates more clicks, purchases or emails. Then, you’ll find your winner! Other types of business tests? \nWebsites aren’t the only thing you can test. If you write a regular blog, send out eNewsletters or use social media, you can use business tests there as well. Plus, business tests can be used offline too. 1. Testing a newsletter \nSending out an eNewsletter? Split up your contact list and send out slightly different versions to see which one generates more engagement. (Just remember to change only one element of the design or test.) You can run the test on two small groups of contacts and then send out the “winning” version of the newsletter to your entire mailing list. We recommend trying a different image of a different subject line as your first test. 2. Business tests on social media \nIf you post on social media sites like Facebook and Twitter, you can run business tests to try and find the best days and times to hit up your crowd. Start out posting the same content on Monday mornings and Thursday afternoons for a few weeks. Which posts got more engagement? Do weekends work better among your clientele? Does your crowd prefer photographs, cartoons, inspirational quotes or video clips? Try it all! 3. Offline business tests \nBusiness tests aren’t only for your online marketing! You can also go old-school and test out ideas offline. Holding a focus group with members of your target market can get your business valuable feedback. You can consult with your clients to help you improve a new service, design your logo or give you ideas about your new store layout. Just send out a survey or hold a nice Q&A session (stocked with snacks) and you’ll learn a ton. \nReady to run your first A/B test? First, you’ll want to create a website with Wix!",

      "text": "Apple recently acquired both talent and technology from defunct cloud-based music platform Omnifone. According to a TechCrunch report , at least 16 employees from Omnifone began working for Apple starting in August, with most new hires on LinkedIn listed as software engineers and engineering managers working on iTunes and other apps.\nApple confirmed with Billboard that \"some\" former Omnifone employees are now working for the company, but did not go into head count. Apple also did not comment on reports that it purchased tech assets from Omnifone, a subject of speculation since July, when it was reported that the London-based company had found a buyer for some of its parts.\nRead more: Cloud Services Provider Omnifone Selling Tech Business, Assets to Mystery Buyer for $10 Million\nFounded in 2003, Omnifone provided licensing and backend services for a variety of cloud-based digital music services, including Neil Young 's Pono, before entering administration in May 2016 after determining it could not meet its debt liabilities. At the time of administration, Omnifone’s parent company said it had £1,418 in cash at bank, and was owed over £21.6 million in intercompany debts by its subsidiaries.",

      "text": "print Apple CEO Tim Cook AP \nApple has hired at least 16 employees and purchased technology from bankrupt British startup Omnifone, TechCrunch reported on Monday . \nThe obvious use for the ex-Omnifone talent and technology would be to make Apple's streaming music service, Apple Music, more reliable and better. \nOmnifone was founded in 2003 and previously provided cloud tools to companies that wanted to do online music streaming, and even administered online music subscriptions for companies like Sony and BlackBerry. \nThe technology and expertise could help Apple as it tries to catch up in the streaming music business, which is currently dominated by Spotify. Deal or no deal? \nTo be clear, Apple has not confirmed that it purchased Omnifone, which filed for bankruptcy earlier this summer. \nIt's possible that Apple purchased technology and hired Omnifone's staff without purchasing the company's outstanding debts and client obligations. Apple did not respond to a request for comment. \nA report from Omnifone's bankruptcy administrators from earlier this summer had previously suggested that Omnifone had found a buyer for parts of the company for $10 million, TechCrunch reported. \nApple CEO Tim Cook said the company had completed four acquisitions in the quarter from July to September during Apple's most recent earnings call . \nApple usually does not announce its acquisitions, but when news outlets learn about an acquisition Apple usually provides the following statement, which essentially confirms the deal: \" Apple buys smaller technology companies from time to time and we generally do not discuss our purpose or plans.\" \nIn July, an Apple spokesperson pointed out to Business Insider that in the matter of Omnifone the company had not given its standard statement for confirming acquisitions.",

      "text": "Ireland really doesn't want Apple to pay back any taxes The appeals case pits Ireland against the European Commission share Stephen Lam/Getty Images \nMost countries would be excited to be on the receiving end of $14.4 billion in unexpected tax revenues. But Ireland, which has become a European hub for American teach companies thanks to its friendly tax policies, announced today that it will appeal a decision by a European Court that would claw back that huge sum in tax subsidies from the world's wealthiest corporation, Apple. \nThe conflict pits the bureaucracy of the European Union against the sovereign governments of its member states. The European Commission has ruled that a number of nations were offering tax provisions to certain companies that were not accessible to rivals, creating an unfair and thus illegal system. An investigation found that Apple paid between 1 and 0.005 percent in annual taxes on its European profits between 2003 and 2014. \nIreland would prefer to keep these low rates, because that makes it an attractive place for American tech giants to open up shop and employ local citizens. Along with Apple, Google and Facebook have chosen Ireland for their European headquarters. \nApple has separately appealed the European Commissions decision, and the US Treasury even got in the mix , arguing that if the $14.4 billion belonged anywhere, it was back in Apple's home country. \"It reflects an attempt to reach into the U.S. tax base to tax income that ought to be taxed in the United States,\" Lew said in a statement. The final outcome is likely still years away, as the court is already dealing with similar appeals from Luxembourg, the Netherlands, and Belgium. More From The Verge",

This may be a response to complaints about iOS 10, which came with only one new wallpaper when it launched this September.",

      "text": "AP \nIn September, Apple announced the second phase of its mission to \"kill cash.\"\nIt introduced Apple Pay on the web: Basically, if you're shopping in Safari on your Mac, instead of putting in your credit card and address, you can use Apple Pay and your fingerprint to check out quickly. \nIf you've got one of the new MacBook Pros, you can use the built-in fingerprint scanner. Otherwise, your computer will use your iPhone's fingerprint scanner. \nApple Pay checkout buttons have already started popping up around the web.\nBut Apple wants to give its users even more incentive to use it. So it's offering various deals and perks if you use Apple Pay on the web, according to a holiday page it posted on Tuesday. \nOne big deal, for example, is 50% off a one-year subscription to the New York Times. Adidas is offering one or two-day free shipping.

If you’re a public tester in the Apple Beta Software Program, you can grab this update by going into Settings > General > Software Update on your device. \nAs a reminder, the second iOS 10.2 beta includes new features like the TV app for Apple TV and bigger Shuffle and Repeat buttons in the Music app. Also included are new Unicode 9 emoji, such as a fox and an avocado, some new wallpapers, and a Videos app widget. \nApple hasn’t said when iOS 10.2 will be released to the public, but given the company’s history with beta releases, it’s likely that we’ll see another iOS 10.2 beta or two before the full public release.",

      "text": "Apple Launches 'Apple Support' iOS App in Netherlands   11:22 am PST by Juli Clover Apple today released a specialized Apple Support app in the Netherlands, which is designed to give iOS users another way to get support for their Apple devices. The app closely mimics the design of Apple's dedicated support website , providing a list of the products owned by each user along with options for scheduling repairs in an Apple Store or chatting with Apple's support staff. It also has a section for recent repair requests and other information related to Apple product maintenance. Need help? Apple Support app is your personalized guide to the best options from Apple. Find answers with articles tailored to your products and questions. Call, chat or email with an expert right away, or schedule a callback when it's convenient. Get a repair at an Apple Store or a nearby Apple Authorized Service Provider. Apple Support is here to help. Apple Support appears to be limited to the Netherlands at this time, but Apple may be testing it in a single market before opting to roll it out to other countries. Apple Support appears to be limited to the Netherlands at this time, but Apple may be testing it in a single market before opting to roll it out to other countries. Rumors late last year suggested a support app was in the works , but it wasn't clear at the time if it would be a standalone app or something built into an existing app. Apple's support website is already available on all Macs and iOS devices, but a dedicated app may make it easier for users who don't know to visit the support site to get help with their products.",

      "text": "Apple recently acquired both talent and technology from defunct cloud-based music platform Omnifone. According to a TechCrunch report, at least 16 employees from Omnifone began working for Apple starting in August, with most new hires on LinkedIn listed as software engineers and engineering managers working on iTunes and other apps.\nApple confirmed with Billboard that \"some\" former Omnifone employees are now working for the company, but did not go into head count. Apple also did not comment on reports that it purchased tech assets from Omnifone, a subject of speculation since July, when it was reported that the London-based company had found a buyer for some of its parts.\nFounded in 2003, Omnifone provided licensing and backend services for a variety of cloud-based digital music services, including Neil Young's Pono, before entering administration in May 2016 after determining it could not meet its debt liabilities. At the time of administration, Omnifone's parent company said it had £1,418 in cash at bank, and was owed over £21.6 million in intercompany debts by its subsidiaries.",

      "text": "Today's topics include Apple's move to reduce the price of its USB-C adapters for the MacBook Pro after customer complaints, Samsung's report that 85 percent of its recalled Note7 phones have been returned, Oracle's announcement that it can acquire enough NetSuite shares to close it $9.3 billion acquisition of the cloud software company and Microsoft's addition of Access to its SMB 365 plans. \nApple is sharply reducing the prices of its USB-C adapters for its new MacBook Pro laptops after hearing loud complaints from many users about the cost and need for the dongles that will let them use their new machines with legacy peripherals that they already own. \nIn an emailed statement sent to eWEEK on Nov. 7, Apple said it announced the USB-C adapter price cuts that will be good through the end of 2016 to address the concerns of the company's customers. \nUnder the new pricing plan, all Apple-branded USB-C to USB adapters will be $9 instead of $19; while Thunderbolt 3 to Thunderbolt 2 adapters will sell for $29, instead of $49. USB-C to Lightning cables will be $19 instead of $25 for the 1-meter version, while the 2-meter version will be $29 instead of $35. In addition, the Apple USB-C Digital AV Multiport adapter will be $49 instead of $69. \nSome 85 percent of Samsung's troubled Galaxy Note7 smartphones have been returned since a massive recall in September and October due to battery fires and explosions. But the company is still working to encourage owners to return the remaining phones as soon as possible. \nTo hasten Note7 returns, Samsung is releasing a software update that will cut the available charging capacity of the recalled handsets to 60 percent so they will have shorter battery lives, the company announced in a Nov. 4 statement. \n\"As of today, nearly 85 percent of all recalled Galaxy Note7 devices have been replaced through the U.S. Note7 Refund and Exchange Program, with the majority of the participants opting to receive another Samsung smartphone,\" the company said in the statement. \nOracle is finally getting its hands on NetSuite, a provider of cloud enterprise resource planning applications. The move is designed to bolster the growth of Oracle's cloud software-as-as-service business and give it greater access to the important midmarket space. \nOracle officials said in a statement early Nov. 5 that enough shares of NetSuite had been tendered to enable Oracle to move forward with the $9.3 billion acquisition, adding that the deal will close Nov. 7. \nThe announcement of the deal this weekend came as the Nov. 4 stock tender deadline that Oracle had set was passing. \nSoon, smaller companies won't have to pay extra for its Access database management application. Microsoft said it's bundling the Access database with its Office 365 plans for small and midsize businesses. \nNext month, Microsoft will be rolling out Access, which is presently included with Office 365 ProPlus, E3 and E5 plans, to Business and Business Premium subscribers as part of a client software update. The company plans to dole out automatic installations to customers over a two-month period from Dec. 1 through Jan. 30, 2017.",

      "text": "By Michael Firth Neowin LLC @techfirth · 36 minutes ago with 2 comments \nIt's been two months since the Irish cabinet agreed that it would take a stance alongside Apple, and reject the finding that Ireland effectively gave 'state aid' to the California company using heavily reduced tax rates in exchange for local investment and job creation. \nApple itself took a hard stance on the findings, with Tim Cook defending its position in both a press release and follow-up newspaper interviews . Legally speaking, however, the case is ultimately for Ireland to fight, not Apple, as it set the terms of the tax deal and is responsible for collecting the €13bn deficit should the EU ultimately prevail. \nMichael Noonan, the Irish Finance Minister, made a statement today at the European Parliament committee in Brussels; \n\"The government fundamentally disagrees with the European Commission's analysis and the decision left no choice but to take an appeal to the European Courts and this will be submitted tomorrow\" \nIreland has attracted a number of multinational employers with its tax regime, and has the backing of Washington, who sees the European Commission's findings as an attempt to 'tax-grab' revenue that should ultimately be destined for the United States.",

      "text": "Apple's engineering in new MacBook Pro paves way for speedy Optane storage in future models   11:36 am PT (02:36 pm ET) Apple has set the table for inclusion of the future XPoint-based Optane SSD technology in an iteration of the MacBook Pro, potentially leading to dramatically faster access times and transfer speeds than conventional SSDs. In the new MacBook Pros, Apple has implemented NVMe storage, across the PCIe bus. In part, this is why the Apple SSD storage in the new machines is best-in-class, with the 13-inch MacBook Pro with Function Keys are pulling down 2.2 gigabytes per second write speeds, and 3.1 gigabytes per second read speed. Most of the rest of the industry relies on SATA-III SSD interfaces, limited to speeds around 575 megabytes per second, and is exceeded by the earlier 2015 MacBook Pro. Wider adoption of PCIe/NVMe storage for the mass market isn't expected until mid- to late-2017. Conventional SSD media is about 100 times slower than the RAM used in the MacBook Pro, with Apple's new drives about 65 times slower. Optane storage media will be only about 8 times slower than LPDDR3 RAM. \"Apple has been a pioneer when it comes to PCIe/NVMe storage. They were the first PC company to broadly adopt it across its laptop portfolio while other companies today are still just using it in a very limited portion of their PC lineup,\" IDC research vice president Jeff Janukowicz told Computerworld . \"By doing so, Apple has been able to deliver higher performance in terms of read/write speed and latency when compared to traditional SATA-based PC designs —thus, making the new MacBook pro more responsive and faster.\" NVMe, Apple's SSD controller, and 3D XPoint NVMe is meant to replace the older AHCI technology, which was implemented to keep systems using spinning hard drives at maximum efficiency. The newer NVMe is optimized for low-latency operations made possible by solid state media. Even in its infancy, NVMe reduces latency by 50 percent over a drive managed by AHCI. The newer NVMe has 2.8 nanosecond latency at present, with room for future boosts, versus AHCI's absolute peak with a SSD at 6 nanoseconds. For comparison, AHCI's latency in a magnetic hard drive is measured in milliseconds, limited by the drive itself, and not the underlying technology, and around 10,000 times slower than LPDDR3. Furthermore, conventional SSD media is about 100 times slower than the RAM used in the MacBook Pro, with Apple's new drives in the MacBook Pro about 65 times slower overall. Optane storage media will be only about 8 times slower than LPDDR3 RAM. The speed of the SSD in the new MacBook Pro is from more than just NVMe support. Apple's 338S00199 SSD controller is the key to the operation, allowing for throughput on a portable SSD never before seen. The next generation of flash media storage, called 3D XPoint, and branded as Optane by Intel, is compatible with the NVMe storage protocol that Apple already uses in some of its MacBooks, including the MacBook Pro. The new technology could be used in a new MacBook Pro in 2017, controlled by either the current Apple SSD custom controller, or a future version of same as the underlying technologies are compatible now. Intel's forthcoming \"Mansion Beach\" SSD line based on Optane is intended to be installed on a system's motherboard, or with a connector similar to what Apple has utilized on the new MacBook Pro, and should debut very shortly. Refreshes of the as-yet unreleased technology, and variants for data centers, are expected in mid-2017, just in time for Apple to include in a 2017 MacBook Pro. Topics:",

      "text": "Apple's Refurbished Store Offers iPhones for the First Time Tuesday November 8, 2016 11:40 am PST by Juli Clover Apple recently updated its online refurbished store to include a range of different iPhone models, giving customers a way to purchase a certified refurbished device at a lower cost directly from Apple. Apple is currently offering refurbished iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus models in a variety of colors and capacities. Prices for an entry-level 16GB iPhone 6s start at $449, while a 16GB iPhone 6s Plus can be purchased for $529. Those prices are $100 to $120 less than brand new iPhone 6s and 6s Plus devices, which are priced at $549 and $649 for 32GB of storage space. All refurbished iPhone 6s and 6s Plus models are unlocked and SIM-free, meaning they are compatible with all U.S. carriers. While Apple has long offered iPads and Macs in its refurbished store, it has never before allowed customers to purchase refurbished iPhones. Customers who wanted lower prices on iPhones had to wait for third-party deals or purchase refurbished/used devices from a third-party retailer. All of Apple's refurbished products , iPhone included, are tested, certified, cleaned, and guaranteed with a one-year warranty. iPhones also feature a brand new battery and a fresh outer shell, ensuring there are no scratches or other cosmetic damage.",

The new app will show the Apple products that are owned (registered) by the person, and they can set up repair times at a local Apple retail store if they need it. The option to chat with Apple’s support staff is also available. \n“Need help? Apple Support app is your personalized guide to the best options from Apple. Find answers with articles tailored to your products and questions. Call, chat or email with an expert right away, or schedule a callback when it’s convenient. Get a repair at an Apple Store or a nearby Apple Authorized Service Provider. Apple Support is here to help.” \nThe dedicated app is only available in the Netherlands for now, but, as MacRumors points out, Apple could just be testing it in a single region before rolling out the app to other areas.",

      "text": "By Rich Woods Neowin LLC @@TheRichWoods · 4 seconds ago \nYesterday, Apple seeded its second Developer Beta builds of iOS 10.2, tvOS 10.1, and watchOS 3.1.1 . macOS 10.12.2 Sierra was notably missing from the mix, until today. \nmacOS 10.12.2 beta 2 comes in with the build number 16C41b. The big new feature is that it supports Unicode 9 emoji, which means that you can finally send bacon and avocados to your friends. \niOS 10.2 Public Beta 2 was also released today to testers. The new build contains the TV app that Apple announced at its MacBook Pro launch event . It also features the ability to call emergency services by pressing the power button five times. \nThe original iOS 10.2 beta came with a few new features as well. These included support for Unicode 9 emoji, new wallpapers, a Videos widget, fixes for Health data, new Camera settings, and some new tweaks in Music. \nIf you're already on the macOS Developer Beta, you can grab the new build by opening the Mac App Store and going to the Updates tab. For iOS 10.2 Public Beta 2, you can head over to Settings -> General -> Software Update. Tags",

      "text": "Apple \nApple's online refurbished store is an open secret that allows people to buy like-new Apple products at a significant discount.\nNow, Apple is selling refurbished iPhones for the first time. Apple is offering a variety of refurbished iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus models for about $100 less than full-price, or about 15% off. \nFor example, Apple is selling a 16GB iPhone 6S for $449 — $200 less than its original price in 2015, and $100 less than a new one costs today. You have some choice in color but some color and storage combinations are not available.\nBasically, when a product is returned to Apple, it fixes the problem, replaces the battery, then puts the guts and other components into a new casing and sells it. Refurbishing returned devices helps prevent waste and helps boost Apple's bottom line when it doesn't have to eat the cost of returns. For example, when Apple swaps out your broken phone at the Apple Store, its usually giving you a refurbished replacement. In most circumstances, refurbs are just like new, except that they come in brown paper boxes. \nRefurbished iPhones from Apple come with a 12-month warranty, just like a new phone. Apple writes:\nWe test and certify all Apple refurbished products and include a 1-year warranty.  All refurbished iPhone models also include a brand new battery and outer shell.  Supply is limited and availability is guaranteed once we receive your full payment. \nHowever, Geniuses working at Apple Stores have told Business Insider that some refurbished iPhones could have the issue called \" touch disease \" which could make your iPhone screen unresponsive to touch. \nNOW WATCH: Elon Musk just unveiled something that could revolutionize how you power your home \n",

      "text": "Ireland to formally submit appeal on Apple case this week 11/08/2016 11:07 \nDUBLIN (Reuters) - Ireland's government will this week formally submit its appeal against the European Commission's multi-billion-euro demand for back taxes from Apple, Finance Minister Michael Noonan said on Tuesday. \nIreland's cabinet agreed in September to join the iPhone maker in appealing the Commission's order that the U.S. tech giant pay up to 13 billion euros to Dublin after ruling the firm had received illegal state aid. \nDublin is seeking to protect a tax regime that has attracted many multinational employers. The European Commission decision has also angered Washington, which accuses it of trying to grab tax revenue that should go to the United States. \n\"The government fundamentally disagrees with the European Commission's analysis and the decision left no choice but to take an appeal to the European Courts and this will be submitted tomorrow,\" Noonan told a European Parliament committee in Brussels. \n(Reporting by Padraic Halpin; editing by Andrew Roche) 11/08/2016 11:07 © Copyright Reuters Ltd.

      "text": "Reddit \nUp until now, Apple has never sold refurbished iPhones on its online store. You could get a refurbished Mac, iPad, or even a niche device like an AirPort Extreme, but never an iPhone. That has seemingly changed today, as Apple is offering t he iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus in its refurb store . \nApple has sort of sold refurbished iPhones before, but those sales were relegated to an eBay store front and never fully confirmed. This is the first time that the company has offered iPhones on its official refurb store online. \nCustomers will find the iPhone 6s in 16 GB storage varieties for $449.00. The larger iPhone 6s Plus is being offered in two storage varieties: 16Gb and 64GB for $529 and $589, respectively. It seems that all colors are currently available, which includes Silver, Space Gray, Gold, and Rose Gold. \nIn the end, users can expect to save up to 15% ($110) by going the refurbished route, and remember that these devices come with a full 1-year factory warranty, which makes refurb units a great idea for budget-conscious shoppers. \nIt’s also worth noting that all refurbished iPhones are unlocked and come SIM-free, plus they all include a brand new battery and outer shell. It’s as close to a new iPhone as you’ll get without actually buying one brand new. Keep in mind that supplies of refurbished Apple product tend to fluctuate, so you’ll want to act fast if you see an item you want. \nThe timing suggests that these refurb models may be coming from Apple’s iPhone Upgrade Program which launched just over a year ago and saw initial returns after the iPhone 7 release.

      "text": "Apple appears to be rolling out a new iOS app called Support that works on iPhone and iPad. Support for iOS includes helpful links to support articles as well as access to AppleCare services. \nHere’s how Apple describes the new app: \nNeed help? Apple Support app is your personalized guide to the best options from Apple. Find answers with articles tailored to your products and questions. Call, chat or email with an expert right away, or schedule a callback when it’s convenient. Get a repair at an Apple Store or a nearby Apple Authorized Service Provider. Apple Support is here to help. \nApple previously included some of the features found in the new Support app in its existing Apple Store app , but recently removed the ability to schedule Genius Bar appointments as it removes the emphasis on the Genius Bar in its stores. \nThe new app uses the ability to tell which products are registered with your Apple ID so you can find support for the right hardware too. Apple also launched a dedicated Twitter account for fielding technical questions over the social network earlier this year. \nThe new app will likely hit the US App Store soon. Guides",

Apple has not publicly listed the new features in iOS 10.2, but a handful are present in the test build of the operating system. For example, iOS 10.2 includes Unicode 9 and a fresh batch of emoji, as well as new wallpapers, iMessage screen effects, camera settings, video widgets, and emergency contact alerts. iOS 10.2 Beta 2 is free for to download from Apple's developer console, or via the public beta program. Apple hasn't said when it might release iOS 10.2 to all users. Apple also made new betas of watchOS 3.1.1, tvOS 10.1, and macOS Sierra 10.12.2 available to developers.",

Slice Intelligence \nApple's MacBook Pro , the company's newest model for power users, is generating vastly more revenue than the company's ultralight laptop that debuted a year and a half ago, a e-commerce tracking firm says. \nThe MacBook Pro revenue in its first five days has reached 78 percent of last year's MacBook , Slice Intelligence said Tuesday . In addition, the new Mac has generated nearly four times that of Microsoft's Surface Book challenger since its debut a year ago. \nThat may sound like great news for Apple , but there likely was pent-up demand for the new MacBook Pro since it's gone years without a major redesign. \nAnd shoppers showed a willingness to switch to Windows-powered machines during the long wait, Slice found. Apple Among those who bought an Apple laptop in 2014, 40 percent bought another brand since, Slice said. The firm bases its statistics on the behavior of a panel of 4.4 million online shoppers. It tracks online sales only. \nThe new MacBook Pro is smaller and lighter, with a starting price of $1,499. Higher-end models feature a touch-screen strip called the Touch Bar instead of function keys at the top of the keyboard. Critics don't like its lack of old-style but still widely used rectangular USB ports. \nApple didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.",

      "text": "8 reasons an Apple announcement that will blow your mind is coming soon (hint: AR) Published in Lists Share: Hey, I’m Chris. I wrote this article and I’m also the founder and Editor of DailyTekk. Lets connect on Twitter , Instagram , Snapchat and YouTube . Check back daily! \nWhat do the iPhone 8, the iPhone 10 and the iPhone 20 all have in common? They’re all 95% boring and 5% exciting. Well maybe that’s over-exaggerating (maybe) but there’s no denying that Apple fans are getting the feeling that Apple has settled into (or might even have embraced) a new era of boring . \nKeynote after formulaic keynote, event after predictable event and Apple announcement after anticipated Apple announcement tech enthusiasts and Apple fans are left wanting “one more thing” as Steve Jobs used to say — something unexpected and exciting. \nRecent feelings of disappointment have already led several people to speculate that Apple is the new Microsoft . But Apple’s actually up to something big — something that has the potential to blow our minds once more: augmented reality. \nAugmented reality — AR for short — is the overlaying of digital information on top of the physical world. It’s also almost certainly going to be Apple’s next big thing (and that’s a very good thing). Imagine Apple glasses (or better yet Apple contact lenses) that could display directions or overlay information about objects you are looking at without the need to look at a phone. Imagine an Apple-developed HUD (heads-up display) in your next new car. Imagine an AR makeover of the Apple TV or the Apple Watch. Even better, though, might be the fact that two people can share a common experience thanks to AR. The possibilities surrounding augmented reality and Apple are seriously exciting. \nEspecially because it’s a matter of when and not if . According to analysts Apple is set to debut AR technology sometime soon (like in the next year or two). And I suspect the event is going to be a very big deal. \nWhereas people are used to their iDevices, an augmented reality device will leave the faithful swooning once more (in my humble opinion). My guess is that after Apple’s AR keynote people will forget they ever had any doubts about Apple’s continued ability to innovate. \nSo if your faith in Apple’s awesomeness is wavering then here are eight reasons to hope that an upcoming Apple event is going to leave us with something truly special and a bit magical. Why eight? Because I think Apple releasing an AR product will be far more exciting than the iPhone 8. 1 – Apple CEO Tim Cook can’t stop talking about AR \nTim ...",

      "text": "Apple starts selling refurb iPhones through its online store You can score a discount on phones that would otherwise be out of your reach. Save Reuters/Robert Galbraith \nIf you've ever wanted to buy an iPhone straight from Apple but thought that brand new unlocked models were out of your reach, you're in luck. Apple has started selling refurbished iPhones in its US online store, with hefty discounts depending on what you want to buy. An unlocked 16GB iPhone 6s is selling for $449, or $80 off the usual price; splurge on a 64GB iPhone 6s Plus and you'll shell out $589, or $110 less than usual. The iPhone SE and iPhone 7 are absent, but that's not surprising given that owners have only had them for several months at best. \nThis won't be as big a bargain as you'd get by purchasing an iPhone through a used goods site, an auction or a friend. However, you'll get both a year-long warranty and the knowledge that there won't be any rude surprises when you open the box. In short: if the thought of shopping on eBay or Swappa makes you nervous, this is your best bet.",

      "text": "Apple iPhone sales to continue decline, new SE model expected in 2017 Anirban Ghoshal, Hindustan Times, New Delhi | Updated: Nov 07, 2016 19:35 IST Kuo didn’t also clarify whether the iPhone SE will see an update of the SE. The iPhone SE, which was targeted at emerging markets, didn’t do well in the target markets but also helped sales in US and Middle East countries. (YouTube) \nApple chief executive Tim Cook during the launch of the MacBook Pro said that the company’s flagship smartphone series iPhone 7 was doing really well and has been seeing an unprecedented demand globally just after its launch in September. \nBut if KGI Securities’ Ming-Chi Kuo, considered the best Apple analyst, is to be believed then Apple will decline in sales in the first and the second quarter of 2017 unlike its performance in the same quarters of 2016. Kuo says that the second quarter decline will come if Apple chooses not to refresh its 4-inch iPhone SE next year. \nHe further explains that the decision might be a result of Apple trying to focus all its efforts on the iPhone 8, the 10th-anniversary edition of iPhone, which the world expects to be an engine of innovation. \nRead more: Apple’s 10th anniversary iPhone 8 to come with OLED displays \n“Shipment volume in 2Q16 came in higher than expected thanks to upbeat demand for the iPhone SE. However, in order to keep gross margin at a high level and to avoid cannibalisation of high-end models, we do not expect Apple to launch an upgraded iPhone SE in 2Q17. Without contribution from a new model, we forecast total iPhone shipment volume will reach 35-40mn units and fall YoY in 2Q17, lower than the 40.4mn units in 2Q16,” Kuo is quoted as saying in a note to investors. \nHowever, Kuo didn’t also clarify whether the iPhone SE will see an update of the SE. The iPhone SE, which was targeted at emerging markets, didn’t do well in the target markets but also helped sales in US and Middle East countries. \nRead more: Apple to launch Watch 2 in next six months: Report \nHe also said that declining sales may force Apple to exert pressure on its suppliers to reduce costs starting this month and the decision might be forced upon due to the company’s efforts to keep gross margin high on its latest iPhones. \nHowever, the analyst also said that though Apple will see decline in sales in the first two quarters, the iPhone 8 launch is likely to make up for the losses. \nRead more: Forget iPhone 7, Apple is planning an ‘all glass’ iPhone 8 \nAccording to Kuo, Apple is expected to redesign the iphone 8 with an all-glass enclosure instead of the ranges’ famed aluminium chassis which will also be complemented by new cutting edge curved OLED display. The phone is expected to come in three variants and sport an optic fingerprint recognition technology. Tags ",

      "text": "| The Back Page \nApple isn’t planning to update iPhone SE, according to well-connected KGI Securities’ analyst Ming-Chi Kuo. In a research note, Mr. Ming-Chi said the device, which was originally launched in March of 2016, won’t be updated in 2017, as Apple looks ahead to September’s iPhone 8. \nMing-Chi Kuo is plugged into Apple’s supply chain fairly well, and his prognostications have a solid reputation. It would be a curious choice to me if Apple didn’t update iPhone SE. iPhone SE \nThe iPhone SE is a 4-inch smartphone in an industry dominated by larger screens. When Apple originally introduced this device, the argument was that Apple was looking for a less expensive entry-level device, and that it wanted to satisfy demand from the subset of the market that prefers smaller screens. \nOK, great. That logic still stands up, so what’s changed? All evidence says that iPhone SE helped goose sales in the first half of calendar 2016. To that end, Mr. Ming-Chi said that Apple would most likely see a further decline in year-over-year sales in 2017 due, in part, to the lack of a new SE model. \nFrom a research note, as published by 9to5Mac . \nShipment volume in 2Q16 came in higher than expected thanks to upbeat demand for the iPhone SE. However, in order to keep gross margin at a high level and to avoid cannibalization of high-end models, we do not expect Apple to launch an upgraded iPhone SE in 2Q17. Without contribution from a new model, we forecast total iPhone shipment volume will reach 35-40mn units and fall YoY in 2Q17, lower than the 40.4mn units in 2Q16. Why Change Now? \nAgain, arguing from the standpoint that Ming-Chi Kuo is likely right, it’s hard to fathom why Apple wouldn’t update a device when not updating that device is going to lead to lower sales. Heretofore, Apple’s modus operandi has been to make the devices that satisfy customer needs without worrying about cannibalization. \nWhy change that now? \nThere are still people who prefer the smaller iPhone; and, having a current-generation iPhone with a lower price tag helps Apple reach deeper into the market. So why nuke it? \nChaffin’s Razor says there’s missing information. For instance, Ming-Chi Kuo could be wrong. Or, Apple has seen sales for iPhone SE diminish in such a way that it’s clear there is little real demand for a 4-inch form screen. Or, Apple is planning something to replace iPhone SE that will take us by surprise*. \nAverage Selling Price \nUnfortunately this move may be nothing more than a concern over average selling price (ASP), as noted by Ming-Chi Kuo. Apple CEO Tim Cook noted that he was interested in raising iPhone ASPs during the most recent quarterly conference call with analysts. Ditching the less expensive iPhone model would do that. \nI hope that’s not the case, though, because it sure seems like a bean-counter move in the face of their being demand for this product. Steve Jobs was always leery of putting bean counters or marketing people in charge of a product company. While that’s another discussion for another time, few (if any) moves from Tim Cook have felt like bear counter moves. \nUntil this one. Maybe. \n*Just kidding. There are no iPhone surprises any more.

      "text": "– A + Ireland to submit appeal of EU's $14.5B Apple tax ruling on Wednesday By Roger Fingas \n  01:12 pm PT (04:12 pm ET) \nThe Irish government is about to formally submit its appeal of the European Commission's tax ruling on Apple, Finance Minister Michael Noonan announced on Tuesday.\n\n\n\n\n\"The government fundamentally disagrees with the European Commission's analysis and the decision left no choice but to take an appeal to the European Courts and this will be submitted tomorrow,\" Reuters quoted Noonan as telling a European Parliament committee in Brussels.\n\nConcluding a lengthy investigation, the European Commission recently ordered Ireland to collect $14.5 billion in back taxes from Apple. The country was accused of offering preferential tax deals, something constituting illegal state aid under European law. Apple has taken advantage of its Irish tax situation to funnel billions in international revenue, avoiding what it might normally owe in host countries.\n\nWhile Ireland could theoretically benefit from the extra tax revenue, the country is thought to be worried about scaring away other multinational corporations, both for their tax contributions and the jobs they might provide to the economy. \n\nApple is also appealing the ruling, and has regularly defended itself by claiming it follows the law and pays everything it owes.\n\nThe European Commission has made similar findings against Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg for their tax deals with companies like Starbucks and Fiat Chrysler. Those parties are also appealing, but they —along with Apple and Ireland —may have to wait several years for a resolution.",

      "text": "– A + Apple launches first-ever online sales of refurbished iPhones By Roger Fingas \n  12:37 pm PT (03:37 pm ET) \nFor the first time, Apple has begun selling refurbished iPhones from its U.S. online store, giving people a cheaper way of getting into the iPhone ecosystem while still having official warranty support.\n\n\n\n\nAt the moment, the company is only selling a few models of the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus . A 16-gigabyte 6s is $449, while an equivalent 6s Plus is $529. A 64-gigabyte 6s Plus is going for $589.\n\nAll of the refurbished units are unlocked and SIM-free, with new batteries, outer shells, and one-year warranties. Apple normally sells the 6s and 6s Plus for prices starting at $549 and $649, respectively.\n\nWhile it may be possible to find cheaper prices from third-party vendors , buyers do run the risk of getting a device with hidden defects, which could lead to expensive repair or replacement costs.\n\nApple has traditionally resisted selling refurbished iPhones, presumably because the product is its main source of revenue and cheaper used models would undercut the incentive to buy new hardware. \n\nIt's not clear what might have changed, but sales of the iPhone 6s line were underwhelming compared with the iPhone 6. The company may be opening refurbs to clear out old inventory faster, simultaneously offering better competition against Android phones.",

This makes for cheaper means of getting an iPhone and on-board the iOS ecosystem of apps and services while still retaining warranty support.Apple currently sells iPhone 6s and 6s Plus models, starting at $449 for the 16GB iPhone 6s and $529 for the 16GB 6s Plus. These are about $100 discounts from the non-refurbished models. The units are unlocked and SIM-free, with one year warranties. They batteries and outer shells have been completely replaced.With the introduction of refurbished smartphones, Apple should be able to clear out its inventory of older iPhones more easily while offering a more price-competitive alternative to Android smartphones of similar class.

      "text": "11/08/16 AT 4:08 PM Close \nApple’s highly anticipated new California campus, which has aptly been dubbed “the spaceship,” is almost finished. \nThe 280,000-square-foot campus is now its final stages of development, and the site is rumored to open by mid-2017, Market Watch reported Tuesday. The news followed the release of recent drone footage that surveyed the progress of the massive campus site and compared new footage to video from a year ago. \nThe new facilities have been a long time coming. The plans for the new campus were first announced by cofounder and chief executive officer Steve Jobs in 2011 during his last public appearance before dying of pancreatic cancer. Jobs had hoped to have Apple move into the new facility by the end of 2015, according to Bloomberg. \n“We have a shot,” Jobs said, “at building the best office building in the world. I really do think that architecture students will come here to see it.” \nThe Cupertino-based site features a new facility for Apple Inc., a development that has been said to cost close to $5 billion, according to Bloomberg. Related Stories Tim Cook to Announce iPhone 5 at Apple Campus on Oct 4? \nThe project was spearheaded by Foster + Partners , an innovative architecture and design company that was behind 50 United Nations Plaza in New York City and the Apple Store in In Istanbul’s Zorlu Centre. \nAccording to the original plans for the project, which were published in October 2014, the whole site was to be 16 acres and feature four buildings: an office building with a cafeteria complete with underground parking, two development and research buildings, a data center complete with equipment and outdoor dining and a parking space area. The initial plans for the building also specified that the site would “redeveloped with sustainable, state-of-the-art office, research and development facilities.\" \nIndeed, the circular four-story structure will come with solar panels totaling 700,000 square feet that will help to generate the campuses’ energy, Fortune reported in June. \nThe new Apple Inc. campus facility will be able to accommodate around 12,000 employees, according to Fortune. Other campus features will also include a large auditorium — perhaps to host future Apple Inc. events? — and a 100,000-square-foot fitness center.  ",

      "text": "Learn More \nThe 11-inch MacBook Air lost its status as Apple’s most coveted laptop some time ago, but for cash-strapped Mac fans, the svelte ultraportable was their go-to system thanks to its $899 price tag. Unfortunately, last month Apple announced it’s giving its 11-inch ultraportable the ax. Moreover, by not upgrading the 13-inch MacBook Air ($999), it’s sentencing all of its sub $1,000 laptops to a slow death. \nThat means that in the near future Apple could make the 12-inch MacBook ($1,299) and the 13-inch MacBook Pro ($1,499) the company’s new entry-level machines, sans entry level prices. \nFortunately, the Apple Store offers refurbished MacBook Air , MacBook , and MacBook Pro laptops with prices starting at $929. \nIf the idea of a refurbished laptop makes you hesitate, rest assured that Apple’s refurbs are among the best in the industry and they’re all backed by the same 1-year warranty found in Apple’s newer devices. Below we’ve rounded up a few refurb Apple laptops currently available. \nMacBook laptops on sale from $170 to $210 off: 11.6-inch MacBook Air for $929 ($170 off): There’s no Retina display and its 11-inch screen may be too small for some users, but at $929 — the 11-inch MacBook Air is the cheapest way to set foot inside the Mac laptop ecosystem. This laptop’s classic design has spawned countless imitators — including Apple’s own 12-inch MacBook — and its just 0.3 pounds heavier than the 2-pound 12-inch MacBook. This model has been upgraded to include 256GB of storage space. 12-inch MacBook for $1,182 ($210 off): The 12-inch MacBook is Apple’s most forward-thinking device to date. It defines the bleeding edge in PC portability and just like the original MacBook Air inspired dozens of competitors, so will the 12-inch MacBook. At its full price, however, it offers too little for too much money. As a refurb, it presents a more compelling argument, just keep in mind it doesn’t offer the best battery (that would be the 13-inch MacBook Air) nor does it offer the most horsepower, if CPU muscle is what you require. 13.3-inch MacBook Pro Retina for $1,099 ($200 off): This laptop costs $100 more than the entry-level 13-inch MacBook Air, yet it includes an eye-opening 2,560 x 1,600 pixel Retina Display. This 2015 model may be outdated — when compared to the just-released 13.3-inch MacBook Pro — but in terms of power it leaves the older 13-inch MacBook Air and 12-inch MacBook in the dust.",

      "text": "Apple begins selling refurbished iPhones in online Apple Store By Jesse Hollington @jhollington ● 34 minutes ago \nApple’s online store has begun selling refurbished iPhone 6s models , allowing customers to save money on last year’s iPhone models by purchasing certified refurbished versions. A variety of colors and capacities are available, with prices starting at $449 for a 16GB iPhone 6s — about $100 less expensive than a brand new entry-level iPhone 6s, although it’s worth keeping in mind that Apple has doubled storage capacities on this year’s iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus models, making the refurbished iPhones arguably less of a deal — a brand new 32GB iPhone 6s sells for $549. All refurbished iPhone models currently being sold appear to be unlocked and SIM-free, meaning they can be used on any carrier.",

      "text": "ZDNet Japan You can now purchase a refurbished iPhone 6S directly from Apple The company has updated its online refurbished store to include its most successful product, the iPhone, for the first time. | Topic: Apple \nIf you've recently broken your iPhone and don't have insurance or AppleCare, you can save yourself some money and purchase a refurbished iPhone directly from Apple . \nAs MacRumors reported , Apple recently added iPhones to its refurbished storefront for the first time. In the past, Apple has used the same website to sell refurbished Macs, iPads, iPods, Apple TVs, and accessories. \nThe listings are currently limited to 16 GB or 64 GB iPhone 6S models, all of which are unlocked and will work on nearly any wireless carrier. review Read More \nWhen purchasing a refurbished device instead of brand new, your overall savings depend on the model and storage. \nApple no longer sells a 16 GB or 64 GB model of either size iPhone 6S, making it tough to do direct price comparisons. However, you most certainly will save money by going the refurbished route if a 64 GB phone will work for you. \nFor example, you can buy a refurbished iPhone 6S Plus with 64 GB of storage for $589, or a brand new iPhone 6S Plus with 32 GB of storage for $649. \nOne of the biggest advantages of buying a refurbished phone from Apple is the fact the company thoroughly tests each device, and guarantees it with a full one-year warranty from the date you purchase it. Apple also replaces all outer shells and batteries on refurbished devices, to make the device feel and function as a brand new phone would. \nPurchasing a refurbished device from Apple may still be more expensive than buying a used phone off Craigslist or eBay, but at least you have the peace of mind in knowing it has been checked, repaired and certified by Apple.

      "text": "  \nEver since Dallas-based AT&T announced earlier this year it would offer a streaming service called DirecTV Now, customers have been clamoring for details. \nLast month, we found out that the service would cost $35 a month and include more than 100 channels . This week, a report in the Hollywood trade magazine Variety revealed more details about AT&T's plans based on leaked documents. \nAnd sadly, it looks like the $35 a month is a base price. Apparently, you'll have to upgrade to get premium channels like HBO. \nVariety quoted the marketing documents as saying: \n\"With DIRECTV NOWÂŽ, you can stream live TV and On Demand programming with several packages to choose from. Premium channels like HBO and Cinemax can be added at any time.\" Will AT&T-Time Warner merger hurt or help consumers? \nAccording to the Variety report, AT&T plans an aggressive marketing campaign for DirecTV Now, set to launch later this month. It will offer customers who sign up for three months of the service a free Apple TV. Customers who pay for one month of service will be eligible for an Amazon Fire TV streaming stick. \nThe device promotion is interesting. Since announcing its planned merger with Time Warner on Oct. 26, AT&T has made it clear it wants to be a major player in what is known as \"TV Everywhere.\" \nAnd so far, the company has gobbled up companies that give it entree into major segments of the online TV streaming business. The acquisition of DirecTV in 2015 made it the largest TV provider in the country. The Time Warner deal would give it access to a trove of original content from channels such as HBO and CNN in addition to Warner Bros.' extensive catalogue of TV and movies. \nBut one area where it does not compete is in multimedia streaming devices like Apple TV, Fire TV or Playstation Vue. DirecTV Now could be a platform that introduces more consumers to those devices. \nVariety said AT&T would not comment on the documents. They did not reveal any more about the channel lineup for DirecTV Now. But some have already been suggested with networks like Disney, Turner and HBO revealing they have signed on to provide content to DirecTV Now. \nThe Variety report also said AT&T plans to offer a free 7-day trial to customers. If you choose not to sign on after the trial, you'll be able to access \"FreeView,\" an ad-supported tier that has limited content. View Comments",

      "text": "  Posted Google to shut down Map Maker, its crowdsourced map editing tool \nSome good news for folks looking to shave a hundred bucks or so off an iPhone, while still getting all of the benefits that going through Apple’s official channels entail. The company is now stocking refurbished iPhones through its online store – which was previously limited to iPads, Macs, Apple TVs and the like. \nAs one expects from Apple’s official offering, the prices aren’t as low as other second-hand retailers out there. Typical savings on a device is around the $80 to $110 mark. Also not surprising – the company has yet to stock the latest and greatest in the store – neither the SE or iPhone 7 are currently represented. \nAt present, the selection is limited to the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus, with prices ranging from $449 for the 16GB 6s to $589 for the 64GB Plus, both savings of 15-percent off the full retail price. The price includes a one-year warranty from Apple and, one expect, a little peace of mind.",

Apple mixed reality ambitions could result in... a revolutionary TV? \n  \nApple is working on a new television set that will incorporate ‘mixed reality technology’ according to noted tech evangelist Robert Scoble. \nSpeaking at the Web Summit in Lisbon (via Wareable ), Scoble said the new TV set has been in the works since the time of Steve Jobs and will be revealed within a year. \nHe said Apple has a whopping 600 engineers on the project, with the whole deal based around the tech from the PrimeSense start-up it bought way back in 2013. \nHe said: “ Tim Cook and Steve Jobs, I believe, sat down and talked about the future of TV and in 11 months they are going to show you the future of TV – because they are building the PrimeSense sensor right into the television, into the iPad and into the iPhone… so you can do this kind of mixed reality. \n\"Apple has 600 engineers working on it. There was a patent released this morning – they've been working on mixed reality, or augmented reality, for five years… minimum.” \nYou may remember PrimeSense as the company that helped Microsoft create the criminally-undervalued Kinect Sensor. \nScobel claimed whatever Apple unveils by October next year will “blow even his mind.” \nThe patent he refers to involves an AR mapping system for iPhone, which will offer real time augmented views of a real-life environment. \nWhere this would all tie in with a television set Apple is thought to have abandoned long ago remains to be seen. \nDoes this all seem a little far-fetched to you too?

      "text": "Post 3Q16 Outlook for Mobile Device Stocks PART 3 OF 3 Apple Makes a Move to Get the Most out of Apple News App By Rachel Gunter | Nov 8, 2016 2:39 pm EST Shrinking iPhone sales probably won’t destroy Apple \nDoes Apple ( AAPL ) have a life outside the iPhone? This question has become important in recent quarters as Apple struggles with shrinking iPhone sales amid stiff competition and market saturation. \nFor the September quarter, or 4Q16, Apple reported a fall of 9.0% in revenue to $46.9 billion. The quarter was dragged down by weak iPhone sales. The company sold 2.5 million fewer units of the device compared to 4Q15. With iPhone sales accounting for more than 63.0% of Apple’s quarterly top line, pressure in the smartphone market worries Apple investors. \nBut apparently, Apple hasn’t run out of options to grow its revenue and break its overreliance on iPhone sales. In a move that could give a footing to the company’s mobile news app (application), Apple recently inked a deal with Comcast’s ( CMCSA ) NBCUniversal to sell its ads on Apple News. Allowing experts to manage Apple News \nThe graph above shows Apple’s quarterly revenue trend. Tapping NBCUniversal seems to indicate that Apple is handing over the business of selling ads on its news app to an expert. NBCUniversal’s network and expertise in selling ads could attract more advertisers to Apple News, thus generating more revenue for Apple. \nAd publishers will keep 70.0% of the revenue generated from ads alongside their content on the mobile news app. Apple and NBCUniversal will split the remaining 30.0%. \nAlthough Apple News is still a small business, it seems to have a bright future. Apple launched its mobile news app in 2015, and so far, it has attracted more than 70 million monthly active users and more than 4,000 publishers. New competition \nIn the mobile news business, Apple is competing for market share with Facebook ( FB ), Alphabet’s ( GOOGL ) Google, and traditional news organizations such as the New York Times ( NYT ). \nOther than Apple News, Apple’s other efforts to diversify revenue streams include Apple Watch and Apple Music . {\"metrics\":[\"Open\"],\"tickers\":[\"AAPL\",\"CMCSA\",\"FB\",\"GOOGL\",\"NYT\"],\"ticker_names\":[\"Apple Inc.\",\"Comcast Corporation\",\"Facebook Inc\",null,\"The New York Times Company\"]} X",

      "text": "Reaction to Apple's fresh MacBook line has been mixed. While the shiny new Touch Bar appears to be a welcome addition to a device due for a major revamp, it comes at a considerable price. Even the model without the dynamic bar won't come cheap, starting at £1,449. Don't worry yourself, though, because a pair of guardian angels/developers have figured out a way to bring you the Touch Bar without assaulting your bank account in the process. Okay, okay, so it's not the real deal, but a demo app is available on GitHub to provide you with free access to the tool. First spotted by 9to5Mac, the workaround can run on macOS via the Function key, or on an iPad through a USB connection. Related: MacBook Pro 2016 review: hands-on with Apple's latest high-end laptop If you're looking to run the cheat solely on your Mac, make sure you're fully up to date - that'll mean running macOS Sierra 10.12.1 build 16B2657 or above. Once you've downloaded the latest zip into your Applications tab and begun running the app, hitting the 'fn' key will bring you the warm glow of the Touch Bar. Except, y'know, you can't touch it. The iPad equivalent is a little more complex, as you'll need to load the app onto iOS and keep it plugged into your computer through a USB the entire time - no small feat considering the lack of ports available on Macs. You're not going to get the full experience with this, of course, but your wallet will definitely thank you. And if you somehow manage to win the lottery soon after implementing this shortcut, you can have the Touch Bar for reals. Want up-to-the-minute entertainment and tech news?

      "title": "Now you don't have to buy a fancy new car just to get Android Au",
      "text": "By Kyle Wiggers\nProvided by\nAndroid Auto began as Google’s answer to Apple’s CarPlay : in-car entertainment software that would play nicely with your phone. It provided seamless access to car-optimized apps like Google Play Music, Maps, Pandora, and useful real-time information like traffic incidents and weather. Since Android Auto’s launch nearly a year ago, though, it has been relegated to expensive new cars. But all that changed when Google announced a major update for Android Auto, version 2.0, that enables the in-car entertainment system on supported Android devices and tablets.\nIt is a boon for folks with older rides. Previously, you could only get Android Auto in one of two expensive ways: buying a new car that had it built into the factory stereo, or buying and installing a pricey head unit yourself. “[We] know there are millions of older cars on the road that are not compatible with Android Auto, and many don’t have a screen at all,” Gerhard Schobbe, Android Auto’s project manager, wrote in a blog post . “We wanted to bring the same connected experience to these drivers too.”\nRelated: Android Auto review\nThe new Android Auto client, which supports phones running Android 5.0 or newer, provides access to much the same interface as the one on high-end head units. It is hardware agnostic, Google said, meaning it will work regardless of whether or not you have a certain car display or mount. It launches automatically when your phone is paired to your car via Bluetooth. It will include enhanced hands-free voice commands, which include improved accessing features in Google Maps, music, and messaging apps, that Google said will launch in the coming weeks.\nFor the uninitiated, the Android Auto experience centers around the home screen, which shows three cards containing the most relevant bits of information at any given moment. If you receive a phone call or text, you will see the content of the message. If there is a road closure ahead, you will see detour details. And if there is inclement weather projected for your trip, you will receive an alert.\nApps are the other half of Android Auto’s equation and the platform is practically overflowing with them. They are informally divided into categories. Navigation apps include Maps, which provides turn-by-turn directions with distances, ETA to destinations, voice prompts, and pop-up notifications about upcoming lane switches and turns. Among the music apps are Google Play Music, Spotify, iHeart Radio, TuneIn, Joyride, Stitcher, podcast player Pocket Casts, and NPR One, all of which show album artwork and playback controls. Communication apps comprise Android Auto’s built-in messaging client, which let you send texts and initiate calls with voice. Voice apps — principally Google’s autonomous assistant, Google Now — provide navigational assistance, allowing you to launch apps, begin music playlists, pull up directions, get the local temperature, and even learn about the elevation of nearby geographic features all by shouting commands.\nRelated: Kia offers Apple CarPlay and Android Auto for cars new and old\nAndroid Auto on any old smartphone or tablet will not necessarily deliver the same experience as an integrated head unit. Hyundai, for instance, recently introduced MyHundai, an Android Auto app that provides access to Hyundai Roadside Assistance, monthly vehicle reports, maintenance alerts, and a Valet mode that notifies you if your car exits a pre-determined boundary. But it provides a pretty good approximation of the experience on head units and new cars. Considering it is free, perhaps that is good enough.\nGoogle said more than 200 new car models from 50 brands now support Android Auto. The most recent to climb aboard include, Kia, which recently added Android Auto as a free software update on cars spanning model years 2014 through 2017, and Hyundai, which rolled out the platform as part of an update for certain models of the carmaker’s Genesis, Elantra GT and Tucson, and Santa Fe.\nThis article was originally posted on Digital Trends\nContent provided by",

      "text": "Apple iMac 2017 Latest News & Updates: To Use Intel Kaby Lake Processor, Polaris 10 or Polaris 11 Chipset; VR-Ready PC? By Amy Westerly ,   02:00 pm Apple iMac fans have been waiting for an update to the iMac since a new MacBook Pro has been released. (Photo : DetroitBORG/YouTube) \nCupertino-based tech giant Apple has been keeping mum about the new Apple iMac 2017. Rumors have been swirling that the upcoming Apple iMac will integrate the new Intel Kaby Lake Processor with a Polaris 10 or Polaris 11 Chipset, with an added bonus that it will a VR-Ready PC. Advertisement \nThe Apple iMac users and technophiles were expecting the announcement alongside the release of the MacBook Pro 2016 last October. As of the moment, no description of any kind (specs, upgrades, etc.) have been released or announced regarding the much-anticipated replacement to the Apple's flagship computer. Speculations have it that insufficient supply of Intel's new Kaby Lake processor might be the culprit behind the delay of Apple iMac 2017. Since the MacBook Pro 2016 is already sporting Intel's latest Skylake CPU , it only makes sense for Apple to put a similarly new processor on their flagship model Apple iMac 2017. \nPlus, this could mean that the new Apple iMac 2017 might be sporting the new Touch Bar feature that debuted with the MacBook Pro. The Touch Bar feature is a touch-screen strip at the top of the keyboard that changes to display functions specific to the app being used. And if Apple eventually features the Touch Bar on the Apple iMac 2017 , there could be user mouse less or trackpad less menu-based tasks on the mix. This upgrade will be a good addition to the desktop user's productivity, though. \nThe Apple iMac 2017 is also rumored to sport either a Polaris 10 or Polaris 11 chipset, which has led to speculations that the new Apple iMac 2017 might just be the new powerful VR-ready PC on the block. If this is true, then the new Apple iMac 2017 will possess powerful specs, powerful enough to become an ultimate gaming tool with its processor and chipset combo. \nHowever, bear in mind that all of these are pure speculations and none have been made official by Apple. But with the recent upgrades and features seen on the MacBook Pro, dreams can surely come true for us, especially with the new Apple iMac 2017. iMac 2016 Release Date, Specs: Apple Launch Event Today -> #AppleEvent \n— The Reporter Times (@trtnation) October 27, 2016 \nKeep posted for more news on Apple iMac 2017.

      "text": "up vote 3 down vote accepted \nValid concern for both Android and iOS now that Apple has enabled third-party keyboard options there. \nFor Android, there are several security solutions with firewalls that enable you to cut off network access to particular applications, even if full network access is allowed in the permissions of those apps. Some require root access and I cannot personally attest to the efficacy of these applications, but several work with vanilla Android and are very well regarded. That said, \"well regarded\" doesn't mean secure—these apps pose the same threats as the ones you're trying to restrict. If it functions without root access, then—for reasons beyond my familiarity with the platform—they require full network access themselves. For apps that do require root access, they get root access which is even worse (and the act of rooting itself poses a significant security risk for that reason). I suppose it's a question of which entity you trust more: Google vs. a third-party developer. This can easily spiral into a debate over which entity would be most fearful of the law and bad press, but of course that is not sound as a sole consideration in the scope of information security; an attack prevented today is better than an attack today, justice served tomorrow. \nNot the easiest task to remove Google connectivity from your phone altogether, and the keyboard isn't going to be the bottleneck in a hypothetical breach on their part. Notwithstanding, there are keyboards that require neither root access nor any network access at all, although the user experience may prove dissatisfying/insufficient for your purposes. You can try Keymonk Keyboard which does not require any network access, but judging by the reviews it probably would not work that well for your purposes. One other option is to use something like LastPass or DashLane which I believe act as input methods like a keyboard does. Something brewing with 1Password that is worth looking into: they will fill in passwords without use of the clipboard (clipboard sniffing is another valid concern of this same nature, perhaps an even greater threat at the moment). All of those apps I listed could have their own ulterior motives. \nAt the end of the day, trust is more or less a (sad) fact of comfortable smartphone use today, and it can be difficult to determine who deserves it/who will respect privacy/whose infringements are most benign.",

      "title": "Nazem Kadri hit on Daniel Sedin a result of ‘just trying to go low’ | The Province",
      "text": "Ben Kuzma: Ex-Canuck Grabner grabs share of Big Apple spotlight with red-hot start \nNazem Kadri sees Jannik Hansen coming for him after a blindside hit on Daniel Sedin Sunday in Toronto. Craig Robertson / Toronto Sun/Postmedia Network \nTORONTO — Nazem Kadri feels that when he’s at his best, he’s both giving and taking a hit and if that requires living on the edge, so be it. \nBut the only worry the feisty Leafs centre had after clocking Vancouver’s Daniel Sedin with an open-ice hit on Saturday was that the Canucks star was all right. \nAfter avoiding suspension for the open-ice blow, which triggered a wild third period in the Leafs 6-3 win, Kadri defended the play. \n“For me, I thought I hit him in the body and that was the main point of contact,” Kadri said following the Leafs Monday practice, his first public comment on the incident. “I’m happy the league felt the same way. \n“I don’t know if there’s anything you can do differently. It happens pretty fast. It’s a very reacting type of play. I just tried to go low with it.” Nazem Kadri received a charging major for this hit on Daniel Sedin. #RGCL pic.twitter.com/FuUV6B5Ofa \n— Rogers NHL GCL (@RogersNHLGCL) November 6, 2016 \nThe Canucks felt differently, of course, as general manager Jim Benning relayed in a statement released on Sunday after the NHL’s department of player safety opted not to further punish Kadri. \n“I was on the phone all morning arguing our case,” Benning said. “We’re lucky because the way he fell, he could have been injured for a long time. \n“The ruling we got is that it wasn’t a late hit and from their (league’s) perspective, it wasn’t a hit to the head. But it was a player (Kadri) who could have held back for making that type of hit. We’ll have to live with it.” \nSedin’s twin brother Henrik was even more outspoken after the game. \n“He has a history,” Henrik Sedin said of Kadri. “He plays over the edge. That’s when you have to pay. The league has to step up and show that’s not something we want to see.” \nBut they won’t have to wait too long to avenge it. The fight-filled third period on Saturday will certainly build anticipation for a rematch between the two on Dec. 3 in Vancouver. \nBut the Leafs seemed to relish the emotion associated with the win, the team’s third in a row. \n“That’s hockey, I’m sure we would have done the same thing,” Kadri said about the scraps that ensued. “That reaction was pretty standard for a team that was down in a hockey game and we hit one of their best players.” \nKadri, who seems to have embraced the challenge of being a shut-down centre and the need to get under an opponent’s skin, defended his style of play. \n“Obviously, I want to play on the edge and I want to play gritty as well. All and all, I want to be hard to play against.” \nMeanwhile, the Leafs practised on Monday in preparation for a Tuesday home date against the Los Angeles Kings. With three victories in a row, the Leafs have the opportunity to extend a winning streak longer than all of last season. \n“It’s good for our group,” coach Mike Babcock said. “We’re 4-1 at home. We want to be real good at home. I thought our team played well last game and that we didn’t give up very much. And we were able to win a game without your goaltender being the first star, which is nice.” Jason Botchford joins John Matisz on Off The Post: \nCLICK HERE to report a typo. \nIs there more to this story?

      "text": "Ben Kuzma: Ex-Canuck Grabner grabs share of Big Apple spotlight with red-hot start \nBROOKLYN, N.Y. — Points to ponder as the struggling Canucks (4-7-2) and Islanders (4-6-2) — two of six NHL clubs with 10 or fewer points — clash at the Barclays Center in the fourth of six stops on Vancouver’s Reality Tour. (4 p.m., Sportsnet Pacific, TSN 1040): Hansen to rescue, to injury reserve \nJannik Hansen has a shoulder ailment and has been placed on injury reserve — unavailable for a minimum of seven days — and has returned to Vancouver for further evaluation. Chris Tanev (foot) has also left the road trip to be further examined. \nNeither is a good sign. Hansen has two goals and four assists, is a staple on the penalty kill and was playing on the first line. Tanev is a top-pairing defenceman whose name regularly surfaces with teams talking trade with the Canucks. \nThe Canucks recalled centre Michael Chaput, 24, from the Utica Comets and he’ll play on the fourth line tonight, while the goal-less Loui Eriksson returns to the top line. \nHansen’s exit comes after a stunning Saturday sequence. The winger suffered a shoulder injury on a hit from Toronto Maple Leafs defenceman Morgan Rielly and then fought Nazem Kadri, after the centre levelled Daniel Sedin with a predatory hit that did not result in a suspension. \n“He was fighting with a bad shoulder — and that says a lot,” said Canucks coach Willie Desjardins. “Towards the end of the fight he had to get out of there because he couldn’t go. For him to jump up and step in right away was good to see. The one thing you like out of that game was that we stuck together. You like that we cared. \n“If you don’t care, then you don’t have any emotion and you don’t battle.” Daniel dishes on the hit \nDaniel Sedin said the hit from Kadri was a blur. He had to be reminded that he actually scored off the 2-on-1 rush with Henrik Sedin before all hell broke loose and that the league doesn’t always see things the way he might. \nKadri got a charging major but no hearing or supplemental discipline. \n“They made their decision and arguments and I really don’t have an opinion — I have to move on,” he said Monday following the game-day skate. “When you see the hit and after the game, I really didn’t know what to expect and obviously there was some confusion. \n“And everything happened so quickly. They have their rules to follow and try to do the best job they can. What I liked the most is the way we stood up for each other and you never want to see an injury (Hansen), but standing up for each other, I was proud of our guys and hopefully it’s a starting point.” \nAdded Desjardins about the Kadri hit decision: “I was disappointed. It’s a coach’s job to take care of his players. We thought it was more toward the head area and that always gets you more worried. Our game is physical and there are always going to be calls teams disagree with.” \nDaniel Sedin will be happy to win 1-0 and 2-1 games. Daniel dishes on team skid \nAs for the Canucks being on an eight-game losing streak and being beset by injury — Henrik Sedin suffered a shoulder injury here in Brooklyn last January — it’s all looking way too familiar. \nThey beat the Islanders in a shootout and, two nights later, lost in overtime to the Rangers. They went 3-2-1 on a six-game road trip and scored 16 goals. They did surrender eye-popping shot totals of 40, 40, 48, 49, 30 and 30, but were at a respectable 20-18-11 and still talking playoffs. \nNow, all the talk is about being in close games despite being blanked in four of the last six and finding a way to win on this trip in which they’ve gone 0-3 and have scored just three times. \n“It’s tough with injuries and you’ve got to work through it,” said Daniel. “We believe we can score and we have those guys on this team. It’s a matter of putting that first one in and things will get easier. \n“And there’s a different feeling from last year. Our system didn’t really work, and we have to keep believing our system will work. We’ll take a 1-0 or 2-1 win.” Chaput gets another NHL shot \nThe recalled Chaput has played 58 NHL games with the Columbus Blue Jackets and knows something about winning. \nHe won a Calder Cup last spring with the Lake Erie Monsters, the AHL affiliate of the Blue Jackets. A restricted free agent, the Canucks signed the 6-foot-2, 204-pound Ile Bizard, Que., native on July 1, to a one-year, two-way contract that pays $600,000 US at the NHL level and $225,000 in the minors. There’s also a $350,000 guarantee in the AHL. \nChaput has two goals and 11 assists in 10 AHL games this season and had eight points (2-6) in the 17-game run to the Calder Cup title. \n“It was amazing,” recalled Chaput. “You see what it takes to get through that long playoff run and it was a great experience that adds to the resume. It just helps along the way. I’m just going to bring my two-way game tonight, bring some offence because I’ve been with (Alex) Grenier and our power play has been working well in Utica.” Isles lose Hamonic to broken thumb \nAs if the Islanders need more bad news. \nTravis Hamonic is expected to be sidelined four to six weeks with a suspected broken right thumb. He suffered the injury Saturday when blocking a shot in a 4-3 shootout loss to the Edmonton Oilers. \nAdam Pelech has been recalled, but the Islanders will suffer without one of their top blue liners, much like the Canucks minus the injured Tanev. \n“We’re going to have to make the best of it,” Islanders coach Jack Capuano told Newsday. “Travis was playing on the first power play, first-unit penalty kill, 21 minutes a night and alternate captain.” \nPelech will play with Nick Leddy. \nThe Islanders have failed to win five games where they’ve either held the lead or been tied late in the third period. They’ve also allowed nine power-play goals in the last six games. And the power play is only 4-for-35. \nOF NOTE — Alex Edler (shoulder) is expected to return tonight. … Ryan Miller and Jaroslav Halak get goaltending starts tonight. Miller went back-to-back here in January, making 47- and 46-save efforts respectively in a 2-1 shootout win over the Islanders and 3-2 overtime loss to the Rangers. … Coquitlam native Mathew Barzal, the 16th pick in the 2015 draft, has played but two games and the centre is scratched again tonight.

      "text": "Ben Kuzma: Ex-Canuck Grabner grabs share of Big Apple spotlight with red-hot start \nNolan Patrick, left, is a hot commodity. He also hasn't played in four weeks. Marissa Baecker / Getty Images Brandon Wheat Kings star has missed 11 games with upper-body injury and also pulled out of this week's Canada Russia Series games \nVancouver Canucks fans wanting to track projected 2017 NHL No. 1 draft Nolan Patrick will have to continue to wait. \nPatrick, the 18-year-old Brandon Wheat Kings centre many are suggesting will be the first name called next June at the draft in Chicago, has missed the past 11 games with an upper-body injury and Brandon general manager Grant Armstrong said Monday morning: “We’re not certain when we’re going to see him back in the lineup. \n“We’re not ruling out anything at this point, but we also can’t rule anything in. We’re trying to make sure he’s 100-per-cent healthy.” \nPatrick, who is listed at 6-foot-3 and 198 pounds, has four goals and five assists in six games so far this season with the Wheat Kings. He had 41 goals and 61 assists in 72 regular-season games last year with Brandon, then supplied 13 goals and 17 assists in 21 playoff games for the WHL champions. \nIt was announced last week that the son of former NHL winger Steve Patrick and nephew of ex-NHL defenceman James Patrick wouldn’t take part in the Canada Russia Series. The opening game was slated for Monday in Prince George. There’s another matchup Tuesday in Edmonton, before the set moves to the OHL and the QMJHL. \nPatrick had sports-hernia surgery in July, which caused the Winnipeg native to miss the Canadian World Junior team summer camp. Armstrong wouldn’t elaborate on whether that ailment is a factor in this situation. \n“I’m not saying anything about the injury, other than that it’s upper body, day-to-day,” explained Armstrong. \nCraig Button of TSN stated in a scouting report on Patrick in September that he had “all the capabilities to be the No. 1 centre teams can build around. Has an ease to his play, both physically and mentally, that he combines with excellent skill to impact the game in every situation.” \nBrandon starts their lone B.C. trip this season on Nov. 30 with a visit to Victoria. That’s followed by stops in Vancouver (Dec. 2), Kelowna (Dec. 3), Kamloops (Dec. 4) and Prince George (Dec. 7). \nBrandon finished the 2015-16 regular season at 48-18-4-2. They’re 7-7-3-0 so far this season. Along with the Patrick injury, they’ve seen defenceman Ivan Provorov stick with the Philadelphia Flyers as a 19-year-old. \nArmstrong was hired in August, taking over the GM role from Kelly McCrimmon, who moved into an assistant GM spot with the NHL’s Las Vegas expansion team. McCrimmon does remain owner of the Wheat Kings, though. \nArmstrong had been assistant GM for the Victoria Royals and was key in building that franchise. Before that, he had been head scout with the Portland Winterhawks. \nCLICK HERE to report a typo. \nIs there more to this story?

      "text": "Ben Kuzma: Ex-Canuck Grabner grabs share of Big Apple spotlight with red-hot start \nCanucks vs Islanders. Bruce Bennett / Getty Images \nThings are looking up for the Vancouver Canucks as they get set to do battle with the New York Islanders. \nGranted, they lost their eighth in a row in Toronto on Saturday, but that night, they became a team . Before Saturday they were just a collection of dudes wearing the same sweater. Basically a Gap ad. No wonder they were so inoffensive. Now, though? Team. \n“It’s great to see us sticking together,” Daniel Sedin said when the smoke cleared. “The game got out of hand, but we stayed together.” \nYou know who advocates sticking together? People that are stuck together. But I digress. Willie Desjardins echoed Daniel’s sentiment: “All you have is each other and I have no problems with our guys sticking up for one another.” \nIt’s all very sweet. Forget the losing streak. The Canucks may not have won the game, or any games at all in two and a half excruciating weeks, but they were there for each other . It was less a Hockey Night in Canada telecast than an episode of Full House. And like Full House, it starred a set of twins, and there was lots of hugging. Old time hockey. pic.twitter.com/5mJM1U1uvy \nPlus white people everywhere you look . \nSarcasm aside, it’s good that the Canucks have each other’s backs, especially since the league sure doesn’t . Considering all the troubles they’ve had, you’d hate to see this team start to unravel. (Admittedly, a team unravelling would look pretty much the same, but that’s not what it was, OK? This was a team coming together . Embrace the spin.) The Canucks lost as a team on Saturday night — as one — and that’s far better than losing as 19 individuals. It counts as 18 fewer losses that way. \nSpeaking of 18 losses, if the Canucks want to avoid getting halfway to that number on their current slide, they can stop the streak at eight by winning as a team Monday night in Brooklyn. Maybe they will? \nThey’ll have to do it without a crucial member: Jannik Hansen will miss the contest due to a shoulder injury sustained in Saturday night’s Miller-Boyett production . Here’s the lineup. Via @HockeyAbbs , Virtanen and Stecher out tonight (4:00 vs NYI, #TSN1040 ) pic.twitter.com/7KjEBD4GAh \n— TSN Radio Vancouver (@TSN1040) November 7, 2016 \nHansen’s a big loss. Of the nine Canucks who have scored a goal this season, he’s one of just five who’s done it more than once. Now might be a good time for Loui Eriksson to reassert himself as a first-line player. \nMeanwhile, Jake Virtanen is out with a bad case of your coach hates you . Jack Skille and AHL call-up Michael Chaput draw in on the fourth line. And on defence, Alex Edler returns, pushing Troy Stecher to the press box. He’ll skate with Philip Larsen on what has to be the worst first pairing since chianti and tuna salad. But no matter. This Canucks lineup isn’t about individuals. It’s about the team . \nRyan Miller starts in goal. And Canucks Live starts now. Harrison Mooney November 7, 2016 3:39 pm \nIf you’re wondering why Troy Stecher is scratched tonight, Grainne’s got the answer: the canucks scratched stecher because edler's back and nhl rules state that you can only have one marginally good dman dressed at a time ",

      "text": "Ben Kuzma: Ex-Canuck Grabner grabs share of Big Apple spotlight with red-hot start \nJoanna Jedrzejczyk, left, fights Valerie Letourneau during their UFC 193 straw-weight title fight in Melbourne on Nov. 15, 2015. Andy Brownbill / AP \nAlmost as soon as Ronda Rousey kicked down the door to the Octagon and ushered women into the UFC, the promotion has been on a search to find her successor — the next all-encompassing superstar to take over for the Olympic bronze medallist once she decides to end her career in the cage. \nJust as hockey had several “Next Gretzkys” who fell short and countless basketball players failed to shoulder the weight of being “the Next Michael Jordan,” the UFC rushed to brand a pair of competitors as potential heirs to Rousey’s throne, only to have them turned back before coming close to reaching those elite heights. \nWhat’s interesting about the company’s initial failure in cultivating a successor to the former bantamweight champion is that while Rose Namajunas and Paige VanZant were faltering under the weight of the increased scrutiny that comes with the unnecessary moniker, Joanna Jedrzejczyk is poised to inherit the torch from Rousey and potentially eclipse her accomplishments. \nIn terms of performance, Jedrzejczyk is already running neck-and-neck with Rousey, who returns following her first professional loss and a one-year hiatus to challenge Amanda Nunes for the women’s bantamweight title at UFC 207 on Dec. 30. Both have six victories inside the Octagon. And while the Polish standout hasn’t dispatched her challengers as quickly as her American counterpart, Jedrzejczyk has been no less dominant, blowing out Carla Esparza, Jessica Penne and Valerie Letourneau in her first three championship assignments. \nTwo things might allow her to surpass Rousey. \nThe first is that Jedrzejczyk has already shown her championship resolve in the cage, rallying from being down two rounds against Claudia Gadelha in her most recent outing to defeat the No. 1 contender with style points when they clashed in July. Where Rousey looked like a deer in the headlights in her championship loss to Holly Holm last November at UFC 193, Jedrzejczyk never panicked in her rematch with Gadelha, eventually turning the tide and taking it to her rival over the final three rounds. \nSecond, the undefeated 29-year-old has no plans to exit the Octagon for a career in Hollywood. She wants her stardom to come as a result of her exploits in the cage, and her talent and intangibles already have her well on the way to achieving legendary status in the sport. \n“I know that I’m not the prettiest one, I’m not having big boobies or I’m not American, but I want people to remember me as the best female fighter and the UFC champion of the world,” she said during last week’s UFC 205 conference call. \nThe comment prompted welterweight champ Tyron Woodley to call Jedrzejczyk an “original gangster,” but it also encapsulates everything that makes her the true heir to Rousey’s throne. \nJedrzejczyk managed to avoid the forced comparison with her bantamweight counterpart earlier in her career, quietly emerging as a potential superstar in the week leading up to her championship win at UFC 185 in Dallas, and they’re still not coming now. But if anyone has the potential to live up to, or potentially exceed, the level of success and stardom Rousey has achieved, it’s Jedrzejczyk. \nShe’s already there in terms of performance, and her championship clash with fellow unbeaten Polish fighter Karolina Kowalkiewicz Saturday at UFC 205 in New York is another opportunity for the undefeated titleholder to prove her dominance in the cage. She’s also committed to widening her level of exposure and brand reach, moving to South Florida to train at American Top Team and making herself more readily available to the North American media, the value of which can’t be underestimated. \n“I want to build more and more my legacy and I think I’ve got more attention from U.S. media since I moved to Florida,” she said when we spoke Monday. “I know how important it is, not just for my career, but for the UFC, for MMA, so we need more and more MMA in mainstream media. I see that Ronda has done so much for this — Conor McGregor as well — and I’m happy to be part of it.” \nJust as positioning her alongside Rousey last year at UFC 193 was a savvy decision by the UFC, so too is including this bout with Kowalkiewicz in Saturday’s historic debut at Madison Square Garden. \nJedrzejczyk is already a superstar within the MMA world and with the right opportunities, she too can cross over into the mainstream and become that “Next Ronda Rousey” the UFC has been searching for over the last couple of years. to report a typo.

      "text": "Ben Kuzma: Ex-Canuck Grabner grabs share of Big Apple spotlight with red-hot start \nCal Clutterbuck scores the game winner on Ryan Miller. Bruce Bennett / Getty Images \nBROOKLYN, N.Y — Points to ponder as the Canucks actually scored first Monday — only the second time in 13 games — but faded in the third period in a 4-2 loss to the Islanders to extend their losing streak to a sobering nine games: \nNO-GO ZONE BECOMES FREE-FLY ZONE \nRyan Miller referenced all the bad bounces and rebounds landing on sticks or in the net. He referenced finding the collective resolve to turn this thing around. But what really has to happen is what isn’t happening down low. Did you notice? \nDid you notice the struggling Philip Larsen trying to get through the neutral zone like he was trying to tip-toe through land mines? Did you see how slow he was getting back on the Islanders’ first goal, a strange sequence where Anders Lee swatted a loose puck for an easy Jason Chimera goal because three defenders were watching, not engaging? \nAlex Edler noticed. \nRyan Miller and Alex Edler. Bruce Bennett / Getty Images \n“I definitely think we can approve,” said the Canucks defenceman. “We have to be more aggressive down low. When they can control the puck and start cycling, that’s hard to defend for any team. We have to get in there quicker and react quicker and be more aggressive.” \nIt’s almost as if the Canucks are trying to do too much. Erik Gudbranson slid early to stop a Thomas Hickey shot and he stepped around the defenceman and had ample time to shoot. The vacated space also allowed John Tavares to bat a loose puck to Nikolay Kulemin for the second goal. \n“There’s no doubt that everybody is giving everything and trying to get a win here — and maybe too much — but we’ve got to stay positive here,” added Edler. “We believe we have a good system and if we execute it, we will get wins.” \nDESJARDINS HAS THAT DEFEATED LOOK \nWillie Desjardins didn’t say much after the demoralizing loss. In a business where winning is everything, nine losses are weighing on him and a 10th on Tuesday against the Rangers would match a franchise record established in 1997. It cost Tom Renney his job. \nKeeping his club mentally focussed the rest of this winless trip is a challenge. \n“It’s tough,” he admitted. “You need some good results and it’s nice we got that first one (goal) tonight. We were there and we also got one on the power play, so some good things happened. \n“But in the third, we didn’t take it away like we needed to. We played our best hockey of the last five and to be successful, we have to play that way all the time. It seems we have to get behind before we get excited and really get going.” \nDANIEL CUTS TO THE CHASE \nDaniel Sedin opened scoring and said all the right things all day about how this system is good, how winning 1-0 and 2-1 games are the way it has to be because a better defensive structure will pull the club out of the muck. But when the wins aren’t there, then what? How do you sell this in the room? \nAnders Lee trips up Daniel Sedin. Bruce Bennett / Getty Images \n“We’re battling hard, but we’ve got to find a way to win a game,” he said. “It was nice to get the first goal because it’s tough to play from behind. You could tell when we got that first one that we felt a lot better about our game. \n“We have to go for that first goal. We can’t sit back because when they get the lead, we stop playing. But tonight we had a good start, but we need that every game. \n“When you have the lead, you can wait for their mistakes.” \nARE THEY SLIP, SLIDING AWAY? \nRyan Miller has the best seat in the house with what is and isn’t happening in front of him. On Monday, it was obvious. \n“On their second goal, we had two D-men sliding and that’s not really who we are,” said Miller. “You can’t fault guys for making the read and trying to be desperate. Even on the first goal, a nice block off the rush, a secondary block and they knock it out of the air and put it in the crease and score. \n“Even when things are going our way in tight games, we can’t afford to make mistakes.” ",

      "text": "The second beta of iOS 10.2 has been pushed to developers, bringing a number of changes to the operating system, which will ultimately be pushed to consumers.\nPerhaps the biggest change to iOS is the fact that it now has the TV app that was shown off during Apple’s October 27 event. The app allows users to view content from a range of other streaming accounts, although Netflix will not be among the list of providers at launch, according to reports from Recode .\nMore: Facebook gradually moving into TV advertising with Apple TV and Roku TV ads\nApart from the TV app, the new iOS 10.2 beta comes with a few design tweaks in Apple Music, and some new SOS features.\nWhen it comes to the SOS features, users will now be able to press the power button five times to automatically dial an emergency number. The feature works in Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Hong Kong, India, Italy, Japan, Russia, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the United States. You can manage the settings for the new SOS feature by heading to the Settings app and scrolling to the General section.\nThe Music app has also gotten a few design tweaks to make using it a little easier. For example, the Shuffle and Repeat buttons have both been made a little more prominent, and you can simply swipe up to access those larger buttons.\nApart from the TV app and the new Music app, there are a few new emojis and a few redesigned emojis, as well as a new selection of wallpapers. You’ll also get the option to save the camera settings, plus support for a single sign-on, which lets users with a subscription to a cable service sign in only once to access multiple apps.\n100 awesome iPhone apps for 2016 Best iPhone fitness apps Microsoft launches a single two-factor authentication app for mobile platforms",

      "text": "share Apple is officially selling iPhones for the first time in its online store , as spotted by 9to5Mac . Prices are discounted by up to 15 percent off compared to new models. A listed refurbished rose gold 64GB iPhone 6S Plus is on sale for $589, for instance, and a silver 16GB iPhone 6S Plus is $529. Apple’s refurbished phones come with a one-year warranty — just like new iPhones — and include a new battery and outer shell. They’re also unlocked and don’t include a SIM card. Apple already sells refurbished Macs, iPads, MacBooks, and Mac accessories, among other products, but this is the first time the company’s putting its phones up for sale. The refurbished phones might be coming from Apple’s iPhone Upgrade Program. Now get out there and buy yourself a still-expensive iPhone.",

REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration/File Photo \nDUBLIN Ireland's government will this week formally submit its appeal against the European Commission's multi-billion-euro demand for back taxes from Apple ( AAPL.O ), Finance Minister Michael Noonan said on Tuesday. \nIreland's cabinet agreed in September to join the iPhone maker in appealing the Commission's order that the U.S. tech giant pay up to 13 billion euros to Dublin after ruling the firm had received illegal state aid. \nDublin is seeking to protect a tax regime that has attracted many multinational employers. The European Commission decision has also angered Washington, which accuses it of trying to grab tax revenue that should go to the United States. \n\"The government fundamentally disagrees with the European Commission's analysis and the decision left no choice but to take an appeal to the European Courts and this will be submitted tomorrow,\" Noonan told a European Parliament committee in Brussels. \n(Reporting by Padraic Halpin; editing by Andrew Roche)  ",

      "text": "Apple on Monday released iOS 10.2 beta 2, a freshened up version of its initial iOS 10.2 beta that had been released just one week earlier on Halloween day. The releases were a bit closer than usual, but Apple was apparently eager to get the new build into developers' hands. Why the rush? iOS 10.2 beta 2 is about much more than just bug fixes — it's the first version of Apple's iOS 10.2 software that includes the brand new \"TV\" app that Apple showed off on stage during its big MacBook Pro event in late October.\nNow, following a successful rollout to developers on Monday, iOS 10.2 public beta 2 has been released, giving the public the opportunity to begin testing TV.\nMUST READ: Hey Apple, why are you trolling us?\nApple's new TV app serves as a one-stop shop for online video. Well, almost — it doesn't support Netflix for reasons we explained late last month . But aside from Netflix, TV collects information about videos from all of the most popular services out there, such as HBO Go, Hulu, Showtime Anytime and much more. It allows you to browse and search videos, and it also makes recommendations based on your history. Then, when you find a movie or TV show you want to watch, tapping on it will switch to the appropriate app so you can begin streaming.\niOS 10.2 public beta 2 also includes a number of other features and refinements, including dozens of new emoji that arrive with Unicode 9.0 support. A face palm emoji, shrug emoji and a clown emoji are just a few of the additions you can look forward to.\nApple's new iOS 10.2 public beta 2 software is available to anyone registered with the public beta program as an over the air (OTA) download. To install it, simply go to Settings > General > Software Update and follow the on-screen instructions. This presumes you've already installed the public beta profile, which is available for download on Apple's public beta site.\nIf you're not already registered for Apple's public iOS beta program, you can register on Apple's website for free right here .\nTrending right now:\nEvidence suggests Apple is working on the biggest mobile game-changer since the original iPhone Amazon’s 15 best deals: 128GB microSD, insanely thin iPhone 7/7 Plus cases, $25 Fire TV Stick, more Donald Trump’s son just broke the law while voting See the original version of this article on BGR.com",
