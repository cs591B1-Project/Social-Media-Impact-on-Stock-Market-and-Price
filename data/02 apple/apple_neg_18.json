      "text": "Apple is planning wearable glasses: Report IndiaToday.in Last Updated: NOV 15, 2016 New Delhi Email Author \nApple will soon be sailing in untested waters with expansion in wearable glass headsets. The company is in talks with potential suppliers to develop smart glass headsets, something similar to Google's failed Glass project. \nThe wearable headset would show images, along with other information and may use augmented reality, according to a report by Bloomberg. \nChief Executive Tim Cook, who has been struggling with a slowdown in iPhone sales in recent quarters, said earlier this year that the company would continue to invest a lot into augmented reality. \nApple, the world's largest technology company, has ordered a small number of near-eye displays for testing but has not obtained enough for production on a larger scale, the report added. \nApple declined to comment. \nThe move would make Apple the latest tech company to venture into wearable glasses. \nAlphabet Inc's discontinued its own wearable glass headset, Google Glass, and closed the social media account linked to the device earlier this year, ending its attempt to popularize the expensive devices with consumers. \nThe device received plenty of attention when it was launched in 2012, but quickly ran into problems with its awkward appearance and privacy concerns over video recording. \nIn September this year, the popular messaging app Snapchat, now Snap, announced its video-camera sunglasses. The wearable sunglasses went on sale earlier last week. \nWith Reuters inputs For more news from India Today, follow us on Twitter @IndiaTodayTech and on Facebook at facebook.com/indiatodaytech For news and videos in Hindi, go to AajTak.in .ताज़ातरीन ख़बरों और वीडियो के लिए आजतक.इन पर आएं.

      "text": "Last Updated: NOV 16, 2016 New Delhi Email Author Photo: Veniamin Geskin \niPhone 8, Apple's flagship for 2017, is expected to be super special since it will launch around iPhone's 10 anniversary. Although it is little too early to say anything certain about the next Apple phone, but the reports are pouring in. And now there's a new one from KGI analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, he says that there will be three iPhone 8 next year. \nTech site MacRumors has obtained a new research note from Kuo, which says, \"We look for new 2017 iPhones to come in three models: one OLED model, and two TFT-LCD models with 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch display. We believe the OLED and 5.5-inch TFT-LCD iPhones will feature [a] dual-camera.\" \nIn the recent weeks we have already heard about Apple working with Sharp to put OLED displays in the coming iPhone. This was reported by Nikkei citing Sharp's CEO Tai Jeng-wu that Apple is switching from LTPS to OLED soon. Nikkei had also said that Apple will have three iPhones, two with LTPS and one with OLED panel. According to the report, the iPhone 8 will have three sizes- 4.7-inch, 5-inch and 5.5-inch. \nThe KGI analyst has suggested that one of the TFT-LCD iPhone will be sized 5.5-inch, he didn't specify the OLED iPhone's size. \nMeanwhile, Barclays analysts Blayne Curtis and Christopher Hemmelgarn have suggested two sizes of the iPhone 8, 5-inch and 5.8-inch. The Barclays analysts said that the company will put OLED in the 5.8-inch iPhone. \nWhile there are several reports about the iPhone 8's sizes, one thing that has remained somewhat constant with all these reports is the talk of a curved and bezel-less display. \nAs we have noticed Apple likes to keep all the premium features to the biggest iPhone, it wouldn't be surprising to find most of the rumoured features to come with the premium variant of the iPhone 8. Also read: iPhone 8 will have curved display and wireless charging. Here is everything we know so far \nIn the Nikkei report, it was also said that Foxconn is working on wireless charging module to be put inside the coming iPhone. And in another recent report, Apple is working with a company named Energous to add a 'truly wireless technology' in the upcoming iPhone. \nThe wireless charging technology so far requires the compatible phone to be placed on a charging pad, although it doesn't use any wires, it limits the phone's usability for the time it is being charged. \nThe new technology will be different in this aspect. According to the report, Apple will implement some sort of module into the iPhone 8. The module will connect to a transmitter plugged into a wall socket. If the report is true, the setup will allow the iPhone 8 to charge wirelessly to a distance up to 15-feet from the transmitter. \nTo sum it up, the OLED iPhone 8 will possibly have 5.8-inch curved and bezel-less display, while the other two phones will have the usual displays sans curves and with bezels. However, we expect all three phones to support wireless charging. There are reports that support each other and then there are some that add new information, however, at this point we would suggest you to take all these reports with a grain of salt. The launch of next iPhone, iPhone 8 or not, is still far and we will update you with many such reports.

      "title": "15-inch MacBook Pro Uses a Non-Removable SSD",
      "text": "15-inch MacBook Pro Uses a Non-Removable SSD 6 hrs ago 0 \nApple creates device it expects you to use and then replace, but never repair. We know this from the countless teardowns iFixit carries out on iDevices only to find lots of glue, soldered in place components, and a generally hostile environment for anyone venturing inside. And with the launch of the 15-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar late last month, Apple removed the last user-friendly component from the laptop: the SSD. \nThe 13-inch MacBook Pro without the Touch Bar retains the removable SSD seen in earlier models, but the 15-inch Touch Bar model (and we have to assume the 13-inch model, too) replaces it with storage chips soldered to the logic board. \nThe change was confirmed by MacRumors reader Jesse D. who was brave enough to unscrew the base of his new MacBook Pro to take a look. Sure enough, he found the logic board cutout where the removable SSD usually sits had gone. The soldered in place chips can be seen in the image above. \nStorage is usually the first component that gets replaced in a laptop, either due to an issue or simply as part of an upgrade. But Apple removes that option completely from Touch Bar models of its laptop. If anything goes wrong with the SSD, the entire logic board will have to be replaced, which won't be cheap. \nThe situation is actually worse than that, though. By soldering the storage to the board, if anything else goes wrong on the logic board you also lose all your data. You can't simply remove the SSD and recover the data anymore. \nBacking up your data on a regular basis is a task everyone should be doing anyway, but if a MacBook Pro with Touch Bar is your next purchase, it becomes absolutely essential. \nThis article originally appeared on PCMag.com .

      "text": "Apple's iPhone is no longer the best Google phone That may sound absurd, but hear me out. \nA simple \"G\" on the back of the Pixel lets you know it's made by Google. Jason Cipriani/ZDNet \nHaving spent the better part of the past month using Google's Pixel XL smartphone , I still think Google made one of the best phones of the year. \nI have zero hesitation recommending either Pixel phone to a friend, family member, or a complete stranger when asked. In fact, my recommendations as of right now are the iPhone 7 Plus or Pixel XL. You can't go wrong with either one. \nThe Pixel's camera takes crisp photos and is incredibly fast. The phone itself is a workhorse, with long battery life and practically no slowdown even as it's pushed to its limits. \nHowever, what I find most appealing about the Pixel isn't something you'll find on the spec sheet. It's that, for the first time, there's an Android phone that's also the best Google phone money can buy. \nThat may sound absurd, but hear me out. Apple hardware, Google software \nAs someone who is deeply rooted in Apple's hardware and Google's software, I've long said the best Google phone money can buy is the iPhone. \nGoogle doesn't shy away from making its software products available on iOS. Look at the list of Google apps in the App Store, and then name one of its major software products that isn't available for the iPhone. Google Drive, Docs, Sheets, Slides... They're all there. Chrome, Gmail, Google Maps... They're all there, too. \nGranted, the apps often lack some key functionality, and it feels as if Google has given up on keeping pace with Apple's latest software features and design guidelines. For example, last week's update to the Gmail app was the first major update in nearly four years. At the end of the day, however, the apps are available and usable. \nWith so many variables and inconsistent experiences across Android devices (Samsung pushing its services alongside Google's; LG still trying to make heavily customized Android skins work; the Nexus line struggling to find a purpose), a true Google phone has never really existed. Android devices up until now have primarily been a mishmash of two different approaches butting heads, hoping to make two companies some money along the way. \nApple's hardware design and reliable camera combined with Googles' apps running on iOS made the case all on its own. Pixelation of Google services \nEverything about the Pixel is unapologetically Google. \nStarting with the G logo on the back to the startup animation centering around Google and not the familiar green Android robot, Android has taken a backseat to Google when it comes to the Pixel. \nAdding to the value of Google's phone is the fact that Google Assistant is -- for the time being -- exclusive to the Pixel. Furthermore, Google Photos now offers unlimited video and photo backup for Pixel owners. \nAssistant and unlimited Photos storage are two services those who are entrenched in Google services won't find on the iPhone or another Android device.

      "text": "ZDNet Japan UAG Monarch retail box \nApple iPhone owners have hundreds of case options to choose from and finding one you like can be a bit intimidating. One of my top three case makers, Urban Armor Gear, just released a new series for the Apple iPhone 7 Plus and I give it my highest recommendation. \nEveryone who I have recommended UAG cases has come back to me gushing about the design, protection, and good looks. The new Monarch series is UAG's best design I've ever tested with improved grip, better drop protection, and the use of leather to add an element of class that is perfect for the business environment. Published: November 16, 2016 -- 12:47 GMT (12:47 GMT) \nCaption by: Matthew Miller Back of the box and UAG Monarch ready for installation \nThe new Monarch series offers five-layers of protection wtih a tough frame piece, top grain leather, a polycarbonate shear plate, alloy metal hardware torx screws holding the layers secure, and impact resistant rubber. The case meets the 2X military drop-test standards, MIL STD 810G 516.6. It also comes with a 10-year limited warranty, which is longer than anyone ever keeps a smartphone. \nIt's a one piece case available in graphite and platinum colors for $59.95. It is simple to install, just snap your iPhone 7 Plus down and into place. The front of the case is designed to rise above your display about a millimeter or two so that you can rest your iPhone face down on a table and rest assured the display is not directly on the surface.

Published: November 16, 2016 -- 12:47 GMT (12:47 GMT) \nCaption by: Matthew Miller Photos are not compromised at all \nThe opening for the dual cameras and flash is large so you won't suffer from any issues while taking photos and videos. Published: November 16, 2016 -- 12:47 GMT (12:47 GMT) \nCaption by: Matthew Miller Left side of the UAG Monarch \nThere are ample openings for the camera and flash, Lightning port, speakers, and ringer switch. Raised buttons are in place for the power and volume buttons on your iPhone 7 Plus. Published: November 16, 2016 -- 12:47 GMT (12:47 GMT) \nCaption by: Matthew Miller Improved honeycomb side design \nUAG improved the side grip of the device through the use of soft rubber in a honeycomb pattern running down both sides and a bit around and onto the back. I can't believe how easy it is to hold my iPhone in one hand with the UAG Monarch in place. Published: November 16, 2016 -- 12:47 GMT (12:47 GMT) \nCaption by: Matthew Miller Bottom openings for the Lightning port and speakers \nThere are ample openings for the camera and flash, Lightning port, speakers, and ringer switch. Raised buttons are in place for the power and volume buttons on your iPhone 7 Plus. There is even an opening for the 3.5mm headset jack found on the iPhone 6 Plus and 6s Plus. \nYou can also use this with the iPhone 6 Plus and 6s Plus since they are all the same size, but just have different camera opening requirements. The buttons and openings are in the same position so I recommend this case even if you don't have the latest iPhone 7 model. Published: November 16, 2016 -- 12:47 GMT (12:47 GMT) \nCaption by: Matthew Miller Loving the leather accents on the back \nAs much as I am impressed by the side design and improved grip, the new back design is fantastic. I love the composite frame piece, leather highlights, and aluminum torx screws in three of the corners. Your iPhone 7 Plus is well protected and looks fabulous as well. With my matte black iPhone 7 Plus, the graphite UAG Monarch is a perfect companion and protector. Published: November 16, 2016 -- 12:47 GMT (12:47 GMT) \nCaption by: Matthew Miller Raised edge around the display \nYour display will stay safe if you rest your phone on a table as the case keeps it raised up a bit. Published: November 16, 2016 -- 12:47 GMT (12:47 GMT) \nCaption by: Matthew Miller UAG Monarch provides the protection you need \nThanks to the iPhone 7 Plus water resistance, you can use the Monarch to provide drop protection while Apple provides the water resistance you need. Published: November 16, 2016 -- 12:47 GMT (12:47 GMT) \nCaption by: Matthew Miller PREV UAG Monarch for Apple iPhone 7 Plus: Five layer protection includes top grain leather Since my iPhone must last a year until the next phone is released, it's important to find a case I want to use daily.

Well, your wish may finally be the chaebol’s command, at least as far as the latter gripe is concerned, with Samsung Pay properly working on the Gear S3, including “with other Android devices running 4.4 KitKat or above.”\nOther, as in not just select Galaxy phones like the S7 family, S6, S5, S4, Note 5, 4, 3, J3, J7, E5 and Grand Prime. Yes, it’s possible Samsung will soon welcome handhelds from rival OEMs on its rapidly-growing mobile payment platform , as long as they’re synched up to brand-new Frontier or Classic wearables .\nUnfortunately, the rumor is far from officially confirmed at the moment, and we’re also extremely light on specifics and timetables. But we truly, madly, deeply want to believe.\nThe post Samsung Pay on Gear S3 smartwatch could work with ‘other’ Android phones appeared first on Pocketnow .\n",

      "title": "Suppliers say Trump’s promise of US-made Apple products impractical, as company points to US jobs",
      "text": "Reddit \nA piece in the WSJ outlines why president-elect Trump’s campaign promise to ‘get Apple to start making their computers and their iPhones on our land, not in China’ is impractical. \nTim Cook has previously said that the vocational skills needed for Apple manufacturing simply don’t exist in the USA, and suppliers have emphasised the sheer scale of the challenge. When Jabil Circuit, the world’s third-largest contract manufacturer by revenue, needed to quickly ramp up production of its electronics components a few years ago, the company was able to add 35,000 workers in China in less than six weeks. “In no other country can you scale up so quickly,” said John Dulchinos, vice president of digital manufacturing.” \nEven if Apple were to appoint American companies as suppliers, that wouldn’t necessarily create U.S. jobs, argues the piece … U.S. electronics companies often outsource production, so they don’t always have full control over where their goods are made [and] s ome manufacturing jobs done in China with human labor could be lost to machines if production moves back to the U.S., economists warn. \nAlthough it’s widely assumed that Apple manufactures products in China to save money, an analysis earlier this year showed that moving production to the USA wouldn’t actually cost dramatically more, adding only $30-40 to the cost of an iPhone, for example. The issue is availability of the right skills. \nApple said that it generates large-scale employment in the USA. Apple said it has created over 2 million jobs in the U.S. for engineers, retail and call-center employees and delivery drivers. The company said it works with more than 8,000 suppliers in the U.S. and is “investing heavily in American jobs and innovation.” \nThis is not the first time this week that the practicality of Trump’s campaign promises regarding Chinese manufacturing have been questioned. On Monday, the Chinese government warned that iPhone sales ‘ will suffer ‘ if Trump goes ahead with his threatened imposition of 45% tariffs on Chinese imports.",

      "text": "Apple reportedly conducted large scale removal of apps in October Gaming category was worst hit with removal of apps on App Store Apple had informed developers about scrutinising its App Store \nA new report shows that Apple has started getting rid of unwanted and abandoned apps from its App Store, as promised in September. The Cupertino-based giant had previously announced that it would remove outdated apps in order to scrutinise its App Store. \nApple had in September specified that if it will find an app to be outdated, no longer functioning as intended, or violating review guidelines, it would be removed from the App Store. \nAccording to app intelligence company Sensor Tower , Apple has removed 47,300 apps from the App Store in the month of October alone. The data revealed that app removals increased by 238 percent in October and mobile gaming category saw most omissions. The data from Sensor Tower claims that app removals were increased by up to 3.4 times higher than the monthly average of 14,000 apps removed between the periods January through September this year. \nAs announced earlier, Apple ahead of removal of apps had sent out emails to developers informing them that the App Store was being scrutinised for unwanted apps. \nAs per data, out of 47,300 apps almost 28 percent were gaming apps that were removed. The other categories which saw removal of apps were Entertainment, Books, Education, and Lifestyle. The Entertainment and Books categories saw 8.99 percent and 8.96 percent respectively while the Education and Lifestyle categories saw about 7 percent and 6 percent respectively. \nTechCrunch points out that Apple's initial deadline for developers to fix their apps was September 7 2016 though the company gave them additional time. \nApple in its directions to developers before large-scale removal of apps had mentioned that if an app crashed on launch, the company would remove it immediately. However, for other apps, Apple can give developers a 30-day time period to fix the issue. During that time, Apple will remove the apps from the App Store momentarily, and only restore them once it finds the apps up to mark.",

However, KGI has reported on multiple occasions that Apple will likely switch the glass-and-metal iPhone frame with an all-glass design next year.\nThis is not the first time we've heard a rumor about Apple launching three iPhone models next year. In October, a report claimed the same thing, with a crucial difference: One of the new iPhones, it said, will have a 5-inch screen.\nRumors of Apple switching to an OLED screen for the iPhone are also not new. The company already produces a few gadgets with an OLED screen. (The Apple Watch is one, and the Touch Bar on the new MacBook Pro is also an OLED screen.) Some of Apple's competitors, including Samsung, have switched to OLED screens on their flagship phones.",

      "text": "Share \nIts long been known that Android devices aren’t as secure as Apple’s iOS, but a new report revealed that some Android devices could get infiltrated with software that tracks a user’s behavior with their mobile device, including phone calls and text messages, and sends the data to China. \nAccording to the report , the infections were discovered by security firm Kryptowire, which said it could be a potentially serious security risk . The report noted that China-based Shanghai Adups Technology developed the software, which is installed on an unknown amount of Android-based devices. The information stolen, which also includes contact lists, call logs and other sensitive personal information, is sent automatically to Adups every 72 hours, noted the report, citing Kryptowire. The software doesn’t stop there either. The report noted the software could be used to remotely install software on the infected devices without the owner even knowing it. In the report, Kryptowire said Adup’s software is running on 700 million devices around the world with most of its clients being small Chinese device markers. It also counts some large Chinese manufacturers, including ZTE, as customers. \nAdups told Fortune the software was designed for a Chinese manufacturer that wanted all that information on devices to boost its level of customer support. The company said in a statement to The New York Times that it can’t disclose which manufacturer wanted the software. It also declined to say how many Android devices could be affected by the software. One company that was willing to comment was BLU Products, which sells devices in the U.S. via Amazon.com. About 120,000 BLU phones had the software installed on them. \n“BLU Products has identified and has quickly removed a recent security issue caused by a third-party application which had been collecting unauthorized personal data in the form of text messages, call logs and contacts from customers using a limited number of BLU mobile devices,” BLU Products said in a statement, according to the report. “Our customer’s privacy and security are of the upmost (sic) importance and priority. The affected application has since been self-updated and the functionality verified to be no longer collecting or sending this information.”",

Apple thought it would be smarter to make it look more like an actual peach, but users were not having it. \nApple users were outraged and now it looks like the peach is back. Look what our revolt has done. Dang. The ancient Apple emoji — which were never really meant to be seen bigger than 32 × 32 — are redrawn quite well in iOS 10.2!

      "text": "Kidney Stone Remedies from Home! Apple Cider Vinegar Write a review Posted by Nathan (Sacramento, Ca) on 02/12/2010 \nI started passing the umpteenth kidney stone just before Christmas 2009. Pain would vary as it typically does for me. Some days were really painful, and some days less. \nAfter more than a month though of being in a state of constant discomfort and lacking medical insurance, I turned to the internet for home remedies. It was that or go crazy from constant physical (and mental/emotional) discomfort. I tried ACV and to my pleasant surprise noticed an almost immediate decrease in discomfort (after about 30 mins). I started the ACV and water treatment on Tuesday Feb 9, drinking about 4 tablespoons of ACV mixed with water in a coffee mug (filled to the brim with water). I did that once a day, and then on Feb 11 I did it twice because I noticed some more discomfort. I just passed the stone, which is about 5mm. \nDuring this time, I also drank a mixture of water and lemon juice from squeezed lemons. (2 whole lemons squeezed into a large glass of water about twice a day). \nA warning though...ACV is terribly nasty stuff on your tongue, really bitter. Be ready for it! Charlotte, Nc 12/13/2012 \nSuccess in passing stones three times; two in left kidney and one on right. Use one half lemon juiced into one glass of purified water. Ten glasses a day, so a total of the juice of five lemons per day. Do this each day for two weeks. My stones were gone in only three or four days so I have never had to go even a full week on the program. This method is also a preventative. If ACV doesn't work try this. Also make sure to brush teeth after drinking liquid as it will wear away enamel if you do not remove the citric acid. Reply Posted by Patricia@4fast.net (Yreka, California) on 11/22/2009 \nI have been told I have calcium oxilate stones.Will apple cider vinegar disolve the stones and how long will it take to disolve them? How much aple cider vinegar should I consume each time and how often should I do this so as to see the results? I'm in pain!!! Reply Posted by Kristina (Herrin, IL) on 09/29/2009 \nI was hurting for 2 weeks with a stone stuck in my lower left side.i have had them before and was determined to not go to that hospital again. I was reading about the man that took a couple oz. apple cider vinegar in a full glass luke warm water and in ten minutes he was better. So i knew it worked on gall stones and wouldnt hurt me, I did it and in 15 min.the pain let up i took a very restful nap woke up in a couple hours and cooked supper. Now i am a little sore when i walk but i bet by tommorrow i will be able to go to the store again.the vinegar relaxes your uranary tract and helps relese that stone,if you take it three times a week it will desolve all your stones, I am told..YEA! DO IT you will be happier. Reply 2 Posted by Krishna (Bloomington, IL) on 10/26/2008 \nApple Cider Vinegar did the trick! I have problems of stone with severe pain, on my left lower side abodmen from 23rd Oct 2008 evening onwards.. wend to the local hospital Emergency Room they prescribed some pain killer like Ibuprofen and also Vicodin... but it aggrevated my Nausea, and there was severe constipation not able to pass the stools.. I found this site.. Yesterday I bought one Heinz Apple Cider Vinegar. yesterday evening around 8:00 I have taken 2 ounce of Apple cider Vinegar and 2 ounce of luke warm water... I had lot of omitting after that and a sever pain again.. I took Lemon Juice and Extra virgin Olive Oil both 2 ounces in the night but by morning my pain stopped. again int he morning I took 3 ounces of APPLE CIDER VINEGAR & equal water... by evening 3:30 pm my 3mm stone came out through the Urine. I was so happy to relieve the pain.. Doctor said he is taking the stone to evaluate and give a diet plan to avoid future stone precipitation in Kidney.. THANK YOU FOR THIS SITE WAS VERY VERY USEFUL AND IMMEDIATE CURE MAY GOD BLESS Stratford, On 09/17/2009 \nhad major pains that continued to build up over the last 2 weeks tried the oil and lemon right before bed...and yes very awful going down!! But by next day most of the pain was gone. So followed it up with the applecider and water with some honey to make it drinkable...again not very good going down...but feeling like a new person today!! Thank you so much!! Kearala, India 04/10/2015 \nKidney stones are very common health problem. They form from the chemicals in urine such phosphorous, calcium and oxalic acid. The other reason is that the excessive use of vitamin D, improper diet, and dehydration. \nThe only simple way to cure the kidney stones is that to drink plenty of water. If you drink 8-10 glasses of water along with the other kinds of fluids daily, the color of your urine will become clear. \nSome of the remedies that can be done from home are: \n1.Lemon juice and Olive oil \nThe combination of olive oil and the lemon juice is traditionally used as a home remedy to expel gallbladder stones, but it is also used to treat the kidney stone complaint. \n2.Apple Cider Vinegar \nIt help[s to dissolve the kidney stones. It is also having alkalizing effect on blood and urine. \n3.Pomegranate \nBoth the seeds and juice in this fruit contains the astringent properties that help in treatment of kidney stones (try to eat the whole pomegranate or drink 1 glass of juice daily.) \n4.Nettle leaf \nThis helps to maintain the flow of water through the kidney and the bladder. \n5.Watermelon \nIt is composed of calcium and magnesium phosphates and carbonates. It helps to treat the kidney stones easily. Reply Posted by David (Grapeland, Texas) on 07/18/2008 \nAfter two weeks of using calimine lotion for a severe posion ivy rash and found little to no releif, I used acv on the same rash that I had on my arms. I was reluctant thinking that it would burn but I was so desperate that I tried a topical application and I got almost instant releif from the itching. With continuous applications several times a day the rash dryed and healed. there wasn't any burning and I found it very soothing. I read somewhere that the Isralites practically lived off of vineger and garlic while in Egypt and where very healthy. David, East Texas \nP.S. I just remembered that I also used acv for dissolving calcification of kidney stones . Suffering two weeks with birthing pains in my back from kidney stones I finally went to the doctor where after x-rays he determined that I did indeed have several small BB sized kidney stones. Of course he wanted to schedule me for surgery go up in me to retreive these stones in a basket type apporatise and $1500.00 later I would be ok. I told my mother and she said she removed hard water deposits from her coffee pot with vinegar. so I took a couple of table spoons of vinegar and within 30 min. to an hour the stones passed. New York, N.y. 08/16/2009 \nI read your response, as I was desperate!!!! Over two thousand dollars later. I went to the store and bought a big bottle of apple cider vinegar, thirty minutes later no pain or discomfort... You would think that the doctors would tell you. Wow and thank you. No More Morphine or Percocet. Amazing! \nthanks again Reply Posted by Peggy (Hanover, Pa) on 02/03/2008 \nI probably have more stones than anyone I have heard of. I produce them almost at the speed of light. I watch my diet, filter my water, ect. Nothing seems to work. I recently started drinking organic apple cider vinegar with water three times a day. Use two tablespoons of vinegar to equal amounts of water. You can add honey if it helps. I noticed the color was different when I passed it. I get about one a week. The pain is just awful. I hope this helps. Hki, FI 05/16/2008 \nA good vegetarian diet that includes nutrients with low protein is also a great way to prevent and dissolve kidney stones. Oakwood, GA 05/31/2009 \nAlso, a good diet of meat and veggies in moderation and little to no fried foods and junk is a great way to live too! But keep up with the ACV! Miami, Fl 08/03/2010 \nI have had them as frequently also and the doctors did a 24 hour urine sample on me discovering my calcium kidney stones were due to lack of Potassium (which Apple Cider Vinegar naturally has!! ). No matter how much calcium I ate, due to the lack of potassium my body wasn't absorbing it. I am now taking 2 teaspoons full of ACV in 8oz of water 3x a day and not only do I not have kidney stones, but I get less premenstrual cramps, my face has cleared up, I have more energy and I just feel better all around :) Livonia, Mi 03/22/2011 \nIf you have a reoccuring problem with kidney stones have your parathyroid hormone levels checked. My doctor just told me that my kidney stones may be a result of a benign parathyroid gland. The parathyroid controls the amount of calcium in the blood and when it malfunctions it strips calcium from the bones and dumps it into the bloodstream where it can collect in the kidneys, heart, gall bladder, etc. There is a whole list of symptoms and information about this disease at www. parathyroid.com/parathyroid-disease.htm \nA simple blood test can determine if you have this and a simple surgery to remove the gland can give you your health back. If your doctor doesn't know about this get another doctor. I'm getting my blood tested next week. Columbus, Oh 07/31/2011 \nI was diagnosed with hyperparathyroidism a few years back. Apparantly one of my four parathyroid glands has been enlarged since I was a teenager (or earlier). The overactive gland instructed my body to pull excess calcium from my bones and put it into my blood stream, thus forming dozen calcium stones into both of my kidneys. At age 38, the doctor finally diagnosed it after years of passing stones. They removed the gland and my calcium levels are normal again; however, I have been passing the calcium stones ever since. My doctor said all the stones are 5mm or less, so they are passable. He said anything over 5mm is not typically passable. \nI'm anxious to try one of these remedies, but I'm confused if ACV is the right remedy for calcium stones. I'll keep reading. Livonia, Mi 01/15/2012 \nTo Kfort of Livonia, MI - Did you have your blood test done? What is the result? Did you have your surgery? We need recommendations of doctor? Will appreciate a reply. Thanks! Reply Posted by Michelle (Kanab, Utah) on 01/30/2007 \nI had a kidney stone and was having a hard time passing it.I started taking apple vinegar cider in red raspberry tea after the second cup almost all my pain was gone. It also helps clear up bladder infections. Thanks Lititz, PA 05/05/2009 \nAfter having surgery 15 years ago for a kidney stone, I was hit with one again yesterday and had almost forgotten the pain that comes with it. After a trip to the hospital to confirm it, I was sent home with a screen funnel and some pain pills. They didn't work, but I remembered using apple cider vinegar the last time. So I took an 8 OZ cup and put two ounces of apple cider vinegar and 5 ounces of cold water. Stirred and chugged it down. The pain stopped within ten minutes and I passed the stone pain free within two hours. I was on the road eleven hours today totally pain free! Reply Posted by John (Hesperia, CA) on 04/26/2006 \nI took Apple Cider to dissolve Gallbalder and kidney stones. I stopped getting kidney infections and can take vitamins again; I had to stop taking vitamins because it increased kidney discomfort. It appears as a side effect that my hair is growing back on my head. Los Angeles, Ca 11/07/2010 \nI drank 4oz straight & it helped my urethra pain. I was able to sleep last night. I also drank 8oz of lemon juice straight. Today tho the pain is mildly back. I will do the same again & drink tons of water. Los Angeles, Ca 04/03/2011 \nI still have not passed my kidney stone that was found back in 8/2010! I have tried everything. I ended up w/ more severe pain yesterday w/ not sleep. Only relief I've gotten is from a heating pad. Oh well...=( Fort Walton Beach, Fl 04/30/2011 \nI was diagnosed with a 5mm kidney stone back in early Feb. 2011 it is now April 30th and I have been in pain for 48hrs now. I am going back to the ER in a little while to see if they can blast the stone. I am gonna try some of these home remedies before I go. Hopefully something eases the pain. My sincerest sympathies go to everyone who has/had/or will have a kidney stone in the future. 12/15/2011 \nFor Drew from FWB., FL \nI too had problems while living in FWB. My experience was when I was about 30 yrs. old. My doctor told me to drink lots of water. This was around 1980 before bottled water was popular. At Eglin AFB., the years of unexploded munitions may have polluted the ground water with phosphorus which should be balanced with calcium in your body. 50/50. I think age, life changes, stress , diet & environment all affect balance. My Dr.too mentioned about the hyperparathyroidism. I never had surgery for that. I am 58 now. Pay attention to your kidneys and not allow to get dehydrated. I was also taking strong vitamins which may have put my kidneys into overdrive and with a love for caffeine did not help the situation. Overworking your kidneys can cause pain like a stone but will subside with water. Infections will cause dark urine and you should watch for that and drink things that are good for you like good water and cranberry juice daily. I have had surgery which I would prevent, rather than go thru that again. When I moved back to Ala., I stopped having stones. It may have been the water but also making needed changes in my life may have also been a factor. (less stress). Good Luck! Hyderabad, Andhrapradesh 08/15/2012 \nBELIEVE ME.. IT IS VERY TRUE... TRY LEMON OLIVE OIL and Drink FRESH AND PURE WATER AS MUCH AS YOU CAN.. IT WORKED FOR MY BROTHER.. HE COULD GET RID OF 6mm URETOR STONE... \nSanthosh Apple Cider Vinegar, Chanca Piedra Posted by J.r. (Newburyport, Massachusetts, Usa) on 02/29/2012 \nGood Evening-Morning; I have had stones for 16 years off and on, yesterday was my seventh time for Lithotripsy hopefully they're gone, famous doctor I had claimed for over a year that I did not have a stone, My new doctor in Boston massachusetts found it lodged in the tubing from the kidney to the bladder, Now I am on cider, I heat it up and put a little pure ginger, little honey and down it goes. This with a tea of Chanca Piedra should help, If not I will be smelling like a salad dressing, For now J.R. Conne River, Newfoundland Canada 04/04/2012 \n2L of coke or pepsi consumed within 2 hrs and a 4 ounce glasses of asparagus juice, if you can keep it all down. Been in pain from a 7mm stone for the past 7 days, as of today it has dissolved, no more pain. Write a review Posted by Lisa (Salt Lake, Utah) on 03/23/2009 \nI have had kidney problems for a while and there're liver issues in my family. So a while ago, I read that someone drink coconut milk to treat their diabetes/kidney problems and it worked. \nSo last week, I didn't have lemon or olive oil in the house, I tried 2 table spoons of ACV and 2 tbls of coconut oil in 16 oz of warm water. I felt fine...I have no scientific proof to back this up but I think it works just the same and it taste better than drinking olive oil, IMHO. \nEC : IMHO = In My Humble Opinion Virginia Beach, Virginia, United States 03/08/2011 \nI have also used Virgin Coconut Oil to cure reoccuring kidney stones along with a multitude of other things, Miracle Oil it is, VCO with it MCT's and Lauric Acid, its almost suprising they haven't made it illegal! Novi, Michigan 06/25/2011 \nMy guess is that the oil is used to protect your mouth, esophagus and stomach. I assume the oil can \"coat\" the surface thus protect them from being harmed by the acid in either the undiluted lemon juice or apple cider vinegar. For example: people with ulcer. So coconut oil may be able to do as good a job as the olive oil. Just IMHO. New Hope, Pa 12/27/2011 \nLike thousands of others, I suffered from very severe pain with kidney stone. From the CT Scan, my doc requested that I should undergo surgery immediately, approx. 6.5mm. \nThanks to this online forum, I adopted all the recommendation from this page: lemon juices, apple cidar vinegar, olive oil, and distilled water. Keep drinking them in combinations all day long for 7 days, using oat meal and organic honey to help relieve bad taste and stomach discomfort. \nDoc also prescibes me pain killer, uniary tract antibotics and flomax to help increase the urine flow. I have no fever all along! \nStone finally passed out on the 7th day morning! When I bring it in for analysis, my doc is amazed by the size and my ability to pass. \nI cannot tell which remedy is the ultimate solution, but the price I paid from taking all these together are so small compared to having to go to the surgery room. \nSince this forum has saved me this Christmas, I just want to share this with the rest! Sincere thanks to the previous posts! Apple Cider Vinegar, Honey Posted by Judi7315 (Nashville, Tn ) on 09/24/2010 \nMy son has had kidney stones by the multitudes for about 4 months, the dr's keep giving him pain killers and sending him home to pass another stone, he has been in constant pain and because he has no insurance and the pain is so bad we turned to the internet. We also talked to someone who suggested Apple Cider Vinegar at 1 oz and 1 oz of natural honey (not processed) the honey contains natural antibiotics to help with infection. We are doing this process 1 time in the morning and 1 time in the evening before bedtime. We have done this 3 days now and so far he has had not pain. Keeping our fingers crossed that the stones are getting smaller or dissolving. Westwood, New Jersey, Usa 09/25/2010 \nIt would be wise for you to search for \"Teds\" cure which works for both Gall Stones & Kidney Stones. Many have had great success with this formula. Bonita Springs, Florida 10/19/2010 \nThank you for the Apple Cider Vinegar and Honey. How is your son doing with the kidney stones? After praying the Lord lead me to this site. I have been having excruciating pain in my kidneys and gallbladder. Don't what it is. I had done the liver flush in shown in this site and lot of stones went out of my gallbladder. I keep getting pain on my right side tremendous pain on my right hip and sciatical nerves. I'm taking the ACV and Honey. I know God uses natural remedies to heal our natural bodies. Write a review Posted by Jdy (Whittier, North Carolina) on 11/15/2016 \nI had one Saturday night. Hit me about 10 pm. Took a pee and at the end it moved into the top of the exit from the bladder. \nNever had no pain with it, until it moved into the top of the urethra. Looked online for answers. Found this site. Dealt with the blockage through Sunday. Went to the store to buy the \"cure.\" I used it a couple of times during Sunday, but went back to store tyo buy a week's supply of apple juice and lemon juice. \nI drinked mostly lemon water with glasses of apple juice. No plain water. I passed it Monday night. Was glad to be able to piss again. All the formula gave me diarrhea like symptoms today. I guess it flushed out both areas. \nFeel like I did 20 years ago now. Nothing can compare to not being able to pee. Glad its over with. I had one last year with severe backache the same size that went through me like butter. This one loged when I was out of water at the end of a pee. \nThey say diet plays a role in repeat symptoms. Lots of meat, milk, cheese and similar food items build up inside the body. Learn to eat correctly to help eliminate the problem. \nEat more vegetables and less meat. Drink juices and clean water over beverages. If you get sick with this, a blockage, try the apple cider vinegar with a ton of apple juice and lemon juice. A prayer helps too! Reply Posted by Chrisf (Surrey, Uk) on 04/01/2016 4 posts \nI researched on your pages a few weeks ago about the use of lemon juice and apple cider vinegar to breakup bladder stones. Well I can tell you this works. I have been troubled by bladder stones previously in 2009 & again in 2010. Both were sorted by Lithotripsy. \nA new event of a stone became troublesome a couple of months ago. Following reading a \"cure\" on these pages I was keen to try it out as the prospect of further Lithotripsy wasn't appealing. \nWell I can tell you the cure worked and I seem to have \"washed out\" all of the stones ( an ultra sound scan in February found two) by dissolving them and expelling them naturally via the waterworks.For a couple of days it was a bit uncomfortable as the residual gravel passed through the system. \nThe dosage and mix I used was as follows: \nTake 1 fresh lemon, cut in half and get the juice out in a squeezer. Remove the pips but keep the residual insides of the lemon. One lemon should give you 2 fl'oz of juice.Add 1 fl'oz of apple cider vinegar, do this with a measuring jug.Top up the mix from 3 fl'oz to 900 ml mark with cold water, stir and pour the mix into two empty 500 ml plastic bottles. \nFor the first week drink both of these every day and you will notice a difference to how you pass water within a couple of days. After the first week you should feel some relief of the symptoms of a stone like I did. By the end of week 3 my symptoms had gone completely. \nI now continue to drink a 500 ml bottle of the mix each day just to keep things clear. \nNote: it is important to use a fresh lemon as the juice is as natural as it comes. Bottled lemon juice is derived from concentrate and includes chemicals and additives. One lemon with produce 2 fl'oz of juice. Reply 4 Posted by Woodie (Bluefield, Wv) on 01/16/2015 \nCan anyone tell me if the ACV and lemon juice remedy, or any of the other kidney stone remedies, will help with Brushite kidney stones? I have read where some of these remedies actually create a better environment for these type of stones to form. Thanks.",

      "title": "Apple and Asian Pear Crumble Pie",
      "text": "Along with pumpkin peanut butter cups, we also served this apple and Asian pear crumble pie. It features all the classic flavors of an apple pie but resembles a cross between pie and cobbler, and this one happens to be dairy-free as well. If you're looking for an easy and delicious pie to serve next week at Thanksgiving, look no further—we got you!\nApple + Asian Pear Crumble Pie, makes one\nFor the crust:\n1 cup all-purpose flour\n1/4 teaspoon salt\n1 teaspoon sugar\n1/2 cup cold nondairy butter (such as Earth Balance)\n1-2 tablespoons cold water\nFor the filling:\n2 granny smith apples\n2 Asian pears\n1/4 cup water\n1/3 cup sugar\n1/3 cup brown sugar\n1/2 teaspoon cinnamon\nFor the crumble top:\n3/4 cup all-purpose flour\n1/3 cup brown sugar\n1 teaspoon cinnamon\n1/4 cup cold nondairy butter\nFirst make the crust. I like to do this a day or two ahead of making the pie. That way the dough has time to chill in the refrigerator, and it's one less thing for me to do on a big cooking day, like Friendsgiving. In a food processor, combine the flour, salt, and sugar. Add the cold butter in a few pieces. I measured mine from the container by scooping with a tablespoon since most nondairy butters I've seen aren't sold in bars like dairy butter. Pulse until the mixture is very crumbly. Add a tablespoon of water and pulse until a dough ball forms. If the mixture is still so dry that it doesn't hold together, add another tablespoon of water. Press into a ball, wrap in plastic wrap, and refrigerate for an hour or up to three days. \nFor the filling, peel and core the apples and pears. Cut into very small cubes. In a large bowl combine with the water, sugars, and cinnamon and toss to combine. Set aside while you roll out the dough. \nLightly grease a pie pan with a little nondairy butter or oil. Roll out the cold dough so that it fills the pan to the edges, then place inside. Use a fork to prick a few holes in the bottom of the crust. \nIn a food processor add the crumble ingredients and pulse until crumbly and combined. I like to press some of the mixture together a bit more just before adding to the pie so I get a few larger crumble pieces. Now add the filling to the pie crust, then top with the crumble top. \nBake at 350°F for 35-40 minutes, until the edges of the crust are golden brown and the crumble top begins to brown as well. \nWe served our pie along with a few different nondairy vanilla ice creams, but you could also top with whipped cream or nothing at all—you pick! Happy pie making! xo. Emma\nCredits // Author: Emma Chapman, Photography: Amber Ulmer. Photos edited with the NEW A Beautiful Mess actions . ",

      "title": "Core Data Just Got Better",
      "text": "Core Data Just Got Better Advertisement \nDuring this year's WWDC, Apple introduced a number of significant improvements to Core Data, taking the framework to the next level. In this article, I'll zoom in on: Persistent Containers Xcode 8 Support and Swift 3 Query Generations 1. Persistent Containers NSPersistentContainer \nSetting up the Core Data stack has always been a bit of a pain. Because it is the first concept developers new to the framework need to become familiar with, the learning curve has always been fairly steep. This is no longer true. \nThe team at Apple introduced a brand new member to the framework, which makes setting up and managing the Core Data stack of your application a breeze. This new member is the NSPersistentContainer class. \nSetting up the Core Data stack is trivial with the NSPersistentContainer class. You can initialize an instance by invoking the init(name:) initializer. The name you pass to the initializer is used by the persistent container to find the data model in the application bundle, and it is also used to name the persistent store of the application. let persistentContainer = NSPersistentContainer(name: \"MyApplication\") \nThe persistent container creates a persistent store coordinator, a managed object model, and a managed object context. It exposes several properties and methods to interact with the Core Data stack. \nYou can access a managed object context that is associated with the main queue of the application through the viewContext property of the NSPersistentContainer instance. As the name implies, this managed object context is meant to be used for any operations that relate to the user interface of the application. \nYou can also access the persistent store coordinator and the managed object model through the persistentStoreCoordinator and managedObjectModel properties. \nIf you need to perform a Core Data operation in the background, you can ask the persistent container for a private managed object context by invoking the newBackgroundContext() factory method. For lightweight operations, you can invoke the performBackgroundTask(_:) method. This method accepts a closure in which you can perform the background operation using a private managed object context. NSPersistentStoreDescription \nApple also introduced the NSPersistentStoreDescription class. It encapsulates the information to create and load a persistent store, such as the location of the persistent store, its configuration, and whether it is a read-only persistent store. \nAdding a persistent store to a persistent store coordinator is much more elegant using the NSPersistentStoreDescription class. The NSPersistentStoreCoordinator class defines a new method, addPersistentStore(with:completionHandler:) , which accepts an NSPersistentStoreDescription instance and a completion handler. // Create Persistent Store Description let persistentStoreDescription = NSPersistentStoreDescription(url: url) // Add Persistent Store to Persistent Store Coordinator persistentContainer.persistentStoreCoordinator.addPersistentStore(with: persistentStoreDescription, completionHandler: { (persistentStoreDescription, error) in if let error = error { print(\"Unable to Add Persistent Store\") print(\"\\(error), \\(error.localizedDescription)\") } else { // Successfully Added Persistent Store } } Xcode 8 and Swift 3 Xcode 8 \nXcode 8 also includes a number of changes that dramatically improve support for Core Data. Xcode now automatically generates NSManagedObject subclasses for every entity of the data model. And instead of adding the files for the subclasses to the project, cluttering up the project, they are added to the Derived Data folder. This means that Xcode can make sure they are updated when the data model changes, and you the developer don't need to worry about the files. \nHow does it work? If you open the data model of your project in Xcode 8 and select an entity, you see a new option in the Data Model Inspector on the right. The Codegen field in the Class section is what interests us. \nAs of Xcode 8.1, the value of this field is automatically set to Class Definition . This means that Xcode generates an NSManagedObject subclass for the selected entity. If you make any changes to the entity, the generated class is automatically updated for you. You don't need to worry about anything. \nYou can disable code generation, or you can instruct Xcode to only generate an extension (Swift) or category (Objective-C) for the class. If you choose the latter option, then you are in charge of creating an NSManagedObject subclass for the entity. Simplifying Core Data \nThe Core Data framework also defines a new protocol, NSFetchedResultsType , which makes working with the framework much easier and more elegant in Swift. This is what it used to take to create a new managed object for the Category entity. if let entity = NSEntityDescription.entity(forEntityName: \"Category\", in: managedObjectContext) { let category = Category(entity: entity, insertInto: managedObjectContext) } \nAs of iOS 10 and macOS 10.12, every NSManagedObject subclass knows what entity it belongs to. category.entity \nThis means we only need to specify in which managed object context the managed object needs to be created. let category = Category(context: managedObjectContext) \nI'm sure you agree that this looks much more elegant and concise. Creating fetch requests is also much easier. Take a look at the example below. let fetchRequest = Category.fetchRequest() \nWhat I am showing you is only a subset of the improvements available in iOS 10, tvOS 10, macOS 10.12, and watchOS 3. There is much more for you to explore. Query Generations \nThe most important announcement is probably the introduction of query generations. Query generations solve a problem that has been plaguing Core Data ever since it was released more than ten years ago. What Problem Does It Solve? \nFaulting is an essential aspect of the framework. It ensures Core Data performs well, and it also keeps the framework's memory footprint low. If you want to learn more about faulting, then I recommend another article I wrote last year . \nEven though faulting works great and is essential for the framework, it can go wrong when a fault can no longer be fulfilled. This scenario can be avoided by deleting inaccessible faults—that is, faults that can no longer be fulfilled. But this is merely a workaround and can lead to unexpected behavior in your application. \nAlternatively, the application can aggressively fetch every piece of data it needs from the persistent store, bypassing faulting. This results in decreased performance and a larger memory footprint. In other words, you disable one of the key features of the framework. \nQuery generations provide another solution that tackles the root of the problem. The idea is simple. The execution is a bit more complicated. What Is It? \nAs of iOS 10 and macOS 10.12, it is possible to assign a query generation to a managed object context. This means that the managed object context interacts with a snapshot of the data stored in the persistent store. Even if other managed object contexts make changes (inserts, deletes, and updates), the snapshot of the managed object context remains unchanged. \nThe upside is that data cannot change from underneath the managed object context. In other words, the managed object context works with a specific generation of data , hence the name query generations. How Does It Work? \nA managed object context has three options to work with query generations. The first option doesn't change anything. The managed object context doesn't pin itself to a query generation. If the data of the persistent store changes, the managed object context needs to deal with that. This is the behavior you are used to, which can lead to inaccessible faults. \nAlternatively, the managed object context can pin itself to a query generation the moment it loads data from the persistent store. As a third option, the managed object context can pin itself to a specific query generation. \nEven though query generations are a more advanced concept of the Core Data framework, they solve a problem anyone working with Core Data faces at some point. The more complex your application, the more serious the problem is. It is great to see that the framework now provides a solution to this problem. Concurrency Improvements \nAs I mentioned earlier, the improvements made to the Core Data framework have been nothing short of amazing. The improvements range from new classes that make working with the framework easier to resolving performance issues at the level of the persistent store coordinator. \nAnother improvement made to the framework relates to concurrency. Even though the persistent store coordinator should not be used on multiple threads, it knows how to lock itself when different managed object contexts access the persistent store coordinator from different threads. If the persistent store coordinator is locked when it is accessed by a managed object context, other managed object contexts need to wait for the lock to be removed before they can access the persistent store coordinator. This can cause performance problems, which can trickle up to the user interface, resulting in decreased performance. \nAs of iOS 10 and macOS 10.12, the persistent store coordinator no longer takes a lock when a managed object context pushes changes to the persistent store coordinator. Instead, the persistent store sends the requests of the persistent store coordinator immediately to the SQL store itself. Instead, the lock is taken at the level of the SQL store. \nThere are several important benefits to this approach. It is no longer necessary to use multiple Core Data stacks to avoid performance issues. This means that the architecture of your application can be simplified dramatically, even for large and complex applications. \nBecause this solution is implemented at the level of the SQL store, it is only available if your application uses a SQLite store as its persistent store. If your application uses multiple persistent stores, then each of these stores needs to be a SQLite store. This feature is enabled by default. Conclusion \nCore Data continues to improve year over year. It is fantastic to see that Apple is committed to making its persistence solution better with every iteration of its platforms. Even though there are alternative solutions available, such as Realm , my preferred choice continues to be Core Data. \nTo learn more about Core Data, check out my Core Data and Swift series here on Envato Tuts+.",

      "text": "After Bendgate , Touch Disease and a few seemingly isolated explosions , the iPhone 6 and 6s might be facing a new, potentially damning controversy. This time in China, where Apple is having enough trouble competing against local budget-focused mobile device manufactures .\nThe China Consumers Association (CCA) has apparently “already made a query with Apple” in light of a “considerable number of users” reporting vexing problems with past-generation iPhones. “Rather many” people are all of a sudden complaining their 6 and 6s-series handhelds won’t turn on after randomly shutting down at 50 – 60 percent battery levels.\nThe devices in question purportedly refuse to function even once plugged in and “continuously” charged, some involuntarily ceasing all their normal operations in “room temperature or colder environments.”\nIt’s unclear whether these iPhone users have taken their gripes to authorized repair centers, and if they did, what was the response of specialized technicians. Since this is the first time we’re hearing of such severe bricking incidents, common sense dictates the root cause could be a recent software update.\nUnfortunately, Apple is yet to address concerns over the inadequate behavior of the “many” iPhone 6 and 6s units reported to the CCA.\nThe post China Consumers Association publicly questions Apple over iPhone 6 and 6s bricking appeared first on Pocketnow .\n",

      "text": "Hedge fund Greenlight Capital has cut its stake in Apple ( AAPL ) as the company faces concerns about slowing iPhone demand and what its next big product might be.\nThe hedge fund run by David Einhorn disclosed in a regulatory filing late Monday that it cut its position in Apple by nearly 1.7 million shares during the third quarter.\nApple is still the fund's biggest holding, with almost 5.2 million shares, worth $587 million as of Sept. 30. But Einhorn has been trimming his position in the company. In August, Greenlight revealed that it slashed its stake in Apple by almost 16% to 6.85 million shares during the second quarter.\nApple stock closed up 1.3% at 107.11 on the stock market today . It hit its highest point of the year on Oct. 11 at 118.69. But Apple shares tumbled after the Cupertino, Calif.-based company delivered mixed September-quarter results late last month.\nIBD'S TAKE: Apple stock has a below-average IBD Composite Rating of 42, meaning it has been outperformed by 58% of stocks in key metrics over the last 12 months. There are better stocks for investors to consider now. Check out the IBD feature Stocks Near A Buy Zone .\nApple's core iPhone business has been declining as consumers in the U.S. and developed markets postpone upgrades and it faces greater competition in China and emerging markets from lower-cost Chinese rivals.\nOn Tuesday, Reuters reported that Apple is under scrutiny in China for problems with its iPhone 6 series handsets. The China Consumers Association has asked Apple to investigate \"a considerable number\" of reports by users of iPhone 6 and 6S phones that the devices have been shutting off and cannot be turned back on again, Reuters said.\nMeanwhile, investors are interested in what Apple has planned for new products. Longtime rumors have Apple interested in starting an internet television service and building a self-driving electric car.\nDigital Glasses In View For Apple? On Monday, Bloomberg reported that Apple is exploring the idea of creating digital glasses that show information in the wearer's field of vision. The augmented-reality glasses would connect wirelessly to an iPhone, Bloomberg said.\nApple CEO Tim Cook has expressed an interest in augmented reality technology in recent months. Other companies pursuing AR glasses include Microsoft ( MSFT ), with its HoloLens, and Alphabet ( GOOGL ), with Google Glass.\nApple's last new product category, the Apple Watch smartwatch, has not been a sales driver for the company.\nOn Tuesday, Apple announced the release of a new hardcover book chronicling 20 years of Apple's design, expressed through 450 photographs of past and current Apple products.\nThe book, dedicated to the memory of Apple co-founder and CEO Steve Jobs, is called \"Designed by Apple in California.\" It covers products from 1998's iMac to 2015's Apple Pencil. It comes in two sizes, costing $199 and $299.\nJobs famously eschewed looking back. When he returned to run Apple in 1997, he shut down a company museum and donated the hardware, artifacts and memorabilia to Stanford University .",

Taiwan asks Apple and Google to ditch Uber 0 Share: \nTaiwan wants Google and Apple's help to get rid of the Uber app. Photo by Carl Court, Getty Images \nThe government of Taiwan asked Apple and Google to step into its ongoing dispute with ride-hailing service Uber on Wednesday. \nTaiwanese officials want the two Silicon Valley tech giants to remove Uber from the App Store and Google Play respectively, according to Reuters . It is also seeking the removal of UberEATS, the company's food delivery service, which launched in Taiwan on Tuesday. \nUber operates within Taiwan as a technology company, but the government has said that this is a misrepresentation of its service. It believes that instead Uber should be classified as a transportation company, which would mean it should have been paying more taxes. \nUber has caused many a ruckus around the world as it disrupts existing models and regulations in countries it launches in. The company told Reuters that it is discussing the situation with the Taiwanese authorities and complies by all local regulations. \nUber, Google and Apple did not respond to requests for comment.",

It is also seeking the removal of UberEATS, the company's food delivery service, which launched in Taiwan on Tuesday.\nUber operates within Taiwan as a technology company, but the government has said that this is a misrepresentation of its service. It believes that instead Uber should be classified as a transportation company, which would mean it should have been paying more taxes.\nUber has caused many a ruckus around the world as it disrupts existing models and regulations in countries it launches in. The company told Reuters that it is discussing the situation with the Taiwanese authorities and complies by all local regulations.\nUber, Google and Apple did not respond to requests for comment.",

      "text": "Apple Restores Butt-Like Peach Emoji in iOS 10.2 Beta 3 Posted by Killian Bell   \nMany iOS users weren’t happy that Apple altered the peach emoji in iOS 10.2 beta 1 to make it look less like a butt. But following complaints, its original look has been restored in iOS 10.2 beta 3, which first rolled out to developers on Monday . \nApple has been tweaking the designs of most of its emoji characters in recent iOS releases, adding detail that makes them look a little sharper. Almost all of the food emojis have been changed in iOS 10.2, but there’s one users weren’t happy with. \nThat’s the peach, which despite being a fruit, was often used to represent a butt due to its shape. Apple tried to change that in iOS 10.2 beta 1 to make it look more rounded, and less like a rear end, but the company’s has reversed the change in iOS 10.2 beta 3. \nApple has improved the emoji’s color a bit, and added a little more detail. But the new peach emoji is almost identical to the original again — as you can see in the comparison below from MacRumors. \n“It’s an insignificant change, but the reversion of the peach emoji to its original state suggests Apple listens to and takes into account the feedback of its users, even when it comes to small details,” MacRumors adds.",

      "text": "– A + Apple's MacBook Pro Touch Bar currently lets users scrub through YouTube ads By Roger Fingas\nWednesday, November 16, 2016, 06:31 am PT (09:31 am ET)\nIn Safari, the Touch Bar on Apple's new MacBook Pro can currently be used to scrub through YouTube videos —including normally unskippable 30-second pre-roll ads, owners have discovered.\nThe unintentional feature was highlighted by a number of posters on Reddit. It may be tapping into Safari's built-in HTML5 video player, which doesn't normally appear onscreen when watching YouTube.\nScrub bars are one of the new possibilities presented by the Touch Bar, which replaces the Pro's previous function key setup with a multitouch display that adapts to each running app.\nGoogle and/or Apple will presumably begin working on a way of suppressing the ad-skipping feature, since the former and many video creators are dependent on YouTube ad revenues. Those parties are already coping with browser-based ad blockers.\nThe first MacBook Pros with Touch Bars began arriving on doorsteps earlier this week, and are only just beginning to hit Apple's own stores . Fresh online orders are being shipped in 4 to 5 weeks.",

      "text": "Markets Today Apple Job Ads Hint at a Risk to Intel, says Exane BNP A flood of Apple wanted ads for CPU and GPU designers suggests the company may be assembling a team to design inhouse chips for its MacBooks. Nov16,20169:52AMEST \nIs Apple ( AAPL ) tooling up to create a custom chips for its next generation of MacBooks? \nAnalysts at Exane BNP Paribas think it might be, after they noticed a surge in Apple job advertisements for the sort of people needed to create an in-house central processing unit, or CPU, and or graphics processing unit, GPU. \nApple is advertising 87 hardware engineering graphics roles, including 10 in London, according to Exane. A quick search of Apple's website found 62 of those roles, including eight in Apple's Hanover Street office in London. \n\"The graphics job vacancies suggest that Apple is building a completely new chip design team, which in our experience points to a new application,\" Exane analysts David O'Conner and Jerome Ramel wrote in a note published Wednesday. \"The need for computing, CPU and/or GPU skills could point to a custom Apple chip for the Apple MacBook. it is entirely plausible that Apple could produce a beefed up 7mm apps processor...capable of powering a MacBook in 2018\" That could be bad news for Intel ( INTC ) . \nThe Mountain View, Calif.-based chipmaker currently supplies much of the computing power for Apples laptops. Intel's Core i5 CPUs are included in the 2016 iteration of the MacBook Pro, while Intel's Iris chips are the GPU for the 13 inch versions of the laptops. An Apple-designed CPU could cost Intel between 3% and 6% of its earnings per share in 2017, according to Exane BNP. Prev 0 of 2 Next If you liked this article you might like",

      "text": "64 shares \nTaiwan is currently in the midst of a war with the ever-controversial ridesharing service. In a nutshell, the dispute is over taxes. According to Reuters , Uber has classified itself as a technology company rather than a transportation provider, which has had the effect of lowering its tax bill within the country. \nThe Taiwanese authorities believe that this is a mis-representation of its service, and wants the company to pay back-taxes. Watch Live \nIn an unusual step, the Government of Taiwan intends to ask Apple and Google to remove the Uber app from their respective app stores, for users based in the country. This would also extend to the removal of the UberEATS app, which only just launched in Taiwan. \nAccording to a spokesman for Taiwan’s Directorate General of Highways, which is handling this dispute, “Uber has not done what it says it will do, so we are looking at another way by requesting its apps be removed from Apple and Google (app stores).” \nThis isn’t the first time that Uber has had issues with the local authorities. In 2014, it was banned in Spain after a series of protests by taxi associations. Recent changes to the rules in London have forced the company to open a call center and for its drivers to take an English test, which the company is challenging . In the Netherlands, police actually launched a criminal investigation into its activities. \nBut this is an entirely new tactic. \nIt’s unclear if Google or Apple will acquiesce to the demands of the local government. Even if they did, it’s not certain if it will be effective. \nThere’s going to be million of people who already have the app installed on their phones. And on the Android front, people will be able to circumvent the ban by downloading an APK of the Uber app from unofficial sources.",

      "text": "print Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella Microsoft \nIf 2016 weren't weird enough already, here's something else to add to the notion that the end times are approaching: Microsoft is embracing Google, Apple, Samsung and even the free Linux operating system in ways it never has before. \nHere's the quick rundown of the news, coming out of the Microsoft Connect event for programmers: Microsoft will be joining the Linux Foundation, which oversees the development of the very popular free operating system Linux. Microsoft spent much of the '90s fiercely competing with Linux , seeing it as a threat to the dominance of Windows, so this is a notable deal. Microsoft is also releasing a public preview edition of its previously-announced SQL Server database product for Linux . Google is joining the steering committe of the .NET Foundation, the independent nonprofit that Microsoft set up in 2014 to oversee the community around the .NET Programming Framework, its very popular set of technologies for building software, particularly software for businesses and for the web. Samsung is working with Microsoft to let programmers use .NET to develop apps for Tizen operating system, popular on Samsung smart TVs and other gadgets made by the South Korean company. Last, but not least, Microsoft will be releasing a version of Visual Studio for Apple's Macs . Microsoft accidentally revealed this news earlier this week when it published a blog entry ahead of schedule. \nJulia Liuson, Microsoft's corporate VP of the developer division, says ever since the company embraced open source technologies and a more partner-friendly attitude , it's been winning over converts who may otherwise never have looked at Microsoft products. \n\"We're really finding fans everywhere,\" Liuson says. \nMicrosoft Executive VP of Cloud and Enterprise Scott Guthrie Microsoft \nFor instance, she says, a team at Google is using Visual Studio Code, Microsoft's free lightweight code editor, to build the Chrome browser. That's gives Microsoft some major brownie points, given Google's reputation as one of the arbiters of cool in Silicon Valley's programmer scene. \nWhich brings us back around to that veritable mountain of announcements. The whole point is to take Microsoft's improving image in the developer world, and solidify it by making some lasting, formal partnerships. 'Better than the picture' \nAnother Google example: Liuson says the team behind the Google Cloud platform kept reaching out to Microsoft with questions about .NET, because their own customers wanted to use it to build their software. Now, Google is officially helping steer the future of .NET, ideally making it better for customers of both companies. \n\"We're really building one of the biggest and the most robust ecosystems,\" says Liuson. \nSimilarly, for the last few years, Microsoft has loved trotting out a picture of Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella proclaiming his love for the Linux operating system. It's the first image in this article. \nWhile Linux never caught on as a proper competitor to Windows or Mac on PCs, it's the operating system of choice for many millions of servers in the world, and Microsoft supports it in its Azure cloud to great enthusiasm. \nXamarin co-founder Miguel de Icaza on stage at Microsoft Build in 2014 Xamarin \nNow, by signing on as a member of the Linux Foundation, it just proves to the world that its love is real, which has the nice benefit of helping Microsoft prove to developers that Azure is committed to supporting Linux. \n\"We have something better than the picture,\" Liuson says. \nAlong those lines, Visual Studio for Mac — based heavily on the Xamarin Studio product, which Microsoft got in its purchase of Xamarin earlier this year — is a play to appeal to those many programmers who mainly code on their Macs, but might benefit from some Microsoft technologies. \nThe bottom line is, Microsoft is showing a willingness to work with competitors and their platforms if it makes developers, still the company's most important customers, happy. When those customers are happy, they spend more time on Microsoft's playground. And with these announcements, they're committing to fair play. \n\"The excitement is real,\" Liuson says.",

Toms matches every pair of shoes purchased with a pair of new shoes given to a child in need, and this approach will apply to the company's newest product as well: for every Toms for Apple Watch band purchased, the company says it will help provide one year of solar light to an individual in need. With a look inspired by founder Blake Mycoskie's friendship bracelets, the bands are available in two styles and several colorways priced from $49 to $75. A Utility Collection features a more classic style with leather detailing while the Artisan Collection features a woven fabric and takes its inspiration from founder Blake Mycoskie's friendship bracelets. The company has partnered with Solar Sister and Solar Aid with the goal of ensuring that individuals have access to safe, reliable light sources. Toms for Apple Watch bands can be purchased at toms.com and in Toms retail stores in the US. Reblog",

      "text": "Reddit \nApple’s new AirPods appear to take totally wireless earphones one step further than any competitor so far, but we can’t be too sure just yet because of the delayed release and impending launch. AirPods were originally set to release in late October, then Apple said it needed ‘a little more time’ to ensure they’re ready for customers. \nWe’re now moving past the iPhone 7 launch and into the holiday shopping season with no set launch date for AirPods, but there are a few guesses at just when we should expect to buy Apple’s new wireless earbuds … \nThe latest guess comes from a Czech Republic retailer Alza.cz which lands on the optimistic side and expects AirPods to ship before the end of the year. The online listing for AirPods states that the retailer expects AirPods to ship in December 2016, which could see AirPods released before Christmas Day. \nAs ever, take the rumor with a huge grain of salt as online listings are a lot like throwing darts at a dartboard and seeing where they land. A more conservative prediction comes by way of the Chinese supply chain , which expects production to kick off only in time for a January 2017 launch. \nThe most optimistic yet has been from a European retailer that German Apple blog apfelpage.de discovered, which believes AirPods could go on sale as early as tomorrow. So the most recent predictions include tomorrow, next month, and next year … \nWhen AirPods are ready for launch, Apple’s wireless earbuds will promise up to 5 hours battery life on a single charge and power back up through a rechargeable carrying case that promises up to 24 hours of extra battery life. A quick 15-minute charge will power AirPods up for 3 more hours. \nAirPods work over Bluetooth and feature Apple’s new W1 chip for instant pairing with Apple devices and easy switching between iCloud devices. The wireless earphones will retail for $159, just $10 more than the upcoming BeatsX Bluetooth earbuds (no word on their release date beyond this fall) that connect via a neckband and also include the W1 chip. \nEarly reviews of pre-production AirPods have been mixed, noting convenient access to Siri, mediocre sound quality, and missing volume controls. \nYou can read 9to5Mac ‘s AirPods guide for more details including reviews of competing totally wireless earphones already on the market – and stay tuned for more details on AirPods and their eventual launch.

So people flipped out.\nApparently the concept of a coffee table book escapes many people. You see, high-end coffee table books are a thing. People like them. Subjects span a wide range of topics, from fashion and art to cars, history, motorcycles, dogs, architecture, guns, landscapes, boats, photography and just about anything else you can think of. Look, here's a coffee table book on fashion that costs $2,000. Here's one about the Indianapolis 500 for $250. Here's a book about Africa  that's being sold for between $1,900 and $4,000... used. Get it? People have coffee tables and apparently, they enjoy adorning them with big fancy books. Hey, whatever floats your boat, right?\nMost of us will never buy Apple's book for $300. Most of us won't buy the smaller version for $200. In fact, most of us have no desire to purchase either version of the book at any price. We can still appreciate the book though, and a bunch of photos from \" Designed by Apple in California \" have been posted online.\nContinue reading... \nTrending right now: \nChina is investigating an iPhone problem just days after indirectly threatening Apple NES Classic Edition review: A box of nostalgia Sam’s Club full Black Friday 2016 ad leaked: Here are the best deals ",

      "text": "I own a MacBook Pro. It’s the last Apple device in my possession. This comes after owning MacBook Pros for as long as I could afford them through multiple side jobs during college. I’m an owner of an entry in the line since the mid-2000s.\nAs someone who works in games, I obviously have a gaming PC that I built. That’s not possible with Macs, of course. I have an Android phone and a Pebble watch (which I adore).\nI used to own an iPhone, but that’s gone by the wayside as alternatives offer more power for less money. The new MacBook Pros ? They’ve just about killed whatever love I had left for Apple.\nBefore we get into this, I’m no authority. I’m a consumer who writes primarily about games, nerdery and sometimes science for TechnoBuffalo . My focus has never been mobile, though I’ve dabbled in the topic. I’m also not one to pledge my allegiance to any given brand; that is, I tend to go with what I think meets my needs for the best price.\nBefore today’s line of MacBook Pros, I was okay with the high price. MacBook Pros are expensive. They always have been. You could always get more for less with the PC offerings out there, though those notebooks have always lacked Apple’s flare for style.\nI always picked up the 13-inch model with the mid-range of internal storage. I’d spend somewhere around $1,200 to get it home. Then I’d hit the internet for RAM and upgrade the memory myself, typically doubling what Apple was selling in store. That might cost me $50-75, while Apple tried to do it for $100-$200 more.\nMy MacBook Pros typically last me somewhere between four and five years before the battery life and system specs perform so much worse than what’s available that I go out and upgrade to the new MacBook Pro line.\nI will totally admit that I was paying more than I had to with the MacBook Pros; but, I always felt like the time I spent with the machine and its look and features made it a joy to use for that expense. It was pricey, but I was okay with that.\nI currently own an early 2015 MacBook Pro. I paid around $1,200 or $1,300 for it. The basic specs are as follows.\n2.7 GHz Intel Core i5 8 GB RAM 128GB SSD (paltry, right?) I made sacrifices with this machine just to keep it affordable. I bought the MacBook Pro because I was used to the brand, and I appreciated its reliability. It’s been good to me over the last nearly two years, and I intend to keep it for a while.\nAs I look at the specs I have here and how much I need to spend to keep going with Apple and the MacBook Pro when it’s time to upgrade? Forget it.\nMy Early 2015 MacBook Pro cost me, let’s go high, around $1,300. Cool? How much will I pay to reach those specs with the MacBook Pro with Touch Bar?\nSee full gallery on TechnoBuffalo Well, the cheapest version is $1,799. I get more storage and a faster processor. The RAM specs are basically the same. That’s a $500 price increase, though, and those specs don’t feel like they should be $500 more.\nRight, the Touch Bar. The cheapest MacBook Pro without the Touch Bar is $1,499. That’s $200 more than I paid and the thing has specs too similar to what I have today, with double the meager hard drive space. I don’t think the upgraded specs are worth a $200 hike two years after my model arrived.\nIf I want the Touch Bar (which I absolutely do not), I’ll pay $500 more than what I paid in early 2015.\nThe MacBook Pro with Touch Bar isn’t for pros, and it isn’t for me. The Touch Bar is “neat,” I suppose, but it feels like a glorified replacement for shortcuts that most “pros” already know. It doesn’t belong on a pro line of computers, at least not in my mind. Pros are comfortable with moving through menus and using function keys to operate. Pros care more about function and the ability to work quickly and efficiently.\nNow let’s consider what I’m actually losing if I “upgrade.” I’m losing the stuff “pros” care about. USB ports? Gone. SD card reader (which I use regularly)? Gone. Headphone jack? Wait a minute, wrong Apple product, that’s still there. But don’t worry, I’ll get “ all day battery life ” at 10 hours.\nMaybe they lost all concept of time out in Cupertino, but 10 hours doesn’t a full day make. 10 hours is less than half a day.\nThen there’s the word that I can’t even crack the thing open to upgrade any of it. Are you kidding me? I can’t upgrade the storage capacity of the machine?\n256GB feels small today. That’s how much I’ll get with the MacBook Pro’s base entry. Imagine how small 256GB will seem in 2018 when the world of 4K video is taking over? Forget it.\nFor me, Apple started to lose me as a consumer when they dropped their old iPhone connectors and kept with a proprietary format with the Lightning cable. Every single move since then stinks of anti-consumer in my mind. It’s becoming increasingly difficult to own just one Apple product without buying 15,000 dongles and adapters to support it.\nI’m out, Apple. Your stuff’s too expensive, and the price isn’t even justifiable anymore.",

      "text": "The MacBook Pro’s Touchy Feely Thing I check out Apple’s faster, thinner, louder notebook with the Multi-Touch strip on the keyboard. And Phil Schiller helps me decode it. I didn’t ask Apple for a Touch Bar. No one did. Yet here it is, perched on top of the keyboard of the new MacBook Pro, like a strand of Technicolor ribbon. Clearly, Apple ascribes to the school of innovation that says great products come only when you produce stuff that your users never imagined. But why a Touch Bar, and is it really valuable?\nFor months now, I have been staring at a tiny whirling beach ball on my screen, thinking, “When is Apple coming out with the next generation notebook— thinner, lighter, more powerful? — so I can replace this?” Hundreds of thousands of others share my plight: The current generation of the MacBook Pro, known as the Retina model, appeared in 2012.\nApple hopes to answer our prayers with this generation. It is thinner than the MacBook Air, weighs virtually the same (for the 13\" models, 3.02 pounds compared to the Air’s 2.96), and is much faster. More powerful speakers than the previous Pro make it a svelte boombox. The screen pops with an intense gamut of color.\nIt’s also more expensive than the Retina Pros: $1,500 for a stripped down version without the Touch Bar, $1,700 for the flagship 13\" screen Touch Bar model, and configurations for the 15\" version that rise well north of $2,500. For many current users, the priciness might flip that now to later . And with its all-in approach to the newfangled, speedier Thunderbolt 3 (USB-C) connectors — which won’t work with current peripherals unless you purchase the proper “dongles” — the new MacBook Pro embraces the future so lustily that you might experience coitus interruptus with the present.\nBut really, this otherwise evolutionary computer will be defined by the Touch Bar. We all knew that the new version of the MacBook Pro was going to be more powerful and easier to carry around. It’s no surprise that it looks great. Space grey is definitely the new black, or at least the new aluminum. (One pleasant bonus — the Apple logo on the lid no longer lights up, sparing you from serving as a glowing advertisement for the Cupertino computer maker.) What we did not know, at least until the inevitable leaks began spouting, was that there would be an interactive display strip where function keys once lived. Now we have to figure out if we like it.\nI’ve been bellying up to the Touch Bar for over a week now, but before I render a verdict, I’d like to situate this feature in the Apple universe. As I wrote a few days after launch, the coincidental introduction of the new MacBook Pro a day after the Microsoft unveiled its Surface Studio  — a behemoth with a 28-inch touch screen — led a lot of commentators to charge that the historically unimaginative plodders from Redmond had out-innovated the flashy cool kids in Cupertino. How can Apple’s quarter-inch strip of OLED on a keyboard compare to a Microsoft’s whole frigging table ’ s- worth of touch goodness?\nCertainly some Apple fans are restless. Based on the cost of the MacBook Pro and the need to buy a basket of deplorable dongles to mediate between devices and Thunderbolt 3, they are taking to social media to express doubts and—in some cases—apostasy.\nFortunately, I do not have to make guesses at what’s going on in Apple’s mind. Perhaps motivated by the grumbling in rainbow-fruit land, Apple’s SVP of worldwide marketing Phil Schiller came to the phone last week to decode the company’s motivations, and stridently counter the cavils of the doubters.\nTo understand the Touch Bar, it’s helpful to revisit a conversation I had with Schiller a year ago, upon the introduction of a new iteration of the iMac. Replying to my query as to why Apple did not, as some expected, give the iMac a touch screen, Schiller laid out to me what would be known as the Grand Unified Theory of Apple Hardware. The philosophy is best understood, he told me, by visualizing the various devices Apple sells on a horizontal plane, like the famous illustration of Darwinian human evolution. Only in this case, the series doesn’t represent a progression, but rather a taxonomy of ideal forms, a Cupertino World Order in which the interface for each is perfectly suited for the function and form of each device.\n“Watch, iPhone, iPad, Macbook, iMac,” he said. “They really are all computers. Each one is offering customers something unique and each one is made with a simple form that perhaps is eternal. People in the industry may question them — we don’t, for some very simple reasons.”\nSeen in that context, making the Macintosh screen—even just on the laptop—touch-centric is a crime against nature, as it violates the functionality intrinsic to the form of a notebook or desktop computer, at least as Apple sees it. Indeed, last week, Schiller was even more emphatic when that subject came up.\n“We think of the whole platform,” he says. “If we were to do Multi-Touch on the screen of the notebook, that wouldn’t be enough — then the desktop wouldn’t work that way.” And touch on the desktop, he says, would be a disaster. “Can you imagine a 27-inch iMac where you have to reach over the air to try to touch and do things? That becomes absurd.” He also explains that such a move would mean totally redesigning the menu bar for fingers, in a way that would ruin the experience for those using pointer devices like the touch or mouse. “You can’t optimize for both,” he says. “It’s the lowest common denominator thinking.”\nApple came to this conclusion by testing if touch screens made sense on the Mac. “Our instincts were that it didn't, but, what the heck, we could be wrong—so our teams worked on that for a number of times over the years,” says Schiller. “We’ve absolutely come away with the belief that it isn't the right thing to do. Our instincts were correct.”\nOn the other hand, he notes, Multi-Touch has already found it way onto the Mac platform, as gestures used on the iPhone — pinch, twirl, swipe — have migrated to the touch pad. The Touch Bar is an extension of that movement of making the Macintosh “a part-time touch experience.”\nA big fat target for that transformation was the function key row, which was just sitting there largely unused. (Though the appearance of the Touch Bar has revealed a suddenly vocal population, mainly of programmers, passionately devoted to the escape key.). For a number of years, Schiller says, engineers at Apple have been figuring out how to colonize that function row territory with touch technology. It was a way to make Mac a touch experience without toppling the Grand Unified Theory. “This notebook design has been with us for 25 years and that fills a need for many people,” he says. “Having an interactive place where your hands are down on the keyboard is celebrating what makes a notebook a great notebook.”\nWhen I suggested that this might be only the latest in a number of mobile innovations moving to the Mac, in an overall annexation of the Macintosh platform, Schiller pushed back, hard. “Its implementation is pure Mac,” he said. “The thought and vision from the very beginning was not at all, ‘How do we put iOS in the Mac?’ It was entirely, ‘How to you use the [iOS] technology to make a better Mac experience?’”\nWhile I had Schiller, I asked him what Apple made of the furor over the MacBook Pro’s switch to the new Thunderbolt USB-C connectors, without including even one retro port so that people could use their current devices without using a dongle. Schiller sees this as a non-issue. Apple is building this device for the future, he says, and in five years the nascent USB-C technology will be in its prime.\nFurthermore, with its speed and versatility (a big advantage is that you can use any of these ports for video, charging, and pretty much anything you’d ever do by connecting with a computer), USB-C is right for now. As far as dongles, he claims that most people won’t need them. For the small number of people that do, ones are available. (Apple, obviously sensitive to the issue, recently cut dongle prices on its store.) “We’re absolutely more sure than ever that we’ve done the right thing.”\nAnd how about the charge that Apple has lost its innovative edge?\nSchiller disputes that, too. “We work hard on these things, and they are the best,” he says. “We care about the feedback but we know that the fundamental difference on where their opinions are coming is between those who had a chance to use it and those who haven’t. There are people who want us to innovate faster and when we do there’s people who say, ‘Whoa, whoa, you’re going too fast.’ That’s just a balance in the world.”\nIn the case of the MacBook Pro specifically, Schiller thinks that pushback is natural, particularly before people have had a chance to try it.\n“There’s always something for a critic to beat up on anybody’s notebook, because you have to make choices,” he says. “I know our team made very smart choices and this is the best notebook that can be made with the greatest technology.”\nSo what is it like to use the Touch Bar? First of all, it looks great: a strip of arcade-bright fettuccine. The high resolution, especially when it displays color, is a delightful contrast to the doggedly steampunk preserve of a physical keyboard.\nFrom the get-go, the Touch Bar begins earning its keep by the inclusion of a fingerprint sensor on its right edge that allows Touch ID. (It’s also the power button.) Unlike the case with the iPhone sensor, where you essentially have to train multiple fingers (because you grip a phone in a lot of different angles), a laptop only needs a single finger — obviously, the index finger — to unlock the screen or make an Apple Pay purchase. For us sloppy typists who commonly have to peck out our passwords multiple times in a row, dozens of times a day, this alone might be worth the cost of the Touch Bar.\nThe Touch Bar can be an alternative to remembering a keyboard shortcut to open an app, or a much easier way of performing intuitive tasks such as scrolling through photos or fast-forwarding a QuickTime video. It’s at its best when choosing emojis, which does away with the awkward task of pulling up the choices on screen by letting you invoke a chorus line of cartoony icons. If you don’t see the one you like, you call in the next troupe by poking the proper category.\nPerhaps the most powerful function of the keyboard is a feature originally introduced on the iPhone to make up for the difficulty of typing on its tiny screen: one-touch suggestions of the word Apple guesses you’d like to type next.\nAt first I had difficulty using that shortcut: Slipping a finger toward what used to be a function key row to choose a word screwed up my orientation to the standard part of the keyboard, and interrupted my typing flow. Ultimately, I got a little better at it. But then, I found that if I got into a mode of looking at the next word Apple suggested, I wound up making choices determined by the company’s machine learning algorithms as opposed to the supposedly clever original language I am paid to craft. (For instance, in the above paragraph, the word “powerful” popped up when I was mentally searching for the right adjective. Done!)\nFor the immediate future, there will be only a limited number of applications that fully use the Touch Bar (Apple’s own, of course, and some key ones including Microsoft Office and Photoshop). Developers are free to use Apple’s API’s to make their products Touch Bar friendly (if they adhere to Apple’s rules the text suggestions should work already), but how many do that will depend on the size of the MacBook Pro’s user base. Another key variable is whether web services will be able make use of the bar. Schiller says only, “There is opportunity for that.” As for now, the Touch Bar pushes you to use Apple’s own browser, Safari. Writing this review now on the Medium online platform, I get word suggestions when using Safari, but not on Chrome.\nOverall, the experience made me wonder whether the Touch Bar is a step toward Apple’s rejection of a physical keyboard. After all, the default Touch Bar configuration has an icon to invoke Siri, and you can add a button to instantly trigger voice dictation. Will we ever see a notebook where Apple shows the “courage” (to use Schiller’s term when the iPhone 7 ditched the headphone jack) get rid of those physical keys, which are, after all, are greasy relics of the industrial age?\n“It’s certainly not on the horizon right now,” Schiller says. “We do want to add those experiences that you are talking about — talking to talk to Siri, voice dictation, suggestions. Although for us right now, there’s no reason to make that trade off. Instead, we focused on not removing the keyboard but making a better keyboard.” Got that?\nThere are other things to say about the MacBook Pro —for instance, it’s nice that the speakers are more muscular. And, despite Schiller’s claim that only a minority of users should care, it will be a constant annoyance that those high-speed USB-C ports need those unlovely dongles to connect with your current printers, flash drives, SD-cards, Ethernet, displays, and yes, even the iPhone introduced last month .\nBut you know what? It doesn’t really make much of a difference. Reports are that people are snapping it up , with online sales the highest ever for a notebook.\nI know I will, even if it’s a couple hundred dollars more than my ideal price. And I will indeed choose a Macbook Pro with the Touch Bar, if only for the fingerprint sensor. I am still not totally convinced that this innovation — and yes, I will call it that — is really transformative, and not just a cool way to save a few seconds here and there. If developers don’t take the trouble to integrate it with their applications, or if Apple doesn’t figure out how to get it to work with web services, there’s always the danger that Touch Bar will be remembered not as a breakthrough but as a relic, a medium-difficult item in a future game of Tech Jeopardy.\nBut, hell, I’m sick of watching the spinning ball on my six-year-old MacBook Air. I’ve already bought my first dongle.",

      "title": "Apple makes 2016 MacBook Pro harder to repair -- but what do you expect?",
      "text": "Tweet \nApple is obsessed with making its products smaller and lighter -- and this shows with the latest-generation MacBook Pro. Both the 13-inch and 15-inch models are more portable than their predecessors, making the prosumer line a much better choice for road warriors. But, knowing that Apple does not always give without taking away, what is the catch? \nWell, in the quest to improve the new MacBook Pro line, Apple has made them harder to repair and upgrade. The company is not renowned for making laptops that are easy to service, but with the 2016 MacBook Pro line it is taking things to the next level. \nAccording to iFixit, which has taken apart both the standard (referred to as the \"Escape Edition\") and Touch Bar-enabled 13.3-inch MacBook Pro models, you cannot change the SSD anymore or replace certain components without breaking them first. \nThe SSD is now part of the logic board, which no doubts aids in making the 2016 MacBook Pros thinner and lighter. This means that if you believe that you will need more storage down the road it is probably best to shell out for a storage upgrade before pulling the trigger on one. \nIt also means that if it fails, for whatever reason, you will have to replace the whole logic board, which, as MacBook users know, is not cheap. You can be looking at an eye-watering bill, unless your situation is covered by the warranty or accidental damage insurance. \nI do not think many MacBook owners have gone through the hassle of upgrading the SSD, so this is unlikely to affect the vast majority of prospective buyers. But, what is more problematic is the repairability aspect, which is worse on the Touch Bar models than on the \"Escape Edition\". \n\"Our efforts to separate the OLED panel from the upper case resulted in the digitizer separating from the display. You live and you learn\", says iFixit. \"Adding insult to injury, the Touch Bar flex cable is routed underneath the upper case, making removal just a tad bit more annoying than we expected\". \nThe iFixit report also notes that \"the Touch ID sensor doubles as the power switch, and is paired with the T1 chip on the logic board. Fixing a broken power switch may require help from Apple, or a new logic board\". This shouldn't probably surprise us, because Apple does not like it when you mess with Touch ID . And, for good reasons. \nBoth the standard and Touch Bar 2016 MacBook Pros have in common a \"very solidly, glued into the case\" battery assembly, which makes it much harder to replace the battery. These things start to lose capacity after a while, and it looks like a fix may involve a trip to a repair shop. \nUnsurprisingly, Apple's design has led the iFixit team to give its 2016 MacBook Pro laptops a one out of 10 repairability score. That is the lowest that a device can get. Does this matter? Probably not. \nConsumers and prosumers who are eyeing a 2016 MacBook Pro likely have a different set of priorities in mind than repairability and upgradeability. Despite my criticisms , Apple will manage to sell a ton of these, because, quite frankly, the latest-generation MacBook Pro line is very appealing in that segment and very hard to beat if you are already living an Apple lifestyle.",

      "text": "Taiwan to ask Google and Apple for Uber's removal from their app stores Taiwan to ask Google and Apple for Uber's removal from their app stores Posted: Tags : Apps - Apps + Uber and the Taiwanese government have been in an intense Mexican standoff situation for quite some time now. On one side, we have the rides app, which presents itself as an internet-based tech platform, and on the other we have Taiwanese officials, claiming Uber is a transportation service.The legal battle is, as everyone probably guessed, a matter of money. Uber was not required to pay sales taxes until recently, since it operated as an Internet platform. However, the Taiwanese government is overhauling its tax laws and it's trying to force Uber to pay back what it saved in taxes since the start of its Taiwan operation in 2013. According to local medias, the sum could be $6.4 million, which would explain why Uber would risk getting booted off the island, instead of just paying up.And, if you ask Uber, it's all peachy. The company recently said that it communicates with the government and obeys all laws, so its business in Taiwan is completely legitimate. But the government has a different opinion on the matter. “Uber has not done what it says it will do,” a Taiwanese official said for Reuters. “So we are looking at another way by requesting its apps to be removed from Apple [App Store] and Google [Play]” .Either way, it appears that officials on the island are not going to back down, so we will have to wait and see how this progresses in the near future.",

      "text": "\nApple stays in a strong, multi-year uptrend. \nLevels closer to support can be used to make hefty returns. \nBull call spread is one options strategy that may benefit investors. Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) has erased almost all the gains from the Sept-Oct period when it leapt from $102-$118. The stock, under consistent selling pressure, closed yesterday's session at $105.71 on worries that the U.S. President-elect Donald Trump will impose a 45% tariff on goods from China. The U.S. President has been extremely critical and negative of China, calling it \"the single greatest currency manipulator that's ever been on this planet.\" On the threat of a 45% tariff on imports from China, Chinese daily Global Times in a striking, hard-hitting article said, \nTo impose a 45 percent tariff on imports from China is merely campaign rhetoric. The greatest authority a US president has is to impose tariffs of up to 15 percent for 150 days on all imported goods and the limit can only be broken on the condition that the country is declared to be in a state of emergency. Other than that, a US president can only demand a tariff increase on individual commodities. Is Mr. President listening? Will he go on the offensive? China is a key market for Apple. Substantially all the company's hardware products are currently manufactured in China. (Hypothetically) Imposing a 45 percent tariff on the iPhone will make it extremely expensive for the fans, and will likely dent the sales. iPhone sales represent the major chunk of the company's revenues, and therefore, the fears over an import tariff under the Trump administration is weighing on the stock. However, I believe that the bottom is close, and that it may even be the beginning of a mega rally in the stock. The reasons behind this belief are purely technical in nature. As one can see from the daily Apple price chart below, the stock has slumped to the very crucial technical metric - the 200-day simple moving average around $104. Click to enlarge Source: TradingView The reason why I believe Apple may be significantly higher in the next 2-3 years is based on the 7-year strong trend in the stock. The 2008-recession forced the stock to forfeit all the gains accumulated in 2007-08. After 2009, the stock began on a strong upward march and continues to respect it till date. Click to enlarge Source: TradingView The trend has been clearly marked in the chart above. The support for this trend now comes slightly above $90. One interesting observation is the stock's relationship with the 12-month SMA. When the stock trades above it, it continues to respect the average as an important support. Most of the time in the last 7 years, the stock has traded above this average. We have seen the stock drop below this average in late 2012, only to witness a stronger rally in the next couple of years. The stock again dropped below this moving average in 2015, broke above it decisively just in September, and is currently retesting it. The action mirrors the development of 2013-14. Please check out the above monthly chart closely. The current 12-month SMA is $103.3408. If Trump were to really go ahead, and possibly impose at least a 15 percent tariff on imports from China, Apple may break below this support and fall to the $90-$95 range as described in the chart above. If the tariff is debilitating to Apple, the stock can be expected to pierce the multi-year trend, and would bring Nasdaq (NASDAQ: QQQ ) down as well. Up until now, while Apple has declined, Nasdaq has done well to stay perched near the all-time top. But, with the leading weight in Nasdaq, Apple will be burdensome on the technology index. Nasdaq's multi-year strong support is pretty deep at 4500. Click to enlarge Source: TradingView Even amid all this confusion and fear, the market currently sees Apple earning more in earnings per share in the next couple of years. According to WSJ , FY 2017 earnings estimates are for $9 per share, while for FY 2018, these are $10.04 per share. These earnings should easily lift the stock higher in the coming 2-3 years. As can be seen below, Apple's forward P/E ratio has been capped near 14.50 for the past two years. Assuming this relationship holds for the next year as well, we can easily expect Apple to trade in a maximum range of $145 - $150 (= 14.50 x $10.04). The forward earnings for the next year will be FY 2018's earnings. Click to enlarge Apple investors can position themselves attractively for potential future gains using a very simple options strategy, Bull Call Spread . This strategy is most helpful to those participants who are bullish on the stock and are willing to dedicate at least a year for returns. The primary thesis behind recommending this strategy is to improve an investor's income substantially while Apple continues to trade in the multi-year range. The strategy has meaningfully higher reward-risk ratios and like all the other strategies, has risks to consider. I will discuss this strategy in detail in the simplest possible manner to appeal to those who are new to options. A bull call strategy requires an investor to buy a lower strike price call option of the underlying while simultaneously selling a higher strike price call option. The expiration date of these options should be same. How To Implement A Bull Call Spread On Apple? Apple, being in a strong uptrend, is a solid candidate for a bull call spread just like General Electric (NYSE: GE ). At the last close of $105.71, the stock was taking support from the 200-day SMA as well as the 12-month SMA - both important levels for the stock. Although levels closer to $95 would be a lot safer, the stock is not risky at the current level to implement this strategy. The two call options that an investor can consider are $110 strike price and $140 strike price call options expiring on November 17, 2017. The $110 strike price call option last traded for $8.50, and has a 53 percent probability of expiring worthless as can be seen from the latest data below. \"Expiring worthless\" implies that this option will go to 0 on the expiration date. Click to enlarge Source: StockOptionsChannel.com The other option that an investor can consider should depend on the higher price range he is expecting on the expiration date. I expect Apple to trade no higher than $140 on the expiration day i.e. roughly 1 year from now. This is based on the P/E (forward) calculations done above. From the current level, it would mean an upside of 33.33 percent. The beauty of this strategy is that even if I am wrong on my target price, and the stock shoots off higher, I am not going to incur any loss. Allow me to explain. First, an investor bought the $110 call option for $8.50. This means a cash outflow of $8.50. He also sells the $140 call option for $1.48 (assuming last traded price), which means a cash inflow of $1.48. For easier understanding, the net investment in this strategy is ($8.50) + $1.50 = ($7). Click to enlarge Source: StockOptionsChannel.com The maximum payoff of this strategy will come if the stock closes at the higher strike price i.e. $140 or above, on the expiration day. If it closes at $140, the $140 shorted call option will go to 0, while the $110 call option will have an intrinsic value of $30. The intrinsic value is the difference between the underlying security's price and the strike price. In essence, a $7 investment in this strategy can yield $30 in the next 1 year. This is more than 4x the initial investment - a massive gain in such a short period. In order to recoup all the money (sans commissions and fees), the stock must close at $117 on the expiration date since the lower strike price call will then have an intrinsic value of $7. Risks To This Strategy Since this is a bullish strategy, a sharp fall in the stock price will be detrimental to the returns and may bring in losses. Therefore, it is imperative that the investor chooses to implement this strategy closer to the support levels while maintaining strict stop-losses. Any close below the multi-year support trendline on the monthly price chart should propel the investors to cut down their long positions. The massive return discussed above is contingent on Apple closing at or above $140 on November 17, 2017. If the stock falls short of this target, the returns will be lower. Since this is a limited-risk strategy, an investor does not have to be too worried about losing too much capital. His investment will go to 0 if the stock is at $110 (lower strike price) or lower on the expiration day. If the stock closes at $115, he will lose just $2. Therefore, the return potential is enormous compared to the risks involved. This strategy may not appeal to investors who hold Apple purely for its dividend and capital appreciation. For them, a buy on dips strategy is best applicable with a longer-term period. Important Points To Consider For the sake of a simpler presentation, I have deliberately omitted the fees and commissions part. One should definitely contact his broker for the charges involved with such a transaction. An investor is free to choose different strike prices and different expiration dates. An intelligent way is to choose the two call options closest to the stock's support and resistance levels. Since it is incredibly hard to exactly calculate the time frame for the desired results, one can choose a slightly longer period. Options 'premiums' or values involve a time component, so with longer periods, the options become expensive. A broker might also charge more commissions in such a case. Conclusion Apple is in a strong uptrend which makes it a perfect candidate for a bull call spread, a limited-risk options strategy which offers significant return potential. It would be only better if the strategy is exercised closer to strong support levels as that would improve the chances of a rebound. The risks discussed above should be taken into consideration, and placing and abiding by a strict stop loss is quintessential. Investors can choose different strike prices for call options, based on their calculations of target price, and also take the longer period. But, they must make sure to consult their brokers before implementing this strategy.

      "text": "Digital glasses probably on the horizon for Apple. \nSuggests to me the company is getting desperate for product line success outside of iPhone. \nGlasses will probably use augmented reality (AR) tech, not virtual reality. \nWhy Google Glass failed. \nClick to enlarge \nsource: Rocket Dock \nWith almost two-thirds of Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL ) revenue coming from the iPhone, and sales dropping, particularly in China, the company has been struggling to produce a new hit product that can carry some of the revenue and earnings weight of the company in the years ahead. \nSome reports say Apple is looking to get into the digital glasses market, using augmented reality (AR) tech. The difference between augmented reality and virtual reality is augmented reality adds digital data or images while the person is still able to see the real world. Virtual reality, on the other hand, creates an environment not connected to the real world, and which surrounds the user of the tech. \nThe same challenges that faced Google Glass (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) will have to be overcome to make digital glasses even viable, assuming there is a market for the wearable tech beyond the usual geeks which buy up almost anything new to try out. \nGoogle's major struggle was the need to develop a small battery that wouldn't weigh heavily on the face of the user, while at the same time generating enough battery life to not have to quickly recharge it. Google wasn't able to accomplish it, which alone with what consumers considered a weak visual design and privacy issues resulted in the product failing miserably. \nAll of this may be true, but my thought is consumers really aren't that keen on another wearable product after watches and other gadgets have in general not captured the imaginations of consumers. There's a market for wearable tech, but not at the level it would be a game changer for Apple or other large tech companies, even though Tim Cook said he believes there's a lot of potential with this market. \nEven if a strong product was developed, I'm not sure it would result in moving the revenue and earnings needle of Apple very much. Since I don't think the market for this would be huge, under the best case scenario it would only be another small gadget to add to the other Apple gadgets that struggle to generate the type of revenue the company needs to complement its iPhone product category. \nKeep in mind I'm talking about digital glasses using augmented reality tech, not virtual reality tech, which I think over time has a lot of potential to grow those companies successfully employing it and finding numerous consumer and business uses for it. \nChallenge to move beyond over-reliance on iPhone performance \nThere's nothing wrong with developing a powerful product line like the iPhone and riding it for a long time. The problem with that strategy and approach is the performance of Apple will live and die on iPhone sales, and when they underperform, it has a strong impact on the share price of the company. \nThat has been the case over the last several quarters. And with growth prospects depending on its performance in China, Apple has disappointed shareholders as it has failed to differentiate enough to produce enough enthusiasm from Chinese consumers to justify its higher price. \nAccounting for two-thirds of the company's overall sales, it obviously means the total of its remaining product portfolio combined only generates one-third of Apple's revenue. This is a huge problem if its iPhone sales in China continue to slide. \nIs Apple getting desperate? \nThose following Apple for a period of time know the company can quickly change direction and abandon a product, so it's not a surety it will go forward with its digital glass project. I think what will happen is it will develop a couple of products and test the wind of consumer opinion at that time to see if it even wants to try to market them. \nUnless there's a high probability of it being a big hit, it's doubtful Apple will move ahead because it will generate the perception it was desperate to get a product out there because iPhone sales are failing to meet sales and revenue expectations. \nThis is of course the problem Apple faces with every new idea pointing to an eventual product release. There are simply not enough tries at this time to make a meaningful impact on the top and bottom lines of the company. \nMy thought is Apple should try to release a plethora of products built to target smaller markets. It won't get the big headlines the company is used to with iPhone, but the thought it can find something suitable to complement its giant smartphone brand is losing credibility. \nI do believe Apple is getting desperate for another big hit, and that may be a problem as it searches for another giant win, when in fact its best strategy should probably be to win with many more products serving smaller but loyal consumers. \nThe problem to me is Apple has failed with some of its less visible products, which when accompanied by disappointing iPhone sales in China has combined to give the justifiable impression it is losing some of its mojo. \nAR digital glasses \nIn its last conference call with analysts, Tim Cook had this to say about AR glasses: \n\"AR can be really great, and we have been and continue to invest a lot in this. We are high on AR for the long run. We think there are great things for customers and a great commercial opportunity.\" \nTo me this is only more optimistic rhetoric with little to back it up. As I mentioned, I'm not convinced consumers are interested in yet another wearable gadget to go along with numerous others they carry or wear. What added value would these digital glasses have for a consumer or business other than just another toy to play with? As I said earlier, almost any tech gadget will be embraced by the geek crowd, but that isn't enough to make it a winner for a company the size of Apple. \nWhat data would be added to AR glasses that can't already be accessed with another gadget? What would digital glasses add to the existing experience that would loosen up consumers' pocket books? \nThe other challenge for this market is for Apple or any company for that matter to develop the type of micro-technology needed to make them suitable for consumers to wear without feeling heavy on their faces. \nWith a questionable market, the effort to do so may not be worth the costs and time. \nConclusion \nI don't mind that Apple is pursuing this market from an investor standpoint, but I think the company will have to decide to pursue a variety of smaller products and markets to generate enthusiasm and revenue for the company. \nEven if iPhone sales were to do better in China, its recent failures to gain significant market share because of strong competition has revealed the weakness in relying upon one product for the bulk of the company's revenue. \nIt's not that Apple doesn't understand this, it obviously does. The problem I think is it isn't releasing enough smaller products to boost sales while at the same time seeing if the potential market for it is larger than projected. If a product isn't out there, it can't be adapted to consumer response and made better. \nApple management should announce a change in strategy. It should tell consumers it is going to pursue a number of different market segments and provide different products in each one. I'm talking here beyond the existing product lines it already has. \nWhile giant projects are interesting, the vast majority of them never get off the ground, and if they do, are failures most of the time. But when throwing out many smaller products, the company can fail quicker and get a handle on what has the most potential. \nShareholders and investors would be less concerned about the performance of its smartphone line, and look to many ways the company could grow. \nThat's not to say the company shouldn't continue to go after markets with larger potential. Only that as it goes forward it can't only look for home runs at the expense of a bunch of singles and doubles. \nIf AR glasses were to find a market, I would consider it a single at its highest potential. It's obvious to see the disappointment the market would have to that, as it's always looking for an Apple home run. But if it was able to hit a couple of more singles on a consistent basis, it would push the company forward. It would move slowly at first, but would gain momentum as it gained traction from multiple new revenue sources. \nAs it is, the company, overall, continues to incrementally improve existing product lines, which even there it has failed to capture the imagination of consumers, bringing down growing disappointment in what the company has to offer. \nBut when introducing new products, there is nothing from the past to compare it with, and it usually generates more positive feedback in what consumers would better like out of the product. I think this is where Apple needs to direct its money and efforts, not on single products that are very unlikely to be big hits, even if they sell moderately for the tech giant.

      "text": "What Apple would have to do to comply with Donald Trump's American-built mandate By Thursday, January 21, 2016, 09:34 am PT (12:34 pm ET) President-elect Donald Trump has pushed a protectionist proposal that could to force Apple \"to build their damn computers and things in this country.\" It's a suggestion that has been outright dismissed by most observers —but should it be? Worker prepares iPhone for final assembly. | Source: Apple Supplier Responsibility Report Editor's note: This article was originally published by AppleInsider in January when Trump was a Republican candidate for president. It has been updated and republished to reflect his election. Trump's campaign promise is based in part on the imposition of a 35 percent tariff on products manufactured overseas. This would, he believes, give companies a significant economic incentive to bring manufacturing jobs back to the U.S. There are more than a few holes in this line of reasoning: It would be diplomatically disastrous, and there's no data to suggest that an American manufacturing sector built on a foundation of heavy industry would be nimble enough to take on this kind of challenge at a large scale. Nonetheless, the president does have the power to impose protectionist tariffs, so let's see how Apple could handle it. Before you read on, it's important to note that we're performing a somewhat naive analysis: We're focusing on what essentially constitutes final assembly, and ignoring the very real economies that come from having nearly the entire supply chain around the corner. Cheap labor gets expensive Employee wages are almost always the first factor cited when discussing manufacturing in the developing world. Shenzhen has one of the highest wage floors in China, and its minimum statutory wage clocks in at around ¥2,000 —about $300 per month. That's less than a quarter of what it would cost for an employee working a nominal 160-hour month at Wyoming's $5.15-per-hour minimum wage, the lowest in the U.S. If we assume the fully-loaded cost of a single employee is 1.5 times their salary, that works out to around $1,200 per month. One U.S. employee costs four times as much as a single Chinese employee. Of course, Apple would likely continue to contract with third parties for their hypothetical new U.S. assembly plant —as they've done with Flextronics in the Mac Pro's Texas facility —making them responsible for a smaller portion of employees' compensation. That's still a significant jump, though. So how to solve it? I, for one, welcome our new robot overlords The easiest path forward would be to erase labor costs entirely by building fully-automated factories. They've certainly got the pedigree; Steve Jobs spent exorbitantly to build a robotic factory for NeXT in the company's formative days. Unfortunately, it's not as easy as just calling ABB and ordering a few 'bots. Each robot must be programmed —and in many cases, designed from the ground up —for its specific task, and there are some jobs that still require levels of dexterity that robots simply can't achieve. They're also expensive, with basic off-the-shelf models coming in at $10,000 to $20,000 each and more complex versions running as much as $100,000. Taiwan-based Foxconn is thought to have around 350,000 employees dedicated to iPhone assembly —that's $12.25 billion worth of robots, assuming an average cost of $35,000. Of course, the richest company in the world could afford it, but it wouldn't help much when you consider that many supply chain guesstimators currently peg labor costs at no more than $5 per iPhone. Don't forget that they'll also have to make Macs, iPads, Apple Pencils, Magic Trackpads, and the rest of Apple's product line —which means more robots and more infrastructure. Apple's manufacturing facility in Cork, Ireland So what then? No matter how creative Apple gets in restructuring its manufacturing operations, there's simply no way they could absorb a 35-percent increase in overhead. That cost would be passed on to consumers, making the $649 base-model iPhone $876. And those same consumers would also have less money to spend, because the massive multi-billion dollar investment in industrial robotics will likely have put at least a few more blue collar workers out of a job.

      "text": "34 shares \nApple has been shipping its next-generation MacBook Pro only for a few days, but iFixit has already managed to get its hands on the new 13-inch model with Touch Bar and put it through one of its comprehensive teardowns. \nAs expected, much of the innards of Apple’s flagship laptop have been modified to accomodate the addition of the Touch Bar. The teardown review further reveals the new MacBook Pro is damn near impossible to repair as its battery is glued to the case. This is why iFixit gives it a repairability score of one out of 10. Watch Live \nMuch like the battery, other components such as the processor as well as the SSD storage are soldered straight to the logic board – and so are the RAM sticks. \nAmong other things, the Touch Bar is especially cumbersome to replace and iFixit actually broke the piece during its teardown. \nWhat’s particularly interesting is that the speaker grilles on the side of the keyboard are “seemingly cosmetic.” \nHere’s how iFixit explains this: \nThe speakers are not located under the speaker grilles. The speaker grille doesn’t even go clear through the case. These speakers likely blast their impressive sound through the side air vents. \nAs indicated in the pictures, the location of the speakers is demarcated in orange, while the position of the grilles in red. \nNeedless to say, there are quite a few differences between the standard and the Touch Bar-equipped models. While the standard version leaves some room for upgrades , the Touch Bar model allows for virtually no improvements . \nStill, poor repairability scores are nothing new when it comes to Apple’s laptops. Previously, iFixit gave both the 2013 as well as the 2015 MacBook Pro models with retina display a repairability score of one out of 10. \nHead to iFixit’s full teardown review here for more hardware details and pics from the new MacBook Pro.",

      "title": "The best leather cases for Apple’s iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus",
      "text": "When it comes to cases for the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, there are basically five main approaches. Some people just want the cheapest case they can find, and others want a case with a nice design. Rugged cases offer the best protection, but they also add a tremendous amount of bulk. Then there are ultra-thin cases and slim clear cases, which protect your phone from scuffs and scratches without ruining the iPhone's sleek design. Finally, there are premium cases made out of high-end materials like leather and aluminum. These cases might not preserve the iPhone 7's design exactly, but they often introduce a stylish new design that can be just as good (or even better, depending on who you ask).\nWe've spent months trying out dozens and dozens of different iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus cases. In this post, we'll show you the best leather cases we've come across so far.\nContinue reading... \nTrending right now: \nNES Classic Edition review: A box of nostalgia Best Buy just released an updated Black Friday ad: Here’s what’s new Sam’s Club full Black Friday 2016 ad leaked: Here are the best deals ",

According to Reuters, Uber has classified itself as a technology company rather than a transportation provider, which has had the effect of lowering its tax bill within the country. The Taiwanese authorities believe that this is a mis-representation of its service, and wants the company to pay back-taxes. In an unusual step, the Government of Taiwan intends to ask Apple and Google to remove the Uber app from their respective app stores, for users based in the country.

      "text": "Apple marketing power, inconsistent video purchasing habits confusing Hollywood By Wednesday, November 16, 2016, 08:57 am PT (11:57 am ET) With Apple both throwing its weight around to capture exclusives for video content —and not willing to get in a bidding war with other streaming services for content —Hollywood is said to be beginning to question the company's future intentions as a media venue. Over the last two years, Apple appears to be reinforcing the appearance of video as a \"hobby\" for the company , as famously stated by Apple co-founder Steve Jobs talking about the Apple TV. In the last year, Apple engaged comedian Chris Rock in discussions about exclusive content, according to The Information . Ultimately, Apple walked away from the deal, with two exclusive stand-up shows ending up on Netflix, for $20 million a show. On the other hand, movie deals for iTunes are being pursued more aggressively, with Apple not being afraid to swing its promotional weight around to cap a deal. Apple's discussions with the producers of Michael Moore's \"TrumpLand\" documentary started very early on in production, and Apple sealed the deal with heavy promotion of the feature on the iTunes homepage, according to people familiar with the discussions. Also confusing the issue is Apple's failure to secure a rumored over-the-top programming package for the Apple TV, as well as the all-in approach the company is taking to the \"Planet of the Apps\" reality show, currently in production. Analysts believe that not having a wide array of original programming hurts Apple in the long run by keeping market share low, eliminating syndication broadcast revenues, and giving no reasons for consumers to lock-in to iTunes and Apple TV. However, Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook's saying that Apple was interested in \" content creation and ownership \" in the most recent financial results report fueled speculation that Apple plans to delve further into the media market. Apple is also said to be working on its first-ever scripted series, \"Vital Signs,\" starring company executive Dr. Dre. Furthermore, Apple has also purchased the rights to James Corden's \"Carpool Karaoke\" in July. Topics:",

      "text": "\n\nSerenity Caldwell has been writing and talking about and tinkering with Apple products since she was old enough to double-click. Managing editor of iMore, she hosts a number of popular podcasts and speaks frequently at conferences. In past lives she worked at Macworld and Apple Retail.\n\nIn an age where Macs look more and more like iPhones and iPads, how do you future-proof $2000 laptops?\nI recently purchased a 256GB SSD 13-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar as my latest laptop acquisition — and according to iFixit , there's not much chance I'll be able to upgrade that storage (or much else, really) in the future.\nThe company has given Apple's latest laptop a repairability score of 1/10, citing glued-in batteries and user-hostile casing; for those keeping score, it's the same score given to the last generation of MacBook Pro, and a few points lower than the last-generation MacBook Air (which netted a 4/10).\nReplacement obsolescence I've replaced many a part in my Mac laptops over the decade and a half I've owned them — a dead battery here, swapping a disk drive for SSD there. As a result, many of those laptops have lasted well beyond their AppleCare coverage point: My dad has an old Wall Street that, until very recently, he still used for email in the living room; I have a 2009-era 15-inch MacBook Pro that's still speeding along with a year-old SSD.\nI've loved the thrill of cracking open my laptops and making them better. But it's always come as a bonus to me in my later years of laptop ownership — let's make this thing like new again! — rather than a selling point off the bat.\nAs Apple makes its computers lighter, thinner, and more power-efficient, it's sacrificing that repairability for greater off-the-bat convenience. My new MacBook Pro feels like a solid slab of aluminum in my hands, much like my iPhone: The engineering is hidden, rather than user-accessible.\nBut is the trade-off worth it? I go back and forth.\nPros and cons-umers Removing consumer access to the inner workings of their Macs limits the computer's lifespan: A lithium-ion battery only lasts so many years, and all drives fail eventually. The industry moves forward, and those who can't afford a new laptop every two years can fall behind. It's one thing to pay $700 every two years for a new iPhone; it's quite another to pay upwards of $2000 for a new computer in that same time period.\nOffering users the ability to upgrade their RAM and SSDs used to be a way to combat that growing obsolescence: Make your old computer a little bit faster, let it work a little bit harder, and you don't need next year's model.\nAnd in a vacuum, I worry about the lack of upgradeability in Apple's new Macs leading to computers being replaced faster: People can only afford so much at purchase time, and the \"8GB of RAM is plenty\" mentality could lead to unhappy users two years down the line. It also may lead to more electronic waste as people upgrade more frequently, or users being forced to pay more money over time to fix their computers solely through Apple and Apple-authorized resellers.\nBut here's the thing: Outside the core Mac enthusiast audience, the general population just isn't interested in fixing or upgrading their machines. We have a hard enough time helping our loved ones at Thanksgiving switch to complicated passwords and clearing off their desktop — explaining that you can take apart a computer to make it faster or fix it is often beyond the pale for many users.\nThroughout my college and early work years in Apple Retail, many of my friends and customers insisted on trudging through life with broken laptop screens, missing key caps, or ever-slowing hard drives. When I mentioned that such things could be (with a little bit of work) easily fixed, they'd often shrug and say \"It's not worth it. I'll upgrade eventually.\" My own fiancé uses an old MacBook with a completely shattered screen, but doesn't see the point in fixing it.\nThe laptop of the future We, the computer enthusiasts, balk at computers without replaceable parts. \"What if I need more space? I don't want to pay for Apple's RAM suppliers!\" But it goes over the head of an average user. All they see is a computer that works for them — until it doesn't.\nSo it makes sense to me that Apple would focus its build efforts on sleeker, smarter, more portable machines over repairable machines, and offer recycling programs to keep older Macs from ending up in landfills and give users some monetary value for their old machines. There's another issue to think about here, too: As a computer's inside more and more resembles that of its mobile cousin, part replacement becomes trickier — the last thing Apple (or any company) wants is a customer attempting a battery repair and blowing up their device .\nNo matter our feelings over expensive SSDs and reparability, the future of the Mac is quite likely non-user replaceable. That doesn't mean we should give up fighting for repairable computers — I quite admire folks like iFixit fighting for a user's right to repair their technology , however complicated it's become to do so. But we need to plan for the future.\nWhen buying a laptop, I now look to the computer I want two or three years from now, not the computer I want now. It's not a perfect solution — and often a very expensive one — but it's the decisions you have to make when it comes to extending the life of your new machine.\nThe same goes for things SSDs: I purchased a 256GB hard drive in my MacBook Pro because I largely rely on cloud-based services for my laptop use, but you may not — and you need to decide that for yourself.\nThis tack won't solve issues with glued-in batteries dying just outside the warranty period — that's where fighting for reasonable battery repair rates comes in — but it's at least one possible step in an age where all our devices are becoming more and more compact.\n",

      "text": "iFixit: New MacBook Pros are unsurprisingly difficult to repair and upgrade \nApple is selling two new computers that it's calling MacBook Pros: one model without the new Touch Bar and one model with a Touch Bar. But according to a teardown of the Touch Bar model by iFixit , the differences don't stop there. The Touch Bar has an entirely different motherboard, cooling system, and internal layout. Unfortunately some of those changes make it even more difficult to repair than its cousin . \nThe Touch Bar MacBook Pro has a much larger cooling system than the non-Touch Bar model—it uses two fans instead of one, and the symmetrical and vaguely mustache-shaped logic board wraps around both of them. The odd layout (plus the need to make additional room for extra chips like the Apple T1 and the second Thunderbolt 3 controller) leaves less room for other things, and as a result Apple has soldered the SSD to the motherboard in the Touch Bar MacBook Pros, much as it has in the 12-inch MacBook. \niFixit also found a smaller (albeit still firmly glued-in) battery—something we already knew about from the spec sheet—as well as something odd about the speakers. The speakers don't actually line up with the speaker grilles on either side of the keyboard, and in fact in the Touch Bar MacBook Pro those grilles are entirely cosmetic. Sound is actually routed through the laptop's air vents. \nBecause the SSD and all of the other major system components are soldered to the logic board, and because the Touch Bar is so difficult to remove and replace, the Touch Bar MacBook Pro gets a 1 out of 10 on iFixit's repairability scale, lower than the 2 out of 10 it gave to the $1,499 model. Its glued-in battery and difficult-to-replace display don't help. And as in iDevices, the Touch ID button and the T1 are paired at the factory, so if you replace the button itself or the logic board yourself, the Touch ID sensor will stop working. \niFixit's only positive comments are that the trackpad is fairly easy to replace without taking the rest of the system apart and that the physical USB-C ports are on small daughterboards that can be swapped out without replacing the rest of the logic board, though you will need to remove the logic board to get at them. \nListing image by iFixit Andrew Cunningham Andrew has a B.A. in Classics from Kenyon College and has over five years of experience in IT. His work has appeared on Charge Shot!!! and AnandTech, and he records a weekly book podcast called Overdue . ",

      "text": "Later is a simpler replacement for Apple’s reminders Posted Google   \nIf you tend to turn to email to send yourself short reminders, instead of using a more feature rich to do list or task management application, a new app called Later wants to help. Later aims to offer an alternative to Apple’s sometimes cumbersome Reminders by giving you an easier, faster way to set times to be reminded about upcoming tasks, as well as way to get alerts when you return to your Mac. \nThe idea for the application comes from three friends based in Latvia: Gustavs Cirulis, a designer at Intercom; Andris Fedotovs, an iOS engineer; and Davis Siksnans, the CEO and co-founder of Printful. The three had previously built other apps, including screenshot organizer Inboard , and a Mac utility called Characters . \nAccording to Siksnans, the team also often turned to email as their go-to reminders application of choice, and had grown frustrated. \n“We got tired of sending emails to ourselves to remind of mundane things,” he says. “Alternative apps like Apple’s iCal or Reminders took too many taps to input a simple reminder. We thought there’s got to be a better app.” \nThe end result is Later, which is available both on iOS and Mac. While you can use the apps individually, they’re more powerful when combined. \nThere isn’t an extensive feature list for Later, and that’s by design. \nThe app is very straightforward to use. Upon first launch, you’re presented with a blank page and flashing cursor. Here, you just type in whatever it is you want to be reminded about, hit the checkmark, and you’re then taken to a second screen where you pick a time. \nInstead of the date and time picker, which many of us find tedious to use, the screen offers a variety of time presets as buttons you just tap. For example, there are buttons for “3 Hours Later,” “This Evening,” “Tomorrow Morning,” “Next Week,” and so on. If you absolutely need to set a specific date, however, there’s an option for that, too. \nBut one of the app’s better features is the button that says “On My Mac.” What this means is that if you also have Later’s Mac app installed, you can trigger an alert when you return to your computer. Your reminders will sync between both platforms via iCloud, so you can enter in new items as they pop into your head, no matter if you’re at your desk or out-and-about. \nUnfortunately, you can’t set a Mac reminder to pop up the next time you unlock your phone because that’s not something Apple currently allows, Siksnans says, but the team is thinking about ways to work around that problem – for instance, by using motion tracking, perhaps. \nThe iOS app is free, but the Mac app to complete the solution is a $4.99 download. That’s a launch special discount though – the app will be $9.99 in the future. While the simplicity is what makes Later interesting, people may balk at the higher price point for such a no-frills application. \nThat being said, it’s always refreshing to see apps that understand how to best take advantage of mobile. On-the-go users don’t want to fill out sign-up forms, watch tutorials, or face a steep learning curve just to use what should be a basic utility. Later gets that, by taking you right to the experience. It takes only a few seconds to get going. In fact, the download of the app itself takes longer than creating your first reminder.",

Developed exclusively for United Way of Santa Cruz County , OneEach has leveraged its more than 17 years of providing digital marketing solutions to the nonprofit sector to develop a user-friendly mobile experience that allows secure and fast donations, building a bridge to a new generation of donors. \nIndividuals wishing to download the United Way Santa Cruz County App in the iOS App Store, should visit https://appsto.re/us/csqD8.i . \n\"We are thrilled to be the first United Way to accept contributions with Apple Pay on our mobile app and are confident our donors will find it to be an attractive option,\" said Keisha Frost, associate executive director of United Way of Santa Cruz County. \"Constrained by limited resources, our mobile app developed by OneEach Technologies has already made our lives easier, and more importantly, it has made the lives of those we serve easier.\" \nEarlier this year, OneEach was approached by United Way of Santa Cruz County to develop a mobile app, and the nonprofit soon became an early adopter of mobile engagement. Like numerous other United Ways across the country, they already had a OneEach United Way-branded website. With the incorporation of Apple Pay, United Way of Santa Cruz County is now in an ideal position to use its mobile app not only for engagement, but for providing an easier and more immediate solution for the community to contribute to its cause. \nSeason of Giving According to the National Center for Charitable Statistics (NCCS), giving by individuals makes up the vast majority of contributions by nonprofit organizations. #GivingTuesday on November 29 kicks off what many call the Giving Season, when people focus on their holiday and end-of-year donations. It is estimated that 80 percent of online contributions will be made during the last two months of the year and Apple Pay is now in place to help reach donors whenever or wherever they are. \n\"We're honored to have been selected to help United Way of Santa Cruz County develop United Way's first mobile app with Apple Pay, just in time for the prime donation season,\" said Tony Finneman, co-founder and CEO, OneEach Technologies. \"With its website, outreach through texting and now, app with integrated Apple Pay, the organization is leading the way in digital engagement with its supporters.\" \nAbout OneEach Technologies For non-profit organizations of all sizes seeking to uniquely tell their story with limited resources, OneEach Technologies provides complete digital marketing solutions in a transparent and affordable pricing structure.

      "title": "Apple 13-inch MacBook Pro With Touch Bar Teardown Hits New Low For Repairability And Upgrades",
      "text": "by Brandon Hill — Wednesday, November 16, 2016 Apple 13-inch MacBook Pro With Touch Bar Teardown Hits New Low For Repairability And Upgrades If you were following along two weeks ago, shortly after the launch of the 13-inch MacBook Pro (sans Touch Bar), then you know that Apple has been making it increasingly difficult to repair and upgrade its Macs. Apple’s 13-inch MacBook Pro was mocked for the consolidation of components onto a single logic board and received a 2 out of 10 reparability score from iFixit .\nIt should come as no surprise then that the more expensive 13-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar continues down that same path (and actually goes even further). Delving inside the 13-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar was no different than its lesser sibling — you’ll first need to remove six pentalobe screws, and then slide the bottom panel out to detach it from clips that secure it to the base. \nOnce inside, we see that the Touch Bar -equipped model has two internal cooling fans instead of one and a smaller battery (49 WHr versus 54.5 WHr). Like the lesser model, the massive trackpad is easily removed, and the internal battery can be removed (although you’ll have to fight through a lot of adhesives to achieve your mission). \nOnce you get to the logic board, which wraps around the two internal fans, you’ll find another big change: the SanDisk SSD is no longer removable and is instead soldered directly onto the logic board. So if you were hoping to somehow upgrade your SSD down the road instead of opting for one of Apple’s expensive upgrades, you’re out of luck. \nIt should be noted that while many have lamented the loss of MagSafe (now that Apple has gone to Thunderbolt 3 for power/connectivity), an accidental yank on the power cord — while possibly destructive to the internal ports — doesn’t mean that you’ll have a costly DIY repair (as long as the MacBook doesn’t go flying to the floor). iFixit explains: \nNow that our beloved MagSafe connector has been retired, a wayward step on the power cord is much more likely to damage your ports—so, it's heartening to see the USB-C hardware can be replaced separately (although you'll have to remove the logic board to get to it). \nThe Touch Bar itself, which is a long and thin OLED panel, can be dislodged with a bit of heat and a prying tool. However, complete removal of the panel is made difficult due to the fact that the flex cable routes under the upper case. \nOverall, iFixit didn’t have much good to say about the repairability of the 13-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar and gave it an even lower score than its standard model: a pathetic 1 out of 10 rating.",

      "text": "iFixit \nApple is selling two new computers that it's calling MacBook Pros: one model without the new Touch Bar and one model with a Touch Bar. But according to a teardown of the Touch Bar model by iFixit , the differences don't stop there. The Touch Bar has an entirely different motherboard, cooling system, and internal layout. Unfortunately some of those changes make it even more difficult to repair than its cousin .\nThe Touch Bar MacBook Pro has a much larger cooling system than the non-Touch Bar model—it uses two fans instead of one, and the symmetrical and vaguely mustache-shaped logic board wraps around both of them. The odd layout (plus the need to make additional room for extra chips like the Apple T1 and the second Thunderbolt 3 controller) leaves less room for other things, and as a result Apple has soldered the SSD to the motherboard in the Touch Bar MacBook Pros, much as it has in the 12-inch MacBook.\nRead 4 remaining paragraphs | Comments ",

      "text": "Apple is Still Interested in Original Content, but Remains Cautious in Spending Money Posted by Evan Selleck   \nOriginal content is something that Apple still has an eye on, and is indeed working towards with projects like the upcoming Planet Of The Apps , but the company remains cautious in some areas. \nThe Information reports that Apple is “sending mixed signals to Hollywood,” because the company is reaching out to creators, actors, and other creative types to launch its own, original content, but those steps are still tepid in their range. In one instance, Apple apparently spoke with the well-known comedian and actor, Chris Rock, to try and put something together. However, those talks didn’t go anywhere, according to the report, as Rock ultimately went with Netflix, which apparently led to a two stand-up special deal, worth upwards of $40 million. \nThe report indicates that Apple’s lack of original content is hurting the company’s efforts to expand the Apple TV marketshare, and sees it at a great disadvantage against the likes of Hulu, Netflix, and Amazon — all of which has its own stable of original content, which, in most cases, is quickly expanding on a regular basis. \n“Not having a slate of originals hurts Apple’s ability to differentiate its video-streaming offerings against rivals like Hulu, Netflix and Amazon, each of which now make their own shows that get them lots of attention, while also licensing reruns from TV networks. That could stymie Apple’s ability to increase market share for its streaming video device, the Apple TV, and lock more people into the Apple ecosystem.” \nOn the other side of the coin, Apple is said to be eyeing a bigger push for movies, even if they aren’t Apple’s own, for promotion within the iTunes ecosystem. Specifically, promotional deals for films that will see an earlier release in iTunes, and a later launch on other digital distribution services. One such film was the film TrumpLand by documentarian Michael Moore. The report states that Apple was eyeing an iTunes exclusivity window for that film, in exchange for promoting the film prominently in iTunes: \n“Apple got the right to offer “TrumpLand” on iTunes earlier than other online video services, in exchange for prominently promoting it on the iTunes homepage, according to a person involved in the discussions. Having Apple’s promotional commitment is significant enough to help get a movie financed, this person said.” \nAs it stands right now, based on this report, it seems like Apple is willing to dig into original content when it can, but it is also actively avoiding bidding wars, that could ratchet up the cost for that content, against major competitors. \nApple does have original content on the away, aside form the aforementioned Planet of the Apps . That includes a mock-umentary about artist Dr. Dre entitled Vital Signs , and a new series based on the mega-popular Carpool Karaoke segment from the James Corden-hosted The Late Late Show .",

      "text": "\"This is a book with very few words,\" Apple Chief Design Officer Jony Ive writes in the foreword to \"Designed by Apple in California,\" a new collectible coffee table book by Apple that went on sale on Wednesday. \nHe's right. Besides the foreword, which is relatively short, the book's 300 or so pages are all dedicated to big, beautiful photos of Apple products that came out in the last 20 years, from 1998 to 2015, and of the tools that make them.\nIt seems like a perfect gift for Apple fans this Christmas. The book comes in two sizes, a smaller version that costs $199, and a bigger book — almost too big for a coffee table — that costs $299. \nThe books are likely to be in limited supply. An Apple Store worker in New York City told me that they only got \"like eight\" of each, and another employee said that it seems like Apple wants them to be limited. Only a few stores are selling them right now.\nSo is it worth it for an Apple aficionado? After carefully perusing each page and every photo in the book on Wednesday, I decided not to buy it. I can spend the $200 on way more fun things — like Snapchat's Spectacles, or a discounted Apple Watch. \nHere's why:\nGlossies Kif Leswing/Business Insider The main reason why you would buy Ive's vanity project is because you admire Apple's approach to industrial design and would like to look at pictures of some of the company's iconic products. Online photos don't do the book justice.\nIn that case, the book won't disappoint. \nBut my problem, as an Apple fan, is there is too much in the book that I've seen before. I think a lot of people who follow closely will agree. \nA large percentage of the photos in the book have been seen in one way or another — usually distributed by Apple itself as promotional images when the product came out. There is an argument to be made that these are the  definitive photos of these products. They were all shot by Andrew Zuckerman, a photographer who as worked closely with Apple in the past. \nBut some of the coolest parts of the book are never-before seen process photos, like the drill bits used by Apple to shape its aluminum casings. There's one page that shows how an iPhone shell is drilled out. \nKif Leswing/Business Insider \nThere's also a few cool photos of Apple products after they've been well-used and loved. \nKif Leswing/Business Insider One photo shows how Apple tests the iPhone glass to see in what conditions it would break. It's a fascinating image, but there is no context, just an image. I was left wondering why Apple might do this, what it learned from the test, or what happens when the glass actually breaks.\nThere also are not many photos of the 100s of prototypes Ive's team legendarily creates before deciding on a final form. \nThe book simply does not have enough of this fascinating content — if you're buying it, you're buying it for photos that are very similar to photos that can be downloaded on Apple's press site .\nDesign and form  Kif Leswing/Business Insider There is some precedent for a lush, image-focused book to cost $200 or $300. Louis Vuitton, for example, has a similar lookbook product that costs $845 . Ferrari's book costs thousands of dollars. \nIve's team did the design for the book, and given his focus on detail, his team picked the paper and developed custom inks. \"Of course, many of these products are white, so the off-the-shelf printing processes really didn't do an adequate job in describing the colour and surface of those products. So, unsurprisingly we ended up developing custom forms of paper and custom inks,\" Ive told Wallpaper .\nThe book is printed and bound in china, and uses \"custom low ghost Epple inks\" and 280 line screen printing, according to its appendix.\nIts paper is \"Apple-specific\" Heaven 42 paper made in Germany. James Cropper, a UK company, contributes \"Color Plan, bespoke color.\" The linen on its cover comes from Bamberger Kaliko, in Germany, which is using \"bespoke dye.\" \nHowever, the book itself is not that special. It's nice, sure, but it's not anything groundbreaking or particularly special, especially if you've seen art books before. \nIt's a big book The book seems destined to become an item on a shelf at design academies and art schools, not something that individual Apple consumers would flock to.\nThe book's two sizes are: small (10.20” x 12.75”) and large (13” x 16.25”).\nWhen I first encountered the book, I though the small version was the large version. The large version is big enough that it feels like a reference book. Here are photos, with a quarter for scale.\nSmall: \nKif Leswing/Business Insider \nLarge: \nKif Leswing/Business Insider \nThe main way most people will encounter the large version is as a book in an art library. \n\"Another key point is that the book is being sent to all the major design colleges in the world. We are keen to get it into the hands of young people who are studying design disciplines,\" Ive told Wallpaper.\nIf anything, the book seems like Ive's victory lap, and his attempt at making sure his groundbreaking designs land in the design school canon — not that the canonization of Apple design needed any help. \n\"We attempt to develop forms that achieve an integrity between external surfaces and internal components,\" Ive wrote in the book's foreword. \"Above all, I have come to feel sure that human beings sense care in the same way we sense carelessness. I do think we respond, maybe not consciously, to something much bigger than the object.\"\n\"We hope that this archive is seen as intended: a gentle gathering of some of the products we have designed over the last few years. We hope it brings understanding to how and why they exist,\" Ive wrote. \nNot a complete catalog Kif Leswing/Business Insider It's important to realize that not every Apple product from the last 20 years made it into the book. \"We begin this archive with the translucent iMac of 1998, and we conclude with the Apple Pencil of 2015. We have not included all our work in the interm, only those products that seem significant, that demonstrate learning, or for which we simply have affection,\" Ive wrote. \nThe book does not linger on any one product. It presents a few photos of the item, its internals, and its construction, and moves on to the next one. \nOf course, you might be wondering if your personal favorite Apple product is included. Here's a list of all the products photographed in the book, in chronological order and the order they are presented in the book:\niMac iBook Apple Cinema Display Apple Cinema HD Display Power Mac G4 Cube Apple Cube Speakers Apple Pro Mouse Apple Pro Mouse iSub 2000 Subwoofer Power Mac G4 Titanium PowerBook G4 iPod iMac G4 eMac PowerBook G4 iSight Power Mac G5 Apple Wireless Keyboard iBook G4 45W Power Adapter iPod mini iPod mini Belt Clip iPod mini Lanyard iPod In-Ear Headphones Cinema Display iPod iMac G5 iMac G5 with iSight iPOd Socks iPod shuffle iPod shuffle Sport Case iPod nano iPod Leather Case iPod iPod Hi-Fi MacBook iPod nano iPod shuffle In-Ear Headphones iPhone iPhone Headphones iMac Apple Keyboard iPod nano iPod touch iPod classic MacBook Air iPhone 3G iPod touch LED Cinema Display MacBook Pro iPod shuffle iMac Magic Mouse MacBook iPod nano iPad iPhone 4 iPhone 4 Bumpers Mac mini iPod nano iPod shuffle iPod touch Apple TV Apple Remote MacBook Air iPad 2 iPad 2 Smart Cover MacBook Pro MagSafe Power Adapter Apple EarPods iPod nano iPod touch iMac iPhone 5s iPhone 5s Leather Case iPhone 5c Case iPhone 5c iPad mini iPad mini Smart Cover iPad Air Smart Case Mac Pro iPhone 6 iPhone 6 Plus NOW WATCH: These size comparisons show the true scale of enormous things \n",

Besides the foreword, which is relatively short, the book's 300 or so pages are all dedicated to big, beautiful photos of Apple products that came out in the last 20 years, from 1998 to 2015, and of the tools that make them.\nIt seems like a perfect gift for Apple fans this Christmas. The book comes in two sizes, a smaller version that costs $199, and a bigger book — almost too big for a coffee table — that costs $299.\nThe books are likely to be in limited supply. An Apple Store worker in New York City told me that they only got \"like eight\" of each, and another employee said that it seems like Apple wants them to be limited. Only a few stores are selling them right now.\nSo is it worth it for an Apple aficionado? After carefully perusing each page and every photo in the book on Wednesday, I decided not to buy it. I can spend the $200 on way more fun things — like Snapchat's Spectacles, or a discounted Apple Watch.\nHere's why:\nGlossies Kif Leswing/Business Insider\nThe main reason why you would buy Ive's vanity project is because you admire Apple's approach to industrial design and would like to look at pictures of some of the company's iconic products. Online photos don't do the book justice.\nIn that case, the book won't disappoint.\nBut my problem, as an Apple fan, is there is too much in the book that I've seen before. I think a lot of people who follow closely will agree.\nA large percentage of the photos in the book have been seen in one way or another — usually distributed by Apple itself as promotional images when the product came out. There is an argument to be made that these are the definitive photos of these products. They were all shot by Andrew Zuckerman, a photographer who has worked closely with Apple in the past.\nBut some of the coolest parts of the book are never-before seen process photos, like the drill bits used by Apple to shape its aluminum casings. There's one page that shows how an iPhone shell is drilled out.\nKif Leswing/Business Insider\nThere's also a few cool photos of Apple products after they've been well-used and loved.\nKif Leswing/Business Insider\nOne photo shows how Apple tests the iPhone glass to see in what conditions it would break. It's a fascinating image, but there is no context, just an image. I was left wondering why Apple might do this, what it learned from the test, or what happens when the glass actually breaks.\nThere also are not many photos of the hundreds of prototypes Ive's team legendarily creates before deciding on a final form.\nThe book simply does not have enough of this fascinating content — if you're buying it, you're buying it for photos that are very similar to photos that can be downloaded on Apple's press site .\nDesign and form Kif Leswing/Business Insider\nThere is some precedent for a lush, image-focused book to cost $200 or $300. Louis Vuitton, for example, has a similar lookbook product that costs $845 . Ferrari's book costs thousands of dollars.\nIve's team did the design for the book, and given his focus on detail, his team picked the paper and developed custom inks. \"Of course, many of these products are white, so the off-the-shelf printing processes really didn't do an adequate job in describing the colour and surface of those products. So, unsurprisingly we ended up developing custom forms of paper and custom inks,\" Ive told Wallpaper .\nThe book is printed and bound in China, and uses \"custom low ghost Epple inks\" and 280 line screen printing, according to its appendix.\nIts paper is \"Apple-specific\" Heaven 42 paper made in Germany. James Cropper, a UK company, contributes \"Color Plan, bespoke color.\" The linen on its cover comes from Bamberger Kaliko, in Germany, which is using \"bespoke dye.\"\nHowever, the book itself is not that special. It's nice, sure, but it's not anything groundbreaking or particularly special, especially if you've seen art books before.\nIt's a big book The book seems destined to become an item on a shelf at design academies and art schools, not something that individual Apple consumers would flock to.\nThe book's two sizes are: small (10.20” x 12.75”) and large (13” x 16.25”).\nWhen I first encountered the book, I though the small version was the large version. The large version is big enough that it feels like a reference book. Here are photos, with a quarter for scale.\nSmall:\nKif Leswing/Business Insider\nLarge:\nKif Leswing/Business Insider\nThe main way most people will encounter the large version is as a book in an art library.\n\"Another key point is that the book is being sent to all the major design colleges in the world. We are keen to get it into the hands of young people who are studying design disciplines,\" Ive told Wallpaper.\nIf anything, the book seems like Ive's victory lap, and his attempt at making sure his groundbreaking designs land in the design school canon — not that the canonization of Apple design needed any help.\n\"We attempt to develop forms that achieve an integrity between external surfaces and internal components,\" Ive wrote in the book's foreword. \"Above all, I have come to feel sure that human beings sense care in the same way we sense carelessness. I do think we respond, maybe not consciously, to something much bigger than the object.\"\n\"We hope that this archive is seen as intended: a gentle gathering of some of the products we have designed over the last few years. We hope it brings understanding to how and why they exist,\" Ive wrote.\nNot a complete catalog Kif Leswing/Business Insider\nIt's important to realize that not every Apple product from the last 20 years made it into the book. \"We begin this archive with the translucent iMac of 1998, and we conclude with the Apple Pencil of 2015. We have not included all our work in the interm, only those products that seem significant, that demonstrate learning, or for which we simply have affection,\" Ive wrote.\nThe book does not linger on any one product. It presents a few photos of the item, its internals, and its construction, and moves on to the next one.\nOf course, you might be wondering if your personal favorite Apple product is included.

      "text": "Report: Apple’s video strategy has Hollywood confused By Dan Pye ● 11 minutes ago \nApple recently tried to work out an exclusive video deal with Chris Rock, but walked away from the discussions and let the comedian’s two stand-up specials go to Netflix instead, The Information reports. This latest chapter in Apple’s scattered efforts to acquire exclusive video content has added to the confusion in Hollywood over what types of media Apple has an interest in acquiring. The company has been working aggressively to land movies for iTunes—most recently securing the rights to offer Michael Moore’s “TrumpLand” earlier than other online providers—and has picked up shows like “Carpool Karaoke” that fit into its strategy for promoting Apple Music. But after meeting with TV producers and movie studios about developing original content for iTunes, Eddy Cue was quoted as saying Apple is “not in the business of trying to create TV shows,” adding that the company is more interested in offering suggestions and guidance. Apple is refusing to commit the large sums of money necessary to compete with streaming rivals like Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon, leading analysts to worry the company’s hesitation “could stymie Apple’s ability to increase market share for its streaming video device, the Apple TV, and lock more people into the Apple ecosystem.” [via MacRumors ]",

      "text": "Apple creates device it expects you to use and then replace, but never repair. We know this from the countless teardowns iFixit carries out on iDevices only to find lots of glue, soldered in place components, and a generally hostile environment for anyone venturing inside. And with the launch of the 15-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar late last month, Apple removed the last user-friendly component from the laptop: the SSD.\nThe 13-inch MacBook Pro without the Touch Bar retains the removable SSD seen in earlier models, but the 15-inch Touch Bar model (and we have to assume the 13-inch model , too) replaces it with storage chips soldered to the logic board.\n\nThe change was confirmed by MacRumors reader Jesse D. who was brave enough to unscrew the base of his new MacBook Pro to take a look. Sure enough, he found the logic board cutout where the removable SSD usually sits had gone. The soldered in place chips can be seen in the image above.\nStorage is usually the first component that gets replaced in a laptop, either due to an issue or simply as part of an upgrade. But Apple removes that option completely from Touch Bar models of its laptop. If anything goes wrong with the SSD, the entire logic board will have to be replaced, which won't be cheap.\nThe situation is actually worse than that, though. By soldering the storage to the board, if anything else goes wrong on the logic board you also lose all your data. You can't simply remove the SSD and recover the data anymore.\nBacking up your data on a regular basis is a task everyone should be doing anyway, but if a MacBook Pro with Touch Bar is your next purchase, it becomes absolutely essential.",

      "text": "With Apple now selling used iPhones, the new phone market may have peaked Today, buying a smartphone is a lot like buying a car. Expect Apple to start selling refurbished versions of the iPhone SE —which has a starting price of $399 new — in the $299 range or lower. Vjeran Pavic / The Verge A version of this essay was originally published at Tech.pinions , a website dedicated to informed opinions, insight and perspective on the tech industry. Last week, Apple started selling refurbished iPhones in the U.S. through Apple.com. Of course, wireless customers have long had the opportunity to buy used iPhones (and other brands) from their carriers and other retailers and online sellers. However, the fact that Apple is now offering the devices direct (along with long-available refurbished products such as Macs, iPads and iPods) is notable. It reflects both the maturing nature of the market and Apple’s desire to put the iPhone into the hands of more budget-constrained smartphone buyers while still making enviable margins. The collapse of subsidy models Just a few years ago, the U.S. smartphone market was almost entirely subsidy-driven, which meant that few people actually knew how much a smartphone cost. What they knew was that roughly every two years they could pay $200 to their carrier and get a new smartphone. When U.S. carriers began to move away from the subsidy model, many people were shocked to realize that they were paying upward of $600 or $700 over the lifetime of that phone. As that realization took hold, the market began to bring forward a long list of new financing options. One-year-old phones still retain a great deal of their value, which is why Apple got into the game itself. Today, buying a smartphone is a lot like buying a car. If you’ve got the cash, you can pay for the whole thing up front, or you can pay through an installment plan (essentially a loan), or you can sign up for something very akin to a car lease, in which you pay a monthly fee and get a new phone roughly every year. All of the plans effectively shift the cost of buying a new phone around, but none really help lower the cost. That’s why the refurbished market is important. While there are fewer options when purchasing a refurbished phone (you typically pay all up front), the savings can be substantial. Certified pre-owned luxury phones Back in September 2015, Apple launched its own iPhone Upgrade Plan along with its iPhone 6s lineup, directly competing with its carrier partners. Apple customers could pay a monthly fee (starting at $32 per month), and then, a year later, swap that iPhone for the next one. The iPhones Apple is now selling online are likely among the first batch of phones it collected through that program. Apple is adding significant additional dollars of per-device profit for every phone it first ships out as part of the upgrade program and then reclaims and resells a year later. Companies such as Gazelle have long bought people’s old smartphones, but in the early days, those phones were typically several years old, which meant companies often shipped them to emerging markets, where they were either resold or scrapped for parts. One-year-old phones, on the other hand, still retain a great deal of their value, which is why Apple got into the game itself. In fact, based on IDC’s estimates, Apple is adding significant additional dollars of per-device profit for every phone it first ships out as part of the upgrade program and then reclaims and resells a year later. All the while, it’s also increasing the number of iOS users and bolstering services revenues as a result. So, for example, right now you can buy a 16 gigabyte iPhone 6s for $449, $100 less than the same new model on BestBuy.com (Apple cleverly doesn’t offer a new version of the 6s on its site with the same memory configuration, but a 32GB version of the 6s runs $649 on Apple.com). Similarly, a refurbished 64GB 6s Plus sells for $589, which is $750 new on BestBuy.com. The result: Buyers interested in buying an iPhone now have a wider range of options available to them. The entry-level price for what was Apple’s top-of-the-line phone a little more than a year ago now starts at $449 instead of at $549. Not exactly cheap, but certainly more attainable for somebody who is able to pay the entire cost up front. At some point, I would expect Apple to start selling refurbished versions of the iPhone SE, which has a starting price of $399 new. We could expect prices in the $299 range or lower. Most companies that sell refurbished phones closely inspect those phones before reselling, offering what amounts to a certified pre-owned checklist at a used-car dealer. One of the advantages of buying refurbished from Apple, however, is it not only certifies the phones but it also installs a brand-new battery and outer shell. The new battery piece is huge, as that’s clearly one of the areas of most concern when buying a used device. And by including the new battery (which costs Apple very little), the company ensures that the buyer has a good experience for the life of the product. Who buys used? Techies might not find the idea of buying a used device appealing (they’re likely the ones signing up for the annual refresh and creating the supply of one-year-old phones) but a growing percentage of regular consumers clearly see the value. In a recent IDC survey of U.S. smartphone users, 26 percent said they were “somewhat likely” to buy a well-maintained one-year-old phone if the price were lower; another 14 percent said they were “highly likely” to do so. Among current iPhone owners specifically, those two percentages were 25 percent and 9 percent. While there’s clearly a market for refurbished iPhones here in the U.S., the larger play for Apple long-term is its ability to move refurbished iPhones into markets outside of the country. While there’s clearly a market for refurbished iPhones here in the U.S., the larger play for Apple long-term is its ability to move refurbished iPhones into markets outside of the country. For years, pundits have wondered when Apple would ship an inexpensive iPhone geared toward emerging markets. It seems increasingly clear Apple’s answer is to sell refurbished iPhones instead. It’s a smart plan that will likely work quite well for Apple once it figures out two key issues: Which countries’ consumers are amenable to used products (not all are) and which countries’ regulations will allow refurbs to flow in (not all will). Once Apple sorts these issues out, I expect we will start to see Apple itself promoting refurbished products in more countries, at more prices. At IDC, we’re now closely monitoring the used smartphone market as we firmly believe that growth here could have a significant impact on shipments of new phones in the future. Apple won’t be immune to the potential negative impact of this secondary market. But by creating its own virtuous cycle through its upgrade plans and refurbished offerings, it makes more money now, and better controls its market position down the road.

      "text": "There have been consistent rumors over the last few months that Apple was switching to OLED displays with its 2017 iPhone 8. A new report from KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo says that the iPhone 8 will arrive in three versions, but only one of them will feature OLED screens. The well-connected analyst has an impressive track record of revealing details about Apple’s future products before their launch.\nImage Source: YouTube Only one iPhone 8 model to have OLED display According to the research note (via MacRumors ), the 4.7-inch will have a single-lens camera and TFT-LCD display. The 5.5-inch model will get a dual-camera system and TFT-LCD display. Kuo believes there will be a third variant with an all-new OLED display and dual-camera. You can expect the OLED display iPhone 8 to have an even higher price tag than the standard iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus.\nMing-Chi Kuo did not reveal the screen size of the OLED display variant. But he had said in a previous research note that there would be a 5.8-inch iPhone with a curved OLED screen and all-glass casing. Earlier this week, Barclays analysts also predicted that Apple would launch a 5.8-inch iPhone next year with a curved, bezel-less design.\nDual-camera adoption to jump to 65%-75% next year Since two iPhone 8 versions will feature dual-camera, Kuo believes that dual-camera adoption rate will jump from the current 30%-40% to 65%-75%. KGI Securities has said on several occasions that at least one model of iPhone 8 could feature an all-glass design similar to the iPhone 4. Earlier this month, the research firm revealed that Apple would not launch a successor to the iPhone SE to keep its profit margins high.\nAn OLED display is much thinner and brighter than the LCD panels. OLED screens also have a higher contrast ratio than LCD, but they are a little more difficult to produce. Apple already uses OLED displays on the Apple Watch and for the Touch Bar of the latest MacBook Pro. An executive at Sharp recently indicated that the iPhone 8 would use OLED displays from his company. However, some of the orders are also expected to go to Samsung and LG.\nApple places OLED purchase orders worth $4 billion JPMorgan analysts who analyzed Apple’s latest 10-K filing said that the Cupertino company had placed large orders for OLED screens. The purchase orders extending over a period of one year were worth about $4 billion. In the past, factors like supply availability and cost might have prevented the iPhone maker from using OLED displays in the iPhones, but it’s going to change in 2017.\nThe iPhone 8 is also rumored to get rid of the physical home button. The fingerprint sensor and home functionality are said to be embedded in the display itself.\nThe post Apple To Launch Three Models Of iPhone 8: Analyst appeared first on ValueWalk .\n",

This is a GIF of Apple's Website in the Late 1990s Oh how far we've come November 16, 2016 \nReddit user, ali0044 , has posted an animated GIF that demonstrates Apple.com in the late 1990’s. \nThe GIF demonstrates how detailed Apple was even back then, right around the time Steve Jobs made his triumphant return to Apple. \nIt’s actually pretty cool to see how well-implemented the website was, even during the early days of the web. I’d argue that there weren’t many websites that looked this good, even from other Fortune 500 companies. \nCrazy how far we’ve come. View Comments Copyright 2016 AppAdvice LLC. All rights reserved.

      "text": "You are using an outdated browser. Please upgrade your browser to improve your experience. Don't Expect Original Content On Apple TV, iOS by Bryan M. Wolfe November 16, 2016 \nExpensive, original programming has become a staple for both the Netflix and Amazon Prime video streaming services. Apple’s interest in acquiring original programming has remained luckwarm, at best, according to The Information . \n\"Strange Things,\" Netflix \nSome of the most popular shows on television now air on Netflix and Amazon Prime, including “Stranger Things” and “Good Girls Revolt.” The same can’t be said for Apple, which has shown little interest so far in getting into billion-dollar bidding wars over projects. \nAs a result, Apple’s current slate of original programming isn’t exactly robust. To date, Apple has purchased an unscripted TV series based on James Corden’s highly popular “ Carpool Karaoke ” segment. It’s also planning an original TV series called “ Vital Signs ,” which is based on the life of Beats founder Dr. Dre. \nThe Information suggests that Apple’s apathetic response to original programming could hurt the company in the long run: \nNot having a slate of originals hurts Apple’s ability to differentiate its video-streaming offerings against rivals like Hulu, Netflix and Amazon, each of which now make their own shows that get them lots of attention, while also licensing reruns from TV networks. That could stymie Apple’s ability to increase market share for its streaming video device, the Apple TV, and lock more people into the Apple ecosystem. \nNone of this should come as much of a surprise. \nBack in July , Apple’s Eddy Cue said that his company was “not in the business of trying to create TV shows.” Instead the senior vice president, internet software and services said, “If we see it being complementary to the things we’re doing at Apple Music or if we see it being something that’s innovative on our platform, we may help them and guide them and make suggestions.” \nI don’t think it’s necessary for Apple to buy original programming for Apple TV to succeed. Instead, I hope they continue to grow their recently introduced TV app for tvOS and iOS to include content from all entertainment providers including Netflix and Amazon Prime. \nHow would you like to see Cupertino grow its Apple TV service? \nSee also:",

      "text": "Microsoft \nIf 2016 weren't weird enough already, here's something else to add to the notion that the end times are approaching: Microsoft is embracing Google, Apple, Samsung and even the free Linux operating system in ways it never has before.\nHere's the quick rundown of the news, coming out of the Microsoft Connect event for programmers:\nMicrosoft will be joining the Linux Foundation, which oversees the development of the very popular free operating system Linux. Microsoft spent much of the '90s fiercely competing with Linux , seeing it as a threat to the dominance of Windows, so this is a notable deal. Microsoft is also releasing a public preview edition of its previously-announced SQL Server database product for Linux . Google is joining the steering committe of the .NET Foundation, the independent nonprofit that Microsoft set up in 2014 to oversee the community around the .NET Programming Framework, its very popular set of technologies for building software, particularly software for businesses and for the web. Samsung is working with Microsoft to let programmers use .NET to develop apps for Tizen operating system, popular on Samsung smart TVs and other gadgets made by the South Korean company. Last, but not least, Microsoft will be releasing a version of Visual Studio for Apple's Macs . Microsoft accidentally revealed this news earlier this week when it published a blog entry ahead of schedule. Julia Liuson, Microsoft's corporate VP of the developer division, says ever since the company embraced open source technologies and a more partner-friendly attitude , it's been winning over converts who may otherwise never have looked at Microsoft products.\n\"We're really finding fans everywhere,\" Liuson says.\nMicrosoft \nFor instance, she says, a team at Google is using Visual Studio Code, Microsoft's free lightweight code editor, to build the Chrome browser. That's gives Microsoft some major brownie points, given Google's reputation as one of the arbiters of cool in Silicon Valley's programmer scene.\nWhich brings us back around to that veritable mountain of announcements. The whole point is to take Microsoft's improving image in the developer world, and solidify it by making some lasting, formal partnerships.\n'Better than the picture' Another Google example: Liuson says the team behind the Google Cloud platform kept reaching out to Microsoft with questions about .NET, because their own customers wanted to use it to build their software. Now, Google is officially helping steer the future of .NET, ideally making it better for customers of both companies.\n\"We're really building one of the biggest and the most robust ecosystems,\" says Liuson.\nSimilarly, for the last few years, Microsoft has loved trotting out a picture of Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella proclaiming his love for the Linux operating system. It's the first image in this article.\nWhile Linux never caught on as a proper competitor to Windows or Mac on PCs, it's the operating system of choice for many millions of servers in the world, and Microsoft supports it in its Azure cloud to great enthusiasm.\nMicrosoft \nNow, by signing on as a member of the Linux Foundation, it just proves to the world that its love is real, which has the nice benefit of helping Microsoft prove to developers that Azure is committed to supporting Linux.\n\"We have something better than the picture,\" Liuson says.\nAlong those lines, Visual Studio for Mac — based heavily on the Xamarin Studio product, which Microsoft got in its purchase of Xamarin earlier this year — is a play to appeal to those many programmers who mainly code on their Macs, but might benefit from some Microsoft technologies. \nThe bottom line is, Microsoft is showing a willingness to work with competitors and their platforms if it makes developers, still the company's most important customers, happy. When those customers are happy, they spend more time on Microsoft's playground. And with these announcements, they're committing to fair play.\n\"The excitement is real,\" Liuson says.\nNOW WATCH: Here's what it's like to use Microsoft's new Paint 3D \n",

      "text": "In the world of \"buy one give one\" social enterprise companies, TOMS — one of the first companies to conquer the space — reigns supreme.\nThe company, known for its stylish shoes and accessories as well as its emphasis on social good initiatives, just released a new line of products: Woven watch bands made for the Apple Watch . Sales of the straps benefit TOMS' Give Time initiative, which aids the organizations SolarAid and Solar Sister and help provide solar energy to underdeveloped nations in Africa. TOMS will donate the equivalent of one year's worth of solar power for each watch band sold.\nNot only are these watch straps a feel-good purchase, they're quite dapper to boot. \nThe straps come in two price tiers: Utility ($49) and Artisan ($75). The Utility bands feature durable grosgrain fabric and leather detailing, while the Artisan straps feature full leather backing for a slightly more luxe look and feel.\nCheck out a few sneak peeks at the straps below.\n\nUtility TOMS Apple Watch band in Olive\nImage: TOMS\n\nArtisan TOMS Apple Watch band in Black Diamond\nImage: TOMS\n\nUtility TOMS Apple Watch band in Dusty Pink\nThe effort isn't TOMS' first foray into accessories beyond shoes: Though the brand is arguably most widely recognized for its slip-on style flats and sandals, it also makes eyewear and bags . Oh, and interestingly, coffee .\nThe new Apple Watch initiative arrives just in time for the holiday shopping season, making the world a little bit brighter one band at a time.",

      "text": "Audi, Kia & Genesis announce new vehicles ready for Apple's CarPlay By Wednesday, November 16, 2016, 10:21 am PT (01:21 pm ET) Several automakers have announced new CarPlay-ready vehicles in anticipation of this week's Los Angeles Auto Show, among them Kia, and luxury brands Audi and Genesis. Kia's entry is the 2017 Soul Exclaim , which has improved horsepower and mileage over other Soul models. Both CarPlay and Android Auto will come standard with the vehicle's UVO3 dash interface, and buyers will be able to upgrade to an 8-inch touchscreen. A price and launch date aren't available, but drivers can also get CarPlay on other 2017 models of the Soul. Audi will be supporting CarPlay and Android Auto as standard on 2018 models of the A5 and S5 Sportback , along with its Q5 SUV. All three should go on sale in spring next year. Lastly, Genesis will have CarPlay and Android Auto on the 3.3T Sport trim of its G80 sedan. The car will arrive this spring, notably featuring a 9.2-inch touchscreen, one of the largest displays in any CarPlay-equipped vehicle. Topics:",

      "title": "Everything you need to know about USB-C & Thunderbolt 3 on Apple's new MacBook Pro",
      "text": "By Daniel Eran Dilger Wednesday, November 16, 2016, 09:11 am PT (12:11 pm ET) Apple has decisively transitioned its new MacBook Pros to use the slim, unidirectional new USB-C port first introduced on the Retina MacBook a year and a half ago. Its latest MacBook Pro machines not only supply more connectors, but also support the enhanced new USB 3.1 Gen 2 and Thunderbolt 3 protocols for blazing fast wired connectivity and high resolution displays. Lightning, USB-C and the original USB-A Flex your power Like the Retina MacBook, the new MacBook Pro models no longer use MagSafe, Apple's quick release magnetic plug for delivering power. Power is now delivered via USB-C, which fits snuggly enough to pull your laptop off the edge of a table if something inadvertently tugs the cable hard enough. While many are weeping over the death of their beloved MagSafe, I've always been of the opinion that the connector was simply a proprietary effort by Apple to monopolize the resale market for charging adapters. The one-piece design of MagSafe adapters also meant that MacBook power adapters could only be used to charge a MagSafe notebook; the cable was also integrated into the adapter, so if the wire itself or its connector junction wears out or is damaged you have to replace both as a package. Another advantage of USB-C for charging over MagSafe is that you can supply power from either side of the machine, and also draw power from a connected display, dock, external battery, solar panels like the Solartab C or any other device that supports the USB-C Power Delivery specification. With power delivery over the same USB-C cable as Thunderbolt 3, you can now connect a display with just one cable. Apple's previous Thunderbolt Display required both a Thunderbolt 2 cable and a MagSafe power connection. Before that, Cinema Displays needed three cables: one for video, one for power, and one for USB. With power delivery over the same USB-C cable as Thunderbolt 3, you can now connect a display with just one cable The new USB-C power adapter that ships with MacBook Pro models can be used to power the laptop via the included USB-C charge cable, or you can plug in a USB-C to Lightning cable (or use a USB-C to USB-A adapter along with your existing Lightning to USB cable) and use it to charge your iPhone or iPad, as quickly as those devices can support. The 15 inch MacBook Pro ships with an 87 watt power adapter, while the 13 inch model includes a 61 watt adapter. The same adapter can be used to charge either system, although the smaller version will charge the battery slower. Apple sells rather expensive replacement MacBook adapters, but given its support for standardized USB-C Power Delivery, you can now shop around for less expensive alternatives. The untethered USB-C charge cable Apple bundles is also sold separately, and there's no ears for wrapping it around the adapter--likely because the cable is both thicker and detachable. Just as with the power adapters included with iPads, there's also no longer any extended AC cable included, but you can still pull the adapter's integrated power plug out and replace it with one of the long AC cords you likely already have. When used to charge iOS devices, an iPhone or iPad will only draw the wattage (voltage x amperage) it is designed to use, regardless of the capacity of the adapter to deliver higher power. However, Apple ships both its iPhones and iPads with lower rate adapters than those devices are capable of using. All iPhones continue to ship with Apple's ridiculous 5 watt plug, despite being capable of charging much faster with the 10 or 12 watt adapters that ship with iPads. Plugged into USB-C on the new MacBook Pro models (or its higher watt power adapter), both iPhones and iPad will charge as fast as they can (but no faster). The max charge rate for iPhone 7 Plus appears to be 10 watts (5.2V x 2.1A), but the 12.9 inch iPad Pro can make use of the higher rate charging that's part of the newer USB PD (Power Delivery) specification: apparently the same 29 watts (at 14.5V x 2.0A) delivered by the Retina MacBook. While iOS devices don't need (and can't fully use) as much power as the MacBook Pro USB-C adapters deliver to the laptop they ship with, they fact that they can now be used with these adapters means that you only have to pack one brick when traveling. The USB-C ports on the MacBook Pro models also deliver 10 watts (5.2V x 2.1A, below 2100mA when adding Extra Operating Current to the Required Current) to any directly connected iOS device, so you can charge your iPhone quickly that way as well. USB-C is smaller and omnidirectional Did you notice how quickly the \"Apple isn't innovating!\" crowd changed its tune to \"Apple is disrupting the comfortable status quo!\"? The company's decisive move to USB-C on the Retina MacBook was constrained by the fact that Apple only put one port on the machine, but the new MacBook Pros deliver two (on the low end 13 inch model without a Touch Bar) or a luxurious four on its other MacBook Pro models (more USB ports than any other previous MacBook Pro). Despite offering twice the USB ports of its previous MacBook Air, the new models are even thinner, thanks in part to the smaller size and volume consumed by the much more compact USB-C port. Like Lightning, the new port also works when plugged in either direction. It would not be better for the new MacBook Pro to be saddled with old connectors for USB-A and Thunderbolt 2 / Display Port. In fact, the edge walls of the new system are slimmer than the shell of an USB-A port itself (below, pictured with Apple's $9 USB-C to USB-A 3.0 adapter). The new MacBook Pro edge wall is slimmer than the shell of an USB-A port Not having to visually line up the direction of a USB port is so much nicer than the original USB type plug, and the fact that a simple adapter might be needed in the transition —one that costs less than $10, or can be solved with the use of a USB-C hub, really leaves this a problem without an issue. USB-C is faster: USB 3.1 Gen2 & Thunderbolt 3 USB-C ports on the new MacBook Pros all serve as both USB 3.1 Gen 2 ports (supporting up to 10 Gbps) and as high performance Thunderbolt 3 interfaces, and can support massive resolution external displays. A 5K display packs over 2.5 times as many pixels as even the built-in Retina Display, but thanks to Thunderbolt 3 this machine can power two of them. It can also drive four 4K screens. You'll need to be careful about selecting cables, as the physically identical USB-C used by USB 3 and Thunderbolt 3 has different requirements for cabling related to the speed and power a given cable can support (just the same as a given Category of Ethernet cabling). The Apple-supplied power adapter charging cable, despite having USB-C ports on either end, is not actually a USB 3.0. USB 3.1 or Thunderbolt 3 cable Note in particular that the Apple-supplied power adapter charging cable, despite having USB-C ports on either end, is not actually a USB 3.0. USB 3.1 or Thunderbolt 3 cable. It can't be used with another USB-C Mac to support Target Disk Mode or to transfer data via Migration Assistant. For that, you'll need a USB-C cable that supports USB 3 or USB 3.1 data. Apple states that the \"USB-C Charge Cable\" it supplies in the box can only support USB 2.0 data transfer speeds (up to 480 Mbps) to another USB 2.0 device. The same USB 2.0 speed limit applies to Apple's USB-C to Lightning cable. However, Apple's Lightning plug can support USB 3.0 speeds, as it does on the 12.9 inch iPad Pro (supporting the Lightning to USB 3 Camera Adapter). It does not appear that any other iOS devices currently support USB 3 speeds over Lightning, however. The new MacBook Pro models not only support USB 3.1 (up to 5 Gbps speeds, used by the Retina MacBook) but also the newest USB 3.1 Gen 2, which supports data transfers up to 10 Gbps. Beyond USB, the super flexible, uniform \"everything on one connector\" design of USB-C also support's Intel's Thunderbolt 3, which multiplexes PCIe and DisplayPort. Thunderbolt 3 has an upper limit of 20 Gbps per channel on two separate buses, supporting throughput of up to 40 Gbps. DisplayPort 1.2 drives the graphics capabilities of the AMD Radeon Pro GPU to drive four external display streams beyond the built in screen (Apple said the GPU also draws the Touch Bar, but the system does not enumerate the Touch Bar as a connected display). An attached 5K display takes up two DisplayPort 1.2 streams (effectively stitching together two displays into one large panel), meaning you can \"only\" connect two 5k displays. However, Apple's implementation of DisplayPort 1.2 and Thunderbolt 3 means a 5k display can be driven over a single cable, an industry first. Thunderbolt 3 is clearly the future of cabling high performance peripherals, displays and external storage units. The fact that it uses the same physical connector as USB 3.1 Gen 2 on the new MacBook Pros makes it even more flexible and universal, without adding additional ports and requiring specialized, unique cable types. However, you'll most certainly need new cable adapters for some of your existing devices, including your iPhone. Several low cost USB docks, some sporting an SD Card reader, should adequately handle most user's backward compatibility needs. Remember that USB-C cables are not all the same: some (like the \"charge cable\" Apple bundles) can only support USB 2 (!) while other versions can only support USB 3 but not Thunderbolt 3. Some versions are also limited by their power capacity. I did not have a Thunderbolt 3 cable or storage system to test. However, the internal SSD uses PCIe, just as Thunderbolt does. It is very fast, scoring 1875.4 MBps (15,000 Mbps) in writes and consistently maxing out the benchmark app at its upper limit of 2,000 MBps (16,000 Mbps or 15 Gbps) for reads. That's really fast. Apple outlines SSD sequential read speeds up to 3.1 GBps and sequential write speeds of 2.2 GBps, which is up to 50 percent faster than the previous generation of MacBook Pros. USB-C & Thunderbolt 3 on other Macs and iOS devices Apple hasn't provided any roadmap on when it might update other products in the Mac family, but it seems very likely that the next generation refresh of iMac, Mac mini and Mac Pro will make the same transition to USB-C and Thunderbolt 3. While connector size and volume is not as big of an issue on desktop machines, the new versatile, universal and more powerful connectivity afforded by Thunderbolt 3 and the USB-C connector is clearly the future. USB 3.1 speeds can be delivered over the older, larger USB-A connectors that are currently ubiquitous, but Thunderbolt speeds, and features like DisplayPort support, can't. For iOS devices, USB-C offers less of an attraction, given that they can't support Thunderbolt 3 connectivity (which requires an Intel processor) and don't need DisplayPort video output to external displays. The fact that basic USB 3.0 connectivity can be supported on existing Lightning connectors and legacy USB ports suggests that iOS devices might not make the switch as quick, requiring a longer transition period of using adapters. At the same time, there's a lot you can now do wirelessly rather than needing to plug in a cable. WiFi sync, AirDrop photo and file transfers and iCloud based sharing are all more convenient than plugging in a cable. That leaves power charging as the biggest reason for plugging a cable into an iOS device, and that issue may be solved by induction or truly wireless charging before USB-C becomes completely and universally adopted.

      "text": "An authorized seller of Apple products says that AirPods will be available sometime in December An authorized seller of Apple products says that AirPods will be available sometime in December Posted: Tags : Accessories - Accessories + Apple - Apple + At Apple's press event that took place back in September, we witnessed the courage that the company had to remove the headphone jack from the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus. The absence of the iconic 3.5-millimeter port is Apple's biggest push for wireless headphone technology, and while the included Lighting EarPods are certainly serviceable for the time being, there's a great deal of anticipation surrounding the forthcoming AirPods. Despite being announced more than two months ago, Apple has yet to offer any official word on their upcoming wireless headphones. The last rumor that we heard said that the AirPods wouldn't be available for purchase until sometime in January , but a new report reinstates the idea that the headphones will in fact go on sale before 2016 is over. This report comes by way of Alza.cz - the Czech Republic's largest online retailer and fully authorized reseller of Apple products - as the website has tweaked their listing for the upcoming AirPods. The Alza.cz website now says that Apple's AirPods will start shipping sometime in December, and this lines up nicely with a report from AppleInsider earlier this month that AirPods would see the light of day before 2016 was up. However, seeing that a reseller such as Alza.cz has a shipping time frame of December, it could be possible that Apple will start selling AirPods directly even sooner - possibly before the end of November. If that isn't enough reassurance for you, there have also been confirmed reports that Apple retail stores have already received demo units of the new AirPods and that the company's employees have been going through training on the new gadget. In fact, one source commented on the matter and said that there was \"no way\" that AirPods wouldn't come out until January. As goofy as they still look, I can't wait to try AirPods for myself. As goofy as AirPods still look to me, I'd be lying if I said I wasn't interested in giving them a whirl myself and seeing just how well they actually work. The tight integration they look to offer with iOS could be a real treat for iPhone-owners, and if this report turns out to be true, we might not have to wait too long after all before we get to make some final judgments on them.",

We generally liked the result of the changes in our review , but according to a report by iFixit , they come at a cost.\niFixit opened up Apple's 13-inch MacBook Pro with the Touch Bar, and found it harder to repair than ever, with few easily replaceable parts. Hopefully, you won't want to swap out your battery or upgrade your MacBook's memory -- both are soldered or glued in place.\nStrangely, iFixit also discovered the speaker grilles on the laptop are ornamental -- the speakers themselves don't actually line up with them but project sound through the side air vents. \nAs for the Touch Bar itself -- iFixit called it a \"second, difficult to replace, screen to damage.\" \nApple did not immediately respond to CNET's request for comment.",

Amazingly, you can use that to scrub THROUGH an ad, even a non-skippable 30 second pre-roll ad; and begin your video right away! \nWho knows how long this ‘feature’ will exist. But, hey; pretty neat! Watch Live \nThe new MacBook Pro line has been met with a lot of criticism about an underpowered ‘Pro’ line that lacks any of the innovation of its competitors. The Touch Bar is new, but it feels gimmicky — and it definitely wasn’t worth waiting over a year for. Still, it’s a cool new feature, and one that should only get better as we figure out how to better utilize it. \nScrubbing through ads is a good start, although it might not be around for long. These ads are intended to be un-skippable for a reason, after all. ",

      "text": "Comment Apple iMac 2016 releases on Oct. 27 \nThe iMac from Apple has always been an iconic piece of technological wizardry, and it was one of those releases that helped to pull Apple from its quagmire more than a decade ago to the rejuvenated corporate behemoth that it is today. Well, it seems that the creative computer market is about to be met by the iMac 2016 -- if rumors that keep on flying around prove to be correct. \nObviously, the iMac 2016 has been on the rumor mill for some time already, where there has been plenty of speculation about the hardware that it carries in addition to the kinds of different features which would clearly put it heads and shoulders above the other regular desktops that are in the market. There are hushed whispers of a 5K resolution display to keep the iMac 2016 relevant not only for this year, but in the years to come, where it will be powered by Intel's family of Kaby Lake processors. Of course, such specifications are certainly drool-worthy, and you would be able to see why folks are getting excited about the upcoming computer. \nOne must also remember that Apple did make an announcement concerning the confirmed demise of the Thunderbolt Display, not to mention Apple being involved in the creation of the 27-inch UltraFine 5K monitor alongside LG. Certainly all of these moves by Apple have raised eyebrows as well as questions, and more importantly, will the iMac 2016 arrives with 5K resolution as well? \nOriginally rumored to arrive this Fall, it looks like that rumor ran out of gas as it was the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus instead that made the release cut, accompanied by the Apple Watch Series 2. The new range of MacBooks also made their debut last month, and it is now the middle of November without a single iMac in sight. \nCould all of this be done on purpose just to make sure that more people will hop aboard the iMac 2016 hype train in due time? If that is the case, then it is certainly an effective marketing strategy. We are certainly keeping our fingers crossed that it is not a situation on the other extreme, where there is no work being done to release the iMac 2016 anytime soon, which might eventually be known as the iMac 2017 as December 2016 bids goodbye to welcome in January 2017. \nInterestingly enough, Intel has slated their Kaby Lake processors to be released next year, which would then be a pretty clear indicator that the new iMac 2017 will also ship right after that, or perhaps at the same time. It is pretty difficult to separate the Intel Kaby Lake processor from the new and upcoming iMac model based on what we have heard so far. \nWell, we strongly believe that it is far better to take an adequate amount of time in making sure that a particular product is well thought up and developed before hitting the manufacturing lines. After all, not too many companies are able to afford the kind of Galaxy Note 7 exploding incident that resulted in cessation of all manufacturing of the device. ",

Features that once required a $100 device can now be had for as little as $30. A cheap device is fine for getting TV shows and movies from most popular services onto a big-screen TV — as long as it's a regular, high-definition set. Of course, it's possible to simply watch video on a phone or tablet, but it's not as satisfying from a living-room couch. Here's a holiday buying guide for the TV-streamers in your life. ___ STREAMING BUILT-IN Smart TVs, game consoles and the TiVo digital video recorder all have streaming apps, and if all you watch is Netflix and Hulu, you'll be fine with those. But apps for individual channels such as The CW and FX won't work with every device. The exceptions are TVs running Roku software or that have Google's Chromecast technology built in; they tend to have wider app selections. ___ GETTING AROUND Devices vary in how easy it is to access apps and video. While many devices are getting voice features that let you search multiple services at once, you'll still need to navigate on-screen menus with a remote. The exception is Chromecast, which has no menu or remote at all. Instead, you start video on an iPhone or Android phone and send it to the big screen with a tap of a cast button. With some video services, the phone is freed up for other things, though you'll need to use the phone as a remote for pausing and rewinding. Devices running Google's Android TV come with Chromecast features and pack their menus with video from Google's YouTube service. Amazon's Fire TV device has traditionally favored Amazon video over others, though that's changing as Netflix, HBO and other leading services get prominence on the home screen. Roku is the most service-agnostic of the bunch. Apple TV ships with Apple services, but it's easy to replace those with your favorites. ___ APP SELECTION Roku has one of the most complete app libraries, though Apple's iTunes service is notably missing. You'll need an Apple TV to access iTunes. Apple TV also has a good app selection, though out of 25 leading services The Associated Press checked, it's missing direct access to Amazon, Google Play, Vudu and PlayStation Vue. You can get the first three indirectly with a Chromecast-like feature called AirPlay if you have a companion iPhone or other Apple device. Amazon's Fire TV device is missing iTunes, Google Play, Vudu, ABC, Freeform and the NFL (though some games are shown through Twitter's app). The selection on Android TV is also limited, but you can supplement that with apps for Chromecast. With an Android phone, you can get all but iTunes, though getting Amazon video is tough, as it requires getting Amazon's \"Underground\" app store first. With an iPhone, you're missing iTunes, Amazon and USA Network, even with AirPlay. If you just have a Chromecast device with an iPhone, you're also missing Freeform (formerly ABC Family) and CNN. You'll still need individual subscriptions to these services. The streaming device merely enables playback on the big screen. ___ ENTRY-LEVEL DEVICES Amazon's Fire TV Stick stands out as a speedy, capable device for $40. It now comes with a voice remote for searches and Alexa assistant queries on weather, sports scores and other information. The Roku Express is cheaper at $30, though there's no voice remote, and the interface is slower (which doesn't matter as much once you sit back and watch the video). It's a great choice considering its wider app selection, notwithstanding the lack of iTunes. Google's entry-level Chromecast costs $35 — affordable, though the gadget is clunky without its own remote. It's slightly better with Android than iPhones. ___ MID-RANGE DEVICES Xiaomi's Mi Box is a speedy Android TV device with a nice price tag, $69. It supports higher-resolution video known as 4K, an option that once required more expensive devices. But you need a 4K TV and services that offer 4K video — so far, Netflix and YouTube do so for just some of their offerings. Mi Box also supports HDR picture quality. HDR, or high dynamic range, promises brighter whites, darker blacks and a richer range of colors — but you need an HDR TV and HDR video. Google's new Chromecast Ultra also has 4K and HDR support for $69. Because Mi Box also does Chromecast, you get more overall for the same price. Mi Box also has a voice remote. The Roku Premiere also offers 4K for $80, but its remote lacks voice support. Amazon's regular Fire TV has 4K and a voice remote for $90. Neither has HDR. For now, HDR sets are rarer than 4K, and even 4K sets aren't that common. ___ WHY PAY MORE? The $100 Roku Premium Plus and the $130 Roku Ultra offer both 4K and HDR. The remote for both also has a headphone jack for listening when everyone else is asleep. The Ultra also has a voice remote, something many cheaper devices offer. That remote also has gaming buttons and emits a sound when you lose it in a couch. For hard-core gamers, consider the $200 Nvidia Shield TV, an Android TV with both 4K and HDR support, plus faster processors for games with intensive graphics. Another premium choice is Apple TV, which starts at $149. You don't get 4K or HDR, which won't matter for regular sets. Instead, you get plenty of apps that do more than play video. You can browse Ikea's catalog, order food from Grubhub and get the AccuWeather forecasts. For video, an upcoming app simply called TV promises to bring together all your viewing from various channels and services. An iPhone isn't required, but helps. Sorry, no Android. And for iTunes, Apple TV is the only choice.",

      "text": "Bloomberg Target is focusing on grocery, with marketing and value messaging. Target Corp. credited a strong back-to-school season among other factors for Wednesday’s better-than-expected earnings report. But some analysts believe that the retailer’s struggle to drive everyday traffic through its grocery business is a sign of weakness.\n“Although Target’s performance has improved, it would be wrong to say that it is now a company firing on all cylinders,” said Neil Saunders, chief executive of Conlumino. “Underlying sales growth remains very soft and underscores the fact that, overall, Target is losing market share.”\n“Getting grocery right matters, if only because it is such an important driver of traffic to stores,” Saunders added.\nSee also: Online retailers tighten vice grip on department stores\nTarget TGT, +6.09% reported adjusted earnings per share of $1.04, beating the 83-cent FactSet consensus. Sales totaled $16.4 billion, down from $17.6 billion, but exceeding the $16.3 billion FactSet estimate. Same-store sales were down 0.2% versus a FactSet consensus of a 1.1% decline.\nThe company now sees fourth-quarter same-store sales in the range of down 1% to up 1% from down 2% to flat. And it expects both EPS and adjusted EPS of $1.55 to $1.75. The FactSet consensus is for a same-store sales decline of 0.8% and EPS of $1.60.\nTarget shares are up 6.6% in Wednesday trading.\nSee also: Target boosts outlook after profit and sales beat\n“Consistent with our recent strength around events and holidays, third-quarter sales in the back-to-school, back-to-college season were very strong, resulting in favorable gross margin mix in our sales,” said Target’s Chief Executive Brian Cornell on the Wednesday earnings call, according to a FactSet transcript.\nCornell highlighted the company’s new kids apparel line Cat & Jack and improved sales of Apple Inc. AAPL, +2.48% products among the company’s success stories.\nSee also: One of retail’s favorite demographics just disappeared\nGoing forward the company says it’s seeing pre-orders of Apple products, like the iPhone 7, that are three times higher than last year. And for the holidays, the company wants to continue the success of Cat & Jack and boost sales with its toy assortment, among other categories. Target has added nearly 1,800 new and exclusive toys for the holidays, according to Chief Merchandising Officer Mark Tritton.\nStill, company executives acknowledge that there’s more work to do.\nSee also: ‘The Amazon effect’ and 3 other things to watch for this holiday shopping season\n“I want to… make it clear that while we have made significant progress, we are not satisfied with our third-quarter traffic and sales performance,” said Cathy Smith, Target’s chief financial officer, on the Wednesday earnings call. Cornell said, for instance, that Target experienced another “small decline in food comp sales” during the quarter.\nSee also: Target’s grocery chief is out as sales slide\nRead also: How Wal-Mart is eating Target’s lunch in the U.S.\n“The dynamic highlights one of the core issues with Target: while it is good at drawing consumers in for specific purposes and occasions, it is much less effective at building everyday traffic and sales,” said Conlumino’s Saunders. Part of that, he says, is that stalled grocery business.\n“In essence, we believe Target needs to rip up the grocery rule book and reinvent its rather bland store environment,” said Saunders.\nTarget recognizes the significance of this category and, in separate earnings materials said that it has begun focusing on a “stronger value messaging,” dedicating more weekly ad space to savings options, among other steps.\nSee also: Amazon’s big rival in e-commerce is Wal-Mart\nOther criticisms from Conlumino include a lack of merchandise “newness,” which deters more frequent visits. Target’s Smith emphasized that the company is, in fact, focused on newness.\nAnd store experience, which Conlumino said is lacking. Things like events and better areas for online item collection could make the Target more appealing.\nStill, Conlumino believes Target is on the right path.\n“It is also in a far better position than many of its mass merchant rivals,” said Conlumino’s Saunders.\nMoody’s believes Target has outdone its competitors in at least one area: digital.\nSee also: Most retailers would benefit from staying closed on Thanksgiving Day\n“Overall, we believe the third quarter was a nice quarter for Target, particularly on the online sales front, with 26% year-over-year growth, which we feel will place it near the top of the brick-and-mortar retail universe, although the base remains relatively small,” said Charlie O’Shea, Moody’s lead retail analyst.\nAnalysts at The Buckingham Research Group are bullish pointing out that Target is reporting improved results despite headwinds like a promotional environment and unseasonable weather.\n“We believe this reflects better execution, the introduction of new product (Cat & Jack, Pillowfort) in key categories, and the attractiveness of Target’s assortment,” analysts wrote in a note published Wednesday.\nBuckingham Research rates Target shares buy and raised its target price to $85 from $79.\nTarget shares are up 4.9% for the year so far while the S&P 500 Index SPX, -0.24% is up 6.4% for the same period.\nMore from MarketWatch Donald Trump, Barack Obama Appear at White House Together Trump-inspired bond selloff spells trouble for stocks Dow in danger of snapping 7-session win streak",

Looking back at Apple's recent, historical twenty-year run, Ive takes viewers on a rare visit to Apple's design studio to pull back the curtain on the nuts and bolts of the company's creative approaches. \"For every finished product that you see, tools had to be designed, process had to be created and experimented with,\" says Ive. \"We worked very hard to create a studio that has all these different facets ... we have really made it a practice to just have our heads down and work, and ignore -- in some senses -- all the reasons something shouldn't be possible.\"\nThis new visual exploration of Apple's design studio comes to us in promotion of Designed by Apple in California , a new book which traces the same history spotlighted by today's vignette. You can check out the aforementioned video above, while viewers can learn more about Designed by Apple in California here .\nFor more from Ive, head on over to Wallpaper* for a sit-down with the design icon.\nRead more at Hypebeast.com \n\n",

      "text": "This week, reports that technology titan Apple is developing so-called digital or smart glasses that use augmented and virtual reality technology with a potential release in 2018 have piqued the curiosity of the company's rabid fans.\nHowever, there is a smaller company with several products like this already on the market, and its stock has been quietly climbing .\nVuzix ( VUZI ) is a wearable technology companies and supplier of smart glasses that use AR and VR technology. The company holds about 40 patents and has 10 additional patents pending.\nThe AR market is in its early stages. Projections, however , suggest that it should reach the $120 billion mark by 2020.\nWith a relatively small market value of about $140 million , Vuzix carries stellar growth potential. The secret weapon in its arsenal is the Blade 3000 Smart Sunglasses, which received four International CES Innovation 2017 awards.\nThese sunglasses allow users to view and interact with digital and video content in high-resolution computer-generated AR and VR worlds.\nIn addition, Vuzix's expanding product portfolio offers regular glass lenses that are just 1.4 millimeters thick , placing the company at a solid technological advantage in this emerging sector.\nShares of Vuzix are undervalued, given that it boasts a series of successful products in the AR and VR arenas. Although the buzz is stronger around Facebook's Oculus VR headset and Sony's attempt to make in-roads into the sector, Vuzix is gradually garnering acclaim and making a dent in the market.\nApple and Facebook are holdings in Jim Cramer's Action Alerts PLUS Charitable Trust Portfolio .

      "text": "Reddit The new MacBook Pro with Touch Bar is the first of Apple’s Macs to include a Touch ID sensor built-in for Apple Pay, unlocking the Mac with your fingerprint, and authentication purposes in third-party apps. Other Macs can use Apple Pay, but they need to use a nearby iPhone or Apple Watch to authenticate and complete the purchase. Here’s how it works: The new MacBook Pro prompts users to setup a fingerprint during setup, but that will only let you setup one finger. Once you’ve completed the setup process, you can then add additional fingerprints (up to 3) from within System Preferences. And like Touch ID, the new MacBook Pro also allows you to easily setup your Apple Pay details during the setup process, prompting users to scan their credit card or to enter security codes if a card is already detected on file. How to setup Touch ID and add fingerprints on MacBook Pro \nNavigate to Apple menu → System Preferences>Touch ID: Click the “+ Add a fingerprint” to add a new fingerprint. The MacBook Pro supports up to 3 at once. ****Click the small “x” next to fingerprints and enter your Mac’s password to delete one. Your Mac will now prompt you to enter your system account password and place your finger to setup your fingerprint: \nFrom here you can also select to enable and disable the various Touch ID functions separately including Unlocking your Mac, Apple Pay, and iTunes & App Store. How to add cards Apple Pay & Wallet on MacBook Pro \nNavigate to Apple menu>System Preferences>Wallet & Apple Pay: Select “Add Card…” to scan a new card Hold your card up to the camera to automatically detect the number or click the button to “Enter Card Details Manually” Once your card is added, you can manage your cards, view transaction history, edit contact and shipping info, and click the “+” or “-” icons to add or remove cards: \nAfter you’ve setup Touch ID and Apple Pay on your Mac, you and others can still alternatively use a nearby iPhone or Apple Watch to authenticate (same goes for unlocking), which can be handy if a guest is using your Mac and wants to use Apple Pay.

      "text": "Is Apple ( AAPL ) tooling up to create custom chips for its next generation of MacBooks?\nAnalysts at Exane BNP Paribas think it might be, after they noticed a surge in Apple job advertisements for the sort of people needed to create an in-house central processing unit, or CPU, or a graphics processing unit, or GPU.\nApple is a holding in Jim Cramer's Action Alerts PLUS Charitable Trust Portfolio . Want to be alerted before Cramer buys or sells AAPL ? Learn more now .\nApple is advertising 87 hardware engineering graphics roles, including 10 in London, according to Exane. A quick search of Apple's website found 62 of those roles, including eight in Apple's Hanover Street office in London.\n\"The graphics job vacancies suggest that Apple is building a completely new chip design team, which in our experience points to a new application,\" Exane analysts David O'Conner and Jerome Ramel wrote in a note published Wednesday. \"The need for computing, CPU and/or GPU skills could point to a custom Apple chip for the Apple MacBook. it is entirely plausible that Apple could produce a beefed up 7mm apps processor ... capable of powering a MacBook in 2018\"\nThat could be bad news for Intel ( INTC ) .\nThe Mountain View, Calif.-based chipmaker currently supplies much of the computing power for Apple's laptops. Intel's Core i5 CPUs are included in the 2016 iteration of the MacBook Pro, while Intel's Iris chips are the GPU for the 13-inch versions of the laptops. An Apple-designed CPU could cost Intel between 3% and 6% of its earnings per share in 2017, according to Exane BNP.",

      "title": "Email Unsubscribes Rise On iOS Devices Since Latest Release 11/16/2016",
      "text": "iOS email unsubscribes have increased 75% since the release of Apple’s latest operating system, according to data released Monday from Yes Lifecycle Marketing.\nApple's release of iOS 10 in September included an “easy unsubscribe” feature that is the likely culprit for the rise in unsubscribes, per the report. The update gave Apple users greater control of their email inbox.\nThe unsubscribe feature, highlighted by a banner at the top of the email message, reads: \"this message is from a mailing list.\" That same banner ad also pushes down the content into the email.\nYes Lifecycle Marketing analyzed unsubscribe rates from emails sent from its platform from August 28 to October 16 to determine whether the latest release of iOS 10 had any negative consequences for email marketers.\nThe  results confirm that email marketers are struggling with the easier-to-use unsubscribe feature. Retail-specific email marketing campaigns have seen their unsubscribe rates double since September, according to Yes Lifecycle Marketing, while the financial services and entertainment industries has seen their unsubscribe rates triple since the release of iOS 10.\n“The overall trend of increasing iOS unsubscribes is consistent across industries but the level of iOS 10 adoption and the size of the unsubscribe increase can significantly vary by industry,” states Kyle Hendrick, director of client services at Yesmail, in a blog post announcing the news. “All in all, unsubscribes increased as a result of the ‘easy unsubscribe’ functionality introduced in the release of iOS 10 but marketers shouldn’t freak out. There are long-term upsides that could benefit brands.”\nAn unengaged subscriber could cause damage to an email campaign by lowering open rates and overall ROI, but the high unsubscribe rates suggested by Yes Lifecycle Marketing’s report are troubling.\nProviding a preference center for subscribers is the most effective way for marketers to stop unsubscribes, according to a recent study of almost 1,800 consumers by Mapp Digital. Forty percent of respondents said they may be dissuaded from unsubscribing from an email if they were offered a way to receive fewer messages instead, but 35% of respondents asserted that nothing could convince them to stay subscribed to an email list once they made a decision to leave.",
