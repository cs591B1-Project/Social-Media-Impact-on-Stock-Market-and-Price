      "text": "Want to see the latest flight deals as soon as they’re published? Follow The Points Guy on Facebook and Twitter , and subscribe to text message alerts from our deals feed, @ tpg_alerts . \nAirfare deals are typically only available on limited dates. We recommend that you use Google Flights to find dates to fly, then book through an online travel agency, such as Orbitz or Expedia , which allows you to cancel flights without penalty by 11pm Eastern Time within one day of booking. However, if you’re using the American Express Platinum Card , you’ll need to book directly with the airline or through Amex Travel portal to get 5x MR points . Remember: Fares may disappear quickly, so book right away and take advantage of Orbitz or Expedia’s courtesy cancellation if you’re unable to get the time away from work or family. \nTraveling to China from North America typically isn’t a cheap trip, especially as the weather starts to warm up and tourists flock to Chinese cities.

      "text": "People think Facebook swung the election in Donald Trump's favour and they're not happy \nThey think fake stories doing the rounds inflamed potential Trump supporters. Most Popular Tweet Facebook is useful for many things; keeping in touch with long-lost friends, stalking people you went to school with who now have 15 kids, remembering people's birthdays, that sort of thing. But there's one thing it's not useful for, according to some US voters this week, and that's swinging the Presidential election vote, says the New York Post . 81% of all Americans who have access to the internet have a Facebook account , and some anti-Trump voters are convinced this is part of the reason the Apprentice reality star got voted into office. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below It's all thanks to a series of fake, pro-Trump news stories that have frequently been doing the rounds on the social media site in the lead-up to election day, apparently. Some people believe the false articles - including one which stated the Pope was voting for Donald Trump, and another which 'reported' on an FBI agent linked to the Hillary Clinton e-mail leaks being found dead in an \"apparent murder-suicide\" - may have swayed many people to the Republican vote. Donald Trump will succeed Barack Obama as the next President of the United States Getty Most Popular But it's not just disappointed civilians who think it; some Facebook execs themselves also appear to agree. One of them, Adam Mosseri, VP of product management at the social media giant said: \"We take misinformation on Facebook very seriously. We value authentic communication, and hear consistently from those who use Facebook that they prefer not to see misinformation.\" And even the current president, Barack Obama, has touched on the issue. \"As long as it's on Facebook … people start believing it,\" he said during a last-minute election campaign rally on Monday. Hillary was defeated this week in the election. Getty It makes sense, too, that these stories get shared widely on the social network regardless of their accuracy when you think about the algorithm the website has. Facebook uses how popular a post is in terms of clicks and engagement to judge how broadly it promotes it across news feeds; so these dramatic-sounding stories (despite being based on untruths) manage to climb their way to the top ranks of people's feeds quite easily, reaching thousands more users. But Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg doesn't think Facebook has anything to do with Trump's election. Well, of course he doesn't. \"Personally, I think the idea that fake news on Facebook, it's a very small amount of the content, influenced the election in any way is a pretty crazy idea,\" he said during a speech at the Techonomy conference this week, reports Business Insider . Defensive, Mark? But it's something to think about, anyway. How much do you believe simply because it's posted on Facebook? Probably a whole lot more than you'd like to think you do. God, we're a fickle bunch. Follow Cat on Twitter . ",

      "text": "\nIt's the kind of story that brings people together . \nAlyssa Galios shared the story on Facebook . She was in a Washington State Starbucks working away Wednesday morning like she often does. But she was about to witness something extraordinary this time. \nShe said the coffee shop was pretty empty except for a table with a mother and her three young children. \nAlyssa was typing away when she noticed two soldiers walk into the shop in all of their gear. The kids went silent when they saw the two men. \nAfter placing their orders, one of the soldiers turns around -- sensing a pair of young eyes. He went over to the boy and asked him how his day was going. They have a quick chat and the soldier learns that the boy's favorite superhero is Spider-Man. \nThen the soldier ripped off his velcro American flag patch and gave it to the young boy. \nThe other soldier then walked over and did the same -- giving the boy his American flag patch right off of his uniform. \nAs you can imagine, the little boy smiled wide with happiness. \nSoon after, it was time for the kids to go to school. So the boys' mother thanked the two soldiers, Edgar Gonzalez and Pedro Cordoba, profusely. \nAnd with Friday being Veterans' Day, this is a perfect reminder to thank those who've served. \nRead the full story below: ",

      "text": "Want to see the latest flight deals as soon as they’re published? Follow The Points Guy on Facebook and Twitter , and subscribe to text message alerts from our deals feed, @ tpg_alerts . \nAirfare deals are typically only available on limited dates. We recommend that you use Google Flights to find dates to fly, then book through an online travel agency, such as Orbitz or Expedia , which allows you to cancel flights without penalty by 11pm Eastern Time within one day of booking. However, if you’re using the American Express Platinum Card , you’ll need to book directly with the airline or through Amex Travel portal to get 5x MR points . Remember: Fares may disappear quickly, so book right away and take advantage of Orbitz or Expedia’s courtesy cancellation if you’re unable to get the time away from work or family. \nDreading the long, gray winters that are all too typical in the Northeast?

If you have the JetBlue Plus Card , you’ll receive an additional 10% rebate, meaning you’re going to save a total of 25% on a points redemption.\nSince these fares are so cheap, it also presents a fantastic opportunity to take advantage of the $100 Visa Infinite airfare credit , available to those who have the Ritz-Carlton Rewards Credit Card .

For the last couple of years, the two have been inseparable, doing everything together, from watching TV to going to the gym.\nThe bizarre story was originally posted on the Facebook page of one Worranan Sarasalin from Kanchanaburi, Thailand, along with a set of photos of the man and his beloved cobra in various circumstances. Sarasalin, who covers a variety of local news stories on a daily basis, claims that the unnamed man developed an unusual connection with the large reptile after noticing a “Striking resemblance” to his deceased girlfriend and becoming convinced that she had come back to life as the serpent.\n\nRead More ",

      "text": "EU sees pause in talks on free trade deal with U.S. Share on Facebook Print By: Staff The Associated Press Published on BRUSSELS — The European Union's top trade official says talks on the planned Trans-Atlantic trade deal are set to be put on hold following the election of Donald Trump in the United States. EU Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstroem said Friday that \"with the new president-elect we don't really know what will happen\" with the Trans-Atlantic Trade and Investment Pact. She said \"there is strong reason to believe that there would be a pause in TTIP, that this might not be the biggest priority for the new administration.\" The Europeans had wanted to seal a deal before President Barack Obama leaves office in January. Looming elections in France and Germany have also hampered progress. TTIP aims to remove barriers to trade between the EU and the U.S. to boost economic growth and employment. A similar trade agreement between the EU and Canada remains to be ratified by the European and Canadian parliaments. That deal was negotiated by the Harper Conservatives and supported by the Trudeau Liberal government. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and senior European officals signed the Comprehensive Economic Trade Agreement on Oct. 30 in Brussels, after the Belgian region of Wallonia voted to withdraw its opposition to CETA..

      "text": "Mark Zuckerburg wants us to get all Snapchatty with a new and similar app. Instagram Stories is not enough and so it’s making a standalone app that will hopefully beat Snapchat when it comes to fun and silly augmented reality imaging and photography. If you’re an avid fan of Snapchat (aka Snapchat Queen or King), try Flash and see if it’s better.\nWell, this isn’t the first time the Facebook group attempted to rival Snapchat. Remember Slingshot and Poke? This is another version but the developers are very hopeful this will be a close competitor as the others have already failed.\nWhat are the chances of this Flash? The app was built especially for the emerging market where WiFi connectivity is slow, weak, or scarce. File size of the app is small at only less than 25MB so it’s not heavy, is easy to download, and quick to load. Its size is actually a third of Snapchat for Android.\nWill Facebook finally beat Snapchat? We’re not really sure but those people who want something “lighter” will appreciate the Flash. Admit it, Snapchat easily crashes. The Snapchat addict in your deserves something faster and more responsive so maybe this ‘Flash’ will be your new best friend.\nDownload Flash from the Google Play Store\nVIA: Recode\nStory Timeline Snapchat brings Geostickers to make your snaps even more personalized Some Snapchatters on rooted phones getting logged out Snapchat goes into wearable tech with Spectacles WhatsApp is going all \"snapchatty\" on us with latest update SnapChat updated with new World Lenses, adds filters to your surroundings",

      "text": "After every supermoon, Twitter and Facebook are flooded with fuzzy photos of white glowing orbs kind of floating in a black sea of night.\nBut there are ways to take a good photo of the moon, even with a smartphone.\nMonday’s supermoon will be the closest in its orbit to Earth since 1948. It becomes full Monday morning, but will break the horizon at 6:02 p.m.\nA super moon rises over the Boynton Beach Inlet in Boynton Beach, Florida on September 8, 2014. (Allen Eyestone / The Palm Beach Post)\nHere are a few tips from Palm Beach Post Photographer Lannis Waters first gathered by Palm Beach Post Staff Writer Staci Sturrock during supermoon events in 2014.\nStart early. If you’re using a smartphone, try to capture the moon when it’s still near Earth’s horizon, and find something to frame it with in the foreground (trees, buildings, people). “That will help with your exposure because there should still be some light in the sky, and add interest,” Waters says. Go long. Using a DSLR? “Obviously, shoot with as long a lens as possible,” Waters says. “A tripod will help, and is necessary if you’re using a very long lens. Ditto for a cable release or self-timer to avoid adding any vibrations when you fire a frame.” Look for foreground interest. You can’t go wrong composing your photo with either the Lake Worth or Juno Beach pier in the foreground. “Around here, it’s hard to find a place where you can get far enough back to make a skyline work, but there are places where you could get the moon rising through a stand of trees or over buildings, but you need to search for those in advance,” Waters says. (Jupiter Lighthouse, we’re looking at you.) Tap into an app. Waters likes the SkyView app, “which gives you an Augmented Reality view of the sky, and lets you type in the time and date you want so you can see where the moon will be at that time.” Make manual adjustments. Forego your camera’s automatic settings and use the back of your camera to judge your exposure. “Otherwise the dark sky can make your shot overexposed,” Waters says. “And since the moon is reflecting daylight, the exposure is near what it would be for a sunlit scene in the daytime, so you don’t need a high ISO.” The moon sets at 5:45 a.m., in the western sky as a school bus travels north along Military Trail next to the Palm Beach International Airport in West Palm Beach, September 15, 2016. It becomes full on Friday as it rises at 7:32 p.m. and is the Harvest moon. (Greg Lovett / The Palm Beach Post)\n",

IS ANY OF THIS REAL? \nSeriously, a glitch on Facebook right now is listing people as dead. This writer is dead. All of the Mediaite staff is dead. Look: \nIt isn’t just us!

      "text": "Zuckerberg: 'Crazy' to say Facebook influenced election -   Zuckerberg: 'Crazy' to say Facebook influenced election Posted: By BARBARA ORTUTAYAP Technology Writer \nNEW YORK (AP) - Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg says the idea that fake news spread on Facebook influenced the outcome of the U.S. election is \"crazy.\" \nStill, the majority of Americans (six in 10) say they get at least some news from social media , mostly Facebook, according to the Pew Research Center. While a lot of this news comes from established outlets - whether CNN or BuzzFeed News, misinformation spreads on Facebook just as information does, shared by users, recommended by software and amplified by both. \nSources of spurious information has ranged from news articles produced by \"content farms\" for the sole purpose of getting clicks, to \"hyperpartisan\" sites from both sides of the political spectrum, churning out stories that are misleading at best. \nCase in point: \"FBI AGENT SUSPECTED IN HILLARY EMAIL LEAKS FOUND DEAD IN APPARENT MURDER-SUICIDE\" - a fabricated headline from a fake news site called the Denver Guardian, was shared thousands of times in the days leading up to the election. \nIs it possible that voters were swayed for or against a candidate, much like those same people might buy a product after seeing an ad on Facebook? \nZuckerberg says voters deserve more credit. \nDuring an interview Thursday with \"The Facebook Effect\" author David Kirkpatrick, Zuckerberg said idea that people voted the way they did because of bogus information on Facebook shows a \"profound lack of empathy\" for supporters of Donald Trump. \n\"Voters make decisions based on their lived experience,\" he said. \nGiven the acerbic political contest from which the country just emerged, when countless longtime friends, even family, were unfriended, many are left to wonder if there would be an alternative American history being written today if it were not for Facebook, Twitter and the like. \nThis, after all, was the first truly social media election, playing out on Twitter and Facebook as much or more than it did on major networks, in living rooms and around watercoolers. \nBut isn't social media just a reflection of our world as it exists? Has Facebook become an easy scapegoat when the answer is far more complex? \nWhile Pew found that many believe political discussions on social media to be \"uniquely angry and disrespectful,\" a comparable number have the same impression of face-to-face conversations when it comes to Democrats, the GOP, or another party. \nFILTER BUBBLE? \nWhen it comes to Facebook users, Zuckerberg said almost everyone has friends on the \"other side.\" Even if 90 percent of your friends are Democrats, for example, 10 percent will be Republican. Still, that's not a very big number, and the idea of a \"filter bubble\" - that social media allows people to surround themselves only with the people and ideas with whom they agree, has been a hot topic this election cycle. \n\"By far the biggest filter in the system is not that the content isn't there, that you don't have friends who support the other candidate or that are of another religion,\" Zuckerberg said. \"But it's that you just don't click on it. You actually tune it out when you see it. I don't know what to do about that.\" \nA DIFFICULT LINE \nFacebook has long denied that it's a publisher or a media company, or that it acts remotely like either. Its cheery slogan - to make the world more \"open and connected\" - seemingly invites a broad range of viewpoints, diverse, lively discussion and the free flow of information, rather than censorship. \nBut it could also make clamping down on fake news difficult. At a time when everyone seems entitled, not just to their own opinions, but to their own facts, one person's misleading headline might be another person's heartfelt truth. \n\"We take misinformation on Facebook very seriously,\" Adam Mosseri, the executive in charge of Facebook's news feed, said in a statement to the tech blog TechCrunch this week. \"We value authentic communication, and hear consistently from those who use Facebook that they prefer not to see misinformation.\" \nFacebook acknowledges that it has more work to do, and it seems to be putting a lot of faith in the power of data, artificial intelligence and algorithms as the solution. \nOver the summer, Facebook fired the small group of journalists in charge of its \"trending\" items and replaced them with an algorithm. The catalyst appeared to be a report in a tech blog, based on an anonymous source, that the editors routinely suppressed conservative viewpoints. \nSubsequently, fake stories ahead of the election began to trend.

      "text": "11/11/16 AT 4:01 PM Close \nBecause Americans apparently haven't had a long enough week, on Friday a Facebook glitch began to tell users they were dead. No, seriously. \nA number of social media users posted screenshots on Twitter Friday of their profile pages topped with a banner designating them as memorialized accounts, which are usually reserved for people who have died. Even founder Mark Zuckerberg's profile was impacted. \nFacebook told Politico only that it was \"aware of the bug.\" \nAccording to Facebook's help page , \"memorialized accounts are a place for friends and family to gather and share memories after a person has passed away.\" Nobody can log into a memorialized account. \nFacebook is also having a rough week. The company was recently criticized for allowing false news stories to go viral in its \"trending\" section, and the calls for change resurfaced after Republican Donald Trump won the presidential election. Zuckerberg pushed back Thursday. \n\"Personally I think the idea that fake news on Facebook, of which it’s a very small amount of the content, influenced the election in any way is a pretty crazy idea,\" he said, according to Variety . \"There is a certain profound lack of empathy in asserting that the only reason someone could have voted the way they did is because they saw some fake news.\" Related Stories",

      "text": "Zuckerberg: 'Crazy' to say Facebook influenced election -   Zuckerberg: 'Crazy' to say Facebook influenced election Posted:   By BARBARA ORTUTAYAP Technology Writer \nNEW YORK (AP) - Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg says the idea that fake news spread on Facebook influenced the outcome of the U.S. election is \"crazy.\" \nStill, the majority of Americans (six in 10) say they get at least some news from social media , mostly Facebook, according to the Pew Research Center. While a lot of this news comes from established outlets - whether CNN or BuzzFeed News, misinformation spreads on Facebook just as information does, shared by users, recommended by software and amplified by both. \nSources of spurious information has ranged from news articles produced by \"content farms\" for the sole purpose of getting clicks, to \"hyperpartisan\" sites from both sides of the political spectrum, churning out stories that are misleading at best. \nCase in point: \"FBI AGENT SUSPECTED IN HILLARY EMAIL LEAKS FOUND DEAD IN APPARENT MURDER-SUICIDE\" - a fabricated headline from a fake news site called the Denver Guardian, was shared thousands of times in the days leading up to the election. \nIs it possible that voters were swayed for or against a candidate, much like those same people might buy a product after seeing an ad on Facebook? \nZuckerberg says voters deserve more credit. \nDuring an interview Thursday with \"The Facebook Effect\" author David Kirkpatrick, Zuckerberg said idea that people voted the way they did because of bogus information on Facebook shows a \"profound lack of empathy\" for supporters of Donald Trump. \n\"Voters make decisions based on their lived experience,\" he said. \nGiven the acerbic political contest from which the country just emerged, when countless longtime friends, even family, were unfriended, many are left to wonder if there would be an alternative American history being written today if it were not for Facebook, Twitter and the like. \nThis, after all, was the first truly social media election, playing out on Twitter and Facebook as much or more than it did on major networks, in living rooms and around watercoolers. \nBut isn't social media just a reflection of our world as it exists? Has Facebook become an easy scapegoat when the answer is far more complex? \nWhile Pew found that many believe political discussions on social media to be \"uniquely angry and disrespectful,\" a comparable number have the same impression of face-to-face conversations when it comes to Democrats, the GOP, or another party. \nFILTER BUBBLE? \nWhen it comes to Facebook users, Zuckerberg said almost everyone has friends on the \"other side.\" Even if 90 percent of your friends are Democrats, for example, 10 percent will be Republican. Still, that's not a very big number, and the idea of a \"filter bubble\" - that social media allows people to surround themselves only with the people and ideas with whom they agree, has been a hot topic this election cycle. \n\"By far the biggest filter in the system is not that the content isn't there, that you don't have friends who support the other candidate or that are of another religion,\" Zuckerberg said. \"But it's that you just don't click on it. You actually tune it out when you see it. I don't know what to do about that.\" \nA DIFFICULT LINE \nFacebook has long denied that it's a publisher or a media company, or that it acts remotely like either. Its cheery slogan - to make the world more \"open and connected\" - seemingly invites a broad range of viewpoints, diverse, lively discussion and the free flow of information, rather than censorship. \nBut it could also make clamping down on fake news difficult. At a time when everyone seems entitled, not just to their own opinions, but to their own facts, one person's misleading headline might be another person's heartfelt truth. \n\"We take misinformation on Facebook very seriously,\" Adam Mosseri, the executive in charge of Facebook's news feed, said in a statement to the tech blog TechCrunch this week. \"We value authentic communication, and hear consistently from those who use Facebook that they prefer not to see misinformation.\" \nFacebook acknowledges that it has more work to do, and it seems to be putting a lot of faith in the power of data, artificial intelligence and algorithms as the solution. \nOver the summer, Facebook fired the small group of journalists in charge of its \"trending\" items and replaced them with an algorithm. The catalyst appeared to be a report in a tech blog, based on an anonymous source, that the editors routinely suppressed conservative viewpoints. \nSubsequently, fake stories ahead of the election began to trend.

      "text": "Zuckerberg: 'Crazy' to say Facebook influenced election -   Zuckerberg: 'Crazy' to say Facebook influenced election Posted: By BARBARA ORTUTAYAP Technology Writer \nNEW YORK (AP) - Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg says the idea that fake news spread on Facebook influenced the outcome of the U.S. election is \"crazy.\" \nStill, the majority of Americans (six in 10) say they get at least some news from social media , mostly Facebook, according to the Pew Research Center. While a lot of this news comes from established outlets - whether CNN or BuzzFeed News, misinformation spreads on Facebook just as information does, shared by users, recommended by software and amplified by both. \nSources of spurious information has ranged from news articles produced by \"content farms\" for the sole purpose of getting clicks, to \"hyperpartisan\" sites from both sides of the political spectrum, churning out stories that are misleading at best. \nCase in point: \"FBI AGENT SUSPECTED IN HILLARY EMAIL LEAKS FOUND DEAD IN APPARENT MURDER-SUICIDE\" - a fabricated headline from a fake news site called the Denver Guardian, was shared thousands of times in the days leading up to the election. \nIs it possible that voters were swayed for or against a candidate, much like those same people might buy a product after seeing an ad on Facebook? \nZuckerberg says voters deserve more credit. \nDuring an interview Thursday with \"The Facebook Effect\" author David Kirkpatrick, Zuckerberg said idea that people voted the way they did because of bogus information on Facebook shows a \"profound lack of empathy\" for supporters of Donald Trump. \n\"Voters make decisions based on their lived experience,\" he said. \nGiven the acerbic political contest from which the country just emerged, when countless longtime friends, even family, were unfriended, many are left to wonder if there would be an alternative American history being written today if it were not for Facebook, Twitter and the like. \nThis, after all, was the first truly social media election, playing out on Twitter and Facebook as much or more than it did on major networks, in living rooms and around watercoolers. \nBut isn't social media just a reflection of our world as it exists? Has Facebook become an easy scapegoat when the answer is far more complex? \nWhile Pew found that many believe political discussions on social media to be \"uniquely angry and disrespectful,\" a comparable number have the same impression of face-to-face conversations when it comes to Democrats, the GOP, or another party. \nFILTER BUBBLE? \nWhen it comes to Facebook users, Zuckerberg said almost everyone has friends on the \"other side.\" Even if 90 percent of your friends are Democrats, for example, 10 percent will be Republican. Still, that's not a very big number, and the idea of a \"filter bubble\" - that social media allows people to surround themselves only with the people and ideas with whom they agree, has been a hot topic this election cycle. \n\"By far the biggest filter in the system is not that the content isn't there, that you don't have friends who support the other candidate or that are of another religion,\" Zuckerberg said. \"But it's that you just don't click on it. You actually tune it out when you see it. I don't know what to do about that.\" \nA DIFFICULT LINE \nFacebook has long denied that it's a publisher or a media company, or that it acts remotely like either. Its cheery slogan - to make the world more \"open and connected\" - seemingly invites a broad range of viewpoints, diverse, lively discussion and the free flow of information, rather than censorship. \nBut it could also make clamping down on fake news difficult. At a time when everyone seems entitled, not just to their own opinions, but to their own facts, one person's misleading headline might be another person's heartfelt truth. \n\"We take misinformation on Facebook very seriously,\" Adam Mosseri, the executive in charge of Facebook's news feed, said in a statement to the tech blog TechCrunch this week. \"We value authentic communication, and hear consistently from those who use Facebook that they prefer not to see misinformation.\" \nFacebook acknowledges that it has more work to do, and it seems to be putting a lot of faith in the power of data, artificial intelligence and algorithms as the solution. \nOver the summer, Facebook fired the small group of journalists in charge of its \"trending\" items and replaced them with an algorithm. The catalyst appeared to be a report in a tech blog, based on an anonymous source, that the editors routinely suppressed conservative viewpoints. \nSubsequently, fake stories ahead of the election began to trend.

      "text": "Zuckerberg: 'Crazy' to say Facebook influenced election -   Zuckerberg: 'Crazy' to say Facebook influenced election Posted: By BARBARA ORTUTAYAP Technology Writer \nNEW YORK (AP) - Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg says the idea that fake news spread on Facebook influenced the outcome of the U.S. election is \"crazy.\" \nStill, the majority of Americans (six in 10) say they get at least some news from social media , mostly Facebook, according to the Pew Research Center. While a lot of this news comes from established outlets - whether CNN or BuzzFeed News, misinformation spreads on Facebook just as information does, shared by users, recommended by software and amplified by both. \nSources of spurious information has ranged from news articles produced by \"content farms\" for the sole purpose of getting clicks, to \"hyperpartisan\" sites from both sides of the political spectrum, churning out stories that are misleading at best. \nCase in point: \"FBI AGENT SUSPECTED IN HILLARY EMAIL LEAKS FOUND DEAD IN APPARENT MURDER-SUICIDE\" - a fabricated headline from a fake news site called the Denver Guardian, was shared thousands of times in the days leading up to the election. \nIs it possible that voters were swayed for or against a candidate, much like those same people might buy a product after seeing an ad on Facebook? \nZuckerberg says voters deserve more credit. \nDuring an interview Thursday with \"The Facebook Effect\" author David Kirkpatrick, Zuckerberg said idea that people voted the way they did because of bogus information on Facebook shows a \"profound lack of empathy\" for supporters of Donald Trump. \n\"Voters make decisions based on their lived experience,\" he said. \nGiven the acerbic political contest from which the country just emerged, when countless longtime friends, even family, were unfriended, many are left to wonder if there would be an alternative American history being written today if it were not for Facebook, Twitter and the like. \nThis, after all, was the first truly social media election, playing out on Twitter and Facebook as much or more than it did on major networks, in living rooms and around watercoolers. \nBut isn't social media just a reflection of our world as it exists? Has Facebook become an easy scapegoat when the answer is far more complex? \nWhile Pew found that many believe political discussions on social media to be \"uniquely angry and disrespectful,\" a comparable number have the same impression of face-to-face conversations when it comes to Democrats, the GOP, or another party. \nFILTER BUBBLE? \nWhen it comes to Facebook users, Zuckerberg said almost everyone has friends on the \"other side.\" Even if 90 percent of your friends are Democrats, for example, 10 percent will be Republican. Still, that's not a very big number, and the idea of a \"filter bubble\" - that social media allows people to surround themselves only with the people and ideas with whom they agree, has been a hot topic this election cycle. \n\"By far the biggest filter in the system is not that the content isn't there, that you don't have friends who support the other candidate or that are of another religion,\" Zuckerberg said. \"But it's that you just don't click on it.

Its cheery slogan - to make the world more \"open and connected\" - seemingly invites a broad range of viewpoints, diverse, lively discussion and the free flow of information, rather than censorship. \nBut it could also make clamping down on fake news difficult. At a time when everyone seems entitled, not just to their own opinions, but to their own facts, one person's misleading headline might be another person's heartfelt truth. \n\"We take misinformation on Facebook very seriously,\" Adam Mosseri, the executive in charge of Facebook's news feed, said in a statement to the tech blog TechCrunch this week. \"We value authentic communication, and hear consistently from those who use Facebook that they prefer not to see misinformation.\" \nFacebook acknowledges that it has more work to do, and it seems to be putting a lot of faith in the power of data, artificial intelligence and algorithms as the solution. \nOver the summer, Facebook fired the small group of journalists in charge of its \"trending\" items and replaced them with an algorithm. The catalyst appeared to be a report in a tech blog, based on an anonymous source, that the editors routinely suppressed conservative viewpoints. \nSubsequently, fake stories ahead of the election began to trend.

      "text": "\nThe kind of story that brings people together . \nAlyssa Galios shared the story on Facebook . She was in a Washington State Starbucks working away Wednesday morning like she often does. But she was about to witness something extraordinary this time. \nShe said the coffee shop was pretty empty except for a table with a mother and her three young children. \nAlyssa was typing away when she noticed two soldiers walk into the shop in all of their gear. The kids went silent when they saw the two men. \nAfter placing their orders, one of the soldiers turns around -- sensing a pair of young eyes. He went over to the boy and asked him how his day was going. They have a quick chat and the soldier learns that the boy's favorite superhero is Spider-Man. \nThen the soldier ripped off his velcro American flag patch and gave it to the young boy. \nThe other soldier then walked over and did the same -- giving the boy his American flag patch right off of his uniform. \nAs you can imagine, the little boy smiled wide with happiness. \nSoon after, it was time for the kids to go to school. So the boys' mother thanked the two soldiers, Edgar Gonzalez and Pedro Cordoba, profusely. \nAnd with Friday being Veterans' Day, this is a perfect reminder to thank those who've served. \nRead the full story below: ",

      "text": "Zuckerberg: 'Crazy' to say Facebook influenced election -   Zuckerberg: 'Crazy' to say Facebook influenced election By BARBARA ORTUTAYAP Technology Writer \nNEW YORK (AP) - Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg says the idea that fake news spread on Facebook influenced the outcome of the U.S. election is \"crazy.\" \nStill, the majority of Americans (six in 10) say they get at least some news from social media , mostly Facebook, according to the Pew Research Center. While a lot of this news comes from established outlets - whether CNN or BuzzFeed News, misinformation spreads on Facebook just as information does, shared by users, recommended by software and amplified by both. \nSources of spurious information has ranged from news articles produced by \"content farms\" for the sole purpose of getting clicks, to \"hyperpartisan\" sites from both sides of the political spectrum, churning out stories that are misleading at best. \nCase in point: \"FBI AGENT SUSPECTED IN HILLARY EMAIL LEAKS FOUND DEAD IN APPARENT MURDER-SUICIDE\" - a fabricated headline from a fake news site called the Denver Guardian, was shared thousands of times in the days leading up to the election. \nIs it possible that voters were swayed for or against a candidate, much like those same people might buy a product after seeing an ad on Facebook? \nZuckerberg says voters deserve more credit. \nDuring an interview Thursday with \"The Facebook Effect\" author David Kirkpatrick, Zuckerberg said idea that people voted the way they did because of bogus information on Facebook shows a \"profound lack of empathy\" for supporters of Donald Trump. \n\"Voters make decisions based on their lived experience,\" he said. \nGiven the acerbic political contest from which the country just emerged, when countless longtime friends, even family, were unfriended, many are left to wonder if there would be an alternative American history being written today if it were not for Facebook, Twitter and the like. \nThis, after all, was the first truly social media election, playing out on Twitter and Facebook as much or more than it did on major networks, in living rooms and around watercoolers. \nBut isn't social media just a reflection of our world as it exists? Has Facebook become an easy scapegoat when the answer is far more complex? \nWhile Pew found that many believe political discussions on social media to be \"uniquely angry and disrespectful,\" a comparable number have the same impression of face-to-face conversations when it comes to Democrats, the GOP, or another party. \nFILTER BUBBLE? \nWhen it comes to Facebook users, Zuckerberg said almost everyone has friends on the \"other side.\" Even if 90 percent of your friends are Democrats, for example, 10 percent will be Republican. Still, that's not a very big number, and the idea of a \"filter bubble\" - that social media allows people to surround themselves only with the people and ideas with whom they agree, has been a hot topic this election cycle. \n\"By far the biggest filter in the system is not that the content isn't there, that you don't have friends who support the other candidate or that are of another religion,\" Zuckerberg said. \"But it's that you just don't click on it. You actually tune it out when you see it. I don't know what to do about that.\" \nA DIFFICULT LINE \nFacebook has long denied that it's a publisher or a media company, or that it acts remotely like either. Its cheery slogan - to make the world more \"open and connected\" - seemingly invites a broad range of viewpoints, diverse, lively discussion and the free flow of information, rather than censorship. \nBut it could also make clamping down on fake news difficult. At a time when everyone seems entitled, not just to their own opinions, but to their own facts, one person's misleading headline might be another person's heartfelt truth. \n\"We take misinformation on Facebook very seriously,\" Adam Mosseri, the executive in charge of Facebook's news feed, said in a statement to the tech blog TechCrunch this week. \"We value authentic communication, and hear consistently from those who use Facebook that they prefer not to see misinformation.\" \nFacebook acknowledges that it has more work to do, and it seems to be putting a lot of faith in the power of data, artificial intelligence and algorithms as the solution. \nOver the summer, Facebook fired the small group of journalists in charge of its \"trending\" items and replaced them with an algorithm. The catalyst appeared to be a report in a tech blog, based on an anonymous source, that the editors routinely suppressed conservative viewpoints. \nSubsequently, fake stories ahead of the election began to trend.

By JEFF MARTIN and REBECCA REYNOLDS YONKERAssociated Press \nATLANTA (AP) - The search is on for a man in a dark blue SUV last seen where a handful of fires began in Georgia. Authorities in North Carolina suspect arson in more than 20 wildfires burning in a national forest. And in Kentucky, a wannabe weatherman faces an arson charge after police said he admitted starting a fire to draw attention to his Facebook selfie videos. \n\"It's really too bad because he's not a bad kid - he's just misguided,\" Jenkins Police Chief James Stephens said Friday after Johnny Mullins, 21, was jailed this week on a second-degree arson charge. \n\"He likes to do Facebook videos and have people follow him on his 'weather forecast,' so that's pretty much why he did what he did,\" the chief said. \"He enjoyed the attention he got from the Facebook stuff.\" \n\"He didn't realize how much danger he was putting other people in,\" Stephens added. \nNo arrests were announced in most of the rest of the suspicious fires, which have been torching forests in and around the southern Appalachian mountains. The relentless drought across much of the South has removed the usual humidity and sucked wells and streams dry, making the woods ripe for fire. \nTens of thousands of acres have burned, about a dozen of the largest fires remain uncontained and many people to evacuate their homes ahead of fast-moving flames. \nLaw officers in Georgia's Rabun County suspect that someone started a series of small roadside fires Wednesday that eventually merged into the much larger blazes firefighters were working to contain on Friday, said Justin Upchurch, the county's assistant fire chief. \nThe Rabun County sheriff's office urged people to be on the look-out, saying the SUV was last seen in the area of the fires. The office was more emphatic in a separate Facebook post, asking residents to spread the word \"and help us lock this criminal up!!!\" \nThe area is less than 50 miles from North Carolina's Nantahala National Forest, where more than 20 wildfires that have burned more than 17,000 acres are all \"being investigated for suspected arson,\" forestry officials announced in a status update. \nThere were 14 other wildfires burning on Cherokee Nation land in North Carolina, all under investigation by local law enforcement. A fire managers' update noted that the U.S. Bureau of Indian Affairs is seeking information about fires on Indian lands through an arson hotline. \nStates of emergency were declared in some of the affected areas to facilitate state and federal spending on the response. \nMore than 5,000 firefighters and support staff from around the nation have joined the effort, said Shardul Raval, director of fire and aviation management for the southern region of the U.S. Forest Service. About 40 aircraft are involved, including three large air tankers flying out of Chattanooga, Tennessee. \nThe national drought report shows 41.6 million people in parts of 15 Southern states living in drought conditions. The worst is in Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi and Tennessee, but extreme drought also is spreading into the western Carolinas. Kentucky, Tennessee and North Carolina all have fierce fires. \nOne of the largest blazes was spreading rapidly in the Cohutta Wilderness area just south of the Georgia-Tennessee line. Nearly 300 people are battling that fire, which already consumed about 15 square miles, the Forest Service said. \nSmoke from the fires has made North Carolina's largest city a Code Orange zone for air quality, meaning anyone with breathing problems could suffer. The Charlotte Observer reports that the heavy haze and smoky conditions should make people limit outdoor activities. \nThat apparently isn't stopping organizers of this weekend's Charlotte Marathon. They said Friday that they do not expect the wildfire smoke to impact Saturday's races, which include a marathon, half-marathon, 5K run/walk, marathon relay and a kids 1-mile fun run. \nReynolds Yonker reported from Louisville, Kentucky.

      "title": "Zuckerberg: 'Crazy' to say Facebook influenced election",
      "text": "Zuckerberg: 'Crazy' to say Facebook influenced election -   Zuckerberg: 'Crazy' to say Facebook influenced election By BARBARA ORTUTAYAP Technology Writer \nNEW YORK (AP) - Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg says the idea that fake news spread on Facebook influenced the outcome of the U.S. election is \"crazy.\" \nStill, the majority of Americans (six in 10) say they get at least some news from social media , mostly Facebook, according to the Pew Research Center. While a lot of this news comes from established outlets - whether CNN or BuzzFeed News, misinformation spreads on Facebook just as information does, shared by users, recommended by software and amplified by both. \nSources of spurious information has ranged from news articles produced by \"content farms\" for the sole purpose of getting clicks, to \"hyperpartisan\" sites from both sides of the political spectrum, churning out stories that are misleading at best. \nCase in point: \"FBI AGENT SUSPECTED IN HILLARY EMAIL LEAKS FOUND DEAD IN APPARENT MURDER-SUICIDE\" - a fabricated headline from a fake news site called the Denver Guardian, was shared thousands of times in the days leading up to the election. \nIs it possible that voters were swayed for or against a candidate, much like those same people might buy a product after seeing an ad on Facebook? \nZuckerberg says voters deserve more credit. \nDuring an interview Thursday with \"The Facebook Effect\" author David Kirkpatrick, Zuckerberg said idea that people voted the way they did because of bogus information on Facebook shows a \"profound lack of empathy\" for supporters of Donald Trump. \n\"Voters make decisions based on their lived experience,\" he said. \nGiven the acerbic political contest from which the country just emerged, when countless longtime friends, even family, were unfriended, many are left to wonder if there would be an alternative American history being written today if it were not for Facebook, Twitter and the like. \nThis, after all, was the first truly social media election, playing out on Twitter and Facebook as much or more than it did on major networks, in living rooms and around watercoolers. \nBut isn't social media just a reflection of our world as it exists? Has Facebook become an easy scapegoat when the answer is far more complex? \nWhile Pew found that many believe political discussions on social media to be \"uniquely angry and disrespectful,\" a comparable number have the same impression of face-to-face conversations when it comes to Democrats, the GOP, or another party. \nFILTER BUBBLE? \nWhen it comes to Facebook users, Zuckerberg said almost everyone has friends on the \"other side.\" Even if 90 percent of your friends are Democrats, for example, 10 percent will be Republican. Still, that's not a very big number, and the idea of a \"filter bubble\" - that social media allows people to surround themselves only with the people and ideas with whom they agree, has been a hot topic this election cycle. \n\"By far the biggest filter in the system is not that the content isn't there, that you don't have friends who support the other candidate or that are of another religion,\" Zuckerberg said. \"But it's that you just don't click on it. You actually tune it out when you see it. I don't know what to do about that.\" \nA DIFFICULT LINE \nFacebook has long denied that it's a publisher or a media company, or that it acts remotely like either. Its cheery slogan - to make the world more \"open and connected\" - seemingly invites a broad range of viewpoints, diverse, lively discussion and the free flow of information, rather than censorship. \nBut it could also make clamping down on fake news difficult. At a time when everyone seems entitled, not just to their own opinions, but to their own facts, one person's misleading headline might be another person's heartfelt truth. \n\"We take misinformation on Facebook very seriously,\" Adam Mosseri, the executive in charge of Facebook's news feed, said in a statement to the tech blog TechCrunch this week. \"We value authentic communication, and hear consistently from those who use Facebook that they prefer not to see misinformation.\" \nFacebook acknowledges that it has more work to do, and it seems to be putting a lot of faith in the power of data, artificial intelligence and algorithms as the solution. \nOver the summer, Facebook fired the small group of journalists in charge of its \"trending\" items and replaced them with an algorithm. The catalyst appeared to be a report in a tech blog, based on an anonymous source, that the editors routinely suppressed conservative viewpoints. \nSubsequently, fake stories ahead of the election began to trend.

But Facebook might think you are. \nFacebook is notifying users they are dead, according to widespread reports across social media. \nMany people are seeing a banner on certain profiles that reads: \"We hope people who love Mark will find comfort in the things others share to remember and celebrate his life.\" \nNot all profiles were affected -- I'm still alive according to my pulse and Facebook. But at one point, even Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg was declared dead by his own social network. \nIt's unclear what's causing the mass obituaries, but it's likely a bug in Facebook's system. The company did not return a request for comment by press time. \nBy Selena Larson \nThe-CNN-Wire™&© 2016 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company. All rights reserved. Can't Find Something?",

By JEFF MARTIN and REBECCA REYNOLDS YONKERAssociated Press \nATLANTA (AP) - The search is on for a man in a dark blue SUV last seen where a handful of fires began in Georgia. Authorities in North Carolina suspect arson in more than 20 wildfires burning in a national forest. And in Kentucky, a wannabe weatherman faces an arson charge after police said he admitted starting a fire to draw attention to his Facebook selfie videos. \n\"It's really too bad because he's not a bad kid - he's just misguided,\" Jenkins Police Chief James Stephens said Friday after Johnny Mullins, 21, was jailed this week on a second-degree arson charge. \n\"He likes to do Facebook videos and have people follow him on his 'weather forecast,' so that's pretty much why he did what he did,\" the chief said. \"He enjoyed the attention he got from the Facebook stuff.\" \n\"He didn't realize how much danger he was putting other people in,\" Stephens added. \nNo arrests were announced in most of the rest of the suspicious fires, which have been torching forests in and around the southern Appalachian mountains. The relentless drought across much of the South has removed the usual humidity and sucked wells and streams dry, making the woods ripe for fire. \nTens of thousands of acres have burned, about a dozen of the largest fires remain uncontained and many people to evacuate their homes ahead of fast-moving flames. \nLaw officers in Georgia's Rabun County suspect that someone started a series of small roadside fires Wednesday that eventually merged into the much larger blazes firefighters were working to contain on Friday, said Justin Upchurch, the county's assistant fire chief. \nThe Rabun County sheriff's office urged people to be on the look-out, saying the SUV was last seen in the area of the fires. The office was more emphatic in a separate Facebook post, asking residents to spread the word \"and help us lock this criminal up!!!\" \nThe area is less than 50 miles from North Carolina's Nantahala National Forest, where more than 20 wildfires that have burned more than 17,000 acres are all \"being investigated for suspected arson,\" forestry officials announced in a status update. \nThere were 14 other wildfires burning on Cherokee Nation land in North Carolina, all under investigation by local law enforcement. A fire managers' update noted that the U.S. Bureau of Indian Affairs is seeking information about fires on Indian lands through an arson hotline. \nStates of emergency were declared in some of the affected areas to facilitate state and federal spending on the response. \nMore than 5,000 firefighters and support staff from around the nation have joined the effort, said Shardul Raval, director of fire and aviation management for the southern region of the U.S. Forest Service. About 40 aircraft are involved, including three large air tankers flying out of Chattanooga, Tennessee. \nThe national drought report shows 41.6 million people in parts of 15 Southern states living in drought conditions. The worst is in Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi and Tennessee, but extreme drought also is spreading into the western Carolinas. Kentucky, Tennessee and North Carolina all have fierce fires. \nOne of the largest blazes was spreading rapidly in the Cohutta Wilderness area just south of the Georgia-Tennessee line. Nearly 300 people are battling that fire, which already consumed about 15 square miles, the Forest Service said. \nSmoke from the fires has made North Carolina's largest city a Code Orange zone for air quality, meaning anyone with breathing problems could suffer. The Charlotte Observer reports that the heavy haze and smoky conditions should make people limit outdoor activities. \nThat apparently isn't stopping organizers of this weekend's Charlotte Marathon. They said Friday that they do not expect the wildfire smoke to impact Saturday's races, which include a marathon, half-marathon, 5K run/walk, marathon relay and a kids 1-mile fun run. \n___ \nReynolds Yonker reported from Louisville, Kentucky.

      "text": "Not for a moment. (AP Photo/Eric Risberg) Share Mike Murphy 38 mins ago \nIn a bizarre twist after a strange week, it seems that we are all dead. That is according to Facebook, at least. \nLike something out of an M. Knight Shyamalan film, Facebook appears to have briefly turned the vast majority of its users’ profile pages into memorial pages Nov. 11. \nIt’s unclear why Facebook activated this feature for just about everyone: Oh my god FACEBOOK KILLED EVERYONE pic.twitter.com/UGPfYQj6DA \n— Mike Murphy (@mcwm) November 11, 2016 Well it's a Friday in 2016 so this pretty much should have been expected #amidead pic.twitter.com/OQhyfZEDC2 \n— Beth Ponsot (@bponsot) November 11, 2016 There was an extinction level event on Facebook pic.twitter.com/xxkr1t1ptC \n— Anthony Quintano (@AnthonyQuintano) November 11, 2016 in other news, Facebook's algorithm thinks that i ****died**** based on the messages i'm getting #RIPme pic.twitter.com/IfoCDumNCi \n— Elaine Filadelfo (@ElaineF) November 11, 2016 Best way to avoid fake news on Facebook is to die. pic.twitter.com/OabPhT57Ty \n— Peter Kafka (@pkafka) November 11, 2016 Thought this week couldn’t get any worse, huh? Congrats you’re dead \n— Alex Heath (@alexeheath) November 11, 2016 \nFacebook wasn’t immediately available to comment on what is presumably a glitch, unless in his attempt to rid the entire world of disease , CEO Mark Zuckerberg felt it necessary to kill us all. \nIncluding himself: \n— Steve Kovach (@stevekovach) November 11, 2016 \nRoughly three months ago, as part of a Facebook hackathon that Mark Zuckerberg attended, a group pitched him an improved way to memorialize those that have died. It’s entirely possible that this new memorial feature could be the result of an attempt implement this or a similar idea. \nIt appears that people that have actually passed away and still have Facebook pages are not experiencing the current glitch. Right now, when a family wishes to keep the page alive as a way for loved ones that have passed away, Facebook just adds a line above their name saying “Remembering.” \nThe glitch only lasted a short while, and it appears that Facebook has returned its users to the world of the living. You know, falsely reporting that a loved one is dead is a tort https://t.co/epoc0NfVXs \n— Ryan Calo (@rcalo) November 11, 2016 Read full story",

Zuckerberg says the idea that people voted the way they did because they saw a fake news story shows \"profound lack of empathy\" for people who voted for Donald Trump.

By JEFF MARTIN and REBECCA REYNOLDS YONKERAssociated Press \nATLANTA (AP) - The search is on for a man in a dark blue SUV last seen where a handful of fires began in Georgia. Authorities in North Carolina suspect arson in more than 20 wildfires burning in a national forest. And in Kentucky, a wannabe weatherman faces an arson charge after police said he admitted starting a fire to draw attention to his Facebook selfie videos. \n\"It's really too bad because he's not a bad kid - he's just misguided,\" Jenkins Police Chief James Stephens said Friday after Johnny Mullins, 21, was jailed this week on a second-degree arson charge. \n\"He likes to do Facebook videos and have people follow him on his 'weather forecast,' so that's pretty much why he did what he did,\" the chief said. \"He enjoyed the attention he got from the Facebook stuff.\" \n\"He didn't realize how much danger he was putting other people in,\" Stephens added. \nNo arrests were announced in most of the rest of the suspicious fires, which have been torching forests in and around the southern Appalachian mountains. The relentless drought across much of the South has removed the usual humidity and sucked wells and streams dry, making the woods ripe for fire. \nTens of thousands of acres have burned, about a dozen of the largest fires remain uncontained and many people to evacuate their homes ahead of fast-moving flames. \nLaw officers in Georgia's Rabun County suspect that someone started a series of small roadside fires Wednesday that eventually merged into the much larger blazes firefighters were working to contain on Friday, said Justin Upchurch, the county's assistant fire chief. \nThe Rabun County sheriff's office urged people to be on the look-out, saying the SUV was last seen in the area of the fires. The office was more emphatic in a separate Facebook post, asking residents to spread the word \"and help us lock this criminal up!!!\" \nThe area is less than 50 miles from North Carolina's Nantahala National Forest, where more than 20 wildfires that have burned more than 17,000 acres are all \"being investigated for suspected arson,\" forestry officials announced in a status update. \nThere were 14 other wildfires burning on Cherokee Nation land in North Carolina, all under investigation by local law enforcement. A fire managers' update noted that the U.S. Bureau of Indian Affairs is seeking information about fires on Indian lands through an arson hotline. \nStates of emergency were declared in some of the affected areas to facilitate state and federal spending on the response. \nMore than 5,000 firefighters and support staff from around the nation have joined the effort, said Shardul Raval, director of fire and aviation management for the southern region of the U.S. Forest Service. About 40 aircraft are involved, including three large air tankers flying out of Chattanooga, Tennessee. \nThe national drought report shows 41.6 million people in parts of 15 Southern states living in drought conditions. The worst is in Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi and Tennessee, but extreme drought also is spreading into the western Carolinas. Kentucky, Tennessee and North Carolina all have fierce fires. \nOne of the largest blazes was spreading rapidly in the Cohutta Wilderness area just south of the Georgia-Tennessee line. Nearly 300 people are battling that fire, which already consumed about 15 square miles, the Forest Service said. \nSmoke from the fires has made North Carolina's largest city a Code Orange zone for air quality, meaning anyone with breathing problems could suffer. The Charlotte Observer reports that the heavy haze and smoky conditions should make people limit outdoor activities. \nThat apparently isn't stopping organizers of this weekend's Charlotte Marathon. They said Friday that they do not expect the wildfire smoke to impact Saturday's races, which include a marathon, half-marathon, 5K run/walk, marathon relay and a kids 1-mile fun run. \nReynolds Yonker reported from Louisville, Kentucky. Contributors include Associated Press writers Martha Waggoner in Raleigh and Tom Foreman Jr., in Charlotte, North Carolina; and Jonathan Mattise in Nashville, Tennessee.

      "text": "Zuckerberg: 'Crazy' to say Facebook influenced election - WAFB 9 News Baton Rouge, Louisiana News, Weather, Sports Member Center: Zuckerberg: 'Crazy' to say Facebook influenced election By BARBARA ORTUTAYAP Technology Writer \nNEW YORK (AP) - Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg says the idea that fake news spread on Facebook influenced the outcome of the U.S. election is \"crazy.\" \nStill, the majority of Americans (six in 10) say they get at least some news from social media , mostly Facebook, according to the Pew Research Center. While a lot of this news comes from established outlets - whether CNN or BuzzFeed News, misinformation spreads on Facebook just as information does, shared by users, recommended by software and amplified by both. \nSources of spurious information has ranged from news articles produced by \"content farms\" for the sole purpose of getting clicks, to \"hyperpartisan\" sites from both sides of the political spectrum, churning out stories that are misleading at best. \nCase in point: \"FBI AGENT SUSPECTED IN HILLARY EMAIL LEAKS FOUND DEAD IN APPARENT MURDER-SUICIDE\" - a fabricated headline from a fake news site called the Denver Guardian, was shared thousands of times in the days leading up to the election. \nIs it possible that voters were swayed for or against a candidate, much like those same people might buy a product after seeing an ad on Facebook? \nZuckerberg says voters deserve more credit. \nDuring an interview Thursday with \"The Facebook Effect\" author David Kirkpatrick, Zuckerberg said idea that people voted the way they did because of bogus information on Facebook shows a \"profound lack of empathy\" for supporters of Donald Trump. \n\"Voters make decisions based on their lived experience,\" he said. \nGiven the acerbic political contest from which the country just emerged, when countless longtime friends, even family, were unfriended, many are left to wonder if there would be an alternative American history being written today if it were not for Facebook, Twitter and the like. \nThis, after all, was the first truly social media election, playing out on Twitter and Facebook as much or more than it did on major networks, in living rooms and around watercoolers. \nBut isn't social media just a reflection of our world as it exists? Has Facebook become an easy scapegoat when the answer is far more complex? \nWhile Pew found that many believe political discussions on social media to be \"uniquely angry and disrespectful,\" a comparable number have the same impression of face-to-face conversations when it comes to Democrats, the GOP, or another party. \nFILTER BUBBLE? \nWhen it comes to Facebook users, Zuckerberg said almost everyone has friends on the \"other side.\" Even if 90 percent of your friends are Democrats, for example, 10 percent will be Republican. Still, that's not a very big number, and the idea of a \"filter bubble\" - that social media allows people to surround themselves only with the people and ideas with whom they agree, has been a hot topic this election cycle. \n\"By far the biggest filter in the system is not that the content isn't there, that you don't have friends who support the other candidate or that are of another religion,\" Zuckerberg said. \"But it's that you just don't click on it. You actually tune it out when you see it. I don't know what to do about that.\" \nA DIFFICULT LINE \nFacebook has long denied that it's a publisher or a media company, or that it acts remotely like either. Its cheery slogan - to make the world more \"open and connected\" - seemingly invites a broad range of viewpoints, diverse, lively discussion and the free flow of information, rather than censorship. \nBut it could also make clamping down on fake news difficult. At a time when everyone seems entitled, not just to their own opinions, but to their own facts, one person's misleading headline might be another person's heartfelt truth. \n\"We take misinformation on Facebook very seriously,\" Adam Mosseri, the executive in charge of Facebook's news feed, said in a statement to the tech blog TechCrunch this week. \"We value authentic communication, and hear consistently from those who use Facebook that they prefer not to see misinformation.\" \nFacebook acknowledges that it has more work to do, and it seems to be putting a lot of faith in the power of data, artificial intelligence and algorithms as the solution. \nOver the summer, Facebook fired the small group of journalists in charge of its \"trending\" items and replaced them with an algorithm. The catalyst appeared to be a report in a tech blog, based on an anonymous source, that the editors routinely suppressed conservative viewpoints. \nSubsequently, fake stories ahead of the election began to trend.

      "text": "Facebook I had a relationship that ended 5 years ago due to being on different pages in life. The relationship itself was light, fun and we never had an argument. He moved overseas i was going to come for part of it but it didn't work and i think he wanted to do it on his own being only 21 at the time. At the time i think i was getting over someone else still so i didn't completely invest in the relationship and found him too immature to have a future with.1.5 year later he returned we caught up one night had sex and he attempted to catch up but i was shy and he hadn't changed so i backed off.1 year later we tried again, he did not want to have sex though as he \"wanted to make a good impression\". He said he was shy, hurt that i never said i loved him and that he wasn't close to my family. He said we should work on things and that was it.I could have made a move but as he broke up with me i felt i need him to do the putting back together.2 years later (present). I've finished university moved out of home and am looking for jobs in my field. He is different too; he doesn't enjoy partying as much, he bought a house, and he now owns a 1/3 of the business he works for.I spent a rather nice night with him, both of us were quite nervous and shy. He stayed over and we had sex, and he wanted to cuddle all night. In the morning i could tell he wanted to have a serious conversation but could not get the words out. Eventually he asked \" Do you want to catch up again\". In my head i was screaming YES, but it came out as a casual yes.I can see that this has the potential to go as before, i. e. nothing eventuates. However this time we are both different. I am thinking that i should ask him to catch up this week so he knows i am definitely interested however I don't know how to go about it what to say and when to do it, or if he was even serious.He stayed at mine on Friday and it is now Saturday night, is it too early or late or should i wait and see if he asks first?

Show Caption Previous Next \nHundreds of (living) Facebook users on Friday were asked by the social media site if they had died. \nMany users were prompted with a message on Friday afternoon asking if they would like to turn their pages into an online memorial. \nThe site will \"memorialize\" a dead person's profile upon the request of a loved one. According to Facebook's help center , Facebook needs to be notified in order for an account to be memorialized. \nThousands of people took to social media to notify friends and family of their own passing on Friday afternoon. \nFacebook is telling all my friends we're dead, which is appropriate because I had a feeling we were all in hell anyway. pic.twitter.com/0WPGi95omv — Chris Person (@Papapishu) November 11, 2016",

By JEFF MARTIN and REBECCA REYNOLDS YONKERAssociated Press \nATLANTA (AP) - A wannabe weatherman was jailed for arson after admitting he started a wildfire to draw attention to his selfie videos on Facebook, his town's police chief said Friday. Meanwhile, a Georgia sheriff appealed for help identifying the driver of a dark blue SUV last seen where other wildfires began. And in North Carolina, authorities suspect arson in more than 20 wildfires burning in a national forest. \n\"It's really too bad because he's not a bad kid - he's just misguided,\" said James Stephens, the police chief in Jenkins, Kentucky, where Johnny Mullins, 21, was arrested this week on a second-degree arson charge. \n\"He likes to do Facebook videos and have people follow him on his 'weather forecast,' so that's pretty much why he did what he did,\" the chief said. \"He enjoyed the attention he got from the Facebook stuff.\" \n\"He didn't realize how much danger he was putting other people in,\" Stephens added. \nA teenager in Harlan County, Kentucky also was arrested for arson this week, and in Tennessee, authorities said Friday that Andrew Scott Lewis was charged with setting fires and vandalism causing more than $250,000 in damage and threatening homes outside Chattanooga. \nNo arrests were announced in most of the rest of the suspicious fires, which have been torching forests in and around the southern Appalachian mountains. The relentless drought across much of the South has removed the usual humidity and sucked wells and streams dry, making the woods ripe for fire. \nTens of thousands of acres have burned, about a dozen of the largest fires remain uncontained and many people to evacuate their homes ahead of fast-moving flames. \nLaw officers in Georgia's Rabun County suspect that someone started a series of small roadside fires Wednesday that eventually merged into the much larger blazes firefighters were working to contain on Friday, said Justin Upchurch, the county's assistant fire chief. \nThe Rabun County sheriff's office urged people to be on the look-out, saying the SUV was last seen in the area of the fires. The office was more emphatic in a separate Facebook post, asking residents to spread the word \"and help us lock this criminal up!!!\" \nThe area is less than 50 miles from North Carolina's Nantahala National Forest, where more than 20 wildfires that have burned more than 17,000 acres are all \"being investigated for suspected arson,\" forestry officials announced in a status update. \nThere were 14 other wildfires burning on Cherokee Nation land in North Carolina, all under investigation by local law enforcement. A fire managers' update noted that the U.S. Bureau of Indian Affairs is seeking information about fires on Indian lands through an arson hotline. \nStates of emergency were declared in some of the affected areas to facilitate state and federal spending on the response. \nMore than 5,000 firefighters and support staff from around the nation have joined the effort, said Shardul Raval, director of fire and aviation management for the southern region of the U.S. Forest Service. \nSmoke from the fires has made North Carolina's largest city a Code Orange zone for air quality, meaning anyone with breathing problems could suffer. The Charlotte Observer reports that the heavy haze and smoky conditions should make people limit outdoor activities. \nThat apparently isn't stopping organizers of this weekend's Charlotte Marathon. They said Friday that they do not expect the wildfire smoke to impact Saturday's races, which include a marathon, half-marathon, 5K run/walk, marathon relay and a kids 1-mile fun run. \n___ \nReynolds Yonker reported from Louisville, Kentucky.

      "text": "Facebook's advertising home page.\nPhoto by Screenshot by Laura Hautala/CNET Advertising housing, jobs or credit in a way that excludes people based on their race or ethnicity? That's illegal, and Facebook responded Friday to fears that it was allowing advertisers to do just that.\nThe social-media company said in a blog post that it won't let advertisers use its \"ethnic affinity groups\" in ads that focus on those three legally protected categories.\n\"There are many nondiscriminatory uses of our ethnic affinity solution in these areas, but we have decided that we can best guard against discrimination by suspending these types of ads,\" wrote Erin Egan, vice president of US public policy and chief privacy officer at Facebook.\nThe groups aren't exactly based on the user's ethnic identity, but rather on what the user likes, dislikes and interacts with on Facebook. Those data points let the social network make the call that one user likes products that tend to appeal to a certain ethnic group.\nThe change comes two weeks after a report from ProPublica raised the fear that Facebook's tool was letting advertisers exclude users based on their racial or ethnic identity. The publication had been able to successfully exclude users in the Asian American, Hispanic and African American affinity groups when it purchased an ad for an event about fighting illegally high rents.\nThe ad ProPublica purchased would still be allowed under the new Facebook policy, because it was for a housing-related event and not for a house or apartment that was for sale or rent.\nSimilarly, the new rule might not apply to job coaching services, said Michael Carl Tschantz, a researcher at UC Berkeley who studies targeting in online advertising.\n\"There are many services that act as intermediaries between employees and employers; it's not clear whether they're recruiting firms or not,\" he said. These legal gray areas create pockets of housing- and job-related advertising that might be allowed to target users based on racial or ethnic groups.\nFacebook is also facing a class-action lawsuit that claims the advertising tool is discriminatory.",

EST November 11, 2016 Source: Facebook CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST \nChocolate lovers, or anyone with a sweet tooth for that matter, have every right to want to move to Italy right at this moment. \nMcDonald’s in Italy decided to up the ante on its dessert menu by introducing a Nutella burger on the fast-food chain’s Facebook page Thursday. \nThe post has generated over 59,000 likes and 57,000 comments on Facebook. \nThe “burger,\" known as the Sweety Con, appears to feature a sweet bun with a blob of the hazelnut cholocate spread injected inside. The translated Facebook post reads, “A soft sweetness has arrived that you will not be able to resist. Try Sweety with Nutella now: soft bread with a creamy, indulgent center!” \nCopyright 2016 WCNC",

      "text": "Real Estate Zuckerberg: ‘Crazy’ to say Facebook influenced election Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg delivers the keynote address at the F8 Facebook Developer Conference, in San Francisco. (AP Photo/Eric Risberg, File) \nBy BARBARA ORTUTAY, AP Technology Writer \n  1:46 PM A A \nNEW YORK — Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg says the idea that fake news spread on Facebook influenced the outcome of the U.S. election is “crazy.” \nStill, the majority of Americans (six in 10) say they get at least some news from social media , mostly Facebook, according to the Pew Research Center. While a lot of this news comes from established outlets — whether CNN or BuzzFeed News, misinformation spreads on Facebook just as information does, shared by users, recommended by software and amplified by both. \nSources of spurious information has ranged from news articles produced by “content farms” for the sole purpose of getting clicks, to “hyperpartisan” sites from both sides of the political spectrum, churning out stories that are misleading at best. \nCase in point: “FBI AGENT SUSPECTED IN HILLARY EMAIL LEAKS FOUND DEAD IN APPARENT MURDER-SUICIDE”— a fabricated headline from a fake news site called the Denver Guardian, was shared thousands of times in the days leading up to the election. \nIs it possible that voters were swayed for or against a candidate, much like those same people might buy a product after seeing an ad on Facebook? \nZuckerberg says voters deserve more credit. \nDuring an interview Thursday with “The Facebook Effect” author David Kirkpatrick, Zuckerberg said idea that people voted the way they did because of bogus information on Facebook shows a “profound lack of empathy” for supporters of Donald Trump. \n“Voters make decisions based on their lived experience,” he said. \nGiven the acerbic political contest from which the country just emerged, when countless longtime friends, even family, were unfriended, many are left to wonder if there would be an alternative American history being written today if it were not for Facebook, Twitter and the like. \nThis, after all, was the first truly social media election, playing out on Twitter and Facebook as much or more than it did on major networks, in living rooms and around watercoolers. \nBut isn’t social media just a reflection of our world as it exists? Has Facebook become an easy scapegoat when the answer is far more complex? \nWhile Pew found that many believe political discussions on social media to be “uniquely angry and disrespectful,” a comparable number have the same impression of face-to-face conversations when it comes to Democrats, the GOP, or another party. \nFILTER BUBBLE? \nWhen it comes to Facebook users, Zuckerberg said almost everyone has friends on the “other side.” Even if 90 percent of your friends are Democrats, for example, 10 percent will be Republican. Still, that’s not a very big number, and the idea of a “filter bubble”— that social media allows people to surround themselves only with the people and ideas with whom they agree, has been a hot topic this election cycle. \n“By far the biggest filter in the system is not that the content isn’t there, that you don’t have friends who support the other candidate or that are of another religion,” Zuckerberg said. “But it’s that you just don’t click on it. You actually tune it out when you see it. I don’t know what to do about that.” \nA DIFFICULT LINE \nFacebook has long denied that it’s a publisher or a media company, or that it acts remotely like either. Its cheery slogan — to make the world more “open and connected”— seemingly invites a broad range of viewpoints, diverse, lively discussion and the free flow of information, rather than censorship. \nBut it could also make clamping down on fake news difficult. At a time when everyone seems entitled, not just to their own opinions, but to their own facts, one person’s misleading headline might be another person’s heartfelt truth. \n“We take misinformation on Facebook very seriously,” Adam Mosseri, the executive in charge of Facebook’s news feed, said in a statement to the tech blog TechCrunch this week. “We value authentic communication, and hear consistently from those who use Facebook that they prefer not to see misinformation.” \nFacebook acknowledges that it has more work to do, and it seems to be putting a lot of faith in the power of data, artificial intelligence and algorithms as the solution. \nOver the summer, Facebook fired the small group of journalists in charge of its “trending” items and replaced them with an algorithm. The catalyst appeared to be a report in a tech blog, based on an anonymous source, that the editors routinely suppressed conservative viewpoints. \nSubsequently, fake stories ahead of the election began to trend.",

More >> By BARBARA ORTUTAYAP Technology Writer \nNEW YORK (AP) - Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg says the idea that fake news spread on Facebook influenced the outcome of the U.S. election is \"crazy.\" \nStill, the majority of Americans (six in 10) say they get at least some news from social media , mostly Facebook, according to the Pew Research Center. While a lot of this news comes from established outlets - whether CNN or BuzzFeed News, misinformation spreads on Facebook just as information does, shared by users, recommended by software and amplified by both. \nSources of spurious information has ranged from news articles produced by \"content farms\" for the sole purpose of getting clicks, to \"hyperpartisan\" sites from both sides of the political spectrum, churning out stories that are misleading at best. \nCase in point: \"FBI AGENT SUSPECTED IN HILLARY EMAIL LEAKS FOUND DEAD IN APPARENT MURDER-SUICIDE\" - a fabricated headline from a fake news site called the Denver Guardian, was shared thousands of times in the days leading up to the election. \nIs it possible that voters were swayed for or against a candidate, much like those same people might buy a product after seeing an ad on Facebook? \nZuckerberg says voters deserve more credit. \nDuring an interview Thursday with \"The Facebook Effect\" author David Kirkpatrick, Zuckerberg said idea that people voted the way they did because of bogus information on Facebook shows a \"profound lack of empathy\" for supporters of Donald Trump. \n\"Voters make decisions based on their lived experience,\" he said. \nGiven the acerbic political contest from which the country just emerged, when countless longtime friends, even family, were unfriended, many are left to wonder if there would be an alternative American history being written today if it were not for Facebook, Twitter and the like. \nThis, after all, was the first truly social media election, playing out on Twitter and Facebook as much or more than it did on major networks, in living rooms and around watercoolers. \nBut isn't social media just a reflection of our world as it exists? Has Facebook become an easy scapegoat when the answer is far more complex? \nWhile Pew found that many believe political discussions on social media to be \"uniquely angry and disrespectful,\" a comparable number have the same impression of face-to-face conversations when it comes to Democrats, the GOP, or another party. \nFILTER BUBBLE? \nWhen it comes to Facebook users, Zuckerberg said almost everyone has friends on the \"other side.\" Even if 90 percent of your friends are Democrats, for example, 10 percent will be Republican. Still, that's not a very big number, and the idea of a \"filter bubble\" - that social media allows people to surround themselves only with the people and ideas with whom they agree, has been a hot topic this election cycle. \n\"By far the biggest filter in the system is not that the content isn't there, that you don't have friends who support the other candidate or that are of another religion,\" Zuckerberg said. \"But it's that you just don't click on it. You actually tune it out when you see it. I don't know what to do about that.\" \nA DIFFICULT LINE \nFacebook has long denied that it's a publisher or a media company, or that it acts remotely like either. Its cheery slogan - to make the world more \"open and connected\" - seemingly invites a broad range of viewpoints, diverse, lively discussion and the free flow of information, rather than censorship. \nBut it could also make clamping down on fake news difficult. At a time when everyone seems entitled, not just to their own opinions, but to their own facts, one person's misleading headline might be another person's heartfelt truth. \n\"We take misinformation on Facebook very seriously,\" Adam Mosseri, the executive in charge of Facebook's news feed, said in a statement to the tech blog TechCrunch this week. \"We value authentic communication, and hear consistently from those who use Facebook that they prefer not to see misinformation.\" \nFacebook acknowledges that it has more work to do, and it seems to be putting a lot of faith in the power of data, artificial intelligence and algorithms as the solution. \nOver the summer, Facebook fired the small group of journalists in charge of its \"trending\" items and replaced them with an algorithm. The catalyst appeared to be a report in a tech blog, based on an anonymous source, that the editors routinely suppressed conservative viewpoints. \nSubsequently, fake stories ahead of the election began to trend.

Meanwhile, a Georgia sheriff appealed for help identifying the driver of a dark blue SUV last seen where other wildfires began. And in North Carolina, authorities suspect arson in more than 20 wildfires burning in a national forest. \n\"It's really too bad because he's not a bad kid - he's just misguided,\" said James Stephens, the police chief in Jenkins, Kentucky, where Johnny Mullins, 21, was arrested this week on a second-degree arson charge. \n\"He likes to do Facebook videos and have people follow him on his 'weather forecast,' so that's pretty much why he did what he did,\" the chief said. \"He enjoyed the attention he got from the Facebook stuff.\" \n\"He didn't realize how much danger he was putting other people in,\" Stephens added. \nA teenager in Harlan County, Kentucky also was arrested for arson this week, and in Tennessee, authorities said Friday that Andrew Scott Lewis was charged with setting fires and vandalism causing more than $250,000 in damage and threatening homes outside Chattanooga. \nNo arrests were announced in most of the rest of the suspicious fires, which have been torching forests in and around the southern Appalachian mountains. The relentless drought across much of the South has removed the usual humidity and sucked wells and streams dry, making the woods ripe for fire. \nTens of thousands of acres have burned, about a dozen of the largest fires remain uncontained and many people to evacuate their homes ahead of fast-moving flames. \nLaw officers in Georgia's Rabun County suspect that someone started a series of small roadside fires Wednesday that eventually merged into the much larger blazes firefighters were working to contain on Friday, said Justin Upchurch, the county's assistant fire chief. \nThe Rabun County sheriff's office urged people to be on the look-out, saying the SUV was last seen in the area of the fires. The office was more emphatic in a separate Facebook post, asking residents to spread the word \"and help us lock this criminal up!!!\" \nThe area is less than 50 miles from North Carolina's Nantahala National Forest, where more than 20 wildfires that have burned more than 17,000 acres are all \"being investigated for suspected arson,\" forestry officials announced in a status update. \nThere were 14 other wildfires burning on Cherokee Nation land in North Carolina, all under investigation by local law enforcement. A fire managers' update noted that the U.S. Bureau of Indian Affairs is seeking information about fires on Indian lands through an arson hotline. \nStates of emergency were declared in some of the affected areas to facilitate state and federal spending on the response. \nMore than 5,000 firefighters and support staff from around the nation have joined the effort, said Shardul Raval, director of fire and aviation management for the southern region of the U.S. Forest Service. \nSmoke from the fires has made North Carolina's largest city a Code Orange zone for air quality, meaning anyone with breathing problems could suffer. The Charlotte Observer reports that the heavy haze and smoky conditions should make people limit outdoor activities. \nThat apparently isn't stopping organizers of this weekend's Charlotte Marathon. They said Friday that they do not expect the wildfire smoke to impact Saturday's races, which include a marathon, half-marathon, 5K run/walk, marathon relay and a kids 1-mile fun run. \n___ \nReynolds Yonker reported from Louisville, Kentucky.

      "text": "In News by Jordan Freiman   @jordanfreiman \nFacebook accidentally killed a bunch of users on Friday with a weird glitch that set the pages of perfectly alive people to memorial mode . It was creepy as hell, and not even Mark Zuckerberg was immune from the bug. \nOnce we shuffle off this mortal coil, everyone’s mother’s favorite social network allows the option to mark the dearly departed’s profile as inactive, at which point the profile turns into a digital memorial wall of sorts. A banner shows up at the top reading “Remembering [Person]: We hope people who love [Person] will find comfort in the things others share to remember and celebrate [his/her] life.” It’s weird to see your own memorial or obituary, but hey, it happened to Alfred Nobel and now 128 years later we’re all arguing about Bob Dylan because of him, so some good may come of this yet. \n— Steve Kovach (@stevekovach) November 11, 2016 \nMark Zuckerberg — for the record — is not dead, despite what his own website would have you believe. So if you saw a dear friend or cherished loved one had passed on today, first off it means everyone else thought you were dead too. Apparently only dead people could see other dead people’s profiles and alive people were stuck with their brethren in the land of the living. So after you make sure everyone knows you yourself are alive, go ahead and double check on anybody else you thought may have passed on. Really verify that the info you got was accurate, as you should also be doing whenever you see a news story in Facebook’s trending topics. Facebook thinks I'm dead, which is about as accurate as its ability to share factual news pic.twitter.com/bXIoNTwWX8 \n— Jarett Wieselman (@JarettSays) November 11, 2016 Why TF does Facebook think I'm dead? pic.twitter.com/kA3WtHc9z9 \n— Akilah Hughes (@AkilahObviously) November 11, 2016 I have felt that my soul was dead the past few days. Facebook clearly figured that out. pic.twitter.com/TjFGZLu2nr \n— Jim Roberts (@nycjim) November 11, 2016 Did we all collectively die today or… pic.twitter.com/GrnKGftNrc \n— Taylor Lorenz (@TaylorLorenz) November 11, 2016 \nIt didn’t take very long for everybody to come back to life, and I do mean everybody. Once the glitch was fixed, even people who were actually dead were no longer marked as such. Eventually that got sorted as well, and now everybody’s Facebook profile accurately reflects their status as it relates to being dead or not dead.",

EST November 11, 2016 Source: Facebook CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST \nChocolate lovers, or anyone with a sweet tooth for that matter, have every right to want to move to Italy right at this moment. \nMcDonald’s in Italy decided to up the ante on its dessert menu by introducing a Nutella burger on the fast-food chain’s Facebook page Thursday. \nThe post has generated over 59,000 likes and 57,000 comments on Facebook. \nThe “burger,\" known as the Sweety Con, appears to feature a sweet bun with a blob of the hazelnut cholocate spread injected inside. The translated Facebook post reads, “A soft sweetness has arrived that you will not be able to resist. Try Sweety with Nutella now: soft bread with a creamy, indulgent center!” \nCopyright 2016 WCNC",

      "title": "As Teens Leave Facebook, Learn All About...",
      "text": "Share By Jennifer Wagner \nYou joined Facebook. Your friends were on it anyway, so you thought you could socialize and keep tabs on your teens at the same time. Who knew that teens would lose interest in Facebook and flock to other social networks like Twitter, Instagram and Tumblr. And now you don't understand how they work or even know what they are. Here are descriptions of each social network and a tutorial on how to use each one. Twitter \nTwitter is a social network where members write messages that are no longer than 140 characters. Other than that, they have very few restrictions. Members do not need to use their real names. If fact, you will see a check mark on celebrities accounts so that you can tell the real celebrity from the many fake accounts. And you can follow and read anybody's tweets without them following you back. All tweets are public, unless a user creates a private account, which few do (because it defeats the reason for Twitter, which is a public forum). \ncontinue reading below our video Overview of Instagram iPhone App \nTo use Twitter, create an account. You will make up a Twitter name, but if you want your friends to find you, also include your real name. Add your picture if you are serious about Twitter or an avatar or leave it blank, if you are only using it to follow your teen. Then, if you want to get something out of Twitter, follow news channels, authors, comedians, or people that tweet things that interest you. I get all my breaking news from Twitter. \nOne of the best ways to enjoy Twitter is during live events. Go on Twitter during The Super Bowl, or a big awards show, or during a contest show like The Voice, and you will see in the trending are on the side a list of hashtags (#). There is bound to be one for events like these. Click it and you will get a stream of tweets only discussing the event you are watching. Feel free to join in. \nIf your teen has not included his real name in his profile, he might be difficult to find on Twitter. If he did include his name, you can find him by clicking Discover, and then \"Who to follow\" and then type in the name at the top of the page where it says \"search using a person's real name\". You can also do this to look for friends on Twitter. \nInstagram \nInstagram has become very popular with teens. Instagram is a photo app in which you take a picture with the app from your smartphone, add some text, and publish on Instagram where anyone can see it on the phone app or Instagram website. You can also have the app send the photo to Facebook Tumblr and Twitter. And since teens love to take selfies, that is a good deal of what they are posting. \nTo create an account on Instagram, download the app on your SmartPhone and register with your email address or Facebook account. Then create a username and password and your are done. All posts are public by default. However, you can make yours private so that only followers can see them, by going into your profile, and turning on \"Posts are Private\". \nYou can use Instagram for both photos and short videos. You can learn more about editing, tagging, photo tips, etc on Instagram's help page . \nTumblr \nTumblr is a blogging platform, where thousands of people publish short blog posts. It is also an RSS feed, because you subscribe to as many of these mini-blogs as you want, and then when you go through your Tumblr dashboard, you will see the posts from those blogs. And, it also has social networking qualities because you can share posts on Facebook or Twitter, reblog, comment or like and post. So, as hard as it is to explain, it really is just a bunch or short blogs connected. \nBecause Tumblr is more than just social networking, you might not be as likely to create an account, unless you enjoy writing or have something to say. Even though writing on Tumblr isn't the same as writing a full blog post on a Wordpress blog, it usually is more than the typical conversation on Facebook. \nIf your teens are using Tumblr, that is probably a good thing. It is a very creative tool and it is a good way to hone their writing skills. If you have been thinking about blogging but weren't sure if you could do it, this would be a great way to try. It is completely free and minimal tech skills are needed.",

In an interview Thursday, Nov. 10, 2016, with \"The Facebook Effect\" author David Kirkpatrick, Zuckerberg said the idea that Facebook influenced the outcome of the U.S. election is a \"crazy idea.\" (AP Photo/Eric Risberg, File) Posted: Friday, November 11, 2016 4:07 pm | Updated: 4:31 pm, Fri Nov 11, 2016. Zuckerberg: 'Crazy' to say Facebook influenced election Associated Press | \nNEW YORK (AP) — Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg says the idea that fake news spread on Facebook influenced the outcome of the U.S. election is \"crazy.\" \nStill, the majority of Americans (six in 10) say they get at least some news from social media , mostly Facebook, according to the Pew Research Center. While a lot of this news comes from established outlets — whether CNN or BuzzFeed News, misinformation spreads on Facebook just as information does, shared by users, recommended by software and amplified by both. \nSources of spurious information has ranged from news articles produced by \"content farms\" for the sole purpose of getting clicks, to \"hyperpartisan\" sites from both sides of the political spectrum, churning out stories that are misleading at best. \nCase in point: \"FBI AGENT SUSPECTED IN HILLARY EMAIL LEAKS FOUND DEAD IN APPARENT MURDER-SUICIDE\" — a fabricated headline from a fake news site called the Denver Guardian, was shared thousands of times in the days leading up to the election. \nIs it possible that voters were swayed for or against a candidate, much like those same people might buy a product after seeing an ad on Facebook? \nZuckerberg says voters deserve more credit. \nDuring an interview Thursday with \"The Facebook Effect\" author David Kirkpatrick, Zuckerberg said idea that people voted the way they did because of bogus information on Facebook shows a \"profound lack of empathy\" for supporters of Donald Trump. \n\"Voters make decisions based on their lived experience,\" he said. \nGiven the acerbic political contest from which the country just emerged, when countless longtime friends, even family, were unfriended, many are left to wonder if there would be an alternative American history being written today if it were not for Facebook, Twitter and the like. \nThis, after all, was the first truly social media election, playing out on Twitter and Facebook as much or more than it did on major networks, in living rooms and around watercoolers. \nBut isn't social media just a reflection of our world as it exists? Has Facebook become an easy scapegoat when the answer is far more complex? \nWhile Pew found that many believe political discussions on social media to be \"uniquely angry and disrespectful,\" a comparable number have the same impression of face-to-face conversations when it comes to Democrats, the GOP, or another party. \nFILTER BUBBLE? \nWhen it comes to Facebook users, Zuckerberg said almost everyone has friends on the \"other side.\" Even if 90 percent of your friends are Democrats, for example, 10 percent will be Republican. Still, that's not a very big number, and the idea of a \"filter bubble\" — that social media allows people to surround themselves only with the people and ideas with whom they agree, has been a hot topic this election cycle. \n\"By far the biggest filter in the system is not that the content isn't there, that you don't have friends who support the other candidate or that are of another religion,\" Zuckerberg said. \"But it's that you just don't click on it. You actually tune it out when you see it. I don't know what to do about that.\" \nA DIFFICULT LINE \nFacebook has long denied that it's a publisher or a media company, or that it acts remotely like either. Its cheery slogan — to make the world more \"open and connected\" — seemingly invites a broad range of viewpoints, diverse, lively discussion and the free flow of information, rather than censorship. \nBut it could also make clamping down on fake news difficult. At a time when everyone seems entitled, not just to their own opinions, but to their own facts, one person's misleading headline might be another person's heartfelt truth. \n\"We take misinformation on Facebook very seriously,\" Adam Mosseri, the executive in charge of Facebook's news feed, said in a statement to the tech blog TechCrunch this week. \"We value authentic communication, and hear consistently from those who use Facebook that they prefer not to see misinformation.\" \nFacebook acknowledges that it has more work to do, and it seems to be putting a lot of faith in the power of data, artificial intelligence and algorithms as the solution. \nOver the summer, Facebook fired the small group of journalists in charge of its \"trending\" items and replaced them with an algorithm. The catalyst appeared to be a report in a tech blog, based on an anonymous source, that the editors routinely suppressed conservative viewpoints. \nSubsequently, fake stories ahead of the election began to trend.",

(Patrick Sullivan/The Times-News via AP) \nATLANTA (AP) — A wannabe weatherman was jailed for arson after admitting he started a wildfire to draw attention to his selfie videos on Facebook, his town's police chief said Friday. Meanwhile, a Georgia sheriff appealed for help identifying the driver of a dark blue SUV last seen where other wildfires began. And in North Carolina, authorities suspect arson in more than 20 wildfires burning in a national forest. \n\"It's really too bad because he's not a bad kid — he's just misguided,\" said James Stephens, the police chief in Jenkins, Kentucky, where Johnny Mullins, 21, was arrested this week on a second-degree arson charge. \n\"He likes to do Facebook videos and have people follow him on his 'weather forecast,' so that's pretty much why he did what he did,\" the chief said. \"He enjoyed the attention he got from the Facebook stuff.\" \n\"He didn't realize how much danger he was putting other people in,\" Stephens added. \nA teenager in Harlan County, Kentucky also was arrested for arson this week, and in Tennessee, authorities said Friday that Andrew Scott Lewis was charged with setting fires and vandalism causing more than $250,000 in damage and threatening homes outside Chattanooga. \nNo arrests were announced in most of the rest of the suspicious fires, which have been torching forests in and around the southern Appalachian mountains. The relentless drought across much of the South has removed the usual humidity and sucked wells and streams dry, making the woods ripe for fire. \nTens of thousands of acres have burned, about a dozen of the largest fires remain uncontained and many people to evacuate their homes ahead of fast-moving flames. \nLaw officers in Georgia's Rabun County suspect that someone started a series of small roadside fires Wednesday that eventually merged into the much larger blazes firefighters were working to contain on Friday, said Justin Upchurch, the county's assistant fire chief. \nThe Rabun County sheriff's office urged people to be on the look-out, saying the SUV was last seen in the area of the fires. The office was more emphatic in a separate Facebook post, asking residents to spread the word \"and help us lock this criminal up!!!\" \nThe area is less than 50 miles from North Carolina's Nantahala National Forest, where more than 20 wildfires that have burned more than 17,000 acres are all \"being investigated for suspected arson,\" forestry officials announced in a status update. \nThere were 14 other wildfires burning on Cherokee Nation land in North Carolina, all under investigation by local law enforcement. A fire managers' update noted that the U.S. Bureau of Indian Affairs is seeking information about fires on Indian lands through an arson hotline. \nStates of emergency were declared in some of the affected areas to facilitate state and federal spending on the response. \nMore than 5,000 firefighters and support staff from around the nation have joined the effort, said Shardul Raval, director of fire and aviation management for the southern region of the U.S. Forest Service. \nSmoke from the fires has made North Carolina's largest city a Code Orange zone for air quality, meaning anyone with breathing problems could suffer. The Charlotte Observer reports that the heavy haze and smoky conditions should make people limit outdoor activities. \nThat apparently isn't stopping organizers of this weekend's Charlotte Marathon. They said Friday that they do not expect the wildfire smoke to impact Saturday's races, which include a marathon, half-marathon, 5K run/walk, marathon relay and a kids 1-mile fun run. \n___ \nReynolds Yonker reported from Louisville, Kentucky.

According to Facebook's help center , Facebook needs to be notified in order for an account to be memorialized. \nThousands of people took to social media to notify friends and family of their own passing on Friday afternoon. \nFacebook is telling all my friends we're dead, which is appropriate because I had a feeling we were all in hell anyway. pic.twitter.com/0WPGi95omv — Chris Person (@Papapishu) November 11, 2016",

(Patrick Sullivan/The Times-News via AP) \nATLANTA (AP) — A wannabe weatherman was jailed for arson after admitting he started a wildfire to draw attention to his selfie videos on Facebook, his town's police chief said Friday. Meanwhile, a Georgia sheriff appealed for help identifying the driver of a dark blue SUV last seen where other wildfires began. And in North Carolina, authorities suspect arson in more than 20 wildfires burning in a national forest. \n\"It's really too bad because he's not a bad kid — he's just misguided,\" said James Stephens, the police chief in Jenkins, Kentucky, where Johnny Mullins, 21, was arrested this week on a second-degree arson charge. \n\"He likes to do Facebook videos and have people follow him on his 'weather forecast,' so that's pretty much why he did what he did,\" the chief said. \"He enjoyed the attention he got from the Facebook stuff.\" \n\"He didn't realize how much danger he was putting other people in,\" Stephens added. \nA teenager in Harlan County, Kentucky also was arrested for arson this week, and in Tennessee, authorities said Friday that Andrew Scott Lewis was charged with setting fires and vandalism causing more than $250,000 in damage and threatening homes outside Chattanooga. \nNo arrests were announced in most of the rest of the suspicious fires, which have been torching forests in and around the southern Appalachian mountains. The relentless drought across much of the South has removed the usual humidity and sucked wells and streams dry, making the woods ripe for fire. \nTens of thousands of acres have burned, about a dozen of the largest fires remain uncontained and many people to evacuate their homes ahead of fast-moving flames. \nLaw officers in Georgia's Rabun County suspect that someone started a series of small roadside fires Wednesday that eventually merged into the much larger blazes firefighters were working to contain on Friday, said Justin Upchurch, the county's assistant fire chief. \nThe Rabun County sheriff's office urged people to be on the look-out, saying the SUV was last seen in the area of the fires. The office was more emphatic in a separate Facebook post, asking residents to spread the word \"and help us lock this criminal up!!!\" \nThe area is less than 50 miles from North Carolina's Nantahala National Forest, where more than 20 wildfires that have burned more than 17,000 acres are all \"being investigated for suspected arson,\" forestry officials announced in a status update. \nThere were 14 other wildfires burning on Cherokee Nation land in North Carolina, all under investigation by local law enforcement. A fire managers' update noted that the U.S. Bureau of Indian Affairs is seeking information about fires on Indian lands through an arson hotline. \nThe U.S. Forest Service announced Friday that the entire Cohutta Wilderness, which stretches across the Chattahoochee National Forest in Georgia and the Cherokee National Forest in Tennessee, has been closed to the public due to multiple fires there. \nStates of emergency were declared in some of the affected areas to facilitate state and federal spending on the response. \nMore than 5,000 firefighters and support staff from around the nation have joined the effort, said Shardul Raval, director of fire and aviation management for the southern region of the U.S. Forest Service. \nSmoke from the fires has made North Carolina's largest city a Code Orange zone for air quality, meaning anyone with breathing problems could suffer. The Charlotte Observer reports that the heavy haze and smoky conditions should make people limit outdoor activities. \nThat apparently isn't stopping organizers of this weekend's Charlotte Marathon. They said Friday that they do not expect the wildfire smoke to impact Saturday's races, which include a marathon, half-marathon, 5K run/walk, marathon relay and a kids 1-mile fun run. \n___ \nReynolds Yonker reported from Louisville, Kentucky.

      "text": "Zuckerberg: 'Crazy' to say Facebook influenced election - Tri-State News, Weather & Sports Member Center: Zuckerberg: 'Crazy' to say Facebook influenced election By BARBARA ORTUTAYAP Technology Writer \nNEW YORK (AP) - Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg says the idea that fake news spread on Facebook influenced the outcome of the U.S. election is \"crazy.\" \nStill, the majority of Americans (six in 10) say they get at least some news from social media , mostly Facebook, according to the Pew Research Center.

But Facebook might think you are. Related Content This NASA astronaut voted from space \nFacebook notified some users on Friday that they are deceased, according to widespread reports across social media. \nMany people are seeing a banner on certain profiles that reads: \"We hope people who love [Mark] will find comfort in the things others share to remember and celebrate his life.\" \nNot all profiles were affected -- I'm still alive according to my pulse and Facebook. But at one point, even Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg was declared dead by his own social network. \nIt's unclear what's causing the mass obituaries, but it's likely a bug in Facebook's system. \nThe company did not return a request for comment by press time. \nCopyright 2016 by CNN NewSource .

      "text": "Eric Risberg Zuckerberg: 'Crazy' to say Facebook influenced election \nFILE - In this Tuesday, April 12, 2016, file photo, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg delivers the keynote address at the F8 Facebook Developer Conference, in San Francisco. In an interview Thursday, Nov. 10, 2016, with \"The Facebook Effect\" author David Kirkpatrick, Zuckerberg said the idea that Facebook influenced the outcome of the U.S. election is a \"crazy idea.\" (AP Photo/Eric Risberg, File) ADVERTISEMENT Zuckerberg: 'Crazy' to say Facebook influenced election Associated Press | \nNEW YORK (AP) — Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg says the idea that fake news spread on Facebook influenced the outcome of the U.S. election is \"crazy.\" \nStill, the majority of Americans (six in 10) say they get at least some news from social media , mostly Facebook, according to the Pew Research Center. While a lot of this news comes from established outlets — whether CNN or BuzzFeed News, misinformation spreads on Facebook just as information does, shared by users, recommended by software and amplified by both. \nSources of spurious information has ranged from news articles produced by \"content farms\" for the sole purpose of getting clicks, to \"hyperpartisan\" sites from both sides of the political spectrum, churning out stories that are misleading at best. \nCase in point: \"FBI AGENT SUSPECTED IN HILLARY EMAIL LEAKS FOUND DEAD IN APPARENT MURDER-SUICIDE\" — a fabricated headline from a fake news site called the Denver Guardian, was shared thousands of times in the days leading up to the election. \nIs it possible that voters were swayed for or against a candidate, much like those same people might buy a product after seeing an ad on Facebook? \nZuckerberg says voters deserve more credit. \nDuring an interview Thursday with \"The Facebook Effect\" author David Kirkpatrick, Zuckerberg said idea that people voted the way they did because of bogus information on Facebook shows a \"profound lack of empathy\" for supporters of Donald Trump. \n\"Voters make decisions based on their lived experience,\" he said. \nGiven the acerbic political contest from which the country just emerged, when countless longtime friends, even family, were unfriended, many are left to wonder if there would be an alternative American history being written today if it were not for Facebook, Twitter and the like. \nThis, after all, was the first truly social media election, playing out on Twitter and Facebook as much or more than it did on major networks, in living rooms and around watercoolers. \nBut isn't social media just a reflection of our world as it exists? Has Facebook become an easy scapegoat when the answer is far more complex? \nWhile Pew found that many believe political discussions on social media to be \"uniquely angry and disrespectful,\" a comparable number have the same impression of face-to-face conversations when it comes to Democrats, the GOP, or another party. \nFILTER BUBBLE? \nWhen it comes to Facebook users, Zuckerberg said almost everyone has friends on the \"other side.\" Even if 90 percent of your friends are Democrats, for example, 10 percent will be Republican. Still, that's not a very big number, and the idea of a \"filter bubble\" — that social media allows people to surround themselves only with the people and ideas with whom they agree, has been a hot topic this election cycle. \n\"By far the biggest filter in the system is not that the content isn't there, that you don't have friends who support the other candidate or that are of another religion,\" Zuckerberg said. \"But it's that you just don't click on it. You actually tune it out when you see it. I don't know what to do about that.\" \nA DIFFICULT LINE \nFacebook has long denied that it's a publisher or a media company, or that it acts remotely like either. Its cheery slogan — to make the world more \"open and connected\" — seemingly invites a broad range of viewpoints, diverse, lively discussion and the free flow of information, rather than censorship. \nBut it could also make clamping down on fake news difficult. At a time when everyone seems entitled, not just to their own opinions, but to their own facts, one person's misleading headline might be another person's heartfelt truth. \n\"We take misinformation on Facebook very seriously,\" Adam Mosseri, the executive in charge of Facebook's news feed, said in a statement to the tech blog TechCrunch this week. \"We value authentic communication, and hear consistently from those who use Facebook that they prefer not to see misinformation.\" \nFacebook acknowledges that it has more work to do, and it seems to be putting a lot of faith in the power of data, artificial intelligence and algorithms as the solution. \nOver the summer, Facebook fired the small group of journalists in charge of its \"trending\" items and replaced them with an algorithm. The catalyst appeared to be a report in a tech blog, based on an anonymous source, that the editors routinely suppressed conservative viewpoints. \nSubsequently, fake stories ahead of the election began to trend.",

      "text": "ATLANTA — A wannabe weatherman was jailed for arson after admitting he started a wildfire to draw attention to his selfie videos on Facebook, his town's police chief said Friday. Meanwhile, a Georgia sheriff appealed for help identifying the driver of a dark blue SUV last seen where other wildfires began. And in North Carolina, authorities suspect arson in more than 20 wildfires burning in a national forest.\n\"It's really too bad because he's not a bad kid — he's just misguided,\" said James Stephens, the police chief in Jenkins, Kentucky, where Johnny Mullins, 21, was arrested this week on a second-degree arson charge.\n\"He likes to do Facebook videos and have people follow him on his 'weather forecast,' so that's pretty much why he did what he did,\" the chief said. \"He enjoyed the attention he got from the Facebook stuff.\"\n\"He didn't realize how much danger he was putting other people in,\" Stephens added.\nA teenager in Harlan County, Kentucky also was arrested for arson this week, and in Tennessee, authorities said Friday that Andrew Scott Lewis was charged with setting fires and vandalism causing more than $250,000 in damage and threatening homes outside Chattanooga.\nNo arrests were announced in most of the rest of the suspicious fires, which have been torching forests in and around the southern Appalachian mountains. The relentless drought across much of the South has removed the usual humidity and sucked wells and streams dry, making the woods ripe for fire. In this Wednesday, Nov. 9, 2016 photo, firefighters work at a wildfire burning near Lake Lure, N.C. A state of emergency is in effect for 25 western North Carolina counties where active wildfires are burning, caused by the drought that began last spring. Gov. Pat McCrory said in a news release Thursday that he was declaring the state of emergency for one-quarter of North Carolina's 100 counties. (Patrick Sullivan/The Times-News via AP) \nTens of thousands of acres have burned, about a dozen of the largest fires remain uncontained and many people to evacuate their homes ahead of fast-moving flames.\nLaw officers in Georgia's Rabun County suspect that someone started a series of small roadside fires Wednesday that eventually merged into the much larger blazes firefighters were working to contain on Friday, said Justin Upchurch, the county's assistant fire chief.\nThe Rabun County sheriff's office urged people to be on the look-out, saying the SUV was last seen in the area of the fires. The office was more emphatic in a separate Facebook post, asking residents to spread the word \"and help us lock this criminal up!!!\"\nThe area is less than 50 miles from North Carolina's Nantahala National Forest, where more than 20 wildfires that have burned more than 17,000 acres are all \"being investigated for suspected arson,\" forestry officials announced in a status update.\nThere were 14 other wildfires burning on Cherokee Nation land in North Carolina, all under investigation by local law enforcement. A fire managers' update noted that the U.S. Bureau of Indian Affairs is seeking information about fires on Indian lands through an arson hotline.\nThe U.S. Forest Service announced Friday that the entire Cohutta Wilderness, which stretches across the Chattahoochee National Forest in Georgia and the Cherokee National Forest in Tennessee, has been closed to the public due to multiple fires there.\nStates of emergency were declared in some of the affected areas to facilitate state and federal spending on the response.\nMore than 5,000 firefighters and support staff from around the nation have joined the effort, said Shardul Raval, director of fire and aviation management for the southern region of the U.S. Forest Service.\nSmoke from the fires has made North Carolina's largest city a Code Orange zone for air quality, meaning anyone with breathing problems could suffer. The Charlotte Observer reports that the heavy haze and smoky conditions should make people limit outdoor activities.\nThat apparently isn't stopping organizers of this weekend's Charlotte Marathon. They said Friday that they do not expect the wildfire smoke to impact Saturday's races, which include a marathon, half-marathon, 5K run/walk, marathon relay and a kids 1-mile fun run.",

      "text": "Zuckerberg: 'Crazy' to say Facebook influenced election - Live5News.com | Charleston, SC | News, Weather, Sports Member Center: Zuckerberg: 'Crazy' to say Facebook influenced election By BARBARA ORTUTAYAP Technology Writer \nNEW YORK (AP) - Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg says the idea that fake news spread on Facebook influenced the outcome of the U.S. election is \"crazy.\" \nStill, the majority of Americans (six in 10) say they get at least some news from social media , mostly Facebook, according to the Pew Research Center. While a lot of this news comes from established outlets - whether CNN or BuzzFeed News, misinformation spreads on Facebook just as information does, shared by users, recommended by software and amplified by both. \nSources of spurious information have ranged from news articles produced by \"content farms\" for the sole purpose of getting clicks, to \"hyperpartisan\" sites from both sides of the political spectrum, churning out stories that are misleading at best. \nCase in point: \"FBI AGENT SUSPECTED IN HILLARY EMAIL LEAKS FOUND DEAD IN APPARENT MURDER-SUICIDE\" - a fabricated headline from a fake news site called the Denver Guardian, was shared thousands of times in the days leading up to the election. \nIs it possible that voters were swayed for or against a candidate, much like those same people might buy a product after seeing an ad on Facebook? \nZuckerberg says voters deserve more credit. \nDuring an interview Thursday with \"The Facebook Effect\" author David Kirkpatrick, Zuckerberg said idea that people voted the way they did because of bogus information on Facebook shows a \"profound lack of empathy\" for supporters of Donald Trump. \n\"Voters make decisions based on their lived experience,\" he said. \nGiven the acerbic political contest from which the country just emerged, when countless longtime friends, even family, were unfriended, many are left to wonder if there would be an alternative American history being written today if it were not for Facebook, Twitter and the like. \nThis, after all, was the first truly social media election, playing out on Twitter and Facebook as much or more than it did on major networks, in living rooms and around watercoolers. \nBut isn't social media just a reflection of our world as it exists? Has Facebook become an easy scapegoat when the answer is far more complex? \nWhile Pew found that many believe political discussions on social media to be \"uniquely angry and disrespectful,\" a comparable number have the same impression of face-to-face conversations when it comes to Democrats, the GOP, or another party. \nFILTER BUBBLE? \nWhen it comes to Facebook users, Zuckerberg said almost everyone has friends on the \"other side.\" Even if 90 percent of your friends are Democrats, for example, 10 percent will be Republican. Still, that's not a very big number, and the idea of a \"filter bubble\" - that social media allows people to surround themselves only with the people and ideas with whom they agree, has been a hot topic this election cycle. \n\"By far the biggest filter in the system is not that the content isn't there, that you don't have friends who support the other candidate or that are of another religion,\" Zuckerberg said. \"But it's that you just don't click on it. You actually tune it out when you see it. I don't know what to do about that.\" \nA DIFFICULT LINE \nFacebook has long denied that it's a publisher or a media company, or that it acts remotely like either. Its cheery slogan - to make the world more \"open and connected\" - seemingly invites a broad range of viewpoints, diverse, lively discussion and the free flow of information, rather than censorship. \nBut it could also make clamping down on fake news difficult. At a time when everyone seems entitled, not just to their own opinions, but to their own facts, one person's misleading headline might be another person's heartfelt truth. \n\"We take misinformation on Facebook very seriously,\" Adam Mosseri, the executive in charge of Facebook's news feed, said in a statement to the tech blog TechCrunch this week. \"We value authentic communication, and hear consistently from those who use Facebook that they prefer not to see misinformation.\" \nFacebook acknowledges that it has more work to do, and it seems to be putting a lot of faith in the power of data, artificial intelligence and algorithms as the solution. \nOver the summer, Facebook fired the small group of journalists in charge of its \"trending\" items and replaced them with an algorithm. The catalyst appeared to be a report in a tech blog, based on an anonymous source, that the editors routinely suppressed conservative viewpoints. \nSubsequently, fake stories ahead of the election began to trend.

      "text": "Zuckerberg: 'Crazy' to say Facebook influenced election Barbara Ortutay, AP Technology Writer Share View photos \nFILE - In this Tuesday, April 12, 2016, file photo, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg delivers the keynote address at the F8 Facebook Developer Conference, in San Francisco. In an interview Thursday, Nov. 10, 2016, with \"The Facebook Effect\" author David Kirkpatrick, Zuckerberg said the idea that Facebook influenced the outcome of the U.S. election is a \"crazy idea.\" (AP Photo/Eric Risberg, File) More NEW YORK (AP) -- Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg says the idea that fake news spread on Facebook influenced the outcome of the U.S. election is \"crazy.\" Still, the majority of Americans (six in 10) say they get at least some news from social media , mostly Facebook, according to the Pew Research Center. While a lot of this news comes from established outlets — whether CNN or BuzzFeed News, misinformation spreads on Facebook just as information does, shared by users, recommended by software and amplified by both. Sources of spurious information have ranged from news articles produced by \"content farms\" for the sole purpose of getting clicks, to \"hyperpartisan\" sites from both sides of the political spectrum, churning out stories that are misleading at best. Case in point: \"FBI AGENT SUSPECTED IN HILLARY EMAIL LEAKS FOUND DEAD IN APPARENT MURDER-SUICIDE\" — a fabricated headline from a fake news site called the Denver Guardian, was shared thousands of times in the days leading up to the election. Is it possible that voters were swayed for or against a candidate, much like those same people might buy a product after seeing an ad on Facebook? Zuckerberg says voters deserve more credit. During an interview Thursday with \"The Facebook Effect\" author David Kirkpatrick, Zuckerberg said idea that people voted the way they did because of bogus information on Facebook shows a \"profound lack of empathy\" for supporters of Donald Trump. \"Voters make decisions based on their lived experience,\" he said. Given the acerbic political contest from which the country just emerged, when countless longtime friends, even family, were unfriended, many are left to wonder if there would be an alternative American history being written today if it were not for Facebook, Twitter and the like. This, after all, was the first truly social media election, playing out on Twitter and Facebook as much or more than it did on major networks, in living rooms and around watercoolers. But isn't social media just a reflection of our world as it exists? Has Facebook become an easy scapegoat when the answer is far more complex? While Pew found that many believe political discussions on social media to be \"uniquely angry and disrespectful,\" a comparable number have the same impression of face-to-face conversations when it comes to Democrats, the GOP, or another party. FILTER BUBBLE? When it comes to Facebook users, Zuckerberg said almost everyone has friends on the \"other side.\" Even if 90 percent of your friends are Democrats, for example, 10 percent will be Republican. Still, that's not a very big number, and the idea of a \"filter bubble\" — that social media allows people to surround themselves only with the people and ideas with whom they agree, has been a hot topic this election cycle. \"By far the biggest filter in the system is not that the content isn't there, that you don't have friends who support the other candidate or that are of another religion,\" Zuckerberg said. \"But it's that you just don't click on it. You actually tune it out when you see it. I don't know what to do about that.\" A DIFFICULT LINE Facebook has long denied that it's a publisher or a media company, or that it acts remotely like either. Its cheery slogan — to make the world more \"open and connected\" — seemingly invites a broad range of viewpoints, diverse, lively discussion and the free flow of information, rather than censorship. But it could also make clamping down on fake news difficult. At a time when everyone seems entitled, not just to their own opinions, but to their own facts, one person's misleading headline might be another person's heartfelt truth. \"We take misinformation on Facebook very seriously,\" Adam Mosseri, the executive in charge of Facebook's news feed, said in a statement to the tech blog TechCrunch this week. \"We value authentic communication, and hear consistently from those who use Facebook that they prefer not to see misinformation.\" Facebook acknowledges that it has more work to do, and it seems to be putting a lot of faith in the power of data, artificial intelligence and algorithms as the solution. Over the summer, Facebook fired the small group of journalists in charge of its \"trending\" items and replaced them with an algorithm. The catalyst appeared to be a report in a tech blog, based on an anonymous source, that the editors routinely suppressed conservative viewpoints. Subsequently, fake stories ahead of the election began to trend. Reblog",

      "text": "TOP Two Babson College students driving around to celebrate Donald Trump's election win. [Facebook video screengrab/https://www.facebook.com/sydney.robertson.50/posts/10210780785293367?pnref=story] 5324004 \nStudents at Babson College in Wellesley, Mass. are demanding the expulsion of two students because they drove around town celebrating Donald Trump’s presidential victory Tuesday night. \nLike many Trump supporters, Edward Tomasso and Parker Rander-Ricciardi were enthusiastic over the billionaire’s upset win against former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. So they drove around Wednesday in a pick-up truck waving a Donald Trump flag, whooping and hollering. \nThey ended up passing through the campus of nearby all-female Wellesley College, where they deeply upset the local student population. \nSydney Robertson, a Wellesley student, made a Facebook post the following day denouncing Tomasso and Rander-Ricciardi, sharing two very brief videos of their antics. Robertson claimed the men had spit on a passerby, although neither video shows such behavior. Other social media posts claimed the men had shouted racial slurs, a claim Tomasso vehemently denied in a Facebook apology. (RELATED: Student Admits She Fabricated Attack By Trump Supporters) \nNow, Tomasso and Rander-Ricciardi are facing disciplinary action, with a Babson official suggesting their celebration was racist because they happened to celebrate near the Harambee House, an affinity house for black Wellesley students. \n“It is important to understand that our students’ behavior was experienced by many students of color and perceived by many others . . . as racially offensive and gender demeaning,” Student Affairs Vice President Lawrence Ward said in a statement. \nThe students have already been expelled from their fraternity, Sigma Alpha Epsilon, and are under investigation by the school as well. \nA flier has even appeared on Babson’s campus, featuring photographs and the names of the two students, labeling them as “RACISTS” and telling passersby to demand their expulsion. Flier denouncing Babson College students [Anonymous] “Protest and petition Babson president Kerry Healey to act and expel these bigots from our campus and tell America and the world that Babson’s name will never stand for bigotry and racism.”\nTo help students out, the flier includes Healey’s email and phone number. \nBabson is a private school, so it could potentially expel Tomasso and Rander-Ricciardi without running afoul of the First Amendment. The school’s code of conduct, though, explicitly guarantees the equivalent of First Amendment rights to students at the school. \nSend tips to [email protected] .

One theory, put forth in a report from Motherboard , is that the flood of condolences going to Clinton supporters tricked the site into thinking they'd passed. \nFacebook fixed the problem after a few hours. It's poor timing for the company, which is defending itself against allegations that hoax news stories spread on the site influenced the election.

(Patrick Sullivan/The Times-News via AP) \nATLANTA (AP) — The search is on for a man in a dark blue SUV last seen where a handful of fires began in Georgia. Authorities in North Carolina suspect arson in more than 20 wildfires burning in a national forest. And in Kentucky, a wannabe weatherman faces an arson charge after police said he admitted starting a fire to draw attention to his Facebook selfie videos. \n\"It's really too bad because he's not a bad kid — he's just misguided,\" Jenkins Police Chief James Stephens said Friday after Johnny Mullins, 21, was jailed this week on a second-degree arson charge. \n\"He likes to do Facebook videos and have people follow him on his 'weather forecast,' so that's pretty much why he did what he did,\" the chief said. \"He enjoyed the attention he got from the Facebook stuff.\" \n\"He didn't realize how much danger he was putting other people in,\" Stephens added. \nNo arrests were announced in most of the rest of the suspicious fires, which have been torching forests in and around the southern Appalachian mountains. The relentless drought across much of the South has removed the usual humidity and sucked wells and streams dry, making the woods ripe for fire. \nTens of thousands of acres have burned, about a dozen of the largest fires remain uncontained and many people to evacuate their homes ahead of fast-moving flames. \nLaw officers in Georgia's Rabun County suspect that someone started a series of small roadside fires Wednesday that eventually merged into the much larger blazes firefighters were working to contain on Friday, said Justin Upchurch, the county's assistant fire chief. \nThe Rabun County sheriff's office urged people to be on the look-out, saying the SUV was last seen in the area of the fires. The office was more emphatic in a separate Facebook post, asking residents to spread the word \"and help us lock this criminal up!!!\" \nThe area is less than 50 miles from North Carolina's Nantahala National Forest, where more than 20 wildfires that have burned more than 17,000 acres are all \"being investigated for suspected arson,\" forestry officials announced in a status update. \nThere were 14 other wildfires burning on Cherokee Nation land in North Carolina, all under investigation by local law enforcement. A fire managers' update noted that the U.S. Bureau of Indian Affairs is seeking information about fires on Indian lands through an arson hotline. \nStates of emergency were declared in some of the affected areas to facilitate state and federal spending on the response. \nMore than 5,000 firefighters and support staff from around the nation have joined the effort, said Shardul Raval, director of fire and aviation management for the southern region of the U.S. Forest Service. About 40 aircraft are involved, including three large air tankers flying out of Chattanooga, Tennessee. \nThe national drought report shows 41.6 million people in parts of 15 Southern states living in drought conditions. The worst is in Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi and Tennessee, but extreme drought also is spreading into the western Carolinas. Kentucky, Tennessee and North Carolina all have fierce fires. \nOne of the largest blazes was spreading rapidly in the Cohutta Wilderness area just south of the Georgia-Tennessee line. Nearly 300 people are battling that fire, which already consumed about 15 square miles, the Forest Service said. \nSmoke from the fires has made North Carolina's largest city a Code Orange zone for air quality, meaning anyone with breathing problems could suffer. The Charlotte Observer reports that the heavy haze and smoky conditions should make people limit outdoor activities. \nThat apparently isn't stopping organizers of this weekend's Charlotte Marathon. They said Friday that they do not expect the wildfire smoke to impact Saturday's races, which include a marathon, half-marathon, 5K run/walk, marathon relay and a kids 1-mile fun run. \n___ \nReynolds Yonker reported from Louisville, Kentucky.

      "text": "pjsells Getty File Photo (Getty/pjsells) \nAfter every supermoon, Twitter and Facebook are flooded with fuzzy photos of white glowing orbs kind of floating in a black sea of night. \nBut there are ways to take a good photo of the moon, even with a smartphone. \nMonday’s supermoon will be the closest in its orbit to Earth since 1948. It becomes full Monday morning. \nA super moon rises over the Boynton Beach Inlet in Boynton Beach, Florida on September 8, 2014. (Allen Eyestone / The Palm Beach Post) \n“Don’t make the mistake of photographing the moon by itself, with no reference to anything,” Bill Ingalls, a senior photographer for NASA, told National Geographic . “Instead, think of how to make the image creative — that means tying it into some land-based object. It can be a local landmark or anything to give your photo a sense of place.” \nThe moon begins to set behind the First Baptist Church during a lunar eclipse, October 8, 2014, in West Palm Beach. (Greg Lovett / The Palm Beach Post) \nHere are a few tips from Palm Beach Post photographer Lannis Waters that were first gathered by Palm Beach Post staff writer Staci Sturrock during supermoon events in 2014. Start early. If you’re using a smartphone, try to capture the moon when it’s still near Earth’s horizon, and find something to frame it with in the foreground (trees, buildings, people). “That will help with your exposure because there should still be some light in the sky, and add interest,” Waters says. Go long. Using a DSLR? “Obviously, shoot with as long a lens as possible,” Waters says. “A tripod will help, and is necessary if you’re using a very long lens. Ditto for a cable release or self-timer to avoid adding any vibrations when you fire a frame.” Look for foreground interest. You can’t go wrong composing your photo with either the Lake Worth or Juno Beach pier in the foreground. “Around here, it’s hard to find a place where you can get far enough back to make a skyline work, but there are places where you could get the moon rising through a stand of trees or over buildings, but you need to search for those in advance,” Waters says. (Jupiter Lighthouse, we’re looking at you.) Tap into an app. Waters likes the SkyView app, “which gives you an Augmented Reality view of the sky, and lets you type in the time and date you want so you can see where the moon will be at that time.” Make manual adjustments. Forgo your camera’s automatic settings and use the back of your camera to judge your exposure. “Otherwise the dark sky can make your shot overexposed,” Waters says. “And since the moon is reflecting daylight, the exposure is near what it would be for a sunlit scene in the daytime, so you don’t need a high ISO.” \n\n(Greg Lovett / The Palm Beach Post) \n",

Join the Conversation Share Our reporters give their predictions for the Packers showdown with the Titans on Sunday. Green Bay Packers' Aaron Rodgers leves the field following the Green Bay Packers 31-26 loss to the Indianapolis Colts on Sunday, November 6, 2016, at Lambeau Field in Green Bay, Wis. (Photo: Wm. Glasheen/USA TODAY NETWORK-Wis) \nGREEN BAY - Three sets of doors and one long hallway separated two players at the forefront of the Green Bay Packers, and early last Sunday evening, their reactions to a disparaging loss landed on opposite ends of the emotional spectrum. \nInside the media auditorium, where Aaron Rodgers stood behind a lectern to address reporters, the quarterback’s tone matched the composure associated with his position. At times he tinged with frustration and gentle dismay — the Packers had just lost to the Indianapolis Colts, an inferior opponent — but not once did Rodgers flash a temper. \nThe mood in the locker room was different. As players dressed, their stunned silence proved an adequate postmortem to a game the Packers never should have lost, a game that deadened their record to 4-4 at the midway point of the season. Only Mike Daniels broke the mold; his profanity-ridden tirade echoed from the showers to reporters’ ears. \n“I didn’t think you guys heard me,” Daniels said the next day. “Some things in the locker room ought to stay amongst us as peers, but it got out.” \nAt their very core, post-game antics are wrought with futility: You can kick and scream to your heart’s delight, but the result of the game won’t change. What the Packers could have used was a shot in the arm. They needed an injection of life on the sideline, where quarterback and coach said the typical “juice” was lacking. \nWhen it comes to this year’s Packers, the presence of such a player is open to interpretation. The most obvious candidate, Rodgers, told reporters he is not a “rah-rah” type of guy. Daniels is the most vocal of the bunch, but a number of teammates brushed aside his outburst as white noise during interviews with the Journal Sentinel throughout the week. \n“A-Rod is not a vocal guy,” outside linebacker Jayrone Elliott said, “so we don’t really look for him to be vocal. He leads by example. (Julius Peppers) Pep does the same thing. Clay (Matthews) does the same thing. So we don’t really have many vocal leaders besides like Mike Daniels, Josh Sitton when he was here, T.J. Lang.” \nAs their season teeters, an important question is raise: Who can galvanize the Packers? \nOr, more importantly: What happens if nobody can? \n**** \nThe Packers held their first padded practice on July 28, six weeks before the season opener in Jacksonville, and the coaching staff wasted little time before setting up the one-on-one pass-rush drill, a highly competitive event. \nDaniels stepped in for his first rep against backup lineman Don Barclay, whose reserved personality comes to life between the white lines. Within seconds, the play devolved into a shoving match-turned-skirmish. \nLater in camp, Daniels dressed down rookie nose tackle Kenny Clark, a first-round pick who probably hadn’t been harangued like that in several years. Daniels, who signed a four-year, $42 million contract extension last December and is considered among the best players in the league at his position, has the chops — and the stones — to pull something like that off. \n“He plays his (expletive) off,” safety Ha Ha Clinton-Dix said. \nBut that doesn’t mean his style plays to the entire locker room. The shower-screaming incident was quintessential Daniels: He was enraged by the team’s unsightly loss and unleashed a verbal blast. It just so happened reporters heard more of it than the players. \n“I was talking to some of the guys just about some things,” Daniels said the day after the game. “You know, nobody’s happy right now. Nobody.” \nWhile teammates praise Daniels for his passion and determination, many inside the locker room tune out his antics or purposely ignore them. He carries himself like a vocal leader, but the message doesn’t resonate with everybody. \n“For me, after a loss, yelling is not going to do anything at that point, you know what I mean?” said one player. “That’s not the right time to do it. Of course everybody is pissed off that we just lost. If somebody is going to yell, it needs to be the coach. The coach needs to yell. Mike Daniels is going to do what he wants, though. It used to bother me but now I just close my ears to it.” \nThis week, a number of players rejected yelling as a method of inspiration. Some spoke about Daniels specifically, others spoke more generally about vocal leaders who choose to scream. \nThe Journal Sentinel interviewed nine players of various positions, ages and statuses within the team. Of those nine, seven said barking at them is ineffective. \n“You don’t really need that,” safety Morgan Burnett said, when asked about whether ranting and raving did anything for him. “These are grown men with families. Man, there’s a respect level. You can get your point across without having to get in a guy’s face. You can get your point across many different ways.” \nSaid Clinton-Dix: “A lot of people in here have kids and families, so you’re not just going to yell at nobody. You’ve got to kind of take a different approach with that. I think that’s the biggest thing from being in college to being in the league. \nSaid Elliott: “That’s Mike every day of his life. That’s Mike. That’s how you reach some people, that’s not how you reach some people. … I don’t really buy into that. Me and Mike are kind of on the same page: I look up to him. He’s the leader so I follow him. But as far as yelling, I don’t get involved in all that.” \nSaid one player: \"He's going to do it whether you want him to or not. That's just the way he is.\" \nTwo of the players suggested that Daniels’ talent gives him a longer leash when it comes to confronting teammates. One player said he believed the shower incident was done primarily for attention. \nCould Daniels have gotten away with the outburst as a lesser player? \n“Hell no,” one player said. “There’s no way. There’s no way he could. There’s no way. He’s just a different character, man. He’s just different. One thing he does is he goes out there and plays his ass off, so you can’t really say nothing to him about that. (The yelling) is just something you’ve got to deal with. You don’t have to listen to it. He’s going to say what he wants to say though.” \nCenter Corey Linsley and one defensive player view the yelling in a different light. Linsley, who is now the starter, said Daniels is staying within the confines of his personality. He is a rah-rah guy by nature, so the outbursts don’t feel out of context. \n“We kind of need that,” said the defensive player. “He’s the only person that’s really giving us that. I’ll take the good with the bad when he does that.” \nAdded kicker Mason Crosby: “He’s one of the few that will definitely get in someone’s face and get loud.” \n**** \nA year ago, frustration boiled over for the Packers in the fourth quarter against the Carolina Panthers. The trigger was a touchdown from quarterback Cam Newton to rookie receiver Devin Funchess, an error charged to the secondary. \nDuring the ensuing break, television cameras filmed a heated argument between Peppers and Clinton-Dix along the sideline. The two players came together, screamed at one another and were ultimately separated by defensive linemen Mike Pennel and B.J. Raji, who removed Clinton-Dix with a two-handed shove. \nTempers flared in reaction to a comment Peppers made about pass coverage, according to a source who witnessed the incident. The secondary was frustrated after giving up a score, and Clinton-Dix took exception. He fired back about the lack of pass rush. (The Packers did not register a sack of Newton.) \nPeppers and Clinton-Dix continued jawing at each other and finally agreed to worry about their respective responsibilities. \n“They kind of barked back and forth or whatever, but they had an understanding, they agreed to something,” the source said. “Ha Ha and Peppers agreed on something. Then B.J., all he saw was Ha Ha addressing a veteran player. He didn’t know exactly what was going on. That’s all it was. It was just two players that wanted to win going at it. Sometimes you need that in the locker room.” \nThe incident earned Clinton-Dix more respect in the eyes of his peers, according to the source, and this was due in part to its origin. \nWhere Daniels ranted in the aftermath of a loss, the quarrel with Peppers and Clinton-Dix occurred organically during the course of a game. Multiple players said conflicts are often helpful as long as the confrontations aren’t forced. \n“Things like that, those types of leaders you need,” the source said, “someone that is not afraid to say something when it needs to be said. … You don’t want to get into a competition with somebody and then they see you’re not doing anything to hold up or you’re doing nothing but barking. People get tired of hearing that, man.” \n**** \nOn their two most recent Super Bowl-winning teams, the Packers were stocked with veteran leaders. The 1996 team had Reggie White, LeRoy Butler, Eugene Robinson, Santana Dotson, Sean Jones, Don Beebe and Frank Winters, all of whom could speak their mind without anyone dismissing it. \nThe 2010 team featured cornerback Charles Woodson, safety Nick Collins, defensive end Ryan Pickett, receiver Donald Driver, tackles Mark Tauscher and Chad Clifton and linebacker Desmond Bishop. Most led by example, but Woodson knew exactly what to say and when to say it. \n“Wood led by example, but he always understood the right time to step up and talk,” Burnett said. “When there was an opportunity to stand up and talk to the team he would, but he was talking at the right time so you knew it was genuine, that it was coming from the heart.” \nBurnett is considered a leader in the secondary because of his experience and dedication to the game. But he’s not going to speak his mind the way Woodson did. It’s not his style. \nGuard T.J. Lang has been known to speak out in locker room settings, but his contributions are infrequent. He picks his spots. Guard Josh Sitton, who was released at the end of training camp, was more likely to command the room on a regular basis. \nTen-year veterans are a rarity in the draft-and-develop philosophy of general manager Ted Thompson. If the mixture isn’t quite right, a handful of veterans are left with a roster composed mostly of first-, second- and third-year players. It means every veteran becomes a leader, whether they’re suited for the role or not. \nWhen the Packers take the field Sunday in Tennessee, most of their veterans will lead by example. They are tenured members of a successful franchise, one for which Super Bowls are the expected prize. \nBut the true test arrives when a game goes south and the Packers could use a jolt. That’s when someone must take the lead, when actions are momentarily softer than words. \n“Nothing can be pre-determined,” Burnett said. “I think it’s just raw emotion that has to come out.” \nGreen Bay Packers defensive end Mike Daniels (76) during the Atlanta Falcons' 33-32 victory over the Green Bay Packers on Sunday, October 30, 2016, at the Georgia Dome in Atlanta, GA.

      "text": "Business Zuckerberg: ‘Crazy’ to say Facebook influenced election In this Tuesday file photo, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg delivers the keynote address at the F8 Facebook Developer Conference, in San Francisco. In an interview Thursday with “The Facebook Effect” author David Kirkpatrick, Zuckerberg said the idea that Facebook influenced the outcome of the U.S. election is a “crazy idea.” Eric Risberg — The Associated Press file By Barbara Ortutay, The Associated Press Posted: # Comments \nNEW YORK >> Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg says the idea that fake news spread on Facebook influenced the outcome of the U.S. election is “crazy.” \nStill, the majority of Americans (six in 10) say they get at least some news from social media , mostly Facebook, according to the Pew Research Center. While a lot of this news comes from established outlets — whether CNN or BuzzFeed News, misinformation spreads on Facebook just as information does, shared by users, recommended by software and amplified by both. \nSources of spurious information have ranged from news articles produced by “content farms” for the sole purpose of getting clicks, to “hyperpartisan” sites from both sides of the political spectrum, churning out stories that are misleading at best. \nCase in point: “FBI AGENT SUSPECTED IN HILLARY EMAIL LEAKS FOUND DEAD IN APPARENT MURDER-SUICIDE”— a fabricated headline from a fake news site called the Denver Guardian, was shared thousands of times in the days leading up to the election. \nIs it possible that voters were swayed for or against a candidate, much like those same people might buy a product after seeing an ad on Facebook? \nZuckerberg says voters deserve more credit. \nDuring an interview Thursday with “The Facebook Effect” author David Kirkpatrick, Zuckerberg said idea that people voted the way they did because of bogus information on Facebook shows a “profound lack of empathy” for supporters of Donald Trump. \n“Voters make decisions based on their lived experience,” he said. \nGiven the acerbic political contest from which the country just emerged, when countless longtime friends, even family, were unfriended, many are left to wonder if there would be an alternative American history being written today if it were not for Facebook, Twitter and the like. \nThis, after all, was the first truly social media election, playing out on Twitter and Facebook as much or more than it did on major networks, in living rooms and around watercoolers. \nBut isn’t social media just a reflection of our world as it exists? Has Facebook become an easy scapegoat when the answer is far more complex? \nWhile Pew found that many believe political discussions on social media to be “uniquely angry and disrespectful,” a comparable number have the same impression of face-to-face conversations when it comes to Democrats, the GOP, or another party. Advertisement \nFILTER BUBBLE? \nWhen it comes to Facebook users, Zuckerberg said almost everyone has friends on the “other side.” Even if 90 percent of your friends are Democrats, for example, 10 percent will be Republican. Still, that’s not a very big number, and the idea of a “filter bubble”— that social media allows people to surround themselves only with the people and ideas with whom they agree, has been a hot topic this election cycle. \n“By far the biggest filter in the system is not that the content isn’t there, that you don’t have friends who support the other candidate or that are of another religion,” Zuckerberg said. “But it’s that you just don’t click on it. You actually tune it out when you see it. I don’t know what to do about that.” \nA DIFFICULT LINE \nFacebook has long denied that it’s a publisher or a media company, or that it acts remotely like either. Its cheery slogan — to make the world more “open and connected”— seemingly invites a broad range of viewpoints, diverse, lively discussion and the free flow of information, rather than censorship. \nBut it could also make clamping down on fake news difficult. At a time when everyone seems entitled, not just to their own opinions, but to their own facts, one person’s misleading headline might be another person’s heartfelt truth. \n“We take misinformation on Facebook very seriously,” Adam Mosseri, the executive in charge of Facebook’s news feed, said in a statement to the tech blog TechCrunch this week. “We value authentic communication, and hear consistently from those who use Facebook that they prefer not to see misinformation.” \nFacebook acknowledges that it has more work to do, and it seems to be putting a lot of faith in the power of data, artificial intelligence and algorithms as the solution. \nOver the summer, Facebook fired the small group of journalists in charge of its “trending” items and replaced them with an algorithm. The catalyst appeared to be a report in a tech blog, based on an anonymous source, that the editors routinely suppressed conservative viewpoints. \nSubsequently, fake stories ahead of the election began to trend.",

      "text": "Bernie would have lost. If you’ve been sharing that post on Facebook that reads, “ Bernie would have won in a landslide ,” you need to stop. Neither party has been able to hold the White House for three terms since the passage of the 22nd Amendment, with only one exception. Further, the implementation of new state issued ID requirements, and long lines, suppressed the participation of voters of color in key swing states, and this would have been the case regardless of whose name appeared on the ballot. Further, white voters made up 69% of voters in 2016. The President-elect won 58% of white voters overall. 53% of white women voted for him. 63% of white men voted for him. All of my fellow Bernie Sanders Primary and Caucus voters out there need to acknowledge these facts and the data that demonstrates the role of racial prejudice in defining the white vote, regardless of gender, regardless of socioeconomic class, regardless of age, regardless of education. From the “Southern Strategy,” to the “Reagan Revolution,” to the present day, racial animus has been front and center in white voter targeting and mobilization. No Democratic presidential candidate since 1964 has won the majority of white voters in a presidential election. (Go ahead, Google it).\nTalking heads, pundits, meme makers, and social media rant writers tend to put bias before all else. And this is fine when it comes to providing Stephen Colbert, Samantha Bee, Jon Oliver, Trevor Noah, and other comics engaging in a social critique with material. But it’s not ok when it comes to making decisions that impact our lives. To paraphrase Daniel Patrick Moynihan, everyone is entitled to invent their own opinions, but no one is entitled to fudge the facts.\nHere is why Hillary Clinton lost, and why Bernie Sanders would have lost as well:\nThe fact is that this was not an election decided by voters who were rejecting the establishment . If the President-Elect was a riding a wave of animus toward the elites in power, if voters were trying to send a message to the professional politicians, we would have seen a wave of Senate seats flip parties. But we did not see this. Arizona, Florida, Indiana, Missouri, North Carolina, Nevada, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin all preserved the party in power. Only New Hampshire and Illinois saw a change. Republican Senate candidates explicitly pursued a strategy of ticket splitting . But ticket splitting did not occur. The same story can be told district by district in the House of Representatives . Voters in contested races did not reject incumbents, or their crony-insider political party machines. They reelected the establishment and gave them a mandate .\nThe fact is that this was not an election decided by voters who are socioeconomically poor . The majority of voters who made less than $50,000 voted for her, and the majority of those making more than that amount voted for him . This disparity is not one that emerged as a result of tremendous General Election organizing efforts, or the absence thereof. The evidence that his support was not actually amongst those with low incomes was exposed by none other than Nate Silver on May 3, 2016 — the day of the Indiana Primary — entitled, “ The Mythology of Trump’s Working Class Support .” There’s plenty of good debates going on about the appeal of the economic populist message in this election cycle, but as Nikole Hannah-Jones pointed out on Democracy Now , the majority of folks disadvantaged by a neoliberal, globalized economy that relies on automation, outsourcing, depressed wages, and so forth, did not vote for him, they voted for her.\nFurther, she points out that we cannot ignore the role of state issued photo ID laws in states considered to be the bellwethers for those making economic populist arguments. In Ohio, and Florida, voters not possessing state issued IDs are forced to vote on provisional ballots. This was not the case in previous elections. In Indiana, and Wisconsin, you cannot vote without a state issued photo ID. This was not the case in previous elections. In Michigan, if you wish to vote, but do not have a state issued photo ID, you must complete an affidavit. This was not the case in previous elections. A Harvard Law School study found the following:\nThe expenses for documentation, travel, and waiting time are significant — especially for minority group and low-income voters — typically ranging from about $75 to $175. When legal fees are added to these numbers, the costs range as high as $1,500. Even when adjusted for inflation, these figures represent substantially greater costs than the $1.50 poll tax outlawed by the 24th amendment in 1964.\nIn other words, not only was his support from wealthier folks, his support was from folks who were not impacted by state issued photo ID laws. Turning them out simply meant reminding them to vote. Her support, her turnout vote, because it came from low-income folks, was disproportionately and aversely impacted by state issued photo ID laws, and long lines . Translating the support of her pool of support amongst registered voters into actual ballots cast was a Herculean task, because it meant fighting voter suppression, whose egregiousness we don’t yet have a full grasp of , but whose deleterious effect is undeniable in places like North Carolina .\nThe fact is that this was an election decided by voters who are anti-immigrant . He launched his campaign by calling Mexicans criminals, drug dealers, rapists, and murderers. His most repeated refrain from the campaign trail and the convention was, “Build a wall and make Mexico pay for it!” He went on to propose a ban on Muslims. On the campaign trail he singled out Syrian and Somali refugees . Amongst all of the election night bloviating, no one, not one single journalist or analyst pointed to the August survey of his supporters demonstrating that\n91% of those who strongly supported him wanted that wall built . This survey occurred at the same time he met with Mexico’s President, and delivered his “modified” stance on immigration. When divided along partisan lines, 63% of Republicans and GOP leaning independents supported his border wall, and 84% of Democrats and Democratic leaning independents opposed it. This was all of course, before he started saying in nationally televised debates and widely broadcasted rallies that “ illegal immigrants are pouring over the border to vote .” This led militant, white supremacist organizations, to grab their guns and deputize themselves to serve as\n“ poll watchers .” Something that Comedy Central tried to find the humor in on Election Day, but became impossible to laugh at because of the well-documented record of hate crimes he inspired.\nThe fact is that this was an election decided by white voters regardless of class, gender, or age . She won 90% of the Black vote, 70% of the Latino and Asian vote, and racked up similar margins in all other communities of color. In fact, one of the reasons why Arizona went from reliably red state to a contested one was because Native Americans offended by his “Pocahontas slurs,” including the Navajo Nation, supported her. White voters supported him. Half of white millennials voted for him, 40% voted for her, and 10% voted for a third party. Over 60% of white voters over 30 supported him. What makes this remarkable are the margins of both white men and white women voting for him. No Democratic Presidential candidate has won the white vote since 1964. When Lyndon Johnson signed the Civil Rights Act in 1964, he famously said, “ We have just delivered the South to the Republican Party .” Lee Atwater became notorious when he explained exactly how the GOP could reliably use the Southern Strategy of white resentment toward people of color to win the White House. History proved them both right. The GOP won in 1968, 1972, 1980, 1984, 1988, 2000, 2004, and 2016 because of the white vote.\nWhile it is true that white women saw some migration toward Democratic presidential candidates before September 11, 2001 , the data show that the margins of white women voting for Republican presidential candidates have remained reliable and steady ever since, regardless of who runs. In 2004 Bush won 55% of white women, compared to 44% for Kerry; in 2008 McCain won 53% of white women compared to 46% for Obama; and in 2012 Romney won 56% of white women compared to 42% for Obama. The first woman to become the Democratic Party’s nominee for the presidency — she, herself a white woman — lost the white women’s vote. 43% of white women voted for her, 53% of white women voted for him . The only group of white women she won, were college educated white women. That said, despite the fact that 76% of college educated white women stated their disapproval of his sexual conduct on October 23, on Election Day — when it counted — college educated white women only voted for her by a margin of 51% to 45%. Bill Clinton did better than Hillary Clinton among white women. (Let that sink in).\nAccording to Barney Frank “gays and Jews” are the only white men who vote for Democratic presidential candidates. In an article called, “ So Long, White Boy ,” Thomas Schaller writes that the only white men voting for Democratic presidential candidates are Union members, and even in that specific demographic, white men in labor only skew Democratic by single digits. The data show that white men reject Democratic presidential candidates, even when aggressively courted:\nWhat about Super-Bubba himself, Bill Clinton? By siphoning off 22 percent of the white male vote in 1992, Ross Perot would appear to have prevented Clinton from breaking the Democrats’ pattern. But more revealing is the fact that when in 1996 Perot’s support among white men fell by half, to 11 percent, Clinton’s support improved by a meager 1 percent. The truth is that Clinton was no more dependent on white male votes for his two wins than Gore and Kerry were penalized for garnering the same level of support from these voters in their two defeats.\nBill Clinton made inroads with white women when he ran for reelection in 1996, yet like all other Democratic presidential nominees since 1964, he lost white men by large margins. That said, Bill Clinton did not lose white men by the same margin Hillary Clinton did. White men handed the President-elect the keys to the White House . He won white men by 32 points. In 2012, Mitt Romney won them by 27. He didn’t just win by a larger margin of white men, he turned out a larger number of white men overall to the polls. In June of this year Nate Cohn wrote a column called, “ There Are More White Voters Than People Think .” And indeed, overall voter turnout in 2016 was nearly what it was in the record setting 2008 , but the difference was that a combination of the “enthusiasm gap” and voter suppression drove down turnout amongst voters of color by 10 points, while a self-proclaimed birther who in 2011 insisted that he was “more serious than ever” about running for president and sent “special investigators to Hawaii to uncover one of the greatest cons in history ,” drove up white voter turnout to a record high.\nThe fact is that no political party has held the presidency for three terms, with one exception . Since the 22nd Amendment established term limits for the presidency, there have been eight opportunities for a party to hold the presidency for more than two terms. 1988 is the one and only time that the incumbent party has emerged victorious . In May of 2015, in an article entitled, “ The GOP and Willie Horton: Together Again ,” Politico’s Roger Quote: :\nThe 1988 presidential campaign pitting George H.W. Bush against Michael Dukakis and the use of race to transform a losing campaign into a winning one is back in the news.\nThe ’88 Bush campaign was run by Lee Atwater and Roger Ailes… They were both tough as hell, political knife fighters and proud of it. Atwater was the campaign manager, Ailes was the media wizard, and Bush was merely the candidate. And the candidate wasn’t doing that great a job.\nDukakis had built up a 17-percentage-point lead during the summer, and Atwater was afraid the lead would become insurmountable. So the Bush campaign went on the attack. It had all the usual stuff like taxes and defense, but it also had Willie Horton.\nHorton was serving a life sentence without parole in Massachusetts for killing a man. He got a weekend furlough, fled and made his way to Maryland, where he broke into a home, tied a man to a joist in the basement, slashed his chest and stomach with a knife, then beat and raped the man’s fiancée. Horton was black. The couple was white. And Michael Dukakis was the governor of Massachusetts.\nAs Susan Estrich, the Dukakis campaign manager, would write: ‘There is no stronger metaphor for racial hatred in our country than the black man raping the white woman. If you were going to run a campaign of fear and smear and appeal to racial hatred you could not have picked a better case to use than this one.’\nBut how could George H.W. Bush, a Yankee Brahmin, a patrician known for his courtly manners and good nature, be persuaded to go along with such an attack? Atwater held a series of focus groups in an office in a shopping mall in Paramus, New Jersey, and then went to the Bush family home in Kennebunkport, Maine, with the results: Tell Dukakis voters about Willie Horton and they stopped being Dukakis voters.\nAtwater told Bush… And Bush’s response? ‘After that,’ Atwater said, ‘it was an easy sell.’\nThe 1988 equivalent of a political action committee (PAC) partisan independent expenditure group supporting Bush ran the first Willie Horton ad on primetime television, and then the Bush campaign put up its own ad, using footage of prisoners going through a revolving door. 89% of Black voters supported Dukakis, 70% of Latino voters supported Dukakis, but only 40% of white voters supported Dukakis . The one and only time a political party was able to hold the White House since the passage of the 22nd Amendment was when the GOP directly tapped into a reservoir of antipathy and resentment that coalesced because it directly appealed to authoritarianism and the many forms of racial prejudice motivating white voters .\nToday the data tells the same story. When the now President-elect launched his campaign, 54% of the GOP believed that “deep down President Barack Obama is a Muslim.” This when only 24% of Republicans had a favorable view of Islam . Therefore, his proposed ban on Muslims, promise to turn back refugees from Islamic countries, and plan to put mosques under surveillance struck a chord. At the same time, his support from those scoring high on the authoritarian scale was overwhelming and unyielding . He declared himself the “law and order candidate,” and referred to his supporters as the “silent majority” days after five police officers in Dallas were killed . He took the phrase “Make America Great Again” from Ronald Reagan’s 1980 campaign. And as Eoin Higgins wrote in April:\nYou’ve seen them. Printed on a white background with varying shades of blue and red, the signs are invariably held by middle-aged men and women. They’re waved in Donald Trump crowds alongside Confederate flags and dance in front of the stage while the billionaire speaks.\n“The silent majority stands with Trump.”\nWho are the silent majority? What does the term mean? And why are they coming out for Trump? The answer has its roots in the intense white backlash to the Civil Rights Movement and the Civil Rights Act. It’s a throwback to the coalition that helped Richard Nixon rise to power in 1968, and has much of the same connotations of white backlash to racial change and civil rights. Trump is tapping into that same coalition and ideology in his quest for the presidency.\nWhite backlash is back. And so is the silent majority.\nWe can talk all day and all night about this that or the other. But the facts and available data demonstrate this was a white backlash election that no Democratic candidate could have won.\nI voted for Bernie Sanders in the Primary. It is easy to buy into the narrative that Bernie’s economic populist message would have won over white voters, but the evidence doesn’t support that conclusion. Hillary Clinton’s white supporters and Bernie Sanders’ white supporters are ultimately the same — low income, college educated, Union members , etc. — with the exception of white millennials. but there aren’t enough white millennials in swing states to offset the white voters over 30 that the President-elect won . And the same “enthusiasm gap” and state issued photo ID laws, and long lines, leading to voter suppression would have applied. There are no models demonstrating that Bernie could have won more votes from voters of color than Obama.\nBernie wasn’t part of the Democratic Party machine, but as a holder of public office since 1981, he is the “establishment candidate” when pitted against someone who has never served in the military and never served in public office. That means Bernie would have been vulnerable to the same charge lobbed by the antithesis of a career public servant against Hillary Clinton:\n“This is just another politician talking folks. Every few years they promise, but nothing changes. Why haven’t you done it over the last several decades in public office?”\nBernie Sanders is a principled reformer, but so is Ted Cruz. And Cruz wasn’t the GOP nominee. This was never a battle of ideas regarding the future of this country. This was an election, history tells us, any Democratic Party candidate was highly likely to lose. This was a backlash election in which white voters rewarded the following statements with their votes:\n“They want open borders, amnesty, Muslims who are secret terror cell plants, and hell in the inner cities, and I’m the law and order candidate.”\n“They want to raise taxes and then turn around and give all of your money away to illegal immigrants and welfare queens instead of supporting our veterans and putting money back into your pockets.”\n“The rest of the world thinks President Obama is a joke because we won’t fight, so we need to bomb them without warning, and take them and their families out — water board them and worse — without apology, which is the opposite of the all talk and no action they offer.”\nWe need to stop repeating the lie that this election was decided by those left behind and those who feel as though they are outside of the system, and therefore must lash out against it. For all of the 60 Minutes segments and other media spotlight segments on former factory workers, this election was not decided by socioeconomically poor white people. Economic hardship bearing white voters who were able to cast ballots did not defeat Hillary Clinton. She won low-income voters. She won Union voters. But the number of poor whites is smaller than the number of middleclass whites. And the same state issued photo ID laws and long lines that suppressed the votes of voters of color suppressed the votes of poor whites. He might have bragged about how he loved the “poorly educated,” but the truth is that white people with college educations and middleclass to upper class incomes — those with checking and savings accounts, ample credit lines, and pensions and/or 401k retirement accounts — are the ones defeated her. White voters, regardless of class, have consistently voted for the GOP . Bernie would have lost them too.\nThe President-elect attacked and mocked Muslim, Latino, Asian, Black, and Native Americans without apology. This distinguished him in a crowded field of GOP candidates with extreme right wing policies. He was rewarded for not being “politically correct” and “telling it like it is.” We need to stop claiming that Bernie Sanders’ economic populism could have won this election, because that ignores the role of racism and xenophobia in this campaign as a net positive in the Electoral College outcome, and it ignores what is well documented regarding the white vote and the inability of parties to hold the White House for more than two consecutive terms. There may not be much we can do in the short term about the latter, but if we care at all about the future of this country and people who call it home, then we need to be honest about white voter bias.\nRacial animus was on the ballot. Chauvinism was on the ballot. White people voted for both.\nIf you have white skin and you’re unwilling to confront white supremacy, institutional racism, and anti-Black, anti-Muslim, anti-Latino, anti-immigrant, anti-Native American, and anti-API sentiment, then you’re part of the problem. This means doing intersectional work. On the campaign trail, she promised living wages and he opposed increases in the minimum wage . She stood strong with equal LGBTQI rights and he promised to appoint Supreme Court Justices to overturn equal marriage rights. Thousands upon thousands just spent months chanting “Trump that b*tch!” and selling/buying/wearing t-shirts reading, “Hillary sucks but not like Monica.” Again, either you’re willing to confront sexism, misogyny, and the suffocating, oppressive, marginalizing force of patriarchy, or you’re part of the problem. This applies to men and women.\nWhite men have not supported a Democratic candidate since 1964. Not one. White women have been targeted and treated as swing voters because they narrowly supported Bill Clinton in 1996, and nearly broke even for Al Gore in 2000. Hence the endless fights for “white soccer moms,” “young white women,” “single white women,” “college educated white women,” “married white women,” etc. And yet, when push came to shove, white women did not support a white woman. Overall, they preferred a white man who unapologetically incited and instigated racial violence, and serially and overtly perpetrated sexual violence. Black women, Native women, Latinas, Asian women, all other women of color made the opposite choice and voted for her — against him — by wider margins than men of color. There are substantive reasons for this. The US ranks 33rd in the world when it comes to women in office . These are facts, not footnotes.\nWhite Americans you either know that you fear, resent, and hate people of color, immigrants, and religious minorities, and don’t care that your heart is filled with fear, resentment, and hate. Or like Lorne Michaels, Jimmy Fallon, Billy Bush, and other white celebrities who played along, egged him on, and sought to humanize, endear, and ingratiate him to those who vote on emotional impulse, rather than measured consideration , you think you get a pass because “some of your best friends are Black.” You simply aren’t willing to distinguish your lack of prejudicial intent from the very real, tangible, measurable, and egregiously harmful racist outcomes you’ve supported with your actions. Whether you voted for him or not, if you’ve been attacking Jose Antonio Vargas for simply making a documentary called, “White People,” and asking him and the other 11 million undocumented US residents why they “cut the line” and “didn’t follow the rules”; if you’ve been saying the Black Lives Matter movement is anti-white, and dangerous, and violent, and you’re quick to share “Blue Lives Matter” posts, but say nothing when trolls begin attacking the character of the Black, Brown, or Native person who was just killed; if you’ve been saying that you have the right to wear offensive Halloween costumes without criticism, use racial slurs in everyday speech without consequence, (because rappers use them in their lyrics) that “political correctness is an attack on free speech,” “white privilege doesn’t exist because Asians earn more money than whites and get higher test scores,” or “affirmative action is reverse racism”; if you’ve been saying you’re “pro-life” while unarmed, innocent children are killed by neighborhood watch vigilantes, police officers, border patrol agents, and poisoned by lead and toxins already in their water and soil, or oil pushed through new pipelines, you are a racist.\nI’ve just written 4,000 well-researched words, but I know that the paragraph above this one is the only thing people will read. I know I will be labeled divisive and prejudiced. You can attack me as the messenger. But I’m reporting the facts. The only time in modern US history that a political party was able to keep the presidency for three terms was when anti-Blackness was placed front and center. White voting behavior in presidential elections since the passage of the Civil Rights act has been consistently and reliably anti-Democratic. Barack Obama won in 2008 and 2012 but lost amongst white voters in both elections. The Democratic Party nominated white men to head the ticket in 1968, 1972, 1976, 1980, 1984, 1988, 1992, 1996, 2000, and 2004, and lost the white vote in all of those elections. Don’t get me wrong white voters do not bear all of the responsibility for delivering the White House to a candidate who has never served in the military or in elected or appointed office. Between one in four and one in three Latino and API voters also cast ballots for him. Those whose families came to the US fleeing communism have been reliable GOP voters because of economic conservatism. Those who are adamantly anti-choice have been reliable GOP voters because they want to see Roe v Wade overturned. Those who are adamantly homophobic, trans-phobic, and hetero-normative, have been reliable GOP voters since George W Bush proposed a Constitutional amendment to “ban same sex marriage.” But just so we’re clear, there are many Latinos and API voters who enthusiastically cast ballots to uphold every form of racism. This was a white backlash election, but it was also one that revealed anti-Mexican, anti-Muslim, anti-Black, anti-Native, and anti-immigrant sentiments are deeply entrenched and very widespread in Latino and API communities.\nIf you’re still fixated on Wikileaks, and the DNC; if you’re still saying, “Hillary Clinton was the wrong candidate, Bernie would have won,” and all of the research I’ve done and presented above hasn’t convinced you, maybe this video the Guardian US published in May will break through.",

      "text": "After every supermoon, Twitter and Facebook are flooded with fuzzy photos of white glowing orbs kind of floating in a black sea of night.\nBut there are ways to take a good photo of the moon, even with a smartphone.\nMonday’s supermoon will be the closest in its orbit to Earth since 1948. It becomes full Monday morning.\nA super moon rises over the Boynton Beach Inlet in Boynton Beach, Florida on September 8, 2014. (Allen Eyestone / The Palm Beach Post)\n“Don’t make the mistake of photographing the moon by itself, with no reference to anything,” Bill Ingalls, a senior photographer for NASA, told National Geographic . “Instead, think of how to make the image creative — that means tying it into some land-based object. It can be a local landmark or anything to give your photo a sense of place.”\nThe moon begins to set behind the First Baptist Church during a lunar eclipse, October 8, 2014, in West Palm Beach. (Greg Lovett / The Palm Beach Post)\nHere are a few tips from Palm Beach Post photographer Lannis Waters that were first gathered by Palm Beach Post staff writer Staci Sturrock during supermoon events in 2014.\nStart early. If you’re using a smartphone, try to capture the moon when it’s still near Earth’s horizon, and find something to frame it with in the foreground (trees, buildings, people). “That will help with your exposure because there should still be some light in the sky, and add interest,” Waters says. Go long. Using a DSLR? “Obviously, shoot with as long a lens as possible,” Waters says. “A tripod will help, and is necessary if you’re using a very long lens. Ditto for a cable release or self-timer to avoid adding any vibrations when you fire a frame.” Look for foreground interest. You can’t go wrong composing your photo with either the Lake Worth or Juno Beach pier in the foreground. “Around here, it’s hard to find a place where you can get far enough back to make a skyline work, but there are places where you could get the moon rising through a stand of trees or over buildings, but you need to search for those in advance,” Waters says. (Jupiter Lighthouse, we’re looking at you.) Tap into an app. Waters likes the SkyView app, “which gives you an Augmented Reality view of the sky, and lets you type in the time and date you want so you can see where the moon will be at that time.” Make manual adjustments. Forgo your camera’s automatic settings and use the back of your camera to judge your exposure. “Otherwise the dark sky can make your shot overexposed,” Waters says. “And since the moon is reflecting daylight, the exposure is near what it would be for a sunlit scene in the daytime, so you don’t need a high ISO.”\n(Greg Lovett / The Palm Beach Post)",

Company Apologizes For 'Terrible Error' That Memorialized Users 12 November 2016, 12:54 am EST By Chris Loterina Tech Times Facebook has admitted it made a terrible error after messages began popping up in several Facebook profiles claiming that their owners are dead. The bug also affected Mark Zuckerberg's account. ( Steve Kovach | Twitter ) Advertisement \nFacebook found itself apologizing profusely last Nov. 11 after a creepy bug prompted the social media platform to begin telling many users that they have already died. The morbid glitch came with a very thoughtful message that condoled with the bereaved and also included some more words extolling the virtues of the \"deceased.\" Facebook Bug \nIn a statement sent to several media outfits, Facebook called the incident a terrible error and claimed it has taken the messages down with alacrity. It reported that the error has been completely fixed as of 4 p.m. ET, within the very same day the problem occurred. \nWhile the message cited the name of the supposed dead Facebook user, the message seems quite general. \n\"We hope people who love Katie will find comfort in the things others share to remember and celebrate her life,\" Facebook told Katie Rogers of the New York Times. Mark Zuckerberg Is Dead Too \nSimilar wordings were found in other profile postings only with different names. The account of Mark Zuckerberg , Facebook's CEO, was also reportedly infected by the same bug, although that one could have been easily set up by Facebook developers to minimize the bug's fallout. \n— Steve Kovach (@stevekovach) November 11, 2016 \nThere are those who suggest that it might be some form of a hoax perpetuated by a third-party hacker. This is really not surprising since Facebook has been hacked several times in the past. However, the message includes two services that Facebook seems to be promoting. This involves the Memorialized Account feature and is also linked to the existing legacy contact service found in the social media website's setting. \n\"You can tell us in advance whether you'd like to have your account memorialized or permanently deleted from Facebook,\" an entry in the social media platform's Help Center explained . \"Memorialized accounts are a place for friends and family to gather and share memories after a person has passed away.\" Facebook Policy \nOnce a person is reported dead, Facebook automatically memorializes his or her account and is treated as a company policy. While this service promises to immortalize your Facebook page, the legacy settings, on the other hand, will tell Facebook to permanently delete an account if the user dies. \nWhile the recent snafu, earned the ire of some affected users, others saw an opportunity to poke fun at the social media network or of themselves.

      "text": "Mike Dillon died on Monday in Arizona. He was 81. (Photo: Facebook) \nA man credited with revolutionizing the ammunition reloading industry, Mike Dillon, died this week. He was 81 . \nDillon was an aviator and a writer, but was best known for the work he did in the reloading business. “He got into this whole reloading business because he wanted to feed his machine gun and in those days that was no easy task,” reads his company’s website , which notes that Dillon made “the best reloading machines money can buy.” \nDillon was so passionate about machine guns, that he made a video about them. In a promo for “Machine Gun Magic,” Dillon explained how it all began. \n“When I was 6 years old and living in Florida, my Aunt Dot went to England as a nurse during World War II,” said Dillon in the video. “Before she left, she promised to bring me back a machine gun, and I was bitterly disappointed when she came home without it. She swears to this day that she had the gun, but they took it away from her when she went to get on board the ship.” \nThe M134 Minigun was nearing retirement when Dillon took a second look at it in the early 1990s. His work at Dillon Aero, Inc. revolutionized the Minigun , bringing it back to life. The gun is used by the US Army, foreign military forces, and has been a secret weapon in presidential motorcades . \nThe six-barreled, 7.62 mm NATO round chambered, electrically driven machine gun will make your ears bleed as it fires an average of 3,000 rounds per minute. Dillon Aero is responsible for the M134D variant of the M134, which is produced by several manufacturers. \nIn addition to his love of machine guns, Dillon worked as a 2nd officer for the TWA for 13 years. He also wrote for Air Progress Magazine. And some credit him with starting the warbird restoration movement of the 1960s, according to his company’s website . \n“Mike’s dedication to his family, his customers, and this country was exemplary,” read a tribute on the Dillon Precision website. “We hope to continue the legacy that Mike Dillon worked so hard to build and we will never forget the impact that he has had on us all.” \nDillon died on Nov. 7 in Arizona. He leaves behind his wife Carol, sons Christopher and Stephen, daughter Stephanie, and nine grandkids.",

He was 81 .\nDillon was an aviator and a writer, but was best known for the work he did in the reloading business. “He got into this whole reloading business because he wanted to feed his machine gun and in those days that was no easy task,” reads his company’s website , which notes that Dillon made “the best reloading machines money can buy.”\nDillon was so passionate about machine guns, that he made a video about them. In a promo for “Machine Gun Magic,” Dillon explained how it all began.\n“When I was 6 years old and living in Florida, my Aunt Dot went to England as a nurse during World War II,” said Dillon in the video. “Before she left, she promised to bring me back a machine gun, and I was bitterly disappointed when she came home without it. She swears to this day that she had the gun, but they took it away from her when she went to get on board the ship.”\nThe M134 Minigun was nearing retirement when Dillon took a second look at it in the early 1990s. His work at Dillon Aero, Inc. revolutionized the Minigun , bringing it back to life. The gun is used by the US Army, foreign military forces, and has been a secret weapon in presidential motorcades .\nThe six-barreled, 7.62 mm NATO round chambered, electrically driven machine gun will make your ears bleed as it fires an average of 3,000 rounds per minute. Dillon Aero is responsible for the M134D variant of the M134, which is produced by several manufacturers.\nIn addition to his love of machine guns, Dillon worked as a 2nd officer for the TWA for 13 years. He also wrote for Air Progress Magazine. And some credit him with starting the warbird restoration movement of the 1960s, according to his company’s website .\n“Mike’s dedication to his family, his customers, and this country was exemplary,” read a tribute on the Dillon Precision website. “We hope to continue the legacy that Mike Dillon worked so hard to build and we will never forget the impact that he has had on us all.”\nDillon died on Nov. 7 in Arizona. He leaves behind his wife Carol, sons Christopher and Stephen, daughter Stephanie, and nine grandkids.\nThe post Reloading industry innovator dies (VIDEO) appeared first on Guns.com .",

In an interview Thursday, Nov. 10, 2016, with \"The Facebook Effect\" author David Kirkpatrick, Zuckerberg said the idea that Facebook influenced the outcome of the U.S. election is a \"crazy idea.\" (AP Photo/Eric Risberg, File) Posted: Friday, November 11, 2016 4:07 pm | Updated: 6:47 pm, Fri Nov 11, 2016. Zuckerberg: 'Crazy' to say Facebook influenced election Associated Press | \nNEW YORK (AP) — Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg says the idea that fake news spread on Facebook influenced the outcome of the U.S. election is \"crazy.\" \nStill, the majority of Americans (six in 10) say they get at least some news from social media , mostly Facebook, according to the Pew Research Center. While a lot of this news comes from established outlets — whether CNN or BuzzFeed News, misinformation spreads on Facebook just as information does, shared by users, recommended by software and amplified by both. \nSources of spurious information has ranged from news articles produced by \"content farms\" for the sole purpose of getting clicks, to \"hyperpartisan\" sites from both sides of the political spectrum, churning out stories that are misleading at best. \nCase in point: \"FBI AGENT SUSPECTED IN HILLARY EMAIL LEAKS FOUND DEAD IN APPARENT MURDER-SUICIDE\" — a fabricated headline from a fake news site called the Denver Guardian, was shared thousands of times in the days leading up to the election. \nIs it possible that voters were swayed for or against a candidate, much like those same people might buy a product after seeing an ad on Facebook? \nZuckerberg says voters deserve more credit. \nDuring an interview Thursday with \"The Facebook Effect\" author David Kirkpatrick, Zuckerberg said idea that people voted the way they did because of bogus information on Facebook shows a \"profound lack of empathy\" for supporters of Donald Trump. \n\"Voters make decisions based on their lived experience,\" he said. \nGiven the acerbic political contest from which the country just emerged, when countless longtime friends, even family, were unfriended, many are left to wonder if there would be an alternative American history being written today if it were not for Facebook, Twitter and the like. \nThis, after all, was the first truly social media election, playing out on Twitter and Facebook as much or more than it did on major networks, in living rooms and around watercoolers. \nBut isn't social media just a reflection of our world as it exists? Has Facebook become an easy scapegoat when the answer is far more complex? \nWhile Pew found that many believe political discussions on social media to be \"uniquely angry and disrespectful,\" a comparable number have the same impression of face-to-face conversations when it comes to Democrats, the GOP, or another party. \nFILTER BUBBLE? \nWhen it comes to Facebook users, Zuckerberg said almost everyone has friends on the \"other side.\" Even if 90 percent of your friends are Democrats, for example, 10 percent will be Republican. Still, that's not a very big number, and the idea of a \"filter bubble\" — that social media allows people to surround themselves only with the people and ideas with whom they agree, has been a hot topic this election cycle. \n\"By far the biggest filter in the system is not that the content isn't there, that you don't have friends who support the other candidate or that are of another religion,\" Zuckerberg said. \"But it's that you just don't click on it. You actually tune it out when you see it. I don't know what to do about that.\" \nA DIFFICULT LINE \nFacebook has long denied that it's a publisher or a media company, or that it acts remotely like either. Its cheery slogan — to make the world more \"open and connected\" — seemingly invites a broad range of viewpoints, diverse, lively discussion and the free flow of information, rather than censorship. \nBut it could also make clamping down on fake news difficult. At a time when everyone seems entitled, not just to their own opinions, but to their own facts, one person's misleading headline might be another person's heartfelt truth. \n\"We take misinformation on Facebook very seriously,\" Adam Mosseri, the executive in charge of Facebook's news feed, said in a statement to the tech blog TechCrunch this week. \"We value authentic communication, and hear consistently from those who use Facebook that they prefer not to see misinformation.\" \nFacebook acknowledges that it has more work to do, and it seems to be putting a lot of faith in the power of data, artificial intelligence and algorithms as the solution. \nOver the summer, Facebook fired the small group of journalists in charge of its \"trending\" items and replaced them with an algorithm. The catalyst appeared to be a report in a tech blog, based on an anonymous source, that the editors routinely suppressed conservative viewpoints. \nSubsequently, fake stories ahead of the election began to trend.",

Has Facebook become an easy scapegoat when the answer is far more complex?\nWhile Pew found that many believe political discussions on social media to be \"uniquely angry and disrespectful,\" a comparable number have the same impression of face-to-face conversations when it comes to Democrats, the GOP, or another party.\nFILTER BUBBLE?\nWhen it comes to Facebook users, Zuckerberg said almost everyone has friends on the \"other side.\" Even if 90 percent of your friends are Democrats, for example, 10 percent will be Republican. Still, that's not a very big number, and the idea of a \"filter bubble\" — that social media allows people to surround themselves only with the people and ideas with whom they agree, has been a hot topic this election cycle.\n\"By far the biggest filter in the system is not that the content isn't there, that you don't have friends who support the other candidate or that are of another religion,\" Zuckerberg said. \"But it's that you just don't click on it. You actually tune it out when you see it. I don't know what to do about that.\"\nA DIFFICULT LINE\nFacebook has long denied that it's a publisher or a media company, or that it acts remotely like either. Its cheery slogan — to make the world more \"open and connected\" — seemingly invites a broad range of viewpoints, diverse, lively discussion and the free flow of information, rather than censorship.\nBut it could also make clamping down on fake news difficult. At a time when everyone seems entitled, not just to their own opinions, but to their own facts, one person's misleading headline might be another person's heartfelt truth.\n\"We take misinformation on Facebook very seriously,\" Adam Mosseri, the executive in charge of Facebook's news feed, said in a statement to the tech blog TechCrunch this week. \"We value authentic communication, and hear consistently from those who use Facebook that they prefer not to see misinformation.\"\nFacebook acknowledges that it has more work to do, and it seems to be putting a lot of faith in the power of data, artificial intelligence and algorithms as the solution.\nOver the summer, Facebook fired the small group of journalists in charge of its \"trending\" items and replaced them with an algorithm. The catalyst appeared to be a report in a tech blog, based on an anonymous source, that the editors routinely suppressed conservative viewpoints.\nSubsequently, fake stories ahead of the election began to trend.",

      "text": "\"I've seen Franklin Graham cry twice.\" Like Us on Facebook   \nAs senior director of strategic initiatives for Billy Graham Evangelistic Association (BGEA) and Samaritan's Purse, Campbell has traveled the world with Franklin. \nFor years, they've worked together to meet the needs of people who are suffering in the midst of natural disasters, war and extreme poverty. But in all their travels, Campbell can only remember two times he's seen his friend wipe away tears. \nOne was in a McDonald's in Thailand in November 2013, after Franklin treated a group of about 50 joyful, rambunctious orphans to lunch . \nThe second time happened that same week, when a small group of Christians from neighboring Myanmar (also known as Burma) formally invited Franklin to come to their country and preach about Jesus . \nAt the time, BGEA was holding a 3-day evangelistic Festival in Chiang Mai, Thailand . The group from Myanmar, one of the poorest countries in Asia, gave a generous gift to support the Thai Christians in spreading the Gospel . \n\"[The Burmese Christians] don't have a ton of money, but they had made a collection in their churches to bring a gift to a much wealthier church in Chiang Mai,\" Campbell said. \"And it moved Franklin. And he said, 'By God's grace, we'll do a Festival in Myanmar in 2016.'\" \nIt was an idea that would have sounded crazy to many people familiar with the country's politics. \nAt the time, Myanmar was still a military dictatorship-and had been for five decades. Christians faced government interference and seemingly insurmountable barriers when it came to holding a large-scale event in the predominantly Buddhist nation. \nIn short, a number of roadblocks stood between Myanmar's Christians and their dream of seeing the Gospel preached openly. \nBut, one by one, the roadblocks were demolished, culminating in Myanmar's landmark 2015 elections. For the first time in more than 50 years, the military began to cede some of its power, making way for gradual but significant changes. \nBy 2016, God had turned a seemingly impossible idea into reality, to the delight of the small but faithful group of Christians who had been praying for this kind of breakthrough for years. \n\"There is no way this could have come together-no way this could have come together-without God's hand in it,\" Campbell said. \nOn Nov. 18-20, the \" Love Joy Peace Festival with Franklin Graham \" will take place in Myanmar's largest city, Yangon. People from all over the country-including remote, mountainous areas a two-week journey away-will converge in Yangon, where Franklin Graham will openly preach the Gospel of Jesus Christ . \nGiven the obstacles Burmese Christians have faced-and continue to face-this is an historic event that has mobilized the church like never before. \nCampbell said local, regional and even some national government officials have expressed interest in attending. More than ever before, parts of the government seem to have an openness when it comes to Christianity, likely due in part to the work of Christian ministries like Samaritan's Purse. The global disaster relief organization has been there to help the people of Myanmar in the aftermath of catastrophes like the 2008 cyclone and this year's hail storms and floods. \nIn the midst of disasters, persecution and ongoing violence between the military and parts of the population, the Christian community has only gotten stronger. \n\"When times get tough, we draw close to Christ,\" Campbell said. \"The strongest Christian communities I've ever seen have been in countries where the church has been oppressed. \n\"Because by oppressing the church, the church is forced to come together and put aside their differences.\" Sponsored Watch Your Favorite Christian Films, 24/7. Click Here To Start Your Free Trial Today \nCampbell says various Christian denominations within Myanmar have been working side-by-side to get the Festival off the ground in record time. In fact, there was so much enthusiasm surrounding the Yangon Festival that BGEA agreed to hold an additional event in the city of Mandalay, about 400 miles to the north. \nAgainst all odds, Christianity is thriving in Myanmar, and the church there is young. These children were among thousands who attended a fun, engaging evangelistic event just for them. The program was held in Yangon in October as part of a lineup of events before the November Festival. \nIn October, more than 18,000 people attended a 3-day pre-Festival led by BGEA associate evangelist Robert Cunville. As the Gospel was proclaimed, 1,500 people indicated making first-time decisions to follow Christ. \nAround the same time, thousands of children attended an evangelistic event in Yangon, despite torrential downpours. It's estimated that about 2,000 children responded to the invitation to accept Christ . \nBelievers in Myanmar are praising God for such an amazing response, as they pray for the Holy Spirit to continue to move powerfully during the upcoming Festival in Yangon. \nCampbell said it's been humbling to watch Myanmar's Christians walk by faith, believing God would give them a miracle when the odds were stacked against them. \n\"It could have been stopped at any stage,\" Campbell said. \"But God was in control all the way along.\" \nNow he's asking believers around the world to pray for the people of Myanmar to be transformed by the love of Christ-something that already appears to be happening across the nation. \n\"One of my great prayers in all of this is, 'Lord, help us not to get in the way of what you're doing,'\" Campbell said. \"'Help us just to be a part of what You're doing there.' \n\"Because I'm so convinced, more and more ... that all we are is an answer to somebody else's prayers.\" \nWill you ask God to answer the prayers of brothers and sisters in Christ in Myanmar? Pray for an amazing move of the Holy Spirit before, during and after the Nov. 18-20 Festival. \n(c) Billy Graham Evangelistic Association www.billygraham.org",
