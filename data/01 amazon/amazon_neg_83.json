      "text": "Amazon is the web’s largest retailer, but the company has long been planning a move into the brick-and-mortar retail scene as well. Now, the reports  that Amazon was hard at work on a revolutionary corner store concept have finally achieved fruition. It’s called Amazon Go, and it looks like the future. Amazon Go is a system that marries physical stores with advanced algorithms and sensors to eliminate the need for a typical store checkout. Instead of packing all the things you need into a basket or cart and then dragged it through a tedious checkout process, you just grab whatever you need and walk out of the store.\n\nMUST SEE:  Watch the new SNL sketch that had Donald Trump fuming on Twitter \nIt sounds like a shaky concept at first, but only until you see just how advanced the technology really is. When you first walk into the store, you use your smartphone to open you virtual shopping cart. As you make your way around the store, a vast system of sensor tracks where you are, what you pick up, and what you take with you. The system even knows if you pick something up and then put it back, and will only charge you for things you actually intended to buy.\nOnce you’ve gotten when you came for, walking out of the store prompts the system to charge you for the products you’ve taken, and the receipt for your trip pops up automatically on the app. Amazon calls the system “Just Walk Out.”\nThe store, which is currently only open to Amazon employees but is poised to welcome all Amazon shoppers soon, is located in the company’s home town of Seattle. At present, only one store has been announced, but it’s clear that with a four-year development and considerable investment being made, the company has ambitions beyond Seattle.\nTrending right now: \nThe Surface Pro 5 might be the Windows 10 MacBook Pro alternative you were looking for Watch the new SNL sketch that had Donald Trump fuming on Twitter Microsoft kicks off 12 Days of Deals sale: Good Windows 10, Xbox One, and VR deals See the original version of this article on BGR.com",

      "title": "Amazon Announces Amazon Go No Checkout Retail Stores With Just Walk Out App Technology",
      "text": "by Brandon Hill   Amazon Announces Amazon Go No Checkout Retail Stores With Just Walk Out App Technology If you had asked us just yesterday what autonomous driving and supermarkets have in common, we likely would have just given you a blank stare. But today, Amazon says that it is combining machine learning with machine vision used in autonomous vehicles to take retail shopping to the next level.\nCalled Amazon Go, which Amazon bills as the “world’s most advanced shopping technology”, shoppers can walk into a retail store, scan a special Amazon Go barcode using the accompanying app, put your smartphone back in your pocket, grab your grocery items and go with ease. You never have to wait in a line, swipe (or insert) a credit card, or even use fingerprint-authenticated touch-less payment systems like Apple Pay , Samsung Pay or Google Pay . \nYour unique Amazon Bar code activates your virtual shopping cart, and as you start picking items off the shelf, it is automatically updated to reflect the item that you’ve put into your bag or “physical” shopping cart. If you put the item back on the shelf, it’s automatically removed from your virtual shopping cart. It’s rather ingenious, and the YouTube video below shows just how simple and effective the system is in practice. \n“We used computer vision, deep learning algorithms and sensor fusion much like you’d find in self-driving cars,” says Amazon. “We call it ‘Just Walk Out’ technology.” Just Walk Out is what allows the shelves to detect when an item is removed or returned and “places” them in your virtual shopping cart. All of the items that you’ve secured during your shopping trip are paid for as soon as you walk out of the store. And as you might expect, everything is charged directly to your Amazon account. \nWe’d like to learn a bit more specifics on what is going on behind the scenes with Amazon Go, but it won’t be long before we’ll find out. Amazon plans to launch its first Amazon Go retail stores in early 2017 for the general public. For now, the first Amazon Go “beta” store, which is located in Seattle, Washington, is only open to Amazon employees.",

Post to Facebook Amazon's new store may be the future of easy Customers in the Seattle store can walk in, grab items and walk out. No lines, no checkout.  //usat.ly/2gHRupA   Join the Nation's Conversation   Amazon's new store may be the future of easy Elizabeth Weise , USATODAY 11:04 a.m. EST December 5, 2016 Amazon announced its Amazon Go \"just walk out\" store on Dec. 5, 2016. These stores allow customers to enter, grab items and then leave without ever having to go through a checkout lane. An Amazon Go app and sensors track everything the customer has taken, charging their Amazon account as they leave. (Photo: Amazon) \nSAN FRANCISCO — Amazon is testing a grocery store in downtown Seattle that lets customers walk in, grab food from the shelves and walk out again, without ever having to stand in a checkout line. \nCustomers tap their cell phones on a turnstile as they walk into the store, which logs them into the store's network and connects to their Amazon Prime account through an app. \nThe service is called Amazon Go. It uses machine learning, sensors and artificial intelligence to track items customers pick up. These are then added to the virtual cart on their app. If they pick up an item they later decide they don't want, putting it back on the shelf removes it from their cart. \nThe Seattle-based company calls it, \"Just walk out technology.\" \nWhen the customer leaves, the app adds up everything the customer has taken and charges their Amazon account. \nAmazon said it began to work on the project in 2012. It is currently being tested by Amazon employees at the location at 2131 - 7th Avenue near Amazon's offices but will open to the public in early 2017, the company said.

      "text": "Share this Story Amazon Created a Mini Grocery Store of the Future Without Checkout Lines or Cashiers \nIn early 2017, Amazon will open its first Amazon Go store that is likely the future of grocery shopping (or shopping in general), assuming they want this to be. Think of a shopping experience where there are no cashiers or lines or self-checkouts and all you need is a smartphone. That’s Amazon Go. \nSo wait, how is this going to work? Amazon says that they have created a store that uses the same technologies you’ll find in self-driving cars. We’re talking computer vision, sensor fusion, and deep learning, all of which combined make up “Just Walk Out” technology. As that name suggests the idea behind Amazon Go stores is for you to walk in, grab what you need and then just walk out . \nAs you enter a store, all you need to do is scan the Amazon Go app on your phone and it prepares for you to start shopping. Then, you just grab the items you need, toss them in a bag, and walk out when finished. By utilizing that Just Walk Out technology, the store recognizes items as they are removed from or even put back on store shelves. When you leave and walk out, you will then be charged for the items you have grabbed. Again, you do so without checking out, without waiting in line for a cashier, or without swiping at a check stand. \nThe future, folks. \nThe Amazon Go store, at least in this first version you’ll see in the video below, reminds me of Trader Joe’s in a way. Amazon describes it as an 1,800 square foot space that carries staples like milk and bread, yet also has ready-to-eat meals and snacks, artisan cheeses, locally made chocolates, and chef-designed meal kits. It’s not a full-blown grocery store, but it could be a sweet spot to grab a quick lunch or dinner or some of the other essentials in a hurry. \nThe Amazon Go store is located in Seattle and is currently only open to Amazon employees as a beta. In early 2017, it should open to the public, as long as you have a supported phone and the Amazon Go app installed. \nYou can learn more at Amazon’s site . Be sure to watch the video below.

      "text": "\nOnline retail giant Amazon has launched the first Amazon Go, a convenience store without any cashiers or checkout counters , according to a report by Natt Garun of The Verge .\nAmazon Go works through a combination of cameras, sensors, and an app linked to a customer’s Amazon account. Customers scan the app upon entering the store, select the items they would like to purchase, and then leave the store without ever having to touch their wallet or bother with a checkout line. Sensors at the door scan the items as a customer leaves and then send the data to the app.\n“It’ll feel like shoplifting, except you’re actually being watched by more cameras than you can imagine,” Garun jokes.\nAmazon launches a beta of Go, a cashier-free, app-based retail shopping experience https://t.co/rxfkgpxwIQ by @bheater \n— TechCrunch (@TechCrunch) December 5, 2016 \nThe 1800-square-foot Amazon Go store is located in Seattle, Washington, where Amazon is based. It is currently in a beta phase and is open only to Amazon employees. It is expected to open to the public in early 2017.\nThe store will sell many items commonly found at convenience stores and gas stations.\n“We offer delicious ready-to-eat breakfast, lunch, dinner, and snack options made fresh every day by our on-site chefs and favorite local kitchens and bakeries,” says the Frequently Asked Questions page dedicated to the new store on the Amazon.com website. “Our selection of grocery essentials ranges from staples like bread and milk to artisan cheeses and locally made chocolates. You’ll find well-known brands we love, plus special finds we’re excited to introduce to customers.”\nAmazon Meal Kits are among the “special finds” Amazon Go is looking to introduce to more customers.\n“For a quick home-cooked dinner, pick up one of our chef-designed Amazon Meal Kits, with all the ingredients you need to make a meal for two in about 30 minutes,” the FAQ page continues.\nAmazon announced plans to delve into the meal-kit delivery services market back in March, Eater ‘s Lina Tran reported at the time. Those plans involved a partnership with Tyson Foods.\nMeal-kit delivery services generate billions of dollars in revenue annually.\n“Despite criticism that Blue Apron and like-minded businesses are extravagances with weighty environmental impacts, Blue Apron sells over 9 million meals a month and is valued at $2 billion,” Tran noted. “ The New York Times announced its own foray into the meal kit business last week.”\nBlue Apron and Marley Spoon offer “four family-sized” meal kits for about $140.00.\nTyson CEO Donald Smith said the use of “premium meats” would distinguish Amazon’s “chef-inspired” meal kits from those of its competitors.\n“We’ll teach them about the cuts of meat and where they come from,” Smith is quoted as saying in the Eater article. “We’ll help pre-cut, trim, dry age, smoke, marinate, and do the prep so all they have to do is cook it. And then we’ll inspire them to explore and cook with ingredients that they may have never used before.”\nAmazon Go store is checkout free: Amazon is testing a grocery store model in Seattle that work.. #business #news https://t.co/2rc4GqaOPs \n— Go Viral (@gv9871) December 5, 2016 \nIn regards to the question, “Why did you build Amazon Go?,” Amazon says it was looking to “push the boundaries” of related technologies.\n“Four years ago we asked ourselves: what if we could create a shopping experience with no lines and no checkout?” the FAQ page explains. “Could we push the boundaries of computer vision and machine learning to create a store where customers could simply take what they want and go? Our answer to those questions is Amazon Go and Just Walk Out Shopping.”\nThe Amazon Go store is located at 2131 7th Ave, Seattle, WA, on the corner of 7th Avenue and Blanchard Street. If the public launch goes well, Amazon will presumably open other Amazon Go locations.\n[Featured image by David McNew/Getty Images]\nAmazon Launches ‘Amazon Go’ Store With No Cashiers Or Checkout Counters [Video] is an article from: The Inquisitr News \n",

REUTERS/Rick Wilking \nAmazon.com Inc's new bricks-and-mortar grocery store doesn't have at least one thing that supermarkets have - queues at the checkout counter. \nThe online shopping giant's new 1,800-square-foot (167 square meter) convenience store, Amazon Go, in Seattle uses sensors to detect what shoppers have picked off the shelf and bills it to their Amazon account if they don't put it back. \nAmazon Go, currently available only for its employees, is expected to be publicly available early next year, the company said on Monday. \nApart from groceries such as bread and milk, the store also offers ready-to-eat breakfasts, lunches and dinners made fresh by on-site chefs and local kitchens and bakeries, Amazon said. \n(Reporting by Narottam Medhora in Bengaluru; Editing by Anil D'Silva) Next In Technology News",

      "text": "Amazon \nAmazon is breaking into physical retail in a new way.\nThe online retail giant revealed a concept for a physical store in a video published Monday.\nThe store, called Amazon Go , doesn't work like a typical Walmart or supermarket — instead, it's designed so that shoppers will use an app, also called Amazon Go, to automatically add the products they plan to buy to a digital shopping cart; they can then walk out of the building without waiting in a checkout line.\nThe idea is that Amazon's machine-learning technology can automatically identify when a product is added to your cart, so you don't have to do it yourself. When you leave the store, Amazon automatically charges your Amazon account.\nThe stores will sell ready-made food, staples like bread and milk, and other grocery products. Amazon says its stores are about 1,800 square feet, so they are relatively small compared with big supermarkets.\nAmazon internal plans show it could build 2,000 grocery stores across the US in the next decade, Business Insider previously reported .\nThe first Amazon Go store is scheduled to open to the public in Seattle early next year.\nHere's what it's like to shop in one:\nAmazon Go sells prepared foods and other grocery staples. Amazon \n\nEveryone who shops needs an Amazon Go app. You scan a QR code when you walk in. Amazon \n\nYou scan the app on a futuristic turnstile when you enter the store.

      "title": "Amazon opens a grocery store with no checkout line",
      "text": "By Seth Fiegerman \nPHILADELPHIA (CNN)–Amazon has gone after book stores, retail chains and electronics shops. Now it’s taking on grocery stores, with a twist.\nAmazon unveiled in a video a new physical store on Monday that sells a mix of “grocery essentials” and ready-made meals. But the key selling point is what it doesn’t have: checkout lines.\nThe video shows how customers check in at the entrance of the store with a new app called Amazon Go, then grab whatever items are needed. Amazon claims it can track the items automatically through a combination of computer vision and deep learning technologies. When you’re done shopping, you just walk out.\nThe first store is located in Seattle, where Amazon is headquartered.\nFor years, there have been rumors the e-commerce company would expand its dominance from digital to physical shopping. Amazon began experimenting with physical bookstores a year ago, but Amazon Go may mark its boldest bet on bricks-and-mortar yet.\nBy eliminating much of the staff needed to operate a store, Amazon keeps costs lower than traditional competitors. It’s also in a strong position to bring together data on its customers shopping habits online and offline to make better suggestions in all situations.\nHowever, Amazon’s move deeper into physical retail shops comes in a sensitive political climate. The company could be perceived as being a threat to some of the 3.4 million Americans who work as cashiers, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\nOn the campaign trail, Donald Trump repeatedly criticized Amazon and its founder Jeff Bezos for “getting away with murder tax-wise” and having “a huge antitrust problem.” Will the President-elect add “job killer” to the list of criticisms?\nAmazon’s effort to launch a new kind of retail store predates the rise of Donald Trump.\n“Four years ago we asked ourselves: what if we could create a shopping experience with no lines and no checkout? Could we push the boundaries of computer vision and machine learning to create a store where customers could simply take what they want and go?” the company says on an informational page about Amazon Go.\nFor now, Amazon is starting slow. The first store is only open to Amazon employees and will not be an option for the general public until early next year.\nThe-CNN-Wire & 2016 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

      "text": "ZDNet Japan Amazon kills the checkout line in new Amazon Go concept store Amazon Go is a new brick-and-mortar concept store that replaces cashiers and checkout lines with computer vision and artificial intelligence. | Topic: Artificial Intelligence \nThe Amazon Go concept store in Seattle. \nAmazon on Monday unveiled Amazon Go , a new brick-and-mortar concept store that replaces cashiers and checkout lines with computer vision and artificial intelligence. What's Hot on ZDNet FBI gains expanded hacking powers after lawmakers' attempts to block fail \nIn a video describing the project, Amazon said Amazon Go relies on technology similar to that of a self-driving car: computer vision, deep learning algorithms and sensor fusion. To make the technology more palatable for non-technical folk, Amazon is calling this particular feature set \"Just Walk Out\" technology. \nIn a nutshell, Amazon Go works in conjunction with a mobile app. The shopper must activate the app and scan it on a sort of high-tech turnstile upon entering. From there, it's pretty much free range. Shoppers pick up what they want and the Just Walk Out technology adds the item to their virtual cart. When the shopper leaves, the technology adds up the total in the virtual cart, charges it to their Amazon account and sends a receipt to the app. \nAccording to Amazon, the store has been in the works for four years. \n\"What if we could weave the most advanced machine learning, computer vision and AI into the very fabric of a store, so you never have to wait in line. No lines, no checkout, no registers -- welcome to Amazon Go,\" the Amazon video states. \nDespite the efforts of a handful of companies, grocery is still one of the last major product categories to develop a firm digital identity. There are online-only supermarkets such as British retailer Ocado , and in the US giants like Kroger, Walmart and Publix are experimenting with a combination of online and offline features aimed at easing some of the key burdens associated with grocery shopping. \nAmazon has also tried to tackle the grocery challenge with the rollout of its grocery deliver service AmazonFresh, and a rumored drive-in location where online grocery orders could be picked up. \nBut what Amazon is trying to do with Amazon Go is combine the convenience of in-store grocery shopping (i.e. having food immediately available) with the speed and seamlessness of online shopping. Long checkout lines have always been irksome and heckling self-checkout kiosks are only a mild improvement. If Amazon manages to alleviate those pain points in a store format that's reliable and replicable, Amazon Go could turn out to be grocery's game changer. \nThe 1,800 square-foot Amazon Go store is currently in beta in Amazon's hometown of Seattle. For now it's only open to Amazon employees, but it is expected to open up to the public in early 2017. \nSEE ALSO:",

      "text": "Amazon’s new grocery store will let you pick items off shelves and walk out without paying The company calls it Amazon Go. share Eighteen months ago, Recode spotted an Amazon patent that laid out the company’s vision for a new type of retail store with no lines and no cashiers. Today, Amazon confirmed they are working on such a project. Called Amazon Go , the store will allow Amazon customers to shop for grocery staples, prepared meals and sandwiches, and then walk right out without stopping to pay at a cashier or kiosk. Customers need only to scan their phone using the new Amazon Go app on the way in and out of the store, and their Amazon account will be charged for items taken. Sources previously told Recode that such a secret project was being run by Steve Kessel , a longtime Amazonian who once led the Amazon Kindle launch and who was close with CEO Jeff Bezos. The team working on Go has been experimenting with these ideas for as long as four years. Amazon says it is using a combination of AI, computer vision and data pulled from multiple sensors to allow customers to only be charged for the stuff they grab. It'll be interesting to see how good Amazon is at stopping theft and fraud in these new stores. The computer vision part seems to indicate that there are cameras being used to track you in the store, which some shoppers could find off-putting. The original Amazon patent described such an environment, but a spokeswoman did not respond to a question about cameras. The first Amazon Go location is at 2131 Seventh Avenue in Seattle, Amazon’s home town. It will open early next year. recode_divider",

      "text": "Tags: Amazon , Amazon Go \nAmazon has launched its own grocery store in Seattle, as the commerce giant looks to shine a light on a new “checkout free” shopping experience. \nLocated at 2131 7th Ave, Amazon Go is limited to a new 1,800 square feet of retail space and is only open to the company’s employees during the beta program, but it is expected to open to the public in early 2017. \nTo use the service, install the Amazon Go app, log in with your account credentials, and then simply put goods from the shelves in your bag and walk out. While it’s not entirely clear how it separates shoplifters from Amazon Go users, it represents a significant advance in the offline shopping experience and further cements Amazon’s encroachment on the brick-and-mortar world. Put a little more simply, this is pretty mindblowing stuff. \nThe store and shelves are equipped with “computer vision, sensor fusion, and deep learning,” according to the official FAQ page , meaning it can detect when products are removed and returned to the shelves. When you leave the store, your account is charged, presumably using facial-recognition technology. \nAmazon explains why it created Amazon Go: \nFour years ago we asked ourselves: what if we could create a shopping experience with no lines and no checkout? Could we push the boundaries of computer vision and machine learning to create a store where customers could simply take what they want and go? \nOur answer to those questions is Amazon Go and Just Walk Out Shopping. \nAmazon has been pushing further into the physical realm in recent years. Last November, it opened its first real physical bookstore — Amazon Books — at University Village in Seattle, the company’s home city. And it has continued to open staffed pickup points at universities across the U.S. \nWe’re seeing physical retailers increasingly turning to technology to streamline operations. Pittsburgh-based Bossa Nova offers stores nifty little retail robots that ensure shelves are always stocked, while just last week French startup Exotec raised $3.5 million to help warehouses dispatch goods using mini robots. Elsewhere, Walmart recently introduced its own mobile payments service in the U.S., as it strives to compete with online retailers by making it easier to check out. \nBut what Amazon is offering here is truly futuristic stuff — and it’s pretty amazing that it has managed to develop these smarts and open a physical store without much in the way of rumors leaking in advance. The future of brick-and-mortar grocery shopping is almost here.",

      "text": "Amazon's splashy video for Amazon Go — an all-seeing, all-knowing store where customers can grab items, toss 'em in a bag or pocket and just walk out without ever waiting in line — has obvious appeal. So obvious, in fact, that another tech company proposed the exact same concept more than 10 years ago.\nSEE ALSO: Amazon's new app will 'see' inside your packages\nAn IBM ad showcasing a smart store got major circulation on the airwaves in 2006 (when YouTube was nascent). It features a nefarious-looking character in a trench coat wandering the aisles of a supermarket, stuffing his pockets with items as other patrons and security guards shoot him looks of suspicion. As he exits the store through what looks like a security gate that \"flashes\" him, the guard calls out, \"Excuse me, sir!\"\nThe man stops and turns. The guard grabs a piece of paper dispensed from the gate: \"You forgot your receipt.\"\nThe ad is more than a decade old, so it likely wasn't predicting the same technologies that make Amazon Go possible, those being AI, machine learning and computer vision, mainly. Instead IBM was showing \"future store\" vision powered by RFID, a tech in widespread use today. An IBM white paper from March 2009 discusses, among other things, how RFID readers positioned throughout a store could detect movements of products within it.\nRFID is used in retail, but its presence is all but invisible to the customer, and most stores today still have a traditional checkout. We'll see in 2017 if the new technologies that power Amazon Go can finally bring IBM's vision of a \"smart store\" to reality.",

      "text": "Amazon \nThe Law of Jante, or Janteloven , is a sociological concept codified by Danish-Norwegian author Aksel Sandemose in his 1933 novel, A Fugitive Crosses His Tracks . It’s a system of ten rules that explain the behavioral tendencies of people in Scandinavian communities. At the core of Janteloven is a certain kind of humility and niceness, a downplaying of one’s own accomplishments in favor of social cohesion, and an emphasis on courtesy and the group dynamic. \nIf you’ve ever spent any time in the upper Midwest, you might have encountered the American analogue to this behavior: “Minnesota Nice”. People in Minnesota smile and wave at passers-by, they help their neighbors shovel sidewalks and driveways, and they are willing to jump-start a stranger’s car in an icy parking lot without any skepticism. In Jim Walsh’s new book, Bar Yarns and Manic Depressive Mixtapes , readers who might not have had the fortune to enjoy Walsh’s regionally published writings will get a taste of what the music critic version of “Minnesota Nice” is, from one of the Cities’ preeminent journalists. \nThis book, a collection of previously published articles and essays from several newspapers and magazines, is a lovingly curated set of writings that highlight one of the Twin Cities’ favorite music critics and scene cheerleaders. Walsh’s long career, which includes stints as Music Editor for the City Pages (a free weekly) and pop music columnist for the St Paul Pioneer Press , has also seen him published in Rolling Stone , SPIN , The Village Voice , Melody Maker , and the Utne Reader , among many others. Walsh is also a musician, playing in several bands, including REMs, a punk band that bubbled up in the same scene as The Replacements and Hüsker Dü. \nWalsh’s two previous books, The Replacements: All Over But the Shouting-An Oral History and The Replacements: Waxed Up Hair and Painted Shows—the Photographic History , both centered around one of the scene’s greatest bands. The Replacements, however, are mostly absent from this collection (although Slim Dunlap, the band’s latter-day guitarist, pops up a few times), probably because Walsh has already spilled quite of bit of ink on them. \nHis focus here, however, isn’t solely on the local scene, but on the joy and pain of what music means to listeners and fans. The chapters are divided into thematic chunks, based on the concept of the book being a ‘mixtape’ of sorts, each one covering a certain artist or mood, as any good mixtape would. If High Fidelity ‘s Rob Gordon was a music writer, he might call this method of categorizing and organizing a life’s work “autobiographical”, to the shock of his audience. \nThis isn’t just a collection of music criticism, as would be expected. There are stories of the Walsh family, including the love story of his parents, Ann and Jerry Walsh, and the musical bonds that connect Jim and his brothers. There are his ‘bar yarns’, stories about beloved and legendary bars (R.I.P. Nye’s Polonaise Room) and clubs in the Twin Cities. There are sociological treatises on youth culture, including a classic 1989 article on the metal scene at Minneapolis’ Lake Nokomis Park. There are painful reflections on an awkward teenage crush (“After the Dance”) that lead into the happy tale of a Pioneer Press reader who used Walsh’s column to ask his own crush to the prom. (She said yes!) \nFurther, there are recollections of uplifting moments at a Waterboys show, rock-bard tales of seeing legendary heroes bring beloved bands back to life (Big Star, in Chapter Eight’s “I Am the Cosmos”), and a deconstruction of rock’s most perfect song, The Faces’ “Ooh La La”, that morphs into Walsh’s own advice to youth. Regardless of the topic, every song, every tale, every life-affirming rock show is suffused with humanity and compassion, and it never feels forced.There are a lot of rock critics who focus on the negative, or shrug off the humanity of music fandom in favor of cold logic and bloodless analysis. Walsh is not that kind of writer or critic: even when he struggles with what’s going on around him, even when life is unbearably shitty, his writing is usually positive and filled with hope. \nThere might be no better example of this than the series of eulogies that make up Chapter Five, “Showman’s Rest”. In these articles, Walsh speaks lovingly and hopefully of life after the deaths of Kurt Cobain, Joey Ramone, and Clarence Clemons. The Cobain article, addressed to Cobain’s daughter Frances Bean, makes the bold claim that “I felt pretty close to your dad. Even though I never met him, I felt like I knew him.” (120) This heartfelt admission of being one fan among millions is, in part, what makes Walsh so unique as a rock critic. Simply by stating these the reader feels, in turn, like they are close to Walsh, in turn. \nThe most touching of his eulogies, however, is reserved for the artist who looms largest over the book: Prince. He gets his own chapter, “Prince in the 90’s” and the most recent previously published piece in the book, “I Wish U Heaven”, was published by Minnpost.com just hours after Prince’s tragic death in his Chanhassen studio, Paisley Park. Walsh’s words are simple, but express the loss that a lot of fans could not verbalize on that day: “…that’s what we mourn today—the loss of an eternal seeker, which all great artists are at heart” (254). The just held back tears glisten in Walsh’s bare words, for all to see. \nIn the heart of the book, buried in Chapter Seven (“The Beautiful Ones”), are a series of stories from 1995, 2001, and 2007 about the life-affirming power of rock ‘n’ roll. In the middle of the series, Walsh opines, “I have seen the past, present, and future of rock ‘n’ roll and his name is Ike Reilly” (p. 152). After a piece (reprinted from the liner notes of a Prince album) about the power of Prince’s famous Glam Slam shows, Walsh introduces his readers to a mostly-unknown singer-songwriter from Libertyville, Illinois. The almost breathless preview of an upcoming four-night stand by Reilly and his band at Saint Paul’s legendary Turf Club is followed by an equally breathless post mortem that lauds Reilly’s performance, his band, and the audience’s reaction, but makes the sober pronouncement that “it is never going to be like that again” (159). \nReilly never broke as big as Walsh predicted: his major label debut, 2001’s brilliant Salesmen and Racists , tanked and Reilly still lives in Libertyville, but Reilly, much like Walsh, still continues to plug away in true rock ‘n’ roll style. One of Reilly’s songs, that gives a title to one of Walsh’s articles, is called “Put a Little Love in It” and that sentiment seems to bind these two men, journalist and journeyman rocker, together. The final article in the chapter, “Magic”, is a wonderfully emotional reflection of a night spent with fellow fans at a 2007 Bruce Springsteen show. Walsh’s writing is always personal and graceful, but this thought stands out in a book full of deeply heartfelt admissions: “It felt more important this time, because I have kids, the world is in the shitter, and the voice in my head that says I’m not always on my game, not always inspired, not always doing the best I can, was quelled by an echo of my best self, and the music allowed me to forgive myself and showed me yet again how to be tougher than the rest of my former selves and keep going” (163). \nIn “One Love”, Walsh drags the “Minnesota Nice” straight into the light of a scorching Minneapolis intersection. His car broken down, waiting for a tow truck on the hottest day of the summer of 2001, Walsh recounts how 25 strangers offer to help him out in just 25-minutes, with Bob Marley’s “One Love” ringing in his ears. The story is Walsh’s writing in microcosm: a heartfelt personal story, ripe with hope and goodness, interspersed with knowledgeable music criticism that feels like a conversation with an old friend. With a litany of these kinds of deeply personal musical anecdotes, it would take a pretty cold hearted soul not to find some connection to Walsh here. I grew up in the Twin Cities and haunted some of the same clubs as Walsh. I saw him play in bands. I read his articles as a neophyte music fan in a city full of gods. I don’t know Jim Walsh, but (to paraphrase his words to Frances Bean Cobain) I feel like I know Jim Walsh. I left the Twin Cities in the early ‘90s, but these essays made me feel like I was catching up with an old friend after being apart for decades.

Club and to several Chunklet publications. In his previous iteration, he was an academic philosopher and he might have edited a book and published a few articles. Originally from the Twin Cities, he worships at the altars of The Replacements, Hüsker Dü, and The Hold Steady, as any good son of the Cities should. He re-reads The Catcher in the Rye at least once a year, but he has never tried to assassinate anyone. Share via",

      "text": "We’re getting closer to a future where we don’t ever have to talk to another human we don’t want to.\nAmazon announced Dec. 5 that it will be opening a grocery store in Seattle, Washington, in early 2017, where customers will be able to walk in, pick up they items they want to buy, and walk out. To achieve this, Amazon will launch an app called Amazon Go (also the name of the store) which hungry customers will use to register that they’re in the store. Amazon says that through sensors, computer vision, and deep learning, it’s able to track customers as they move about the store, and automatically register which items they pick up. If customers change their mind about an item, they just have to put it back and Amazon will automatically remove it from their bill. All the prepared food (salads, sandwiches, etc.) is handmade, but is sold in pre-packaged boxes, which thankfully are not made of cardboard or held together with Amazon Prime tape.\nAmazon imagines its vision for the future as utopian. Customers are tracked as they move around stores, buying their pre-packaged goods, and moving about in silence—cutting down on the massive lines that some grocery stores and lunch spots experience during the work week. However, there’s the very dystopian question of what that all means for the millions of people employed in the US as cashiers.\nAmazon Go eliminates the need for cashiers. There are 3.4 million of them in America. https://t.co/GwTvptSjMj \n— Christopher Mims™ (@mims) December 5, 2016 \nThere are roughly 3.4 million people employed as cashiers in the US, according to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). There are a further 4.5 million employed as retail salespeople, and 2.4 million employed as laborers that restock and move cargo around. Amazon already uses robots in its warehouses to move cargo around and bring items to humans to prepare for shipping. It’s also working on creating robots that can scan shelves for items and prepare those goods for shipping themselves. Reverse that process and those same robots could theoretically be used to restock the shelves of an Amazon Go store. In the near future, a store like this could potentially be run almost entirely without humans, barring those employed to prepare the food—although even that could one day be automated.\nThis comes after a drawn-out presidential election campaign in which eventual winner Donald Trump spent much of his time rallying Americans by telling them he would bring jobs back to the US. He recently took credit for saving a few hundred jobs at an air-conditioner factory in Indiana, even though the deal will likely cost taxpayers more than it saved by keeping the jobs in the US. Some are already predicting that the rise of autonomous vehicles in the next half-decade could decimate the trucking and taxi industries, and that artificial intelligence and natural-language understanding could cull millions of jobs from customer service and other service sectors. Automation could in the near future end up reducing the need for humans in the majority of sectors that they are most employed in today.\nIn Amazon’s future, for those that still have jobs, we’ll sit in our self-driven taxis to work until it’s time to pick up our boxed lunches and return for the afternoon, then head home to interact with chatbots and AI in virtual-reality worlds , while we wait for a drone to deliver us dinner.",

      "text": "E-commerce giant Amazon finally revealed long-awaited details about its new physical, grocery store concept on Monday morning. Called Amazon Go, the new store is touted to eliminate checkout lines and allow customers to pay for any items bought via their smartphones.\nThe 1,800-square foot Go store offers prepared foods--including fresh breakfast, lunch, dinner, and snacks--and will sell grocery staples like baked goods, bread, cheese, and milk. Amazon AMZN said its customers will find items from well-known brands (but declined to reveal which brands) plus items from artisanal merchants. Customers will also be able to pick up Amazon Meal Kits, the company’s Blue Apron-rival, which includes with all the ingredients one would need to make a meal for two in approximately 30 minutes.\nAmazon Go requires shoppers to scan their smartphones upon entering the store, and the company’s “just walk out” technology will detect when products are taken off shelves (or returned to shelves) and keeps track of what is in your virtual cart through these smartphones. When a shopper is done shopping, he or she leaves the the store, and the company will charge the Amazon.com account.\nAmazon didn’t reveal much about this detection technology, but said it was using a mixture of computer vision, artificial intelligence, and other technologies that are used in self-driving cars.\nGet Data Sheet , Fortune's technology newsletter. \nThe first Amazon Go store is located in Seattle and is open to Amazon employees, who are testing the new concept. Amazon said it will open to the public in early 2017.\nNoticeably missing from the announcement was any mention of Amazon's online grocery delivery and ordering service, Amazon Fresh, which was rumored to be part of the new concept. Also missing was a curbside pick-up service that was reportedly going to be included for online grocery orders that can be brought to a customer's car, a service that rival Walmart WMT also offers.\nThis isn't the first brick and mortar expansion for Amazon. The e-commerce giant has been steadily expanding its bookstores in cities in the U.S., including Seattle as well as Boston and San Diego.",

      "text": "\nAmazon has announced a new project which removes the checkout process from grocery shopping. Titled Amazon Go, Amazon will open a (brick and mortar) grocery store in 2017 in which customers can use a smartphone app to automatically pay for goods in something it’s calling “just walk out” shopping.\n“What would shopping look like if you could walk into a store, grab what you want, and just go?” Asks the narrator in the Amazon Go launch video. It appears that customers scan a QR code, presented by the app, upon entering the store to register it; then, they can begin shopping as they normally would and anything they pick up is added to a “virtual basket”. Anything returned to the shelf will be automatically removed.\nAmazon claims that customers can then walk out the store with the items on their person without going through the checkout process – presumably through an automatic payment with a credit card registered via the app. Check out how it looks in the trailer below.\n\nThe store, which is located at 2131 7th Ave, Seattle, WA, on the corner of 7th Avenue and Blanchard Street, is currently only available for Amazon employees, but Amazon said it would open to the public next year. If you’re interested, you can sign up for updates on when it will launch here .\nWhat are your thoughts on Amazon Go? Let us know in the comments.",

REUTERS/Mike Segar/File Photo \nAmazon.com Inc's new bricks-and-mortar grocery store doesn't have at least one thing that supermarkets have - queues at the checkout counter. \nThe online shopping giant's new 1,800-square-foot (167 square meter) convenience store, Amazon Go, in Seattle uses sensors to detect what shoppers have picked off the shelf and bills it to their Amazon account if they don't put it back. \nAmazon Go, currently available only for its employees, is expected to be publicly available early next year, the company said on Monday. amzn.to/2gbKMr5 \nApart from groceries such as bread and milk, the store also offers ready-to-eat breakfasts, lunches and dinners made fresh by on-site chefs and local kitchens and bakeries, Amazon said. \n(Reporting by Narottam Medhora in Bengaluru; Editing by Anil D'Silva) Next In Technology News",

      "title": "Did Amazon just reveal the grocery store of the future? What happened to the check-out lanes? | Relish Austin",
      "text": "0 \nIt’s a Monday morning in December, and I just saw a glimpse of the future of grocery shopping. \nA future where there are no check-out lines. Where sensors on the shelves can determine when you’ve picked up a product to buy but then change your mind and put it back. Where you scan your phone to walk into the store and then stroll out without interacting with a cashier. \nPeople have been debating what the future of grocery stores looks like for a long time: Smart carts , digital coupons, smaller stores, bigger delivery sales , etc. \nBut I’m not sure any of us were prepared for what Amazon just announced. \nEarly next year, Amazon will open its premiere Amazon Go store at 2131 Seventh Ave. in downtown Seattle. From the video and an FAQ on the website , we know that you’ll have to scan your phone in order to get into the store, but once they know you’re there, the sensor technology in the shelves will know when you’ve picked up a product (or put it back) based on the proximity of your phone to the shelf. \n(I have no idea what happens when the store is busy because the products themselves *probably* won’t have the sensors actually attached to them, but I could be wrong. Actually, I might be happy to be wrong on that one because it would require quite a bit of human labor to affix sensors to the thousands of products in the store, which would help offset some of the job losses that would come from not requiring cashiers.) Without check-out lines, the new Amazon Go store that will open next year in Seattle uses sensor technology to determine when you’ve selected an item, and then you are charged for it after you walk out of the stores. Contributed by Amazon \nThe retail giant could have picked any kind of goods to sell at this debut 1,800-square-foot store, but they picked food. Why? Food is expensive to ship and it’s a product we often prefer to buy ourselves because we rely on our senses to help us make purchasing decisions. Plus, if you just want to buy a drink or a sandwich, you don’t necessarily want to buy it online for delivery. \nThe store has been in development for four years, and it will feature “ready-to-eat breakfast, lunch, dinner and snacks made fresh every day by our on-site chefs and favorite local kitchens and bakeries. Our selection of grocery essentials ranges from staples like bread and milk to artisan cheeses and locally made chocolates. You’ll find well-known brands we love, plus special finds we’re excited to introduce to customers. For a quick home-cooked dinner, pick up one of our chef-designed Amazon Meal Kits, with all the ingredients you need to make a meal for two in about 30 minutes.” \nYes, they’ve tapped into one more major food trend by making those meal kits available for purchase in the store, too. \nIt sounds like the store already open to Amazon employees in a beta program, but the company announced that the store would be open to the public in early 2017. \nIs it crazy that I’m thinking about buying a plane ticket to Seattle just to check it out? Probably. \nAm I crazy to think that this could be what the future of grocery shopping really looks like? Probably not. View Comments 0 ",

(AP Photo/Mark Lennihan) AP Monday, December 05, 2016 11:52AM NEW YORK -- Amazon is testing a grocery store model in Seattle that works without checkout lines.Called Amazon Go, shoppers scan their Amazon app when they enter the store, and then sensors register items that shoppers pick up and automatically charge them to the Amazon app.If a shopper puts the item back they aren't charged.Check out the video Amazon released Monday:The store offers ready-to-eat meals, staples like bread and milk and meal-making kits.The store is in testing and open to Amazon employees in a beta program. It is expected to open to the public in early 2017.The e-commerce powerhouse has also been dipping its toe into the physical realm. It has opened three bookstores in California, Oregon and Washington with traditional check outs. Two more are in the works in Illinois and Massachusetts. Related Topics: ",

      "text": "Amazon has gone after book stores, retail chains and electronics shops. Now it’s taking on grocery stores, with a twist.\nAmazon has unveiled a new physical store on Dec. 5, 2016, that sells a mix of “grocery essentials” and ready-made meals. (Credit: From Amazon)\nAmazon unveiled in a video a new physical store on Monday that sells a mix of “grocery essentials” and ready-made meals. But the key selling point is what it doesn’t have: checkout lines.\nThe video shows how customers check in at the entrance of the store with a new app called Amazon Go, then grab whatever items are needed. Amazon claims it can track the items automatically through a combination of computer vision and deep learning technologies. When you’re done shopping, you just walk out.\nThe first store is located in Seattle, where Amazon is headquartered.\nFor years, there have been rumors the e-commerce company would expand its dominance from digital to physical shopping. Amazon began experimenting with physical bookstores a year ago, but Amazon Go may mark its boldest bet on bricks-and-mortar yet.\nBy eliminating much of the staff needed to operate a store, Amazon keeps costs lower than traditional competitors. It’s also in a strong position to bring together data on its customers shopping habits online and offline to make better suggestions in all situations.\nHowever, Amazon’s move deeper into physical retail shops comes in a sensitive political climate. The company could be perceived as being a threat to some of the 3.4 million Americans who work as cashiers, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\nOn the campaign trail, Donald Trump repeatedly criticized Amazon and its founder Jeff Bezos for “getting away with murder tax-wise” and having “a huge antitrust problem.” Will the President-elect add “job killer” to the list of criticisms?\nAmazon’s effort to launch a new kind of retail store predates the rise of Donald Trump.\n“Four years ago we asked ourselves: what if we could create a shopping experience with no lines and no checkout? Could we push the boundaries of computer vision and machine learning to create a store where customers could simply take what they want and go?” the company says on an informational page about Amazon Go.\nFor now, Amazon is starting slow. The first store is only open to Amazon employees and will not be an option for the general public until early next year.\n47.606209 -122.332071 ",

      "title": "Amazon opens a grocery store with no checkout line",
      "text": "NEW YORK– Amazon has gone after book stores, retail chains and electronics shops. Now it’s taking on grocery stores, with a twist.\nAmazon unveiled in a video a new physical store on Monday that sells a mix of “grocery essentials” and ready-made meals. But the key selling point is what it doesn’t have: checkout lines.\nThe video shows how customers check in at the entrance of the store with a new app called Amazon Go, then grab whatever items are needed. Amazon claims it can track the items automatically through a combination of computer vision and deep learning technologies. When you’re done shopping, you just walk out.\nThe first store is located in Seattle, where Amazon is headquartered.\nFor years, there have been rumors the e-commerce company would expand its dominance from digital to physical shopping. Amazon began experimenting with physical bookstores a year ago, but Amazon Go may mark its boldest bet on bricks-and-mortar yet.\nBy eliminating much of the staff needed to operate a store, Amazon keeps costs lower than traditional competitors. It’s also in a strong position to bring together data on its customers shopping habits online and offline to make better suggestions in all situations.\nHowever, Amazon’s move deeper into physical retail shops comes in a sensitive political climate. The company could be perceived as being a threat to some of the 3.4 million Americans who work as cashiers, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\nOn the campaign trail, Donald Trump repeatedly criticized Amazon and its founder Jeff Bezos for “getting away with murder tax-wise” and having “a huge antitrust problem.” Will the President-elect add “job killer” to the list of criticisms?\nAmazon’s effort to launch a new kind of retail store predates the rise of Donald Trump.\n“Four years ago we asked ourselves: what if we could create a shopping experience with no lines and no checkout? Could we push the boundaries of computer vision and machine learning to create a store where customers could simply take what they want and go?” the company says on an informational page about Amazon Go.\nFor now, Amazon is starting slow. The first store is only open to Amazon employees and will not be an option for the general public until early next year.\nBy Seth Fiegerman",

      "text": "Amazon has gone after book stores, retail chains and electronics shops. Now it’s taking on grocery stores, with a twist.\nAmazon unveiled in a video a new physical store on Monday that sells a mix of “grocery essentials” and ready-made meals. But the key selling point is what it doesn’t have: checkout lines.\nThe video shows how customers check in at the entrance of the store with a new app called Amazon Go, then grab whatever items are needed. Amazon claims it can track the items automatically through a combination of computer vision and deep learning technologies. When you’re done shopping, you just walk out.\n\nThe first store is located in Seattle, where Amazon is headquartered.\nFor years, there have been rumors the e-commerce company would expand its dominance from digital to physical shopping. Amazon began experimenting with physical bookstores a year ago, but Amazon Go may mark its boldest bet on bricks-and-mortar yet.\nBy eliminating much of the staff needed to operate a store, Amazon keeps costs lower than traditional competitors. It’s also in a strong position to bring together data on its customers shopping habits online and offline to make better suggestions in all situations.\nHowever, Amazon’s move deeper into physical retail shops comes in a sensitive political climate. The company could be perceived as being a threat to some of the 3.4 million Americans who work as cashiers, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\nOn the campaign trail, Donald Trump repeatedly criticized Amazon and its founder Jeff Bezos for “getting away with murder tax-wise” and having “a huge antitrust problem.” Will the President-elect add “job killer” to the list of criticisms?\nAmazon’s effort to launch a new kind of retail store predates the rise of Donald Trump.\n“Four years ago we asked ourselves: what if we could create a shopping experience with no lines and no checkout? Could we push the boundaries of computer vision and machine learning to create a store where customers could simply take what they want and go?” the company says on an informational page about Amazon Go.\nFor now, Amazon is starting slow. The first store is only open to Amazon employees and will not be an option for the general public until early next year.\n47.606209 -122.332071 ",

      "text": "Amazon has started (December 5) trialing its new grocery store \"Amazon Go\" among employees in Seattle using \"Just Walk Out\" technology, where there are no queues, no cashiers, and no registers.\nAs a customer enters the store -- which exists for employees-only in Seattle for the moment -- the app's virtual shopping cart records items picked up, even recognizing when an item is put back on a shelf. The app does not require the use of a cart or basket, instead using a system of advanced algorithms and sensors to record selected products. Leaving the store prompts automatic payment, and the app sends the user a receipt for their purchases.\nAmazon has not confirmed when or whether Amazon Go might be rolled out elsewhere, although this seems highly likely, but the Seattle store will be open to the public (who have downloaded the app) from early 2017 .\nWatch the Amazon Go video here: https://youtu.be/NrmMk1Myrxc",

It is expected to open to the public in early 2017. \nThe e-commerce powerhouse has also been dipping its toe into the physical realm. It has opened three bookstores in California, Oregon and Washington with traditional check outs. Two more are in the works in Illinois and Massachusetts. \n.",

      "text": "Amazon opens a grocery store with no checkout line By Seth Fiegerman, CNN | Updated - Dec 5th, 2016 @ 10:23am 0  Amazon \nNEW YORK (CNNMoney) — Amazon has gone after book stores, retail chains and electronics shops. Now it's taking on grocery stores, with a twist. \nAmazon unveiled in a video a new physical store on Monday that sells a mix of \"grocery essentials\" and ready-made meals. But the key selling point is what it doesn't have: checkout lines. \nThe video shows how customers check in at the entrance of the store with a new app called Amazon Go, then grab whatever items are needed. Amazon claims it can track the items automatically through a combination of computer vision and deep learning technologies. When you're done shopping, you just walk out. \nThe first store is located in Seattle, where Amazon is headquartered. \nFor years, there have been rumors the e-commerce company would expand its dominance from digital to physical shopping. Amazon began experimenting with physical bookstores a year ago, but Amazon Go may mark its boldest bet on bricks-and-mortar yet. \nBy eliminating much of the staff needed to operate a store, Amazon keeps costs lower than traditional competitors. It's also in a strong position to bring together data on its customers shopping habits online and offline to make better suggestions in all situations. \nHowever, Amazon's move deeper into physical retail shops comes in a sensitive political climate. The company could be perceived as being a threat to some of the 3.4 million Americans who work as cashiers, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Introducing #AmazonGo , a new kind of store with no lines and no checkout. https://t.co/WMii0bWevi pic.twitter.com/OmZdzobA5F \nOn the campaign trail, Donald Trump repeatedly criticized Amazon and its founder Jeff Bezos for \"getting away with murder tax-wise\" and having \"a huge antitrust problem.\" Will the President-elect add \"job killer\" to the list of criticisms? \nAmazon's effort to launch a new kind of retail store predates the rise of Donald Trump. \n\"Four years ago we asked ourselves: what if we could create a shopping experience with no lines and no checkout? Could we push the boundaries of computer vision and machine learning to create a store where customers could simply take what they want and go?\" the company says on an informational page about Amazon Go. \nFor now, Amazon is starting slow. The first store is only open to Amazon employees and will not be an option for the general public until early next year. \nCopyright 2016 Cable News Network. Turner Broadcasting System, Inc.

      "text": "Shopping at Amazon's Futuristic Grocery Store Feels Like Shoplifting (But It's Not) The shelves have smart sensors that detect which items you remove and replace. By Betsy Mikel Betsy Mikel is the owner of Aveck , a content consultancy that helps businesses big and small solve word problems of all sorts. She writes about innovation, creativity, entrepreneurship, and technology. Mikel holds a journalism degree from the University of Missouri, Columbia.   \nJeff Bezos and Amazon are at it again. This time it's not books, and it's not drones. They're reinventing grocery stores. \nLeveraging technology akin to self-driving cars, Amazon Go just opened the doors on its first checkout-free, cashier-free and line-free grocery store in Seattle. Amazon's calling it \"just walk out technology.\" \nFour years ago, Amazon decided to tackle an everyday problem. The most time-consuming aspect of grocery shopping is often waiting to check out. Even with self checkout kiosks, the lines can be brutal. There's always that person just in front of you who can't seem to figure out how to scan their carton of eggs. \nWhat if you could just pick up what you needed off the grocery store shelves and walk out? That's exactly the concept Amazon is testing with this new 1,800-square-foot grocery store. \nHere's how it works. Customers scan the Go app as they enter the store, which opens their virtual cart. Then, super smart technology tracks which items each customer takes off the shelves. They won't be charged if they remove an item but ultimately decide not to purchase. All they have to do is put it back. The sensors in the shelves will detect that the item has been replaced. A combination of computer vision, sensor fusion and deep learning allow customers to simply grab what they want and leave the store. Amazon automatically charges their accounts for what they walk out with. Their itemized receipt gets sent to their phone. \nThe Go shelves are presently stocked with ready-to-eat meals; grocery staples like milk, bread and cheese; and Amazon Meal Kits, which launched last spring. To start, shopping privileges are limited to employees as Amazon tests the concept in action. The company plans to open the store to the public in early 2017. \nWhile the checkout process doesn't require human staff, ultimately humans prepare the breakfast, lunch, dinner and snack items stocked on the grocery store's shelves. I'd also go so far as to assume humans have concepted, built, coded and tested the technology that makes the Go shopping concept work. If this redesigned grocery store of the future catches on and expands to other markets, Amazon is one step closer to total and utter world domination by weaving technology into IRL shopping experiences.

Amazon's new Amazon Go convenience store in Seattle has technology that can tell which items each shopper picks up, and it charges their Amazon account automatically. (Reed Saxon / Associated Press) Angel Gonzalez \nAmazon.com Inc. has built a convenience store that deploys a gaggle of technologies to allow shoppers to come in, grab items and walk out without going through a register. \nThe 1,800-square-foot store in downtown Seattle, officially dubbed Amazon Go, is the latest foray in bricks-and-mortar retail by the e-commerce giant, which already has bookstores (including one in San Diego ) and is working on drive-through grocery locations. \nIt's a sign that Seattle-based Amazon sees a big opportunity in revolutionizing the traditions of Main Street commerce. \nIn the much longer term, if the experiment works out and is adopted widely, it could radically transform the nature of work in the retail industry, much like self-driving car and truck technology threatens to upend transportation. \nThe Bureau of Labor Statistics said in a report this year that cashiers were the second-largest occupation, with 3.5 million employed in the U.S. \nThe Amazon Go store is open to Amazon employees participating in a testing program. It is expected to be open to the public in early 2017. \nAmazon says that what makes the store tick is a combination of computer vision, sensors and machine learning that it calls “Just Walk Out technology.” (Associated Press) \nIt can tell, say, when a particular shopper picks up a carton of milk from a physical shelf; the technology puts the milk in that shopper's virtual cart. It can also tell when an item is put back on the shelf — and removes it from the virtual cart accordingly. \nShoppers walking into the store would call up the Amazon Go app and hold their smartphone to a scanner as they would at an airport. Then they would pick up any combination of products and just walk out. Amazon would charge them after they leave the store. \nUnlike the self-serve registers present at many supermarkets, there's no need to stand in line or go through any register. The store features ready-to-eat meals and snacks prepared by on-site chefs or local bakeries. There are also essentials such as bread and milk, as well as high-end cheese and chocolate. \nAmazon says there will be well-known brands as well as “special finds we're excited to introduce to customers.” That includes an Amazon Meal Kit, which contains ingredients needed to make a meal for two in 30 minutes.

      "text": "News \nDropbox, being the de facto leader in paid cloud storage, rarely offers any discounts on its 1TB \"Pro\" service. But lately that seems to be changing, if only through Dropbox's retail partners: Dell offered a sizable discount on a year's subscription plus a gift card last month, and now Amazon is doing something similar. Head to this link and you can purchase a year of premium Dropbox service for $99, with a free $50 gift card for Amazon, effectively bringing down the price to just $49. \nThere are a few caveats. One, the offer is only available in the US, which is a bit of a bummer considering Amazon's international status. It's also not available for existing Dropbox Pro or Business subscribers, not even as a code you can keep to re-up later - Amazon's ToS for the sale says that service must begin on the day of purchase. (You might be able to wait out your current package and buy this discounted version when your storage shifts back to Basic, though.) Also, purchasing through Amazon will add Dropbox Pro as a recurring subscription in Amazon's Digital Orders system. It's auto-charged upon renewal, but can be cancelled at any time. \nThe Amazon gift card is a little less of an actual rebate than Dell's deal, but since Amazon offers so much more on its digital storefront, the credit is practically spendable as cash, especially if you're hunting for holiday gifts. The extra storage is accessible from all Dropbox tools and apps, including the web, Android phones and tablets, and desktop operating systems. Source:",

      "text": "NEW YORK (CNNMoney) — Amazon has gone after book stores, retail chains and electronics shops. Now it’s taking on grocery stores, with a twist.\nAmazon unveiled in a video a new physical store on Monday that sells a mix of “grocery essentials” and ready-made meals. But the key selling point is what it doesn’t have: checkout lines.\nThe video shows how customers check in at the entrance of the store with a new app called Amazon Go, then grab whatever items are needed. Amazon claims it can track the items automatically through a combination of computer vision and deep learning technologies. When you’re done shopping, you just walk out.\nThe first store is located in Seattle, where Amazon is headquartered.\nFor years, there have been rumors the e-commerce company would expand its dominance from digital to physical shopping. Amazon began experimenting with physical bookstores a year ago, but Amazon Go may mark its boldest bet on bricks-and-mortar yet.\nBy eliminating much of the staff needed to operate a store, Amazon keeps costs lower than traditional competitors. It’s also in a strong position to bring together data on its customers shopping habits online and offline to make better suggestions in all situations.\nHowever, Amazon’s move deeper into physical retail shops comes in a sensitive political climate. The company could be perceived as being a threat to some of the 3.4 million Americans who work as cashiers, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\nOn the campaign trail, Donald Trump repeatedly criticized Amazon and its founder Jeff Bezos for “getting away with murder tax-wise” and having “a huge antitrust problem.” Will the President-elect add “job killer” to the list of criticisms?\nAmazon’s effort to launch a new kind of retail store predates the rise of Donald Trump.\n“Four years ago we asked ourselves: what if we could create a shopping experience with no lines and no checkout? Could we push the boundaries of computer vision and machine learning to create a store where customers could simply take what they want and go?” the company says on an informational page about Amazon Go.\nFor now, Amazon is starting slow. The first store is only open to Amazon employees and will not be an option for the general public until early next year.\n40.712784 -74.005941 ",

      "text": "MONDAY, DEC. 5, 2016, 9:40 A.M. Amazon unveils ‘self-driving’ brick-and-mortar convenience store By Angel Gonzalez Seattle Times Twitter \nSEATTLE – Call it Amazon.com’s driverless store. \nThe tech giant has built a convenience store in downtown Seattle that deploys a gaggle of technologies similar to those used in self-driving cars to allow shoppers to come in, grab items and walk out without going through a register. \nThe 1,800-square-foot store, officially dubbed “Amazon Go,” is the latest beach in brick-and-mortar retail stormed by the e-commerce giant, which already has bookstores and is working on secretive drive-through grocery locations. \nIt’s clearly a sign that Amazon sees a big opportunity in revolutionizing the staid traditions of Main Street commerce. \nIn the much longer term, if the experiment works out and is adopted widely, it could radically transform the nature of work in the retail industry, much like driverless car and truck technology threatens to upend transportation. \nThe Bureau of Labor Statistics said in a report this year that cashiers were the second-largest occupation, with 3.5 million employed in the U.S. \nLocated on the corner of Seventh Avenue and Blanchard Street, the Amazon Go store is open to Amazon employees participating in a testing program. It is expected to be open to the public in early 2017. \nAmazon says that what makes the store tick is a combination of computer vision, sensors and machine learning that it calls “Just Walk Out technology.” \nIt can tell, say, when a particular shopper picks up a carton of milk from a shelf, and puts it in that shopper’s virtual cart. It can also tell when an item is put back on the shelf-and removes it from the virtual cart accordingly. \nShoppers walking into the store would call up the Amazon Go app and hold their smartphone to a scanner as they would at an airport. Then they just pick any combination of products and walk out. Amazon would charge them after they leave the store. \nUnlike the self-serve registers present at many supermarkets, there’s no need to stand in line or go through any register. The store features ready-to-eat meals and snacks prepared by on-site chefs or local bakeries. There are also essentials such as bread and milk, as well as high-end cheese and chocolate. \nAmazon says there will be well-known brands as well as “special finds we’re excited to introduce to customers.” That includes an “Amazon Meal Kit,” which contains ingredients needed to make a meal for two in 30 minutes.   9:40 a.m.",

      "text": "Please enable Javascript to watch this video NEW YORK -- Amazon has gone after book stores, retail chains and electronics shops. Now it's taking on grocery stores, with a twist.\nAmazon unveiled in a video a new physical store on Monday that sells a mix of \"grocery essentials\" and ready-made meals. But the key selling point is what it doesn't have: checkout lines.\nThe video shows how customers check in at the entrance of the store with a new app called Amazon Go, then grab whatever items are needed. Amazon claims it can track the items automatically through a combination of computer vision and deep learning technologies. When you're done shopping, you just walk out.\nThe first store is located in Seattle, where Amazon is headquartered.\nFor years, there have been rumors the e-commerce company would expand its dominance from digital to physical shopping. Amazon began experimenting with physical bookstores a year ago, but Amazon Go may mark its boldest bet on bricks-and-mortar yet.\nBy eliminating much of the staff needed to operate a store, Amazon keeps costs lower than traditional competitors. It's also in a strong position to bring together data on its customers shopping habits online and offline to make better suggestions in all situations.\nHowever, Amazon's move deeper into physical retail shops comes in a sensitive political climate. The company could be perceived as being a threat to some of the 3.4 million Americans who work as cashiers, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\nOn the campaign trail, Donald Trump repeatedly criticized Amazon and its founder Jeff Bezos for \"getting away with murder tax-wise\" and having \"a huge antitrust problem.\" Will the President-elect add \"job killer\" to the list of criticisms?\nAmazon's effort to launch a new kind of retail store predates the rise of Donald Trump.\n\"Four years ago we asked ourselves: what if we could create a shopping experience with no lines and no checkout? Could we push the boundaries of computer vision and machine learning to create a store where customers could simply take what they want and go?\" the company says on an informational page about Amazon Go.\nFor now, Amazon is starting slow. The first store is only open to Amazon employees and will not be an option for the general public until early next year.",

      "text": "December 5, 2016, 11:06 AM Amazon will launch a store with no checkout lane By Bloomberg News Shoppers will scan their Amazon Go app at the store’s entrance, and the technology will track which items they pick up and add them to a virtual shopping cart in real time. \n(Bloomberg) --Amazon.com Inc. unveiled technology that will let shoppers grab groceries without having to scan and pay for them -- in one stroke eliminating the checkout line. \nThe company is testing the new system at what it’s calling an Amazon Go store in Seattle, which will open to the public early next year. Customers will be able to scan their phones at the entrance using a new Amazon Go mobile app. Then the technology will track what items they pick up or even return to the shelves and add them to a virtual shopping cart in real time, according a video Amazon posted on YouTube. Once the customers exit the store, they’ll be charged on their Amazon account automatically. \nAmazon, No. 1   2016 Top 500 Guide , has been experimenting with the grocery business since 2007 when it started AmazonFresh in the Seattle area , where the company is based. The service offers doorstep delivery of a limited selection of groceries in 16 U.S. markets, including Los Angeles, New York and Boston as well as London. Amazon is also building facilities that let shoppers pull in and pick up grocers ordered online. Now the company, which already operates a few brick-and-mortar book and college-campus stores , is testing a kind of convenience store . \n“This is part of its efforts to do everything possible to make the Amazon name synonymous with retail, whether it’s online or offline,” said James Cakmak, an analyst at Monness Crespi Hardt & Co. “This is another test in figuring out what works and what doesn’t in the retail environment.” \nAmazon employees are testing out the 1,800-square-foot Seattle store, where they can buy ready-to-eat breakfast, lunch, dinner and snack options as well as grocery essentials from bread and milk to artisanal cheeses and locally made chocolates. Also available: Amazon Meal Kits, containing all the ingredients needed to make a meal for two in 30 minutes. \nTrying to eliminate checkout lines isn’t a novel concept, though most solutions so far still involve an extra step for customers at the end: actually checking out in some way. \nRetailers for years have tried various technologies to make the shopping process smoother and easier. Stop and Shop customers in some stores can use bar code-scanning guns that calculate the total cart cost as they add items. But people still have to go to a checkout station at the end to upload their bill and pay, or hand the scanner over to a cashier, which could still entail waiting in line. Other retailers have installed self-checkout computer systems that are known to be slow and buggy. Apple Inc. in 2011 rolled out a feature on its Apple Store app, which lets people pay for items at company stores without a register or a clerk -- though this still requires manually scanning the goods. \nIf Amazon’s plan works like as promised, the company will have succeeded in not only getting rid of the register and lines but also automating the entire buying process. \nAmazon says its “Just Walk Out” technology will use a combination of artificial intelligence software -- including computer vision algorithms that enable machines to identify images -- and sensors. The company said it started the project four years ago. Topics",

      "text": "on Dec 5, 2016, 11:39 AM TechSpot \nShoring up rumors on the matter, Amazon on Monday expanded its reach within the grocery industry with the trial launch of Amazon Go , a new type of store that could revolutionize the grocery shopping experience (assuming it takes root, of course). Here’s how it works. \nAmazon Go is a shopping experience with no lines, no checkouts and no registers. To enter the store, just open the Amazon app on your smartphone and scan it as you enter. From there, simply put your phone up and shop as you normally would. \nAmazon says that anything you pick up is automatically added to a virtual cart that’s associated with your account (similarly, anything you put back on the shelf is removed from your cart). When you’ve got everything you need, simply walk out of the store and you’ll be billed for your purchase directly through your Amazon account. \nThe technology, dubbed Just Walk Out, uses machine learning, computer vision, deep learning algorithms and sensor fusion that Amazon says is similar to what you’d find in self-driving cars. A detailed explanation of exactly how it works will have to wait, unfortunately, as Amazon isn’t yet ready to share that information. \nAmazon is currently testing the concept at a new 1,800 square-foot store in Seattle with select Amazon employees that are participating in the beta. There’s certainly more questions than answers at this stage although I suspect most of those will be answered in the coming weeks and months as Amazon aims to open the store to the public early next year.

      "text": "Amazon’s Grocery Store of the Future Has No Checkout Lines Shoppers simply pick up what they want and walk out share Standing in a long-ass checkout line at the grocery store when literally all you need is a package of Oreos/quart of almond milk/single head of garlic is awfully frustrating. At the grocery store of the future, such situations will be a thing of the past — and it’s already arrived in Seattle, courtesy of — who else? — Amazon. This morning the retail giant unveiled Amazon Go , a new mini-grocery store in its hometown where shoppers can simply pick up the items they want and walk out — no waiting in line or credit card-swiping required. When entering the store, shoppers simply scan an app on their phones, then Amazon Go uses a combination of “computer vision” and “sensor fusion” to track what they’re picking up (and putting back). As The Verge notes, “It’ll feel like shoplifting, except you’re actually being watched by more cameras than you can imagine.” After a customer walks out with their selections, their Amazon account will be charged accordingly. A video demonstrates the technology in all its glory (hey, Amazon — why can’t it be a dude who’s hemming and hawing over whether or not they should buy a cupcake?): The 1,800 square-foot market carries staples like bread and milk, plus fancy cheeses and chocolates and ready-to-eat, grab-and-go items — as well as Amazon’s very own meal kits , a collaboration with food giant Tyson. As The Verge reports, “The store is currently open in beta to Amazon employees only.” It’s expected to open to the public in early 2017. Will Amazon spread its cashier-less stores far and wide, and/or encourage other established grocers to experiment with “just walk out” technology? With Americans now spending more at restaurants than grocery stores , perhaps removing barriers like annoying checkout lines could encourage people to return to shopping and cooking for themselves. In the meantime, the company continues its quest to compete in the global food delivery sphere: Earlier this fall it expanded its restaurant delivery service into London , its first market outside the U.S.",

      "text": "Please enable Javascript to watch this video NEW YORK -- Amazon has gone after book stores, retail chains and electronics shops. Now it's taking on grocery stores, with a twist.\nAmazon unveiled in a video a new physical store on Monday that sells a mix of \"grocery essentials\" and ready-made meals. But the key selling point is what it doesn't have: checkout lines.\nThe video shows how customers check in at the entrance of the store with a new app called Amazon Go, then grab whatever items are needed. Amazon claims it can track the items automatically through a combination of computer vision and deep learning technologies. When you're done shopping, you just walk out.\nThe first store is located in Seattle, where Amazon is headquartered.\nFor years, there have been rumors the e-commerce company would expand its dominance from digital to physical shopping. Amazon began experimenting with physical bookstores a year ago, but Amazon Go may mark its boldest bet on bricks-and-mortar yet.\nBy eliminating much of the staff needed to operate a store, Amazon keeps costs lower than traditional competitors. It's also in a strong position to bring together data on its customers shopping habits online and offline to make better suggestions in all situations.\nHowever, Amazon's move deeper into physical retail shops comes in a sensitive political climate. The company could be perceived as being a threat to some of the 3.4 million Americans who work as cashiers, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\nOn the campaign trail, Donald Trump repeatedly criticized Amazon and its founder Jeff Bezos for \"getting away with murder tax-wise\" and having \"a huge antitrust problem.\" Will the President-elect add \"job killer\" to the list of criticisms?\nAmazon's effort to launch a new kind of retail store predates the rise of Donald Trump.\n\"Four years ago we asked ourselves: what if we could create a shopping experience with no lines and no checkout? Could we push the boundaries of computer vision and machine learning to create a store where customers could simply take what they want and go?\" the company says on an informational page about Amazon Go.\nFor now, Amazon is starting slow. The first store is only open to Amazon employees and will not be an option for the general public until early next year.",

      "text": "Machines with Brains 1 hour ago \nWe’re getting closer to a future where we don’t ever have to talk to another human we don’t want to. \nAmazon announced on Dec. 5 that it will open a grocery store in Seattle, Washington, in early 2017, where customers will be able to walk in, pick up they items they want to buy, and walk out. To achieve this, Amazon will launch an app called Amazon Go (also the name of the store) which hungry customers will use to register that they’re in the store. \nAmazon says that through sensors, computer vision, and deep learning, it’s able to track customers as they move about the store, and automatically register which items get picked up. If customers change their mind about an item, they just have to put it back and Amazon will automatically remove it from their bill. All the prepared food (salads, sandwiches, etc.) is handmade, but is sold in boxes, which thankfully are not made of cardboard or held together with Amazon Prime tape. \nAmazon imagines its vision for the future as utopian. Customers are tracked as they move around stores, buying their pre-packaged goods, and moving about in silence—cutting down on the massive lines that some grocery stores and lunch spots experience during the work week. However, there’s the very dystopian question of what that all means for the millions of people employed in the US as cashiers. Amazon Go eliminates the need for cashiers. There are 3.4 million of them in America. https://t.co/GwTvptSjMj \n— Christopher Mims™ (@mims) December 5, 2016 \nThere are roughly 3.4 million people employed as cashiers in the US, according to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). There are a further 4.5 million employed as retail salespeople, and 2.4 million employed as laborers that restock and move cargo around. Amazon already uses robots in its warehouses to move cargo around and bring items to humans to prepare for shipping. It’s also working on creating robots that can scan shelves for items and prepare those goods for shipping themselves. Reverse that process and those same robots could theoretically be used to restock the shelves of an Amazon Go store. In the near future, a store like this could potentially be run almost entirely without humans, barring those employed to prepare the food—although even that could one day be automated. \nThis comes after a drawn-out presidential election campaign in which eventual winner Donald Trump spent much of his time rallying Americans by telling them he would bring jobs back to the US. He recently took credit for saving a few hundred jobs at an air-conditioner factory in Indiana, even though the deal will likely cost taxpayers more than it saved by keeping the jobs in the US. Some are already predicting that the rise of autonomous vehicles in the next half-decade could decimate the trucking and taxi industries, and that artificial intelligence and natural-language understanding could cull millions of jobs from customer service and other service sectors. Automation could in the near future end up reducing the need for humans in the majority of sectors that they are most employed in today. \nIn Amazon’s future, for those that still have jobs, we’ll sit in our self-driven taxis to work until it’s time to pick up our boxed lunches and return for the afternoon, then head home to interact with chatbots and AI in virtual-reality worlds , while we wait for a drone to deliver us dinner.

      "text": "Please enable Javascript to watch this video NEW YORK -- Amazon has gone after book stores, retail chains and electronics shops. Now it's taking on grocery stores, with a twist.\nAmazon unveiled in a video a new physical store on Monday that sells a mix of \"grocery essentials\" and ready-made meals. But the key selling point is what it doesn't have: checkout lines.\nThe video shows how customers check in at the entrance of the store with a new app called Amazon Go, then grab whatever items are needed. Amazon claims it can track the items automatically through a combination of computer vision and deep learning technologies. When you're done shopping, you just walk out.\nThe first store is located in Seattle, where Amazon is headquartered.\nFor years, there have been rumors the e-commerce company would expand its dominance from digital to physical shopping. Amazon began experimenting with physical bookstores a year ago, but Amazon Go may mark its boldest bet on bricks-and-mortar yet.\nBy eliminating much of the staff needed to operate a store, Amazon keeps costs lower than traditional competitors. It's also in a strong position to bring together data on its customers shopping habits online and offline to make better suggestions in all situations.\nHowever, Amazon's move deeper into physical retail shops comes in a sensitive political climate. The company could be perceived as being a threat to some of the 3.4 million Americans who work as cashiers, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\nOn the campaign trail, Donald Trump repeatedly criticized Amazon and its founder Jeff Bezos for \"getting away with murder tax-wise\" and having \"a huge antitrust problem.\" Will the President-elect add \"job killer\" to the list of criticisms?\nAmazon's effort to launch a new kind of retail store predates the rise of Donald Trump.\n\"Four years ago we asked ourselves: what if we could create a shopping experience with no lines and no checkout? Could we push the boundaries of computer vision and machine learning to create a store where customers could simply take what they want and go?\" the company says on an informational page about Amazon Go.\nFor now, Amazon is starting slow. The first store is only open to Amazon employees and will not be an option for the general public until early next year.",

      "text": "Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, +2.67% shares are up 2.6% in Monday trading, on track to snap a five-session losing streak, after the e-commerce giant announced the new Amazon Go app, coming in early 2017. Unveiled via video available on the Amazon Twitter page , details so far are few, but the video shows customers walking into a store, activating the app, and then shopping freely. The clip promises \"no lines, no checkout,\" saying that technology including AI and machine learning has been \"woven into the fabric\" of the store so shoppers won't have to stop at a register to tally their purchase. Amazon gives a Seattle address at the end of the clip where the store seemingly will be located. Amazon stock is up 12.4% for the year so far while the S&P 500 index SPX, +0.59% is up nearly 8% for the same period.",

REUTERS/Rick …\nBy Narottam Medhora and Jeffrey Dastin\n(Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc said on Monday it has opened a brick-and-mortar grocery store in Seattle without lines or checkout counters, kicking off new competition with supermarket chains.\nAmazon Go, the online shopping giant's new 1,800-square-foot (167-square-meter) store, uses sensors to detect what shoppers have picked off the shelf and bills it to their Amazon account if they do not put it back.\nThe store marks Amazon's latest push into groceries, one of the biggest retail categories it has yet to master. The company currently delivers produce and groceries to homes through its AmazonFresh service.\n\"It’s a great recognition that their e-commerce model doesn’t work for every product,\" said analyst Jan Dawson of Jackdaw Research, noting that physical stores would complement AmazonFresh.\n\"If there were hundreds of these stores around the country, it would be a huge threat\" to supermarket chains, he said.\nThe S&P 1500 food retail index, which includes Kroger Co, Whole Foods Market Inc and other companies, was down nearly 1 percent in mid-day trading. Shares of Amazon were up about 2 percent.\nAmazon Go is available now for employees of the company and is expected to be open to the public early next year, Amazon said.\nIt was not immediately clear if and when Amazon Go would expand outside Seattle.\n\"The checkout lines are always the most inefficient parts of the store experience,\" said Neil Saunders, managing director of retail research firm Conlumino. \"Not only would you save a lot on labor costs, you actually would make the process much quicker for consumers and much more satisfying.\"\nStill, the grab-and-go experience would take getting used to, he said.\nSome people may \"feel like they stole\" an item, Saunders said. \"There is a bit of education needed for consumers.\"\nApart from groceries such as bread and milk, the store also offers ready-to-eat breakfasts, lunches and dinners made fresh by on-site chefs and local kitchens and bakeries, Amazon said.\nThat would make Amazon Go a potential competitor to fast-casual dining chains like Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc as well.\nAmazon Go is not the first physical store for the e-commerce giant to open.\nIt has a book store in Seattle, as well as pop-ups at malls where it displays Amazon devices such as the Kindle.\n\n(Reporting by Narottam Medhora in Bengaluru and Jeffrey Dastin in New York; Additional reporting by Lewis Krauskopf; Editing by Anil D'Silva and Andrew Hay)",
