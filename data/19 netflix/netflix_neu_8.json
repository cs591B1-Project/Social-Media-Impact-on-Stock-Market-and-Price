      "text": "One Day At A Time: Your First Look at Netflix's Heartfelt New Old Comedy   7:34 PM TV Guide \nIf the title of Netflix's upcoming sitcom One Day at a Time sounds familiar, that's because it should -- this new version is a reboot of the classic '70s and '80s Norman Lear sitcom. To get you hyped for the January premiere of the new series, the streaming service released the show's first trailer on Wednesday. \nThis new edition focuses on three generations of a Cuban-American family, led by newly single military veteran Penelope (Justina Machado), as they all try to live together under one roof. Two show business legends are involved: Rita Moreno, who is one of only two people in history to earn a Triple Crown of Acting (Oscar, Emmy and Tony), plays Lydia, Penelope's mother; and 94-year-old Norman Lear himself executive-produces, with Gloria Calderón Kellett and Mike Royce serving as showrunners. \nThe best shows of 2016 \nOne Day at a Time continues Netflix's push into multicamera sitcoms as it seeks to please all demographics. Netflix struck gold with Fuller House, a sequel to the '90s sitcom Full House, and found critical success with Ashton Kutcher's The Ranch. \nAll 13 episodes of One Day at a Time's first season arrive on Netflix Friday, Jan. 6. \n  One Day At A TimeJustina MachadoRita Moreno About Us",
