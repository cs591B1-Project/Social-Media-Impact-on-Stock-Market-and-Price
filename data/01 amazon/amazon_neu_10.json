Kind of like Uber for grocery shopping. Analysts believe the concept has the potential to change the face of retail. \nClick the above audio player to hear the full story.

      "text": "Image source: Getty Images.\nThe growth of Amazon 's (NASDAQ: AMZN) cloud-computing platform, known as AWS, has been a major factor in the company's recent spurt of profit growth. But in typical Amazon fashion, the company is prepared to completely backpedal on AWS' profits in order to beat out the competition and grab an even bigger piece of the market down the road.\nLast month, AWS announced its most significant price cuts since 2014. Storage pricing is down 16% to 28% depending on region, and its other cloud services are down 5% to 25% depending on the type of service and geography. Competitors like Google, the Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) subsidiary, plan to consistently cut prices every year, so Amazon is pressured to continue dropping prices itself. As a major driver of Amazon's profits, here's what investors need to know about the potential impact of these price cuts on Amazon's results.\nA look back More From Fool.com Motley Fool Founders Issue New Stock Buy Alert Forget GE! Heres how to play the largest growth opportunity in history Forget Apple! Heres a Better Stock to Buy He Made 21,078% Buying Amazon. Heres His New Pick After Amazon cut prices in March of 2014, it saw a significant decline in AWS operating margin. Despite growing revenue 49% for the year, AWS operating income declined slightly from $673 million to $660 million that year.\nBut the impact this time around probably won't be nearly as drastic. In 2014, Amazon cut prices up to 65% on storage, and other service prices were cut 7% to 61%. Last month's price cuts are fairly tame by those standards.\n ",

      "text": "Amazon made a series of service announcements at its recent AWS re:Invent 2016 conference. AWS and Salesforce extended their global strategic alliance delivering five new service integrations. The market leader in the Cloud space has no plans to slow down or rest on its laurels. Flickr \nAmazon.com Inc. (NSDQ: AMZN ) stock fell by more than 5 % over the last week. There were a series of service announcements last week by Amazon’s cloud-computing business, AWS, but they also didn't do much to support the falling AMZN stock. However, AWS re:Invent 2016 has reaffirmed that AWS is one strong reason to buy AMZN stock now. AWS is expected to top $12 billion in revenue this year, compared with $7.9 billion last year. The public cloud pioneer has gone from being the largest, most dominant public cloud service for web developers and startups to providing the most important technology to businesses: the enterprise cloud. Amazon has sustained its aggressive cloud approach, even though competitors like Microsoft (NSDQ:MSFT) and Alphabet (NSDQ:GOOGL) are trying to catch up, using their deep pockets. Here's why AWS is not slowing down anytime soon and will continue to drive AMZN stock to greater heights. On Course To Become A Complete Cloud Company \nAfter dominating the public cloud,the Vmware (NYSE:VMW) partnership and the expanded alliance with Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) has put AWS on course to capture enterprise cloud market as well. Large enterprise customers are shifting their buying behavior and the world is moving fast to “buy as you go” infrastructure and software models. AWS partnership with VMware ensures it has a proper hybrid cloud strategy to offer the enterprises the best of both public and private cloud. \nOnce the cloud of choice for cash-poor startups, AWS is wooing big businesses and software makers big time. Capital One, Hertz, AOL, John Deere, Workday and Netflix are some of the new big enterprise clients for AWS. The regulatory body, Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) and the White House are also now AWS users primarily due to its high security. This goes to show Amazon cloud computing’s high product standards and reinforces the fact the AWS competes in the market not based on its price but its quality. \nThe Fortune 5,000 companies make up 80% of global IT spending, out of which many still have in premise IT infrastructure. Given, all enterprises have not moved to cloud based IT infrastructure, there is an enormous market to be captured which will keep AWS hungry for more and more revenues. The battle is on as AWS, Microsoft, IBM, Google fight to win big business accounts (and the software vendors selling into those accounts) for their respective clouds. IT infrastructure has a market potential of $300 billion and AWS is on course to capture the bulk of it with its complete cloud offerings. \nAlso Read: Amazon Stock: Why Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) Stock Is A Good Buy Now Why AWS Is Winning \nThe success of AWS has been due to its double-down strategy, by constantly lowering prices and at the same time increasing the numbers of cloud services available for customers, all while producing outstanding financial performance. AWS isn’t just dominating because it was first (although that’s part of it), it’s also continuing to innovate at an astonishing rate, adding around 1000 new features every single year up from 722 just last year, according to a chart posted by CEO Andy Jassy during his re:Invent keynote. \nThe old guard of the enterprise data center — Cisco, Dell EMC, IBM, HP Enterprise, Oracle and VMware – have collectively seen meaningful declines in their businesses. In 2012, the year of the first re:Invent conference, these companies generated $221 billion in revenue. In 2016, in re:Invent’s fifth year, these same companies will record $206 billion in revenue. That equates to a stunning $15B reduction in revenues with the group shrinking, on average, by 3% every year. AWS Could Be The Biggest Business Of Amazon In Future \nBy itself, Amazon Web Services is worth $160 billion, or 44% of Amazon's enterprise value, according to Macquarie , which values the cloud unit at 9 times projected 2017 revenues. The gravity of the AWS ecosystem is just pulling everything in. Not only does it offer products and services, but it provides customers and the competition to create their own offerings. With the launch of SaaS subscription products in Marketplace, Amazon is moving toward some of the most valuable cloud purchases -- recurring subscription revenue. \nOne area where Dan Sholnick , a partner at Trinity Ventures, sees AWS running behind is artificial intelligence, which is part of a huge transformation in how developers will be building software moving forward. To catch up with Google and Microsoft which have a head start in this area, it launched its new Amazon AI platform. Rekognition, Amazon Polly, Amazon Lex are some important tools launched. \nAlso Read: AMZN Stock: Why Amazon.com, Inc. Is Primed For Growth This Holiday Season \nAmazon and Intel are also partnering to develop a reference design for developers interested in manufacturing Alexa-enabled speakers. They are taking the infrastructure and development underlying [the Amazon Echo] to a whole new level to take on the likes of Google, Microsoft and Apple (NSDQ:AAPL) who are already established in this space. New integrations in the Salesforce alliance are also on these lines, the Alexa Toolkit for Salesforce and Salesforce's Internet of Things Cloud with AWS’s IoT service. \nAWS CEO Andy Jassy mentioned the \"capability to build further up stack\" as another potential avenue to grow AWS and take on a market \"that's trillions of dollars worldwide\". Moving up the stack means offering more sophisticated applications, that's what it showcased at re:Invent 2016. Investor Takeaway \nAWS accounted for more than two-thirds of the company’s operating profits over the past four quarters despite representing less than 9% of revenue for that period. Wall Street expects Amazon’s operating income to nearly double this year to $4.1 billion and surge another 79% to $7.4 billion next year with the cloud business driving the bulk of those gains. AWS has thriving businesses across the enterprise software spectrum (growing 55% YOY ). According to Baird , AWS will represent just 5% of data center spend this year and less than 1% of overall enterprise IT spend. In other words, there is still significant room for growth as more enterprises embrace cloud technologies. AWS’s scale advantages coupled with an impressive track record of innovation and huge aspirations have the company extremely well positioned for the next decade. It should continue to drive Amazon's profit growth for some time. \nLooking for tech stocks? Check out our top stock picks from the tech sector , which have beaten the NASDAQ by over 106%.

      "text": "Slide: 1 / of 2 . Caption: Amazon \nSlide: 2 / of 2 . Caption: Amazon Author: Davey Alba. Davey Alba Business   11:04 am. 11:04 am Only Amazon Could Make a Checkout-Free Grocery Store a Reality Amazon \nOn Monday, Amazon took the wraps off Amazon Go , a real-world grocery store that comes with a twist: there’s no checkout process. You just grab the stuff you want and walk out; the order posts to your Amazon account afterwards. There are no cashiers, no lines, no fumbling for a credit card. And while experts agree that Go looks very much like the future of retail, it’s less clear whether Amazon has all of the pieces in place. \nThere’s one Amazon Go location so far, in Amazon’s hometown of Seattle, and it’s a relatively conservative amount of space: 1800 square feet holding perishable grocery goods like bread, milk, and cheese, as well as pre-made snacks and fresh meals. Amazon says all you need is the Amazon Go app to enter the store and start shopping. Or rather, that’s what you will need when Amazon decides to open the store up to civilians. Currently, Amazon Go is available only to Amazon employees in beta, with the public launch date set for early 2017. \nAs for how its “Just Walk Out Shopping” experience works, Amazon seems emphatically not to want to share details. It steeps its description of how the system works in buzzwords: computer vision, sensor fusion, and deep learning. It uses sensors throughout the store and artificial intelligence to discern tell direction customers are looking, even in a crowd, and can identify partially blocked labels. Beyond that, details are hazy. \nThat doesn’t mean it’s vapor, though. In fact, retail tech specialists and computer vision experts agree that Amazon’s advertised system is entirely plausible given the state of artificial intelligence, RFID, sensor and machine learning technologies today. No one’s put all of the pieces together in the way Amazon appears to have done—but then again, nobody else is Amazon. Amazon’s Choice \nIt’s not that retail tech companies haven’t already been hard at work tracking people as they explore physical stores and shop. A host of companies with names like RetailNext, Euclid, and Nomi, among others, are all part of this trend . It’s in a store’s interest to track people, after all, not just because they can target and upsell customers on more products and in-store promotions. Aggregate data on how customers move within a store and what they buy can help stores project purchasing trends, decide how to rearrange a layout, and create better reports for their shareholders, among other benefits. \nWhat previous efforts don’t do that Amazon Go does, though, is link products to individuals, says Brent Franson, CEO of Euclid Analytics, which gives stores the ability to track customers using their mobile Wi-Fi address, which helps smartphones interact with real-world items. (Other companies deploy tools like video analytics and beacons.) “Solving the problem of attaching the products to the person as they leave the store is going to require something new—or something we’re not aware of today,” Franson says. “Tying the two together at 100 percent accuracy, that’s a problem that’s hard to solve.” If Amazon is anything short of 100 percent accurate, Franson points out, that means someone essentially gets to steal from them, or Amazon mistakenly charges a customer for something she didn’t buy. Both scenarios are unacceptable. \nComplicating matters further is that the act of shopping is tricky, says Arun Nair, Chief Technology Officer and co-founder of RetailNext. Grocery shoppers often put things back in the wrong aisle. Certain food, like vegetables, are priced by weight. Families and other groups need to have one consolidated virtual cart, rather than being charged individually based on the smartphone in their pocket. \nAmazon may be uniquely situated to solve these problems, though. It has useful experience in other parts of its vast operations, such as an expertise in storing and picking out items in its various warehouses, and the AI competence that underpins its voice assistant Alexa, that could address these hurdles. “The technology building blocks are there,” Nair says. \nAccording to David Luan, the CEO of AI startup Dextro, Amazon probably does use a combination of sensors and technologies, as it claims. It would need computer vision to see what people are looking at and what they’re picking up, sensors on shelves, a mobile app to tie an individual user to their identity (going through a turnstile and scanning a QR code before entering the store is likely key in this), and perhaps some kind of souped-up RFID to verify individual items. Amazon \nBut the biggest advantage Amazon has in solving all of these problems? It runs the entire ecosystem. “Amazon controls what gets stocked in the store,” Luan says. “So Amazon can choose things that they are very good at identifying, and it can skip all the hard problems for a long time.” It’s hard for Amazon to go wrong when Amazon itself is controlling who’s going into the space, the infrastructure of the space, and the products in the space. And even if it does still have lots left to figure out, that’s what betas are for. \nFor now, Euclid’s Franson suggests you take the company’s word with a grain of salt. “If I were creating supermarkets from scratch, I would have done something like this,” Franson says. “I think this is the future of retail. I just expected, until we heard about this, that it was a little further out than it seems—or that Amazon is making it seem.”",

      "text": "Kelly Kanayama | 12.6.16 | 12:55 pm Share < br />this article: CREDIT: Amazon/YouTube \nA s if revolutionizing online shopping wasn’t enough, Amazon wants to change brick-and-mortar grocery shopping, too. It just launched Amazon Go, a shop with no cashiers and no waiting in line, at its headquarters in Seattle, with plans to expand to more stores if it works out. But how will Amazon’s no-checkout stores work ? \nLike many grocery stores, Amazon Go sells breakfast, lunch, dinner, and snack foods, but unlike many grocery stores, it leaves the whole payment process in the customer’s hands. Instead of scanning purchases and paying for them at a checkout counter, customers sign in with the Amazon Go app upon entering the store, take whatever items they want, and then pay once the items are charged to their Amazon account. Amazon is calling it “ a Just Walk Out Shopping experience ,” which sounds like a euphemism for shoplifting rather than the next thing in technological advancement. \nIf there’s no scanning involved, how does the app know what you’ve taken? With “ computer vision, deep learning algorithms, and sensor fusion ,” of course! Using these technologies that don’t sound menacing at all, the Amazon Go store automatically senses when you remove an item from the shelf or put it back, and calculates the payment due from there. It’s the same kind of tech that powers self-driving cars, except instead of propelling a big chunk of metal through the streets without any accidents or fatalities, it detects whether you took two or three cartons of orange juice. You did take that third one, didn’t you? Don’t lie. CREDIT: Amazon/YouTube \n(Shhh. Don’t talk. It can smell fear .) \nAt the moment, Amazon Go is still in trial mode and is only open to employees of Amazon. However, the company plans to expand this new shopping model in 2017, pending the success of its Seattle location. \nThere are a number of questions that Amazon will need to address before Amazon Go is fully operational, such as: What happens if the sensors make a mistake and overcharge you? If you hide behind a display so you can hoick a serious wedgie out of your butt crack, will the Amazon Go app know what you did? And how will Amazon offset job losses for cashiers? \nGranted, a variation of this last question comes up whenever a new automated process is announced for anything, but it still needs to be answered. About 3.4 million people in America work as cashiers. If Amazon Go’s no-checkout method of shopping takes over, they’re going to need new sources of income. \nThen again, that’s a big if. People will always need help in grocery stores, and unless the Amazon Go app is great at answering weird questions, it can’t replace that particular human element of shopping. As long as we keep getting confused or just plain screwing up when buying our groceries, America’s cashiers probably don’t need to worry.",

      "text": "On Dec. 5, Amazon unveiled its long-rumored convenience-store concept, dubbed Amazon Go, an 1,800-square-foot prototype in Seattle that features checkout-free shopping for ready-to-eat breakfast, lunch, and dinner options and a mix of staple products and meal kits. The most noteworthy part of the prototype is Amazon's \"Just Walk Out\" technology, which detects when products are taken from shelves and tracks purchases via a virtual shopping cart on the Amazon Go mobile app (which is scanned as consumers enter the store). According to The Wall Street Journal, this is part of a larger push by Amazon toward physical grocery stores, which could include \"more than 2,000 brick-and-mortar grocery stores,\" with future larger prototypes offering curbside pickup and drive-thru options. The announcement won't immediately affect our $900 fair value estimate, but we'll continue to monitor and adjust our valuation assumptions as Amazon's physical store aspirations become more visible.\nAbout the Author R.J. Hottovy, CFA, is a consumer strategist for Morningstar. The idea of Amazon physical stores seems to run counter to its successful online operations, which offer tremendous scale advantages. That said, we see a few reasons that this endeavor could succeed. First, by eliminating checkout and automating inventory replenishment--both of which could drive higher inventory turns versus traditional grocers--Amazon could effectively offset its lease costs. Second, we believe Amazon views physical stores as an extension of its logistics capabilities. While an 1,800-square-foot format would be too small to handle a high volume of order pickup/returns, we could see larger formats offering these capabilities. Third, by tying the service to a mobile app, it bolsters the network effect behind our wide moat rating while unlocking order frequency and targeted marketing opportunities. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, Amazon's well-earned reputation for convenience--a component of our brand intangible asset moat source--could be enhanced by checkout-free shopping.\nMorningstar Premium Members gain exclusive access to our full analyst reports, including fair value estimates, bull and bear breakdowns, and risk analyses.

ROBYN BECK/AFP/Getty Images Share Share on Facebook \nAmazon.com is launching its first brick and mortar store, which will enable customers to buy groceries without waiting at a checkout line. \nAs reported in the Wall Street Journal , the store is set to open in Seattle, and customers will use their smartphones to check-in at the entrance, while the store will determine what they have picked up, and charge them once they leave. If the store is a success, Amazon plans to open more than 2,000 locations. \nBut innovation and technology have gained ground in the grocery store biz during recent years, with services ranging from curbside pickup to self-checkouts. \nSo how does this affect you, the customer? And what do you think of all this innovation?

      "text": "Cloud Amazon embraces hybrid cloud as a means to push people to the public cloud Sure, AWS is now embracing hybrid computing, but with a nod to the future, not the past. Here's how they're using it as an on-ramp for public cloud. By Matt Asay | December 6, 2016, 11:37 AM PST Google Plus Image: iStockphoto/zakokor \nSome people are starting to suggest that Amazon Web Services (AWS) is finally having to acknowledge the reality of hybrid computing. Those people are wrong. \nAt AWS re:Invent, it's true that AWS announced a slew of products or programs (like Greengrass) to enable local-plus-cloud processing of data, but anyone reading this as anything other than an on-ramp to a public cloud future simply aren't paying attention. The hybrid on-ramp \nOvum analyst Tony Baer asked , \"The question for Amazon is how far it will be willing to grow its on premises footprint to accommodate this [hybrid] reality,\" but I think he's got the emphasis wrong. Despite Oracle and its ilk still owning the majority of enterprise workloads, the industry direction is clear, as Baer earlier noted: \"[B]oth [Oracle and AWS] predict that the bulk of on-premise servers will disappear by the middle of the next decade.\" \nThough Baer is correct to surmise that legacy servers will keep breathing in data centers, I don't believe AWS will do much to fight for yesterday's war. Already, Gartner analyst Thomas Bittman has uncovered a massive shift in where workloads are moving: According to Bittman , public cloud VMs have grown 20X over the years while private cloud growth putters along at 3X growth. \nWhy? Because \"New stuff tends to go to the public cloud, while doing old stuff in new ways tends to go to private clouds. And new stuff is simply growing faster.\" \nSEE: Hybrid cloud isn't cloudy enough, suggests new Forrester data \nIn other words, I see the AWS nod to hybrid workloads as more a matter of collecting modern workloads rather than trying to rescue legacy workloads. It's also a way, as AWS product strategy chief Matt Wood told me in an interview during AWS re:Invent, to \"skate to where the puck is heading.\" Must-Read Cloud",

Sean Rossman , Elizabeth Weise and Edward Baig , USA TODAY 7:46 p.m. EST December 6, 2016 Many retailers and tech companies have tried, and failed, to make grocery shopping less dire. (Photo: Getty Images) \nSAN FRANCISCO — In Amazon Go's world , shoppers walk into a supermarket, grab an item, and walk out. No scanning. No card swiping. \nSounds fantastic. But will it work? \nRetailers and tech companies have long tried to fix what we hate most about grocery shopping — time wasted in long lines, tedious barcode scanning and waiting around for receipts. They’ve tried everything from self-checkouts to home delivery, to mobile pay and even fridges that order for you. Amazon just opened a grocery store without a checkout line \nFor all the hope and fanfare these solutions heralded, grocery shopping has yet to hit the express lane. \nSome fixes have worked (kind of) and some have been massive fails. Here's a list of the six that have been part of the grocery checkout mix for the past decade or so. Self-checkout \nShirley Cook of Philadelphia buys four packages of mini-blinds at the self service check out at a Home Depot store in Philadelphia, PA on April 15, 2004. (Photo: Eileen Blass/USA TODAY) \nThis was supposed to be the killer application that made grocery shopping easy. Sadly, it didn't quite happen that way. Too often shoppers ran into problems scanning or otherwise getting the systems to work. While the lanes still remain in many stores, others are beginning to pull them out. The parent company of Albertsons, Vons and Pavilions said last month it is taking self-checkout lanes from 96 stores of 352 it has in southern California, according to the Orange County Register . As of 2016, 41% of shoppers in North America have used them, according to Nielsen. Delivery rebound \nOnce upon a time, all grocery stores delivered. You called down in the morning, put in your order and later that afternoon the delivery boy would come by with food to make dinner. The rise of supermarkets and car ownership ended that for the most part. But the concept has come back several times, though not always successfully. \nIn the dot-com bubble of the late 1990s, Webvan was the poster child for online grocery delivery. It offered grocery delivery in ten U.S. markets, launching in 1996 and going bankrupt in 2001 after losing millions of dollars. Other dot-com grocery delivery businesses that launched at the time included Peapod, HomeGrocer.com and Kozmo.com. Only Peapod remains, though much diminished from its heyday. \nGeorge Shaheen, CEO of since bankrupt Webvan, is shown outside the company's 330,000 square foot Oakland distribution center next to a company van and totes which hold the groceries in June 2000. (Photo: Martin E. Klimek for USA TODAY) \nDelivery of groceries ordered online began to gather steam again a few years later. Large supermarket chains such as Safeway and Vons began offering online shopping with delivery. Companies like Fresh Direct, InstaCart and Amazon Fresh, as well variants tied to local stores, began to offer the convenience of ordering online and having the items delivered within a given window of time. \nWhile the services offer ease and convenience, they also come with drawbacks, which could account for the fact that just 2.4% of total U.S. grocery sales in 2015 were online, according to Internet Retailer. \nFinding a window to have the items delivered is often difficult in today’s over-scheduled world. Orders don’t always come exactly as they were placed. Sometimes items are unavailable, but online ordering makes the kind of on-the-fly substitution possible standing in the grocery aisle impossible. Finally, U.S. consumers remain somewhat leery of having someone else pick out their fruit, vegetables and meat. Self-scanning \nIn Europe, Diebold Nixdorf, which makes cash registers, has launched a TPiSHOP app. This allows shoppers to avoid checkout lines by scanning each item they want to buy with their phone or with a hand-held scanner they carry with them as they walk through a store. The system is currently only is available in Europe, said Dave Kuchenski, director of design and new technology incubation, but the company hopes to introduce it into the United States. \nBut it’s not something all shopper readily embrace, said Stu Lipoff, a fellow with the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers and a partner with the consulting firm IP Action Partners. \n“There’s something really artificial and uncomfortable of picking up a scanner and carrying it around when you’re in a store,” he said. Dash away \nIn an effort to make ordering groceries online effortless, Amazon in 2015 launched the Dash button. These small lozenge-shaped devices have their own WiFi and come branded with different grocery items such as Tide detergent or Huggies diapers. Customers stick them to their washing machine or inside a cupboard, then click the button to reorder when they notice they’re running low on something. The Dash is synced to a user's Amazon account. The buttons are now available preset for more than 100 items. However it's unclear how whether consumers are really embracing the idea. Slice Intelligence said in March that only half the people who've bought one have actually used it. \nAn Amazon Dash button that orders a specific product at the touch of a button. (Photo: Amazon) Smart appliances \nSmart appliances are the coming trend, but the actual follow-through is still being worked out. \nThe new Groceries by MasterCard app will enable consumers to shop for and buy groceries directly from the Samsung Family Hub & Refrigerator. (Photo: Andrew Estey/AP Images for MasterCard) \nSamsung has focused heavily on this, with a line of refrigerators with built-in touch-screens that can keep track of food in the fridge and provide recipes that match the inventory. The Family Hub refrigerator , announced at CES in 2016, comes with a smart screen that is pre-loaded with a MasterCard grocery purchase and delivery app. It integrated with grocery partners FreshDirect, ShopRite and MyWebGrocer. The refrigerator also works with Amazon’s Alexa voice-control platform, allowing consumers to speak their grocery list and have it automatically ordered. \nAn Internet-connected fridge is not the same thing as a smart phone. Customers who bought early Samsung smart refrigerators reported running into trouble when Google changed how its Calendar program, which appears on the Family Hub screen. There was no way for customers to upgrade their refrigerator to accommodate the new program upgrade, leaving them with a fridge with a useless screen. Mobile payments \nIt’s been a few years since consumers have had the ability to turn the smartphones in their pockets or even the watches on their wrist into mobile wallets capable of paying for stuff at retail (and online), most notably through the likes of Apple Pay, Samsung Pay and Android Pay. \nn this photo taken Friday, Oct. 17, 2014, Eddy Cue, Apple Senior Vice President of Internet Software and Services, demonstrates the new Apple Pay mobile payment system at a Whole Foods store in Cupertino, Calif. (Photo: AP Photo/Eric Risberg,) \nThe regular use of mobile payments remains flat at 19%, according to a recent consumer survey by Accenture. \nSignificant hurdles remain across the entire mobile payments industry. Only relatively new smartphones are compatible with the various mobile payments methods, and some consumers are still concerned about security, though most mobile payment approaches are in fact more secure than handing a credit card to a clerk. Dreaming of Drones \nAside from Star Trek-style replicators —which even Amazon hasn’t worked out yet — the Holy Grail of all online delivery right now is drones. Deutsche Bank estimates drones could deliver for half of what trains, planes or automobiles cost. But while Amazon’s got a full drone lab up and running outside of Cambridge, England, so far no one’s quite got the mechanics and the regulatory issues worked out. \nUntil then, the only one who can provide that kind of speedy, pin-point service is, you guessed it, Santa Claus. \n(Photo: Gary Varvel, The Indianapolis Star) CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE ",

      "text": "1 For when you've got to get off on the D.L. but are also broke from those plane tickets.\nAmazon At three vibration settings, four pulse settings, a flexible base for internal access, and a brusher design to stimulate your breasts, vulva, and clitoris, you might think this affordable godsend of a toy would sound like a 7 a.m. NYC construction team. But thankfully, it's described as “silent but powerful,” which means you can have a beautiful variety of orgasms without your parents ever hearing a peep.\nUtumi Silicone 7-Frequency Vibrator, $18.99, Amazon.com\n2 For when bae couldn't come home with you\nBabeland This best-selling couple’s toy already has pretty much everything going for it: it’s pliable, hands-free, waterproof, rechargeable, and has plenty of quieter settings to choose from. But for when you can't physically be near each other, it comes with an app that can be controlled from anywhere, which means Skype sessions just improved tenfold.\nWe-Vibe Sync, $199, Babeland.com\n3 For when you need extra-quick quickies because your family's holiday schedule is nonstop.\nToo Timid This teeny-tiny bullet packs one hell of a pulsating punch and even heats up for sensation play, all while remarkably blending into the background noise of your home. So if you find yourself insatiably thirsty before family hot cocoa time, you can absolutely squeeze in a speedy orgasm.\nHeated Whisper Bullet, $14.95, Tootimid.com\n 4 For when you want to show off how hot your sex life with bae is, but, you know, sneakily.\nBabeland This hush-hush vibrator disguised as a mere minimalist necklace is as inconspicuous as they come, and you’ll get the added satisfaction of your aunt complimenting your partner’s exquisite taste in gift jewelry. It's essentially Joan from Mad Men 's pen necklace with incredible perks, so naturally, you have to have it.\nCrave Vesper, $69 (Silver) or $149 (24k Gold). Babeland.com\n5 For when you're Charlotte York in the sheets *AND* at your future-mother-in-law's dinner table.\nSimplii Pleasure The Rabbit is arguably the MVP of sex toys, and if it’s a staple of your sex life, then in your luggage it must go. This version is sleek enough to possibly convince your grandpa it’s just a bunny-climbing-a-very-large-carrot sculpture, and has a lock feature to prevent unintended start-ups at the airport terminal. And if the vibration's still sound too loud for your liking, it still works wonders as a regular dildo.\nJopen Vanity Rabbit Vibrator, $163.80, Simpliipleasure.com\n6 For when you want body-shaking orgasms but are also too lazy to take off your sweater.\nSimplii Pleasure This is ideal for when you’re both full from dinner, but earlier saw your man chop a log for the first time and have been secretly pining for his wood ever since. Just slide it onto his penis and set it to \"pressure-activated\" mode for when you're sure you heard your parents go downstairs.\nJimmyjane Iconic Ring, $20, Simpliipleasure.com\n 7 For when you want all the frills but your grandma has remarkably wolf-life hearing.\nSimplii Pleasure Maybe make sure you don’t bring it in its original box with “ASS-BERRIES” on the front (because somehow, by the law of nature, your mom will accidentally find it), but this butt plug is the perfect accessory to bring home for the holidays when you want a little anal play but still can’t listen to Prince with your parents. And for an extra buzz for when Mom and Dad go to pick up the groceries, you can turn on the vibrating feature and have yourself a really merry Christmas.\nRocks Off Ass-Berries Vibrating Butt Plug, $39.99, Simpliipleasure.com\n8 For when you want clitoral stimulation but also a massage because being cooped up with your family is WORK.\nSimplii Pleasure Vibrators are great, quiet vibrators are even better, but quiet pocket vibrators that can also be used as back massagers after snowstorm-related flight delays are all that is right with the world. Your parents who saw you at your groggiest will not believe how glowy you’ll look at family game night 20 minutes later.\nThe Tripod Mini Massager, $29.99, Simpliipleasure.com\n9 For when you want to make the most of your parents' marble-accented bathroom.\nSimplii Pleasure If you feel daring enough to sneak in some dual shower time in the early hours of the morning, you might as well bring along this travel-size, waterproof massager, which will partially be drowned out by shower sounds anyway Alternatively, if your mom has the sleep cycle of a dolphin and can be found in the hallway every 20 minutes, you can always just take this in with you alone and fantasize what could have been.\nWater Dancer Pocket Massager, $28.99, Simpliipleasure.com\n 10 For when you want that magic touch but your cousins practically live in the hallway.\nBabeland This device may look slightly like the lie detector from Meet the Parents , but the gentle vibrations do wonders for hand jobs as much as they do clitoral stimulation, so you can let it snow all night long.\nJimmyjane Hello Touch X, $145, Babeland\n11 For when you can't say the word \"sex\" in your house but you're also kinky.\nAmazon If your dad is in the garage electric-sawing the bottom of the Christmas tree off and you’re still worried he might hear your boyfriend’s stifled moan, just turn out the lights, cast your roll, take on whatever sex position you land on, and go at it without ever breathing a PG-13 syllable.\nHezong Glow In The Dark Sex Dice, $4.87, Amazon.com\nAdvertisement ",

      "text": "Order Reprint of this Story \nOne of the great things about writing this column is learning about the myriad ways businesses give back to the community, particularly at this time of year. \nMany local shops, from Security Public Storage in Ceres to Modesto Toyota , are drop-off points for the Toys for Tots , Turlock Together and other programs. Vintage Faire Mall hosts a gift-wrapping station from which proceeds benefit Camp Taylor . And as I wrote earlier, Raley’s is hosting a food drive for local needy families. \nOn Tuesday, internet retail giant Amazon made a contribution in a big way, bringing its 53-foot truck-and-trailer (nicknamed “Santa’s Sleigh” for the occasion) to the Center for Human Services . According to spokeswoman Caitlin Scott, Amazon is touring the United States, delivering goods ranging from hula hoops to diapers to nonprofit organizations along the way. \nPete Mitchell, general manager of the Amazon distribution center in Patterson, said the retailer chose the Center for Human Services because of the good work it does in the communities it serves. Programs include shelter for young people aging out of the foster care program, resources for parents, substance abuse help and job training. \nCenter for Human Services spokeswoman Kate Trompetter said the donation came as a welcome surprise. The organization gathered roughly 60 families for Tuesday’s event. \n“We have people from all of our programs, and some staff families,” Trompetter said. \nAfter remarks from Mitchell and Center for Human Services executive director Cindy Duenas, the Amazon elves – they were dressed that way, in green shirts and hats – began the work of unloading the “sleigh.” They were joined by an authentic-looking Santa Claus, who sat for photos with the children after they picked out a toy. \nFernanda Duenas, 7, chose a spelling game. Jumping up and down, she said she was very excited for Christmas. She also took the opportunity to ask Santa for a My Little Pony for Christmas. \nFor Amazon employees, of course, this is crunch time – according to Fortune , the retail giant alone was responsible for 30 percent of all Cyber Monday spending, bringing in $12 billion in sales. \n“It’s the busiest time of the year,” Mitchell said. “But it’s the best time.”",

Stand on the ''Naughty or Nice O'Meter.'' Snap a selfie and see your face on a dancing elf. By: Associated Press | New York | Published: December 7, 2016 2:58 AM About 40 malls in the U.S. and one in London have the high-tech Santa displays, most of them located near major cities that tend to house pricier stores. (Reuters) \nHop on a virtual sleigh ride to the North Pole. Stand on the ”Naughty or Nice O’Meter.” Snap a selfie and see your face on a dancing elf. The Santa experience has gotten a makeover as many malls install shows and games they hope will lure shoppers who are buying more online. About 40 malls in the U.S. and one in London have the high-tech Santa displays, most of them located near major cities that tend to house pricier stores. Taking photos on Santa’s lap costs about $30 and up, around the same as at other malls, but most of the malls say people can walk through without purchasing anything. ”It was a half-hour of entertainment that was free,” says Katie Mass, who took her twin daughters through Santa’s Flight Academy, a 3,000-square-foot setup at The Mall at Short Hills in New Jersey. She had gone to the mall to return some dresses, but had to stop when her 2-year olds saw the spectacle. ”They started running,” says the stay-at-home mom from Westfield, New Jersey. The girls tapped touch screens, pulled levers and watched as flight suits were virtually fit over their bodies on a screen. The final stop was a two-story tall enclosed sleigh that dropped fake snow upon them. One girl made snow angels on the floor while her sister danced under the colorful lasers. ”It was extravagant and well done,” says Mass. Malls are hoping the over-the-top Santa visits remind people what brick-and-mortar stores can offer. They’re increasingly trying to offer special experiences as they compete with online rivals, says Howard Davidowitz, chairman of New York-based retail consulting group Davidowitz & Associates. ”The parents love it, the kids love it and Amazon can’t do it,” says Davidowitz. Santa’s Flight Academy was developed by mall operator Taubman Centers Inc., which spent two years on the idea. After testing it last year at The Mall of San Juan in Puerto Rico, the company rolled it out to 11 other Taubman malls this year, replacing a low-tech ice palace that had housed Santa for years. Like other malls with elaborate Santa sets, Taubman declined to say how much it spent on Santa’s Flight Academy. Guy Perry, a manager of a Disney Store at Taubman’s Westfarms mall in West Hartford, Connecticut, credited this year’s ”great” store traffic to Santa’s Flight Academy. Kids come into the store and tell him how they helped Santa take flight. ”It is getting a lot of good reviews,” says Perry. An old-school Santa display got the boot at Queens Center in New York as the mall this year installed Santa HQ, a set sponsored by cable TV channel HGTV. As kids stand on the ”Naughty or Nice O’Meter,” they can watch their names pop up on Santa’s ”Nice List” screen. In another room they can take a selfie and see themselves as dancing elves. In the last room, they’re handed tablets that use augmented reality technology to make it appear as if cartoon elves are popping out of the walls and packing gifts. The entire set and trees put on a light show every 20 minutes that is synchronized with holiday music. Quite a difference from last year’s Santa setup: A couch and some Christmas trees. ”It’s Santa-meets-21st-century-technology,” says John Scaturro, a marketing manager for the mall. Queens Center’s owner, Macerich Co., first installed Santa HQ at some malls two years ago. This year, that expanded to 15 malls from 10. As of November, sales of photos with Santa at Queens Center nearly tripled from last year, says Scaturro. In addition to bringing in shoppers, the set is an advertisement for HGTV. Screens air the network’s home improvement and real estate programs. Stars of its shows were set to sign autographs and take photos at two Macerich malls. It’s cartoon characters that share the spotlight with Santa at another mall display, the DreamWorks DreamPlace. The set, created by DreamWorks Animation, stars characters from the movie studio’s ”Kung Fu Panda” films – replacing the green ogre from the ”Shrek” movies that were last year’s focus. Thirteen malls are using the set, which uses rumbling seats, wind and mist to create a virtual ride on Santa’s sleigh. Whatever malls are spending on the Santa spectacles is worth it, says Davidowitz. Santa has always attracted crowds, he says, but adding a high-tech twist is likely to bring in even more who may stop to shop. ”I don’t see many things out there that equal Santa’s power to draw crowds,” he says.

By: FE Bureau | New Delhi | Published: December 6, 2016 6:35 AM \nAmazon .in, the Indian arm of global e-commerce giant Amazon.com on Monday launched Amazon Launchpad in India to help Indian start-up gain access to global markets. Amazon lends its delivery and advertising services to these start-ups and features their products on a dedicated store under the programme. Amazon charges R5,000 per merchants per month for the services. \n“We hope that Amazon Launchpad has a positive impact on the economy further promoting Make in India , adding further impetus to the current interest in Indian start-ups and also creating additional employment opportunities,” said Amit Agarwal, vice president and country head of Amazon India. \nThe Amazon Launchpad stores features over 400 products across categories such as health & wellness, food, gadgets, and smart homes, among others. Prior to the official launch, 25 companies are already a part of Amazon Launchpad and Amazon.in helps the company in terms of targetted marketing, infrastructure and delivery management, and brand development. Amazon Launchpad is also connected with over 100 venture capital funds and incubators to aid fund raising and nurture these start-ups. \nIn India, Amazon Launchpad has partnered with government’s Start-up India programme, NASSCOM’s 1000 Start-ups and Indian Angel Network to identify and include these start-ups under their portfolio. Amazon.in has also entered into strategic partnership with NITI Aayog, Maharashtra government, Telengana government and TiE. \nRamesh Abhishek, secretary of DIPP said that since January it has been able to accomplish a lot from what was mentioned under Prime Ministers 19-point action plan for start-ups but has recognised that a lot is yet to be done. He added that Amazon Launchpad is an excellent opportuntiy for start-ups to gain global reach. Please Wait while comments are loading... Trending Now ",

      "title": "New Amazon Build Services",
      "text": "  Wednesday, 07 December 2016 \nAmazon's flood of announcements at Re:Invent included managed build services, and new ways to build and debug complex distributed applications. \nAmazon used the conference to announce AWS CodeBuild, a managed build service designed to be elastic, scalable, and easy to use. To use it, you create a build project that contains the information needed to perform a build. This includes the following elements: Source Repository – Source code location (AWS CodeCommit repository, GitHub repository, or S3 bucket). Build Environment – Language / runtime environment (Android, Java, Python, Ruby, Go, Node.js, or Docker). IAM Role – Grants CodeBuild permission to access to specific AWS services and resources. Build Spec – Series of build commands, in YAML form. Compute Type – Amount of memory and compute power required (up to 15 GB of memory and 8 vCPUs). \n\nA new way to create complex distributed applications was also unveiled at Re:Invent. AWS Step Functions provide a way to coordinate multiple serverless function calls, letting you connect multiple web and microservices. AWS Step Functions let you coordinate the components of your application as series of steps in a visual workflow. You create state machines in the Step Functions Console to specify and execute the steps of your application at scale. \n\nEach state machine defines a set of states and the transitions between them. States can be activated sequentially or in parallel, and Step Functions will make sure that all parallel states run to completion before moving forward. \nYet another really useful sounding   AWS X-Ray. This gives you a way to trace data from code as execution moves between EC2 instances, ECS containers, microservices, AWS database and messaging services. \n\nAWS X-Ray gives you \"follow-the-thread\" tracing by adding an HTTP header to requests that do not already have one. That header is then passed to the request handlers the code and data encounter in their route through the services. The data collected at each point is stored in JSON format, and includes request and response timing. This is then used to create service graphs that show the relationship of services to each other, so you can trace requests from beginning to end and work out where the problems lie.",

      "text": "Skip in Skip x Embed\nx Share\nShoppers can literally grab and go without paying for their goods at a cash register at Amazon's new smart grocery store in Seattle. USA TODAY\nMany retailers and tech companies have tried, and failed, to make grocery shopping less dire. (Photo: Getty Images)\nSAN FRANCISCO — In Amazon Go's world , shoppers walk into a supermarket, grab an item, and walk out. No scanning. No card swiping.\nSounds fantastic. But will it work?\nRetailers and tech companies have long tried to fix what we hate most about grocery shopping — time wasted in long lines, tedious barcode scanning and waiting around for receipts. They’ve tried everything from self-checkouts to home delivery, to mobile pay and even fridges that order for you.\nUSA TODAY\nAmazon just opened a grocery store without a checkout line\nFor all the hope and fanfare these solutions heralded, grocery shopping has yet to hit the express lane.\nSome fixes have worked (kind of) and some have been massive fails. Here's a list of the six that have been part of the grocery checkout mix for the past decade or so.\nSelf-checkout Shirley Cook of Philadelphia buys four packages of mini-blinds at the self service check out at a Home Depot store in Philadelphia, PA on April 15, 2004. (Photo: Eileen Blass/USA TODAY)\nThis was supposed to be the killer application that made grocery shopping easy. Sadly, it didn't quite happen that way. Too often shoppers ran into problems scanning or otherwise getting the systems to work. While the lanes still remain in many stores, others are beginning to pull them out. The parent company of Albertsons, Vons and Pavilions said last month it is taking self-checkout lanes from 96 stores of 352 it has in southern California, according to the Orange County Register . As of 2016, 41% of shoppers in North America have used them, according to Nielsen.\nDelivery rebound Once upon a time, all grocery stores delivered. You called down in the morning, put in your order and later that afternoon the delivery boy would come by with food to make dinner. The rise of supermarkets and car ownership ended that for the most part. But the concept has come back several times, though not always successfully.\nIn the dot-com bubble of the late 1990s, Webvan was the poster child for online grocery delivery. It offered grocery delivery in ten U.S. markets, launching in 1996 and going bankrupt in 2001 after losing millions of dollars. Other dot-com grocery delivery businesses that launched at the time included Peapod, HomeGrocer.com and Kozmo.com. Only Peapod remains, though much diminished from its heyday.\nGeorge Shaheen, CEO of since bankrupt Webvan, is shown outside the company's 330,000 square foot Oakland distribution center next to a company van and totes which hold the groceries in June 2000. (Photo: Martin E. Klimek for USA TODAY)\nDelivery of groceries ordered online began to gather steam again a few years later. Large supermarket chains such as Safeway and Vons began offering online shopping with delivery. Companies like Fresh Direct, InstaCart and Amazon Fresh, as well variants tied to local stores, began to offer the convenience of ordering online and having the items delivered within a given window of time.\nWhile the services offer ease and convenience, they also come with drawbacks, which could account for the fact that just 2.4% of total U.S. grocery sales in 2015 were online, according to Internet Retailer.\nFinding a window to have the items delivered is often difficult in today’s over-scheduled world. Orders don’t always come exactly as they were placed. Sometimes items are unavailable, but online ordering makes the kind of on-the-fly substitution possible standing in the grocery aisle impossible. Finally, U.S. consumers remain somewhat leery of having someone else pick out their fruit, vegetables and meat.\nSelf-scanning In Europe, Diebold Nixdorf, which makes cash registers, has launched a TPiSHOP app. This allows shoppers to avoid checkout lines by scanning each item they want to buy with their phone or with a hand-held scanner they carry with them as they walk through a store. The system is currently only is available in Europe, said Dave Kuchenski, director of design and new technology incubation, but the company hopes to introduce it into the United States.\nBut it’s not something all shopper readily embrace, said Stu Lipoff, a fellow with the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers and a partner with the consulting firm IP Action Partners.\n“There’s something really artificial and uncomfortable of picking up a scanner and carrying it around when you’re in a store,” he said.\nDash away In an effort to make ordering groceries online effortless, Amazon in 2015 launched the Dash button. These small lozenge-shaped devices have their own WiFi and come branded with different grocery items such as Tide detergent or Huggies diapers. Customers stick them to their washing machine or inside a cupboard, then click the button to reorder when they notice they’re running low on something. The Dash is synced to a user's Amazon account. The buttons are now available preset for more than 100 items. However it's unclear how whether consumers are really embracing the idea. Slice Intelligence said in March that only half the people who've bought one have actually used it.\nAn Amazon Dash button that orders a specific product at the touch of a button. (Photo: Amazon)\nSmart appliances Smart appliances are the coming trend, but the actual follow-through is still being worked out.\nThe new Groceries by MasterCard app will enable consumers to shop for and buy groceries directly from the Samsung Family Hub & Refrigerator. (Photo: Andrew Estey/AP Images for MasterCard)\nSamsung has focused heavily on this, with a line of refrigerators with built-in touch-screens that can keep track of food in the fridge and provide recipes that match the inventory. The Family Hub refrigerator , announced at CES in 2016, comes with a smart screen that is pre-loaded with a MasterCard grocery purchase and delivery app. It integrated with grocery partners FreshDirect, ShopRite and MyWebGrocer. The refrigerator also works with Amazon’s Alexa voice-control platform, allowing consumers to speak their grocery list and have it automatically ordered.\nAn Internet-connected fridge is not the same thing as a smart phone. Customers who bought early Samsung smart refrigerators reported running into trouble when Google changed how its Calendar program, which appears on the Family Hub screen. There was no way for customers to upgrade their refrigerator to accommodate the new program upgrade, leaving them with a fridge with a useless screen.\nMobile payments It’s been a few years since consumers have had the ability to turn the smartphones in their pockets or even the watches on their wrist into mobile wallets capable of paying for stuff at retail (and online), most notably through the likes of Apple Pay, Samsung Pay and Android Pay.\nn this photo taken Friday, Oct. 17, 2014, Eddy Cue, Apple Senior Vice President of Internet Software and Services, demonstrates the new Apple Pay mobile payment system at a Whole Foods store in Cupertino, Calif. (Photo: AP Photo/Eric Risberg,)\nThe regular use of mobile payments remains flat at 19%, according to a recent consumer survey by Accenture.\nSignificant hurdles remain across the entire mobile payments industry. Only relatively new smartphones are compatible with the various mobile payments methods, and some consumers are still concerned about security, though most mobile payment approaches are in fact more secure than handing a credit card to a clerk.\nDreaming of Drones Aside from Star Trek-style replicators —which even Amazon hasn’t worked out yet — the Holy Grail of all online delivery right now is drones. Deutsche Bank estimates drones could deliver for half of what trains, planes or automobiles cost. But while Amazon’s got a full drone lab up and running outside of Cambridge, England, so far no one’s quite got the mechanics and the regulatory issues worked out.\nUntil then, the only one who can provide that kind of speedy, pin-point service is, you guessed it, Santa Claus.\n (Photo: Gary Varvel, The Indianapolis Star)\n12334 CONNECT TWEET 14 LINKEDIN 22 COMMENT EMAIL MORE //usat.ly/2gQ7sOp",

      "text": "Music (Shutterstock photo)\nThink about the last time you actually bought a DVD or a Blu-Ray. Chances are, those purchases are in decline, if you haven't already stopped buying them altogether. For example, you can stream movies on Netflix ( NFLX ), Prime Instant Video, or HBO Go. If you wanted to buy/rent a specific movie, you can download it from Amazon, iTunes, or Google Play.\nBuying and owning CDs and most other physical kinds of music (with the exception of records, which have been making a comeback in niche groups) are the also way of the past and streaming is the way of the future. Technology has changed the way we listen to music. For Apple ( AAPL ), Amazon ( AMZN ), and Spotify, it's become a big business and it's poised to get even bigger.\nApple Music announced on Tuesday it surpassed 20 million paying subscribers, up 15% over the past months. That's a huge increase for such a short period of time, and shows that Apple's latest efforts are working, including providing exclusive content from artists such as Frank Ocean and redesigning its interface, making it easier to use.\nAs part of Apple's Services business, Apple Music is helping the company diversify its revenue streams away from being hardware-centric. It's the fastest-growing part of Apple's business, growing 24% year over year to $6.3 billion in the most recent quarter .\nMeanwhile, Spotify now has over 40 million subscribers, and is working its way towards going public next year, based solely off a streaming business. While we don't have the exact figures yet on just how profitable and healthy the company is, it's a good bet the company wouldn't be thinking about going public if it didn't believe in the future of streaming.\nFor Amazon, it's another hook to keep people spending $99 a year on Prime. There are an estimated 50 million Prime users, and they spend roughly three to four times more shopping on Amazon than non-Prime users do, so it's important that Amazon continue to invest in building out Prime. Amazon also recently launched Amazon Music Unlimited as a separate service outside of Prime, showing just how important streaming music is not just as a business, but as a medium.\nThere's still a huge opportunity for these companies, as the combined 100 million or so subscribers of various music streaming services is just a small fraction of people listening to music around the world. With that, it's a big opportunity for investors as well, particularly for those who are looking for tech companies to deliver strong revenue growth. A service like streaming music might just do that for those companies.\nIt's easier now than ever to listen to your favorite songs and artists on a number of devices, from your phone to your smart TV to your smart speakers, and these companies hope to profit off that experience.\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.",

      "text": "Home / News / Software News / Amazon's new Music Unlimited plan might just make you switch from Spotify Amazon's new Music Unlimited plan might just make you switch from Spotify \nby Joe Roberts Read Comments \nAmazon recently launched its Apple Music and Spotify rival in the form of Music Unlimited, bringing a catalogue of 40 million tracks to compete with the big boys. \nAnd while the millions of songs and Amazon Echo integration made the service an attractive offering, it launched without that all-important family plan option. \nBut now, Amazon has launched a new Family plan that allows up to six users to stream music for just £14.99 per month for both Prime and non-Prime members, or £149 per year for Prime members. \nRelated: Amazon Echo review \nThe new plan is now live in the UK, and comes at the same price as Apple Music and Spotify's family option. \nEach family member you sign up will be able to stream as much music as they want at any time, and will get personalised recommendations. \nThe Amazon Echo \nAmazon's music service went live in the UK in November, following its US launch in October. Prime members can sign up for £7.99 per month, or £79 a year, while non-Prime members will pay £9.99 per month. \nHowever, if you're an owner of the Amazon Echo smart speaker, or its smaller cousin – the Dot – you can get a massive discount on the new service, which drops to £3.99 per month for Echo owners. \nRelated: CES 2017 \nSigning up for the Echo discount does mean you'll only be able to play music on that device, however, but it's a decent saving regardless. \nThe company also added extra functionality to its smart speakers to tempt users to sign up through those devices. \nNew features include the ability to ask the virtual assistant Alexa to play specific songs based on lyrics or the most recent song from a particular artist. \nWATCH: Amazon Echo review \nLet us know if you sign up for the Family plan in the comments. 0 shares",

      "text": "Subscribe to TechRepublic's Cloud Insights newsletter \nSnowball Edge is a new take on HCI. Snowball Edge is deployable in a 3-node cluster and provides a platform with 100TB of space. Edge offers some data resiliency features over the previous Snowball. By creating a cluster, AWS provides a higher level of data protection. Similar to other HCI solutions, the cluster is elastic. Nodes are added and removed to add and remove capacity. Jassy indicated the removal of nodes is the method by which data is shipped back to AWS for ingestion into a customer's VPC. \nSimilar to other HCI solutions, data storage isn't the only capability of Snowball Edge. AWS has never focused on replicating traditional enterprise IT services. As such, Snowball Edge isn't designed to run massive numbers of virtual machines. AWS seems focused on extending just enough processing functionality to customer facilities. Each node has 100TB of storage and the compute capacity of an EC2 m4.4xlarge instance. An m4.4xlarge instance includes 16 vCPU and 64GB of RAM. \nSnowball Edge supports running Lambda functions on the cluster. In the IoT use case, customers write Lambda functions that run on the Snowball cluster. An example function examines data as it's ingested to S3-based storage on the cluster. The functions identify exceptions and may send a notification to a human or kickoff a remediation workflow. Individual nodes are removed and shipped back to AWS for ingestion into the permanent S3 storage in an AWS data center. \nThe solution isn't designed to replace products such as Nutanix or VMware vSAN directly. The initial capability is limited to a single Lambda call for each S3-Put event. AWS is removing the barriers to the public cloud for industries with physical constraints that formerly prevented public cloud adoption. However, I'm watching what new disruption results as industries with a high barrier to entry due to technology limitations are challenged by adept startups using edge cloud computing.

      "text": "SAN FRANCISCO — In Amazon Go's world , shoppers walk into a supermarket, grab an item, and walk out. No scanning. No card swiping.\nSounds fantastic. But will it work?\nRetailers and tech companies have long tried to fix what we hate most about grocery shopping — time wasted in long lines, tedious barcode scanning and waiting around for receipts. They’ve tried everything from self-checkouts to home delivery, to mobile pay and even fridges that order for you.\nUSA TODAY\nAmazon just opened a grocery store without a checkout line\nFor all the hope and fanfare these solutions heralded, grocery shopping has yet to hit the express lane.\nSome fixes have worked (kind of) and some have been massive fails. Here's a list of the six that have been part of the grocery checkout mix for the past decade or so.\nSelf-checkout Shirley Cook of Philadelphia buys four packages of mini-blinds at the self service check out at a Home Depot store in Philadelphia, PA on April 15, 2004. (Photo: Eileen Blass/USA TODAY)\nThis was supposed to be the killer application that made grocery shopping easy. Sadly, it didn't quite happen that way. Too often shoppers ran into problems scanning or otherwise getting the systems to work. While the lanes still remain in many stores, others are beginning to pull them out. The parent company of Albertsons, Vons and Pavilions said last month it is taking self-checkout lanes from 96 stores of 352 it has in southern California, according to the Orange County Register . As of 2016, 41% of shoppers in North America have used them, according to Nielsen.\nDelivery rebound Once upon a time, all grocery stores delivered. You called down in the morning, put in your order and later that afternoon the delivery boy would come by with food to make dinner. The rise of supermarkets and car ownership ended that for the most part. But the concept has come back several times, though not always successfully.\nIn the dot-com bubble of the late 1990s, Webvan was the poster child for online grocery delivery. It offered grocery delivery in ten U.S. markets, launching in 1996 and going bankrupt in 2001 after losing millions of dollars. Other dot-com grocery delivery businesses that launched at the time included Peapod, HomeGrocer.com and Kozmo.com. Only Peapod remains, though much diminished from its heyday.\nGeorge Shaheen, CEO of since bankrupt Webvan, is shown outside the company's 330,000 square foot Oakland distribution center next to a company van and totes which hold the groceries in June 2000. (Photo: Martin E. Klimek for USA TODAY)\nDelivery of groceries ordered online began to gather steam again a few years later. Large supermarket chains such as Safeway and Vons began offering online shopping with delivery. Companies like Fresh Direct, InstaCart and Amazon Fresh, as well variants tied to local stores, began to offer the convenience of ordering online and having the items delivered within a given window of time.\nWhile the services offer ease and convenience, they also come with drawbacks, which could account for the fact that just 2.4% of total U.S. grocery sales in 2015 were online, according to Internet Retailer.\nFinding a window to have the items delivered is often difficult in today’s over-scheduled world. Orders don’t always come exactly as they were placed. Sometimes items are unavailable, but online ordering makes the kind of on-the-fly substitution possible standing in the grocery aisle impossible. Finally, U.S. consumers remain somewhat leery of having someone else pick out their fruit, vegetables and meat.\nSelf-scanning In Europe, Diebold Nixdorf, which makes cash registers, has launched a TPiSHOP app. This allows shoppers to avoid checkout lines by scanning each item they want to buy with their phone or with a hand-held scanner they carry with them as they walk through a store. The system is currently only is available in Europe, said Dave Kuchenski, director of design and new technology incubation, but the company hopes to introduce it into the United States.\nBut it’s not something all shopper readily embrace, said Stu Lipoff, a fellow with the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers and a partner with the consulting firm IP Action Partners.\n“There’s something really artificial and uncomfortable of picking up a scanner and carrying it around when you’re in a store,” he said.\nDash away In an effort to make ordering groceries online effortless, Amazon in 2015 launched the Dash button. These small lozenge-shaped devices have their own WiFi and come branded with different grocery items such as Tide detergent or Huggies diapers. Customers stick them to their washing machine or inside a cupboard, then click the button to reorder when they notice they’re running low on something. The Dash is synced to a user's Amazon account. The buttons are now available preset for more than 100 items. However it's unclear how whether consumers are really embracing the idea. Slice Intelligence said in March that only half the people who've bought one have actually used it.\nAn Amazon Dash button that orders a specific product at the touch of a button.

(Photo: Andrew Estey/AP Images for MasterCard)\nSamsung has focused heavily on this, with a line of refrigerators with built-in touch-screens that can keep track of food in the fridge and provide recipes that match the inventory. The Family Hub refrigerator , announced at CES in 2016, comes with a smart screen that is pre-loaded with a MasterCard grocery purchase and delivery app. It integrated with grocery partners FreshDirect, ShopRite and MyWebGrocer. The refrigerator also works with Amazon’s Alexa voice-control platform, allowing consumers to speak their grocery list and have it automatically ordered.\nAn Internet-connected fridge is not the same thing as a smart phone. Customers who bought early Samsung smart refrigerators reported running into trouble when Google changed how its Calendar program, which appears on the Family Hub screen. There was no way for customers to upgrade their refrigerator to accommodate the new program upgrade, leaving them with a fridge with a useless screen.\nMobile payments It’s been a few years since consumers have had the ability to turn the smartphones in their pockets or even the watches on their wrist into mobile wallets capable of paying for stuff at retail (and online), most notably through the likes of Apple Pay, Samsung Pay and Android Pay.\nn this photo taken Friday, Oct. 17, 2014, Eddy Cue, Apple Senior Vice President of Internet Software and Services, demonstrates the new Apple Pay mobile payment system at a Whole Foods store in Cupertino, Calif. (Photo: AP Photo/Eric Risberg,)\nThe regular use of mobile payments remains flat at 19%, according to a recent consumer survey by Accenture.\nSignificant hurdles remain across the entire mobile payments industry. Only relatively new smartphones are compatible with the various mobile payments methods, and some consumers are still concerned about security, though most mobile payment approaches are in fact more secure than handing a credit card to a clerk.\nDreaming of Drones Aside from Star Trek-style replicators —which even Amazon hasn’t worked out yet — the Holy Grail of all online delivery right now is drones. Deutsche Bank estimates drones could deliver for half of what trains, planes or automobiles cost. But while Amazon’s got a full drone lab up and running outside of Cambridge, England, so far no one’s quite got the mechanics and the regulatory issues worked out.\nUntil then, the only one who can provide that kind of speedy, pin-point service is, you guessed it, Santa Claus.\n (Photo: Gary Varvel, The Indianapolis Star)",

      "text": "1 -- While European river cruising has certainly had its fair share of public relations challenges this year, marketing the Amazon River in 2016 has been no cakewalk either. First there was the outbreak of the mosquito-borne Zika virus, which took the media by storm in late 2015 and early 2016, and then The New York Times last month published an extensive expo about the issue of pirates along the Brazilian Amazon, resurfacing another image challenge the region faces.And yet, despite it all, bookings for river cruises along the Amazon remain strong, according to the majority of operators with inventory there.\"Overall, we did receive a lot of questions regarding cruise safety and Zika, but it did not affect our bookings or interest in the Amazon as a travel destination,\" said Pats Illich, who oversees marketing for the Miami-based Rainforest Cruises, a company that sells river cruises on both the Peruvian and Brazilian Amazon.Tara Ellison, director of operations for International Expeditions, which has been operating on the Peruvian Amazon for some 40 years, said the company saw an uptick last month for its Amazon itineraries that corresponded with its Cyber Week promotion, and that prior to that it didn't appear that clients were overly concerned about Zika (as they are mostly not of childbearing age, noted Ellison) or about crime and safety.\"The Peruvian Amazon, especially the area where we travel near Iquitos, is incredibly welcoming to travelers,\" said Ellison, who was preparing for her 12th trip to the Peruvian Amazon this month. \"After pirate incidents farther afield and closer to home, Peruvian authorities have made security a top priority.\"Francesco Galli Zugaro, founder and CEO of Aqua Expeditions, said his company has seen a spike in bookings in the past two months, a phenomenon he attributed to the World Health Organization having declared last month that Zika is no longer a global health \"emergency\" - but that it remains a \"significant enduring public health challenge\" - and because the Peruvian Ministry of Health ended its Zika health emergency in October.Delfin Amazon Cruises also said that it has not seen a drop in bookings and that consumer satisfaction for its Peruvian Amazon cruises remains high. Delfin did get some calls of concern from travelers as a result of the recent Times article about pirates, \"however, it is important to note that the article only covers the area of Manaus in Brazil, an area within Brazilian territory, not in Peru, and thousands of miles away from where Delfin Amazon Cruises operates.\"In some ways, it's not too surprising that Amazon river cruise bookings remain strong despite any perceived health or safety threats. Amazon river cruisers are a hardy bunch. The world's largest jungle on its own evokes a level of exoticism and adventure that inevitably invites a more craggy traveler.And it's not as though Amazon operators have been resting on their laurels. Many have come out and proactively communicated with guests about any additional safety and security measures they have implemented on their vessels in light of concerns about piracy both on the Peruvian as well as the Brazilian stretch of the river, ranging from high-tech security systems to additional manpower onboard. And when it comes to health, Amazon operators had been in the habit of advising guests to take any necessary or recommended health precautions and vaccines long before Zika became an issue.Ultimately, they benefit not just from the built-in resolve of Amazon river cruisers, but also from the allure of the destination itself, the rich flora and fauna for which it is known and the unique communities that reside along the river's banks. For anyone who has been on an Amazon river cruise, it's not uncommon for the experience to quickly fall into the \"trip of a lifetime\" category. And for many, that means no amount of pirates or mosquitos are going to stop them from being able to cross the experience off their wish list. ",

      "text": "By Laura Hurley 21 minutes ago \nAmazon debuted a new period drama called Good Girls Revolt back on October 28, and critics responded well to the series for the quality of the content as well as the timeliness of the premise in the current political climate. Unfortunately for viewers who fell in love with the series during its first and only season, Amazon cancelled Good Girls Revolt only a month after its streaming premiere. Sony Pictures Television was behind production of the series, and the company isn't quite ready to give up on it. Sony is currently shopping Good Girls Revolt around to certain other platforms for a renewal. \nSony is mostly focusing its efforts to score a Good Girls Revolt renewal from cable networks. Freeform, USA Network, and Bravo are all in the running. The production company is also eyeing the major broadcast network ABC and streaming service Hulu. Netflix and Lifetime are reportedly possibilities, but not especially likely. The clock is ticking for one of these platforms to make the call as to whether or not there should be a future for Good Girls Revolt . \nThe deadline for a renewal is unofficially December 31, at which point the existing contracts for cast members will expire. Extensions on contract options for the actors are possible, but not especially likely given the holiday break that is looming. According to THR , Good Girls Revolt hasn't lost its place in the tax incentive program from the California Film Commission, so at least Sony doesn't have to worry about finances on that front. \nIt's hard to say which of the targeted platforms is the most likely to order a second season for Good Girls Revolt . Broadcast networks and streaming services alike have been known to pick up shows cancelled by other channels and/or sites. Hulu could be an ideal fit to keep the show on a streaming platform. Still, changes to how it releases its shows back in 2015 mean that a season probably would not be available to binge-watch all at once. Instead, episodes would likely be released on a weekly basis just as they would on broadcast TV. \nInterestingly, Freeform ( formerly ABC Family) is experimenting with releasing full seasons of new shows streaming all at once, simultaneously with airing live, so it could be a fitting home for Good Girls Revolt . ABC reaches far more people than would tune in on most of the other platforms. Good Girls Revolt would be pretty lucky to find a future there. It's no surprise that Netflix is considered a long shot, however; Amazon and Netflix are competitors in the streaming market, and they aren't particularly likely to make deals with each other. \nWe may never know the numbers that led to the show's cancellation on Amazon. Creator Dana Calvo has claimed that viewership and completion rates for Season 1 were excellent, but Amazon Studios TV bigwig Joe Lewis has said that the numbers she cited were not accurate and the series just wasn't delivering what Amazon was looking for in a drama series. \nOnly time will tell if fans of Good Girls Revolt will have the option of watching a Season 2 on another platform. News should break at some point before the December 31 cut-off. Check out our midseason TV premiere schedule to see what else you can watch in the near future.  ",

      "text": "13 Gifts For Dog Lovers Who Love Their Pet More Than Any Human Source: Amazon By Maria Cassano an hour ago \nI've made two very important life choices within the past month. Firstly, I've decided that I'm going to stick with the freelance writer thing and try to make a career out of it. Secondly, I've decided to stock up on things to get a dog lover , because if I'm going to be working from home in a basement for the rest of my life, you better believe I'm doing it alongside a corgi (or seven). \nGifts for dog lovers are easy enough to find; you can walk into any pet store or mall boutique and find a mug with your breed's face on it. Unique gifts for dog lovers are significantly harder to swing, and if you're shopping for your dog directly, you better make damn sure that it's the coolest thing in the world, because you're shopping for the only creature that doesn't care whether you've brushed your teeth that day. Actually, he'll probably like you more for it, and if that's not love, then I have no idea what is. If you're one of those people who loves your dog more than anyone else, check out these genius inventions for your favorite pet . 1 Is The Grass Really Greener? Let Your Dog Decide Source: Amazon \nTransparent Fence Window for Dogs , $35, Amazon \nIf you've got a fence, I can pretty much guarantee that your dog is dying to know what's over it.

Whether you're close with your neighbors or your dog just wants to watch the cars roll by, this little gadget makes outside time even better than it was already. 2 A Trendy Travel Water Bottle For Your Dog Source: Amazon \nH2O4K9 , $18, Amazon \nThis genius water bottle (called the H2O4K9 ) was designed specifically for dogs. The lid twists off and doubles as a handheld bowl for your pet, and the shape of it was made to fit a dog's natural drinking style. It comes in six bright colors and is a must-have if you often take your best friend hiking or traveling with you. 3 Take Your Pupper Everywhere With You \nAmazonBasics Waterproof Hammock Seat Cover , $20, Amazon \nQuit leaving your dog at home when you go for joy rides. This waterproof hammock seat cover gives you a safe, easy, and tidy way to transport your pets. It protects the seats from scratches while keeping your dog contained in the back seat, and it's got extra pockets for leashes, toys, and other pet supplies. 4 This Luxurious Dog Bed Fit For A King (Spaniel) \nDreamcatcher Dog Bed , $120, Amazon \nYou know you love your dog when you buy them a new couch before you buy yourself one.

It's ideal for dogs up to 30 pounds, and it adds a little class to any room. 5 This Fashionable And Practical Bag For... Well, Y'Know \nTurdlebag , $18, Uncommon Goods \nThis tasteful solution called the Turdlebag makes picking up after your dogs as pleasant as it'll ever be. It conveniently attaches to your leash or backpack, it's got a snapstrap to keep the bags contained until you need them, and it has a pocket to keep your keys or wallet. It's also fully lined and machine washable to create the most fashionable, convenient poop bag you've ever used. 6 Indulge Your Best Friend \nSoap Club Natural Hypoallergenic Pet Shampoo , $20, Amazon \nWould you spend $20 on a shampoo for yourself? Probably not, but this Soap Club natural hypoallergenic pet shampoo is entirely worth it, because A). It's for your best friend, and B). it uses incredibly healthy and safe ingredients like coconut oil, chamomile, and aloe vera. Despite the name, it's actually entirely soapless and cleanses and conditions in a safe, gentle, and effective way. If your dog has an allergy, this leaves them soft, clean, fluffy, and happy. 7 This Adorable Rain Jacket That Comes In Multiple Sizes \nGuardian Gear Pet Rain Pet Jacket (XS-XXL) , $13-$20, Amazon \nMaybe I'm weird, but when I see a dude walking his dog in the middle of a downpour, I feel for the dog more than the human. This Guardian Gear pet rain jacket keeps your dog dry and comfortable in the rain because of its cute little hood and body cover. Five different sizes, elastic leg straps, and a velcro tummy strap ensure that it fits most dogs, and it's got a reflective stripe to keep him safe in poor visibility. 8 A Hand Screen Printed Pillow Of Your Favorite Breed \nDog Blueprint Pillows , $95, Uncommon Goods \nA gorgeous gift for yourself or a loved one, these dog blueprint pillows feature hand screen printed profiles of your favorite breed, and there are tons to choose from.

      "text": "GE liked Amazon's Alexa so much they put a ring on it Alexa, light the way! Ashley Barry December 07, 2016 \nAlexa's a pretty cool invention, right? Amazon's virtual assistant tells jokes, dims your living room lights, and responds to famous Star Wars quotes. I mean, what more can you ask for? In addition to rattling off compelling news stories, she also entertains the masses wherever she goes. My sister, for example, stores the portable Echo device in her kitchen because she likes playing music while she cooks. But whenever I'm over her house, I always end up having a wild dance party with her two young children in the kitchen. I think I've discovered Alexa's real purpose. \nAt the end of the day, the digital assistant improves people's lives. Whether she's controlling smart home devices or answering a scientific question, Alexa plays a crucial role in day-to-day routines and activities. And she's about to get even better thanks to General Electric. \nThe tech giant's releasing an unusual looking LED lamp that's attached to a device that looks like the Echo Dot. The table lamp's circular design is unique and somewhat futuristic. It actually reminds me of the glowing identity disc from the Tron franchise. This adorable light relieves stress and makes kids happy \nThe lamp works like an Echo device. The always-on microphone will listen for commands and questions. All you have to do is say the magic word. It seems neat, but the sound quality is less than stellar. The speakers are on par with the Echo Dot speakers. If it's quality speakers you're after, you'd have better luck buying the original Echo. \nWhat you're seeing is a prototype. The final product might be a different story altogether, but I'm no prophet. Right now there's no release date, but GE expects the lamp to ship sometime in late 2017. Is it cool? Definitely. Is it practical? Maybe. I like the design, but it might be too big to store on a table. I can see myself knocking the decorative lamp over by mistake.

Scott Fitzgerald (played by TV's \"Allegiance\" actor Gavin Stenhouse). \nSet during the early days of the Jazz Age (circa \"the Roaring Twenties\"), the series dramatizes the years before Fitzgerald became a literary icon for writing his 1925 masterpiece \"The Great Gatsby,\" which in part was influenced by the woman he married: \"Z.\" \nCreated and written by TV producing-writing duo Dawn Prestwich and Nicole Yorkin (The Killing, The Riches), the Amazon drama also stars David Strathairn and Jim True-Frost. \nActor-filmmaker Tim Blake Nelson (Anesthesia, The Grey Zone) directs the pilot episode, which is currently available for streaming. The rest of the show's first season will premiere on Friday, January 27, 2017. \nsynopsis: Z: The Beginning of Everything is a bio-series of the life of Zelda Sayre Fitzgerald, Southern Belle turned flapper, writer and icon of modern feminism. Starting right before Zelda meets unpublished writer F. Scott Fitzgerald in 1918, Z dives into the fascinating life of a woman ahead of her time and the story of the most famous, and infamous, couple of the Roaring 1920s. \n\ndirected by Tim Blake Nelson (pilot episode) \nstarring Christina Ricci, Gavin Stenhouse, David Strathairn, Jim True-Frost \nrelease date January 27, 2017 (on Amazon)",

      "text": "| How-To \nSonos and Amazon jointly announced their Alexa integration earlier this year and the world rejoiced. Voice control of your Sonos system is one of those holy grails. The integration is expected to be available at some point in 2017. \nBut I’m an impatient geek so, while I’m waiting for official support to be available, I spent an hour yesterday getting this working using freely-available open-source tools. Fair warning : to follow this tip you’ll need to be a geek, too or, at the very least, if you follow this tip you’ll most certainly be a geek by the end. Voice-control of your Sonos system is very natural experience. Jump through a few hoops and you can have it today. \nI now live in the mostly-bliss state that comes with having the ability to say, “Alexa, tell Sonos to pause,” or “Alexa, ask Sonos what song is playing,” or even, “Alexa, tell Sonos to add the living room to the kitchen.” It’s pretty cool, and it mostly-works. For a freely-available, open-source type of setup, it’s amazingly robust. How You Can Integrate Alexa with Sonos Today \nYour path will start with the very clear instructions at Ryan Graciano’s echo-sonos repository , but before I send you off I figure you might appreciate reading the high-level approach to what you’re about to do. There are essentially three pieces that you’ll stitch together. First, you’ll install node-sonos-http-api on a computer at your house. This could be a Mac, a Synology DiskStation, a Raspberry Pi or anything else that can run node.js (hint: if you want to install node.js on your Mac, first install homebrew , then type “brew install node”). That will be the local bridge between the outside world and your Sonos. Second, you’ll create an Alexa Skill, hosted at Amazon, that will eventually talk across the internet back to your bridge computer at your house. I know… Alexa is in your house and so is Sonos. But Alexa talks to Amazon, and then Amazon talks to the other services that Alexa controls. It’s weird to think about, but that’s how it works. You’ll need to set up a free Amazon Developer Account to do this, and Ryan’s great instructions walk you through this, too. Note : during the process of creating the Alexa Skill you will have to add things like PRESETS, ROOMS, SERVICES and more to your Alexa Skill. Don’t worry that these names don’t match your existing rooms, playlists or services. Yours will be dynamically collected when you fire it all up at the end. \nAnother note : create your Alexa Skill and Amazon Lambda service using the same Amazon account to which you have your Amazon Echo devices attached, otherwise they won’t talk with each other. You’re going to leave this skill in Developer Test mode because it’s only built to talk to your house, so it must all be attached to the same account “for testing.” Finally, you’ll configure Amazon’s Lambda servers to talk to both the Alexa Skill and the node.js server you set up at home. At that point, you’re finished. Talk to your Sonos (via your Echo) and… listen to the results! \nAs I said, this took me about an hour to do, but I already had node.js setup on my Mac via homebrew, and I’m pretty comfortable with the command-line. Most importantly, though, I didn’t really care if I broke something, and that’s the trick. If you get it wrong, you can just wipe it all out and start again. Or not. But when you get it working, it’s pretty darned cool. \nHead over to Ryan’s echo-sonos GitHub repo to get started, have fun, and let us know in the comments how it goes. If you run into trouble, we might just be able to help, too! Share this:",

      "title": "The Good Girls Revolt Creator Is Not Happy With Amazon",
      "text": "By Laura Hurley 27 minutes ago \nAmazon had some bad news recently for the cast and crew of new show Good Girls Revolt , as the period drama was cancelled a little over a month after its first season hit the web on October 28. No revealing data has been released to the public, so it's hard to guess just why Amazon decided not to invest in a second season. According to Good Girls Revolt creator Dana Calvo, however, Amazon Studios mishandled the entire situation, and she had this to say about the studio in the wake of her show's cancellation: \nWhat we hadn't factored in is that [Amazon Studios head] Roy Price just doesn't care for the show. He's representative of the Amazon culture in that he's just impenetrable. All I know is that in the [Season 2] pitch, he asked us to refer to the characters by the actors' names because he didn't know the characters' names. \nWell, I hope Dana Calvo wasn't aiming to ever work with Amazon ever again (under Price's reign), because she may have just burned that bridge beyond repair. Her scathing rebuke of Roy Price's treatment of Good Girls Revolt is, at the very least, proof that Calvo didn't see the cancellation coming. The feminist drama wasn't exactly creating the same widespread buzz on the streaming circuit as a Stranger Things or a Transparent , but it was definitely the only show of its kind today, and streaming ratings company Symphony Advanced Media claims it was a big winner in key female demographics. The cancellation must have come as a huge disappointment for the team at Good Girls Revolt , especially if they were already laying plans for Season 2. \nDana Calvo also claimed in her chat with THR that Good Girls Revolt was a hit in two viewer categories that Amazon values: viewers giving the show high ratings on Rotten Tomatoes and viewers who do shopping after or while they're doing their streaming. But on the flip side, Amazon Studios' head of comedy and drama Joe Lewis denied Symphony Advanced Media's claims and has stated that the show wasn't performing well enough in overall viewership or completion rates to warrant a renewal for Season 2. \nWe may never find out for sure who is right in this case of she said/he said. Amazon doesn't release data about its streaming series as a general rule, and numbers from outside sources can never be 100% verified. That said, if production company Sony Pictures Television gets its way, the Amazon cancellation might not actually matter all that much. Rather than write off the show as a failure, Sony is currently shopping Good Girls Around to other platforms to see if it can score a renewal somewhere other than Amazon. The prime targets as of now are Freeform , USA Network, Bravo, Hulu, and ABC. Netflix and Lifetime are also possibilities, but they're considered long-shots compared to the other outlets. \nThe unofficial renewal deadline in December 31st, after which the cast members' contracts will expire and pretty much put an end to any plans to bring everybody back for another go at Good Girls Revolt . While we wait to hear more, stay tuned to CinemaBlend for the latest in TV news, and check out our midseason 2017 premiere schedule .

      "text": "By Andreas Barthelmess \nWhether Amazon, Airbnb or price comparison websites: In many industries, digitalisation has shifted power to customers in the last ten years. The banking industry, however, has remained resilient against radical changes for a long time. In fact, things like digital transparency and the power of small private customers do not fit into the traditional self-image of banks. Yet, from a customer perspective, the question is: \nWhat have the banks done in the last few years to improve the lives of their customers? \nAlthough most banking services can be used online today, the services haven’t changed at all – not even esthetically . \nATMs, for example, look today just as they did twenty years ago. Customer-oriented product design? Not a relevant category for most banks. In fact, Banks have never been more unpopular than today. \nCustomers don’t trust so-called “innovations” provided by an industry that has brought them little benefit, but has plunged them into a major financial crisis instead. \nAs a result, urban trendsetters, and other customer categories previously shunned by banks, have moved closer to “non-banks”, where appearance and customer focus are more up to date and authentic. \nThese young tech companies from the financial world – mostly referred to as ‘Fintechs’ – are the expression of the new power customers hold in the financial sector. Customer empowerment is visible in several ways: First, Fintechs offer simpler, quicker and more easily accessible financial services – be it transfers, credits or mobile payments. Even more important, from an economic and social perspective, is the fact that Fintechs give many people, who were previously excluded, access to financial services. \nNew lending marketplaces, for example, give loans to start-ups, employees or students, who are commonly considered as “risk groups” by traditional banks, based on sophisticated scoring models. \nAccording to a recent study by PricewaterhouseCoopers, up to 4.3 million additional people in Germany alone will be able to realise their entrepreneurial, professional or private projects via online lending. With the EU property loan policy making the middle class’ access to home ownership significantly more difficult, now access to credit and equal opportunity go hand in hand. \nDue to their transparency and promise of inclusion, Fintechs rise above the ponderous smugness of the banks and open up the prospect of a fairer financial system. \nThe competition from these young technology firms reduces customers’ dependence on banks while limiting the banks’ power. Moreover, they are an effective remedy against the too big to fail logic, which largely underpins public distrust in banks since the financial crisis of 2008. As failures in the peer-to-peer system can no longer be passed on to tax payers as a whole by using the threat of a bank collapse, in the Fintech ecosystem, private investors carry both the chances for high returns and the risk of impairment for individual loans failing. So, what is the role of banks in the future? \nThey will most likely still be around in 2025, albeit in a smaller role, particularly in retail banking: They will primarily provide the regulatory infrastructure and handle various supporting processes. \nMost banks will merely act as a dumb pipe, providing backend processes to other financial service providers, like many telecommunication companies today. The new players however will take over the product creation part and will be the ones who will be dealing with the customer. \nMy thesis is: Fintechs will end up becoming a kind of regulatory system for the banks by rule of the market. What lawmakers haven’t been able to achieve, will now be accomplished via digitalisation: the limitation of the power of banks. \nThe financial world is set to become a fairer, more liberal and at the same time more stable place. In the end, the financial sector will be getting its revolution after all, without riots and street fightings, but driven by a young, digital generation of entrepreneurs. \nAndreas Barthelmess is an Executive Adviser of leading FinTech companies.

      "text": " Google+\nDavid Ryder/New York Times\nAmazon is testing its Amazon Go store in Seattle.\nBy Hiawatha Bray Globe Staff December 08, 2016\nThere were about 3.4 million cashiers in the United States in 2005, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. There are roughly as many today. And, whether Amazon.com likes it or not, there will probably be about the same number a decade from now.\nThe giant retailer earlier this week announced Amazon Go , an ambitious plan to build thousands of a radically new type of grocery store: one without any checkout counters. It’s thrilling stuff, and I hope they pull it off. But I doubt it would lead to the mass extinction of retail clerks anytime soon.\nAdvertisement\nAmazon Go is just one of many efforts along similar lines — self-checkout, for instance, or using smartphones to scan the groceries before we bag them ourselves. So far, none of these innovations have bought us close to clerk-free shopping.\nAmazon has successfully reengineered the way we buy books, electronics, clothing, and countless other products. But groceries are different. Most of us still buy our food in person, where we can look, touch, and sniff. And we like having lots of choices. So supermarkets today still look and work the way they did a couple of decades ago.\nGet Business Headlines in your inbox: The Globe's latest business headlines delivered every morning, Monday through Friday. The typical supermarket stocks about 45,000 items from around the world. They’re marvels of logistics technology. But they also suffer from a common weak point — a bottleneck at the checkout counter, where impatient shoppers are funneled to overworked cashiers. While each worker isn’t paid much, their wages are a major cost for retailers.\nAmazon would do away with checkout workers. Instead, shoppers will check in at the front of the store with a smartphone app. Then they simply walk the aisles, take whatever they want, and leave. The Go store will tally each item they’ve chosen and bill the shopper’s Amazon account.\nTo make it work, Amazon must figure a way to identify individual shoppers and track their purchases, so you could stick a candy bar in your pocket and be billed for it when you hit the door.\nAdvertisement\nA promotional video for Amazon Go doesn’t provide much detail. Still, a patent application filed by Amazon in 2014 offers some clues: The company may use cameras equipped with facial recognition to “follow” customers through the store, or track them using Bluetooth radio signals from their phones. In addition, Amazon could use cameras and “smart” pressure-sensitive shelves to detect when a customer picks up an item.\nAmazon is testing the technology at a small store in Seattle that it plans to open to the public in 2017. It eventually hopes to open 2,000 such stores, but hasn’t revealed a timetable. At 1,800 square feet, the first Go facility is about the size of a convenience store. In principle there should be no limit to how large such a store could be.\nThis bold plan will take years to play out, precisely because it’s so bold. The company compares it to the effort to build self-driving cars, and with good reason. Like creating a fleet of self-driving vehicles, building thousands of checkout-free retail stores won’t happen quickly.\nMeanwhile, it’s hard to see other grocery companies trying to beat Amazon to the punch. Imagine the cost of installing such a system in every supermarket. Grocers work on notoriously thin profit margins — about a penny on the dollar. And they don’t share Amazon.com’s willingness to lose money for years. So they’ll be slow to retrofit America’s 38,000 supermarkets.\nSelf-checkout kiosks are the next best thing. They’ve been around for years, but haven’t taken over the world, for a number of reasons. Laziness, for instance. Self-checkout is fine for two or three items, but when you shop for a cartload, you probably want help with the bagging.\nBesides, too many of us are thieves. A two-year survey of American and European retail stores, conducted by the University of Leicester in England, found that nearly 4 percent of the goods hauled away by self-checkers hadn’t been paid for. That’s twice the ripoff rate when human clerks are around. So, many theft-wary retailers don’t offer self-checkout, and others are backing off, such as giant retailer Albertsons LLC, which has pulled self-checkout kiosks from many stores, including its Boston-area Shaw’s supermarkets. Even companies that use the kiosks, like Quincy-based Stop & Shop, have only a few in each store, while most checking is still done by humans.\nMany Stop & Shop stores also feature a scan-as-you-go system that lets shoppers use a hand-held device or smartphone to check out their own groceries as they roam the aisles. Walmart is installing a similar system at its Sam’s Club stores. The technology is proven, but requires a bit of effort, and the cameras on some cheap smartphones aren’t up to the job of reading product barcodes. It’s easier to let a human checker do the work.\nAmazon Go looks to be easier still. If Amazon can make it work on a large scale, it will be the biggest innovation in retail technology since credit cards. Don’t forget that Visa and MasterCard were invented in the mid-60s, but took about 20 years to catch on. Instant shopping is another fine idea that won’t happen instantly.\nHiawatha Bray can be reached at hiawatha.bray@globe.com . Follow him on Twitter @GlobeTechLab .",
