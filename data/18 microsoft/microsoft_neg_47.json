      "text": "  \n(Microsoft) A potential successor for the Lumia 950 (shown), which could be the rumored Surface Phone, may be launched next year \nWork may have already started on Microsoft's Surface Phone, and recent rumors are even hinting that it is about to enter a crucial period in its development. \nA recent report from Commercial Times states that known Apple supplier Pegatron is now collaborating with Microsoft. \nFurthermore, the supplier is apparently set to start trial production of the still largely unknown smartphone, Patently Apple reported. \nThis is a remarkable development, and if confirmed, it could be a hint that the Surface Phone will arrive sooner than expected. Advertisement \nThe Commercial Times also noted that the missing Microsoft smartphone may be officially unveiled next year. \nA possible 2017 release date for the new Microsoft offering has already been hinted at previously. \nBack in October, a ZDNet report also mentioned a possible 2017 launch for the smartphone, specifically noting that it may take place later that year. The article added that if the new phone is still nowhere to be seen next year, then it could show up sometime in 2018. \nMore recently, another report, this one from Nokia Power User , once again mentioned a late 2017 arrival for the smartphone. \nThe Nokia Power User report is a little more substantial as it offers some potential phone specs along with a possible debut date. \nAccording to the Nokia Power User report, prototypes of the Surface Phone are currently making use of the Snapdragon 835 processor. \nDifferent prototypes of the new Microsoft device also reportedly sport varying RAM levels, with one offering 4GB of it and the other providing 6GB. \nPerhaps owing to its late 2017 release date, the new smartphone may also end up featuring the Redstone 3 version of the Windows 10 operating system. \nThe folks over at Microsoft have yet to confirm anything with regards to the Surface Phone, but if recent rumors are true, then more details about the device may emerge sooner rather than later.

      "text": "Microsoft’s free Word Viewer application to be discontinued Posted 30 November 2016 17:54   \nMicrosoft today announced that Word Viewer will no longer be available from November next year. The free application can be used to view Word documents and is especially useful for users who want to view the contents of Word documents without installing and/or purchasing Office. \nBecause Word Viewer doesn’t execute macros it’s often recommend as the default viewer for Word documents. \nMicrosoft not only announced that Word Viewer will be retired and can’t be downloaded anymore, it also no longer will receive security patches. That means that viewing Word documents through Word Viewer can be become insecure in the future, especially because vulnerabilities in Microsoft Office can also occur in Word Viewer. \nWindows 7 and Windows 8.1 users are advised to upload documents to OneDrive and then watch them through Word Online. In this case the files have to uploaded to the cloud. Android, iOS and Windows 10 can download a free Word app from Microsoft through their app stores. \nThe software will be pulled in November 2017.",

      "title": "What Successful Movements Have in Common",
      "text": "The declaration of surrender was touted as a triumph: “ Microsoft Loves Linux ,” the headline read, but just a decade earlier, the firm’s then CEO, Steve Ballmer,  had called Linux a cancer . The all-powerful tech giant had lost and lost badly — to a ragtag band of revolutionaries, no less — but still seemed strangely upbeat.\nOverthrows like these are becoming increasingly common and not just in business. As Moisés Naím observed in his book, The End of Power , institutions of all types, from corporations and governments to traditional churches, charities, and militaries, are being disrupted. “Power has become easier to get, but harder to use or keep,” he writes.\nThe truth is that it’s no longer enough to capture the trappings of power, because movements made up of small groups are able to synchronize their actions through networks. So if you want to effect lasting change today, it’s no longer enough to merely command resources, you have to inspire opponents to join your cause. History shows these movements follow a clear pattern.\nMake Your Purpose Clear In a previous article about why some movements succeed and others fail , I compared the Occupy and Otpor movements. Occupy, as most people are aware, was a band of young activists who took over Zuccotti Park in Manhattan to protest against social and economic inequality. Otpor was a similar group in Serbia that sought to overthrow the Milošević regime.\nDespite their similarities, the results they achieved couldn’t have been more different. In the case of Occupy, the protesters were back home in a few short months, achieving little. Otpor, on the other hand, not only toppled Milošević, it went on to train activists in the Georgian Rose Revolution , the Ukrainian Orange Revolution and the April 6 Youth Movement in Egypt, just to name a few.\nOne reason for the disparity is that while Otpor had one clear goal, to overthrow Milošević, it was hard to tell what Occupy wanted to be done. As Joe Nocera noted in a New York Times column, the group “had plenty of grievances, aimed mainly at the “oppressive” power of corporations,” but “never got beyond their own slogans.”\nClarity of purpose is a common theme in successful movements. For example, Gandhi’s allies questioned his idea to make the salt tax a primary focus , because they favored a plan for more comprehensive change, but he saw that a single issue, even a small one, could unify the nation and break British Raj’s monopoly on power.\nValues Are More Important Than Slogans \nIn Team of Teams , General Stanley McChrystal argued that building a shared purpose is essential to distributed action. “An organization should empower its people, but only after it has done the heavy lifting of creating shared consciousness,” he observed.\nHere again, we see a stark contrast between Occupy and Otpor. While both took a non-hierarchical approach, distributing power broadly, Otpor was far more organized and disciplined, creating a training curriculum and holding bootcamps to indoctrinate new members in the principles of nonviolent struggle.\nLike clarity of purpose, an emphasis on training is a common attribute of successful movements. In John Lewis’s memoir of his role in the civil rights movement, Walking With the Wind , he continually underlines the importance of training activists. Protests are incredibly stressful and often meet with fierce opposition. Training helps activists maintain discipline.\nIf you look at pictures or film of the sit-ins and marches of the 1960’s, you’ll see nicely dressed young men and women keeping their composure in the face of snarling dogs and police batons. That was a tactic civil rights protesters intentionally adopted, and it worked. Now compare that to the unkempt protesters at Occupy events. That’s the difference that creating and instilling values makes.\nThe Strength Of A Movement Is Not Large Crowds, But Small Groups \nIn the 1950’s, the prominent psychologist Solomon Asch undertook a pathbreaking series of conformity studies . What he found was that in small groups, people will conform to a majority opinion. More recent research suggests that the effect applies not only to people we know well, but that we are also influenced even by second and third degree relationships.\nSo while we usually notice successful movements after they have begun to attract large crowds and hold massive demonstrations, those are effects, not causes, of successful mobilization. It is when small groups connect — which has become exponentially easier in the digital age — that they gain their power.\nIn The Tea Party and the Remaking of Republican Conservatism , Theda Skocpol and Vanessa Williamson observed that the movement was largely based in a wide-ranging assortment of groups that met in local cafes and coffee shops. “There is not, therefore, a single Tea Party organization or even a well coordinated network,” they wrote.\nThat’s why founders of Otpor warn in their training manuals about the dangers of holding large demonstrations too early. Rather, they suggest that protesters focus on building capacity and strategically sequencing their actions to gain support. If you can do that successfully, eventually the large crowds will take care of themselves.\nOvercome Increasing Thresholds Of Resistance \nWhile focusing on building a shared purpose among a network of small groups is an effective way to build ideological continuity, it also presents a danger. Tight-knit groups of likeminded people often forget that many others do not hold the same views. Often, as in the case of the Bernie Bro phenomenon last summer, they come to regard dissent as illegitimate.\nThat’s a real problem, because for any movement to spread and effect change, it needs to overcome steadily increasing thresholds of resistance . If only the views held inside the movement are seen as legitimate, then outsiders come to be seen as targets for attack. That’s why so many movements never create change that lasts, they create enemies that undermine their cause.\nConsider, on the other hand, Martin Luther King’s “I Have A Dream” speech. It spoke not just to the problems of African Americans, but to the founding principles of the nation. It was that approach that grew the movement beyond its core constituency of southern blacks and made inroads to the larger public.\nThe truth is that movements rarely, if ever create change themselves. Rather, they inspire change through influencing outsiders.  Consider that in the end that it was President Lyndon Johnson, a southern white man from Texas, who signed the Civil Rights Act that Martin Luther King, Jr. had championed.  \nRely on Engagement, Not on Rhetoric \nEight years ago, Barack Obama created a powerful movement that swept him to a stunning electoral victory, but inspired such fierce resistance that he had trouble enacting his agenda.  Donald Trump now aims to lead a nation that seems, if possible, even more divided. We seem doomed to stay stuck in a cycle of recrimination.\nWhile it is easy to place the blame for this polarization on the politicians themselves, we must also realize that they reflect the movements that brought them to power. All too often, we are content to live in different worlds and shout at our screens. And as long as some feel victimized and others feel demonized, we will remain a country divided.\nYou can write all the scathing tweets and heartfelt Facebook posts you want, but the truth is that rhetoric rarely persuades. The way to change minds is through face-to-face engagement. This is what President Obama was talking about when he said he won Iowa in 2008 because he “spent 87 days going to every small town, fair, fish fry, and VFW hall.” Similarly, progress on LGBT rights in America has not been made just because of eloquent arguments, but because of all the many personal interactions between straight Americans and their gay friends, neighbors, and colleagues.\nWe can only truly form a national consensus by internalizing the concerns of our fellow citizens and forming a common cause. If we can learn anything from successful movements throughout history, it’s this: lasting change does not come when one side delivers a knockout blow to the other, but when both sides are able to claim the victory as their own.\n",

      "text": "(Michael Reaves/Getty) \nMicrosoft Cortana — a virtual assistant predicting the winner of every NFL game on Bing — continued its hot streak, going 12-4 in outright picks in Week 12 to improve its overall record on the year to 104-71 (59%). \nIt's been an impressive run for Cortana of late. Week 11 featured a blistering 11-2 showing, which was followed up by a nice 12-4 slate over the holiday weekend. \nIn what has proved to be a wonky, up-and-down year, Cortana seems to have found its stride down the stretch. Its misses came by way of the Seahawks (who scored five points in a loss to the Bucs), the Texans (who continue to underwhelm), the Broncos (a wild OT loss), and the Eagles. \nThis week, Cortana and Las Vegas find themselves mostly in agreement, though several of their picks do look puzzling at first glance. Cortana gives the Saints a 70 percent chance to win, which feels high considering they are below .500 and the Lions are leading their division at 7-4. Similarly, the Chargers are favored by Cortana and Las Vegas against the Bucs, who are 6-5. If nothing else, these puzzling lines and predictions should make for interesting games. \nAs always, Cortana picks only the outright winner of each game. It does not make picks against the spread, though we like to include the point spread (in parentheses, courtesy of Vegas Insider ) for comparison. You can find Cortana's predictions by searching \"NFL schedule\" on Bing (picks made before the Thursday night game). \nHere are Cortana's Week 13 picks: \nDallas Cowboys (-2) at Minnesota Vikings — Cowboys 52% chance to win Denver Broncos (-5) at Jacksonville Jaguars — Broncos 69% chance to win Kansas City Chiefs at Atlanta Falcons (-3.5) — Falcons 63% chance to win Houston Texans at Green Bay Packers (-6.5) — Packers 53% chance to win Philadelphia Eagles at Cincinnati Bengals (+1) — Bengals 52% chance to win Detroit Lions at New Orleans Saints (-6) — Saints 70% chance to win San Francisco 49ers at Chicago Bears (-1.5) — Bears 57% chance to win Los Angeles Rams at New England Patriots (-13.5) — Patriots 81% chance to win Miami Dolphins at Baltimore Ravens (-3) — Ravens 52% chance to win Buffalo Bills at Oakland Raiders (-3) — Raiders 57% chance to win Tampa Bay Buccaneers at San Diego Chargers (-3.5) — Chargers 64% chance to win Washington Redskins at Arizona Cardinals (-2.5) — Cardinals 53% chance to win New York Giants at Pittsburgh Steelers (-6) — Steelers 63% chance to win Carolina Panthers at Seattle Seahawks (-6.5) — Seahawks 69% chance to win Indianapolis Colts (-1) at New York Jets — Colts 55% chance to win NOW WATCH: The epic story of how Vince McMahon created WWE and conquered pro wrestling \n\nMore From Business Insider \nOne of the NFL's most controversial defenders pulled off a ridiculous flop and got an opponent penalized \nAn NFL game turned into a WWE wrestling match as the Ravens came up with an ingenious way to run out the clock \nJohn Madden says the NFL's TV ratings are down because there aren't enough good teams and there are too many windows to fill",

SQL Server is a CPU-intensive technology, so virtual machines running it need to be able to access sufficient processing resources without causing contention among neighboring VMs. \nSQL Server virtualization tends to be complex, and there are a number of factors that go into the process of making it work. That includes controlling CPU allocation and resource utilization, as well as configuring the memory in SQL Server VMs to boost their scalability and avoid shortfalls in the amount of memory that's available to them when needed to run processing jobs. The good news is that Microsoft's Hyper-V virtualization software provides tools to help with the required work, at least in organizations using that technology. \nFor starters, Hyper-V contains a number of different settings that can be used to control CPU resource allocation on a per VM basis, as shown in Figure 1. Figure 1. Settings in Hyper-V for controlling allocation of virtual-machine CPU resources. \nBy default, the Hyper-V Manager only allocates a single virtual processor to virtual machines , so it's important to provide SQL Server VMs with a more appropriate number of virtual CPUs based on their workload and your SQL Server licenses. Then, to ensure that a virtual SQL Server receives sufficient CPU resources, you can use the \"Virtual machine reserve\" setting to select the percentage of the available resources reserved for that particular VM. \nThere are various ways to prevent your virtual SQL Server from causing CPU resource contention. For instance, you can adjust the \"Virtual machine limit\" and \"Relative weight\" settings in the resource control panel to cap CPU resource consumption for a SQL Server VM. Another option is to apply reserves to neighboring virtual machines in an effort to prevent them from becoming starved for resources. That can get tricky, however, since VMs can be live migrated to other hosts. \nIn addition, Windows Server 2016 introduces host resource protection , a feature specifically designed to stop VMs from taking up too much of the existing hardware resources. Host resource protection is exposed through Hyper-V's Set-VMProcessor cmdlet. It performs host-level monitoring of CPU consumption and throttles processing resources automatically if a VM begins to consume excessive CPU cycles. \nIT teams looking to virtualize SQL Server should also pay attention to the memory configuration of virtual machines. You can see the memory configuration options supported by Hyper-V in Figure 2. Figure 2. Hyper-V's memory configuration options for virtual machines. \nThe hypervisor provides a choice between using dynamic memory and memory that has been statically configured. Dynamic memory is a Hyper-V feature that's designed to increase the efficiency of a system's physical memory by making it a shared resource that can be automatically reallocated between different VMs as needed. However, that makes it dangerous to use with SQL Server, since SQL Server VMs will generally attempt to use as much memory as they can. Instead, it's best to statically assign memory to virtual SQL Servers. \nThe one exception is for SQL Server implementations running on host systems with a non-uniform memory access (NUMA) architecture, an approach designed to boost scalability by grouping together different sets of processors and portions of system memory into what are known as NUMA nodes. Figure 3. Hyper-V's configuration options for NUMA-based systems. \nProcessors can access memory assigned to any NUMA node, but it's faster to tap local memory that's in the same node as a CPU than it is to access remote memory in a different one. As a result, a SQL Server VM's virtual topology of NUMA nodes and sockets should be aligned with the physical hardware's topology. \nAs shown in Figure 3, Hyper-V's NUMA settings are located in a subcontainer beneath the Hyper-V Manager's Processor container. You can use them to align the topologies or to manually set limits on the number of processors and the amount of memory that can be allocated to virtual NUMA nodes and the number of nodes that are allowed on a single socket in a server. \nAnother best practice for running SQL Server on a Hyper-V virtual machine is to use Microsoft's Generation 2 VMs, which boot up more quickly than and often outperform their Generation 1 counterparts. However, since SQL Server's performance is ultimately tied to storage I/O , it's extremely important to ensure that the virtual hard disk's underlying storage delivers sufficient IOPS to meet the database's requirements. \nAnother consideration is the possible conflict between two different forms of high availability. When combined with Windows Failover Clustering, Hyper-V virtual machines can be made highly available at the VM level. But SQL Server also supports high availability independently of the hypervisor. If you choose to use SQL Server's high availability capabilities -- which involve setting up a so-called guest cluster -- you need to implement antiaffinity rules to prevent different SQL Server VMs that are part of a single guest cluster from residing on a common physical host. Otherwise, a host-level failure could undermine the reliability of the guest cluster. \nRunning SQL Server on a VM can be something of a tightrope walk between the database's need for resources and the needs of the rest of the system. Implementing best practices like these can keep your virtual SQL Server system well-balanced. Next Steps ",

      "text": "  10:11 AM EST Technicals Indicate More Gains Ahead For Microsoft \nFrom Corey Rosenbloom : Software giant Microsoft Corporation ( NASDAQ:MSFT ) continue to be a “strong stock getting stronger” as evidenced by yesterday’s new high. \nLet’s chart this bullish candidate and plan key levels on which to focus for any trades: \nOn the Daily Chart, we can see short-term pivot support/resistance levels at $56.00 and $58.00. \nWe’re also seeing a new short-term resistance level at $61.00 but if price holds above this level, it could easily develop into a similar future support shelf. \nFor now, we’re watching the small V-Spike Bullish Reversal in November that propelled price to the new high. \nIf we pull the perspective back to the weekly chart, the bullish uptrend becomes clearer : \nWe see additional larger-timeframe price pivot points and they include $40.00, $49.00, and again $56.00. \nNote how price rallied higher, found resistance, developed a range, and then broke through to new highs. \nWe’re in a pro-trend bullish impulse period where shares haven’t yet reached their new resistance high – most likely. \nAs such, focus on the Daily Chart levels in this strongly uptrending stock and expect higher prices ahead if price remains above $60.00. \nMicrosoft shares fell $0.30 (-0.49%) to $60.79 in Wednesday morning trading. Year-to-date, MSFT has gained 9.53%, putting it slightly ahead of the benchmark S&P 500’s return during the same time period. \nThis article is brought to you courtesy of AfraidToTrade.com .

      "text": "Foley on Microsoft Grand Plans with Sharpened Focus on Dynamics 365 Microsoft is hoping to give it's CRM and ERP line-of-business software offerings a shot in the arm with an Office 365-like makeover and focusing on unifying all aspects under one banner. By Mary Jo Foley 11/30/2016 \nLet's be candid. Until this year, Microsoft's Dynamics business was a sleepy backwater barely on the radar of most company watchers, partners and customers, where Salesforce and Oracle reigned supreme. Then suddenly, Dynamics -- CRM and ERP line-of-business software lines -- became dynamic. \nMicrosoft's interest in jumping into the business apps space surfaced last May when Salesforce.com CEO Mark Benioff reportedly spurned an acquisi­tion offer of approximately $55 billion, apparently holding out for a substantially greater bid. A month after the talks fizzled marked the beginning of the meltdown of love between the two companies when, as part of one of the company's many reorgs, Microsoft brass brought Dynamics more into the fold, with engineering moving to the Cloud and Enterprise unit. Once that happened, it appears Microsoft woke up to the reality that the company was just going through the motions regarding CRM and ERP. Sure, the company was making a bunch of acquisitions in those spaces but some, including Netbreeze and Parature, seemed to go nowhere and contribute little to the company's competitive lineup. \nThen out of the blue earlier this year, Microsoft announced a brand-new emphasis on Dynamics. Instead of keeping CRM and ERP in separate silos, Microsoft said it will combine the products in those buckets into a unified service called Dynamics 365, consisting of discrete modules that customers can mix and match in various ways. \nThe announcement of Dynamics 365 caught a bunch of longtime Microsoft partners and customers by surprise. Bits of leaked information about the coming licensing and pricing plans had many nervous because of their complexity and seeming expense. Microsoft's decision to try and up-level the conversation to focus more on \"business transformation\" and less on tangibles like migration strategies and features made room for conjecture and rumors. \nWhen Dynamics 365 became available for purchase for the first time last month, more than a few existing Dynamics CRM users contacted me, worried because their Dynamics CRM tile on their dashboards had disappeared but, as it turns out, they were actually there under the new name. Speaking of renaming, in some ways Dynamics 365 is largely a relabeling of pieces of Microsoft's existing CRM and ERP lineup, instead focusing on \"financials,\" \"sales\" and \"operations.\" \nBut there's more going on. As part of Microsoft's Office 365 productivity focus, CEO Satya Nadella and Co. are very focused on overhauling and improving business processes. Dynamics 365 is key to that mission. And mobile-first, cloud-first? Dynamics 365 -- even though it still encompasses on-premises versions of Microsoft's CRM and ERP products -- is a key part of Microsoft's strategy on those fronts. Until now, Microsoft wasn't pushing the Azure-hosted versions of its existing ERP wares very hard, even though it was encouraging (but not forcing) users to go to Dynamics CRM Online rather than Dynamics CRM on-premises as much as possible. \nThe Dynamics 365 service, along with Office 365, Intune, Power BI and a number of other evolving Microsoft cloud services, are part of the \"commer­cial cloud\" metric that Microsoft and Wall Street love to celebrate these days. Microsoft officials say they're on track to hit their self-imposed 2018 deadline to reach a $20 billion annual commercial cloud run rate. Currently, Microsoft officials say they're at the $13 billion annual run-rate mark. (Microsoft isn't breaking out how much of that $13 billion is from Azure versus Office 365 and other services, but my bet is the bulk is Office 365.) The only way Microsoft's going to hit $20 billion in a year-plus is to really grow all the parts of its cloud services business. \nThough Microsoft officials bristle (at least publicly) when any of us Microsoft historians mention the company's ill-fated attempt to unify its various ERP product lines via an effort known as \"Project Green,\" Dynamics 365 (with its Common Data Model shared-entity database) is, in reality, Microsoft's latest run at that 2007-era goal. This time around, the cloud is at the center of Microsoft's Dynamics plans. Bonus Links",

      "text": "Longtime Microsoft shareholder Dana Vance of Seattle with his Windows Phone at Microsoft’s annual meeting this morning. (GeekWire Photo / Todd Bishop) BELLEVUE, Wash. — “Please silence all Windows Phones and other devices,” was the announcement at the beginning of Microsoft’s annual meeting here this morning.\nIn any other setting it might have been a joke, but there were plenty of shareholders at the meeting who have shown their dedication to the company by opting for Windows-powered smartphones. And a couple of them had some pointed questions for Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella.\nMicrosoft CEO Satya Nadella listens to a shareholder question. (GeekWire Photo / Todd Bishop) Following its ill-fated $7 billion Nokia acquisition, Microsoft has cut back its smartphone hardware to a smaller number of flagship devices. Microsoft has also been making more of its own apps widely available for the more popular iOS and Android mobile platforms.\nMicrosoft shareholder Dana Vance, owner of a Windows Phone and a Microsoft Band, said he received an email about the Microsoft Pix app but was surprised to learn that it was available for iPhone and Android but not Windows Phone. Ditto for Microsoft Outlook. He also alluded to reports that Microsoft has put the Band on the back burner . Given this, he asked Nadella to explain the company’s vision for its consumer devices.\nAs part of his response, Nadella said Microsoft’s Windows camera and mail apps will include the same features as in Microsoft’s apps for other platforms.\n“When we control things silicon-up, that’s how we will integrate those experiences,” Nadella said. The company will “build devices that are unique and differentiated with our software capability on top of it — whether it’s Surface or Surface Studio or HoloLens or the phone — and also make our software applications available on Android and iOS and other platforms. That’s what I think is needed in order for Microsoft to help you as a user get the most out of our innovation.”\nAnother shareholder, who says he uses his Windows Phone “18 hours a day,” said he has heard Microsoft is “stepping away from mobile.” He asked, “Can you calm me down … and tell me what your vision is for mobile?”\nNadella answered, “We think about mobility broadly. In other words, we think about the mobility of the human being across all of the devices, not just the mobility of a single device.”\nHP Elite x3 “That said, we’re not stepping away or back from our focus on our mobile devices,” Nadella said. “What we are going to do is focus that effort on places where we have differentiation. If you take Windows Phone, where we are differentiated on Windows Phone is on manageability. It’s security, it’s Continuum capability — that is, the ability to have a phone that can act like a PC. So we’re going to double-down on those points of differentiation.”\nHe cited the HP Elite x3 device as an example of a Windows 10 phone that follows this strategy.\n“We will keep looking at different forms and different functions that we can bring to mobile devices, while also supporting our software across a variety of devices,” Nadella said. “So that’s the approach you will see us take. We are not stepping away from supporting our Windows Phone users. But at the same time we are recognizing that there are other platforms in mobile that have higher share, and we want to make sure that our software is available to them.”\nSee our earlier report for more from Microsoft’s annual meeting.

      "text": "100% FREE report malware 8 screenshots The official, free antivirus solution from Microsoft for Windows 7 and Vista computers, which provides basic protection against malware Microsoft Security Essentials (MSE) represents Microsoft's free anti-malware solution for computers running Windows 7 or Vista. It's considered by most third-party developers and testers to be a \"baseline\" among av products, and Microsoft never stated the contrary. App installation and interface Installing MSE is fast and easy. Its only requirement is that no other antivirus applications exist on the PC, since they are most likely to clash and cause Windows stability issues. Right before completing setup, the tool offers to run an initial scan to assess the PC's current security status as soon as it fetches the latest virus definitions. As far as the interface is concerned, MSE keeps separated the areas for scanning, virus and spyware definition updates, history, and settings. The overall look is comfortable and neatly organized, so inexperienced users shouldn't experience any issues in navigating it. Scanning modes and configuration There are three scanning modes available: \"Quick\" verifies only important system areas like Program Files and the Windows directory, \"Full\" runs a complete checkup on the computer, while \"Custom\" enables users to select the exact drives and directories to look into for malware (also possible via contextual scanning). Quick and full scan jobs can be scheduled to run on a regular basis. When it comes to modifying scan settings, users may establish default actions for threat detections, depending on the alert level (low, medium, high, severe). The real-time protection module can be disabled, while custom files, folders, file types and processes can be excluded. Other scan options focus on archives, removable drives, system restore points and quarantined files. Furthermore, it is possible to inspect and keep or delete quarantined files. Evaluation and conclusion MSE has a very good virus detection ratio and generally uses low CPU and RAM. However, it is quite slow regarding scanning speed, while software notifications cannot be disabled or controlled. Although Microsoft Security Essentials is not among the most powerful av products out there, it serves as a pretty good startup tool for casual users. Upgrading to a more powerful tool is a step necessary to take, though, sooner or later. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS For XP - CPU with clock speed of 500 MHz or higher For XP - Memory: 256 MB RAM or higher For Vista / W7 - CPU with clock speed of 1.0 GHz or higher For Vista / W7 - Memory: 1 GB RAM or higher VGA (Display): 800 x 600 or higher Storage: 140 MB of available hard-disk space An Internet connection is required for installation and to download the latest virus and spyware definitions for Microsoft Microsoft Security Essentials Internet Browser (IE or Firefox) New in Microsoft Security Essentials 4.0.1111.0 Beta: Enhanced protection through automatic malware remediation: The Beta program will clean highly impacting malware infections automatically, with no required user interaction. Enhanced performance: The Beta includes many performance improvements to make sure your PC performance isn’t compromised. Simplified UI – Simplified UI makes Microsoft Security Essentials Beta easier to use. New and improved protection engine: The updated engine offers enhanced detection with cleanup capabilities and better performance.",

      "text": "Microsoft Releases Windows 10 Version 1607 to Current Branch for Business GO The Anniversary Update is now a CBB release Nov 30, 2016 12:51 GMT · By Bogdan Popa · Share: ​Microsoft has recently announced that the Windows 10 Anniversary Update is now available for systems that are enrolled in the Current Branch for Business (CBB), as this version has already been validated by customers and the company fixed a significant number of bugs. In terms of fixes, the Redmond giant says that it included nearly 1,000 improvements based on customer feedback since the release of the Anniversary Update, so CBB systems can safely deploy this version as well. “With hundreds of millions of devices already running the CBB version 14393.447 installed by KB 3200970 or any later update, as indicated in the Windows 10 Release Info page, organizations can be assured Windows 10 1607 is fully ready for them,” Microsoft says. Microsoft then goes on to praise Windows 10, explaining that this operating system experienced an impressive growth in the enterprise sector, with adoption experiencing a 3x increase only in the last six months. Version 1507 getting updates till March Of course, the software firm does not miss the occasion to brag about some of the features that are part of Windows 10, such as the strengthened security, pointing out that users are 58 percent less likely to suffer from ransomware than on Windows 7. “Businesses are seeing significant value, enhanced security and improved productivity with Windows 10 today. With the Windows 10 1607 Current Branch for Business declaration, now is the time to accelerate your Windows 10 deployment,” Microsoft continues. The company says that installing the latest cumulative updates gets systems using the CBB fully up-to-date, but it also expects to publish installing media to the Volume Licensing Service Center and to Windows Server Update Services (WSUS) in January “just for convenience.” Microsoft also warned that Windows 10 version 1507 for CBB would continue to receive updates until March, while Windows 10 version 1511 will reach end of servicing approximately 6 months after Windows 10 Creators Update is released to the CBB.",

      "text": "The End Might Be Near: Lumia 950 and 950 XL Out of Stock in the UK GO Microsoft might not bring the phone back in stock Nov 30, 2016 09:43 GMT · By Bogdan Popa · Share: Rumor has it that Microsoft wants to discontinue the Lumia series of phones as soon as December and now a new report seems to suggest that we’re getting very close to this moment. GSMArena writes that Microsoft’s Windows 10 Mobile flagships are no longer available in the United Kingdom and there’s a good chance that the company doesn’t bring them back in stock in the future. Neither the Lumia 950 nor the 950 XL can be purchased from Microsoft’s stores in the country and this is believed to be one big step towards the company’s complete demise of the Lumia brand. It goes without saying that the device can still be purchased from other retailers and third-party stores, but with the company itself running out of Lumias and not planning to make more units available, one can only wonder how long it takes for the company to officially acknowledge the shut down for the brand. Here comes the Surface Phone It’s one-good-one-bad when it comes to news for Windows Phone fans, as there are reports that Microsoft might have started trial production of the Surface Phone with partner Pegatron. It’s believed that the Surface Phone project advances nicely, and Microsoft is ready to proceed to trial production, ahead of the public launch that could take place in the second half of the next year. Basically, Microsoft plans to give up on the Lumia brand in order to focus exclusively on the Surface Phone, a device that should be a flagship in all regards, coming not only with the best hardware a phone could get when it launches, but also with software improvements that would address the lack of apps. People with knowledge of the matter indicated that Microsoft was working on an emulation system that could enable a Surface Phone to run x86 apps in Continuum mode. These are all rumors for the time being, but given Microsoft’s lack of activity in the hardware side of Windows 10 Mobile, the discontinuation of the Lumia brand seems to be just a matter of time.",

      "text": "Microsoft Releases Windows 10 Cumulative Update KB3201845 for Insiders GO New cumulative update now being tested with insiders Nov 30, 2016 06:44 GMT · By Bogdan Popa · Share: ​Microsoft has just started testing a new Windows 10 cumulative update as part of the Windows Insider program, with the official release likely to take place in the coming weeks, possibly on December’s Patch Tuesday cycle. The new cumulative update is called KB3201845 and is available for both PCs and mobile devices, with users enrolled in the Release Preview rings of the Windows Insider program now getting it via Windows Update. There is no changelog available for the time being, but the cumulative update pushes the operating system version to 14393.479, up from 14393.447 or 14393.448 for PC and Mobile. Cumulative updates in Windows 10 For the moment, there are no reports of failed installs of Windows 10 cumulative update KB3201845, as this has become a major concern for users of Microsoft’s latest operating system every time the firm releases new updates. Insiders themselves have experienced issues with some previous cumulative updates, but this time, KB3201845 appears to install correctly on most systems, as we’re not aware of any bugs reported by those who received it. As far as users running the stable version of Windows 10 are concerned, there were quite a lot of issues caused by cumulative updates, and they’re not limited just to installation problems. Some have reported bugs after actually deploying the patch, and more recently, the company itself acknowledged that one of its cumulative updates caused some Lenovo systems to fail to boot . The latest cumulative update for Windows 10 computers running the Anniversary Update is KB3200970 and it was released on November 2016 Patch Tuesday. Just like it happened with its predecessors, KB3200970 experienced some installation problems as well, but there were significantly fewer complaints than for previous updates. We’ll keep an eye out to see if Microsoft provides a changelog for this new cumulative update and we’ll let you know when it becomes available for users who aren’t enrolled in the Windows Insider program.",

      "text": "\nMicrosoft recently released a free update for Forza Motorsport 6 focused on eSports and the ForzaRC. This update added a broadcast ticker option to all multiplayer races. When spectating a race in game, players now have the ability to toggle a ticker that gives up-to-the-moment positional data for all players in the race. As racers move up or down in position during race action, the ticker automatically changes. Also, it adds each racer’s Gamertag and positional information above their cars during a race, giving viewers the chance to follow the on-track more closely than ever before.\nMicrosoft also confirmed that they will be adding additional features to make competitive multiplayer even better in the coming months on Forza.\n",

      "title": "Windows 10 Mobile to get Reset App feature",
      "text": "0 0 \nThis week, Microsoft will release a new Windows 10 build for Insiders who own PCs and mobile devices, and there are reports claiming that smartphones will get at least one new feature named the “Reset App”. \nThe screenshot posted by Aggiornamenti Lumia suggests that the Reset App feature will be integrated into Windows 10 Mobile and will show up in the following build slated to be released this week. According to the Italian site, this feature will remove all cache and settings of an application to return it to its original state. There are many applications with bugs, glitches, and display errors when in use, so this feature will come in handy to help applications work better. Plus, if you reset applications, removing unnecessary data will help you save space — especially when it comes to browsers. \nAfter this feature is available, it will display information such as the storage required by the app files as well as user-generated data along with a button for resetting apps. Some say this addition was inspired by Android’s similar feature. \nIt seems that the location of this feature will be found in the Settings screen in the Advanced tab, but Microsoft might place it somewhere else when the feature becomes available to public users. Currently, only Insiders are able to reset applications, but when the Windows 10 Creators Update is launched in early 2017, resetting apps will be possible for everyone. \nThe new build is expected to be released this week and was supposed to come earlier, but Microsoft’s engineers took a few days off in order to spend Thanksgiving with their loved ones. We remind you that the new release will be available for both PCs and mobile devices. \nRELATED STORIES TO CHECK OUT:",

NOTE: CSV and JSON support is still in preview. Table Indexer enables you to ingest data from an Azure Table store. Custom Analyzers enable you to take control over the process of lexical analysis that’s performed over the content of your documents and query terms. For example, custom analyzers enable support for Phonetic search. For more information, read more on custom analyzers . Analyze API allows you to test built-in and custom analyzers to see how the analyzer breaks text into tokens.

      "title": "Wielding Their Windows Phones, Microsoft Shareholders Grill CEO Satya Nadella On Device Strategy - Slashdot",
      "text": "on Wednesday November 30, 2016 @03:21PM from the touch-questions dept. At a meeting with shareholders Wednesday, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella was asked numerous times what the company is doing about Windows Phones, and why do they keep hearing that Microsoft is abandoning smartphone manufacturer business. The stakeholders also asked why the company is seemingly focusing more on Android and iOS rival platforms instead of its own . From a report on GeekWire: Microsoft shareholder Dana Vance, owner of a Windows Phone and a Microsoft Band, said he received an email about the Microsoft Pix app but was surprised to learn that it was available for iPhone and Android but not Windows Phone. Ditto for Microsoft Outlook. He also alluded to reports that Microsoft has put the Band on the back burner. Given this, he asked Nadella to explain the company's vision for its consumer devices. As part of his response, Nadella said Microsoft's Windows camera and mail apps will include the same features as in Microsoft's apps for other platforms. \"When we control things silicon-up, that's how we will integrate those experiences,\" Nadella said. The company will \"build devices that are unique and differentiated with our software capability on top of it -- whether it's Surface or Surface Studio or HoloLens or the phone -- and also make our software applications available on Android and iOS and other platforms. That's what I think is needed in order for Microsoft to help you as a user get the most out of our innovation.\" Another shareholder, who says he uses his Windows Phone \"18 hours a day,\" said he has heard Microsoft is \"stepping away from mobile.\" He asked, \"Can you calm me down ... and tell me what your vision is for mobile?\" Nadella answered, \"We think about mobility broadly. In other words, we think about the mobility of the human being across all of the devices, not just the mobility of a single device. That said, we're not stepping away or back from our focus on our mobile devices,\" Nadella said. \"What we are going to do is focus that effort on places where we have differentiation. If you take Windows Phone, where we are differentiated on Windows Phone is on manageability. It's security, it's Continuum capability -- that is, the ability to have a phone that can act like a PC. So we're going to double-down on those points of differentiation.\" ",

      "text": "\nSketchable often features in Microsoft's Surface marketing, but is it actually any good?\nYes. In fact, it's rather amazing.\nAs a long-time Surface user and part-time doodler, I've always wondered how easily I could transition from pencil and paper to digital ink when it comes to sketching. I'm by no means a hardcore artist. I use Adobe CC for work, but I've found Photoshop's professional-grade complexity to be a tad inaccessible. Simpler, but powerful apps like Clip Studio Paint are good, but they can also be pretty expensive if you're only looking to draw occasionally for fun.\n\nSay hello to Sketchable . Accessible and cheap enough for a part-time hobbyist, yet powerful enough for hardcore artists. ",

      "text": "See full gallery on TechnoBuffalo After months of losing out to Microsoft, it looks like console sales are starting to shift to Sony’s favor again. The end-of-month sales data isn’t available quite yet, but data-tracking firm Adobe Digital Insights has Sony pegged as the winner according to GamesBeat. \nMicrosoft came out on top on Black Friday, beating out Sony’s PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 4 Pro, but Cyber Monday’s sales went to PlayStation 4, though only by a small margin. Adobe says Sony’s console is leading for the month overall, a change from the last four months in which Microsoft dominated the top of the charts. We and others speculated that Sony’s sales were down because of the impending release of the PlayStation 4 Pro, and the shift back seems to confirm that.\nSony’s momentum is irreversible at this point It seemed for a moment like Microsoft was shifting things back into its favor thanks to an excellent launch with the Xbox One S and improved perception thanks to the Xbox Play Anywhere cross-buy program and the Xbox One backwards compatibility initiative, but Sony’s PS4 Pro is a much bigger step up than the Xbox One S, and it seems like gamers are jumping on board.\nThe Xbox update code-named Scorpio could end up slowing things down if Microsoft really goes for it with a low price and high performance, but right now gamers are picking Sony’s system as much for its perceived popularity as for any advantages it might have. The Scorpio system is set to release next fall, though, giving Sony even more time to widen the lead they already have.\n\n\nSource : GamesBeat ",

      "text": "11-year-old Katherine “Kat” Neuweiler at the Microsoft shareholders meeting this morning. (GeekWire Photo / Todd Bishop) BELLEVUE, Wash. — Brad Smith, Microsoft’s president and chief legal officer, couldn’t help but remark on the age of the person who asked the final question at the company’s annual shareholder meeting this morning. “Having come here for something like 15 years, I think you’re the youngest person to stand up and ask a question, so it’s a pleasure to have you,” he said, to a round of applause from the audience.\nThe person at the mic was Katherine “Kat” Neuweiler, 11 years old, a sixth grader who traveled with her dad, Jeff Neuweiler, from their hometown of Arvada, Colo., to attend the Microsoft shareholder meeting. Kat is learning about stocks in her class at Sierra Elementary, and her dad is a longtime Microsoft shareholder. When he received notice of the annual meeting this year, the idea struck them to travel to the meeting together.\nMicrosoft President Brad Smith at the company’s annual meeting this morning. (GeekWire Photo / Todd Bishop) “We thought it would be really cool just to come out here and experience it for ourselves,” Kat explained.\nAdded her dad, “This is like a big field trip to actually see how it works, ask questions, learn about stocks and hopefully it will get her more excited about it, so she can take it back to her school and share her experiences with her classmates.”\nKat waited patiently in line while shareholders asked questions about the company and its products. When her turn came at the mic, this is the question she asked: “What investments is Microsoft planning to make for public schools?”\nSmith said in response that Microsoft invests in public schools in three ways: its education technology business, providing software and hardware to schools; its philanthropy, investing in programs to support students in public schools around the country; and “using our voice, together with others in our industry to champion the causes of public schools.”\nHe continued …\nWe’re very interested in making sure that first, students today in every school in this country and frankly around the world have the opportunity to learn the skills that are going to enable you and your peers to succeed in the decades ahead. In many cases that involves learning new things. But second, we’re really interested in working with public schools. We’re actually especially enthusiastic about the work that Gov. Hickenlooper is driving in the state of Colorado to launch new apprenticeship programs in Colorado.\nWe think that there’s a lot of opportunity to create new ways for students, starting in high school in the United States, to connect with what they’ll need to learn to go and get great jobs, whether they want to go to a community college or a four-year college, or just go straight into the workforce.\nSo as much as anything else, we see this as a moment in time where, in Colorado, in Washington and other states, there’s an opportunity for the business community and the nonprofit community and schools to really come together and innovate. And I’d actually say from my perspective, you happen to live in a state where there’s a lot of exciting innovation, and we’re trying to learn more from Colorado ourselves.\nIt was a comprehensive answer, and Kat seemed satisfied with it. “Thank you,” she said, as the meeting ended.\nShe and her dad are headed back home today, bringing one very unique field trip to a close.",

      "text": "07:10 AM Share \nPictured (left to right): Inspira Health CIO Tom Pacek, Mahaska IT director Chris Hickie and Roper St. Francis CIO Keith Neuman. \nInspira Health Network is currently in the process of building two gyms on its New Jersey campuses and developing a fitness app that patients and trainers can use to determine personalized exercise regimens. \nThe software captures patient generated health data from wearables and workout equipment, such as cardio machines. Users can also manually input old-fashioned types of exercise, including weight lifting repetitions, and trainers can verify that patients are doing what they're supposed to be doing, said Inspira ( #3 Large hospital ) CIO Tom Pacek. \nSuch data will ultimately be pulled into the EHR. Inspira is a Cerner shop, he said, undertaking an 18-month enterprise wide switch from 18 disparate platforms. \nNew EHRs: A platform for innovation Much like Inspira, three other health systems – Roper St. Francis and Lucile Packard Children's Hospital Stanford – are also harnessing their relatively new EHRs as a foundation for innovation. \nLucile Packard ( #3 Super hospital ), for instance, earned a HIMSS Stage 7 award for ambulatory and inpatient within one year of implementing Epic, according to CIO Ed Kopetsky. \nThe team invented and put to market a continuous monitoring tool for Type 1 diabetics, Kopetsky added. \n\"One of our physician fellows here worked with Apple and Epic to develop GluVue, a tool to continuously monitor blood sugar levels regardless of the patient’s location,\" Kopetsky said. \"This technology replaces four to five needle sticks a day and data is sent every five minutes to our EMR and doctors. You can see patterns of glucose levels and we can actually intervene.\" \n[Best Hospital IT 2016: CIOs divulge their worst nightmares ] \nRoper St. Francis ( #5 Large hospital ) went live with a Cerner EHR this fall, said CIO Keith Neuman. \n\"An integrated system is primary,\" Neuman said. \"And then the ability to implement fresh technology in our environment that will allow us to more easily pivot toward where we need to go.\" \nThat new direction includes what Neuman described as an App Store-like scenario. \n\"We want to provide that same kind of experience to our patients when they book an appointment or see a doctor or be there for follow-up,\" Neuman added. \"Virtual visits and Open Table-like appointment scheduling, that sort of thing.\" \nMission Health ( #5 Super hospital ) is also ramping up its patient experience efforts with an unlikely technology: Microsoft Xbox. The game console, in fact, works with Mission's electronic health record software as well as an app, camera and microphone to comprise what CIO Jon Brown called \"virtual sitters,\" that enable clinicians to communicate with patients from a central location rather than having to be in the room every time they get out of bed. \nNot limited to large providers Cutting-edge technologies are not the sole domain of large and super hospitals. \nMahaska Health Partnership ( #2 Small Hospital ) is also embracing innovation out of a spirit of necessity, using Raspberry Pi technology – inexpensive single-board computers – to create digital signage across the organization, IT director Chris Hickie said. \nMeanwhile, when Mahaska built a new wing for surgery patients, Hickie said the IT team installed Apple TV in every room and integrated iPads with a third-party translation service patients can use. \n[Best Hospital IT 2016: CIOs share secrets of managing a happy IT team ] \nNext up for Hickie and his team: MIPS and MACRA. \"A big part of that for us is onboarding to patient-centered medical home in our medical group,\" Hickie explained. \"I think that is going to have a large impact on our ability to drive toward increased value-based reimbursement.\" \nBack at the gym Inspira CIO Pacek said that the network is doing everything it can to create the kind of patient experience that keeps people coming back. \nIn addition to building the gyms and fitness app, Inspira is beginning work that Pacek said will ultimately enable clinicians to prescribe medical devices to patients. \nThe next phase for Inspira will be using social media tools and chatbots, pulling appropriate data into the EHR, then analyzing it to better understand patients. \n\"We're developing apps for patient engagement, trying to improve patient registration so they don't have to fill out papers, also to get rid of the clipboard,\" Pacek said. \"We're working on interfaces for call ahead seating so patients can look at wait times for urgent care or put yourself in line.\" \nJessica Davis and Mike Miliard contributed to this report. \nHealthcare IT News Best Hospital IT Departments 2016:",

      "text": "Next \nScammers may be making the rounds with tricks they've been using for years. A viewer tells us she was contacted via a recorded phone call with the caller claiming to be from Microsoft. The message said her Windows subscription had expired and she needed to call the number given, otherwise her computer would not work. According to Microsoft, the company doesn't make these types of calls. “Remember, Microsoft will never proactively reach out to you to provide unsolicited PC or technical support. Any communication we have with you must be initiated by you,” the company said in an online statement. According to Microsoft, cybercriminals often use phone directories to find victims. Another trick is pop-ups. \"Cybercriminals set up websites with scam pop-ups with messages and phone numbers. These pop-ups usually are not easy to close,\" the company said. Do not call the number in the pop-up. Microsoft’s error and warning messages never include a phone number. For more information, click here . Check out the latest scams we're seeing.

      "text": "by Chris Brook November 30, 2016 , 4:10 pm \nMicrosoft appears to have silently fixed a two-year-old bug in in Windows Kernel Object Manager that could have allowed for the bypass of privileges in Google’s Chrome browser. \nJames Forshaw, a researcher with Google’s Project Zero first reported the issue in December 2014 . Microsoft responded to Google a month later saying it didn’t consider the issue worthy of a fix. Forshaw and Google marked the issue as “WontFix” and removed the view restriction on the disclosure. It’s been more or less on ice since then. \nMicrosoft’s stance changed at some point over the past 23 months however; Forshaw acknowledged in a post on the Project Zero Google Group early Wednesday morning that Microsoft has fixed the issue in a recent Windows 10 fix. It’s unclear whether Microsoft addressed the issue in a hotfix or via a silently issued patch but according to Forshaw, it has been reflected in the “latest few major builds of Windows 10 (10586+)” \nThe issue, a limited bypass of traverse permissions, affected the Kernel Object Manager in Windows 7 (32/64 bit) and 8+. In 2014, Forshaw warned it could be possible for low privilege code to “access some device objects where it shouldn’t be possible [to] even determine they exist” in Chrome. \nChrome’s sandbox token is fortified – its traverse permission is heavily enforced, according to Forshaw – but this issue slightly diminished that. Got to love silent fixes ( https://t.co/A1dzgYzuwQ ). This corrects a long standing issue for Chrome's sandbox. Any comment @msftsecresponse ? \n— James Forshaw (@tiraniddo) November 30, 2016 \nForshaw called the issue a “limitation” for Chrome when he originally highlighted the issue and admitted he didn’t expect it would ever become a “bulletin class issue, if it’s considered an issue at all.” If anything, he said it could result in a “minor security impact for Chrome.” \nForshaw wrote Wednesday that he wasn’t sure what led Microsoft to fix the issue. \nMicrosoft, for its part, did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Wednesday. \nForshaw couldn’t speak directly to the issue when reached on Wednesday but pointed Threatpost to an updated post he had made on the issue tracker: \n“For anyone who’s wondering if this is unusual for Microsoft that they fixed it so long after reporting, not really. If MSRC and by inference the product team do not consider the issue to meet their bar for a security bulletin (as mentioned in comment #2) then they’ll tend to not fix it in a patch. However they do leave themselves open to fixing it a later update of the platform, which for Win10 is becoming more frequent.” \nForshaw adds that the fix may have been pushed inadvertently as other users of the function in question, SeCreateAccessState, may have been affected. \n“The trouble with this approach is there’s never any credit or notification for the fix and so I was under the impression that this issue still existed,” Forshaw said.

      "text": "Subscribe on YouTube\nIt seemed inevitable that Microsoft would create a Surface Phone — not an official name — after it acquired Nokia. In fact, there was talk long before that too , but Microsoft has often denied those rumors and stuck with producing new Lumia phones. However, rumors and leaks regarding such a device have continued, suggesting it’s something the company may still be considering. Here’s everything we think we know about Microsoft’s Surface Phone project.\nMicrosoft may wait until late 2017 to release Surface Phone After the Surface Phone failed to make an appearance at Microsoft’s 2016 BUILD conference , two reports from Windows Central quoting sources close to the matter, said Microsoft could wait until early 2017 to release the new device. The site’s late April report states April 2017 is the current target for the new smartphone. The first report said that instead of one Surface Phone, Microsoft could release three models. Early plans for the Surface Phone release allegedly suggest that there will be a consumer model, a business model, and an “enthusiast” model, or a high-spec version for tech geeks. Details about possible specs for the devices or what the difference will be between the three models have yet to be released.\nThe rumored timing of the Surface Phone has recently been pushed out to late 2017 . This follows statements by Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella in November 2016 that provides a tiny bit of clarification to Microsoft’s official position on smartphones. Specifically, Nadella indicated that Microsoft does not want to simply compete with the industry leaders with a “me-too” device but rather wants to focus its efforts and develop the “ultimate” mobile devices. If one reads between the lines, it would seem that the Surface Phone will be a high-end smartphone that’s possibly aimed at providing very specific value to the business market, serving as a halo device for Microsoft’s long-term mobile strategy, or some combination of both.\nRedstone 2 and 3 to improve Windows 10 Mobile The Windows 10 ‘Redstone’ update, also known as the Windows 10 Anniversary update, came and went without any more information on the Surface Phone. The Anniversary Update provided a number of new features to smartphones, but nothing earth-shattering, and it will be the next two versions of the operating system that will focus on “innovation around mobile phones,” according to multiple sources speaking to Windows Central .\nRedstone 2 and Redstone 3 aren’t expected until early and late 2017, respectively, the latter of which fits in with the prospective Surface Phone launch date now being rumored. When Redstone 3 does arrive , the resulting Surface Phone will apparently be promoted as the most secure phone in the world and the best for productivity. Part of this may include native support for Win32 apps provided by an enhanced version of the Continuum PC-like environment created when a Windows 10 Mobile device is connected to an external display, keyboard, and mouse.\nThe Lumia 950 and 950 XL offers some compatibility with x86 apps through Continuum, but no way to use them natively. Making them run on the phone without the help of a more powerful and expensive machine, might be a killer feature for power users. However, it’s warned the feature may be dropped before launch, if the experience isn’t polished enough.\nMicrosoft’s intention, say the sources, is to make the future Surface phone a true alternative to a PC, using both this feature and Continuum.\nBenchmarks and high-end specs rumored, then quashed A phone running Windows 10 and the Edge browser was spotted on the HTML5test benchmarking website in late November 2015. According to PocketNow , the version of Windows 10 was old, and one which was never released outside of the company, while the Edge browser was also older than the existing versions. The rumor suggested the phone was in testing for some time, and was likely an abandoned Nokia-derived device.\nRelated: Microsoft Band 2 review\nMore recently, Intel rumors have been challenged by Intel’s scaling back its mobile SoC market . Now, it appears that Microsoft will be working to emulate the x86 environment in 64-bit Windows 10 Mobile to provide support for full Windows desktop applications. Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 835 SoC has been rumored to power the Surface Phone along with 64-bit Windows 10 Mobile. Two versions are alleged, including a 6GB RAM version with the version of Continuum supporting x86 applications and a 4GB RAM version without it.\nRead More Microsoft purchased surfacephone.com If you’re looking for a hint that Microsoft will introduce a Surface Phone sometime in the future, then look no further than one Reddit user’s discovery in late January 2016. It appears that Microsoft owns surfacephone.com , and the company even went as far as redirecting it to the main Surface website.\nRelated: Can a Surface Phone save Windows 10 Mobile?\nBefore you go jumping for joy, this is far from a confirmation that Microsoft is readying a Surface Phone. Often, companies like to stay out of legal trouble by registering domain names that correlate with a current product.\nView photos\nmicrosoft-windows-mobile-surface-phone-1 More We also need to point out that surfacephone.com was actually registered in May 2007, so it’s not like Microsoft recently purchased it to get ready for a new Surface Phone launch.\nFurthermore, Microsoft’s Surface page is within microsoft.com as in https://www.microsoft.com/surface/ . Microsoft isn’t even using surface.com for its current crop of Surface devices, and so why would the company use surfacephone.com for a Surface Phone if it gets released? And by the way, Microsoft registered surface.com back in 1994 and is redirecting it to you know where … its main Surface Web page.\nWhile this news doesn’t confirm a Surface Phone will exist some day, along with all of the other information being leaked it does give hope that the Redmond company is at least thinking about it.\nMicrosoft executive hints about a better phone Those looking for more slivers of information about the rumored Surface Mobile device may want to take note of what Microsoft’s Chief Marketing Officer Chris Capossela said on This Week in Tech’s Windows Weekly podcast in December 2015.\n“We need more breakthrough work … with Surface we had a bunch of early misfires, but that notion of a tablet that could replace your laptop — that notion of saying, ‘Hey, Apple wants to sell you an iPad and they want to sell you a Mac, we think there’s one device that exploits the seam between those two devices’ — we need some sort of spiritual equivalent on the phone side that doesn’t just feel like a phone for people who love Windows,” Capossela said on the podcast.\nRelated: Why you absolutely, by no means should even consider buying a Windows Phone\n“It has got to be a phone that’s sort of like ‘wow, that’s a real shocker,’ or ‘that’s a real breakthrough,’ and has got to make me pause before I buy my 17th iPhone, and we need time to actually go built that.”\nThe question arises around the 36-minute mark, after tech writer Mary Jo Foley expresses her dismay at the current Windows Phone environment. Capossela made no mention of whether this “breakthrough” phone will be a part of the Surface line, and this new information only reaffirms that the device is indeed being developed by the company.\nRumored change in mobile strategy as Panos Panay takes charge A report from Windows Central suggests that the Surface phone rumored earlier in the year has been canceled, in favor of a new Surface phone being built by the Surface team, led by Panos Panay. The old Surface Phone was apparently part of Nokia’s plans, which may have been scrapped when Panay took charge of the Devices division at Microsoft earlier this year.\nRelated: Everything you need to know about the Lumia 950 and Lumia 950XL\nThe phone was previously referred to as the ‘Panos Phone’ according to Windows Central’s sources, though it has recently changed to becoming the Surface Phone, hinting it may have shifted from a pet project to something more official. Panos Panay is in charge of the team that designed the Surface Pro 4 and Surface Book , meaning we may see a smartphone with a similar design.\nMicrosoft Surface Book More Bill Roberson/Digital Trends\nRumors have spread about a Surface phone for years. In a WIRED profile on Microsoft’s Head of Devices Panos Panay last year, it’s mentioned that work was going ahead on, “a prototype of a new phone” at Microsoft’s HQ, indicating the firm is testing its own phones built internally. For now though, none of this is official, and everything could change again between now and the possible early 2017 release.\nOnly concepts give us a clue about design Unfortunately, we have no idea what any Surface Mobile phone will look like, but concept renders were created by Nadir Aslam earlier this year. While the final Surface Mobile phone might not look like these renders, they give us a good idea of its possible productivity attributes.\nThe Surface Phone remains far from official, but we’ll keep you updated here with news and rumors about the device.\nArticle originally published in November 2015.

      "text": "Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, center, answers a question from the audience at the annual Microsoft shareholders meeting Wednesday in Bellevue. (Elaine Thompson / Associated Press)   2:53 P.M. Microsoft cheers year of ‘solid progress’ at shareholders meeting By Matt Day Seattle Times Twitter \nSEATTLE – Microsoft executives struck an upbeat tone at the company’s annual shareholders meeting on Wednesday, touting signs of success in the company’s campaign to remain relevant in a fast-changing technology world with a new generation of software tools. \n“This last year has been a year of solid progress at Microsoft,” Chief Executive Satya Nadella said at the event, attended by a few hundred shareholders and company officials. \nIn contrast to the era in which many shareholder questions circled Microsoft’s stagnant stock price, the company, headquartered outside Seattle, is set to end 2016 on a high note. \nMicrosoft’s share price is hovering near all-time highs, aided by growth in the company’s cloud-computing units. Shareholder-friendly policies, including billions of dollars paid out annually in dividends and share buybacks, have also helped buoy shares. \nShareholders voiced their approval of the company’s direction in their near unanimous re-election of the board of directors. Microsoft’s slate of board of directors candidates were all approved with more than 98 percent of votes cast. \nThe board’s composition last changed a year ago with the appointment of Johnson & Johnson executive Sandra Peterson, and a former Cisco executive, Padmasree Warrior. \nThe addition of two women to the board, replacing the retiring Maria Klawe, made Microsoft’s directors a bit more diverse. But the company as a whole hasn’t fared as well, recently reporting a second consecutive annual decline in the portion of women employed by the company, and muted gains in the share of underrepresented minorities. \nNadella said the company had been bringing in more diverse classes of university graduates recently, “but we need to do more, both at Microsoft and across our industry.” \nShareholders also voiced approval for Microsoft’s evolving executive compensation practices, a break from past years. The company said 95 percent of shareholder votes were to approve the symbolic advisory vote on executive pay. \nIn each of the past two years, shareholders delivered Microsoft a rebuke on the company’s pay practices, which critics said included too many giant stock grants and were only loosely connected to the company’s performance. Those grants included a giant package, valued by an independent shareholder advisory firm at more than $90 million, to Nadella after he was named CEO in 2014. \nSince then, Microsoft has moved to tie more of executives’ pay to Microsoft’s business goals and financial performance. \nAbsent from the room on Wednesday were Bill Gates, Microsoft’s co-founder and current board member, and Steve Ballmer, the ex-CEO who remains a major shareholder. Technology news site GeekWire reported that both had prior commitments preventing them from attending.   2:53 p.m.",

As part of the partnership, Microsoft will become the Official Technological Partner of LaLagia as well. Using Microsoft’s artificial intelligence and cloud services, LaLagia will apparently be able to identify demand for a certain game, or a specific online content. Pilar López, the President of Microsoft Ibérica stated:\n“ Our partnership with LaLiga is going to lead to a major new wave of innovation in the sports industry, revolutionizing the way in which supporters relate to clubs and players, and radically transforming the management model of the sports organizations themselves,”\nAccording to the official press release from LaLagia, Microsoft’s cloud services: Azure, Office 365 and Dynamics 365 will play a “key role” in the “digital transformation” of LaLagia — which will be using Microsoft’s cloud services to reach more than 1.2 billion users.\nLaLagia will mostly be using Microsoft Azure to power the new experiences, which, according to LaLagia, guarantees the “flexibility and scalability needed to deliver an optimal user experience to the 1.6 billion”. In addition to the new digital experiences, Microsoft and LaLagia will work together to extend the new innovations to other organizations in the football industries, including the different football clubs.",

The studio originally said it wanted to keep the two versions of Gears of War 4 separate, but now it’s attempting to unify the Xbox Anywhere experience. Gears of War 4 was one of the first games to launch as an Xbox Anywhere title, which means that players can buy it once on Windows 10 and own it for both PC and Xbox One.\n“Crossplay is divisive in any Versus experience, and Gears of War 4 is no different,” The Coalition community manager Liam “Octus” Ashley wrote in a blog post . “From the beginning, we stated our intention to keep both platforms separate in non-cooperative game modes in order to preserve competitive balance. Conserving a fair, competitive environment remains a top priority for us.”\nThe problem, of course, is that players on Xbox One are using a gamepad and some people on PC are using a mouse and keyboard. That could introduce a disparity in capabilities because a mouse typically has much better precision and reliability than a stick you control with your thumb. To find a balance between the two platforms, The Coalition plans to use this weekend’s test to collect data and feedback.\n“What comes next after this hasn’t been decided,” wrote Ashley. “This weekend is an incredibly important first step in this process. Once we use the combination of our data and your feedback together, we’ll be able to make an informed next step (or not — as the case may be). The key thing we want to stress is that we won’t be making any surprise changes all of a sudden based on this weekend.”\nTo participate in the trial, hop online on either Xbox One or PC and look for the Crossplay game type.\n",

He will be reporting to Frati at Slack once he joins the company in January. \nBoth Slack and Dropbox declined to comment on this story. Stiff competition \nKevin Egan LinkedIn \nThe move comes just as Slack faces stiffer competition from the likes of Microsoft, Facebook, and Atlassian. \nMicrosoft just launched a Slack-like messaging app called Teams last month, while Facebook came out with its own workplace service in October . Atlassian, the maker of another business messaging app HipChat, went public last year. \nEgan's hiring should help Slack better-position itself in selling to the bigger enterprise companies. Although Slack likes to brag about its growth without a dedicated sales team, it's nearly impossible to sign big contracts unless you have direct salespeople on your team. \nIt's also a signal that Slack's long-awaited enterprise product may be getting closer to launching. The enterprise version of the service has been in development for two years, and is being tested among some large customers. But there have some question marks around its status and Slack's homepage still says its enterprise product is \"coming soon.\" \nSlack has over a million paid users and over four million daily active users. It said it's on track to generate $100 million in annual recurring revenue this year . \nIt's unclear what exactly made Egan want to leave Dropbox. But according to an article by The Information last year, Egan was demoted to a smaller role after the hirings of COO Dennis Woodside and global VP of revenue Thomas Hansen, as the company shied away from traditional enterprise sales tactics for a more reseller-focused approach.",

      "text": "Microsoft Garage , the company’s platform to let their employees experiment in creating different apps and programs, has given us some pretty great products like Arrow Launcher, Next Lock Screen, Sprightly, etc. They’re now bringing to life another new project which helps users who love to clip and share various content from different installed apps on their device. Clip Layer lets you easily manage those content and do with them whatever needs to be done. It is now available for your Android devices.\nThere are a lot of times when you see something on the current app you’re using, whether it’s an article or a photo or just a Quote: , and you’d want to share it with a friend or a colleague. But not all apps lets you copy something from there and then paste it onto a messaging app, an email, or whatever. What Clip Layer does is apply a universal overlay on your screen, whether you’re on a browser or an app, and then makes it easy for you to select that “snippet of information” copy it on your clipboard and then share it either on your Wunderlist app, your email app, or any other app installed in your device.\nLike many of the Microsoft Garage projects, this started out with one employee noticing that they needed to create something because there is a problem with the current system. Steve Won, a senior designer with the Office team, said that he liked to share the things he comes across on various apps but there wasn’t an easy way to do it across all the apps. And so Clip Layer was born out of that observation.\nThis is actually Won’s second Microsoft Garage project, the first one being Hub Keyboard which gives you more functionalities for your device keyboard, rather than just for typing. You can download Clip Layer from the Google Play Store for free.\nSOURCE: Microsoft",

      "text": "Reverse engineer and analyst, Jakub Kroustek, recently discovered a new Microsoft scam that ties in a twist of ransomware. Vindows Locker is a support scam that locks your files, like ransomware, until a payment of $349.99 is received.\nAlong with the payment demand, a phone number is provided. If users call the phone number, they will be connected with a “support member” claiming to be from Microsoft. But, of course they are not affiliated with Microsoft. The intent of the phone call is to gather personal information from the PC user, as well as financial information.\nFortunately for those infected, these cyber criminals were sloppy. Meaning, decryption keys are available for all locked files. The decryption keys can be found here .\n  \nThe post Microsoft Support Scam Ties in Ransomware to Boost Profits appeared first on PC Pitstop TechTalk .\nRelated posts:\nHow to Combat Microsoft Tech Support Scam Calls Practical and creative ways to deal with Microsoft Tech...

      "text": "[caption id=\"attachment_37542\" align=\"\" width=\"640\"] Designs by Nick DeSantis, Forbes staff[/caption]For the new JUST 100 List of America’s Best Corporate Citizens, Forbes partnered with Paul Tudor Jones’ Just Capital to identify the companies in each industry that excel at serving all stakeholders, beyond just the bottom line. The doctrine of maximizing shareholder return has become religion in most of Corporate America’s C-suites over the last half century or so, but the companies we highlight have found a way to deliver strong investor returns without giving short shrift to employees, customers, suppliers and the environment.The JUST 100 List scores companies on a variety of components that feed into 10 drivers of corporate integrity, and 32 companies were named the leaders in their particular industry. Here’s what 8 of those CEOs had to say about how and why they act as good corporate citizens. Among Ford Motor’s community outreach efforts: a Thirty Under 30 program that connects tech-minded millennial employees with nonprofits. Eastman Chemical partners with societies for women and minority engineers; it also supports employees who serve in the armed forces, making up pay differences while reservists are on active duty. NVIDIA doesn’t just win high marks for favorable worker perks like generous vacation time, it also stands out for limiting its environmental impact in an industry not known for being especially green. Varian Medical Systems makes devices that help treat cancer patients, so it’s a natural fit for mission-driven employees with a charitable mindset, but the company also has an eye on sustainability. It plans to divert 80% of solid waste from landfills by 2020. Colgate-Palmolive accounts for 40% of the toothpaste tubes sold in the world, so it’s little surprise that it targets dentistry for corporate philanthropy efforts. It has provided free dental screenings for 850 million children in 80 countries. Accenture PLC expects 40% of its North American new hires in 2017 will be women, and almost half of its workforce are minorities. The company held a company-wide town hall in July to discuss race amid the ongoing dialogue over police shootings, Discovery Communications provides 12 weeks of paid family leave, reimbursement for adoption and surrogacy services and has an on-site health and wellness center to keep employees happy and productive. Microsoft gets high marks for worker treatment and diversity, and Nadella particularly cares about enhancing opportunities for underserved groups. One unique effort is a hiring program for people with autism.",

      "title": "Microsoft Just Made Selecting Text on Android Easier Than Google Ever Has",
      "text": "16 minutes ago Microsoft Just Made Selecting Text on Android Easier Than Google Ever Has \nSelecting text on a touchscreen device has always been a major pain point. Those tiny little arrows that let you adjust the selection area are always too hard to actually adjust, making precision all but impossible. Then there's the issue of some apps not even allowing text selection in the first place, so the entire experience is basically a big mess. \nGoogle has never been able to get this interface right, but amazingly enough, Microsoft may have finally solved Android's text selection woes with a new app from their Garage team . It makes text selection as easy as tapping the words on your screen, and it even works with apps that don't normally let you select words. Step 1: Install Clip Layer \nTo try this one out, start by installing Microsoft's latest Android app below. Install Clip Layer for free from the Google Play Store Step 2: Set Clip Layer as Your Default Assist App \nFor Clip Layer to work its magic, it will need to replace your existing long-press home button gesture. With devices running Android Marshmallow or higher, this gesture is now referred to as the \"Assist app.\" \nSo open Clip Layer, then tap the first button on the main menu. From here, you'll be taken to a system settings menu, so choose the \"Assist app\" (or \"Device assistance app\" on older versions) from the list. \nNext, make sure the \"Use text from screen\" option is enabled, then tap the \"Assist app\" entry at the top of this menu. Finally, select \"Clip Layer\" from the list, then press \"Agree\" when prompted. Step 3: Easily Copy Any Text \nFrom now on, whenever you want to copy some text on any screen, long-press your home button, then you'll see the Clip Layer interface. From here, just tap any words on the screen to select them. (Tip: you can tap multiple words, and they'll be selected in sequential order). \nWhen you're done selecting words, tap one of the buttons on the bottom of the screen to perform an action. Tapping \"Copy\" will simply add the text to your clipboard, \"Task\" lets you add it to a to-do list, \"Email\" lets you send it in a new email, and \"Share\" will open Android's share menu with the text queued up. If you went with \"Copy,\" you can simply paste the text into any field, and you'll notice that all the words you tapped are entered in sequential order automatically. (1) Triggering Clip Layer. (2) Selecting and copying text. (3) Text pasted into Google search. \nIf you frequently use your home button to activate the Google Assistant on your Pixel , or another voice assistant on another Android device, then replacing that with this copy functionality may not be worth the tradeoff. But if you don't use your built-in voice assistant, this could really come in handy if you copy/paste a lot.",

      "text": "(Slack CEO Stewart ButterfieldFlickr/kk) \nSlack has hired Dropbox's Kevin Egan as its new head of North America sales, bringing in a seasoned veteran with over 10 years of enterprise sales experience, a source with knowledge of the matter told Business Insider. \nEgan, who served as Dropbox's head of North America sales for the last four years, is the second high-profile sales hire this year for Slack, the $3.8 billion startup best known for its viral messaging app.\nEarlier this year, it hired away Robert Frati from Salesforce as its first sales chief, after relying mostly on word-of-mouth without a big sales team to achieve its rocketship growth during its early years.\nPrior to Dropbox, Egan worked at Salesforce for over 10 years in various sales positions. He will be reporting to Frati at Slack once he joins the company in January.\nBoth Slack and Dropbox declined to comment on this story.\nStiff competition (Kevin EganLinkedIn) \nThe move comes just as Slack faces stiffer competition from the likes of Microsoft, Facebook, and Atlassian. \nMicrosoft just launched a Slack-like messaging app called Teams last month, while Facebook came out with its own workplace service in October . Atlassian, the maker of another business messaging app HipChat, went public last year.\nEgan's hiring should help Slack better-position itself in selling to the bigger enterprise companies. Although Slack likes to brag about its growth without a dedicated sales team, it's nearly impossible to sign big contracts unless you have direct salespeople on your team.\nIt's also a signal that Slack's long-awaited enterprise product may be getting closer to launching. The enterprise version of the service has been in development for two years, and is being tested among some large customers. But there have some question marks around its status and Slack's homepage still says its enterprise product is \"coming soon.\"\nSlack has over a million paid users and over four million daily active users. It said it's on track to generate $100 million in annual recurring revenue this year .\nIt's unclear what exactly made Egan want to leave Dropbox. But according to an article by The Information last year, Egan was demoted to a smaller role after the hirings of COO Dennis Woodside and global VP of revenue Thomas Hansen, as the company shied away from traditional enterprise sales tactics for a more reseller-focused approach.\nNOW WATCH: JACK DANIEL’S MASTER DISTILLER: This is the real difference between scotch, whiskey, and bourbon \n\nMore From Business Insider \nHow Amazon snatched huge customer Motorola away from Microsoft \nAmazon's cloud boss: AWS could become 'the largest part' of Amazon's $100+ billion business \nAmazon's cloud boss Andy Jassy just slammed Larry Ellison and mocked his 'hand-waving and bombast'",

The word document contains both portrait and landscape views, so the margins will need to be done manually as word does not do mirror margins automatically for different views. Margins must be done in word as the table of contents must be correct before converting to PDF. Skills Required",

      "text": "Skyport Systems Secures Environments for Administrators to Protect Against Microsoft® Active Directory Threats [November 30, 2016] Tweet \nSkyport Systems, a leading secure hyper-converged infrastructure provider for the hybrid enterprise, today announced the Skyport SkySecure virtual Secure Administrative Workstation (vSAW) solution. \nSkySecure's vSAW solution makes it easy for organizations to quickly lock down the security of the Microsoft ( News - Alert ) Active Directory (AD) administrative environment by acting as a barrier that prevents theft of privileged credentials and protects domain controllers from malware due to compromised administrative workstations. SkySecure vSAW is an effective step to improving the security of an organization's Active Directory (AD) environment while adhering to Microsoft's proven guidelines. \n\"To stay ahead of the bad guys, enterprises must be vigilant about the most vulnerable access points in their IT environments. Most organizations have not implemented effective counter-measures to safeguard against the wide variety of customized attacks tools that are designed to make it easy to breach Active Directory environments,\" said Michael Beesley, Chief Technology Officer and Co-Founder of Skyport Systems. \"SkySecure vSAW ensures the security of the Active Directory environment cannot be defeated through several factors, including providing a secure environment for the administrator and keeping privileged credentials from being stored on insecure workstations.\" \nHackers and penetration testing teams frequently target and breach Active Directory administrator credentials and workstations because this allows them to unlock every piece of the IT infrastructure, including user accounts, data, applications, computers, storage and the network. Once administrator's credentials are stolen, breaches can stay undetected for months. \nIn fact, red team pen testers claim nearly a 100 percent success rate when they are hired to break into an organiztion's Active Directory infrastructure. According to a 2015 Verizon ( News - Alert ) security report, 75 percent of all breaches involved the loss or theft of privileged credentials, demonstrating the importance of improving Active Directory and credential security. \nSkySecure vSAW uses SkySecure's hyper-converged architecture with security built in to deliver a clean source, malware-free environment out-of-the box to make certain privileged credentials are not susceptible to tampering or theft. Combining secure compute, virtualization, network security controls and integrated threat analytics, SkySecure vSAW is easy to deploy and manage, eliminating the time and complexity of building and maintaining a secure administrative workstation from scratch. \nSkySecure vSAW is cloud-managed, alleviating many of the management responsibilities of the system and security software updates while providing complete visibility into all traffic and policies to prove they are effective and working. \nResources \nLearn more about Skyport Secure Administrative Workstation for Microsoft Active Directory and The Skyport Active Directory Assessment program \nAbout Skyport Systems \nSkyport Systems helps innovative companies gain the control and confidence to securely run their critical applications. The company offers the award-winning SkySecure, the industry's first hyper-converged system that simplifies the deployment, management and security of today's complex data center.

      "title": "Deploy Windows 10 Using MDT and WDS, Part 1: Create an MDT Deployment Share",
      "text": "\nIn the first part of this three-part series, I’ll show you how to deploy the Microsoft Deployment Toolkit (MDT) and import a Windows 10 image ready for distribution over the network using Windows Deployment Services (WDS).\nIf you need to deploy Windows 10 on more than a handful of devices, or redeploy the OS regularly, then Windows Server WDS may be the solution you’re looking for. WDS provides a subset of the deployment features found in System Center Configuration Manager (SCCM), but doesn’t have the targeting, zero-touch installation and thin imaging options found in SCCM.\n \n \nMDT and WDS are two separate tools that can be used together or individually. MDT is a free download from Microsoft, and allows system administrators to quickly customize Windows 10 images using a wizard-based approach to include line-of-business applications and device drivers. MDT also provides options for migrating user settings and backing up the currently installed OS at install time, courtesy of tools from the Windows Assessment and Deployment Kit (ADK).\nWDS is a feature of Windows Server, and when used alone, can be used to install full Windows 10 images across the network to PXE-boot capable devices. But in conjunction with MDT, WDS becomes a more powerful tool, allowing administrators to tailor installations and deployment options.\nPreboot eXecution Environment (PXE) enabled network cards can retrieve boot images from the network with the help of DHCP and TFTP. If you are using Hyper-V, only generation 2 virtual machines (VMs) support PXE. Physical machines need to have network cards that support PXE, and PXE boot should be enabled in the BIOS/UEFI.\nLab Prerequisites In this lab, I use the following servers and devices, all running in Hyper-V VMs:\nWindows Server 2016 domain controller Windows Server 2012 R2 MDT Windows Server 2012 R2 WDS Hyper-V Generation 2 VM with PXE boot support (for Windows 10) WDS doesn’t require Active Directory (AD), but to make life easier, I decided to use it for the purposes of this lab. I have one domain controller (DC) running Windows Server 2016. The DC also provides DNS and DHCP services. DHCP is required for WDS, and shouldn’t be running on the same server as the WDS server role.\nMDT and WDS will be installed on separate servers, both running Windows Server 2012 R2, but could be installed on the same server. Finally, a bare metal Hyper-V generation 2 VM was used to install Windows 10 using WDS.\nBefore following the instructions below, you should have an AD domain already set up and configured, including the DHCP server role authorized in AD. For more information on installing AD on Windows Server, see Install Active Directory on Windows Server 2012 with Server Manager on the Petri IT Knowledgebase . The MDT and WDS servers should be joined to your domain. See Joining Windows Server 2012 to a Domain on the Petri IT Knowledgebase for more details.\nInstall the Microsoft Deployment Toolkit First, we need to download and install Microsoft Deployment Toolkit (MDT) 2013 Update 2 . Execute the downloaded Windows Installer (.msi) file and follow the instructions. The Windows Assessment and Deployment Kit (Windows ADK) for Windows 10, version 1607 should also be installed on the MDT server. Run adksetup.exe and install it. On the Select the features you want to install screen, check Deployment Tools , Windows Preinstallation Environment (Windows PE) , and User State Migration Tool (USMT) .\nInstall Windows ADK on the MDT server (Image Credit: Russell Smith)\nDownload the Windows 10 Enterprise ISO evaluation from Microsoft’s website here . Or you can use any Professional or Enterprise SKU ISO, providing it wasn’t downloaded using the media creation tool. Once the ISO has downloaded on the MDT server, you’ll need to mount it. Right-click the ISO file in Explorer and select Mount from the menu. The ISO will be mounted to a virtual DVD drive in Windows.\nSponsored Create a Deployment Share in MDT Now let’s start the real work with MDT. WDS uses a boot image that points clients to an MDT deployment share containing our customized Windows 10 installation files. We will use the MDT Deployment Workbench management console (MMC) to create a deployment share on the server.\nLog in to Windows Server with a domain account that also has local administrator permissions. Click the Start button on the desktop, type workbench , and click Deployment Workbench in the search results on the right. In the Deployment Workbench MMC, right-click Deployment Shares and select New Deployment Share from the menu. In the New Deployment Share Wizard , click Next on the Path screen to accept the default share location (C:\\DeploymentShare). Likewise, on the Share screen, click Next to accept the default share name (DeploymentShare$). Click Next on the Descriptive Name screen to accept the default description (MDT Deployment Share). On the Options screen, click Next to accept the default options, or optionally you can choose to prompt for a product key and set a local administrator password during Windows 10 deployment. Default options for an MDT deployment share (Image Credit: Russell Smith)\nClick Next on the Summary screen. Click Finish on the Confirmation screen. Press WIN + E to open Windows Explorer. Make sure that This PC is selected on the left, and then double-click Local Disk (C:) . Right-click the DeploymentShare folder and select Properties from the menu. In the Properties dialog box, switch to the Sharing tab. On the Sharing tab, click Advanced Sharing . In the Advanced Sharing dialog box, click Permissions . In the Permissions dialog box, click Add… In the Select Users, Computers, Service Accounts, or Groups dialog, type Everyone under Enter the object names to select , and then click OK . In the Permissions dialog box, make sure that Everyone is selected and that Read is checked in the Allow column. Click OK to finish. Click OK in the Advanced Sharing dialog box and Close in the Properties dialog box. Modify the share permissions on the MDT deployment share (Image Credit: Russell Smith)\nImport an Operating System ISO The next step is to import the Windows 10 ISO into MDT.\nIn the Deployment Workbench MMC, expand the new deployment share in the left pane, right-click Operating Systems and select Import Operating System from the menu. On the Import Operating System Wizard screen, select Full set of source files and click Next . Import an OS image into the MDT Deployment Workbench (Image Credit: Russell Smith)\nOn the Source screen, click Browse . In the Browse For Folder dialog box, expand This PC , select the DVD drive with the mounted Windows 10 ISO image, and click OK . Click Next on the Source screen. On the Destination screen, accept the default directory name (Windows 10 Enterprise Evaluation x64) by clicking Next . Click Next on the Summary screen. Wait for the OS files to be imported and then click Finish . Sponsored In this article, I showed you how to create an MDT deployment share and import a Windows 10 image into Deployment Workbench. In the second part of this series, I’ll show you how to customize the Windows 10 image in MDT using a task sequence, and how to configure WDS.\nThe post Deploy Windows 10 Using MDT and WDS, Part 1: Create an MDT Deployment Share appeared first on Petri .\n",

      "text": "SEATTLE -- Microsoft executives struck an upbeat tone at the company's annual shareholders meeting on Wednesday, touting signs of success in the company's campaign to remain relevant in a fast-changing technology world with a new generation of software tools.\n\"This last year has been a year of solid progress at Microsoft,\" Chief Executive Satya Nadella said at the event, attended by a few hundred shareholders and company officials.\nIn contrast to the era in which many shareholder questions circled Microsoft's stagnant stock price, the company, headquartered outside Seattle, is set to end 2016 on a high note.\nMicrosoft's share price is hovering near all-time highs, aided by growth in the company's cloud-computing units. Shareholder-friendly policies, including billions of dollars paid out annually in dividends and share buybacks, have also helped buoy shares.\nShareholders voiced their approval of the company's direction in their near unanimous re-election of the board of directors. Microsoft's slate of board of directors candidates were all approved with more than 98 percent of votes cast.\nThe board's composition last changed a year ago with the appointment of Johnson & Johnson executive Sandra Peterson, and a former Cisco executive, Padmasree Warrior.\nThe addition of two women to the board, replacing the retiring Maria Klawe, made Microsoft's directors a bit more diverse. But the company as a whole hasn't fared as well, recently reporting a second consecutive annual decline in the portion of women employed by the company, and muted gains in the share of underrepresented minorities.\nNadella said the company had been bringing in more diverse classes of university graduates recently, \"but we need to do more, both at Microsoft and across our industry.\"\nShareholders also voiced approval for Microsoft's evolving executive compensation practices, a break from past years. The company said 95 percent of shareholder votes were to approve the symbolic advisory vote on executive pay.\nIn each of the past two years, shareholders delivered Microsoft a rebuke on the company's pay practices, which critics said included too many giant stock grants and were only loosely connected to the company's performance. Those grants included a giant package, valued by an independent shareholder advisory firm at more than $90 million, to Nadella after he was named CEO in 2014.\nSince then, Microsoft has moved to tie more of executives' pay to Microsoft's business goals and financial performance.\nAbsent from the room on Wednesday were Bill Gates, Microsoft's co-founder and current board member, and Steve Ballmer, the ex-CEO who remains a major shareholder. Technology news site GeekWire reported that both had prior commitments preventing them from attending.\n(c)2016 The Seattle Times\nVisit The Seattle Times at www.seattletimes.com\nDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.\nShare Comment",

      "text": "The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion highlights the latest list of games that Microsoft has made backwards compatible on the Xbox One. If you’ve already partied around in Skyrim a little too much for your own good, why not take a step or two back and see the game that made open-world fantasies the norm during the previous generation?\nIt might be older, but Oblivion still provides plenty of adventure. It’s more than just a source of horse armor ridicule.\nOblivion is joined by Trine 2, Medal of Honor: Airborne, and Astropop , for a total of four games in this update and a grand total of 295 backwards compatible games . That sure is a lot. I had no idea Microsoft was going to take it this far before pulling the plug.\nMicrosoft has been doing a wonderful job, but we’re not 100 percent yet It seems that with each passing announcement, someone in the world has something to be happy about. Even though I don’t own an Xbox One yet, I’ve been impressed at the rate that Microsoft is cranking these updates out, especially after it took me forever to play Panzer Dragoon Orta on my Xbox 360 all those years ago.\nOf course, everyone still has their niche games they want to see make the leap. I always push for Guardian Heroes HD , and if we continue at this rate, I wouldn’t be surprised if we saw it in the near future.\nHow about you? What are your niche desires that need attention on the backwards compatibility front?\n\n\nSource : Xbox ",
