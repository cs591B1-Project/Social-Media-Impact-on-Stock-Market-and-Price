      "text": "International Business Machines Corporation ( IBM - Free Report ) has announced the completion of its acquisition of Promontory Financial Group, a leading risk management and regulatory compliance consulting firm.\nWhat Led to the Acquisition?\nToday, financial regulations and risk management requirements are changing rapidly. These demand substantial operational efforts and costs to keep pace with. With Promontory’s expertise in the aforementioned field, the acquisition is likely to strengthen IBM’s capabilities going ahead. Additionally, with Watson that is equipped with cognitive capabilities, IBM will be able to speed up its development of cognitive solutions for compliance and risk management.\nINTL BUS MACH Price\nINTL BUS MACH Price | INTL BUS MACH Quote:\nWhat Does this Mean for IBM?\nThe Promontory acquisition will complement the Industry Platforms business of IBM, which has been created to offer “as a service” offerings custom built for individual industries. We note that, this will combine the benefits of the IBM Cloud, Watson and industry specific capabilities of specialized providers to achieve enhanced efficiency, security, quality and transparency while lowering operational costs.\nIn other words, IBM is trying to strengthen its presence in the cloud business that is gathering steam with every passing day.\nAs per an IDC report, worldwide spending on cognitive systems is estimated to reach over $31 billion by 2019 growing at a CAGR of 55%.

      "text": "HRG Assessment: IBM’s eServers Updated on November 23, 2016 HARVARD RESEARCH GROUP \nIn the fall of 2000 IBM reintroduced its full line of servers as the eServer series. In addition to Linux compatibility, eServers now promise a lower Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) for traditionally expensive systems, and incorporate the following significant new features: New tools for managing e-business--capacity and performance growth on demand, system availability, management, solution compatibility and financing. Application flexibility--fully tested solutions can be deployed on the platform which best meets customer need for performance, availability and cost. Innovative technology--deploy Linux applications on xSeries Intel servers, iSeries, pSeries or on zSeries mainframes depending on customer requirements. \nIn addition to running their traditional operating systems, eServers run Linux across the entire line \"from x to z.\" Recently the Linux community has applauded IBM's efforts. Microsoft has launched a massive disinformation campaign against the open source community. \nWith the introduction of the eServer series IBM demonstrates that: It is possible to diminish the risks of adopting Linux; Servers are entering the realm of commodities, leaving the availability of middleware and customer service as crucial differentiating factors among hardware vendors; To be competitive, any new server technology must lower the TCO of running enterprise level, business-critical applications \nThe eServer series and the tools that go with it, represent, in HRG's opinion, the push that IBM needs to reassert its leadership in the server market. eServers and Linux \nLinux, last year, grew faster than Microsoft Windows and all other types of UNIX combined. IBM has eagerly embraced the inevitable, choosing to control its fate rather than succumb to it. All eSeries servers can now run the Linux operating system. Table 1 outlines the new names and Linux capabilities of each line of eServers. \nTable 1. eSeries Servers Names and Linux Capabilities \nOld Name \nRuns Linux native in LPAR or as z/VM guest \nAS400 \nRuns i/OS with Linux Guest \nRS6000 \nRuns Linux Native Things to consider \nLinux is an open-source operating system. Thousands of Linux compatible software packages can be found on the web, free, or at a very minimal cost. Software vendors fear the erosion of margins as customers turn to cheaper, or free, Linux alternatives. For companies, such as Oracle and SAP, that make complex enterprise-wide packages, software margins are not much of an issue when the majority of revenue generated is from installation and consulting services. It is the plug-and-play software vendors, whose packages require no additional product installation and maintenance services, that have the most to fear from the proliferation of Linux. This is in large part why Microsoft is actively casting doubt on the commercial readiness of Linux. \nLinux based software is inexpensive, in many cases free, and compatible with more hardware platforms than any operating system ever developed. Using Linux, IT departments can now easily and inexpensively run application solution software across a range of previously incompatible hardware platforms. Ultimately this new-found openness will serve to facilitate migration from one platform to another. The costs of switching, and porting applications from installed platforms to new hardware platforms will be significantly reduced. Linux has transformed the server market from closed and proprietary into a truly open marketplace where any company is a potential customer regardless of its installed hardware technology. Linux may well signal the final phase in the evolution of the server from a unique and proprietary system, to a commodity. With server prices expected to fall significantly in the race to win and retain customers, IBM will undoubtedly see significant cuts in profits from hardware, which HRG believes can be offset by an increase in more profitable professional services revenue. The Benefits of Linux \nThe wide spread use of Linux is driving the IT community toward the definition of a common set of industry-wide standards. In a prescient move, IBM is already actively involved in defining these standards. Additionally, IBM heads up the Linux Standards Base (LSB) - a Linux standards body, and is a member of UDDI (Universal Description, Discovery and Integration). IBM's significant Linux expertise and rich IT history are likely to secure a significant long term role for IBM in defining and proliferating these standards. \nLinux has opened the door for IBM to enter markets that previously were not easily accessible, given the entrenched view that IBM has traditionally been a proprietary systems vendor. IBM is actively working with major universities who have already enthusiastically embraced Linux. The significance of IBM's acceptance by the Linux community at large should not be underestimated. The reason for this broad-reaching acceptance, says IBM, is that they are \"…part of the Linux community, playing by the rules, and genuinely contributing to, and not manipulating, its development.\" IBM has earned the respect of the Linux community, and it is playing a leading role in the community’s standards setting activities. \nIBM's adoption of Linux is a clear sign that IBM is determined to meet the IT challenges of the future. If Linux and other open operating systems become the standard, IBM is well positioned to manage most competitive onslaughts against it's more traditional legacy products, while other vendors scramble to figure out a Linux and open systems strategy that makes sense. In a world where companies are wary of entering into proprietary relationships with vendors, customers appreciate IBM's new openness and flexibility. The Linux Community Gains \neServers provide the Linux community with access to IBM's highly available and highly secure servers. True commercial strength security can only be realized on IBM's z/OS (formerly OS/390) and does not presently extend to the Linux applications running on a Linux partition. Additionally, open source users can take advantage of the zSeries's z/VM operating system that runs within a Logical Partition, or runs native on the zSeries hardware. IBM's z/VM enables multiple operating systems to run side by side on one incredibly powerful server. The amount of server space given to each \"OS\" or partition is very flexible. With z/VM, customers can run from one to hundreds of Linux images on one platform, allowing system resources to be shared easily, streamlining management, and providing for scalability. IBM has even gone so far as to set up free access to a mainframe for anyone working with the Linux operating system. Over the web, one thousand users at a time can work with one of the most powerful mainframes on the market. \nNo comments yet. \nSign in or sign up and post using a HubPages Network account. 0 of 8192 characters used No HTML is allowed in comments, but URLs will be hyperlinked.

      "text": "Yet to open a Sharekhan Account? Cyrus Mistry's claim on planned sale of TCS to IBM at some unspecified point in time not correct: Kohli Snubbed Mistry maintains sale plan was Ratan Tata's, not Tata Group's; former Tata Steel honcho B Muthuraman also rebuts Mistry charges on Corus buy Snubbed Mistry maintains sale plan was Ratan Tata's, not Tata Group's; former Tata Steel honcho B Muthuraman also rebuts Mistry charges on Corus buy F C Kohli, the 92-year-old former chief executive and deputy chairman of Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), has debunked the charges made by ousted Tata Sons chairman Cyrus Mistry that his predecessor Ratan Tata wanted to put on block India’s largest technology services company. “Cyrus Mistry’s comments regarding the sale of TCS to IBM at some ‘unspecified point in time’ are not correct. I was actively involved in the decision to bring IBM to India. A joint venture (JV) for hardware manufacturing and support in India, Tata IBM, was set up in 1991-92. This JV was undertaken to promote the computer hardware industry in India, which was non-existent at that time,” Kohli said on Wednesday. “At no point in time was there ever an intention of the Tata Group to sell TCS to IBM,” Kohli’s statement added. Reacting to this, Mistry said did not want to join issue with Kohli, who built TCS as India’s largest software exporter, but maintained that it was Ratan Tata’s intent and not of the Tata Group to sell the software company to IBM. “The statement Mr Mistry made was based on information from sources who were close to J R D Tata, who informed him that it was Ratan Tata’s intention, and not the group’s intention, to sell TCS,” Mistry’s office issued a statement after Kohli debunked the ousted chairman’s claim. On Tuesday, Mistry, who is waging a war of words with Ratan Tata after his ouster as chairman of Tata Sons, had said that Ratan Tata, who was then heading a joint venture of Tata Industries with IBM, had approached J R D Tata with a proposal from IBM to buy out TCS when Kohli was hospitalised with a cardiac condition. Kohli, known as the father of India’s technology services revolution, built the technology arm of the Tatas by delivering services to firms such as American Express before the industry took off as a major job generator for India after the Y2K boom in the late 1990s. Kohli clarified that J R D Tata had waited for his return from Houston after his bypass surgery in 1984 to discuss Burroughs’ proposal for software work in India under Tata Burroughs, “which might affect TCS’ business”. Burroughs, a US computer maker, was later sold to Unisys. The Tata Burroughs JV merged with Tata Infotech, which eventually merged with TCS in 2005. IBM’s partnership with the Tatas paved the way for its re-entry into India, which it had left in 1977, cement its business in the country and branch out as an independent entity. Mistry also blamed the group’s decision to acquire British steel company Corus for around $12 billion in 2007 when only a year earlier it was available at half that price. Defending the move, B Muthuraman, former vice-chairman and managing director of Tata Steel, said in a statement the allegations were “frivolous and unconsidered”. He said the long-term strategy of Tata Steel was to grow through capacity expansion in India and through acquisitions overseas. “The board of Tata Steel was deeply involved in all the deliberations and had approved the transaction. The value of Corus increased since the initial bid in line with the commodity price boom, its underlying performance and the transaction process. The acquisition was through a transparent auction process managed by the takeover regulator in the UK and the acquisition price was £50 million higher than the next bidder,” Muthuraman added. “In the first two years of the acquisition, Corus had an average annual Ebitda (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) of over £1 billion, which justified the reasonableness of the acquisition,” the statement added. Muthuraman blamed the global financial crisis of 2008 for the adverse impact on the steel industry in Europe, which also affected Corus. Tata Steel also issued a statement stating the acquisition of Corus was based on a long-term strategy. “The performance of Corus Plc post acquisition validated the strategy till the black swan event of the global financial crisis structurally impacted the underlying demand conditions in Europe causing financial hardship to the entire industry. The entire acquisition was undertaken by following due board governance process under the supervision and oversight of the board of the company. The acquisition proposal was extensively deliberated in the board and the board approved the transaction,” it said. Mistry on Wednesday maintained that there were differences and reservations on the Corus deal, even though the company took a unanimous decision to buy the British steel maker. “Mr Mistry did not say that the ultimate decision was not unanimous, but there were differences and reservations significantly, the fact that Corus was available for purchase at half the price in the recent past is undisputed,” Mistry’s office said in a statement.

By: Sudhir Chowdhary | Published: November 24, 2016 6:52 AM Prativa Mohapatra, vice-president, Cognitive Solutions, IBM India/South Asia. \nIBM Watson is a cognitive system enabling a new partnership between people and computers. Today, businesses and organisations across 20 different industries are using Watson to build cognitive capabilities into their products, applications, processes and offerings, says Prativa Mohapatra, vice-president, Cognitive Solutions, IBM India/South Asia. In an interaction with Sudhir Chowdhary, she says organisations have just begun to scratch the surface of cognitive computing capabilities. Excerpts: \nWhat is IBM’s strategy for cognitive computing? \nIn 2016, we took several key steps in our transformation journey because we realise that while ‘becoming digital’ is important for our clients, that is not the destination. Rather, digital business is converging with a new kind of digital intelligence—what you perhaps recognise as Watson. We call this cognitive business. With Watson, every digital application, product and process can understand, reason and learn. Our platform is the cloud and let me reiterate, the word platform is important. Much more than simply a faster and cheaper way to access IT, a cloud platform is a new model of innovation, manufacturing and distribution. \nWhat has been the industry’s response to cognitive computing? \nBusiness and governments are adopting IBM Watson pre-built offerings/products and solutions which have a distinct industry pattern or leveraging IBM Watson Developer Cloud as a platform and appropriate APIs (application programming interfaces) to built point solutions/capabilities. We have ecosystem partners including business partners, start-ups and developers who have adopted this mode and are scaling fast. \nWhile industries such as telecom, financial services, healthcare are early adopters, we also see a lot of interest and applicability across emerging verticals such as fashion retailers, media and entertainment and education. Knowledge-based and services-centric businesses such as consulting, legal, BPOs are also rapidly adopting these technologies. \nOne of the biggest beneficiaries of this technology could be the public and government services. There are volumes of information residing in documents and journals across departments. \nCan you give examples of how they are using cognitive technologies? \nOne example is North Face, it launched a new interactive online shopping experience powered by IBM Watson. Manipal Hospitals has adopted Watson Oncology to identify evidence-based treatment options—helping oncologists to provide cancer patients with individualised healthcare. IBM researchers in South Africa are exploring the use of cognitive computing, Internet of Things and Big Data to support South Africa’s national priorities, drive skills development and foster innovation-based economic growth. \nWhat is the potential for cognitive technology in India? \nThe potential is immense and Indian clients are adopting this technology in a bi-modal way. We are seeing cognitive technologies being embedded into larger organisations as a part of their digital transformation journey. Organisations and institutions grappling with shortage of right skills are adopting new business models using cognitive assistants and advisors. On the other hand, we are also seeing organisations adopt cognitive technologies for specific use cases, applicable to a particular function or business issue. \nHas IBM made any changes internally to be in line with its cognitive strategy? \nIBM is emerging as a cognitive solutions and cloud platform company. In our digital transformation journey, we divested commoditising businesses and have dramatically accelerated the growth of our strategic imperatives—data and analytics, cloud, mobile, social and security—to help our clients become digital. \nAre there any India-specific initiatives around cognitive computing? \nWe have a cognitive solutions team specifically focused on bringing this expertise and technology into the market. We are working with clients across industries to harness our analytics, commerce and IoT solutions and move the clients into various cognitive domains. We also have the Cognitive Centre of Competency here, which has the largest pool of data scientists, architects and cognitive solution consultants who are helping clients globally. \nOur Research and Software Labs continue to engage with core teams to develop and enhance first of its kind projects in this space. We regularly have company-wide Cognitive Build and Hackathon events to harness ideas and hone skills across the company. Please Wait while comments are loading... Trending Now ",

      "text": "The 2016 census was like a house with “a sinking foundation and cracks in the walls” because IBM and its subcontractors are in dispute over the bad build, a Senate committee has said.\nThe Senate economics references committee report into the 2016 census , released on Thursday, found that IBM failed to check the system’s resilience and recommended open tendering be used to award the contract in future.\nBut it said that “the primary responsibility lies with the government” and called on “the current minister, on behalf of the government, to take responsibility”.\nThe review by the prime minister’s special adviser on cyber security, Alastair MacGibbon, also released on Thursday , recommended the Australian Bureau of Statistic (ABS) “strengthen its approach to outsourced ICT supplier performance management to ensure greater oversight and accountability”.\nComputer says no: Australian census shambles explanation depends on who you ask Read more\nThe 2016 census website suffered a 43-hour outage due to a denial of service attack and “systems failure” that led to a decision to take the website down.\nIn the immediate aftermath, the prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, blamed “the failure of systems put in for the [Australian Bureau of Statistics] by IBM”.\nThe Senate committee report noted the ABS opted for a limited tender due to time constraints, which resulted in IBM getting the contract because IBM had delivered the 2006 and 2011 census website systems.\nThe report found IBM relied on a strategy of blocking traffic from outside Australia to prevent denial of service attacks.\nAlthough there was sufficient redundancy in the system to handle denial of service attacks , one of two routers was configured incorrectly and unable to be reset correctly.\nIn its evidence, IBM blamed its subcontractors Nextgen and Vocus for not properly implementing the “Island Australia” system, but they denied being at fault.\nMacGibbon told the committee IBM’s “greatest failure” was that it did not check the system had been implemented correctly by its subcontractors. He likened it to giving blueprints for a house to a builder who “is now in dispute with a plumber and a bricklayer about what was or was not done in relation to the deficient house”.\nCensus 2016: Labor calls on minister to resign over website crash 'shambles' Read more\n“I cannot determine who is right and who is wrong. What I will say is that as the customer the commonwealth was not well served.”\nThe committee did not conclude where the relative truth lay between IBM and its subcontractors, but extended the analogy by saying “the taxpayer has bought a house off the plan with a sinking foundation and cracks in the walls”.\n“They can feel rightly aggrieved,” it concluded.\nThere were “significant and obvious oversights in the preparation of the eCensus”, including IBM’s failure to test a router restart. The committee found the ABS’s funding “has been eroded over a number of years” and the census debacle had required the injection of $30m to fix. It expressed concern the chief statistician role was left unfilled by the ABS for most of 2014.\nThe report recommended the government provide funding for the 2021 census in the 2017-18 budget, and “provide sufficient” funding for the ABS to perform its work to a high standard.\n“The committee recommends that the ABS take a more proactive role in validating the resilience of the eCensus application for the 2021 census,” it said.\nIt also said fines for not completing the census that grow by the day are “unfair” and disproportionate to the harm caused by census non-participation. Instead, “the maximum value of fines and any other penalties relating to the census [should] be explicitly stated”.\nThe committee noted four ministers had responsibility for the census between September 2013 and August 2016, including the current small business minister Michael McCormack. It said the government should provide “portfolio stability” for the ABS.\nAt the time of the census debacle, Turnbull said that “head would roll” although which heads depended on the outcome of reviews.\nCensus 2016: Labor calls on minister to resign over website crash 'shambles' Read more\nIn August some Labor MPs called for McCormack to resign over the census . But after the release of the report a spokesman for shadow assistant treasurer, Andrew Leigh, said he would not call for McCormack, who gained responsibility for the census very shortly before, to resign.\nIn a statement, Leigh said the report detailed “damning evidence ... about how the ABS was underfunded to meet its objectives for the census and that current levels of funding for other ABS functions are inadequate”.\n“An effective government could have delivered the 2016 Census , but the chaos and dysfunction at the heart of the Turnbull government means it mismanages everything it touches,” he said.\nIn a statement, McCormack said there were “lessons to be learned and that improvements are necessary” but more than 96% of households had completed their census.\n“IBM has apologised to the government and the Australian public for the outage on census night,” he said. “The government has reached a commercial-in-confidence settlement with IBM on this matter.”\nIn comments to Guardian Australia, McCormack added that the Senate committee report was “highly partisan and political”.\n“The ABS accepts responsibility for its role in the census outage, and has acknowledged and apologised for its poor judgments.”",

      "title": "IBM’s tripling of UK cloud capabilities tells a long story",
      "text": "0 Comments The news from IBM this week – that it is investing in tripling its cloud service data center capabilities in the UK over the next year – is significant enough in its own right. But in a way it also sets a shadow over a combination of new developments and existing capabilities within the company that are arguably more important for business users. It could be, of course, that IBM is playing that old theatrical trick of shining a single spotlight on ‘the star’ while in the surrounding darkness stage hands are moving in a whole orchestra. And that analogy may be pertinent, for orchestration does look like the goal the company is pitching at. First the news bit The company has announced a tripling of its UK data center capacity, from two six separate sites. According to Helen Kelisky, Vice President of Cloud for IBM UK and Ireland, this is the largest commitment IBM has made, with regard to cloud, to any single country at one point in time. One of the new data centerswill be in Fareham, and one in Farnborough, with the latter located in the Ark Datacentre facility, and targeted towards public sector services provision. There is no word as yet on where the other two might be located. The total number of data centrers in Europe now rises from 12 to 16, while globally it numbers around 50. The market background to this focus on the UK is a digital economy worth more than £118 billion, according to Matt Hancock, Minister of State for Digital and Culture, and cloud adoption by UK businesses rising by 84% according to the Cloud Industry Forum. In the wider world, analyst firm IDC predicts cloud consumption will generate a cloud service revenue of $195 billion by 2020, rising from $20 billion in 2015. Kelisky claims that IBM is the leader in the UK cloud market with more data centrers than any other vendor – when the new ones open next year. The number of data centers does, at first, appear to be on the high side compared to other cloud service providers, but that does assume that apples are being compared with apples. Many of them still focus on the provision of resources, with some infrastructure services and management available on top. This is a good place to shop for those businesses with a strong – and cloud motivated – IT department to provide the development and management of such services. For the service providers, however, that can be market where price competition is fierce and the revenue trend is always tending towards zero. A recent report, ` Equinix And The Unsustainable Issuance Of Debt And Equity To Finance A Barely Profitable Business’, published in the Wall Street observing website, Seeking Alpha, points to the increasingly narrow ledge that such companies can find themselves balanced upon. It is also a potential minefield for businesses without extensive IT expertise on board, and IBM is pitching a number of services at users looking for more help or shortcuts. Two of those services have been used by a recent client win the company is also keen to shout about. This is Thomson Travel, which is about to start trialling a cloud service developed by the company working with the London Bluemix Garage. The ‘Garage’ brand refers to a network of IBM cloud services development consultancies around the world, and the new service is based on the use of IBM’s Watson cognitive processing system, and will allow customers to receive advice and suggestions on holiday destinations based on natural language requests. The initial explanation of the process makes it look as though the same results could be achieved using a web service tick-box model and a relational database. But the advantage with Watson is that the more information it is fed the more it learns about both individual users and groups of users by age, income and other social factors. As the trial progresses Watson will be feeding back to customers, so it does have the capability to make for an increasingly sticky service for Thomson as customers come back with more requests and information. It is possible to see this becoming a predictive holiday identifier, which could make it an attractive prospect, both from the customers’ point of view and for Thomson itself. The marriage of Watson and Blockchain Watson is now increasingly being coupled with expertise from IBM’s long-standing Global Business Services Division to build a growing number of customer-focused, industry-specific platforms. Having played for many years in the same marketplace as the major consultancies such as Accenture and CapGemini, Global Business Services has considerable expertise to draw on across a wide range of industries. This is now being close-coupled with Watson, packaged up and tailored to fit the needs of an industrial sector, and made available as a cloud-service deliverable that is intended to take users a fair way down the road to productive use, rather than leave them to the possibilities of learning both cloud and Watson from the ground up at the same time. Not surprisingly, the early targets will include the traditional low-hanging fruit of healthcare – with the announcement earlier this year of the Adler Hey Children’s Hospital `cognitive hospital’ project being a good example. Other `old favourite’ fruits on the IBM picking list include financial services and retail. IBM has also just launched a new business unit, known as Industry Platforms, which will now start heading up this higher level of targeted services. The appointment of IBM’s Global Business Services boss, Bridget van Kralingen, as its new head suggests the company is putting a fair bit of faith in it as a long-term direction. Former Accenture executive, Mark Foster, has been drafted in to take over from van Kralingen as the head of Global Business Services. In addition to the services of the Bluemix Garages and Watson’s cognitive processing capabilities the new platforms will add Blockchain technologies. This can be used to build highly secure, distributable transaction ledgers that can be used in a wide range of different applications areas. The most obvious, of course, is in financial services so it is no surprise that this area, coupling Blockchain with Watson Financial Services as the basis of targeted service offerings, will be the first one lined up in the IBM sights. My take IBM’s trajectory here highlights one of the key dichotomies growing in the cloud sector. There is an increasingly clear choice for users between low-cost delivery of something in the cloud – which if the user is well-staffed with cloud experience and has some sound planning ready to go can be a good option – and a more expensive but more comprehensive service that allows them to start, and develop, their own cloud experience at a point they understand and makes sense to them. Time will tell, but my guess is that the majority of early cloud adopters fall into the first group – and may well be getting close to being used up. The majority of the rest may well welcome some experienced help, and having six data centers in the UK alone suggests the company expects high demand. \nImage credit - IBM",

During his more than 40-year career at IBM his work and discoveries spanned magnetic resonance, superconducting computers, silicon integrated circuit technology, laser printers and displays, gesture and gaze-controlled input to computers and devices, touchscreen monitors and more. In the 1990s he helped invent the \"air-bag\" technology used to protect hard disk drives in laptops.\nFrom 1965-1966, Dr. Garwin served as director of applied research at the IBM Thomas J. Watson Research Center and was named an IBM Fellow in 1967, the company's pre-eminent technical distinction. During his career with IBM, Dr. Garwin divided his time between his corporate responsibilities and his work as an expert in national intelligence and defense for the United States government. Since his official retirement in 1993, Dr. Garwin has remained very active with technology and policy issues as wide ranging as space satellites, nuclear arms control, healthcare and the environment. He continues to keep an office at the IBM T.J. Watson Research Center.\nIn 2003, he was recognized by the White House with the National Medal of Science for his research and discoveries in physics and his enduring contributions to national security.\nTo read more about Dr. Garwin's career, visit the blog post: Dr. Richard L. Garwin: The Problem-Solver .\nAbout IBM Research\nFor more than seven decades, IBM Research has defined the future of information technology with more than 3,000 researchers in 12 labs located across six continents.

No, that's BS. It will not damage anything. The closest I can think of is that you should not hot-plug PS/2. If you use an ACTIVE CONVERTER (not a passive adapter) you can use a Model M perfectly over USB, which you can hot-plug, btw.

Also another problem is that during gaming session long keypress will stop registering, eg. after pressing W for few seconds, it will stop registering and I will need to re-press it again. All of these problem wont happen if I plug the keyboard directly to motherboard's PS2 port.Can any one check if my adapter is passive or active.. I think I have wasted my money 15182600_1730683127253135_477137119_o.jpg (114.53 kB, 1920x1080 - viewed 20 times.) 15224687_1730683137253134_13316229_o.jpg (137.93 kB, 1920x1080 - viewed 8 times.) 15224700_1730683120586469_1532297418_o.jpg (110.64 kB, 1920x1080 - viewed 8 times.)

      "text": "SYDNEY International Business Machines Corp failed in its handling of the A$10 million ($7.4 million) IT contract for Australia's first predominantly online census, Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said on Friday.\nIBM was the lead contractor for the five-yearly Aug. 9 household survey by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) that went offline the day after four distributed denial of service attacks that were caused by the website being flooded with clicks.\n\"This was not a particularly clever attack or some great international assault on the census,\" Turnbull told Melbourne's 3AW radio on Friday.\n\"IBM had a contract to deal with it and they failed,\" he said.\nThe style of the attack, which occurred through a router in Singapore, was \"common\" and \"utterly foreseeable,\" Turnbull said, although it was not clear who was responsible for it.\nAn IBM spokeswoman declined to comment on Friday, but the company apologized last month to an upper house Senate inquiry over the outage, while also saying that the router was set up by a subcontractor, Nextgen Networks Pty Ltd.\nIBM has since reached a confidential settlement with Australia for its role in the breach, Australia's minister responsible for the census, Michael McCormack, said in a statement.\nThe Senate inquiry heard that IBM failed to test the Singapore router properly, which was wrongly configured and became overloaded, causing the website shutdown.\nThe inquiry's report, released on Thursday, also criticized the ABS for favoring IBM during the tender process.\n\"There used to be a saying: 'No-one got fired for buying IBM',\" Turnbull said.\n\"I can assure you the lessons will be very carefully learned,\" he said.\n(Reporting by Tom Westbrook; Editing by Paul Tait)",

      "text": "0 A woman passes by the IBM offices in New York City, U.S., October 17, 2016. Reuters/Brendan McDermid \nAustralian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull is blaming contractor IBM for the collapse of the Australian Bureau of Statistics’ (ABS) website on Aug 9. To cover the cost of the incident, IBM – which opened a $12-billion data centre in Melbourne and Sydney in 2014 – made a “very substantial” multimillion dollar settlement. \nA new report says the 40-hour failure was because of significant and obvious oversights on the part of IBM in the delivery of the online national survey. The oversights include failure by IBM to adequately test the technology and insufficient online protection even if the census was identified as a high-risk project, News.com.au reports. \nTurnbull stresses the website crash was not the result of a clever attack or a deliberate hacking attempt by foreign groups. “This was a series of common or garden, utterly predictable, utterly foreseeable denial of service attacks. It’s not hacking, it’s really just bombarding a website with a lot of hits so the server is clogged up,” Turnbull explains. \nThe report says there were four minor Distributed Denial of Service attacks on the night of Aug 9 which the eCensus failed to withstand. IBM failed to test a router restart or have a backup synchronised and in place which were significant contributors to the failure of the online national survey that day. \nWhile IBM failed in its contractual obligation to deal with the problem, the report also criticises delayed preparation for the eCensus by ABS and decision to keep names and addresses of first-time participants. Because of the incident, the committee report recommends an open tender process in selecting an IT supplier and more scrutiny in picking the technology for the next eCensus in 2021. \nMinister were not spared by the report. David Kalisch, head of ABS, is placed on probation, while all government ministers and senior public servants would be sent to a cyber bootcamp to learn Cyber Security 101, Gizmodo reports. Alastair MacGibbons, author of the review, says Kalisch would be required to make a monthly report on how the ABS is addressing its shortcomings.",

PHOTO: REUTERS Nov 25, 2016 9:33 AM \n[SYDNEY] International Business Machines Corp failed in its handling of the A$10 million (S$10.61 million) IT contract for Australia's first predominantly online census, Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said on Friday. \nIBM was the lead contractor for the five-yearly Aug 9 household survey by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) that went offline the day after four distributed denial of service attacks that were caused by the website being flooded with clicks. \n\"This was not a particularly clever attack or some great international assault on the census,\" Mr Turnbull told Melbourne's 3AW radio on Friday. \"IBM had a contract to deal with it and they failed,\" he said. \nThe style of the attack, which occurred through a router in Singapore, was \"common\" and \"utterly foreseeable,\" Mr Turnbull said, although it was not clear who was responsible for it. \nAn IBM spokeswoman declined to comment on Friday, but the company apologised last month to an upper house Senate inquiry over the outage, while also saying that the router was set up by a subcontractor, Nextgen Networks Pty Ltd. \nIBM has since reached a confidential settlement with Australia for its role in the breach, Australia's minister responsible for the census, Michael McCormack, said in a statement. \nThe Senate inquiry heard that IBM failed to test the Singapore router properly, which was wrongly configured and became overloaded, causing the website shutdown. \nThe inquiry's report, released on Thursday, also criticised the ABS for favouring IBM during the tender process. \"There used to be a saying: 'No-one got fired for buying IBM',\" Mr Turnbull said. \"I can assure you the lessons will be very carefully learned,\" he said. \nREUTERS ",

      "text": "SYDNEY (Reuters) - International Business Machines Corp failed in its handling of the A$10 million ($7.4 million) IT contract for Australia's first predominantly online census, Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said on Friday. IBM was the lead contractor for the five-yearly Aug. 9 household survey by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) that went offline the day after four distributed denial of service attacks that were caused by the website being flooded with clicks.\n\"This was not a particularly clever attack or some great international assault on the census,\" Turnbull told Melbourne's 3AW radio on Friday.\n\"IBM had a contract to deal with it and they failed,\" he said.\nThe style of the attack, which occurred through a router in Singapore, was \"common\" and \"utterly foreseeable,\" Turnbull said, although it was not clear who was responsible for it.\nAn IBM spokeswoman declined to comment on Friday, but the company apologized last month to an upper house Senate inquiry over the outage, while also saying that the router was set up by a subcontractor, Nextgen Networks Pty Ltd.\nIBM has since reached a confidential settlement with Australia for its role in the breach, Australia's minister responsible for the census, Michael McCormack, said in a statement.\nThe Senate inquiry heard that IBM failed to test the Singapore router properly, which was wrongly configured and became overloaded, causing the website shutdown.\nThe inquiry's report, released on Thursday, also criticized the ABS for favoring IBM during the tender process.\n\"There used to be a saying: 'No-one got fired for buying IBM',\" Turnbull said.\n\"I can assure you the lessons will be very carefully learned,\" he said.\n(Reporting by Tom Westbrook; Editing by Paul Tait)",

He blamed a router failure.\nAustralian Bureau of Statistics boss David Kalisch told the same inquiry that the failure had cost taxpayers 30 million Australian dollars ($22 million).\nA report on the failure published on Thursday by Alastair MacGibbon, special adviser to the prime minister on cybersecurity, described the website&apos;s denial-of-service protections as \"inadequate.\"\nThe bureau&apos;s \"close and trusting relationship\" with IBM as a long-term contractor resulted in insufficient independent verification and oversight of critical aspects of the website, the report said.\nIBM had been awarded AU$1.55 billion in Australian government contracts since 2013 and the census website contract had been worth AU$9.6 million.\nMacGibbon recommended the government establish a \"Cyber Boot Camp\" where senior bureaucrats could learn cybersecurity fundamentals.\nHe found that no other information technology failure had done more damage to public confidence in the government&apos;s ability to deliver.\n© ",

      "text": "November 24, 2016 10:42 PM Australia says IBM settles over online census failure By ROD McGUIRK Associated Press Order Reprint of this Story CANBERRA, Australia \nGlobal technology giant IBM carried most of the blame for the crash of Australia's online census three months ago and had compensated the government for the financial cost of the debacle, the prime minister said on Friday. \nAustralia's first attempt to conduct a census online shut down for 43 hours in August after the website failed to cope with routine denial-of-service attacks. \nPrime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said IBM, the Australian Bureau of Statistic's head contractor, had reached a \"very substantial\" confidential settlement with the government over the failure that \"absolutely\" covered costs. \n\"It would not be an exaggeration to say that we had a collective sense of humor failure about IBM's performance here and they have 'fessed up (confessed), they've paid up and we're going to learn the lessons of this incident very diligently,\" Turnbull told Melbourne Radio 3AW. \n\"Overwhelming the failure was IBM's,\" he said. \nIBM Australia said on Friday the company had no further comment to add to a submission it made to a Senate inquiry last month into the failure. \nIBM Australia Managing Director Kerry Purcell told that inquiry he apologized for the inconvenience and took full responsibility for the failure. He blamed a router failure. \nAustralian Bureau of Statistics boss David Kalisch told the same inquiry that the failure had cost taxpayers 30 million Australian dollars ($22 million). \nA report on the failure published on Thursday by Alastair MacGibbon, special adviser to the prime minister on cybersecurity, described the website's denial-of-service protections as \"inadequate.\" \nThe bureau's \"close and trusting relationship\" with IBM as a long-term contractor resulted in insufficient independent verification and oversight of critical aspects of the website, the report said. \nIBM had been awarded AU$1.55 billion in Australian government contracts since 2013 and the census website contract had been worth AU$9.6 million. \nMacGibbon recommended the government establish a \"Cyber Boot Camp\" where senior bureaucrats could learn cybersecurity fundamentals. \nHe found that no other information technology failure had done more damage to public confidence in the government's ability to deliver.

      "text": " 39 PM ET Australia says IBM settles over online census failure By ROD McGUIRK By ROD McGUIRK , Associated Press   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) — Global technology giant IBM carried most of the blame for the crash of Australia's online census three months ago and had compensated the government for the financial cost of the debacle, the prime minister said on Friday. Australia's first attempt to conduct a census online shut down for 43 hours in August after the website failed to cope with routine denial-of-service attacks. Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said IBM, the Australian Bureau of Statistic's head contractor, had reached a \"very substantial\" confidential settlement with the government over the failure that \"absolutely\" covered costs. \"It would not be an exaggeration to say that we had a collective sense of humor failure about IBM's performance here and they have 'fessed up (confessed), they've paid up and we're going to learn the lessons of this incident very diligently,\" Turnbull told Melbourne Radio 3AW. \"Overwhelming the failure was IBM's,\" he said. IBM Australia said on Friday the company had no further comment to add to a submission it made to a Senate inquiry last month into the failure. IBM Australia Managing Director Kerry Purcell told that inquiry he apologized for the inconvenience and took full responsibility for the failure. He blamed a router failure. Australian Bureau of Statistics boss David Kalisch told the same inquiry that the failure had cost taxpayers 30 million Australian dollars ($22 million). A report on the failure published on Thursday by Alastair MacGibbon, special adviser to the prime minister on cybersecurity, described the website's denial-of-service protections as \"inadequate.\" The bureau's \"close and trusting relationship\" with IBM as a long-term contractor resulted in insufficient independent verification and oversight of critical aspects of the website, the report said. IBM had been awarded AU$1.55 billion in Australian government contracts since 2013 and the census website contract had been worth AU$9.6 million. MacGibbon recommended the government establish a \"Cyber Boot Camp\" where senior bureaucrats could learn cybersecurity fundamentals. He found that no other information technology failure had done more damage to public confidence in the government's ability to deliver.",

      "text": "(SYDNEY) – International Business Machines ibm failed in its handling of the A$10 million ($7.4 million) IT contract for Australia’s first predominantly online census, Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said on Friday.\nIBM was the lead contractor for the five-yearly Aug. 9 household survey by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) that went offline the day after four distributed denial of service attacks that were caused by the website being flooded with clicks.\n“This was not a particularly clever attack or some great international assault on the census,” Turnbull told Melbourne’s 3AW radio on Friday.\n“IBM had a contract to deal with it and they failed,” he said.\nThe style of the attack, which occurred through a router in Singapore, was “common” and “utterly foreseeable,” Turnbull said, although it was not clear who was responsible for it.\nAn IBM spokeswoman declined to comment on Friday, but the company apologised last month to an upper house Senate inquiry over the outage, while also saying that the router was set up by a subcontractor, Nextgen Networks.\nIBM has since reached a confidential settlement with Australia for its role in the breach, Australia’s minister responsible for the census, Michael McCormack, said in a statement.\nThe Senate inquiry heard that IBM failed to test the Singapore router properly, which was wrongly configured and became overloaded, causing the website shutdown.\nFor more on IBM, watch Fortune’s video: \n\nThe inquiry’s report, released on Thursday, also criticised the ABS for favouring IBM during the tender process.\n“There used to be a saying: ‘No-one got fired for buying IBM’,” Turnbull said.\n“I can assure you the lessons will be very carefully learned,” he said.",

Australia's first attempt to conduct a census online shut down for 43 hours in August after the website failed to cope with routine denial-of-service attacks. Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said IBM, the Australian Bureau of Statistic 's head contractor, had reached a \"very substantial\" confidential settlement with the government over the failure that \"absolutely\" covered costs. \"It would not be an exaggeration to say that we had a collective sense of humor failure about IBM's performance here and they have 'fessed up (confessed), they've paid up and we're going to learn the lessons of this incident very diligently,\" Turnbull told Melbourne Radio 3AW. \"Overwhelming the failure was IBM's,\" he said. IBM Australia said on Friday the company had no further comment to add to a submission it made to a Senate inquiry last month into the failure. IBM Australia Managing Director Kerry Purcell told that inquiry he apologized for the inconvenience and took full responsibility for the failure. He blamed a router failure. Australian Bureau of Statistics boss David Kalisch told the same inquiry that the failure had cost taxpayers 30 million Australian dollars ($22 million). A report on the failure published on Thursday by Alastair MacGibbon , special adviser to the prime minister on cybersecurity, described the website's denial-of-service protections as \"inadequate.\" The bureau's \"close and trusting relationship\" with IBM as a long-term contractor resulted in insufficient independent verification and oversight of critical aspects of the website, the report said. IBM had been awarded AU$1.55 billion in Australian government contracts since 2013 and the census website contract had been worth AU$9.6 million. MacGibbon recommended the government establish a \"Cyber Boot Camp\" where senior bureaucrats could learn cybersecurity fundamentals. He found that no other information technology failure had done more damage to public confidence in the government's ability to deliver. Latest News",

He blamed a router failure. \nAustralian Bureau of Statistics boss David Kalisch told the same inquiry that the failure had cost taxpayers 30 million Australian dollars ($22 million). \nA report on the failure published on Thursday by Alastair MacGibbon, special adviser to the prime minister on cybersecurity, described the website's denial-of-service protections as \"inadequate.\" \nThe bureau's \"close and trusting relationship\" with IBM as a long-term contractor resulted in insufficient independent verification and oversight of critical aspects of the website, the report said. \nIBM had been awarded AU$1.55 billion in Australian government contracts since 2013 and the census website contract had been worth AU$9.6 million. \nMacGibbon recommended the government establish a \"Cyber Boot Camp\" where senior bureaucrats could learn cybersecurity fundamentals. \nHe found that no other information technology failure had done more damage to public confidence in the government's ability to deliver.

He blamed a router failure. \nAustralian Bureau of Statistics boss David Kalisch told the same inquiry that the failure had cost taxpayers 30 million Australian dollars ($22 million). \nA report on the failure published on Thursday by Alastair MacGibbon, special adviser to the prime minister on cybersecurity, described the website's denial-of-service protections as \"inadequate.\" \nThe bureau's \"close and trusting relationship\" with IBM as a long-term contractor resulted in insufficient independent verification and oversight of critical aspects of the website, the report said. \nIBM had been awarded AU$1.55 billion in Australian government contracts since 2013 and the census website contract had been worth AU$9.6 million. \nMacGibbon recommended the government establish a \"Cyber Boot Camp\" where senior bureaucrats could learn cybersecurity fundamentals. \nHe found that no other information technology failure had done more damage to public confidence in the government's ability to deliver. \n ",

He blamed a router failure. \nAustralian Bureau of Statistics boss David Kalisch told the same inquiry that the failure had cost taxpayers 30 million Australian dollars ($22 million).   \nA report on the failure published on Thursday by Alastair MacGibbon, special adviser to the prime minister on cybersecurity, described the website's denial-of-service protections as \"inadequate.\" \nThe bureau's \"close and trusting relationship\" with IBM as a long-term contractor resulted in insufficient independent verification and oversight of critical aspects of the website, the report said. \nIBM had been awarded AU$1.55 billion in Australian government contracts since 2013 and the census website contract had been worth AU$9.6 million. \nMacGibbon recommended the government establish a \"Cyber Boot Camp\" where senior bureaucrats could learn cybersecurity fundamentals. \nHe found that no other information technology failure had done more damage to public confidence in the government's ability to deliver.

Photograph: Tracey Nearmy/AAP Friday 25 November 2016 04.19 GMT Last modified on Friday 25 November 2016 04.20 GMT View more sharing options Share on Messenger Close \nMalcolm Turnbull says taxpayers have been fully compensated for the multimillion dollar cost of the bungled 2016 census. \nHe said IBM had paid a “very substantial” confidential settlement which “absolutely” covered the cost of the census debacle. \nLast month, the head of the Australian Bureau of Statistics, David Kalisch, said the failure of the census website would cost taxpayers about $30m . \nSpeaking on radio 3AW on Friday, Turnbull said he planned to work through the recommendations from Alastair McGibbon’s review of the census failure , which was released on Thursday. \nThe review was critical of how IBM and the ABS handled the census fiasco and aftermath. Census attacks 'eminently predictable', says PM's cyber security adviser Read more \nIt said the ABS had “steadfastly refused to own the issue and acknowledge responsibility for the factors leading to the events and shortcomings in the handling of events on the night”. \nIBM “couldn’t handle a predictable problem”, a reference to the denial of service attacks that shut down the ABS website on census night in August. \nTurnbull said on Friday the census failure was “overwhelmingly” IBM’s. \n“They’ve acknowledged that. They’ve paid up. They’ve accepted the blame and they should have,” he said. “They were being paid big money to deliver a particular service and they failed.” \nWhen asked how much IBM had paid in compensation, Turnbull said: “It is confidential, but it’s a lot of money.” \nAustralian taxpayers paid nothing, he said. \n“The additional costs were well covered by the settlement. \n“It would not be an exaggeration to say that we had a collective sense of humour failure about IBM’s performance here, and they have fessed up, they’ve paid up, and we’re going to learn the lessons of this incident very diligently. The census farce is reminiscent of Wile E Coyote running off a cliff in pursuit of Road Runner | Dan Nolan Read more \nAt a Senate estimates hearing in September, Kalisch blamed IBM for the census debacle . \nHe said IBM’s contract to host the online census system required it to deliver a risk management plan, which included denial of service as a risk that would be mitigated by IBM. \nHe said the ABS had sought and received assurances from IBM about “operational preparedness and resilience to DDoS attacks” but “this risk was not adequately addressed by IBM”. \nOn Thursday, a separate report into the census failure was released by the Senate economics references committee. \nIt found the census was like a house with “a sinking foundation and cracks in the walls” because IBM and its subcontractors were in dispute over the bad build. \nIt said that primary responsibility for the debacle “lies with the government” and called on “the current minister, on behalf of the government, to take responsibility”.

      "text": "Australia says IBM settles over online census failure By ROD McGUIRK Associated Press Updated 46 min ago \nCANBERRA, Australia (AP) — Global technology giant IBM carried most of the blame for the crash of Australia's online census three months ago and had compensated the government for the financial cost of the debacle, the prime minister said on Friday. \nAustralia's first attempt to conduct a census online shut down for 43 hours in August after the website failed to cope with routine denial-of-service attacks. \nPrime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said IBM, the Australian Bureau of Statistic's head contractor, had reached a \"very substantial\" confidential settlement with the government over the failure that \"absolutely\" covered costs. \n\"It would not be an exaggeration to say that we had a collective sense of humor failure about IBM's performance here and they have 'fessed up (confessed), they've paid up and we're going to learn the lessons of this incident very diligently,\" Turnbull told Melbourne Radio 3AW. \n\"Overwhelming the failure was IBM's,\" he said. \nIBM Australia said on Friday the company had no further comment to add to a submission it made to a Senate inquiry last month into the failure. \nIBM Australia Managing Director Kerry Purcell told that inquiry he apologized for the inconvenience and took full responsibility for the failure. He blamed a router failure. \nAustralian Bureau of Statistics boss David Kalisch told the same inquiry that the failure had cost taxpayers 30 million Australian dollars ($22 million). \nA report on the failure published on Thursday by Alastair MacGibbon, special adviser to the prime minister on cybersecurity, described the website's denial-of-service protections as \"inadequate.\" \nThe bureau's \"close and trusting relationship\" with IBM as a long-term contractor resulted in insufficient independent verification and oversight of critical aspects of the website, the report said. \nIBM had been awarded AU$1.55 billion in Australian government contracts since 2013 and the census website contract had been worth AU$9.6 million. \nMacGibbon recommended the government establish a \"Cyber Boot Camp\" where senior bureaucrats could learn cybersecurity fundamentals. \nHe found that no other information technology failure had done more damage to public confidence in the government's ability to deliver.

He blamed a router failure. \nAustralian Bureau of Statistics boss David Kalisch told the same inquiry that the failure had cost taxpayers 30 million Australian dollars ($22 million).

      "text": "(SYDNEY) – International Business Machines ibm failed in its handling of the A$10 million ($7.4 million) IT contract for Australia’s first predominantly online census, Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said on Friday.\nIBM was the lead contractor for the five-yearly Aug. 9 household survey by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) that went offline the day after four distributed denial of service attacks that were caused by the website being flooded with clicks.\n“This was not a particularly clever attack or some great international assault on the census,” Turnbull told Melbourne’s 3AW radio on Friday.\n“IBM had a contract to deal with it and they failed,” he said.\nThe style of the attack, which occurred through a router in Singapore, was “common” and “utterly foreseeable,” Turnbull said, although it was not clear who was responsible for it.\nAn IBM spokeswoman declined to comment on Friday, but the company apologised last month to an upper house Senate inquiry over the outage, while also saying that the router was set up by a subcontractor, Nextgen Networks.\nIBM has since reached a confidential settlement with Australia for its role in the breach, Australia’s minister responsible for the census, Michael McCormack, said in a statement.\nThe Senate inquiry heard that IBM failed to test the Singapore router properly, which was wrongly configured and became overloaded, causing the website shutdown.\nFor more on IBM, watch Fortune’s video:\nThe inquiry’s report, released on Thursday, also criticised the ABS for favouring IBM during the tender process.\n“There used to be a saying: ‘No-one got fired for buying IBM’,” Turnbull said.\n“I can assure you the lessons will be very carefully learned,” he said.",

He blamed a router failure. \nAustralian Bureau of Statistics boss David Kalisch told the same inquiry that the failure had cost taxpayers 30 million Australian dollars ($22 million). \nA report on the failure published on Thursday by Alastair MacGibbon, special adviser to the prime minister on cybersecurity, described the website's denial-of-service protections as \"inadequate.\" \nThe bureau's \"close and trusting relationship\" with IBM as a long-term contractor resulted in insufficient independent verification and oversight of critical aspects of the website, the report said. \nIBM had been awarded AU$1.55 billion in Australian government contracts since 2013 and the census website contract had been worth AU$9.6 million. \nMacGibbon recommended the government establish a \"Cyber Boot Camp\" where senior bureaucrats could learn cybersecurity fundamentals. \nHe found that no other information technology failure had done more damage to public confidence in the government's ability to deliver.
