      "text": "A \nFRANKFURT/NEW YORK: Goldman Sachs is considering shifting some of its assets and operations from London to Frankfurt, three people familiar with the matter said, as it tries to secure access to the European Union market when Britain leaves the bloc. \nThe U.S. investment bank is examining the step as a way to qualify for supervision by the European Central Bank, putting some of its operations under the watch of the euro zone's main banking supervisor. \nComing under the ECB's jurisdiction should allow it to continue selling its services to clients across the euro zone and wider EU post-Brexit, according to one person with knowledge of the matter. \nHowever, this is uncharted legal territory and the sources said Goldman had not yet taken any decision on the matter. \n\"Moving under ECB supervision in Frankfurt is one of the options the bank is considering,\" one of the people said. Another said Goldman had held talks about such a step with ECB officials in Frankfurt. \nThe plans being examined would shift Goldman's European presence toward the center of the euro zone, representing a blow to London's status as a global financial center - and a coup for Frankfurt, a small city that is Germany's own finance capital. \nA spokesman for Goldman Sachs said there were \"numerous uncertainties\" about the outcome of Brexit negotiations. \"We continue to work through all possible implications of the Brexit vote,\" he said. \"We have not taken any decisions as to what our eventual response will be.\" \nAn ECB spokesman declined to comment. \nGoldman, whose services include broking and market-making in securities, foreign-exchange trading and corporate finance, currently relies on the EU's \"passporting\" system. This allows it to sell across the region without setting up shop in each member state, while under the supervision of UK authorities. \nBut banks' UK operations are expected to lose their passporting rights after Brexit. \nCurrently, U.S. banks concentrate the bulk of their European operations in Britain, with 88 percent of their regional employees based there, according to 2014 data from think-tank Bruegel. \nA bank such as Goldman Sachs would typically qualify for ECB supervision if it increased the assets of its euro zone operations to 30 billion euros (US$33 billion). \nGoldman Sachs AG in Germany had assets of 551 million euros in 2015 according to filings for last year. The bank's overall assets, however, in other entities in Germany and the rest of the euro zone are higher, according to the bank. \nEMPTY SPACE \nGoldman is keeping a floor vacant at its high-rise offices in Frankfurt which could accommodate any additional staff, one of the sources said. \nThe bank had initially intended to return this to the owner of the tower, where Goldman Sachs has occupied the top floors for more than a decade, but changed its mind after the Brexit vote. \nBankers in the City of London are worried that British Prime Minister Theresa May's pledge to deliver a full exit from the European Union will mean banks lose their passports or automatic right to do business in the EU. Two years of talks to reach this are due to start in March. \nSecuring the City's open access to the EU market, which lobbyists say is worth about 10 billion pounds (US$12 billion) a year to the British economy, is crucial for the financial hub of London - a central pillar of the country's economy. \nGoldman Sachs' Frankfurt office, which is focused on deal-making and selling securities in Europe's biggest economy, is currently its largest European operation outside London. The bank also has smaller offices in other European cities including Paris, Madrid and Milan, providing similar services. \nThe bank has a comprehensive banking license in Germany but some services are delivered via London, using the passport system to sell to the wider EU - posing a problem in the event of a \"hard Brexit\" where Britain has no access to the EU single market. \nGoldman Sachs' assets in Germany are small compared with the roughly US$850 billion of assets of Goldman Sachs in London. London is the bank's headquarters for its operations in Europe, the Middle East and Africa. \nEven were Goldman Sachs in Frankfurt to come under ECB supervision, its business in London would still answer to UK regulators. \n(Additional reporting by Anjuli Davies; Writing by John O'Donnell; Editing by Anna Willard) - Reuters",

      "text": "print \nFrankfurt. Thomson Reuters \nFRANKFURT/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs is considering shifting some of its assets and operations from London to Frankfurt, three people familiar with the matter said, as it tries to secure access to the European Union market when Britain leaves the bloc. \nThe U.S. investment bank is examining the step as a way to qualify for supervision by the European Central Bank, putting some of its operations under the watch of the euro zone's main banking supervisor. \nComing under the ECB's jurisdiction should allow it to continue selling its services to clients across the euro zone and wider EU post-Brexit, according to one person with knowledge of the matter. \nHowever, this is uncharted legal territory and the sources said Goldman had not yet taken any decision on the matter. \n\"Moving under ECB supervision in Frankfurt is one of the options the bank is considering,\" one of the people said. Another said Goldman had held talks about such a step with ECB officials in Frankfurt. \nThe plans being examined would shift Goldman's European presence toward the center of the euro zone, representing a blow to London's status as a global financial center - and a coup for Frankfurt, a small city that is Germany's own finance capital. \nGoldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein. Jemal Countess/Getty Images \nA spokesman for Goldman Sachs said there were \"numerous uncertainties\" about the outcome of Brexit negotiations. \"We continue to work through all possible implications of the Brexit vote,\" he said. \"We have not taken any decisions as to what our eventual response will be.\" \nAn ECB spokesman declined to comment. \nGoldman, whose services include broking and market-making in securities, foreign-exchange trading and corporate finance, currently relies on the EU's \"passporting\" system. This allows it to sell across the region without setting up shop in each member state, while under the supervision of UK authorities. \nBut banks' UK operations are expected to lose their passporting rights after Brexit. \nCurrently, U.S. banks concentrate the bulk of their European operations in Britain, with 88 percent of their regional employees based there, according to 2014 data from think-tank Bruegel. \nA bank such as Goldman Sachs would typically qualify for ECB supervision if it increased the assets of its euro zone operations to 30 billion euros ($33 billion). \nGoldman Sachs AG in Germany had assets of 551 million euros in 2015 according to filings for last year. The bank's overall assets, however, in other entities in Germany and the rest of the euro zone are higher, according to the bank. Empty space \nGoldman is keeping a floor vacant at its high-rise offices in Frankfurt which could accommodate any additional staff, one of the sources said. \nThe bank had initially intended to return this to the owner of the tower, where Goldman Sachs has occupied the top floors for more than a decade, but changed its mind after the Brexit vote. \nBankers in the City of London are worried that British Prime Minister Theresa May's pledge to deliver a full exit from the European Union will mean banks lose their passports or automatic right to do business in the EU. Two years of talks to reach this are due to start in March. \nLondon. Thomson Reuters \nSecuring the City's open access to the EU market, which lobbyists say is worth about 10 billion pounds ($12 billion) a year to the British economy, is crucial for the financial hub of London - a central pillar of the country's economy. \nGoldman Sachs' Frankfurt office, which is focused on deal-making and selling securities in Europe's biggest economy, is currently its largest European operation outside London. The bank also has smaller offices in other European cities including Paris, Madrid and Milan, providing similar services. \nThe bank has a comprehensive banking license in Germany but some services are delivered via London, using the passport system to sell to the wider EU - posing a problem in the event of a \"hard Brexit\" where Britain has no access to the EU single market. \nGoldman Sachs' assets in Germany are small compared with the roughly $850 billion of assets of Goldman Sachs in London. London is the bank's headquarters for its operations in Europe, the Middle East and Africa. \nEven were Goldman Sachs in Frankfurt to come under ECB supervision, its business in London would still answer to UK regulators. \n(Additional reporting by Anjuli Davies; Writing by John O'Donnell; Editing by Anna Willard) Read the original article on Reuters .

      "text": "Frankfurt. Thomson Reuters\nFRANKFURT/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs is considering shifting some of its assets and operations from London to Frankfurt, three people familiar with the matter said, as it tries to secure access to the European Union market when Britain leaves the bloc.\nThe U.S. investment bank is examining the step as a way to qualify for supervision by the European Central Bank, putting some of its operations under the watch of the euro zone's main banking supervisor.\nComing under the ECB's jurisdiction should allow it to continue selling its services to clients across the euro zone and wider EU post-Brexit, according to one person with knowledge of the matter.\nHowever, this is uncharted legal territory and the sources said Goldman had not yet taken any decision on the matter.\n\"Moving under ECB supervision in Frankfurt is one of the options the bank is considering,\" one of the people said. Another said Goldman had held talks about such a step with ECB officials in Frankfurt.\nThe plans being examined would shift Goldman's European presence toward the center of the euro zone, representing a blow to London's status as a global financial center - and a coup for Frankfurt, a small city that is Germany's own finance capital.\nGoldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein. Jemal Countess/Getty Images\nA spokesman for Goldman Sachs said there were \"numerous uncertainties\" about the outcome of Brexit negotiations. \"We continue to work through all possible implications of the Brexit vote,\" he said. \"We have not taken any decisions as to what our eventual response will be.\"\nAn ECB spokesman declined to comment.\nGoldman, whose services include broking and market-making in securities, foreign-exchange trading and corporate finance, currently relies on the EU's \"passporting\" system. This allows it to sell across the region without setting up shop in each member state, while under the supervision of UK authorities.\nBut banks' UK operations are expected to lose their passporting rights after Brexit.\nCurrently, U.S. banks concentrate the bulk of their European operations in Britain, with 88 percent of their regional employees based there, according to 2014 data from think-tank Bruegel.\nA bank such as Goldman Sachs would typically qualify for ECB supervision if it increased the assets of its euro zone operations to 30 billion euros ($33 billion).\nGoldman Sachs AG in Germany had assets of 551 million euros in 2015 according to filings for last year. The bank's overall assets, however, in other entities in Germany and the rest of the euro zone are higher, according to the bank.\nEmpty space Goldman is keeping a floor vacant at its high-rise offices in Frankfurt which could accommodate any additional staff, one of the sources said.\nThe bank had initially intended to return this to the owner of the tower, where Goldman Sachs has occupied the top floors for more than a decade, but changed its mind after the Brexit vote.\nBankers in the City of London are worried that British Prime Minister Theresa May's pledge to deliver a full exit from the European Union will mean banks lose their passports or automatic right to do business in the EU. Two years of talks to reach this are due to start in March.\nLondon. Thomson Reuters\nSecuring the City's open access to the EU market, which lobbyists say is worth about 10 billion pounds ($12 billion) a year to the British economy, is crucial for the financial hub of London - a central pillar of the country's economy.\nGoldman Sachs' Frankfurt office, which is focused on deal-making and selling securities in Europe's biggest economy, is currently its largest European operation outside London. The bank also has smaller offices in other European cities including Paris, Madrid and Milan, providing similar services.\nThe bank has a comprehensive banking license in Germany but some services are delivered via London, using the passport system to sell to the wider EU - posing a problem in the event of a \"hard Brexit\" where Britain has no access to the EU single market.\nGoldman Sachs' assets in Germany are small compared with the roughly $850 billion of assets of Goldman Sachs in London. London is the bank's headquarters for its operations in Europe, the Middle East and Africa.\nEven were Goldman Sachs in Frankfurt to come under ECB supervision, its business in London would still answer to UK regulators.\n(Additional reporting by Anjuli Davies; Writing by John O'Donnell; Editing by Anna Willard)\nRead the original article on Reuters .

REUTERS/David Gray/File Photo By Alexander Hübner , John O'Donnell and Olivia Oran | FRANKFURT/NEW YORK \nFRANKFURT/NEW YORK Goldman Sachs is considering shifting some of its assets and operations from London to Frankfurt, three people familiar with the matter said, as it tries to secure access to the European Union market when Britain leaves the bloc. \nThe U.S. investment bank is examining the step as a way to qualify for supervision by the European Central Bank, putting some of its operations under the watch of the euro zone's main banking supervisor. \nComing under the ECB's jurisdiction should allow it to continue selling its services to clients across the euro zone and wider EU post-Brexit, according to one person with knowledge of the matter. \nHowever, this is uncharted legal territory and the sources said Goldman had not yet taken any decision on the matter. \n\"Moving under ECB supervision in Frankfurt is one of the options the bank is considering,\" one of the people said.

Another said Goldman had held talks about such a step with ECB officials in Frankfurt.\nThe plans being examined would shift Goldman’s European presence toward the center of the euro zone, representing a blow to London’s status as a global financial center – and a coup for Frankfurt, a small city that is Germany’s own finance capital.\nA spokesman for Goldman Sachs said there were “numerous uncertainties” about the outcome of Brexit negotiations. “We continue to work through all possible implications of the Brexit vote,” he said. “We have not taken any decisions as to what our eventual response will be.”\nSEE ALSO \nBrexit wipes out $420B in the stock market :0 The Brexit effect crashed upon the shores of the US... Brexit wipes out $420B in the stock market An ECB spokesman declined to comment.\nGoldman, whose services include broking and market-making in securities, foreign-exchange trading and corporate finance, currently relies on the EU’s “passporting” system. This allows it to sell across the region without setting up shop in each member state, while under the supervision of UK authorities.\nBut banks’ UK operations are expected to lose their passporting rights after Brexit.\nCurrently, U.S. banks concentrate the bulk of their European operations in Britain, with 88 percent of their regional employees based there, according to 2014 data from think-tank Bruegel.\nA bank such as Goldman Sachs would typically qualify for ECB supervision if it increased the assets of its euro zone operations to 30 billion euros ($33 billion).\nGoldman Sachs AG in Germany had assets of 551 million euros in 2015 according to filings for last year. The bank’s overall assets, however, in other entities in Germany and the rest of the euro zone are higher, according to the bank.\nEmpty Space \nGoldman is keeping a floor vacant at its high-rise offices in Frankfurt which could accommodate any additional staff, one of the sources said.\nThe bank had initially intended to return this to the owner of the tower, where Goldman Sachs has occupied the top floors for more than a decade, but changed its mind after the Brexit vote.\nBankers in the City of London are worried that British Prime Minister Theresa May’s pledge to deliver a full exit from the European Union will mean banks lose their passports or automatic right to do business in the EU. Two years of talks to reach this are due to start in March.\nSecuring the City’s open access to the EU market, which lobbyists say is worth about 10 billion pounds ($12 billion) a year to the British economy, is crucial for the financial hub of London – a central pillar of the country’s economy.\nGoldman Sachs’ Frankfurt office, which is focused on deal-making and selling securities in Europe’s biggest economy, is currently its largest European operation outside London. The bank also has smaller offices in other European cities including Paris, Madrid and Milan, providing similar services.\nThe bank has a comprehensive banking license in Germany but some services are delivered via London, using the passport system to sell to the wider EU – posing a problem in the event of a “hard Brexit” where Britain has no access to the EU single market.\nGoldman Sachs’ assets in Germany are small compared with the roughly $850 billion of assets of Goldman Sachs in London. London is the bank’s headquarters for its operations in Europe, the Middle East and Africa.\nEven were Goldman Sachs in Frankfurt to come under ECB supervision, its business in London would still answer to UK regulators.\nFiled under banking ,  Brexit ,  european union ,  global economy ,  goldman sachs",

Another said Goldman had held talks about such a step with ECB officials in Frankfurt. \nThe plans being examined would shift Goldman's European presence towards the centre of the euro zone, representing a blow to London's status as a global financial centre - and a coup for Frankfurt, a small city that is Germany's own finance capital. \nA spokesman for Goldman Sachs said there were \"numerous uncertainties\" about the outcome of Brexit negotiations. \"We continue to work through all possible implications of the Brexit vote,\" he said. \"We have not taken any decisions as to what our eventual response will be.\" \nAn ECB spokesman declined to comment. \nGoldman, whose services include broking and market-making in securities, foreign-exchange trading and corporate finance, currently relies on the EU's \"passporting\" system. This allows it to sell across the region without setting up shop in each member state, while under the supervision of UK authorities. \nBut banks' UK operations are expected to lose their passporting rights after Brexit. \nCurrently, U.S. banks concentrate the bulk of their European operations in Britain, with 88% of their regional employees based there, according to 2014 data from think-tank Bruegel. \nA bank such as Goldman Sachs would typically qualify for ECB supervision if it increased the assets of its euro zone operations to 30 billion euros ($33 billion). \nGoldman Sachs AG in Germany had assets of 551 million euros in 2015, according to filings for last year. The bank's overall assets, however, in other entities in Germany and the rest of the euro zone are higher, according to the bank. \nEmpty space \nGoldman is keeping a floor vacant at its high-rise offices in Frankfurt which could accommodate any additional staff, one of the sources said. \nThe bank had initially intended to return this to the owner of the tower, where Goldman Sachs has occupied the top floors for more than a decade, but changed its mind after the Brexit vote. \nBankers in the City of London are worried that British Prime Minister Theresa May's pledge to deliver a full exit from the European Union will mean banks lose their passports or automatic right to do business in the EU. Two years of talks to reach this are due to start in March. \nSecuring the City's open access to the EU market, which lobbyists say is worth about 10 billion pounds (US$12 billion) a year to the British economy, is crucial for the financial hub of London - a central pillar of the country's economy. \nGoldman Sachs' Frankfurt office, which is focused on deal-making and selling securities in Europe's biggest economy, is currently its largest European operation outside London. The bank also has smaller offices in other European cities including Paris, Madrid and Milan, providing similar services. \nThe bank has a comprehensive banking licence in Germany but some services are delivered via London, using the passport system to sell to the wider EU - posing a problem in the event of a \"hard Brexit\" where Britain has no access to the EU single market. \nGoldman Sachs' assets in Germany are small compared with the roughly US$850 billion of assets of Goldman Sachs in London. London is the bank's headquarters for its operations in Europe, the Middle East and Africa. \nEven were Goldman Sachs in Frankfurt to come under ECB supervision, its business in London would still answer to UK regulators. \n(US$1 = 0.8074 pounds; US$1 = 0.9122 euros) Related Articles",

      "text": "Goldman Sachs is considering shifting some of its assets and operations from London to Frankfurt, three people familiar with the matter said, as it tries to secure access to the European Union market when Britain leaves the bloc.\nThe U.S. investment bank is examining the step as a way to qualify for supervision by the European Central Bank, putting some of its operations under the watch of the euro zone’s main banking supervisor.\nComing under the ECB’s jurisdiction should allow it to continue selling its services to clients across the euro zone and wider EU post-Brexit, according to one person with knowledge of the matter.\nHowever, this is uncharted legal territory and the sources said Goldman had not yet taken any decision on the matter.\n“Moving under ECB supervision in Frankfurt is one of the options the bank is considering,” one of the people said. Another said Goldman had held talks about such a step with ECB officials in Frankfurt.\nThe plans being examined would shift Goldman’s European presence towards the centre of the euro zone, representing a blow to London’s status as a global financial centre – and a coup for Frankfurt, a small city that is Germany’s own finance capital.\nA spokesman for Goldman Sachs said there were “numerous uncertainties” about the outcome of Brexit negotiations. “We continue to work through all possible implications of the Brexit vote,” he said. “We have not taken any decisions as to what our eventual response will be.”\nAn ECB spokesman declined to comment.\nGoldman, whose services include broking and market-making in securities, foreign-exchange trading and corporate finance, currently relies on the EU’s “passporting” system. This allows it to sell across the region without setting up shop in each member state, while under the supervision of UK authorities.\nBut banks’ UK operations are expected to lose their passporting rights after Brexit.\nCurrently, U.S. banks concentrate the bulk of their European operations in Britain, with 88 percent of their regional employees based there, according to 2014 data from think-tank Bruegel.\nA bank such as Goldman Sachs would typically qualify for ECB supervision if it increased the assets of its euro zone operations to 30 billion euros ($33 billion).\nGoldman Sachs AG in Germany had assets of 551 million euros in 2015 according to filings for last year. The bank’s overall assets, however, in other entities in Germany and the rest of the euro zone are higher, according to the bank.\nEMPTY SPACE\nGoldman is keeping a floor vacant at its high-rise offices in Frankfurt which could accommodate any additional staff, one of the sources said.\nThe bank had initially intended to return this to the owner of the tower, where Goldman Sachs has occupied the top floors for more than a decade, but changed its mind after the Brexit vote.\nBankers in the City of London are worried that British Prime Minister Theresa May’s pledge to deliver a full exit from the European Union will mean banks lose their passports or automatic right to do business in the EU. Two years of talks to reach this are due to start in March.\nSecuring the City’s open access to the EU market, which lobbyists say is worth about 10 billion pounds ($12 billion) a year to the British economy, is crucial for the financial hub of London – a central pillar of the country’s economy.\nGoldman Sachs’ Frankfurt office, which is focussed on deal-making and selling securities in Europe’s biggest economy, is currently its largest European operation outside London. The bank also has smaller offices in other European cities including Paris, Madrid and Milan, providing similar services.\nThe bank has a comprehensive banking licence in Germany but some services are delivered via London, using the passport system to sell to the wider EU – posing a problem in the event of a “hard Brexit” where Britain has no access to the EU single market.\nGoldman Sachs’ assets in Germany are small compared with the roughly $850 billion of assets of Goldman Sachs in London. London is the bank’s headquarters for its operations in Europe, the Middle East and Africa.\nEven were Goldman Sachs in Frankfurt to come under ECB supervision, its business in London would still answer to UK regulators.\nSource: Reuters (By Alexander Hübner, John O’Donnell and Olivia Oran, Additional reporting by Anjuli Davies; Writing by John O’Donnell; Editing by Anna Willard)",

      "text": "Order Reprint of this Story WASHINGTON \nThe man believed to be the front runner to become the next Treasury secretary comes with no government experience, top Wall Street pedigree and a whiff of controversy. \nTrump appears to favor Steven Mnuchin, his campaign finance chief , as the next Treasury secretary, according to multiple media outlets \nMnuchin is a 17-year veteran of Wall Street powerhouse Goldman Sachs, leaving it in 2002. He founded a hedge fund called Dune Capital Management, and sits on the board of directors of retailing giant Sears Holding Corp., which is run by his roommate at Yale University, Eddie Lampert. \nWe’ve had lots of Treasury secretaries coming from the private sector. Michael Strain, director of economic policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute. \nIn the campaign, Trump dismissed secretive hedge funds, which are open only to wealthy investors, as “paper pushers” because they often bet against stocks or buy distressed government bonds in hopes of a big payoff. But Trump also has been friendswith Mnuchin for more than a decade. \n“I was there at the beginning when he decided to run for president, and I’ve been a supporter and quiet adviser behind the scenes to him,” Mnuchin told the New York Times on May 9, 2016. \nTrump has also promised to place priority on cabinet secretaries who have real-world experience as businessmen. \nAmong other possible picks garnering public attention are corporate raider Carl Icahn, former General Electric CEO Jack Welch and Trump friend Lawrence Kudlow. He’s a Reagan-era budget official who became a Wall Street star until a $10,000-a-month cocaine habit wrecked his career in 1994. He later reinvented himself as a commentator on the CNBC business channel, and Trump often cites Kudlow when pitching his tax plans. \n“The senior cabinet officers, some of them are going to look different than what we’re used to,” cautioned Michael Strain, director of economic policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank. \nAmong Mnuchin’s bonafides is that he ran the investor group that created OneWest Bank. \nThat California bank opened in 2009 after he and fellow hedge fund investors snapped up from the government distressed mortgages from a failed subprime lender at a steep discount amid financial crisis. \nOneWest aggressively assumed assets of other troubled banks and in 2014 announced it'd be acquired by CIT Group for $3.4 billion, about twice what had been invested. \nThe son of a wealthy Goldman Sachs banker who sat on the management committee, Mnuchin also founded two entertainment companies that provided capital for the X-Men movie franchise and for the hit Avatar. \nOne of those companies, Relativity, was embroiled in bankruptcy proceedings where creditors alleged OneWest unfairly received preferential treatment over others owed money. \nMnuchin still sits on CIT’s board, and remains chairman CEO of Dune Capital Management. He’s also still listed as a director of the Sears Holding Corp ., which owns the Sears and Kmart retail stores and whose stock trades on the Nasdaq under the stock symbol SHLD. Mnuchin chairs the Nominating & Corporate Governance Committee and is a member of the Finance Committee. \nIf chosen, Mnuchin’s relations with the Federal Reserve could bear watching. \nDuring the lead up to OneWest Bank’s acquisition by New York-based CIT Group, the company took the unusual step, according to Bloomberg News , of starting an online form letter in order to pressure Fed Chair Janet Yellen to accept the merger without a public hearing. \nCIT Group was run at the time by John Thain. He is one of the antagonists of the financial crisis for his excesses as CEO of Merrill Lynch, including huge executive bonuses and a $1.2 million remodeling of his office that included a $35,000 toilet. \nWhen the deal with CIT Group closed, it made millions for not only Mnuchin but his OneWest Bank investors that included billionaire George Soros and the guy who famously bet against the housing market, investor John Paulson, the subject of the Michael Lewis book and movie The Big Short. \nKevin G.

      "text": "By Sandeep Kanihama \nResearch Team at Goldman Sachs, suggests that they have been thinking about the near-term path for the British Pound in terms of two things, first, there is the question where GBP/$ would trade in the event of “hard Brexit” and s econd, there is the question what probability to assign to “hard Brexit”. \nKey Quotes \n“High Court decision is a move back in the opposite direction. It reduces the odds that Article 50 will be triggered by March and, more fundamentally, may limit how aggressive the government can be in its negotiating position. The probability of “hard Brexit” has shrunk, which could see GBP/$ settle around 1.26 in the near term, a half-way house between pre-conservative party conference levels (1.30) and the aftermath of the flash crash (1.22). Big picture, our conviction is that Sterling needs to weaken more, given that the trade-weighted decline is only 14 percent so far, well shy of our 20-40 percent range. \nPrime Minister May committed herself to triggering Article 50 by March, which – together with accompanying populist rhetoric – raised the probability of “hard Brexit.” At the time, our impression was that the market was slow to price this rising probability and we reiterated our year-end target for GBP/$ on Oct. 6, the morning before the flash crash. Recent High Court decision is a step in the opposite direction, since – at the very least – it injects uncertainty over the government being able to trigger Article 50 by March and, more fundamentally, may constrain just how aggressive the negotiating position with the EU can be. If 1.30 was the pre-conservative party equilibrium for GBP/$ and 1.22 was where GBP/$ settled once the market had updated its odds for “hard Brexit”, we think GBP/$ could now settle around 1.26, a half-way point of sorts in the near term. Our conviction is that the fall-out from Brexit will be large and we maintain our year-end target for GBP/$ of 1.20. \nOur conviction to maintain our near-term forecast for Sterling weakness rests on the fact that the fall in the currency is still relatively modest in trade-weighted terms. On our estimates, the Pound has fallen 14 percent from pre-Brexit vote levels, which is still well short of the upper bound of our range between 20-40 percent that we derive using various approaches. We continue to think that – even with the decline since June – the Pound is not yet cheap and that more declines are coming.” RELATED TOPICS ",

While we believe the landscape could be shifting more broadly for the Financial Services industry if policy changes within the upcoming Trump Administration are significant, particularly on the regulatory front, the shift occurring toward greater computerization and digital solutions is secular, in our view. Accordingly, in the wake of the election, we are currently assessing the confluence of moving parts that could impact both the industry and Goldman Sachs. While we are currently more encouraged by the firm’s prospects, we maintain our Market Perform rating for now as we will continue to look for more detail around upcoming policy proposals to assess for signs of a meaningful ROE break-out.

      "text": "Goldman Sachs’ James Schneider believes Square Inc (NYSE: SQ )'s “prospects of penetration with large merchants, its ability to monetize smaller merchants with software and lending, and its margin potential are significantly under-appreciated.” \nSchneider maintains a Buy rating on the company, with a price target of $15. Takeaways \nFollowing meetings with chief financial officer Sarah Friar, the analyst mentioned that the company has continued to expand its focus from micro-merchants to larger merchants, who accounted for 43 percent of the GPV in 3Q. \nSchneider believes Square realizes “software solutions and custom pricing will be needed for penetration, but thinks that it can be competitive up to ~$20 million in volume.” \nOn the other hand, Square Capital has continued to gain robust traction, with its loan size now at $6,000 and “an upper bound rate of penetration ~10X current levels.” In addition, Square Capital has been able to keep its loss rates at below 4 percent. Making Progress \nThe company has also made progress in terms of new products, having developed more sophisticated POS software with ERP capabilities. The analyst believes this software could be launched in 2017, targeting retail, restaurants and health & beauty. \n“Square continues to manage investments to balance revenue growth with margin expansion, and believes that it can deliver mid-single digit EBITDA margin expansion in 2017 and beyond after 20 points of expansion in 2016,” Schneider went on to say. \nSquare had reported robust third quarter results , which was well received by investors, with the stock moving up 4 percent on November 2, following the results. \nThe company has also announced the appointment of Hillary B. Smith as its general counsel on November 2. \nAlthough Square has taken a long time to enter the U.K. market, the company expects its path to break even, following its formal launch in the country, to be “relatively quick”. \nIn Monday's pre-market session, Square was up 1.6 percent at $12.07. \nImage Credit: By Z22 (Own work) [CC BY-SA 4.0], via Wikimedia Commons Latest Ratings for SQ",

Bloomberg reports that Mnuchin has been ‘recommended by Donald Trump’s transition team’, and that his promotion awaits the president elect’s endorsement (or not). \nHaving been Trump’s finance chairman during the campaign, Mnuchin is already closely allied to President-elect Trump but this would take things to a whole new level. It would also suggest that the revolving door between Goldman Sachs and government is back in play, and that Trump’s anti-elitism doesn’t extend to former Goldman bankers, second generation. \nIndeed, as ex-Goldman bankers go it’s hard to find anyone with a more gilded backstory than Mnuchin. Mnuchin’s father, Robert, spent thirty years at Goldman Sachs and was a member of the management committee and a partner in charge of equity trading for ten of them. When Robert Mnuchin left Goldman in 1990, he was heralded as ‘one of the most important figures in the equities business for almost two decades.’ His son, Steven, joined Goldman five years earlier after a traineeship at Salmon Brothers; it’s hard to imagine that his family name didn’t give Steven a head start – particularly as his brother, Alan Mnuchin also just happened to be working for the firm at that time. \nMnuchin junior didn’t go into his father’s equities division at Goldman though. Instead, his time at Salomon equipped him for a career in fixed income trading at the firm. Bloomberg reports that Steven Mnuchin was “front and center” for the advent of some the most controversial financial products of the era, like collateralized debt obligations. Ultimately, he rose to become partner and head of mortgages, U.S. governments, money markets and municipal bonds at Goldman , along with chief information officer (CIO). \nMnuchin was a Goldman partner when the firm went public in 1999. With a 0.600% stake in the firm, he was one of an elite group of partners with a higher than average holding, worth a reported $46m. With that money in the bank, he quit. \nWhen Mnuchin’s father left Goldman, he declared that he was off to, pursue, ‘ broader, different interests, and a life that doesn’t have to be structured unless I choose for it to be.” However, when Steven Mnuchin left Goldman, he started by joining a hedge fund founded by his former Yale room mate, before moving on to become CEO of a hedge fund backed by George Soros. Subsequently, he co-founded another hedge fund, Dune, with two Goldman partners and was offered $32bn of Merrill’s crisis era CDOs for just $8bn by then Merrill CEO and Goldman alum John Thain – something he seemingly turned down . \nSteven Mnuchin’s post-Goldman existence hasn’t just been about hedge funds. He also financed some well known movies (American Sniper) and spent a period as CEO of OneWest Bank (which was reprimanded for its harsh attempts at foreclosing on families in New York around the time he joined). And now he’s Treasury Secretary. Shares in Goldman are up 15% since the election. This clearly isn’t just the Mnuchin effect, but having an alum whose family is deeply tied to the bank as Treasury secretary can’t be a bad thing. \nSeparately, the Financial Times reports that Lars Andersson, an M&A banker who helped Morgan Stanley earn up to $120m for advising Monsanto on its $66bn sale to Bayer in September, is leaving to launch a boutique advisory firm. This in itself is something of an inevitability nowadays. What’s notable is that Andersson reportedly spent more than a decade prior to his $120m advising Monsanto for no fee. Meanwhile: \nThe number of new finance jobs in London fell 17% year-on-year in October. New applicants were only down 7%. (WSJ) \nBoris Johnson likes Donald Trump because he’s a “dealmaker.” (Politico) \nJohn Cryan cancelled an appearance at panel to discuss the future of Deutsche Bank. (Bloomberg) \nCME Group might establish a clearing house in Dublin. (Bloomberg) \nA London technology headhunter got calls from three senior Silicon Valley executives in the 24 hours after Donald Trump’s election victory, with the tech execs “explicitly” saying they were interested in moving to Britain to escape a Trump Presidency. (Business Insider) \n“My biggest concern is whenever the ECB will start this tapering and what will happen then.” (Bloomberg) \nIf you look good in the office, you’ll earn 20% more than if you don’t.

      "text": "by IWB · November 15, 2016 \nLegendary investor, financial commentator and author of several books Jim Rogers told Radio Sputnik that the United States is “the largest debtor nation in the history of the world” and the situation is becoming even more untenable. \nRogers was commenting on the US dollar strengthening in recent days. The US currency reached its highest multi-month levels against other major currencies on Monday morning. The surge came on speculation that fiscal-stimulus under President-elect Donald Trump will bolster America’s economic growth and at the same time prompt the Federal Reserve to increase interest rates. \n“There’s a lot of turmoil coming into the world. And when people are scared, they look for a safe haven. Many people think that the US dollar is a safe haven for historic reasons. It’s not a safe haven. America is the largest debtor nation in the history of the world and it’s getting worse every day. But that does not matter. People think that it’s a safe haven and that’s why it’s going higher because people are getting more and more worried,” he explained. \nhttps://sputniknews.com/us/201611141047424644-jim-rogers-us-debt/ \nEarlier today, we presented an analysis by Goldman Sachs which emerged with a lukewarm take on Trump’s policies as to how they stand to impact US domestic growth, with only Goldman’s “adverse” scenario resulting in a “stagflationary”, i.e., recessionary outcome. However, in a follow up report by another set of Goldman economists Nicholas Fawcett and Sven Jari Stehn, one which looks at the broader global set of Trump policy consequences for the entire world – because after all, the US is still a part of it – it finds that virtually every scenario leads to a global contraction, something we previewed yesterday in our post titled “What’s Good For The US In This Case, Is Not Good For Emerging Markets.” \nhttp://www.zerohedge.com/news/2016-11-14/goldman-just-killed-trump-euphoria-concludes-global-growth-will-suffer-under-trump-n \nOver the last decade, the debt has expanded by more than $3 trillion beyond the sum of the government’s budget deficits over that same period of time. In most years, in fact, the government’s reported budget deficit is lower than the actual growth in the national debt. Fiscal 2016 was a perfect example. Just weeks ago, the Treasury Department reported a $587 billion budget deficit for the fiscal year. But according to the government website that tracks the total U.S. debt to the penny, the actual national debt grew by about $1.4 trillion. \nhttp://www.washingtonexaminer.com/national-debt-is-growing-faster-than-you-think/article/2607286 \nWords matter. The process of understanding why Donald Trump is now heading for the White House starts with the correct description of what has happened in the eight years since Barack Obama became president. \nSome economists call the turbulent period that followed the collapse of Lehman Brothers the Great Recession. Others say the US along with other developed nations is experiencing secular stagnation. Anything, it seems, to avoid using the D word: depression. \nThe dictionary definition of a depression is a sustained, long-term downturn in economic activity, which sums up precisely what has occurred since 2008. Growth rates globally have remained low despite colossal amounts of stimulus. Living standards have barely risen and the threat of deflation has loomed large. The depression since 2008 has not been as severe as that of the 1930s but there are echoes of it all the same: in the food banks that are the new soup kitchens; in the mass movements of migrants in search of a better life who are the modern equivalent of the Okies in the Grapes of Wrath; and in Trump, who has tapped into anger that has been bubbling away quietly for decades.",

      "text": "Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE: GS ) Bank of America Merrill Lynch Future of Financials 2016 Conference November 15, 2016, 10:00 ET Executives Harvey Schwartz - EVP and CFO Harit Talwar - Head of Digital Finance Analysts Mike Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Mike Carrier I'm Mike Carrier and I am the broker asset manager and exchange analyst here at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Before we get started with our next session I just wanted to throw up one of the audience polling questions just given the environment over the past week. So based on the backdrop and the election outcome what's your outlook for the capital markets over the next one to two years? So one, little to no change in regulation, flattish revenues and stable returns. Two, little to no change regulation but improving revenues, 5% in returns, 10% plus with GDP growth. Three, modest improvement in regulation, revenues 5% to 10% and returns 10% to 12%. Significant improvement in regulation, revenues 10% plus and returns 12% plus. I will give you five seconds. All right and the results. So the vast majority 56% modest improvement in regulation with revenues 5% to 10% and returns 10% to 12% and then second is significant improvement in regulation with revenues at 10% plus and returns 12% plus. All right thanks for that. So it's my pleasure to introduce our next company Goldman Sachs and presenting today is Goldman's Chief Financial Officer, Harvey Schwartz and Head of Digital Finance, Harit Talwar. Harvey has been in his current role since 2013 and prior to that he was Global Co-Head of the Securities Division and in addition he sits on the firm wide risk regulatory reform and capital committees among others. Harit joined the firm in 2015, and is leading Goldman's Digital Consumer Banking Initiative which has created a lot of interest in the industry. Prior to joining Goldman, Harit was President of US Cards Division for Discover as well as a Chief Marketing Officer and Member of Discovers' Executive Committee. Goldman has been able to navigate the revenue and regulatory backdrop by managing its cost structure and capital base relatively well and still generating a double digit return on capital. Based on recent events that can impact the outlook, investments being made in digital banking and the firm's ongoing focus on cost and capital management it will be interesting to get Harvey and Harit state on the outlook. Thanks guys for being here today and alternative for you guys a short video and a demo related to Marcus, the Online Lending Initiative and then we will do some Q&A. [Video Playing] All right. Thanks. That is helpful color I think in an area that a lot of people have questions about [indiscernible] and it's a relatively new initiative. So Harit maybe first tell everyone maybe about yourself and what drove you to come to Goldman Sachs launch Marcus? Harit Talwar Sure, Mike thanks for having us over. I've been in consumer financial services for more than 30 years. In Asia and Europe and of course in the U.S. and most recently as you said I was President of U.S. Cards at Discover. So now in terms of what drove me to join Goldman Sachs because I was very happy at Discover, it's a great company. Right from the first conversation I had with the firm and trust me I had quite a few conversations. I was really struck by how methodical and thoughtful the firm was in evaluating and pursuing this opportunity and the opportunity is very exciting. Leveraging the leading financial services brand and addressing a real consumer need and the core strengths of the firm in technology, risk management data and client centricity which in our business we call it customer centricity. These are in the DNA of the firm and very highly relevant in the business that we are building. So that's what drove me to the firm. Mike Carrier Harvey, can you tell us about how the firm approached getting into the consumer lending idea, how it evolved maybe over time and how you came to the conclusion to hire Harit? Harvey Schwartz So really the beginning of it goes back to a management offsite we have several years ago where like many offsites we have discussions about are there potential things we can do to be doing better, how do we think about cost structure, all the things you would think would be on that list of the discussion items and one of the things that we spent time on was the obvious growing trend into digital broadly and then more narrowly what was happening in digital finance and then the question was raised whether or not given the strength of our balance sheet the fact that we're a bank whether or not as essentially the world converged with digital finance and FinTech lenders coming in whether or not we could play a role and a couple things obvious, a couple of things about that were obvious as Harit said we feel very confident about our technology skills. We feel very confident at our core competency and risk management, the obvious piece that we didn't have was a long standing experience with this consumer base and so we established a search and we'd be looking for all the things you think we'd be looking for. We're looking for a long history in this space. Some of it significant credentials kind of live the cycles, understands all the prerequisites but I would say in our discussions with the Harit obviously has all those prerequisites, the one thing that truly stood out to all of us was his focus on the consumer because we wanted to figure out a way to provide the consumer with something that was new and added value to them and he demonstrated for lack of better words the most vision on that and our discussions and so it's quite natural and we've been thrilled to have him as our partner. Mike Carrier Okay. And Harit maybe how do you think about the market opportunity the typical new customer that you'd be targeting and how big is the market opportunity? Harit Talwar Sure. So the market is very large and it's growing. So that's always a good thing. The unsecured consumer loan market in the U.S. is roughly around $850 billion, now off that market we are focused on millions of consumers who are credit worthy so FICO of 660 plus responsible who have typically $5000 to $25,000 of credit card debt and are paying very high interest rates on that debt. It is that segment that we believe we will add significant value to and we know that 70% of those consumers are unaware of better debt management options. So the opportunity is large and deep. Now what is very important is that what is our approach to the opportunity. We want to be very deliberate. I've been in the industry a long time and as you know in unsecured consumer lending to deliver attractive risk adjusted returns through the cycle, it's very essential to be very deliberate and that's what we are going to be and right from the first day the senior management in the firm has emphasized exactly that that this is an attractive opportunity but let's be deliberate and let's not be in a rush. Mike Carrier Harvey, just in terms of the competitive advantages that you see with Goldman you’re taking this opportunity maybe how to build market share and given that it's competitive maintaining that that you’re? Harvey Schwartz Sure, well it goes to back a little bit what I was saying before and what Harit just said I think it's critical it's a very large market. So there's certainly room for incremental value providers. In terms of our competitive advantage in addition to the things we talked about earlier the core competencies in risk and technology and obviously everything Harit and his team were brought on, I think the single most important thing is that we started with a white sheet of paper and that white sheet of paper approach we don't have branches, we don't have legacy infrastructure, we don't have legacy business lines. It really allowed Harit and his team to step back, engage with consumers about what they would really like in a loan product and starting with that information and their feedback in terms of I think in the video we call the pain points allowed Harit and his team to develop something again a white sheet of paper to address their needs and Harit can you walk you through the some of the product aspects. Harit Talwar Sure. And I think it's very important the benefit of a startup but with 147 years of expertise and history. So as Harvey said we listen to around 10,000 consumers and what we heard was loud and clear. They want real value, they want it simple, they want it transparent, they want it customizable to their situation and needs and they want a great user experience. So against these sort of things that we heard what are we delivering? Our interest rates will be typically 300 to 400 basis points lower than what customers would be paying typically on their credit card debt. So there's a real savings for them. Our rates are going to be fixed because customers don't like changing rates particularly in the environment we're heading. Our loans are going to term loans so fully amortizing to use our jargon so that consumers are actually able to pay down debt and best of all no fees whatsoever and no fine print about no fees, there are too many players who claim no fees but then have all kinds of asterisks . We have no fees ever. We have as you saw in the video a great, very intuitive user experience because we've created it with feedback from customers and when they do call us. The talk to a live loan specialist and not machines. So we are very excited with this package but we went a step ahead and we brought in some innovation, and all based on consumer feedback. So for example we heard from consumers that they like to pick the date of the month when they will make monthly payments. Second, we heard from consumers they think in terms of how much loan they want as you saw in the video and how much they can pay every month and let the term of the loan be the output. If it is 29 months, if it is 42 months, if it is 33 months they don't like to be straight jacketed into a 3 year loan or a 5 year loan, and credit worthy responsible consumers say I pay you on time all the time and when something happens life happens the banks tend to be so punitive. So we have a feature which actually is very good for credit quality also that if customers pay on time the full payment for 12 months they earn so to say a pass so that in case they need to defer a payment for one month they contact us and they can do that at our cost. So for example if it was a 34 month loan it becomes a 35 month loan. Now we've been able to build all these features and this experience because as Harvey said we have the core benefit of our balance sheet and building a new non-legacy modern technology platform. So that's what we’re very we have a excited about. Mike Carrier Okay. When I think about maybe one of the financial aspect. So how do you think about returns in the business. I mean maybe a timeframe. You know getting you know to maybe a target? Harit Talwar Sure. I think from all my experience and as you know in unsecured consumer lending in the U.S. for the prime credit space returns typically are 3% to 4% pretax ROI. Equity requirements are typically 9% to 11% which translates to around high teens ROI. So these are typical industry returns for consumer unsecured lending and we expect to mirror those returns over time. We've built the business, we will ramp it up over time and we'll get to those returns. I think it's important to point out that we're not chasing returns by setting silly targets. We will get to them and we're very confident that ultimately this business is going to be accretive to the firm's earnings and accretive to the firm's reputation. Mike Carrier And then maybe Harvey, last one on this topic. This is the first time you are really facing consumers and that comes with different risks you know perfectly regulatory risk. So what are the biggest risk factors that you guys see and how are you managing those? Harvey Schwartz Well I think you're right to point that out. This is a new type of engagement with consumers and we do engage consumers everyone knows about our asset management business through GSAM we have through third party distribution millions roughly 5 million of consumers that we deal with. This is new and one of the reasons why we've sort of -- we adopted this mantra very early of we want to crawl before we walk and we want to walk before we run and we didn't set any targets for the business is the best way to ensure that the business is robust sustainable, mitigates risk is to move at a slow pace. Perhaps equally important is the fact that Harit and his team have designed this in a way with consumer input by all the features he went through, no fine print, no fees, the flexibility if we deliver to the consumer we're clearly aligning ourselves with the right regulatory priorities and again it goes back to the white sheet of paper and so you know we don't if you install them [indiscernible] one of the things we agreed on very early with Harit and the team were things like okay, we're not establishing a launch date. The reason we didn't establish a launch date is because a launch date could force you into making decisions around implementation that you otherwise wouldn't want to make without a launch date. Obviously, the team wanted to get to market as quickly as possible but for example one of the things that we demanded of the team very early on was no manual processes anywhere. In the firm, outside and so all these things really contribute to the business being more robust over time and so that's how we thought about the risk factors. And I demanded -- my only creative contribution to the entire project was the phone number but that's probably because I'm 52 and I can't sign -- you can't call anybody but that was my only contribution I think Harit and the team did everything else. Mike Carrier Let's bring it on polling question for the next one and then we'll get into a broader discussion. So what do you think about Goldman's online lending strategy market Marcus by Goldman Sachs. What is positive, you make strategic sense given skillset returns in the business, two, neutral view, a good idea but just more a matter unless there is an inorganic growth and then three, negative view shows the challenges in the core business. And we will give you five seconds. Okay. And results all right so 51% neutral view a good idea but too small to matter unless there is inorganic growth and coming in second is 26% is the positive view make strategic sense, given the skillset and returns to the business. Right. So maybe just a little bit broader Harvey, outside of Marcus how are you thinking about growth across the firm? You just given the environment that we’re in. Harvey Schwartz Well so obviously all this have seen it's been pretty stop and start for the last couple of years and so if you think about the business across the firm in terms of how we're positioned for growth, we feel quite good whether it's in investment banking and there are performance over the last several years, institutional client services and the global strength of both equities and fixed income where the growth we've seen in asset management, where we hit record at US, his past quarter but we've really been very conscious of the fact that this has been a very uneven environment for the last several years. First quarter, a year plus ago. We have a 14.7% ROE, then we have the first quarter of this year and so probably none of that is surprising given the economic environment around the globe for the last couple of years but what we have done during that time period is ensure that our franchises globally are positioned for an improved environment. But again, we have recognized it. So we've talked about all the cost initiatives, you heard about the cost initiatives that we put in place this year with the $700 million of run rate savings that we have executed and obviously we have stayed very, very focused on capital and that has all been about finding the balance so that we are very well-positioned with our clients if the environment improves and we have lots of operating leverage. Look, third-quarter revenue is $8.2 billion. You saw a big uptick in fixed income across the industry, third-quarter not seasonally the strongest. We are able to generate an 11% plus ROE. So I think we feel very well-positioned. The only thing I would add to that too in terms of the positioning is we feel very well-positioned competitively globally. Mike Carrier And then maybe just on the environment, you mentioned 3Q pretty decent trends despite typical seasonality. Has that continued into the fourth quarter in terms of the environment? Harvey Schwartz So the client connectivity feels super strong. I think the world is a little bit uneven obviously but I would say that again the client feels quite good coming into the US elections as is the case in a normal election environment, sort of a bit of a decline in activity levels, that is to be expected. And then obviously as you would expect post the election which I think came as a surprise to obviously all the pollsters and everyone, a big uptick right alongside the election. Now we are only talking about several days but I think that institutional clients, corporations, investors are all reassessing what do these things mean in terms of the long-term forward profile for activities. So we are seeing some of that adjustment. Mike Carrier And then I know it is early but based on the election and some of the policies whether it is on pro-growth or whether it is some rolling back some regulation, how do you think about that for the business in terms of is it more of a potential revenue opportunity? Is it more of an efficiency meaning less cost, you can focus more on innovation? When you look at the environment that we are entering, how do you kind of pull all that together? Harvey Schwartz So why don't I split the question because I think you said how do we think about growth and then how do we think about the regulatory impact and so why don't I just split those two pieces. I think in terms of the growth, the numbers in some of the data have looked better but yet large parts of the world have been in negative interest rate territory for a while and in very low rate policy. And so as we talked about many times, we don't want to view that policy globally or locally certainly as normal and so to the extent to which we can get back to a more normalized rate environment when we are normalized economic growth globally, that should positively correlate for us. And we root for growth. So I think we will see over the next several months and years the extent to which the policies are supportive of growth, it should translate quite well. Now in terms of the regulation, we have talked about this a lot, Mike, the US regulators and the US large financial institutions have done an incredible amount of work since the crisis whether it is on capital, liquidity, clearing, reducing systemic risk, focus on derivative notionals, establishing initial margin rules, all that work has been quite an achievement. We will see but I think it is going to take time in terms of how that evolves. But I think a lot of work has been done and again we will see how this all evolves over the next several years. Mike Carrier And then maybe just on you guys mentioned on the digital side but when you think about technology and where you are investing, how much is it on the regulatory side versus how much is it on the efficiency side versus the innovation side? And so whether it is something like online lending or big data or any of those areas that could potentially drive growth ahead? Harvey Schwartz So when we look at it, we don't really differentiate -- I don't want to put words in your mouth but it almost sounded as though you were saying okay, the regulatory side is about -- almost sounded defensive. And the way we think about deploying the technology really and our skill set, I think most easily described really comes into three ways. There are ways where we think we can just make the Firm better at what it does. So having the one technology platform and the ability to aggregate data should over the long term make us better at being regulatory compliant. It enables us to develop the capital framework that we utilize which we can get into the system early so we get years of knowledge building in the Firm. I don't view those things as defensive. We don't feel complying with regulations in any way as being a defensive thing. We think it is being very proactive. But I would just call those internal investments that allow us to run the Firm as best we possibly can. Then there are -- and all these things overlap. They are not as discreet as I am describing them. Then there is a whole plank for lack of better language which is dedicated to how can we make the client experience better? This would be a fantastic example today of what Harit described by truly bringing together from whole cloth in a white sheet of paper a completely new product which we think differentiates ourselves with consumers. We put a lot of energy into that. And then there are other ways that we utilize technology and as everyone has talked about, we often develop our own technology and then we think it is best developed in the Firm but then we will take it outside of the Firm or we will develop things like Marquis, client interfaces, different than this but along the same plank. And so that is really how the team spends their energy. Mike Carrier Then on a global basis, the US firms have been gaining market share over the past few years. When we look at the revenue side and I don't know if it is maybe where Goldman started from, but it seems like the market share shift is maybe even less pronounced. But just wanted to get a sense, is it from a revenue standpoint or maybe the return standpoint like the business that is coming up for grabs, like is it that attractive? And so where do you see your market share particularly in trading but also on the banking side? Harvey Schwartz I mean on the banking side, I think our investment banking team has done an extraordinary job I think by any measure if you look at over the last several years. If we were sitting here four or five years ago, likely one of the questions would have been okay, smaller firms are coming, boutique firms are coming into M&A and they are going to take lots of market share from firms like Goldman Sachs and what you've actually seen is our market share grow as M&A came back. And so I think when you think about what our investment banking team is able to achieve in terms of their disproportionate market shares across the whole suite of services that they are engaged with corporate clients with, I think we feel quite good about that. I think when you go to areas of the Firm like ICS where not all revenues are created equally because you are making capital commitments very often in the business, we are obviously focused on market share but we are certainly not focused on market share at any cost. You have to think about market share over long periods of time and so we measure it very carefully in the new regulatory world there is more data, you can get more transparency into what your market shares look like. Obviously we engage our clients in live dialogue. I would say we feel quite good about our market shares but we are very focused on the returns over the long run and I think that is why you've been able to see us produce roughly an 11% ROE for four years running which has been at the top under the top of the industry. Mike Carrier Let's throw up one more polling question and then we can open it up for some questions. So what would get you more interested in investing in Goldman's stock? One, a strong revenue backdrop; two, normalizing regulations and ability to return more capital; three, investing to drive improving returns; and four, additional expense reductions? So give you about five seconds here. Okay. The results. So one, 51% of you say a strong revenue backdrop and a close second is to normalizing regulations and an ability to return more capital. So seems to make sense. So let's open it up for some questions from the audience and then we can continue. Question-and-Answer Session Q - Unidentified Analyst So I have a question. So just make sure I understand this. So the loans are fixed-rate, correct? Harvey Schwartz Yes. Unidentified Analyst So having covered financials for 20 years and consumer financials particularly, we have seen debt consolidation schemes in the past where people try to take high revolving debt and consolidate it at a low rate and pick off essentially the best creditworthy customers. And then when we go through a cycle because of the lower rate, you have less cushion from an NIM perspective to absorb higher losses. So I guess my question is what gives you confidence that we are late in the cycle probably that as you go through this and build up these balances that you are going to be able to cherry pick the best credits without running the risk that you are not allowing yourself enough margin expansion when credit starts to inevitably go through a cycle? Harit Talwar So I think that is a great question and you have been covering consumer financial services for 20 years I have been in it for 30 years. I have got enough scars on my back so I agree with you. I think we are very eyes wide-open that we know that we are currently in a relatively benign environment both from a credit and interest perspective for consumer lending and the environment won't continue to be that. And our credit policy, our pricing, our models, we have made sure will deliver sustainable returns through the cycle. We are very particular about that. We are deliberate about that, we are very conscious about that. So yes, there will be cycles. Yes, there will be pressure on net credit margin but we are confident in how we are targeting and how we are underwriting and building the portfolio. The second thing I would say you talked about net interest margin of cards versus loans. Actually at a portfolio level, the net interest margin of cards and the net interest margin of personal loans is remarkably similar. It is at the individual customer level that a customer who is borrowing on cards pays a much higher interest rate because in a card portfolio as you know there are lots of transactors who don't pay any interest and there are lots of introductory balances which don't pay any the interest. Whereas for us in a loan portfolio, we can offer a great deal to the consumer because we don't have to balance off against those parts of the portfolio. Mike Carrier Any other audience questions? Okay. One right here. Unidentified Analyst I guess it is maybe a little of an extension of that previous question. But we have had some of your competitors, Discover as well as obviously OneMain out there with management commentary talking about how there is just way too much access to unsecured credit in the market generally speaking. Obviously it had a significant impact on OneMain. How do you think about that and how are you absolutely sure you are getting the right customers in? Harit Talwar I think it goes back to what Harvey said and I've been saying that we are going to be very deliberate in how we ramp up. I don't want to comment on others but in unsecured consumer lending, sometimes people make mistakes because they are chasing growth to replenish existing runoff and things like that. We are in a great situation where anything we do is incremental building. So that is one. Second, we have already strong differentiated product which differentiates from the two segments Harvey talked about what is sort of called the fintech lenders and the large banks because we can use our balance sheet and our technology. And we do think our brand will help us in selecting a better quality credit quality customer because of the value that we are going to deliver to them. Yes, there is competition, there is commentary. We are very cognizant but we are building it in a very prudent way. Unidentified Analyst You guys invested a lot of time and technology and branding in this effort so presumably it expands beyond just unsecured loans into cars and who knows what else. And I guess at some point the liquidity becomes a bottleneck. So as you think longer-term about expanding this into more and more things, how do you fund that? Harvey Schwartz I'm happy to take that. As of the last quarter we had $214 billion of liquidity on the balance sheet and so from a funding perspective we certainly have the ability to fund the business and grow the business. It is unrelated, doesn't link specifically to this but we acquired the Deposit Platform earlier this year which we would have done regardless of whether or not we were deploying Marcus because we continually focus on just diversifying all the funding sources at the Firm and it just seemed like a perfect way to continue that strategy of diversification. But I think we would be talking about a pretty high-class problem if we were so successful in this space that we were feeling funding constrained. And I think most importantly because of the dynamic nature of the way we manage capital and liquidity in the Firm, if we felt like the greatest need from a client perspective was to fund this business, then we would figure out how to deploy those resources to this business. But I think where we stand today that would be a pretty high-class outcome. Unidentified Analyst I guess the essence of the question was [indiscernible] long term how comfortably funding [indiscernible]? Harvey Schwartz Well, this business sits in the bank so currently funded with deposits but it could be funded with wholesale funding also. The economic works. That is why I was trying to draw the distinction between the acquisition of the Deposit Platform in this. But we could fund this with -- certainly we could fund this with wholesale funding three, four, five, 10 year funding. The economics work. Mike Carrier Any others in the audience? Unidentified Analyst Just with respect to your commentary about some of the smaller firms and boutiques, there was a proposed merger of a couple of them yesterday out there. Is that something that you see going on a going forward basis given the new environment and at some point do merged boutiques start to take on enough critical mass that you have to rethink how you think about them competitively? Harvey Schwartz I don't want to say -- look, in all of our businesses regardless of what part of the Firm, we are always looking at the competitors, thinking about the competitors but really get the end of the day the most valuable thing you gain from looking at the competitors are looking at where do you think they are doing things strategically that you could learn from and where are they making mistakes that you could learn from and hopefully avoid? And I am assuming that everybody looks at Goldman Sachs that way in terms of the competitive basket. We have 100+ years in the investment banking business and I think what gives us the performance that we have in these kinds of cycles is that commitment to the clients. I told this story before, I have never told it in a large group but I worked in banking over a decade ago for a period of time and there was a large merger announced and I went up to the banker working on the transaction and I said just out of curiosity, how long were you working on that transaction? And he said, I think I had my first conversation with the Board seven years ago. So staying committed to the client, being in the Board room, working with the client over long evolution, that is what really differentiates you in the business. I think if firms feel like they can have a better presence by consolidating, they will consolidate. We will be successful if we stick to our strategy of being the most valued advisor in terms of the guidance we give those clients when they are making the most important decisions. I think that will ultimately drive what differentiates firms and I think that is what has driven our differentiation. Mike Carrier Any others? I have one or two more. So first on Brexit, that kind of came and went. Just wanted to get your sense when you think about it from like either a competitive standpoint or a cost standpoint if it is a hard or a soft Brexit, how are you looking at the options for Goldman? Harvey Schwartz Look, you have heard us say a number of times we are contingency planners so this falls into the contingency planning bucket. It is very difficult at this stage given we are so early in the process how it will evolve. The most important thing about all of our contingency planning is that we ensure that we are maintaining our presence in Europe and we are able to be completely as committed in the future as we are today to all of those clients across Europe. Obviously it is an incredibly important geography for us and so we are very, very focused on it. We have made no decisions. Periodically you will see things in the press, that is not accurate. We have made no decisions with respect to Brexit, we are not moving any people. We are focused with everyone involved in terms of the process that we can aid as constructively as possible in ensuring that the process has a smooth transition and that is on the one thing we think is obviously critical. But I don't think that is a unique thought. Mike Carrier And maybe last one. The industry has gone through a ton of change the past seven, eight years and everybody has been managing cost, headcount, technology, but culture and particularly for Goldman just given what the business is and where a lot of the changes have taken place, it is always a question, tough to gauge. But how are you managing that? Has it changed significantly at the Firm? Harvey Schwartz No. I think one of the things that we spend the most time talking about with our partners really and the leadership of the Firm is how do we protect those things that are best about the Firm and best about the culture. We just announced partners last week and I can tell you that that partner process was as disciplined, teeth gnashing, people were passionate as they ever have been. And so I think it starts there but it extends very far down in terms of we have to stay investing in our people, we have to be a leader in how we do that and if that is the case, we will continue to attract the best and the brightest that want to come to our industry. And so far look, touch wood, we are never complacent about it but so far we have been able to do that. So we feel good about it. But it is a relentless commitment. Mike Carrier Any final questions in the audience? Okay. We will wrap it there. We will have a breakout session in Alcove on this floor. I just want to thank Harvey and Harit for their time.

      "text": "NEW YORK Evercore's two chairmen are an enviable problem. Wooing former Goldman Sachs partner John Weinberg is a coup for the $2.9 billion advisory firm. Making him executive chairman, though, muddies governance and creates top-heavy management.\nWeinberg will take on the title held until now by Roger Altman, who is staying on in the newly created role of senior chairman. Evercore's founder will also continue to advise clients. Meanwhile, Roger Schlosstein remains chief executive, meaning Evercore will have three top managers responsible for dealing with both clients and company strategy.\nWeinberg will also become chairman of the board, where his task of representing shareholders may create a conflict with his day-to-day job of bringing in deals. Though keeping the chairman and CEO roles separate is a plus, his arrival means there will be three insiders on what will become a 10-person board.\nThese ought to be manageable issues. After all, advising on mergers and acquisitions is as much about personalities as finance; turmoil at the top of an advisory firm is simply bad for business. Altman, Schlosstein and Weinberg will not want to risk the firm's current performance. Evercore's stock is the best performing of its peers, up 19 percent this year. Advisory revenue grew by one-third in the first nine months of 2016, outpacing the competition. Goldman's M&A income fell almost 14 percent over the same period.\nThe hope is that Weinberg, who spent three decades at Goldman before retiring last year, will help propel Evercore even further. Top U.S. companies including General Electric, Ford and Visa have turned to him for advice over the years. And his family pedigree is second to none.\nHis grandfather Sidney Weinberg ran Goldman for almost 40 years until 1969 and was dubbed \"Mr. Wall Street.\" His father and uncle both occupied senior positions at the firm, as did his cousin Peter, who a decade ago set up the Perella Weinberg boutique. Rivals can only wish they had to deal with the dilemma of squeezing John Weinberg into the corporate hierarchy.\nThe views expressed in this article are not those of Reuters News.",

      "text": "New York : Wondering how to invest in a year marked by President-elect Donald Trump’s inauguration, China’s attempts to keep growth both high and sustainable, and the continued rise of populism in Europe?\nGoldman Sachs Group Inc. has got you covered, with a team led by co-head of Global Macro and Markets Francesco Garzarelli releasing its first set of top trade recommendations for 2017 in a note to clients.\nSome of these six trades are a continuation of existing high conviction calls from the bank; others are fresh ideas.\nA warning: the recent track record for Goldman’s year-ahead trade ideas has been less than stellar.\nAmid the market turmoil that characterized the start of 2016, the bank was stopped out of five of its six recommended top trades before Valentine’s Day.\n1. US dollar the winner from developed market populism\nRemember the much-ballyhooed divergence trade that was among the most consensus calls of 2016? It’s back — but with a twist. The rationale for this trade is now grounded in political considerations; chiefly, the populist tide sweeping the globe.\n“In the US, events have moved in a US dollar-positive direction, between the rising likelihood of fiscal stimulus, more protectionism and immigration controls, all of which add up to a more inflationary mix and tighter-than-otherwise monetary policy setting,” the team writes. “In Europe, ongoing uncertainty over the Brexit process will likely weigh on the pound, while the slew of elections, including the Italian political fallout after the constitutional referendum on 4 December and general elections in France, Germany and the Netherlands, will weigh on the euro.”\nThe strategists are targeting 10% upside in the US dollar relative to an equal-weighted basket of the euro and pound, and would exit the position if the trade went against them by 5%. This would entail the euro falling to parity against the greenback, and the pound sinking to 1.14 on a 12-month horizon.\nThe primary risks to the trade would be tapering from the European Central Bank and a delay in triggering Article 50 to begin the Brexit process.\n2. Bet on Donald Trump getting more upset about China’s currency\nGoldman sees Beijing’s policy of managed depreciation versus the US dollar continuing in 2017. The strategists advise going long the 12-month non-deliverable forward contract, which calls for the US dollar to hit 7.07 Chinese yuan, looking for it to move to 7.30. The team would cut the position if the contract fell to 6.75.\n“The fundamental dilemma of China’s currency regime is that, in an environment of a rising dollar, keeping the CFETS basket stable requires $/CNY to move higher meaningfully, which carries the risk that capital outflows re-escalate,” the team writes. “Our base case is one where the $/CNY fix continues to grind higher, driven by domestic pressures and in the context of a stronger dollar.”\nThe dollar has gained 7.5% against the yuan over the past year; the rate of appreciation required to hit 7.30 would actually imply a smaller move for the greenback over the next twelve months.\n3. Keep calm and carry the right EM currencies\nThe strategists recommend going long an equal-weighted basket of the Brazilian real, Russian ruble, Indian rupee, and South African rand against the South Korean won and Singapore dollar, two currencies often used as proxies by investors looking for another way to get short exposure to China.\n“The expected return, including approximately 7% carry (on an annual basis) and 7% price return, is around 14%,” writes Garzarelli.\nIn the aftermath of the US election, some of these relatively higher-yielding currencies have been indiscriminately battered amid the selloff of emerging market assets, making it a good time to initiate long positions.\n“The countries represented on the long side of our FX basket also have more limited exposure to US trade/demand risks if the protectionist rhetoric from President-elect Trump is transformed into action,” the strategists add.\n4. Long EM stocks with “insulated exposure to growth”\n“Looking across the EM equity spectrum, we find that Brazil, Poland and India offer an ‘insulated exposure’ to the EM growth recovery story, without being particularly exposed to China growth or US trade policy,” the team writes.\nGoldman recommends buying an equal-weighted, currency unhedged basket composed of the Warsaw Stock Exchange Total Return Index, the Ibovespa Brasil Sao Paulo Stock Exchange Index, and the NSE Nifty 50 Index, looking for a gain of 20% and bowing out if the position falls 10% from current levels.\n5. The reflation trade has legs\nWhoops! This is the same position Goldman recommended at this time last year, which quickly fizzled out.\nStrategists are once again advising investors to go long 10-year US break-even inflation (derived from the gap between nominal and inflation-protected Treasury yields). The team expects the spread between nominal and inflation-protected Treasury yields to rise to 230 basis points, and would exit the position if it fell to 160 basis points.\nThis time, they’re also recommending a version of the same trade for inflation in Europe, using swaps. “We think there is scope for the ‘reflation’ trade to perform better in 2017 for a combination of factors,” the team writes, citing firming energy prices, the end of austerity, and central banks’ likely tolerance of above-target inflation.\n6. Long European dividend growth\nGoldman’s final top trade recommendation for the year ahead: go long European dividend growth by way of the Euro Stoxx 50 2018 dividend futures in a currency-hedged position. “Dividend swaps, as a hybrid between credit and equities, currently appear attractive in a cross-asset context,” writes Garzarelli. “We forecast a high ‘carry’ compared with other assets, which reflect both fundamental risks and supply/demand imbalances from structured products issuance.”\nSince 2018 isn’t too far away, the trade doesn’t have a ton of duration risk, and visibility into dividend growth should come quickly — according to the team, 70 to 80% of payouts in Europe are usually announced at the end of the first quarter.\n“Shorter-dated dividends are less driven by changes in equity valuations and more closely linked to underlying earnings and cash flows,” the strategists explain. “Despite little earnings growth in 2016, EURO STOXX 50 2017 dividends delivered a return of 6% with a volatility of 7% year-to-date.”\nThis index is currently trading at 112. Goldman is targeting a rise to 125, and would close the position if it fell to 105. Bloomberg",

That places him in the top 10 percent of all Wall Street analysts covering any industry.",

      "text": "By Ben Levisohn Shares of Goldman Sachs ( GS ) are trading higher this morning after Macquarie analysts David Konrad and Jack Walsh upgraded its shares to Outperform from Neutral. They explain why:\nGetty Images We are upgrading Goldman Sachs to Outperform as the stock is trading at a 7% discount on 2017e and in line with peers on P/TBV despite consistently reporting an above peer ROTCE. Although more traditional lenders may benefit more from the steepening of the curve , we believe Goldman Sachs has more earnings levers than peers, should fiscal stimulus and lower corporate taxes help increase economic activity driving better earnings leverage for the leading global adviser in M&A and a leader in ECM. As a result, we are nearly $2.00 above consensus in 2018. Moreover, we believe Goldman Sachs will achieve an improved valuation owing to a business mix shifting from Investing & Lending and toward Investment Banking and Asset Management.\nShares of Goldman Sachs have gained 1% to $211.75 at 11:03 a.m. today, while the SPDR S&P Bank ETF ( KBE ) has advanced 0.4% to $40.32.",

      "text": "Source: Thinkstock In what was one of the wildest weeks of 2016, investors were out in full force buying stocks, and that was something that had insiders waiting to sell shares licking their chops. With the third-quarter earnings parade over, many of the windows prohibiting insider trades are opening back up, and the positive markets and extreme liquidity made the timing perfect for those selling.\nWe cover insider selling every week at 24/7 Wall St., and we like to remind our readers that just because an individual or 10% institutional owner sells stock, that is no cause for immediate alarm. Many top executives, and even directors, are compensated with stock and often sell just to diversify portfolios or purchase other assets.\nHere are companies that reported insider selling last week.\nPlatform Specialty Products Corp. (NYSE: PAH) had a well-known seller parting with a huge chunk of stock. Bill Ackman’s Pershing Square hedge fund sold a total of 2,285,888 shares of the stock at $8.78 apiece. The total for the sale was posted at $20 million. The company produces and sells specialty chemical products in the Americas, the Asia-Pacific and Europe. The stock closed last Friday at $8.52.\nInsperity Inc. (NYSE: NSP) also had a large-scale seller on the desk, and it was another well-known hedge fund. Value Act, which also serves as a director at the company, sold a total of 226,000 shares of the stock at prices that ranged from $71.22 to $72.41. The total for the sale was set at $16 million. Insperity provides an array of human resources and business solutions to enhance business performance for small and medium-sized businesses in the United States. The shares closed the day on Friday at $71.85.\nCharles Schwab Corp. (NYSE: SCHW) also had a famous investor selling stock this past week. The chairman of the company, Charles Schwab, continues to sell stock at an orderly pace. This week the iconic discount brokerage executive and the CEO of the company combined to sell a block of 400,000 shares at prices between $35.43 and $35.46. The total for the trades came to a whopping $14 million. As we have noted in the past, Mr. Schwab is past 80 years old, and clearly much of his selling over the years has been for estate planning purposes. The shares ended Friday at $37.48 so a fair amount left on the table.\nF5 Networks Inc. (NASDAQ: FFIV) had the CEO at the company selling some stock this past week. John McAdam parted with 16,898 shares at prices that ranged from $138.47 to $141.54. The total for the sale was posted at $2 million. The company develops, markets and sells application delivery networking products that optimize the security, performance and availability of network applications, servers and storage systems. The shares closed Friday at $142.01, so a touch left on the table here as well.\nGoldman Sachs Group Inc. (NYSE: GS) had an executive vice president at the Wall Street giant selling some stock this week. That executive sold 24,509 shares of the stock at prices that ranged from $203.49 to $203.54. The total for the sale was set at $5 million. Note that the share price at the end of the week was $210.35.\nThese companies also reported insider selling last week: Aetna Inc. (NYSE: AET), Cullen/Frost Bankers Inc. (NYSE: CFR), Rockwell Automation Inc. (NYSE: ROK), Stamps.com (NASDAQ: STMP) and Western Alliance Bancorporation (NYSE: WAL).\nI'm interested in the Newsletter Get Newsletter \nterms and conditions   While the selling definitely picked up last week, the volume was still less than the buying — at least it appeared that way. Insider selling at current levels, especially with 2016 drawing to a close, is not surprising to us.",

      "text": "Shares 0 Michael Sherwood and Richard Gnodde (Goldman Sachs) \nMichael Sherwood, Goldman’s co-chief of European operations, is calling it quits . Taking over the London office now is the yin to his yang, the Buzz to his Woody , the Thin Dick to his Fat Mike : Richard Gnodde. \nWhile Sherwood is seen as a brash, no-bullshit kind of bloke – an enforcer – the South African born Gnodde has been described as tall and suave, if lacking in charming nicknames. “He looks, and talks, like he has stepped out of a 1970s men’s knitwear catalogue,” the Sunday Times wrote of him in 2009. \nSherwood rose to prominence in the rough-and-tumble of the London debt market of the late 1980s and 1990s. Gnodde came up in the cool, diplomatic world of M&A, first in Goldman’s Asian operations and later in London. \nThe transition reflects the evolution of the investment banking business, as advisory work has picked up the slack dropped by trading units curtailed by regulations. “A part of winning back trust for the financial sector is showing itself to be of great value, rather than a source of excessive risk,” Gnodde said in 2011. \nGnodde’s magnum opus was advising steel titan Lakshmi Mittal’s big-dollar takeover of Arcelor in 2006. Mittal is just one of Gnodde’s notable chums; he’s also reported to be friendly with ex-Bank of England Governor Mervyn King and former BP chief Lord Browne of Madingley. \nGnodde’s ascent could also hint toward a Post-Brexit Goldman. The bank hinted that the referendum’s success could mean more operations in continental Europe. Gnodde, for his part, apparently has a taste for Frankfurt . Shares 0",

      "text": "  How far can the dollar 'reset' go? What is the trade? - Goldman Sachs Mon 21 Nov 2016 19:22:54 GMT Author: Goldman Sachs on the US dollar \nIn our last FX Views, we argued that the US election represents a \"reset\" for two reasons. \nFirst, the possibility of meaningful fiscal stimulus in an economy where slack is close to zero raises upward pressure on inflation, as Chair Yellen and NY Fed President Dudley acknowledged this week. \nSecond, President-elect Trump can make a number of appointments to the Fed in fairly short order, which could shift the reaction function hawkish. Both things have pushed front-end interest rates up (Exhibit 2), and the Dollar is now near the top of the range it has traded in since March 2015 \nAs in 2014, when the Dollar was on the move, the question is now how much further it can go in the near term. Federal funds futures are one lens through which to look at this. They have obviously moved a lot, but the market in our view is still catching up to the changed landscape. The market is pricing 64 bps in tightening through 2017, well below our US team's forecast of 100 bps. More importantly, through end-2019 the market is pricing 130 bps, or just over five hikes.This strikes us as low and points to further upside for the Dollar, including in the near term. \nWe are through our year-end targets for EUR/$ (1.08) and $/JPY (108), which were controversial just a short time ago, and the risk to our 12-month forecasts - 1.00 for EUR/$ and 115 for $/JPY - is now firmly in the direction of more Dollar strength. \nSterling downside has fallen out of favor, but we think remains one of the most actionable themes. This is why we went short Sterling and the Euro against the Dollar as one of our Top Trades for 2017. \n...By choosing to also include EUR on the short leg of the trade, we are essentially taking an agnostic view with regard to EUR/GBP. Indeed, our new EUR/GBP forecast is 0.90, 0.88 and 0.88 in 3-, 6- and 12-months. The slew of elections slated to take place across Europe this year present a number of catalysts for the trade, and we have kept our call for EUR/USD parity on a 12-month horizon unchanged. Given that the ECB is so far from its inflation target, it should not respond to any rising inflationary pressures in the same way as the Fed, although premature tapering from the ECB is a risk to the trade.

      "title": "Goldman Sachs's Michael Sherwood to leave after 30 years",
      "text": "Goldman Sachs's Michael Sherwood to leave after 30 years By Dakin Campbell, Bloomberg Published: November 21, 2016 2:44 PM CDT Updated: November 21, 2016 3:06 PM CDT 0 shares facebook twitter email comments × \nGoldman Sachs Group Inc. said Michael Sherwood, co-chief executive officer of the firm's European operation, will leave the company at year's end. \nRichard Gnodde, 56, will take over as CEO of Goldman Sachs International, the New York-based company said Monday in an internal memo. Sherwood, who's been at the firm for 30 years, will become a senior director. \n\"Michael worked closely with many of our corporate, asset-management and investing clients,\" CEO Lloyd Blankfein and President Gary Cohn said in the memo. \"His understanding of corporate strategy combined with a deep sense of the longer-term structural forces shaping markets and economies were the basis for his innovative thinking across industries and products.\" \nSherwood, 51, has been a vice chairman since 2008 and co-CEO of Goldman Sachs International since 2005, according to the memo. He's also a member of the management committee, co-chairman of the European-management committee, and chairman of the growth-markets executive group. He once was chairman of the powerful partnership committee, charged with overseeing the naming of new partners, and the business-standards committee. \nThe Financial Times reported Sherwood's departure earlier Monday. \nIn an interview, Sherwood said he was ready to slow down, disconnect from the bank and spend more time investing his own money and pursuing philanthropic interests. He said he's known little else since joining Goldman Sachs when he was 20, and doesn't own a personal e-mail address or have a home office. \n\"I've got so many other interests and I want to do other things with my life,\" he said. \"If I told you I hadn't had 10 days off in a row in 31 years, you would have thought I was a complete nut. But that's sort of what's it's been for me.\" \nSherwood said the hardest part of the decision was telling Blankfein, whom he said he considers a close friend. Blankfein was trying to persuade him to change his mind as recently as Sunday, he said. \nSherwood attracted attention in June when he testified at a U.K. parliamentary hearing on the collapse of failed British retailer BHS Ltd. Lawmakers were examining the role Goldman Sachs played in advising billionaire Philip Green in his sale of the chain to former race-car driver Dominic Chappell. Sherwood, who said Goldman doesn't accept any blame for the retailer's subsequent demise, said he regretted not keeping a more thorough paper trail over the bank's role. \nSherwood was named a partner in 1994, the same year as Cohn and Steven Mnuchin, U.S. president-elect Donald Trump's campaign finance chair now under consideration for Treasury secretary. \nThe executive benefited from becoming one of the firm's youngest partners years before it went public and from the stock's tripling since then. Including shares he owns or has sold, options he's exercised, cash rewards in the past two years, and proceeds from his investments in the firm's own private-equity funds, Sherwood has reaped more than $300 million before taxes, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. \nThis is at least the second time Sherwood has left the company. In 1994, he resigned to join Swiss securities firm CBI-UBP International. Articles at the time said he and a colleague had tired of the high-stress atmosphere at Goldman Sachs. Sherwood married in 1993, and was still putting in more than 60 hours a week. The quiet life of Swiss private banking appealed to him. \nA month later, he returned to Goldman Sachs, telling International Financing Review magazine that he'd missed \"the buzz and excitement.\" \nAnother reversal seems unlikely. \n\"There is a time in life when you decide and you sort of know,\" he said Monday. \"I have been wrestling with it for quite a while and it's time for younger people with more energy to take the mantle.\" \n(c) 2016, Bloomberg Subscribe to NewsOK's Business Headlines Stay up to date with business news in Oklahoma and around the country.

      "text": "211.08 USD \nIt's the end of an era. Veteran London banker Michael Sherwood is leaving Goldman Sachs. \nIt doesn't feel like a victory lap -- more like the end of a 30-year career that mirrors the rise of star bond traders, complex credit derivatives and ever-swelling bonuses. And their sunset. \nSince 2005, Sherwood has been the co-CEO of Goldman Sachs International, the U.S. firm's European operation. He told Bloomberg News in an interview on Monday he was ready to slow down, spend more time investing his money and pursue philanthropic interests. \nThe 51-year-old's most recent public appearance this year may have contributed. He had to apologize to British lawmakers over his firm's involvement in the sale of failed retailer BHS. Speaking to the FT, he denied it played a part in his decision, calling it \"one blip\" in a three-decade career. \nBut it wasn't just BHS. Brexit is likely to have come as a blow to Sherwood, who campaigned to remain in the EU. For a banker who began his career just as the City of London cut red tape and opened its doors to new stars, presiding over its disintegration can't have been an appetizing prospect. \nJobs could be tempted away to Luxembourg, Dublin or even New York. Brexit means more compliance, more contingency planning, more employee shuffling and more cost-cutting. End of an Era Front-office headcount at the top global investment banks as tracked by Coalition Source: Coalition \nSherwood is a reminder of the rollicking past of U.S. investment banks in the 1980s and 1990s. A 1993 profile in the U.K.'s Independent newspaper described him as a rising star who \"flabbergasted\" bond markets and gloated about his best deals. He drove a Porsche and bought the best theater tickets -- but would leave the show early if \"bored.\" \nThe future isn't quite as exciting for fixed-income specialists. \nThe sell-off in bond markets, described as a \"Great Rotation\" out of stocks, is being hailed as the end of a 30-year bull run. Even if the election of Donald Trump heralds the prospect of a roll-back of financial regulation, it will be hard to make a case for the glory days of prop trading making a return anytime soon. \nAnd as well-connected, reputed and respected Sherwood is, it's hard to say he represents the future of Goldman. \nThis year, the bank started a consumer online lending platform called Marcus. The firm is experimenting with new blockchain technology and using its own research on hedge funds as the basis for an exchange-traded fund. \nGoldman CEO Lloyd Blankfein described the bank as a technology firm last year, and it's no surprise to see specialists like chief information officer Marty Chavez in the ascendant. Faced with a future of blockchains and Brexit, it's no wonder Sherwood was ready to call it a day.

      "title": "Goldman Sachs' Sherwood leaving after 30 years",
      "text": "Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said Michael Sherwood, co-chief executive officer of the firm's European operation, will leave the company at year's end.\nRichard Gnodde, 56, will take over as CEO of Goldman Sachs International, the New York-based company said Monday in an internal memo. Sherwood, who's been at the firm for 30 years, will become a senior director.\n\"Michael worked closely with many of our corporate, asset-management and investing clients,\" CEO Lloyd Blankfein and President Gary Cohn said in the memo. \"His understanding of corporate strategy combined with a deep sense of the longer-term structural forces shaping markets and economies were the basis for his innovative thinking across industries and products.\"\nVIDEOS TOP JOBS Sherwood, 51, has been a vice chairman since 2008 and co-CEO of Goldman Sachs International since 2005, according to the memo. He's also a member of the management committee, co-chairman of the European-management committee, and chairman of the growth-markets executive group. He once was chairman of the powerful partnership committee, charged with overseeing the naming of new partners, and the business-standards committee.\nThe Financial Times reported Sherwood's departure earlier Monday.\nIn an interview, Sherwood said he was ready to slow down, disconnect from the bank and spend more time investing his own money and pursuing philanthropic interests. He said he's known little else since joining Goldman Sachs when he was 20, and doesn't own a personal e-mail address or have a home office.\n\"I've got so many other interests and I want to do other things with my life,\" he said. \"If I told you I hadn't had 10 days off in a row in 31 years, you would have thought I was a complete nut. But that's sort of what's it's been for me.\"\nSherwood said the hardest part of the decision was telling Blankfein, whom he said he considers a close friend. Blankfein was trying to persuade him to change his mind as recently as Sunday, he said.\nSherwood attracted attention in June when he testified at a U.K. parliamentary hearing on the collapse of failed British retailer BHS Ltd. Lawmakers were examining the role Goldman Sachs played in advising billionaire Philip Green in his sale of the chain to former race-car driver Dominic Chappell. Sherwood, who said Goldman doesn't accept any blame for the retailer's subsequent demise, said he regretted not keeping a more thorough paper trail over the bank's role.\nSherwood was named a partner in 1994, the same year as Cohn and Steven Mnuchin, U.S. president-elect Donald Trump's campaign finance chair now under consideration for Treasury secretary.\nThe executive benefited from becoming one of the firm's youngest partners years before it went public and from the stock's tripling since then. Including shares he owns or has sold, options he's exercised, cash rewards in the past two years, and proceeds from his investments in the firm's own private-equity funds, Sherwood has reaped more than $300 million before taxes, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\nThis is at least the second time Sherwood has left the company. In 1994, he resigned to join Swiss securities firm CBI-UBP International. Articles at the time said he and a colleague had tired of the high-stress atmosphere at Goldman Sachs. Sherwood married in 1993, and was still putting in more than 60 hours a week. The quiet life of Swiss private banking appealed to him.\nA month later, he returned to Goldman Sachs, telling International Financing Review magazine that he'd missed \"the buzz and excitement.\"\nAnother reversal seems unlikely.\n\"There is a time in life when you decide and you sort of know,\" he said Monday. \"I have been wrestling with it for quite a while and it's time for younger people with more energy to take the mantle.\"",

      "text": "Click here to download for free What is next for zinc? \nGoldman Sachs said in a note earlier this month that it expected zinc to outperform aluminium and copper over the next six to nine months. \nAnalysts led by Jeff Currie said on Monday: “The recent re-acceleration in global PMIs (purchasing managers’ indexes) suggests commodity markets are entering a cyclically stronger environment, \n“Supply restrictions from policy actions should benefit oil, coking coal and nickel in the near term while economic reductions should boost natural gas and zinc.” \nThis week, the bank upgraded its rating on basic materials to overweight for the first time in four years. Zinc stocks trending upward \nSeveral zinc producers have been on a steady upward trend, year to date: Teck Resources (TSX: TCK.B , NYSE:TCK ), owner of the Red Dog mine in Alaska, is up 555 percent; Glencore (LON: GLEN ) is up 218 percent; Hindustan Zinc (BSE: 500188 ), owner of the Rampura Agucha mine in India, is up by 85 percent; Trevali Mining (TSX: TV ), owner of two commercially producing operations in Canada, is up by 168 percent; and Pasinex Resources (CNSX: PSE ), 50 percent owner of the producing Pinargozu zinc mine in Turkey, is up 100 percent. \nAs well, several zinc-focused explorers have also enjoyed a three-digit lift in their stocks, year to date: Arizona Mining (TSX: AZ ) is up 869 percent, Thunderstruck Resources (TSXV: AWE ) is up 200 percent, InZinc Mining (TSXV: IZN ) is up 161 percent, and Canadian Zinc (TSX: CZN ) is up 133 percent. \n\n  @INN_Resource for real-time news updates! \n  Priscila Barrera,   \nEditorial Disclosure: Trevali Mining, Arizona Mining, Thunderstruck Resources, Pasinex Resources are clients of the Investing News Network.

      "text": "Market Challenge: Watching OPEC (Seeking Alpha) \nGoldman Sachs’ Neil Mehta believes   offers “compelling relative and absolute valuation, especially given share price underperformance in 2016.” \nMehta upgraded the rating on the company from Neutral to Buy, while raising the price target from $47 to $54. Value Opportunity \nThe analyst believes ConocoPhillips offers the most attractive free cash flow yield among its large cap U.S. majors and E&P peers. \nThe company’s capex is expected to remain low, while oil prices are expected to normalize over 2017-2020 to above $50/bbl WTI. \nMehta sees the company as “a solid capital allocation story, with COP growing the dividend, reducing its share count and paying down debt, partly through asset sale proceeds.” Capital Returns \nConocoPhillips underperformed during 2016, largely due to its 66 percent dividend cut. However, capital returns are expected to grow again in 2017–2018, with annual dividend growth of 5–10 percent and share buyback of $1 billion per year. \n“There remains skepticism about COP’s ability to execute its $5–$8 billion asset sale program by YE2017, based on investor conversations. That said, we see this level as achievable given the company’s track record of asset sale success, particularly in natural gas,” the analyst went on to say. \nDespite the capital spending of only $5 billion, Mehta believes the company could grow its production each year through the end of the decade. \nAt last check, ConocoPhillips shares were up 2.03 percent at $46.68. The United States Oil Fund LP (ETF) (NYSE: USO ) was also up, moving upward by 1.45 percent, and seen at $10.48. \nImage Credit: By Knudsens Fotosenter / DEXTRA Photo [CC BY 4.0], via Wikimedia Commons Latest Ratings for COP",

Three factors drive our upgrade: (1) ConocoPhillips offers the most attractive free cash flow yield among large cap US majors/E&Ps, as we expect capex to stay low and 2017-2020 oil prices to normalize to above $50/bbl WTI; (2) we see a solid capital allocation story , with ConocoPhillips growing the dividend, reducing its share count and paying down debt, partly through asset sale proceeds; and (3) ConocoPhillips offers compelling relative and absolute valuation, especially given share price underperformance in 2016 (lagging Energy Select Sector SPDR ETF ( XLE ) by 22% YTD).\nShares of ConocoPhillips have gained 2% to $46.66 at 10:24 a.m. today, while the Energy Select Sector SPDR ETF has dipped 0.1% to $72.63.",

      "text": "\n© 2016 Time Inc. All rights reserved. Donald Trump Meets with Goldman Sachs’ Second Highest Executive \nDonald Trump may be thinking of adding a key member of the great vampire squid to his presidential cabinet. \nGoldman Sachs gs president and chief operating officer Gary Cohn, who is only second to CEO Lloyd Blankfein, is set to meet with the president-elect in New York on Tuesday. Cohn is the latest business leader to make a trip to Trump Tower following the elections to either offer advice or discuss a potential seat in Trump’s cabinet, Sean Spicer said on a conference call with reporters Tuesday. It is unclear if 56-year-old Cohn is in the running for a cabinet position or if he is there to advise. \nThe high-profile Wall Street executive has been with Goldman Sachs for roughly 26 years, and has also been rumored to be Blankfein’s successor should he step down. Cohn started at Goldman in the 1990s, working in the commodities trading unit. He gained oversight in Goldman’s mortgage unit in 2000, and pushed the desk to increase risk-taking in the years leading up to the financial crisis, according to Bloomberg . \nAlthough the president-elect heavily criticized Wall Street on the campaign trail , he has considered picking a handful of financial industry leaders to be in his cabinet. Trump’s campaign finance chairman and the top contender for treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin , is a Goldman Sachs alumus, as is chief strategist Steve Bannon . Trump first considered J.P. Morgan Chase’s jpm Jamie Dimon for treasury secretary before Dimon turned him down . \n\nInvestors are expecting Trump’s presidency to be friendly to Wall Street . The Keefe Bruyette and Woods Nasdaq Bank Index has risen 14.3% since election day earlier this month, as investors piled into the financial industry. Trump has voiced plans to deregulate Wall Street, such as pulling back on the Dodd-Frank act, while his promise to build more infrastructures is expected to result in further interest rate hikes. Both moves should help the banks boost their revenue and bottom line. ",

REUTERS/Carlo Allegri - RTX2TV5T Don't miss stories. Follow Raw Story! Follow @rawstory \nPresident-elect Donald Trump is expected to name former Goldman Sachs partner and Hollywood financier Steven Mnuchin as his nominee for Treasury secretary, a source said on Tuesday, putting a Wall Street veteran in the top U.S. economic Cabinet post for the first time in eight years. \nMnuchin, who was Trump’s presidential campaign finance chairman, could be named as early as Wednesday, said a Republican source close to the decision. \nMnuchin was chosen over several high-profile candidates, including JPMorgan Chase Chairman Jamie Dimon and Republican Representative Jeb Hensarling, chairman of the powerful House Financial Services Committee. \nMnuchin is the first person with Wall Street experience to head the Treasury since his former boss, Henry Paulson, the former Goldman Sachs CEO who served under President George W. Bush and steered Treasury through the chaotic initial stages of the 2008-2009 financial crisis. \nThe selection of Mnuchin was first reported by The New York Times. \nA relatively little-known but successful private equity investor and hedge fund manager, Mnuchin spent 17 years at Goldman Sachs before leaving in 2002, when he launched Dune Capital Management. \nWith Dune, Mnuchin has invested in movies produced by Rupert Murdoch’s 20th Century Fox and Time Warner Inc’s Warner Bros, including blockbusters “Avatar,”“Mad Max: Fury Road” and “Suicide Squad.” \nACQUIRED FAILED BANK \nThe son of a Goldman Sachs partner who became an art dealer, Mnuchin worked hard to step outside his father’s shadow and make a name for himself, former colleagues said, rising to become the firm’s chief information officer in 1999. \n“He wanted to prove that he was there on the merits,” said a former Goldman colleague, who spoke on condition of anonymity. \nMnuchin’s experience running Goldman’s mortgage-backed bond trading desk would later prove valuable when an opportunity arose in 2009 to buy the deeply discounted assets of failed California mortgage lender IndyMac Bank from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation during the financial crisis. \nHe assembled an investor group that included hedge fund manager John Paulson to buy the assets for $1.55 billion, and moved to Los Angeles. \nAfter rebranding the operation OneWest Bank, Mnuchin built it with other assets and professional sports team sponsorships into Southern California’s largest bank, with 73 branches and $23 billion in assets. His group sold OneWest to CIT Group Inc last year for $3.4 billion. \nBut the bank came under fire for its foreclosure practices as housing advocacy groups accused it of being too quick to foreclose on struggling homeowners. In 2011, dozens of demonstrators descended on Mnuchin’s $26.5 million home in the wealthy Bel Air neighborhood to protest OneWest’s eviction tactics, according to the Los Angeles Times. \nThis month, two housing groups filed a complaint asking the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development to investigate complaints that OneWest engaged in discriminatory “redlining” practices against black and Latino communities. \nAlthough Mnuchin has a reputation for being a behind-the-scenes player in Hollywood, he does appear on screen in the 2016 film “Rules Don’t Apply,” according to the IMDB movie database. The drama, opening in theaters Nov. 23, stars Warren Beatty, who also wrote and directed the film. \n(Additional reporting by Steve Holland, Svea Herbst and Lisa Richwine; Editing by Alistair Bell, Mary Milliken and Jonathan Oatis) About the Author Reuters.com brings you the latest news from around the world, covering breaking news in business, politics, technology, and more.

      "text": "For a moment earlier today, it looked like the president of Goldman Sachs had entered the picture as a dark-horse candidate for Treasury. Turns out it was a false alarm. We’re getting a guy who merely worked at Goldman for 17 years instead.\nHe’ll join Steve Bannon, another former Goldman employee, in the highest ranks of Trump’s administration, less than two months after Trump delivered a stemwinder on the trail aimed at Clinton for colluding with “international banks.” Consider this swamp drained :\nMr. Mnuchin, 53, was the national finance chairman for Mr. Trump’s campaign. He began his career at Goldman Sachs, where he became a partner, before creating his own hedge fund, moving to the West Coast and entering the first rank of movie financiers by bankrolling hits like the “X-Men” franchise and “Avatar.”…\nHis selection fits uneasily with much of Mr. Trump’s campaign rhetoric attacking the financial industry. Mr. Trump, in a campaign ad intended as a closing argument, portrayed the chief executive of Goldman Sachs as the personification of a global elite that the ad said had “robbed our working class.” …\nA number of Mr. Mnuchin’s friends made comments to various publications [in April] expressing shock at the decision [by Mnuchin to support Trump]. Mr. Mnuchin was unfazed.\n“Nobody’s going to be, like, ‘Well, why did he do this?’ if I end up in the administration,” he told Bloomberg Businessweek in August.\nNormally a job change from financing Hollywood entertainment to heading the U.S. Treasury Department would seem bizarre, but under Trump it makes sense. As we’re seeing in the Secretary of State selection process, his administration will be half policy, half drama. Mnuchin’s recruitment by Trump’s campaign earlier this year seems like something out of a movie too if this Bloomberg account is accurate. He’s not some hardcore Trumper or inner-circle crony who’s been onboard since the beginning. He’s going to be Secretary of the Treasury because he accepted a “last-minute invitation” at a moment when there was a huge vacuum on the finance side of Trump’s operation:\nThen, on April 19, the day of the New York primary, Mnuchin’s life veered.\nHe was supposed to be at a dinner downtown, but after receiving a last-minute invitation to Donald Trump’s victory speech, he stopped by Trump Tower. Mnuchin—53, stiff bearing, stylish black glasses—was milling around, swallowing some Trump-brand wine, when the candidate swanned into view. The two had worked together on building deals years earlier. The billionaire beckoned his friend to follow him onto an escalator, and suddenly they were both onstage, Trump jabbing at the roaring crowd and bragging that the group assembled behind him included some of the world’s great businessmen. Mnuchin beamed. From where he stood, Trump’s iridescent hairdo was almost close enough to pat. He spotted a monitor, glimpsed his own face, and realized he was on TV.\nTrump called him the next day and asked Mnuchin if he’d like to head the campaign’s finance team. It happened that quickly. You would think a man dedicated to economic populism would insist on recruiting a finance chair and would-be Treasury secretary from somewhere beyond Wall Street, or at least insisting on a thorough search before falling back on a Goldman veteran, but oh well. Erick Erickson noted this about Mnuchin last week: “Mnuchin collaborated with George Soros to buy IndyMac from the FDIC in 2008 for $1.5 billion. They then rebranded IndyMac as OneWest and structured the deal to receive reimbursements when they foreclosed on people who had loans with IndyMac. There are a lot of people who seem to think this incentivized foreclosures.” You might be reading about that, along with some Wall Street/Main Street bon mots, in the papers this week.\nWatch the clip below from January of Trump telling a crowd at 1:30 that Ted Cruz was “totally controlled, lock, stock, and barrel” by Goldman Sachs and Citibank because he had made a loan to his campaign underwritten by a margin loan from Goldman and had an additional line of credit from Citibank. Cruz’s wife Heidi also worked for Goldman, a fact that Trump fans used against Cruz. Trump’s demagoguery over Cruz’s Goldman ties was effective enough that on the final day of Cruz’s campaign, when he was confronted by a few Trump voters on the morning of the primary in Indiana, one of them thought to heckle him by shouting , “Where’s your Goldman Sachs jacket at? We know your wife worked there.” Goldman was used as a byword for how Cruz, supposedly, would forever be beholden as president to the fatcat special interests who were bankrolling him. Quite in contrast to the supposedly independent billionaire Trump, who’s now conveniently staffing up with some of the supposed puppetmasters.\nBearing that in mind, after you watch the clip go read this new report about Trump’s inaugural committee auctioning off perks, including a dinner with Mike Pence, to rich people and corporations willing to spend six- or seven-figure sums to get on the new president’s good side. The package includes “Priority Booking at Premier Inaugural Hotel(s),” which may or may not involve Trump’s own International Hotel in Washington. I’d bet that it will; why would he pass on an obvious opportunity to profit from his election? I read all of this and keep thinking of Salena Zito’s already famous line that the media took Trump literally but not seriously during the campaign while his fans took him seriously but not literally. When he tells you he’s going to reduce the influence of wealthy special interests over government, including and especially the influence of banks, maybe try to take him a little more seriously.\n",

Steven Mnuchin at Trump Tower in New York this month. (Eduardo Munoz Alvarez / AFP-Getty Images) Ylan Q. Mui, Philip Rucker The Washington Post \nPresident-elect Donald Trump is planning to name investor and former Goldman Sachs executive Steven Mnuchin as Treasury Secretary, opting for an industry insider with no government experience to helm the agency in charge of the nation's finances, according to people familiar with the matter. \nMnuchin (pronounced mah-NEW-chin) joined Trump's whirlwind campaign in May as finance chairman, despite the fact that he has never worked in politics and that he donated to Democrats in the past. He quickly earned Trump's trust as he worked closely with the Republican National Committee to raise substantial amounts of money in a short period of time. On the policy front, he was instrumental in crafting the details of Trump's proposal to overhaul the tax code. \nMnuchin is the latest member of Trump's top advisers to secure a high-level and influential post in the nascent administration, highlighting the importance the president-elect places on loyalty as he builds out his White House team. Last week, officials confirmed that industrialist billionaire Wilbur Ross would be nominated for Commerce secretary after serving as an economic adviser during the campaign. Trump also plans to install RNC Chairman Reince Priebus as his chief of staff and named his combative campaign adviser, Steve Bannon, as his chief strategist. \nMnuchin has close ties to Wall Street, and his nomination could undermine Trump's campaign promise to \"drain the swamp\" of special interests. Trump frequently lambasted big banks while on the stump - and Goldman Sachs in particular - and advocated the reinstatement of Glass-Steagall legislation that once separated retail and investment banks. In addition, Mnuchin's involvement in the purchase in 2009 of a failed bank at the heart of the housing bust could create conflicts of interest down the road. \n\"Anyone concerned about Wall Street billionaires rigging the economy should be terrified by the prospect of a Treasury Secretary Mnuchin,\" the activist campaign Take on Wall Street said in a statement. (Tribune news services) \nMnuchin did not immediately return a request for comment. But Stephen Moore, one of Trump's economic advisers during the campaign, called Mnuchin \"extremely knowledgeable.\" He added that Mnuchin's primary focus would likely be to shepard passage of Trump's tax plan through Congress. \n\"He clearly, like Donald Trump, understands that the number one goal for this administration is going to be to grow the economy and get jobs,\" Moore said. \nIn news interviews, Mnuchin has said he was not previously close to Trump, but the two move in the same circles of big-money financiers, willing to take big risks in the face of improbable odds. Tribune news services Donald Trump 's hunt for a secretary of state is veering into dramatic terrain, with the president-elect summoning Mitt Romney back for a second look as a top aide leads a public pressure campaign against the pick. Trump has a follow-up meeting Tuesday with the 2012 GOP presidential nominee, who... Donald Trump 's hunt for a secretary of state is veering into dramatic terrain, with the president-elect summoning Mitt Romney back for a second look as a top aide leads a public pressure campaign against the pick. Trump has a follow-up meeting Tuesday with the 2012 GOP presidential nominee, who... (Tribune news services) \nTrump's campaign was just the latest big bet in Mnuchin's varied career in the upper echelons of finance, which has stretched from New York to Hollywood. Goldman Sachs, the New York investment bank, is a family affair for Mnuchin. Before he worked at the Wall Street giant, his father, Robert Mnuchin, spent more than 33 years at the bank. His brother, Alan, was a Goldman Sachs' vice president. \nMnuchin spent 17 years at the bank rising from its savings and loan business to mortgage-backed bond training before becoming the bank's chief information officer in 1999. Mnuchin is a \"very smart guy,\" Lloyd Blankfein, chief executive of Goldman Sachs, said earlier this month. \n\"He was a very senior guy at a very young age at Goldman Sachs,\" he said. \nBlankfein said Mnuchin reported to him when he ran the fixed income division, but they haven't spoken much in recent years. \"I'm sure he stayed just as smart as he was when he was at Goldman,\" he said. \nAfter leaving the bank, Mnuchin worked for storied billionaire investor George Soros - a well-known Democratic donor. He then founded his own private equity fund, Dune Capital Management. Among its most notable investments was the purchase of IndyMac from the FDIC during the depths of the financial crisis in 2009. \nDune was part of a consortium of investors who bought the failed subprime lender for about $1.3 billion, and Mnuchin oversaw the rebuilding of its business as chief executive of the re-named OneWest. (A member of Trump's economic advisory team, John Paulson, was also part of the investor group.) \nUnder Mnuchin, the bank more than doubled its branches and increased its assets. But it also faced criticism from advocacy groups who complained about aggressive foreclosure tactics. At one point, activists marched to Mnuchin's home in Bel Air to protest its treatment of customers. \nAs Treasury Secretary, Mnuchin would be responsible for the Trump administration's ongoing response to the aftermath of the housing bust. A crisis-era program that helps homeowners refinance their mortgages, for example, is not scheduled to end until next year. \n\"The notion that a candidate who got elected in part due to the ongoing consequences from the housing crisis would hire someone who profiteered from the housing crisis is just kind of appalling,\" said Jeff Hauser, executive director at the Revolving Door Project at the liberal Center for Economic and Policy Research. \nIn 2014, OneWest was sold to financial services firm CIT Group for $3.4 billion. Mnuchin is chairman of CIT's board of directors but is not involved in day-to-day operations. \nAfter moving to California with the purchase of IndyMac, Mnuchin also became involved in financing Hollywood films. Dune Capital invested in several blockbusters, including American Sniper, Gravity, Avatar, and Life of Pi. \nAccording to Open Secrets, Mnuchin donated more than $200,000 to the RNC during the election. Together with his wife, Heather, they have contributed a total of $465,000 since 1995 - with $13,400 supporting Trump rival Hillary Clinton's campaigns for Senate and even the White House. \nThe Washington Post's Renae Merle contributed to this report.",

In an interview with USA Today , Gingrich made it clear he thought Trump's biggest mistake since being elected president was that tweet he sent out Sunday alleging \"millions\" of people had voted \"illegally,\" causing him to lose the popular vote to Hillary Clinton. \n\"The president of the United States can't randomly tweet without having somebody check it out,\" Gingrich said. \"It makes you wonder about whatever else he's doing. It undermines much more than a single tweet.\" \nWhile Gingrich said he disagrees with Trump's decision to broadcast baseless claims of voter fraud, he said he doesn't necessarily think Trump should clamp down on his tweeting entirely. \"He should tweet, but he ought to have an editorial board in between the first draft and sending it. But he shouldn't give it up, and he shouldn't give up being Donald Trump,\" Gingrich said, adding that if Trump \"starts getting to be normal, he'll cease being Donald J. Trump.\" \nHear the rest of Gingrich's commentary on Trump's tweeting below — along with his argument for why former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani is a much better choice for secretary of state than 2012 GOP nominee Mitt Romney.

      "text": "President-elect Donald Trump is planning to name investor and former Goldman Sachs executive Steven Mnuchin as Treasury secretary, opting for an industry insider with no government experience to helm the agency in charge of the nation's finances, according to people familiar with the matter.\nMnuchin (pronounced mah-NEW-chin) joined Trump's whirlwind campaign in May as finance chairman, despite the fact that he has never worked in politics and that he donated to Democrats in the past. He quickly earned Trump's trust as he worked closely with the Republican National Committee to raise substantial amounts of money in a short period of time. On the policy front, he was instrumental in crafting the details of Trump's proposal to overhaul the tax code.\nMnuchin is the latest member of Trump's top advisers to secure a high-level and influential post in the nascent administration, highlighting the importance the president-elect places on loyalty as he builds out his White House team. Last week, officials confirmed that industrialist billionaire Wilbur Ross would be nominated for Commerce secretary after serving as an economic adviser during the campaign. Trump also plans to install RNC Chairman Reince Priebus as his chief of staff and named his combative campaign adviser, Steve Bannon, as his chief strategist.\nMnuchin has close ties to Wall Street, and his nomination could undermine Trump's campaign promise to \"drain the swamp\" of special interests. Trump frequently lambasted big banks while on the stump - and Goldman Sachs in particular - and advocated the reinstatement of Glass-Steagall legislation that once separated retail and investment banks. In addition, Mnuchin's involvement in the purchase in 2009 of a failed bank at the heart of the housing bust could create conflicts of interest down the road.\n\"Anyone concerned about Wall Street billionaires rigging the economy should be terrified by the prospect of a Treasury Secretary Mnuchin,\" the activist campaign Take on Wall Street said in a statement.\nTrump selects Chao for transportation secretary, Rep. Price to head HHS Tribune news services Reaching deep into conservative territory, President-elect Donald Trump chose Georgia Rep. Tom Price to oversee the nation's health care system on Tuesday, picking a fierce \"Obamacare\" critic who also has championed efforts to privatize Medicare.

Tom Price to oversee the nation's health care system on Tuesday, picking a fierce \"Obamacare\" critic who also has championed efforts to privatize Medicare. Trump selected another veteran Republican, Elaine...\n(Tribune news services) Mnuchin did not immediately return a request for comment. But Stephen Moore, one of Trump's economic advisers during the campaign, called Mnuchin \"extremely knowledgeable.\" He added that Mnuchin's primary focus would likely be to shepard passage of Trump's tax plan through Congress.\n\"He clearly, like Donald Trump, understands that the number one goal for this administration is going to be to grow the economy and get jobs,\" Moore said.\nIn news interviews, Mnuchin has said he was not previously close to Trump, but the two move in the same circles of big-money financiers, willing to take big risks in the face of improbable odds.\nDonald Trump, Mitt Romney to meet a 2nd time about secretary of state post Tribune news services Donald Trump 's hunt for a secretary of state is veering into dramatic terrain, with the president-elect summoning Mitt Romney back for a second look as a top aide leads a public pressure campaign against the pick. Trump has a follow-up meeting Tuesday with the 2012 GOP presidential nominee, who... Donald Trump 's hunt for a secretary of state is veering into dramatic terrain, with the president-elect summoning Mitt Romney back for a second look as a top aide leads a public pressure campaign against the pick. Trump has a follow-up meeting Tuesday with the 2012 GOP presidential nominee, who... (Tribune news services) Trump's campaign was just the latest big bet in Mnuchin's varied career in the upper echelons of finance, which has stretched from New York to Hollywood. Goldman Sachs, the New York investment bank, is a family affair for Mnuchin. Before he worked at the Wall Street giant, his father, Robert Mnuchin, spent more than 33 years at the bank. His brother, Alan, was a Goldman Sachs' vice president.\nMnuchin spent 17 years at the bank rising from its savings and loan business to mortgage-backed bond training before becoming the bank's chief information officer in 1999. Mnuchin is a \"very smart guy,\" Lloyd Blankfein, chief executive of Goldman Sachs, said earlier this month.\n\"He was a very senior guy at a very young age at Goldman Sachs,\" he said.\nBlankfein said Mnuchin reported to him when he ran the fixed income division, but they haven't spoken much in recent years. \"I'm sure he stayed just as smart as he was when he was at Goldman,\" he said.\nAfter leaving the bank, Mnuchin worked for storied billionaire investor George Soros - a well-known Democratic donor. He then founded his own private equity fund, Dune Capital Management. Among its most notable investments was the purchase of IndyMac from the FDIC during the depths of the financial crisis in 2009.\nDune was part of a consortium of investors who bought the failed subprime lender for about $1.3 billion, and Mnuchin oversaw the rebuilding of its business as chief executive of the re-named OneWest. (A member of Trump's economic advisory team, John Paulson, was also part of the investor group.)\nUnder Mnuchin, the bank more than doubled its branches and increased its assets. But it also faced criticism from advocacy groups who complained about aggressive foreclosure tactics. At one point, activists marched to Mnuchin's home in Bel Air to protest its treatment of customers.\nAs Treasury Secretary, Mnuchin would be responsible for the Trump administration's ongoing response to the aftermath of the housing bust. A crisis-era program that helps homeowners refinance their mortgages, for example, is not scheduled to end until next year.\n\"The notion that a candidate who got elected in part due to the ongoing consequences from the housing crisis would hire someone who profiteered from the housing crisis is just kind of appalling,\" said Jeff Hauser, executive director at the Revolving Door Project at the liberal Center for Economic and Policy Research.\nIn 2014, OneWest was sold to financial services firm CIT Group for $3.4 billion. Mnuchin is chairman of CIT's board of directors but is not involved in day-to-day operations.\nAfter moving to California with the purchase of IndyMac, Mnuchin also became involved in financing Hollywood films. Dune Capital invested in several blockbusters, including American Sniper, Gravity, Avatar, and Life of Pi.\nAccording to Open Secrets, Mnuchin donated more than $200,000 to the RNC during the election. Together with his wife, Heather, they have contributed a total of $465,000 since 1995 - with $13,400 supporting Trump rival Hillary Clinton's campaigns for Senate and even the White House.\nThe Washington Post's Renae Merle contributed to this report. \nCopyright © 2016, Hartford Courant Real Estate Donald Trump John Paulson George Soros Lloyd Blankfein Democratic Party",

      "text": "WASHINGTON (REUTERS) - President-elect Donald Trump is expected to name former Goldman Sachs partner and Hollywood financier Steven Mnuchin as his nominee for Treasury secretary, a source said on Tuesday (Nov 29), putting a Wall Street veteran in the top US economic Cabinet post for the first time in eight years.\nMr Mnuchin, who was Mr Trump's presidential campaign finance chairman, could be named as early as Wednesday, said a Republican source close to the decision.\nMr Mnuchin was chosen over several high-profile candidates, including JPMorgan Chase Chairman Jamie Dimon and Republican Representative Jeb Hensarling, chairman of the powerful House Financial Services Committee.\nIf confirmed, Mr Mnuchin will be the first person with Wall Street experience to head the Treasury since his former boss, Henry Paulson, the former Goldman Sachs CEO who served under President George W. Bush and steered Treasury through the chaotic initial stages of the 2008-2009 financial crisis.\nThe selection of Mr Mnuchin was first reported by The New York Times. A relatively little-known but successful private equity investor and hedge fund manager, Mr Mnuchin spent 17 years at Goldman Sachs before leaving in 2002, when he launched Dune Capital Management.\nWith Dune, Mr Mnuchin has invested in movies produced by Rupert Murdoch's 20th Century Fox and Time Warner Inc's Warner Bros, including blockbusters \"Avatar,\" \"Mad Max: Fury Road\" and\"Suicide Squad.\"\nACQUIRED FAILED BANK\nThe son of a Goldman Sachs partner who became an art dealer, Mr Mnuchin worked hard to step outside his father's shadow and make a name for himself, former colleagues said, rising to become the firm's chief information officer in 1999.\n\"He wanted to prove that he was there on the merits,\" said a former Goldman colleague, who spoke on condition of anonymity.\nMr Mnuchin's experience running Goldman's mortgage-backed bond trading desk would later prove valuable when an opportunity arose in 2009 to buy the deeply discounted assets of failed California mortgage lender IndyMac Bank from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation during the financial crisis.\nHe assembled an investor group that included hedge fund manager John Paulson to buy the assets for US$1.55 billion (S$2.2 billion), and moved to Los Angeles. After rebranding the operation OneWest Bank, Mr Mnuchin built it with other assets and professional sports team sponsorships into Southern California's largest bank, with 73 branches and US$23 billion in assets.\nHis group sold OneWest to CIT Group Inc last year for US$3.4 billion. But the bank came under fire for its foreclosure practices as housing advocacy groups accused it of being too quick to foreclose on struggling homeowners. In 2011, dozens of demonstrators descended on Mr Mnuchin's US$26.5 million home in the wealthy Bel Air neighbourhood to protest OneWest's eviction tactics, according to the Los Angeles Times.\nThis month, two housing groups filed a complaint asking the US Department of Housing and Urban Development to investigate complaints that OneWest engaged in discriminatory \"redlining\"practices against black and Latino communities.\nAlthough Mr Mnuchin has a reputation for being a behind-the-scenes player in Hollywood, he does appear on screen in the 2016 film \"Rules Don't Apply,\" according to the IMDB movie database. The drama, opening in theaters Nov 23, stars Warren Beatty, who also wrote and directed the film.\nTopics:  US PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION 2016 DONALD TRUMP POLITICS AND GOVERNMENT More Share Tweet Linkedin Pin Google+ Reddit Print Permalink: http://str.sg/4QWR Copy",

      "text": "Goldman Sachs at Center of Politics, Money and Public Furor Once Again  48:  Liz Hoffman \nHeading into the 2016 presidential election, most executives on Wall Street would have said one thing was certain no matter who won: The next Treasury secretary wouldn't come from Goldman Sachs Group Inc. \nThat reflected the view that Goldman was so tainted in the public mind by the financial crisis that none of its alumni could be floated, much less confirmed, to top government positions. \nMr. Mnuchin worked at the company for 17 years. Most of his time was spent in Goldman's mortgage-trading business in the early 1990s, though he also oversaw its internet strategy, which resulted in a flopped online wealth-brokerage effort in the early 2000s. \nMr. Mnuchin made partner in 1994, the same class that produced Goldman's current No. 2, Gary Cohn. Mr. Cohn met with Mr. Trump Tuesday. \nIf Mr. Mnuchin is confirmed as Treasury secretary, he will be the third former Goldman banker to hold the position in less than 25 years. Robert Rubin served in this role in President Bill Clinton's second term and Henry Paulson Jr. occupied the spot in President George W. Bush's second term and brought Goldman banker Robert Steel along as his deputy. \nWhile the firm's critics have pointed to its extensive ties to government as a sign of Wall Street's outsize influence, Goldman partners have long viewed public service as an important coda to a finance career. \nAnd the firm's government ties extend well beyond the Treasury. \nWilliam Dudley, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, spent a decade as a Goldman's chief economist. Joshua Bolten, a legal- and regulatory-affairs executive at Goldman in the 1990s, served as President George W. Bush's chief of staff, and Steve Friedman, who was among the Goldman partners who rang the New York Stock Exchange bell at the bank's 1999 debut, served as a senior economic counselor in that administration. Gary Gensler, head of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission under President Barack Obama, was one of the youngest bankers ever named a partner at Goldman. \nGoldman's government reach isn't confined to the U.S. Bank of England Gov. Mark Carney, who was previously head of Canada's central bank, was a Goldman banker for 13 years in its London, Tokyo, New York and Toronto offices. \nEuropean Central Bank President Mario Draghi was a vice chairman and managing director in the firm's international business from 2002 to 2005.Goldman advisers and former employees have served as governors of the central banks of Australia, Greece and South Africa. \nThe funnel that has sent Goldman executives to Washington dates to the bank's longtime leader, Sidney Weinberg. Mr. Weinberg, who ran Goldman for more than three decades and oversaw its rise from scrappy second-tier firm to the investment-banking elite, was a supporter and close friend of President Lyndon Johnson, to whom he recommended several men to key cabinet posts. \nHis influence in the White House elevated Goldman's status in Washington, a position it solidified during the 1990s and early 2000s. \nThat Goldman is again back at the pinnacle of the U.S. government is a stunning turnaround from the drubbing its image took during the financial crisis. Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein and other executives were hauled before Congress over trades involving complex financial instruments that were believed to have fueled the financial meltdown. \nIn 2010, Goldman became the face of Wall Street and the crisis thanks to a damning article in Rolling Stone. The magazine called Goldman \"a great vampire squid wrapped around the face of humanity, relentlessly jamming its blood funnel into anything that smells like money.\" \nIn the wake of that, Goldman, which long focused only on its reputation with clients, undertook steps to burnish its public image. It boosted its philanthropic efforts, which now support women entrepreneurs and small businesses. Today, Goldman has a consumer bank and weekly podcasts. \n\"We try not to be tone-deaf and we listen closely,\" Mr. Blankfein said recently when asked about his firm's reputation. \"It's not in as low ebb as it was in the heart of the financial crisis [but] it's still low ebb. We have to work on that and we know that.\"  162048ET   This article appears in: Politics",

      "text": "Another gator just slithered into the swamp. Donald Trump is expected to name former Goldman Sachs executive Steve Mnuchin his Treasury Secretary. Um, so much for populism and going after Hillary Clinton’s Wall Street speeches.\nAnother Gator in the Swamp: Wall Street Exec Steve Mnuchin to Be Trump’s Treasury Secretary [Photo Credit: Everipedia] This comes after he nominated anti-gay Obamacare hater Tom Price (R-GA) as his nominee for Health and Human Services Secretary and Mitch McConnell’s wife, Elaine Chao, as Transportation Secretary, despite her abysmal record as Labor Secretary under President George W. Bush.\nNPR reports Mnuchin made profits of the housing bust that left many homeowners in financial ruin:\nDuring the depths of the financial crisis, Mnuchin was looking to make profits from the ruins of the housing bust. In 2009, he put together a group of billionaire investors and bought a failed California-based bank, IndyMac . It had been taken over by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. after its sketchy mortgage loans went bad. \nMnuchin and his partners bought IndyMac on the condition that the FDIC agree to pay future losses above a certain threshold. They renamed the bank OneWest Bank and, after running it for 6 years, they sold it last year for a profit, estimated at close to $1.5 billion. \nKevin Stein of the California Reinvestment Coalition, a housing advocacy group, says that profit was made on the backs of suffering California homeowners. “In essence what they did is they bought a foreclosure machine,” he says. \nSo much for draining the swamp and running as a populist. Donald Trump has conned voters like he did to Trump University students.\nAnother Gator in the Swamp: Wall Street Exec Steve Mnuchin to Be Trump’s Treasury Secretary \n                                    Related Stories Donald Trump Latest Tweetstorm Proves Clinton Right, He’s Unfit to be POTUS Sore Winner Donald Trump Rails Against Wisconsin Vote Recount as a “Scam” Election Fraud Complaint Filed Over Four Precincts in Wisconsin   ",

      "text": "President-elect Donald Trump will nominate Steven Mnuchin to be the nation’s 77th treasury secretary, a person familiar with the decision says.\nMnuchin is a financial executive who served as head of Trump’s campaign finance operation.\nWhen Mnuchin was chosen by Trump as his national finance director in May, he told The Associated Press the two men had been friends for 15 years.\nIf approved by the Senate, Mnuchin would follow in the tradition of two previous treasury secretaries, who all spent years working at Wall Street powerhouse Goldman Sachs. He would bring no government experience to the job.\nThe person familiar with the decision would only discuss it on condition of anonymity because the person was not authorized to reveal it ahead of the official announcement.",

      "text": "By Emily Shire 4 hours ago \nOn Tuesday, news broke that former Goldman Sachs partner Steve Mnuchin would be Donald Trump's Treasury secretary nominee . Mnuchin took an active role in Trump's presidential run, serving as his campaign's national finance chair. \nAlthough Trump has not yet made an official announcement, sources close to the transition team confirmed that Mnuchin was the pick — and that's not exactly a surprise. Mnuchin has been widely suspected to be Trump's top choice for the role, with Bloomberg reporting more than two weeks ago that Mnuchin \"has been recommended by Donald Trump’s transition team to serve as Treasury secretary.\" \nHowever, as much speculation as there has been about Mnuchin, there have also been concerns about his deep ties to Wall Street and the corporate structures Trump and so many of his supporters railed against. Mnuchin not only worked at Goldman Sachs for nearly two decades, but his father worked for the company, as well (and so did Trump's senior White House adviser and former Breitbart head, Steve Bannon, for that matter). After leaving Goldman Sachs in 2002, Mnuchin started his own hedge fund, Dune Capital Management, which The New York Times noted was \"named after the dunes near his beach house in the Hamptons.\" \nMnuchin was a part of a group that bought the failing California bank, IndyMac, and renamed it OneWest. Kevin Stein of the California Reinvestment Coalition , a housing advocacy group, told NPR, \"In essence what they did is they bought a foreclosure machine.\" According to the California Reinvestment Coalition, 36,000 homes were foreclosed under Mnuchin's watch. \n\"It's hard to see Mnuchin cracking down on Wall Street,\" Jeff Hauser, director of the Revolving Door Project , a government oversight group, told Politico. \"Indeed, one imagines Mnuchin's banking agenda would be to rehabilitate Trump's reputation with Wall Street.\" Must Reads ",

      "text": "President-elect Donald Trump will name longtime banker and former Goldman Sachs executive Steven Mnuchin as Treasury secretary, turning to a campaign loyalist and fundraiser for the incoming administration's top economic cabinet post, a transition official said Tuesday.\nMr. Mnuchin, 53, played a behind-the-scenes role in Mr. Trump's election, helping oversee the creation of a network of small donors that let the campaign compete successfully against the better-funded Hillary Clinton operation.\nMr. Mnuchin's longtime Wall Street ties—his father spent his entire career at Goldman—make him a traditional pick for the Treasury spot. But the choice is at odds with Mr. Trump's message that economic and political elites have left the country damaged. Still, his establishment profile may sit more comfortably with the Republicans in the Senate, which decides whether to confirm the nominee.\nLeaving Trump Tower in New York on Tuesday night, Mr. Mnuchin, asked about the appointment, declined to comment. \"I'll talk about it tomorrow,\" he said.\nThe president-elect also is expected to name Wilbur Ross Jr. as his Commerce secretary nominee, a transition official said Tuesday, selecting a fellow businessman.\nAlso on Tuesday, Mr. Trump selected candidates for two other cabinet agencies: former Labor Secretary Elaine Chao at Transportation, and Rep. Tom Price (R., Ga.) as Health and Human Services secretary.\nThe choice of Mr. Mnuchin is a contrast to another figure who had been considered, Rep. Jeb Hensarling, a tea-party favorite. He's a free-market Republican from Texas who is chairman of the House Financial Services Committee and has been a key advocate of overturning the Dodd-Frank financial-overhaul law.\nMr. Trump, who has mostly populated his administration with supporters, would be getting in Mr. Mnuchin someone with a history of donating more money to Democrats than Republicans. He nonetheless signed onto Mr. Trump's campaign and took the post of national finance chairman, to the chagrin of some top Clinton fundraisers.\nIf confirmed by the Senate, Mr. Mnuchin will join a list of prominent bankers who made similar moves from Wall Street to Washington, including two of his former bosses at Goldman, Henry Paulson and Robert Rubin, who were both top Goldman executives before joining the department.\nThe Treasury secretary is the chief navigator of the nation's economy, overseeing the collection of taxes, the imposition of foreign sanctions, managing the public debt and serving as the chief connection between the administration and the financial markets and the business community.\nIn a sense, Mr. Mnuchin and Mr. Trump have now both taken chances on each other.\nWhen Mr. Mnuchin signed on to the Trump campaign, some of Hillary Clinton's major fundraisers said they were stunned and annoyed.\nMr. Mnuchin has given mostly to Democrats in recent years. He gave the maximum $2,300 to Mrs. Clinton's presidential primary bid in 2007. When her campaign failed, he donated the maximum to then-Sen. Barack Obama's presidential run. Mr. Mnuchin also has given to several other Democratic presidential campaigns over the years, including those of John Edwards, John Kerry and Al Gore.\nMr. Trump elevated Mr. Mnuchin to national finance chairman and has leaned heavily on him during the transition. Now Mr. Trump is taking his loyalty to Mr. Mnuchin a giant step further, giving him control over broad swaths of the nation's economy. When Mr. Trump is sworn in Jan. 20, the success of his presidency will rest as much in Mr. Mnuchin's hands as those of any other presidential appointee.\nUncertainty still surrounds the most prestigious cabinet post: secretary of state. Filling the position has become a high-drama affair that has left Mr. Trump's team divided. A pair of top candidates met privately with Mr. Trump on Tuesday: U.S. Sen. Bob Corker, a Tennessee Republican who is chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee; and Mitt Romney, a former Republican presidential nominee who feuded with Mr. Trump during the GOP primaries this year.\nSome Trump aides have said Mr. Romney's outspoken opposition during the race should disqualify him from getting a plum cabinet post, but Mr. Trump has kept Mr. Romney under active consideration. The two met for dinner together on Tuesday night at the Trump International Hotel & Tower in Mr. Romney's second meeting with the president-elect.\nAfter the dinner, Mr. Romney sounded a note of contrition, saying he thinks \"you're going to see America continue to lead the world in this century. What I've seen through these discussions I've had with President-elect Trump, as well as what we've seen in his speech the night of his victory, as well as the people he's selected as part of his transition, all of those things combined give me increasing hope that President-elect Trump is the very man who can lead us to that better future.\"\nA former Massachusetts governor, Mr. Romney made an ill-fated foreign trip during his unsuccessful presidential bid in 2012. He met with leaders in the U.K., Israel and Poland and spoke publicly about top foreign-policy concerns such as Iran and Israeli-Palestinian peace.\nThe most memorable moment of his trip, however, was his statement in London suggesting the city wasn't ready to host the Olympics. The comment from Mr. Romney, who rescued the financially troubled 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, drew a searing rebuke from the city's then-mayor, Boris Johnson. Mr. Johnson is now the U.K.'s foreign minister and would be Mr. Romney's counterpart if he becomes secretary of state.\nYet Mr. Romney is now seen as pinpointing early on one of the biggest looming collisions on the world stage: the U.S. and Russia.\nDuring the 2012 campaign Mr. Romney said Russia was the biggest geopolitical threat facing the U.S. President Barack Obama and his aides laughed at the GOP nominee, saying his remark showed how little he understood about the world.\nMr. Corker, meantime, said his meeting with Mr. Trump Tuesday was \"an honor.\"\n\"We had a very wide ranging meeting, actually a couple meetings and his instincts on foreign policy are obviously very, very good,\" he said.\nHe added: \"I know he has a number of outstanding individuals that he's talking with. I was glad to be here and glad to see more fully some of what his views about the world are.\"\nTwo weeks after the election, Mr. Trump is making appointments at a swifter pace than prior administrations.\nMany candidates have been arriving at Trump Tower in full view of the news media, disappearing into the gold elevators for their interviews with Mr. Trump, and then reappearing in the lobby to offer their views to the media.\nPassing through the lobby Tuesday afternoon was Vice President-elect Mike Pence, who told reporters to \"stay tuned\" for more appointments. \"It's going to be a busy week,\" Mr. Pence said.\nHe added: \"I think the American people are seeing the leadership and the energy that our president-elect is going to bring to the White House.\"\nThe picks announced Tuesday extend an olive branch from Trump Tower to Capitol Hill. Mr. Price is a close ally—and friend—of House Speaker Paul Ryan (R., Wis.) Ms. Chao, who served as labor secretary for all eight years of Republican President George W. Bush's administration, is married to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.).\nMr. Price, if confirmed by the Senate, will preside over an agency that likely would try to dismantle President Barack Obama's signature health-care overhaul assuming congressional Republicans repeal the law.\nAfter a postelection period holed up at various Trump properties in New York, New Jersey and Florida, Mr. Trump is about to embark on a campaign-style \"thank you\" tour of states that were crucial to his victory.\nHis first stop will be a sports arena in Cincinnati on Thursday, his transition team said. He will be joined at the rally by Mr. Pence, who is also scheduled to hold an event in New Orleans on Saturday.\nMichael C. Bender, Carol E.

      "text": "President-elect Donald Trump will name longtime banker and former Goldman Sachs executive Steven Mnuchin as Treasury secretary, turning to a campaign loyalist and fundraiser for the incoming administration's top economic cabinet post, a transition official said Tuesday.\nMr. Mnuchin, 53, played a behind-the-scenes role in Mr. Trump's election, helping oversee the creation of a network of small donors that let the campaign compete successfully against the better-funded Hillary Clinton operation.\nMr. Mnuchin's longtime Wall Street ties—his father spent his entire career at Goldman—make him a traditional pick for the Treasury spot. But the choice is at odds with Mr. Trump's message that economic and political elites have left the country damaged. Still, his establishment profile may sit more comfortably with the Republicans in the Senate, which decides whether to confirm the nominee.\nLeaving Trump Tower in New York on Tuesday night, Mr. Mnuchin, asked about the appointment, declined to comment. \"I'll talk about it tomorrow,\" he said.\nThe president-elect also is expected to name Wilbur Ross Jr. as his Commerce secretary nominee, a transition official said Tuesday, selecting a fellow businessman.\nAlso on Tuesday, Mr. Trump selected candidates for two other cabinet agencies: former Labor Secretary Elaine Chao at Transportation, and Rep. Tom Price (R., Ga.) as Health and Human Services secretary.\nThe choice of Mr. Mnuchin is a contrast to another figure who had been considered, Rep. Jeb Hensarling, a tea-party favorite. He's a free-market Republican from Texas who is chairman of the House Financial Services Committee and has been a key advocate of overturning the Dodd-Frank financial-overhaul law.\nMr. Trump, who has mostly populated his administration with supporters, would be getting in Mr. Mnuchin someone with a history of donating more money to Democrats than Republicans. He nonetheless signed onto Mr. Trump's campaign and took the post of national finance chairman, to the chagrin of some top Clinton fundraisers.\nIf confirmed by the Senate, Mr. Mnuchin will join a list of prominent bankers who made similar moves from Wall Street to Washington, including two of his former bosses at Goldman, Henry Paulson and Robert Rubin, who were both top Goldman executives before joining the department.\nThe Treasury secretary is the chief navigator of the nation's economy, overseeing the collection of taxes, the imposition of foreign sanctions, managing the public debt and serving as the chief connection between the administration and the financial markets and the business community.\nIn a sense, Mr. Mnuchin and Mr. Trump have now both taken chances on each other.\nWhen Mr. Mnuchin signed on to the Trump campaign, some of Hillary Clinton's major fundraisers said they were stunned and annoyed.\nMr. Mnuchin has given mostly to Democrats in recent years. He gave the maximum $2,300 to Mrs. Clinton's presidential primary bid in 2007. When her campaign failed, he donated the maximum to then-Sen. Barack Obama's presidential run. Mr. Mnuchin also has given to several other Democratic presidential campaigns over the years, including those of John Edwards, John Kerry and Al Gore.\nMr. Trump elevated Mr. Mnuchin to national finance chairman and has leaned heavily on him during the transition. Now Mr. Trump is taking his loyalty to Mr. Mnuchin a giant step further, giving him control over broad swaths of the nation's economy. When Mr. Trump is sworn in Jan. 20, the success of his presidency will rest as much in Mr. Mnuchin's hands as those of any other presidential appointee.\nUncertainty still surrounds the most prestigious cabinet post: secretary of state. Filling the position has become a high-drama affair that has left Mr. Trump's team divided. A pair of top candidates met privately with Mr. Trump on Tuesday: U.S. Sen. Bob Corker, a Tennessee Republican who is chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee; and Mitt Romney, a former Republican presidential nominee who feuded with Mr. Trump during the GOP primaries this year.\nSome Trump aides have said Mr. Romney's outspoken opposition during the race should disqualify him from getting a plum cabinet post, but Mr. Trump has kept Mr. Romney under active consideration. The two met for dinner together on Tuesday night at the Trump International Hotel & Tower in Mr. Romney's second meeting with the president-elect.\nAfter the dinner, Mr. Romney sounded a note of contrition, saying he thinks \"you're going to see America continue to lead the world in this century. What I've seen through these discussions I've had with President-elect Trump, as well as what we've seen in his speech the night of his victory, as well as the people he's selected as part of his transition, all of those things combined give me increasing hope that President-elect Trump is the very man who can lead us to that better future.\"\nA former Massachusetts governor, Mr. Romney made an ill-fated foreign trip during his unsuccessful presidential bid in 2012. He met with leaders in the U.K., Israel and Poland and spoke publicly about top foreign-policy concerns such as Iran and Israeli-Palestinian peace.\nThe most memorable moment of his trip, however, was his statement in London suggesting the city wasn't ready to host the Olympics. The comment from Mr. Romney, who rescued the financially troubled 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, drew a searing rebuke from the city's then-mayor, Boris Johnson. Mr. Johnson is now the U.K.'s foreign minister and would be Mr. Romney's counterpart if he becomes secretary of state.\nYet Mr. Romney is now seen as pinpointing early on one of the biggest looming collisions on the world stage: the U.S. and Russia.\nDuring the 2012 campaign Mr. Romney said Russia was the biggest geopolitical threat facing the U.S. President Barack Obama and his aides laughed at the GOP nominee, saying his remark showed how little he understood about the world.\nMr. Corker, meantime, said his meeting with Mr. Trump Tuesday was \"an honor.\"\n\"We had a very wide ranging meeting, actually a couple meetings and his instincts on foreign policy are obviously very, very good,\" he said.\nHe added: \"I know he has a number of outstanding individuals that he's talking with. I was glad to be here and glad to see more fully some of what his views about the world are.\"\nTwo weeks after the election, Mr. Trump is making appointments at a swifter pace than prior administrations.\nMany candidates have been arriving at Trump Tower in full view of the news media, disappearing into the gold elevators for their interviews with Mr. Trump, and then reappearing in the lobby to offer their views to the media.\nPassing through the lobby Tuesday afternoon was Vice President-elect Mike Pence, who told reporters to \"stay tuned\" for more appointments. \"It's going to be a busy week,\" Mr. Pence said.\nHe added: \"I think the American people are seeing the leadership and the energy that our president-elect is going to bring to the White House.\"\nThe picks announced Tuesday extend an olive branch from Trump Tower to Capitol Hill. Mr. Price is a close ally—and friend—of House Speaker Paul Ryan (R., Wis.) Ms. Chao, who served as labor secretary for all eight years of Republican President George W. Bush's administration, is married to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.).\nMr. Price, if confirmed by the Senate, will preside over an agency that likely would try to dismantle President Barack Obama's signature health-care overhaul assuming congressional Republicans repeal the law.\nAfter a postelection period holed up at various Trump properties in New York, New Jersey and Florida, Mr. Trump is about to embark on a campaign-style \"thank you\" tour of states that were crucial to his victory.\nHis first stop will be a sports arena in Cincinnati on Thursday, his transition team said. He will be joined at the rally by Mr. Pence, who is also scheduled to hold an event in New Orleans on Saturday.\nMichael C. Bender, Carol E.

      "text": " 33 AM EST Hope Is a Strategy…and Other Insights From Goldman Sachs By now, you've probably seen the headlines touting Goldman Sachs' 2017 outlook for the stock market . Strategist David Kostin and team argue that the S&P 500 will hit 2,400 during the first half of the year as hope--for lower taxes , less regulation, and fiscal stimulus--takes hold, but will drop to 2,300 by the end of the year, as fear--of inflation , rising labor costs and higher interests rates--spur profit taking. But for now, hope really is a strategy, Kostin says. Here's how to play it:",

He has long been the heir apparent to Goldman CEO Lloyd Blankfein.",

      "text": "by Sarah Butcher 10 minutes ago \nRemember Alex Blankfein? He’s the 30 year old son of Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein. His finance résumé is as good as it gets.  en/178284/lloyd-blankfeins-sons-jonathan-alex-didnt-stay-jobs-goldman-sachs/ \nRemember Alex Blankfein? He’s the 30 year old son of Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein. Last time we caught up with him, he’d spent around three years at Goldman Sachs working in cross asset sales, followed by an MBA at Harvard Business School, followed by a job at Bain & Co. Now though, he’s working as a senior associate at Carlyle Group – one of the world’s most prestigious private equity companies. \nAlex Blankfein’s arrival at Carlyle isn’t recent – according to his publicly available profile he joined from Bain in April last year. However, it appears to have gone unnoticed by the world’s media. Carlyle updated its page relating to Alex Blankfein last week . He’s working on Carlyle’s U.S. Equity Opportunities team, is ‘focused on a broad range of middle-market buyout transactions,’ and is based in New York City. \nPrivate equity jobs are notoriously difficult to get and Carlyle is one of the most selective hirers of the lot. Alex Blankfein’s move may have been indirectly facilitated by his father’s closeness to David Rubenstein, Carlyle’s founder. Rubenstein interviewed Lloyd Blankfein last month for his Bloomberg-hosted chat show. \nSpeaking at a London School of Economics conference last year, Rubenstein said the people who succeed in private equity are those who are in it for love rather than money: “You have to really love what you’re doing and you won’t find what you love until you’ve experimented a bit. Find something you really enjoy and then you can make a career out of it.” In this, Rubenstein echoed Lloyd Blankfein’s own careers advice from several years earlier: success comes from being a “complete person”, said Blankfein in 2013, adding that young people should have a “few years of experimentation.” \nIn 2013 Blankfein said his own children ignored his careers wisdom. In fact, it seems Alex was listening: Blankfein’s oldest son has experimented by notching up a range of top brands. He’s worked for a top name investment bank, taken a top name MBA, joined a top name consultancy firm, and now he’s at a top name private equity firm. Other millennials may want to take note. \nContact: Related articles:",

      "text": "First Steve Mnuchin at Treasury, now this . Trump’s two top fiscal officers may end up being Goldman Sachs alums, one of them among the biggest cheeses at the firm. This, after months of calling Ted Cruz a Wall Street puppet because he’s married to a Goldman employee and had a small margin loan from the bank. And this, despite Trump’s most darkly memorable speech of the campaign having accused Hillary Clinton of selling out average Americans to “international banks.” Footage of Goldman CEO Lloyd Blankfein even ended up in Trump’s “closing argument” ad as visual shorthand of the evil forces of finance who were pulling Clinton’s strings.\nFor the first and probably last time in my life, I’m interested in hearing what Trump’s friend Alex Jones thinks of all this.\nPresident-elect Donald Trump is considering Goldman Sachs President Gary Cohn for a senior administration job, possibly as director of the Office of Management and Budget, several sources close to the situation said on Wednesday.\nPeople familiar with the matter say Cohn’s meeting with Trump on Tuesday included talks about a potential job in the new administration, possibly to run OMB, a sprawling office that will handle much of Trump’s budget policy after he takes office in January…\nPeople close to Cohn, an aggressive and imposing trading veteran, note that he has a reputation for attracting and managing top talent, a key attribute for any OMB chief.\nHe’s a registered Democrat but has donated to, and is “friendly” with, members of both parties, which is true to form for Wall Street. Big question now: How many Goldman veterans will be too many for Trump fans? Steve Bannon is immunized from his Goldman pedigree due to his ardent populism; Mnuchin is partly immunized from his own Goldman service because he was, after all, finance chairman of Trump’s winning populist campaign, although a few eyebrows are bound to rise once the media starts to revisit Mnuchin’s work for, among others, George Soros in foreclosing on homes . How does Trump sell Cohn to his base, though? Cohn wasn’t part of the campaign and he’s no minor player at Goldman. He’s the president. Given Trump’s attacks on “the system” for the past 18 months and his more recent focus on international finance as a sinister force behind Clinton, him bringing the top guy at Goldman Sachs in to head OMB is a bit like Reagan circa 1980 staffing up with Ted Kennedy. It should be a political problem for him. Toss in the fact that Democratic billionaire Wilbur Ross is on tap to head Commerce and billionaire Ricketts family heir Todd Ricketts is set to be deputy secretary of that department and “the swamp” seems to be filling up quicker than Trump can drain it.\nWill these picks be a political problem for him, though? I think Trumpers will divide into three groups. The hardcore devotees, the sort of people who waited on line for hours for his rallies and happily told reporters there was nothing Trump could do to lose their votes, will accept anything he does. A second faction, while not quite willing to back Trump unconditionally, nonetheless buys his logic that “the system” can only be reformed by someone who knows it well enough to have gamed it successfully. That logic is how he managed to get away with multiple corporate bankruptcies, thousands of dollars in donations to Democrats, and other sins that otherwise would have wrecked his right-wing populist credibility. I was just playing the game, Trump insisted, outmaneuvering the elites using their own rules. Enough people bought it to make him president; in theory, the Mnuchin/Cohn/Ross/Ricketts picks could be shoehorned into the same point, that they know the system really well from the inside and are thus well positioned to overhaul it. And then there’s probably a third group that is skeptical of these picks but can be pacified for now on the theory that Trump is staffing up with the “bad guys” deliberately for the purpose of coopting them. In this scenario he’s Clarice Starling and Cohn is Hannibal Lecter; if you want to stop a criminal, who better to seek advice from than someone with a criminal mind himself? If nothing else, this theory will claim, having so many Wall Street luminaries on his team should make Trump’s populist policies more tolerable to the banks and encourage them to buy into reform. In that sense it’s a bit like Trump eyeing supreme Republican establishmentarian Mitt Romney as his point man on foreign policy. If you’re looking to get mainstream Republicans to accept rapprochement with Putin, who better to sell it than the guy who once said Russia is our number one geopolitical foe?\nThe only staple of Trump’s base that might actually punish him for this is the alt-right, which has its own political identity distinct from Trump’s and thus an incentive to assert its independence when he strays too far from their brand of populist nationalism. Most of the right will happily go along, though, Trumpers because they trust that the great man has his reasons in making appointments like these and the rest of the GOP because they worry above all about Trump doing wacky things in office. And, whatever else these picks may be, they’re at least not wacky.\nHere’s Trump’s “closing argument” ad, released long ago when he seemed prepared to wage war on American finance’s grip on government. And by “long ago,” I mean 24 days ago. The bald guy with the goatee at the Clinton Global Initiative podium seen at 1:14 is Lloyd Blankfein.\n\n",

      "text": "Trumps's curious Goldman Sachs connections Advertisement Quote: During the campaign, Donald Trump held up Goldman Sachs as a villain and symbol of the corrupt establishment. Trump's closing campaign ad flashed an ominous image of Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein just as Trump condemned the \"global power structure\" for robbing America's working class and enriching the elite. Yet now, the president-elect is leaning on several former Goldman Sachs executives to help him run the country after he takes over in January. This week, Trump named former Goldman Sachs partner Steve Mnuchin to the powerful Cabinet position of Treasury secretary. He is said to be considering Goldman's current No. 2 exec Gary Cohn to lead the Office of Management and Budget, Politico reports. And who can forget that Steve Bannon, Trump's chief strategist, also worked at Goldman at one time. This is the same Trump who said Goldman Sachs had \"total, total control\" over his rivals Hillary Clinton and Ted Cruz. And he often referenced Clinton's speeches to Goldman Sachs (GS), accusing her of meeting \"in secret with international banks to plot the destruction of U.S. sovereignty.\" Trump has run as an anti-establishment candidate and Goldman represents the establishment to many. After all, President George W. Bush famously tapped then-Goldman CEO Hank Paulson to lead Treasury in 2006 and President Bill Clinton named Robert Rubin, another longtime Goldman exec, to lead Treasury. \"On the campaign trail, he ripped Wall Street and vowed not to let Wall Street control the country. Yet he picks a former Goldman Sachs partner as Treasury secretary,\" Jaret Seiberg, a Cowen & Co. analyst, wrote in a note on Wednesday. It's true that Mnuchin hasn't worked at Goldman in over a dozen years and these days he's better known for bankrolling films like American Sniper and buying the assets of failed bank Indymac on the cheap. But Mnuchin did spend nearly two decades at Goldman Sachs, reportedly making a fortune of $46 million while there. Mnuchin is also literally a child of Wall Street as his father worked at Goldman before he did. Related: Mnuchin to be grilled about time as mortgage banker Trump also met with Cohn on Tuesday at Trump Tower, GOP officials confirmed. The meeting came just before Trump selected Mnuchin as his Treasury pick. Trump is also reportedly considering Anthony Scaramucci for another top post. Before founding his own hedge fund, Scaramucci had two stints at Goldman Sachs, most recently as vice president in private wealth management. Scaramucci was a leader on Trump's finance committee during the presidential campaign and after the election he joined the billionaire's transition team. And Bannon, who is best known for leading Breitbart, worked as an M&A banker at Goldman back in the 1980s. Yet Bannon isn't exactly a friend of Wall Street these days. He's turned into a critic of the industry. In 2014, Bannon told Buzzfeed the financial crisis was driven by \"greed\" and pushed to reform the system. \"You really need to go back and make banks do what they do: Commercial banks lend money, and investment banks invest in entrepreneurs and to get away from this trading,\" Bannon said. Related: Dark clouds over big banks' Trump party Wall Street certainly believes that Trump will be a friend. Since Trump's election, big bank stocks are skyrocketing on hopes that Trump will dial back or even kill the Dodd-Frank financial reform regime. Goldman itself is on quite a roll since Trump's victory. The company's share price has skyrocketed 21% since Election Day, crushing the broader market's gains and leading many other big bank stocks. Ironically, Goldman's top boss wasn't exactly a fan of Trump. A year ago Blankfein, the CEO of Goldman, said the idea of Trump having his \"finger on the button blows my mind.\" In any case, now that Trump is president and has hired several Goldman veterans does it mean he will go soft on the big banks? It's too early to say. Seiberg, the Cowen analyst, argues the opposite. Mnuchin's \"Goldman Sachs lineage might force him to be tough on the mega banks to show he isn't caving to Wall Street,\" he said.",

      "text": "By Ben Levisohn By now, you’ve probably seen the headlines touting Goldman Sachs’ 2017 outlook for the stock market . Strategist David Kostin and team argue that the S&P 500 will hit 2,400 during the first half of the year as hope–for lower taxes , less regulation, and fiscal stimulus–takes hold, but will drop to 2,300 by the end of the year, as fear–of inflation , rising labor costs and higher interests rates–spur profit taking. But for now, hope really is a strategy, Kostin says. Here’s how to play it:\nGetty Images 1. Buy stocks in Cyclical industries vs. Defensives, with a focus on Domestic Cyclicals…Declining bond yields and fears of a stagnating global economy drove the outperformance of defensive, bond-like industries for much of the last three years. The rise in inflation expectations and interest rates during 3Q 2016 drove investors away from firms with high dividend yields and perceived safety into equities with higher sensitivity to economic growth. Following the election, the inflationary nature of President-elect Trump’s fiscal stimulus plans has spurred both bond yields and the Cyclicals vs. Defensives trade higher. A hopeful outlook for Trump policy suggests further upside to this strategy, with the likely Fed hike in December the earliest catalyst…\n2. Buy a sector-neutral basket of S&P 500 firms with high Domestic Sales relative to the most international-facing firms…. Our sector-neutral basket of 50 S&P 500 firms with the highest domestic sales exposure has outperformed our international sales basket by nearly 400 bp post-election (8% vs. 4%). Performance should continue if reflation and a more hawkish Fed drive rates higher, leading to a stronger US dollar, and should also benefit if fiscal spending and tax cuts drive faster domestic economic and profit growth…\n3. Buy stocks from each S&P 500 sector with the highest effective tax rates with the most to gain from potential corporate tax reform…Details of potential corporate tax cuts remain cloudy, but firms currently paying the highest effective tax rates will be the clearest beneficiaries of any tax reform.\nThe S&P 500 has risen 0.1% to 2,206.47 at 10:30 a.m. today, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average has gained 60.30 points, or 0.3%, to 19,181.90. The Nasdaq Composite has fallen 0.4% to 5,360.69.",

      "text": "Steven Mnuchin served as finance director for President-elect Trump's campaign He spent 17 years working at investment firm Goldman Sachs Founded Dune Capital hedge fund He also produced several Hollywood blockbusters including X-Men and Avatar Trump is expected to name billionaire Wilbur Ross to run the Commerce Department He joins two others Goldman Sachs veterans who helmed Treasury \nBy Francesca Chambers, White House Correspondent and Geoff Earle, Deputy Political Editor For Dailymail.com \nPublished: 08:37 EST, 30 November 2016 | Updated: 08:37 EST, 30 November 2016 \nHedge fund manager Steve Mnuchin said this morning that president-elect Donald Trump had selected him to lead Treasury. \nMnuchin spent 17 years working at Goldman Sachs, an investment firm that has produced multiple secretaries of the Treasury, and went on to produce Hollywood blockbusters, before taking the helm of Trump's fundraising operation this year. \nHis selection is the latest example of Trump tapping an insider as he staffs the government and attempts to keep his pledges to 'drain the swamp' and 'Make America Great Again.' \nIn another move to fill out his economic team, Trump tapped billionaire Wilbur Ross to serve as the next secretary of Commerce. \nPresident-elect Donald Trump has selected campaign finance chair Steven Mnuchin to be the next Treasury secretary, transition officials said \nThe duo confirmed their respective appointments on CNBC's Squawk Box. \n'By cutting corporate taxes, we're going to create huge economic growth and we'll have huge personal income,' Mnuchin said on the program. \nDuring the campaign, both Trump and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders blasted rival Hillary Clinton for having delivered paid speeches to Goldman Sachs, a firm that produced past Treasury Secretaries Robert Rubin and Henry Paulson. \nThe New York Times reported Mnuchin's likely pick. \n'We are very focused on lowering business taxes, making sure that U.S. corporations are competitive around the world, bringing back cash from all around the world that's sitting offshore and I think the American public is focused on that,' Mnuchin told CNBC in August. \nTrump has pledged to slash taxes, scrap a Pacific trade deal, remake NAFTA, and impose tariffs on trading partners that take away U.S. jobs. \nMnuchin said on Squawk Box Wednesday top priorities of the Trump administration would be to cut the corporate tax rate from 30 to 15 percent and have a sustained GDP of 3 to 4 percent. \n'To get there, our number one priority is tax reform. This will be the largest tax change since [President Ronald] Reagan,' he said. \nCabinet positions require Senate confirmation. \nMnuchin is engaged to Scottish-born actress Louise Linton \nInvestor Wilbur Ross, Jr. speaks to the media at Trump Tower in a hat he says he got at the meeting \nRoss appeared at Trump Tower on Tuesday, and spoke briefly to reporters afterward while wearing a camo 'Make America Great Again' hat. \n'It was a good enough meeting that they gave me a proper rain hat,' Ross quipped. \nRoss is the head of a lucrative private equity fund that specializes in rescuing failing businesses and turning them around. He'll replace Penny Pritzker - another billionaire - as Commerce secretary if he accepts the job and is confirmed by the Senate. \nPritzker was easily confirmed to the position in 2013, but Ross could face additional scrutiny because of his investments in the steel and natural gas industries, Politico reports. \nRoss has suggested that much of America is disgruntled because the economy has left middle-class workers behind \n'He might be the second-most complicated person in the administration to vet, behind the president-elect himself,' Brookings Institution visiting fellow Norman Eisen told the news publication. \nThe SEC fined him $2.3 million in August for charging his investors management fees he improperly disclosed. Ross voluntarily offered to repay the fees, the SEC said, with interest. \nRoss is viewed by industry experts as someone who would be a strong defender of U.S. workers and would push for stricter enforcement of U.S. trade laws. \n'If America’s trading partners continue to cheat, a President Trump will use all available means to defend American workers and American manufacturing facilities from such cheating, including tariffs,' he said of the Republican's economic plan in a white paper. \nDemocrats immediately blasted the Mnuchin pick. \n'So much for draining the swamp. Nominating Steve Mnuchin to be Treasury Secretary – a billionaire hedge fund manager and Goldman Sachs alumnus who preyed on homeowners struggling during the recession – is a slap in the face to voters who hoped he would shake up Washington,' said Democratic National Committee spokesman Adam Hodge. \n'Trump is already heading into office as the most corrupt, conflicted, and unpopular president-elect in history, and now he’s breaking his signature promise to the voters who elected him,' Hodge added. \nMnuchin, 53, cut his teeth at one of the world's most powerful investment banks. His appointment collides with some of Trump's populist rhetoric from the campaign, where he vowed to close the 'carried interest' loophole and regularly inveighed against big banks and companies that move jobs overseas. \nMnuchin's father also worked at Goldman Sachs starting in 1957, the Wall Street Journal reported, and spent his career there while specializing in a type of block trading. \nWhen he founded Dune Capital, Mnuchin got financial backing from liberal financier George Soros, who was one of multiple capitalists who appeared in a sinister-looking Trump campaign video in the final days of the election. \nTrump said during the campaign that 'hedge fund guys are getting away with murder,' and called for doing away with a tax loophole, even as he called for creating a new 15 per cent rate for those who engage in business partnerships. \nAlthough Trump was outraised by Hillary Clinton, his campaign brought in $255 million to Clinton's $513 million, much of it under Mnuchin's tenure, enough to keep the race competitive with assistance from outside groups despite opposition from many prominent members of the establishment. \nRoss became a bankruptcy specialist at Rothschild Inc. in the 1970s, according to the Journal. He worked on bankruptcies and corporate restructuring deals involving Texaco, TWA, and Continental Airlines.",

      "text": "Donald Trump. Goldman Sachs. What Could Go Wrong? \nDrain the swamp with the people who drained the economy. Most Popular By Charles P. Pierce Nov 30, 2016 Remember back in 2008, when Democratic candidate Barack Obama won a convincing victory over John McCain, who was representing a fairly well discredited Republican Party? The first thing all the sharp people decided that the new president immediately should \"reach out\" and hire some Republicans out of the many who could be found in David Brooks' contact list—like Bob Gates, for example, or that nice Mr. Comey over at FBI. Just to bring the country together, like the new president said he wanted to do, right?   OK. So now there's a new president-elect and nobody is telling him to keep, say, Tom Vilsack at Agriculture, not that he'd listen anyway. Instead, he seems to be trolling for underlings in two places—the executive washrooms of Goldman Sachs, and the comment sections of Fox Nation. Let's take a look at some of the folks whose names are currently under consideration, instead of waiting for El Caudillo del Mar-A-Lago to hire them and make the electric Twitter machine cry mercy again. Most Popular What Exactly Is Happening at Politico? First, there's rootin' tootin' David Clarke, the Lord High Sheriff of Milwaukee and a man who has to dial \"1\" and an area code to reach lunacy. He is said to be a candidate to be Secretary of Homeland Security. With Lawrence O'Donnell on Tuesday night, journalist Roland Martin ran down most of the 411 on this particular resident of the banana farm, including the fact that he's currently under investigation because, in the last couple of months, one inmate in Clarke's jail died of thirst and another one gave birth, only to have the newborn die on the floor . Two years ago, Milwaukee County District Attorney John Chisholm blistered Clarke after Clarke had written an open letter in which he demanded that Chisholm suspend all plea bargains and non-prison sentencing. As The Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel reported at the time: \n\"I know this does not affect you. Your agency does not investigate homicides, nor does it have the capacity to do so after long years of neglect at your hands,\" Chisholm wrote. The DA noted that his office had more than 370 open sexual assault cases. He said taking them all to trial, without considering what is best for victims and the community, would be \"a travesty.\" Like homicides, the cases would back up for years, evidence would go stale and many offenders would avoid conviction and go free, Chisholm said. He also laid out his office's record in prosecuting domestic violence and firearms-related crimes…\"I am tired of the inability of law enforcement to engage in focused efforts to get gun offenders off the street and then blaming prosecutors, judges and state laws for increases in gun violence,\" Chisholm wrote…\"I know it's more fun to style yourself as the lone voice saying things no one else will say, but the things you say have all been said before, and require neither courage nor particular insight. \"The public has a right to see their elected officials are committed to solving problems not engaging in demagoguery,\" Chisholm wrote, before closing with the admonition, \"Get out of the announcer booth, Coach, and get your team on the field.\"   I look forward to DA Chisholm's appearance at Clarke's confirmation hearings. Then there's the outside contender for head of the Environmental Protection Agency, which Trump says he wants to do away with anyway, so who cares. He's apparently considering a woman named Kathleen Hartnett White, a product of that \"business-friendly\" atmosphere of which Texas Republicans are so proud. This has setoff the alarm bells at The Texas Observer . \nDuring her time at TCEQ, White was consistent in her positions: Trying to curb carbon emissions is \"futile,\" renewables are \"a false hope\" and \" carbon dioxide has none of the attributes of a pollutant. \" Among her stranger beliefs is that \" fossil fuels dissolved the economic justification for slavery \" and that the United Nations has \"revealed themselves\" as advocating for communism as \"the only system of government which effectively would reduce carbon dioxide.\"   OK, about that slavery thing. Quoth White: \nIn 1807, the British Parliament finally passed William Wilberforce's bill to abolish the slave trade in the British Empire. In the same year, the largest industrial complex in the world powered and illuminated by coal opened in Manchester, England. Thus began the century-long process of converting mankind's industry from the power of muscle, wood, wind, and water to stored solar energy in fossil fuels. Fossil fuels dissolved the economic justification for slavery. That so much of the British industrial miracle involved American cotton that was not picked by jolly volunteers is one of the many chunks of history through which White apparently slept. Anyway, the more important thing is that she seems to be a true acolyte of America's extraction industries. And she takes pains not to disturb the business-friendly atmosphere while not giving much of a damn about the actual atmosphere. \nAmong the most significant decisions during her time on TCEQ is her handling of a 2003 audit of the agency. The report found that for 80 enforcement cases TCEQ pursued between 2000 and 2003 the agency could have issues $8.6 million in fines, but instead it settled for about $1.6 million. As a result, \"violators often have economic benefits that exceed their penalties, which could reduce their incentive to comply,\" the report's authors noted. And then there's this, which came out Wednesday afternoon, from ABC News . \nThe Palin aide tells ABC News that in \"recent days,\" Palin told Trump transition officials: \"I feel as though the megaphone I have been provided can be used in a productive and positive way to help those desperately in need.\" The VA is the largest government agency with over 300,000 federal employees and a budget of $182 billion for 2017. Oh, why the hell not? The meteor's overdue anyway.",

      "text": "Donald Trump’s nomination of Steven Mnuchin, a former Goldman Sachs partner, to lead the Treasury Department signals a return to power, of sorts, for Wall Street’s most powerful firm. As POLITICO’s Ben White notes , it’s been nearly a decade since the venerable firm had an alum in a prominent position. Now, Goldman “ is dominating the early days of the incoming Trump administration. The newly picked Treasury Secretary, Steven Mnuchin, spent 17 years at Goldman. Trump’s top incoming White House adviser, Steve Bannon, spent his early career at the bank. So did Anthony Scaramucci, one of Trump’s top transition advisers.”\nMeanwhile, Mnuchin himself is under scrutiny. As POLITICO’s Kenneth P. Vogel and Isaac Arnsdorf report , “Mnuchin, earned tens of millions of dollars from a 2015 bank sale that got a boost from an array of non-profit groups that had one thing in common — they had received tens of thousands of dollars each from the bank’s foundation, which was run by Mnuchin.”\nAnd Senate Democrats are criticizing the pick and saying it diminishes Trump’s populist message, POLITICO’s Zachary Warmbrodt reports, with “leading liberal Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) shred(ding) Trump's announcement that he would nominate the Goldman Sachs alum and hedge fund executive to his administration's top economic policy post.”\nElsewhere in Donald Trump’s transition:\nETHICS TWEETSTORM: Obama’s ethics office went on a somewhat bizarre tweetstorm, praising Donald Trump for divesting himself from his businesses.\nWELCOME, JARED: Israel’s top diplomat says his country would welcome Donald Trump’s son-in-law if he’d like to try and broker peace between Israelis and Palestinians.\nGING-GRINCH: Newt Gingrich mocked Mitt Romney for “sucking up” to Donald Trump.\nSOLID GOLDMAN: Goldman Sachs shares soared after Donald Trump announced Steven Mnuchin’s appointment to the Treasury Department.\nTAKEOVER BID: Trump’s meeting with Mitt Romney secured his takeover, if it was in doubt, of the Republican Party. ( Washington Post )\nBREIT LIGHT: Breitbart is seeing some advertisers leave, post election. ( Los Angeles Times )\nCONVERSION THERAPY: The New York Times examines the claim that Vice President-elect Mike Pence supports so-called “conversion therapy.”\nAnd, there you have it, you’re caught up on the the Trump transition. Happy Wednesday night. Here’s some zen music .",

      "text": "They’re ba-ack!\nAfter falling out of favor in Washington, DC, in the nearly 10-year stretch following the bursting of the housing bubble, Goldman Sachs is poised for a remarkable comeback to the corridors of power.\nAfter tapping former Goldman partner Steven Mnuchin to be his Treasury secretary , President-elect Donald Trump now has two former executives of the powerhouse bank head by Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein in position to formulate the country’s fiscal policy.\nFormer Goldman Vice President Stephen Bannon was previously named Trump’s chief strategist.\nGoldman’s move back to the center of the nation’s financial decision-making will be further cemented if, as expected, current Chief Operating Officer Gary Cohn is named Trump’s budget chief.\nGary Cohn Photo: Getty Images In addition, Anthony Scaramucci, one of Trump’s inner-circle transition advisers, cut his teeth at Goldman.\nWhat makes the Goldman Sachs comeback even more startling is that just over three weeks ago, Wall Street’s smart money had Hillary Clinton winning — and Goldman spending at least another four years sidelined.\n“This just would not have happened if Hillary was elected,” said one Goldman source, noting that she was criticized for making too much money from paid Goldman speeches.\n“Given the campaign rhetoric, [Goldman’s return to power] is very ironic,” the source said.\nDuring one Republican presidential primary debate, Trump attacked both rival Ted Cruz, whose wife was a Goldman managing director, and his future general election opponent, Clinton, as Goldman pawns.\nA Goldman spokesman said the bank “has encouraged its employees to give back to the community while they are working here and after they leave. We are proud that many have gone on to serve their country.”\nLawyer Richard Farley, with Kramer Levin, the author of “Wall Street Wars: The Epic Battles With Washington that Created the Modern Financial System,” said presidents often turn to Wall Street execs for Treasury secretary because they are among the only ones who really understand the global economy.\n“I think just understanding the plumbing of the financial system, given how complicated it is, makes it almost necessary to have someone who understands it.”\nThe choice of a Goldman alum for Treasury boss did not sit well with everyone.\n“It’s a horrid appointment,” President Reagan’s former Office of Management and Budget Director David Stockman told The Post.\n“We don’t need another plenipotentiary from Goldman Sachs and crony capitalist speculator who made billions off the backs of taxpayers,” he said.\nWhile President Obama did not tap Goldman execs for the key positions, President George W. Bush named Goldman CEO Henry Paulson his Treasury secretary, and President Clinton named Goldman co-Chair Robert Rubin to the same post.\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google WhatsApp Email Copy",

      "title": "Hope Is a Strategy…and Other Insights From Goldman Sachs",
      "text": "By Ben Levisohn By now, you’ve probably seen the headlines touting Goldman Sachs’ 2017 outlook for the stock market . Strategist David Kostin and team argue that the S&P 500 will hit 2,400 during the first half of the year as hope–for lower taxes , less regulation, and fiscal stimulus–takes hold, but will drop to 2,300 by the end of the year, as fear–of inflation , rising labor costs and higher interests rates–spur profit taking. But for now, hope really is a strategy, Kostin says. Here’s how to play it:\nGetty Images 1. Buy stocks in Cyclical industries vs. Defensives, with a focus on Domestic Cyclicals…Declining bond yields and fears of a stagnating global economy drove the outperformance of defensive, bond-like industries for much of the last three years. The rise in inflation expectations and interest rates during 3Q 2016 drove investors away from firms with high dividend yields and perceived safety into equities with higher sensitivity to economic growth. Following the election, the inflationary nature of President-elect Trump’s fiscal stimulus plans has spurred both bond yields and the Cyclicals vs. Defensives trade higher. A hopeful outlook for Trump policy suggests further upside to this strategy, with the likely Fed hike in December the earliest catalyst…\n2. Buy a sector-neutral basket of S&P 500 firms with high Domestic Sales relative to the most international-facing firms…. Our sector-neutral basket of 50 S&P 500 firms with the highest domestic sales exposure has outperformed our international sales basket by nearly 400 bp post-election (8% vs. 4%). Performance should continue if reflation and a more hawkish Fed drive rates higher, leading to a stronger US dollar, and should also benefit if fiscal spending and tax cuts drive faster domestic economic and profit growth…\n3. Buy stocks from each S&P 500 sector with the highest effective tax rates with the most to gain from potential corporate tax reform…Details of potential corporate tax cuts remain cloudy, but firms currently paying the highest effective tax rates will be the clearest beneficiaries of any tax reform.\nThe S&P 500 has risen 0.1% to 2,206.47 at 10:30 a.m. today, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average has gained 60.30 points, or 0.3%, to 19,181.90. The Nasdaq Composite has fallen 0.4% to 5,360.69.",

Up Next More videos Mnuchin 'relatively safe choice' says analyst \nPresident-elect Donald Trump picks ex-Goldman Sachs Steven Mnuchin to lead the US Treasury Department and Wall Street breathes a sigh of relief, says an analyst. \nThe story of how an aspiring actress and an ambitious businessman's lives change in \"unpredictable and incredible ways\" has parallels with Trump's journey to the White House. \nMnuchin the \"actor\" has a cameo role as a Merrill Lynch banker, but the 53-year-old is no stranger to Wall Street. SHARE Pin to Pinterest PIN Link Steven Mnuchin the \"actor\" has a cameo role as a Merrill Lynch banker in his latest film, but the 53-year-old is no stranger to Wall Street Photo: Bloomberg \nFollowing in the footsteps of his father Robert, he become a banker at Goldman Sachs in 1985 after studying at Yale. He worked there for 17 years, including a period in mortgage-backed securities in the mid-1990s, where he rose to the role of vice-chairman of the division. Advertisement \nBillionaire George Soros hired him in 2003 to start a new business focused on buying risky debt. \nSoros Fund Management, Soros's business, was seen by many as Mnuchin's move from banking to the hedge fund industry. SHARE Mnuchin now counts Suicide Squad, American Sniper and even Magic Mike XXL among his producer credits. Photo: Supplied \nBut Mnuchin wouldn't be front runner for a job with The Donald if he didn't bring with him at least a bit of glamour. \nIn 2004, backed by Soros, Mnuchin founded Dune Capital Management with two former Goldman colleagues. The company quickly expanded into the entertainment business, partnering with 21st Century Fox to back Avatar , one of the highest grossing films in history. \nMnuchin now counts Suicide Squad, American Sniper and even Magic Mike XXL among his producer credits after forming RatPac Entertainment, which merged with Dune a few years ago to become RatPac-Dune Entertainment. \nAlso rather like Trump - who flirted with different political parties before settling on the Republicans - Mnuchin and his family have aligned themselves more with the Democrats than Republicans in the past. \nHe has donated to Hillary Clinton's past campaigns, according to electoral commission records, including the maximum $US2300 ($3111) to her presidential primary bid in 2007. He later backed Barack Obama's bid. \nThe new Treasury Secretary has also donated to campaigns run by John Edwards, John Kerry and Al Gore, according to Dow Jones. \nRecords show Mitt Romney is the only Republican presidential candidate Mnuchin has ever donated to, although, in an interview with Dow Jones, Mnuchin said that \"for as long as I can remember voting\" he has been a registered Republican. \nTrump appointed Mnuchin as his national finance chairman earlier this year, to cultivate a network of small donors to help the president-elect compete with Clinton. \nMnuchin will follow in the footsteps of fellow Goldman bankers Hank Paulson, who served under George W. Bush, and Robert Rubin, who served under Bill Clinton, if his appointment is approved by the Senate. \nMnuchin, who will play a key role in Trump's tax-cutting plans, called on Wednesday for the largest tax overhaul since Reaganomics. \n\"We think by cutting corporate taxes we'll create huge economic growth and we'll have huge personal income,\" he told CNBC. \nHe also called for the tax system to be simplified. \n\"Taxes are way too complicated and people spend way too much time worrying about ways to get them lower,\" he said. \nTrump has described him as \"a professional at the highest level with an extensive and very successful financial background\". \nDemocrats, meanwhile, have been voicing their disquiet at his likely appointment, describing it as a \"slap in the face\" to voters who hoped Trump \"would shake up Washington\". \n\"So much for draining the swamp,\" said Adam Hodge, spokesman for the Democratic National Committee. \nMnuchin was also dragged into the Bernie Madoff scandal in 2010 when Irving Picard, the court-appointed trustee charged with recovering victims' cash, alleged that millions of dollars that Mnuchin and his brother inherited from their mother when she died represented fictitious profits from the Ponzi scheme. \nBut the court ruled that the withdrawals had occurred more than two years before the scheme collapsed. \nMnuchin is engaged to Scottish actress Louise Linton, who recently came under fire for her memoir about living in Africa. He was previously married to Heather Crosby, with whom he has three children. \nThe Daily Telegraph, London",

      "title": "Trump's Treasury secretary pick is a very, very lucky man",
      "text": "AP \n\nSteven Mnuchin has made a career out of being lucky.\nThe former Goldman Sachs banker nominated to become Donald Trump's treasury secretary had the perspicacity to purchase a collapsed subprime mortgage lender soon after the financial crisis, getting a sweet deal from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation . Now, if he's confirmed, he will likely be able to take advantage of a tax perk given to government officials.\nMnuchin was born into a family of Wall Street royalty. His father was an investment banker at Goldman Sachs for 30 years, serving in top management. He and his brother landed at the powerful firm, too. After making millions in mortgage trading, Mnuchin struck out on his own, creating a hedge fund and building a record of smart and well-timed investment moves.\nHe dodged disaster when he inherited his mother's portfolio. She was a longtime investor with Bernie Madoff, the largest Ponzi schemer in American history. After she died in early 2005, Mnuchin and his brother quickly liquidated her investments , making $3.2 million. The Madoff trustee, Irving Picard, sued to retrieve the money from the Mnuchins, as he did from other Ponzi scheme winners, contending that they were fake gains. A court ruled that Picard could only claw back money from those who had cashed out within two years before the collapse. The Mnuchins, having pulled out roughly three years before, got to keep their Madoff money. That something was dodgy about Madoff was an open secret on Wall Street.\nAfter the financial crisis, the FDIC seized IndyMac, whose irresponsible mortgage loans failed as the housing bubble burst. Desperate to offload the bank, the FDIC subsidized the takeover by sheltering Mnuchin and his team of investors, including hedge fund managers John Paulson and George Soros, from losses. The investors injected $1.55 billion into the bank in 2009 . They changed the name to OneWest and five years later, sold it to lender CIT for more than $3 billion, doubling their investment.\nAP \nMnuchin also benefitted from what may have been a nice fluke a little later. He served as the co-chair of Relativity Media, a film and entertainment company, for about eight months until May 2015. Relativity filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in July 2015. Just before it collapsed, Relativity paid off a $50 million loan to Mnuchin's bank, OneWest, in full.\nPaying off one creditor in full just before filing for bankruptcy looks questionable, especially when there is the appearance that such a deal isn't at arm's length. One Relativity investor cried fraud and sued in 2015, contending that Relativity used its loans for improper purposes, including to make payments to OneWest. Mnuchin's lawyer called the claims preposterous and the suit was initially thrown out. A lawyer for the investor, a film financing company, told the Los Angeles Times that it planned to refile .\nMnuchin was blessed again when the Obama administration did not crack down harder on foreclosure abuses. OneWest got a reputation among activists and borrowers as one of the more feckless banks, accused of throwing borrowers out of their homes, denying mortgage modifications , and targeting the elderly with exploitative reverse mergers. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency settled with OneWest, and over a dozen other banks and mortgage servicers, over its robosigning practices in 2011.\nThat regulatory settlement, called the Independent Foreclosure Review, was an utter debacle , as ProPublica has detailed. Regulators set up a process for consultants to review how the servicers had handled modification reviews, which meant in effect that the banks were monitoring themselves. The regulators did not punish any top financial executives over foreclosure mistreatment. In a happy circumstance for Mnuchin, the Department of Justice and state attorneys general did not include OneWest in their subsequent and more punitive settlement over foreclosure bad behavior.\nAP \nMnuchin was fortunate once more to pick the right candidate, Trump, early; most of Wall Street assumed that Hillary Clinton would win and bet accordingly with its political donations.\nWhat good happenstance, then, that Trump didn't mean what he said about Wall Street on the campaign trail.\nOn the stump, Trump said, \"We will never be able to fix a rigged system by counting on the people who rigged it in the first place.\" He attacked Goldman Sachs by name, saying that the bank \"owns\" Ted Cruz, whose wife worked at the firm. \" I know the guys at Goldman Sachs ,\" he said, \"They have total, total control over [Cruz]. Just like they have total control over Hillary Clinton.\" Trump put an image of Goldman CEO and chairman Lloyd Blankfein, along with other Jewish figures in finance like George Soros and Janet Yellen, in a commercial late in the campaign that was widely decried as anti-Semitic .\nTrump did not feel such a strong antipathy for Goldman that he passed over a firm veteran to be his treasury secretary.\nMnuchin still owned $97 million of CIT stock as of last February. The Treasury Department will likely require him to sell those shares, since it poses a conflict of interest for the treasury secretary to own a stake in a financial institution. But therein lies a final good break for Mnuchin: According to a provision of the tax code, he can defer taxes , as long as he complies with certain conditions. That benefit, available to all officials who are required to sell investments upon taking a government job, could be worth millions to Mnuchin.\nNOW WATCH: Watch the trailer for the new Martin Scorsese film that took over 20 years to make \n",

      "text": "Steven Mnuchin. AP\nSteven Mnuchin has made a career out of being lucky.\nThe former Goldman Sachs banker nominated to become Donald Trump's treasury secretary had the perspicacity to purchase a collapsed subprime mortgage lender soon after the financial crisis, getting a sweet deal from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation . Now, if he's confirmed, he will likely be able to take advantage of a tax perk given to government officials.\nMnuchin was born into a family of Wall Street royalty. His father was an investment banker at Goldman Sachs for 30 years, serving in top management. He and his brother landed at the powerful firm, too. After making millions in mortgage trading, Mnuchin struck out on his own, creating a hedge fund and building a record of smart and well-timed investment moves.\nHe dodged disaster when he inherited his mother's portfolio. She was a longtime investor with Bernie Madoff, the largest Ponzi schemer in American history. After she died in early 2005, Mnuchin and his brother quickly liquidated her investments , making $3.2 million. The Madoff trustee, Irving Picard, sued to retrieve the money from the Mnuchins, as he did from other Ponzi scheme winners, contending that they were fake gains. A court ruled that Picard could only claw back money from those who had cashed out within two years before the collapse. The Mnuchins, having pulled out roughly three years before, got to keep their Madoff money. That something was dodgy about Madoff was an open secret on Wall Street.\nAfter the financial crisis, the FDIC seized IndyMac, whose irresponsible mortgage loans failed as the housing bubble burst. Desperate to offload the bank, the FDIC subsidized the takeover by sheltering Mnuchin and his team of investors, including hedge fund managers John Paulson and George Soros, from losses. The investors injected $1.55 billion into the bank in 2009 . They changed the name to OneWest and five years later, sold it to lender CIT for more than $3 billion, doubling their investment.\nSteven Mnuchin. AP\nMnuchin also benefitted from what may have been a nice fluke a little later. He served as the co-chair of Relativity Media, a film and entertainment company, for about eight months until May 2015. Relativity filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in July 2015. Just before it collapsed, Relativity paid off a $50 million loan to Mnuchin's bank, OneWest, in full.\nPaying off one creditor in full just before filing for bankruptcy looks questionable, especially when there is the appearance that such a deal isn't at arm's length. One Relativity investor cried fraud and sued in 2015, contending that Relativity used its loans for improper purposes, including to make payments to OneWest. Mnuchin's lawyer called the claims preposterous and the suit was initially thrown out. A lawyer for the investor, a film financing company, told the Los Angeles Times that it planned to refile .\nMnuchin was blessed again when the Obama administration did not crack down harder on foreclosure abuses. OneWest got a reputation among activists and borrowers as one of the more feckless banks, accused of throwing borrowers out of their homes, denying mortgage modifications , and targeting the elderly with exploitative reverse mergers. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency settled with OneWest, and over a dozen other banks and mortgage servicers, over its robosigning practices in 2011.\nThat regulatory settlement, called the Independent Foreclosure Review, was an utter debacle , as ProPublica has detailed. Regulators set up a process for consultants to review how the servicers had handled modification reviews, which meant in effect that the banks were monitoring themselves. The regulators did not punish any top financial executives over foreclosure mistreatment. In a happy circumstance for Mnuchin, the Department of Justice and state attorneys general did not include OneWest in their subsequent and more punitive settlement over foreclosure bad behavior.\nHillary Clinton at her concession speech in New York. Justin Sullivan/Getty Images\nMnuchin was fortunate once more to pick the right candidate, Trump, early; most of Wall Street assumed that Hillary Clinton would win and bet accordingly with its political donations.\nWhat good happenstance, then, that Trump didn't mean what he said about Wall Street on the campaign trail.\nOn the stump, Trump said, \"We will never be able to fix a rigged system by counting on the people who rigged it in the first place.\" He attacked Goldman Sachs by name, saying that the bank \"owns\" Ted Cruz, whose wife worked at the firm. \" I know the guys at Goldman Sachs ,\" he said, \"They have total, total control over [Cruz]. Just like they have total control over Hillary Clinton.\" Trump put an image of Goldman CEO and chairman Lloyd Blankfein, along with other Jewish figures in finance like George Soros and Janet Yellen, in a commercial late in the campaign that was widely decried as anti-Semitic .\nTrump did not feel such a strong antipathy for Goldman that he passed over a firm veteran to be his treasury secretary.\nMnuchin still owned $97 million of CIT stock as of last February. The Treasury Department will likely require him to sell those shares, since it poses a conflict of interest for the treasury secretary to own a stake in a financial institution. But therein lies a final good break for Mnuchin: According to a provision of the tax code, he can defer taxes , as long as he complies with certain conditions. That benefit, available to all officials who are required to sell investments upon taking a government job, could be worth millions to Mnuchin.\nRead the original article on ProPublica .

      "title": "Steve Mnuchin, Trump's treasury secretary pick, is a lucky man",
      "text": "| License Photo Steven Mnuchin has made a career out of being lucky.\nThe former Goldman Sachs banker nominated to become Donald Trump 's treasury secretary had the perspicacity to purchase a collapsed subprime mortgage lender soon after the financial crisis, getting a sweet deal from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. Now, if he's confirmed, he will likely be able to take advantage of a tax perk given to government officials.\nMnuchin was born into a family of Wall Street royalty. His father was an investment banker at Goldman Sachs for 30 years, serving in top management. He and his brother landed at the powerful firm, too. After making millions in mortgage trading, Mnuchin struck out on his own, creating a hedge fund and building a record of smart and well-timed investment moves.\nHe dodged disaster when he inherited his mother's portfolio. She was a longtime investor with Bernie Madoff , the largest Ponzi schemer in American history. After she died in early 2005, Mnuchin and his brother quickly liquidated her investments , making $3.2 million. The Madoff trustee, Irving Picard , sued to retrieve the money from the Mnuchins, as he did from other Ponzi scheme winners, contending that they were fake gains. A court ruled that Picard could only claw back money from those who had cashed out within two years before the collapse. The Mnuchins, having pulled out roughly three years before, got to keep their Madoff money. That something was dodgy about Madoff was an open secret on Wall Street.\nAfter the financial crisis, the FDIC seized IndyMac, whose irresponsible mortgage loans failed as the housing bubble burst. Desperate to offload the bank, the FDIC subsidized the takeover by sheltering Mnuchin and his team of investors, including hedge fund managers John Paulson and George Soros , from losses. The investors injected $1.55 billion into the bank in 2009 . They changed the name to OneWest and five years later, sold it to lender CIT for more than $3 billion, doubling their investment.\nMnuchin also benefited from what may have been a nice fluke a little later. He served as the co-chairman of Relativity Media, a film and entertainment company, for about eight months until May 2015. Relativity filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in July 2015. Just before it collapsed, Relativity paid off a $50 million loan to Mnuchin's bank, OneWest, in full.\nPaying off one creditor in full just before filing for bankruptcy looks questionable, especially when there is the appearance that such a deal isn't at arm's length. One Relativity investor cried fraud and sued in 2015, contending that Relativity used its loans for improper purposes, including to make payments to OneWest. Mnuchin's lawyer called the claims preposterous and the suit was initially thrown out. A lawyer for the investor, a film financing company, told the Los Angeles Times that it planned to refile .\nMnuchin was blessed again when the Obama administration did not crack down harder on foreclosure abuses. OneWest got a reputation among activists and borrowers as one of the more feckless banks, accused of throwing borrowers out of their homes, denying mortgage modifications , and targeting the elderly with reverse mortgages. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency settled with OneWest, and over a dozen other banks and mortgage servicers, over its robo-signing practices in 2011. That regulatory settlement, called the Independent Foreclosure Review, was an utter debacle , as ProPublica has detailed. Regulators set up a process for consultants to review how the servicers had handled modification reviews, which meant in effect that the banks were monitoring themselves. The regulators did not punish any top financial executives over foreclosure mistreatment. In a happy circumstance for Mnuchin, the Department of Justice and state attorneys general did not include OneWest in their subsequent and more punitive settlement over foreclosure bad behavior.\nMnuchin was fortunate once more to pick the right candidate, Trump, early; most of Wall Street assumed that Hillary Clinton would win and bet accordingly with its political donations.\nWhat good happenstance, then, that Trump didn't mean what he said about Wall Street on the campaign trail.\nOn the stump, Trump said, \"We will never be able to fix a rigged system by counting on the people who rigged it in the first place.\" He attacked Goldman Sachs by name, saying that the bank \"owns\" Ted Cruz , whose wife worked at the firm. \" I know the guys at Goldman Sachs ,\" he said, \"They have total, total control over [Cruz]. Just like they have total control over Hillary Clinton.\" Trump put an image of Goldman CEO and chairman Lloyd Blankfein , along with other Jewish figures in finance like George Soros and Janet Yellen , in a commercial late in the campaign that was widely decried as anti-Semitic .\nTrump did not feel such a strong antipathy for Goldman that he passed over a firm veteran to be his treasury secretary.\nMnuchin still owned $97 million of CIT stock as of last February. The Treasury Department will likely require him to sell those shares, since it poses a conflict of interest for the treasury secretary to own a stake in a financial institution. But therein lies a final good break for Mnuchin: According to a provision of the tax code, he can defer taxes , as long as he complies with certain conditions. That benefit, available to all officials who are required to sell investments upon taking a government job, could be worth millions to Mnuchin.\nProPublica is a Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative newsroom.

      "text": "Goldman Sachs said that OPEC’s agreement to slash oil output would “unleash a sharp production” response in the United States and the rest of the world.\nOPEC agreed on Wednesday to its first oil output cuts since 2008 after Saudi Arabia accepted “a big hit” on its production and dropped its demand on arch-rival Iran to slash output.\n“This is a short duration cut, targeting excess inventories and not high oil prices, which would instead unleash a sharp production response both in the U.S. and in the rest of the world,” the U.S. investment bank said in a note.\nNon-OPEC Russia will also join output reductions for the first time in 15 years to help the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries prop up oil prices.\n“The catalysts for a further rally in prices will need to come from confirmation of participation by non-OPEC producers, evidence of compliance by OPEC producers and more clarity on what Iran has agreed to do given conflicting numbers in the official agreement,” Goldman said.\nThe bank forecast WTI crude prices touching $55 per barrel and Brent crude $56.50 in the first half of 2017, based on historical compliance to announced quotas and assuming a 33 million-barrels-per-day realized OPEC output in the first half of 2017 as well as a freeze in Russian production.\nOPEC produces a third of global oil, or around 33.6 million barrels a day. Under the Wednesday deal, it would reduce output by about 1.2 million bpd from January 2017.\nOil soared more than 10 percent on Wednesday to over $50 a barrel, its highest in a month.\nSource: Reuters (Reporting by Vijaykumar Vedala in Bengaluru; Editing by Peter Cooney)",

      "text": "by Sarah Butcher 11 hours ago \nInvestment banks are conservative when it comes to hiring university students. The Big Four accountancy firms, a lot less so.  en/267458/goldman-sachs-analyst-collapse-frankfurt/ \nInvestment banks are conservative when it comes to hiring university students. They might say they like hiring liberal arts graduates , but our own research suggests otherwise: they really like to hire 21 year old finance and economics graduates from places like the London School of Economics and NYU Stern. \nThe Big Four accounting firms are a bit more open minded. They’re still difficult to get into, but they’re twice as easy to get into as top banks. The Financial Times reports, for example, that PWC accepts anything from 5% to 10% of applicants depending upon division and office. This compares to acceptance rates of just 1.8% at Goldman Sachs and 2% at J.P. Morgan. \nMost notably though, the Big Four are a lot more open-minded about who they hire than banks are. While banks still have a tendency to recruit from among the middle and upper middle classes, firms like Deloitte are eliminating names and colleges from students’ application forms in an effort to combat discrimination. Once in a while, the Big Four are also willing to make the kinds of idiosyncratic hires that would be inconceivable in investment banks. – PWC’s strangest recent hire to its graduate program was reportedly a 55 year-old former farmer. The chance of someone with a similar profile becoming a first year analyst at J.P. Morgan is approximately 0%. \nSeparately, if you thought Steve Mnuchin’s career at Goldman Sachs was gilded by family connections, how about Mike Esposito’s? The new chairman of Goldman’s financing group is the brother of Jim Esposito, chief strategy officer for the securities division and a likely contender for the role of head of securities across the firm. Mike’s other brother, John, is head of the financial institutions group at Morgan Stanley and his father was CFO of Chase Manhattan in the 1980s. Who said Goldman Sachs likes to hire people who’ve excelled despite a difficult start in life? Meanwhile: \nWhen you’re asked why you want to work for Goldman Sachs, don’t say: “It seems like a really great place to work.” (Business Insider) \nCredit Suisse is cutting 1,300 jobs in Switzerland! (This is no big deal given that it promised to cut 1,600 last year). (Bloomberg) \nJames Gorman sold some Morgan Stanley stock for the first time since he became CEO. (Seeking Alpha) \nThe UK government promised Barclays and Goldman Sachs (among others) that it will ensure London remains a key financial hub aftet Brexit. (Bloomberg) \nThanks to MiFID II, equity researchers in Europe will be able to live by the sea and earn approx $100k selling their research to independent platforms . (Gadfly) \nHedge fund CQS has cut 20% of staff, says it’s adapting. (Reuters) \nDeutsche Bank broke its hiring freeze (again) to bring on two big fintech names. (WSJ) \nA survey of all main strategies in machine learning. (Medium) \nAnyone can now access Google’s Deep Mind training platform.

      "text": "Looking for a new forex broker? Compare Brokers What two questions do Goldman Sachs want answered by the ECB? Tue 6 Dec 2016 16:31:58 GMT Author: Goldman Sachs need only two questions answered on Thursday Will there be a formal taper decision? If not, will Draghi hint that one will come soon? If the answer is yes then EURUSD would go up substantially. However, their base case remains that QE remains in place at the current rate into late 2017. They also comment on the scenario where the ECB might decide to pump at lower for longer. \"Some have been discussing scenarios that aim to split the difference for the ECB, for example tapering purchases to a monthly pace of EUR 40-50 bn, but then extending the program for longer, say through Q1 2018. We think such proposals fail to take account of how skeptical markets have become where the ECB is concerned. After all, the December 2015 meeting and the misfire in March of this year have taught markets to be extremely skeptical as to the ECB's willingness and ability to ease.\" It looks they've got all the bases covered in this one ;-) I'm still favouring the lower for longer approach as it keeps a dovish/easing bias whilst naturally tapering. To a certain extent, the end date doesn't really matter, that can be kicked or shortened as much as they like. If we do see a pronounced pick up in inflation in the new year then they'd already be halfway there with the lower purchase amounts. Lastly, it's not 100% definite that we get the full workings at this meeting. They could punt by saying that they have their plan but they'll wait until the new year before giving us the numbers to go with it. Either way, I still think the euro is going to be a screaming buy on a decent ECB (and following Fed) induced dip, to run next year. ; About Us \nAll the biggest trading floors in the world have screens locked on ForexLive™.
