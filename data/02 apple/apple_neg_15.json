      "text": "The Better One Between MacBook Pro Sans Touch Bar vs. MacBook Air \nIn exchange of the missing Videos app and widget, Apple is pushing for the new TV app to be the go-to hub for video content that’s shared across multiple devices. Apple has also introduced the replacement TV widget in the previous beta . \nAnother feature that’s been removed from the upcoming beta is the SOS functionality that was supposed to provide users a means to call emergency services by just pressing the power button for a couple of times. For some reason, the feature has become an exclusive functionality in iOS India. \nMeanwhile, if there are things that have been eliminated, there are also features that have been added into the software. The new beta version now comes with “Send With Love” screen effect in the Messages app. Another new feature is the “Up Next” feature in the TV app, which is designed to keep track of content users watched and recommended similar ones across supported devices. Speaking of the TV app, it now has its own section in the Settings app where users can choose between streaming content via cellular data or Wi-Fi. \nAccording to AppleInsider , the new beta version has the build code 14C5077b. The site says registered developers can download the software update over-the-air if they have the previous beta installed on their devices.

      "title": "Designed by Apple in California Chronicles 20 Years of Apple Design",
      "text": "Blog This \nApple® today announced the release of a new hardbound book chronicling 20 years of Apple’s design, expressed through 450 photographs of past and current Apple products. Designed by Apple in California , which covers products from 1998’s iMac® to 2015’s Apple Pencil®, also documents the materials and techniques used by Apple’s design team over two decades of innovation. \nThe book is dedicated to the memory of Steve Jobs. \n“The idea of genuinely trying to make something great for humanity was Steve’s motivation from the beginning, and it remains both our ideal and our goal as Apple looks to the future,” said Jony Ive, Apple’s chief design officer. “This archive is intended to be a gentle gathering of many of the products the team has designed over the years. We hope it brings some understanding to how and why they exist, while serving as a resource for students of all design disciplines.” \nThe products in this book are the result of a profoundly close collaboration between many different groups. Shot by photographer Andrew Zuckerman in a deliberately spare style, the book’s 450 images illustrate Apple’s design process as well as its finished products. \nIn the book’s foreword, Ive explains: While this is a design book, it is not about the design team, the creative process, or product development. It is an objective representation of our work that, ironically, describes who we are. It describes how we work, our values, our preoccupations, and our goals. We have always hoped to be defined by what we do rather than by what we say. We strive, with varying degrees of success, to define objects that appear effortless. Objects that appear so simple, coherent, and inevitable that there could be no rational alternative. \nDesigned by Apple in California is available in two sizes and printed on specially milled, custom-dyed paper with gilded matte silver edges, using eight color separations and low-ghost ink. This linen-bound, hardcover volume was developed over an eight-year period. It is published by Apple. \nPricing & Availability \nDesigned by Apple in California will be available beginning tomorrow, Wednesday, November 16, in small (10.20” x 12.75”) at $199 (US) and large (13” x 16.25”) at $299 (US) exclusively from Apple.com in Australia, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, Korea, Taiwan, the UK and the US, and select Apple Stores.* \nThe book is on display at the Apple Stores where it is sold. \n* Designed by Apple in California is available at the following Apple retail locations: Apple Regent Street and Apple Covent Garden in London; Apple Opera in Paris; Apple Kurfürstendamm in Berlin; Apple ifc mall and Apple Canton Road in Hong Kong; Apple Ginza in Tokyo; and Apple Sydney. \nIn the United States: Apple SoHo, Apple Fifth Avenue, Apple Upper East Side, Apple Williamsburg and Apple World Trade Center in New York; Apple The Grove in Los Angeles and Apple Third Street in Santa Monica; Apple North Michigan Avenue and Apple Lincoln Road in Chicago; Apple Northpark in Dallas; Apple Union Square in San Francisco; Apple Palo Alto and Apple Infinite Loop in Cupertino. \nApple revolutionized personal technology with the introduction of the Macintosh in 1984. Today, Apple leads the world in innovation with iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple Watch and Apple TV. Apple’s four software platforms — iOS, macOS, watchOS and tvOS — provide seamless experiences across all Apple devices and empower people with breakthrough services including the App Store, Apple Music, Apple Pay and iCloud. Apple’s more than 100,000 employees are dedicated to making the best products on earth, and to leaving the world better than we found it. \nNOTE TO EDITORS: For additional information visit Apple’s PR website ( www.apple.com/pr ), or call Apple’s Media Helpline at (408) 974-2042. \n© 2016 Apple Inc.

      "text": "Apple's hottest new product is a $299 book that features photos of its past products. \"Designed by Apple in California\" begins with the 1998 iMac that jumpstarted Apple's turnaround, and it ends with the 2015 Apple Pencil, a stylus for the iPad Pro. \nThe iMac is a logical place to start the book. Steve Jobs took the helm a year before the iMac's debut. \nJobs killed off ineffective, poorly designed products of the prior era, including the futuristic Newton tablet. The iMac was a bold departure from the computers of the time. It was among the first PCs with an all-in-one design, and its colorful plastic shell made the iMac distinctive. It is on display at several art and design museums around the world. \nAlso included in the book are several less successful products. \nFor example, the G4 Cube was a noted flop. The Power Mac won praise for its innovative design, but it was expensive and impractical and couldn't be upgraded. \nThe Apple ( AAPL , Tech30 ) Watch has also failed to become the sensation that many in the tech industry expected it to. \nBut there are plenty of big winners in the book, including the iPhone. Introduced in 2007, it was a sensation and way ahead of its time. Apple's iPhone design hasn't diverged much from the original over the past nine years. \nThe book \n\"Designed by Apple in California\" is hardcover and comes in two sizes -- a small version for $199 and a larger version for $299. \nIn classic Apple form, the book itself was carefully and thoughtfully designed: It is \"printed on specially milled, custom-dyed paper with gilded matte silver edges, using eight color separations and low-ghost ink,\" according to the company's website . The book is bound with linen. \nPhotographer Andrew Zuckerman shot the 450 images in the book, captured in \"a deliberately spare style.\" They include both the finished products and some of the gadgets' internal construction. \nTo follow Apple news in real time, download CNN MoneyStream \nThe guts are just as important to Apple and its fanatics as the outside. When he oversaw design of Apple's original products in the 1980s, Jobs famously instructed his team to make the inside as beautiful as the outside -- sometimes to the detriment of the products' usability. He even had the original Macintosh team's signatures engraved on the inside of each computer. \nAppropriately, the book is dedicated to Jobs' memory. \n\"The idea of genuinely trying to make something great for humanity was Steve's motivation from the beginning, and it remains both our ideal and our goal as Apple looks to the future,\" Jony Ive, Apple's chief design officer, said in a statement. \nIve wrote the book's forward. He said he hopes the book can be a resource for design students. \n\"We strive, with varying degrees of success, to define objects that appear effortless,\" Ive said. \"Objects that appear so simple, coherent, and inevitable that there could be no rational alternative.\" \nThe book goes on sale Wednesday on Apple.com and in many Apple Stores across the world. \nCNNMoney (New York) First published November 15, 2016: 8:18 AM ET",

      "title": "Apple considering expansion into augmented reality glasses: Report",
      "text": "A \nLOS ANGELES: Apple is currently testing wearable augmented-reality glasses that the tech giant could launch as early as 2018, Bloomberg reported on Tuesday (Nov 15). \nThe Apple AR glasses would work with iPhones to display images and other information, and may include other augmented-reality features, according to the report, which cited anonymous sources. The company has ordered a small number of \"near-eye displays\" from a supplier for testing, per the Bloomberg report. \nChief Executive Tim Cook, who has been struggling with a slowdown in iPhone sales in recent quarters, said earlier this year that the company would continue to invest a lot into augmented reality. \nApple, the world's largest technology company, has ordered a small number of near-eye displays for testing but has not obtained enough for production on a larger scale, the report added. \nApple declined to comment. \nThe move would make Apple the latest tech company to venture into wearable glasses. \nAlphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) discontinued its own wearable glass headset, Google Glass, and closed the social media account linked to the device earlier this year, ending its attempt to popularize the expensive devices with consumers. \nThe device received plenty of attention when it was launched in 2012, but quickly ran into problems with its awkward appearance and privacy concerns over video recording. \nSnap, an $18 billion company which makes the popular messaging app Snapchat, also launched its own video-camera sunglasses last week. - Reuters",

      "text": "\nThe replacement of its I/O ports with USB Type-C with Thunderbolt 3 support is not going well at all with new MacBook Pro owners. This has led Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) to cut the price of the USB-C adapters that will be necessary to connect their peripherals to the new laptops.\nThe Thunderbolt 3/USB-C ports have a different connector than that of USB-A devices and cables, which includes the iPhone sync cable. So if you don’t have an adapter, you won’t be able to connect your iPhone or many of the other peripherals MacBook Pro users rely on. For some users, it will mean buying multiple adapters.\nIn a statement provided to The Loop , Apple said:\n“We recognize that many users, especially pros, rely on legacy connectors to get work done today and they face a transition. We want to help them move to the latest technology and peripherals, as well as accelerate the growth of this new ecosystem. Through the end of the year, we are reducing prices on all USB-C and Thunderbolt 3 peripherals we sell, as well as the prices on Apple’s USB-C adapters and cables.”\nDetails On the Apple Price Cuts on Adapters and Accessories The price cut is effective immediately on all of Apple’s USB-C adapters and some of its USB-C cables. The discount range is from $6 to $20 for the following items:\nMultiport adapter with HDMI, USB, and USB-C from $69 to $49 Multiport adapter with VGA, USB, and USB-C from $69 to $49 USB-C to traditional USB adapter from $19 to $9 USB-C to Lightning cable (1m or 3.2ft) from $25 to $19 USB-C to Lightning cable (2m or 6.5ft) from $35 to $29 SanDisk Extreme Pro SD UHS-II Card USB-C Reader from $49 to $29 Thunderbolt 3 to Thunderbolt 2 adapter from $49 to $29 Apple is also cutting the price of its new LG UltraFine 4K and 5K displays \nApple Connection Photo via Shutterstock \nThis article, \" Budget Conscious Business Users, Apple Announces Price Cuts On Adapters, Accessories \" was first published on Small Business Trends \n",

      "text": "| Topic: Apple \nGoogle Glass \nRemember Google Glass? Well, according to a Bloomberg report, Apple is planning its own take on Google's failed consumer product . \nCan Apple succeed where Google failed? What's Hot on ZDNet \nRight now, details on what Apple is planning to do are sketchy at best. The report can be summed up in a few bullet points: The product is claimed to be \"digital glasses\" The digital glasses would \"would connect wirelessly to iPhones, show images and other information in the wearer's field of vision, and may use augmented reality\" The product won't make an appearance until \"2018 at the earliest\" \nThe failure - at least consumer failure - of Google's Glass project will no doubt be at the forefront of Apple's mind (if it is indeed planning to venture into this arena). While it's difficult to pinpoint the exact cause for the demise of Google Glass, several issues spring to mind: High cost A perception that the device was a tool for \"tech elites\" Privacy issues concerning the camera Poor battery life Goofy design The problem of getting people to wear spectacles \nThese can be broken down into technical hurdles, and public relations obstacles. On top of thee issues, there are the problems associated with taking AR and making it a consumer-ready product, doubly so for Apple since it's not the sort of company to go and release a beta hardware product. \nAnd Apple is well aware of this. Only last month CEO Tim Cook said that augmented reality \"is going to take a while, because there are some really hard technology challenges there, but it will happen in a big way, and we will wonder when it does, how we ever lived without it.\" \nAnother factor is legislation. For example, it's almost certain to be illegal to drive while wearing any sort of AR smartglasses, so Apple is going to have to figure out how people can integrate the device into their daily lives while still remaining within the law. \nAny legislation around the product will also affect how useful and desirable others find the device. \nGiven that iPhone sales certainly seem to be softening, and that iPad sales are headed in a downward direction, Apple needs a new product. The question is, is smartglasses that product?",

      "text": "Reddit \nUnexpectedly, Apple debuted a new design book earlier today featuring over 20 years of Apple products, from the 1998 iMac to the 2015 Apple Pencil. Entitled ‘Designed by Apple in California’, the book is being exclusively published and sold by Apple, featuring over 450 photos. \nIn an exclusive interview with a Japanese design website , Jony Ive discusses the motivation behind making the book. He says the book highlights how ideas are unpredictable and the photos captures points in time of “incredible transitions and shocking change”. Ive says that designers live in the future and they are so consumed with what we haven’t done yet, the book is a rare celebration of past work. \nWatch the video below: \nThe video is subtitled in Japanese but Ive talks in English so the video is easily watchable. As well as the narration about the book, the video includes rare glimpses of Apple’s secretive design studio. It shows designers creating prototypes and models, with MacBooks on racks, cases being spray painted in a vacuum and much more. It’s unusual for Apple to include such a comprehensive look inside this room but it’s a fascinating glimpse into how Apple designs and develops its devices. \nIve describes the studio as a workshop where people come together to focus solely on making the things Apple makes. The video shows case colors being tested, iPhone chassis being milled and much more. The photo book goes on sale tomorrow in two sizes: small and large for $199 and $299.",

      "text": "You are using an outdated browser. Please upgrade your browser to improve your experience. Apple Announces 'Designed by Apple in California' Photo Book The book arrives on Wednesday, Nov. 26 by Bryan M. Wolfe November 15, 2016 \nOn Tuesday, Nov. 15, Apple announced a new hardbound book chronicling 20 years of design. “Designed by Apple in California” becomes available tomorrow, Nov. 16 at select locations and online. \nFeaturing 450 photographs of past and current Apple products, the book covers products from the 1998 iMac to the 2015 Apple Pencil. \nIn the book’s forward, Jony Ive, Apple’s chief design officer, notes: \nWhile this is a design book, it is not about the design team, the creative process, or product development. It is an objective representation of our work that, ironically, describes who we are. It describes how we work, our values, our preoccupations, and our goals. We have always hoped to be defined by what we do rather than by what we say. \nWe strive, with varying degrees of success, to define objects that appear effortless. Objects that appear so simple, coherent, and inevitable that there could be no rational alternative. \n“Designed by Apple in California” is available in small (10.20” x 12.75”) and large (13” x 16.25”) versions at $199 and $299, respectively. The book will be available through Apple.com in Australia, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, Korea, Taiwan, the United Kingdom, the United States, and select Apple Stores. \nThe follow Apple retail locations will stock the book: \nApple Regent Street and Apple Covent Garden in London; Apple Opera in Paris; Apple Kurfürstendamm in Berlin; Apple ifc mall and Apple Canton Road in Hong Kong; Apple Ginza in Tokyo; and Apple Sydney. \nIn the United States: Apple SoHo, Apple Fifth Avenue, Apple Upper East Side, Apple Williamsburg and Apple World Trade Center in New York; Apple The Grove in Los Angeles and Apple Third Street in Santa Monica; Apple North Michigan Avenue and Apple Lincoln Road in Chicago; Apple Northpark in Dallas; Apple Union Square in San Francisco; Apple Palo Alto and Apple Infinite Loop in Cupertino. \nThe book is dedicated to the memory of Steve Jobs.

      "text": "svenska TOMS Launches TOMS for Apple Watch Bands For every band purchased, TOMS will help provide one year of solar light to a person in need   09:00   Released today, TOMS has designed watch bands for Apple Watch inspired by founder Blake Mycoskie's friendship bracelets and which bring awareness to global light poverty. For every TOMS for Apple Watch band purchased, the company will help provide one year of solar light to an individual in need. About 1.2 billion people lack access to safe and reliable electricity, which negatively affects their income, health and well-being. TOMS for Apple Watch Utility Band TOMS for Apple Watch Artisan Band \"We love the idea of incorporating giving into a product you use on a daily basis.\" Mycoskie said, \"With our new TOMS for Apple Watch band, we will not only help provide light, but we will be positively impacting education, economic opportunity, health and safety for so many people who desperately need it.\" TOMS for Apple Watch bands are available in two different styles and several color ways. Pricing for bands range from $49 to $75 and are available at www.TOMS.com and TOMS retail stores across the U.S. The Utility Collection , a classic look designed for travel and adventure, features premium, durable grosgrain fabric strap and genuine leather detailing. Available in five colors. The Artisan Collection , inspired by TOMS Founder Blake Mycoskie's collection of friendship bracelets from around the world, features woven fabric and genuine leather backing. Available in three colors. All TOMS for Apple Watch bands feature a \"GIVE TIME\" etching and a gold \"TOMS\" emboss, as well as genuine leather and stainless steel details for a timeless finish. MAKING AN IMPACT ON LIGHT POVERTY WITH SOLAR LIGHT Solar light has an impact much further than just keeping the lights on longer. Solar light positively impacts: Education: Solar light allows for additional studying time after the sun goes down. Economic Opportunity: Families can save an average of 10% of their household income by using solar lights rather than paying for alternative light sources. Health: Solar light improves respiratory health by eliminating the need to burn kerosene or paraffin within the home. Safety: Solar light decreases the risk of fire and provides light for travel and necessary tasks. The Environment: Solar light reduces emissions of C02 gas. TOMS has partnered with two Giving Partners, Solar Sister and Solar Aid, organizations that have a mission to provide solar powered light to those who need it most. These partnerships are formed to ensure that individuals have access to safe, reliable light sources so that one more child will have the time to study into the night, one more person will have the time to work after dark and earn extra income, and one more family will stay healthy and safe. About TOMS: In 2006, American traveler Blake Mycoskie befriended children in a village in Argentina and found they had no shoes to protect their feet. Wanting to help, he created TOMS Shoes, a company that would match every pair of shoes purchased with a pair of new shoes given to a child in need. One for One™. To date, TOMS has given over one million pairs of new shoes to children through giving partners around the world. About Solar Sister: Solar Sister eradicates energy poverty by empowering women with economic opportunity. Solar Sister is creating a deliberately woman-centered direct sales network to bring the breakthrough potential of clean energy technology to even the most remote communities in rural Africa . About Solar Aid: SolarAid is an international charity that combats poverty and climate change. SolarAid is providing access to solar lights in some of the most remote regions of the world and building a movement to eradicate the kerosene lamp. SolarAid created the social enterprise, SunnyMoney, which sells solar powered lights via schools and social enterprises. Through establishing this market, SunnyMoney not only provides safe light sources, but creates a job market for these communities.",

      "text": "About a month back, Apple officially added Search Ads to its App Store. The move was designed to give developers a simple way to show off their apps to potential users.\nHow are developers responding?\nWell, since the beginning of October, they have nearly doubled their investment in Search Ads, according to fresh findings from mobile analytics and attribution firm AppsFlyer.\nHow are the ads performing? On average, the Search Ads are generating six in-app actions per install, which is the fourth-highest ratio among top media sources.\nAlso of note, 72% of search queries that resulted in an install were not based on the actual name of the app, AppsFlyer finds.\nBigger picture, “Apple is seeking to emulate the success of [Google] that built an empire from one concept: the value of search intent,” notes Shani Rosenfelder, a content marketing lead at AppsFlyer.\nThe effort comes as Apple’s hardware business continues to decline. Year-over-year, in fact, iPhone sales have declined by about 13% to 45.5 million units.\nIncreasing demand for Search Ads, the App Store is expected to expand dramatically over the next few years.\nIndeed, based on data stretching back to the App Store’s debut in 2008, the active app catalogue in the store will increase by 73% from the end of 2016 -- reaching a total of 5 million apps -- according to recent findings from Sensor Tower.",

      "text": "  Designed by Apple in California, a Photographic History of Apple Design to Be Released November 16th By John Voorhees \nIn a press release, Apple announced the release of a hardbound book, Designed by Apple in California , documenting twenty years of Apple design work. The book is dedicated to the memory of Steve Jobs. According to Jony Ive : \n“The idea of genuinely trying to make something great for humanity was Steve’s motivation from the beginning, and it remains both our ideal and our goal as Apple looks to the future,” said Jony Ive, Apple’s chief design officer. “This archive is intended to be a gentle gathering of many of the products the team has designed over the years. We hope it brings some understanding to how and why they exist, while serving as a resource for students of all design disciplines.” \nDesigned by Apple in California includes 450 beautiful photographs of Apple products past and present by photographer Andrew Zuckerman and will go on sale at Apple.com and select Apple Stores on November 16, 2016. Apple’s press release provides further detail on the production of Designed by Apple in California : \n\"Designed by Apple in California\" is available in two sizes and printed on specially milled, custom-dyed paper with gilded matte silver edges, using eight color separations and low-ghost ink. This linen-bound, hardcover volume was developed over an eight-year period. \nThe smaller version of the book (10.20” x 12.75”) will cost $199 and the larger version (13” x 16.25”) $299. \nThe price is steep, but the photographs are undeniably gorgeous. Here’s a selection of photos shared by Apple.  ",

      "text": "A Chinese state-run newspaper has warned that companies such as Apple ( AAPL ) and Boeing ( BA ) would be the first to be punished if President-elect Donald Trump follows through on campaign pledges to brand China a currency manipulator.\nDuring his election campaign, Trump also spoke of a 45% import tariff on all Chinese goods.\nThe communist-party controlled newspaper, Global Times, is not as well known as China's People's Daily or Xinhua News.\n\"If Trump wrecks Sino-U.S. trade, a number of U.S. industries will be impaired,\" the newspaper said in an unsigned editorial. \"A batch of Boeing orders will be replaced by Airbus. U.S. auto and iPhone sales in China will suffer a setback, and U.S. soybean and maize imports will be halted. China can also limit the number of Chinese students studying in the U.S.\"\nIBD'S TAKE: Apple and the so-called FANG internet giants — Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google-parent Alphabet — have not joined in the postelection stock rally, while bank, drug, defense and basic material stocks have gained. See how some are doing at IBD Stock Checkup .\nBoeing recently received a $3.2 billion order for twelve 787 Dreamliners from China Southern Airlines. Amid tougher competition from local smartphone makers, Apple's revenue from China, Hong Kong and Taiwan fell 30% in fiscal Q4 to $8.8 billion.\nThe Global Times editorial was published shortly after Trump spoke with Chinese President Xi Jinping by telephone on Monday.\nXi told Trump that cooperation was the only correct choice for ties between the world's two largest economies, said a Bloomberg report.\nXi and Trump agreed to meet soon, according to state broadcaster China Central TV.\n\"China and the U.S. -- as the world's biggest developing country and the biggest developed country, and the top two global economies — need to and can cooperate on many issues,\" Xi said, according to CCTV. \"At this moment, there is an important opportunity and massive potential for China-U.S. cooperation so that both sides need to strengthen coordination.\"\nAlibaba ( BABA ) Vice Chairman Joe Tsai last week said Trump would run a risk by harming China relations, the Wall Street Journal reported.\n\"China is going to be and already is the source of consumer demand and the source of capital for America,\" Tsai reportedly said at an event to kick off the company's big Singles Day event on Friday. \"So if you're the American president, you have to pay a lot of attention to that because your job is to create a lot of jobs in American society.\n\"And if you don't have Chinese consumers being engaged and buying American products, and Chinese investors can't invest in the United States, and create more American jobs, then you'd be in trouble.\"\nApple shares closed down 2.5% in the stock market today , though they did find support at their 200-day line intraday. Boeing stock, though, climbed 1% to 149.99.",

      "text": "If President-elect Donald Trump pressures Apple ( AAPL ) to manufacture more iPhones in the U.S., the move would backfire because of higher costs, says an analyst.\nApple's iPhone is manufactured in China by Taiwan-headquartered Foxconn and Pegatron. Brian White, analyst at Drexel Hamilton, says shifting iPhone production to the U.S. is \"unrealistic.\"\n\"Many consumers would no longer be able to afford to buy an iPhone due to higher manufacturing costs,\" said White in a research report. \"Moreover, we believe finding the workers with the willingness and skill set to assemble an iPhone in the U.S. at the volume levels required by Apple would be an insurmountable task. In China, workers generally are young, live in a dorm on the manufacturing campus and work very long hours.\n\"Even if the assembly of an iPhone occurred in the U.S., many of the components necessary to manufacture an iPhone are produced in China or elsewhere in Asia, thus shipment into the U.S. would prove costly.\"\nApple stock fell on Monday after a Chinese state-controlled newspaper warned that the iPhone maker could be punished if President-elect Trump starts a trade war with China. Apple shares ended the trading session down 2.5%, to 105.71, at the close on the stock market today .",

Credit: HP Use commas to separate multiple email addresses From Your message has been sent. Sorry IDG News Service | Nov 15, 2016 RELATED TOPICS Comments \nHP has been hoping that sleek, powerful hardware will lure Apple Mac aficionados to switch to its PCs, and now is aiming the new Z2 Mini mini-desktop at Mac Mini users. \nThe Z2 Mini packs the computing power of a full-size desktop into a box that can be held in one hand. Starting at $699, it will be available worldwide starting in December. [ iPad Pro vs. Surface Pro vs. Pixel C vs. Galaxy TabPro S : The \"tabtop\" tablet/laptop hybrids compared. | Get deep into Windows: Subscribe to the InfoWorld Windows Report newsletter . ] \nHP has been excelling in PC design, with innovative desktops like Pavilion Wave , a cylindrical desktop, and Elite Slice , a modular mini-desktop onto which components can be snapped. \nThe 2.4-kilogram Z2 Mini can cram an Intel server CPU and discrete Nvidia GPU—both of which have their own cooling fans—into a tiny space while delivering screaming performance. \nThe Z2 Mini could be an alternative for those looking to replace the aging Mac Mini, which hasn’t received a design or hardware upgrade for years now. \nApple has been abandoning the professional market and for engineers and designers, the Z2 Mini is superior to the Mac Mini, said Jeff Wood, vice president of HP’s workstation business, during a briefing. \nThe idea that Apple is stepping away from the professional market was highlighted during the recent release of the MacBook Pro , which has innovative features like the Touch Bar. But it attracted criticism for using old Intel Skylake chips, and was widely considered more of a consumer than a business PC. \nApple also hasn’t upgraded its Mac Pro desktop since 2013, and workstations with Windows are filling that void. The new Windows workstations have superior processors, GPUs, memory and SSD storage. \nThe Z2 Mini is targeted at engineers and architects using applications like Autodesk or Solidworks. However, it isn’t meant for use with VR headsets like Oculus Rift or HTC Vive, an HP spokesperson said. Nvidia’s Quadro M620 GPU isn’t designed for VR, and headsets typically need full-powered desktops like the Z840 with cutting-edge GPUs. \nThe Z2 mini-desktop can be configured with Intel’s Xeon E3-1200v5 CPU, or Core chips. It supports up to 32GB of memory and up to 1.5TB of storage. \nAn entry-level model will have three DisplayPort ports, two USB 3.0 ports and an ethernet port. A fully loaded model will have two additional USB Type-C ports. \nBut some features are missing. It doesn’t have an HDMI port to attach displays, or a Thunderbolt 3 slot to attach high-speed storage. Workstation users dealing with high-end graphics need more than 1.5TB of storage, and the USB 3.0 port, with its data transfer speed of 10Gbps (bits per second), may not be enough. Storage devices attached to a Thunderbolt 3 port—which transfers data at 40Gbps—can be used in real time, much like internal storage. \nThe Z2 can be mounted behind a monitor so it remains hidden.

      "text": "Reddit According to a new report from Australian publication The Age , Apple is eyeing Federation Square in Melbourne for the location of a new flagship retail store in the country. The report notes that Apple is in negotiations to demolish a current structure in the square described as a “deconstructivist metal building” (pictured above, right). The company plans to replace it with something more Apple-like that will include an all glass facade. That, however, might be a controversial move for some, according to the report, particularly the architecture community as the unique building Apple plans to tear down is somewhat of a landmark and matches the design of adjacent buildings: Apple has been in lengthy and secretive negotiations with Federation Square’s management and the state government to take over and demolish the Yarra building in the square… Demolishing one of the existing buildings, originally designed by LAB Architecture Studio, is also likely to upset Melbourne’s close-knit architecture community. The Age adds that the location of the square is a popular gathering place in the community with a “giant screen which can beam live events to thousands of watchers” a big draw for tenants. Here’s a photo: A new store in Federation Square would be the company’s fourth in Melbourne, but would be its first standalone flagship store. Other stores are located in mall locations, such as the current Chadstone Shopping Centre location and others in Doncaster and Southland. Apple already has twenty two retail locations in total throughout the country.",

      "title": "Why Samsung's Harman purchase will be seen as Apple blunder decades from now",
      "text": "ZDNet Japan Why Samsung's Harman purchase will be seen as Apple blunder decades from now Samsung's $8 billion purchase of Harman may be pricey, but how often can you become a Tier 1 auto supplier in one swoop. Apple could have made a similar play. \nSamsung's purchase of Harman is strategically sound, worth the $8 billion and positions it well in the connected car market. Meanwhile, Samsung diversifies from a saturated smartphone market. \nThe deal makes so much sense you have to wonder why Apple didn't buy Harman. \nThere has been an argument floated for months if not years that Apple should use some of its cash to acquire Harman. The crux of the case, outlined by Jim Cramer repeatedly , is that Apple could diversify and become the hub of the connected car by purchasing Harman. \nNot surprisingly, Samsung basically took the same argument Apple would use for purchasing Harman and adopted it. Samsung will immediately gain a significant share of automotive electronics. Connected car hardware and software represented 65 percent of Harman's $7 billion in annual sales. Samsung can vertically integrate its processors and displays with Harman. The bridges from the connected car to smart homes and cities aren't fully formed, but inevitable. Samsung's B2B unit is likely to get a boost with Harman for stadium, concert and performance facilities via new implementations. The Internet of things market is a key area where Samsung can leverage the convergence of hardware software and data. \nAdd it up and Samsung's purchase of Harman makes a ton of sense. And I'm usually a glass half empty type when it comes to big acquisitions. \nWhat this tells me about the strategic landscape in the connected everything market. Google has Android Auto and plenty of connected car ventures, but the reality is that it's distracted with science projects like self-driving vehicles. Apple has had issues with its own car dreams, but let's face it: The company is largely following Google. Apple's iOS will play a role in the vehicle, but it won't be a native experience. Apple's car fortunes will go as the iPhone does. Richard Windsor, Edison Investment Research analyst, said: Apple's realignment of its automotive experiment is a strong indication of how it is not a good idea for a tech company to start making cars and we do not think that Samsung ever had any intention of following Apple down this road. Most importantly, Samsung does not represent the same threat to automotive brands that Apple and Google do, as it long ago gave up trying to compete in the ecosystem. BlackBerry's QNX is likely winner here. QNX serves as the middleware to a lot of connected car efforts-- see Ford Sync for instance . QNX's role as a neutral and secure platform in the vehicle will play well with Samsung/Harman. Microsoft's platform play revolves around Azure and partnering with key players . Sure Samsung and Microsoft may make strange bedfellows in some areas, but overall will remain good partners. \nWhat's telling in all of Samsung's comments and slides about the Harman purchase is that you could easily do a global search and replace with the word \"Apple\" and the strategy makes sense. Assuming Samsung doesn't completely botch the Harman purchase, Apple may regret not beating its rival to the punch. Join Discussion",

      "text": "Youtube ‘Designed by Apple in California’ book with 450 Apple product images released for $299 \nThe Cupertino giant Apple announced the launch of the hardbound book chronicling 20 years of Apple’s design through 450 photographs of Apple products, dubbed as ‘Design by Apple in California’. This book covers products starting from 1998’s Mac to 2015 Apple’s Pencil. \nFurther, this book also features the materials and techniques used by the Apple team over past years. Moreover, this book is dedicated to the memory of late Steve Jobs. The images in the book are shot by Andrew Zuckerman in a deliberately spare style. \nThe ‘Designed by Apple in California’ will be available from tomorrow exclusively in Apple.com, in selected countries Australia, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, Korea, Taiwan, the UK and the US. It comes in two sizes – Small and large, at a price of $199 (approx. Rs. 13,500) and $299 (approx. Rs. 20,270). \nJony Ive, Apple’s chief design officer, said: \nThe idea of genuinely trying to make something great for humanity was Steve’s motivation from the beginning, and it remains both our ideal and our goal as Apple looks to the future. This archive is intended to be a gentle gathering of many of the products the team has designed over the years. We hope it brings some understanding to how and why they exist, while serving as a resource for students of all design disciplines. \nIn the book’s foreword, Ive explains: \nWhile this is a design book, it is not about the design team, the creative process or product development. It is an objective representation of our work that, ironically, describes who we are. It describes how we work, our values, our preoccupations and our goals. We have always hoped to be defined by what we do rather than by what we say. \nWe strive, with varying degrees of success, to define objects that appear effortless. Objects that appear so simple, coherent and inevitable that there could be no rational alternative.",

      "text": "Jony Ive Talks about ‘Designed by Apple in California’ Book in New Interview; Gives a Sneak Peek into Design Studio Posted by Rajesh Pandey   \nFeaturing in an interview with a Japanese website, Apple’s design guru Jony Ive talks about the Cupertino company’s ‘Designed by Apple in California’ book and the design studio. In the accompanying video, Apple gives glimpses of its design studio and some of the photos that are a part of its new design book. \nIve refers to the studio as a “workshop” in the video where the team designs 3D objects and make “lots and lots of models and prototypes.” The video gives us a glimpse at a bunch of MacBook and iPhone prototypes that never made it to the manufacturing line. It also shows Apple’s designers in action relentllessly working to perfect their design. \nIn the interview, Ive reveals that the idea behind the book was his, with everyone supporting it. However, the team decided that they did not want to release an archive of their past work. The design guru reveals in the interview that there is no particular product that he has worked on at Apple over the last two decades that was a turning point in Apple’s design. Instead, he says that every product that Apple has launched has played a special role, right from the original iMac that launched in the 90s and saved Apple. \nThe whole interview is in Japanese so you will need to use Google Translate to read it in English. While the translation will be broken, it should still be good enough for you to understand what Ive is saying.",

      "text": "Apple on Monday released yet another new beta version of its upcoming iOS software release. iOS 10.2 beta 3 fixes a number of bugs and irons out some wrinkles as well, and it even adds a new feature here and there. In fact, there's even yet another new screen effect available in the Messages app; stickers might already have become boring to many users, but bubble effects and screen effects have managed to escape going out of style thus far. Yes, there are plenty of nifty new features and updates in iOS 10.2 beta 3, but you can't have it yet. Why? Because iOS 10.2 hasn't yet been released to the public. In fact, it hasn't even been released to beta testers yet at this point. Of course, that won't stop hardcore Apple fans from installing the new beta software on their iPhones and iPads, even if they don't have the \"required\" developer account. In this post, we'll tell you everything you need to know to get iOS 10.2 beta 3 installed on your device right now.\n\n(more…) Trending right now: \nBest Buy Black Friday 2016 ad: iPhone 7, PS4 Pro bundle, TVs, and other huge deals Best Buy just released a brand new Black Friday ad: Here’s what changed Best Buy’s Black Friday sale includes a killer deal no other store else has ",

      "text": "Apple’s iOS 10.2 beta 3 brings a unique India-only SOS feature, which will alert authorities when the power button is clicked five times Apple has rolled out iOS 10.2 beta 3 developer version for iPhone, iPad and this update removes an earlier SOS-feature. According to MacRumors, Apple’s release notes say the SOS-feature is going to be India-only and it looks the company was just testing it for now. For those who remember, the Indian government has proposed that all smartphones should have an SOS-function via a separate button or software feature.\nAccording to reports, Apple’s SOS-feature will allow for emergency services to be contacted when the power button is pressed more than five times. The functionality is now India-only in the developer beta, according to MacRumors. So developers in India should be able to check out this feature if they are on the latest beta build.\nOther updates being added in the 10.2 beta 3 for developers includes new Unicode 9.0 emojis, new TV app, new wallpapers (but only for iPhone 7 series) and new camera settings. The other big change with the 10.2 upgrade is it replaces Videos app with Apple TV app in the US. The TV app has been redesigned to make it simpler and the Settings menu has undergone a few changes.\nApple’s iOS 10.2 beta 3 brings support for Unicode 9.0 emojis, which include selfie, facepalm, shrug, pregnant woman, mother and son emoji; a father with two kids emoji, rainbow flag and more. There are gender diverse emojis such as woman detective, athlete, weight lifter, swimmer, surfer and more. Other interesting emojis include ROFL (rolling on the floor laughing), drooling face, clown face and lying face.\nApple is introducing its Single Sign-On feature with iOS 10.2 Beta 3. The Single Sign-On feature is available in a new TV provider tab and can be used for watching live TV via apps. There’s a new Celebrate screen effect called ‘Send With Love’ for Messages that creates a big red heart in the background.\nAlso read: Apple iOS 10: Tips and tricks you need to know about\nIt is interesting to see Apple prepare for the India market with an SOS feature. Apple CEO Tim Cook has already said he sees great potential and future for the company in the Indian market, and the company has seen iPhone sales pick up, although it is not yet in the top five vendors in terms of volume.\nThe SOS-button on smartphones could soon be mandatory if one goes by the government stance, and looks like Apple will be prepared for that once it comes into effect.\n© The Indian Express Online Media Pvt Ltd",

      "text": "a beautifully simple password manager, now Free on the App Store Jony Ive Discusses Apple’s Design Process and New Book By John Voorhees \nEarlier today, Apple announced Designed by Apple in California , a coffee table book featuring photography of its products and design process that goes on sale tomorrow. In connection with announcement, Jony Ive was interviewed by Japanese design website Casa Brutus . Ive describes the motivation behind the creation of Designed by Apple in California , but also has a lot to say about Apple's design process. My favorite part is at the beginning of the video where Ive describes how his team nurtures ideas: \nOne of the things that we've learned is the importance of listening. Because as we all know, the very best ideas can very often come from the quietest voice. Ideas are extremely fragile. Ideas are not predictable in terms of when you'll have them and how many you are going to have. And so over the years, we've really created at team and an environment that I think really increases the probability of good ideas and when they actually arrive I think nurtures them. \nAs Ive speaks, the video shows designers at work in Apple's studio creating prototypes of Macs, iPhones, and other items. If you are interested in design or the creative process in general, this is a must-watch video. Join Now Like MacStories?

      "text": "Toms has teamed up with Apple Watch on a collection of fabric wrist straps. The collaboration includes two lines: the Utility Collection offers a grosgrain fabric strap and comes in five colors, while the woven Artisan Collection, inspired by Toms founder, Blake Mycoskie’s own collection of friendship bracelets, comes in three different color choices.\nAnd as with all its endeavors — for each pair of Toms sold, the brand gives a pair of new shoes to a child in need — there’s a charitable cause involved. Related 5 Things to Know About the Apple Watch Series 2 Nike+ \nFor every wrist strap that is purchased, the ethically minded shoe label has pledged to provide one year of solar light to a person in need.\nToms for Apple Watch. Courtesy of brand. To this end, it has partnered with charitable organizations Solar Sister and Solar Aid, which provide solar powered light to those who need it most.  According to statistics from the International Energy Agency, about 1.2 billion people lack access to safe and reliable electricity, which negatively impacts on their income, health and potential.\n“We love the idea of incorporating the act of giving into a product you use on a daily basis, ” said Mycoskie. “With our new Toms for Apple Watch straps, we will not only help provide light, but we will be positively impacting education, economic opportunity, health and safety for so many people who desperately need it.” \nToms for Apple Watch. Courtesy of brand. As of Nov. 15, the Toms for Apple Watch collection is available online at Toms and at the brand’s retail stores in London and Amsterdam. Prices range from $50 to $80.\n ",

      "text": "print \nNintendo and Apple shocked the world earlier this year by announcing \"Super Mario Run,\" the legendary gaming company's first foray into mobile gaming. It's a Mario game you can play on your phone with just one hand, so what's not to love? \nThankfully, now we know when you can get it and for how much: \"Super Mario Run\" will launch on iPhone and iPad on December 15, for a flat fee of $9.99. You can play a sample of the game modes for free, but unlike most other mobile games that let you download for free but require money to keep playing, or access parts of the game, you can pay $10 to get everything right away. \nNintendo/Apple \nIn case you haven't heard, \"Super Mario Run\" is essentially a regular, side-scrolling \"Super Mario\" game with one key difference: You don't control Mario's movement. He runs automatically and all you do is tap the screen to jump. \nThe name and basic idea might sound like one of those endless score attack games like \"Temple Run,\" but that's not the case. \"Super Mario Run\" is divided into hand-crafted levels with a clear end-point like any other Mario game, meaning you're essentially getting the Mario experience for $10 without needing to control his movement. \n$10 might seem like a bit much compared to the $0 people pay for most mobile games, but it's possible the game has $10 worth of levels to play in it. It's also not iPhone exclusive, but the Android version will launch at a later, currently unknown date. \nTo see \"Super Mario Run\" in action, check out the footage below: EXCLUSIVE FREE REPORT: ",

      "text": "By Tiernan Ray Here are some things going on today in your world of tech: \nShares of major techs are bouncing back after days of selling following the upset victory of Donald Trump in the U.S. presidential election. Shares of Apple ( AAPL ) are up 72 cents, or 0.6%, at $106.43, shares of Alphabet ( GOOGL ) are up $14.29, or 2%, at $767.51, shares of Amazon ( AMZN ) are up $9.30, or 1.3%, at $728.37, shares of Netflix ( NFLX ) are up $1.33, or 1%, at $114.71, and shares of Facebook ( FB ) are up $1.47, or 1.2%, at $116.55.\nSpeaking of Apple, Bloomberg ’s Mark Gurman , Alex Webb , and Ian King wrote late yesterday that Apple is in “early product testing” for “ digital glasses ,” which would take an “augmented reality” approach to displaying images and information in front of the user’s gaze, similar to Alphabet’s Google’s failed “ Google Glass. ” The authors, citing multiple unnamed sources, write that the device is “still in an exploration phase,” with any possible delivery of actual product not expected before 2018.\nIn data, Internet sales, as encapsulated by “non-store sales,” were up 1.9% in October, according to the Census Bureau, after a 0.9% gain in September. More data at the Bureau’s data Web site .\nShares of cyber security technology vendor Fortinet ( FTNT ) are up 76 cents, or 2.4%, at $32.40, after Morgan Stanley ’s Melissa Gorham raised her rating on the shares to Overweight from Equal Weight, with a $39 price target, citing, among other things, “easier comps” for the company’s financials. \nShares of Nokia ( NOK ) are down 23 cents, or 5.5%, at $4.08, after the company this morning held its analyst day meeting and said its traditional “Networks” business with see sales decline “in line with its primary addressable market” in 2017. The company also announced a €1 billion share repurchase program, to be completed by the end of next year. That follows €560 million spent this year to by Alcatel-Lucent . More from CFO Timo Ihamuotila in a deck of slides on the company’s IR Web site .\nShares of Twitter ( TWTR ) are down a penny, at $19.13, even though noted fund manager Bill Miller told CNBC this morning he likes the name.\nShares of Nvidia ( NVDA ) are up $1.01, or 1%, at $84.65, after it announced this morning a deal with Microsoft (MSFT) for artificial intelligence applications in cloud computing. Nvidia says Microsoft’s Azure cloud computing platform will run the “first purpose-built enterprise AI framework” designed for Nvidia’s “ Tesla ” chips.\nShares of Zebra Technologies ( ZBRA ), which makes technology for traditional barcode scanning but also for the Internet of Things , are up $3.13, or 5%, at $69.94, after the company this morning reported revenue of $904 million, missing the consensus $907.4 million, but beat on the bottom line with $1.43 against $1.41 expected, and forecast this quarter’s profit above consensus despite a lower revenue outlook.\nZebra also said it appointed former Western Digital ( WDC ) CFO Olivier Leonetti its new CFO, replacing Michael Smiley , which may suggest to some investors the prospect of heightened capital returns to shareholders.",

It's a hardcover edition, bound in linen, and is available in two sizes: $199 for a smaller 10.20\" x 12.75\" version, and $299 for a larger 13\" x 16.25\" edition. The book is simply titled Designed by Apple in California — a name that somehow manages to be both humble and incredibly pretentious at the same time. \nThe photos inside are all new images shot by Andrew Zuckerman, and will show off 20 years of Apple design \"in a deliberately spare style.\" In a press statement, chief designer Jony Ive described the book as \"a gentle gathering of many of the products the team has designed over the years,\" and hoped that it would serve as a \"resource for students of all design disciplines.\" \n<img class=\"inlineChart\" src=\"http://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/editorialfiles/charts/2016/11/1479218547_apple_book_1.jpg\"></img>\n<em>Apple</em> \n<div id=\"inline_movable_ad\"></div> <img class=\"inlineChart\" src=\"http://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/editorialfiles/charts/2016/11/1479218592_apple_book_2.jpg\"></img>\n<em>Apple</em>\n\n<strong>More from The Verge: \n<a class=\"inline_asset\" href=\"http://www.theverge.com/2016/11/15/13635788/apple-coffee-table-book-products-images\" title=\"http://www.theverge.com/2016/11/15/13635788/apple-coffee-table-book-products-images\" target=\"_blank\">Macbook Pro with touch bar review: A touch of the future</a>\n<a class=\"inline_asset\" href=\"http://www.theverge.com/2016/11/14/13621116/microsoft-visual-studio-coming-to-mac\" title=\"http://www.theverge.com/2016/11/14/13621116/microsoft-visual-studio-coming-to-mac\" target=\"_blank\">Microsoft is bringing Visual Studio to the Mac</a>\n</strong><a class=\"inline_asset\" href=\"http://www.theverge.com/2016/11/14/13618714/google-play-music-new-app-update-playlists\" title=\"http://www.theverge.com/2016/11/14/13618714/google-play-music-new-app-update-playlists\" target=\"_blank\">Google Play Music gets a total overhaul</a> \nIn the foreword to the book, Ive writes:\n\n<blockquote> While this is a design book, it is not about the design team, the creative process, or product development. It is an objective representation of our work that, ironically, describes who we are. It describes how we work, our values, our preoccupations, and our goals. We have always hoped to be defined by what we do rather than by what we say. \nWe strive, with varying degrees of success, to define objects that appear effortless. Objects that appear so simple, coherent, and inevitable that there could be no rational alternative. \n</blockquote> </div> </div> <div class=\"group-container last\"> <div class=\"group\" itemprop=\"articleBody\"> The book is published by Apple itself, and is dedicated to the memory of Steve Jobs. It is, undeniably, an act of corporate vanity publishing on an impressive scale, but it's one Apple deserves to get away with more than pretty much any other tech company. No one denies that when it comes to industrial design, Apple earns the praise it gets.\nThat aside, though, the book's publication does show a certain amount of self-interest, navel-gazing, and even arrogance from Apple — themes that were also present in September's unveiling of the new MacBook Pros. It's all very well to feel proud of the successes of the past, but we'll be interested to see if the company can justify releasing another such book 20 years from now. \n<img class=\"inlineChart\" src=\"http://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/editorialfiles/charts/2016/11/1479218619_apple_book_3.jpg\"></img>\n<em>Apple</em>\n</div> </div> </div> </div> </article> <div>",

      "text": "MORE Posted 17 minutes ago by iClarified · 628 views · Translate Apple today announced the release of a new hardbound book chronicling 20 years of Apple’s design, expressed through 450 photographs of past and current Apple products. \"Designed by Apple in California,\" which covers products from 1998’s iMac to 2015’s Apple Pencil, also documents the materials and techniques used by Apple’s design team over two decades of innovation. The book is dedicated to the memory of Steve Jobs.“The idea of genuinely trying to make something great for humanity was Steve’s motivation from the beginning, and it remains both our ideal and our goal as Apple looks to the future,” said Jony Ive, Apple’s chief design officer. “This archive is intended to be a gentle gathering of many of the products the team has designed over the years. We hope it brings some understanding to how and why they exist, while serving as a resource for students of all design disciplines.”The products in this book are the result of a profoundly close collaboration between many different groups. Shot by photographer Andrew Zuckerman in a deliberately spare style, the book’s 450 images illustrate Apple’s design process as well as its finished products.In the book’s foreword, Ive explains: While this is a design book, it is not about the design team, the creative process, or product development. It is an objective representation of our work that, ironically, describes who we are. It describes how we work, our values, our preoccupations, and our goals.

      "text": "I participated Monday morning on a panel at an investment-banking conference in San Francisco to discuss the future of Apple . Naturally, the conversation turned to Donald Trump.\nSpecifically, the panelists--the astute researcher Horace Dediu, the journalist Mark Gurman, and Steve Milunovich, the veteran UBS analyst and host of the session--briefly batted about the question of how a U.S. trade war with China might further blunt Apple's already challenged business in that important country.\nFirst, a step back. With notable exceptions, Silicon Valley was uniformly against Trump, both for his anti-immigrant bellicosity and his anti-elitist posture. The (highly skilled) immigrant-heavy tech industry is nothing if not a bastion of elitism, and it has enjoyed a warm relationship with President Obama. (Farhad Manjoo of The New York Times nicely captures the vibe here . Also, for the record, I am no fan of #Calexit. I love my country.)\nA Trump presidency's economic impact won't be all bad for tech companies, including Apple aapl . Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi published a report Monday that suggests Apple would be one of the biggest beneficiaries of a Trump proposal to lower corporate taxes and allow a one-time repatriation of cash held outside the U.S. Apple pays among the highest tax rates and has the highest foreign reserves of any tech company.\nGet Data Sheet , Fortune's technology newsletter, where this essay originated. \nThat's where the good news ends. The president-elect mouthed electorate-soothing words about forcing Apple and others to move production \"back\" to the U.S. That won't happen to any substantial degree in any reasonable timeframe. Once it discovers that fact of life, the new administration may then try to slap tariffs on goods produced in China. That, in turn, could unleash a domino effect of higher smartphone prices and Chinese retaliation. Economic chaos would ensue. As I noted on the panel, the Chinese government wouldn't think twice about Apple becoming collateral damage in a U.S.-China trade war. And Apple won’t be the only target . (Apple shares have slipped 5% since the election last Tuesday.)\nIt is early days in terms of translating the results of an election into policy that will determine the world's economic future. We are unlikely to be talking about much else for months and years to come.",

      "text": "Nov 15, 2016 9:45am Image: Niels Epting/Flickr \nApple is reportedly considering developing digital eyewear that would connect wirelessly to the iPhone and may use augmented reality. \nThe gadget would present web-based information and images in the wearer’s field of vision, according to a Bloomberg report , similar to other augmented reality eyewear. Apple has discussed the matter with potential suppliers, but the device is still in the exploration phase. The company has ordered “small quantities of near-eye displays” for testing, but any potential device isn’t likely to come to market before 2018. \nThe device would be Apple’s first hardware offering in the augmented reality market, although Bloomberg rightly warned that the company tests a variety of products and services that never make it to market. Predictably, Apple declined to comment on the report. \nBut the news underscores Apple’s ongoing struggle to produce a compelling new product in the post-Steve Jobs era. The company hasn’t had a major new product introduction since the initial iPad launched in 2010, and Apple has also faced challenges in differentiating its iPhone in an increasingly competitive smartphone market. \nRELATED: Apple shows declines in revenues, profits and iPhones sales - and predicts more of the same this year \nApple last month issued somewhat lackluster expectations for the holiday shopping quarter, leading investors to send the company’s stock down by almost $3 per share . And in its latest quarterly report, Apple showed a slight decline in iPhone shipments when compared with its performance during the same quarter a year ago: It sold 45.5 million iPhone handsets versus 48 million last year. \nGrowth in the worldwide smartphone market has slowed over the last year, and vendors are increasingly looking to virtual reality to give their high-end handsets an edge. Samsung made its Gear VR a focal point when it introduced the Galaxy S7 earlier this year, for instance, and Google last month announced its Daydream View headset and controller alongside the introduction of its new Pixel phone. \nAugmented reality, of course, is different than virtual reality because it overlays web-based content onto a real-world field of vision rather than enclosing a user in a virtual world. Indeed, AR may face more difficult challenges in the market both in terms of technology and user behavior – as Google seemed to experience with its Google Glass, a high-profile venture into high-tech eyewear that failed to catch on beyond developers and the earliest of adopters. \nRELATED: Lenovo launches first phone to support Google's Tango AR \nGoogle Glass was a consumer-focused project that may have been too ambitious for its own good. Analysts see ample opportunities in the enterprise market for augmented reality, and AR technology will continue to improve along with virtual reality. If Apple can eventually find ways to create a valuable, compelling user experience through AR – and do so at an acceptable cost – it could bring a powerful new weapon to the smartphone wars.

      "title": "8 Wireless Earbuds That Are Way Better Than Apple’s Airpods",
      "text": "Maxwell Barna gives us a rundown of the best wireless earbuds that aren’t from Apple. \nThe missing 3.5mm headphone jack has been one of the largest items on a laundry list of controversy plaguing Apple’s new iPhone 7. The public scoffed at Apple’s attempt to reconcile the issue, which came in the form of lightning port-based headphones that prohibit users from charging and listening to music at the same time.\nAnd that ridicule multiplied following Apple’s announcement of its new AirPods, which essentially look like regular Apple earbuds with the cords cut off.\nPeople immediately jumped on them for looking basic, and memes referencing the ease of losing them and/or likening them to tampon strings falling out of users’ ears flooded the internet. Needless to say, it was all pretty brutal.\nWhile the AirPods offer some admittedly cool features, including the ability to trigger Siri by tapping a bud, and automatically pausing audio when a bud is removed from an ear, the fact is that a lot of people aren’t too excited about paying $159 for something so… awful.\nWhile the world waits for the AirPods’ arrival (some reports suggest next week, others January 2017), I decided to see what alternatives were out there in the best wireless earbuds race. Turns out, there’s a lot of cool shit on the market:\nIt’s a little too early to call it, but the Airs by Crazybaby not only look better than the AirPods, but also serve a lot of the same purposes. Automatic Bluetooth pairing, tap-to-play technology, the CSR HD audiochip for improved sound quality, and even voice assistance.\nOh, and as if all that wasn’t enough, the Crazybaby Air only starts at $89: almost half the price of the AirPods.\nBuy Here Another excellent AirPods alternative, the Muse5 from Erato focuses heavily on sound quality with its use of DSP technology, while also providing premium in-ear comfort and ease of use.\nThe Muse5 comes with Silicon FitSeal Sleeves that help guarantee an excellent fit and superior sound quality. They’re a little spendier than the AirPods, but only by a bit—regular retail on them is $179.99, but the pre-order price (which is still available) is $129.99.\nNot bad for a truly wireless Bluetooth earbud setup that allows mobile charging, is waterproof, and even includes a built-in microphone to work with Siri or do things like power on/off, adjust volume, play/pause, etc.\nBuy Here One of the pricier options on this list, the VerveOnes+ by Motorola are an absolute killer set of wireless headphones.\nNot only are they waterproof—unlike the AirPods—but also smart enough to turn on when you insert them into your ears, turn off when you take them out, and also offer easy ways to take calls and interact with Siri (or Google Now).\nBuy Here Engadget The EARIN M-1s don’t offer any cool motion features or anything fun like that, but if you’re an audiophile, these are probably going to be your best bet.\nThey’re billed as the smallest and lightest true wireless earbuds on the planet and their sound quality is about as good as you’re going to get from any pair. They work with two dedicated amps in order to create punchy sound that features excellent mids and highs, and tight, punchy bass.\nThey cost a little more than the AirPods, but if it’s quality that matters, these are your earbuds.\nBuy Here The Verge The Dash in-ear true wireless headphones are super fucking expensive—to the tune of $299. But once you see the features, you understand why you’re dropping nearly three bones on a couple pieces of rubberized plastic—especially if you’re a fitness nerd.\nAside from a sleek in-ear design and reliable Bluetooth pairing, The Dash offers 4GB of storage, an ear-bone microphone, a real-time heart rate and fitness tracker, and different-sized ear sleeves for maximum comfort.\nOh, and it offers passive noise isolation, third-party app compatibility, and awesome sound quality—all in a package that won’t make you look like a goddamn space cadet.\nBuy Here Mac Life These things are still on pre-order (they were announced in September and scheduled for release in October), so there’s no real telling when they’re going to arrive. But when they do, be prepared for something really, really cool.\nThe Jabra Elite Sports look a little bulky, but they provide a snug fit that’s ideal for rigorous fitness training. They’re water (and sweat) resistant, feature easy wireless Bluetooth capability, come with their own charging case and, like The Dash, feature noise isolation technology.\nThey’re quite a ways pricier than the AirPods, but given the features, I’d say they’re worth every penny.\nBuy Here One of the most popular options on this list, the IconX, by Samsung, also includes 4GB of storage, a fitness tracker, a built-in heart rate monitor and noise-cancelling technology. Hell, these things are so advanced they even let you turn on ambient sound so that you can hear your surroundings.\nAdditionally, there are also several touch-oriented commands that allow you to do things like access your song menu, skip a track and go backwards or forwards. Oh, and just in case it matters, the sound quality is more than adequate.\nBuy Here If “affordable, but not totally shitty” is the name of your game, the Boots by SmartOmi is an excellent pick. Less than half the cost of the AirPods gets you a fully wireless pair of earbuds that are sweat and waterproof, pair easily with iPhones, and are even one-touch Siri/Google Now enabled.\nThey advertise five hours of battery life—well beyond the norm—so I’m skeptical. Nevertheless, their ratings on Amazon are great, and it seems people’s only complaints about them is that there can be a slight lag when using Siri (but voice commands are clear and the microphone works well), and that when pairing with video, the audio may seem a little off.\nBut for $73 bucks, who’s really complaining?\nBuy Here For another awesome audio accessories list, check out the best headphones that our own audiophile editor hand-picked. \n",

      "text": "While tech giants from the likes of Apple, Microsoft and Facebook chose to play it safe when Donald Trump won the election, the CEO of San Diego -based cybersecurity firm PacketSled opted for a different approach – and publicly threatened to kill the newly elected Republican candidate on Facebook. Unfortunately, his brash and aggressive burst of frustration swiftly backfired when the series of threats aimed at the President -elect shortly made it to Reddit and eventually appeared on a number of media outlets, causing PacketSled to place the aggravated CEO on an administrative leave. “I’m going to kill the the president-elect,” Matt Harrigan wrote on his personal Facebook…\n\nThis story continues at The Next Web",

      "text": "The Careful Craftsmanship of the Apple Watch Hermès   As the brand releases a new book, entitled Designed by Apple in California, Jony Ive and Hermès' Pierre-Alexis Dumas reflect on the care and attention that makes their collaboration so timelessly appealing Apple Watch Hermès \n38mm stainless steel case, single tour strap in bleu agate epsom leather \nThe intersection of fashion and technology is often plagued by slightly clunky permutations: strangely shaped handbags that will charge your mobile phone, or T-shirts that change colour in accordance with your body temperature; essentially, it can all feel a little 1995. Rarely does something arrive on the market that is as simultaneously practical, modern and elegant as the Apple Watch Hermès. With face designs and leather straps inspired by the Hermès archives alongside the technology of the Apple Watch Series 2, it is clearly the harmonious unison of two design powerhouses – and it is simply magnetic. \n\"I think most people would struggle to say why they like this object over that object,\" explains Jony Ive, Apple's chief design officer, \"but I think that people can sense care, in the same way that they can sense carelessness.\" Such a design philosophy directly resonates with that of Hermès, who have built their brand on unparalleled craftsmanship and finesse in execution: \"what gives value and presence to an object is the amount of real care that you put into that process. That is what luxury is today,\" says Pierre-Alexis Dumas, artistic director of Hermès. Thus, the two men – and their respective labels – make for ideal partners. As Dumas says, \"Call it neo-design, call it neo-luxury; it's about being extremely ethical, extremely relevant and always searching for that form of harmony.\"  ",

      "title": "Everything you need to know about Apple's Touch Bar and Touch ID for MacBook Pro",
      "text": "By Daniel Eran Dilger Tuesday, November 15, 2016, 06:10 am PT (09:10 am ET) Apple introduced new Touch Bar and Touch ID features on its 13- and 15-inch MacBook Pro. Here's a look at how they work, what they're useful for, and the potential for seeing these technologies trickle out across the rest of Apple's Mac platform. While Apple called lots of attention to the light, slim design of the new MacBook Pros at their introduction, it focused even more attention on an all new feature that's completely new to the Mac platform: the new Touch Bar and its Touch ID fingerprint sensor that takes the place of a power button. Both are controlled by a custom Apple T1 chip that pairs the efficient processor used in the Series 2 Apple Watch and Apple's Secure Enclave architecture that authenticates biometric data on modern iOS device's Home buttons. Touch ID on the Mac therefore takes biometric security a lot more seriously than previous generations of Windows laptops that incorporated a fingerprint scanner. As with iOS devices, the Secure Enclave makes it impossible for third party apps or even system-compromising malware to gain any access to your fingerprint data. Touch ID, now on the Mac Touch ID is a fingerprint authentication system Apple developed for iPhone 5s in 2013, after acquiring AuthenTec . On iOS devices, it was initially integrated into the Home button. On iPhone 7, the Home button has turned into a \"virtual-button\" sensor paired with a Taptic Engine actuator that provides haptic feeback that makes it feel like a clickable button (similar to the Mac's Force Touch trackpads). As implemented on the new MacBook Pros, the new Touch ID sensor acts as an actual button, although you probably won't need to use it as a button very often. The new machines automatically boot up or wake when opened, skipping any need for startup chime or a power button. However, the button is still there in case you ever need to power it down in the case of a system crash. If you have your machine set up to lock the screen after a moment of inactivity, or have just opened up your machine, you can now unlock the screen instantly with a touch (no need to push the button). It's really, really fast and effortless. A video posted by AppleInsider (@appleinsider_official) on Nov 14, 2016 at 1:00pm PST You can now associate the Touch ID sensor with five different fingerprints (your own, or of other people), which can be used to wake and unlock your own account or to switch between accounts using Fast User Switching. When you initially set up your account, you're promoted to set up Touch ID. This is even easier on the Mac than on iOS devices, as you're simply asked to tap the sensor a few times rather than being promoted to move your finger around. To add a fingerprint to unlock your system account (as well as for use in Apple Pay, iTunes and App Store purchases), you need to present your account password. You're then prompted to set up a second fingerprint by tapping the sensor. To set up fingerprints associated with another account, you'd simply log into that account. This multiple-account, multiple fingerprint behavior on the Mac is likely to eventually make it to iOS devices, as they become more powerful and as multiple accounts evolve into a complete feature. So far, Apple has focused on multiple accounts only for education use. Unlike previous MacBook power buttons, pushing it doesn't offer to sleep, shutdown or log out of the machine. If you do manually log out of your account, you'll need to supply a password to log back in; Touch ID only works if your account is active. You also need to log in manually after a power cycle, just as with iOS devices. Other security precautions related to Touch ID prevent you from switching to other tasks while enrolling a new fingerprint (below). Other uses of Touch ID In addition to unlocking the system, Fast User Switching and authenticating purchases with Apple Pay or in iTunes or the App Store, Touch ID can also be used to instantly unlock Notes you've locked with a password, or other content in third party apps making use of Apple's security Touch ID APIs. One of the first developers taking advantage of Touch ID is 1Password , which uses Touch ID to unlock its password keychain. Apple indicates that locked System Preferences can also be unlocked with a finger print, but that doesn't seem to be working yet. Other places in macOS where you might need to authenticate (including Keychain Access, after you lock your Keychain) also request a password, but with no option to unlock using Touch ID, at least in current builds. Touch Bar To the left of Touch ID, the rest of the F-key strip is taken over by Touch Bar , a 2170 pixel by 60 pixel touchscreen display designed to function as an input device. Like the main display, it reproduces the Wide Color DCI-P3 gamut with Retina resolution, and it's optimized for typical viewing at a 45 degree angle. Apple has devoted a lot of thought into how the Touch Bar should work, as detailed in its macOS Human Interface Guidelines The Touch Bar is intended to appear and function as a dynamic strip of virtual keyboard keys, unconfined by the physical structure of mechanical keys. When you hold down the FN key, the Touch Bar reverts to a standard strip of 12 function keys and the ESC key (below). If you boot into Windows, the Touch Bar reverts to displaying virtual FN keys. Function keys are the least interesting thing the Touch Bar can do Otherwise, the strip displays three pools of functionality: on the right end is a Control Strip of keys offering a mix of conventional alternative MacBook function keys (system volume, media playback, screen and keyboard illumination brightness, Exposé buttons and a button to invoke Siri). This strip collapses down to about a quarter of the Touch Bar in normal use, but a tap on the expansion arrow makes the Control Strip take over the entire Touch Bar (below). You revert back by tapping the close \"X\" button. Control Strip, expanded to take over the entire Touch Bar The main portion of the Touch Bar is used by the current application to offer relevant options based on what you're doing or what you've selected. This app region commonly exposes the same kinds of buttons that you'd see in your window Toolbar (like the Mail app, below), but developers can add new controls including sliders, pickers and suggestions that wouldn't really make sense in a window Toolbar. Mail puts common Tool Bar icons in the Touch Bar, but also a handy folder Move to control It also serves as a way to expose functionality that would otherwise be buried in menus, requiring more mousing around to select. The layout of these app region buttons can commonly be edited from an app's View menu, using an interface similar to how you'd customize your Toolbar buttons (below: editing the Finder's Touch Bar). You simply drag the icons you want toward the Touch Bar on the main screen, and when finished tap the Done button. Editing the Touch Bar within the Finder app Another feature of the Touch Bar —which generally takes over the app region when you're typing —is similar to the QuickType keyboard of iOS. It offers completion suggestions on words you type (below, \"antidisestablishmentarianism\"), and is tied into the standard spell checking of macOS, enabling you to select a spelling suggestion by visually tapping on the word you intended, rather than tapping the space bar to accept the primary suggestion (which in this case would have been \"antics\"). This region can also suggest emojis as you type words (or, below, provide a browsable list of your frequently used emojis or present all the various buckets of emojis: smileys, animals, food, activity, places, objects, symbols, flags). The Touch Bar pickers are all much easier to use than the clumsy, existing emoji selection mechanism of macOS that relies on keyboard shortcuts and mousing around. Additionally, whenever you have a selection of options in a dialog box, those buttons generally show up in the Touch Bar for easy selection (below). Also —borrowing a page from iOS —macOS now suggests autofill information in web forms (such as suggesting your phone number, email or other contact information), and these suggestions similarly appear in the Touch Bar as buttons you can use when filling in forms. Using the Touch Bar feels novel and futuristic (think Star Trek and those glass command panels of graphics moving around). The options displayed can range from very handy to a bit overwhelming, particularly when you switch to a less familiar app and have to absorb the options it chooses to expose. There's no System Preference for turning off the Touch Bar, but it doesn't ever seem to really get distracting, even if you're inside an app where it makes less sense to use it. If the constantly changing nature of contextual buttons in the app region gets overwhelming, you can tap to expand the Control Strip and have a fixed set of static black and white buttons. And despite a report to the contrary, modifier key combinations (such as holding down Option + Shift when adjusting the volume buttons to change the setting in smaller increments) also work with the expanded Control Strip buttons in the new Touch Bar. However, without expanding the Control Strip, volume controls hide behind a single button, which when touched presents a slider control for adjusting the volume, with standard increment buttons on either end. When background music is playing in iTunes (or another app is playing video or audio), the Touch Bar presents a button that when tapped shows a progress indicator and pause, fast forward and review buttons. There's also a red button badged with the currently playing app, which can be used to bring that app forward (below). Notably, there's no indicator presented in the Touch Bar itself showing the name of the song or other content being played. However, this does offer a quick, two tap way to bring up the currently playing app so you can see what's playing. This screen shot blurs the background music playback indicator, but it's the white line between the red iTunes icon and the track selection/pause buttons The value of the Touch Bar changes based on the app you're using. When typing Notes, it basically serves as just a QuickType suggestion field, along with buttons for basic formatting and Note management. One key new features in Notes, however, is lockable Notes. Password protect a Note, and the Touch Bar directs you to authenticate with your fingerprint. Some of Apple's bundled apps present Touch Bar buttons that let you access nearly all of their basic features from the strip. For example, Maps lets you search for a variety of common items like nearby restaurants, cafes or gas stations and then get directions or look up the location's website, call it, favorite it, get more information or share it with just two taps of the Touch Bar. Even utility apps like Activity Monitor expose one-tap control to the various tabs of the display, no mousing required at all. Maps' Touch Bar lets you search for key categories and get directions entirely from the Touch Bar Apple's creative apps, like Photos and Final Cut Pro, offer more specialized technical controls that expose features you'd otherwise have to mouse around to select. Photos, for example, lets you pan through your photos, tap to favorite, tap to edit, and then tap to apply a filter or adjust Light or Color, with a live preview of what it will look like. Photos is a great example of an app using the Touch Bar to present common macOS app features in a more iOS-like fashion, with direct manipulation in a simplified context where it's even more obvious what you're doing. (below, Photos in full screen mode editing an image. The same adjustment controls are presented in the Touch Bar. It's not conveyed in the screen shot, but the direct manipulation it offers is far more satisfying that trying to operate slider controls with the trackpad or a mouse). Third party apps will need to make some effort to present useful features in the Touch Bar, but a variety are already working on functionality due immediately or later this year. Apple demonstrated initial developer support for Adobe Photoshop and djay Pro, an a variety of other developers have also announced they'll be adding specialized support for Touch Bar, including Microsoft's Office and Skype apps; photo editors Affinity Photo, Sketch and Pixelmator; video editor Da Vinci Resolve; Omni's productivity suite including OmniGraffle, OmniPlan, OmniFocus and OmniOutliner; journaling tool Day One; development text editor Coda; blogging tool Blogo and interior design modeling tool Live Home 3D. Overall, Touch Bar seems to be a lot smarter and thoughtful implementation of touch controls for a laptop compared to simply adding a touch screen to make the entire display actionable. I have several times reached out to tap something on a notebook screen after having worked on an iPad. It would seem to be a natural and obvious evolution in notebook computing to make the screen touchable, and clearly Microsoft has bought into the \"obviousness\" of that in its decade of trying to promote Tablet PCs followed by another several years of promoting touch-based Windows 7, 8 and 10. Touch Bar seems to be a lot smarter and thoughtful implementation of touch controls for a laptop compared to simply adding a touch screen to make the entire display actionable However, most users don't see a touch screen PC as being very compelling or valuable, particularly after the novelty wears off. It's fatiguing and pulls your hands off the keyboard. Touch works best when its the primary interface (such as on a phone or tablet) rather than simply being layered on top of the conventional mouse-based desktop. The Touch Bar seems to do a better job of bringing iOS-style touch to conventional notebooks than making the entire screen a touch surface. Apple's Touch Bar puts multitouch controls just above the keyboard, where they remain visible even as you touch type. The more I use it, the more it seems that the dynamic —yet restrained —design of the Touch Bar offers something of real value: it's not just the ability to reach out and touch the existing display as a shortcut to selection with a pointing device. Instead, it presents a hot list of actions distilled down from the busy desktop interface. Other examples include Contacts where the Touch Bar offers big easy buttons for reaching the selected contact, with icons for calling, FaceTime or emailing. Tap the Edit button, and you get large buttons for adding a new phone number, email, birthday or address, after which you can immediately begin typing in the information. That's a quick alternative to mousing to a specific field and then returning to the keyboard or reaching out to touch small targets on a touchscreen monitor. Touch Bar gets thoughtful attention even from simple apps like Contacts Some of Apple's own apps have pretty basic support for the Touch Bar. In System Preferences, it would be more useful if you could edit a list of shortcuts to the Pref Panes you frequently access. Certainly, in some apps the options presented in the Touch Bar are little more than a novelty and at the very worst a distraction. However, there are useful shortcuts throughout even the bundled macOS apps, and the Pro apps Apple has demonstrated so far appear to make smart application of the Touch Bar--in conjunction with the trackpad--in ways that promise to save veteran users a lot of time when doing precise or repetitive tasks. Apple's guidelines seek to keep the Touch Bar uncluttered and easy to use, with generally minimal use of colorful graphics and animations outside of sliding controls in-and-out of focus and representation of screen content or editing results. Touching control buttons and using sliders and other features of the Touch Bar feels fast and fluid. It's also noteworthy that Apple's own implementation of the Touch Bar is far more sophisticated and useful than what was imagined in rumors this summer, where the display strip was portrayed as simply being a copy of the menu bar icons, and portrayed duplicative visualizations of on-screen progress bars and Siri animations, offering very little value to users. Touch Bar and Touch ID on other Macs Given that Apple has liberally applied Touch ID across its iOS lineup from iPad mini 4 to the affordable iPhone SE, it seems likely that other Macs will also eventually get Touch ID beyond the MacBook Pros. However, even the new entry level 13 inch MacBook Pro (and current Retina MacBook) don't yet have it, and adding it to other Macs would require some thinking about how how to best implement it (on the external Apple keyboard? On the side of the iMac?). The way Apple has integrated Touch ID into the Touch Bar suggests that the pair of features might remain a package deal, despite the more significant expense and size of the Touch Bar. It's not obvious how much expense the Touch Bar and Touch ID package would add to a Mac, or to, for example, an external keyboard. Apple's cheapest 13 inch MacBook Pro models with and without Touch Bar are priced $300 apart, but the Touch Bar isn't the only difference between the two models. The Touch Bar model also has a faster Intel CPU, faster RAM, a better graphics processor, and four Thunderbolt 3 ports rather than just two. After introducing Touch Bar and Touch ID to help sell its premium MacBook Pro models, Apple might find it strategic to broaden the installed base of Mac users with access to both features. That would both help to ensure demand for Touch Bar enabled apps from third party developers , and help increase the number of users ready to make purchases via Apple Pay. Apple similarly debuted Touch ID on iOS originally in order to sell its premium iPhone 5s. However, it subsequently rolled the feature out across its iPads and eventually it became ubiquitous as a way to conveniently secure mobile devices using a passcode. That set the stage for rolling out Apple Pay, a feature Apple only recently brought to the Mac to make purchases via the web, authenticating via your iPhone. Topics:",

The CCA says that \"a considerable number\" of iPhone 6 and iPhone 6s users have complained that their phones have completely shut down. According to the China Consumers Association, users report of phones shutting down with more than 50% of the battery charge left. Others say that their handsets have shut down in colder environments. Most of these users say that they've been unable to turn their iPhones back even with the charger on. Apparently, the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6s are facing a deadly brick plague in China.In a public statement on its official website, the CCA explained: \"In view that Apple iPhone 6 and iPhone 6s series cellphones in China have a considerable number of users, and the number of people who've reported this problem is rather many, China Consumer Association has already made a query with Apple.\" The iPhone 6 and iPhone 6s are not the first high-end smartphone models manufactured by a renowned company to face problems in China. Apple's largest rival, Samsung, is now facing a PR nightmare in China, the world's largest smartphone market. According to local agencies, the world's largest smartphone maker has improperly handled the Galaxy Note 7 recall in China. Samsung and Apple are already doing quite badly in China in terms of raw market share . Local smartphone makers such as Oppo, Vivo, Huawei, and Xiaomi dominate the Chinese smartphone market, and it doesn't look like the situation is about to improve anytime soon for either Samsung or Apple.",

      "text": "Global Times says if Trump tries to start trade war, China will stop buying Boeing, Apple and autos   9:45 pm \nYesterday, the nationalistic Party tabloid the Global Times published an editorial previewing what China would do if Donald Trump tried to start a trade war. Spoiler alert: it wouldn't be pretty. \nThe editorial was in response to comments made by Trump economic adviser Judy Shelton when she was asked if the president-elect would follow through on his vows to declare China a currency manipulator on his first day in office . Since being elected, Trump has pulled back on a number of controversial stances he once loudly supported ; however, Shelton signaled that this would not be one of them (even if it should be ). \nTo show what was in store for the United States if Trump did try to declare China a currency manipulator or slap steep tariffs on China-made goods, the Global Times listed a few \"countermeasures\" at Beijing's disposal. China will take a tit-for-tat approach then. A batch of Boeing orders will be replaced by Airbus. US auto and iPhone sales in China will suffer a setback, and US soybean and maize imports will be halted. China can also limit the number of Chinese students studying in the US. The editorial concludes that Trump (a \"shrewd businessman\") would in fact never dare to try to start a trade war with China, writing that rumors of such were merely made up by the ill-intentioned media (who viciously continue to report things that Trump has said).\nSo far, Trump has done nothing but help the Chinese economy. Certain companies have capitalized on his campaign by churning out made-in-China Trump masks , toilet paper and other goods for supporters. According to another article from the Global Times , experts predict that thanks to Trump's stunning win at the polls earlier this month, the gravy train will continue rolling in until at least the presidential inauguration in January. \n\"My workers are busy printing, folding and shipping the flags all day, but even so we have difficulties meeting the soaring demand,\" one factory manager surnamed Yao told the Global Times, adding that he had already sold over 20,000 flags to clients at 4.5-5.5 yuan a piece, reaping big profits. \nYao said that during the campaign season, he had been manufacturing twice as many Trump flags as Clinton flags. Since election day, he had stopped producing Clinton flags all together because of lack of demand. \n\"Of course I support Trump more than Clinton, because I am making a fortune on his winning,\" Yao said, adding that he's considering \"enlarging production lines\" before inauguration day. \nBe careful, Yao. You might just win so much that you get tired of winning . Eat with Shanghaiist",

      "text": "Rumor: Apple May Make Augmented Reality Glasses Is Apple looking to succeed where Google failed with Google Glass? By Matt Porter \nApple is reportedly exploring the possibility of creating augmented reality glasses. \nAccording to Bloomberg , sources say the glasses would connect to iPhones wirelessly, and be able to show images and information in the wearer's field of vision. Apple has not yet confirmed these rumors, and the sources asked not to be identified. \nBack in January there were rumors Apple was working on a virtual reality headset . We will have to wait and see whether these latest reports are part of this project or something different. \nBloomberg reports Apple has ordered small quantities of near-eye displays for testing, however they are told the AR glasses won't be available until 2018 at the earliest. \nApple is still making a lot of money, however its profits are down this year compared to last. The tech giant may be looking for new avenues to expand into. \nLast month Apple unveiled the new MacBook Pro at a special event, alongside some new Apple TV announcements. \nMatt Porter is a freelance writer based in London.

      "text": "\nApple just released a $300 photo book. Titled “Designed by Apple in California,” the sleek white book chronicles the company’s product designs over the past two decades.\n\nThe linen hardbound book is minimalist on the outside with the title on the spine and an Apple logo on the cover. It’s published by Apple with the same care given to its electronic products. The pages inside are “specially milled, custom-dyed paper with gilded matte silver edges, using eight color separations and low-ghost ink.”\n\nInside the book are 450 photos that take the viewer through 20 years of design, starting from the iMac from 1998 through the Apple Pencil of 2015.\n\n\nIt’s a book that’s dedicated to the memory of Steve Jobs, Apple’s founder who passed away from cancer in October 2011.\nShot by photographer Andrew Zuckerman , the photos are minimalist as well, with each product shown in front of a simple white background.\n\n“Designed by Apple in California” is available in two sizes: a 10.2×12.75-inch book priced at $199 and a 13×16.25-inch tome that costs $299. You’ll be able to purchase it starting today from Apple’s website and through select Apple Stores, where it’ll be on display.\n",

      "text": "Apple Wants to Take on Snapchat With Glasses of Its Own An unnamed source told Bloomberg that Apple is working on glasses that could be introduced in 2018. Advertisement \nApple is working on a pair of smart glasses. \nThe product would be introduced in 2018 at the earliest, Bloomberg reported Monday, citing an unnamed source . The project is advanced enough to be in talks with suppliers, the report said. \nThe smart glasses would be Apple's first in a category of product that was originally pioneered by Google with its Google Glass product. Like Google Glass, Apple's smart-glasses product would be geared toward information conveyance instead of immersive augmented-reality experiences like the products that Magic Leap is developing and Microsoft's HoloLens. \nBloomberg cited sources saying the glasses \"may use augmented reality.\" The project is in \"early product testing,\" the Bloomberg report said. \nThe smart glasses would be designed to connect to an iPhone for processing to keep their weight down and keep the design of the frames stylish without adding too many additional electronics. \nA main component of any pair of Apple smart glasses would be the lenses. Last week, Upload VR entrepreneur-in-residence Robert Scoble wrote in a Facebook post that Apple's optics partner was Carl Zeiss, which produces a lens called Zeiss Smart Optics. \nThomas Alt, who joined Apple after the company bought Metaio, an AR company he was the CEO of, is listed as an inventor on a glasses patent assigned to Carl Zeiss. His LinkedIn profile lists him as \"Director of Procurement, Strategic Deals Team\" at Apple. \nA Zeiss representative declined to comment on any partnership with Apple. \n\"I do think that a significant portion of the population of developed countries, and eventually all countries, will have AR experiences every day, almost like eating three meals a day, it will become that much a part of you,\" Apple CEO Tim Cook said last month in Utah . \nApple develops many projects internally, and those efforts often do not ultimately result in a full product that goes on sale. Apple is working on integrating augmented reality into its software, and the glasses would most likely be its first hardware product targeted the AR market. \nThis post originally appreared on Business Insider.

      "text": "Check it out \nThis isn’t your standard book, though. As opposed to being filled with hundreds, if not thousands of words, on Apple’s design history, it’s merely packed with gorgeous pictures. 450 of them, to be precise. \nThe photographs, which were all shot by Andrew Zuckerman, show off 20 years of Apple design in a “deliberately spare style.” Jony Ive described the book as a “gentle gathering of many of the products the team has designed over the years.” \nIn the foreword, Ive writes: \nWhile this is a design book, it is not about the design team, the creative process, or product development. It is an objective representation of our work that, ironically, describes who we are. It describes how we work, our values, our preoccupations, and our goals. We have always hoped to be defined by what we do rather than by what we say. \nWe strive, with varying degrees of success, to define objects that appear effortless. Objects that appear so simple, coherent, and inevitable that there could be no rational alternative. \nObviously, the book isn’t going to appeal to everyone, but it’s certainly going to stand out to the diehard Apple fans amongst us. Dedicated to late CEO Steve Jobs, it’ll be available in the UK, US and a number of other regions starting tomorrow. \nIt will also be on display in select flagship Apple Stores, where you’ll be able to see the book up close before purchasing a copy.",

      "text": "iPad Pro 2 Release Date News & Updates; What To Expect Of Apple's New iPad Pro Tablet? By Matt Lawrence , Parent Herald November 15, 10:24 am Apple's iPad Pro 2 might be a better tablet comparable to a laptop.(Photo : HugoBoss/YouTube) \nDuring Apple's big event earlier this year to unveil its latest lineup of iPhones, the iPad Pro tablets seemed to be missing. It was anticipated that next iteration of Apple's tablet, the iPad Pro 2, would also get a share of the spotlight along with its smaller siblings, the iPhone 7 and the iPhone 7 Plus. Advertisement \nThe absence of the iPad Pro 2 could possibly indicate Apple is reviving up to match its competitors primarily Microsoft's Surface Pro series which could ultimately replace your laptop as reviewed by Techradar . According to Mobipicker , The iPad Pro tablets have never been advertised as productivity devices but have instead been geared toward casual usage. Ok, whose tweet caused @simoncowell to grimace as he left the #XFactor studio last night? #OwnUp #ipadpro pic.twitter.com/M0FlfCLk3B \n— Just Simon Cowell (@JustSimonCowell) November 13, 2016 \nThe 12.9 inch iPad Pro despite its size was never seen as a replacement to the MacBook Air. With the apparent delay of the iPad Pro, here are a few things that the iPad Pro need to work on to keep up with the competition: Better Multi-tasking \nOne of the must-haves of productivity is the ability to multi-task, the ability to have many applications open at the same time is a useful feature. The 12.9 inch iPad Pro introduced the split-screen which has been helpful but not without its limitations. If the iPad Pro 2 is to remain competitive this is one area it needs to work on. Improved Keyboard and Apple Pencil \nThe MacBook Air had a savvy keyboard that felt very comfortable and easy to use. Apparently, the Smart Keyboard on the iPad Pro seemed inferior to the level of quality expected from an Apple product. \nThe iPad Pro 2 needs to have a consistent keyboard experience with the MacBook to reduce or silence its critics. The Apply Pencil has also received its share of criticism. Some users have considered the stylus a fun addition to the device but not exactly a productivity device. An Improved OS \nThis is perhaps one of the biggest issues of the iPad Pro. Microsoft's Surface Pro tablets boast of having a full-fledged Windows OS and all the bells and whistles that come along with it. \nThe iPad Pro, unfortunately, uses an iOS which includes all the limitations that come with that mobile OS. The iPad Pro 2 should consider using the MacOS if it is to compete with the productivity prowess of Microsoft's tablets. \nNo official word has been heard from Apple regarding the release of the iPad Pro 2. It is likely that the release of this anticipated device will be announced early next year. © 2016 ParentHerald.com All rights reserved. Do not reproduce without permission.

      "text": "China looks into sudden iPhone 6 & 6s shutdowns plaguing some Apple customers By Tuesday, November 15, 2016, 07:19 am PT (10:19 am ET) The China Consumers Association on Tuesday asked Apple to investigate complaints that some iPhone 6 and 6s units are shutting off suddenly and permanently, despite nominally having plenty of charge left. Affected iPhones are powering down with 50 to 60 percent remaining on their battery, or in climates at room temperature or below, the CCA said in a statement seen by Reuters . Critically, plugging in the phones doesn't seem to revive them. Though the full extent of the problem is unknown, the CCA said that \"rather many\" people have submitted reports. In the U.S., Apple is facing a class action lawsuit over the so-called \"touch disease\" impacting iPhone 6 and 6 Plus models. Some of those phones have developed flickering gray bands and/or reduced touch sensitivity, possibly because bending in the phones is causing touch controller chips to come loose. The iPhone 6s line hasn't received any large-scale complaints until now, partly because the phone was designed to address some of the flaws of its predecessor —for instance by switching to tougher 7000-series aluminum.

Don't hold your breath. | Topic: Apple \nTouch Bar on the new MacBook Pro \nIf you think that the Touch Bar on the new MacBook Pro is a stepping stone to Apple releasing a touchscreen Mac, you might want to reconsider that in light of comments made by Apple SVP of marketing Phil Schiller. see also Read More \nSpeaking to Backchannel , he was quoted as saying, \"We think of the whole platform. If we were to do Multi-Touch on the screen of the notebook, that wouldn't be enough -- then the desktop wouldn't work that way. Can you imagine a 27-inch iMac where you have to reach over the air to try to touch and do things? That becomes absurd.\" \nThe problem, according to Schiller, is optimizing the user interface: \n\"You can't optimize for both,\" said Schiller. \"It's the lowest common denominator thinking.\" \nFrom this, we can take away a few things: The split between iOS and macOS is here to stay for the foreseeable future If Apple likes to \"think of the whole platform\" then that's a strong indication that the Touch Bar is going to spread to the whole Mac lineup But nothing is set in stone, and things could very well change going forward",

      "text": "I'm not the biggest fan of Apple products. Mainly because the quality of their laptops have gone downhill in the last few years. Not to mention I spent $1,000 on my wife's iPhone and, just like every other iPhone I had before it, the thing's call quality is garbage and it's constantly dropping calls. (don't even get me started on how easy the screen shatters.)\nBut I do get there are some people who have never had a single issue with an Apple product that they've owned and they fervently stand by the company as a result. No matter what Apple does, like removing headphone jacks, or designing laptops that require a ton of adapters for people to hook them up to monitors or simply charge their iPhone 7, the firmly stand by the Cupertino tech company and all pay homage to Steve Jobs every Thursday evening at 7PM, PT.\n\nBut it's hard to not immediately call shenanigans on Apple's latest product: a $300 dollar book that's just photos of their products. \napple \nApple's Newsroom says that Designed by Apple in California will be coming out tomorrow, November 16th, just in time for the Holiday season. So if you wanted to get an expensive and useless gift for the Apple fanatic in your family, and they already own everything Apple sells, then hook them up with this handsome volume.\n\nYour $300 gets what is essentially a printed collection of advertisements on your coffee table. \napple \nThe photographs in the book are all brand new, taken by Andrew Zuckerman. They're meant to show off the 20 years of Apple's products and hopefully inspire new students of design for creating more beautiful products in the future.\n\nApple's Chief Designer Jony Ive's foreword for the book is...interesting. To say the least. \napple \nWhile this is a design book, it is not about the design team, the creative process, or product development. It is an objective representation of our work that, ironically, describes who we are. It describes how we work, our values, our preoccupations, and our goals. We have always hoped to be defined by what we do rather than by what we say.\nWe strive, with varying degrees of success, to define objects that appear effortless. Objects that appear so simple, coherent, and inevitable that there could be no rational alternative.\nShut up, dude.\n\nAnd, just like the newest iPhones, there's a smaller version that retails for only $200! \napple \nThere's no doubt that Apple's created some beautiful looking products, but isn't that price a little steep for a freaking book?\nAdmittedly, it's a pretty looking book...",

      "text": "Apple finalizing deal for $50M AU store in central Melbourne - report  57 am PT (10:57 am ET) Apple is nearing a deal to build a major A$50 million store in the Australian city of Melbourne, a report said on Tuesday. Apple has been in \"lengthy and secretive\" negotiations with the management of Federation Square about acquiring and demolishing the Yarra building there, The Age said on Tuesday, citing industry sources. The replacement will allegedly be a standalone, see-through glass building. The company faces some obstacles, including the fact that the Yarra building is home to the Koorie Heritage Trust, which still has four out of five years left on its lease. On the bottom floor is an Italian restaurant, Il Pom, which is currently enjoying good traffic. The Square's buildings also share unusual postmodern designs, which while controversial when they were unveiled might create some resistance to replacing them with a building following Apple's usual design templates. Federation Square is a popular and profitable government-owned space, simply leased to various businesses and organizations, like public broadcaster SBS. Events are often held there, or broadcast for viewing on a large installed screen —sometimes by thousands of people. Apple has reportedly been searching for a central Melbourne location for a decade. The company already has three shops in the Melbourne area, but none near downtown. Topics:",

      "text": "Previous Next \nApple has unveiled a $300 coffee table book titled Designed by Apple in California , chronicling 20 years of its iconic design history. \nPerhaps the ultimate Christmas gift for any true Apple nerd, the book contains 450 photographs of past and current products, ranging from 1998’s iMac to 2015’s Apple Pencil. It also documents the materials and techniques used by its design team to create its two decades worth of innovation. \nTouchingly, the book is dedicated to Steve Jobs, who died in 2011. “The idea of genuinely trying to make something great for humanity was Steve’s motivation from the beginning, and it remains both our ideal and our goal as Apple looks to the future,” said Jony Ive, Apple’s chief design officer, in a press release. “This archive is intended to be a gentle gathering of many of the products the team has designed over the years. We hope it brings some understanding to how and why they exist, while serving as a resource for students of all design disciplines.” \nThe book is a hardcover edition, bound in linen, and is available in two sizes: $199 for a smaller 10.20″ x 12.75″ version, and $299 for a larger 13″ x 16.25″ edition. It will surely be well-received by hardcore Apple fans, but those of who are growing a little skeptical of its arrogance of late (cough, cough, the underwhelming new Macbook Pro ) may be put off by the sheer corporate vanity of it all. \nDesigned by Apple in California is available to purchase tomorrow, November 16, here .",

      "text": "0 Comments Android and Apple operating systems have been the two major players in the field of mobile app development. It has been years that they have been competing with each other to hold the top spot and in this race for the top position, App store and Google play has been on the highlight. As per the analytical report published last quarter, highlighting the performance of 3 million apps belonging to big players like iOS, Android and Window phone platform , has some major revelations to make.​ Hire Mobile Application Development Company - Get a Quote   One of the most prominent finding reveals that Google's Play store has excelled Apple's App store in terms of downloads. The increment has been achieved by a massive figure of 60% more downloads in comparison to Apple's App store. One fact that is very important to be considered is larger market share that Android operating system have around the globe. This is mainly because of the wide variety of devices that Android operating system supports and a large part of the growth that Google Play is experiencing is due to the position that it holds in the emerging markets. The first name that comes to my mind referring to emerging market of mobile app development is India . Google Play holds the third position in term of App download. The next factor that has added to the success of Google Play is the low-cost devices associated with Android. In contrast Apple supports the iOS devices at premium cost. In-spite of the lead that Google Play holds over App Store in terms of downloads, it is Apple's App store which leads in the amount of revenue generation. As per the report generated for the second quarter of 2014, App Store had generated 80% more revenue in comparison to Google Play. Half of the revenue generated by apple's App store comes from USA, Japan and China . Mobile app developers who choose a single platform for release of their mobile apps has to choose between number of downloads and revenue generation. When we speak about the iOS growth in terms of revenue, China is the best example. Apple has experienced a huge growth in china, since the time they started dealing with China Mobile. China has got huge opportunity for the growth of mobile apps, but you will have to successfully deal with the issues related to localization. Apple has seen a 20% growth compared to the first quarter of 2014. As per the industry experts in mobile app development , the phrase that “west is best” for conducting business has been proved totally wrong in case of Google and Apple. This is supported by the fact that Google and Apple have grown due to their hold in emerging Smartphone markets like India and China. India can serve as the most exiting market for these biggies, as only 10% of the population in India is Smartphone enabled. This gives a huge opportunity for companies like Apple and Google to extend their mobile app development base in India and grow both in terms of downloads and revenue. India could be the best market for the Google Play download, Smartphone adoption and rapid generation of revenue for mobile apps by the end of year 2017. ​ The most recent example is the increase in the market share of sports category with the ongoing ICC world cup 2015. Countries like India, England, Australia, South Africa, etc have witnessed a steep growth in the number of sports apps being downloaded, just by the beginning of the cricket world cup. 2016 is bringing exciting time for mobile application development companies worldwide.",

      "text": "Apple in Talks to Build Flagship Melbourne Store as Two Next-Gen U.S. Stores Set to Reopen This Week   8:08 AM PST by Joe Rossignol After a decade-long search, Apple is believed to be in the final stages of negotiating a deal to open a new AU$50 million flagship retail store in Melbourne's iconic Federation Square, according to The Sydney Morning Herald . Federation Square in Melbourne, Australia (Image: Architecter) Apple has reportedly been in lengthy and secretive negotiations with Federation Square's management and the Victoria state government to demolish the Yarra building in the square and replace it with a standalone, glass retail store. No timeline was provided, but a grand opening would likely remain years away. Federation Square is a government-owned public space home to, among others, public broadcaster SBS and the Australian Centre for Moving Image. The 344,445-square-foot postmodern development, opened in 2002, is primely located in Melbourne's central business district in the inner city. Apple has three existing stores in the Melbourne area, but they are located in shopping malls in the suburbs of Chadstone, Doncaster, and Southland. Apple's new next-generation store in Liverpool, England Meanwhile, in related news, Apple is slated to reopen two more next-generation stores on Saturday, November 19 at 10:00 a.m. local time at the Penn Square shopping mall in Oklahoma City and at the Westfield Montgomery shopping mall in Bethesda, Maryland, a suburb in the Washington D.C. area. Apple's new retail layout often includes wide, open spaces with some combination of large glass doors, indoor trees, touch-sensitive sequoia wood tables and shelves for displaying products, large 6K resolution video screens for marketing and events, and light boxes extending the length of the ceiling. Apple recently opened three other next-generation stores in Edison, New Jersey and Liverpool and Sheffield in England.",

      "text": "Apple's newest product is a $300 photo book Seriously. Staff Writer, Macworld Nov 15, 2016 8:06 AM \nApple is releasing a product this week that isn’t a phone or a watch or a computer. It’s a 450-page book documenting the past 20 years of Apple design, or, in other words, a book of photos of Apple devices. At $300, it costs more than some of those devices. \nThe book, called “Designed by Apple in California,” comes in a large (13-by–16.25 inches) and a cheaper, smaller (10.20-by–12.75 inches) size. The smaller version is a mere $200. Both versions will be available to buy online or in select Apple Stores on Wednesday. \nThe book documents the creation of the 1998 iMac through the 2015 Apple Pencil and took eight years to develop, Apple said. It is dedicated to the memory of Steve Jobs. \n“While this is a design book, it is not about the design team, the creative process, or product development,” Apple design chief Jony Ive writes in the book’s foreword. “It is an objective representation of our work that, ironically, describes who we are. It describes how we work, our values, our preoccupations, and our goals. We have always hoped to be defined by what we do rather than by what we say. We strive, with varying degrees of success, to define objects that appear effortless. Objects that appear so simple, coherent, and inevitable that there could be no rational alternative.” Apple \nYes, Apple products are beautiful. They are simple. They are easy to use. Some could even be (and have been) considered works of art . But the announcement of this book reads more like a parody of Apple, with even the paper described in reverential terms (“specially milled, custom-dyed paper with gilded matte silver edges, using eight color separations and low-ghost ink”). If a potential love interest spots this book on your coffee table, they will know immediately that you take yourself too seriously. \nI am clearly not the target market for a book like this, but I could understand its existence if it were more than just…photos of Apple devices. That said, buying this book could be justified, if you really wanted to: Photographer Andrew Zuckerman’s images are lovely. The book does include the materials and techniques used for each product. Coffee table books from lesser-known designers than Apple often retail for just as much. \nAt least now you know what to buy the Apple fan in your life who already owns every single product the company makes.

      "text": "by Paul Lilly — Tuesday, November 15, 2016 Apple Reportedly Testing Augmented Reality Glasses That Pair With Your iPhone In search of the next big money maker, Apple is considering a foray into augmented reality , a sector company CEO Tim Cook thinks will be really big . The company's interest is described as being in the exploratory phase at this point, as it look at whether there exists a significant market opportunity for a set of AR glasses that would wirelessly connect to iPhone devices, the latter of which is Apple's true cash cow. The secret project is similar to what Google attempted with Glass . Google didn't get all that far with it, at least not on the consumer end of the spectrum, though Google's shortcoming could be a combination of being too early to market and coming out with a prototype device rather than a finished product. Apple would look to avoid both of those potential pitfalls. Apparently Apple has already talked about its AR glasses project with potential suppliers. It even ordered a small batch of near-eye displays from a supplier so that it could test out the technology. That's not to say Apple is close to mass production—its order is well short of what would be required to produce AR glasses in scale, and that's assuming it ends up forging ahead with this anyway. Apple is notorious for getting its hands into different product segments. Some of them work out, such as the iPhone and iPad, while others either fail or never see the light day, such as the oft-rumored Apple-brand television . Virtual reality, augmented reality, and mixed reality are all hot right now. If Apple thinks the market is headed towards alternate reality technologies, now would be a good time to start investing and planning for such a future. The iPhone has been kind to Apple, but with sales slipping , it's in need of another hit. The appeal of AR glasses is that they could be the next big thing while simultaneously bolstering continued interest into the iPhone.",

      "text": "About a month back, Apple officially added Search Ads to its App Store. The move was designed to give developers a simple way to show off their apps to potential users.\nHow are developers responding?\nWell, since the beginning of October, they have nearly doubled their investment in Search Ads, according to fresh findings from mobile analytics and attribution firm AppsFlyer.\nHow are the ads performing? On average, the Search Ads are generating six in-app actions per install, which is the fourth-highest ratio among top media sources.\nAlso of note, 72% of search queries that resulted in an install were not based on the actual name of the app, AppsFlyer finds.\nBigger picture, “Apple is seeking to emulate the success of [Google] that built an empire from one concept: the value of search intent,” notes Shani Rosenfelder, a content marketing lead at AppsFlyer.\nThe effort comes as Apple’s hardware business continues to decline. Year-over-year, in fact, iPhone sales have declined by about 13% to 45.5 million units.\nIncreasing demand for Search Ads, the App Store is expected to expand dramatically over the next few years.\nIndeed, based on data stretching back to the App Store’s debut in 2008, the active app catalogue in the store will increase by 73% from the end of 2016 -- reaching a total of 5 million apps -- according to recent findings from Sensor Tower.",

      "text": "Further Reading Review: Touch Bar MacBook Pros give an expensive glimpse at the Mac’s future Move over, MacBook Pro—there's a new Apple book in town. It's called Designed by Apple in California , and it's a coffee table book filled with pictures of Apple's hardware. The book, like so many other Apple products, is available in two sizes: a 10.20\" by 12.75\" \"Small\" version that sells for $199 and a 13\" by 16.25\" \"Large\" version that costs $300.\nThe book is only a partial history of design at Apple, and it would be better described as a portfolio of Jony Ive's work. It starts in 1998 with the iMac and ends in 2015 with the Apple Pencil, and it doesn't just cover the successful designs— oddball one-offs like the G4 Cube are in there, too.\nJony Ive is still a part of Apple's executive team and he still occasionally gives interviews and narrates product videos, but in recent years, he seems to have scaled back his role at the company. In mid-2015, he handed off his \"day-to-day managerial responsibilities\" to Industrial Design VP Richard Howarth and User Interface Design VP Alan Dye.\nIf the book included inside stories about the design of the products it chronicles, it might be an interesting read—as it is, it's only going to appeal to people who want to pay a lot of money to stare at lovingly rendered phones and laptops. It will be on display at Apple's retail stores, where you can idly leaf through it as you wait for your Genius Bar appointment to start.",

Post to Facebook Apple's newest product is a $200 photo book Looking for a new Apple product this holiday season for the Apple fan in your life? Try a book.  //usat.ly/2fuhYtO   Join the Nation's Conversation   Apple's newest product is a $200 photo book Eli Blumenthal , USA TODAY 11:35   The original iPhone in Apple's new \"Designed by Apple in California\" photo book. (Photo: Apple) \nLooking for a new Apple product this holiday season for the Apple fan in your life? Want to keep the spending under the price of a new Apple Watch, iPhone, iPad or MacBook? \nIt isn't a gadget. It's a photo book. \nTaking its name from the phrase found on every Apple product, “Designed by Apple in California” is perfect for the Apple lover. As with most Apple products, it   two sizes: a \"small\" for $199 and a \"large\" version for $299. Both will feature linen-bound hardcovers with the pages \"printed on specially milled, custom-dyed paper with gilded matte silver edges, using eight color separations and low-ghost ink.\" \nThere does not appear to be the option to buy the book in \"rose gold\" or \"jet black.\" \nThe goal of the Apple-published book is to chronicle the company's past 20 years of product design, from 1998’s iMac to 2015’s Apple Pencil. There are 450 photographs of past and present Apple devices as well as photos that document the company's design process and techniques. \nApple dedicated the book to its late founder, Steve Jobs. \n\"While this is a design book, it is not about the design team, the creative process or product development. It is an objective representation of our work that, ironically, describes who we are,\" writes Jony Ive, Apple's chief design officer in the book's foreword. \n\"It describes how we work, our values, our preoccupations and our goals. We have always hoped to be defined by what we do rather than by what we say.\" \nThe iPhone-maker will begin selling the book tomorrow, November 16, on Apple.com and in various, but not all, Apple Stores around the world. Those who don't want to spend hundreds of dollars can check out the book at one of those locations, free of charge. \nFollow Eli Blumenthal on Twitter @eliblumenthal . CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE",

      "title": "Which core iPhone app is Apple about to kill off forever?",
      "text": "Text Like your childhood dog being sent to the 'farm', it's time to say goodbye to an old, faithful, favourite. Sure, the recent iOS 10 update let you finally remove Apple's little-used apps from your smartphone and tablet home screen, but now the big-A is taking things even further by killing off one of its long-standing core apps for good. Sob. Which one? Well, sadly you're going to have to put up with those Stocks and Compass apps for a little while longer. Instead, it's the tried and tested Videos app that will shortly be no more. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Although still present in the latest iOS 10.2 (beta version 3) build, according to 9to5Mac , the Videos app will soon be knocked on the head to make way for Apple's recently announced TV app. Syncing purchases with on-demand content from all manner of video-providing sources, the new TV app will merge all your playable content on every Apple device you own, from your Apple TV to your iPhone 7 . Most Popular Given the crossover with Videos - the TV app's feature-inferior cousin - it's been suggested that Videos will be dropped from the pre-installed list, but will still be available to download from the App Store for those keen to enjoy its more simplistic charms. If, as expected, the Videos app is knocked on the head, don't expect to see it disappearing from your iPhone or iPad anytime soon. Although set to drop later this year, the TV app will be limited to the United States at launch. Apple has yet to confirm when us Brits will be able to make use of the new service that will also let Apple TV users utilise Siri to tune into live TV. ",

      "text": "Video Sir Jony Ive reflects on the nature of objects, the fragility of ideas, and 20 years of Apple design Sir Jony Ive reflects on the nature of objects, the fragility of ideas, and 20 years of Apple design Design / 15 Nov 2016 / By Tony Chambers Facebook \nSir Jony Ive takes us inside Apple's design studio and opens up about the company's creative processes... \nDeveloped over an eight-year period, Apple's self-published Designed by Apple in California is available in two sizes and printed on specially milled, custom-dyed paper \niPhone, 2007. The spline on the 5052 aluminium alloy housing for every iPhone was custom fit to the unique shape of each 304 stainless steel bezel \nA rare look inside the Power Mac G4 Cube, 2000. The entire computer is suspended within a clear acrylic enclosure to enable a quiet, convection-cooled architecture \nApple Watch, 2015.

The Digital Crown (right) has an 8-pixel optical sensor that provides 200 discrete positions per rotation \nThe book comes slipped in a specially designed envelope \nA slip-in portfolio outlines the technical details of Apple's archive \nMac mini, 2010.

Hundreds of prototype models were tested on more than 600 people to obtain more than 500 measurements. This, combined with additional ergonomic data from more than 10,000 people, contributed to the design of an earpiece defined by the geometry of the ear itself \nApple Watch Sport, 2015. The 7000 Series aluminium is polished to a mirror finish using a four-axis force-feedback wheel, then blasted with zirconia media to create a consistant, satin texture \nMany of us can remember our first encounter with an Apple product. For a rare few, it may have been the Apple 1 (1976). For some, the turning point was the Macintosh (1998). And who can forget the frenzy surrounding the iPod’s debut some 15 years ago, or the iPhone (2007), the iPad (2010), and most recently the Apple Watch and Apple Pencil (both 2015). \nLaunching today, a new book gathers Apple's most memorable projects in a visual compendium engineered with the same precision and scrupulous attention to detail as one of its products. \nThe linen-bound, hardcover volume is printed on specially milled, custom-dyed paper with gilded matte silver edges \nThis is a comprehensive and objective portrait of Apple products produced over the past 20 years. ‘It is a book with very few words,’ writes Sir Jony Ive in the foreword. ‘It is about our products, their physical nature and how they were made.’ The pages that follow trace two stratospheric decades of product design with the effortlessness that’s become synonymous with the company. \nIt is a quiet and elegant work, a high-quality piece of book design, typography and production. It is far from a show-off vanity project. Great care, time – and money – has been spent on making it a paean to good, useful design and manufacturing. It is also of course a paean to Steve Jobs.In the five years since his death, Apple has forged on without him. Designed by Apple in California is a tribute both to him, and to the products that have shaped our future. \nThe tome is Apple at its purest: the products. We caught up with Ive to find out more... \nWallpaper*: The new book, quite unusually for Apple, is a look back. Jony Ive: The biggest challenge for us was the fact that our focus and preoccupation is always on the future. So that tends to exclude much time to look back at the work we have previously done. Sometimes if we are struggling with a particular issue then that gives us reason to go back and look at the way we have solved problems in the past. But because we've been so consumed by our current and future work we came to realise we didn't have a catalogue of the physical products. So about eight years ago we felt an obligation to address this and build an objective archive. Many of the products that you see, we actually had to go out and purchase [laughs]. It's a rather shameful admission, but it's just not an area that we really invested much time or energy in, so we started to build an archive of the physical products. \nThese custom-designed, high-performance tungsten carbide cutting tools were use to manufacture the iPhone 4 bezel \nW*: Objectivity seems to be the key goal? JI: We were intrigued how we could objectively describe, define and catalogue the objects and try to give people a sense of how they were made. Not how they were designed, but how they came to be. How they were manufactured and how you can transform these often-anonymous materials into something that is valuable and useful. \nW*: By looking back, did it trigger memories? JI: You know, I've spent half my life at Apple – so many of us associate different projects with different parts of our lives. It was curious and interesting. For each project there are multiple stories. \nInterestingly, the only way we realised we would finish the project was to treat it like one of the projects in the studio. There were a few things we needed to do to accurately and objectively portray these products. Of course, many of these products are white, so the off-the-shelf printing processes really didn't do an adequate job in describing the colour and surface of those products. So, unsurprisingly we ended up developing custom forms of paper [ from British papermaker James Cropper ] and custom inks. \nThe composition from the launch of the very first iMacs, unveiled in 1998, was replicated exactly for the book \nW*: Did you and the team in turn learn anything from the process of making the book? JI: The products we're working on at the moment, and have been for a while, are the beneficiaries of all the learning we gained from the book – so of course to us they are the very best things we have ever done. Therefore the frustration, the absolute frustration, of not being able to include that work was sometimes enough to make us think this is something we're not going to be able to finish. It's around 20 years of work and it certainly isn't everything we've done – it's the things that we think were salient in our learning or that we just had an affection for. That part [the selection process] wasn't too hard or challenging – we generally all felt the same way about the same products. But certainly to draw a line and say this will be the end of this first catalogue, first book, that was exquisitely painful. \nW*: Quite typically for Apple, the book comes beautifully packaged. JI: We're so used to packaging 3D objects, so that was part of the project we really enjoyed – trying to create a very simple way of protecting the book and not having to force people to deal with a myriad of sticky labels – hopefully it helped the unwrapping and made it enjoyable. So often you can put all of your energy into the primary product that you forget that your actual experience is an aggregation of the product plus all of these peripheral objects like the packaging and shipping box. We really wanted to treat each of them with the care they deserve, or rather, the care that people [the customer] deserves, such as with the draw tab on the cardboard box and the simple tuck on the envelope. \nDetail of the draw tab of the shipping box, which is pulled open to reveal the book inside. Photography: Antonio Camera \nW*: What were your key objectives for the book? JI: We asked ourselves, 'What is the value of a book like this, when most people know these objects so intimately already?'First, to see the objects out of their functional context. Next, to see them in a context of the subsequent products and hopefully how we have learned as a team how technology shifts, moves and evolves. And the other reason was to do with the fact that many people don't really have much of a sense of how their manufactured environment came to be. Most people wouldn't understand how the chair they are sat on is made. One of the things we wanted to do was try and explain as clearly as we can – through photography – how you transform a raw material into a product that you recognise and hopefully use as a daily tool. \nWe decided to be fairly explicit about some of the processes we used. I guess we feel a strong sense of ownership of these processes because they really do aid our understanding and learning and transfer from one product to the next. We feel that more than ever there has been a disconnect between designing and making and really, you can't disconnect them. In the 90s, as manufacturing was outsourced, this chasm developed between where something was made and where it was designed. But designing and making are inseparable if you want the ultimate product to have integrity. Another key point is that the book is being sent to all the major design colleges in the world. We are keen to get it into the hands of young people who are studying design disciplines. It's very important that it’s an educational resource as well. \niPod aboard Space Shuttle Endeavour \nW*: I presume all the photographs (by Andrew Zuckerman) were shot specifically for the book. But there's one incredible image of a Nasa space shuttle? JI: Yes, they were – with the exception of that Space Shuttle image (above). The first image in the book is of the very first iMac. We used the same composition as the launch shot in the 1990s. But we reshot every single product [for the book]. As the project has taken so long we actually had to go back and re-photograph some of earlier products because of how photographic technology had changed and improved. The images of the later products were superior to the earlier ones, so we had to go back to the beginning to keep that perfect consistency throughout the book. Nasa images are quite extraordinary. We were poring over these one day and noticed an iPod on the dashboard, resting up there. I thought that was so funny – it was both humbling and humorous.",

      "text": "Apple’s big App Store purge is now underway Posted Facebook launches a unified inbox for businesses on Facebook, Messenger and Instagram \nEarlier this year, Apple promised it would clean up its iOS App Store by removing outdated, abandoned apps, including those that no longer meet current guidelines or don’t function as intended. That great App Store purge now appears to be underway, according to new data from app intelligence firm Sensor Tower . The company found that app removals increased by 238 percent in October 2016, with mobile games seeing the most deletions. \nApple had originally stated that the deadline for developers who wanted their outdated apps spared was September 7, 2016. However, Apple didn’t take immediate action during the month in terms of large-scale removals. \nThat seems to have changed in October, when 47,300 apps were removed from the App Store, Sensor Tower discovered. \nAnd while it’s true that Apple does delete apps on a regular basis, this figure is around 3.4 times higher than the monthly average of 14,000 for the months of January through September. (See chart below). \nThe figure indicates that Apple is making good on its intention to remove the cruft from its App Store, as earlier stated. \nGiven that “Games” is one of the the largest, most popular, and highly-trafficked categories on the App Store, it’s not surprising that it also saw the most deletions. The report found that of the 47,300 total apps removed, around 28 percent were games. This category was followed by Entertainment, Books, Education and Lifestyle. \nBut there were far fewer deleted apps in the non-game categories. Entertainment and Books were practically tied for second place at 8.99 percent and 8.96 percent, respectively. Education and Lifestyle were even further behind, at 7 percent and 6 percent. \nAlthough the data clearly points to a spike in deletions, this process is likely still underway. Prior analysis of the state of abandoned apps on today’s App Store, indicated that almost half of the apps hadn’t been updated since May 2015. And 25.6 percent hadn’t been updated since November 2013. \nWhat we don’t know for sure is how Apple will define “abandoned.” In its message to developers this fall, the company said that in addition to those that don’t meet the current review guidelines or don’t work as intended, it would also remove apps that “have not been supported with compatibility updates for a long time .” (Emphasis ours.) \nThat statement is vague on purpose – it gives Apple the ability to make judgement calls on individual apps, without having to commit to a hard rule in terms of when the app was last updated. \nDespite this big cleanup, the App Store itself is still growing. Sensor Tower estimates that it could more than double in size by 2020, with 5 million apps available. \nApple, in addition, said that around 100,000 new and updated apps are submitted each week, and the store itself has over 2 million total apps. And with the launch of the iMessage App Store, where iOS apps can include extensions that let them be surfaced through the iMessage interface, Apple’s app marketplace will continue to expand. 0",

      "text": "Dual-lens cameras expected on both Apple's OLED and 5.5\" LCD 2017 iPhone models By Tuesday, November 15, 2016, 09:14 am PT (12:14 pm ET) With Apple apparently gearing up to launch three new iPhones next year, two-thirds of them will include dual-lens camera designs, though users who prefer the 4.7-inch form factor will reportedly be out of luck. A concept render of an edge-to-edge iPhone display. Analyst Ming-Chi Kuo of KGI Securities issued a note to investors on Tuesday, a copy of which was obtained by AppleInsider , in which he forecast once again that Apple will launch three new iPhone models in 2017: A redesigned OLED version, and two featuring legacy TFT-LCD displays in the 4.7- and 5.5-inch sizes. Like the current iPhone 7 Plus, the 5.5-inch model coming next year is expected to boast a dual-camera design, as is the OLED version. But according to Kuo, the 4.7-inch size will not gain dual lenses. Kuo expects that between 65 and 75 percent of new iPhones shipped by Apple next fall will boast dual-camera displays. He predicts that the boost in share will be a boon for Apple supplier Largan, which provides lenses for Apple's dual-camera design. Even before the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus were released, Kuo indicated in September that the two-camera system would remain exclusive to the Plus-sized lineup in 2017. But with the iPhone 7 Plus seeing strong sales so far, he expects more users will gravitate toward larger form factors next year, resulting in a higher share. Next year, Apple is widely expected to introduce an all-new design featuring a glass back and OLED display for its flagship iPhone, celebrating the 10th anniversary of the revolutionary handset. However, it's expected that the so-called \"iPhone 8\" will be sold alongside models with traditional LCD displays, potentially earning them the \"iPhone 7s\" series moniker. Topics:",

      "text": "Apple stock extends losses after China warning about Trump November 15, 2016 SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) – Apple’s stock extended recent losses on Monday after a warning that iPhone sales could suffer if President-elect Donald Trump follows through on campaign threats to impose new tariffs on China. Apple is among several major technology stocks, including Amazon.com, Facebook and Alphabet, selling off since Tuesday’s election as investors shift funds into financial and public works companies seen benefitting from deregulation and infrastructure spending under President-elect Trump. In a continuation of that trend, the Cupertino, California company’s stock fell 2.5 percent on Monday, bringing its loss since Tuesday’s election to almost 5 percent, compared to the S&P 500’s 1.16 percent advance. Adding to concern for Apple investors, an op-ed published in the China government-backed Global Times on Sunday warned of “tit-for-tat” retaliation should Trump follow through on a campaign pledge to impose 45-percent tariffs on all imports from China. “A batch of Boeing orders will be replaced by Airbus. US auto and iPhone sales in China will suffer a setback, and US soybean and maize imports will be halted,” the op-ed said. China has already become a disappointment for Apple, failing to deliver rapid growth that the company hoped would make up for slower iPhone sales in the United States and other mature markets. Revenue from China slumped 30 percent in Apple’s September quarter, worse than the Americas’ 7 percent decline. Apple’s China sales could be hurt by potential trade conflicts as well as the country’s weakening currency, said Rosenblatt Securities analyst Jun Zhang by email. He said he believes China iPhone sales fell in October, even after fixing supply issues affecting the iPhone 7 Plus. Synovus Trust Company Senior Portfolio Manager Daniel Morgan, who owns $33 million worth of Apple shares, warned not to read too much into Trump’s campaign trail threats against China, at least in the near term. “You just don’t just jump in and start rewriting trade agreements,” Morgan said.

A Picture's Worth 20 Years Apple’s Newest Product Is a Book Briefings By Tanner Bowden Photo by Apple \nApple has a reputation for looking forward to places nobody has yet imagined. But the tech company’s newest product is dedicated to the past. Designed by Apple in California examines 20 years of innovation through 450 pages of photographs. Shot by Andrew Zuckerman, the photos examine and detail Apple’s design process and display finished products in a minimal, clean look characteristic of the products themselves , starting with the 1998 iMac and culminating with 2015’s Apple Pencil. \nLike any Apple product, every detail has been addressed in the development of the book, which took place over eight years. The linen-bound volume, published by Apple itself, comes in two sizes and is printed on specially milled, custom-dyed paper with gilded silver edges. Designed by Apple in California is dedicated to the memory of Steve Jobs, and his idea of “genuinely trying to make something great for humanity.”",

      "text": "Apple releasing photo book chronicling 20 years of its designs By Dan Pye ● 43 minutes ago \nIn time for the holidays, Apple is releasing “Designed by Apple in California,” a book with 450 photographs of some of the company’s most iconic products. Starting with 1998’s iMac and ending with 2015’s Apple Pencil, the images Apple has released so far show images of the products standing out on a white background, letting the designs speak for themselves. The press release also promises insights into the “materials and techniques used by Apple’s design team over two decades of innovation.” Jony Ive, Apple’s chief design officer, said the book is dedicated to the memory of Steve Jobs and illustrates the company’s thinking and creative inspiration. \n“The idea of genuinely trying to make something great for humanity was Steve’s motivation from the beginning, and it remains both our ideal and our goal as Apple looks to the future,” Ive said. “This archive is intended to be a gentle gathering of many of the products the team has designed over the years. We hope it brings some understanding to how and why they exist, while serving as a resource for students of all design disciplines.” The book is clearly aimed at hardcore Apple design enthusiasts, as the prices demonstrate: Designed by Apple in California is available in two sizes, 10.20” x 12.75” ($199) and 13” x 16.25” ($299). It will be available starting Wednesday on Apple’s website and in select stores.",

      "text": "Apple’s Latest Product Is A $300 Book About Its Past Products  37 PST \nApple’s products aren’t exactly cheap but if you want to give one as a Christmas gift perhaps you would rather spend $300 on a book instead of more than $1,000 on a new MacBook Pro . Apple’s latest product is a $300 book which basically contains pictures of its past products. The book has been announced today, it’s going to go on sale tomorrow through select Apple retail stores as well as the company’s online store tomorrow. \nFor $300 you get a hardcover book bound in linen. It’s actually available in two sizes. The 10.20″ x 12.75″ version costs $199 while the 13″ x 16.25″ costs $299. It’s just called Designed by Apple in California. \nThe Designed by Apple in California just contains images that showcase 20 years of Apple design “in a deliberately spare style,” according to the press release the company has sent out today. All of the pictures in the book have been shot by Andrew Zuckerman. \nApple’s design czar Jony Ive describes the book as “a gentle gathering of many of the products the team has designed over the years,” he hopes that it’s going to serve as a “resource for students of all design disciplines.” \nApple has published this book itself and dedicated it to the memory of its late co-founder and CEO Steve Jobs.",

      "text": "Reddit After announcing in September that it would begin “ removing problematic and abandoned apps ” in an effort to clean up the App Store, new data shows Apple is now fulfilling that promise with removals dramatically increasing around 238 percent last month. The data below from research firm Sensor Tower (via TechCrunch ) shows around 47,300 apps were removed in October, around 3.4 times more than the average month for the App Store prior to the new purging initiative. Most of the app removals were games— around 28 percent— according to the report, but there is no indication of what percentage of apps were considered abandoned versus apps that didn’t meet guidelines. While Apple first announced the new App Store purge back in September, it gave developers warnings and a 30-day grace period to submit updates to old apps in order to avoid removal. It’s unclear what Apple is considering an “abandoned” app, but it’s likely apps that don’t support the latest iOS releases and iPhone hardware will be targets for Apple. The latest guidelines for the App Store recommends developers remove apps that they are no longer updating. The effort is ultimately to help users avoid potentially running into apps that break Apple’s guidelines or out-of-date apps that might not offer an ideal experience. It shouldn’t make much of a difference in terms of the amount of apps available on the App Store, as even at close to 50,000 app removals in October, Apple continues to get 100,000 submissions a week and maintains at over 2 million apps available.

      "text": "Apple 2m ago \nS napchat’s new Spectacles are all the rage right now, and Apple has decided it wants in on the action. Over the last week or so, people have lined up for hours in California and Oklahoma for a chance to snag a pair of Snapchat’s video-camera sunglasses from a bright yellow vending machine . Since Google stopped selling Glass in 2015, Snapchat is pretty much the only major brand with video-shades on the market, and rumor has it Apple is considering a foray into the smart glasses realm (though hopefully with a different retail strategy). \nRumors of Apple smart glasses have been circulating for a while, and today Bloomberg offered up some more evidence the company is taking the idea seriously. From a January 2015 patent Apple filed for note-taking smart glasses. \nApple patented a design for smart glasses that could assist with note taking way back in 2015. Sure, Apple patents pretty much everything , but the smart glasses concept has clearly been tossed around by Apple engineers. Apple employees say the company has been talking with suppliers, and has even ordered samples of displays. \nApple has a lot to learn from the successes and failures of its predecessors in the smart glasses market. Spectacles have proven to be enormously popular so far, thanks to a lot of hype and the singular purpose of the glasses. Spectacles solely exist to shoot video for the Snapchat app, and design was clearly a priority for Snapchat. \nGoogle Glass, on the other hand, ran into a lot of problems. The battery life was abysmal, there were privacy concerns, and the design made people look like doofuses. The next iteration of Google Glass is aimed at businesses , rather than the average consumer. Google Glass was a terrible accessory. \nWe won’t see these Apple glasses until 2018 at the earliest, but Apple CEO Tim Cook has confirmed that some kind of augmented reality product is in the works. If Apple can design a pair of glasses that offer a useful A.R. experience and don’t make the wearer look like a cyborg wannabe, the devices might just become mainstream.

      "text": "Per a Bloomberg report, Apple Inc. ( AAPL - Free Report ) is mulling venturing into the wearable headsets space, underscoring CEO Tim Cook’s focus on Augmented Reality (AR). The report added that the Cupertino behemoth is unlikely to initiate “mass production” as it has just ordered a small number of near-eye displays for testing purposes from a supplier.\nMedia reports have likened Apple’s efforts to that of Alphabet’s ( GOOGL - Free Report ) failed project Google Glass. Initially called Project Glass, Google Glass was unveiled in 2012 and marked Alphabet’s foray into the wearable technology space. It however ran into trouble, given its exorbitant price tag and for being a social nuisance. The in-built camera in Google Glass was capable of video recording without anyone noticing, thereby causing a massive social outrage.\nHowever, analysts observe that Apple will take serious note of privacy concerns, especially after the Glass fiasco, if it intends to dive into the wearable technology space.\nApple is under tremendous pressure to introduce new products, as it’s most important growth driver – the iPhone– faces falling demand, observes Bloomberg.\niPhone alone contributed about 60% of Apple’s total revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. However, since the last two quarters, the demand for these devices has been soft owing to global macroeconomic weakness especially with currency volatility and declining commodity prices in some key regions across the globe (about 60% of Apple revenues come from International markets).\nAPPLE INC Price\nAPPLE INC Price | APPLE INC Quote:\nIn the recently reported quarter, Apple iPhone unit sales came in at about 45.5 million, down 5% year over year. Revenues from iPhone also declined 13% from the year-ago quarter to $28.2 billion. The company has also been seeing slowdown in demand from key regions like China, which, if it continues, can significantly impact Apple’s financials going ahead.\nAt its third quarter fiscal 2016 earnings conference call, Cook had emphasized the company’s AR efforts for the first time. Technologies such as AI and AR/VR are fast emerging as lucrative business opportunities. According to a recent IDC report, global revenues of the AR/VR market are expected to grow at a CAGR of 181.3% from $5.2 billion in 2016 to over $162 billion in 2020.\nAll tech giants right from Facebook ( FB - Free Report ) to Microsoft ( MSFT - Free Report ) are scrambling to grab a share of this lucrative market. Facebook had acquired Oculus in 2012 to fuel the company’s ambitious VR efforts. At its Oculus Developer conference held last month, Facebook announced another $250 million investment to develop a VR content ecosystem. It also announced some new products including Santa Cruz, a cheaper standalone VR headset with inside-out-tracking. Earlier this year, it launched its VR headset, Rift. In March, Microsoft started shipping its AR headset, HoloLens.\nAt present, Apple has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

      "text": "View a mobile-optimized version on Apple Newsroom \"Designed by Apple in California\" Chronicles 20 Years of Apple Design New Photo Book Tells the Story of Design at Apple CUPERTINO, California — November 15, 2016 — Apple® today announced the release of a new hardbound book chronicling 20 years of Apple’s design, expressed through 450 photographs of past and current Apple products. \"Designed by Apple in California,\" which covers products from 1998’s iMac® to 2015’s Apple Pencil®, also documents the materials and techniques used by Apple’s design team over two decades of innovation.The book is dedicated to the memory of Steve Jobs.“The idea of genuinely trying to make something great for humanity was Steve’s motivation from the beginning, and it remains both our ideal and our goal as Apple looks to the future,” said Jony Ive, Apple’s chief design officer. “This archive is intended to be a gentle gathering of many of the products the team has designed over the years. We hope it brings some understanding to how and why they exist, while serving as a resource for students of all design disciplines.”The products in this book are the result of a profoundly close collaboration between many different groups. Shot by photographer Andrew Zuckerman in a deliberately spare style, the book’s 450 images illustrate Apple’s design process as well as its finished products.In the book’s foreword, Ive explains: While this is a design book, it is not about the design team, the creative process, or product development. It is an objective representation of our work that, ironically, describes who we are. It describes how we work, our values, our preoccupations, and our goals. We have always hoped to be defined by what we do rather than by what we say. We strive, with varying degrees of success, to define objects that appear effortless. Objects that appear so simple, coherent, and inevitable that there could be no rational alternative. \"Designed by Apple in California\" is available in two sizes and printed on specially milled, custom-dyed paper with gilded matte silver edges, using eight color separations and low-ghost ink.

      "text": "By Ric Cowley , News Editor \nApple's stock has fallen following warnings that iPhone sales could suffer should Donald Trump increase tariffs on China when he is instated as President of the United States. \nThe warning caused Apple stock to drop 2.5%. It has now dropped by a total of almost 5% since the election results were announced. \nTrump had previously announced plans for a 45% tariff on all imports from China. It is feared that China would make similar changes to its policies in retaliation. \nRotten luck \nApple's financials have already suffered lately. It posted its first loss in 15 years as part of its FY16 financials, with sales down $18.1 billion year-on-year. \nFollowing the announcement of Trump's election win, Apple CEO Tim Cook sent an internal memo to all employees stating the \"our company is open to all, and we celebrate the diversity of our team here in the United States and around the world.\"",

      "text": "Apple brings back the peach butt emoji Posted Hustle is the grassroots personalized mass texting tool we need \nNobody can touch the peach butt emoji, not even Apple. A couple of weeks ago, Apple dropped the first iOS beta for iOS 10.2 with dozens of new and redesigned emojis . The world needs more emojis, I’m all for it. But Apple also accidentally redesigned the peach emoji and was a bit too literal — it didn’t quite look like a butt . Calm down, no need to grab the pitchforks. Apple released a new beta with a butt-looking peach emoji. \nAs you can see on the top image, the new peach emoji looks even more like a butt. Apple didn’t just roll back to the old emoji design. The company called its emoji designers again and asked them to redraw the peach emoji. \nEmojis accidentally became a universal visual language withs its own set of rules. People now use emojis all the time to add emotions and personality to their messages. And sometimes, a peach can become so much more than a simple peach. TechCrunch’s Devin Coldewey wrote an ode to the peach emoji that sums up pretty well why it’s important to keep the peach butt. \nApple released iOS 10.2 beta 3 yesterday and it’s still only available for developers and public beta testers. You can expect the final version of iOS 10.2 in the coming weeks with a wide range of new emojis. \nMy favorite ones are the new professions. There are male and female emojis for a teacher, astronaut, welder, coder, business worker, farmer, scientist, chef, student, mechanic, doctor/health worker… \nBut the Unicode consortium is also iterating to keep up with new gesture emojis. There will be a finger-crossed emoji, a shrug emoji and a facepalm emoji. Your friends will also need to update their iPhones before you can send each other astronaut emojis.",

      "text": "The   Posted Apple brings back the peach butt emoji \nOnePlus hasn’t done a great job keeping a lid on the 3T. For the past week or so, both it and Qualcomm have been seeding social media with glimpses of the upcoming smartphone, finally taking the official wraps off the device today, a mere five months after launching its latest flagship, the OnePlus 3 . \nThose worried about the company cannibalizing its still fresh handset rest assured – the OnePlus 3T won’t be eating into the 3’s sales because it will be killing the device entirely. As the new handset is unleashed on the world, the hardware startup will be end-of-lifing its predecessor. \nAnd it’s not hard to see why. For starters, there’s the fact that the new phone is, at its name implies, an upgrade to the existing line, bringing an even more impressive set of specs to the already well-received phone. And then there’s the fact that it’s hard to imagine the company’s dropping the 3’s $399 MSRP any lower to make room for the 3T’s $439 asking price. \nThe short lead time will sure irk those who rushed out to pick up the three, but for hold outs, there are some really solid hardware upgrades on board, starting with the already announced bump from Snapdragon 820 to 821 (at 2.35GHz), bringing it up to speed with the Google Pixel. That increased processing power is coupled with a more than generous 6GB of RAM. \nThe battery has been bumped up as well, now at 3400mAh, a 13-percent increases over the 3, coupled with the company’s proprietary Dash quick charging technology, which promises a day’s worth of power with a 30 minute charge – same as with the last one. \nThe 3T will be available with either 64 or 128GB of storage (on the gunmetal version) when it launches November 22 here in the States. It will be launching on the 28 in Europe with a gold colored version arriving soon. While the OnePlus 3 is going away, those who purchased one will still be getting the promised Nougat update according to schedule, along with all future updates, which will happen at the same time for both handsets. 0",

      "text": "Technology Apple, FANG Stocks Stop The Bleeding, For Now, Post-Trump Victory Tuesday was a rare-of-late thumbs-up day for Facebook stock, as well as for shares of the other FANG tech leaders. (Facebook) Reprints \nWith all eyes on them, Apple ( AAPL ) and the FANG largest tech stocks staged a mild rally early Tuesday, each of them rising at least nearly 1%. \nThe big techs had all fallen since the surprise election of Donald Trump as the next president. Trump has championed coal, U.S. manufacturing, a get-tough policy on immigration and other issues that don't favor Silicon Valley, a region that heavily favored his opponent, Hillary Clinton. Trump also has specifically criticized Apple and FANG company Amazon.com ( AMZN ). \nAt the same time, the banking, drug, defense and materials sectors had all seen a lift from the Trump win, but those sectors in general were down Tuesday. \n\"Megacap tech stocks where hedge fund clients were broadly overweight appear to have been viewed as 'safe' and are being used as a source of funds for the rotation into financials, health care and industrials, where investors were not positioned,\" Morgan Stanley said in a research note Monday. IBD'S TAKE: Facebook and Amazon had both been longtime members of IBD Leaderboard , an exclusive list of top stocks at or near buy points that should be a regular check for investors. Both of those FANG company have fallen off, but Leaderboard isn't empty, and tech is still represented. \nTrade limits that Trump might impost could hurt tech companies, and any cutback on the H-1B visa program also would hurt, Daniel Morgan, an analyst with Synovus Trust, said in an email to clients late Monday. Major tech companies rely on the H1-B program to hire skilled workers whom they say they can't find in the U.S., and have long sought to expand that program. In 2016, the U.S. received 236,000 applications for H1-B visas that now are capped at 65,000. \nMorgan, however, pointed out that some Trump campaign promises, including lower tax rates and lower taxes on cash repatriated from overseas would benefit tech companies. \nAlso, while Apple and the FANG gang have fallen since the election, all were in a downtrend at least a week before the election, when most polls said Clinton would win. (IBD's own poll had Trump slightly ahead.) The downturn roughly coincides with September-quarter earnings, where Apple turned in a mixed performance and Amazon missed on EPS. \nAs for the other FANGs, Google-owner Alphabet ( GOOGL ) missed with its revenue, but Facebook ( FB ) and Netflix ( NFLX ) turned in favorable Q3 reports. \nHere's a look at the top techs. Apple \nApple stock was up 1.3% in morning trading in the stock market today , near 107. During the campaign, Trump suggested that Apple bring iPhone manufacturing back to the U.S., but at least one analyst has gone on record saying that would be unrealistic. \nSince the election and through Monday's close, Apple stock fell 5.1%, but Apple's shares had fallen 12% since Oct. 25, when they closed at a nearly a one-year high, through Monday's close. \nApple reportedly is mulling a move into the smart-glasses market pioneered by Google. Facebook \nThe social media leader caught some heat from critics, who said \"fake\" news stories on the site had an effect on the election. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg dismissed the criticism, but he said the company would continue to strive to make sure its content is accurate. \nFacebook stock was up nearly 2% Tuesday morning, near 117. Shares had fallen 7.9% since the election through Monday, and had plunged 19% since Oct. 24, when the stock hit its record high. Google \nShares of Google-owner Alphabet were up nearly 3% Tuesday morning, near 775, after falling 7.8% since the election and 11% since Oct. 28, through Monday. The stock touched its record high of 839 on Oct. 28. \nGoogle and Facebook both said Monday that they will ban fake news sites from using their advertising networks, after misinformation online became an issue during the presidential election. Amazon.com \nAmazon stock was up nearly 3% in morning trading Tuesday, near 739. Since touching a near all-time high Oct. 25, Amazon stock had plunged 17%, through Monday, and had fallen 9.7% since the election. \nTrump has suggested that Amazon has received unfair tax benefits, though he hasn't made any specific proposals. Trump has also feuded with the Washington Post, whose publisher and owner is Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos. \"I do not believe that Trump will exercise any payback, but there is some bad blood there,\" analyst Morgan said in his email note, speaking of Bezos and of certain tech executives who had been strong Clinton backers. Netflix \nThe video-streaming leader saw its shares rise about 1% Tuesday morning, near 114.50. The company in late-October reported far-better-than-expected subscriber gains, and shares touched a near all-time high of 129.30 on Oct. 24. But since then, through Monday, shares had plummeted 14%, and the stock was down 9.7% since the election. \nRELATED:",

      "text": "“We strive, with varying degrees of success, to define objects that appear effortless. Objects that appear so simple, coherent and inevitable that there could be no rational alternative.” — From the forward in Apple’s new book. (Via Apple) Apple fanboys and girls who aren’t satisfied with just spending $700 on a new iPhone or $1,800 on a new MacBook have another type of book that they can drop their money on.\nThe tech giant announced the release Tuesday of a new hardbound photo book celebrating 20 years of design at Apple. “Designed by Apple in California” features 450 photographs of Apple products and is available in small size for $199 and large size for $299.\nThe book — with a spare design to match its iconic products — is dedicated to the memory of Steve Jobs and covers everything from the iMac to the Apple Pencil.\n“The idea of genuinely trying to make something great for humanity was Steve’s motivation from the beginning, and it remains both our ideal and our goal as Apple looks to the future,” Jony Ive, Apple’s chief design officer, said in a release. “This archive is intended to be a gentle gathering of many of the products the team has designed over the years. We hope it brings some understanding to how and why they exist, while serving as a resource for students of all design disciplines.”\nMost anyone who has ever owned an Apple product is aware of and appreciates the strict design sensibility that the company adheres to when it comes to what it produces. The look and feel and even the smell become as important as the performance. Thumbing through a linen-bound hardcover, with “specially milled, custom-dyed paper and gilded matte silver edges, using eight color separations and low-ghost ink” is sure to be intended to reinforce that.\nUsers who put down their digital devices long enough to soak up this tome should just go ahead and light a New Mac candle .\nThe photographs in the book were shot by Andrew Zuckerman, and show off the design process as well as finished products. Ive discusses the book, below, in a YouTube video from Japanese design magazine Casa Brutus. h/t The Verge .\n ",
