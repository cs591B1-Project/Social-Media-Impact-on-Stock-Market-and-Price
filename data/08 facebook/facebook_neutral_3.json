      "text": "Block. Mute. Unfriend. Tensions rise on Facebook after election results Facebook election results Matt Lindner Chicago Tribune \nElection night and the morning after had some taking to Facebook to do housecleaning of their friends list. \n\"I unfriended at least 10 people today because I didn't want to see their celebratory Trump posts,\" says Lauren Lee, a Hillary Clinton voter who lives in Memphis, Tenn. \"I unfriended two more people for making pro-Trump comments on my sad Hillary post, including my husband's aunt who is Facebook obsessed. So, Thanksgiving might be awkward.\" \n\"I unfriended my brother and sister-in-law today, not because they were being particularly obnoxious, and I already knew they were Trump supporters, but because seeing their posts and \"likes\" just serves as a sad reminder to me of how little we have in common,\" added Laura Fitch, a Chicago resident who also voted for Clinton. \"I guess I could have muted them rather than unfriending them, but I just needed that click-release today, I guess.\" \nAs the results rolled in and Donald Trump's election as the 45th president of the United States became official, supporters of both candidates took to Facebook to express their joy and dismay at the outcome. \nFor some, the reaction from supporters of both candidates felt like a bit much. \n\"There was far too much overreaction, on both sides,\" says Adam Kmiec, a Chicago resident who declined to specify whom he voted for in this election. \"I wouldn't characterize it as hostile because I don't think there was a lot negative intent.\" \n\"I'm seeing a lot of despair and a lot of joy,\" added Ashvin Lad, a Chicago resident who also declined to say whom he voted for. \"A lot of uncertainty. A lot of shock.\" \nExperts say some of the reasons people turned to Facebook after the election results came in were to bask in the reflected glory of having voted for the winning candidate and to try to take back some of the power they felt they'd lost when they found out the candidate they voted for didn't win. \n\"When we feel powerless, it is human nature to want to do or say something that will help us feel like we can regain our power,\" says Peg Duros, a licensed clinical social worker and the clinic director at the Center for Contextual Exchange. \"For some, especially when emotions are high, it's a way of trying to discharge some of the emotional activation that they are experiencing. Of course, there are people that simply think that what they have to say is important and believe that others will be interested.\" \nWith social media becoming more and more ubiquitous, Facebook also is simply where we go to interact with other human beings. \n\"Facebook has become our town square because we don't have communities the way we used to,\" says Crystal Clair, a Chicago-based licensed clinical professional counselor. \"To feel heard, understood, appreciated, we share our thoughts. I think, for the most part, people share for camaraderie, not realizing that other people are logging in to fight. Respecting others despite their viewpoints is a lesson we all need to keep at the forefront.\" \nKmiec says he cut ties to a handful of people throughout the election cycle — which turned nasty at times, with candidates and supporters trading barbs that felt deeply personal — but not because he disagreed with their political beliefs. \n\"I unfriended them for their constant stream of political updates and an inability to be civil,\" he says. \nJeffery Beckham is a Chicago-based small-business owner who voted for Clinton who found himself in a particularly heated back and forth with a Trump supporter following the election. It was an acquaintance he met a long time ago at a professional networking event. \nHe says he thinks people are quick to take swipes at others on social media regardless of how close they are to that person simply because it's easy. \n\"Facebook attracts that kind of vitriol because you're behind a computer, and it's so easy to type a harsh response versus saying it in person,\" says Beckham. \"When you read something, you read it in the tone of how you're feeling. Many people were hurt, saddened and angry at the direction our country took last night, so any defense of a Trump vote causes an instant reaction. People were very reactionary last night and still today.\" \nSeeing tensions rise on his feed Wednesday morning, Kmiec felt the need to point out that, hey, we voted for different candidates, but at the same time we're all human beings. \n\"Remember folks, you were friends with one another for a good reason. Don't let politics and the outcome of this election drive a rift between you and people who have/had a different pov and political leaning,\" he wrote. \"I personally like all of you and value you, more than either candidate. Friends can last for life. Election winners, have term limits.\" \nA Facebook spokesman wrote in an email that the U.S. election was responsible for 10 billion likes, posts, comments and shares on the social medium from March 23, 2015, through Nov. 1, 2016. \n\"On Election Day alone, 115.3 million people on Facebook worldwide generated 716.3 million likes, posts, comments and shares related to the election,\" according to Facebook. \nFacebook doesn't have any data on how many unfriendings there were during the 2016 presidential election or on Election Day. It was a bitterly contested race that featured candidates expressing hostility toward each other and accusing each other of lying. \nMonmouth University in New Jersey conducted a study of 802 registered voters in late September and found that \"7 percent of voters report having lost or ended a friendship because of this year's presidential race.\" \nBut all the social media engagement and activity throughout the election cycle hasn't necessarily resulted in people cutting ties with others. \nErin Smith is an independent voter who lives in Illinois and voted for Donald Trump. The night of and the morning after the election, she posted multiple times on Facebook about the results. \nSmith says she refused to unfriend anyone on the site because, while she may not agree with a person, everyone should have a voice. \n\"I think it's ridiculous to (unfriend) because you don't agree with their opinions, candidate or political background,\" she says. \"I believe in the First Amendment and the freedom to speak your mind without fear.\" \nLikewise, Beckham says, he chose not to unfriend anyone during this election cycle, no matter how nasty the comments may have gotten, because at the end of the day, everyone is playing for the same team regardless of whom they're voting for. \n\"I feel it's a responsibility to be open and transparent and provide a perspective that may not be seen or heard by some on the other side of the aisle,\" he says. \"I always remind my friends ... we are all still in the same auditorium, America.\" \n\"People, whether I agree with them or not, add value to my day with their posts and comments,\" Lad added. (It's) always good to understand all sides in a candid way.\" \nSo where do people draw the line between unfriending someone altogether and simply muting them so that those people's posts don't show up in their feed? \nLee says she unfriended as many people as she did because she simply didn't wish to interact with them any longer. \n\"I didn't mute them because that doesn't stop them from commenting on my posts,\" she says. \"I don't need those people in my life, and especially not on Facebook.\" \nBut rather than unfriend or mute, some took a different tack altogether in deleting the Facebook app from their phone and avoiding social media altogether. \nDuros and Clair agree that from a coping perspective, people should never forget that they have a choice when it comes to logging on to social media. \n\"You can either engage in the conversation or disengage,\" Clair says. \"The beauty of Facebook is that you can block, delete or hide people and their views if they are bothering you.\" \n\"We sometimes talk about the notion of hitting the pause button, especially when emotions are intense and the risk that one may say or do something that they may later regret is higher,\" Duros adds. \"Pausing, reminding oneself that they are in a state of shock, a lot of information is coming their way, which they cannot possibly process immediately and will need to take their time to process might help with one's capacity to compartmentalize.\" \nMatt Lindner is a freelancer. \nRELATED STORIES:",

      "text": "Young Melbourne woman believed murdered on Mozambique holiday By 9NEWS Elly Warren. (Facebook) \nA 20-year-old Melbourne woman has died while on holiday in Mozambique, and her family have been told she was murdered. \nElly Warren was on a diving tour in the southern African country when she died. \nHer sister Kristy Warren said her parents had been told Ms Warren was murdered. \n\"My sister was in Africa whilst my mum got a phone call from one of the backpackers saying to her that her daughter has been murdered, as I heard that my heart dropped,\" Kristy wrote on Facebook. \n\"It is a parent's nightmare to get a phone call like this. \n\"Elly was always ambitious and had so many goals to go travelling but maybe she had too many… Rest in peace Elly, you are loved dearly.\" \nHer father Paul Warren also paid tribute to her on Facebook, and said she died yesterday. \n\"My lovely daughter Elly passed away yesterday when overseas. I loved her dearly and I will miss her so much. She is now with God. God bless you Elly…,\" he wrote. \nFriends also took to social media to remember Ms Warren. \n\"Taken way too soon, a gorgeous girl who had an amazing life ahead,\" one friend wrote on Facebook. \n\"A spunky, spirited girl who loved and lived life to the fullest. A unique fearless individual never afraid to tell it straight,\" another friend wrote. \n\"We will miss your beautiful smile, hugs and endless chatting.\" \nThe Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) has confirmed to 9news.com.au it is \"providing consular assistance to the family of a woman who died in Mozambique\". \nDFAT declined to provide further details due to its privacy obligations. © Nine Digital Pty Ltd 2016 ",

      "text": "Facebook 0 Twitter \nJack Vanzet from Melbourne is someone who I’ve been following for some time. He’s managed to put both of his passions – art and music – together to make something special. \nHe’s very much established his own visual style. He creates abstract paintings with heavy brushstrokes to make compositions that are both vibrant and exotic. Meanwhile, his music (through his moniker Thrupence) is also one of main reasons I started making electronic music. \nPut both worlds together and the result is a body of work that simply amazes: psychedelic album covers for the likes of Vance Joy, Luke Howard, and Chet Faker. \nYou can see more of Vanzet’s work over on Instagram .",

      "title": "Singapore's public service first to adopt Workplace by Facebook: Peter Ong",
      "text": "A \nSINGAPORE: A month after Facebook launched a workplace version of its mobile app and website, Singapore announced it is the first public service in the world to get on board the platform. \nIn a speech at the PS21 Excellence through Continuous Enterprise and Learning (ExCEL) Convention on Thursday (Nov 10), head of Civil Service Peter Ong announced that 15 agencies and more than 5,300 public officers are now digitally connected through Workplace by Facebook. \nThis is only the first phase of implementation, and the plan is to have all 143,000 public servants connected through Workplace by the end of March next year, he added. \nMr Ong said that the decision to adopt the platform for all public servants was made \"after considering the various security, cost and usability factors\". \nHe shared that the public service had attempted to similarly connect officers by launching a \"social intranet\" called Cube in 2013, but the platform did not take off as expected due to issues such as the lack of a mobile app, an unfamiliar interface and slow loading times. \nWith the caveat that \"the contexts and starting points\" were different for the two platforms, Mr Ong noted that 82 per cent of those who had activated their Workplace accounts were active weekly users so far, more than the average weekly visitorship on Cube in its first month of launch. \nHe added that agencies have reduced the number of internal emails by posting major announcements on Workplace, senior leaders are engaging with their staff more frequently and meaningfully than before, and there is an \"explosion of activity\" across groups of different sizes and domains. \n\"To me, this is clear proof that unless we dare to try, we will not be able to ride the new waves of technology of the future. \n\"While it is always good to learn from others has someone else done it elsewhere in the world, we should dare to try new things even if they have not been tried before.\" \nThe move towards greater connectivity within the public service comes a few months after the Government announced that public officers will have no access to the Internet on their work computers by next June for security reasons. \nPrime Minister Lee Hsien Loong has said the move is \" absolutely necessary \", while Minister-in-Charge of the Smart Nation Initiative Vivian Balakrishnan stated that the idea is not to restrict the access public servants have to the Internet, but to segregate secure e-mail systems from other activities conducted online. - CNA/mz",

      "text": "Photo of Kamala Harris via Facebook. 7 Moments Worth Celebrating From Tuesday’s Disastrous Election 11.09.16 by Alyssa Klein \nT uesday was an absolute shit storm. A confusing, heartbreaking, tragedy of a shit storm. In the eye of that shit storm, there were a few glimmering moments that were easy to miss. Moments in which history was made, glass ceilings were indeed broken and progress and reason won out. \nBelow, we’ve rounded up seven historic events from Tuesday’s otherwise disastrous election results. We hope these bring you a little comfort and hope—even if just for a fleeting second—on this dark, dark day in American history. Ilhan Omar became the first Somali-American, Muslim woman legislator. \nWith a commanding win in Minnesota’s State House race, Ilhan Omar made history when she became the first Somali-American legislator (and Muslim woman legislator) in U.S. history. \nA policy analyst, community educator, advocate and mother of three, Omar, 34, currently serves as the Director of Policy Initiatives at Women Organizing Women, where she empowers East African women to take civic leadership roles in their community. \nBorn in Somalia in 1982, she and her family fled the country when she was eight, spending four years in a refugee camp in Kenya before coming to the U.S. and eventually settling in the Cedar-Riverside (West Bank) neighborhood of Minneapolis in 1997. As the next State Representative of Minnesota’s District 60B, she’s promised to dedicate herself to closing the opportunity gap and advancing an agenda focused on economic, social, racial, and environmental justice. Kamala Harris became the first Indian-American and second Black woman in the Senate. \nCalifornia’s Obama-endorsed Attorney General, Kamala Harris, was elected to the U.S. Senate last night, making her the second Black woman senator and the first Indian-American senator. (As NBC News points out, although there are currently 20 African-American women in the House of Representatives, there hasn’t been a black woman in the Senate since Carol Moseley Braun, who served one term for Illinois from 1993 to 1999.) The state’s first new senator in 24 years, she’ll take over from the retiring incumbent, Barbara Boxer. \nHarris, 52, was born in Oakland to an Indian mother and a Jamaican father. In 2010, she became the first woman elected as California’s Attorney General. \nDuring her own victory speech last night, Harris encouraged her supporters to stay positive in the face of a Trump victory. “Do not despair. Do not be overwhelmed. Do not throw up our hands when it is time to roll up our sleeves and fight for who we are,” she said in Los Angeles. Kate Brown became the first openly LGBT elected governor. \nOregon Democrat Kate Brown held off Republican challenger Bud Pierce to become the first openly LGBT person to be elected governor in the U.S. \nBrown, who identifies as bisexual, actually stepped into the interim position in February 2015 when Oregon’s previous elected governor, John Kitzhaber, resigned amid a public corruption scandal involving him and his fiancee. Pious Ali, the first African-born Muslim American to hold elective office in Maine, was elected to Portland’s City Council. \nPious Ali is no stranger to making history. A former photojournalist from Ghana who arrived in the U.S. in 2000, Ali, first made headlines when he was elected to the Portland Board of Education in 2013, thus making him the first African-born Muslim American to hold elective office in Maine. \nOn Tuesday, the well-known organizer and activist, 47, was elected to Portland’s City Council with 63 percent of the vote. Catherine Cortez Masto became the first Latina senator. \nDemocrat Catherine Cortez Masto won the Nevada Senate race to become the first Latina senator in U.S. history. It was a tight contest, which saw her defeat Rep. Joe Heck to fill the seat of retiring Senator and Democratic minority leader Harry Reid. \nThe granddaughter of a Mexican immigrant, Cortez Masto, 52, previously served as Nevada’s Attorney General. According to The New York Times , her Senate campaign focused on immigration overhaul and future Supreme Court picks before the Senate. Lisa Blunt Rochester became Delaware’s first woman and first African-American in Congress. \nLisa Blunt Rochester won Delaware’s U.S. House race (her first elected seat) to become the first African-American and first woman to represent the state of Delaware in Congress. She walked away with 55 percent of the vote to defeat Republican Hans Reigle. According to ABC 6 , Rochester, a Democrat, has said her focus in Congress will be jobs, the economy and equal pay for equal work. Stephanie Murphy became the first Vietnamese-American woman elected to Congress. \n37-year-old Democrat Stephanie Murphy defeated Republican incumbent John Mica to become the new Representative of Florida’s 7th Congressional District. The win makes her the first Vietnamese-American woman (and second-ever Vietnamese-American person) elected to Congress in U.S. history. From the bottom of my heart, thank you Florida for the faith you have placed in me. I’m incredibly honored, and I will make you proud. #FL07 pic.twitter.com/PQDnH34Oeb ",

      "title": "PGA Professional brings golf to hospitalized children",
      "text": "PGA Professional brings golf to hospitalized children Facebook | Rob Heering Jr. Published: Tuesday, November 08, 2016 | 2:13 p.m. \nThis article originally appeared in the October 2016 issue of PGA Magazine . \nGrowing up in Southbury, Connecticut, about an hour north of New York City, Robb Heering Jr. knew something wasn’t right when he was younger. He didn’t ever feel “good” on a daily basis. But like most young kids, he was afraid to talk about it. \nAt age 12, Heering was diagnosed with Crohn’s disease, an inflammatory bowel disease that was rare for someone his age. By high school, things had only gotten worse – Heering spent more time in the hospital than at school. Then, during his senior year, a routine medical procedure blew a hole through Heering’s colon and intestines. He was kept alive through a surgical procedure called a colostomy. \nPost-surgery, life still was bleak for Heering. He spent most days on the couch still not feeling well, alone and wondering how he could turn his for- tunes around. One day, Heering’s dad asked him what he was up to and if he maybe wanted to go play golf. Heering said yes, but was hesitant – he’d only had taken lessons on a driving range, and had never been on a course. \nRELATED: Read letter Jack Nicklaus wrote 55 years ago to announce turning pro \nGolf has an amazing way of affecting people in so many positive forms, and that was the case on the course that day for Heering. Hesitant? Not in the slightest. Heering was hooked from the first swing, and golf provided not only a potential future career, but an escape from the hardships he faced in the past. \n“I was really struggling a lot with the physical and mental aspects of life,” says Heering, now 28 and a PGA teaching professional and sales represen- tative for ShipSticks in Wellington, Florida. “But, I had golf. I had motivation. I told myself, ‘You can do this.’ It really took my mind off the disease.” \nEventually moving south to Dallas, Heering found himself at the Jim McLean Golf School in nearby Fort Worth, hitting balls next to then-budding PGA Tour star Jason Day while working feverishly to improve his own game. \nYet, it was the renowned instructors at the golf school that really caught Heering’s eye, steering him towards a career as a PGA teaching professional.“I really got inspired by the world-class teachers at the school,” recalls Heering. “They were helping people reach their dreams and that was something I wanted to do, too, so becoming a PGA Professional was my next goal.” \nRELATED: European Tour remindes players to yell 'fore' \nHeering entered the PGA Professional Golf Management Program in 2009, returning to Connecticut and passing his PAT shortly after. In 2012, he moved to West Palm Beach, Florida, and started working at The Club at Ibis, where he became a PGA member in October 2013. \nThe game was slowly becoming Heering’s escape. No longer did he feel alone or depressed, but instead welcomed and cherished for his hard work and motivating attitude. \n“Really the only thing going through my mind every day at that point was playing golf,” adds Heering. “It’s a sport where the more you play it, the more people you get to know. The PGA Professionals I know today became like a second family to me and they helped me through my struggle. Golf has become my life, and I don’t really know where I’d be without it.” \nAnd with that fresh and enthusiastic outlook, Heering hopes that golf can have the same effect on the patients of the Children’s Hospital at Saint Mary’s Medical Center in West Palm Beach. Heering volunteers with other South Florida PGA Section Professionals through the “Smiling for Life” program, teaching the kids how to golf and hoping he can make even a small difference in their lives. \n“I just want them to enjoy life – and on Wednesdays at 1:30, they get to do that through golf,” says Heering. “It works wonders like you wouldn’t believe. I’ve had parents tell me their kids want to take lessons when they get out of the hospital, and that makes it really special. Golf gave me a new viewpoint on life, and I hope that this program can do the same for these awesome kids.” \nFor Heering, the future surely looks brighter than he ever could’ve imagined. Golf has done more than just provide an escape: It’s provided him a career where he can use the game to change the lives of others – something his dad’s simple question did for him years ago.

      "text": "Spam filter Facebook makes 13 attempts to clone Snapchat. Lucky for some? \nThe social network’s latest attempts to take on Snap Inc at its own game include a new app in Brazil and a new feature in WhatsApp Flash by Facebook. Photograph: Facebook/Play Store Thursday 10 November 2016 10.05 GMT Last modified on Thursday 10 November 2016 10.07 GMT Share on Messenger \nStop me if you think you’ve heard this one before: Facebook has released a Snapchat clone. The new standalone app offers ephemeral picture and video messaging, as well as the all-important AR lenses – sorry, “masks” – and is particularly targeted at users in emerging markets. \nThis is the 13th time Facebook has tried to take on Snapchat by cloning features, releasing direct competitors, or simply attempting to buy its rival wholesale. \nThis time, Facebook is focusing its efforts on ensuring that the app, called Flash , is as lightweight as possible. It takes up less than 25MB of space on an Android phone, according to Facebook, making it about one-third the size of Snapchat. And unlike most of Facebook previous attempts, Flash is Android-first, with no iOS release publicly detailed. \nFlash has hit the Brazilian Play Store, where Facebook hopes that a combination strict data caps, patchy Wi-Fi access, and underpowered smartphones means its approach will give it a step up in the fight against Snapchat. If it can’t beat it in the US, Facebook will go to where Snap Inc has yet to get a foothold. \nAs a brief recap of the past 10 times Facebook has tried to clone Snapchat : one clone of Snapchat Stories, two attempted acquisitions, three standalone apps, two ephemeral messaging implementations, and two new cameras with AR lenses. \nMissing in that list is Facebook’s 11th Snapchat clone attempt, when it started testing yet another new camera with AR lenses in Canada and Brazil at the start of the Olympics . It rejigged the main Facebook app to open directly into the camera. Like how Snapchat does. \nAnd four days ago, Facebook tried to clone Snapchat for a 12th time. The Snapchat feature Stories, already cloned in Instagram, is now being cloned in a test for Facebook’s messaging app WhatsApp. The feature, dubbed “Status” in WhatsApp’s implementation , allows users to take pictures, add stickers and drawings, and share them to all their contacts for 24 hours. Like how Snapchat does. \nThirteenth time luck? It doesn’t seem particularly likely that this will be the time Facebook finally cracks how to entice Snapchat users back to the mothership. But maybe it doesn’t have to: Instagram Stories now has 100 million users, proving that sometimes taking the best features of a competitor can work. \nAnd finally, the photocopier derby isn’t a one-horse race. Snapchat has taken a look at Instagram Stories and seen a feature it would quite like to have on its own platform: the ability to rewind a story . Users of Snapchat stories can now tap on the left side of the screen to rewind by one snap, or swipe left to go back to the start of the story altogether. ",

      "text": "Tweet \nHow could Donald Trump be elected president? Judging by Facebook and Twitter a lot of people are asking that question this week. The same thing happened in the UK back in June when many people struggled to understand how the country could have voted for Brexit. \nWhen everyone you're friends with online reinforces your world view it's easy to convince yourself that most of the world thinks as you do. It comes as a bit of an awakening therefore to discover it isn't the case and that -- shock! -- there may be people who vote that aren't even on social media at all. \nOf course these filter bubbles exist in the wider world too, we tend to hang around with people from similar backgrounds to ourselves, but these groups are much smaller. Similarly, although traditional mass media like newspapers has a political bias it does tend to feature columnists with opposing views occasionally. \nThe internet has made it a lot easier to interact only with people 'like us' to the exclusion of opposing views. Social media acts as an echo chamber and where you could once have had people dispute your views in the comment threads of news media sites these are increasingly being shut down because of the costs and complexities of moderation. \nTom Steinberg, founder of the mySociety digital democracy group, noted on Facebook after the UK referendum result \"This echo-chamber problem is now SO severe and SO chronic that I can only only beg any friends I have who actually work for Facebook and other major social media and technology to urgently tell their leaders that to not act on this problem now is tantamount to actively supporting and funding the tearing apart of the fabric of our societies. Just because they aren't like anarchists or terrorists -- they're not doing the tearing apart on purpose -- is no excuse -- the effect is the same, we're getting countries where one half just doesn’t know anything at all about the other\". \nWe're seeing this problem spilling out of social media into the real world too. Universities used to be places where you went to have your views challenged by learning to assess opposing positions. Yet increasingly we see student unions seek to 'no platform' speakers with controversial opinions and there have to be 'safe spaces' lest delicate young ears be assaulted by views they don't like. \nWe're in a situation where social media, which is intended to bring us together, is actually creating divisions in society. Dr Max Wilson of the University of Nottingham School of Computer Science explains how social media bubbles work in a YouTube video below. He points out that while social media allows us to share our views more widely, it also lets us concentrate our filter bubble still further by turning off posts we don't like or un-friending people with opposing views. \nThe question is, what do we do about it? Stienberg believes that social networks themselves need to act, \"It's in the power of people like Mark Zuckerberg to do something about this, if they're strong enough and wise enough to swap a little shareholder value for the welfare of whole nations, and the world as a whole\". \nCan we tackle the problem? Or do we have to put with the fact that following elections in future there are going to be many more sore losers?",

      "title": "Dear Pantsuit Nation: Thank You. – Jacquelyn Gutc",
      "text": "Dear Pantsuit Nation: Thank You. “I’m telling you. I only survived because of that Facebook group,” I found myself saying to my husband tonight, for probably the third time in a week, only partially joking.\nI was referencing Pantsuit Nation , the secret, pro-Hillary, invite-only group that’s become over 3 million strong in just about three weeks — when we seemed to need it most.\nAs we know all too well, this election was excrutiatingly long and painful. As the election got closer and things were really getting down to the wire, I was getting increasingly stressed.\nFBI Director James Comey said he was reopening the investigation into Clinton’s emails. It seemed ridiculous (don’t even get me started on that whole thing), but Americans are finicky. Then one morning, the first thing I looked at was a friend posting on Facebook how he hoped we enjoy having a dictator and other terrifying things. Why is he saying this? What happened while I was asleep?\nI scroll down.\nAh! From the same friend, a link to a story saying that Trump — for the first time — appears to be leading in national polls. How is this possible?! I wondered. I found it pretty hard to believe that anyone voting for Hillary said, “What? More emails? Guess I’m with Trump now!” But the news seemed scary.\nFirst, I confirmed that Hillary looked to still have several decent paths to an Electoral College victory (the only time I’ve ever been glad for the EC), that other polls did not show Trump leading, and that Democrats across the country were panicking for reasons an NBC article deemed pretty needless .\nThen, I logged off. It felt good that day. It was hard to abstain because—let’s face it—we are Facebook addicts. But it wasn’t healthy to be on social media, especially Facebook. No one was changing anyone else’s mind at that point. New posts would be preaching to the choir and feeding the anxiety.\nIn the days that followed, I’d log in occasionally and be burned all over when that 30-second login caused me to find another friend or acquaintance aligned with Trump. We’d made it so long without me knowing!\nThen I got a notification the Friday or Saturday before the election. A friend had added me to Pantsuit Nation . Immediately, my Facebook feed was flooded with posts from the group. All positive. All in support of Hillary and women and diversity. I hardly saw the regular posts from friends and pages I follow.\nI was hooked.\nThis was a group of men and women from all over America and beyond sharing their stories of why they were voting for Hillary. Whether it was for their children, their grandmother or their right to marry who they love. There were endless photos of people with their children or showing their “I voted” sticker or rocking a pantsuit or sharing a photo of a female ancestor who would’ve loved to see that day. There were testimonials and positive, inspiring posts flooding my feed. There were women going to vote dressed as suffragettes and men wearing high heels, pantsuits or even, in the case of at least one man, a skirt because he thought women should “wear the pants” for the day. There were Muslim women wearing American flag hijabs and first-time voters and people who flew from other countries or states to make sure they placed their historic vote. It was a safe haven for people who wanted to proudly support their candidate and be uplifted without the fear of any negative backlash.\nThe group undoubtedly took away some of my productivity in those final pre-election days, but it was worth it. And when I was feeling down or nervous, I’d check in and see what the group members were posting. I’d laugh, I’d smile, I’d cry, I’d think, hell yes!\nSome of what had the largest impact on me were the people really making a difference. Doing something. There were stories of people making calls for Clinton or canvassing even down to a day or two before the election. One woman shared a selfie with her Uber driver after a long conversation about issues after which she said, he’d decided to vote. Another woman who’d been working the phones talked about an elderly woman who only didn’t vote because she didn’t know where her polling place was. And yet another got at least two more voters out canvassing.\nWhile this group uplifted me at a time when I didn’t know how I would get through the anxiety of the final days before the election, it also inspired me. I’d always been too scared to put myself out there and make calls or canvass, but these people showed me that it can really make a difference and that I need to be more involved. In an election when final numbers are only about 200,000 votes apart, every vote truly does count. I know this more than ever.\nAs America (the whole world?) watched the votes being tallied and Pantsuit Nation felt the road to the White House stopping short for their woman, people turned to the group for support and encouragement as we did in the days before the election. There were calls to mobilize and to be positive and to “go high” and requests for support from people in deeply red states, along with lots of thanks to Sec. Clinton. There were people vowing to donate to causes that a Trump presidency threatens as a way to do something positive. And now, 24 hours after the first states began to come in, the love and positivity keeps flowing. What started as a group to encourage women to wear pantsuits to the polling station has taken on a life of its own and become a phenomenon about so much more than an outfit — even if it is one hell of a powerful outfit. It is about empowerment, bravery, positivity, inclusiveness and support. It helps me know I’m not the only one taking this election outcome so personally and encourages me to dry my tears and look ahead.\nSo to Pantsuit Nation and its founder, thank you. You give me hope, light, direction and inspiration to go high, no matter how low it feels like others go and proved that we are, in fact, Stronger Together.",

The same thing happened in the UK back in June when many people struggled to understand how the country could have voted for Brexit. When everyone you're friends with online reinforces your world view it's easy to convince yourself that most of the world thinks as you do. It comes as a bit of an awakening therefore to discover it isn't the case and that -- shock! -- there may be people who vote that aren't even on social… [Continue Reading]",

      "text": "  \"Martin Murray vs Nuhu Lawal in Monte-Carlo on Saturday night\" Facebook \nMartin Murray will face Nuhu Lawal for the WBA Continental Super Middleweight title in Monte-Carlo on Saturday night, live on Sky Sports. \nLawal holds the WBA Inter-Continental Middleweight crown having stopped Istvan Szili inside six rounds for the title in June, moving to 23-0 with the win and crashing into the WBA rankings at number 12. \nThe Nigerian-born German grabs a golden opportunity to claim the prize scalp of Murray after doctors ruled Dmitrii Chudinov out of the bout with a virus. \nMurray is looking for a big win to move back into World title contention in 2017, and the St Helens favourite says he’s firing on all cylinders again after defeat to George Groves where he revealed that illness during camp played a big part in his performance. \n“Four weeks before I boxed George I was flying in the gym,” said Murray. “If I’d fought him then the outcome would have been completely different. I peaked and then I got ill, I took a couple of courses of antibiotics leading into the fight, so when I fought there was nothing in me. I was shocking and I felt flat. \n“I’d been training for the whole year basically so that with the illness took a lot out of me, I didn’t do anything in the first half of the fight but I still nearly pulled it out of the bag at the end. I wasn’t expecting to lose so when I did, it took a lot out of me. \n“I’ve had a few good holidays since then and took some time out of the gym as I knew that this date was coming, the loss to George did take a lot out of me though. When I lost to George the goal of becoming World champion slipped away a bit but the desire and hunger is still there and I know I am only one win away from getting another shot. \n“I need a win that puts me right back into the mix to fight for a Word title and hopefully this will be that win. I would move down to Middleweight if I could get the right fights but I just can’t seem to get them and there are fights coming at Super-Middleweight. \n“I am far from done as a fighter, it’s just not worked out right for me. When we do nail it, we know that the wins against the big names will be there. I’m not making any excuses or crying over spilt milk but it just didn’t work out for me at Middleweight and I thought I beat Arthur at Super-Middle, but that’s just the way it is, that’s boxing, the politics of the sport. I dint grumble about it because I know that the World title is still there and I believe that I can beat the World champions at Super-Middleweight.” \nMurray’s clash with Lawal is part of a huge night of action in Monte-Carlo as WBA World Bantamweight as the most feared Heavyweight on the planet, ‘King Kong’ Luis Ortiz makes his European debut against Malik Scott. \nWBA World Bantamweight king Jamie McDonnell defends his crown against Liberio Solis. It’s the fifth defence for the Doncaster ace, who followed his stoppage win over Javier Chacon with a pair of impressive wins over Tomoki Kameda in Texas last year and stopped Fernando Vargas in nine rounds at The O2 in London this April. \nStephen Smith has a second World title crack, challenging WBA Super-Featherweight kingpin Jason Sosa. Smith travelled to Connecticut to meet IBF ruler Jose Pedraza in April in his first outing for a World belt, and recovered from that points loss with a commanding win over Daniel Brizuela in his hometown of Liverpool a month later. Puerto Rican-American Sosa defends his strap for the first time having ripped the crown from Javier Fortuna in Beijing in June. \nINFORMATION AND RESERVATIONS \nTickets from 100€ \nMonte-Carlo Société des Bains de Mer T. +377 98 06 36 36 from 10am to 7pm, 7 days a week [email protected] montecarlolive.com",

Here’s how it influenced the US election results The world changed when Donald Trump became the president of the United States. Did Facebook fail the democratic world? By: Sumit Chakraborty | Updated: November 10, 2016 7:04 PM It is clear that this election will remain in memory as one of the most convoluted and hateful results ever, and nothing, absolutely nothing, can explain the selection of a person who used drama, exaggeration, bizarre falsehoods, conspiracy theories, to rise above political ranks. (Picture: Reuters) \nFacebook, connects people. That simple sentence might not mean much in a general argument, but when it comes to choices which define the mostly democratic world, a connection, one realises is the most important aspect. But can an idealistic view be called naive? Facebook with its over billion users, has a policy of ‘giving people a voice’ and a free flow of ideas, and that has an effect on the world. The bad news is, Facebook with its hyper personalised newsfeed has operated a ‘cloud of nonsense’ (in the words of Barack Obama ). At the risk of sounding a techno-dystopian, the newsfeed has single-handedly divided people, creating opinions of irrational fear and rage by introducing them with conspiracy theories and fake news. \nFacebook addiction is a result of the company trying its best to increase the dopamine hits in the blood of the user, appealing to the strongest desires and beliefs. A newsfeed shows comments, user updates and media stories which make the user nod in agreement then being unbiased and also show stories which challenge prejudices or even give a better political overview. Facebook attributes this to its algorithm which is has taken years to develop, but that doesn’t make the company half as responsible. We as users are highly addicted to the social networking website, only because we have become a Yes Man to our personal newsfeed, or rather call it ‘spoonfeed’. \nRationality in humans is a sad story. It is oblivious to prejudices and existing opinions, this is, unless an opposing point of view is reinforced time and again, the brain does not accept it. It is here, that the mob mentality and groupthink do not help at all, which is essentially what Facebook supports. This means that the newsfeed varies from person to person, each day, supporting your views, like a slow poison which slowly engulfs everybody at once. This is not the first time. It has been brought forth by the media time and again, who have asked the tech giant to be more responsible by being a proper ‘editor’ of online content, by producing an unbiased newsfeed, and at least try to segregate credible reporting than fake information. \nFacebook clearly does not want to do that, as it believes, if people are angry, it just gives them a platform to vent it. But as a matter of fact, rage needs empathy and not amplification, reasoned discourse not hyperbolizing debates. According to reports, several people have been caught trying to promote conspiracy theories, and all of them have been Trump supporters, which indirectly meant, Clinton stories were not given ad money by the way Facebook algorithm goes. \nAnd it is not as if Facebook is in denial about it. It has repeatedly said that they are a technology company, not a media house, so they will provide the content based on what the user likes to see, as Facebook says, ‘it is good for our business’. It is clear that this election will remain in the memory as one of the most convoluted and hateful results ever, and nothing, absolutely nothing, can explain the selection of a person who used drama, exaggeration, bizarre falsehoods, conspiracy theories, to rise above political ranks. But brains kept under filter bubbles, divided through a newsfeed surely do. \nThere is still hope, that you-the-user, will one day understand that your hyper-personalised echo chambers will lead you to become a zombie, unable to make your own judgements, not only political but life in general too, because as it is, Facebook does not look like taking any responsibility as a world communication platform for over a billion users. From the point of view of Facebook, only one thing can be said: If they do not get their act together and fix the problem, and if the US loses what distinguishes it from the world, its Liberalism, it won’t be long till companies like Facebook and Google cease to exist.

      "text": "Share on Facebook You've got to hand it to this guy for such an ingenious, yet simple design. The how-to example in the video below is made from approximately 12 feet of copper tubing plus a few fittings (the stainless steel tube option is shown too). Follow the instructions in the video below to learn how to build it yourself. If a torch isn't something you have in your tool kit you can find “push on” fittings from a hardware store that you won't need to solder. NOTE: It is absolutely imperative if you do choose to solder your device, that you use lead-free solder. Prior to 1986, solder in the U.S. contained an alarmingly high content of lead. Chances are, if you live in a house built before the 1980's your tap water is contaminated with the neurotoxin lead due to leeching solder on your water pipes. All the more reason to filter your water with a device like this! Lead solder was the industry standard after all. Watch below: We don't have a water problem.

      "text": "He wants to counter negative prejudices against the turban (Photo: Facebook) Canberra: Scientists, entrepreneurs and actors of Indian origin have been hailed for making a mark in foreign countries, but sometimes the most ordinary people can pull off an extraordinary feat which goes on to inspire people across the world.\nNot long ago, a man called Harman Singh was lauded globally for removing his turban to save a boy’s life after a road accident in New Zealand, and now a taxi driver is being honoured for his kind gesture in neighbouring Australia.\nThe man called Tajinder Pal Singh will be awarded the Northern Territory Local Hero award as part of the ‘Australian of The Year Award’ for his free meal initiative called ‘food van’, through which he has been feeding the poor and needy for the past four years.\n2017 NT Local Hero is food van founder & taxi driver Tejinder pal Singh who provides free food for hungry and needy people around Darwin. pic.twitter.com/IOjUpq7Z9b\n— AusoftheYearAwards (@ausoftheyear) November 2, 2016 After driving taxi for 12-hours, Singh would cook rice and curry in his kitchen to serve as free lunch for the underprivileged. He does this once a month ever since he was abused by a racist passenger, and was inspired to fight the negative prejudice against turbans.\nThree other groups have started feeding the poor on Sundays after being inspired by Singh and he also refused monetary support from the authorities and instead asked supporters to start similar initiatives in their own communities.\nThe award will be given to Tajinder Pal Singh in January 2017.",

      "text": "Follow CBSMIAMI.COM: Facebook | Twitter \nMIAMI (CBSMiami) — With Election Day and concessions behind us, it’s time to look to what’s next for the U.S. and President-elect Donald Trump.\nBack in October, Trump released a plan on what he wants to do in his first 100 days in office. It’s called “Donald Trump’s Contract With The American Voter.”\nThe plan mainly focuses on three things: “cleaning up the corruption” in Washington, protection for American workers, and restoring security and the constitutional rule of law.\nHis first move to clean up corruption would be to attempt to impose term limits on all members of Congress. He also plans to impose a five-year ban on White House and Congressional officials becoming lobbyists after they’ve left the government.\nWhen it comes to protecting the American worker, he plans on identifying and ending abuses that impact American workers and lift blocks to what he calls infrastructure projects like the Keystone Pipeline. He also wants to cancel billions in payments to U.N. climate change programs and use that money to “fix America’s water and environmental infrastructure.”\nWhen it comes to restoring rule of law, Trump plans on canceling every executive action, memorandum, and order issued by President Obama. He also wants to begin the process of selecting a replacement for the late Justice Scalia.\nAs for immigration, within his first 100 days, he wants to begin removing criminal illegal immigrants from the country and suspend immigration from “terror-prone” regions. He also lays out a plan to fund construction of a wall across the U.S-Mexico border with Mexico paying for it.\nHe specified how he plans on working with Congress to repeal ‘Obamacare’ and replace it with ‘health savings accounts.’\nWhen it comes to education, he wants education funding redirected to give parents the right to send their child to the school of their choice and end Common Core. Click here to read the full action plan.\nDonald Trump will be sworn in as the 45th president of the United States on Friday, January 20th.\nClick here to read more about Campaign 2016.",

      "text": "Discuss: ! \nI have said these words to my friends on Facebook who are generally progressive or Libertarians/Republicans who do not like the outcome of the election. I will now say the same to you here with a few differing semantics. \nTo my dear friends on the left and my Republican/Libertarian friends who are \"Never Trumpers:\"We all must rely on each other to mitigate the damage that has just been done. It has been my white male privilege to mostly be worried about the climate and whether or not the Paris Climate Accord will get torn to shreds. One thing I will say in talking to my Conservative friends today is they don't seem to be particularly happy with the result either. But they also take our civic duties seriously. The race for 2018 started yesterday. Next year, there will be some minor local elections as well. \nWith only a few exceptions, every single person who reads this in my feed, in my opinion, is qualified to run for office on their respective ticket. I'd donate money to almost all of you. You are all very smart and well informed people. Especially so for my young Republican friends and Libertarian friends who do not like Donald Trump or the present direction of the Republican Party, it's time to start thinking about this. And likewise, especially so to my friends who are frustrated with the Democratic Party for doing everything in their power to make sure the primary was not too competitive. Many of us saw the risk of this coming but our leaders did not. We must personally hold them accountable in our own ways. Why not do it this way? \nI did not say this part on Facebook but I will say it to you guys because I feel I have more anonymity here. I am considering running for office. No one else knows this yet, not even my girlfriend. Between now and the next election I am going to try to focus on local issues in Austin, Texas. I am going to volunteer with my partner in some kind of social justice capacity so I can learn more about the community I wish to serve. She has already talked about volunteering and now I am really, really on board. \nI don't know when I will feel I have enough experience to run in this city but this has always been a long term goal of mine. Due to my parent's religious beliefs, I had previously planned on waiting until they passed away to do this. It would be difficult on them if I ran for public office. I do not believe I can wait that long anymore. I hope that those of you here on the left will join me in considering this. I would support many of you on the left and I know our readership would too. \nLastly, this community is very special to me. I truly believe it is filled with people in all 50 states and the Western World who are setting the table and dictating the course of Western conversation. I believe that when we talk to each other here we are without fail talking to people who drive political conversations in their friend groups. I believe there is a cascading effect that comes from the best moments this website offers. I ask you to consider running for office but also mentioning these words to your friends. You are welcome to copy and paste these words into your own social media feeds if you want. It is time to use this forum on this level, in my opinion. \nI love all of you.

      "text": " 40 AM Most of the electorate got its news from social media. Do we need to fix that? Facebook posts came from all sides of the political spectrum – and without being vetted for accuracy. screen captures i \nBy Sarah Frier Bloomberg News \nAmerica just endured its first presidential election in which the majority of the electorate got its news from social media. And the outcome is already prompting soul-searching by the companies that shaped it. \nFacebook will have to contend with mounting dissatisfaction over its role as the most widely used news filter in history. Forty-four percent of American adults get their media through the site, many consuming news from partisan sources with which they agree. The proliferation of fake news on Facebook has also been a problem: False stories about the Clinton family committing murder and Huma Abedin being a terrorist flew fast and furious despite refutations from responsible news organizations. Those stories shaped public opinion, said Ed Wasserman, the dean of the University of California, Berkeley Graduate School of Journalism. \n\"This is a landmark,\" he said. \"Trump was able to get his message out in a way that was vastly influential without undergoing the usual kinds of quality checks that we associate with reaching mass public. You had a whole set of media having influence without really having authority. And the media that spoke with authority, the authority that comes after careful fact-checking, didn't really have the influence.\" \nIn a statement, a Facebook spokeswoman said, \"While Facebook played a part in this election, it was just one of many ways people received their information – and was one of the many ways people connected with their leaders, engaged in the political process and shared their views.\" \nYou had a whole set of media having influence without really having authority. And the media that spoke with authority, the authority that comes after careful fact-checking, didn't really have the influence. \nEd Wasserman, Berkeley Graduate School of Journalism \nOnline (on Facebook, of course), current and former employees debated the company's role as an influencer. Bobby Goodlatte, a Facebook product designer from 2008 to 2012, according to his LinkedIn profile, said Thursday that the company's news feed was responsible for fueling \"highly partisan, fact-light media outlets\" that propelled Donald Trump's ascension to the presidency. \"News feed optimizes for engagement,\" Goodlatte wrote. \"As we've learned in this election, (bull----) is highly engaging.\" \nIn the past, Facebook has pushed back publicly against these concerns with a simple premise: News feed is just an amplification of what people would experience in a world without it. In response to Goodlatte, Andrew Bosworth, a veteran Facebook executive who helped create news feed, defended the company: \"News feed isn't perfect but it is at least or more diverse than the alternatives which dominated consumption in the late nineties.\" \nBehind the scenes, Facebook has been studying and analyzing its effect on news consumption. The issue was tackled at high-level meetings this summer, leading to a revision of priorities for news feed to de-emphasize media posts in favor of posts from friends and family. The company's public relations department has worked to frame Facebook as a technology company rather than a media company, celebrating the \"invention\" of news feed on its 10-year anniversary, for example. Meanwhile, Facebook intensified its analysis of its role in creating an echo chamber and spreading fake news. \n\"We can't read everything and check everything,\" Adam Mosseri, the head of news feed, said in an August interview. \"So what we've done is we've allowed people to mark things as false. We rely heavily on the community to report content.\" \nOf course, if false news is spreading in communities that want to believe it, few will mark it as false. \nEcho chambers on Facebook may have helped Trump win, but Twitter gave him a way to reach American voters constantly and without an editor. Clinton also had her own Facebook and Twitter accounts, but Trump, with almost 14 million followers on the site, would often start his own news cycles with deeply opinionated and often incendiary posts. \"I can't think of another instance, in commercial or political communication, where Twitter was used as effectively,\" Wasserman said. \nTwitter's shares rose 4.1 percent Wednesday, boosted by investor recognition of its role in the election outcome. But it hasn't all been good for the company. As Trump rose on the platform, so did a set of racist, misogynist harassers supporting him, and that caused a major headache for the company. These trolls, not officially endorsed by the campaign, would regularly attack Trump's critics, in many cases causing Twitter users to feel unsafe. The clashes highlighted Twitter's inability to effectively address abuse on its platform — a problem that was one reason The Walt Disney Company walked away from a potential bid for the social media site. \nTwitter's executives, when asked about these issues during the election, said that the site is a place for all ideas. If false information or hateful rhetoric surfaces, others on the site will tweet in response. \n\"We have the world talking on this thing about the world,\" Chief Executive Officer Jack Dorsey said in an interview earlier this year. \"So we see every spectrum of idea and conversation.\" \nTwitter didn't respond to a request for comment on Wednesday. One former software engineer, Ben Matasar, posted this tweet: \"For my @twitter alum friends: What did we build?\" Related content",

      "text": "\nMark Zuckerberg has willed himself into becoming a global phenomenon. Facebook is a nearly 16,000-employee media powerhouse worth $350 billion and also an advertising-technology juggernaut on track for annual revenues of $27 billion in 2016 and gaudy profits of $7 billion. Its core product has almost 1.8 billion users, and Zuckerberg has shrewdly assembled a portfolio of properties to buttress Facebook.\nRead more: Fortune’s full list of the businesspeople of the year \nZuckerberg is rightly recognized for his outsize success. Nevertheless, he is surprisingly underappreciated for his business acumen. Yes, he has delegated the commercial aspects of Facebook to Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook’s polished chief operating officer, a Harvard MBA who is 15 years Zuckerberg’s senior. Sandberg’s presence has fostered an “adult supervision” narrative familiar to the Valley. But unlike, say, the Google founders, who turned over the CEO job to Eric Schmidt for a decade before Larry Page stepped back into the position in 2011, Zuckerberg has remained chief executive throughout Facebook’s 12-year sprint to greatness. Despite repeated doubts when Facebook missed the shift to smartphones, when Facebook was thought to have botched its IPO, when Facebook was seen as losing its luster with young people Zuckerberg has remained the company’s chief product visionary and business strategist. Through bold acquisitions and the articulation of a remarkably constant mission, Zuckerberg has kept Facebook on track in the face of full-frontal assaults from the likes of Google , Twitter, Snapchat, and others.\nWhat makes him so effective as a businessperson? An examination of Zuckerberg’s management approach reveals that his success rests on three pillars: his unique ability to look into the future, his otherworldly consistency, and the business discipline he has nurtured in an industry quite often enamored with bright, shiny objects.\nExcerpted from Fortune’s cover story, “ How to Lead Like Zuck ,” by Adam Lashinsky.

      "text": "print Mark Zuckerberg. REUTERS/Brian Snyder \nSilicon Valley's reaction to Donald Trump's presidency has so far been a combination of shock, fear, and cautious optimism. \nTrump winning the election is especially meaningful for Facebook employees, some of whom once reportedly wanted to block the candidate's posts on their social network as hate speech. \nCEO Mark Zuckerberg has been a vocal opponent to Trump's rhetoric of building a wall along the Mexican border and banning Muslims from entering the U.S. On the other hand VC investor Peter Thiel, who donated $1.25 million to Trump's campaign, is a director on Facebook's board. \nSeveral prominent Facebook employees, including Zuckerberg, have now weighed in on the election. We've rounded up their reactions below: View As: One Page Slides Mark Zuckerberg chose to not share his opinion of Trump directly, but appeared to take a veiled jab at the President-elect by saying that \"progress does not move in a straight line.\" He talked about the work that needs to be done to make the world a better place for his daughter Max. Ad boss Andrew Bosworth defended Facebook's role in spreading fake news as only one possible factor that could have affected the election. VP of marketing Carolyn Everson: \"I just didn't think this would be the outcome.\" VP of ad tech Brian Boland: \" It is time to honor each other and ensure that we don't give the divisive, racist, sexist, low standards shown through this election gain hold.\" VP of product design Julie Zhuo became physically ill when she saw that Trump had won. \"Many women will see this setback as a reason to work harder and show the world what we're capable of,\" she said. Messenger chief David Marcus said it's time to \"start rebuilding\" the country.",

My first day it was working fine but then it began throttling connection speeds. I put it down to a bad hotel wifi connection but in the evening I was logged out from my VPN account. I kept trying to log back in but it said 'page invalid'. Even when I was trying to do my online check in thru Air Canada it wouldnt let me download my boarding pass. Since I was leaving in the morning I wasnt too bothered but it proved that my VPN account was not good in China.",

      "text": "share Facebook vows to fight fake news but won't say how Most adults in the US get their news from social media, but a surprising amount of that content on Facebook is misleading or downright false. Save Facebook / Mark Zuckerberg \nFacebook has a news problem. The algorithm powering its Newsfeed can't always distinguish an accurate story from a complete fabrication, which means misleading and false stories regularly circulate throughout the site. Following Donald Trump's win in the US presidential election this week, commentators are arguing that fake stories shared on Facebook's Newsfeed propelled his campaign, and executives at the site need to take responsibility for distributing accurate, vetted news. \nIn a statement shared with TechCrunch , Facebook VP of product management Adam Mosseri said that the company is aware of the fake-news problem. \"We take misinformation on Facebook very seriously,\" the statement says. \"We value authentic communication and hear consistently from those who use Facebook that they prefer not to see misinformation.\" The rest of Mosseri's thoughts read as follows: \nIn Newsfeed we use various signals based on community feedback to determine which posts are likely to contain inaccurate information, and reduce their distribution. In Trending we look at a variety of signals to help make sure the topics being shown are reflective of real-world events, and take additional steps to prevent false or misleading content from appearing. Despite these efforts we understand there's so much more we need to do, and that is why it's important that we keep improving our ability to detect misinformation. We're committed to continuing to work on this issue and improve the experiences on our platform. \nFacebook does not label itself a news organization, even though Pew Research Center found in May that 62 percent of adults in the US get their news from social media, and Facebook is a powerhouse in this space. \nAs BuzzFeed News reported last week, a team of teenagers in Macedonia figured out how to game the Facebook Newsfeed algorithm, and they made up to $5,000 a month circulating fake pro-Trump stories on the site. Their headlines include, \"Breaking: Proof surfaces that Obama was born in Kenya - Trump was right all along,\" and, \"Oprah Tells FOX News Host 'Some White People Have To Die.'\" \nThe prominence of these stories speaks to a larger problem of \" filter bubbles \" on Facebook and other social media sites, where users end up seeing stories and opinions only from sources they agree with. Facebook has not stated how it plans to address the issues of fake news or filter bubbles on the site. \nFacebook came under fire recently for getting rid of human editors who curated the site's Trending news section. The Trending stories are now picked by an algorithm with a poor track record of distinguishing truth from fiction. \nFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg shared his own thoughts on the election, alongside a photo of him holding his daughter as the results poured in. His update read as follows: \nHolding Max, I thought about all the work ahead of us to create the world we want for our children. This work is bigger than any presidency and progress does not move in a straight line. The most important opportunities of Max's generation -- like curing all disease, improving education, connecting everyone and promoting equal opportunity -- will take long term focus and finding new ways for all of us to work together, sometimes over decades.We are all blessed to have the ability to make the world better, and we have the responsibility to do it. Let's go work even harder. ",

      "text": "Courtesy of Tim Finn // A Real American Book Like us on Facebook \nOpening on May 22, 1985, Rambo: First Blood Part II was a fantasy fever dream of jingoism, Sylvester Stallone’s titular character a monosyllabic redeemer of an America that had failed itself in Vietnam. A onetime Green Beret, Rambo needs little more than 90 minutes to rescue abandoned POWs and somehow salvage his country’s intervention in foreign affairs. \nThe movie made more than $300 million worldwide. Coleco, which had experienced a phenomenon with the Cabbage Patch Kids, snapped up the rights to produce a toy line. Neutered for young audiences, this Rambo practiced greater discretion, bloodlessly assaulting enemies in a Saturday morning cartoon. \nColeco hoped Rambo: The Force of Freedom would compete with Hasbro’s G.I. Joe for a share of the military-oriented action figure market. Hasbro, which wasn’t about to touch an R-rated film, decided to combat their potential toy aisle rival by enlisting Stallone’s other trademark character: slow-witted boxer Rocky Balboa. \nIt wasn’t the first time the company pursued a license for a figure that had been established outside of G.I. Joe continuity. Hasbro had released Sergeant Slaughter as a premium mail-away attraction in 1985, co-opting the popular professional wrestler’s recognition among WWE (then WWF) fans. \nSlaughter was a success in toy, cartoon, and comic book form, helping reinvigorate a G.I. Joe line that had been on shelves since 1982—an eternity in action figure years. Hasbro hoped Balboa would do the same, aiming to release a mail-away premium figure in 1987 that would be available to customers who sent in proofs of purchase from other G.I. Joe merchandise. \nEstablishing Rocky’s place in the mythology of the G.I. Joe universe fell on Larry Hama, writer of Marvel’s G.I. Joe comic and a frequent source for hammering out narrative points across the franchise’s many outlets. In a Marvel collection of character biographies titled G.I. Joe: Order of Battle #2, released in late 1986, Hama scripted a brief rundown (above) that presented Balboa as a combat trainer, filling obligations for his \"Reserve time\" by turning their hands into semi-deadly weapons. \nOver at Hasbro, sculptor Bill Merklein was tasked with creating a wax prototype of the character’s action figure: \nAn in-house Hasbro artist created a mock-up of the card art, which featured the boxer wielding a stick with two boxing gloves attached to either end; another Hasbro designer, Mark Pennington, created the control art, which would have been used to further detail the figure. Curiously, Pennington appeared to take more design cues—headband, long hair—from Stallone’s Rambo iconography than he did Rocky's: \nFor kids not yet weaned on crossover movies, this was an exciting prospect: anyone picking up Order of Battle #2 probably imagined a scenario in which Ivan Drago would somehow be dragged into Joe nemesis COBRA’s operations. \nBut it was not to be. In the very next issue of Order of Battle , Marvel printed what must have been one of the few retractions over the appearance of a fictional character, explaining that Balboa’s debut in the previous comic had been a mistake. It was written with the sober language of someone who had just been yelled at by a lawyer. \nHow did this awkward partnership between fictional boxer and fictional military force dissolve? According to former Hasbro product manager Kirk Bozigian, Stallone’s representatives knocked him out of contention. “The reason Rocky was dropped from the G.I. Joe line is because his agents got greedy,” Bozigian tells mental_floss . “While we were designing and sculpting Rocky Balboa, a competing toy company, Coleco, was introducing Rambo action figures and vehicles to compete with us. The decision to drop Rocky was an easy one.” \nAlthough they had recruited the more famous star, Coleco wound up enduring protests by antiwar groups angry that the Rambo toy line appeared to be glorifying combat. The accompanying cartoon lasted just a few months. \nStallone’s likeness has never appeared in any subsequent Joe revival, but Hasbro did wind up releasing a villain in 1987 dubbed Big Boa. Considering his boxing gloves and punching bag accessory, it’s very likely he was originally intended to be a personal nemesis for Rocky. Thanks to some legal red tape, he never got to take his swing. \nAll images courtesy of Tim Finn, author of the upcoming G.I. Joe history A Real American Book . More from mental_floss...",

      "text": "UK news Croydon tram crash: police examine reports of incident in previous week \nFacebook messages described how a tram took sharp bend near Sandilands too fast and braked hard on 31 October Workers at the scene of the tram crash. Photograph: Carl Court/Getty Images   19.27   19.29   \nPolice investigating the tram derailment that killed seven people and injured 51 near Croydon, south London, are examining passengers’ reports that a tram almost came off the tracks in the same place the previous week. \nThe development came as a 19-year-old man was named as one of the victims of Wednesday’s crash. Dane Chinnery had been on his way to work when the Tramlink service from New Addington to Wimbledon overturned at a sharp bend in the track near Sandilands shortly after 6am. \nInvestigators said the tram that crashed appeared to have been travelling too fast round a bend where the maximum speed was 12 miles an hour. Passengers said the driver, who was arrested and bailed after the crash, appeared to have blacked out. \nA spokeswoman for British Transport police (BTP) told the Guardian that officers were investigating reports that surfaced on Facebook after the crash, describing how an early-morning tram on 31 October had taken the bend too fast and braked hard. \nAndy Nias, from Croydon, wrote on 31 October: “30 of us on the tram this morning and we all thought our time was up … tram driver took the hard corner to Sandilands at 40mph!! I swear the tram lifted on to one side. Everyone still shaking … it’s mad.” \nAnother person, James Tofield, shared a message he had sent to his wife at the same time, describing how the tram driver had braked and narrowly managed to stay on the track, adding: “It was like a ride from Alton Towers.” \nA police spokeswoman said: “We were only made aware of the report on social media yesterday and it’s now forming part of our inquiries.” She declined to discuss this or other lines of inquiry further because it was an active investigation. Police near the scene of the crash. Photograph: Carl Court/Getty Images \nTransport sources said the company that operates the Tramlink, FirstGroup, was believed to have opened disciplinary proceedings against another driver who passed a stop signal before Sandilands on 25 October. First declined to comment. \nThe Rail Accident Investigation Board (RAIB) has examined two other derailments on Tramlink in the last five years, both of which occurred at low speed and did not cause casualties. \nWednesday’s crash in which six men and a woman died was the worst tram- or train-related disaster in the UK since 2004. \nThe driver, a 42-year-old man from Beckenham, was arrested on suspicion of manslaughter after the incident. On Thursday morning the BTP said he had been released on bail until May. \nFifty-one people were taken to hospital and seven others made their own way to seek care. Three seriously ill people underwent surgery on Wednesday at St George’s hospital, Tooting, and are now in recovery. Dane Chinnery. Photograph: Facebook \nChinnery, the first victim to be named, worked at a drainage company, Hydro Cleansing. At his family home in New Addington, a man said on Thursday morning it was “too soon” to speak to the media. Friends on social media called for a minute’s applause in his honour at Crystal Palace’s next home fixture. \nMartin Giles, headteacher of Meridian high school, Chinnery’s former school, said staff and students were heartbroken at his death. At least three other former pupils were injured in the incident, he added. “All of the staff in the school share their pain at this difficult time,” Giles said. \nA survivor of the crash paid tribute to the rescue operation, which involved 22 ambulance crews, eight fire engines and five fire rescue units. \nRhys McCausland, 19, who had been on his way to Westminster where he works as a chef, received a deep gash to the head and a cut to the arm in the derailment. He recalled how emergency workers had guided him through the pouring rain to an empty tram nearby, which had been commandeered as a makeshift medical bay. \nHe said he had watched as the most seriously injured were airlifted and taken in ambulances, and buses were laid on to take others to hospital. \nHe remembered little about the crash itself. “To be honest I was completely oblivious,” he said. “It was just an everyday morning … We went through the tunnel, I didn’t think much of it – and then we hit the corner.” He did not want to discuss what he saw in the aftermath. \nTrams on the route travel in a straight line down a dedicated track – an old railway line – at 50mph for more than half a mile before coming out of a tunnel and making a 90-degree turn just before the Sandilands stop. \nThey normally brake sharply just before the end of the tunnel to comply with a 12mph (20kph) speed limit. At 6.10am on Wednesday, emerging into darkness, that point could have been less obvious to a driver. The RAIB said on Wednesday the tram appeared to have been significantly over the speed limit. The mayor of Croydon, Wayne Trakas-Lawlor, lays flowers near the crash scene. Photograph: Steve Parsons/PA \nThe Bombardier-built tram is believed to have been equipped with a “deadman’s handle”, a safety device that would trigger an alarm should a driver take his hand off the controls, and would apply the brakes after three seconds. But there is no equivalent of the track safety and control systems that would automatically stop any train that was speeding. \nMany speed restrictions on the network were lifted by Transport for London after it replaced tracks after bringing the route under its control in 2008, 10 years after it first opened. \nFirstGroup’s chief executive, Tim O’Toole, said: “At this stage we do not know the details of what caused the incident. It is absolutely essential that we find out exactly what happened yesterday and this could take some time. We are working closely with Transport for London and the accident investigators and will continue to provide every assistance ‎to the ongoing investigation.” \nOn Thursday night work was continuing at the crash site. Dozens of police officers were present, while heavy-duty cranes made their way out of the area. At the road junction closest to Sandilands station, several dozen floral tributes had been left. A wide cordon remained in place to prevent the public from milling around the construction equipment brought in to clear the wreckage.",

      "title": "Instagram Adding LIve Video To App 11/10/2016",
      "text": "Of course, Instagram is planning to add live video to its existing app.\nIt’s owned by Facebook, after all, and as CEO Mark Zuckerberg said on a recent earnings call: “We’re putting video first.”\nAs Instagram CEO Kevin Systrom tells the Financial Times , “I think [live video] can enhance what we’re doing.”\nIn the meantime, Instagram rolled out some new tools on Thursday, including Boomerang and mentions.\nIn its Stories section, users can now employ Boomerang to send their videos into an endless play and rewind cycle. Until now, of course, Boomerang has existed as a standalone app. Now, users can simple swipe from “normal” to Boomerang mode to achieve the desired effect.\nAdditionally, content creators can add URL links to their stories, which viewers can explore without actually leaving Instagram.\nWith mentions, meanwhile, users can now share who they are with -- or who they are thinking of -- by “mentioning” them in a story.\nMentioning people in stories works the same as it does in captions and comments. When people add text to your story, they can now type “@” followed by a username, and select the person they would like to mention. Then, their username will appear underlined in their story.\nMore broadly, Facebook continues to push forward with its video ambitions. Last month, the social giant even launched a major ad campaign for Facebook Live.\nThe multiplatform campaign includes TV and out-of-home spots -- including billboards and bus wraps -- as well as digital spots that will run both on and off Facebook’s flagship property.\nSince May, the number of people broadcasting live at any given minute has grown by about 400%, according to internal Facebook figures. It is clearly an engagement magnet, and Facebook has also seen that users comment over 10 times more on Live videos than on regular videos.\nAlthough broadcasts from public figures and publishers have generated some of Live’s largest audiences, the vast majority of live videos come from regular folks, Facebook finds.\nPresently, new mobile video services -- from Facebook Live to Twitter’s Periscope -- are more focused on building audience. “We expect direct monetization to follow,” Nitesh Patel, a director at Strategy Analytics, said in a recent report .\nAs such, worldwide revenue from mobile video will reach $25 billion by 2021, according to the research firm\nThe success of Live is such a big deal to Facebook that the tech giant has been dishing out around $50 million to coax top media publishers and celebs to use it.",

      "title": "9000-Year-Old Polished Axe Uncovered in Ireland",
      "text": "The highly polished stone adze. Image courtesy of York University . Like us on Facebook \nBetween 7530 and 7320 BCE, a funeral took place on the banks of the river Shannon in what is today County Limerick, Ireland. Now, more than 9000 years later, the site provides a window into the burial practices of the area’s ancient inhabitants. As The Irish Times reports, the grave suggests that Mesolithic Irish people led more complex lives than we previously believed. \nThe artifact that led to this conclusion, discussed in a paper recently published in the Cambridge Archaeological Journal , was a stone axe. The polished shale tool, called an adze, was found buried with cremated remains in a pit first discovered 15 years ago. It appears to have been used only for a brief period before someone went out of their way to blunt it. This might indicate it was made especially for the funeral, and that blunting the blade was a symbolic act performed during the rites. \nHandled axes dating back as far as 44,000 years have been found elsewhere in the past, but this highly polished tool is believed to be the oldest adze discovered in Europe. Researcher and paper co-author Ben Elliot said in a statement : \n\"The adze is exceptional as we traditionally associate this polished axes and adzes like this with the arrival of agriculture in Europe, around 3000 years later. Although polished axes and adzes are known from pre-agricultural sites in Ireland and other parts of Europe, to find such a well-made, highly polished and securely dated example is unprecedented for this period of prehistory.\" \nThe site it was uncovered from is also remarkable: The body was cremated before it was buried, a rare practice at the time, and it had the unusual distinction of a wooden post nearby to mark it. The grave may not be the most famous prehistoric burial site in Ireland—that distinction belongs to Newgrange —but it is the oldest known grave in the country.",

      "text": "  \"Joshua wants Luis Ortiz after Klitschko fight\" Facebook \nBy Scott Gilfoid: IBF heavyweight champion Anthony Joshua (17-0, 17 KOs) says he wants to fight unbeaten contender Luis “King Kong” Ortiz (25-0, 22 KOs) in 2017 after he gets done with his mega-fight against former heavyweight champion Wladimir Klitschko in their big money fight. \nJoshua feels that a fight between him and the southpaw Ortiz would be a good fight. Joshua is already thinking about how he could land his right hand to the head and body or Ortiz. Putting a fight together between Ortiz and Joshua would be a cinch given that Ortiz is now signed to the same promotional company. \nHowever, it’s one thing for Joshua to talk about wanting to fight the 37-year-old Ortiz and another thing entirely for him to sign for the fight and face him. Ortiz is a much different fighter than the soft jobs that Joshua has been facing since he turned pro in 2013. \nIt might be a reality check for Joshua, because we already saw him get staggered by Dillian Whyte in their fight last year before Whyte injured his left shoulder. If that had been Ortiz doing the punching in that fight, we might have seen Joshua get blasted out. I’m just saying. The injury that Whyte suffered was a miracle for Joshua, because things looked bleak for him after he was staggered in the 2nd. How often do you see a fighter get injured with the same punch that he hurts another fighter with? It’s not very often. \n“I see how that is going to unfold. That’s another fight, for me, that is no problem,” said Joshua to skysports.com about Ortiz. “Hopefully I defeat Klitschko and then I can fight Luis Ortiz. I will be watching him for sure because he is a competitor in the division that I could face sooner or later, so I have to put him as a priority. If we fight Ortiz, it would be a good scrap because I like fighting southpaws. I’ve got a powerful right hand that I could whip into the body or straight to the head.” \nI’m not holding my breath waiting for Joshua’s promoter Eddie Hearn to throw him into the ring with a talent like Ortiz. I can’t see it happening until Ortiz ages nicely to the 40s. Right now, Ortiz is just WAY too dangerous for Hearn to take a chance in putting his golden goose Joshua in the ring with a live body like Ortiz. He’s still in his prime and he actually fight, which is more than I can say about most of the guys that Joshua has been dining on since he turned pro. \nJoshua has a title defense coming up next month against #8 IBF Eric Molina (25-3, 19 KOs) on December 10 at the Manchester Arena in Manchester, England. It’s anyone’s guess why Joshua and Hearn chose the 34-year-old Molina as his opponent, because Molina was knocked out just last year by WBC heavyweight champion Deontay Wilder in June 2015. Wilder had Molina looking like a human version of a yo-yo with the way he was dropping him left and right. Before the fight was done, Molina had been down four times. It was a TOTAL slaughter from start to finish. \nOrtiz has a fight this Saturday night on November 12 against former Wilder victim Malik Scott (38-2-1, 13 KOs) in Monte Carlo. It’s unclear why Ortiz wanted to fight Scott. There’s no real upside in Ortiz fighting him, because he’s not going to get any credit for beating him. Wilder already knocked Malik out in one round in their fight in 2014. How in the heck is Ortiz going to improve on what Wilder did? Share the post \"Joshua wants Luis Ortiz after Klitschko fight\"",

      "text": "by Kenneth Wieske from Reformed Perspective as quoted by The Transformed Wife – The Shame of Public Nakedness \nEditor’s note: Lori and the author are defining ‘Public Nakedness’ by the narrow definition of a woman in a pair of panties and a bra, which could cover a long, long list of possible levels of modesty/immodesty, from three postage stamp sized pieces of cloth with string all the way to sturdy mid-thigh to mid-arm Mormon underwear. There’s a lot of room there for the interpretation of immodesty. The gist is that this Christian man is feeling defrauded by someone else’s Facebook picture. Real mature. Instead of just clicking off he’s whining about it. \nWhen man fell into sin, his nakedness was exposed. God then gave clothes to cover the shame of Adam and Eve. An animal had to die so that their nakedness was covered. This was a foreshadowing of Christ’s work, in which He was exposed and naked on the cross, taking upon Himself our shame, and shedding his blood for us so we could be covered with the white robes of His righteousness. \nThe way we dress reflects something about our understanding of the Gospel. When Christian men and women expose their bodies in public, they are obscuring the manifestation of the power of Christ’s work in their lives – instead of dressing in decent apparel, with modesty and good sense, they mimic the world, which glories in its shame. \nSadly, many readers will find this article too radical. Christian women can’t wear bikinis? Men should vigilantly avoid looking at such exposed women? \nThere’s a reason this seems radical: we’re so mired in worldliness that we don’t even notice it. Today’s worldly, superficial Christianity produces worldly, superficial Christians. \nYou know what else this type of Christianity produces? Weak, spineless, helpless men threatened by everything they cannot personally control. How judgmental and not so very Christian of them to judge other Christians by how they dress. \nQUOTING QUIVERFULL is a regular feature of NLQ – we present the actual words of noted Quiverfull leaders, cultural enforcers and those that seek to keep women submitted to men and ask our readers: What do you think? Agree? Disagree? This is the place to state your opinion. Please, let’s keep it respectful – but at the same time, we encourage readers to examine the ideas of Quiverfull and Spiritual Abuse honestly and thoughtfully. \nRead more on modesty:",

      "text": "Of course, Instagram is planning to add live video to its existing app.\nIt’s owned by Facebook, after all, and as CEO Mark Zuckerberg said on a recent earnings call: “We’re putting video first.”\nAs Instagram CEO Kevin Systrom tells the Financial Times , “I think [live video] can enhance what we’re doing.”\nIn the meantime, Instagram rolled out some new tools on Thursday, including Boomerang and mentions.\nIn its Stories section, users can now employ Boomerang to send their videos into an endless play and rewind cycle. Until now, of course, Boomerang has existed as a standalone app. Now, users can simple swipe from “normal” to Boomerang mode to achieve the desired effect.\nAdditionally, content creators can add URL links to their stories, which viewers can explore without actually leaving Instagram.\nWith mentions, meanwhile, users can now share who they are with -- or who they are thinking of -- by “mentioning” them in a story.\nMentioning people in stories works the same as it does in captions and comments. When people add text to your story, they can now type “@” followed by a username, and select the person they would like to mention. Then, their username will appear underlined in their story.\nMore broadly, Facebook continues to push forward with its video ambitions. Last month, the social giant even launched a major ad campaign for Facebook Live.\nThe multiplatform campaign includes TV and out-of-home spots -- including billboards and bus wraps -- as well as digital spots that will run both on and off Facebook’s flagship property.\nSince May, the number of people broadcasting live at any given minute has grown by about 400%, according to internal Facebook figures. It is clearly an engagement magnet, and Facebook has also seen that users comment over 10 times more on Live videos than on regular videos.\nAlthough broadcasts from public figures and publishers have generated some of Live’s largest audiences, the vast majority of live videos come from regular folks, Facebook finds.\nPresently, new mobile video services -- from Facebook Live to Twitter’s Periscope -- are more focused on building audience. “We expect direct monetization to follow,” Nitesh Patel, a director at Strategy Analytics, said in a recent report .\nAs such, worldwide revenue from mobile video will reach $25 billion by 2021, according to the research firm\nThe success of Live is such a big deal to Facebook that the tech giant has been dishing out around $50 million to coax top media publishers and celebs to use it.",

      "title": "How You Can help a Teammate Who Has Depression",
      "text": "Share How You Can help a Teammate Who Has Depression on Facebook \nJustine Schluntz swam at the University of Arizona from 2005-2010. She is a Rhodes Scholar and was the 2010 NCAA Woman of the Year. She completed a PhD in engineering at Oxford in 2014 and has returned to Arizona, where she currently teaches engineering. \nFirst, an important thing to know about me: I have depression. \nIn the immortal words of Sam Smith, I know I’m not the only one. High-profile swimmers such as 4-time Olympic gold medalist Allison Schmitt have also opened up about their depression, helping others realize that even those who seem invincible can struggle with (and overcome!) depression. Sadly, we’ve also seen all too many stories in the last few years of swimmers who have taken their own lives due to depression. \nI’m glad that society, and the swimming community in particular, are beginning to understand depression and its severity. I’ve seen many excellent articles on how to improve your mental health (for example, this piece by former US National Team member Emily Brunemann ). \nBut helping yourself is just part of the equation. What about swimmers who don’t have depression themselves, but have a teammate who does, and want to know how to help? Your team is like a second family – it can be really difficult for someone who wants to help a teammate but feels like they can’t. A close friend and Arizona teammate recently talked with me about this, explaining, almost pleading with me, that “we [my UA teammates] want to help you…we just don’t know how .” \nI can’t say what will work best for other people with depression – although there are excellent resources available online. What I can do is give insight into my personal experience, in the hope that some of you reading this might relate. So here’s a few things you might consider. \n1. Ask me how I’m doing \nI know, it can be uncomfortable. You don’t want to get into someone else’s business for fear they might get annoyed or angry with you. But in many cases, including mine, depression can cause someone to turn inwards when they’re hurting. Rather than asking for help when I need it, I tend to shut the world out, which is how a downward spiral can start. Bring me back to the world by getting me to talk about it. \n2. Listen \nIf I do get up the courage to confide in you, listen. It was probably really hard for me to get myself to the point where I was ready to open up. And if you shut me down, it may be all the more difficult for me to do it in the future. \n3. Tell me that you care \nAnd then tell me again and again until I believe you. Because the thing about depression is that sometimes it causes you to forget about all the people that have your back. Most of the time I know I’m loved, but during those low points when reality fades away in favor of darkness, I can lose sight of this fact. When I was at my lowest point, teammates who kept reminding me that they love me helped me claw my way out of the darkness. \n4. Hold me accountable \nDepression can spiral downward quickly. Sometimes people with depression have trouble finding the motivation to get up, to leave the house, to exercise, to go to that social event all their friends are at. You get the picture. But the thing is, when I can actually get myself to do those things, it makes me feel so much better . My closest friends are willing to call me, to nag me, to come over, to do whatever it takes to give me that push I need to get over the hump and do the things that I enjoy and that help my mental health. \n5.

      "text": "The Next Billion 2 hours ago \nNo matter how hard Facebook tries, its Instagram Stories and Messenger Days can’t seem to dethrone the original Snapchat app in the US. But in emerging markets, Facebook still has an opportunity to become leader. \nEver since Snapchat rejected Facebook’s $3 billion buyout offer in 2013, Mark Zuckerberg’s social network has been creating imitations to fight the app’s success. The latest copycat attempt is a standalone app launched in Brazil on Nov. 8 called Flash , which allows people to send ephemeral text and video messages. The app will let you “add fun face masks, draw and send disappearing messages,” Snapchat’s signature features. \nFlash could give Snapchat a run for its money in emerging markets, where users are strapped for data and storage space. The app takes up less than 25 megabytes as opposed to Snapchat, which consumes over 70 MB . It also comes with data saving features like loading media only after a user prompts interest in viewing it, caching media over Wifi when possible, and allowing for an offline mode where “Flashes” will be sent after connectivity is regained. Users will also be able to post through the app even when the internet is patchy or limited. \n“We specifically built Flash to bring a great experience to Android users regardless of their data connection or phone mode,” a Facebook spokesperson told Quartz. Since iPhones aren’t popular in price-sensitive markets beyond the west, debuting on Android— the operating service running the vast majority of the world’s smartphones —was a calculated choice. To gain users who don’t switch out handsets frequently, the app supports most Android devices released in the last four years. An iOS release has not yet been announced. \nLaunching in Brazil first could help the app gain traction by piggybacking on the success of Facebook and WhatsApp in the country. The latter, which Facebook bought in 2014, is king among the messaging apps, with over 100 million users in Brazil.he Menlo Park giant is instead looking to make a mark in places like Brazil, where only 9% of the population uses Snapchat.Flash will roll out to other markets following the test in Brazil. \nFacebook has a long history of going after Snapchat, which boasts 150 million active daily users . Here are some highlights: 2012: Facebook released Poke, only to pull it back over a year later. 2013: Facebook attempted to buy the real deal. Snapchat says no thanks, which looks like a very smart move . 2014: The now-shuttered Slingshot app was based on the same ephemeral technology but users could only unlock their friends’ messages once they sent one back. Aug. 2016: Facebook launched Instagram Stories, a blantant rip off of Snapchat’s stories feature . (At least, it gave credit.) Sept. 2016: Stories for Messenger is introduced. And since these messages last 24 hours, the feature was dubbed Messenger Day . Oct. 2016: Facebook made a failed bid to acquire Snapchat’s Asian doppelgänger, Snow , owned by the creators of popular messaging app Line. Nov. 2016: WhatsApp got its own photo and doodles feature with a 24-hour limit called “Status.” Read full story",

Join the Conversation Mark Hinson, Democrat senior writer 11:22 a.m. EST November 10, 2016 JB Smooth and Keri Hilson mug for a selfie in the comedy “Almost Christmas,” opening Friday. (Photo: NBC Universal) \nNEW THIS WEEK: “Almost Christmas,” “Arrival,” “Shut In” \nThe Accountant \nR, 128 minutes. Profanity, extreme violence. \nBen Affleck, Anna Kendrick. An analyst in the Treasury Department is blackmailed into tracking down a number-cruncher for the underworld and eventually uncovers a solitary CPA with high-functioning autism who happens to be a very good shot. Flashback-heavy action pic directed by Gavin O’Connor (“Jane Got A Gun”), who knows a thing or two about making slick entertainment. The top-shelf supporting cast includes J.K. Simmons, Jeffrey Tambor, John Lithgow, Jean Smart and Jon Bernthal. (B) \nAMC 20 : 1:30, 4:45, 7:45, 10:45 \nGovernor’s Square : 12:55, 4:05, 7, 9:55 \nAlmost Christmas \nPG-13, 112 minutes. Profanity, mild violence, sexual humor, drug use . \nDanny Glover, Gabrielle Union. Bickering, grown siblings spend a long holiday week with their widower dad, who is hiding his plans for selling the family home in Alabama, in this rather predictable ensemble comedy-drama. At times it plays like a warm-fuzzy flick from the Hallmark Channel. But the cast is very game and there a few solid laughs served up with the inevitable burnt casserole. With JB Smoove, Jessie Usher, Kimberly Elise, Mo'Nique, Nicole Ari Parker, Keri Hilson and Omar Epps. Produced by FAMU alum Will Packer. Opened Friday. (B-) \nAMC 20: 10:30 a.m., 11 a.m., 11:45 a.m., 1:15, 2:30, 3, 4:15, 5:15, 7:15, 8:15, 9:30, 10:15, 11 \nGovernor’s Square : 12:25, 3:25, 7:25, 10:20 \nArrival \nPG-13, 116 minutes. Profanity, scary special effects . \nAmy Adams, Jeremy Renner. A linguistics professor is called in by the military to translate the language spoken by aliens who’ve landed some very big spaceships on Earth in this thinking person’s sci-fi pic . Directed by Denis Villeneuve (“Sicario”). With Forest Whitaker and Michael Stuhlbarg. Opened Friday. \nAMC 20 : 10:15 a.m., 11:15 a.m., 1, 1:45, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10, 11 \nGovernor’s Square : 12:40, 3:40, 7:20, 10:10 \nBoo! A Madea Halloween \nPG-13, 103 minutes. Profanity, violence, suggestive humor, scary stuff, drug use . \nTyler Perry, Cassi Davis. An outspoken, no-nonsense matriarch is called in to keep an eye on her 17-year-old niece, who is determined to sneak away to a frat party on Halloween, and spends the night battling clowns and zombies. Horror-comedy written and sloppily directed by Perry, who also plays three roles. It’s a stupid-fun romp if you can ignore the preachy moral message that Perry hammers home. (B-) \nAMC 20 : 10 a.m., 11:30 a.m., 1:45, 2:30, 4:30, 5:30, 7:15, 8:30, 9:45, 11:15 \nGovernor’s Square : 12:45, 4:10, 7:35, 10:10 \nDeepwater Horizon \nPG-13, 107 minutes. Profanity, violence, disturbing images, rumbling drill pipe. \nMark Wahlberg, Kate Hudson. In April 2010, as the mega-corporation BP pushes its employees to work faster on an iffy oil rig in the Gulf of Mexico, a compromised drill pipe explodes and the crew members fight for their lives in the inferno. Director Peter Berg (“The Rundown,” “Hancock”) takes a hyper-realistic, grunt’s-eye view of an epic environmental disaster. With Kurt Russell, Kate Hudson, Trace Adkins, Gina Rodriguez and John Malkovich (trying out an over-boiled Cajun accent). (B-) \nMovies 8: 12:05, 2:25, 4:40, 7:15, 9:45 \nDoctor Strange \nPG-13, 115 minutes. Intense violence, vertigo-inducing special effects . \nBenedict Cumberbatch, Rachel McAdams. After a car crash causes severe nerve damage in his hands, a brilliant and arrogant neurosurgeon heads to the Far East seeking a cure and ends up as a superhero. Marvel Comics-based action pic directed by Scott Derrickson (“The Exorcism of Emily Rose”), who decided to mix the usual Marvel malarkey and overkill with all the special effects from “Inception.” With Chiwetel Ejiofor, Mads Mikkelsen (playing the evil villain, natch), Benedict Wong and Tilda Swinton. (C+) \nAMC 20 : 10 a.m., 10:30 a.m., 11 a.m., 11:30 a.m., noon, 1, 2, 2:30, 3:30, 4, 5, 5:30, 6, 7, 7:30, 8, 8:30, 9, 10, 10:30, 11, 11:15 \nIMAX: 2, 4:30, 7, 9:30 \nGovernor’s Square : 12:30, 1, 3:30, 4, 7, 7:30, 9:55, 10:25 \nThe Girl on the Train \nR, 112 minutes.

      "text": "Discuss: ! \nIf you’ve been anywhere near Facebook or Twitter in the past several months, you’re probably aware that there is a case working its way through the courts that accuses Donald Trump of raping a 13-year-old girl in 1994. \nOn Wednesday, the woman, who remains anonymous, was slated to appear at a press conference with her new attorney, Lisa Bloom, the daughter of Gloria Allred. Bloom wrote a column about the case in The Huffington Post last summer. \nFor months, people have wondered why this case isn’t getting more ― or, really, any ― attention in the press, even now that Trump faces an actual court date: a Dec. 16 status conference with the judge. \nThe allegations aren’t entirely implausible on their face. The accuser says Trump raped her repeatedly at parties thrown by since-convicted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein, who was widely known to throw wild parties with young women and girls. Epstein was convicted in 2008 of soliciting an underage girl for prostitution and served a small portion of an 18-year sentence. \nIn a New York magazine profile of Epstein before he went to prison, and long before Trump ran for president, Trump acknowledged that he knows Epstein. “I’ve known Jeff for fifteen years. Terrific guy,’’ Trump says in the story. “He’s a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side. No doubt about it ― Jeffrey enjoys his social life.” \nThe lawsuit against Trump includes affidavits from two anonymous women who say they were witnesses. Yet there’s been little coverage of the case. As one of the media outlets that has not published much about it, I can say there are two main reasons we shied away. The accuser is anonymous. \nThe accuser in this case is anonymous, and the suit is filed under a pseudonym in New York. A previous case filed in California used the name “Katie Johnson.” To accuse someone in print of forcibly raping a child is about as serious a charge as can be made. To do that with an anonymous accuser would be an extraordinary step, putting the journalist’s reputation on the line. \nOne senior national reporter who has covered both campaigns said that the anonymity was the main stumbling block. “If it’s something that’s this damaging to a candidate, you better be sure, and she’s anonymous,” the reporter said, asking for anonymity to talk openly about the decision-making process. “Look, if she came out and she would do an interview, that would be different, but she’s an anonymous plaintiff.” \nTo go forward with an anonymous source shifts responsibility for the veracity of the claims from the accuser to the reporter. If the person is named and on record, the reporter can argue that he or she is merely reporting what the person is saying, and people are free to believe her or not. But giving anonymity says something different to an audience. It suggests, I, as a journalist, have investigated this person and these charges, and find them sufficiently credible to bring them forward without a name attached. Especially in the wake of the Rolling Stone fiasco, that requires an extreme amount of confidence in the source. \nAnd the way the case rolled out did not inspire that confidence. The accuser’s public backers have been savaged in the press. \nOne of the leading organizers of the effort to get the press to pay attention to this case is Steve Baer, an outspoken Republican donor. Baer last made news when his effort to out an alleged affair between Reps. Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) and Renee Ellmers (R-N.C.) contributed to McCarthy dropping his bid to become House speaker. Baer’s style is to liberally cc and bcc an endless stream of powerful people, and it usually has the effect of getting none of them to listen. \nWhen I wrote to him Monday night, for instance, to say I was going to write a story on why the media were avoiding the child rape story, he replied and cc’ed Washington Post Executive Editor Marty Baron, along with a host of other media figures. \nAnd Baer, in fact, is among the more credible advocates the accuser has going for her. \nThe accuser initially filed the case on her own behalf in California, but it was tossed for not stating an articulable violation of her civil rights. The case has since been refiled in New York, under the representation of a patent lawyer named Thomas Meagher . A patent lawyer handling the case hasn’t inspired the most confidence. (He didn’t respond to a request for comment.) \nThe least credible backer has to be a man who may or may not be named Al Taylor, but is more likely named Norm Lubow, and was apparently a former producer for “The Jerry Springer Show.” \nMedia outlets that have tried to get in touch with Johnson have had extreme difficulty doing so. The Daily Beast did a deep dive into the case and the people supporting the accuser in July, and came to a devastating conclusion: “Far from derailing the Trump train, Katie Johnson and her supporters seem to be in an out-of-control clown car whose wheels just came off,” wrote Brandy Zadrozny. \nThe Guardian and Jezebel also looked into the situation and came up with equally unfavorable takes. A writer who actually talked to Johnson came away confused about what to make of the allegations. It’s unclear if anybody has managed to speak to Tiffany Doe or Joan Doe, the two witnesses cited in the case. “Jezebel, The Guardian and The Daily Beast effectively poisoned the well on Katie’s credibility,” Baer lamented to HuffPost, accurately. \nIf you’re still struggling to understand why the story didn’t get more coverage, imagine for a moment that you’re a reporter thinking about spending weeks looking into it. Then go read the Daily Beast article. Still ready to go down that rabbit hole? \nBut as the reality of the court date increasingly dawns on the press, coupled with Trump’s own admission that he sexually assaults women, the case is getting harder to ignore. Baer said that two media outlets have recently done interviews with Johnson, and stories could pop at any minute. \nErik Wemple, a media reporter at The Washington Post, said he hasn’t talked to many journalists about their decision to shy away from the story. “I can’t cover everything,” he said. “Around the spring, the Washington Post was getting hammered for assigning two dozen reporters to investigate Trump. I wrote a piece wondering whether that was anywhere near enough. It wasn’t, as it turns out.” \nIn some ways, given the role of Facebook in disseminating news, it matters less this cycle than any other previous one that the media have largely ignored the case. Open platforms, too, have helped the story circulate. The story that Bloom published on HuffPost’s contributor platform has been shared on Facebook 140,000 times. The piece has been viewed 5,221,475 times since June. \nWith Bloom’s planned press conference on Wednesday, things might have changed. \nBut Johnson’s appearance was canceled at the last minute because Bloom said her client had received threats and was afraid of appearing in public.

      "text": "Just because you’ve sworn off Facebook doesn’t mean you can’t take advantage of all Messenger has to offer! These simple steps will have you using Messenger in no time at all, without starting a Facebook account. Why Use Messenger? \nFacebook Messenger is now one of the biggest messaging platforms worldwide, with over 900 million users worldwide. \nMuch of the app’s popularity comes from Facebook’s ongoing insistence that it be a separate app (you can now no longer access messages through the Facebook mobile site). So, one motivation for using Messenger is that it’s highly likely most of your friends are using it as well! \nIf that’s not enough to convince you, Messenger is also evolving far beyond just another way to chat with your friends. In fact, recent updates and upgrades to Messenger 21 Hidden Facebook Messenger Tricks You Need To Try Right Now 21 Hidden Facebook Messenger Tricks You Need To Try Right Now Facebook and various partner apps are making Messenger even more powerful, and there are now dozens of really interesting things you can do directly from Messenger itself. Take a look at these! Read More are making it obvious that it is slowly becoming a powerful multipurpose app. \nSeriously, you want to order an Uber? Messenger. Need to make a voice or video call? Messenger. Want to play a game against your friends? Messenger. And don’t even get me started on all the different ways the app allows you to send GIFs, stickers, photos, or edited images to your friends. \nAs well, a recent update now allows you to encrypt your Messenger conversations You Can Now Enjoy Secret Facebook Messenger Conversations You Can Now Enjoy Secret Facebook Messenger Conversations Facebook now lets you encrypt all of your Facebook Messenger conversations. Once enabled, you can enjoy Secret Conversations safe in the knowledge nobody else is listening in. Read More . End-to-end encryption guarantees that no one other than you and the other people included in a message can read what you say. This update brings the app’s security on par with other popular messaging services such as WhatsApp. Why Avoid Facebook? \nThere are a lot of legitimate reasons that many people choose not to use Facebook. \nFor starters, many people are frustrated by Facebook staples 5 Things People Do On Facebook That Drive Me Crazy 5 Things People Do On Facebook That Drive Me Crazy How does one fall victim to Facebook fatigue?

Read More like pyramid schemes, political debates, and pointless status updates. For these users, there’s no point in using a social media site that fills them with rage! \nOthers just aren’t interested in keeping up with friends online. These users would rather catch up over a cup of coffee or on the phone instead of through liking each other’s perfect social media posts. \nBeyond these concerns, security concerns have plagued Facebook users for years. Facebook is now one of the primary ways to register for several services online and your data are constantly tracked It Doesn't Matter If You're Not On Facebook: They're Still Tracking You It Doesn't Matter If You're Not On Facebook: They're Still Tracking You A new report claims the Facebook is tracking people without their permission. It doesn't matter if you don't use social networking service: they're still watching you. What can you do about it? Read More . Those who want to protect their privacy and limit the amount of information available about them online may also refuse to open a Facebook account. Downloading Messenger Without a Facebook Account \nSo, if you don’t have Facebook, how on earth are you supposed to use Facebook Messenger? \nThankfully, the process is easier than you may think. First, go to the App store for your brand of phone and download the Messenger app. Once you download it to your phone, open the app. \nWhen you open the app for the first time, you will see a screen that offers you two choices. You can choose to “Sign in with Facebook” or “Continue with phone number”. \nSelect “Continue with phone number”. You will be asked to confirm that you want to continue without using an existing Facebook account. \nNext, you are prompted to enter your phone number, and are then texted a confirmation code. \nOnce you confirm this code, you are asked to enter your name so that people can find you on the app. Once this is done, you’re ready to begin using Messenger! Setting Up Messenger Without a Facebook Account \nAfter you activate your account there are still a few settings to finalize! \nFirst, Messenger prompts you to upload a photo of yourself so that other users can recognize you. \nNext, it asks if you want to add your contacts to Messenger. If you grant the app these permissions it will continuously access your contacts and automatically add them to your Messenger address book. \nIf you choose not to automate this process, you can still add your contacts one-by-one to your Messenger account. This can be done by searching for their phone number (if they have their phone associated with their Messenger) or entering their name into the ‘To’ field. You may have to search through several profiles before finding the person you’re looking for! This Isn’t to Say That Messenger Is Perfect \nMessenger is becoming a pretty great app, but it still isn’t perfect. \nMany users find that the app uses a significant amount of battery power. In fact, this effect is so obvious that Facebook actually released an app called Messenger Lite Facebook Messenger Lite Is the App We've All Been Waiting For Facebook Messenger Lite Is the App We've All Been Waiting For If your Android smartphone is running slow or running out of battery too quickly, one app might be to blame: Messenger.

We don't have any other alternates lined up, so I figured I'd heck over here. You'd be starting in the third tier (of four) with a record of 2-3. Format for the current season is BEHF. Here are the league rules: https://docs.google.com/document/d/15i4Wqr4y-AA03SW9kPUu7Z0j... Let me know if you'd be willing to step in!",

      "text": "Boston Public Library, Wikimedia Commons // CC BY 2.0 Like us on Facebook \nIn 1816, local legend has it that a ship dropped off an unknown couple in Alexandria, Virginia. The woman was extremely ill, possibly from typhoid fever, and couldn’t wait until their final destination to receive medical attention. \nAlas, it was too late; she died a few weeks later while boarding at Gadsby’s Tavern. No one had spoken to her or, some say, even seen her face—any time anyone saw her, her features were hidden by a long, black veil. Her husband quickly arranged for a burial at St. Paul’s Cemetery, then borrowed money for a headstone from a local merchant named Lawrence Hill. \nUnder the circumstances, you might think the mysterious man would keep the epitaph simple, resulting in a more affordable stone and a smaller loan to repay. Instead, he went the opposite route, having a huge marker etched with this wordy tribute: \n“To the memory of a Female Stranger, whose mortal sufferings terminated on the 14th day of October, 1816 Aged 23 years and 8 months. This stone is placed here by her disconsolate husband in whose arms she sighed out her latest breath, and who under God did his utmost even to soothe the cold dead ear of death.\" \nIt was followed by some verses adapted from Alexander Pope and a Bible quote, adding even more to the bill. The man spared no expense, and it’s no wonder—he apparently had no intention of paying back the loan. The female stranger’s husband skipped town without paying doctor bills, lodging bills, or funeral and burial fees (he did leave behind some currency, but it was forged). And when he left, he took more than his wallet with him—he also took his wife’s identity. \nRumors ran rampant, even 70 years later: In 1886, the Lawrence Gazette reported on several theories, including the popular notion that the woman was really Theodosia Burr Alston , the daughter of Aaron Burr. Alston had been lost at sea around 1812, but conspiracy theorists speculated that she faked her disappearance to escape a loveless marriage. “Why the stranger’s husband would permit no one to see her face after she was dead gives rise to the supposition that he may have feared its recognition by those who looked upon it,” the Gazette said. \nOutlandish? Perhaps. But even more so is the tale that the woman was actually a man—Napoleon Bonaparte dressed in drag, to be exact, attempting to escape his exile. \nYet another story declared the woman was named Blanche Fordan, and the man claiming to be her husband had actually hypnotized her into marrying him, though she really loved another. \nSadly, if you're looking for answers, you're going to be disappointed—we still don't have any. The female stranger remains as mysterious today as she was 200 years ago, although her grave has since become a local tourist attraction. More from mental_floss...",

      "text": "‘Crazy’ to say Facebook helped Trump win – Zuckerberg   5:06 am \nFacing criticism that fake news on Facebook aided the rise of Donald Trump, founder Mark Zuckerberg has strongly defended his network. \nSpeaking on stage at Techonomy, a technology conference in California, Mr Zuckerberg said Facebook should not be held responsible. \n“The idea that fake news on Facebook influenced the election in any way is a pretty crazy idea,” he said. \n“If you believe that then I don’t think you have internalized the message Trump supporters are trying to send in this election.” \nSome data has shown that fake stories were being far more widely shared on the platform than follow up stories debunking the claims. \nFor an increasing number of people, particularly Americans, Facebook is becoming the primary source of news coverage. \nThe site’s News Feed is specifically designed to show users content it thinks will be of most interest, creating what some describe as a “filter bubble” that reinforces a person’s view without injecting differences in opinion. \n‘Work to do’ \nEarlier this year, Facebook was accused of being anti-Trump after it was alleged its human moderators were favouring liberal stories from appearing in people’s “trending stories” box. \nWhile denying that claim, the site did sack its human team, instead relying solely on an algorithm to determine which stories were shown to be most popular. \nAs a consequence, stories which were later proved entirely false appeared on the timelines of a large number of users. \nWhen asked about checks and balances needed to keep a company like Facebook in line, Mr Zuckerberg said it was about “listening to what people want”. \n“My goal, and what I care about, is giving people the power to share so we can make the world more open and connected. That requires building a good version of News Feed. We still have work to do on that. We’re going to keep improving it. \n“On the community guidelines, I think as norms change and people want to see more news, I think we’ll have to continue to evolve the guidelines to reflect the value that the community holds.” \nAt the same event, Mr Zuckerberg offered an optimistic view of Mr Trump’s presidency, saying that his goals of improving global healthcare and connectivity did not necessarily require the co-operation of government. \n–",

      "text": "The Electric Porsche Needs to Roar “Our customers are very emotional about sound.” Share on Facebook \nIn his years overseeing the development of Porsche’s Cayman and Boxster two-seaters, Stefan Weckbach never faced a hurdle like the one he encountered when shepherding the company’s first all-electric car to market: acoustics. Electric vehicles, it seems, may be too quiet to be considered Porsches. “Our customers are very emotional about sound,” says Weckbach, the chief of the brand’s push to introduce an electric sedan in 2019. “They told us, ‘We like the growl of your engines, and we expect something similar for an electric.’ ” \nFor the past two years, Weckbach has led a team of about 30 developing the Mission E, a four-door sedan that looks something like a scaled-down Panamera. That team—each member with a specialization such as design, logistics, or finance—can dip into Porsche’s pool of thousands of experts who deal with challenges ranging from the arcane (the strength of the door hinges) to the fundamental (will a model be a roadster or ­sport-utility vehicle?). Courtesy: Porsche \nPorsche’s effort comes as the industry starts to pay more attention to electrics and the European Union prepares rules to go into effect in 2020 that dramatically tighten limits on carbon dioxide emissions. Mercedes-Benz has created a new brand, EQ, for its zero-emission cars. Audi, Porsche’s sister brand at Volkswagen, is planning a battery-powered SUV in 2018 and at least two more electrics by 2020. BMW, which launched its electric i3 city car in 2013, is preparing an electric SUV and a Mini. And Tesla has seen strong sales of its $65,000-plus Model S and plans to start selling the $35,000 Model 3 next year. \nBy 2020 global sales of battery-powered vehicles will quadruple to more than 1.2 million, according to researcher LMC Automotive. “The whole industry is turning toward electric mobility, and Porsche has to be there, too,” says Stefan Bratzel, an auto industry researcher at the University of Applied Sciences in Bergisch Gladbach, Germany. \nPorsche has budgeted about €1 billion ($1.1 billion) for the Mission E, including a new paint shop and assembly hall under construction near the factory in Stuttgart where it makes the 911 and Boxster. The company says it will hire 1,400 people to design, market, and build the car, with most of those coming on board in 2018 as production tests gear up. The next model in the lineup hasn’t been determined, but it will likely be announced well before the Mission E hits the market. “We want to epitomize the sports car of the future,” says Porsche Chief Executive Officer Oliver Blume.

Few other carmakers have a following as loyal as Porsche’s, and die-hard fans of the 911 have squirmed as their beloved brand has added SUVs that fit better in the supermarket parking lot than on the speedway. Still, the breadth of Porsche’s portfolio gives it enough room to accommodate electrics without tearing the brand’s fabric. Sure, the squat 911, with its engine shoehorned into the back, remains the company’s most recognizable product, but SUVs have accounted for the bulk of Porsche’s sales since 2011. “It’s about how you can transform the brand while keeping the core values alive,” says Commerzbank analyst Sascha Gommel.

Photographer: Jasper Juinen \nWhile Porsche has been building electric prototypes for the better part of a decade—and founder Ferdinand Porsche developed an electric in 1898 that looked like a horseless carriage—the current effort began in earnest in 2014. Toward the end of that year, Weckbach started assembling his team, which had been given an almost impossible task: prepare a drivable prototype for the Frankfurt International Auto Show in September 2015. Porsche’s designers had been sketching ideas for several months, and Matthias Müller—Porsche’s CEO at the time and now head of Volkswagen Group—had decreed that the first car would be a sedan. “The traditionalists wouldn’t be ready for a real electric sports car,” says Jürgen Pieper, an analyst at Bankhaus Metzler in Frankfurt. \nThe designers had to be coaxed back to reality in terms of what was achievable, Weckbach says. With no engine up front (electrics typically use motors attached directly to the wheels or axles), the car could have a very low front end—just not as low as the designers wanted, because various components needed to sit in front of the passenger compartment. “At times, we were literally fighting over millimeters,” Weckbach recalls. Courtesy: Porsche \nToday, Weckbach’s team is testing a handful of prototypes across Europe, though they’re disguised as other models, and the company has eight electrics using the bodies of the Boxster and Cayman. More than 100 people at the company have checked them out for a cruise, and after 100,000 miles on the road, those cars have provided insights into how drivers use them. The most salient points—range anxiety and impatience with charging—have formed the basis of Porsche’s e-car push. If they can’t go at least 300 miles on a single charge and take longer than 15 minutes to refuel, consumers will resist buying them. Early models, with 10-hour charging times, stayed close to home, says engineer Patrick Fuchs. With recharging now down to 20 minutes, “we see them going much farther, even into France.” \nThe speedy charging is due to what Porsche says is a key advantage of its car: an 800-volt battery pack, vs. the 400 volts that’s become the industry standard. Porsche’s technology will let customers top up their batteries to 80 percent—for a range of about 250 miles—in 15 minutes, Porsche says. And the lighter cables required for the system have allowed the company to trim about 50 pounds from the car, which can further boost its range. With 600 horsepower, 0-62 mph acceleration in 3.5 seconds, and a top speed of about 150 mph, the car “will be a real Porsche,” Weckbach says. Courtesy: Porsche \nA real Porsche in everything but the growl. Weckbach says in early trials, customers groused about how quiet the car was. With no pistons firing, rattles and squeaks that otherwise might go unnoticed will be heard—which has spurred Weckbach’s team to look for ways to more firmly anchor cables and seal the passenger compartment to keep out previously inaudible wind and tire noise. And they’ve been flirting with ways to make the car louder, either with a recorded sound heard in the cabin but not outside or an amplification of the high-pitched humming of the electric motors. When the car was first shown in Frankfurt, he says, die-hard Porsche fans had another suggestion to overcome any such problems. “A lot of people told us, ‘I like it,’ ” Weckbach says, “ ‘but can I get it with a V8 engine?’ ” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

      "text": "11/11/16 AT 2:57 AM Close \nMark Zuckerberg strongly defended Facebook on Thursday after the social networking site faced criticism saying it helped in the rise of Donald Trump. Zuckerberg called the claims \"crazy\" after the Republican candidate was elected President of the United States. \nZuckerberg spoke out about the criticism while on stage at Techonomy, a technology conference in California, saying that Facebook should not be held responsible. \n\"The idea that fake news on Facebook influenced the election in any way is a pretty crazy idea,\" he said, according to BBC . \"If you believe that then I don't think you have internalized the message Trump supporters are trying to send in this election.\" \nFake stories on Facebook were being far more widely shared than follow up stories debunking the claims, according to some data. \nOver the last few months, Facebook's News Feed, which is designed to show users content it thinks will be of most interest and are trending at the time, has become a primary source of news circulation. \nEarlier this year, Facebook was accused of being anti-Trump when rumors surfaced that its human moderators were favoring liberal stories to appear in people's \"trending stories\" column. \nFollowing this, the platform removed its human team, instead using an algorithm to determine which stories were shown to be most popular, despite denying the allegations. \nDuring the conference, Zuckerberg was asked about checks and balances that are needed to keep a company like Facebook in line.

That requires building a good version of News Feed. We still have work to do on that. We’re going to keep improving it,\" Zuckerberg said. \"On the community guidelines, I think as norms change and people want to see more news, I think we'll have to continue to evolve the guidelines to reflect the value that the community holds.\" \nWhen asked if Facebook had a hint that Trump would win or that it knew about how influential the business mogul is with his supporters, Zuckerberg denied they could have predicted the same. \n“There’s not really a way that a company like ours would happen to know something like that. We could do that, but so could someone else,” he pointed out. \nAt the same event, Zuckerberg said that he was optimistic about Trump's presidency.

      "text": "#GiveUsOurPagesBack this hashtag has been trending on Facebook and elsewhere for more than a week. And for the right reasons. Facebook has unpublished over 3000 Fan pages or business pages for a very generic reason. What Is the Main Reason for Un-Publishing Facebook Pages : eAskme Hundreds of millions of fan base are directly affected with no prior warning or reasoning or even a person to talk to on the issue. Yes, Facebook does give fan pages an option to appeal, but what you receive is a computer generated areply. In some cases, the appeal button itself is not working. There is never an actual person to talk to! Till date Facebook has not issued any official statement regarding their unnecessary action nor replied to any appeal . Page admins started this hashtag in order to generate a response from the company, but to no avail. Some have staged to revolt a little differently : Facebook so far – This had always been a platform where your mom and dad and everyone you went to school with are on. Above all, you could even find that person you had been trying to avoid all your life. It was and is a platform where bad videos and opinions were promoted at length. Pretty bland. Interestingly, a couple of years ago odd pages sprang up on this platform churning out humor on every conceivable topic. And the face of Facebook transformed from a place where relatives post bad videos and racist opinion to the one where some of the funniest and dumbest concepts are born. Noticeably from then on new profiles on Facebook skyrocketed and people started spending more time sharing and liking these humorous content. Facebook became ubiquitous to internet users.

Users started viewing and sharing more of these posts and less from publishers. Gradually marketers realized the value of the contents as one of the easiest ways to humanize their products, gain attention and brand their company. With a huge organic results and user interaction, why is Facebook un-publishing these pages? With hundreds of users asking the same questions, the reasons has not been disclosed officially. Though some social media experts are of the opinion that Facebook is trying to regain lost revenue on Facebook ads or it could be a system glitch. Then again there are different viewpoints being thrown in. read some of them below. - This is what must have happened. This platform is free for the users but funded by the value it brings to them. According to Facebook’s stats, a normal user views approx. 300 posts per day but atleast 15000 posts are generated and shared on a daily basis. Thus Facebook shows particular user posts related to the most liked, shared or commented by that user. Primarily this happens to be the meme and other humorous content. Thus there was always a fight for audience attention and creative; insightful content is simply left behind.

Hence Facebook is losing out on revenue via Facebook ads. Unpublishing pages might be a way to show more sponsored ads to users thus making paid marketing a success! read more : Facebook is Updating Notes for The Long Term in Content Publishing If this is the case, Facebook should come up with a better method of tackling this issue than un-publishing pages without any reason or notice. - Facebook may be facing a system glitch which is probably showing a particular page as a spam or posting objectionable content. - On the other hand,Mashable has been thinking from the perspective of a publisher. According to them, the news feed changes may spell trouble for the publishers. - However, the most genuine reason we found is‘wrong advertisement’. So if a fan page abides by all the terms laid down by Facebook but advertises adult content will be unpublished. Fair enough, I guess. Conclusion – Nothing much to conclude here, just that these social platforms derives its value from their users. If they frustrate these users the platforms very existence may get compromised. Least Facebook can do is answer questions and remove doubts. What do you think, is Facebook right in un-publishing pages as per will without justifying reasons or even giving a warning?

      "text": "(Picture: Getty Images) While many of us will be wearing a poppy on our lapels today, there’s also a way of adding a poppy to your profile photograph on Facebook and Twitter. \nTo mark your respect for those who died during the First World War and World War II online as well as in person, you need to go to the Twibbon page.\nTwibbon will add a #remembrancedaypoppy to the bottom right side of your profile photograph on Facebook and Twitter.\nAll you need to do is visit the page and click ‘add to Twitter’ or ‘add to Facebook’.\n\nThis will take you to a pop-up window where you can upload your profile picture with the poppy automatically showing.\n\nAt this point you can then choose to ‘Add the Twibbon’ but also decide whether or not to add it along with a message of support encouraging others to do the same.\nThis is displayed in the tick-box option on the right hand side of the window.\nTo donate, which really you should do if displaying a poppy on your social media profile, visit the British Royal Legion website .\nMORE: Remembrance Day poems and quotes to pay tribute to Britain’s war dead \nMORE: How to wear a Remembrance Day poppy: Why a poppy should be worn on the left side ",

      "text": "– Facebook founder, Mark Zuckerberg has addressed some rumours surrounding his business \n– Facebook is facing criticism that fake news on Facebook aided the rise of Donald Trump \n– Zuckerberg has strongly defended his network \nFacebook founder, Mark Zuckerberg has addressed criticisms that fake news on Facebook aided the rise of the United States of America President-elect, Donald Trump. Zuckerberg absolves Facebook of any blame as regars Trump victory \nZuckerberg who addressed the issue while speaking at a technology conference in California, said Facebook should not be held responsible. \nHis words: “The idea that fake news on Facebook influenced the election in any way is a pretty crazy idea. \n“If you believe that then I don’t think you have internalised the message Trump supporters are trying to send in this election.” \nHe continued: “My goal, and what I care about, is giving people the power to share so we can make the world more open and connected. That requires building a good version of News Feed. We still have work to do on that. We’re going to keep improving it. \n“On the community guidelines, I think as norms change and people want to see more news, I think we’ll have to continue to evolve the guidelines to reflect the value that the community holds.” \nAccording to the BBC, some data has shown that fake stories were being far more widely shared on the platform than follow up stories debunking the claims. \nFor an increasing number of people, particularly Americans, Facebook is becoming the primary source of news coverage. \nThe site’s News Feed is specifically designed to show users content it thinks will be of most interest, creating what some describe as a “filter bubble” that reinforces a person’s view without injecting differences in opinion. \nInterestingly, earlier this year, Facebook was accused of being anti-Trump after it was alleged its human moderators were favouring liberal stories appearing in people’s “trending stories” box. \nWhile denying that claim, the site did sack its human team, instead relying solely on an algorithm to determine which stories were shown to be most popular. \nAs a consequence, stories which were later proved entirely false appeared on the timelines of a large number of users. \nSix months ago, Zuckerberg attacked Trump’s stance on immigration in a speech about Facebook’s future.",

      "title": "Zuckerberg: Fake News Didn’t Influence Election Results",
      "text": "A lot of questions are emerging about Facebook’s role in this year’s election cycle, especially given the proliferation of sensationalistic and even outright fake news stories, and CEO Mark Zuckerberg has responded.\n“I think the idea that fake news on Facebook—of which it’s a very small amount of the content—influenced the election in any way is a pretty crazy idea,” he said on Thursday at the Techonomy conference in Half Moon Bay, Calif., just two days after Donald Trump was elected president, according to media reports .\n“There have been hoaxes on the Internet, there were hoaxes before,” he said. “We do our best to make it so that people can report that, and as I said before, we can show people the most meaningful content we can.”\nTrump’s victory in the U.S. presidential election stunned many, including polling analysts and the media. Since then, many questions about the role of social media—and mass media at large—have been swirling.\nFacebook [fortune-stock symbol=”fb”], in particular, has grown into a powerful tool for sharing information and news articles—or what looks like news articles. In a recent report, BuzzFeed detailed how a slew of teens in Macedonia have been creating entire operations of pushing fake, but very dramatic, news onto the social network, which uses algorithms to decide what each user sees in their News Feeds.\nThus, the argument is that services like Facebook are enabling the viral spread of these faux news articles, and some are asking whether it may have had a significant effect on the election’s outcome. Read more in Fortune ‘s Mathew Ingram’s take on why Facebook is partly to blame here .\n“Part of what I think is going on here is people are trying to understand the results of the election,” Zuckerberg said. “I think there is a certain profound lack of empathy in asserting that the only reason why someone could have voted the way they did is because they saw some fake news.”\nOf course, Facebook is sticking to its guns. The social network giant has vehemently denied that it’s a media company, insisting that it’s merely an open technology platform enabling people to connect with each other and share information.\nFacebook also argues that its users are exposed to a variety of viewpoints through the service, despite criticism that it’s an echo chamber for each user to have their viewpoints reinforced over and over again. But even Zuckerberg has acknowledged that people don’t tend to click on articles promoting viewpoints different from their own, which only supports the idea of an online echo chamber. And therefore, fewer of those tend to show up in your News Feed.\n\nThat’s also where Zuckerberg is both right and wrong. Fake news articles did play a role, but in reaffirming or confirming what people want to believe; probably not so much in swaying most users’ pre-existing beliefs to the point that they entirely changed their minds.\nWith that said, Zuckerberg’s comments shouldn’t be surprising at all. Even if the company has come to believe its News Feed has had some effect, why would it possibly want to acknowledge that in public?\nDoing so would only open the door even louder to calls for Facebook to start regulating the information on its network, and the company has no interest in getting into that messy game. Even when it tried to hire young employees to flag popular news items and write short descriptions of the stories, it was quickly confronted with accusations of bias against right-wing media , and dismantled the entire operation to replace it with algorithms.\nEditorial judgement is difficult and carries risks—just ask any member of the media.",

      "text": "Reddit \nWith live video streaming now a standard feature on platforms like Facebook, Twitter and YouTube, it was only a matter of time before Instagram joined in. CEO Kevin Systrom has now told the Financial Times (via Engadget ) that it will be adding live streaming to the app. Live is really exciting for us. I think it can enhance what we’re doing. If I’m trying to strengthen relationships with someone I love, them streaming video to me live would be an amazing way to be closer to them. \nThe feature first leaked on Russian site T Journal when a reader noticed a non-functional icon appearing in an update, seemingly by mistake … \nThe icon, marked Live , appeared alongside a row of Instagram Stories. Broadcasting appears set to be activated by selecting the option from the camera screen. \nAs well as bringing a sense of immediacy to sharing experiences with family and friends, live broadcasting has also proven a valuable tool for citizen journalism and providing a degree of reassurance to those who find themselves in threatening situations. \nSystrom gave no indication of when the feature will be added to the app, but it looks set to appear sooner rather than later. \nAn Instagram update just yesterday added a built-in Boomerang mode – stitching together a burst of photos into a video – as well as mentions within Stories. Previous updates added recommended Stories , the ability to save drafts and pinch-to-zoom . Guides",

(Photo: Nick Oza/The Republic) \nIt was 1943. Frank Sinatra and the Glenn Miller Orchestra were on the radio. Gas was 15 cents a gallon. A Coca-Cola was a nickel. \nThat summer, Allied forces invaded Italy, overthrowing its dictator, Benito Mussolini. America took control of Guadalcanal and experienced its first rationing of meat, cheese, butter and shoes. The All-American Girls Professional Baseball League took the field. \nAnd the new Marine Corps Women's Reserve was starting to fill its ranks. \nBettie Lerdall was working as a secretary in Oakland for the Southern Pacific Railroad and still living at home. She worked with her mother, riding back and forth to the office together, making dinner every night. \nVivian Wood was a newspaper reporter in Belle Center, Ohio, writing about the kind of things that make news in a small village. The biggest scoop was if someone was murdered, though it didn’t happen often, not with just 500 residents. \nBettie was 19. In California, she yearned for more: “Let me out of here,\" she thought. \"There are better things for me.” \nVivian had just turned 20. In Ohio, she felt felt like she was missing out: “I want to get out and see the world.” 'We could be anything' \nI grew up on military bases, and as a kid, I’d skid to a stop on my bike to watch platoons of Marines running in formation. \nI’d stand on my pedals to count the WMs — the women Marines — among them. \nI was among the first wave of girls whose parents told us we could be anything we wanted — and they actually believed it. \nCareer Day at school included women pilots, engineers, lawyers and once, even a sniper. \nNo one ever told me I couldn’t do something because I was a girl. \nMy dad opened car doors for me, but he also taught his left-handed daughter to throw right-handed, how to drive a stick shift and shoot a gun. \nMy mom says I was so driven she had only to get out of the way. \nCareer Day at school included women pilots, engineers, lawyers and once, even a sniper. \nNo one ever told me I couldn’t do something because I was a girl. After a rough election, looking for the good because we know it's there Joining the Marines \nIt was different in 1943. In what was an extraordinary leap for a woman at that time, Bettie decided she would join the Marine Corps. \nEven at 20, the minimum age for women to join the Marine Corps, the young women had to have permission from their parents. \nBettie’s parents were divorced, and her father was in the Navy and away at the time. Her mother thought it was a terrible idea. She was sure her daughter would hate having someone tell her what to do, where to live and what to wear, a uniform in particular. Scottsdale's Veterans Day commemoration \nBob Parsons, a decorated U.S. Marine Corps Vietnam veteran and founder of GoDaddy, will speak, along with Rep. David Schweiker and U.S. Air Force veteran and Scottsdale historian Joan Fudala. There will be music from the 108th Army Band and refreshments from Shamrock Foods Co. and the Wildflower Bread Co. \nWhen: 3 p.m. Friday, Nov. 11 \nWhere: McCormick-Stillman Railroad Park, 7301 E. Indian Bend Road, Scottsdale \nCost: Free \nDetails: 480-312-2312, www.scottsdaleaz.gov/events \nBut Bettie was determined. She wished to serve. She wanted to do something for the war effort. \nBettie convinced her mother to sign. She enlisted on July 21, 1942, her 20th birthday. \nVivian hadn’t intended to enlist at all. She accompanied a girlfriend to a military recruiting station. The friend was interested in the Women's Army Corps, or WAC, the women's branch of the U.S. Army. \nThe Marine recruiter there told Vivian she should consider joining the Corps. “The green uniform would look good with your red hair,” he told her. \nShe considered it. Like Bettie, like most people she know, Vivian wanted to do something for the war. She enlisted on Aug. 3, 1943. \nThat year, the first for the Marine Corps Women's Reserve, there were fewer than 200 women serving. They worked as mechanics, clerks and drill instructors, freeing up male Marines to go overseas. Their ranks would grow to more than 20,000 by war’s end. Prudy and Woodie, in training \nBettie Lerdall (left) and Vivian Wood were sent for training to Camp Lejeune in Jacksonville, N.C. They never crossed paths. (Photo: Nick Oza/The Republic) \nBoth women were sent for training to Camp Lejeune in Jacksonville, N.C. They never crossed paths. \nThe summer heat was miserable, a terrible time for rigorous physical training. \nBettie was 5-foot-8, and an athlete in high school, playing field hockey, baseball and basketball. \nVivian was 5-foot-4, and while she wasn’t an athlete, she was strong from working on her parents’ farm in Kenton, Ohio. \nThe drill instructors were women, too, except for one hour a day when a male drill instructor took charge. \nThey were pretty tough, these male drill instructors, Bettie came to realize. \nVivian would always remember one in particular. He liked to have the women stand at attention while the mosquitos were thick. He liked to tease. \nBettie’s last name then was Pruden, so the other WMs called her “Prudy.” Vivian was “Woodie.” The uniforms and the catcalls \nThe uniform Bettie’s mother had warned her about turned out not to be so bad. She liked not having to choose an outfit every day. \nThe WMs wore fitted jackets and crisp skirts. It was sharp. She didn’t feel sloppy. \nIn winter, the uniforms were forest green wool. In summer a green and white striped seersucker. Marine vet quits his job over 'Semper Fi' tattoo, finds his truer calling at a VA hospital \nEach morning, Vivian had to pull on an uncomfortable girdle and unbecoming lisle hose. \nEven in those outfits, and with their hair cut short — it could be no longer than the bottom edge of their shirt collar — the WMs attracted attention. The men and women lived separately on base, but when the women were on their way to eat or to go to the theater, men would sometimes call out. \n“BAM!” they would holler. Big-ass Marine . The memory would always make Bettie giggle. \nBoth women dated Marines, though nothing too serious. Team Red White and Blue encourages veterans to keep a healthy, social lifestyle \nStill, Vivian could tell not everyone was happy they were there. There was some resentment of the women joining the Corps, she saw, and would tell herself and others later that it was still such a macho organization. \nAt the end of training, Bettie stayed put in Camp Lejeune, put in charge of her platoon and then made a drill instructor. \nAt inspection, she would tap the women standing at attention with her swagger stick to make sure they hadn’t forgone their girdles. She got 40 to 45 new recruits every six weeks. Bettie was firm but fair. \nVivian was transferred to Camp Pendleton in San Diego, where she worked as the acting personnel Sergeant Major of the women’s battalion. The female officers she worked for had college degrees; it sparked something in the young woman. She was growing aware that women could — and did — do important jobs. After the war, Bettie \n“We were part of something bigger than ourselves,” says Bettie Lerdall of the Marine Corps Women's Reserve. (Photo: Nick Oza/The Republic, azcentral.com) \nBettie and Vivian were honorably discharged as Marines returned from overseas to reclaim their jobs. \nBettie was a platoon sergeant until December 1945, having served her entire stint at Camp Lejeune. After she left, she went to the University of California-Berkeley on the GI Bill and then was hired as a secretary by the State Department Foreign Service. \nHer first assignment was in Karachi, Pakistan, where she met and married her husband, Sgt. William Lerdall, an Air Force man. \n(“Traitor,” Vivian would say on a morning many years later when they got together to chat. They both laughed.) \nBettie and her husband came back to the States for a few years and then were stationed in Cairo, Egypt, with their 6-week-old baby and a 2-year-old. They would travel the world, having four children in all. Her husband retired after 21 years to Phoenix, which they chose because they wanted somewhere warm. \nWilliam passed away 24 years ago, and Bettie lives on her own in Mesa. She golfed for years until her back got bad. Now a grandmother of six, she leads a Bible study class. \nShe still talks about what it was like to return to civilian life. She liked the routine and the responsibility. Her friends' concerns about finding rationed butter and sugar seemed inconsequential. \n“When you’re first discharged, and you go home, you’re just lost,” Bettie says. \nShe loved being a Marine. \"I would go in today if they’d take me.” After the war, Vivian \n\"I still feel proud of being a Marine,” says Vivian Wood of her time in the Marine Corps Women's Reserve during World War II. (Photo: Nick Oza/The Republic) \nVivian served at Camp Pendleton until Dec. 6, 1945. \nShe tried to get into the University of Chicago after the Marine Corps, but the campus was overrun with soldiers returning from the war. So she worked at a farm journal in Philadelphia, taking classes at night until she was admitted. She earned two degrees, a bachelor's degree in liberal arts and a master's degree in sociology. \nShe taught in California and then return to the University of Chicago to earn her doctoral degree in Human Development. She then was on the faculty of the University of Wisconsin-Madison for 24 years, teaching and doing research in gerontology. She never married. \nWhen she retired in 1987, Vivian moved to Sun City, one of the communities she examined as part of a study. \nHer retirement has been busy, working on the women's build team at Habitat for Humanity and teaching English as a second language at Dysart Community Center. She assembles survival bags for the homeless, exercises three times a week, volunteers at the library and never misses happy hour on Friday night. Bettie and Vivian, together \nBettie and Vivian never crossed paths while they were in the Marine Corps. They met about 10 years ago at a reunion of the Women Marines Association. Both women are now involved in the Marine Corps Scholarship Foundation, another non-profit group. \nThey laugh a lot when they get together and talk about their stories. \n“I never drank, and I never smoked,” Bettie says. She's 93 now. \n“I always drank, but I never smoked,” Vivian says. She's 94. They both laugh. \nThey agree that those years in the Marine Corps influenced the kind of women they became. They learned discipline, respect and how to get along with all sorts of people. \nThey learned to be strong and independent. “It certainly gave me a sense of pride,” Vivian says. “I could see what women could do. I learned I could take care of myself.\" \nThey both still respond with \"Yes, ma'am\" and \"No, sir.\" They believe in the power of a firm handshake. \nThey agree that those years in the Marine Corps influenced the kind of women they became.

I learned I could take care of myself.\" \nIf Bettie meets someone with a weak grip, she doesn't let go. \"What are you doing?\" she asks. \"That’s not a handshake!\" She makes them do it again. Bettie laughs: \"I'm still a drill sergeant.\" \nVivian laughs, too: “Once a Marine, always a Marine.” \nThey are the few — estimates are that there are fewer than 5,000 women Marines from that era — and the proud. \nVivian and Bettie will attend Friday's Veterans Day commemoration at McCormick-Stillman Railroad Park in Scottsdale. \n\"I still feel proud of being a Marine,” Vivian says. \nBettie nodded.

      "title": "Mark Zuckerberg Says Fake News on Facebook Affecting the Election Is a 'Crazy Idea'",
      "text": "  @10:10AM from the hoaxes-on-facebook dept. A lot of questions are emerging about Facebook's role in this year's election cycle, especially given the proliferation of sensationalistic and even outright fake news stories , and CEO Mark Zuckerberg has responded. From a report on Fortune: \"I think the idea that fake news on Facebook -- of which it's a very small amount of the content -- influenced the election in any way is a pretty crazy idea ,\" he said on Thursday at the Techonomy conference in Half Moon Bay, Calif., just two days after Donald Trump was elected president, according to media reports. \"There have been hoaxes on the Internet, there were hoaxes before,\" he said. \"We do our best to make it so that people can report that, and as I said before, we can show people the most meaningful content we can.\"",

      "text": "Want to see the latest flight deals as soon as they’re published? Follow The Points Guy on Facebook and Twitter , and subscribe to text message alerts from our deals feed, @ tpg_alerts . \nAirfare deals are typically only available on limited dates. We recommend that you use Google Flights to find dates to fly, then book through an online travel agency, such as Orbitz or Expedia , which allows you to cancel flights without penalty by 11pm Eastern Time within one day of booking. However, if you’re using the American Express Platinum Card , you’ll need to book directly with the airline or through Amex Travel portal to get 5x MR points . Remember: Fares may disappear quickly, so book right away and take advantage of Orbitz or Expedia’s courtesy cancellation if you’re unable to get the time away from work or family. \nWhen it’s cold and snowy on the East Coast this winter, nothing sounds better than escaping to sunny Southern California. Fortunately, American Airlines has a great sale on flights from Newark (EWR) to Santa Ana (SNA) from just $135 round-trip, available for departures from December through February 2017. Santa Ana, also known as John Wayne Airport, is an airport in Orange County about 40 miles south of Los Angeles and is a gateway to many Southern California communities such as Newport Beach and Laguna Beach. Note that these flights have a layover in Dallas (DFW), while some dates do require an additional stop in Charlotte (CLT) on the return, but for these prices, it’s hard to say no. Book quickly if you want to grab one of these great deals, as availability is limited.\nAirline: American Airlines\nRoute: EWR — SNA\nCost: $135 round-trip in economy\nDates: December 2016 — February 2017\nBooking Link: Orbitz or Expedia \nPay With: The Platinum Card from American Express ( 5x on airfare ), Chase Sapphire Reserve , Premier Rewards Gold Card from American Express , Citi Prestige (3x on airfare) or Chase Sapphire Preferred (2x on travel)\nHere are a few examples of what you can book:\nNewark (EWR) to Santa Ana (SNA) for $135 round-trip over Valentine’s Day: \nNewark (EWR) to Santa Ana (SNA) for $135 round-trip. Newark (EWR) to Santa Ana (SNA) for $138 round-trip in January: \nNewark (EWR) to Santa Ana (SNA) for $138 round-trip. After American Airlines’ recent change to a revenue-based mileage program, you’re not going to earn many award miles from these cheap flights. But, these flights can be an excellent way of jump starting your elite mileage earnings in 2017. If you have Citi ThankYou points, you can book with miles through the Citi portal to get bonus AA award miles — while still getting the same amount of elite-qualifying miles (EQM).\nMaximize Your Purchase \nDon’t forget to use a credit card that earns additional points on airfare purchases, such as the American Express Platinum Card ( 5x on flights booked directly with airlines or American Express Travel ), Chase Sapphire Reserve , American Express Premier Rewards Gold or Citi Prestige (3x on airfare) or the Chase Sapphire Preferred Card (2x on all travel purchases). Check out this post for more on maximizing airfare purchases.\nFeatured image of Newport Beach, California courtesy of Getty Images. \nIf you’re able to score one of these tickets, please share the good news in the comments below! \nH/T: Thirty Traveler \nChase Sapphire Preferred® Card APPLY NOW Earn 50,000 bonus points after you spend $4,000 on purchases in the first 3 months from account opening.

      "text": "Zuckerberg: That Facebook influenced election is 'crazy' By BARBARA ORTUTAY AP Technology Writer 52 min ago \nNEW YORK (AP) — Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg says the idea that Facebook influenced the outcome of the U.S. election is a \"crazy idea.\" \nDuring an interview Thursday with \"The Facebook Effect\" author David Kirkpatrick, Zuckerberg responded to criticisms that Facebook helped spread misinformation by allowing for the sharing and re-sharing of fake news stories. \nZuckerberg says the idea that people voted the way they did because they saw a fake news story shows \"profound lack of empathy\" for people who voted for Donald Trump.

      "text": "Share View photos 3D-printed models of people are seen in front of a Facebook logo in this photo illustration taken June 9, 2016. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration More (Reuters) - Facebook Inc (FB.O) said on Friday it would stop advertisers from using its ethnicity-based ad-targeting feature on some ads, following criticism that advertisers could misuse the tool. The feature, intended to help advertisers reach ethnic groups with relevant ads, has come under fire from politicians and civil rights leaders for allowing advertisers to exclude users from seeing ads based on their race. Facebook will disable use of the tool, called \"Ethnic Affinities\", for ads that offer housing, employment and the extension of credit - areas where certain ethnicities have historically faced discrimination, the social network said in a blog post. ( http://bit.ly/2eZ8Eey ) \"There are many non-discriminatory uses of our ethnic affinity solution in these areas, but we have decided that we can best guard against discrimination by suspending these types of ads,\" Erin Egan, Facebook's chief privacy officer, wrote. Facebook's advertising policy will now require a commitment from advertisers that they will not engage in discriminatory advertising on its platform, the company said. ProPublica, a non-profit news organization, reported last month that Facebook lets advertisers exclude users by race, possibly violating federal housing and civil rights laws. ( http://bit.ly/2fDxLVc ) Facebook said it would also provide material to educate advertisers about advertising related to housing, employment and credit.

She was in a Washington State Starbucks working away Wednesday morning like she often does. But she was about to witness something extraordinary this time. \nShe said the coffee shop was pretty empty except for a table with a mother and her three young children. \nAlyssa was typing away when she noticed two soldiers walk into the shop in all of their gear. The kids went silent when they saw the two men. \nAfter placing their orders, one of the soldiers turns around -- sensing a pair of young eyes. He went over to the boy and asked him how his day was going. They have a quick chat and the soldier learns that the boy's favorite superhero is Spider-Man. \nThen the soldier ripped off his velcro American flag patch and gave it to the young boy. \nThe other soldier then walked over and did the same -- giving the boy his American flag patch right off of his uniform. \nAs you can imagine, the little boy smiled wide with happiness. \nSoon after, it was time for the kids to go to school. So the boys' mother thanked the two soldiers, Edgar Gonzalez and Pedro Cordoba, profusely. \nAnd with Friday being Veterans' Day, this is a perfect reminder to thank those who've served. \nRead the full story below: ",

      "text": "I've Interviewed Two Dozen Trump Voters in 6 Months. I'm Friending Them on Facebook. An experiment to pop the bubble. James West Nov. 11, 2016 12:51 PM Email Can I pop my \"filter bubble\" by adding all these Trump voters to Facebook? Let's find out. James West/Mother Jones \nWe live on a Facebook island where a stream of news endlessly conforms to and reinforces our political views . That's one theory, at least, behind why the US election results stunned half the country, stuck as we are in the social worlds of a segregated America, sustained by sometimes fact-free algorithms . \n\"American political discourse in 2016 seemed to be running on two self-contained, never-overlapping sets of information,\" wrote Joshua Benton at Nieman Lab on Wednesday. The death of the news business and Facebook's profit motive have combined, Benton argues, to make Facebook a \"sewer of misinformation.\" Here's how he describes the so-called \"filter bubble\" in which we live: \nSome of it is driven by ideology, but a lot is driven purely by the economic incentive structure Facebook has created: The fake stuff, when it connects with a Facebook user's preconceived notions or sense of identity, spreads like wildfire…I've come to think that the rise of fake news—and of the cheap-to-run, ideologically driven aggregator sites that are only a few steps up from fake—has weaponized those filter bubbles.\" \nFacebook itself did some research into these filter bubbles and found its news-ranking algorithm did modestly reduce the diversity of political content for users—slightly more for liberals—but by far the most important factor in that exposure was who we're friends with. Makes sense: The \"composition of our social networks is the most important factor limiting the mix of content encountered in social media,\" the company found in a 2015 report in the journal Science .\"Liberals tend to be connected to fewer friends who share conservative content than conservatives (who tend to be linked to more friends who share liberal content).\" \nI have lots of journalist friends. Lots of Australian friends. And lots of politically liberal friends. And so my own social-media feeds have been packed with shock and outrage at the result of the election. That doesn't surprise me: My conservative Facebook friends posted their outrage at Trump during the campaign, too. Connecting to Trump voters' everyday thoughts and opinions via Facebook alone has basically been impossible. \nAnd so, I'm embarking on an (unscientific) experiment. In a series of video reports over the last few months, I spoke with more than two dozen Trump supporters hailing from all over the country. I'm tracking them down again and asking: Can I friend you on Facebook? \nHere's everyone I spoke to in a handy 90-second video: \nI've already had some luck. Tuffy Nicholas, a 60-year-old circus producer from Sarasota, Florida, was excited by the idea. \n\"Most of my friends thought he would win by a landslide like he did,\" he told me on the phone, illustrating the divide. (I met Nicholas in Cleveland during the convention there, when he was selling Trump merchandise.) But Nicholas downplayed possible tensions between opposing groups of Americans. \"I'm optimistic, and I'm hoping for the best. I'm very pleased that the president [Obama] and Trump had a good meeting, and everyone is aiming for a smooth transition.\" \"Most of my friends thought he would win by a landslide like he did.\" \nTim Graney, from Katy, Texas, spent election night cheering on Trump outside the Fox News studios in midtown Manhattan. I had met the 50-year-old Republican earlier that day. He was also impressed by what he sees as Trump's desire to unite America. \n\"He was very positive and very complementary of Secretary Clinton…given the rhetoric and outlandish things both parties have said over the last year,\" he told me later, back in Texas with a hoarse voice. \"I think that's setting a very positive tone for uniting the country.\" \nHe also said Trump protesters are overreacting. In 2008, he said, \"I was right there in the thongs of the tea party, and we felt just as disenfranchised and looked down upon.\" Now, he says, it's their turn. \nGraney and I are now adding each other on Facebook. \nI did run into an obstacle with Glenn Hessler, 52, from Erie, Pennsylvania. He's not on Facebook. \"They control the news and they've also been found guilty of suppressing speech,\" he said. \"So you've got another universe where free speech and speech in general is controlled by the powers that be behind the internet…It's an extension of Big Brother.\" \nHe was into the idea of staying in touch, however: \"We are absolutely ready to reach out to the other side and explain things.\" \nI'll keep contacting and adding Trump supporters as friends if they say yes, and I'll report back as I go.

      "text": "I posted on my Reed College introductory politics class “Moodle”. I shared this on Facebook and getting a lot of requests to share more broadly. Any questions about the class readings and other references below, please email paul@earlyvoting.net.— Folks, \nI’ve spent the day trying to absorb and understand the election results, and I thought it might help to provide a list of resources where I am going to try to reason through this. I certainly don’t mind, and I’m sure Chris would not mind, if people want to talk, or rant, or celebrate, or protest. \nWe are not suggesting that you should be dispassionate or apolitical about the election outcome. I handle unexpected political changes by doing by best to deconstruct it and understand it. That’s my makeup. It need not be yours. Do what you will with below. \n1) The 50,000 Foot Look: \nI still think the best place to look and reflect is at a site that allows you to drill down to the county level, and compare vote changes from 2012. I prefer the NY Times, but I list a number of other sites below. Click through at these sites to see the various maps. \nThe best interactive maps in my opinion at the NY Times: http://www.nytimes.com/elections/results/president \nGreat mix of maps and exit polls at BBC: http://www.bbc.com/news/election-us-2016-37889032 \nUSA Today does a better job displaying change in support http://www.usatoday.com/…/intera…/how-the-election-unfolded/ \nCNN has a different look and feel, not my choice but has very nice individual state results http://www.cnn.com/election/results \n2) This election is a game changer and this election is a realignment \nMost of the evidence is that this election reinforced the existing divisions between the two parties. What was surprising to many observers was that more Republicans did not abandon their party standard bearer, given a lack of endorsements and many leaders distancing themselves from Trump. If you are able to ignore that for a moment, Trump’s support coalition looks nearly identical to Romney’s. Clinton underperformed Obama, especially among African Americans and Latinos. That’s the election in a nutshell. \nLarry Bartels at the Monkey Cage examines election 2016 https://www.washingtonpost.com/…/2016-was-an-ordinary-elec…/ \n3) What about race, ethnicity, gender? Didn’t the horrible things Trump said make a difference? \nYou know from our class that voters decide based on a wide variety of things–partisanship most importantly, then issues (mostly the economy), and then finally candidate characteristics. It has never been the case that candidate characteristics are the most important consideration. And it is often the case that attitudes about particular “single issues” can overwhelm everything else. While the things Trump said may matter a lot to you, you can’t expect that those same things matter to other people, who may believe in very different things and have very different life experiences. We won’t be able to answer this question in detail for a few months, but I suspect we are going to find not that many Trump voters did not completely ignore the things he said, but they heavily discounted them because of other concerns. And for another big chunk, race and ethnicity in particular get bound up with fear and discontent. That, unfortunately, is very common in the human condition. \nThis graphic from the NY Times summarizes Trump and Clinton support, compared to elections back to 2004, among key demographics. You may want to look at this first before following up on the links below. http://www.nytimes.com/…/…/elections/exit-poll-analysis.html \n3a) On Gender: Clinton simply did not benefit much from her gender, at least that’s what the evidence indicates. Gender identity is very different from racial solidarity, so expecting the gender effect in 2016 to function like the race effect in 2012 and 2008 was probably wishful thinking, no matter how much gender identity may matter to you. \nMichael Tesler at the Monkey Cage, with extensive citations to past work on the comparative weakness of gender identity. https://www.washingtonpost.com/…/why-the-gender-gap-doomed…/ \n3b) On Ethnicity (primarily Latinos): Evidence is far more mixed. The finding you are seeing in the press is that Trump received 29% of the Latino vote, which exceeds Romney’s margin by 9%. However, others are disputing this finding, critiquing the way the exit polls are conducted. This one will be debated for a while. \nMatt Barreto of UCLA and Latino Decisions (and older brother of a recent Reed alum in political science) runs down why he thinks the exit polls overestimate Trump support among Latinos http://www.latinodecisions.com/…/the-rundown-on-latino-vot…/ (UPDATE: Nice article at the Monkey Cage .) \n3c) On African American support: Clinton did not do as well as Obama among African Americans. If the 88% number holds, that’s down 5% from 2012. But what appears to have been more damaging is lower turnout overall, and this really hurt in states like Florida, Michigan, North Carolina, and Pennsylvania. \nPolitico story on the number of African Americans in Florida who voted early in 2012 and did not in 2016, citing the work of political scientist Daniel Smith of University of Florida. http://www.politico.com/…/clinton-campaign-struggles-in-get… \nAnalysis of the exit poll data by political scientists Stanley Feldman and Melissa Herrman http://www.cbsnews.com/…/cbs-news-exit-polls-how-donald-tr…/ \n4) What about the polls and the forecasts? Does this indicate that polling and statistical forecasting is junk? \nIt may not surprise that my answer is “no.” There was a systematic miss for the polls, and consequently the forecasts, and the misses were all in red states. If the models were junk, they would have missed in the blue states as well. That means there was something going on in the red states that was missed by the political observers and political scientists who obviously need to scrutinize what they are doing. But your own fundamentals based forecasts predicted Clinton’s vote almost precisely, as did at least two of the forecasts in PS. Something is seriously amiss about Trump support, but there’s no evidence (yet) that there is something seriously amiss about the fundamental underpinnings of election science. \nAndrew Gelman does a nice job showing the consistent miss in red states http://andrewgelman.com/…/polls-just-fine-blue-states-blew…/ \nGelman shows how a comparatively small yet systematic 2% shift in support toward Trump appears to explain virtually all the “misses.” http://andrewgelman.com/…/11/09/explanations-shocking-2-sh…/ \nSee also Nate Silver http://fivethirtyeight.com/…/what-a-difference-2-percentag…/ \nSilver reminds us (as you read in his book) that there is a tendency among people to refuse to acknowledge the meaning of uncertainty and probability. He’s to blame as much as anyone for producing these seemingly precise forecasts, but he’s not to blame for reporters and citizens not understanding uncertainty.",

      "title": "Did Fake Facebook News Help Elect Trump? Mark Zuckerberg Says That’s ‘Crazy’",
      "text": "NEW YORK (AP) — Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg says the idea that fake news spread on Facebook influenced the outcome of the U.S. election is “crazy.”\nStill, the majority of Americans (six in 10) say they get at least some news from social media , mostly Facebook, according to the Pew Research Center. While a lot of this news comes from established outlets — whether CNN or BuzzFeed News, misinformation spreads on Facebook just as information does, shared by users, recommended by software and amplified by both.\nSources of spurious information has ranged from news articles produced by “content farms” for the sole purpose of getting clicks, to “hyperpartisan” sites from both sides of the political spectrum, churning out stories that are misleading at best.\nCase in point: “FBI AGENT SUSPECTED IN HILLARY EMAIL LEAKS FOUND DEAD IN APPARENT MURDER-SUICIDE” — a fabricated headline from a fake news site called the Denver Guardian, was shared thousands of times in the days leading up to the election.\nIs it possible that voters were swayed for or against a candidate, much like those same people might buy a product after seeing an ad on Facebook?\nZuckerberg says voters deserve more credit.\nDuring an interview Thursday with “The Facebook Effect” author David Kirkpatrick, Zuckerberg said idea that people voted the way they did because of bogus information on Facebook shows a “profound lack of empathy” for supporters of Donald Trump.\n“Voters make decisions based on their lived experience,” he said.\nGiven the acerbic political contest from which the country just emerged, when countless longtime friends, even family, were unfriended, many are left to wonder if there would be an alternative American history being written today if it were not for Facebook, Twitter and the like.\nThis, after all, was the first truly social media election, playing out on Twitter and Facebook as much or more than it did on major networks, in living rooms and around watercoolers.\nBut isn’t social media just a reflection of our world as it exists? Has Facebook become an easy scapegoat when the answer is far more complex?\nWhile Pew found that many believe political discussions on social media to be “uniquely angry and disrespectful,” a comparable number have the same impression of face-to-face conversations when it comes to Democrats, the GOP, or another party.\nFILTER BUBBLE? \nWhen it comes to Facebook users, Zuckerberg said almost everyone has friends on the “other side.” Even if 90 percent of your friends are Democrats, for example, 10 percent will be Republican. Still, that’s not a very big number, and the idea of a “filter bubble” — that social media allows people to surround themselves only with the people and ideas with whom they agree, has been a hot topic this election cycle.\n“By far the biggest filter in the system is not that the content isn’t there, that you don’t have friends who support the other candidate or that are of another religion,” Zuckerberg said. “But it’s that you just don’t click on it. You actually tune it out when you see it. I don’t know what to do about that.”\nA DIFFICULT LINE \nFacebook has long denied that it’s a publisher or a media company, or that it acts remotely like either. Its cheery slogan — to make the world more “open and connected” — seemingly invites a broad range of viewpoints, diverse, lively discussion and the free flow of information, rather than censorship.\nBut it could also make clamping down on fake news difficult. At a time when everyone seems entitled, not just to their own opinions, but to their own facts, one person’s misleading headline might be another person’s heartfelt truth.\n“We take misinformation on Facebook very seriously,” Adam Mosseri, the executive in charge of Facebook’s news feed, said in a statement to the tech blog TechCrunch this week. “We value authentic communication, and hear consistently from those who use Facebook that they prefer not to see misinformation.”\nFacebook acknowledges that it has more work to do, and it seems to be putting a lot of faith in the power of data, artificial intelligence and algorithms as the solution.\nOver the summer, Facebook fired the small group of journalists in charge of its “trending” items and replaced them with an algorithm. The catalyst appeared to be a report in a tech blog, based on an anonymous source, that the editors routinely suppressed conservative viewpoints.\nSubsequently, fake stories ahead of the election began to trend.\nCopyright 2016 The Associated Press.
