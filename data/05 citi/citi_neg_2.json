      "title": "EUR/USD Post-Trump: 2 Key Reasons To Sell; We Stay Short – Citi",
      "text": "EUR/USD did manage to bounce up in perfect range trading , but this could also be a dead-cat bounce. The team at Citi lists two reasons to stay short: \nHere is their view, courtesy of eFXnews: \nThe Trump victory has 1) led to a change in language at the ECB and 2) raised questions as to whether EUR is a risk-positive or defensive currency? \nWe remain bearish on EUR/USD after last Tuesday’s surprise. \nFirst, ECB has softened their tone after the Trump vict ory. Concerns on the growth outlook for Europe as well as EU stability have limited a follow through in the “hawkish” rhetoric picked up last week. With December 8th’s ECB decision still to come – the market will trade in part off these perceived language changes. \nSecond, several of Euro’s anchors have been questioned after Trump’s victory. Eurozone stability, European trade and political relations are all longer-term drivers for Europe. They will change, possibly undermining investor confidence in the macro outlook for 2017/2018. Political risk for Europe is certainly going to rise into 2017 with the Italian Referendum, the Dutch, German and French elections. This tends to be negative for European equity markets, limiting cross border investment. And unlike the US, political surprises are unlikely to bring fiscal stimulus. \nThe short-run for EUR is dominated by rate differentials, the medium-run by a deteriorating trade outlook and the long-run by tail risk – both of these end up being EURUSD negative. \nFor lots more FX trades from major banks, sign up to eFXplus \nBy signing up to eFXplus via the link above, you are directly supporting Forex Crunch. \nWe expect an orderly move lower, testing the lower bound of the QE range and below but not a precipitous drop sharply lower. Generally the FX rate over the medium-term is driven by the cumulative current account, FDI and portfolio flow for a country. These three buckets account for 95% of the cross-border order flow. We expect the fiscal impulse from the US to become a magnet for both FDI and portfolio flows, and see little likelihood of it being matched by Europe. However, at the same time the ECB will likely undergo a tapering of its bond purchases over 2017 – leading to less investor displacement – and less EUR negative outflows monthly. The flows on net-remain negative, but the attraction to a foreign market has to be measured by the increasing options domestically. Hence, we are left with a weaker EUR, but orderly weakness. \nCitiFX added a short EUR/USD to its technical portfolio from 1.09 last week. \nFor lots more FX trades from major banks, sign up to eFXplus \nBy signing up to eFXplus via the link above, you are directly supporting Forex Crunch.",

I've been hearing for 10 years about (a) Handlowy sale and have to admit that this speculation has calmed down,\" Slawomir Sikora told a news conference following the bank's results. \n* Handlowy's website says Citi has a 75-pct stake in Handlowy \n* Poland has already bought back GE Money's Polish arm this year and plans to buy the second-largest lender Pekao from UniCredit, as well as Raiffeisen's Polish arm.

      "title": "Postcard from Costa Rica",
      "text": "Postcard from Costa Rica November 15, 2016 10:00 AM By Ed Sanchez, Citi Country Officer, Costa Rica \nAround the world, Citi Country Officers (CCOs) work to balance the execution of their country business strategy with their responsibilities ensuring the safety and soundness of the Citigroup franchise. Through this blog series, we are pleased to share perspectives from CCOs around the world, as well an insider’s look at the countries and cities where Citi operates. \nTell Us About Costa Rica \nOfficial language: Spanish \nBest Places to Dine: Hotel Grano de Oro- Di Bartolo- L’il de France \nFavorite Local Beverage: Agua dulce , pipa y Cerveza Imperial \nBest Tourist Sites: Arenal Volcano- Guanacaste beaches- specially Flamingo, Tropical Rainforest \nWhat I Love About Costa Rica : ¨ Pura Vida¨, its people and culture. \nCountry Profile \nHow many years has Citi been in your country? 48 years. \nWhat business units operate in your country? \nICG and aShared Service Center that provides services to several Citi entities in LATAM and NAM. \nWhat are the opportunities and challenges of doing business in your country? \nCiti selected Costa Rica as an ideal location for several shared service centers due to the proximity of a number of our multinational clients. There are also many qualified professionals in the country, which also benefits from a solid and stable democracy. As for challenges, the cost of living is higher in Costa Rica than in the rest of the region, which inevitably raises the cost of doing business in Costa Rica compared to some of our neighbors. \nPersonal/ Professional Background \nWhere were you born? I’m a North American, born in Santa Fe, the state capital of New Mexico. The city sits high in the Rocky Mountain range about 9000 ft above sea level and is known around the world for its artistic culture. There are more art galleries per square foot than any other city in the USA. \nWhat did you study that helped you prepare for a career in banking, and were there any subjects you realized subsequently would have helped you? \nGrowing up in the Southwest, I attended college at Northern Arizona University (NAU) in part because I won an athletic scholarship to play baseball at NAU. But at some point, much as I enjoyed my position as catcher, I realized that being a successful baseball player was a boyhood dream and that it made more sense to change direction and become a business major. During that transition I became interested in student politics and was elected Student Body President, a position that enabled me to start setting strategic objectives for myself. I learned about project management, and how to deal with NAU’s diverse student body. Having graduating with a BS in Business Administration, majoring in Accounting and minoring in Public Speaking, I can’t emphasize enough how important accounting is in the business world and especially in banking. Knowing how to read and really understand a balance sheet is a must. Upon graduation from NAU, I launched my professional career as a Systems Consultant. \nOver five years in consulting, I had the opportunity to work on a number of different consulting projects in Chicago, Dallas, NYC, Mexico, and Nigeria, at which point I decided to return to school for a graduate degree. I obtained a Master’s degree in Public Administration at Harvard, where I focused on international business. My goal was to leverage the international experience I had gained during my consulting career to work for a global financial institution with a strong presence in Latin America. And of course, that’s what led me to Citi. \nWhat other roles and countries have you worked in at Citi? \nI started with Citi in New York 31 years ago as a Management Associate, knowing that my previous consulting experience included fairly extensive management experience. I participated in the 6- month credit risk training program and was placed into the Derivatives Group in New York for another 6 months before being sent overseas to Latin America. \nMy first overseas assignment was in the Markets business in Brazil. Before arriving in Sao Paulo, I had to learn Portuguese so I attended a one month highly intensive language program. I fell in love with the language, people and culture. I even married an 18-year Brazilian Citibanker. At this time, Brazil had hyper-inflation, huge devaluations, and had impeached its first democratically elected President. Those were very exciting and volatile times! My Brazil experience gave me the foundation to become an Emerging Markets Banker. After two years in Markets, I moved into Corporate Finance just at the point when Brazil was poised to open its economy up to international bond financing. \nAfter 5 years in Brazil, I decided to accept an opportunity to head-up Corporate Finance in Venezuela during a boom in Venezuela. After working in structured Finance, M&A, and International Bond financings, all of which took off during the boom, i in 1998 I was asked to manage both Venezuela and Colombia from Bogota. The family relocated to Bogota and I started to manage my first little region during a very difficult period for Colombia in the late 1990’s. Fortunately, I have only fond memories of my clients and the people of Columbia and Venezuela. It was during those years that I learned to speak Spanish. \nIn 2000, I transferred from Colombia to Miami to run the Corporate Finance business for the Andean Region, a role that demanded that I develop structured finance opportunities from Colombia to Peru. Then in 2003, I shifted again from Corporate Finance with responsibility for the entire Andean region to Corporate and Investment Banking handling the Caribbean and Central America (CCA) region. For 7 years, I was the Corporate and Investment Bank Head for CCA. And it was in that position that I really absorbed the uniqueness of the Caribbean and the diversity of Central America. That experience helped me to build my business acumen on how to do deals across diverse geographies. As momentum for the BRIC countries accelerated, I decided to return to Brazil after an absence of 20 years and eventually accepted a position as head of the Corporate Bank in Brazil. \nDid you choose any of those roles thinking they would prepare you for a role as CCO ? \nAfter almost 30 years in Citi, armed with my different experiences, I decided that my skill set in general management qualified me for the role of CCO. With the help and support of senior leaders I gained my first CCO assignment as CCO of Costa Rica. I truly consider the CCO role to be the best leadership job at the bank, because it requires us to develop a unique set of leadership talents and skills ranging from risk and control to managing complex relationships with regulators and clients, talent management and Franchise Governance. I continue to be challenged and engaged by the role every day, for which I am grateful. \nRole and Responsibilities \nHow do you maintain work-life balance? What do you do in your free time? \nI wake up at 5am and do Circuit Training for one hour in the morning 5 days a week. After working out, as I am winding down, I take 30 minutes to read. I dedicate this reading time to non-business books. On weekends, I like to sleep in late, drink lots of coffee, and Instagram. I continue to study and follow Neuro-Linguistics Programming (NLP) courses and topics. NLP helps my personal self-discovery and professional positive and team management style. \nHow does your role help you make progress? \nEvery day is a new day, filled with new and exciting challenges. As a “walk around” CCO, I’m able to feel the pulse of our employees so that I can gain an understanding of how best I can help and support them to succeed.",

      "text": "The US dollar is still in pause mode after the Trump rally , but the moves could resume. The team at Citi lists 3 reasons to stay long \nHere is their view, courtesy of eFXnews: \nThe post-election drivers of USD strength are anticipation of: 1) fiscal stimulus 2) corporate tax reform 3) a faster pace of Fed hikes. \nAs long as these are the drivers there is no reason for USD strength to diminish. \nInvestors are so far taking a very benign view of the incoming Administration’s likely impact on asset markets, taking their cue from President-elect Trump’s early comments on infrastructure spending and tax reform, including earnings repatriation. Trump, Republicans and even some Congressional Democrats support corporate tax reform, so this looks like low hanging stimulus fruit in the early part of the new Administration link. \nFor lots more FX trades from major banks, sign up to eFXplus \nBy signing up to eFXplus via the link above, you are directly supporting Forex Crunch. \nThis is pushing up US equities, nominal yields, real yields and inflation expectations (Figure 1), a pretty good deal if you own US assets and USD. The expected slope of the fed funds rate path is the highest since March, suggesting that investors are also seeing the Fed as more aggressive (Figure 2), but not aggressive enough to derail asset market gains. \nCitiFX added to its technical portfolio last week a short EUR/USD from 1.09 and a long USD/JPY from 106.75. \nFor lots more FX trades from major banks, sign up to eFXplus \nBy signing up to eFXplus via the link above, you are directly supporting Forex Crunch.",

      "text": "Getty Images Donald Trump Citi Research strategist Tobias Levkovich told investors Donald Trump's and the Republican Congress' economic agenda may substantially boosts corporate earnings and economic growth if enacted.\n\n\"A meaningful fiscal push in addition to improved lending standards might lead to accelerated growth,\" Levkovich wrote in a note to clients Tuesday titled \"Trumped Up Could Trickle Down.\"\n\"Tax cuts could be quite stimulative to S&P 500 EPS,\" he wrote.\nThe strategist explained if the corporate tax rate is reduced to 20 percent from the current effective rate of 27 percent, it would add $12 to his 2017 S&P 500 earnings-per-share estimate of $129, an increase of 9.3 percent. He also noted that Trump's proposed $1 trillion of fiscal stimulus would be a \"significant number\" for the $16 trillion U.S. economy. \n\"We suspect that investors may not be willing to accord the same P/E for earnings generated by a lower tax rate versus one for underlying operating performance. Nonetheless, even if we assumed half the market multiple on the incremental tax-related EPS gains, it will still be additive to the S&P 500's upside potential,\" he wrote. \"We would like to see more data and details before changing our forecasts.\" \nLevkovich was more definitive on the potential passage of an overseas earnings repatriation bill. He expects the repatriation size will be larger than the $600 billion companies brought home during the last one-time tax break in 2004. \n\"The likelihood of a repatriation of trapped overseas funds seems high with the GOP controlling the White House and Congress. There is the hope that the money would be used for capex especially with large one-time write-offs being proposed,\" he wrote. \nHowever, it's not all good news as stronger economic growth may cause inflation and a rising dollar, according to the strategist. Levkovich estimated every 10 percent move higher by the dollar would detract 2 percent of annual earnings from the S&P 500 as the value of foreign earnings falls. \n\"A stronger US dollar is plausible if growth and inflation ensue, thereby limiting the earnings benefits. Higher rates from the Fed and possible 'crowding out' plus inflation pushing bond yields upward are viewed as offsetting negatives especially if the dollar climbs and eats into earnings,\" he wrote. \nFor those concerned over a strengthening dollar, Citi Research recommended clients avoid S&P 500 companies with large international exposure such as the seven stocks below:",

      "text": "Markets Today Citi May Have to Write Off Up to $12 Billion of Tax Credits Under Trump Plan Citigroup has made its $45 billion of tax credits a key pillar of its strategy to improve profitability and increase dividends. But tax-code changes under Trump could force a reassessment. Bradley Keoun Nov16,201612:55PMEST \nPresident-Elect Donald Trump's promised tax cuts for corporations pose a threat to one of the biggest U.S. banks: Citigroup ( C ) , which has pitched investors for years on the enormous value of its $45 billion of tax credits accumulated during the financial crisis of 2008. \nJohn Gerspach, Citigroup's CFO, told an investor conference today that the New York-based lender may have to write off as much as $12 billion if Trump succeeds in cutting the corporate tax rate to 25% from about 35% currently. Under another scenario where the tax cuts are applied on more limited basis, the write-off would be closer to $6 billion, or $4 billion if the rate drops to just 28%. \n\"There's a lot of moving pieces,\" Gerspach said, \"but that's sort of where we are right now in trying to do a top-level assessment.\" \nCitigroup's Gerspach, along with CEO Mike Corbat, have touted the benefits of the so-called deferred tax assets as a way of increasing net earnings above what the bank makes from its regular operations. The downside is that the DTAs can only be deployed slowly: The lender has used just $10 billion of them since Corbat took over in 2012, and it would take 25 years to work off the remaining balance at the past year's rate. \nThe disclosure brings the outspoken CLSA analyst Mike Mayo closer to vindication in his contention as early as 2009 that the bank's refusal to write off the DTAs -- even then -- represented aggressive accounting practices that should have been abandoned in the wake of the post-financial-crisis clean-up. Mayo has railed against the bank's management over the issue, arguing that the tax credits were unlikely to ever be fully utilized. Prev 0 of 2 Next If you liked this article you might like",

      "text": "Markets Today Citi's Plan to Plow $2.5 Billion Into Mexico Unfazed by Trump's Wall The U.S. lender Citigroup has no plans to back away from invest $2.5 billion in Mexico, even as President-Elect Donald Trump pledges to build a wall along the border. Bradley Keoun Nov16,20164:44PMEST \nCitigroup ( C ) , the U.S. bank that's pledged to pump $2.5 billion of new investment into Mexico, remains undaunted in its commitment despite Donald Trump's victory in the U.S. presidential race, which dragged the peso down by 10%. \nThe lender, which owns one of Mexico's biggest banks, has seen its stock price lag in the past week as overall financial-company shares surged on the prospect of reduced regulation and higher interest rates under a Trump presidency. Citigroup's shares have gained 9.2% since the election, versus a 12% climb in the KBW Bank Index. \n\"The market's view of Mexico perhaps is not quite as constructive right now as our view of Mexico,\" Citigroup CFO John Gerspach told investors Wednesday at a conference in New York. \"We still think there is a lot of value in that Mexico franchise.\" \nDuring the campaign, Trump promised to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement, one of the biggest drivers of Mexico's economic growth since it took effect in 1994. The president-elect also pledged to build an \"impenetrable physical wall\" along the border and force Mexico to pay for it. In an interview broadcast Sunday on \"60 Minutes,\" Trump said he might accept a fence instead of a wall in certain areas. \nCitigroup bought its Mexican bank, Banamex, in 2001 for $12.5 billion. In recent years, the Mexican operations have led to suits over money laundering and regulatory fines over an alleged loan fraud involving the offshore oil-services company Oceanografia. \nIn 2014, Citigroup disclosed that it would pump $1.5 billion of new capital into Mexico over four years, and in October it announced an additional $1 billion investment to shore up technology, revamp branches and rebrand the franchise as \"Citibanamex.\" \nGerspach, the CFO, said the bank still sees \"good returns\" ahead from the Mexican franchise. \n\"We'll have to see exactly where this all translates to from trade protectionism,\" Gerspach said, according to a transcript. \"Is there a wall? Is it partially a fence? Maybe. I don't know if that has any difference if part of it is a fence as opposed to a wall, but we'll see. It's too early to tell.\" \nEXCLUSIVE LOOK INSIDE: Citigroup is a holding in Jim Cramer's Action Alerts PLUS charitable trust portfolio. Want to be alerted before he buys or sells the stock?

      "text": "Citigroup ( C ) , the U.S. bank that's pledged to pump $2.5 billion of new investment into Mexico, remains undaunted in its commitment despite Donald Trump's victory in the U.S. presidential race, which dragged the peso down by 10%.\nThe lender, which owns one of Mexico's biggest banks, has seen its stock price lag in the past week as overall financial-company shares surged on the prospect of reduced regulation and higher interest rates under a Trump presidency. Citigroup's shares have gained 9.2% since the election, versus a 12% climb in the KBW Bank Index.\n\"The market's view of Mexico perhaps is not quite as constructive right now as our view of Mexico,\" Citigroup CFO John Gerspach told investors Wednesday at a conference in New York. \"We still think there is a lot of value in that Mexico franchise.\"\nDuring the campaign, Trump promised to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement, one of the biggest drivers of Mexico's economic growth since it took effect in 1994. The president-elect also pledged to build an \"impenetrable physical wall\" along the border and force Mexico to pay for it. In an interview broadcast Sunday on \"60 Minutes,\" Trump said he might accept a fence instead of a wall in certain areas.\nCitigroup bought its Mexican bank, Banamex, in 2001 for $12.5 billion. In recent years, the Mexican operations have led to suits over money laundering and regulatory fines over an alleged loan fraud involving the offshore oil-services company Oceanografia.\nIn 2014, Citigroup disclosed that it would pump $1.5 billion of new capital into Mexico over four years, and in October it announced an additional $1 billion investment to shore up technology, revamp branches and rebrand the franchise as \"Citibanamex.\"\nGerspach, the CFO, said the bank still sees \"good returns\" ahead from the Mexican franchise.\n\"We'll have to see exactly where this all translates to from trade protectionism,\" Gerspach said, according to a transcript. \"Is there a wall? Is it partially a fence? Maybe. I don't know if that has any difference if part of it is a fence as opposed to a wall, but we'll see. It's too early to tell.\"\nEXCLUSIVE LOOK INSIDE: Citigroup is a holding in Jim Cramer's Action Alerts PLUS charitable trust portfolio. Want to be alerted before he buys or sells the stock?

      "text": "Citigroup ( C ) , the U.S. bank that's pledged to pump $2.5 billion of new investment into Mexico, remains undaunted in its commitment despite Donald Trump's victory in the U.S. presidential race, which dragged the peso down by 10%.\nThe lender, which owns one of Mexico's biggest banks, has seen its stock price lag in the past week as overall financial-company shares surged on the prospect of reduced regulation and higher interest rates under a Trump presidency. Citigroup's shares have gained 9.2% since the election, versus a 12% climb in the KBW Bank Index.\n\"The market's view of Mexico perhaps is not quite as constructive right now as our view of Mexico,\" Citigroup CFO John Gerspach told investors Wednesday at a conference in New York. \"We still think there is a lot of value in that Mexico franchise.\"\nDuring the campaign, Trump promised to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement, one of the biggest drivers of Mexico's economic growth since it took effect in 1994. The president-elect also pledged to build an \"impenetrable physical wall\" along the border and force Mexico to pay for it. In an interview broadcast Sunday on \"60 Minutes,\" Trump said he might accept a fence instead of a wall in certain areas.\nCitigroup bought its Mexican bank, Banamex, in 2001 for $12.5 billion. In recent years, the Mexican operations have led to suits over money laundering and regulatory fines over an alleged loan fraud involving the offshore oil-services company Oceanografia.\nIn 2014, Citigroup disclosed that it would pump $1.5 billion of new capital into Mexico over four years, and in October it announced an additional $1 billion investment to shore up technology, revamp branches and rebrand the franchise as \"Citibanamex.\"\nGerspach, the CFO, said the bank still sees \"good returns\" ahead from the Mexican franchise.\n\"We'll have to see exactly where this all translates to from trade protectionism,\" Gerspach said, according to a transcript. \"Is there a wall? Is it partially a fence? Maybe. I don't know if that has any difference if part of it is a fence as opposed to a wall, but we'll see. It's too early to tell.\"\nEXCLUSIVE LOOK INSIDE: Citigroup is a holding in Jim Cramer's Action Alerts PLUS charitable trust portfolio. Want to be alerted before he buys or sells the stock?

      "text": "The Canadian dollar did not react positively to Trump’s Triumph. The team at Citi sees further downside risk: \nHere is their view, courtesy of eFXnews: \nWe see three main drivers for CAD in the wake of Trump victory: 1) US fiscal policy and tax reform, 2) trade treaty discussions, and 3) rates differentials. All imply CAD bearishness in our view. \nFirstly, with a Republican congress, Trump will be able to push through corporate tax reduction without increasing personal taxes as president Obama wanted. Together with repatriation, Trump tax policy may attract corporate capital flows from Canada and elsewhere to the US. On personal taxes, if as promised Trump reduces tax brackets and lower taxation for high earning individuals, high quality labor capital flows may be attracted to the US as well. Overall, implications from Trump’s tax initiatives are largely CAD negative. \nSecondly , if Trump assigns a high priority to trade reform, the fear of global supply chain disruption will return to the market. Canada looks vulnerable as the biggest trade partner with the US. It is not clear that Canada has gained much from NAFTA, but that doesn’t mean that it will benefit if NAFTA falls apart. Uncertain outcomes from re-negotiation may weigh on Canadian exports and CAD going forward. \nLastly , rates differentials indicate USDCAD upside. Markets are pricing in more than 70% probability of December Fed hike and two more hikes by end of 2017. Citi economists call for a rate cut by the BoC by end of 2016 or early next year. Risk rally post the election added to the widened rates differential, which points to a higher USDCAD as shown in Figure 7 below. \nFor lots more FX trades from major banks, sign up to eFXplus \nBy signing up to eFXplus via the link above, you are directly supporting Forex Crunch.",

      "text": "Advertiser Disclosure Citi Challenges Google And Apple With Citi Pay \nWhile the mobile wallet crowd has a few big names like Apple Pay, PayPal and Android Pay, Citibank is looking to compete as it launched its own mobile wallet just last Thursday. The company unveiled Citi Pay, a new mobile wallet for Android phone users. As of now, Citi Pay is not available as an iOS App. It's a similar concept to Android Pay, Google's mobile payments service. Users can input their Citibank credit card and debit card information onto the Android app and use it to pay for their purchases. \nAccording to Barry Rodrigues, head of global digital payments at Citi, the company wants its customers to enjoy seamless, convenient and quick payment options, no matter where they are in the world. \nThe company has more than 200 million customers worldwide in more than 160 countries, so it is uniquely positioned to take on some of the biggest names in the industry. And, since mobile wallet is growing in popularity, Citibank is playing catch-up with J.P. Morgan Chase, which launched Chase Pay in 2015 and Wells Fargo , which launched a similar app earlier this year. \nOnce the credit and debit card is loaded onto the Android App, shoppers can make in-store purchases at any merchant with point-of-sale registers that support near-field communication technology. With near-field communication technology, instead of swiping the card, users can place their phones next to the register's sensors to make the payment, which makes for a seamless checkout experience. \nApp users can also make online purchases and in-app purchases using the same Citibank online username and password information that they're currently using to manage their existing online accounts at Citibank. \nThe company is also working with MasterCard to allow Citi Pay users to use the app to make payments with hundreds of thousands of Internet merchants across 33 countries, and the list of countries and available merchants will certainly expand after the launch. \nCitibank customers in the U.S. will have to wait until early 2017 as Citi Pay has a planned U.S. launch for early 2017, though customers in Australia , Mexico and Singapore will be able to use the app soon as Citibank plans to roll it out later this year.

The bank told the Sydney Morning Post that under 4% of its customers had made cash transactions through the bank last year. ​   You forgot to provide an Email Address.

Financial technology (fintech) initially focused on creating new service channels for banks. This has changed customer behaviour across the world. Read more about retail banking IT in Australia",

      "text": "3rd Night Free at SPG Hotels in Asia Pacific; Stack with Citi Prestige 4th Night Free November 17, 2016 by Enoch Leave A Comment \nSPG is running a promotion in conjunction with MasterCard, where you can get your 3rd night free when you pay with MasterCard . You will have to book before February 28, 2017 , and complete your stay before July 14, 2017 . Simply book online by using the promo code M3C (room only) or M3B (room + breakfast). Get your 3rd night free at SPG properties in Asia Pacific when you pay with your MasterCard under this promotion. \nNot all hotels are participating, though from what I gathered most of them are. Eligible countries include the following. Fiji China (including Hong Kong and Macau) Malaysia New Caledonia Maldives \nI played with this promotion a little bit, with different properties in different countries, and it’s not very consistent. Some hotels flat out don’t have rooms available at this rate. For example, the St. Regis Beijing, which is a participating hotel under the T&C, does not register the promotion through the end of schedule. The St. Regis Beijing is technically a “participating property” under this promotion However, none of the days I’ve tried is eligible for this promotion. \nOther hotels, like the W Hong Kong, charge a higher room rate for this promotion. Here, you are really only saving ~HK$400 per night on a room rate that could otherwise be HK$2366. That’s still a ~20% discount, if you’re okay with a prepaid rate (no cancellations), but definitely not 33% as a “3rd night free” promo would suggest. The “3rd night free” promo amounts to a ~20% discount in W Hong Kong \nHowever, what can make this promotion great is the fact that you can stack it with Citi Prestige’s 4th night free benefit . When you call Citi Prestige to make the reservation, you can tell them to apply the promo code ( M3C or MCB ) to get the 3rd night free. However, Citi will provide you with a statement credit for the 4th night , which is charged in full. You can effectively get up to 50% off a 4-night-stay by stacking the two deals. \nNote that as of July 23, 2017, Citi will give you a statement credit based on the average nightly rate of the completed stay. This means you will no longer get to double dip. However, since this promotion runs until July 14, 2017, you should still receive both 3rd and 4th nights free, provided that you book through the Citi Prestige Concierge and apply the SPG promo code. \nAs a reminder, Hyatt is also running a similar promotion , albeit with Visa. You can get every 3rd night free by using the code HYVISA and paying with a Visa Platinum, Signature, or Infinite card. Hyatt’s promotion runs until March 31, 2017, and works on Standard Rates. \nFull terms and conditions of the SPG/MasterCard offer is available here .",

      "text": "News in brief Australian bank branches stop dealing with cash \nSix retail branches of Citi bank in Australia are to stop dealing with cash because of falling demand from customers who prefer to manage their money digitally, the Sydney Morning Herald reports . Citi’s head of retail banking Janine Copelin said less than 4% of the bank’s customers had made cash transactions through a branch in the last year. The move comes as Australian Reserve Bank data shows cash was used in 78% of payments worth less than A$10 (US$7.46) in 2013, down from 95% in 2007.

Clients with qualifying balances of $200,000 or more are given a dedicated team to meet their financial and wealth management needs, plus complimentary financial planning. They are also privy to a slew of market research, and receive benefits such as unlimited refunds on third-party ATM fees anywhere in the world. Citi Priority clients will also have access to financial advisers from Citi's wealth management division. \nCiti Priority, by contrast, is aimed at clients with balances between $50,000 and $199,999. \nThey receive digital money management tools and preferred pricing on mortgages and other credit products, as well as waived fees and discounts on deposit accounts. Travelers can benefit from the absence of foreign-exchange fees on Citi debit cards. \nCiti Priority clients will also have access to financial advisers from Citi's wealth management division, who stand ready to offer guidance. \n\"Through these new offerings, we are pleased to bring the full breadth of our global expertise to our clients,\" Venu Krishnamurthy, the head of Citigold and Citi Priority as well as Citi's personal wealth management division, said in a news release. \nIn the coming weeks, he added, Citi will roll out \"enhanced digital and mobile capabilities\" to support these offerings. This infographic walks advisors through revising and strengthening their client interactions under the DOL fiduciary rule. Partner Insights ",

      "title": "Stiffed Citi AA Exec Bonus Points: Arbitration Right Away?",
      "text": "Stiffed Citi AA Exec Bonus Points: Arbitration Right Away? November 17, 2016 2 \nHere’s another candidate for the 2016 Festivus Airing of Grievances . This time it’s brought to you by Citi, another bank who no longer cares for points enthusiasts. Before Citi introduced the rule that a customer could not receive another bonus whether it be Hilton, AA, or ThankYou, if they have opened a card within 2 years, I and many in my congregation, applied for cards that would otherwise be excluded. I chose the Citi AA Exec and a couple of weeks later, I applied for the Citi AA Gold . I was approved for both. In fact, Citi gave me an additional 5k for my Citi AA Exec because they couldn’t send it to the right address. \nI received the bonus miles for the AA Gold, the second of my applications, but not for the Citi AA Exec. Foolishly, I thought the chat person could help me with this and, as usual, they were useless and recommended I call in. Well, to the shock of none, the customer service representative said that I did not qualify for the Citi AA Exec bonus points because I had opened a Citi AA World Explorer or World Explorer Elite or whatever the hell it is called within the last two years. That, she said, was a violation of the terms and conditions for receiving the bonus. \nI quickly pointed out that I had received the bonus for the AA Gold card after I had applied for the Citi Exec so her logic was incorrect. Citi is now launching an investigation and I am sure I will get a letter saying that I am not eligible. Worse, I’ll be stuck with the $450 annual fee as there is a limited duration for when the card can be cancelled and prorated amount refunded. From there, I have two choices: write a useless letter to the Office of the President or simply file my intent to arbitrate. \nAs a consumer protection attorney, I have helped many Frequent Miler readers who have had claims from Citi to eBay resolve their disputes. Now, I find myself in the interesting situation where I have a fool for a client. \nWhy does it always have to be such a battle? Why can’t the banks just live up to the terms of their agreement that they and their behemoth legal team create? As consumers, we have to abide by the terms lest the banks close are cards at any time and for any reason. \nIf you are someone you love has suffered an injury from mesothelioma, call one of those attorneys you see on TV. If you or someone you remotely like is getting the runaround from a bank, email me, leave me a comment, send me a Tweet, or follow me on Instagram for pics of what I used to do when I had points. Enough is enough. I gotta have my points! How many trips to the Admirals Club am I going to have to take to make up for the annual fee should I not prevail? SHARE",

      "text": "  17,   \nCiti ThankYou Rewards is offering a one-third bonus on transfers to Hilton HHonors through February 8. \nCitibank introduced Hilton as its first transfer partner nearly 4 years ago. We’ve seen bonus offers for transfers to Hilton before including last year at this time . \nView from the Hilton Colombo, Sri Lanka \nHilton points are generally worth half a cent apiece . I value Citi points at 1.6 cents each. Getting two Hilton points per ThankYou point means transferring points at a value of a penny. Not. A. Good. Deal.

But even that’s not the best use of points in my opinion. \nThankYou points from a Citi Prestige or Citi ThankYou Premier account transfer to: \nAir France-KLM",

Taking what you have said literally, though, the first CSR didn't promise you anything...but simply told you that the time to request a fee waiver would be after the payment had posted. I had Dividend and Double Cash (PC'd from Diamond Preferred)I mentioned their ads about first time late fee waiver the first time I chatted with CSR, and the other two times later I mentioned again as well. The first CSR ensured me that fee waiver should be granted and no effect on my credit score since I also brought up the issue that they might report my late payment also. They just did not honor that. All my posts are my opinions. All my posts mentioned \"you\" are merely for discussion-purpose only. No advice is given in any post at any time.

      "text": "by Paul Clarke About an hour ago \nJohn McPherson, who left Citi after just a couple of months in 2015, has re-emerged to head up a machine learning fintech firm.  en/265761/15-people-you-need-to-know-in-banking-technology/ \nJohn McPherson, the former European head of listed derivatives at Citigroup, who left the role after just a couple of months in June 2015 has been out of the market since. He’s now just re-emerged as CEO of a fintech firm backed by the Bank of England. \nMcPherson is CEO of BMLL Technologies Ltd as of earlier this month. BMLL says that it uses a machine learning platform to provide deep data analytics around trade order books on a per ticker or daily basis. It has around 20 employees and is currently hiring for research and technical writing roles. \nThe Bank of England launched a fintech accelerator in June and its chief operating officer, Charlotte Hogg , said earlier this month that it was backing BMLL as it focuses on “data analytics, information security, and some work exploring distributed ledgers”. \nMcPherson is an experienced futures trader who has held senior roles at Goldman Sachs and Nomura. He was a managing director and head of fixed income futures and options sales and execution for EMEA at Goldman for over nine years, and moved to Nomura in 2013. \nWhen, in 2015, Nomura announced that it was closing some of its businesses including OTC clearing, McPherson decided to move on and was hired by Citigroup as head of listed derivatives for Europe in April 2015. \nHowever, he lasted just a couple of months in the role and left in June. Since then, he has been working as a non-executive director and consultant. \nMcPherson has taken over the CEO role from Johannes Sulzberger, who joined BMLL in September 2011 and was previously a managing director and equities trader at Goldman Sachs.

      "text": "With salesforce.com, inc. (NYSE: CRM ) reporting robust Q3 results and guiding to a solid Q4, Citi’s Walter H. Pritchard believes the weakness in Q2 was more due to a lapse in execution rather than a fundamental slowdown. \nPritchard maintains a Buy rating on the company, while raising the price target from $89 to $95. Solid Execution \nBilling grew 21 percent year-on-year in Q3:17, well above the estimate and consensus, due to solid execution and large deal strength, especially financial services. \nUnbilled backlog stood at $8.6 billion, with implied new business growth of 16 percent year on year. Both metrics point to robust growth, Pritchard noted. \nTotal revenue came in at $2.14 billion , ahead of expectations, while the EPS of $0.24 was also well ahead of the estimate and consensus. \nProfitability was also better than anticipated, with operating margin of 12.7 percent, driven by higher revenue and marginally lower than expected S&M. Guidance \nSalesforce.com guided to 21–23 percent billings growth for Q4, well ahead of the previous estimate. While the revenue guidance was also ahead of expectations, EPS was in line. \nThe company expects revenue of more than $10 billion in FY 2018, continuing the trend of growth of more than 20 percent. \n“While bigger M&A questions may persist, we think combination of growth at scale and steadily improving margins at a reasonable valuation makes CRM a core SaaS holding,” Pritchard went on to say. \nIn Friday's pre-market session, salesforce.com was seen up 6.8 percent at $75.19.

      "text": "Small Claims vs. Arbitration \nThe overwhelming majority of contracts governing consumer products and services have a dispute resolution provision that limits a claimant’s remedy to two options: file in small claims court or prosecute the claim through arbitration. A class-action lawsuit is strictly prohibited. The issue with the small claims option is that damages are limited and the plaintiff will not be represented by an attorney. This clearly favors big corporations that have infinite resources and a stable of lawyers. \nIn this case, my client agreed to pursue the claim in arbitration and hired me to represent her on a contingency fee basis i.e., I would only collect a fee if the client prevailed or if the case settled. Absent this fee arrangement, it would have been cost prohibitive for my client to retain a lawyer to go up against a behemoth like Citi. \nIntent to Arbitrate \nI filed a claim against Citi with the American Arbitration Association (AAA) seeking two forms of relief: Monetary relief in the amount of $17,000 and non-monetary relief which would be the restoration of my client’s ThankYou points. The monetary claim was based on $.008/point, half of the value of ThankYou points when used by a Citi Prestige cardholder to book American Airlines flights. I did not seek the entire value of the points because my client was more interested in getting her points back than money. The client would appear greedy if she asked for the full monetary value of the points and the actual points. I advised my client that it was a long-shot that Citi would ever give back her points even if she won in arbitration. At the same time, if a points refund was not an option, we could ask the arbitrator for the full value of the points in terms of the monetary award. \nFirst Correspondence with Opposing Counsel \nAfter I filed the claim, I waited for a case manager from the AAA to be assigned to the case. The case manager is in charge of scheduling hearings and serves as a liaison among the attorneys and the arbitrator. That process took more than thirty days to complete. Shortly thereafter, I received an email from Citi’s lawyer. I spoke to the attorney and was informed that my clients’ accounts were closed for consumer abuse in connection with manufactured spending. Citi presented my client with an offer to settle the claim for $3,500 if we agreed to dismiss the arbitration claim. \nA Note on Arbitration Costs \nUnder the consumer arbitration rules, the consumer’s side has to pay $200 to file a claim. The respondent has to pay its portion of the administrative fee which is $1,700 as well as compensation for the arbitrator which starts at $1,500. In addition, the respondent would have to pay outside counsel to represent the company in the matter should it choose not to use its own lawyers. In addition to the outside counsel’s hourly rate or fixed fee, the respondent may also have to pay for air, hotel accommodations, and a per diem if the attorney does not reside in the location where the arbitration is held. As a result of such costs, some companies find it financially prudent to settle claims while others will incur the cost in order to send a message to attorneys and consumers that simply filing an arbitration claim will not result in a cash windfall for the claimant. \nThe Rejection \nThis claim had merit. It was not, by any means, frivolous. As a result, we rejected the proposed settlement and began preparing our case. \nThe Terms and Conditions: Fraud vs. Abuse \nCiti’s terms and conditions have evolved over the years, undoubtedly as more customers discover more ways to maximize their points earning potential. \nHere are Citi’s terms for ThankYou accounts from October 2016: \nFraud, Misuse, Abuse, or Suspicious Activity. If we see evidence of fraud, misuse, abuse, or suspicious activity, we’ll investigate and, if we determine that fraud, misuse or abuse has occurred, we may take actions against you. These actions may include, without limitation: Taking away the Points you earned because of fraud, misuse or abuse Stopping you from earning Points Suspending or closing your ThankYou Account Taking legal action to recover Rewards redeemed because of such activity and to recover our monetary losses, including litigation costs and damages \nHere are Citi’s terms from November 2013 (when my client was using her Citi cards): \nThankYou Rewards may close or freeze your ThankYou Member Account immediately. If you have conducted any fraudulent activity, ThankYou Rewards reserves the right to take any necessary legal action and may have grounds to confiscate any rewards redeemed as a result of such activity. \nThe language in 2013, the period my client was earning the majority of her points, cites fraud not abuse as a reason for account shutdown. The definition of fraud varies by jurisdiction but, for the sake of simplicity, the dictionary definition is wrongful or criminal deception intended to result in financial or personal gain. In my legal opinion, alleging fraud means alleging criminal activity. Manufactured spending may be frowned upon but it is not against the law. My client admitted that she was buying a significant amount of gift cards to take advantage of the category spends but in no way was she deceiving anyone by doing so. \nA Note on Counter-Claims \nI advise my clients of the possibility that a counter-claim may be filed against them. For many corporations, a counter-claim is an automatic response, a passive aggressive way to signal to the claimant that the corporation is actually the one in control. Some corporations like eBay include clauses in its arbitration agreement that if a claim is found to be frivolous, the consumer will be responsible for the aforementioned arbitration costs. Some corporations use counter-claims as a tool to induce settlement or surrender. Given the capacity of the opponent, it can be very intimidating for the lawyer and client alike to move forward with a claim when they are suddenly under siege by a foe that is too big to fail. \nThe Legal Argument \nIn our estimation, the 2013 terms and conditions governed this claim. Confident that no fraud had been committed, my client was willing to testify that she simply took advantage of the offer that was presented to her and if Citi wanted to place a cap on the offer, it could easily have done so. Furthermore, my client would argue that her past behavior was ratified by Citi when she was given a retention offer which encouraged her to keep spending in the same manner as she had done in the past. \nIf Citi somehow tried to use the consumer abuse language of 2016, our argument would have remained the same. Citi, equipped with a team of lawyers and a robust marketing department could have used more explicit language to define what is and what is not permissible. If a mom and pop grocery stores has the wherewithal to place a limit of ‘one turkey per household’ during a Thanksgiving Day sale , then surely Citi could have foreseen the consequences of not implementing a cap on its promotion. Not only did Citi fail to mitigate against this possibility, it also encouraged it by blatantly stating that there was not a limit on points that could be earned. Unsurprisingly, throughout this process, Citi would not divulge how much category spending is enough to trigger a shutdown. \nFinally, it can be argued that Citi was unjustly enriched. Citi capitalized from the tens of thousands of dollars from my client’s purchases in the form of transaction fees. If Citi truly believed that fraud or abuse had taken place, it should refund the fees to the merchants from where the transactions occurred. It is unseemly that Citi only cried foul when it was time for it to uphold its end of the bargain. \nTo Settle Or Not To Settle \nThe problem with having an attorney who is involved in the world of points and a client who is just as obsessed is the lack of perspective. Although I was excited by the prospect of going through the entire arbitration process with Citi, I also had an ethical obligation to inform my client of the risks that she faced. First, there still was the chance of a counter-claim, a remote possibility but one that would weigh heavily on the client if it materialized. Second, the arbitrator, an autonomous decision maker who is not bound by formal laws, could easily decide that my client is greedy and is entitled to nothing. It is not implausible for an arbitrator to rationalize that my client violated the mythical ‘spirit of the rule’ doctrine by exploiting the promotion. While I vehemently disagree with that logic, I recognize that an arbitrator can decide anyway he or she chooses without having to cite reasons for doing so when issuing the award. Finally, if we did prevail, it is very likely that Citi, as is its right, would appeal the award. From there, we would have to start the process anew. \nThe Counter-Offer \nAfter going back and forth and forth and back, I thought I found a clever way out of this pickle. I called Citi’s attorney and proposed a settlement whereby the client’s ThankYou account would be temporarily restored. Citi would not have to pay more than the original $3,500 settlement amount and would not have to reopen the client’s credit cards. I even said that Citi would only have to put back a percentage of the points. Citi promptly rejected this offer. \nThe Settlement \nTwo weeks before the preliminary conference was set to take place, I countered with a final cash settlement amount that was higher than Citi’s original offer. A few days later, I received an email that Citi had accepted my offer. I found it quite interesting that Citi would rather pay more money than reissue points, something that was valuable to my client but has no inherent monetary value. \nUltimately, my client and I were simultaneously happy and disappointed that this case settled. We were happy because we took on Citi and received a decent settlement amount. We were disappointed because maybe we should have kept on going. Perhaps we could have won. Perhaps our defiance in victory or defeat would have sent a stronger message to Citi. \nThe Confidentiality Agreement \nIn most arbitration cases that settle, companies require the client to sign a confidentiality agreement. The companies request that the attorney do so as well. As a matter of principle, I refuse to sign these agreements . Had I done so, the general public would remain in the dark. Claimants would not know that it is possible to go up against corporate giants like Citi. They would have little or no insight regarding the intricacies of the arbitration process. Most importantly, they would have no idea that real results are possible. \nInitially, Citi refused to waive the confidentiality agreement as it pertained to me, something I felt was borderline unethical since the settlement agreement was between the client and Citi. I informed my client of this awkward situation and she told me to remain steadfast in my belief of not signing the confidentiality agreement. In the end, Citi capitulated to my demand so long as I did not disclose the exact amount of the settlement. While I would have liked to boast about how much money we received, it was more important for me to be able to share the details of how my client and I overcame Citi’s questionable behavior. It is my hope that more consumers will come forward and challenge not only Citi but other corporations that have a disproportionate amount of power over its customers. \nThe Way Forward \nEven though a class action is not possible against many corporations, filing numerous, meritorious claims against companies can crack the shield of invincibility as they will be forced to pay more in settlements and awards, more in attorney fees, all the while enduring negative publicity. With each claim that is settled or won, the voice of the consumer will grow louder while the avenues to escape liability will be shutdown, an ironic twist that is long overdue.",

However, recent changes in the industry are bullish. Slowing capacity growth from the largest carriers, gradually improving pricing, and amazingly easy revenue comps provide solid footing,\" analyst Kevin Crissey wrote in a note to clients Thursday. \n\"We think upside revenue surprises are possible, particularly as 2017 progresses.

      "text": "Stock Futures Edge Up : Marvell, Salesforce.com Rocket (Investor's Business Daily) \nCiti’s Paul Lejuez expressed concern regarding Gap Inc (NYSE: GPS ), saying that while the Gap brand was expected to continue to struggle, Old Navy was possibly over-earning. \nLejuez downgraded the rating on the company from Neutral to Sell, while lowering the price target from $27 to $25. Challenges \nThe analyst noted Q4 was off to a weak start , while “the prospect of lower taxes are unlikely to help GPS as much as other retailers.” \nThe Gap brand has been attempting a turnaround for at least 10 years now, having closed stores over the past 11 years. However, comps have declined for nine of the 11 years, while traffic has also decline each year. \nIn fact, Gap expects to close more stores than earlier predicted, along with a further decline in traffic during the important holiday shopping season. \n“With all its changes in leadership and merchandising strategy over the years, Gap has been losing customers/traffic over time, and in a tough competitive landscape, it makes the task of recapturing customers a significant challenge,” Lejuez believes. \nThe company announced the appointment of Teri List-Stoll on November 15 as its executive vice president and CFP, effective January 17, 2017. Other Headwinds \nAlthough Old Navy’s margins are expected in the mid-teens, well ahead of other apparel retailers in Citi’s coverage universe, these levels appear unsustainable given the rising competition. \nAmong the other headwinds facing the company are Gap’s performance in China, the stronger U.S. dollar, continued decline in traffic and the disruption due to the chief financial officer transition. \nIn Friday's pre-market session, Gap was down 8.04 percent at $28.24.

      "text": "Banks - Major Regional Industry Price Index \nImportant Developments of the Week 1. Post Brexit, Citigroup Inc. ( C - Free Report ) is formulating the relocation of up to 900 jobs from London to Dublin. This is part of the company’s contingency plan to deal with the growing uncertainties of Brexit. Citibank conducted a board meeting in Dublin last month and was trying to explore options for office space in the Irish capital. Per the UK head of Citi, regardless of what deal Britain will enter into for access to the financial services market in the European Union, jobs in London will be shifted to other countries. Notably, the UK Citi has 9,000 employees (read more: Citigroup to Relocate 900 Jobs from London to Dublin ).2. According to John Gerspach, Chief Financial Officer (CFO) of Citigroup, the U.S. lender might need to record $12 billion charge in profits if the federal corporate tax rates under President Donald Trump decline to 25% from the current rate of 35%. However, such charge can be around $4 billion if the rate reduces to 28% under a scenario where tax cuts are applied on more limited basis. Such charge will be recorded to reflect reduced values for the bank’s deferred tax assets (DTAs). Notably, about $7 billion of the DTAs are excluded from the bank's regulatory capital. Therefore, write off of more than this amount would impact the regulatory capital (read more: Citigroup Might Record $12B Charge on U.S. Tax Rate Cut ).3. Citigroup entered into an agreement to sell CitiFinancial, its subprime lending unit in Canada, to an investor group led by private investment firm, JC Flowers and Varde Partners. This is part of Citigroup’s strategy to emphasize on growth in core businesses through restructuring, expense management and streamlining operations internationally. The divestiture is subject to regulatory approvals and is anticipated to close in the first half of 2017. Moreover, the amount for the sale remained undisclosed. This transaction is not likely to affect Citi’s financials.4. Putting an end to almost a three-year old investigation, related to alleged violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), JPMorgan Chase & Co. ( JPM - Free Report ) has agreed to pay $246 million in aggregate to the U.S. regulators. The bank was accused of hiring the relatives of Chinese officials, with an aim to win banking deals. Of the total fine, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will get $130 million, the Department of Justice (DOJ) will receive $72 and the remaining amount will go the U.S. Federal Reserve. Notably, JPMorgan did not accept or deny any of the charges. Nonetheless, as part of its deal with the DOJ, a Hong Kong unit of the company acknowledged making quid pro quo hiring agreements with Chinese officials to secure businesses.5. The scandal ridden U.S. banking giant, Wells Fargo & Company ( WFC - Free Report ) faces another blow following exposure of the fraudulent sales scandal, this time striking its retail banking customer activity in October. The bank witnessed a yearly plunge of 44% in new account openings, along with a sequential fall of 27%. As expected, the decline was chiefly due to the full-month impact of customers’ reaction to the sales malpractices settlement announced on Sep 8, 2016, and lower marketing activities.

      "title": "Bank Stock Roundup: Trump Effect Makes Headlines, Citigroup in Focus",
      "text": "Banks - Major Regional Industry Price Index \nImportant Developments of the Week 1. Post Brexit, Citigroup Inc. C is formulating the relocation of up to 900 jobs from London to Dublin. This is part of the company's contingency plan to deal with the growing uncertainties of Brexit. Citibank conducted a board meeting in Dublin last month and was trying to explore options for office space in the Irish capital. Per the UK head of Citi, regardless of what deal Britain will enter into for access to the financial services market in the European Union, jobs in London will be shifted to other countries. Notably, the UK Citi has 9,000 employees (read more: Citigroup to Relocate 900 Jobs from London to Dublin ). 2. According to John Gerspach, Chief Financial Officer (CFO) of Citigroup, the U.S. lender might need to record $12 billion charge in profits if the federal corporate tax rates under President Donald Trump decline to 25% from the current rate of 35%. However, such charge can be around $4 billion if the rate reduces to 28% under a scenario where tax cuts are applied on more limited basis. Such charge will be recorded to reflect reduced values for the bank's deferred tax assets (DTAs). Notably, about $7 billion of the DTAs are excluded from the bank's regulatory capital. Therefore, write off of more than this amount would impact the regulatory capital (read more: Citigroup Might Record $12B Charge on U.S. Tax Rate Cut ). 3. Citigroup entered into an agreement to sell CitiFinancial, its subprime lending unit in Canada, to an investor group led by private investment firm, JC Flowers and Varde Partners. This is part of Citigroup's strategy to emphasize on growth in core businesses through restructuring, expense management and streamlining operations internationally. The divestiture is subject to regulatory approvals and is anticipated to close in the first half of 2017. Moreover, the amount for the sale remained undisclosed. This transaction is not likely to affect Citi's financials. 4. Putting an end to almost a three-year old investigation, related to alleged violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), JPMorgan Chase & Co. JPM has agreed to pay $246 million in aggregate to the U.S. regulators. The bank was accused of hiring the relatives of Chinese officials, with an aim to win banking deals. Of the total fine, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will get $130 million, the Department of Justice (DOJ) will receive $72 and the remaining amount will go the U.S. Federal Reserve. Notably, JPMorgan did not accept or deny any of the charges. Nonetheless, as part of its deal with the DOJ, a Hong Kong unit of the company acknowledged making quid pro quo hiring agreements with Chinese officials to secure businesses. 5. The scandal ridden U.S. banking giant, Wells Fargo & Company WFC faces another blow following exposure of the fraudulent sales scandal, this time striking its retail banking customer activity in October. The bank witnessed a yearly plunge of 44% in new account openings, along with a sequential fall of 27%. As expected, the decline was chiefly due to the full-month impact of customers' reaction to the sales malpractices settlement announced on Sep 8, 2016, and lower marketing activities. Price Performance The overall performance of banking stocks depicted a bullish stance. Here is how the seven major stocks performed: \nCompany",

      "text": "EPL on Citi FM: Yaya Toure the returning hero for Man City, Sunderland stun Hull By Talksport \nCrystal Palace 1-1 Manchester City Goalscorer for Man City: Yaya Toure 39', 83′ \nGoalscorer for Palace: Connor Wickham 66′ \nYaya Toure marked his first Premier League start under Pep Guardiola in predictable style. The Ivorian played a one-two with Nolito in the box, before side-footing the ball home in the 39th minute – the only shot on target– to send City into the dressing room a goal up after a pedestrian first half. \nThe Eagles, though, hit back with 66 minutes on the clock. Connor Wickham, brought on early on in the second period for Andros Townsend, comfortably got the better of Pablo Zabaleta, and unleashed a powerful effort that Claudio Bravo failed to stop at his near post. \nBut Toure was again on hand, grabbing his second of the game. The midfielder was left unmarked in the box and comfortably swept a low cross from Kevin De Bruyne into the back of the net to restore City’s lead, sending his side back to Manchester with three vital points. \nEverton 1-1 Swansea City Goalscorer for the Swans: Gylfi Sigurdsson (41' pen) \nGoalscorer for the Toffees: Seamus Coleman (89′) \nEverton have been struggling for consistency over the past two months, and looked a side well-short of confidence in the opening 45 minutes of play. The hosts had plenty of opportunities to open the scoring – including Romelu Lukaku firing over the bar from close range – but it was Gylfi Sigurdsson who drew first blood. The Iceland international converted from the penalty spot in the 41st minute after being brought down by Phil Jagielka. \nA chorus of boos accompanied the Toffees at the half-time break, and there was little response in the second half – until the 89th minute. Seamus Coleman was the hero, with the right-back looping a header over Łukasz Fabiański and into the top corner, \nSouthampton 0-0 Liverpool Jurgen Klopp’s troops dominated the first half, but were left frustrated by a stubborn Southampton side. Sadio Mane, who swapped St Mary’s for Anfield in the summer , had two glorious chances to opening the scoring, but was first denied by an excellent save from Fraser Forster, and second a superb last-ditch challenge by Virgil van Dijk. \nIt was the same after the break , with the Reds creating plenty of openings on goal, but failing to take advantage. Philippe Coutinho didn’t seem to be at his best, perhaps struggling from his exploits over the international break, and couldn’t influence proceedings as he has done. \nLiverpool had ample chances to strengthen their position at the top of the table, and will have to hope Middlesbrough do them a favour against Chelsea tomorrow evening. \nStoke City 0-1 Bournemouth Goalscorer for the Cherries: Nathan Ake (26') \nNathan Ake, on loan from Chelsea, marked his top flight debut for the Cherries with the opening goal at the bet365 Stadium. The 21-year-old rose highest to meet Erik Pieters superb free-kick, heading Bournemouth deservedly in front. \nBojan Krkić had the chance to equalise early on in the second half from the penalty spot, but his effort crashed off the crossbar and away from danger. \nThe Potters failed to hit back to Ake’s opener, suffering their first defeat since their 4-1 loss to Crystal Palace in September. \nSunderland 3-0 Hull City Goalscorers for the Black Cats: Jermain Defoe (34'), Victor Anichebe (62′, 84′) \nDefoe – as if it has really been in doubt – proved he's still got it at the age of 34. The striker eased his way past three Tigers defenders, creating space for the shot, and left David Marshall with no chance of stopping his spectacularly-taken 150th Premier League goal. \nAnd it looked be the Black Cats’ day when Victor Anichebe received the ball from Patrick van Aanholt in the box, making space for himself and sending a low drive into the back of the net, doubling Sunderland’s lead with just over an hour played. \nAnichebe later grabbed his second (honestly!) to cap off a miserable afternoon for Mike Phelan and his troops, who failed to kick on from their win over Southampton in their previous league fixture. \nWatford 2-1 Leicester City Goalscorers for the Hornets: Etienne Capoue (1'), Roberto Pereyra (12') \nGoalscorers for the Foxes: Riyad Mahrez (15' pen) \nThe Hornets stormed out of the blocks at Vicarage Road, with Etienne Capoue taking only seconds after the whistle had been blown to put his side ahead, before Roberto Pereyra unleashed a stunning curled effort little over 10 minutes later. \nRiyad Mahrez got a goal back for the defending Premier League champions with a quarter of an hour on the clock, from the penalty spot, which was to be the last of the frantic goalscoring antics. \nThe early strikes from Capoue and Pereyra sealed the victory for Watford, who just about deserved to seal the three points against Claudio Ranieri’s struggling title-defenders. \n–",

      "text": "EPL on Citi FM: Yaya Toure the returning hero for Man City, Sunderland stun Hull   5:19 pm \nCrystal Palace 1-1 Manchester City \nGoalscorer for Man City: Yaya Toure 39’, 83′ Goalscorer for Palace: Connor Wickham 66′ \nYaya Toure marked his first Premier League start under Pep Guardiola in predictable style. The Ivorian played a one-two with Nolito in the box, before side-footing the ball home in the 39th minute – the only shot on target– to send City into the dressing room a goal up after a pedestrian first half. \nThe Eagles, though, hit back with 66 minutes on the clock. Connor Wickham, brought on early on in the second period for Andros Townsend, comfortably got the better of Pablo Zabaleta, and unleashed a powerful effort that Claudio Bravo failed to stop at his near post. \nBut Toure was again on hand, grabbing his second of the game. The midfielder was left unmarked in the box and comfortably swept a low cross from Kevin De Bruyne into the back of the net to restore City’s lead, sending his side back to Manchester with three vital points. \nEverton 1-1 Swansea City \nGoalscorer for the Swans: Gylfi Sigurdsson (41’ pen) Goalscorer for the Toffees: Seamus Coleman (89′) \nEverton have been struggling for consistency over the past two months, and looked a side well-short of confidence in the opening 45 minutes of play. The hosts had plenty of opportunities to open the scoring – including Romelu Lukaku firing over the bar from close range – but it was Gylfi Sigurdsson who drew first blood. The Iceland international converted from the penalty spot in the 41st minute after being brought down by Phil Jagielka. \nA chorus of boos accompanied the Toffees at the half-time break, and there was little response in the second half – until the 89th minute. Seamus Coleman was the hero, with the right-back looping a header over Łukasz Fabiański and into the top corner, \nSouthampton 0-0 Liverpool \nJurgen Klopp’s troops dominated the first half, but were left frustrated by a stubborn Southampton side. Sadio Mane, who swapped St Mary’s for Anfield in the summer , had two glorious chances to opening the scoring, but was first denied by an excellent save from Fraser Forster, and second a superb last-ditch challenge by Virgil van Dijk. \nIt was the same after the break , with the Reds creating plenty of openings on goal, but failing to take advantage. Philippe Coutinho didn’t seem to be at his best, perhaps struggling from his exploits over the international break, and couldn’t influence proceedings as he has done. \nLiverpool had ample chances to strengthen their position at the top of the table, and will have to hope Middlesbrough do them a favour against Chelsea tomorrow evening. \nStoke City 0-1 Bournemouth \nGoalscorer for the Cherries: Nathan Ake (26’) \nNathan Ake, on loan from Chelsea, marked his top flight debut for the Cherries with the opening goal at the bet365 Stadium. The 21-year-old rose highest to meet Erik Pieters superb free-kick, heading Bournemouth deservedly in front. \nBojan Krkić had the chance to equalise early on in the second half from the penalty spot, but his effort crashed off the crossbar and away from danger. \nThe Potters failed to hit back to Ake’s opener, suffering their first defeat since their 4-1 loss to Crystal Palace in September. \nSunderland 3-0 Hull City \nGoalscorers for the Black Cats: Jermain Defoe (34’), Victor Anichebe (62′, 84′) \nDefoe – as if it has really been in doubt – proved he’s still got it at the age of 34. The striker eased his way past three Tigers defenders, creating space for the shot, and left David Marshall with no chance of stopping his spectacularly-taken 150th Premier League goal. \nAnd it looked be the Black Cats’ day when Victor Anichebe received the ball from Patrick van Aanholt in the box, making space for himself and sending a low drive into the back of the net, doubling Sunderland’s lead with just over an hour played. \nAnichebe later grabbed his second (honestly!) to cap off a miserable afternoon for Mike Phelan and his troops, who failed to kick on from their win over Southampton in their previous league fixture. \nWatford 2-1 Leicester City \nGoalscorers for the Hornets: Etienne Capoue (1’), Roberto Pereyra (12’) Goalscorers for the Foxes: Riyad Mahrez (15’ pen) \nThe Hornets stormed out of the blocks at Vicarage Road, with Etienne Capoue taking only seconds after the whistle had been blown to put his side ahead, before Roberto Pereyra unleashed a stunning curled effort little over 10 minutes later. \nRiyad Mahrez got a goal back for the defending Premier League champions with a quarter of an hour on the clock, from the penalty spot, which was to be the last of the frantic goalscoring antics. \nThe early strikes from Capoue and Pereyra sealed the victory for Watford, who just about deserved to seal the three points against Claudio Ranieri’s struggling title-defenders. \n–",

      "text": "Angry Woyome, aides, storm Citi FM studio By CitiFMonline \nThe unexpected happened today [Saturday] at the studios of private radio station Citi FM when businessman, Alfred Agbesi Woyome, the man at the centre of the controversial GHC 51 million judgement debt stormed the station in the morning. \nA visibly upset Alfred Woyome entered the studio just when panellists on Citi FM’s News Analysis Programme ‘The Big Issue’, the Executive Director of IMANI Ghana; Franklin Cudjoe, a member of the NPP and Legal Practitioner; John Kumah, and member of the Progressive People's Party (PPP), Richard Amoah were sharing their varied opinions on the judgement debt and his alleged role in the saga. \nAccording to him, he was compelled to drive to the station because he was unhappy with comments by the panelists on the matter. \nHe was accompanied by two of his aides, one of whom got into a heated altercation with the Producer of the Show and the Operations Manager of the station. \nThe aide attempted to smash the Operations Manager’s camera claiming he was taking photos of his misbehaviour. \nThis was about an hour after he had been interviewed live on the same show by host, Umaru Sanda Amadu on a press conference he organised yesterday [Friday]. \nIt took the intervention of the police to calm tempers after they were called in. \nBackground Alfred Agbesi Woyome had this past week accused the Supreme Court of persecuting him following its approval for him to be orally examined by former Attorney General, and anti-corruption campaigner, Martin Amidu. \nMr. Woyome was paid GHc 51 million after he claimed that he helped Ghana to raise funds to construct stadia for purposes of hosting the 2008 African Nations Cup. \nHowever an Auditor General's report released in 2010 said the amount was paid illegally him and subsequently, the Supreme Court in 2014 ordered Mr. Woyome to pay back the money after Mr. Amidu challenged the legality of the payments in court. \nSome efforts by the Attorney General to retrieve the GHc51 million, including selling his property to defray the debt, proved futile. \nIn 2016, the AG's department, led by the Minister for Justice, Marietta Brew Appiah-Oppong, decided to discontinue an application to examine the one-time NDC financier orally because it was considering a possible settlement with the defendant. \nBut this compelled Mr. Amidu to return to court to seek his eventually successful order to examine Mr. Woyome. \n–",

While there are many other cards with 0% intro APRs, Simplicity’s 21-month 0% intro APR is the longest of any card we’ve reviewed, and it offers a terrific no-fee policy to boot. Although we don’t recommend spending more than you can afford, Citi Simplicity can help with the purchases you need to make now but may not be able to pay for right away, allowing you to avoid any interest fees for 21 months. You can also transfer balances from other high interest rate cards onto Simplicity to eliminate interest you’re already paying for 21 months. \nBelow we take a closer look at Citi Simplicity to help you decide if it’s the right card for you. In short, this is a great 0% intro APR card that could save you some serious money in interest and fees as well as give you the time to pay down your purchases and balance transfers. Our full analysis is below. The Highlights \nRight out of the gate, Citi Simplicity ‘s biggest attraction is its incredibly long 21-month 0% intro APR for both purchases and balances transfers . Twenty-one months is the longest 0% intro APR period we’ve seen on a major credit card. In fact, with Citi Simplicity you can literally pay no interest until 2018, which is pretty incredible. This is a great perk if you want to make any big or small purchases, as you’ll have until 2018 to pay them off without paying a dime in interest fees. It’s almost like a free (or 0%) loan on purchases you make now, as you won’t have to pay anything for 21 months and if you pay them down completely you won’t pay anything except the actual cost of the purchase. \nno late fees and no penalty rates . That means if you happen to be late on a monthly payment or two Citi Simplicity won’t charge you a late fee, and they won’t penalize you with a higher interest rate (of course, you’ll be paying 0% interest for the first 21 months, but after that time period you won’t be penalized with an increased interest rate). Plus there is no annual fee to worry about. Both these perks together, along with the 21-month 0% APR make this a standout card. \n0% intro APR for 21 months on balance transfers . You can transfer you balance(s) from other high-interest credit cards and save a ton of money on interest fees as you won’t be paying any until 2018. And because the 0% intro APR is 21 months long, you’ll have a generous amount of time to gradually pay down your balance. \nonly requires good credit , which is generally considered to be a credit score above 670. So if have some dings in your credit history, you may still qualify for all the great 0% intro APR perks this card offers. \n’s chip-enabled card means it will be accepted outside the U.S. Embedded EMT technology is typically mandatory in international countries, and the fact that Citi Simplicity provides it means you can make purchases knowing your card will be accepted. \nCiti Diamond Preferred Card , is the only other card we review that matches Simplicity’s 21-month 0% intro APR, and it also has a slightly lower ongoing APR. The downside is it does not have Simplicity’s no late fee and no penalty APR policies, but if you are confident you’ll make all your payments on time, it is probably a better choice. \n’s 21-month 0% intro APR is outstanding, if you are planning to transfer a balance from another card there is a 3% balance transfer fee to consider. This fee can add up, but for most people it’s worth it and they will still save money over the course of an interest-free 21 months (to see for sure check out our free Balance Transfer Calculator ). If a balance transfer fee is a no-go for you, take a look at the Chase Slate card. Slate has a slightly shorter     purchases, but makes up for it with absolutely no balance transfer fees (if you transfer your balances in the first 60 days) and no annual fee. \n3% foreign transaction fee . If this is a deal-breaker, take a look at the Discover it – Balance Transfer Card . It doesn’t have any foreign transaction fees, offers an   transfers, features cash back rewards and has no annual fee. \ndoesn’t offer rewards . If you really want a 0% intro APR card that does, we recommend Chase Freedom . With an $150 intro bonus, 5% cash back in rotating categories and 1% back on everything else, a 15-month 0% intro APR, and no annual fee, this might be a better choice for you. \nCiti Simplicity is a terrific card to have in your wallet. This is particularly true if you are planning to make some large or small purchases and want the cushion of a 21-month 0% intro APR to help pay them off without paying any interest. It’s also a good choice if you’re carrying balances on high-interest credit cards and are looking for a solution to pay them down interest-free. Plus, Citi Simplicity is available to those with just good credit and has no annual fee, no late fees and no penalty rates. And Citi Simplicity’s chip-enabled card means you can use your card overseas. On the flip side, if you’re concerned about balance transfer fees, foreign transaction fees or earning rewards you might want to get one of the cards mentioned above. Overall, we highly recommend Citi Simplicity and think it’s a smart choice. \n’s alone, not those of the credit card issuer, and have not been reviewed, approved or otherwise endorsed   This content was accurate at the time of this post, but card terms and conditions may change at any time.

      "text": "Dubai: Capital markets activity, particularly debt issuance and mergers and acquisitions are expected to pick up pace in the Gulf Cooperation Countries (GCC) next year in the context of low oil prices warranting regional governments to raise funds in the market, according to Citigroup officials.\n“We expect to see growing business in the Middle East, particularly from the oil exporting countries where capital raising is picking momentum as both governments and private sector entities are raising funds to meet the funding shortage resulting from low oil prices. We expect to see a second consecutive year of record capital markets business from the region,” said Jim Cowles, EMEA CEO of Citi.\nCitigroup along with HSBC and JPMorgan Chase & Co were joint global coordinators of the recent record $17.5 billion (Dh64.2 billion), Saudi Arabia bond issue, the biggest ever bond sale from an emerging-market nation.\nThe success of the Saudi bond deal which attracted $67 billion of offers is expected to help encourage more regional sovereigns, government related entities, private companies and financial institutions to sell bonds in the coming year, he said.\nCiti analysts said the demand side of bond issuance from the region is expected be supported by yield-thirsty fixed income investors seeking to invest in high-grade GCC sovereign and corporate bonds while the supply side will be supported by sovereigns seeking to bridge budget deficits. \nIn 2016, apart from the record Saudi issuance, other prominent issuances included the $5 billion bond by the Abu Dhabi Government in April; $9 billion by the Qatar Government in May; and $3 billion by the Oman Government in June. All of these issuances were oversubscribed by the investors.\nLow crude prices \nTight liquidity in the banking sector has increased fund raising demand from both regional banks and corporates to raise funds through both debt capital market and global loan syndication market. Deal flows are expected to rise from these segments in 2017.\n“Low crude prices have triggered efforts towards spending cuts, privatisation and consolidation among state-owned firms. We expect to see demand for market funding growing from sovereigns, government related entities and the private sector in the year ahead,” said Cowles.\nLower equity valuations combined with the need to reduce overheads, many companies and government owned entities from the region are exploring M&A opportunities. Abu Dhabi said in June it plans to merge sovereign investment fund Mubadala Development Co with International Petroleum Investment Co. That followed a plan to combine its two largest lenders, National Bank of Abu Dhabi PJSC and First Gulf Bank. Investment banking circles indicate that more such transactions are in the pipeline.\nThe value of announced Mergers and Acquisitions [M&A] transactions with any Middle Eastern involvement reached $33.7 billion during the first nine months of 2015, 23 per cent more than the value registered during the same period in 2014 and marking the best annual start since 2010 according to estimates from Thomson Reuters and Freeman Consulting. Data showed that fees from completed M&A transactions totalled $177.6 million accounting for 37 per cent of the overall Middle Eastern investment banking fee pool, the highest first nine month share since records began in 1980.\nGlobal investors \nCitigroup projects about 30 per cent recovery in crude prices to above $60 a barrel in 2017. With the recent recovery in oil prices credit default swaps (the cost to insuring debt) of many oil exporters from GCC have improved and this is expected to attract global investors to regional debt instruments.\nOverall, Saudi Arabia bond issue attracted about $67 billion from nearly 1,700 orders. The widespread demand enabled the government to reduce the bonds’ yields to below initial marketing levels. The 10-year bond was sold at a yield of 3.407 per cent, while the 30-year issue was sold at 4.623 per cent.",

Most of us just file them, but bloggers read every word to see what perks they have cut or “enhanced” away from us. This one seemed very confusing from my Citi Prestige card but I did not find anything bad either. Well take a look what I got in e-mail the next day: Thank you for ThankYou! \nI guess they felt bad about sending stuff that they should not have and sent me 1000 ThankYou points (worth at least $10) for the issue. OK thank you for ThankYou points! \nIf you did not get the points e-mail but did either in snail mail or e-mail get the fake change of Card Member Agreement changes you may want to follow up and see if you too are going to get 1000 points for the issue! 🙂 – René Related",

      "text": "By Shuli Ren After breaking the long-term resistance level of 100, the dollar rally last week has prompted Citi Research to update its currency forecasts over the weekend. The bank now sees the dollar index to rise another 7% in the next 6 to 12 months.\nThe Japanese yen will likely fall to 115 per dollar, according to analyst Jeremy Hale and team:\nLong yen was a crowded trade this year Citi Research The surprise outcome of the US Presidential election has propelled USD/JPY higher sharply over recent session, with the cross taking out important resistance levels and trading up to over 110 after hovering near the important psychological 100 level only a few weeks back.\nHeading into the election, very stretched net long positioning on the JPY side (Figure 10) is surely one factor to consider – yen longs are near all time highs and almost a standard deviation stretched in their own historic backdrop. Further unwinds are likely to matter in the short term.\nBut of course the underlying paradigm shift to consider under Trump is that of US fiscal policy (see Overview). Under our revised base case, this likely means a broadly stronger greenback, with higher yields and a hawkish Fed important.\nEspecially for the yen, given its safe haven status, a combination of higher yields and better risk appetite lend supports to further USD/JPY upside. Indeed, note how the cross is seemingly lagging behind these two drivers considerably.\nWhile the Federal Reserve is poised to raise rates in December, accelerating an increase in US Treasury bond yields, the Bank of Japan is walking the other way. Last week, BoJ offered to buy “unlimited” medium-term bonds to keep its target of 10-year Japanese bond yields at 0%.\nIs Japan’s worst trouble over? This morning, the Nikkei 225 has risen 5% since Trump won. Year-to-date, the iShares MSCI Japan ETF (EWJ) rose 2.7%, the WisdomTree Japan Hedged Equity Fund (DXJ) fell 4.5%, the Powershares DB US Dollar Index Bullish Fund (UUP) advanced 2.1%.",

REUTERS/Dylan Martinez/File Photo A \nLONDON: Citi joined JPMorgan as the world's most systemically important banks, replacing HSBC in a group of 30 lenders who must hold extra capital from 2019 to preserve financial stability. \nThe group of 20 economies (G20) agreed after the 2007-09 financial crisis that top lenders, whose size and complexity means that a collapse could wreak havoc in markets, should hold extra capital, according to the level of risk they present. \nIn the annual update of rankings published on Monday by the Financial Stability Board (FSB), Citi has replaced HSBC in the top \"bucket\" of a 2.5 percent capital surcharge on top of the global minimum requirements. \nHSBC joins Bank of America, BNP Paribas and Deutsche Bank in the next category down, with a surcharge of 2 percent. \nThe FSB, a G20 regulatory task force, also updated its list of 9 globally systemically important insurers, which was unchanged from last year. \n(Reporting by Huw Jones, editing by Carolyn Cohn) - Reuters",

Learn more... \nMon, Nov 21, 2016, 10:50 GMT - UK Markets close in 5 hrs 40 mins Citi and JPMorgan top list of globally systemic banks Reuters - UK Focus – 19 minutes ago \n(Adds more detail) \nBy Huw Jones \nLONDON, Nov 21 (Reuters) - Citi has joined JPMorgan at the top of global regulators' list of systemically important banks, replacing HSBC and meaning the U.S. bank will have to hold extra capital from 2019 to help preserve financial stability. \nThe group of 20 economies (G20) agreed after the 2007-09 financial crisis that top banks, whose size and complexity mean a collapse could wreak havoc in markets, should hold extra capital, according to the level of risk they present. \nMembers of the list of 30 lenders will also have to begin holding bonds from 2019 that can be written down to help replenish capital that is burnt through in a crisis. \nIn the annual update of rankings published on Monday by the G20's Financial Stability Board (FSB), Citi has replaced HSBC in the top \"bucket\" facing a 2.5 percent capital surcharge on top of global minimum requirements. \nNo lender joined or dropped out of the top 30 list this year. \nLenders on the list typically already meet or exceed the amount of capital they must hold due to pressure from regulators and markets to dispel any doubts about their resilience. \nHSBC joins BNP Paribas (LSE: 0HB5.L - news ) and Deutsche Bank (IOB: 0H7D.IL - news ) in the next category down, with a surcharge of 2 percent. Bank of America (Swiss: BAC-USD.SW - news ) rose a category to join them. \nBarclays (LSE: BARC.L - news ) dropped a category to the 1.5 percent surcharge group. Industrial and Commercial Bank of China and Wells Fargo (Swiss: WFC-USD.SW - news ) rose a category to join the UK bank. \nMorgan Stanley (Xetra: 885836 - news ) fell a category to the 1 percent surcharge group. \nThe FSB is also due to agree a higher leverage ratio for the 30 lenders. \nThe ratio, a broad measure of capital to non-risk-weighted assets, has been set at a minimum of 3 percent for all other banks across the world. \nThe FSB has yet to decide if the 30 should be subject to the same leverage ratio \"surcharge\" or whether it too should adopt a \"bucket\" approach. \nThe watchdog also updated its list of nine globally systemically important insurers, which was unchanged from last year. \nInsurers still on the list in 2017 will be required to comply with tougher \"loss absorbency\" requirements from January 2019. \nThe list comprises Aegon (Swiss: AGN.SW - news ) , Allianz (Swiss: ALV-EUR.SW - news ) , AIG, Aviva (Other OTC: AIVAF - news ) , Axa (Paris: FR0000120628 - news ) , MetLife (NYSE: MET - news ) , Ping An (HKSE: 2318-OL.HK - news ) , Prudential Financial (NYSE: PJH - news ) , and Prudential (HKSE: 2378.HK - news ) . \nThe FSB's latest list makes no mention of reinsurers, a category still being considered for inclusion. \nGlobal insurance regulators have said they may take into account the activities of insurers when they decide if they are globally systemic, rather than just focusing on size and global reach. \nMetLife, the biggest U.S. life insurer, has also been designated as systemically important by the Financial Stability Oversight Council, made up of the heads of U.S. financial regulators. \nThe company is fighting the U.S. designation in the country's courts.

But it made seven changes to the \"buckets\" that determine the surplus capital banks must hold. \nPolicymakers and regulators said after the 2008/09 financial crisis that the world's biggest banks would have to hold more capital than smaller rivals to better protect savers and taxpayers. They said the top banks, dubbed G-SIBs, needed to hold an extra layer of capital on top of the minimum levels, based on their size and complexity. \nUnder the latest list, Citigroup and JP Morgan are considered the biggest and most complex banks and are in the bucket requiring them to hold an extra 2.5% of capital. In all previous years HSBC and JP Morgan had been the only two banks in that bucket. \nThe FSB said HSBC now only has a capital surplus requirement of 2%. \nBAML also needs to hold an extra 2% of capital, up from 1.5% previously. Remaining in the 2% surcharge bucket are BNP Paribas (LSE: 0HB5.L - news ) and Deutsche Bank (IOB: 0H7D.IL - news ) . \nThe FSB said Wells Fargo and Industrial & Commercial Bank of China now need to hold an extra 1.5% of capital, up from 1% previously. \nBarclays now needs to hold 1.5% extra capital, down from 2%, and Morgan Stanley an extra 1%, from 1.5% previously. \nThe changes in capital requirements can be significant. Having to hold extra capital on a big global balance sheet can be costly for banks. \nAs well as higher capital buffer requirements, G-SIBs are also subject to stricter rules on total loss-absorbing capital, resolution and recovery, and supervision. \nThe list of G-SIBs can be seen here: http://www.fsb.org/wp-content/uploads/2016-list-of-global-systemically-important-banks-G-SIBs.pdf \n(Reporting by Steve Slater) Black Friday is looming large so here's 5 top tips to ensure you get a bargain not a headache Yahoo Finance UK - 24 minutes ago Black Friday is looming large at the end of the week with retailers gearing up for a £3 billion-plus shopping frenzy. … More » Africa's largest economy is stuck in a painful recession Business Insider UK Finance - 50 minutes ago Africa's biggest economy Nigeria is stuck in a painful recession with no end in sight, according to the latest official data released on Monday.

Citi joined JPMorgan as the world's most systemically important banks, replacing HSBC in a group of 30 lenders who must hold extra capital from 2019 to preserve financial stability. \nThe group of 20 economies (G20) agreed after the 2007-09 financial crisis that top lenders, whose size and complexity means that a collapse could wreak havoc in markets, should hold extra capital, according to the level of risk they present.\nIn the annual update of rankings published on Monday by the Financial Stability Board (FSB), Citi has replaced HSBC in the top \"bucket\" of a 2.5 percent capital surcharge on top of the global minimum requirements.\nHSBC joins Bank of America, BNP Paribas and Deutsche Bank in the next category down, with a surcharge of 2 percent.\nThe FSB, a G20 regulatory task force, also updated its list of 9 globally systemically important insurers, which was unchanged from last year.\n ",

      "text": "Citi and JPMorgan top list of globally systemic banks Stock Markets 25 minutes ago (Nov 21, 2016 05:33AM ET) This article has already been saved in your Saved Items © Reuters. A man walks into the JP Morgan headquarters at Canary Wharf in London \nBy Huw Jones \nLONDON (Reuters) - Citi has joined JPMorgan (NYSE: JPM ) at the top of global regulators' list of systemically important banks, replacing HSBC and meaning the U.S. bank will have to hold extra capital from 2019 to help preserve financial stability. \nThe group of 20 economies (G20) agreed after the 2007-09 financial crisis that top banks, whose size and complexity mean a collapse could wreak havoc in markets, should hold extra capital, according to the level of risk they present. \nMembers of the list of 30 lenders will also have to begin holding bonds from 2019 that can be written down to help replenish capital that is burned through in a crisis. \nIn the annual update of rankings published on Monday by the G20's Financial Stability Board (FSB), Citi has replaced HSBC in the top \"bucket\" facing a 2.5 percent capital surcharge on top of global minimum requirements. \nNo lender joined or dropped out of the top 30 list this year. \nLenders on the list typically already meet or exceed the amount of capital they must hold due to pressure from regulators and markets to dispel any doubts about their resilience. \nHSBC joins BNP Paribas (PA: BNPP ) and Deutsche Bank (DE: DBKGn ) in the next category down, with a surcharge of 2 percent. Bank of America (NYSE: BAC ) rose a category to join them. \nBarclays (LON: BARC ) dropped a category to the 1.5 percent surcharge group. Industrial and Commercial Bank of China and Wells Fargo (NYSE: WFC ) rose a category to join the UK bank. \nMorgan Stanley (NYSE: MS ) fell a category to the 1 percent surcharge group. \nThe FSB is also due to agree a higher leverage ratio for the 30 lenders. \nThe ratio, a broad measure of capital to non-risk-weighted assets, has been set at a minimum of 3 percent for all other banks across the world. \nThe FSB has yet to decide if the 30 should be subject to the same leverage ratio \"surcharge\" or whether it too should adopt a \"bucket\" approach. \nThe watchdog also updated its list of nine globally systemically important insurers, which was unchanged from last year. \nInsurers still on the list in 2017 will be required to comply with tougher \"loss absorbency\" requirements from January 2019. \nThe list comprises Aegon, Allianz (DE: ALVG ), AIG, Aviva (LON: AV ), Axa, MetLife (NYSE: MET ), Ping An, Prudential Financial (NYSE: PRU ), and Prudential (LON: PRU ). \nThe FSB's latest list makes no mention of reinsurers, a category still being considered for inclusion. \nGlobal insurance regulators have said they may take into account the activities of insurers when they decide if they are globally systemic, rather than just focusing on size and global reach. \nMetLife, the biggest U.S. life insurer, has also been designated as systemically important by the Financial Stability Oversight Council, made up of the heads of U.S. financial regulators. \nThe company is fighting the U.S. designation in the country's courts.
