      "text": "What is fire made of? Metro's citizen scientist answers a not-so-obvious question Share on Facebook By: Genna Buck Metro Published on If gravity has a downward force, why does the flame coming out of my lighter point upwards, even when I flip it upside-down? — Geoff Reading your questions (keep ‘em coming!) is a two-step process in my head. 1) Pssh! I can answer this in my sleep! Fire is a chemical reaction called oxidation, which releases the chemical energy stored in fuel (your lighter fluid) in the form of heat. Heat rises. Hence fire rises. BOOM. 2) Wait, what does that mean? What are flames , exactly? Heat is invisible. Fire must be made of something. When you generate a spark hot enough to burn lighter fluid (a.k.a. butane), the chemicals it’s made of start to break down. They react with the oxygen in the air and produce water and carbon dioxide (maybe a bit of other stuff, depending on additives). When molecules are heated past a certain point, they start to glow: emit energy in the form of visible light as well as heat. The materials released by the burning of butane are hot enough to glow. In science terms, they’re incandescent. That’s the flame you see. The flame heats the surrounding air, making it expand and become less dense. And, you’re right, Geoff: The downward pull of gravity is at work here. It draws colder, denser air from the room down to the base of the flame. This displaces the hot air, which rises. The upward flow of hot air makes the flame move upwards , regardless of the direction the lighter is pointing. I’m sure I was taught this at some point, but let’s just say it wasn’t burned into my brain. When I research your questions, I invariably find I know less than I think I do. Being science-minded means embracing your inner six-year-old and asking: But why? But why? But why, why, why? Editors' Picks ",

      "text": "Norb Tatro, a former local TV news producer and friend of mine, was recently cloned. On Facebook, that is.\nI know this because his cyber alter ego contacted me one evening with some \"happy\" news: He'd just won $250,000 from a new U.S. government/Facebook grant program. What's more, my name was also on a list of grant recipients.\nThe clone suggested we kibitz on the phone to discuss our shared good fortune.\nThat's when I caught on (yes, it took me a moment) to effectively respond, \"Yeah, thanks but no thanks.\"\nSoon after, I reached the real Norb, as did some other Facebook pals, to flag him. He and wife, Elaine Feldman, notified the social network and in a few hours the bogus site was removed, hopefully never to be seen again.\nPutting together the puzzle of Allstate's $1.4 billion tech warranty firm purchase Robert Reed Allstate, which makes most of its money on sure things like selling insurance policies on homes and autos, is making a $1.4 billion bet that a lot of folks also want to insure their cellphones, laptops, tablets and other digital wonders.\nThis week, Allstate announced it is acquiring SquareTrade,...\nAllstate, which makes most of its money on sure things like selling insurance policies on homes and autos, is making a $1.4 billion bet that a lot of folks also want to insure their cellphones, laptops, tablets and other digital wonders.\nThis week, Allstate announced it is acquiring SquareTrade,...\n(Robert Reed) This cloning episode got me thinking about some wider implications: While many individuals fall victim to expensive, disruptive and time-wasting cyberattacks, so do a lot of businesses. In fact, companies are increasingly up against new, more creative types of Internet hacking and are scrambling to defend themselves against online threats.\n\"Getting hit with some type of cybersecurity event is the new natural disaster for business. It can be catastrophic,\" says Rob Clyde, board director of Rolling Meadows-based ISACA, a nonprofit industry association for digital information and technology issues, including cybersecurity.\nA Facebook cloning or hacking attack could be devastating to a small-business operator, many of whom use the site to promote products, maintain business contacts and do bits of business.\nThink about it. There's an estimated 60 million small businesses with Facebook pages, according to Facebook.\nSuch a huge and growing universe is a natural target for hackers and ne'er-do-wells. Moreover, no matter how it tries, it's nearly impossible for Facebook to proactively monitor every post, piece of content and network activity on its site.\nAs such, entrepreneurs are often the first line of defense against a nefarious hacker infecting or hijacking their page. If something is wrong, small-business owners should quickly complain to Facebook.\nScam alert: This holiday, retailers expect many unhappy returns Robert Reed A holiday-related crime spree is ramping up and chances are you won't even notice, but many local shopkeepers already are standing guard.\nIt is called return fraud, and it's among the fastest-growing and most expensive problems confronted by stores of all types and sizes. Last year, return scams...\nA holiday-related crime spree is ramping up and chances are you won't even notice, but many local shopkeepers already are standing guard.\nIt is called return fraud, and it's among the fastest-growing and most expensive problems confronted by stores of all types and sizes. Last year, return scams...\n(Robert Reed) \"Claiming to be another person violates our community standards and we remove profiles reported to us that impersonate other people,\" a Menlo Park, Calif.-based Facebook spokeswoman said.\nOddly enough, targeting Facebook pages may become old-school, at least when it comes to online harassment of business, which is coping with a more emerging danger: Ransomware.\nIncidents of ransomware are \"just exploding\" says ISACA's Clyde.\nUsually, a hacker will use malware to infiltrate a poorly protected data site, capture sensitive files and literally hold them hostage in an encrypted form beyond the company's computer reach.\nOftentimes, the ransom is for a nominal amount, a few thousand dollars. The requested payoff can be made with the internationallyused bitcoins, which can signal the data kidnappers are an overseas gang, Clyde adds.\nCyber kidnappers also know something about customer service. Some will open a chat line with a company executive to help facilitate payment.\nIllinois companies see possibilities in Safe Roads Amendment, Trump infrastructure plans Robert Reed President-elect Donald Trump 's pledge to rebuild the country's multitude of highways, roads, bridges and dams is resonating with major Illinois business interests, which are mapping out their own infrastructure dreams.\nTrump's vow to invest $1 trillion over 10 years is placing infrastructure improvements...\nPresident-elect Donald Trump 's pledge to rebuild the country's multitude of highways, roads, bridges and dams is resonating with major Illinois business interests, which are mapping out their own infrastructure dreams.\nTrump's vow to invest $1 trillion over 10 years is placing infrastructure improvements...\n(Robert Reed) The FBI strongly urges companies not to pay and to report any ransomware threats to the agency and police. But it is not illegal to pay a ransom.\nAt risk are mid-sized enterprises, including law firms and health care concerns. Organizations become desperate to get back their data and justify the ransom as another cost of doing business in the Internet age.\n\"It's a nuisance fee and they pay it,\" Clyde adds.\nIf that seems odd to you, you're not alone.\nPaying off data kidnappers shouldn't be such a gray area. Yet it seems to be a grudging admission that our cyber cops are having trouble cracking down on tech-savvy crooks and that real-time business needs can outweigh the moral imperative of not encouraging criminal behavior.\nStill, anyone who has been victim of Internet scam artists realizes it pays to be resilient.\nCase in point: My friend Norb is back on Facebook.\nAnd hey, I'm still waiting for that $250,000 check.\nroreed@chicagotribune.com \nTwitter @reedtribbiz \nCopyright © 2016, Chicago Tribune Crime Kidnapping Cyber Crime Robert Reed",

      "text": "Facebook \nIf you ever plan to send your four legged friend on a trip you might want to avoid Mexico’s Interjet where you might find out that they lost your companion during loading but later offering a reward to get him back. \nThe airline had lost the animal which a passenger gave into their custody for transportation and then put out a ‘reward for finder’ ad without ever telling the owner that the dog was missing. \nGood news ahead: The dog was eventually found in Mexico City by their owners but the circumstances are questionable at best as you will see. \nI found this story while reading some articles on Travel + Leisure (access here ). \nAfter losing a dog in cargo and neglecting to inform its owner, Mexican airline Interjet posted a reward seeking the lost animal. The dog, named Mika, was found in Mexico City on Wednesday after it had been lost for two days. Interjet posted images of the dog with the hashtag #BuscandoMika (#LookingForMika) to social media, hung fliers around the city and offered $5,000 peso (US$250) reward. Alvarez and her husband, who live in Houston, immediately returned to Mexico City to look for her dog as soon as they were informed. Both Alvarez’s and Interjet’s posts were shared on social media thousands of times. After nearly two days of searching, Mika was found on Wednesday. Alvarez thanked the man who found Mika, Dr. Miguel Ángel Rodriguez, for “his real commitment to puppies.” The Humane Society of the United States strongly discourages travelers from flying with their pet in cargo. In addition to loss, animals can experience deprivation of oxygen or heat stroke in cargo hold. \nThe airline should have contacted the captain and the passenger while the flight was still on the ground. It sounds like the handlers who caused the problem weren’t brave enough to face the owners and explain how it happened. \nIt seems that Interjet took responsibility and tried their best to help the passengers out for whom it was a very sensitive issue (understandably). \nAs far as the recommendation goes not to let your dog travel in the cargo, sometimes you don’t have a choice. Especially when it’s a larger dog there is no choice other then let him fly in the cargo hold. Large animals are usually not allowed in the cabin unless certified as a support animal for the disabled (including emotional support animals in the U.S.). \nConclusion \nThankfully the dog was found and returned to the owners who were certainly happy to no end. \nThe fact that the handlers actually broke the carrier in which the dog was accommodated in shows you how rough things are being handled even when live animals are involved. I’d avoid to subject my pet to such a procedure whenever I had the choice.  ",

      "text": "Need a friendly ear and some direct advice for your survival pool picks? Friend me on Facebook . Or hit me up on Twitter @kevinkaduk . Let’s ride the roller coaster together.\nResources : Yahoo survival pool pick distribution • SurvivorGrid.com\nWeek 12’s biggest killer: Tampa Bay Buccaneers over Seattle Seahawks (2.07 percent of entries)\nWeek 12s biggest winner: New York Giants over Cleveland Browns (38.39 percent)\nTotal Week 12 eliminations : 3.01 percent of entries\nPerfect entries remaining on Yahoo : 13,061\nThere’s uneventful and then there’s frozen in carbonite field we saw in Week 12.\nOnly 3.11 percent of Yahoo users bit the dust, most of them thanks to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers beating the Seattle Seahawks in Florida. That one really shouldn’t have come as a surprise given the Seahawks’ injuries and travel schedule, but it was the only one that did any real damage.\nThe docile weekend put an end to a November that didn’t see any large-scale wipeouts. No week in the month saw more than 11 percent of users eliminated with Green Bay’s loss to Indianapolis in Week 9 being the biggest upset with just 7.16 percent of users.\nWill we finally see some movement now the calendar has flipped to December? Week 13 could lead to a few eliminations seeing as how the Cleveland Browns are finally on their bye week after 12 straight weeks of losing and the San Francisco 49ers head to Chicago for a coinflip game against the Bears.\nLet’s look at a few of the games you should be considering in Week 13:\nDenver Broncos over Jacksonville Jaguars\nYou know the old saying: When the Browns, Niners and Bears are out, pick against the Jags, they’ll never leave you in doubt. Or something to that effect.\nAbout 40 percent of Yahoo users are going with Denver on Sunday and that does require picking a road team. But we’re late enough in the season and know enough about all 32 teams that we can confidently start focusing on matchups instead of blanket survival pool rules.\nI can see why the Broncos are such an attractive pick. They haven’t attracted any real attention from the survivor crowd this year; their highest frequency came with 15 percent of the pool successfully picking them over the Chargers in Week 8. Plus, the 2-9 Jaguars have been just plain bad and the 7-4 Broncos are in desperate need of wins in the tight AFC West race (and overall playoff sprint) after that late loss to the Chiefs on Sunday night. If they don’t win here, they’re going to be in a lot of trouble.\nIt’s hard to imagine that defense won’t punish Blake Bortles from start to finish. But keep an eye on Broncos quarterback Trevor Siemian’s status. He didn’t practice on Wednesday with a sprained foot and the Jaguars did a passable imitation of a good defense in the first half against the Bills last Sunday. It’s one thing to go with a rock-solid pick on the road; it’s another to go with an offense that practiced with starting quarterback uncertainty half of the week.\nNew England Patriots over Los Angeles Rams\nIt should go without saying, but if you’re one of the five people* who haven’t picked the Patriots yet, stop reading the article and GO PICK THE PATRIOTS for guaranteed entry to Week 14. Yes, the Patriots still have four games after this one, but I don’t see a single lock worth saving them for.\n*It may seem like five people, but there’s actually at least 13 percent (~1,600 users) of the 13,000 people left in Yahoo pools who have held off on the Patriot so far because that’s how many had selected them by Wednesday afternoon.\nOakland Raiders over Buffalo Bills\nSpeaking of a good AFC West team that hasn’t been picked frequently, the 9-2 Oakland Raiders have been a virtual ghost on the survival pool picks distribution list. Their highest frequency was just 2.59 percent in a Week 2 loss against the Atlanta Falcons. So almost everyone still has the Raiders available on their boards.\nPlaying in a tough division has limited the Raiders’ appeal despite their great year. But now here we are with five weeks to go and the chances to pick the possible top seed in the AFC are dwindling. The Bills present a good chance here in Week 12 as does a visit from the Colts on Christmas Eve. Either game is going to come with some risk as the Bills and Colts aren’t exactly bottomfeeders, but I think you’re fine going with the Raiders for either game. (Personally, I’d keep the Raiders in my pocket for the Colts’ opportunity as the pickings in Week 16 might prove slim if you get that far.)\nRead More Green Bay Packers over Houston Texans\nI’m really kind of puzzled as to why only ~10 percent of picks are going with the Packers this weekend. I know Aaron Rodgers and Co. haven’t been what they’ve been in years past, but they’re coming off a good road win over the Philadelphia Eagles and they’re set to face a Houston Texans team that has score 16 offensive touchdowns all season. Last week I went with the Saints over the Rams based on one simple question: Do you really think Drew Brees is going to lose at home against Case Keenum? Same rule applies here: No way is Rodgers going to lose a December game at Lambeau to Brock Osweiler.\nIf you don’t pick the Packers here, they’re either going to sit on your shelf the final four weeks or you’ll have to play them at Chicago or at Detroit. I’d rather pick the home game.\nSeattle Seahawks over Carolina Panthers\nAbout nine percent of people are picking the Seahawks over the Panthers and I think that’s another head scratcher. Not only have these two teams played a lot of close games the past few years, but the Seahawks have been banged up, which caused them to lose at Tampa Bay last Sunday. The Los Angeles Rams come calling to Seattle in two weeks, so why not just wait for then?\nMy pick: Green Bay over Houston\nWho are you picking? Let me know in the comments below!\nAaron Rodgers led the Packers to a win on Monday night (AP) More",

      "text": "Who cares about your PSLE score on Facebook? It's the real story that matters AsiaOne | Ashley Tan and Grace Lau | Friday, Dec 2, 2016 Photo: Reuters Why ThisMatters Instead of reducing one's entire success story by simply drawing a tenuous link between his PSLE score and current success in life, it would perhaps be more meaningful to emphasise on the tenacious effort and process that went behind these success stories. \n\"You need to work hard now and complete all of your mock papers, because the four-letter-word is approaching.\" \nA Primary 6 pupil would likely have heard this line reiterated by teachers and parents alike multiple times. How or why the term \"four-letter-word\" was coined to describe the PSLE has never been explicitly explicated to any of us, but it always manages to elicit a range of responses from students - from deep, tired sighs, to an exchange of knowing glances, to exasperated eye rolls. \nBut the message has always remained crystal clear: The PSLE matters. \nThe gravity of one's PSLE results has constantly been stressed to the point where it is regarded as an unspeakable word of sorts, because the thought of not doing well is simply unbearable and better left unsaid. This is evidenced by the spike in teen suicides, where suicide prevention agency Samaritans of Singapore cited academic pressure as a common source of stress. \nAs in past years, the release of PSLE results has generated fervent and heated public debate, especially from netizens. \nA new \"movement\" was introduced - that of working adults posting their less satisfactory PSLE scores on Facebook while sharing their success stories. Some notable ones include posts made by National University of Singapore Associate Professor Syed Khairudin Aljunied and Benjamin Kheng from local band The Sam Willows . The point that they were trying to make was that success can still be achieved, regardless of one's academic record. \nIt is undeniable that those who do not score as well in the PSLE can move on to achieve great success in their lives, not just in terms of job standing, but also lead fulfilling lives that contribute back to society. \nHowever, posting one's PSLE scores online with the message that the three-digit number is insignificant and unimportant may be rather gratuitous. The truth of the matter is, one's aggregate score is important, and it would be unwise to mislead ourselves otherwise. \nWhile the current PSLE system may put \"late-bloomers at a disadvantage\" as mentioned by The Straits Times' senior education correspondent Sandra Davie, it is the only national standardised testing that places a measurement on a student's knowledge on the subject matter at hand, which will ultimately streamline him into a secondary school that is meant to best suit his abilities. \nHence, when a student does well for the PSLE and is admitted into the school that he believes will direct him towards his desired path, he gains an advantage in terms of opportunities and exposure provided. This then carves a smoother path to success with fewer fragments of rocky gravel. \nIt is fallacious and misleading to dismiss the idea that it is okay if you don't do as well as expected in the PSLE. The hard truth is that the exam IS important, and while one's success does not hinge entirely on the PSLE, we need to acknowledge that it does play a part in the success that he seeks, whatever it may be. \nBut to those who worked hard and obtained a score that fell short of your expectations, understand that you are not defined by your score. Your grades may be important, but what is even more vital is the kind of attitude that you choose to embody after this entire debacle. \nThose who posted their success stories on Facebook? They didn't succeed by cruising along once they received their PSLE results. They took a tumble, got up, dusted themselves off, and worked hard with an unquenchable fire in their eyes that thirsted for more. Because they knew what they were capable of, and what they could attain regardless of any digit that threatened to shackle and define them. \nSo, instead of reducing one's entire success story by simply drawing a tenuous link between his PSLE score and current success in life, it would perhaps be more meaningful to emphasise on the tenacious effort and process that went behind these success stories. \nOnly when the raw, unabridged stories are shared can they truly, and completely, inspire. \nAshley Tan and Grace Lau are secondary school students who are on job attachment at AsiaOne. \na1admin@sph.com.sg Be the first to post comment. follow us ",

      "text": "Home > How-To > How to download Facebook photos How to download Facebook photos November 30, 2016 6:00 PM Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends \nFacebook has put a big emphasis on multimedia in recent years, and it’s where most of us share photos and video online. The social network is free, simple, and doesn’t require us to spend any extra time sharing with friends because that’s what it’s made for. It’s estimated that more than 300 million photos are uploaded each day, making it one of the biggest online photo directories on the planet. \nMore: The art of the poke: A Facebook guide for the uninitiated \nGiven this sheer amount of photos on Facebook, it’s likely that you’ve uploaded a photo or two in the past, especially if you’ve used the service for a considerable amount of time or know people who may have included you in their own photos. But how do you retrieve said photos from Facebook if your computer crashes, or if you decide to deactivate your account and take a break? Well, we’ve come up with this handy guide to help you out. Downloading a single photo using Facebook \nBefore we delve into more advanced alternatives, it’s worth noting that there is an easy way to download your photos one-by-one, or a photo from a friend or Facebook group that catches your eye. To do so, click on the photo in your timeline and select Options in the menu bar that appears when you mouse over the image. Afterward, click Download and select a save location for the resulting file. It’s a pretty simple and quick way to download photos. \nOf course, this is not going to work well for the hundreds or thousands of images that you might have. For more involved projects, follow these simple ways to get it done quickly with a minimal amount of work.",

      "text": "Facebook twitter Google December 02, 2016 Cannae will try to prove propellentless propulsion in space in 2017 and has ambitious space probe designs with 33 years of constant acceleration to reach 3% of lightspeed Many remain unconvinced. Despite having a setup that has been pretty much operating for years, how many data points are in the paper? Eighteen. Now, if this were a really time-consuming experiment, I wouldn't let that bother me. Hell, some synchrotron experiments have only a single data point. But this is clearly not a time-limited experiment. The microwave was pulsed for about 40 seconds, and an entire data run seems to take about 200 seconds. Allowing five minutes between measurements, it should have been possible to record 12 data points for the same settings every hour. Indeed, although the researchers have numerous variables at their hands to change between experiments, they only play with one. In previous papers, they played with two, but still this limited exploration and limited data is really disheartening. Then there's the error analysis: the authors estimate many measurement uncertainties so that each thrust measurement has an uncertainty of about ten percent. That sounds brilliant, right? Except the authors ignore the main uncertainties. In one experiment at 60 Watts of microwave power, the authors measure thrust of 128 microNewtons, while all three data points for 80 Watts of microwave power have thrusts of less than 120 microNewtons. Indeed, the thrust at 60 Watts for all data overlaps pretty much perfectly for all data taken at 80 Watts. They can only claim a slope by turning the power down to 40 Watts, where they do consistently measure less thrust. The Cannae drive is also propellentless like the EMdrive but is a different design. They will test their system orbit in a cubesat in 2017 Cannae is not using an EmDrive thruster in their upcoming launch. Cannae is using it’s own proprietary thruster technology which requires no on-board propellant to generate thrust. In addition, this project is being done as a private venture. Cannae is only working with our private commercial partners on the upcoming mission. Theseus Space is going to be launching a demo cubesat (probably in 2017) which will use Cannae thruster technology to maintain an orbit below a 150 mile altitude. This cubesat will maintain its extreme LEO altitude for a minimum duration of 6 months. The primary mission objective is to demonstrate our thruster technology on orbit. Secondary objectives for this mission include orbital altitude and inclination changes performed by the Cannae-thruster technology. Cannae’s thruster technology is capable of generating thrust from a few uN up through several newton thrust levels and higher levels. The Cannae thruster technology is particularly useful for small satellite missions due to low power, mass and volume requirements. Our thruster configuration for the cubesat mission with Theseus is anticipated to require less than 1.5 U volume and will use less than 10 watts of power to perform station keeping thrusting. Once demonstrated on orbit, Theseus will offer their thruster platforms to the satellite marketplace Cannae is commercializing proprietary propulsion technology requiring no on-board propellant to generate thrust. The core of their technology uses the Lorentz Force imbalances created by their thrusters to create propulsion. Cannae has demonstrated 2 separate prototypes of a superconducting thruster which requires no dielectric material to generate thrust. Inventor, Guido Fetta, delivered a paper on superconducting prototype demonstration at the 2014 AIAA Joint Propulsion Conference. Cannae has since improved upon the initial design and has demonstrated improved thrust and performance of their superconducting prototype at their Pennsylvania test facility. Cannae is also commercializing a thruster that does not require superconducting operation in order to generate thrust. This thruster also requires no on-board propellant to generate a Lorentz Force imbalance. Cannae has demonstrated prototypes of this new thruster technology at our Pennsylvania test facility. Cannae has various deep space probes and space freighter designs if their in orbit tests work out The deep space probe concept vehicle outlined in this section is used to propel a scientific instrument and communication payload with a mass of 2000 kgs to a 0.1 light year (LY) distance in a 15 year time frame. This vehicle uses existing superconductor and vehicle subsystem technology performance levels. No improvements to technological performance levels are required to build the vehicle described in this section. There are 10 Cannae Drives included in the deep space probe design. 5 x 50 MHz Thruster cavities (continuously powered) 3 x 1 GHz Steering cavities (powered as needed) 2 x 1.5 GHz Roll-control cavities (powered as needed) The 5 Cannae Drive thruster cavities provide continuous acceleration of 8.66 x 10^-3 m/s2 to the probe . This is equivalent to accelerating at 1/1132 G. The small acceleration is constantly applied in one direction throughout the life time of the probe, continually increasing the velocity of the probe with respect to the Earth reference frame. The total thrust developed by the 5 thruster cavities is 85.5 newtons . The three medium sized Cannae Drive cavities provide steering for the probe. These cavities are intermittently powered to provide course corrections or for flight maneuvers. The two small Cannae Drive cavities are used to modulate the roll rate of the space probe. These cavities are also used intermittently. All of the Cannae Drives are fixed in position on the vehicle. This eliminates moving parts from the propulsion system, allowing for longevity of operation. Deep space probe cavity design The Cannae Drive cavities are manufactured of aluminum. Aluminum (or another appropriate alloy) is used to minimize the thruster system mass. A substrate layer is then coated on the inside of the cavity. A top coat of 400 nm YBCO layer is then deposited over the substrate layer. The thrusting cavities are designed with asymmetric features in areas of high electric field and in areas of high magnetic field. The average effective differential in axially-directed radiation pressure is 15% over the entire cross section of each thruster cavity. The unbalanced force developed in the thruster cavity is directed through the axial center of the 5 thruster cavities. The design maximum H-field on the top plate of the thruster cavity is 4000 A/m with nominal maximum operating H-field on the top plate of 3270 A/m. This relatively low field is used to prevent field emission in the areas of high E-field and to keep the ohmic losses in the regions of high H-field to a minimum. The Cannae Drive deep-space probe is designed to measure the environment of the interstellar medium. To do this, the vehicle is launched to LEO on a standard launch vehicle. The diameter of the probe in launch configuration is 4.8 meters with a height of 10 meters. These dimensions allow the probe to fit into a standard 5-meter launch vehicle fairing. Once the vehicle is in LEO, the thruster system is powered and the vehicle accelerates in the direction of its Earth orbit. This causes the probe to slowly spiral away from Earth until it eventually escapes into deep space. The probe continues to accelerate, increasing its velocity and overcoming the gravitational attraction of the Sun. The vehicle will reach escape velocity from the Sun without gravity assists in less than 2 months. During the LEO-to-solar-escape-velocity phase of the mission, a light-weight radiation shield is deployed to shield the thruster section of the probe from Earth’s thermal radiation and from solar radiation. Once the vehicle flight path is directed away from the Sun, the radiation shield is ejected from the probe. The temporary shielding is not depicted in Figure 1. The probe is designed to accelerate continuously throughout its operational life time. The mission duration is designed to be 15 years, with mission-life extensions probable. After 15 years of constant 8.65 x 10-3 m/s2 acceleration, the vehicle will reach a distance from Earth of 0.1 LY (approximately 600 billion miles). At 0.1 LY, the vehicle will be travelling at approximately 1.35 % the speed of light (c). At a 0.1 LY distance, it will require over 1 month to send or receive radio signals between the probe and Earth. For comparison, the Voyager 1 probe is currently travelling at 17.06 km/s. The Cannae-Drive-propelled, deep-space probe increases by the Voyager speed of 17.06 km/s every 23.1 days. Accelerating at design level, the Cannae-Drive-deep-space probe passes the Voyager distance from Earth (120 AU) within 2.0 years of probe launch. The Voyager required almost 35 years to reach this distance. Voyager 1 continues to increase its distance from Earth and will reach a distance of 0.1 LY in a total travel time of 1780 years. The Cannae Drive probe requires 15 years from launch to travel 0.1 LY and the thruster system uses less than 100 watts RF power to do so. For additional comparison, a propellant-based probe designed to accelerate a 2000 kg payload to a velocity of 1.35% c (the speed of the Cannae Drive probe when it passes 0.1 LY) would require a minimum of 1.8 x 1021 kgs of propellant. This calculation assumes a propellant specific impulse of 10,000 seconds with zero structural, propellant tank and power system mass (final vehicle mass is 2000 kgs). Assuming the propellant has a specific gravity of 1, this amount of propellant could cover the entire surface area of the Earth to a height of over 2 miles. If power and structural mass estimates for the propellant-based probe are included in the propellant-requirement calculation, the situation gets much worse. The Cannae Drive probe reaches a distance from Earth of 0.1 LY in 15 years. Because of the simplicity of design and lack of moving parts, it is anticipated that the vehicle will continue to accelerate and will continue to transmit data back to Earth. The Voyager and Pioneer deep-space probes have demonstrated that multi-decade missions are achievable. The RTG’s of the Cannae Drive probe are designed to deliver the power required to generate up to 100 watts of RF power to the thruster cavities. As RTG power levels drop below end-of-life design levels, RF power to the cavities will also drop below the 73 watt design level. As long as phase-locked power is sent to the thruster cavities, the probe will continue to accelerate. The acceleration of the probe is directly proportional to the RF power sent into the cavities. Given the proven longevity of RTGs in space applications, the Cannae Drive probe could continue to accelerate and send back data on the interstellar medium for decades. After 33 years of constant 8.66 x 10-3 m/s2 acceleration, the Cannae Drive probe will have crossed a distance of 0.5 LY from Earth while attaining a speed of approximately 3% of c. For deep-space applications, a Cannae Drive probe outperforms propellant-driven systems by orders of magnitude. Travel times and vehicle velocities that are impossible for propellant based systems are achievable with a Cannae Drive system. The Cannae Drive technology allows new deep-space missions that have previously existed only in science fiction. They have space freighter design hat is based on the reactionless thrust of the Cannae Drive. This freighter is a satellite that is launched to LEO on a standard 5 meter fairing launch vehicle. Once in orbit, the freighter is used to raise the orbits of other satellites that are already in a LEO orbit. The value of the freighter is that significant reductions in launch costs are achieved. Satellites that are destined for orbits higher than LEO require only the launch costs associated with the LEO launch. For larger GEO satellites, the launch cost savings can amount to greater than $200 million per satellite.

      "text": "By Christy Matte Updated January 05, 2016 . \nIf you spend any time on Facebook, you've seen them. They're the digital equivalent to chain letters, only worse. They're hoaxes and urban legends. Now, instead of the vague threat of \"bad luck,\" they convince people that they will win Walt Disney World vacations or a million dollars. Sometimes they tell us that all of our private data is about to be sold (too late) or that Pop Rocks and soda can kill you (Oh, wait, that was the '70's). Or maybe that there are hundreds of horses about to be put down if you don't adopt one RIGHT NOW. And, no matter how absurd the claims, people continue to cut and paste them into status updates. It's time to put an end to the madness. \nIf people stop reposting them, they will die away. But how do you know for sure that you aren't about to lose out on your million dollar share? Here are a few tips for stopping hoaxes and urban legends in their tracks. If It Seems Too Good to be True... \nI don't know how long the saying, \"If it seems to be too good to be true, it probably is\" has been around, but it is still excellent wisdom. \ncontinue reading below our video 7 Meals Kids Can Cook (and Why They Should) Your first clue that something is a hoax is that it's really amazing and perhaps a bit surreal. Can you win a million dollars by reposting a status message on your private Facebook page? No. Can you alter your privacy settings? Also no. In fact, if your Facebook page is private (as it should be), no one can see what you're posting other than your friends. And while Facebook can technically see what you're posting, they aren't supposed to be looking. In other words, they aren't going to award a prize that shows that they are spying on their users, even if they are. A Little Sleuthing of Your Own \nSometimes there are clues you can spot right away to know that something is false. One example is a giveaway by a Facebook page claiming to be Walt Disney World. Now, one thing to know is that major businesses and celebrities have the option of \"verifying\" their identities. Always look for verified pages. You can identify them by a little check mark. Some people are creative with their names, adding a subtle bit of punctuation to make it look like an official page, although it isn't. \nCheck for dates, locations, and other information that doesn't really make sense. And, quite simply, don't believe everything you read. There are a lot of people out there trying to manipulate public opinion with a well-placed, false, and inflammatory viral post. Hoax-Busters \nSo. You've applied your best common sense and done your homework, or maybe you haven't, but you still aren't quite sure if you should repost this message. Fair enough. Sometimes the messages seems legitimate. It's possible that Facebook will start charging a user fee or that Willie Nelson passed away in 2015 . Luckily, there are other folks doing their own research who can help you know if it's true, false, or somewhere in between. Before you click \"Share,\" visit one of these sites to help validate whatever claims are being made: Snopes \nIn the end, it's not always possible to quickly tell what's true and what isn't online. I have a bad habit of posting RIP messages for people who have died a year or so ago (to be fair, I still would like them to rest in peace). Still, a little bit of effort can help you from spreading a panic about Mars coming close to the earth or that Facebook is about to shut down entirely. And then we can get back to the joy of seeing what our friends had for dinner...",

      "text": "Hey guys !\n\nSome will maybe disagree but I think there is great potential about adding random girls (obviously, 7's/8's and plus) in Facebook. Especially since my name/style seem so different from the country where I am living (Colombia) and can thus attract attention.\n\nWhat I do is basically find a random profile in the age range / education level that interests me. Then, check all the friends list and try to add the most interesting ones. (At least half the girls hide their friend list though, but still a lot are not clever enough to do it).\n\nI have started to do it but as I am using my personal account, I of course don't want to have problems with Facebook and be seen as ''adding people randomly and abusively''. Anyone has an idea of what is an acceptable daily adding number tries ? Is this anywhere in the terms and conditions ? 10 a day ? 50 a day?\n\nThanks dudes ! Once again, really don't want Facebook to automatically consider my moves as illegal or something. ",

I have a habit of setting up addresses e.g. when starting up a business, or for various purposes. The same applies to Facebook, where I set up an original accouNt in a short name but couldn't close it as I couldn't remember the log in info. I now have a proper Facebook account but the old on is still sitting there. How can I check as I need to delete any old accounts that are doing nothing... please advise. Thanks! Amber101",

(Photo: Todd McInturf/The Detroit News) Buy Photo \nWaterford Township — Fourteen-year-old Simone is spending her holidays this year with a foster family since state officials removed her from her home. When she wakes up on Christmas morning, Simone hoped to open some gifts that included a hoodie, some lotions, a journal and pen.\nThat’s all that Kathy Nolen knew about the young girl she bought gifts for when she bought her most of the items on her list, along with sweaters, shirts, sweat pants, legging, nail polish, adult coloring books and more.\nNolen knew what Simone wanted because she was among 5,733 Michigan foster children who made a wish list that was passed onto donors through a program known as Operation Good Cheer .\nOn Saturday, dozens of volunteer pilots loaded planes with wrapped gifts, bicycles, electronics and more at the Oakland International Airport. They were then flown to 25 regional airports across Michigan, where they were distributed to representatives from social service agencies, the foster children and their families. In all, 270 individuals, families and companies donated 17,200 gifts to children across the state.\n“It just breaks my heart when I read about why children are in foster care,” said Nolen, who’s been participating in the program since she was a child. “Children shouldn’t have to go through that. I just want (Simone) to know that we care about her, and we hope she has a bright future.”\nNow in its 45th year, the program is aimed partly to support families that take in foster children because often they have their own children and sometimes there aren’t enough resources to give the same amount of gifts to everyone, said Sherry Brackenwagen, administrative director of Children and Family Services of Michigan , which oversees Operation Good Cheer.\n“It makes the children just like other children,” Brackenwagen said. “It makes them feel like they belong. We get thank you notes from the children, who can’t believe people cared enough to give them gifts. Some of them have really gone through some bad things and they can’t believe people would give them something, even though they don’t know them.”\nAmong the pilots who volunteered was Stan Politowicz, and his co-pilot, Bill Patrick. The friends, from Commerce Township, provided gifts for 12children with their local chapter of the Knights of Columbus. But they also flew gifts for dozens of other children to an airport near Big Rapids.\n“These kids are in foster care because of abuse, neglect, drugs, violence,” said Politowicz, who’s volunteered for the program for six years. “If it wasn’t for this program, these kids may not get Christmas presents at all. If we can improve the life of one kid, we’ve done good.”\nWhat’s more, Politowicz said it’s a heartwarming way to start the holiday season.\n“One year, a child said to me,’Mr. Pilot, are you Santa Claus?’”\nKKozlowski@detroitnews.com",

      "text": "A Saskatchewan nurse who used Twitter and Facebook to express concern about the quality of care given to a family member in a nursing home has been found guilty of professional misconduct, according to a recent decision by the body that oversees nursing in the province. The case concerns posts by Carolyn Strom, a registered nurse who commented on Facebook in February of 2015. Her post both criticized and praised staff at St. Joseph's Health Facility in Macklin, Sask., about 250 kilometres west of Saskatoon.\n\"My grandfather spent a week in palliative care before he died and after hearing about his and my family's experience there, it is evident that not everyone is 'up to speed' on how to approach end of life care or how to help maintain an ageing senior's dignity,\" Strom said online.\n\"I challenge the people involved in decision making with that facility to please get all your staff a refresher on this topic and more. Don't get me wrong, 'some' people have provided excellent care so I thank you so very much for your efforts, but to those who made Grandpa's last years less than desirable, please do better next time,\" she said.\nHer posting was also shared on Twitter.\nWhile Strom was not a nurse at the facility, staff saw her postings and — according to testimony heard by a discipline committee — felt it was \"humiliating\" and \"embarrassing\".\nA formal complaint was made, alleging that Strom failed to meet her professional obligations.\nA committee of the Saskatchewan Registered Nurses Association considered the issue and found that Strom had gone too far.\n\"Ms. Strom engaged in a generalized public venting about the facility and its staff and went straight to social media to do that,\" the decision noted.\nThe discipline committee also considered if Strom's comments were permissible as free speech, but noted that people  who include their credentials as part of their commentary must follow the codes of their profession. Strom had identified herself as an RN and, even though her motivation was understandable, the SRNA said she should have acted differently. She had not, it was noted, taken any of her concerns to officials or staff at the facility.\nNo malice found\n\"The Discipline Committee accepts that Ms. Strom's Facebook post and the subsequent online communication she engaged in was motivated by perhaps grief and anger,\" the decision added. \"It is accepted that Ms. Strom was not driven by malice. Carolyn Strom is a professional bound to act with integrity and in accordance with the Code of Ethics. The Discipline Committee does not seek to 'muzzle' registered nurses from using social media. However, registered nurses must conduct themselves professionally and with care when communicating on social media.\"\nThe committee said it would reconvene to consider an appropriate penalty. No date was provided for when that would happen.\nA redacted version of the decision was recently published online:\n- EXTERNAL LINK: SRNA Discipline Decision (redacted)",

      "text": "Is KD your \"go to\" guy? By Parvenu on Dec 3, 2016, 1:09pm PST +  Share Share on Facebook + Comments We’ve discussed this topic previously, but perhaps it’s worth another look, especially since we now have more data to consider. The question is: Are you okay with KD being the \"go to\" guy when it’s crunch time – when the game is on the line? Over the last few years, we’ve become accustomed to seeing Steph Curry as the \"go to\" guy – after all, he’s been our best shooter and is the two-time raining MVP. We’ve also seen Klay Thompson be the \"go to\" guy in certain situations, and certainly as the second option when Curry is double-teamed. But we now have a new reality, and that new reality is KD. No pressure I raise this question because of the devastating double overtime loss to the Houston Rockets. I was intrigued, but somewhat annoyed, when the announcers kept saying, \"There is only one \"go to\" guy for GSW, and that’s Kevin Durant.\" While I agree with this, I still have some lingering doubts, albeit very tiny doubts about that strategy. And I want to know what you think. At 65, my memory is certainly not what it used to be, but I seem to recall that Kevin Durant went 0-5 during the overtime. And I can’t remember whether it was the first overtime or the second. But whichever it was, I was somewhat dismayed that our \"go to\" guy would go 0-5. But stuff happens….bad officiating happens, which is an entirely different discussion. I think that the referees caused this loss, but I will never say that publicly since I cannot afford the $25,000 fine. Fine, Parv, just keep ranting…… Kevin Durant as the \"go to\" guy is probably the best strategy. His eFG% is second to none. And he’s quite good with the triple threat – he can shoot, drive to the basket, or pass the basketball to an open shooter. His great free throw shooting augers well for him to drive to the basket and get a shooting foul. But is he ready to shoulder the responsibility of being our new \"go to\" guy? Is he truly comfortable in playing that role? Could he be concerned about stepping on anyone's toes -- concerned about hurting Curry's feelings? I’m not a psychologist, but I did stay at a Holiday Inn express last month. Psychologically, perhaps he is not ready to assume this awesome responsibility. With OKC, he was a big fish in a very small pond, but with GSW, he is surrounded by overwhelming Splash in Curry and Thompson. In essence, it is a wholly different environment which may cause psychological insecurities. Maybe he is not yet comfortable in being the \"go to\" guy. And for the record, I’m not a huge fan of Sigmund Freud. His main thesis was that every young man wants to sleep with his mother. I have never even met his mother! Is KD your \"go to\" guy? Poll Is KD your \"go to\" guy? Yes! It depends! Hint: This is usually the best answer. :) vote view results This FanPost is a submission from a member of the mighty Golden State of Mind community.

      "text": "Nation & World MEMPHIS \nIt took 46 years to get to this point. Live on Facebook, passed out from a drug overdose. \nRonald Hiers was trying to kill himself. \nHe has been battling addiction for almost 50 years. His poison of choice has evolved throughout the years. \nIt was alcohol in high school, cocaine in his 20s and 30s, and ended with heroin. \n>> Read more trending stories \nOne of his wake up calls came when a disturbing video showing Hiers and his wife passed out on the sidewalk was posted online. \nPeople walked by him as if he weren't a human being. They poked at him, laughed and didn't call 911. \n“That video was the best thing that happened to me. It got me here, and here is where I’ve been trying to get to 46 years,” Hiers said. \nAfter he watched the video again, he said it doesn't get any less painful. But, he has no resentment for the man who posted it. \n“He didn't owe me a phone call. He didn't owe me anything. He didn't get me there. He didn't get my wife there. She and I got ourselves there,” Hiers said. \nNow, the Frayser High School graduate faces his demons at Turning Point , an addiction-recovery center in Southaven, Miss. \nIt’s a battle he is doing alone, not with his wife.. \nTurning Point said that if a family or couple has a history of using together, it is best they are treated separately. \nWhen couples go through intentional separation in treatment, a critical turning point has to happen. It is an internal change that grounds them to further the work needed to maintain long-term sustainable recovery. \nThe road has not been easy, but Hiers has not lost his faith. \n“That's what God does. He puts you in the path of things he wants you to see and guess he got tired of me not calling him, he had to call me,” Hiers said. \nGod wasn’t the only one he said called. On the top of his list to thank is his daughter. \n“She made it possible. She bothered me on my telephone for hours that day,” Hiers said. “I didn't want to talk to her. I'm busy trying to kill myself, but she kept calling.” \nIf he meets the man who posted the video, he wants to ask one question: \"Would you have called 911 if it had been one of (your) loved ones?” View Comments 0 ",

      "text": "It’s funny, just a decade or two, and how quickly we have moved backwards (Photo: Facebook) The changing climate in Indian society has been a matter of concern for quite sometime with any disagreement on social media over political beliefs being met by aggressive trolls and people being labelled anti-national for voicing their dissent openly.\nThere have also been several incidents of people being heckled for not standing up for the National Anthem before movies, and any question on the cricket team being responded to questions on patriotism. Recently a directive by the Supreme Court asking people to stand up for the National Anthem before a movie was the subject of a debate, as people expressed outrage at such gestures being made into decisive factors for one’s patriotism.\nAmong several posts on social media, Congress MP Shashi Tharoor shared one from a user called Deepak Rana, which mentioned how he grew up in an India where political differences were tolerated, people could support any team they wanted and stood up for the National Anthem because they felt like, instead of being compelled to.\nThe post highlights the changes in Indian society over the years and how the attitude should be a matter for concern, as it shows society as going backwards when it comes to free thinking, freedom of expression and the right to have a difference of opinion.",

      "text": "Follow CBSMIAMI.COM: Facebook | Twitter \nSANTIAGO DE CUBA (CBSMiami) – The Plaza of the Revolution in Santiago de Cuba was packed with tens of thousands of people on Saturday night who gathered to say a final goodbye to Fidel Castro.\nThis was the time for them to bid farewell to the revolutionary leader they had supported for many years.\nThe so-called Caravan of Liberty, which carried the ashes of Fidel Castro across the island of Cuba, left Havana on Wednesday and arrived in Santiago de Cuba on Saturday.\nSantiago de Cuba is the birthplace of Castro’s revolution, starting in 1953 with an attack on a local army barrack.\nCastro took power in 1959 and held on to it before turning it over to his brother Raul in 2006.\nRaul Castro has said he will serve as president until 2018.\nWhile he has allowed limited economic reform, there is no sign that the government will allow political changes.\nGovernment sympathizers brought Cuban flags, held signs showing their support for Fidel Castro and chanted ‘I am Fidel’ throughout the night.\n",

      "text": "\nFollow the Buckeyes on Facebook , Twitter and Instagram \nMANHATTAN, Kan. – Thirty-two points in the fifth set were needed to separate the Buckeyes as victors in an instant classic on the road at No. 14 Kansas State (21-10). The Scarlet & Gray gutted out a 17-15 triumph to cap off the win inside enemy lines (25-20, 25-22, 22-25, 23-25, 17-15). Only sixteen teams remain with a shot at the 2016 national championship to be contested in Columbus, Ohio. \nNCAA Bracket/Results \nOhio State (22-12) is one of just 11 schools nationally to reach the NCAA Regional round at least five times since 2010 (‘10-11, ‘14-16). A familiar foe in Big Ten sistren, Wisconsin, awaits the Buckeyes next weekend in Madison (Dec. 9-10). \nTaylor Hughes registered her second triple-double of the season, compiling 41 assists, 15 digs and 14 kills. She is now one of 18 players in the country to post multiple triple-doubles in 2016 with only 34 individuals able to muster at least one. \nHughes was joined in the Double-Digit Kills Club by Luisa Schirmer (21), Taylor Sandbothe (12) and Audra Appold ; and the Double-Digit Digs Club by Valeria León (24), Appold (17) and Schirmer (10). In addition, Abby Fesl dished out 23 assists. \nSandbothe paced the squad in both hitting percentage (.276) and blocks (1s, 7a). Schirmer and Hughes were also strong up front defensively, recording five and four blocks, respectively. \nSET 1: Kansas State exhausted its timeout limit 11 points into the first set, falling victim to a quick 9-2 deficit. The Buckeye cushion peaked at 23-13 before a six-point KSU run threatened Ohio State’s stranglehold, pulling within in four tallies (23-19). Hughes terminated a pair of Fesl sets down the stretch though, securing a 25-20 triumph. \nSET 2: Ohio State found success early and often in the second stanza as well, forcing the first Wildcat timeout following an Ashley Wenz kill for an 8-4 edge. The Buckeyes distanced themselves by swinging .357 and nearly doubling up Kansas State with an 11-6 digs advantage, combining with three stuffs to smolder the Wildcat offense with a .133 efficiency. Ohio State erected a six-point lead, 24-18, and again had to hold off a late KSU surge. Kansas State closed the gap as narrow as 24-22 when Appold spoiled the comeback effort, terminating a set from León for point number 25. \nSET 3: Kansas State processed an admirable reboot after intermission, grabbing 10 of the first 15 points in the third. Ohio State responded immediately by accomplishing the same feat to re-even the ledger at 15-all. Stalemate would reemerge at 20-20 and 22-22. Three consecutive Wildcat blocks came next, keeping Kansas State alive as 25-22 winners. \nSET 4: A whopping nine lead changes occurred in the fourth, complimenting 13 tied scores in a tightly-contested period. Getting past the Wildcat block proved troublesome again for Ohio State late in the set. Rejections by Katie Reininger and Bryna Vogel broke up a 22-all tie, accounting for Kansas State’s 23rd and 24th points. Vogel then closed the door at 25-23, bouncing a kill and extending the bout into a decisive fifth round. \nSET 5: The fifth was a W-I-L-D one to say the least. Despite the truncated framework of a fifth set, the large crowd in attendance and those watching around the country on ESPN3 witnessed 11 tied scores and four lead changes. Ohio State served as the set’s aggressor, blasting 13 kills on 31 attempts with seven errors. Schirmer bounced a half dozen kills individually, nearly matching the Wildcats 7-kill team total. As the teams swapped ends of the court, Kansas State possessed an 8-6 edge. León righted the ship with consecutive out-of-system assists, finding Appold and Schirmer at the pins for kills. The score remained all-square at 9-9, 10-10, 13-13, 14-14 and 15-15. Wenz set up Ohio State’s third match point opportunity, allowing Schirmer to capitalize on a Sweet-16-bound put away at 17-15. \nNCAA TOURNAMENT MARKS • Ohio State all-time | 35-21 (.625) in 22 appearances• Geoff Carlston all-time | 15-11 (.577), including 12-6 (.667) at Ohio State• Ohio State has advanced to the NCAA Regionals 16 times• 37.5% of the team left in contention are from the Big Ten Conference (six of 16)• The Big Ten is 14-2 (.875) thus far in the 2016 NCAA Tournament ",

      "title": "Business Writing Tips That Add Impact",
      "text": "Writing is a fact of business and life. From the “LOL” Tweet or Facebook post to the 52-page business report, we all seek to create writing that is effective and impactful. The problem is that most of us are still writing to impress our English teacher. As a result, we carry over assumptions and behaviors about the writing process into our writing as grownups.\nIf writing was difficult for you as a student and still remains difficult Business Writing Tips For Easy and Effective Results is a book that promises to ease the transition to a better way of writing.\nWhat is Business Writing Tips About? Business Writing Tips starts off where all of our writing begins, in the mind. When most of us went to school, we were taught the “game” of writing. In that game, higher points went to the paper that featured the longest content and the most difficult words while making as few grammar mistakes as possible.With that kind of goal, the emphasis is more on the “rules” than writing style.\nFast forward a couple of years. Many of us haven’t graduated from this level of writing.\nBecause of this focus on “avoiding the penalty,” Business Writing Tips argues that we don’t use our personal style when writing. This emotional and mental “baggage” is what keeps us from writing in a more natural and easier way.\nGetting back to a more natural (and easier) writing style is the intended focus of the book. Writing teacher and author Robert Bullard doesn’t want readers to discard all grammar rules, but he asks them to consider their purpose when writing. He invites readers to dissect and analyze their own writing style (and that of others) to create what works for them.\nBalancing style, purpose and grammar is the key to good writing. Good writing should not only look good (grammar) but it should also feel comfortable for the writer (style) and serve its intended purpose.\nBullard is a former features writer for newspapers who now works as a copy editor, proofreader and book coach.\nWhat Was Best About Business Writing Tips? The best part of Business Writing Tips is the focus. The book balances a focus on grammar with a focus on style and intent. In other words, the book doesn’t simply tell readers how they should write. It gives suggestions on the process and style of good writing. This emphasis is shared in the various exercises of the book, aimed at making each individuals writing more effective.\nWhat Could Have Been Done Differently? Business Writing Tips is a great introduction to the writing process without all of the “baggage”, a message that will most resonate with beginning writers. Writers with more experience may find that some sections of the book may cover material with which they are already familiar. That being said, the book’s approach of helping to relieve a writer’s baggage may prove helpful even for those writers who know the grammar rules but still have trouble writing.\nWhy Read Business Writing Tips? If you are a person who has always struggled with the writing process, Business Writing Tips might be able to help. While grammar rules can easily be searched on Google, the process and style of using those rules can’t. That’s where the book shines. Bullard has years of experience in writing (as a journalist, proofreader and coach) and uses that experience to target the mental roadblocks that get in a writer’s way. His book is designed to help readers appreciate and draw out their unique writing styles so that they can create impactful and effective writing .\nThis article, \" Business Writing Tips That Add Impact \" was first published on Small Business Trends \n",

Photo: Facebook.\nJNS.org – United Kingdom Home Secretary Amber Rudd has promised to spend millions to provide all Jewish schools and synagogues in the country with security guards.\nSpeaking at a UK-Israel conference in the British Parliament, Rudd cited the research of the Community Security Trust, a British organization that monitors and records antisemitic incidents.\n“Last year, the Community Security Trust received 924 reports of antisemitic incidents, including 86 violent assaults. Let me be clear, any attack of that kind is one attack too many,” Rudd said.\n 11:53 am 0 Rouhani: Iran Will ‘Firmly Respond’ If Obama Doesn’t Block Congress Sanctions Extension Iranian President Hassan Rouhani demanded on Sunday that Barack Obama block an extension of sanctions passed by the US Congress,...\n“We are providing £13.4 million (about $17 million) for guarding at all Jewish state, free and independent schools, colleges and nurseries and at synagogues, and to support the continuing efforts of the police to provide security and reassurance to the Jewish community,” she added.\nRudd said far-right extremists have become “increasingly sophisticated” in their tactics to use social media to promote their cause and to gain new followers.\n“I am absolutely determined that we challenge extremism in all its forms and the terrible damage it can cause to individuals, families and communities,” she said.",

      "text": "The logo of The Jewish Voice newspaper. Photo: Facebook.\nJNS.org – The New York-based newspaper The Jewish Voice is calling on the pro-Israel community to boycott French-made products in response to France’s recent decision to issue labels distinguishing between Israeli products from within and beyond the 1967 lines.\n“We are calling on all supporters of Israel, be they Jewish or not, to immediately cease and desist in the purchase of any and all products made in France,” the newspaper wrote in an editorial published Dec. 2. “And that means cheese, wines, perfume or any other staple items that we naturally associate with France. Let the French learn that Israel supporters will not be economically pinched without pushing back.”\nThe Jewish Voice ’s editorial comes in the aftermath of Israeli Deputy Minister for Diplomacy Michael Oren’s Nov. 27 tweet that Israelis should “think twice” about purchasing French products. France’s government directed businesses to not use “Made in Israel” labels for products from Israeli companies in Judea, Samaria and the Golan Heights.\n“The truth is, the antisemitism emanating from France is essentially endemic to the culture and society and has been for centuries. It is also the European hub of vitriol directed at the Jewish state,” The Jewish Voice wrote.\nJewish Voice Publisher David Ben-Hooren told JNS.org that he is encouraging other media outlets to mirror his newspaper’s call to boycott French products.\n“I’m calling on other media companies to follow suit and create this awareness that we are not going to take this. We are not going take this from France,” Ben-Hooren said. “Let’s not forget that America is a major market for French products, and I hope the mainstream media will take notice of it and join us.”",

      "text": "EMAIL (Photo: Jewel Samad, AFP/Getty Images) \nHi, it’s me. That girl on Facebook who has been posting Hillary Clinton videos for six months . Do you recognize me? You might know me from my other work, which is to like every article I read on Facebook and clog your Timeline. \nNow that the election is over, I have something that I want to say: I am sorry. \nI am sorry that the media and popular culture does not reflect you, your values or your struggles. \nI am sorry that liberals like myself have lashed out at you and stereotyped you rather than listening to your perspective. \nI am sorry that the recession has not reached you and that you and your family have suffered. \nMost of all, I am sorry that you felt forgotten, infringed upon and trampled. \nI see you, I hear you and I will work my hardest to keep this in mind moving forward. \nI have spent these days after the election trying to listen more because I believe this has contributed to much of the division between you and I. \nI have read articles, skimmed comment sections and reached out to friends and strangers alike who hold different beliefs than myself. It has not been easy, and I am still not great at it. \nThis pursuit of understanding is genuine. I want you to know that I still have a lot of work to do. I want you to know that I am trying. \nHowever, I cannot do this alone. I beseech you to do the same because bridging this gap of anger and hatred will take all of us. \nI hope you understand that I respect the results of the election, but I do not respect Donald Trump. \nI want him to succeed because his success benefits us all. But, though he says he wants to serve all Americans, Trump has yet to prove this. \nInstead, what I know from Trump is his hateful, divisive and cruel rhetoric that targets people who are different than him. My respect, our respect, has to be earned. \nI hope that you condemn the violence that has been perpetrated against marginalized groups since Donald Trump was elected president. Please do not chalk it up to a few isolated incidents and move past it. \nPeople are afraid that this election means they are not welcome in our country. Let’s not equate that feeling to being a sore-loser because this fear is real and valid. \nWe must especially denounce acts of hatred committed on our campus. They do exist with increasing regularity. \nIntimidating other students is not acceptable under any circumstances. It is not acceptable as a joke, and it is not acceptable because Donald Trump often acts in a discriminatory fashion. \nWe must come together to make this a place where all students feel safe and can pursue higher education. \nI hope we can recognize that we often stereotype people of color, the same way that we have stereotyped Republicans as being racists and bigots. \nBoth groups do not necessarily fulfill the stereotypes that we hold them to. However, the feelings of frustration, misunderstanding and fear do not go away or cannot be hidden from because their skin cannot be concealed. They walk through life as people of color, and are subjected to stereotypes every day as a result. \nThis is true even if you do not believe you personally are racist. Sometimes, you may be acting discriminatory and might not realize it. I know I have been many times in my life. \nI hope you can understand that I am extremely upset by this election. For me, my focus was on the social issues associated with the election. This loss has left me feeling that many Americans believe that non-white and non-Christian Americans are inferior. Please be patient with my sadness. Please do not expect me to simply move on, because I refuse to. \nThis is all is coming from my perspective, and just a portion of what I think. I know that I do not know everything. I would love to hear how you feel. \nIf you are willing, let’s meet for lunch or dinner, because obviously there is nothing so unproductive as fighting in a comment section. Let’s promise not to interrupt one another, and to listen to understand rather than to craft a perfect response. \nMost importantly, let’s end with a hug, and promise to keep listening to one another. \nThis story written by Sally Martinelli , originally appeared in The Villanovan , the student newspaper of Villanova University.

      "text": "Follow CBSMIAMI.COM: Facebook | Twitter \nOAKLAND, Calif. (CBSMiami/AP) — The death toll from a blaze that tore through a warehouse hosting a late-night dance party jumped to 30 on Sunday as firefighters painstakingly combed through rubble for others believed to still be missing.\nOnly a fraction of the charred remains of the partly collapsed structure had been searched, and crews clearing debris were expected to find more bodies as they advanced, Alameda County Sheriff’s Sgt. Ray Kelly said.\nAnxious family members who feared the worst gathered at the sheriff’s office to await word on their loved ones. They were told they may have to provide DNA samples to help identify remains.\nThe building known as the “Ghost Ship” had been carved into artist studios and was an illegal home for a rotating cast of a dozen or more people, according to former denizens who said it was a cluttered death trap with few exits, piles of wood and a mess of snaking electric cords.\n“If you were going there for a party, you wouldn’t be aware of the maze that you have to go through to get out,” said Danielle Boudreaux, a former friend of the couple who ran the warehouse.\nAs many as 100 people were there for a party Friday night when the fire broke out just before midnight. Fire officials were still investigating the cause of the blaze, but they said clutter fueled the flames, there were no sprinklers inside and few exits to escape.\nBoudreaux identified the operators of the Satya Yuga collective as Derick Ion Almena and Micah Allison. She had a falling out with Almena when she convinced Allison’s parents and sister about a year ago that the warehouse was a dangerous place for the couple’s three children to live.\nThe couple rented out five recreational vehicles and other nooks on the ground floor as living spaces. A rickety makeshift staircase led to a second floor where concerts were held. Former residents said there frequently was no electricity or running water.\nOakland planning officials opened an investigation last month after repeated complaints from neighbors who said trash was piling up and people were illegally living in the building zoned as a warehouse. An inspector who went to the premises couldn’t get inside, said Darin Ranelletti, of the Oakland Planning Department.\nThe city had not confirmed people lived there, but a former resident said she had been lured in part by reasonable rents in a region beset with a housing shortage and exorbitant leases driven by the tech boom.\nShelley Mack said she wasn’t told the residence was illegal until after she moved in a couple years ago and stayed for four to five months, paying about $700 a month. She said she was instructed to tell visitors it was a 24-hour workspace for artists and when outsiders or inspectors planned to visit, residents would scurry to hide clothes and bedding.\n“It’s like a horror house. Just horrors in there,” she said.\nTo a first-time visitor, though, the labyrinth of uniquely designed spaces was “stunning,” said Alastair Boone, a University of California, Berkeley student who arrived at the party with five friends around 11 p.m.\nPhotographs from before the fire showed that the Bohemian community of musicians, painters, woodworkers, dancers and other artists had decorated the scene with Tibetan prayer flags, Christmas lights and scores of wooden statues of Buddha, the virgin Mary, Jesus Christ, elephants and dragons that sat atop pianos and turntables. Tapestries hung from the walls, mannequin legs and arms stuck out from the ceiling and a small wooden spot of floor was used for art performances.\n“It was obvious to me everyone who lives there cared about each other and were invested in a space they made a home,” Boone said.\nAlmena did not immediately respond to emails or phone numbers associated with him. Authorities declined to talk about the manager, saying they were focused on recovering the bodies and consoling families.\nA man identified as Derick Ion posted a Facebook message early Saturday, saying, “Everything I worked so hard for is gone. Blessed that my children and Micah were at a hotel safe and sound.” He drew rebukes online from others who said he was warned the building was unsafe.\nAlmena, 46, has lived in California since at least 1990, mostly in Los Angeles, where public records show he was evicted from a North Hollywood apartment in Los Angeles in 1993.\nAllison, 40, spent much of her life residing in Northern California, although she had also lived in Southern California, where she filed for a fictitious business name, Sacred Image, at a Los Angeles address.\nOnline records listed the building’s owner as Nar Siu Chor. The Associated Press could not locate a telephone number for her Saturday. Efforts to reach her at other Oakland addresses associated with her were not successful.\nBoone said she had just received a tour of the property and stepped outside when someone yelled, “Fire!”\n“In a couple of minutes there were flames coming out of the windows and black smoke was just billowing out of the house,” she said.\nSome of the people who got out were crying and others stood silently in shock as firefighters arrived to put the flames out.\n“The people who lived there were clustered together, and they were just so sad,” Boone said. “They were losing their loved ones, and there was nothing they could do.”\nMonica Kat was outside the warehouse Saturday and said she feared four of her friends were dead. “They’re still not accounted for, and I can only think the worst at this point,” she said.\n(TM and © Copyright 2016 CBS Radio Inc. and its relevant subsidiaries.

      "title": "UPDATE: Have a question about the fiduciary rule? Ask it now",
      "text": "By Alessandra Malito, MarketWatch\nMarketWatch will interview two experts live on Facebook at 2 p.m. on Thurs. Dec. 8\nThe fiduciary rule is set to greatly affect the way retirement accounts are managed, and in turn, perhaps how much investors see in returns.\nPlayers throughout the financial services industry have been busy preparing themselves for the April deadline of the Department of Labor's rule, which came out earlier this year and requires that advisers act in their clients' best interests when overseeing retirement accounts (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/new-rule-retirement-account-advisers-must-be-fiduciaries-act-in-clients-best-interest-2016-04-08). In the eyes of proponents, it's a victory for retirement savers (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-fiduciary-rule-is-a-great-victory-for-retirement-savers-2016-04-20) as its goal is to banish unnecessarily high fees and commissions, and provide more quality advice for those investing for their futures.\nCritics, on the other hand, argue it will orphan small accounts too costly to manage and shut out a variety of investment options, instead focusing on passive choices like exchange-traded funds (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/will-the-fiduciary-rule-mean-that-active-and-smart-beta-etfs-get-left-behind-2016-10-14), which come at a much lower price point.\nAs part of the rule, clients might need to sign a best interests contract, which states they understand their broker-dealers (http://blogs.wsj.com/totalreturn/2015/02/25/fiduciary-or-broker-many-financial-advisers-wear-both-hats/), who are advisers that sell securities, might receive commissions on the products they recommend. It will also impact (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/what-retirement-savers-need-to-know-about-the-fiduciary-rule-2015-05-09) individual retirement account rollovers as accounts with too few assets might arguably pay more for less advice. Though there were concerns the rule would not go through under President-elect Donald Trump, it's unlikely the future president will repeal it (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-fiduciary-rule-wont-change-under-a-president-trump-2016-11-09), experts said.\nCompanies such as Merrill Lynch Wealth Management and J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. (JPM) have already announced (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/dear-president-elect-trump-please-do-right-by-investors-2016-11-15) they will stop charging commissions on retirement accounts. The former also said clients will only have the option of opening fee-based individual retirement accounts, as opposed to a percentage-based fee on total assets of a client's account.\nMarketWatch is going to interview Department of Labor assistant secretary Timothy Hauser and Marcia Wagner, an attorney and expert in labor law and fiduciary issues live on Facebook at 2 p.m. Eastern time on Thursday, Dec. 8. Certified Financial Planner professionals will earn a one-hour credit of continuing education after watching the session.\nHave a question you'd like to ask them? Let us know your questions in the comments or email them to Alessandra Malito (mailto:amalito@marketwatch.com), and we'll ask them during the live broadcast.\n-Alessandra Malito;\nRELATED: The fiduciary standard isn't going away, no matter what Trump decides (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/no-matter-what-trump-decides-on-the-fiduciary-rule-the-standard-will-only-gain-strength-2016-11-22)\nRELATED: 7 dirty words I can't say because I'm a fiduciary (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/7-dirty-words-i-cant-say-because-im-a-fiduciary-2016-06-13)\nRELATED: A repeal of the fiduciary rule may slow -- but not halt -- the trend towards ETFs (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/a-repeal-of-the-fiduciary-rule-may-slow-but-not-halt-the-trend-towards-etfs-2016-11-10)\n 0844ET\n ",

      "text": "PROVIDENCE, Rhode Island — A man who live-streamed himself on Facebook going more than 100 miles-per-hour through traffic was in critical condition in the hospital after crashing his car. Rhode Island police say the 20-year-old driver’s car flew into the center median and slammed into a garbage truck. \n \nRhode Island State Police say the video is a perfect example of what NOT to do while driving.\nIt shows Onasi Olio-Rojas on a high-speed joy ride on Route 10 and Route 6 in Providence, Rhode Island.\n \n“He’s well over 100 miles-per-hour in a congested area. Several lane changes, in and out of traffic. In the break-down lane. Back to lanes of travel,” Captain John Allen with Rhode Island State Police said.\nStreaming live on Facebook, Olio-Rojas filmed the speedometer on his dashboard — showing he was traveling at 109 miles-per-hour.\n \n“It’s a grand slam of things not to do. Phone in your hand. No seat belt. Traveling at a high rate of speed. In and out of traffic,” Allen said.\nState police verified the video’s authenticity by comparing it to RI-DOT traffic cameras. They said they’re positive Olio-Rojas was the driver — videotaping his reckless driving moments before he crashed.\nThe video cut out just before Olio-Rojas hit a garbage truck and lost control.\nAn accident reconstruction team said his Honda was traveling at about 90 miles-per-hour when it hit the truck, which was barely damaged.\nOlio-Rojas’ car was destroyed, and it took firefighters awhile to get him out.\n \n“I’ve never seen anything like that — and for other people to watch it, I would hope it’s eye-opening for anyone else,” Allen said.\nState police say Olio-Rojas has a lengthy traffic record. Police reached out to Facebook — putting in a legal request for the social media network to save that live stream.\nThe video will be used as evidence against Olio-Rojas in court.\n \n“How do you beat the video? I don’t think you can. I think it pretty much puts the nail on the coffin for Mr. Olio-Rojas,” Allen said.\nTraffic was backed up for more than two hours after the crash.\nOlio-Rojas now faces a number of charges.",

But they're super sweet guys,” Sydney Carty said. \nCarty is a local musician putting on a fundraiser for the Summers brothers recovering in the hospital. \nFamily members said Brandon, Jared, and Wesley Summers walked through fire to survive the wildfires. In the smoke, they got separated from their parents, who died in the fire. \n“It's going to pay for their medical bills and help them get back on their feet,” Carty said. \nThe event will take place at South Main Sounds on Saturday, December 10. Carty hopes there will be enough money to contribute to the fund started by the boy’s uncles. \nJared Summers has been released from Vanderbilt Hospital, but his brothers remain there. \n“They have to communicate with a white board, which is just heartbreaking,” Carty said. “They have some burns on their face but they are going to recover soon, which is really nice.\" \n ",

      "text": "Facebook \n“Founded in November 2011 by Korea Government, the Institute for Basic Science ( IBS ) supports basic research within the entire range of natural sciences including physics, biology, chemistry, mathematics, earth science, and astronomy by providing highly advanced, supportive, self-direct research environments” \nIBS invites applicants for the position of Associate Director who are senior-level researchers with high research potentials, and are able to run his or her own research group in collaboration with the directors within their Research Centers. \n1. Introduction of the research center The Center for Catalytic Hydrocarbon Functionalizations( CCHF ) was established in December, 2012 under the program of the Institute for Basic Science. CCHF is located inside Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology ( KAIST ), Daejeon, Korea. The main research focus of the Center for Catalytic Hydrocarbon Functionalizations is the development of new catalytic reactions and identification of mechanisms. In addition to research on the applications of reactions that integrate various functional groups into hydrocarbons using catalytic methods, the Center is also aiming for the mechanistic investigations behind such processes. By first identifying basic principles concerning the carbon-hydrogen bond activation process in low-reactivity organic molecules, the Center aims to develop a system that enables mediation via metal catalysts for practical application to organic chemistry reactions. Its ultimate goal is to make innovative S&T progress beyond the boundaries of the existing chemical materials industry by applying the catalytic system to the integration of useful functional groups in methane-based hydrocarbons. The Center plans to undertake research in the development of a selective, defunctionalized catalyst system of bio-compounds to obtain glucose in massive amounts. for more information – http://sbchang.kaist.ac.kr/ \n2.

Post to Facebook What They Don’t Tell You About Your Website Re-Design A few months ago, I received a letter from a store saying they no longer carry a type of chips. Check out this story on DemocratandChronicle.com: http://on.rocne.ws/2h3uG04 Cancel Send A link has been sent to your friend's email address. Posted! A link has been posted to your Facebook feed. Join the Conversation RocNext Siwei Dodge, Rochester 7:06 p.m. EST December 4, 2016 A few months ago, I received a letter from a store saying they no longer carry a type of chips. According to their records, I bought two bags of chips in the last two years. So they thought they should let me know and suggested I try a few other chips instead. About month ago, I visited an industrial services' website by accident. Since then, I get their online ad wherever I go. Not in a million years would I have the need to buy anything remotely like that. Regardless, I’m under their radar now. Despite what people say, we don’t have much privacy anymore. Visiting a store, you leave behind lots of data about yourself when you check out: where you live, what you buy frequently, how much you spend, even your credit score. (Membership card, anyone?) When you visit a website, you leave even more data behind, it doesn’t matter if you buy something or not. The website knows which pages you’ve been to, everything you clicked, everything you put in your cart and then discarded. If you do buy something, the website knows where you live, where you came from to the website, which ad you are responding to, if you’ve bought anything similar before, etc. But when you ask a business owner how many website visitors he gets on an average day, how many visitors he is “losing”, astonishingly, he has no record whatsoever. This is exactly the reason why most website re-design/re-branding fails. It’s rarely the result of a lack of creativity in the company logo or the catchy phrases in your tagline. It’s the lack of understanding of what you really want to get out of your website re-design and more importantly, what metrics should be set and tracked to determine its success or failure. The same applies to digital marketing campaigns. For a small to mid-sized business, the web might be the only space you can do something that was impossible to do in the past: Competing against businesses that are bigger than you, have more money than you and own more space than you. \nThink about it. You have the same amount of “real estate” space as the “big guys.” Your web page is the same size as theirs, you have the same amount of ad space on Google or Facebook. The web doesn't care if they’re 10 times bigger than you, you “own” the same amount of space as them. For those of you who have a website. Here’s what you can do NOW to make the most of it: Start tracking your web data if you haven’t already. Google Analytics is a good place to start. It might be the most sophisticated web analytics tool by far. (Did I mention it’s FREE?) Pro tip: Don’t let your ad/marketing agency or web developer do that for you. Here’s why: It’s tempting to delegate that to someone else. But judging from the projects I’ve worked on, tragedy happens when you “break up” with your agency or web developer. Nine times out of ten, when they offered to set up your Analytics account, it was set it up in a way that’s OWNED by them, not you. So when they leave, they can take all of your data with them, leaving you to start over. (Sorry, it is just how Web Analytics works. Once you lose that kind of data, it’s irreversible.) Can you really afford to start all over again? Let me know what you think. You can always share your thoughts with me at MORE FROM RocNext",

      "text": "Founder at Fessup.sg — Say what you really feel anonymously! 10 mins ago Re: https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/dec/04/google-democracy-truth-internet-search-facebook#_=_ I believe Technological Entrepreneurship is the best way to solve things, not engaging in more politics. Debates resolve nothing and solve no problems. It’s all talk, and no action. I would like to appeal to everyone to support a network where Truth and veracity are of prime importance and are the yardsticks upon which content is promoted. Why not support my anonymous app Fessup.sg , which I made specifically to address the problems of fake news and echo chambers? I mean no offence, but what is the point of complaining about Facebook and Google over and over again when you also realize the overwhelming power they have? A better strategy would be to counter their dominance through active support of an anonymous-by-default COMPETITOR network which prides itself on Truth as a determinator of how much reach content should have. Problems that arise on commercial products can be addressed through support of better solutions. Whistleblowing and revelations can also be performed covertly and anonymously too, as the app authenticates through the potential whistleblower’s institution email. This means hypothetical Edward Snowdens can make revelations while giving some level of credence and legitimacy without actually revealing their real identities. The potential for this particular use case is BIGLY HUGE. Truth is promoted, once again.",

      "text": "0 A picture of a White Walker from HBO TV series \"Game of Thrones.\" Facebook/ Game of Thrones \nA major action sequence for “Game of Thrones” Season 7 will soon be filmed near an ice lake at Wolf Hill Quarry in Northern Ireland. A picture of Kit Harington is said to have leaked online, confirming the involvement of Jon Snow in the big action sequence. \n[Spoiler alert] \nA blurry picture posted on Twitter is reported to be that of Harington (Jon Snow) preparing to film a scene at Wolf Hill. While the picture in itself doesn’t prove the actor’s involvement; a report by Watchers on the Wall is certain that it is him and that there will be a major action sequence being filmed here. \nThere aren’t any details about what this big action sequence will be about and which other major characters will be involved. The report reveals that the ice lake on the set will be the “focal point” of this scene. The snowy set and the presence of Jon Snow is a clear indication that the action will take place beyond the Wall in “Game of Thrones” Season 7. \nThe mention of Jon Snow fighting near an ice lake may remind some of the fans of a leak previously reported by International Business Times, Australia. An episode by episode plot reveal of the show talked about a major battle in episode 6. \nAccording to this leak, Jon Snow and the Brotherhood without Banners will travel beyond the Wall to capture a Wight to prove to the lords in Westeros that the White Walker threat is real. However, Harington’s character and his men will be attacked by the Night King and his forces, and the heroes get surrounded on a frozen lake. \nJon Snow is saved by Daenerys in this scene of “Game of Thrones” Season 7. Are the cast and crew members preparing to film this scene on the ice lake at Wolf Hill?",

The recount campaign cited financial difficulties as the reason for dropping the state case, and Jonathan Abady, lead counsel for the group called the state courts ill-equipped to handle the issue. The group will argue for the recount on constitutional grounds.

      "text": "Police send gas station robbery suspect Facebook message Published 5:20 am, Monday, December 5, 2016 BRIDGEVILLE, Pa. (AP) — Police in one southwestern Pennsylvania town have sent an armed robbery suspect a message on Facebook and it's not because they want to be friends. Bridgeville police say 32-year-old Robert Watkins III has been identified as the suspect in the Thanksgiving Day robbery of Gulf station. The police post, which includes the message, \"It's only a matter of time before we find you\" shows several pictures of Watkins and say he's been identified through surveillance video at the scene. The police believe Watkins may be headed back to his hometown of Meadville, which is about 100 miles north of Bridgeville and also along Interstate 79. Online court records show police were still looking for Watkins on Monday, on an arrest warrant for robbery and other charges.

We're looking into disrupting the economics with ads policies like the one we announced earlier this week , and better ad farm detection.\"\nZuckerberg also says he intends to employ third party verification and engage in better quality discussion with journalists and news media outlets.\nWith this announcement, Facebook is wading into a murky area. While any of the proposed solutions have the potential to be effective, they could also create problems of their own , as NPR reports. Breaking news stories would be difficult for algorithms and independent fact-checkers alike to verify. And features that allow users to flag content could end up being manipulated into a tool to push individual agendas.\nTo avoid these complications and many others, Facebook and other tech companies have long tried to stay out of content curation, verification, or censorship in the name of freedom of information. However, the volume of unreliable information in circulation online, particularly throughout the election cycle, is creating a push for higher standards.\nHowever, many observers feel that it ultimately is up to the news consumer, and not tech companies like Facebook and Google, to think critically about the accuracy of information, as The Christian Science Monitor’s Harry Bruinius reports :\nIt is particularly important to be discerning about one's news diet, say political analysts, when Facebook essentially creates a bubble of like-minded opinions – and, as this election showed, limited exposure to dissenting opinions makes it is easy to underestimate their power.\n told the Monitor via email . “What’s misguided, rather than those ",

(AP) \" Police in one Pennsylvania town have sent an armed robbery suspect a message on Facebook, and it's not because they want to be friends. \nBridgeville police say 32-year-old Robert Watkins III has been identified as the suspect in the Thanksgiving Day robbery of a Gulf station. \nThe police post, which includes the message, \"It's only a matter of time before we find you\" shows several pictures of Watkins, and says he's been identified through surveillance video at the scene. \nThe police believe Watkins may be headed to his hometown of Meadville, about 100 miles north of Bridgeville, in western Pennsylvania. \nOnline court records show police were still looking for Watkins on Monday on an arrest warrant for robbery and other charges.

(AP) — Police in one Pennsylvania town have sent an armed robbery suspect a message on Facebook, and it's not because they want to be friends. Bridgeville police say 32-year-old Robert Watkins III has been identified as the suspect in the Thanksgiving Day robbery of a Gulf station. The police post, which includes the message, \"It's only a matter of time before we find you\" shows several pictures of Watkins, and says he's been identified through surveillance video at the scene. The police believe Watkins may be headed to his hometown of Meadville, about 100 miles north of Bridgeville, in western Pennsylvania. Online court records show police were still looking for Watkins on Monday on an arrest warrant for robbery and other charges. Today's Deals",

      "text": "by Kevin Bruce Francisco · December 5, 2016 \nFake news or articles spreading false information have seamlessly blended into our news feed and a lot of users online are sadly being persuaded by some of this misinformation. \nHowever, for those who can discern the differences between real news and the ones meant to misinform, you can help filter out these posts so that fake ones no longer spread. \nBelow is a simple guide on how to report those fake news that you might encounter while browsing your Facebook feed. \nStep 1: Click the Option button on the post itself (drop down arrow on top right corner). This will show the available options for the entry. \nStep 2: Choose to ‘Report post’. It will then ask you to give a reason why you want to report it. \nStep 3: Click on ‘I think it shouldn’t be on Facebook’. \nStep 4: You will see an option saying ‘it’s a false news story’ (second item). Hit that and Facebook will be notified. \nAfter due process and verification, that specific post should already stop making its way to people’s news feed. You can also use this method to report other posts that you think are not supposed to be seen publicly on Facebook by clicking through to See more options. \nIf a post is racist, has someone buying and selling things like shotguns, marijuana, or adult items — these can also be brought up to Facebook’s attention. Again, actions will be taken after the post has gone through the company’s verification process. \nTogether, we can hopefully push for having a healthier news feed every time we browse.",

      "title": "This doctor didn’t think her Facebook post about Michelle Obama was racist. She was very wrong.",
      "text": "By Patrick Hogan \nDr. Michelle Herren has some interesting ideas about what is and isn’t racist. \nIn Facebook comments last week replying to a Facebook user praising First Lady Michelle Obama, the Colorado-based pediatric anesthesiologist shared her racist opinion on the woman, clarifying in the process that it wasn’t actually racist. \n“Monkey face and poor ebonic English!!! There! I feel better and am still not racist!!! Just calling it like it is!” wrote Herren. \nIn a great argument for never making Facebook comments ever, Herren’s employers are not pleased with the post and the publicity its gotten and are cutting ties with the doctor. A spokesperson for the University of Colorado’s School of Medicine told the Denver Post it was beginning the process of firing Herren . \n“She has expressed values that are at odds with ours and she has compromised her ability to meet the teaching and patient care mission of the School of Medicine,” CU spokesman Mark Couch told the Post . \nHer other employer, Denver Health Medical Center, announced in a statement that Herren had resigned in a “mutually agreed” decision. The hospital previously had released a statement saying it disagreed with her posts, but could not control its staff members’ opinions. \nWhen reached for comment by local TV station The Denver Channel, Herren said she did not know “monkey face” was considered a racist term and that she was trying to point out that people say whatever they want about Melania Trump without reprisal. \nHerren’s mention of Melania Trump in her defense is interesting, given the wave of social media posts using racist language to describe the First Lady, particularly in comparison to Melania Trump. They include: A Georgia teacher who called Obama a “ poor gorilla .” A West Virginia mayor who referred to Obama as “ an ape in heels ” and praised Trump as “dignified.” A Pennsylvania mayor who posted a picture of a wheelbarrow full of orangutans with the caption “ moving day at the Whitehouse[sic] .” An Alabama police officer who was fired after he posted a meme to Facebook saying that Trump was fluent in five languages, while Obama was “ fluent in ghetto .” An Alabama bank official who was also fired for posting that Trump was beautiful unlike “ the ugly and embarrassing woman .” Ann Coulter, who sought to criticize Obama’s praise of Beyonce, but ended up confusing Beyonce with Nicki Minaj . \nA lot of people seem very excited to Make the First Lady White Again.

(AP) — Police in one Pennsylvania town have sent an armed robbery suspect a message on Facebook, and it’s not because they want to be friends. \nBridgeville police say 32-year-old Robert Watkins III has been identified as the suspect in the Thanksgiving Day robbery of a Gulf station. \nThe police post, which includes the message, “It’s only a matter of time before we find you” shows several pictures of Watkins, and says he’s been identified through surveillance video at the scene. \nThe police believe Watkins may be headed to his hometown of Meadville, about 100 miles north of Bridgeville, in western Pennsylvania. \nOnline court records show police were still looking for Watkins on Monday on an arrest warrant for robbery and other charges. \n ",

Before you give, here are a few tips for making sure you make the most of your donation: \nENSURE: To make sure your gift is going to a good cause, research the organization and find out how it uses its money and how it's led. Charity Navigator, a non-profit that rates and ranks charities, says charities that are an open book and follow good governance practices are less likely to engage in unethical or irresponsible activities. Its free database at charitynavigator.org can give you an assessment of the financial health, accountability and transparency of 8,000 of the country's best-known charities. It's also a source of information on more than 1.5 million nonprofits. \nVERIFY: The IRS reminds taxpayers that only donations to certain eligible organizations are tax-deductible. To find out if your donation applies, use the \"Select Check\" tool on the IRS.gov website to search a database of eligible organizations. Most churches, synagogues, temples, mosques and government agencies are eligible to receive deductible donations even if they are not listed in this database, the IRS says. \nITEMIZE: In order to deduct your charitable donation, you must itemize on your federal tax return. That means people who choose the standard deduction or file using simplified forms such as 1040A or 1040EZ may miss out on this tax perk. Most tax software will alert you to the tax savings available if you itemize versus using standard deductions. \nJUSTIFY: If you donate money, you need a bank record or written statement from the charity to prove the amount. This could include a canceled check, credit card statement or more. If a payroll deduction was made, the taxpayer should hold on to a copy of the pay stub, a form W-2 or other document from the employer showing the amount donated to the charity. \nASSESS: The rules are slightly different when you donate goods instead of money. Deductions for clothing and other household items are limited to the item's fair market value, which you can find out more about on IRS.gov. Items must be in good or better condition to be tax-deductible. If the donation is worth $250 or more, you must also get a written acknowledgment from the charity. Special rules apply to donations of cars, boats and other types of property. Appraisals are often required for larger donations of property. Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2gJbFTL",
