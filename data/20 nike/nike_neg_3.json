Now the pair join forces once more to craft the Nike Air Zoom Legend, a futuristic take on the iconic Chelsea boot. The shoe places a classic high-cut silhouette with elastic sides, atop a technically advanced sole unit. Tisci commented that special attention was placed on the design of the heel which protrudes from the midsole in an angled cap. Details are a little unclear as to all of the technical specs, but are bound to be clarified in the coming weeks. \nThe Riccardo Tisci x Nike Air Zoom Legend will drop in two colourways exclusively at NikeLab’s Soho store on November 11. \nMore Riccardo Tisci x Nike: ",

In the years since, he has worn more than 60 different Nike Mercurial boots, scoring goals, breaking records, and amassing trophies along the way.'  \"The successful partnership between Nike and Ronaldo will continue well into the future with a new, long-term contract.\" Ronaldo issued a video statement saying the contract is for life;\n“I have a great relationship with this brand, I have great friends here in the company.” “We work as a family too\" “This is my brand” This is for life.\" With this new deal, Ronaldo becomes the third athlete to sign lifetime deals with the Sports Wear giants, after Michael Jordan and LeBron James. \nThis post first appeared on Linda Ikeji's Blog.

      "text": "Share \nThe best innovation comes when you take a second to look at what you’ve already done, break it down to its constituent parts, and find a way to re-assemble it in a new and better way. By the looks of it, this is exactly how Nike’s newest sneaker silhouette, the LunarCharge, came together. \nThe shoe is a kind of mish-mash of technologies and styles from the past twenty or thirty years mixed with a more modern sensibility. With its neoprene and mesh upper the shoe reminds sneakerheads just as much of the 1988 Air Flow as it does the 1990 Current and Air Presto. It seems to draw so much from those old looks and materials that it comes off as part-homage to the old-school and part bold jump into the future with the inclusion of the new Lunarlon outsole. You can expect the first set of colorways for this new shoe to hit the shelves on the 18th of this month and the price tag to read an even $120. [ Purchase ]",

      "title": "Nike Could Come Under Pressure In A Trump Administration",
      "text": "Detroit Bear on Twitter Summary \nNike has been struggling in losing the fashion battle to adidas but a new negative factor may emerge. \nTrump has campaigned on 45% \"China\" import tariffs which would crush Nike's business. \nI fear Chinese consumers could also retaliate to anti-trade policies by cutting down on Nike consumption. \nShares need to go down significantly before I would consider a position in the company given the political risk. As if intensified competition from Adidas ( OTCQX:ADDYY ) and Under Armour (NYSE: UA ) wasn't enough, athletics giant Nike (NYSE: NKE ) could come under pressure from a Trump Administration. As a long-time healthcare investor, government intervention is something I take very seriously. Headline risk can weigh on a stock for an indefinite time, and if the market believes the threat is real enough, the risks can prevent shares of a company from ever approaching fair value. With Trump presumptively about to enter the White House, I would be very cautious with shares of Nike, potentially waiting to enter a position until the dust settles. Nike likely to struggle on multiple fronts with the possibility of attacks Given that Nike has historically done a significant amount of its third party manufacturing in China, I think Nike could face either import tariffs or instruction to bring manufacturing to the United States. Trump has thus far suggested an unsustainable 45% import tariff on all goods from China. While I am sure Seeking Alpha readers universally value basic economic principles like free trade, it appears the Trump Administration may not. Nike does have a diversified manufacturing footprint across Southeastern Asia, but I suspect Trump may be using China as a euphemism for all of our Southeastern Asian trading powers. Needless to say, this would wreak havoc on Nike's ability to supply the US market. I would hope that such drastic legislation is off the table, but I do not believe investors fully know what to anticipate at this time. If something to this extent does occur, I believe Finish Line (NASDAQ: FINL ) and Foot Locker (NYSE: FL ) will also see their businesses come under tremendous pressure. New Balance, in a shockingly political move, has come out to endorse Trump abandoning the Trans Pacific Partnership, hoping to create some artificial competitive advantages against the world's largest footwear maker. Supply assurances from New Balance could help envigorate a protest against Nike. Speaking of the Trans Pacific Partnership, I envision an environment where Nike is forced to invest capex in the US market to create domestic manufacturing to accommodate a protectionist government policy. Nike not only utilizes foreign labor, but it also uses a mostly third-party manufacturing chain. Therefore, the company could end up spending millions on capex that would otherwise go into new product development, marketing, and product innovation. This could put Nike at a great competitive disadvantage, as it will not be earning the highest returns possible on its investments. One further negative impact could be a trigger of global nationalism set-off by protectionist policies. Chinese consumers love the Nike brand, but I think anti-trade policies could irritate the Chinese government and Chinese consumers to hurt Nike's brand equity in the burgeoning nation. This would be a positive for domestic producers like Peak and Li-Ning. Protectionist, anti-free trade policies negative for many companies, particularly footwear Ultimately, free trend remains a tenant of basic capitalist policies. While the President-elect has campaigned upon abandoning these basic principles that have helped America prosper, I hope that the new administration will seek to help both the United States and China prosper. Engaging in a trade war, irritating one of the US' most prominent and innovative companies (Nike), and making popular goods significantly more expensive in the United States are simply not good policy. However, I feel like political risk is heightened in Nike, as it relies so heavily on free trade with Southeast Asia to generate returns for shareholders. As a result of the increased headline risk, I am going to remain on the sidelines on Nike for now. I could be tempted to start a position if shares break to $40, but I am deeply concerned that the company is on the precipice of facing risks brought on by its own government.

      "text": "The New Air Max Plus Model from Nike is Patterned with Stunning Blue Water By: Riley von Niessen   nike & hypebeast Looking to give its consumers reason to celebrate with a summery footwear alternative, Nike released a new Air Max Plus dubbed the 'Swimming Pool.' The colorway immediately reminds one of an exotic resort's promotional photos, with a design of vibrantly blue clear water decorating the entirety of the upper. This theme is carried through the lining, laces and tongue as well, however the sole contrasts it in white. The crisp hue from the supportive sole is extended up to part of the upper as well, helping the pool-inspired pattern to transition. Standing out from this, a 'TN Air' logo appears on the heels of the new Air Max Plus model in bright yellow. Meanwhile, Nike's branding is shown in blue embroidery on the tongues of the sneakers.",

      "title": "Nike Signs Ronaldo's Adept Feet - And Thumbs - 'For Life' 11/10/2016",
      "text": "Real Madrid forward Cristiano Ronaldo has signed a contract extension with Nike that will last his lifetime, according to reports, and is said to be worth $1 billion. \nThe 31-year-old superstar is captain of the Portuguese national team that won the European Championship this year and has been named world player of the year three times, the Associated Press reports . He has been on the Nike roster since 2003.\n“I have a great relationship with this brand,” Ronaldo said in a statement that is vague on the financial details of the “long-term” contract and heavy on product. “I have great friends here in the company. We work as a family, too. This is my brand.”\nIn a video release , the galactico says: “I look at this new contract [as something] for life,” and he describes the deal as “the best contract that I have in my whole career,” Fortune reports. The top name on  Forbes ’ list of  The World’s Highest-Paid Athletes also extended his Real Madrid contract through 2021 on Sunday.\n“With his new Nike deal, Ronaldo becomes the third athlete to sign a ‘lifetime’ endorsement with the company, reports Ahiza Garcia for CNNMoney . “Nike also has ‘lifetime’ deals with NBA greats Michael Jordan and LeBron James. … Nike has paid Jordan over $473 million since 1993, even though he retired in 2003.”\nWhat merits such a payday, you ask?\n“Ronaldo will always be best known for the incredible goals he has scored in Nike Mercurial boots,” the release tells us. A photo gallery highlights 30 of them — pristine versions of the cleats, that is, not the goals — from the orange 2003 Mercurial Vapor that Ronaldo wore when he signed with Nike as an 18-year-old playing for Lisbon’s Sporting CP to the soon-to-be–unleashed 2016 Mercurial Superfly V CR7 Discovery. (That’s a mouthful, isn't it? “Okay, give me a pair of those Mercurial Superfly V CR7 Discoveries and a package of socks.”) \nThe release also credits Ronaldo for “extensive feedback and insights” on design and says “his commitment to fitness has also informed Nike’s training products, while his style is regularly on display in Nike Sportswear.” \nNeil Hopkins, director at M&C Saatchi Sport & Entertainment, says the deal “underlines how valuable [Ronaldo] is to the brand as they trade blows with Adidas and their star performer, Lionel Messi ,” writes The Drum ’s Tony Connelly.\nGavin Peters, director of partnerships at Pitch, points out how Adidas' and Nike's approach to marketing their brand ambassadors differs. \n“Adidas tends to focus more on the lifestyle and attitude around football, and using that to appeal to a younger audience, especially on social,” Peters tells Connelly. “Nike’s content, on the other hand, tends to be more around high-performance — it’s about aspiring to be the best you can be.”\nBut make no mistake. Ronaldo’s social media presence is a huge part of his marketability. He was, earlier this year, the first Nike athlete to don its HyperAdapt 1.0 shoes, touts yesterday’s release. He did it in an Instagram post that has garnered 3.8 million views and more than 22,000 comments.\nIndeed, with a total of 238 million followers on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram, Ronaldo is the most followed man in the world on social media, Sport  reported in September. Singer Taylor Swift, however, has 246 million followers, according to a report by Apple Tree Communications. But Ronaldo beats out Katy Perry (219 million), Selena Gomez (205 million) and Rihanna (190 million). \nIn August, Ronaldo released an app that allows fans to take a selfie with him. A portion of the proceeds benefits Save the Children, ESPNFC  reported . That portion could add up to quite a sum.\n“Ronaldo generated $36 million in value for Nike on social media alone via his own accounts through 59 posts over the last 12 months, according to a study of the top-paid athletes by Hookit, which tracks sponsorship value in social and digital media,” Kurt Badenhausen reported for Forbes in June. “All of Ronaldo’s partners got a total of $176 million in media value from his promotional work on social platforms.”\nAnd those posts are not dying on the vine.\n“Interactions for each of Ronaldo’s promoted posts — ones that included a hashtag or mention — averaged 651,778, according to Hookit,” Badenhausen writes.\nRonaldo’s thumbs, in other words, are as adept as his feet.",

      "text": "In addition to the previously featured Nike Air Force 1 Low NYC , the classic silhouette will be offered in two more iterations to celebrate the grand opening of Nike’s new retail store, located in the SoHo district of Manhattan. \nUnlike the aforesaid pair, these variations are punctuated by laser-etched detailing that is prominent on the swoosh branding for one model, while the other incorporates it across its entire upper. The intricate motif features 30 years’ worth of Air Force 1 icons and graphics. \nComplemented with bright orange and white accents to cap off its respective colorway, you can purchase the models exclusively at the new Nike Soho store only, starting tomorrow, November 11 at 529 Broadway in NYC. \nh/t: Nike \nAuthor’s Take I prefer these offerings more than the previous pristine iteration. The laser etchings are a cool touch and it holds commemorative value. \n\nThe post Two Additional Nike Air Force 1 Low NYC Styles Will Debut At Nike SoHo appeared first on KicksOnFire.com .",

Metallic red bronze accents throughout further complements the design, while it’s topped off with an icy translucent outsole unit. \nWith its retail price listed at $150, you can expect to find this Saucy pair at select Nike stores starting December 15th. \nImage: Nike \nAuthor’s Take One of the best iterations of the silhouette so far this season in my opinion. Maybe I’m just biased towards the colorway, but, this should be sought after. \n\nThe post The Nike KD 9 Sauce Drops Next Month appeared first on KicksOnFire.com .",

      "text": "Nike Inc (NYSE: NKE ) is slated to open its new store in Soho, New York , officially on November 11. It is a five-story, 55,000 square foot store. \nBarclays’ Matthew McClintock maintains an Overweight rating on the company, with a price target of $65. The New Store \nMcClintock mentioned that “the store incorporates many new features that create an immersive experience into various sports.” \nFor soccer, the store has 400 sq. ft. for boots and staffed with a soccer expert, while for running, there is an “immersive treadmill running experience” to help customers try out the technical and comfort aspects of their choice of shoes. \n“In basketball, the floor's 23 foot ceilings cover a 700 sq. ft. playable basketball court that also creates an immersive virtual experience and is staffed by an expert in basketball,” the analyst explained. Innovations \nThe company has also added other innovations, such as an Airforce One Nike ID segment that will rotate creations of local designers every two weeks. \nMcClintock believes the store represents “the next step in the physical brick and mortar channel towards experiential retailing, something that few traditional apparel/ footwear brands can match.” \nOn November 8, Nike signed a new “lifetime” deal with Real Madrid star, Christiano Ronaldo. Ronaldo is the third athlete to have signed such a deal with the company. \nHowever, Nike is expected to continue to face challenges in the medium term , especially give the increasing competition in the United States.

      "text": "While the limited edition John Elliot x Nike LeBron Zoom Soldier 10 is set to debut tomorrow exclusively at Nike SoHo, official imagery of this Space Jam/Sacramento Kings-themed variation of the silhouette have released, which indicates its arrival to be very soon. \nDraped in a classic palette, tonal black dominates its upper and distinctive straps, while contrasting accents of white are implemented on the midsole and Swooshes. Subtle purple accents adorn the inner lining, as it’s all adhered atop an icy translucent outsole to finish off the respective theme altogether.\nAn official release date has not been announced yet, but, stay tuned to KicksOnFire for further updates.\nImages: Nike \nAuthor’s Take I like how the colorway is reminiscent of the Space Jam 11s. It’s a versatile look overall and this should garner the attention it deserves. \n\nThe post Official Images Of The Nike LeBron Zoom Soldier 10 Sacramento Kings appeared first on KicksOnFire.com .",

To coincide with the NBA’s annual Hoops for Troops Week, JB created special PEs worn that were worn by Russell Westbrook, Chris Paul, Blake Griffin and Frank Kaminsky. Westbrook wore the Air Jordan XXXI, Paul the CP3.X, Griffin in the Super.Fly 5, and Kaminsky in the Air Jordan XVI Retro. All pairs were done in earth tones and done in desert camo motifs. \nThe night also featured some marquee matchups. James Harden and his adidas Harden Vol.1 got the best of Kawhi Leonard and his Air Jordan XXXI in an exciting showdown in San Antonio. The Curry Brothers—Steph and Seth—squared off in Oakland with both rocking the Under Armour Curry 3. In that game, Harrison Barnes and Andrew Bogut faced off against their former team for the first time. Barnes rocked the adidas Crazy Explosive while Bogut—who normally wears the Nike Hyperdunk 2016—did not play. \nCatch up on the rest of the night in NBA Kicks in our latest gallery. Tags:",

      "text": "When Nike lovers walk into the athletic giant’s new storefront in New York City on its opening day, they could pick up a pair of shoes reimagined by celebrated designer John Elliott only available there.\nAvailable Friday is the John Elliott x Nike Zoom LeBron Soldier 10, exclusively sold at the brand’s latest Soho door. Related Here's What Nike's New Soho NYC Store Looks Like \nElliott has worked with the NBA superstar’s signature shoes in the past, although this is the first to appear in stores. In 2015, the designer reimagined the Nike LeBron 12 for his debut New York runway presentation.\nThe designer is an admitted LeBron James fan, of his play on the court and his sneaker franchise with Nike.\n“Stylistically, he bridged the gap between the previous generation of athletes and a new era. … I bought the Zoom Generation. I think it was the first time for me in my life that I ever bought a shoe made for someone who was younger than me.  I can remember thinking like, ‘Whoa. This is a real paradigm shift,’” Elliot said in a statement. “The LeBron 8 is definitely a favorite of mine too. I had friends that hooped in those and the shoe translated off the court, those I think are iconic.”\nAlthough the Zoom Generation, LeBron 8 and LeBron 12 are personal favorites of Elliott, it was James’ performance in Game 3 of the 2016 NBA Finals — where the baller debuted the LeBron Zoom Soldier 10 — that made him want to work with the silhouette.\n“Seeing him in game three this summer, in that all-black Soldier X, that was like another moment where I don’t think I’ll ever be able to erase. There’s that kind of wow, like ‘Oh my God’ moment about it. You knew that something was about to go down,” Elliot said. “The all-black Soldier, it’s a beautiful and disruptive design. It was almost a little bit of foreshadowing, really, for what was about to happen for the rest of that series. You couple that with the way that he played in the shoe, it is silhouette that I think instantly became iconic. The people who love it do so because it’s new and because it’s unexpected. It was instantly something that I was attracted to.”\n👀 @kingjames @nikelab \nA photo posted by JOHN ELLIOTT (@johnelliottco) on Nov 7, 2016 at 3:00pm PST \nLaunching 11/10 – Exclusively at the new Nike SoHo @kingjames \nA photo posted by JOHN ELLIOTT (@johnelliottco) on Nov 8, 2016 at 9:52am PST \nWant More? \nA Pair of LeBron James-Worn Sneakers From 2008 Is Selling for $3,000 \nWhy LeBron James Endorsed Hillary Clinton for President \nSee LeBron James School the Chinese National Basketball Team ",

      "text": "Ahead of tomorrow’s much-hyped release, here we get a closer look at John Elliott’s new Nike LeBron Solider X. This of course isn’t the first time the menswear designer has worked on a LeBron shoe . One of the main goals with this most recent creation, however, is to celebrate the opening of the Swoosh’s new Nike SoHo store .\nIn speaking on LeBron James, his play and fashion sense, Elliott disclosed: “Each shoe seems to define a time period, an era for LeBron, and he’s obviously ahead of that curve, in play and style, before almost anyone. And I think it really helps kind of set that new path forward.”\n“Seeing him in game three this summer, in that all-black Soldier X, that was like another moment where I don’t think I’ll ever be able to erase…there’s that kind of wow, like “Oh my God” moment about it,” he went on to add. “You knew that something was about to go down. The all-black Soldier, it’s a beautiful and disruptive design. It was almost a little bit of foreshadowing, really, for what was about to happen for the rest of that series.”\nThe LeBron Solider X by John Elliott in turn boasts sublimation print on the straps and upper, 3M reflective accents, orange detail, and a glow-in-the-dark sole.\nThe sneaker ($200 USD) will be releasing exclusively at Nike SoHo tomorrow, November 11.\n",

      "text": "SoHo, Manhattan —City leaders have a message for Nike – Just don’t do it.\nProtesters will be joined Thursday by Manhattan Borough President Gale Brewer, Councilwoman Margaret Chin, NY State Sen. Daniel Squadron and Assemblywoman Deborah Glick to rally against a new SoHo Nike store, which is scheduled to open Friday.\nThe Department of Buildings shouldn’t have allowed Nike to open a big-box store in an already over-saturated shopping corridor, Chin said in a statement. The decision puts the interests of a corporation over the safety of pedestrians in the area.\nNiketown, located at 529 Broadway, is also adjoining a historic property on Spring Street, Chin said. The DOB’s decision to allow the company to build there also hurts the historic character of the neighborhood.\nPhoto Gallery View Gallery (4 images) The 55,000 square-foot store is designed to allow shoppers to get the full Nike experience under one roof, said Heidi O’Neill, Nike’s president of global direct to consumer.\n“With Nike Soho we can realize the promise of personalized performance,” O’Neill said. “Powered by immersive digital trials and in-store experts, this store is about elevating every athlete’s potential. Whether you’re training for a marathon, shooting hoops or doing drills on our in-store court, or if you love sneakers, Nike Soho will help you raise your game. Because it’s more than a store — it’s a personal sport experience.”\n40.723342 -73.999058 ",

      "text": "With Veterans Day just around the corner, sneaker brands such as Adidas ,  Nike  and Reebok are stepping up their military-inspired colorways and releases. The latest label to get in on the action is Jordan Brand, with a previously unseen makeup of a classic Air Jordan silhouette.\nOn Wednesday night, as the Charlotte Hornets improved to 6-1 with a 104-98 win over Utah, Hornets center Frank Kaminsky III was laced up in a camouflage-covered version of the Air Jordan 16.

AP Images The sneaker makes use of an olive green upper that’s accented with a woodland camouflage pattern across its side panels and tongue. Elsewhere, a gum rubber outsole helps tie the drab palette together. The Veterans Day-inspired Air Jordan 16 is then finished off with metallic gold lace tips.\nJordan Brand hasn’t confirmed any plans to release this colorway of the Air Jordan 16. However, the model, which originally appeared in 2001, is receiving the retro treatment from Jordan Brand.\nOn Nov. 5, Trophy Room, the Orlando, Fla., boutique owned by Michael Jordan’s son, released a limited-edition Air Jordan 16 collaboration . Meanwhile, the sneaker’s original “Midnight Navy” colorway is set to be rereleased on Dec. 22.\nWant more? \nJordan Brand Is Releasing a Long-Anticipated Colorway of Air Jordan 9s Plus a ‘Singles’ Day’ Collection \nA Look Back at the University of Oregon’s Exclusive Air Jordans \nLos Angeles Clippers’ Chris Paul Debuts Air Jordan 11 Player Exclusive ",

      "text": "Apple Watch Series 2 Nike+ Apple's partnership with Nike lives on with the Apple Watch November 10, 2016 9:49 AM PST Apple Watch Nike+ versus the Series 2. What's really different? by Brian Tong Close Drag \nApple and Nike partnered 10 years ago for a special edition iPod -- the Nike+ iPod -- to get you running to the beat. The music player came bundled with a wireless sensor that could be placed in select Nike sneaks and used to measure pace and distance when running. \nThe two companies have buddied up once again for a special-edition Apple Watch. The Apple Watch Nike+ edition combines all of the features found in the Apple Watch Series 2 , but adds new features that would appeal to runners. \nThe Apple Watch Nike+ is available now in 38 mm and 42 mm sizes for $369, £369 or AU$529, and $399, £399 or AU$579, respectively. That's the same price as the Series 2. James Martin/CNET What's different The Nike+ Run Club app comes preloaded on the watch and works with exclusive Siri commands, such as asking her to start a workout. The app also offers daily motivation through run reminders, challenges with friends and alerts for when the weather is sunny. The watch comes with a lightweight, breathable (i.e. it has holes in it) two-tone silicon strap that's exclusive to the Nike+ model. Color options include black and silver bands with accents in either gray, white or yellow-green (which Apple calls \"Volt\"). It also features two exclusive Nike watch faces that can be personalized to show activity data and heart rate, or provide quick access to the Nike+ Run Club and weather apps. What else can it do? \nOther than the features listed above, the Nike+ model is identical to the Apple Watch Series 2. It's the same size and weight, and it can be used to make phone calls (when your iPhone is connected) and run apps. \nIt also features the same ultra bright display, dual-core processor and swim-proof design as the Series 2. You can even download and use the Nike+ Run Club app on the Series 2 model, which also includes GPS, but you won't have the Siri integration and run reminders from the Nike+ model. \nWe'll have a full review of the Apple Watch Nike+ edition in the coming weeks.

      "text": "Nike Mercurial Superfly Cristiano Ronaldo Chapter 4 Boots - First Details Leaked   Nike just launched the Chapter 3 Nike Mercurial Superfly Cristiano Ronaldo soccer cleats . However, while he not even debuted the boots yet, we have already received the first concrete information about the Chapter 4 Nike Mercurial Superfly CR7 signature soccer boots. Embed from Getty Images Nike Mercurial Superfly CR7 Boots - Cool Grey / Metallic Hematite The new Nike Cristiano Ronaldo signature boots will be silver, just as the Champions League trophy and these Black, Metallic Hematite (dark silver) and Cool Grey (light silver) Nike shoes. Set to be released in March 2017, the Nike Mercurial Superfly CR7 Chapter 4 football boots will be silver (Officially Cool Grey and Metallic Hematite). And even though it is not certain yet, it seems very likely that the boots are inspired by the first Champions League trophy Cristiano Ronaldo won in 2008 when Man Utd bet Chelsea in the penalty shootout. No actual images of the upcoming Nike Mercurial Superfly Chapter 4 2017 Cristiano Ronaldo boots have been leaked yet, and there could also be another Cristiano Ronaldo boot between now and Spring 2017 in case the Portuguese superstar would win his next player of the year award. Nike Mercurial Superfly Cristiano Ronaldo Chapter 3 Discovery Boots In total, there will be seven boots in total detailing Cristiano Ronaldo's rise from his home island Madeira to one of the greatest footballers on this planet. There are no info about the Chapter 5 and Chapter 6 Cristiano Ronaldo boots yet, but expect them to be just as spectacular as the previous editions. Let us know what you expect for the next Cristiano Ronaldo boots in the comments below.",

And those included all-stars including Olympian Ashton Eaton, New York Giant Victor Cruz, and tennis ace Eugenie Bouchard. In between life-size mannequins floating in the store posed in athletic stances, guests like The Daily Show ’s Trevor Noah, Fabolous, and Chanel Iman checked out sick kicks including the self-tying style from Back to the Future II . But it was the uplifting energy in the space that brought everyone together for an evening that was celebratory, yet respectful.",

      "text": "View Gallery — 13 Photos \nWas scheduling a store party the day after the presidential election a good idea? It didn’t stop droves of sneaker and sport die-hards from turning out to fill the five-story behemoth of a new Nike store in SoHo Wednesday evening. The place was pretty packed and that’s saying something since it has 55,000 square feet to fill. It was a lot of ground to cover. \n“I’ve only seen half of it,” said Tinker Hatfield, one of Nike ’s most well-known sneaker designers, hanging out somewhere on the third floor. But he liked what he saw so far. “It’s the best reflection of Nike and our culture that I’ve seen yet,” he said. “The architecture is kind of secondary to the product and the way we want to present our storytelling. It’s quite different from [Niketown] on 57th Street. The architecture is heavy and kind of gets in the way.” \nMen’s wear designer John Elliot, who was just in from Los Angeles, was also working his way up the escalators. “I’m walking through right now. I’m on the second-and-a-half floor and it’s sensory overload,” said Elliott, whose design collaboration with LeBron James will be adding to the experience. Elliot’s new LeBron Soldier X sneaker will be exclusive to the SoHo store beginning Nov. 10 when it opens to the public. The place was so big, it was hard to spot the VIPs, including Nike athletes such as Victor Cruz , Ashton Eaton, Sanya Richards-Ross, Eugenie Bouchard, Matt Harvey and Vashti Cunningham, and fashion/art people like Tom Sachs, Shayne Oliver, Chanel Iman and Theophilus London.",

(Photo: USA Basketball) \nAsk any player in the Nike EYBL who the biggest trash-talker is during a game and they’ll undoubtedly tell you it’s Pebblebrook (Mableton, Ga.) combo guard Collin Sexton. \nThen follow-up with a question about which guard is the most dominant and, chances are, you’ll hear the same name. \nOn Thursday, Sexton announced that he’d be dishing out the in-game chatter and backing it up at Alabama next season, picking the Crimson Tide over Georgia, Georgia Tech, Kansas, North Carolina State and Oklahoma State. \nSexton had, arguably, the most dominant individual season of any player in his class this summer. He set the single-season scoring record on the toughest summer shoe circuit (Nike EYBL) averaging 31 points per game for Southern Stampede (Ga.). \nIn July, he led the USA Men’s U17 National Team to a gold medal at the 2016 FIBA Americas U17 Championship in Zaragoza, Spain, averaging a team-high 17 points per game as the sixth man. \nSexton earned MVP after going 8 of 9 from the field and scoring 16 points in the 96-56 gold win over Turkey. \nSexton, who is ranked No. 10 overall in the ESPN 100, averaged 29 points per game for Pebblebrook last season. \nSexton is Alabama’s fourth commitment from the 2017 class joining Pelham (Pelham, Ala.) forward Alex Reese, Hale County (Moundville, Ala.) guard Herb Jones and Clinton (Clinton, Miss.) center Galin Smith. \nHere’s what the Crimson Tide are getting in Collin Sexton. \nFollow Jason Jordan on Twitter: @JayJayUSATODAY",

      "text": "Nike SoHo opening deepens brand ties to NYC KO By Kyle O'Brien - 10 November 2016 18:25pm Nike SoHo opening deepens brand ties to NYC \nNike will always be associated with Oregon, especially since its world headquarters are located there and founder Phil Knight keeps deep ties to his alma mater, the University of Oregon. But Nike also has tied itself to New York, especially with its recent launch of Nike SoHo , a five-story, multi-sport category, 55,000-square-foot retail experience that will open in SoHo at 529 Broadway at Spring Street tomorrow. \nThe flagship store was designed to deliver the best of Nike’s personalized services, from exclusive trial spaces to product customization, creating a seamless link between Nike’s digital and physical platforms. \nTo help celebrate the launch and the prominence of the Swoosh in the Big Apple, Nike has launched a #NYMade campaign. The campaign features product, athlete and consumer moments across the city. \nOutdoor and digital marketing efforts will feature personalities with ties to the city, including Odell Beckham Jr., Victor Cruz, Serena Williams, Nas and Bella Hadid. Live events throughout the city will also happen at key locations, including with athletes Serena Williams (Nike SoHo), Victor Cruz at KITH x NIKE pop-up store, and designer John Elliot (Nike SoHo). \nThe efforts will also be promoted on a dedicated website that features the signature NYC Nike products, profiles and stories of NY athletes, notifications of exclusive product drops, news of training sessions, Nike services and glossy gear shots. \nThe launch will promote new collections and products, including the Gyakosou collection, the “What the Kyrie” and a special collaboration between Nike and Elliott. Additionally, in a unique sport and cultural crossover, a special basketball court designed by the artist KAWS, a giveback to the city, will be unveiled today at Sara D. Roosevelt Park. \n“New York is at the heart of Nike and Nike is at the heart of New York. We’re celebrating this city and the sport and energy that drives it through our best athletes and products. Nike understands better than anyone that if you prove yourself here, you’re New York Made,” Alero Akuya, Senior Brand Director for Nike in New York. \nBeyond the launch, the company says that “’NY Made’ will continue connecting with New Yorkers in new ways during the city’s most important sport and cultural moments.’",

All three feature tonal olive suede uppers with solid sail soles, but we can confirm that more tonal colorways are definitely on the way. There’s no question that all three retro basketball models will be prominent in 2017, but will they capture the Summer like the Air More Uptempo did? All three will begin releasing on Nike SNKRS, Nike.com, and select retailers beginning December 3rd. \"Air Jordan 4 Premium Ginger\" \"Nike Air Max Uptempo\" ",

For all you small footers out there (GS), check out this all-Wheat Nike Dunk that recently dropped.\nDone in a nubuck construction, the Wheat hue takes care of the entire base, while also extending to the laces and lining. Continuing the tonal look of the shoe is the gum sole placed below. Don’t sleep on this pair GS’ers, this is definitely a dope option for the current season. Out now, pick up a pair of your own at select retailers for $95.\n \nvia: @FootLocker on Twitter \nAuthor’s Take You can’t go wrong with this colorway on this model. I’d seriously consider picking up a pair had they made them in my size.\n\nThe post The Nike Dunk Wheat Is A GS Exclusive appeared first on KicksOnFire.com .",

Let us know your thoughts on the Nike Kobe 11 Elite Low Ghost Of Christmas Past in the comments below.\nvia: Nike \nAuthor’s Take Is this considered the equivalent to the Grinch colorway that we’ve seen in the past?

      "text": "Both Nike and Trophy Room, a boutique sneaker store, are launching campaigns this week. Nike’s effort coincides with the launch of Nike SoHo; a five floor, multi-sport, digitally connected store that opens Nov. 11. The \" #NYMade ” campaign celebrate’s Nike’s love of New York with key product, athlete and consumer moments. Inspirational personalities with special ties to the city will be featured in outdoor and digital marketing. They include Odell Beckham Jr., Victor Cruz, Serena Williams, Nas and Bella Hadid. \nNew collections and products including the Gyakosou collection, the “What the Kyrie” and a special collaboration between Nike and designer John Elliott will launch. Additionally, in a unique sport and cultural crossover, a special basketball court designed by the artist KAWS, a giveback to the city, was unveiled Thursday at Sara D. Roosevelt Park. \nThe Trophy Room, owned by Michael Jordan’s son Marcus, recently unveiled its exclusive Air Jordan + Trophy Room XVI Retro Bleu Français edition.\nA promotional campaign celebrating the shoe's official release is online at http://www.trophyroomstore.com . It was created by Valiant Pictures and director Masood Ahmed and features DJ Khaled. It includes a 30-second video spot that debuted online Nov. 9.\nTraveling to the exclusive Terminal 23 Jordan Brand facility in New York, the production team built a custom set to feature American record producer, radio personality and record label executive DJ Khaled interacting with the new \"French Blue\" edition.\nAccording to Ahmed, as a well-known Jordan advocate, DJ Khaled was a perfect fit for the promotion, especially based on his massive social media following. While the team captured HD imagery and footage to be distributed on YouTube, Facebook and beyond, they also produced imagery and video clips that DJ Khaled posted on Snapchat and Instagram that have gone viral.",

A look from the Nike Flex Momentum sunglass line. (WWD) Vicki M. Young | WWD \nNike Inc. has found a way to continue its momentum in building its women’s business through a new premium sports eyewear line targeting female athletes. \nThe new sunglass line from Nike Vision, a part of Nike Corp., is complementary to Nike’s existing women’s apparel and footwear product lines. And while the performance component is meant for active sports movement, its lifestyle orientation allows the eyewear to be worn during the day as a fashion statement. \nFollowing on the ath-leisure trend and working with its licensing partner Marchon Eyewear, Nike now offers five new sunglass styles that merge fashion and sport under the umbrella Women’s Training Collection. \nAccording to Stephen Tripi, marketing director at Nike Vision-Marchon, the new line replaces the existing unisex collection of sunglasses offered by Nike. Come spring, the activewear giant will complement the women’s line with a men’s training collection. In fall 2017, there will be additional sports sunglass lines targeting golf and skateboarding. \nTripi said the company in April began working on a different design direction for the eyewear. The first was a running collection that was brought to market in time for the Rio Olympics targeting track-and-field athletes, including a limited-edition called Wing — only five were made and all sold out, Tripi said — that sold for $1,200 each. The unique design was a single lens that wrapped around without need of any hinges or screws and featured a built in silicone rubber strap to loop around one’s head. \nFor the Women’s Training Collection, the four styles currently available are Nike Flex Motion, featuring rounded angles and mixed materials, $195 and $210; Nike Flex Momentum, a variation of the aviator style that allows for ventilation and a lightweight frame for comfort before, during and after a workout, $145 to $165, and Nike Flex Finesse, inspired by the cat-eye frame that can transition from workout to the rest of one’s day, $145 to $165. Nike Vital, $126 to $175, is a preexisting style similar to the original unisex frame, but featuring a rubber nose bridge and temples for stay-put comfort during “dynamic movement,” Nike said. The fifth style, Nike Helix Elite, features Zeiss Optics and is a one-piece lens incorporating rubber channels and ventilated temple arms for fog prevention. Pricing for the Helix Elite start from $195 to $210, and the style will be available in March. \nJustyna Szacon, the designer of the eyewear, said the collection was designed after obtaining feedback from female athletes on their needs based on performance and lifestyle. \nShe said that with the exception of Nike Helix Elite, all the styles could be fitted with prescription lenses. The lenses in the pairs that are sold are polycarbonate and have UVA and UVB protection. The frames themselves are lightweight nylon, and feature bendable rubber temple arms and nose pads. They also incorporate Nike Max Optics with lens tints engineered to provide protection from the elements. \nThe eyewear is available at nike.com, nikevision.com and at select optical retailers and online dealers. \nTripi said, “Nike is really going after the female consumer. The company has had great success in doubling its women’s business in apparel and footwear.” \nThe eyewear line will feature new colorways each season, syncing with the product offerings Nike has planned for apparel and footwear, Tripi said.

      "text": "Bad News About Nike's New 'Wheat' Sneaker A Dunk with the tonal flax look. By Brendan Dunne \nWe weren't kidding when we said Nike was going super hard with its \"Wheat\" sneaker releases this fall. The latest from the brand is a Nike Dunk High that uses the same tonal nubuck approach that has worked so well on other models like the Air Force 1 . \nUnfortunately, not everyone will be able to participate in this sneaker release. For now, it appears that the Nike Dunk High \"Wheat\" comes only in grade school sizes. \nThose who fall in that range can find this Dunk style now online through retailers like Foot Locker , Footaction , and Jimmy Jazz for $95.

      "text": "Cristiano Ronaldo Good news for Nike. Cristiano Ronaldo says he just signed a lifetime contract with the shoe giant in a deal that could be worth more than $1 billion.\nRonaldo has been with Nike since 2003 — and has since become one of the most famous and marketable athletes on the planet. In fact, Forbes listed him as the top earning athlete of 2016, raking in a whopping $88 million.\nNow, The Swoosh has just announced CR7 will be scoring goals in Nikes for years to come — saying, “The successful partnership between Nike and Ronaldo will continue well into the future with a new, long-term contract.”\nRonaldo issued a video statement saying the contract is “for life.” Financial details were not disclosed but Ronaldo is not coming cheap. To put it into perspective, LeBron James’ recent lifetime deal with Nike is reportedly worth more than $1 billion. Our Nike sources tell us Ronaldo’s deal is “very similar” to LeBron’s deal.",

      "text": "Nike SoHo a Go (NKE) By Dan Moskowitz | November 10, 2016 — 11:57 AM EST \nMost analysts love to hate NIKE, Inc. ( NKE ) right now. What those analysts might not realize is that, historically, Nike has always found a way to bounce back. This is often done by creating consumer excitement via innovation. Nike’s latest move is certainly unique, and it has potential to be a home run, touchdown, goal, three-pointer at the buzzer, new personal best – whatever you want to call it. It’s important to use a variety of sports because that’s Nike’s theme with its new Nike SoHo store, which opens tomorrow, November 11. (See also, Nike's Futuristic Shoes: All Hype? ) \nThe Nike SoHo store is 55,000 square feet spread across five stories. It’s located on the corner of Broadway and Spring St., and the way its lit up, you can’t miss it. Nike’s goal was to create a multi-sport experience retail store. That might sound confusing now, but you will understand in a minute. According to Nike, customers will have an opportunity to receive personalized service, including trial spaces and product customization, but that doesn’t do Nike SoHo justice. For a better understanding, consider some of the features on a floor-by-floor basis: \n1 st Floor \nNike+ Running Trial Zone for women (Nike+ Run Club with Nike Pacers an on-screen feedback. You can also change the scenery in front of you while running on the treadmill). \n2 nd Floor \nNike+ SNKRS Experience, which has the largest dual-gender footwear wall in any Nike store in the world at 54-feet wide. You will also find the largest selection of Nike Air Force 1s. \n3 rd Floor \nApple Watch Nike+ \nNike+ Running Trail Zone for men (same as Nike+ Running Trail Zone for women). \nNike+ Soccer Trial Zone (try on new cleats while playing on 400-square-foot area with synthetic turf field floor). \n4 th Floor \nRemains a mystery. You can visit tomorrow to find out. \n5 th Floor \nNike SoHo Jordan Project \nNike+ Basketball Trial Zone (try on new basketball sneakers while shooting hoops on half-court). \nOther Nike SoHo features include Nike By NYC (personalized studio where you can laser-engrave and print iconic NYC symbols on products), The Lounge (women’s boutique), Nike 12 Soles Collection (previews on display), and more. \nHeidi O’Neill, Nike’s president of global direct to consumer, said, “We’re leading the transformation of sport retail — offering the best of Nike products, services and experiences under one roof. With Nike SoHo we can realize the promise of personalized performance. Powered by immersive digital trials and in-store experts, this store is about elevating every athlete’s potential. Whether you’re training for a marathon, shooting hoops or doing drills on our in-store court, or if you love sneakers, Nike SoHo will help you raise your game. Because it’s more than a store — it’s a personal sport experience.” \nWith this unique location, Nike is demonstrating its leadership by changing the retail landscape. In the future, it might become the norm to have an interactive experience at sports-related retailers. In the case of Nike SoHo, itwon’t just be a retail store but a tourist destination. These types of innovations are why NKE has remained a quality long-term investment. \nNKE has depreciated 19.82% over the past 12 months and currently offers a dividend yield of 1.25%.",

Unfortunately, the wait to experience the location will be just a little bit longer. \nIn a statement issued by Nike, the company cites permitting issues in announcing that the SoHo grand opening has been delayed indefinitely. A new date will be communicated in the future, but the wristbands that have already been handed out will still be honored. See below for more information. \n“We look forward to bringing New Yorkers the best of Nike at our new Soho store. Due to permitting issues, the store will not open to the general public as planned on Friday, November 11th. We will communicate the new opening date as soon as possible. Scheduled product launches and consumer events are postponed until opening. \nAny consumers who were issued wristbands outside the store prior to 9 pm on Thursday, November 10th will still be guaranteed their place in line for styles that were scheduled to drop on Friday, November 11th . In order to guarantee this access, these consumers need to come to the store by 6 pm on Friday, November 11th with their wristbands to be informed of next steps and offered a sign of our appreciation. No additional wristbands will be issued. We will provide the new launch date soon.” Related Items",

      "text": "Tumblr Pinterest \nIt’s a short sneaker wrap this week with limited releases from both Nike and Adidas whilst the rest of the world are destroying their New Balance kicks over a convoluted Trump-support accusation. \nNonetheless there are still some notable mentions this week from smaller players like Asics, Diadora and Gucci. High tops have snuck in with two pairs in the form of new Jordans and the latest Tubular Invaders. \nKeeping it all classy is Gucci with their latest crocodile trimmed sneaker. \nShort and sweet?

Black and silver, the Nike Tiempo Legend 6 Tech Craft soccer cleats will be released before the end of the month. Nike Tiempo Legend VI Tech Craft - Black / Silver This is the Nike Tiempo Legend 6 Tech Craft football boot edition. Introducing a very traditional look, the first-ever Tech Craft edition of the Nike Tiempo Legend VI is black with subtle grey / silver accents. This secondary color is used mostly for the brandings and the sole plate of the Nike Tiempo Legend VI Tech Craft soccer boots. Unlike the other boots from the latest Nike Tech Craft football boot collection, the black and silver Tiempo Legend 6 cleats are basically the same as all regular editions that came before it. They feature a tongueless construction with a kangaroo-leather upper, while a new xray skeleton has been added to the Tiempo Legend 6 boots to allow for stitching to be reduced and subsequently improve durability. Set to be available from mid-November 2016, the black and silver Nike Tiempo Legend Tech Craft 2016-2017 cleats retail at a slightly higher price than the regular edition of the model. Tech Craft is back. What do you think of the Nike Tiempo Legend VI Tech Craft edition? Drop us a line below.",

      "text": "Forty years ago, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers entered the NFL as an expansion team. They lost their first 26 games. This week on Only A Game, former Bucs players share stories from those early years. Also, basketball sneakers used to just be basketball sneakers. Now they're status symbols. From Oregon to Japan to Chicago, we trace the history of Nike -- and meet Stephon Marbury, who's trying to change the sneaker game. And the USC basketball court is named after a former player who never averaged more than 10 points a game. Why? Find out on this week's show!",

      "title": "USA Water Polo Olympian Genai Kerr Looking Forward to US Sports Camps' Winter Nike 5meter Water Polo Camp in Florida",
      "text": "The Nike 5meter Winter in the Tropics Water Polo Camp will run December 27-30, 2016 at the renowned Ransom Everglades School. Directing the program is USA Water Polo Olympian, Genai Kerr. A true ambassador of the sport, Genai was a member of the United States Men's National Water Polo Team for 12 years, playing in the 2004 Athens Olympics, 2003 & 2007 Pan American Gold Medal games, as well as multiple World Championships. Assistant camp directors include Felix Mercado, Head Men's and Women's Water Polo Coach at Brown University and John Abdou, who previously served as the Head Men's and Women's Water Polo Coach at Bucknell University prior to accepting the role as Executive Director of the Association of Collegiate Water Polo Coaches (ACWPC).\nGenai directs the annual program for water polo players of varying skill levels, providing a multi-faceted experience for each athlete. “I love hosting this camp at Ramson Everglades School and working with players from around the country,” states Genai Kerr, \"It's always one of the highlights of the year for me.\"\nWinter in the Tropics is well-rounded combination of in-water instruction, dry-land fitness and an educational seminar making it a quality experience. The program provides a low camper to instructor ratio focusing on position specific training for drivers, shooters and goalies. Fundamental passing, shooting, team and individual defense along with tactical discipline and individual aspects of the game are emphasized and demonstrated in water by the staff on a daily basis through drills and scrimmages.\nPlayers, coaches, parents and others interested in additional information regarding availability, pricing and rooming please visit our Winter Water Polo Camp Page at http://www.ussportscamps.com/waterpolo/nike/water-polo-winter/ or call 1-800-645-3226\nAbout US Sports Camps\nUS Sports Camps (USSC) , headquartered in San Rafael, California, is America's largest sports camp network and the licensed operator of Nike Sports Camps. The company has offered summer camps since 1975 with the same mission that defines it today: to shape a lifelong enjoyment of athletics through high quality sports education and skill enhancement.",

      "text": "The Nike KD 9 Fire & Ice edition consists as a kids’ exclusive iteration of the silhouette, which takes inspiration from one of Kevin Durant’s memorable childhood moments. \nWhen practicing outside during the winter in Maryland, Durant would pour hot water on his hands to offset the temperature in order to continue perfecting his game. That defining moment is essentially symbolized on this pair, as one is rendered in red, while the other is draped in icy blue. \nIn addition, the toe section is comprised with a reflective accent, while each tongue tag bears the opposite color. Finally, all are adhered atop an icy translucent outsole.\nPriced at $125, you can purchase this limited edition pair at select Nike retailers nationwide now, starting today. \nImages: Nike \nAuthor’s Take This is one of the better iterations of the silhouette so far. I like the theme and the mismatching offering. I guess it is more suitable for children. \n\nThe post Mismatching For The Nike KD 9 Fire & Ice appeared first on KicksOnFire.com .",

      "text": "Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. says sales from its massive Singles Day shopping event totaled $17.8 billion, up more than 24% from the record $14.3 billion sold last year.\nThe most popular U.S. brands as of about 10:30 p.m. CST were, in order: Apple Inc. AAPL, +0.44% Nike Inc. NKE, +0.74% New Balance, Playboy, and Skechers USA Inc. SKX, +1.31%\n“Alibaba is using this year’s Singles Day to showcase the number of international brands participating, everyone from Apple, Victoria’s Secret, Burberry, Gap GPS, +1.47% , [and] Nike, acting as the gateway to China for these brands and fulfilling Chinese consumers’ insatiable demand for Western products,” said Danielle Bailey, head of Asia-Pacific research for L2 Inc.\nVictoria’s Secret is in the L Brands Inc. LB, +1.34% portfolio.\nSingles Day started strong, with sales of $1 billion recorded in the first five minutes .\nSee also: Backlash bites New Balance after backing Trump’s trade stance\nAlibaba Offers Virtual-Reality Shopping on Singles' Day (1:48) Alibaba is hoping to boost sales from China’s biggest annual online-shopping event--Singles' Day--with what it claims is the world’s first virtual-reality shopping experience.\nMany U.S. brands have tried and, so far, failed to find success in the Chinese market. Recently, Netflix Inc. NFLX, -1.05% said it would abandon efforts to launch a full-service offering in China.\nSee also: Netflix joins ranks of U.S. tech companies admitting they can’t conquer China\nWal-Mart Stores Inc. WMT, -0.39% announced in June that it would partner with Alibaba BABA, -1.36% rival JD.Com Inc. to grow its China business. The partners announced new initiatives in October.\nSee also: Wal-Mart’s deal with China’s JD.com may be copied by others\nApple and Nike are popular in China irrespective of the day, with Nike reporting 21% revenue growth in China in fiscal first-quarter 2017. The U.S. and China are Nike’s two biggest basketball markets, Trevor Edwards, Nike brand president, said on the Sept. 27 earnings call, according to a FactSet transcript.\nThe Playboy brand is also popular in China , with items like jewelry and fragrances selling well.\nStarbucks Corp. SBUX, +0.62% seized the opportunity to get into the Singles Day festivities, offering a Cocoa Java Mocha beverage exclusively for the day at locations across China. The company also sold gift sets, exclusively-designed gift cards, and limited-edition My Starbucks Rewards Cards 11/11.\nForty-seven million users purchased international brands, led by U.S. brands, according to L2 data, and 82% of sales were made on a mobile device.\n“With Alibaba distributing different deals across different devices, they have encouraged devoted savings seekers to keep separate shopping carts on their desktops and mobile phones,” said Tim Barrett, retail analyst at Euromonitor International. “Alibaba is grooming a generation of mobile-first shoppers, a move which will pay off greatly when the entire world is addicted to their mobile devices.”\nFor Alibaba Chief Executive Daniel Zhang, this integration of sales across different platforms is critical.\n“If you look at this as an online game, people see you will have less margin in the future,” Zhang said, according to the Alibaba live blog of the Singles Day event. “But when we look at the entire landscape, only 10% of China’s total retail is online. [W]hat we believe is that at the end of this, online and offline… should be fully integrated.”\nThis year, Alibaba introduced virtual reality into the 11.11 experience, as well as games, with 2.6 billion games played, according to L2.\nSee also: On Singles’ Day, Alibaba exec says U.S. needs China\n“Alibaba is blurring the lines between entertainment and e-commerce and extending technologies thought to be simply gimmicks in the West,” said Bailey.\nEven with the eye-popping sales numbers, popular brands and new technologies, Alibaba shares are down 1.4% in Friday trading.\n“In keeping with the de-emphasis of GMV [gross merchandise value] as a reported metric, we expect sales volume to become but one of many focuses of the event, with others being new mobile functionality, innovations and improvements in logistics, new partnerships,” said Deutsche Bank in a note published Tuesday, which calls Singles Day “a PR exercise.” Analysts there expected 35% year-over-year growth.\nDeutsche Bank rates Alibaba shares buy with a $138 price target.\nAlibaba shares are up 14.4% for the year so far while the S&P 500 SPX, -0.27% is up 5.7% for the same period.\nMore from MarketWatch Vice-Presidential Debate in Two Minutes Coal-mining boss: ‘Tesla is a fraud’ How Advanced Would Aliens Need to Be to Contact Earth?",

The branding on the side panels, heel, and tongue, have also been done in blue to match up with the rest of the shoe. \nThe Nike KD 9 Obsidian is expected to release on Black Friday, November 25th for $150. Stay tuned to Kicks On Fire for more images and release updates. \nvia: NYJumpman23 Author’s Take \nIf the Swoosh were a different color then these could have looked a lot better.

      "text": "Alex Reside 3 hours ago The new 5-story megaspace in NYC is the most fun you'll have buying stuff in person maybe ever. \nThe first time I visited New York City, I was 12 and with my mom. We did the tourist rounds—visited The Empire State Building, Times Square (and thanks to my mom, the Sephora in Times Square), but once all that was over, there was one place I made sure to see—NikeTown. The promise of five floors of endless Nike-ness seemed like heaven, not just because I was a young sneakerhead in the making. I, like many other young men around America, was obsessed with the Dipset/50 Cent variety of hip-hop that was most popular at the time. As a result of hours staring at the endless loop that was MTV Jams , I became enamored with the parade of white Air Force 1 sneakers (and maybe the women too) I saw in almost every video. I wanted a pair more than anything. But somewhere in the labyrinth of NikeTown I got distracted from my mission and ended up with a pair of blue and red Nike Dunks. On the train home to Connecticut, I immediately regretted the decision, feeling my new Dunks weren't actually cool, but instead looked like the de facto footwear choice of clowns. I asked my mom if we could go back and she declined. It made me want to go back to NikeTown again as soon as I possibly could. \nEvery trip thereafter, between 2003 and 2010 (when I moved here for a summer internship), I never left the city without stopping by Niketown. Shopping in a small, quaint boutique was fun in terms of actually buying things, but there was something exhilarating—especially as a kid—about diving head first into a brand's entire universe, particularly when that brand is as forward-thinking as Nike. That's why people love Apple stores (at least when they're not there to get something fixed), and why kids go absolutely bananas for Disney World. Sure, the rides are fun, but you go to forget the real world and to be showered in overwhelmingly positive Disney vibes. While Nike stores don't have people in costumes or log flumes or even spinning teacups, its brand new 5-story store in downtown New York delivers similar feelings of immersion and escapism. \nThe last time I visited the 20-year-old midtown NikeTown, it was starting to show its age. The new Nike store, on the other hand, is state-of-the-art everything (more on that in a minute) coupled with decidedly un-cluttered merchandising and floor to ceiling glass walls (24 feet high on the fifth floor). Shopping here gives one the impression is that this isn't so much a store as a sci-fi movie that takes place 20 years into the future. All you've got to do next is get outfitted in the fashions of the year 2036. \nThe constant rise of online shopping means that brands are thinking up new ways to re-imagine the real world retail experience. So far, the future of in-person shopping seems to be all about delivering new ways for a person to experience products before buying them. That experience can be as simple as trying on glasses at home or as futuristic as body scanning, but in the case of Nike's new store, it means being able to test sneakers in semi-realistic ways before handing over your credit card. On the first floor (women's running) is a treadmill surrounded by a near-180 degree LED screen. On the screen, runners can choose different environments to run in while testing out (with the help of a Nike Running employee) which Nikes work best for you. (And honestly, given the sheer volume of running shoes in the store, we're confident there's a pair for not just you, but probably everyone in New York City.) \nThe new store doesn't rely on virtual reality alone. The most impressive aspects are actually the real-life product testing facilities. On the top floor (Nike Basketball and Jordan Brand) is an actual half-sized basketball court for testing basketball sneakers, while on the third floor is a mini soccer field for trying out new cleats. (And trust me, it's not just for show. The employees really want you to use them. I was asked three times if I wanted to try out some new cleats and kick around the mini-field, despite the fact that I am a person who calls the world's most popular sport soccer.) \nOn the Nike Sportswear floor, a 50 foot wide wall of sneakers is awe-inspiring, and the repetition of Swooshes eliminates any last shred of doubt in your subconscious as to which brand's store you happen to be in. Here is where the fusion of Nike's unwavering commitment to innovation and top-tier aesthetics merge in the form of fishtail parkas made of the brand's proprietary Tech Fleece fabric, sweatpants, and collaborative items with some of the world's most renowned fashion designers. If Nike is indeed losing ground to Adidas's Originals and Yeezy product lines amongst the kind of \"cool guys\" that New York City breeds, then this floor—with its expertly-styled mannequins dressed in head-to-toe athleisure— is its best rebuttal yet. \nElsewhere on the NSW floor is an Air Force 1 customization bar, anchored by a wall full of pristine white low-top versions of the iconic style. In a store full of new-age technology with boatloads of wow-factor, it's the thing that grounds the space in some sense of reality or nostalgia. Rather than transport me to the future, the wall of Air Force 1s hypnotized me. I stared at it while imagining the endless ways I could customize the style to my personal tastes. Then I realized I didn't want to do that. I actually didn't want anything else in the store but a pair of box-fresh, all-white Uptowns. When I walked in, I didn't want anything, and that's what's the real magic of any store is, right? At the end of the day, Nike might be brilliant at creating their idealized world view in retail form, but like Disney, it's no secret that it's all in the interest of getting you to buy something. But it sure it a fun place to visit, even if you're just window shopping. \nNike Soho is located at 529 Broadway in New York City. It was originally scheduled to open November 11, but will now open early next week. GET THE",

A true ambassador of the sport, Genai was a member of the United States Men's National Water Polo Team for 12 years, playing in the 2004 Athens Olympics, 2003 & 2007 Pan American Gold Medal games, as well as multiple World Championships. Assistant camp directors include Felix Mercado, Head Men's and Women's Water Polo Coach at Brown University and John Abdou, who previously served as the Head Men's and Women's Water Polo Coach at Bucknell University prior to accepting the role as Executive Director of the Association of Collegiate Water Polo Coaches (ACWPC).\nGenai directs the annual program for water polo players of varying skill levels, providing a multi-faceted experience for each athlete. “I love hosting this camp at Ramson Everglades School and working with players from around the country,” states Genai Kerr, \"It's always one of the highlights of the year for me.\"\nWinter in the Tropics is well-rounded combination of in-water instruction, dry-land fitness and an educational seminar making it a quality experience. The program provides a low camper to instructor ratio focusing on position specific training for drivers, shooters and goalies. Fundamental passing, shooting, team and individual defense along with tactical discipline and individual aspects of the game are emphasized and demonstrated in water by the staff on a daily basis through drills and scrimmages.\nPlayers, coaches, parents and others interested in additional information regarding availability, pricing and rooming please visit our Winter Water Polo Camp Page at http://www.ussportscamps.com/waterpolo/nike/water-polo-winter/ or call 1-800-645-3226\nAbout US Sports Camps\nUS Sports Camps (USSC) , headquartered in San Rafael, California, is America's largest sports camp network and the licensed operator of Nike Sports Camps.

      "text": "Nike N7 Celebrates 2016 Native American Heritage Month on the Hardwood Share Share Image \nFor 2016, Nike N7 is proud to partner with nine colleges (across men's and women's programs) to honor Native American Heritage Month. \nDuring select men and women’s basketball games throughout November and December, Florida State, Gonzaga, Haskell Indian Nations University (the only all-native school in the country), Nevada, New Mexico, Marquette, Oklahoma State, San Diego State and Stanford will each wear N7-inspired turquoise uniforms. Turquoise represents harmony, friendship and fellowship in Native American culture. 2016 NIKE N7 Men's Uniforms Share Image \nSince the N7 turquoise uniform was first worn in 2010, participation in the program has grown organically — building from a single school to nine. \nWhile all partner programs support Native American Heritage Month on the hardwood, each school also initiates its own outreach to local Native communities. This includes basketball camps at Gonzaga, Marquette and Nevada; a Native youth spring field day at Oklahoma State; and Seminole Tribe of Florida youth programs with Florida State. \nSan Diego State works with N7 Fund grantee Inter Tribal Sports to highlight its Native youth sports program, hosting an a basketball camp in the spring. Additionally, the New Mexico men’s and women’s teams auction their uniforms and donation proceeds to local Native American youth organizations. 2016 NIKE N7 Women's Uniforms Share Image \nThe uniforms also complement the Nike N7 Spirit of Protection Collection , encouraging resilience against adversity and inspiring youth to “Dare to Rise” against obstacles. NCAA teams in N7 turquoise uniforms this month will have the option of wearing the collection’s N7 2016 Hyperdunk. Marquette will wear the N7 Jordan 31. 2016 Nike N7 NAHM Uniform Schedule Men's Games",

      "text": "The Rise Of Nike — And One Former NBA Player Trying To Change Sneaker Culture November 12, 2016 close more The Jordan brand from Nike played a big part in turning shoes into status symbols. (Mario Tama/Getty Images) \"When I was a kid, you got Keds. If you were playing basketball, you got Converse, and that was kind of it,\" says Rick Telander, late of Sports Illustrated, longtime recreational basketball player. \"And if you ran track, you just took whatever, say, the school gave you, or whatever they had at the sporting goods store.\" Fast-forward to the present. Over the past 40 years, the shoes in which famous and wealthy men play basketball in the NBA have become desirable to people who play basketball at a much lower level … and to people who don’t play basketball at all, and that has led to some grim results. The Birth Of Nike But first things first, and one of the first things of note in this story is Phil Knight. As a young man in the mid-'60s, Knight saw a need for better track shoes. He built a partnership with manufacturers in Japan, where the labor was less expensive. Knight had decided that without an Olympian in his shoes, his company would lack status. In 1976, Frank Shorter stepped to the Olympic marathon starting line to defend his gold medal. Shorter was supposed to be wearing what Knight was selling. But when the camera zoomed in on Shorter’s feet, he wasn’t. In a new book, \" Shoe Dog ,\" Knight recalls how he slipped from his recliner to the floor, drew the curtains and switched from water to vodka. It was a rare setback. By the mid-'70s, at an industry conference in Chicago, Knight was able to crow that he wasn’t in the shoe business: he was in the entertainment business. It followed that Knight had to have more entertainers in his shoes. In 1977, somebody from Nike got a pair of shoes called the “ Senorita Cortez ” to Farrah Fawcett, then starring in a TV show called “Charlie’s Angels.” The shoes showed up on screen. And according to Knight, by noon the next day, every store carrying the Senorita Cortez had sold out. Even that was small potatoes compared to what Phil Knight and Nike would eventually accomplish in terms of creating a need. 'Gotta Be The Shoes' In 1984, Nike established a partnership with a basketball player who had failed to make his high school team as a sophomore, and then had a pretty good run at the University of North Carolina. But when he came to Chicago to begin his pro career, he was not exactly a celebrity. \"He didn’t even have a ride to pick him up to take him to the hotel where they were staying,\" Rick Telander says. \"And a guy, a limo driver named George Koehler, happened to be there. He recognized Michael. Michael was just standing there on the curb with his bags. And George said, 'Hey, man, you’re Michael Jordan. You need a ride?'\" Jordan initially had no interest in Nike. He’d worn Adidas shoes in college and saw no reason to switch, until Nike and Jordan’s agent provided him with about 7 million reasons. Phil Knight was able to bankroll that kind of agreement because he’d been building his shoes in ever-less expensive places, all of them free of the labor laws in countries like the U.S. Michael Jordan didn’t ask any questions about that, and he no doubt relished the opportunity to become an influential presence in the lives of lots and lots of people who might not have known a Chicago Bull from a Detroit Lion, but who were ripe for a salesman’s pitch based on a fellow who could fly. \"Very early on, they had Spike Lee. Spike Lee used his brilliance with Michael Jordan,\" Telander explains. \"That classic line: 'Mike, is it the shoes? Is it the shoes? It’s gotta be the shoes!' And the question was obviously it is the shoes for you, kid, that makes Michael Jordan so special.\" The company’s profits soared. But Rick Telander was beginning to notice something ominous. The Ugly Side Of Sneaker Culture \"This is back when the internet was pretty new, so I would collect, actually, as I traveled around the country, I would read newspapers and I’d cut the clippings out,\" Telander says. \"They’d be on the crime page, or whatever.\" Before long, Rick Telander had enough clippings to convince his editors at Sports Illustrated that there was a story. Children without new sneakers were mugging — sometimes even murdering — the kids who had them. But for the story to resonate, Telander felt he’d better include Michael Jordan himself in the narrative. Fortunately, they had a relationship. \"I’d known him. We talked to him whenever we wanted,\" Telander says. \"So after practice, we went into this little room. And I just broke it down for him.\" \"They’re selling a false reality in the game of basketball, if you think that you’re going to take flight like Jordan. It’s an illusion.\" Stephon Marbury Telander told Jordan about a ninth-grader found strangled in a Maryland high school, killed by a basketball teammate for his Air Jordans. He told Jordan about a 13-year-old shot dead in Detroit for his sneakers, and a 17-year-old in Georgia, robbed of his money and murdered for his shoes. \"And I bring up this issue and said, 'What do you think? This is for real. Do you take any responsibility for this?' We talked for a long time,\" Telander says. \"He started to come to tears. I think they were authentic. I think they were genuine.\" \"I thought I was helping out others and everything would be positive,\" Jordan told Telander . \"But when it comes to kids killing each other, then you have to reevaluate things.\" But no “reevaluation” was apparent. Jordan continued to partner with Nike, and Nike continued to manufacture the shoes for very little and sell them for a lot. Sometimes over $200 per pair. The $15 Shoes Trying To Change The Game Among those impressed by those ads was a young man in the projects in Coney Island, New York. \"Easter was a time when everybody got new clothes,\" Stephon Marbury recalls. \"Everyone would wear their best outfits to church and then they’d go and wear their best outfits after church to go to the amusement park and to get on the rides. You really wanted to have the newest trend in shoes, which were the Jordans.\" Marbury had six siblings, and his mother was having none of his pleas for new Nikes. \"Jordan, those $200 sneakers you’re selling? Kill it, man. Stop poisoning the hood, man. It’s time for change, man. Let it go, man.\" Stephon Marbury \"Oh, there wasn’t no convincing her,\" Marbury says. \"I’d beg her, but I already knew it was pretty much an automatic 'No.'\" But, who knows? Maybe the “No” helped motivate Marbury to become a good enough basketball player to make the NBA. Because that’s what he did. He played for 13 years. And by that point, he’d seen the ads for the shoes for what they were. \"They’re selling a false reality in the game of basketball, if you think that you’re going to take flight like Jordan,\" Marbury says. \"It’s an illusion.\" Marbury was also aware of the illusion that went beyond basketball. He began publicly challenging the man he felt was responsible. \"Jordan, those $200 sneakers you’re selling? Kill it, man. Stop poisoning the hood, man. It’s time for change, man. Let it go, man,\" Marbury said in a recent video . Marbury is relaunching the Starbury shoe line, which debuted in 2006. (Peter Kramer/Getty Images) For the last several years, Stephon Marbury has been playing pro basketball — and winning championships — in China, where he has become something of a hero. He’s also gone into the shoe business by relaunching the Starbury , a $15 sneaker he first marketed 10 years ago. He sees himself as kind of an anti-Jordan. \"For kids to kill another kid for a pair of Jordans, I think that’s brainless,\" Marbury says. \"But the people who are behind that and knowing that this is going on, it seems to be a little heartless.\" The Starbury brand has already provided Marbury with encouraging stories. \"It’s cool. One kid saved his money and went and spent his $15 to buy a pair of shoes,\" Marbury says. \"It was one of the cutest little things, seeing a kid actually saying, 'I have $15. My mom doesn’t have to buy my shoes anymore. I can buy my own shoes.'\" Starburys haven’t got Phil or Michael shaking in their Air Jordans. But the relaunch has given youngsters and their parents an alternative. This time around, Stephen Marbury hopes it will be an alternative that will last. \"This is something that’s needed, because I was one of those kids,\" he says. \"It’s not to go against Jordan or to go against Nike. It’s to actually set an example for them. This is forever.\" “Forever” might be a stretch. It might be a start. Related:",

      "text": "KAWS x NIKE: stanton street courts transformed as part of 'new york made' initiative nov 11, 2016 KAWS x NIKE: stanton street courts transformed as part of 'new york made' initiative \n\nNIKE has collaborated with artist and designer KAWS to drench new york’s stanton street basketball courts in color. the mural is part of the wider ‘new york made’ project, celebrating the opening of NIKE’s new five storey SoHo store. \nthe installation is part of the wider ‘new york made’ project \n\n\nNIKE’s ‘new york made’ campaign sees the worldwide athletic brand work alongside NYC’s parks and recreation department to set in motion a number of city-wide events and installations honoring the city, and the iconic brand’s new york roots. ‘new york made:stanton street courts’ is the first in the series, and features a collaboration with popular artist KAWS as he transforms the stanton street courts with a vast, floor-wide mural. the completion of the piece coincides with the opening of NIKE’s new digitally connected, 55,000 square foot store in SoHo. \nthe completion of the piece coincides with the opening of NIKE’s 55,000 square foot store in SoHo. \n\n\nbrooklyn-based brian donnelly (KAWS) designed the mural to embody NIKE’s dedication to athleticism, community, culture and collaboration. ‘I always think about when I was young and the things I had interaction with, whether it was skateboard graphics or magazines, and how art reached me. I’ve been conscious of how my work disseminates and reaches people. It could be a canvas in a museum…or it could be a court, a wall or a t-shirt,’ says KAWS. ‘I like the idea of public art because it reaches people in a casual way, and when they aren’t necessarily looking for it.’ \nthe mural aims to embody NIKE’s dedication to athleticism, community, culture and collaboration \n\n\nthe mural takes is a pastiche of coloured shapes and lines, intersecting and contrasting across the court. in the foreground, two elmo-inspired silhouettes face off against each other — not dissimilar to KAWS’ elmo/cookie monster ‘BFF’ design — featuring donnelly’s trademark crossed out eyes motif. the artist explains that his approach to working on the larger scale court was in practice similar to the one he takes on more conventional, canvas-based projects. what changes is the relationship between court and player — the fact that this would be an interactive work was forefront in his mind: ‘I wanted to find the sweet spot where it works visually and functionally — how it’s broken up by the game’s lines and works with my images. it will have an intimate effect on the players that use the court.’ \nthe fact that this would be an interactive work was forefront in donnelly’s mind \nKAWS has a longstanding relationship with the iconic sportswear brand \ndonnelly is brooklyn-based, but originally hails from new jersey \nthe mural is a first in a series of city-wide initiatives to celebrate the opening of NIKE’s new location",

      "text": "The Nike SB Zoom Stefan Janoski Green Velvet has no ties to the holidays, but I wouldn’t be surprised if it becomes a highly coveted sneaker during these holiday months. Rocking a Green tonal upper, let’s take a closer look.\nThe shoe starts off with a Green Velvet upper that takes care of the entire base of the shoe. The same hue is found on the laces and lining. Giving it even more of a holiday theme is the Red plaid sockliner. Hits of Black are noted on the Nike Swoosh, while the all-White sole cleans things up a bit. Said to be dropping before Christmas, stay tuned to find out when you’ll be able to pick up a pair of these.\n \nvia: Titolo \nAuthor’s Take Pretty sweet to see velvet on the Janoski. Just when you think you’ve seen it all, Nike SB goes on and surprises you once more.\n\nThe post On-Feet Shots Of The Nike SB Zoom Stefan Janoski Green Velvet appeared first on KicksOnFire.com .",

      "text": "These Are the 12 Coolest Sneakers of the Week \nFrom Jordan, Adidas, Nike, Reebok, and more. Adidas By Pete Forester Nov 11, 2016 \nThis weekend, many are going to jump into retail therapy—something that might be the right choice for you, too! There's no shortage of dope sneakers releasing, but the two highlights are collaborations: John Elliott's understated pair of Nikes and Palace's irreverent collection with Adidas. Reebok also presents two collaborations, each with a unique texture that makes them really special. Adidas' work with Parley for the Oceans finally becomes available in the near future for those who have been looking forward to it, but don't expect that to be an easy buy—that's what everyone's looking at this week.   Nike x John Elliott Zoom LeBron Soldier 10 \nJohn Elliott continues bringing his mind to Nike's LeBron styles in the first official collab between the man and the brand. His Zoom LeBron Soldier 10 features the expected platinum upper with a hit of orange in the sole, an artfully designed ombé treatment on the throat, and a glowing outsole for a surprise in the dark. \nRelease: 11/11 \n$200, available exclusively at Nike's new SoHo store Nike Flyknit Racer \"Earth Tones\" \nThe perennial favorite, Nike's Flyknit Racer, returns this weekend in a new \"Earth Tones\" colorway. The subtle, heathered shifts of blue all over the upper make for a look that's sophisticated, sitting on a silhouette that's more than earned its street cred. This is a good choice if you don't have many sneakers in your closet and are looking to add more. \nRelease: 11/11   Reebok x Hall of Fame Question Mid \"Black Braid\" \nHall of Fame has joined Reebok in its celebration of the Question's 20th anniversary, reaching into Allen Iverson's style history for inspiration. This time they looked to his signature cornrow hairstyle, a real statement at the time of his career, developing it into this \"Black Braids\" interpretation of his shoe. The sneakers use braided suede through the length of the shoe, while the rest of the upper is done up in tonal suede and leather that sits on a while midsole and black outsole. \nRelease: 11/11 \n$175, rise45.com Reebok x Solebox Classic Club C 85 \"Year of the Court\" \nUsing a classic tennis shoe and tennis inspirations, Solebox brings a welcome new texture to Reebok's Club C 85. The two brands looked to the overlapping leather of a tennis racket handle, replicating that look and feel over the entire upper. The shoe is almost exclusively turquoise, with hits of grey at the heel and red stitching through the sole. The understated silhouette with a color as special as turquoise makes this sneaker something truly different. \nRelease: 11/11   Nike Sock Dart \"Wool\" \nContinuing the ongoing trend of woolen sneakers are this week's \"Wool\" Sock Darts from Nike, which are exclusive to U.K.-based sneaker store size? Here's the thing: Sock Darts can't literally be made of wool on account of their socklike construction—but the weave of the material has been heathered to reflect that look. The style is a hard sell for winter because of its breathability but at least these will give you that cozy look. \nRelease: 11/11 \n£100‎, size.co.uk Nike Dunk High SB Red Velvet \nIf it's beginning to look a lot like the winter holidays, you can thank Nike. Velvet is always a welcome addition and here we find it in saturated red on a pair of Dunk His. These are a festive pair that will serve you all year, whether you're getting into the holiday spirit or not. \nRelease: 11/11   Adidas 350 Suede \nHistorically, Adidas' 350 has rarely been seen in the U.S. And for good reason: It was never meant to be. The sneaker was created for the Asian market in the 1980s, but was brought back recently for global consumers. This version of the 350 is an exclusive to UK retailer size? and features a retro colorway with minimal construction. A fresh classic and a classy sneaker. \nRelease: 11/11 \n£80‎, size.co.uk Greats x Lardini Wooster \nOne of the crown jewels for Greats brand has been its relationship with Nick Wooster, the unopposed street-style god. Their ongoing collaborations have resulted this week in a pair of slip-ons created with Italian suiting specialist Lardini. The mismatched pairs come in two fabric styles, donegal tweed and herringbone tweed, and are just formal enough to fool your boss to thinking that you're not wearing sneakers. \nRelease: 11/11   Adidas x Palace Indoor Suede / Leather \nPalace continues its ongoing collaborative relationship with Adidas in the new collection \"All Day Ich,\" a play on the urban legend that A.D.I.D.A.S. stands for \"All day I dream about soccer.\" The comedic advertising supports relatively conventional court shoes in old-school Adidas colors. These are agile, light sneakers that deliver the message of athleticism without the bulk of basketball shoes. \nRelease: 11/12 \n$130, adidas.com Adidas x Packer Shoes NMD \nPacker Shoes is celebrating its legacy of almost 100 years in the footwear industry with a retro-inspired colorway of one of this era's favorites. The Adidas NMD is made up in colors that reflect classic 1980s tracksuits, and features Adidas' Primeknit on the upper. The release for these will be relatively limited—a bolder sneaker that you'll still be able to grab if you try hard enough. \nRelease: 11/12",

By Brendan Dunne \nWhat else is on the way for the Nike KD 9 besides that Christmas pair previewed this week? It looks like Nike will soon release this pair, an obsidian colorway that hasn't been through the cycle of leaks that these shoes are used to. \nFrom this vantage point there don't appear to be any special material applications on this KD 9 —the shoe looks to be standard issue mesh and Flyknit. \nStay with Sole Collector for sneaker release date info on this model and follow the Nike KD 9 here for updates on what's to come from Kevin Durant's latest silhouette.
