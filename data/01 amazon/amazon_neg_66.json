      "text": "© 2016 Time Inc. All rights reserved. Amazon Employee Attempts Suicide After Sending Email to Colleagues \nAn Amazon employee jumped from a building at the company’s Seattle headquarters after reportedly sending a disgruntled email to CEO Jeff Bezos and hundreds of his co-workers. \nThe man, whose name is currently not public, survived the 12-story fall. He was critically injured and taken to a local hospital shortly after, Bloomberg first reported. Police reported the incident as a suicide attempt. \nPrior to the incident, the man requested for a transfer to a different department within the company, Bloomberg reports. Instead, however, he was placed on an “employee improvement plan”—a step that could result in his termination from Amazon amzn if his performance didn’t improve, notes Bloomberg. \n\nIn the email, the man reportedly criticized the company’s handling of his transfer request and “hinted that he might harm himself,” a person familiar with the matter told Bloomberg. \n“Our thoughts are with our colleague as he continues to recover,” an Amazon spokesperson told Fortune in a statement, who declined to comment on the matter further. “He’s receiving some of the best care possible and we will be there to support him throughout the recovery process.”",

      "text": "Home Business   Discounts At Amazon Following Cyber Monday   Discounts At Amazon Following Cyber Monday Jennifer Hong Nov 29, 2016 Business Comments Off on   Discounts At Amazon Following Cyber Monday 1 \nShoppers are getting ready for Cyber Monday as they browse ads at Amazon.com and other online retail outlets. Far more Americans shopped online than in stores over the Thanksgiving-Black Friday weekend. \nA survey released by the National Retail Federation and Prosper Insights & Analytics estimates that some 122 million Americans will shop online on Cyber Monday. That’s up only slightly from last year’s 121 million shoppers. \nBut the increase is notable coming off the Thanksgiving-Black Friday weekend that saw 108.5 million people shop online, well above the 99.1 million who hit stores. What’s more, major retailers, notably Walmart WMT 0.56% started their Cyber Monday sales way earlier than in preceding years, lest they cede a millimeter of the market to Amazon.com . \nIn much the same way Black Friday, as an event, ended up being diluted by Thanksgiving store openings (that started in 2011) and deals starting earlier in November, Cyber Monday is losing some of its impact as a one-day event. In addition to Walmart and Amazon’s deals being spread out, Target is offering discounts on Sunday as well, not only online but, more crucially, in stores. That move, which reflects how people shop in the year 2016, is also meant to lower stress on Target’s web page, which last year buckled under the intense e-commerce pressures that come hand in hand with Cyber Monday . \nThe evidence of the migration of shopping to e-commerce is incontrovertible: Adobe told Fortune on Sunday that e-commerce sales between Thanksgiving and Saturday rose 17.3% to top $7.2 billion. \nWithin e-commerce, a key shift is continuing: some 28 million of those shoppers plan to shop Cyber Monday deals from their phones, continuing a trend that explains why the likes of Walmart, J.C. Penney JCP -1.43% and Kohl’s KSS -1.30% have invested heavily in their mobile shopping apps. \n“The brick-and-mortar retailers have made a big leap with their online efforts this year,” Moody’s analyst Charlie O’Shea told Fortune this weekend.”They’re really getting it.” And they need to: as Fortune reported on Friday, Amazon has said it is featuring 75,000 deals during the week of Cyber Monday. \nWalmart says 60% of Black Friday sales event orders placed on Walmart.com came from mobile devices, something the company says shows customers are growing more comfortable with pushing the “buy”button on smartphones. That retailer has been trying to hook people away from Amazon onto its shopping and mobile payment apps. Walmart has a lot riding on Cyber Monday: It recently finished an overhaul of its marketplace business, something that has allowed it to nearly triple its product assortment in the last year (and offer many items it would never offer in store, like Michael Kors KORS 0.66% handbags). \nOf course, all stores have been stress testing their websites to make sure they can withstand what will be an extraordinary amount of traffic on Monday. That’s for good reason–the security firm Upguard recently estimated that just ten minutes of downtime could translate to a loss of over $2 million in sales.",

      "text": "amazon echo successor touchscreen review macro logo More Greg Mombert/Digital Trends\nSo far, Amazon has released three devices powered by its Alexa service — the Echo, Tap, and Echo Dot. All of these offer the same basic functionality in different form factors, basically functioning as speakers that can also serve as the hub of the user’s smart home. This similarity across devices looks like it won’t last forever, though, as the firm’s next Alexa-powered product could feature a touchscreen, according to a report from Bloomberg .\nThe device’s touchscreen will reportedly measure seven inches and would be powered by a modified version of FireOS, the operating system powering Amazon’s Fire tablets and Fire TV devices. The product would be the largest yet of any of Amazon’s Alexa-powered offerings, and would tilt upward to be easily seen when placed on a kitchen counter.\nMore: Amazon has introduced an Alexa skills marketplace\nKeeping with this kitchen theme, Amazon is said to be working on a feature that would allow users to pin photos to the device’s display, similar to pinning photos on a refrigerator with magnets. Bloomberg’s sources say that the form factor and touchscreen will make it easier to use the device to access information like news, weather forecasts, and calendar appointments.\nDespite the touchscreen, the new device would still have a strong focus on audio, as the Alexa Voice Service is the key to all of Amazon’s smart home products. The product is also rumored to feature high-quality speakers, which would make it a better choice for listening to music than any of the company’s current offerings.\nMore: What can’t she do? The best ways to use Amazon’s Alexa around the house\nThis isn’t the first time we’ve heard of such an offering coming from Amazon. Earlier this year, rumors surfaced that the company was working on a product code-named “Knight,” which was said to have a touchscreen. Whether this is that product getting closer to market or a wholly different product isn’t clear.\nAmazon’s newest product could ship as soon as early as 2017, but so far there has been no word on pricing, other than that it will be more expensive than the company’s $180 Echo.\nAmazon is having a 1-day sale on the Echo, $40 off Amazon brings Alexa to its line of tablets, starting with the Fire HD 8 Fabriq wireless speaker offers multiroom sound, Alexa-powered smarts",

      "text": "Amazon.com is developing a premium Echo-like speaker with a screen, a sign the world's largest online retailer is trying to capitalize on the surprise success of its voice-controlled home gadgets and fend off competition from Google and Apple.\nThe new device will have a touchscreen measuring about seven inches, a major departure from Amazon's existing cylindrical home devices that are controlled and respond mostly through the company's voice-based Alexa digital assistant, according to two people familiar with the matter. This will make it easier to access content such as weather forecasts, calendar appointments, and news, the people said. They asked not to be identified speaking about a product that has yet to be announced.\nThe latest Amazon speaker will be larger and tilt upwards so the screen can be seen when it sits on a counter and the user is standing, one of the people said.\nHigh-grade speakers will make the gadget sound much better than current Echo devices, this person also said. Amazon's new device is scheduled to be announced as soon as the first quarter of 2017, this person added. Amazon, based in Seattle, Washington, declined to comment.\nAmazon CEO Jeffrey Bezos: Privacy, security debate is 'issue of our age' Hayley Tsukayama Amazon chief executive Jeffrey P. Bezos said Wednesday that his company is wholly aligned with Apple in its fight against government investigators who asked Apple to break its own encryption programs so they could gain access the iPhone used by one of the San Bernardino, California, terrorists.\n... Amazon chief executive Jeffrey P. Bezos said Wednesday that his company is wholly aligned with Apple in its fight against government investigators who asked Apple to break its own encryption programs so they could gain access the iPhone used by one of the San Bernardino, California, terrorists.\n... (Hayley Tsukayama) So-called smart home gadgets are one of the latest computing battlefields fought over by the largest technology companies. However, they have so far failed to match the popularity of smartphones and personal computers. Amazon's hardware track record has been mixed too, with the disappointing launch of the Fire Phone in 2014. Its Echo speakers have been a surprise hit though, with Consumer Intelligence Research Partners estimating U.S. sales of more than 5 million units since 2014.\nAmazon's planned expansion of the Alexa-powered line coincides with growing competition from Alphabet Inc.'s Google Home speaker and Apple Inc.'s interest in building a home device using its Siri digital assistant.\nThe new Amazon device will use an optimized version of Fire OS, the software that runs Amazon's Fire tablets and Fire TV set-top box. The gadget will still respond to verbal commands and spoken questions, just like current Alexa devices. Amazon is also testing a feature that allows users to pin items such as photos on their speaker's screen akin to physically placing items on a refrigerator door, one of the people said.\nAmazon plans to keep selling the Dot, Tap and Echo speakers that are typically stationed in living rooms and bedrooms, one of the people said. The current speakers cost $50, $130 and $180, respectively, while the model with a screen will likely be priced higher, the other person said.\nSome reviewers panned the current Echo for poor audio quality, which is partly due to Amazon designing it to sound better at moderate volume levels, according to one of the people. The new speaker will play high-quality audio at all volume levels, this person said. At least one prototype version of the device places the speakers below and behind the screen, they added.\nThe Wall Street Journal reported earlier this year that Amazon's Lab126 hardware unit was working on an Alexa-powered device featuring a tablet-like computer screen known internally as \"Knight.\"\n Amazon.com Inc.",

      "text": "Christian de Looper/Digital Trends\nEarlier this month, LeEco — known as the “Netflix of China” — finally made its latest phones and TVs available in the U.S. — but there was a catch: They were only available via the company’s LeMall website. After a month of flash sales, the company’s products will finally be available on LeMall at any time, but that’s not the biggest news — the company also announced on Tuesday that beginning December 1, its phones and TVs will also be available from a number of U.S. retailers.\n“We continue to bring to life our vision of a connected ecosystem that puts content at the center of the experience. With [Tuesday’s] announcements, we are making our premium products and the best content even more accessible,” Danny Bowman, LeEco North America chief revenue officer, said in a statement. “We’ve had tremendous success with our direct-to-consumer ecommerce site, LeMall.com, but we’re thrilled to be working with the top retailers to make our products more accessible.”\nMore: Le yea! LeEco’s new phones and TVs are finally on sale in the U.S.\nSpecifically, LeEco phones and TVs will be available at Best Buy locations, as well as at wireless dealers for carriers that offer LeEco phones. In addition to physical locations, LeEco products will also be available via online retailers like Amazon and the Best Buy and Target websites.\nThe December 1 launch date comes one day after the launch of the new DirecTV Now live TV streaming service, and that’s not a coincidence. The two companies have teamed up to offer DirecTV Now subscriptions to customers purchasing select LeEco products.\nCustomers buying the Le S3 or Le Pro3 smartphones or Super4 X3 Pro ecotv will receive access to DirecTV Now for three months, while those buying a Super4 X55 or Super4 X65 TV will get six months of service. Customers buying the company’s flagship uMax85 TV will receive a full year of DirecTV Now service for free.\nMore: Hands on with DirecTV Now, AT&T’s new streaming service starting at $35\nWhile LeEco may be making its products more easily available, it is still trying to draw customers to its LeMall online store by offering rebates ranging from $80 to $200, depending on the product.\nWho certified the exploding Samsung Galaxy Note 7 safe?

      "text": "Subscribe on YouTube\nAlexa might get touchy\nAmazon’s Echo smarty homebot device is just over two years old, so with preschool approaching for digital assistant Alexa, it looks like daddy Jeff Bezos may be giving his digital kid a new toy: a touch screen. According to multiple sources including Bloomberg, a new premium version of the Echo is likely to include a touchscreen that will show news, weather, calendars and, of course, shopping information.\nThe Echo has been a bit of a surprise hit for Amazon, and competition, most notably from Amazon with their Home device, has quickly sprung up, with more on the way, likely from Apple, Microsoft and other tech big hitters. Bloomberg said the new device will be larger than the current Echo and the screen will be optimized for operation while a user is standing. The as-yet unnamed device will likely debut in the next few months at the top of the range.\nJust imagine the lines\nThe interwebs are swimming in iPhone 8 concept images these days, and the rumor mill is fairly choking on possible features: a top-to-bottom OLED display, a possible curved design, new long-range wireless charging, better dual cameras, new faster chips and so on. But what all the hype may really signify is that demand for the iPhone 8 – if it even comes close to living up to all the hype – will be positively gigantic when it finally arrives.\nMing Chi Kuo of KGI Securities, who has a strong record of correct iPhone prognostications, says upstream parts suppliers are already preparing to supply bits for between 120 and 150 million iPhone 8s. That’s a tidal wave of iPhones to be sure, and best of all, the rumors are pushing other phone makers, especially Samsung, to up their game as well. Ten years after the first iPhone redefined what a smartphone could be, it looks like the iPhone 8 could do it again.\nThe politics of bits, bytes and dollars\nAT&T is shaking up the telecom industry with its DirecTV Now streaming service , which offers a lot of TV for just $35 a month and even more if you double up to $70. But the real news here is how DirecTV Now could be the tip of the spear that pierces the net neutrality shield the FCC put in place last year. AT&T says their new service will not count against data caps for existing customers, but if you’re NOT an AT&T data systems customer, it most definitely will.\nThat’s called “zero rating,” and it’s a little-known codicil in the FCC’s net neutrality rules that agency head Tom Wheeler said the agency would look at “case by case.” Problem is, Hillary Clinton lost the election, and President-Elect Trump’s new FCC overseers, one of whom will very likely eventually head up the FCC, are positively anti-net neutrality , and those “case-by-case” reviews of zero ratings are likely about to become a very distant memory.\nBottom line: AT&T will be able to favor, or zero-rate, its own service, of course, while possibly throttling and charging non-AT&T data customers for every bit and byte of video they download. The Trump administration sees this as healthy competition. Others see it as a vertical monopoly by AT&T, which, in case you forgot, is about to also swallow up Time-Warner . Yes, it’s complicated, so check out this in-depth article from our friends at The Verge on this important topic.\nWant to wake up with Jeremy Clarkson?

      "text": "Boxes move along a conveyor belt inside an Amazon.com fullfillment center in Robbinsville, N.J. (David Williams/Bloomberg) Did you know that you can hire a company to write glowing recommendations about the products your business sells on Amazon.com, regardless of whether they bought them or not? You can. And, unfortunately, more than a few merchants use this deceitful tactic to bolster their products’ ratings.\nNot anymore, says Amazon.\nJust in time for the peak holiday buying season, the online giant announced a change in policy that will limit customers to only five reviews a week for “non-verified” purchases – in other words, items that Amazon cannot confirm were purchased on its site or those given to customers at a huge discount in exchange for positive feedback.\nAs reported in the Digital Reader , a group of “prolific reviewers” received an email from Amazon telling them that they’re welcome to leave as many reviews as they want for products that they actually buy on the site, but would now be limited for all others. The policy doesn’t apply to books, music and video.\n“The limit is five and the count is calculated from Sunday at 12:00am UTC through Saturday 11:59pm UTC.” said spokeswoman Angie Newman via an email to Geekwire . “We’re always innovating on behalf of our customers and shoppers consistently tell us that they value reviews from other shoppers who they know have purchased the product on Amazon.”\nAmazon says the vast majority of reviews are authentic, but the company admits fake reviews are growing too fast. That’s why, according to Geekwire, the company recently filed suit against a bunch of businesses that allegedly sell fake reviews as well as the companies that bought them. In addition to these actions, the company is also now giving more weight and visibility to verified customer reviews with written comments. (Amazon.com chief executive Jeffrey P. Bezos owns The Washington Post).",

      "text": "Roadside, Amazon Team Up for Iraq War Thriller ‘The Wall’ \nAaron Taylor-Johnson film follows studios’“Manchester by the Sea” collaboration Meriah Doty   2:53 PM \"The Wall\" (David James Courtesy of Amazon Studios) \nAfter partnering on this year’s acclaimed indie weepy “Manchester By The Sea,” Amazon Studios is collaborating with Roadside Attractions again to distribute its psychological thriller “The Wall.” \nThe film will be directed by Doug Liman and stars Aaron Taylor-Johnson and John Cena . \nIt will be distributed by Roadside, set to open in theaters on March 10, 2017. \nAlso from Tuesday’s announcement: \n“The Wall” follows two soldiers pinned down by an Iraqi sniper, with nothing but a crumbling wall between them. Their fight becomes as much a battle of will and wits as it is of lethally accurate marksmanship. Directed by Doug Liman (“Mr. & Mrs. Smith,”“The Bourne Ultimatum,”“Edge of Tomorrow”), “The Wall” stars Aaron Taylor Johnson (“Nocturnal Animals,” Kick-Ass,”“Savages”“Godzilla,”“Avengers: Age of Ultron”) and WWE star John Cena (“Trainwreck,”“Daddy’s Home”), Written by first-time screenwriter Dwain Worrell, “The Wall,” was produced by Amazon Studios, Big Indie Pictures and Picrow. The film is produced by David Bartis. Executive Producer is Ray Angelic. Associate Producer is Alison Winter. FilmNation is handling international sales. \nAlong with Kenneth Lonergan’s “Manchester By The Sea,” Roadside and Amazon have previously partnered together on other recent films including Whit Stillman’s summer hit “Love & Friendship” and Spike Lee’s “Chi-Raq.”“Manchester By The Sea” has already earned more than $1.6 million in ticket sales and successfully expanded this past weekend to 48 theaters. The film will expand to 150 theaters this weekend. \n“Manchester By The Sea” was named Best Picture this morning by the National Board of Review along with three other wins including Best Actor ( Casey Affleck ), Best Original Screenplay (Kenneth Lonergan), and Best Breakthrough Performance, Male (Lucas Hedges). Casey Affleck won Best Actor at the Gotham Awards last night. Additionally, the film was nominated for 5 Spirit Awards including Best Feature. Show Comments",

      "text": "Amazon \nA lot of investors look at Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) and see a company with unparalleled distribution capabilities or a market-leading cloud computing service. What I see, though, is the place people go to shop online.\nWhile that might sound completely obvious, it's an advantage that's hard for competitors to overcome. In America, 55% of online shoppers begin their product search on Amazon.com, according to a recent survey from BloomReach . I'm willing to bet a large percentage of shoppers end their product search on Amazon as well.\nThat influx of shoppers leads to more product creators and merchants wanting to get their products on the virtual shelves of Amazon so their items show up in shoppers' product searches. That inimitable shopper behavior is at the core of one of Amazon's three pillars: its Fulfilled by Amazon program.\nCan't be beat Amazon is rapidly building out warehouses and distribution centers. Last quarter, it opened 18 new warehouses, and it's already opened five more this quarter. But even at this breakneck pace, it's competing with retailers that already have significant real estate footprints like Wal-Mart ( NYSE:WMT ) and Target ( NYSE:TGT ) . Both have taken steps to utilize their stores' footprints more effectively for fulfilling online orders.\nWhere Target and Wal-Mart can't compete with Amazon is in driving traffic to their websites. Wal-Mart went out and bought Jet.com because it's been able to rack up significant interest in a short amount of time. Target has succumbed to offering loss-leading promotions like free shipping on all items during the holiday season to drive traffic. Meanwhile, Amazon increased its threshold for free shipping, a luxury afforded by its ability to attract shoppers.\nA virtuous cycle With the amount of traffic Amazon attracts, third-party merchants and manufacturers want to get their products on Amazon. Amazon has cultivated a huge marketplace with third-party merchants and presents it all seamlessly to its visitors. Many customers don't even know that about half the items sold on Amazon.com come from third-party merchants and are simply fulfilled by Amazon.\nThe Fulfilled by Amazon (FBA) program is one of the three pillars of Amazon's business, according to its management. (The other two are Amazon Web Services and Prime.) FBA allows merchants to send inventory to Amazon's warehouses, and Amazon takes care of sending individual shipments to customers. In return, it takes a fee. The program has been the main driver of Amazon's warehouse expansion efforts.\nBut as more and more merchants come to Amazon, more and more shoppers are able to find items that fit exactly what they're looking for at the price they want to pay. That, in turn, drives more merchants to the platform, because that's where all the shoppers are going. This virtuous cycle is what allows Amazon to continue growing its sales at a faster pace than Wal-Mart of Target, despite a significantly larger base.\nAbout $0.20 of every $1 Amazon brings in from its North American marketplace comes from FBA merchants, according to estimates from R.W. Baird analysts. That number will continue to grow as more merchants come to the marketplace.\nWhile Wal-Mart and other big-box retailers offer a marketplace for third-party merchants online, none offer the supply of shoppers that Amazon has. Growing an active shopper base is significantly more difficult than building out the infrastructure needed to store and ship all the items those shoppers are purchasing. That makes Amazon's shopper base one of its biggest, most obvious, but oft-overlooked competitive advantages.\nNOW WATCH: Here's why some people have a tiny hole above their ears \n",

CNET Read More \nThe Amazon Echo, Echo Dot, Fire Table and Amazon Fire TV Stick with Alexa Voice Remote were \"not only the best-selling Amazon devices, but they were the best-selling products from any manufacturer in any category across all of Amazon,\" the company boasted in a press release Tuesday. \nBreaking it down, sales of the Echo Dot were up seven times higher over last year's Cyber Monday and Fire Tablet sales doubled. Sales of the Amazon Fire TV were up more than 2.5 times year-over-year on Cyber Monday. \nIn a statement, Dave Limp, SVP of Amazon devices and services, noted that the surge in Amazon device sales means millions of new customers will be tapping into the company's artificially intelligent personal assistant platform Alexa. \n\"Customers purchased millions of Amazon's Alexa-enabled devices this holiday weekend,\" Limp said. \"It's never been easier to have Alexa in any or every room, and we're excited for millions of new customers to discover Alexa this holiday season.\" \nAmazon hasn't released exact sales figures for the holiday weekend but so far this year's Cyber Monday is estimated to have been the biggest online shopping day in history , according to analysis from Adobe . In the US, online spending on Cyber Monday increased 10.2 percent to $3.39 billion, ahead of Black Friday's $3.34 billion. \nREAD MORE ABOUT ONLINE SHOPPING",

      "text": "Photo via Amazon/YouTube Employee emailed CEO Jeff Bezos before jumping from one of the company's buildings. \nOn Monday morning, an Amazon employee attempted suicide by jumping from a building at the company's Seattle headquarters after sending an email to hundreds of co-workers, including Amazon's CEO. \nThe unnamed employee was injured after leaping from a fourth floor rooftop of the 12-story building, but landed on a balcony 20 feet below , Seattle Pi reports. The worker was taken to an area hospital with non-life-threatening injuries. \nThe employee had recently put in a transfer request to a different department, according to Bloomberg. Instead though, the worker was put on an \"employee improvement plan,\" which can result in an employee's dismissal if performance doesn't get better. \nBefore the suicide attempt, the employee sent out an email to numerous co-workers, as well as Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos. In the email, the person reportedly criticized the way the company dealt with the transfer request. The employee also suggested they might hurt themselves, Bloomberg reports. \nSilicon Valley—and the tech industry in general—are notoriously high stakes, high stress work environments. Since 2007, there have been numerous suicides at Foxconn , the Chinese factory where Apple produces its iPhones. At two Palo Alto-area high schools, in the heart of Silicon Valley, the 10-year suicide rate is four to five times above the nation's average. And in recent years, a spat of suicides from entrepreneurs including Austen Heinz and Ilya Zhitomirskiy have called attention to a veritable mental health crisis within the startup industry. \nWhile it's been a long time since Amazon could be considered a startup, it still retains a similar cutthroat, breakneck company pace and attitude (or worse). In a brutal 2015 exposé , the New York Times spoke to numerous current and ex-employees who talked about the company's unreasonably high expectations and toxic company practices. Amazon defended its company culture and refuted the article's claims , but instances such as this suicide attempt do lend credence to Amazon's tough company culture. If you or someone you know is contemplating self harm, please reach out to the national suicide prevention lifeline at 1-800-273-8255 or visit its website .",

      "text": "Amazon\nA lot of investors look at Amazon.com ( NASDAQ:AMZN ) and see a company with unparalleled distribution capabilities or a market-leading cloud computing service. What I see, though, is the place people go to shop online.\nWhile that might sound completely obvious, it's an advantage that's hard for competitors to overcome. In America, 55% of online shoppers begin their product search on Amazon.com, according to a recent survey from BloomReach . I'm willing to bet a large percentage of shoppers end their product search on Amazon as well.\nThat influx of shoppers leads to more product creators and merchants wanting to get their products on the virtual shelves of Amazon so their items show up in shoppers' product searches. That inimitable shopper behavior is at the core of one of Amazon's three pillars: its Fulfilled by Amazon program.\nCan't be beat Amazon is rapidly building out warehouses and distribution centers. Last quarter, it opened 18 new warehouses, and it's already opened five more this quarter. But even at this breakneck pace, it's competing with retailers that already have significant real estate footprints like Wal-Mart ( NYSE:WMT ) and Target ( NYSE:TGT ) . Both have taken steps to utilize their stores' footprints more effectively for fulfilling online orders.\nWhere Target and Wal-Mart can't compete with Amazon is in driving traffic to their websites. Wal-Mart went out and bought Jet.com because it's been able to rack up significant interest in a short amount of time. Target has succumbed to offering loss-leading promotions like free shipping on all items during the holiday season to drive traffic. Meanwhile, Amazon increased its threshold for free shipping, a luxury afforded by its ability to attract shoppers.\nA virtuous cycle With the amount of traffic Amazon attracts, third-party merchants and manufacturers want to get their products on Amazon. Amazon has cultivated a huge marketplace with third-party merchants and presents it all seamlessly to its visitors. Many customers don't even know that about half the items sold on Amazon.com come from third-party merchants and are simply fulfilled by Amazon.\nThe Fulfilled by Amazon (FBA) program is one of the three pillars of Amazon's business, according to its management. (The other two are Amazon Web Services and Prime.) FBA allows merchants to send inventory to Amazon's warehouses, and Amazon takes care of sending individual shipments to customers. In return, it takes a fee. The program has been the main driver of Amazon's warehouse expansion efforts.\nBut as more and more merchants come to Amazon, more and more shoppers are able to find items that fit exactly what they're looking for at the price they want to pay. That, in turn, drives more merchants to the platform, because that's where all the shoppers are going. This virtuous cycle is what allows Amazon to continue growing its sales at a faster pace than Wal-Mart of Target, despite a significantly larger base.\nAbout $0.20 of every $1 Amazon brings in from its North American marketplace comes from FBA merchants, according to estimates from R.W. Baird analysts. That number will continue to grow as more merchants come to the marketplace.\nWhile Wal-Mart and other big-box retailers offer a marketplace for third-party merchants online, none offer the supply of shoppers that Amazon has. Growing an active shopper base is significantly more difficult than building out the infrastructure needed to store and ship all the items those shoppers are purchasing. That makes Amazon's shopper base one of its biggest, most obvious, but oft-overlooked competitive advantages.\nDisclosure: Jeff Bezos is an investor in Business Insider through his personal investment company Bezos Expeditions.\nRead the original article on The Motley Fool .

      "title": "Why Amazon’s History of Diversification should be Acknowledged by all Startups",
      "text": "0 \nStarting life early in the internet’s history, Amazon recognised the potential for online sales back in 1995, when it launched as a humble online bookstore. Over the 21 years since then, the company has grown and diversified and now boasts a vast array of products, services and even electronic devices. As the biggest online retailer, grossing $1bn over Christmas alone, the giants compete with Netflix to provide online entertainment, contemporary device makers such as Apple with its Kindle and Fire, search engines like Google, with Amazon Assistant and even brick and mortar stores. Most recently, Amazon has teamed with Morrison’s supermarket to offer groceries delivered within an hour to Prime customers. \nNoticing gaps in the market, taking risks and continually adapting to consumer needs has relentlessly kept Amazon at the forefront of e-commerce, innovation and customer service with no sign of stopping. As opposed to threatening entrepreneurs and startups , Amazon is set up in a way which encourages them, facilitating the launch of new businesses with Launchpad and offering a foray into online shop ownership with Marketplace. A recent press release from the company announced its UK Marketplace vendors’ sales are up 29% at a time of global economic uncertainty. This comes as it launches the Amazon Academy: a business school for SMBs. Amazon Timeline of diversification \nFrom its humble beginnings, as purely an online bookstore in 1995, Amazon had expanded to offer CDs and DVDs within just 3 years, quickly adding toys, games and electronics, including computer games by 1999. \nRecognising the value in getting smaller companies on board, Amazon launched Marketplace in 2000, offering a safe space for third-party sellers to offer their wares, whilst increasing their own diversity. Specialist vendors who had access to rarer copies of things expanded a mainstream store to now offer niche products. So far, so logical: Amazon has secured its space as a leading and trusted e-commerce site. \nIn 2002, it really started seeking new opportunities and Amazon Web Services was launched. A cloud computing unit, this has continued to shape SMBs, by offering unique pay-as-you-go services. This coincided with Amazon beginning to sell clothing. It now offers department like shopping in various sectors. \n2005 sees the launch of Prime shipping, which has evolved and beaten an entirely new path in online deliveries since. Initially offering guaranteed delivery within two days, there are options for grocery deliveries within the hour now, and all products can be selected for next day delivery using Prime. This adaptation to customer needs is what exemplifies Amazon and SMBs should pay attention to customer requirements. \nRecognising the trend for convenience, space saving and the undeniable decline of print books, 2007 launches the Kindle eReader. This revolutionises reading and sets the company up for future electronic device development. Now offering the Fire TV station for supreme streaming and Fire tablets, this was an innovative and ground-breaking move by Amazon, which continues to provide for consumers now in 2016. \nAmazonBasics range is launched in 2009, which sells blank DVDs, cables and other related equipment with its own label. This demonstrates a response to consumer trends and capitalises on information gathered, whilst offering a convenient place to get everything one needs. \nThe following year in 2010, Amazon Studios is created, and the company begin to make special edition series, in the way Netflix does. This later goes on to make Golden Globe winning show ‘Transparent’ and offer Prime streaming services as watching content online becomes the new norm in consuming media. \nFlex, a delivery service using citizen drivers to deliver is launched in 2015 and this year has seen the Morrison’s partnership and a wealth of business support services launch. But what are the key factors to Amazon’s success? Amazon’s diversification take away \nAmazon’s success is largely due to their incredible customer information, gathered from their ever-improving database. Responsive to consumer needs, it holds many people’s address history, search results, purchase history and integrates with other platforms to provide comprehensive consumer profiling. Added to this, Amazon offers one-click purchasing, which is convenient: the key to an online success. What SMBs can take away from this is the importance of data capture and information gathering. The better you know your client, the easier it is to provide for them. Steps for successful diversification \nKnow your market \nGather as much information on the new niche as you can. This can include employing an expert in that specific division, to ensure your diversified sector gains a competitive advantage over other companies. \nSecure finances \nYou must speculate to accumulate, as the saying goes. However, ensuring that you have the finances to take a risk is key to good business sense. Using information and experience gained from online resources such as Reuters , trading platforms or reading up on financial and currency based news could be very valuable from a purely financial perspective. \nBe prepared to take risks \nDriving innovation is the willingness to take risks. This is often a part of an entrepreneurial mindset. Nothing ventured, nothing gained. \nSupportive culture \nVital to any SMB growth, developing a supportive culture towards development and innovation will open your business up to the many benefits of diversification. \nKPIs \nSetting achievable performance indicators requires strategy. An essential part of monitoring the success of your diversification, you should understand what works and when to admit that it hasn’t. \nEffective incentives to drive divisions forward \nWhether these are financial or emotional, find something for your team to be working toward to make the diversified product or service a success. \nLearn from mistakes \nAs is the case in business, making sure that you learn from mistakes will help lead future diversification. Amazon’s Fire Smartphone didn’t work out, but its tablets remain popular. Rather than being set back by failure, embrace it and see what you can do to improve in future. What are the drawbacks? \nAmazon has built a reputation and has the reputation and finance to take risks and gamble. The Fire Smartphone flop was not big enough to set them back. SMBs wishing to embrace the notion of diversification should do so in a focused way. Whilst traditionally putting all eggs in one basket is not the safest option, neither is spreading them so thinly it becomes a chore to collate them! \nDiversification is a normal way for businesses to adapt to trends in behaviour, gaps in the market and consumer needs, and it should be approached strategically in order to help your company grow, as opposed to simply saturating the market with a monopoly of products. Hone in on what you know you can provide, based on your customer knowledge, expertise in field and budget. TechSling Admin \nThanks for reading this article.

According to multiple sources including Bloomberg, a new premium version of the Echo is likely to include a touchscreen that will show news, weather, calendars and, of course, shopping information.\nThe Echo has been a bit of a surprise hit for Amazon, and competition, most notably from Amazon with their Home device, has quickly sprung up, with more on the way, likely from Apple, Msoft and other tech big hitters. Bloomberg said the new device will be larger than the current Echo and the screen will be optimized for operation while a user is standing. The as-yet unnamed device will likely debut in the next few months at the top of the range.\nJust imagine the lines\nThe interwebs are swimming in iPhone 8 concept images these days, and the rumor mill is fairly choking on possible features: a top-to-bottom OLED display, a possible curved design, new long-range wireless charging, better dual cameras, new faster chips and so on. But what all the hype may really signify is that demand for the iPhone 8 – if it even comes close to living up to all the hype – will be positively gigantic when it finally arrives.\nMing Chi Kuo of KGI Securities, who has a strong record of correct iPhone prognostications, says upstream parts suppliers are already preparing to supply bits for between 120 and 150 million iPhone 8s. That’s a tidal wave of iPhones to be sure, and best of all, the rumors are pushing other phone makers, especially Samsung, to up their game as well. Ten years after the first iPhone redefined what a smartphone could be, it looks like the iPhone 8 could do it again.\nThe politics of bits, bytes and dollars\nAT&T is shaking up the telecom industry with its DirecTV Now streaming service , which offers a lot of TV for just $35 a month and even more if you double up to $70. But the real news here is how DirecTV Now could be the tip of the spear that pierces the net neutrality shield the FCC put in place last year. AT&T says their new service will not count against data caps for existing customers, but if you’re NOT an AT&T data systems customer, it most definitely will.\nThat’s called “zero rating,” and it’s a little-known codicil in the FCC’s net neutrality rules that agency head Tom Wheeler said the agency would look at “case by case.” Problem is, Hillary Clinton lost the election, and President-Elect Trumps new FCC overseers, one of whom will very likely eventually head up the FCC, are positively anti-net neutrality , and those “case-by-case” reviews of zero ratings are likely about to become a very distant memory.\nBottom line: AT&T will be able to favor, or zero-rate, its own service, of course, while possibly throttling and charging non-AT&T data customers for every bit and byte of video they download. The Trump administration sees this as healthy competition. Others see it as a vertical monopoly by AT&T, which, in case you forgot, is about to also swallow up Time-Warner . Yes, it’s complicated, so check out this in-depth article from our friends at The Verge on this important topic.\nWant to wake up with Jeremy Clarkson?

      "text": "amazon blocking fake product sales boxes More Amazon is dropping the hammer on fake goods. Purging the online marketplace of counterfeit goods is a full bore charge for the company heading into 2017, according to Bloomberg .\nNo one but the fraudsters themselves can be happy about sales of counterfeit products on Amazon. Manufacturers, brand owners, and legitimate retailers have been frustrated by fake products. Ripoffs often seem to show up immediately after a hot product launch and sell for much lower prices. Customers may leap for the knockoffs, but often rue the ‘great buys’ when they discover they paid money for low-quality goods. The brand suffers and the manufacturers, legit retailers, customers, and Amazon all suffer as well.\nMore: Amazon is taking big steps to reduce crummy reviews\nAccording to Randy Hendrix, who has sold his TRX Training System on Amazon since 2008, fake copies of his product started appearing on Amazon in 2013. His company reported every instance they found to Amazon but more fake resellers kept showing up. “We realized this was an epidemic,” said Hetrick. Although TRX enjoys annual sales of $50 million, Hetrick estimates the fakes rake in about twice that amount each year, Bloomberg reported.\nNow Amazon is making a major effort to stop the sale of phonies by not letting companies sell them on its platform. U.S. and European Amazon teams are going to reach out to brands owners to register their products with Amazon. The teams will include companies that have never sold on Amazon themselves, in some cases companies that have resisted precisely because of the presence of phonies. Once a product is in the registry, any merchant who lists the product for sale must prove to Amazon that they have a legal right to sell it online.\nDuring 2017 Amazon will focus on large companies and top brand names, hoping to build the registry fast and get the approval process working efficiently. The payoff will be huge for companies that have seen lost sales on Amazon and for companies that have stayed away because of concerns about fake products. Brands will be protected, consumers will get what they pay for, and Amazon, of course, will simultaneously boost its reputation with merchants and increase revenues.\n“Amazon has zero tolerance for the sale of counterfeit items on our site,” Amazon said in a statement.\n“The depressing thing about it is, brands that invest the most to innovate and create new products are the ones that lose the most because they are the ones the counterfeiters target,” said Hetrick, who is pleased with Amazon’s plan, according to Bloomberg. “You end up becoming the sales and marketing arm” for the counterfeiters.\nAmazon appears to be getting serious about ridding its site of fake goods Think you’re buying a real Apple product on Amazon? Think again Amazon is now selling its Fire HD 8 tablet for $90, and it has Alexa",

      "text": "leeco amazon best buy target december le pro More Christian de Looper/Digital Trends\nEarlier this month, LeEco — known as the “Netflix of China” — finally made its latest phones and TVs available in the U.S. — but there was a catch: They were only available via the company’s LeMall website. After a month of flash sales, the company’s products will finally be available on LeMall at any time, but that’s not the biggest news — the company also announced on Tuesday that beginning December 1, its phones and TVs will also be available from a number of U.S. retailers.\n“We continue to bring to life our vision of a connected ecosystem that puts content at the center of the experience. With [Tuesday’s] announcements, we are making our premium products and the best content even more accessible,” Danny Bowman, LeEco North America chief revenue officer, said in a statement. “We’ve had tremendous success with our direct-to-consumer ecommerce site, LeMall.com, but we’re thrilled to be working with the top retailers to make our products more accessible.”\nMore: Le yea! LeEco’s new phones and TVs are finally on sale in the U.S.\nSpecifically, LeEco phones and TVs will be available at Best Buy locations, as well as at wireless dealers for carriers that offer LeEco phones. In addition to physical locations, LeEco products will also be available via online retailers like Amazon and the Best Buy and Target websites.\nThe December 1 launch date comes one day after the launch of the new DirecTV Now live TV streaming service, and that’s not a coincidence. The two companies have teamed up to offer DirecTV Now subscriptions to customers purchasing select LeEco products.\nCustomers buying the Le S3 or Le Pro3 smartphones or Super4 X3 Pro ecotv will receive access to DirecTV Now for three months, while those buying a Super4 X55 or Super4 X65 TV will get six months of service. Customers buying the company’s flagship uMax85 TV will receive a full year of DirecTV Now service for free.\nMore: Hands on with DirecTV Now, AT&T’s new streaming service starting at $35\nWhile LeEco may be making its products more easily available, it is still trying to draw customers to its LeMall online store by offering rebates ranging from $80 to $200, depending on the product.\nWho certified the exploding Samsung Galaxy Note 7 safe? Samsung did Find furniture that suits your style with Houzz’s new visual match tool",

      "text": "November 29, 2016, 4:51 PM Amazon accounts for nearly 40% of holiday weekend web sales in the US By Allison Enright Editor Internet Retailer estimates more than $4.7 billion in sales happened on Amazon from Thanksgiving through Cyber Monday. \nRetail industry insiders this year have been referring to the five-day sales period between Thanksgiving and Cyber Monday as the Turkey Five. But Amazon.com Inc.’s use of the term could mean something else altogether, as Internet Retailer estimates consumers spent nearly $5 billion with the largest e-retailer in the United States over the five-day sales period. \nAmazon hasn’t released sales figures for the holiday weekend, and isn’t likely to, but Internet Retailer conservatively estimates transactions on Amazon accounted for 37% of online sales in the United States measured from Nov. 24-28. Using Adobe Digital Insights’ $12.81 billion online sales estimate for the period, Internet Retailer estimates $4.74 billion took place on Amazon. This includes goods sold by Amazon directly and by merchants selling through Amazon’s marketplace . Marketplace sellers pay Amazon a commission ranging from 8% to 25% (depending on the product category) of the sale price on each item they sell through the site . \nAlready the go-to e-retailer for many—43% of shoppers say they will make more than half of their holiday purchases on Amazon, according to the results of an Astound Commerce study released this week—Amazon and its marketplace sellers’ cadence of deals, selection and discounts drew shoppers and got them talking . Amazon, No.1   , added new deals about every five minutes. \nAnalytics firm Clavis Insight measured the number of featured products offered on leading e-retail sites over the holiday weekend and calculated the average discount. It showed that Amazon had more products on sale than any other retailer and it offered those items at steeper discounts when the clock ticked from Thanksgiving into Friday. \nThe average discount offered on Amazon on Thanksgiving was 32%, and Clavis says 7,486 items were featured. On Friday, the discount jumped to 44% across nearly 10,000 products, a sale selection about five times greater than any other retailer in the study. The other e-retailers Clavis Insight tracked were Wal-Mart Stores Inc., Best Buy Co. Inc. and Target Corp. The average discount and number of products Walmart.com offered at a discount held steady Thursday and Friday, with just less than 2,000 products offered at a 33% discount. Data on product selection and offers indicates Wal-Mart is competing with Amazon more competitively this holiday season. Read the Walmart.com analysis here. \nThe Thursday/Friday average discount for Best Buy was 29%/36%. For Target the Thursday/Friday average discount was 22%/35%. Walmart.com is No. 4 in the Top 500, Best Buy is No. 12 and Target is No. 22. \n“In the game against Amazon, better prices and special discounts are some of the best ways for retailers to drive consumers away from Amazon and toward their site,” says Lauren Freedman, senior vice president of digital strategy and chief merchant at Astound Commerce. Email receipt data from Slice Intelligence says Amazon accounted for 32.5% of web orders in the week leading up to Thanksgiving. \nAmazon’s overall value proposition, however, convinced a greater percentage of customers who are members of Amazon Prime to stay out of stores on Black Friday, the day after Thanksgiving. A survey fielded Saturday by research firm InfoScout among 2,000 members of Prime, the $99 annual membership program that gets consumers access to fast shipping options, streaming video and music and other benefits, found that 41% of Prime members said they did not shop in a store on Friday, up from 35% a year ago. \nAmazon does not say how many Prime members is has, but estimates of its U.S. membership range from 50 million to 65 million . It appears, however, that Amazon is feeling some strain on fulfillment. Some orders placed by Prime members selecting the two-day free shipping option on Cyber Monday for items listed as “in stock” found that Amazon is estimating delivery for Friday, Dec. 2. Amazon did not reply to a request for comment on why. \nThe flurry of deals offered by retailers bled into sentiment consumers expressed on the web during the period. On Nov. 28 (Cyber Monday), Amazon was the retail brand most often associated with the day “by a mile,” according to marketing technology firm Amobee, which tracked consumer engagement and sentiment about the sale day across 60,000 websites, including social media. It says 45% of consumer engagement around Cyber Monday included a mention of Amazon. 36% mentioned Target and 35% mentioned Wal-Mart. \nAs of press time, Amazon had provided few details about its Turkey Five performance other than to say sales on key sales days—namely Friday and Monday—were greater than the comparable days last year, and orders placed on mobile devices exceeded last year’s levels. It says the best-selling product for the weekend is the Amazon Echo Dot, a $49.99 voice-activated digital assistant device, which Amazon sold for $39.99 on the days following Thanksgiving and on Monday. Among the features of Echo Dot is the ability for consumers to voice order products on Amazon.",

Business Insider \nAmazon is working on \"a premium Echo-like speaker\" with a touch-screen display measuring roughly 7 inches, according to a new report from Bloomberg's Mark Gurman . \nThe report says the new Echo speaker will work with Amazon's Alexa digital assistant — much like the current Amazon Echo, Echo Dot, and Tap speakers — but that the new touch screen could be used for quicker access to personal info, such as weather forecasts and calendar appointments. \nIt sounds like a fusion of the Echo and the popular Fire tablets the e-commerce giant sells today. It shouldn't be surprising then to hear that the new device will use an \"optimized version\" of Fire OS, Amazon's operating system for those tablets, according to Bloomberg. \nAmazon released a software update in late October that brought Alexa to newer Fire tablets, though it's not yet clear if interacting with Alexa on this new speaker would work in a similar fashion. \nBloomberg says the device will \"tilt upwards\" — which would theoretically make it easier to touch if it were on, say, a counter or nightstand — and that it will use higher-quality speakers than the current Echo, which is often criticized for its audio quality (relative to other $180 speakers, at least). \nAmazon \nThe report says this new device will cost more than the top-end Echo, though, and that it'll be announced in the first quarter of 2017. \nThe Wall Street Journal reported in May that Amazon was working on a \"tablet-like\" computer featuring Alexa, codenamed \"Knight,\" which would be used to add a visual aspect to Alexa's audio smarts . \nThe Bloomberg report comes just a few weeks after Google released its own Echo competitor, the Google Home . Earlier this year, both The Information and Bloomberg reported that Apple was working on an Echo-esque smart home device as well. The Echo itself has been one of Amazon's few runaway hits in the hardware business. \nAll of this suggests that the digital-assistant race isn't slowing down anytime soon. Though we've found the actual smarts of these artificially intelligent helpers to be lacking , it seems clear that the major players in tech are pinning much of their hopes to them — and the internet of things — for the future. \nAmazon declined a request for comment.

The report, released by the Institute for Local Self Reliance (ILSR) -- a nonprofit that promotes equitable and sustainable local economies -- took a dim view of Amazon's methods of doing business, arguing the company's 46 percent share of the online retail market in the U.S. is not only stifling competition and displacing retail jobs, but also weakening community bonds. \"Amazon represents nothing less than a new wave of economic disruption,\" said Stacy Mitchell, co-director of ILSR and one of the authors of the report, during a press call Tuesday morning. \"We argue that Amazon represents a novel and dangerous threat to competition.\" But Amazon's increasingly vertical integration -- combining businesses like cloud computing, shipping, manufacturing and even generating its own electricity -- is going past just making it hard to compete, the report argues; Amazon has a growing share of control over even accessing the market. Amazon did not respond to a request for comment on the report. The report found that roughly 55 percent of all online shoppers start their searches on Amazon.com instead of Google or another search engine -- that's up from 18 percent in 2009. To get that kind of market control, Amazon has used tactics that include selling products at a loss for long periods of time -- something smaller businesses can't sustain, the authors wrote. Amazon has become something of a gatekeeper for the online retail world, with many smaller companies forced to sell under the A-to-Z smile banner or face dwindling sales numbers, Mitchell and co-author Olivia LaVecchia said. But even more so, the company is fast becoming a gatekeeper on people's lives, they argued in the report. \"Bezos’s idea is to make Alexa the central nervous system of our daily lives, so that Amazon will always be at our beck-and-call, mediating our activities and taking our shopping orders, while our lives, in turn, will always be open to Amazon’s tracking and datagathering,\" they wrote. In it's growth, Amazon has built a huge infrastructure system that includes distribution warehouses, an air cargo fleet and more, and in so doing, hired thousands of workers (aside from the droves of tech workers driving that side of the business). But Mitchell and LaVecchia don't see those jobs as necessarily a boon to the economy. By the end of 2015, Amazon had eliminated 140,000 more retail jobs than it created, LaVecchia said. \"It's also that they're bad jobs,\" she said. \"The work is grueling. Amazon runs its warehouses like machines, and it's built its systems to be dehumanizing.\" The report also noted Amazon's \"experimentation\" with use of independent contractors and subcontractors, including Amazon Flex drivers and others. Those \"gig\" jobs have already raised some eyebrows as some workers have sued, arguing they are working as employees -- not the independent contractors they are classified as -- but not getting the protections that come from employee status. In the ILSR report's view, U.S. policy makers need to step up and recognize Amazon for the monopoly power it truly is. \"There has been a slowness to recognize Amazon as a company that has monopoly power and uses that power to a detriment to society,\" Mitchell said. \nDaniel DeMay covers Seattle culture, business and transportation for seattlepi.com.

      "text": "Amazon Web Services CEO Andy Jassy at the 2015 re:Invent conference. (Amazon File Photo) AWS Organizations Graphic LAS VEGAS — Amazon Web Services made its first product announcement from its re:Invent 2016 conference here this evening, unveiling a new way for companies and other organizations to centrally manage multiple AWS accounts, called AWS Organizations .\nThe service, released tonight in preview , is the latest effort by Amazon to boost the adoption of its cloud platform among large companies and enterprise customers, a market that’s traditionally a stronghold for Microsoft, which makes the rival Azure cloud platform.\nHere’s an Amazon video explaining the service.\nAWS said Organizations makes it easier for IT teams to manage multiple AWS accounts. AWS Organizations can be used to create groups of AWS accounts. Then policies can be applied to these groups to help centrally manage security and automation settings.\nGroupings can be used to organize AWS accounts by application, environment, team, or any other breakdown that makes sense, AWS said. This helps prevent users of individual accounts from having unintended access to AWS services. For example, policies can be set that specify tighter controls than the AWS Identity and Access Management policies for the same account. Users in these accounts will be held to the more restrictive AWS Organizations policy.\nAWS Organizations includes APIs that can be used to automate the creation of new accounts, helping eliminate the need for manual processes and custom account-configuration scripts. With AWS Organizations, accounts can be configured with the correct permissions, based on group membership. For example, administrators can automatically create sandbox accounts for new developers in their organization.\nAWS Organizations can be used to set up a single payment method for multiple AWS accounts through consolidated billing . That service offers a combined view of AWS charges incurred by all accounts and provides a cost report for each individual account in an organization.\nRe:Invent began Monday and continues through Thursday, with livestreamed keynotes by AWS CEO Andy Jassy on Wednesday at 8 a.m. Pacific Time and by AWS CTO Werner Vogels at 8:30 a.m. PT on Thursday.",

      "text": "News \nAmazon first introduced its Alexa voice assistant alongside the Echo speaker around two years ago. Though the Echo line of products has proved to be exceedingly popular, the audio that even the flagship model produces still leaves something to be desired. If you like the idea of Alexa but have been holding off on buying an Echo because of the lackluster sound quality, Amazon has something in the works that may appeal to you - a touchscreen-equipped Alexa device with premium sound. \nAccording to Bloomberg's sources, who are two people at Amazon familiar with the project, the new device will ditch the current Echo and Echo Dot's cylindrical design for a larger one with a touchscreen around seven inches diagonally (think Nexus 7). The touchscreen will apparently tilt upwards for easier use when the user is standing and display content such as news, weather, and appointments. Back in May, The Wall Street Journal reported on a similar touchscreen Alexa-powered device, called \"Knight\" internally, which could be what this new product is. \nPowering the 7-inch screen will be a modified version of Fire OS, the Android-based system that is currently used on the Fire TV, Fire TV Stick, and Fire tablets. Like the Echo and other existing Alexa-equipped devices, the new device will respond to voice commands and questions. In addition, Amazon is testing a feature that allows user to \"pin\" things like photos on the screen, similar to how notes are stuck on refrigerator doors with magnets. \nWhile the Echo is optimized to play better sound at moderate levels of volume, Bloomberg's sources have said that the new device's high-quality speakers will sound great at any volume. One concept that is being considered has the speakers below and behind the adjustable touchscreen. \nThis new Echo gadget could be announced as early as the first quarter of 2017, which is between one and four months away. The Echo, Echo Dot, and Echo Tap won't be interrupted by the device's introduction. Not much about the price was revealed, though it'll almost certainly be more grand than the Echo's MSRP of $179.99.

      "text": "Did you know that you can hire a company to write glowing recommendations about the products your business sells on Amazon.com, regardless of whether they bought them or not? You can. And, unfortunately, more than a few merchants use this deceitful tactic to bolster their products' ratings.\nNot anymore, says Amazon.\nJust in time for the peak holiday buying season, the online giant announced a change in policy that will limit customers to only five reviews a week for \"non-verified\" purchases - in other words, items that Amazon cannot confirm were purchased on its site or those given to customers at a huge discount in exchange for positive feedback.\nAs reported in the Digital Reader, a group of \"prolific reviewers\" received an email from Amazon telling them that they're welcome to leave as many reviews as they want for products that they actually buy on the site, but would now be limited for all others. The policy doesn't apply to books, music and video.\n\"The limit is five and the count is calculated from Sunday at 12:00am UTC through Saturday 11:59pm UTC,\" said spokeswoman Angie Newman via an email to Geekwire. \"We're always innovating on behalf of our customers and shoppers consistently tell us that they value reviews from other shoppers who they know have purchased the product on Amazon.\"\nAmazon says the vast majority of reviews are authentic, but the company admits fake reviews are growing too fast. That's why, according to Geekwire, the company recently filed suit against a bunch of businesses that allegedly sell fake reviews as well as the companies that bought them. In addition to these actions, the company is also now giving more weight and visibility to verified customer reviews with written comments.\n(Amazon.com chief executive Jeffrey P. Bezos owns The Washington Post).",

Jassy reportedly encouraged partners at the re:Invent conference to focus their expertise on the AWS cloud. \n+ MORE AT NETWORK WORLD : How to compare costs between Amazon, Azure and Google clouds + \nThe crux of his argument, as reported by ZDNet , is that customers who focus all of their efforts on becoming experts on the AWS platform will be better able to serve customers. Consultants, he argues, spread themselves thin by attempting to gain expertise across multiple vendors. \nJassy went further: \"The reality is, we are going to direct business to our partners who are committed and who really understand the platform because our customers want partners who understand the details of our platform,\" ZDNet quoted Jassy as saying. It quotes Jassy as saying that vendors who “hedge” themselves by partnering with other vendors are taking the wrong approach. Read the full context of Jassy’s remarks from the article . \nThe comments rubbed some pundits the wrong way. “Last time I checked, VAR's were there to serve their customers, not AWS,” Tweeted Aaron Delp , co-host of the Cloudcast podcast. “Unrealistic stance (again) from Andy (Jassy).” To comment on this article and other Network World content, visit our Facebook page or our Twitter stream .

      "title": "Liquidware Labs Announces Full Support for Amazon WorkSpaces with Leading Workspace Environment Management Suite",
      "text": "Amazon WorkSpaces customers now have access to award-winning assessment, user experience metrics, user environment management and application layering solutions\n(PRWEB) November 29, 2016\nLiquidware Labs, a leading provider of desktop transformation solutions for virtual, physical, and cloud-based desktops, today announced that the company’s Workspace Environment Management suite, known as Liquidware Labs Essentials, now fully supports Amazon WorkSpaces.\nLiquidware Labs has partnered with Amazon WorkSpaces (AWS) to offer Liquidware Labs Essentials, including its Stratusphere solutions, ProfileUnity and FlexApp, to organizations that can benefit from the company’s Workspace Environment Management offerings. The Liquidware Labs products for Amazon Workspaces are available on the AWS Marketplace or by downloading at http://www.liquidwarelabs.com .\nAWS provides a powerful global infrastructure fabric upon which desktops can be rapidly provisioned and sized, based not only on initial design, but more importantly, as the environment grows and changes over time. This ease and flexibility – combined with the enhanced security the AWS cloud offers – makes cloud desktops an increasingly attractive option for many large organizations. Cloud-based desktops can be rapidly provisioned for peak usages times, to establish consistent user experience after mergers or acquisitions or to support remote workers more effectively.\nLiquidware Labs solutions will be highlighted in a presentation to be given at re:Invent that will be co-presented by Nick Frank, Practice Lead at AHEAD, a Liquidware Labs channel partner.\n“Liquidware Labs has been an AHEAD partner for six years in the on-premises VDI space. As our End-User Computing team has expanded its focus into the public cloud space with Amazon WorkSpaces, we needed solutions that can scale and support a hybrid cloud architecture,” says Nick Frank, Practice Lead for Mobility and End User Computing at AHEAD. “We wanted to present a perspective to help our customers understand why you need best-of-breed solutions when moving desktops to the cloud and how to accomplish that successfully.”\nFor more information and to register for this re:Invent session, follow this link.\nENT201 - Deploying Amazon WorkSpaces at Enterprise Scale to Deliver a New Desktop Experience\nAWS Solutions are increasingly an option for many types of organizations looking for a more streamlined approach to scaling their virtual desktops.\n“In September, we integrated the AWS WorkSpaces offering into our learning process. To better understand how our students used the newly introduced platform, we looked to Liquidware Labs to help us. Being able to use both Stratusphere and ProfileUnity allowed us to provide better support to our students and allowed us to maintain our ‘student first’ focus,” said Greg M. Smith, Associate VP, Enterprise Operations, University of Maryland University College.\nLiquidware Labs Essentials adds the following capabilities to Amazon WorkSpaces:\n Assess current physical or virtual desktops for Amazon WorkSpaces readiness with Liquidware Labs Stratusphere FIT. The solution provides joint customers with in depth usage metrics including GPU demand, application usage, storage sizing, and more for decision support when choosing the right Amazon WorkSpaces level.

Leverage robust UEM features that go beyond Microsoft Active Directory and Group Policies. Layer applications for Amazon WorkSpaces environments without modifying base images with Liquidware Labs FlexApp. Application layering enables easy application delivery per user, group, or context aware setting. FlexApp applications co-exist easily with Amazon WorkSpaces Application Manager (WAM) applications. Monitor User Experience and Optimize Amazon WorkSpaces. Identify desktop performance bottlenecks with Liquidware Labs Stratusphere UX. Ensure that Amazon and Internet provider service level agreements are being met. Troubleshoot desktop performance issues including excessive login delays, boot storms, and identify IOPS bottlenecks. Gain decision support of desktop performance when needs change to right-size your Amazon WorkSpaces subscription level.\n“Liquidware Labs is a pioneer in the Workspace Environment Management space in the virtual desktop market and has helped many Citrix and VMware customers achieve success when rolling out both on premises virtual desktops and cloud-based desktops, said Mark Bowker, Senior Analyst, Enterprise Strategies Group. “It is exciting to see them fully embrace and extend their innovative products’ support for Amazon Workspaces. When Liquidware Labs user experience, user environment management and layering solutions are leveraged in Amazon Workspaces environment, customers gain a very mature and comprehensive desktop DaaS offering.”\nIn addition to Amazon WorkSpaces, Liquidware Labs solutions support any Windows desktop including virtual, physical or cloud-based environments. The solutions also support Citrix XenApp and XenDesktop, VMware Horizon running on premises or in any cloud such as Amazon AWS, Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud. Therefore, organizations do not need to choose among platforms – virtual or physical – they can use Liquidware Labs solutions for all of their desktops in their environment.\n“We see a future where on-premises desktops will be consistently paired with cloud-based desktops,” said Tyler Rohrer, who spearheads alliances for Liquidware Labs and manages the Amazon relationship. “When extending our solutions to Amazon WorkSpaces, as well as all desktops in their environment, organizations can enter a new era of simplicity, scalability and control over provisioning and managing their Windows desktops.”\nFor more information on the complementary nature of the Liquidware Labs Workspace Solutions Stack for Amazon WorkSpaces, please visit the Liquidware Labs website at: http://www.liquidwarelabs.com/solutions/solutions-cloud/amazon-workspaces\nAbout Liquidware Labs\nLiquidware Labs provides industry leading platform-agnostic desktop solutions for hybrid Windows desktop environments including Citrix® XenApp/XenDesktop, VMware Horizon View®, and physical Microsoft® Windows PCs.

In the spot, they both buy each other knees pads from Amazon, so that they can both pray without knee pain. \nAl Jazeera tracked down the actual priest and imam from the commercial, and found out that even though they met for the first time on the set of the commercial, they have since become close friends. \nAs the priest explains, “Really big change in the world starts from small changes. And we have made friends and that’s a friendship that will never die.” \nYou can see the full interview below.",

      "text": "last » \nAmazon Web Services (AWS) introduced to its partners on Tuesday several professional competencies designed to boost a cloud channel that's increasingly reliant on targeted market expertise and specialized technological skills. \nDuring the first major keynote of the AWS re:Invent conference in Las Vegas, AWS channel chief Terry Wise told partners that customers are increasingly insisting – often directly in RFPs – —that the solution providers they hire carry more comprehensive professional certifications. \nThat demand has motivated Amazon to make a greater investment in its partners—both by helping them train their engineers faster and giving them advanced tools to automate more functionality, Wise said. \n[Related: RightScale Compares Amazon AWS, Microsoft Azure And Google Cloud Pricing ] \nThe partners who \"spent the last decade working with us to build the cloud computing market\" stand to benefit from a wave of digital transformation, partly driven by a market increasingly characterized by volatility, Wise said, citing interest rates, energy prices, an unpredicted election outcome in the U.S., as well as the U.K.'s vote to leave the European Union. \nIn that chaotic environment, \"the winners are going to be those companies that can be agile and move quickly and innovate quickly,\" Wise said. \nPartners need to have the right foundations in place to enable innovation, and the ingredients are managed services, migration services, DevOps, software solutions, security and storage, Wise told attendees. \nTo that end, AWS has created several new AWS Competencies addressing the Internet-of-Things, public sector and financial services engagements, and the upcoming VMware on AWS hybrid cloud solution. \nAmazon's ecosystem added more than 10,000 partners since the last time it held its annual conference. Partner-driven engagements are growing faster than the overall business, and the largest partners are growing the fastest – Premier Tier partners in the last year increased revenue four times faster than Advanced Tier partners, Wise said. \nManaged services providers grew by more than 130 percent; consulting partners by more than 110 percent. \n\"The vast majority of the Fortune 500 are using one of you in this room, our partners,\" Wise said. There's \"tremendous growth in the enterprise space led by partners.\" Pages",

      "text": "Amazon Set To Wage War On Counterfeits (AMZN, BABA) By Rakesh Sharma | November 29, 2016 — 1:57 PM EST \nAmazon.com Inc. ( AMZN ) will wage a war on counterfeit products in 2017. \nA Bloomberg news report cites anonymous sources within the company as saying that the company is building a brand registry to prevent sales of fake products on its site. Per the proposed system, merchants would have to get permission from brands listed on the registry before selling their products on the site. Amazon ran a pilot of the registry earlier this year with Nike Inc. ( NKE ) and a couple of other companies. \nCurrently Amazon has two million merchants on its site. They hawk everything from cooking utensils to gardening equipment to books and mullet headbands with hair extensions. The report states that complaints against fakes on Amazon have grown correspondingly with growth in the company’s revenues and inventory. In 2014, Johnson & Johnson ( JNJ ) stopped sales of products on Amazon’s site after problems with counterfeiting. Shoe company Birkenstock did the same earlier this year. Even Apple Inc. ( AAPL ) has said that Apple products on Amazon’s e-commerce site are fake and unsafe. (See also: Does Amazon Have A Chinese Counterfeit Problem? ). \nThe profusion of fake products has caused problems for Amazon as it attempts to expand merchandise and operational scope. For example, the Bloomberg report states that the company’s talks with Major League Baseball and the National Football League to sell their merchandise stalled due to the counterfeiting issue. Such developments could be harmful for Amazon’s future business strategy. The company is said to be in a major sports programming push and streaming live games with merchandise could boost the company’s bottom line significantly. \nThe registry is the latest in its efforts to clamp down on fakes. Earlier this month, the Seattle company filed three cases of counterfeit selling against merchants on its site. Earlier this year, the Counterfeit Report stated that the market for counterfeit goods online was $1.7 trillion. Alibaba Group Holding Inc. ( BABA ), eBay Inc. ( EBAY ) and Amazon were the biggest three sites for counterfeit goods, according to the report. (See also: Amazon Sues Counterfeit Sellers ).

      "text": "Echo Dot \nBlack Friday (and Cyber Monday, by extension) is always a huge opportunity for retailers to break records. Amazon did just that and has reportedly sold a huge amount of Echo and Fire devices to customers. \nThat’s great news for short-term Amazon, but also huge in that it creates many more potential customers for Amazon’s storefront and digital services. \nThe Amazon Echo , Echo Dot , Fire Stick, and Fire tablets not only broke records for Amazon’s holiday results, but they were also the top selling devices across any category from any manufacturer. There’s no doubt Amazon sold quite a bit of stuff over this past weekend, so being able to top everything from everyone is something to brag about. \nThe Echo family was up 700% from last year, while all of Amazon’s other devices sold 2 – 3 times as much as last year on Cyber Monday. That’s also pretty indicative of the growing popularity of buying things online instead of in brick and mortar stores. \nSome other interesting stats from Amazon include the jump in Alexa usage on Thanksgiving, including a big surge in recipe questions answered and timers set compared to the week before. There was a pretty big increase in music streamed through Echo devices, as well as holiday movies streamed on Amazon’s video services. That’s also great news for Amazon, because it means people are actually using the devices, not just buying the devices for a one-time use and forgetting about them. Repeat customers are the ones that spend the most money, and Amazon is fighting hard for those customers.

      "title": "North America's grasslands are quickly disappearing into farmland, report says",
      "text": "The Great Plains lost more grassland to agriculture in 2014 than the Brazilian Amazon lost to deforestation, says a recent report from the World Wide Fund for Nature. And it argues that the continued expansion of cropland in the region may be threatening birds, pollinators and even drinking water, while releasing millions of tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere each year.\nThe Great Plains region is a vast expanse of land, mostly covered in grassland and prairie, stretching from northern Texas up through Montana and the Dakotas into Canada. For more than a century, the area has been known chiefly for cattle ranching — but in more recent years, millions of acres have also been converted into farmland for crops like wheat, alfalfa, corn and soybeans.\nWhile deforestation and the expansion of agriculture in places like the Amazon Basin are well-known problems around the world, the decline of grassland and prairie ecosystems may be much less publicized, even in North America, which is home to one of the “last great extents of temperate grassland on the planet,” according to Martha Kauffman, managing director of the WWF’s Northern Great Plains program.\n“To see the losses occurring here is something generally under the radar, something most Americans aren’t aware of,” she said.\nThe new report, based on data from the U.S. and Canadian governments, suggests that more than 53 million acres of land in the Great Plains have been converted to cropland since 2009. From 2014 to 2015 alone, approximately 3.7 million acres were lost. Currently, just over half the Great Plains — about 366 million acres in total — remain intact, the report says.\n“Those areas can really provide vital services to our nation’s people and wildlife,” said Tyler Lark, a doctoral candidate at the University of Wisconsin-Madison’s Center for Sustainability and the Global Environment, who was not involved with the new report. Conversion “has big impacts on water and climate and other ecosystem services.” Lark has previously published research on the expansion of cropland in the United States.\nThe two greatest concerns about grassland conversion in the Great Plains involve reduced water quality and increased greenhouse gas emissions, said Kauffman.\n“When that grassland is plowed up, when the root systems and structures are removed, the water-holding capacity of that landscape goes down significantly,” she said. When that happens, excess water runs off and can introduce extra sediment into the streams and rivers where it ends up, she said.\nLand-use changes and conversion to farmland is also a known contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, releasing carbon dioxide that was previously stored in the soil and grass. Referencing a report from the U.S. Geological Survey on carbon storage in the Great Plains, the WWF report charges this is another consequence of converting the Great Plains to croplands.\nHowever, the USGS report also notes that, overall, the Great Plains region is a carbon sink, meaning it stores more carbon than it emits. That’s not to say the conversion of grasslands isn’t still worrisome from a climate perspective. If emissions from the Great Plains continue to increase, that means that the region may begin to store carbon at lower and lower rates each year.\nThe WWF report also expresses concern about the effect of conversion on natural habitat for pollinators and grassland bird species. In fact, a recent study indicated that corn and soybean cropland has been increasing in some areas of the Great Plains where beekeepers house their honeybee colonies — a potential problem for the keepers, who generally prefer to avoid those types of crops when selecting suitable locations for their apiaries. But it’s unclear whether the expansion of cropland has actually affected the pollination services provided by bees in the area.\nCurrently, the majority of the Great Plains is privately owned. There are certain federal programs aimed at protecting or restoring the natural landscape, according to Jeff Nelson, deputy director of the WWF’s Northern Great Plains Program, and some private conservation organizations have also worked on buying easements or acquiring land in the region. But Kauffman noted these efforts “can’t keep up with the pace of conversion that’s happening.”\nAccording to Nelson, one additional strategy for preserving the grasslands could be to improve the sustainability of livestock ranching — which typically doesn’t lead to plowing or converting the land — so that ranchers can more readily compete for land. But there’s a balance to be struck there, as well. The raising of livestock, and particularly cattle, is well-known for its high levels of greenhouse gas emissions, include methane, which has a shorter life span in the atmosphere than carbon dioxide but is a significantly more potent greenhouse gas.\n“[That’s] one of the things we’re looking at, trying to figure out what the trade-off is,” Nelson said.",
