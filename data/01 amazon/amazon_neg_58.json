It's a killer deal. \nThe Logi Circle can record at 1080p, so resolution is sharp and precise. Live video streaming is also in HD, so your house is viewable wherever you are, and any video can be recorded or downloaded for 24 hours from Logi's secure, private cloud. It's also portable - the camera can be taken off its magnetic stand and taken on-the-go around the house, if you so want. Lastly, a super cool feature is the ability to have the camera create a 60 second video summary of the previous 24 hours, if you need a recap or a catch up on the day's events at your home. \nThe Logi Circle is available in white and black , and both have $70 off.

      "title": "Dropshare 4 for Mac 4.5 破解版 – 强大易用的网络文件共享工具",
      "text": "Dropshare 4 是一款Mac上强大易用的网络 文件共享 工具，使用 Dropshare ，只要你设置好远程服务器的连接信息，Dropshare 支持 SSH 密匙连接、Amazon S3（第三方）、RACKSPACE，并且可从其他安装 Dropshare 的 Mac 上导入 Connection 设置。 \n[Dropshare 4 在Mac App Store上售价人民币128元] Dropshare 4 for Mac 4.5 介绍 \nDropshare is your very own secure file-sharing tool. Dropshare is a menu bar application for drag-and-drop upload files, screenshots and even directories to your own server, Amazon S3 or Rackspace Cloud Files. Sharing files with friends, customers, colleagues or anyone else has never been so professional! Dropshare is a secure alternative to cloud hosted file sharing. Instead of sharing your files via a cloud hosted service with no control and monthly financial commitments, just use your own server: Dropshare natively supports Secure Copy (SCP over SSH), a secure industry standard protocol for file transfers. Additionally - in case you don't have an own server or SSH account at your disposal - Dropshare supports uploads to Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) or Rackspace Cloud Files, which both are low-priced file hosting services in the cloud. Compared to other cloud hosted file sharing services, Dropshare directly connects to your very own Amazon S3 bucket or Rackspace Cloud Files container, so there is no third-party involved at all. Dropshare supports Multiple Connections: You can set up different upload destinations at the same time and switch between them using user-defined keyboard shortcuts! Uploads everything: No matter if files, folders, text or screenshots - Dropshare uploads every file and data to your selected destination - also from clipboard or other applications like Safari. Automatic screenshot upload: Screenshots can be optionally uploaded automatically. Sharing them has never been so easy - just take a screenshot, wait a second for Dropshare to upload it, and there you go! Beautiful individual landing pages: Instead of linking to the uploaded file directly, the app offers to generate a neat landing page for your uploads. Choose from a number of free designs or craft an individual design on your own using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. A preview can be embedded for several file types, e.g., images, text or video files. Choose your URL shortener: Dropshare supports URL shorteners as well - choose from a variety of natively supported URLS (e.g., goo.gl or dsh.re), or configure your very own URL shortener service like bit.ly (for hosted services) or YOURLS (for self-hosted services). 1-Click: Delete from your server Whenever you decide that you no longer want to share a specific file, just use Dropshare to delete it from the upload destination again. Never forget your uploads: A full history of all your uploads is available, and it enables you to either copy the sharing URL to your clipboard again or delete the file. Markdown to HTML: If enabled, Dropshare automatically converts Markdown files to HTML. Services enabled: Dropshare introduces itself to the Mac OS X Services Menu. By doing so, you can perfectly use the tools Mac OS X provides to create e.g. keyboard shortcuts for specific actions. IPv6 ready: Worth to mention, Dropshare works perfectly well in IPv6 environments. To be sure Dropshare is the right tool for you, please read the following technical requirements: Secure Copy (SCP over SSH) to your own server: Dropshare supports SCP over SSH natively. A working SSH user account is required on the server. A password (for keyboard-interactive authentication) or a SSH key pair (for public key authentication) is also required. Please note that both the public and private key needs to be set up. To have the uploaded file displayed in a web browser, a web server needs to be installed and configured on the server. Please refer to the User Guide for more information. v4.5版本新功能 \nVersion 4.5: Dropshare Cloud With this release, we're introducing support for Dropshare Cloud - our new file hosting service for Dropshare on Mac and iOS. Dropshare Cloud is currently in public beta and we'd love you to join! Preview Synchronization Preview images can now be optionally synchronized with Dropshare Sync accross all your devices (including iOS!) Optional Markdown conversion for Notes Markdown can now be disabled for notes, so Dropshare will just upload a plain .txt file instead of .html Note Templates You can now create a landing-page alike template for your Note uploads Bug Fixes and Improvements Improved selection-based Screen Recordings, you'll now be able to see the area being recorded while the recording is running Fixed glitch with URL shortening from Safari Removed UI glitches with tooltips in the Dropshare popover Reworked connection preferences UI Improved first launch experience for new customers Fixed a bug where the screen recording preference window would not disappear if the screen recording area intersects with the window Updated the Dropshare internal database which makes things faster and more stable, especially when searching the upload history Dropshare 4 for Mac 4.5 下载",

      "text": "Stuart 1 Comment \nAmazon’s Cyber Monday deals are kind of… meh right now. It’s nearly 3am, and their Lightning Deal schedule is up. There’s nothing really notable, but maybe something’s of interest to you. \nIt’s not that I don’t think the deals will be good, it’s that most of the brand names are unrecognizable to me. Advertisement \nSorry if the featured post image was misleading, I didn’t know what else to put so I used an older Amazon Cyber Monday image. But to be fair, Amazon has had good sale pricing on drills! \nMaybe when I wake up in a few hours the deals will be better. \nThey do have some random tools on sale, some at great bargains, some at only okay prices. I’ll try to sort these out for you.",

      "text": "Managed Service Provider, Internet Unie, chooses Cloudian HyperStore to run new hybrid cloud solution\n\nLondon, UK and Amsterdam, Netherlands (PRWEB UK) 28 November 2016\n\nCloudian, Inc., a leading provider of hybrid cloud object storage systems, has been selected by Internet Unie, one of the largest Managed Service Providers in the Netherlands, to provide its HyperStore object storage solution for a new hybrid cloud storage service.\n\nInternet Unie specialises in delivering fully managed infrastructure and hosting services to enterprise customers in the Netherlands. It will utilise Cloudian’s storage system to offer a new cloud service for its customers that will enable its customers to employ both Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud storage and a Cloudian storage system located in the Internet Unie data center, and manage both as a single limitlessly scalable storage environment.\n\n“This hybrid service opens up enormous possibilities for those using the AWS service cloud offerings and need to store certain data types in a private cloud, for reasons such as data governance policies. With Cloudian’s new offering on AWS, our customers can point their applications to either cloud storage or on-premises storage, and it’s completely transparent,” said Arvid Cauwels, Sales Director at Internet Unie. “With AWS metering now available for Cloudian storage, customers get one AWS invoice for both their public and private cloud storage usage.”\n\n“Internet Unie understands that the enormous demand for Amazon S3 storage is also driving demand for on-premises cloud-compatible storage,” explained Jacco van Achterberg, Sales Director at Cloudian. “Customers want the best of both worlds and this hybrid offering gives them full control over their storage workloads in both the public and private cloud.”\n\nAbout Cloudian\nBased in Silicon Valley, Cloudian is a leading provider of hybrid cloud object storage systems. Our flagship product, Cloudian HyperStore, enables service providers and enterprises to build reliable, affordable and scalable hybrid cloud storage solutions.

(WDRB/AP) -- The Monday after Thanksgiving is traditionally the busiest online shopping day of the year, but stores are releasing internet deals earlier than ever this year as well as making them available in stores. \nShoppers looking for discounts spurred online sales on Black Friday to a new high. \nAnalysts say as consumers are buying more and more online, how stores run promotions and discounts has changed as well. Tamara Gaffney, principal analyst and director at Adobe Digital Insights, says \"Cyber Monday may not have as much gas left in the tank.\" \nHowever, online retail giant Amazon expects Cyber Monday to break records. \nThe company says it will roll out more than 75,000 sales this week on a number of items. \nOverall, holiday shopping was down over the weekend. The National Retail Federation says, on average, shoppers spent about $290 over the weekend. That's down nearly 3.5% from a year ago. \nCopyright 2016 WDRB News. All Rights Reserved.

      "text": "After previewing 35 full days of mad Black Friday shopping , Amazon kicked off the “Turkey 5” deal bonanza with a sweet discount on a high-end VR bundle , quickly spreading the love to smartphone and wearable enthusiasts , then offering a sneak peek at “more than 75,000” marked-down products during the week of Cyber Monday.\nConfused much? It’s probably best to live in the moment, and don’t hesitate to pull the trigger on an Amazon.com bargain whenever you can get it, not thinking about what might or might not be around the corner.\nEspecially today, when an unlocked modular Moto Z phone , complete with 64GB internal storage and a US warranty, costs $499.99 instead of $699.99. Outside of Verizon-locked and select Moto Mod bundle promotions , this is most definitely the 5.5-incher’s lowest price yet, unlikely to go any lower in the near future.\nThe same pretty much goes for a number of intelligent Garmin and Fitbit wearable devices, including the $45 Vivofit 2 ($25 off), $160 Forerunner 225 (30 percent or so off), $60 Flex 2, $77 Charge HR, $85 Alta, and $128 Blaze. Then there’s the 16GB Moto G4 Plus (non- Prime-exclusive ), available for $200 after a limited-time $50 trim, $179 Asus ZenFone 3 Laser (20 bucks off), and of course, a bunch of lightning deals coming “as often as every five minutes” all week long.\nThe post Amazon’s latest batch of Cyber Monday deals includes cool savings on Moto Z, Garmin and Fitbit wearables appeared first on Pocketnow .\n",

      "text": "News \nLogitech's Harmony remotes are probably the best smart remotes in the business - they're easy to use, quick to set up, and well made. Today the Harmony Smart Control is $60 off on Amazon or Best Buy - 46% off - bringing the price down to $69.99. \nThe Harmony Smart Control means many appliances in your house - cable TV boxes, streaming boxes, televisions, game consoles and a lot more- can be controlled via either the included remote, or your phone provided you download the app from Google Play. This is made possible through the Harmony Hub, which converts RF signals to either Bluetooth or infrared, letting your phone control the anything the Harmony system is compatible with - that's over 270,000 devices. \nThe Harmony Smart Control is available from Amazon now, as well as at Best Buy , so if you're looking at throwing out all the remotes for different things, go grab this one before it's too late.

      "text": "Amazon's CTO Brutally Humiliated This Guy on Twitter (and Reminded Us of the Company's Biggest Problem) It's a matter of perception--on many levels. By Justin Bariso Justin Bariso is an author and the founder of INSIGHT , a consultancy that helps organizations think differently and communicate with impact. In 2015, LinkedIn named him one of their top three management writers of the year. His first book, scheduled for release late 2016 , serves as a practical guide to developing emotional intelligence and making it work for you. CREDIT: Getty Images Advertisement \nAmazon CTO Werner Vogels is widely regarded as one of the top influencers and thought leaders of cloud computing, and was once named the \"Cloud's Most Influential Executive.\" \nLast week, a salesman committed a grave error when he cold emailed Vogels, pitching him a deal on one of Amazon's very own products. It began like this: \n\"Hi Werner, \nIs your company still considering going to the cloud?\" \nAdmittedly, the email is pretty funny--especially considering that Amazon Web Services is one of the largest cloud service providers in the world (with over $10 billion in annual revenue, according to Techcrunch ), and Vogels is considered one of its founding fathers. \nApparently, Vogels thought he'd use this email to teach a lesson to salespeople everywhere, by sharing it with his 166,000 Twitter followers , along with the message: \n\"Dear John, I know your targeting algorithm was cheap and thus not perfect, but I suggest to ask your money back from however [sic] sold it to you!\" \nOh, and one more thing: \nVogels included the full name of the guy who emailed him. \nOuch. \nI've got nothing against making an example out of this huge mistake. (I recently wrote about the need to view all criticism as an opportunity to learn.) But completely humiliating a salesperson in front of thousands of people--a guy who happens to be selling your product--is a sign of other problems. \nOf course, tone and sarcasm can be difficult to interpret in written communication. Giving Vogels the benefit of the doubt, the tweet could be viewed as a friendly attempt at humor. \nBut in cases like this, perception is reality. And reading the responses to Vogels's tweet show that it may take a while for the salesman in question to live down his mistake. \n[Note: Before you call me a hypocrite for naming Vogels, remember that his tweet was public. The salesman's email wasn't.] \nUnfortunately, this just feeds into Amazon's biggest problem: its reputation as a company that lacks emotional intelligence. The company's been under a microscope since a scathing hit piece by The New York Times, which painted the e-commerce giant as having a major empathy problem. ( Employee rebuttals haven't always helped, depending on your perspective.) \nGranted, Vogels has a great point: The automation tool this salesman's using definitely needs some fine-tuning. \nBut why call out the guy who's trying to sell your product--and making your company money? \nAll of this could have been solved with a single, easy action: \nVogels could have blurred out the salesman's last name. He would have made his point, got some laughs, and spared the little guy some embarrassment--instead of throwing him under the bus. \nThe good news: As a company, Amazon has shown evidence of being able to learn from criticism --including from that Times article from last year. \nLet's hope everybody takes a lesson from this one, too.

      "text": "Amazon’s ‘Book of Strange New Things’ Pilot Casts Anil Kapoor More Bollywood legend Anil Kapoor has been cast in the pilot for Amazon’s adaptation of “The Book of Strange New Things.”\nBased on the cult novel by Michel Faber, “Book of Strange New Things” concerns a priest who is sent into space to help form a new colony but instead winds up making some unpleasant, even terrifying discoveries. Kapoor will play Vikram Danesh, leader of the Oasis base visited by the priest.\nTo American audiences, Kapoor is best known for playing the game show host in Danny Boyle’s Oscar-winning “Slumdog Millionaire.” He was also seen on Season 8 of the Fox political thriller “24,” playing the president of a fictional Islamic country. He also costarred with Tom Cruise in “Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol.”\nAlso Read: Danny Boyle, 'Slumdog Millionaire' Team to Produce Getty Kidnapping Series\nIn his native India, Kapoor is a major film star, appearing in more than 150 films throughout a career that has spanned 36 years.\nRealizing the potential of “24” in India, Kapoor bought the rights for a local version. That program became a hit, with Kapoor in the lead role as Jai Singh, based on Kiefer Sutherland’s counter-terrorism agent Jack Bauer.\nFaber was the author of the Victorian-era novel “The Crimson Petal and the White,” made into a BBC miniseries in 2011.\nRelated stories from TheWrap:\nDanny Boyle, 'Slumdog Millionaire' Team to Produce Getty Kidnapping Series\n'Slumdog Millionaire' Duo Signs First-Look Deal With FX Productions\nAmazon's Investments in Film and TV Dragged Down Profitability, CFO Says",

      "text": "SHARES Daniel Acker | Bloomberg | Getty Images An employee tags an item for store pickup, a program where customers select and pay for items online for pickup, at a Wal-Mart location in Chicago. \nIt's time for traditional retailers to prove that one of their biggest advantages over Amazon can, in fact, deliver. \nAfter last year stumbling through the first real test for in-store pickup, the retail service will come under even more pressure this holiday, as more Americans do their shopping online and opt to pick up their orders in store. \nWhether to save on delivery fees or get their items more quickly, some 39 percent of consumers plan to use retailers' in-store pickup services this season, according to the International Council of Shopping Centers. That's up from 32 percent last year. \nWith this uptick comes added pressure for brick-and-mortar retailers, who are trying to grab their share of an expected 11 percent increase in online holiday revenue . That's because the service disappointed roughly half the people who tried it last year, as subpar technology and untrained employees led to failed, canceled or incorrect orders. \nWhile industry experts agree that the learning curve will be less steep this holiday, they remain cautious about how well retailers will be able to handle the stress on their systems — particularly during peak days right before Christmas. \n\"A lot of them will continue to botch it,\" said Rod Sides, who leads Deloitte's Retail & Distribution practice. \nRetailers have already made strides in working out the kinks for their buy online, pick up in store services. Whereas roughly 50 percent of shoppers who tried the service last year reported an issue, that number fell to 40 percent this year, according to a set of surveys by JDA Software. \nStill, that rate of mistakes far exceeds those associated with at-home deliveries, with just 25 percent of shoppers reporting issues when using that option, JDA found. The most frequently cited problem with in-store pickup is store associates who take a long time to locate or cannot find an order, JDA said. But even more troublesome is when the order fails entirely. \nAccording to separate data by StellaService, a firm that measures customer service among a group of major retailers, nearly 20 percent of the orders its representatives placed for in-store pickup last holiday were unsuccessful. That includes roughly 6 percent of orders that were canceled, and 6 percent that were not able to be placed. \nThose metrics have improved heading into this holiday season, with a success rate of 92 percent, according to StellaService. The rate of fulfillment has also improved. After trickling to an average wait time seven hours on Christmas Eve last year, it has since sped up to right around two hours, said Carol Krakowski, insights and analytics manager at StellaService. \n\"This year hopefully we don't see that same slowdown,\" she said. \nRetailers see a big spike in orders placed for in-store pickup starting at the end of November. Last year, volumes for these types of purchases shot 115 percent higher from the end of the month until Christmas Eve, according to Radial. \nTo avoid hiccups during high-demand periods, retailers have invested in technology that helps them stock the proper amount of inventory in stores and in warehouses, and gives them more accurate information regarding its location. That way, they can fill orders more efficiently. \nThey've also added dedicated staff to fulfilling orders placed for in-store pickup, with Wal-Mart dedicating a manager in every store to the service. The world's largest retailer has also repainted these areas a bright orange, so they're easier to locate. \n\"You're seeing more retailers doing it better,\" said Jim Prewitt, a vice president of retail strategy at JDA Software. \"They've made adjustments.\" \nWhen done right, in-store pickup can provide a substantial boost to retailers' sales. Not only does it allow them to grab a larger chunk of online sales later in the season, but it also gives them the opportunity to persuade shoppers to add extra items to their carts once they walk into the store.

      "title": "Newegg’s massive Cyber Monday deal roster is headlined by Honor 8 and LG G5",
      "text": "Not to be outdone by Amazon or Best Buy , e-tailer and discount specialist Newegg literally has thousands of compelling Cyber Monday deals in store now across categories as diverse as PC components, networking, software, gaming, home automation, toys & drones, hardware & tools, and of course, cell phones.\nSome of these “bargains” aren’t exactly special compared to similar offers from aforementioned rivals and other sellers involved in this Cyber Monday madness, and some have been renewed or extended after their pre-Black Friday debut .\nBut you can also find a $350 ZTE Axon 7 , for instance, at Newegg, including a free pair of Monster DJ headphones that’s normally worth an additional $200. Or a Huawei Honor 8 available at an all-time low price of $265 with 32GB internal storage, and $315 in a 64 gig configuration.\nMeanwhile, the $260 HTC One A9 and $200 Axon 7 mini are bizarrely sold alongside complimentary Hamilton coffee makers. If you like free stuff, you’ll love the $400 unlocked LG G5 , bundled with a $25 gift card, spare battery, charging cradle, and CAM Plus “LG Friend.” Maybe even the $250 LG G4 , offered with a gratis leather cover.\nFinally, the $90 ZTE ZMax 2 and $200 Asus ZenFone Zoom will score you no extra coupons, accessories or kitchen appliances, but those super-low tags are enough to make them very smart early Christmas buys.\nThe post Newegg’s massive Cyber Monday deal roster is headlined by Honor 8 and LG G5 appeared first on Pocketnow .\n",

      "text": "Huge numbers of VAT fraudsters are illegally selling goods tax-free to British shoppers on Amazon and eBay this Christmas, despite new government efforts to crack down on this ballooning £1bn VAT evasion crisis.\nA Guardian investigation found a wide variety of popular goods being illegally sold without VAT on Britain’s leading shopping sites. They range from cheap Christmas tree lights, electric toothbrushes and thermal socks to expensive laptops, iPads, music keyboards, violins and pingpong tables.\nIn some cases, VAT fraudsters offer unbeatable prices. Mostly, however, their prices remain in line with law-abiding competitors and the proceeds of evasion disappear overseas, often to China.\nBlack Friday online frenzy as John Lewis sales beat expectations Read more \nGuardian investigations found many tax-evading sellers were trading without displaying VAT numbers on Amazon or eBay. Others were showing made up numbers, or numbers cloned, without authorisation, from unsuspecting legitimate businesses.\nSeveral sellers purported to be operating through UK trading companies, but checks showed these firms had been dissolved, sometimes years earlier. None responded to questions about VAT.\nHMRC estimates the explosion in VAT fraud on Britain’s shopping websites will cost £1bn to £1.5bn in lost VAT revenues this year , with much of it going missing in the current festive period.\nBy the end of “Cyber Monday”. UK shoppers will have spent £6.77bn on the web in a seven-day shopping binge that peaked on Black Friday, according to online retail association IMRG . The number of parcels ordered online will be up 12% on last year, it estimates .\nThe market for many goods is now dominated by overseas sellers. On eBay, for example, 40% of UK sales of Android phones are to firms registered in China. Meanwhile, Chinese-based companies account for more than 60% of sales of Christmas tree fairy lights on eBay.co.uk.\nThere is no suggestion that Amazon or eBay have themselves evaded tax, but critics claim they could make some basic changes – such as requiring sellers to display valid VAT numbers – that would help to stop their websites being used by many overseas companies as a platform for industrial-scale fraud.\nBoth eBay and Amazon insist that it is not their responsibility to police tax compliance among sellers. VAT rules are complex but the tax generally applies to most goods supplied from locations in the UK even if the seller company is incorporated overseas. Shoppers typically see prices that include VAT, charged on most goods at the standard rate of 20%.\nAmazon told the Guardian: “Marketplace sellers are independent businesses responsible for complying with their own VAT obligations.” It added that Amazon does offer tools sellers can use to help with tax compliance, but “we don’t have the authority to review their tax affairs”.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest eBay said it ‘continually reminds’ sellers of their need to comply with the law. Photograph: eBay/PA \neBay said it would pass information from the Guardian’s investigation to HMRC: “If we are informed by HMRC that a seller is not complying with requirements then we will take appropriate action.” A spokesperson said eBay “continually reminds” sellers of their need to comply with the law and had recently warned overseas firms of the UK government’s efforts to deal with VAT fraud.\nAfter the Guardian first highlighted rife VAT evasion on online shopping sites, HMRC launched a series of warehouse raids , seizing £500,000 of goods. Months later, the then chancellor George Osborne gave tax inspectors new powers which he said demonstrated “firm action to protect the UK market from unfair online competition [from overseas VAT evaders]”.\nUnder the new rules, HMRC now has the power to issue Amazon and eBay with warning notices about suspected VAT fraudsters using their sites. If they then fail to take action, Amazon and eBay can be held liable for any VAT that later goes missing. \nIn reality, however, these changes have had little impact and VAT evasion remains widespread. A spokesperson for VATfraud.org , a campaign group set up by UK-based sellers, said: “Despite the new laws, HMRC have shown a woeful lack of action. There are many fraudsters who were reported to HMRC years ago but are still trading, and evading VAT, today.”\nGuardian investigations found Amazon even offering extensive support services at its British warehouses to overseas sellers that were doing little to mask their VAT evasion.\nAs well as advertising these sellers’ goods on Amazon.co.uk, it holds items in Amazon UK warehouses, arranges delivery to addresses across Britain, and deals with complaints and returned goods.\nAmazon warehouse staff even offer gift-wrapping services on behalf of the fraudster sellers.\nThere is no suggestion Amazon or eBay knowingly facilitate specific fraudulent VAT-free sales, but the two US groups are nevertheless well aware that evasion in online shopping is a major problem.\nMeanwhile, the sellers themselves are often based overseas, with little or nothing known about their UK sales activities by HMRC.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Checkout windows for an iPad Air 2 from the Apple Store (left) and an Amazon seller \nOne such seller, a company based in Dubai, offered an iPad Air 2 for sale on Amazon.co.uk.\n\nThe iPad was sold at £456.68, which was a similar price to that on offer at Apple’s own online store. However, the Apple store price included a £78.17 VAT charge while the Dubai-based Amazon seller charged no VAT at all.\nAsked for a VAT receipt, the iPad seller said in an email: “We don’t supply UK VAT receipt, sorry.”\nMany sellers contacted by the Guardian were similarly open about not charging VAT, “Thank you for your letter and sorry to tell you we do not have UK VAT receipt. We are located in China,” said one. “Our VAT is still in the application,” said another.\nA third seller even offered to cut a deal, offering to share part of the proceeds of the VAT fraud. “If you want the VAT receipt, it will be after your purchase a week later. Otherwise, we will offer some discount to you directly,” the seller said in an email. “Looking forward to your reply.”",

      "text": "Managed Service Provider, Internet Unie, chooses Cloudian HyperStore to run new hybrid cloud solution\nLondon, UK and Amsterdam, Netherlands (PRWEB UK) 28 November 2016\nCloudian, Inc., a leading provider of hybrid cloud object storage systems, has been selected by Internet Unie, one of the largest Managed Service Providers in the Netherlands, to provide its HyperStore object storage solution for a new hybrid cloud storage service.\nInternet Unie specialises in delivering fully managed infrastructure and hosting services to enterprise customers in the Netherlands. It will utilise Cloudian’s storage system to offer a new cloud service for its customers that will enable its customers to employ both Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud storage and a Cloudian storage system located in the Internet Unie data center, and manage both as a single limitlessly scalable storage environment.\n“This hybrid service opens up enormous possibilities for those using the AWS service cloud offerings and need to store certain data types in a private cloud, for reasons such as data governance policies. With Cloudian’s new offering on AWS, our customers can point their applications to either cloud storage or on-premises storage, and it’s completely transparent,” said Arvid Cauwels, Sales Director at Internet Unie. “With AWS metering now available for Cloudian storage, customers get one AWS invoice for both their public and private cloud storage usage.”\n“Internet Unie understands that the enormous demand for Amazon S3 storage is also driving demand for on-premises cloud-compatible storage,” explained Jacco van Achterberg, Sales Director at Cloudian. “Customers want the best of both worlds and this hybrid offering gives them full control over their storage workloads in both the public and private cloud.”\nAbout Cloudian\nBased in Silicon Valley, Cloudian is a leading provider of hybrid cloud object storage systems. Our flagship product, Cloudian HyperStore, enables service providers and enterprises to build reliable, affordable and scalable hybrid cloud storage solutions.

      "text": "Photo via Amazon (CC-BY-SA) Your Pinterest kitchen dreams have come true. \nYou've probably eyeballed those super sexy KitchenAid mixers, but always balked at the price. Most people want one, but with prices as high as $549.99, it's a bit much for amateur chefs to justify the spend. \nIf they were 60 percent off, though, it might be doable. How does $219.95 sound instead ? Amazon's got that price for the black, white, and red versions of the 6-quart KitchenAid stand mixer . It's a Cyber Monday special, and we're guessing it's going to go fast . Grab one today while supplies last, and get mixing.",

      "text": "Amazon’s Cyber Monday Deals Include PlayStation VR Software Discounts Lots of PlayStation VR videogame deals available.   Peter Graham \nThe Black Friday deals are now over but that doesn’t mean to say there’s not more discounts available. For today we have Cyber Monday, where online retailers provide even further discounts to tempt eager shoppers. Online retail giant Amazon is well known for its offers at this time of year and today its now providing discounts on several PlayStation VR titles. \nSony Interactive Entertainment’s (SIE) head-mounted display (HMD) has only been on sale for just over a month, and these Amazon deals look to be the first available for owners of the device. \nCurrently on offer (but only for US customers) are: \nStar Trek: Bridge Crew – $50.99 ( $59.99 ) – 15% off (Pre-order) \nWerewolves Within – £25.49 ( $29.99 ) – 15% off (Pre-order) \n\nIt’s likely that most PlayStation VR owners will have picked up titles such as Batman: Arkham VR and RIGS: Mechanized Combat League , as this selection does include some of the most widely promoted videogames for the platform. \nBut with Christmas only a few weeks away expect even more virtual reality (VR) experiences to arrive for the headset, such as the recently announced Pinball FX2 VR by Zen Studios. \nVRFocus will continue its coverage of PlayStation VR reporting back with all the latest announcements.

      "text": "lamb85 varunadas Is there a notification which says whether we are eligible ? I had in the past quite a few years back taken up a Audible offer. Don't want to be stung with £7.99 without the promotional credit. I think it's just as long as you don't have a subscription. I canceled mine about 2 months ago, signed back up and just got my voucher. How long to get voucher? I just did it. Also - £5 for lovefilm trial. Lovefilm Deal You'll receive the £5 only if you signup to Lovefilm after the free trial Customers who sign up for LOVEFiLM during the Promotional Period will be placed on a 30-day free trial (“Free Trial”) and will receive the Credit on December 30, 2016, if they elect to convert their Free Trial to a paid LOVEFiLM subscription. Customers who have entered into a free trial membership for LOVEFiLM in the last 12 months will not be eligible for another free trial. https://www.amazon.co.uk/b?node=11938226031 yes - i had already updated other post and asked for deletion :)",

My friend was expecting something a bit larger compared to the \"leaflet\" she saw in GAME. :| Probably the size of the uncharted 4 one, right? ​I'm not sure how small the uncharted one is. It's the same size as the game case (if I recall it's a cardboard book with the game held in side of it). With my friend being a big fan, she was rather disappointed by how the art book was advertised.",

Then these have popped up similar price and made me wanna take the others back. Until I seen your comment lol.

      "text": "The Insider Picks  team writes about stuff we think you'll like. Business Insider has affiliate partnerships, so we may get a share of the revenue from your purchase. \nSince 2009, Amazon has sold a variety of products through its own brand, called AmazonBasics.  \nTheir generic brand covers everything from tech  to fitness or even dining supplies. The goal is to give you the most bang for your buck, and while their products might not be as flashy as their competitors', they get the job done. \nThey're also significantly cheaper, and if you can get a solid product in a major category for less, it's definitely worth it. \nI've used some AmazonBasics products before, and in some cases, check if they have something before looking at the rest of the market. \nSo I've sorted through the handful of AmazonBasics gadgets you can feel comfortable buying for less. None of them will ever be flashy, but, like an imitative box of cereal, they’ll get the job done. You might save some cash along the way, too. \nBluetooth speakers Amazon \nWhile it hasn’t made our list of the best budget Bluetooth speakers , the AmazonBasics Portable Bluetooth Speaker is a more exciting value than its bland name suggests. It’s no UE Roll in the design department, but it’s not ugly, and while it doesn’t have the fullest sound around, its bright, mostly clean profile is decidedly solid for a $40 speaker. \n\nAlso, it’s $40. That’s very affordable for something this respectable. For only a little more you can get Anker's SoundCore Sport XL, which is the best portable bluetooth speaker we've tested recently. But if budget is your main concern, Amazon's speaker will be just fine. \n\nAmazonBasics Portable Bluetooth Speaker, $35.99 \n\n\nCables Amazon \nIt’s never a bad idea to stock up on spare cables — they have a habit of being misplaced, you see — and much of AmazonBasics’ selection are among the better deals around. \n\nIts sturdy HDMI cables are particularly affordable, as you can grab, among other things, a pair of 10-footers for $6.49 . You shouldn’t pay more than a few bucks for these as a rule — just be sure to check out similar offers from other trustworthy cheap cable sellers like Monoprice to ensure you get the best deal for you at a given time.\n\nIt’s the same idea with microUSB and Lightning cables. We’ve extolled the virtues of having a lengthier charging cable before, and there’s virtually no reason to splurge $20 or $30 on \"name brand\" options from Apple and the like. \n\nThere are differences in speed and durability among cheap cables, but generally speaking, Amazon’s USB 3.0 to microUSB Cable and (MFi-certified) Lightning to USB Cable are reliable. They might not be the fastest or tightest — we like Anker’s selection , too — but they’re backed by great user reviews, and again, they’re super affordable. If you ever see them marked down, they’re worth jumping on. \n\nAmazonBasics HDMI Cable 2-Pack (9.8 Feet), $6.49\nAmazonBasics USB 3.0 to microUSB Cable (6 Feet), $5.99\nAmazonBasics Apple Certified Lightning to USB Cable (6 Feet), $7.99 \n\n\nPortable batteries Amazon \nSeeing your phone’s battery icon flash red when you know you won’t be home for another few hours is a strange kind of anxiety, but one you can avoid entirely by investing in a portable battery. Thankfully, as is the recurring theme here, you don’t need to pay a ton to get a dependable one.\n\nWe’ve previously commended smaller packs from RavPower and larger ones from Anker and Monoprice , but you can toss the AmazonBasics Portable Power Bank right alongside them. Again, we can’t say it’s the absolute fastest around, but any differences won’t be significant to most people, and the whole thing is well-made. It’s about as affordable as our other recommendations, too.\n\nReally it comes down to how you want your battery to look. If you think a flatter, more phone-shaped pack would play nicer with your pockets, by all means, give this a go. We’ve linked to the 16,500mAh model below, which we find to be the best deal of the bunch, but there are other, more compact options.\n\nAmazonBasics Portable Power Bank (16,500mAh), $29.99 \n\n\nSee the rest of the story at Business Insider ",
