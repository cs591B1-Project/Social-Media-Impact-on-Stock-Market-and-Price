      "text": "\nBack in August, Microsoft announced that each Office 365 Group will get a SharePoint team site, a modern home page—with the ability to create additional pages—document libraries, lists and business apps. The integration of groups and SharePoint team sites means that any time a new team site is created, a new group membership will be created as well. You can easily see the members of the site, if the site is listed as public or private within your organization and how it has been classified. In addition, all existing Office 365 groups will be updated with their own team site.\nMicrosoft today announced that they have started roll-out of Office 365 and SharePoint teams sites integration. This week, Microsoft will first update the Start a Site settings in the SharePoint admin center for Office 365 First Release customers. The new settings will be renamed Site Creation, and admins can then decide if they want their users to get the new site creation experience. The user capability to create modern sites connected to Office 365 Groups will then be enabled the following week.\nHow users can create SharePoint Online team sites connected to Office 365 Groups,\nClick the Create site button on the SharePoint home page in Office 365. A two-step creation wizard will fly out from the right. Step one: Enter the title of the team site, select whether the group will be public or private , choose the site classification and then click Next . Step two: Enter the owners and members, click Finish and you’re done. A modern SharePoint Online team site is provisioned and ready for use in seconds.\nRead more about this here .",

      "text": "See full gallery on TechnoBuffalo Recently, we learned that Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare ‘s player base on PC is a touch fragmented . Players who bought the game on the Windows Store can’t play multiplayer with those who bought it on Steam.\nThis was noted and clarified in the game’s official FAQ by Activision.\nWhat gives? While we still don’t officially know the reasoning for splitting the community, one side has placed blame on the other.\nMicrosoft handed Windows Central an official statement on the matter. They said that they “support cross-play between devices and platforms for partners who want to enable it.” I read that as, “if Activision wanted to enable cross-play, we would have turned it on.”\nEven further, Windows Central has this from an anonymous source “familiar with the matter.”\n…the decision to segregate Windows 10 Store and Win32 PC platform players is entirely on Activision. There is nothing about the UWP toolset that prevents cross-play functionality, as seen with CD Projekt RED’s upcoming GWENT card game.\nActivision should ask Microsoft to enable cross-play for Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare If the decision rests with Activision, then they should make it. There’s no reason to segregate and fragment the player base of a franchise that’s largely purchased for multiplayer.\nWe have reports of Windows Store customers winning refunds based on the ludicrously small player count .\nThis was a silly decision, wasn’t it?\n\n\nSource : Windows Central ",

      "title": "Microsoft Adds Kubernetes for Azure Cloud Container Management",
      "text": "Kubernetes joins DC/OS and Docker Swarm, helping Microsoft flesh out its cloud container management service. Following the late-September debut of Kubernetes 1.4 , Microsoft this week announced that its cloud container management offering, Azure Container Service (ACS), now supports the open-source container deployment and orchestration technology. Originating at Google and now a project run by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation at the Linux Foundation, Kubernetes is a container cluster manager that enables organizations to automate the deployment and orchestration of application containers at scale. The software's 1.4 release features several new enhanced security capabilities, including a Transport Layer Security (TLS) bootstrap that improves the movement of encrypted data across a cluster. TLS is commonly used today to secure internet data transfers. Expanding on its existing support for Kubernetes in Azure's cloud infrastructure services portfolio, on Nov. 7 Microsoft announced the preview release of Kubernetes 1.4 on Azure Container Service, the company's cloud-based container management service. Corey Sanders, director of compute at Microsoft Azure, noted in a blog post that Kubernetes 1.4 features Azure disk integration and support for native Azure load-balancing and networking. \"This deeper and native support of Kubernetes will provide you another fully open- source choice for your container orchestration engine on Azure,\" wrote Sanders.Bringing Kubernetes into the fold also gives customers alternatives, allowing them to select the container orchestration technology that best suits their technical requirements. \"Now, customers will have more options to choose their cloud orchestrator with ACS providing support for three fully open-source solutions in DC/OS, Docker Swarm and Kubernetes,\" Sanders added.Support for DC/OS has been bumped up to version number 1.8.4 of the Apache Mesos-based distributed operating system. The release includes built-in Marathon orchestration, along with improved job-scheduling and virtual networking functionality. Further, the DC/OS Universe app marketplace now supports on-click installation of Microsoft's own Operations Management Suite, along with Artifactory, Confluent Platform, DataStax Enterprise and GitLab, Sanders said. In addition, Microsoft open-sourced the Azure Container Service Engine, releasing it as a new project on GitHub. The move is intended to help Microsoft and the community collaborate on establishing best practices for orchestrating containers on the Azure public cloud and the Azure Stack hybrid cloud platform . \"All of our knowledge of running containers in Azure has been captured in that repository, and we look forward to improving and extending it as we move forward with the community,\" Brendan Burns, Kubernetes co-founder and partner architect at Microsoft, said in a separate blog post . \"Going forward, the templates in ACS Engine will be the basis for clusters deployed via the ACS API [application programming interface], and thus community-driven improvements, features and more will have a natural path into the Azure Container Service.\" On Nov. 14, Microsoft will kick off a beta of its new Azure Container Registry. Serving as a private repository, it will allow customers to host Docker-formatted container images for deployment on Azure. Enhancing Azure Container Service's DevOps-enabling appeal, the company will release Visual Studio, Visual Studio Team Services and Visual Studio Code integrations that support the rapid and agile deployment of multi-container Linux applications.",

      "title": "Nov 2016 Patch Tuesday: Microsoft released 14 security updates, 6 rated critical",
      "text": "Comments \nIn addition to releasing 14 security updates on Election Day Patch Tuesday, six of which are rated critical, the Microsoft Security Response Center responded to requests for better access to security update information; Microsoft’s solution was to release a preview of its new Security Update Guide , “a single destination for security vulnerability information.” \nMSRC added , “Instead of publishing bulletins to describe related vulnerabilities, the new portal lets our customers view and search security vulnerability information in a single online database.” \nAfter accepting the terms of service, you can sort, filter out products and “drill down” into “more detailed security update information.” \nWithout further ado, let’s jump into the nitty-gritty. \nRated critical \nMS16-129 is the cumulative patch for Microsoft’s Edge browser; it closes 17 holes including remote code execution flaws via four browser memory corruption vulnerabilities and eight scripting engine memory corruption bugs. The patch also fixes four information disclosure flaws and one spoofing vulnerability. \nBoth the Microsoft browser information disclosure bug and the Microsoft Edge spoofing bug have been publicly disclosed , although Microsoft said the flaws have not been exploited. \nMS16-130 is the fix for a remote code execution vulnerability in Windows as well as two elevation of privilege flaws – one in Task Scheduler and the other in Windows Input Method Editor (IME). \nMS16-131 patches an RCE vulnerability in Microsoft Video Control as it fails to properly handle objects in memory. \nMS16-132 closes holes in Microsoft Graphics Component which could lead to RCE. Microsoft noted that the vulnerability exists when the Windows font library improperly handles specially crafted embedded fonts. There are memory corruption flaws which could lead to RCE in Windows Animation Manager and Windows Media Foundation. Another RCE vulnerability is in Open Type Font, but this is being exploited even though Microsoft said it wasn’t publicly disclosed. \nAdditionally, Microsoft said an information disclosure flaw exists when the Adobe Type Manager Font Driver (ATMFD) “improperly discloses the contents of its memory.” \nMS16-133 is to patch numerous holes in Office, including 10 memory corruption bugs which could lead to RCE, a denial of service flaw and an information disclosure vulnerability. \nMS16-142 is the cumulative update for IE. It resolves four browser memory corruption flaws which could allow RCE and three information disclosure bugs – one of which was publicly disclosed but marked as not being exploited. \nMS16-141 fixes a plethora of RCE holes in Adobe Flash. \nRated important \nAlthough only rated important by Microsoft, MS16-135 patches the zero-day that Google disclosed on Oct. 31; it is being actively exploited and should be a top priority. \nRegarding the Win32k EoP vulnerability CVE-2016-7255, Microsoft said it “implemented new exploit mitigations in the Windows 10 Anniversary Update version of the win32k kernel component. These Windows 10 Anniversary Update mitigations, which were developed based on proactive internal research, stop all observed in-the-wild instances of this exploit.” \nMS16-135 also addresses other issues in Windows kernel-mode drivers; in total, there are three Win32k flaws which could allow elevation of privilege, and two information disclosure flaws – one in Win32k and another in Microsoft browser. \nMS16-134 fixes 10 Windows Common Log File System flaws which could allow elevation of privilege. Microsoft noted the CLFS driver improperly handles objects in memory; a local attack scenario included an attacker exploiting the vulnerabilities “to take complete control over the affected system.” \nMS16-136 addresses 10 holes in Microsoft SQL Server. When listing out specifics, Microsoft mentioned three SQL RDBMS Engine EoP holes; the fix corrects how SQL Server handles pointer casting. There is an XSS EoP vulnerability in SQL Server MDS, one SQL Server Agent EoP bug and an information disclosure vulnerability in Microsoft SQL Analysis Services. \nMS16-137 is a security update for Windows Authentication Methods, specifically to fix a Windows NTLM EoP Vulnerability, a Virtual Secure Mode information disclosure flaw and a Local Security Authority Subsystem Service denial of service hole. \nMS16-138 resolves vulnerabilities in Microsoft Virtual Hard Drive by correcting four VHD Driver EoP flaws which could allow an attacker to access and manipulate files. \nMS16-139 fixes a Windows kernel EoP vulnerability. “The security update addresses the vulnerability by helping to ensure that the Windows Kernel API properly enforces permissions.” \nMS16-140 fixes a security feature bypass flaw which could be exploited “if a physically-present attacker installs an affected boot policy.” \nHappy patching!",

      "text": "by Brandon Hill — Tuesday, November 08, 2016 Microsoft Showcases 5 Real World Surface Dial Applications With Hands-On Experiences Microsoft wowed an incredibly receptive audience last month with its Surface Studio announcement. Surface Studio is a 28-inch touch screen all-in-one powered by Intel Core i5 and Core i7 processors, and features an innovative screen tilting mechanism which is a boon for professional content creators.\nHowever, perhaps one of the most intriguing aspects of Microsoft’s hardware keynote was the reveal of the Surface Dial , which is a hockey puck-esque accessory that can be used in conjunction with the Surface Studio (and other Surface hardware) as an alternative form of input. We were given a brief glimpse of what Surface Dial can do in the intro video for Surface Studio, but Microsoft is now opening the floodgates with five product demonstration videos that focus solely on this $99 input marvel. \nWith the Sketchable app, the Surface Dial can be used to precisely rotate a canvas, making it easier for an artist get the perfect angle when looking to put the finishing touches on a piece. Rotating and clicking with the Surface Dial can also bring up submenus that allow you to change your ink color and brush strokes. \nMoving on, Drawboard is an app that is tailored for architects, and Surface Dial support enables them to work easily with both hands. “The minute you put that device on the screen, something is going to light up,” said Laith Alasa’d, Head of Development for Drawboard. “You have the protractor tool appear right away — it’s your default. The pen tools have already been preselected. As they start drawing, they’re just going to feel it. That’s the kind of experience I want them to have; I don’t really want to tell them what to do. I just want them to play around and discover it as they go and hopefully have that wow effect as well.” \nMicrosoft has also posted videos that show Surface Dial in action with Bluebeam, Mental Canvas, and StaffPad, which you can view below:",

      "title": "Microsoft Patches Zero Day Disclosed by Google",
      "text": "Outlook Web Access Two-Factor Authentication Bypass Exists November 3, 2016 , 3:15 pm \nGoogle’s disclosure on Oct. 31 came 10 days after it privately reported the vulnerability to Microsoft, along with a Flash zero day to Adobe also used in these attacks. \nAdobe patched the Flash vulnerability with an emergency update released on Oct. 26, but Microsoft failed to publicly acknowledge the bug until only after Google publicly disclosed. Google’s internal policy gives vendors seven days to publicly report or patch vulnerabilities being actively exploited. \nGoogle said the vulnerability is a local privilege escalation in the Windows kernel that leads to a sandbox escape. \n“It can be triggered via the win32k.sys system call NtSetWindowLongPtr() for the index GWLP_ID on a window handle with GWL_STYLE set to WS_CHILD,” Google’s Neel Mehta and Billy Leonard said in their disclosure . \nThe attackers chained this bug and the Flash zero day in order to get on targeted computers. The sandbox escape allows the attacker to run code in kernel mode. \n“Microsoft implemented new exploit mitigations in the Windows 10 Anniversary Update version of the win32k kernel component,” Microsoft said in its bulletin, MS16-135 . “These Windows 10 Anniversary Update mitigations, which were developed based on proactive internal research, stop all observed in-the-wild instances of this exploit.” \nMS16-135 also patched two other elevation of privilege vulnerabilities in the Windows kernel (CVE-2016-7215 and CVE-2016-7246), as well as an information disclosure bug in the kernel that opens the door for a kernel ASLR bypass (CVE-2016-7214), and a separate information disclosure bug in the Windows browser.sys kernel-mode driver (CVE-2016-7218). \nSix of the 14 bulletins put out by Microsoft today are rated critical. One, MS16-132 , included another vulnerability under attack in the Windows Graphics Component. Microsoft said a remote code execution Open Type Font vulnerability was patched in the Windows font library. \nThat bulletin patched three other flaws, including an information disclosure flaw in Open Type Font, specifically in the ATMFD component, which leaks enough information to carry out a further compromise. Also addressed was a remote code execution memory corruption vulnerabilities in Windows Animation Manager and Windows Media Foundation. \nMicrosoft also provided cumulative updates for its browsers, Edge and Internet Explorer. The Edge update, MS16-129 , patched 17 vulnerabilities, most of which lead to remote code execution. Two of the flaws, CVE-2016-7209 and CVE-2016-7199, were publicly disclosed, Microsoft said, but not used in in-the-wild attacks. The second disclosed bug was also patched in the Internet Explorer update, MS16-142 , which patched seven CVEs. \nMS16-130 patched three critical Windows bugs, a remote code execution flaw in the way Windows’ image file loading handles malformed image files, along with two elevation of privilege flaws in Windows IME and Windows Task Scheduler. \nAnother remote code execution vulnerability was addressed in MS16-131 in the Microsoft Video Control component. The remaining critical bulletin is the Adobe Flash Player update for IE and Edge; Adobe released an update today for Flash Player patching nine remote code execution flaws in the software. \nThough rated important by Microsoft, an Office bulletin, MS16-133 , also merits attention because it patches a dozen vulnerabilities including 10 that lead to remote code execution. None of the Office bugs are being publicly attacked, Microsoft said. \nMicrosoft also patched SQL Server, addressing a half-dozen elevation of privilege and information disclosure vulnerabilities in MS16-136 . Three of the EoP bugs are in the SQL Server RDBMS engine, along with a cross-site scripting flaw in SQL Server MDS, an information disclosure issue in SQL Analysis Services, and another EoP issue in the SQL Server Engine Server Agent. \n“The top priority for most administrators will be to quickly deploy fixes for browsers, graphics components, and Office. All of these components are affected by one or more code execution vulnerabilities Microsoft has classified as highly exploitable,” said Craig Young, security researcher at Tripwire. “These are of the highest priority due to the fact that the vulnerabilities can potentially be triggered through normal web browsing activities giving an external attacker a way into networks.” \nThe remaining bulletins are also rated important: MS16-134 patches 10 elevation of privilege flaws in the Windows Common Log File System (CLFS) MS16-137 patches three vulnerabilities in Windows NTLM, Virtual Secure Mode and Local Security Authority Subsystem Service MS16-138 patches four elevation of privilege vulnerabilities in the Windows Virtual Hard Disk Driver MS16-139 patches a local Windows kernel elevation of privilege flaw in how the Windows Kernel API enforces permissions MS16-140 patches a security feature bypass in the Windows Secure Boot component; an attacker could disable code integrity checks and allow test-signed executables and drivers to be loaded.",

      "text": "Microsoft announces that its long standing Xbox Preview Program is getting rebranded as the Xbox Insider Program and will eventually be open to all users. User feedback has been an important part in the evolution of the Xbox brand. The company has made sweeping changes over the years to its consoles, and it can be argued that user feedback helped completely change the course of its latest system after the Xbox One was initially revealed. Not only did Microsoft backtrack on many features like the DRM policies, but independent friendly programs like ID@Xbox were also born out of feedback. Now, one of Microsoft’s key user feedback programs, Xbox Preview Program, is now getting a new name and will be available to all Xbox One users.\nThe program now goes by the new name, Xbox Insider Program, and instead of being closed off to most Xbox One fans, Microsoft is opening it up to everyone. Previously, accepted users were able to download and check out new features before they would go live to everyone. The goal of this program was to invite player feedback which could then be used to improve the feature prior to going live.\n\nOver the next few weeks, existing Xbox Preview Program members will find a brand new Preview Dashboard built from the ground up. The Xbox Insider Hub has been personalized for each user with relevant announcements, quests, and Insider content opportunities displayed by the similar UI to the new Xbox One Experience . The program supports multiple users on a single console and each person has their own profile card, which displays all of their contributions to the program.\nFor now, any previously active system updates currently in testing will remain closed to those already participating. At an undisclosed later date, the program will then open to all Xbox One users, though Microsoft has not provided a time frame for when that will happen.\nWhile the program has been in service since the Xbox 360 days, it has become a much larger piece to the Xbox brand this generation. Already preview members have been able to test out and go hands on with massive new features for the Xbox One such as the Game Preview Early Access and the new Xbox One Experience which launched last year. For many though, the biggest feature to go through this program was the addition of the backward compatibility for Xbox 360 games , one that many studios have since jumped on to include older games as pre-order bonuses.\nAre you planning to take advantage of this new preview program? Let us know your thoughts in the comments below.\nMicrosoft’s Insider Program for the Xbox One currently lacks a date of availability.\nSource: Xbox News Wire \n",

      "text": "\nUsually, Microsoft posts information about the security updates they are releasing on the Microsoft Security Bulletin website. Earlier this month, Microsoft released a preview of their new website for security vulnerability information, the Security Updates Guide . This new site lets anyone view and search security vulnerability information in a single online database.\nNew portal features:\nSort and filter security vulnerability and update content, for example, by CVE, KB number, product, or release date. Filter out products that don’t apply to you, and drill down to more detailed security update information for products that do. Leverage a new RESTful API to obtain Microsoft security update information. This eliminates the need for you to employ outdated methods like screen-scraping of security bulletin web pages to assemble working databases of necessary and actionable information. Microsoft today announced that Security update information will be published as bulletins and on the Security Updates Guide until January 2017. But after the January 2017 Update Tuesday release, they will publish update information only on the Security Updates Guide .\n",

      "text": "ZDNet Japan Could and should Microsoft enable Windows 10 Mobile on Intel? Windows 10 Mobile, for now at least, is an operating system for ARM-based devices only. But could -- and should -- it one day also power Intel-based tablets and phones? | Topic: Windows 10 \nRight now, Windows 10 Mobile, Microsoft's version of Windows 10 for small-screen devices, runs only on ARM. \nBut that isn't stopping people from speculating if and when Windows 10 Mobile might run on Intel chips. \nWhen Microsoft was developing the first version of Windows 10, the company's plan was to enable Windows 10 Mobile to run on ARM and Intel, my sources told me repeatedly. Whenever I wrote about Windows 10 in the build-up to RTM of the first version in July 2015, I described Windows 10 Mobile as \"the version of Windows 10 that is expected to work on Windows Phones and smaller Windows tablets running ARM and most likely Intel processors .\" \nBut when Microsoft finally released Windows 10 to the masses, Windows 10 Mobile was an ARM-only operating system. And since that time, this has continued to be the case. More Windows 10 Microsoft Surface Studio: A concept five (or more) years in the making \nWhile some company watchers said they believed Microsoft's long-rumored Surface Phone might be an Intel-based device, I never heard that from my contacts. Whenever I heard from my contacts about a Surface Phone, the device always was described as ARM-based , which makes sense to me, as ARM continues to be a better in terms of power efficiency. Traditional Win32 apps can't run on ARM-based devices, but Remote Desktop software/services does provide a solution (though a complex and often pricey one) \nI went back and looked at notes from a conversation I had with Windows and Devices chief Terry Myerson just prior to the August 2 release this year of Windows 10 'Redstone 1.\" I asked him at that time when and if we'd see Windows 10 Mobile on ARM. (I didn't run his response before today, as it didn't seem material to my post about the Windows 10 Anniversary Update .) \nBut here's what Myerson told me when I asked about Windows 10 Mobile ever running on Intel: \"Today, Windows Mobile is for 7 or 8 inch devices running the ARM chipset. Over time, you will see our goal is to give partners access to all screen sizes and chip sets of choice.\" \nI have no idea how much time \"over time\" implies. I also have no idea whether the Intel-based, Windows 10 \"Dell Stack\" tablet and phone devices described by Evan Blass on VentureBeat will ever materialize. (Blass said Dell and Intel were working together on the concepts since 2014, which means they may have withered when Microsoft's initial plans to have Windows 10 Mobile run on Intel didn't materialize right out of the gate.) \nMyerson's comments do leave the door open, at least hypothetically, for Windows 10 Mobile to possibly run one day on Intel. For now, however, Microsoft engineers seem intent on honing Windows 10 Mobile as Microsoft's Windows on ARM and cellular play , as Myerson told me a couple of weeks ago. Join Discussion",

      "title": "Microsoft’s Cortana may get to know you better to make conversation more natural",
      "text": "Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends \nMicrosoft developed its personal assistant, Cortana, as a method of making its computers and smartphones a little bit more personal. Now, a new patent may have unveiled how the company plans to make the virtual assistant engage in more natural conversation with users. \nIn April, Microsoft filed for a patent with the title Providing Personalized Greetings on a Digital Assistant. The purpose of this technology is seemingly to allow Cortana to deliver more personalized greetings based on user-specific and contextual pieces of information, according to a report from MS Power User . \n“A goal of the personalized greeting system described herein is to mimic a human experience with the user,” reads the application, which was made public on November 3. “Providing the same greeting to the user twice in one day is not typical of how the user would be greeted by a human.” \nMore: Some Windows Insiders report Cortana is getting some secret upgrades \nThe documentation goes on to give an example where Cortana might peek at a user’s personal information in order to give them a happy birthday message on the appropriate date. The patent also describes a mechanism where the assistant would know not to repeat that message a second time, even if the user had transitioned to another Windows 10 device. \nA ranking system would be used to prioritize different greetings based on information related to the user’s interests. News content like the performance of a particular sports team, or a local weather forecast, would also feed into the range of greetings Cortana would have access to. \nIt certainly seems like Cortana is set to receive an upgrade to her conversational skills in the not-too-distant future — but it’s less clear when this functionality will be introduced. It’s possible that it could be part of the Creators Update scheduled for March, but we already know that Microsoft has more than one major Windows 10 update planned for next year, so we might have to wait a little longer.

      "text": "See full gallery on TechnoBuffalo Microsoft has announced a fix to the bug that exposed Windows users to possible attacks. Google controversially exposed the flaw and after ten days revealed it publicly. This didn’t sit well with Microsoft, but Google said hackers were actively exploiting the flaw and users deserved to be aware of the risks.\nThe bug is now fixed so Windows users can breathe a little easier. The attack was reportedly launched by Strontium, a group that has ties with Russia, which used vulnerabilities within Adobe Flash and Windows kernel to carry out the hack into user computers. This allowed hackers to do a number of things, including installing programs and deleting data.\nMicrosoft claims if users were to be attacked, it would automatically enable Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection, therefore the attack would be minimized.\nGoogle exposed the flaw because users were exposed Still, it was dangerous on Microsoft’s part to wait nearly three weeks to patch the bug. They weren’t too happy with Google whistleblowing the bug for everyone, including possible hackers, to know. But it looks like the news spurred Microsoft to expedite the patch.\nIf you haven’t updated your Window’s machine with the latest security patches, you should do that as soon as possible.\n\n\nSource : The Verge ",

Those who are interested in joining the Skype Insider Program can fill out a registration form . Users who join the program are not allowed to disclose anything about the Skype pre-releases before it becomes public. Confidentiality also has to be kept for 5 years after the program ends or when the user leaves the program. \nInsiders get early access to Skype software and services updates and improvements, will be able to give early feedback and can help Microsoft to catch any bugs before public release. Microsoft also hopes participants will submit suggestions for future development. Skype Insiders also get access to a private forum on the Skype Community to connect with developers. \nThe Skype Insider program joins Microsoft’s other Insider programs for Windows , Office and Xbox .

      "text": "by Rob Williams   Microsoft Releases Patch Tuesday Windows Update Fixing 14 Security Flaws Including The 0-Day Found By Google What's that in the air? Could it be the smell of egg nog and pine? Nope, it's Microsoft Patch Tuesday, of course! This month's rollout is rather large and notable for a number of reasons. However, what matters most is that if you're not up-to-date yet, you'll want to take a little trip to the Windows Update section and take care of business.\nSpeaking of business, the advice to update is imperative for those managing user PCs in the enterprise , as this rollout of patches includes a fix for a huge bug Google disclosed one week ago . This bug, called CVE-2016-7255, is a local privilege escalation flaw that is particularly dangerous, as it's been proven to be actively exploited. If you don't want to download all of the new updates in one fell swoop, make sure you snag at least this one. \nWhile it could be argued that this particular bug should have been spotted ages ago, it's great to see that Microsoft wasted no time in squashing it - releasing the fix a mere week later. That's a lot better than 90 days, as we've seen in the past . \nOther fixed bugs include 10 that affect Microsoft Office , three previously disclosed ones for Internet Explorer and Edge , and three other critical vulnerabilities affecting Windows. These include an open type font flaw that could be exploited if someone visits a malicious website, as well as a DLL loading issue with Task Scheduler that could lead someone to take control over a machine. \nIn case we were not clear enough above: update . Some Patch Tuesday rollouts might not seem that important, but this one certainly is.",

      "text": "Gears of War 4 review: A reboot done right \nFollowing a couple of weeks of testing, Microsoft finally rolled out last week the SMS Relay feature to the Skype Preview app on Windows 10 , allowing users of Windows 10 PCs and phones to send and receive text messages from their computers. While making Skype, an all-in-one messaging app on Windows 10 may not please everyone; this move will also allow Microsoft to enable this SMS Relay feature to the much more popular Android operating system in the future, which could help to grow the Skype user base. \nBut while bringing text messages to the Skype app is a step forward for Microsoft’s messaging strategy, Windows 10 users may know that it was already possible to send text messages on a PC by using Cortana voice commands. \nThe feature was first restricted to Windows 10 Mobile users, but Microsoft later enabled it on the Cortana Android app which can also sync notifications between an Android Phone and a Windows 10 PC . However, ZDNet reporter Mary Jo Foley has revealed today that Microsoft had quietly disabled Cortana’s text messaging capabilities last week: \nMicrosoft also quietly disabled the ability to message between Windows 10 PCs and Windows Phones and Android phones without relying on Skype last week. Previously, if Cortana was installed on both devices, that type of communication worked without requiring the SMS Relay feature in Skype Preview. \n“We have temporarily disabled the capability in Cortana on Windows Phone 10 and the Cortana Android companion app that enables you to receive text messages to your PC while we evaluate an experience issue which we are working to resolve. We will bring this capability back into the experience as soon as possible,” a Microsoft spokesperson confirmed. \nFor now, it’s not possible the Skype UWP app, and SMS Relay as a workaround as the service does not support Cortana voice commands on Windows 10 yet. As a Microsoft spokesperson has said, Cortana’s messaging feature should come back pretty soon, and we will tell you more about it as soon as we learn anything new. In this story stream: ",

      "text": "The Laws of Vulnerabilities Search for: Patch Tuesday: Microsoft Patches Actively Exploited Kernel and OpenType Font, Three Previously Disclosed Browser Issues and SQL Server Posted by amolsarwate in The Laws of Vulnerabilities on November 8, 2016 11:20 AM \nToday Microsoft released 14 security bulletins with six critical and eight important security fixes. It patched 0-day vulnerability CVE-2016-7255 in the MS16-135 which was actively attacked and disclosed by Google in their disclosure blog a few days ago. Since it is publicly disclosed and actively exploited it should be the top priority for organizations. An OpenType font vulnerability CVE-2016-7256 was also included by Microsoft in MS16-132 as being actively exploited. This vulnerability allows attackers to take complete control if the victim views a specially crafted webpage and therefore should be considered equally critical. Last but not least, three more vulnerabilities that were disclosed before availability of patches were fixed. These three issues are in IE and Edge browser and were fixed in MS16-142 and MS16-129 respectively (CVE-2016-7227 for IE, CVE-2016-7199 and CVE-2016-7209 for Edge). There is no indication yet that these three previously disclosed issues are being actively exploited. \nMicrosoft office bulletin MS16-133 contains fixes for 10 vulnerabilities that could allow attackers to take complete control of the system. In addition to these 10 fixes there is an information disclosure as well as a denial-of-service i.e crash which was fixed. Since office documents are prevalent in typical corporate environment I think this bulletin should be treated as critical even if it is rated as ‘Important’. \nNext, there are three critical bulletins affecting Windows – MS16-130 , MS16-131 and MS16-132 . MS16-130 fixes issues in windows Task Scheduler, a DLL loading issue in Input Method Editor (IME) and image file rendering. The image file rendering is the most critical issue which can allow attackers to take complete control of the machine. MS16-131 fixes an issue in the Video control which again allows attackers to gain control if a user is convinced to open either a specially crafted file or application from either a webpage or an email message. MS16-132 fixes an open type font vulnerability which can be exploited if a user visits a malicious webpage or opens a malformed document. \nMicrosoft SQL Server administrators should focus on MS16-136 which patches six vulnerabilities in the RDBMS engine, MDS API, SQL Analysis Services and the SQL Server Agent. SQL Server vulnerabilities are relatively rare and although there is no remote code execution, attackers can gain elevated privileges which could allow them to view, change, or delete data and create new accounts. \nOverall, the actively attacked kernel and open type font vulnerability, three other previously disclosed browser issues and the SQL Server patch makes this month stand out.

      "text": "The latest updates help users get to the data they seek faster and keep better tabs on their most important business statistics. Microsoft has updated its Power BI mobile apps, offering users new and faster ways of accessing their business analytics on the go. On all mobile platforms (Android, iOS and Windows), the apps now use the Favorites page as the default landing page, helping users quickly reach their most used dashboards and visualizations. Users who haven't selected a favorite will see the My Workspace page instead. Power BI's navigation sports an updated look and feel that helps users get around the app in a simpler, more intuitive manner, according to Romi Koifman, a Microsoft Power BI program manager. As part of the changes, the app's group selection features have been tucked under the Workspaces category. The app's alert notifications are more descriptive, she added. Now when a metric crosses a predefined threshold—Power BI allows users to configure alerts based on a variety of factors—the app will show more information on why an alert was triggered.On Android, those alerts will be easier to dismiss. Users can dismiss a notification with a simple swipe gesture.The Windows Phone version of the app gains the geo-filtering capabilities that are already present in its Apple iOS counterpart. The new feature allows users to filter geographical data based on their current location with a single tap. Geo-filtering can be used to explore data pertaining to a user's country, state or city. While decidedly less mobile than an iPhone, Android handset or Windows Phone, Power BI now supports the SandDance visualization in presentation mode on the Surface Hub , Microsoft's all-in-one teleconferencing, collaboration and whiteboard hardware product for meeting rooms. Hailing from Microsoft Research, SandDance generates eye-catching animations as users explore their Power BI data, boosting the platform's storytelling potential. Instead of abrupt transitions between charts and graphs, the technology shows data points twisting and twirling—like grains of sand caught in the wind—before settling into position, visually reinforcing the notion that the insights generated by the software relate to each other in some manner. Surface Hub customers can now use SandDance to help tell the story behind their business metrics. \"As part of providing presentation mode functionality in Surface Hub, we took another step in making this a great visual for presentations by providing a more clear way to move between the different perspectives,\" wrote Koifman in a blog post . \"With this update, you can set a persistent, predefined set of states in SandDance, and move between them using simple back and forth and play buttons.\" Last week, Microsoft announced the availability of custom visuals based on R, the statistical programming language that is popular among data scientists. \"With the October 2016 release of Power BI Desktop, and in the Power BI service, you can use R-powered custom visuals without any knowledge of R, and without any R scripting,\" said Microsoft Senior Program Manager Sharon Laivand, in a statement. \"This enables you to harness the analytic and visual power of R visuals, and R scripts, without learning R or doing any programming yourself.\"",

      "text": "News \nSkype, for all its flaws, is one of the most popular VoIP and video chat services in the world. You can help to make it a little better by joining Microsoft's new Skype Insiders Program. It's basically a beta program, but they don't call it that. There's also a separate standalone app that you can install alongside the regular one. \nYou have to register your Skype username in order to get (official) access to the beta app. Miscrosoft says that those in the Skype Insiders Program will be able to test out new features first, give feedback, and submit suggestions for new features. This app is not currently available in the Play Store at all, and maybe it never will be. \nThe first version of the beta app is v7.19 while the mainline app is v7.22. It's not clear if there are any noticeable changes in this first build. The only official way to get it is to go through Microsoft.",

      "text": "Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends \nMicrosoft wants to make your daily routine a little easier. The company bought to-do list app developer Wunderlist in 2015, and is now developing a new app — code-named Project Cheshire . That app is now in the private beta-testing phase, and while not too much is known about it, we now have screenshots showing it in use. \nThe app will reportedly be available for Android, iOS, and Windows 10, and the screenshots were shown off by blog Thurrott.com. While the app’s existence was known before this, we now know a little more about what it looks like. \nMore: Sunrise features come to Outlook with Evernote, Facebook, and Wunderlist integration \nThe images show a pretty basic user interface, which lets users create lists, set reminders for those lists, and sync the lists to different platforms. Based on the images, it doesn’t seem as though the app offers more than an app like Google Keep. \nThe app is also listed on the Microsoft Store under “Project Cheshire,” along with a description about what the app has to offer. \n“Say hello to Project Cheshire. Introducing a brand new and simple, yet incredibly focused, to-do app that helps you get stuff done,” says the listing. “Please note that we are still in the early stages of development and are working hard in the background to deliver you the best to-do app ever. Stay tuned for updates and more here.” \nAccording to a report from TechCrunch , while the app is listed on the Microsoft Store, those who downloaded it were simply greeted with a black screen with the words “Coming soon,” so it seems as though the listing is a little premature. It also seems as though only corporate account holders can access the app, which could signal that it is more focused on the business market than the consumer market.",

      "text": "To accompany the N7 Day reveal of Mass Effect: Andromeda, Microsoft has announced that the entire Mass Effect trilogy is now backwards compatible and can be played on Xbox One. Shepherd's second and third outings now accompany the original game on Mircosoft's current gen platform. Mass Effect 3 was released in 2012, over a year before the Xbox One made it onto shelves. Commander Shepard to The Vault, please.#MassEffect 1 [M], 2 [M], and 3 [M] are now on @EAAccess: https://t.co/eGxsLIlv3b pic.twitter.com/jFMEb4YWU3 — Xbox (@Xbox) November 7, 2016 EA has previously announced that it has no interest in creating remasters of the original games, as is the current trend among some publishers. Instead, it wants BioWare to focus on creating the best ME game it possibly can with Andromeda. It looks like backwards compatibility is as near as players will get to a re-release. In theory, there's nothing to stop BioWare from adding features like 4K support to the original games, but it doesn't sound like this is a likely prospect. The Backwards Compatibility scheme has proven one of Microsoft's better ideas of the past few years, and is all in service of creating an ecosystem which, like the PC, doesn't abandon older games when console generations advance. Customers are able to vote on the games they would most like see entered into the scheme, and Mass Effect 3 is currently number six on the list. Congrats everyone, your wish was granted. Just in case you missed it yesterday, here is the N7 Day trailer for Andromeda, which boasts some hefty beasts and exceedingly warbly bass sounds.",

      "text": "Cloud How Microsoft is differentiating Azure as the 'business cloud' for the enterprise At the 2016 Structure Conference, Microsoft's Scott Guthrie explained the three promises of Azure, and how business users are driving their cloud revenue. By Conner Forrest | November 8, 2016, 12:38 PM PST Google Plus Image: iStockphoto/cherezoff \nOn Tuesday, at the 2016 Structure Conference in San Francisco, Microsoft's executive vice president of its cloud and enterprise group, Scott Guthrie, explained how Microsoft Azure is differentiating itself in the cloud market and competing with Amazon and Google. \nGuthrie started his presentation by explaining the three core promises of Microsoft Azure. First, Microsoft wants to deliver cloud in a global fashion, currently running in 38 regions. Guthrie said that is more than AWS and Google Cloud Platform combined. \nSecondly, Microsoft wants to set Azure apart as a trusted option with strong security and more compliance options than other vendors. Finally, Guthrie said, Azure is differentiated through its hybrid approach, hoping to capture companies who have legacy apps that don't translate well to the cloud. \nSEE: Cloud computing policy template (Tech Pro Research) \nWhen asked if every major independent software vendor (ISV) will rely on public cloud to some degree in the future, he said: \"I think every company and organization going forward is going to take advantage of public cloud in some form.\" \nIn terms of the competitive cloud landscape, Guthrie said that Azure's sweet spot is in operating as the \"business cloud.\" Almost half of their revenue for Azure came from software vendors and ISVs who are targeting businesses, Guthrie said. Must-Read Cloud Tech Pro Research: Cloud computing policy \nAnother trend that Azure is looking to capitalize on for enterprise customers is containers. Through its Azure Container Service Engine, it allows users to spin up an environment where they can deploy containerized applications. The engine, which was recently open sourced , also allows the use of any container framework. \n\"[Containers] are a trend that are absolutely going to be accelerating going forward,\" Guthrie said. \nOne of the main concerns from potential customers is that Azure only works well for Windows shops. Guthrie said that this isn't the case, as Microsoft sees more Linux virtual machines (VMs) being spun up in Azure than Windows Server VMs. \nIn the future, Guthrie said, Microsoft is focusing more on the integration of hardware and software, including heavy investment in field-programmable gate array (FPGA) products. For those unfamiliar, FPGA is basically programmable hardware on a server node, Guthrie said. \nMicrosoft began using FPGA to offload AI work internally, and it saw tremendous speed gains. They're also using it in servers to accelerate their network and encryption. Now, Guthrie said, Microsoft wants to expose that capability to more customers. The 3 big takeaways for TechRepublic readers Microsoft believes its Azure cloud platform is the \"business cloud\" in the market for enterprise customers. Azure is competing with new innovations in technologies like containers and FPGA. Microsoft sees more Linux VMs in Azure than Windows Server VMs, which could be evidence that it isn't just for Windows shops.

      "title": "Microsoft just patched the critical Windows vulnerability revealed by Google last week - The Verge",
      "text": "share As promised, Microsoft today patched Windows to resolve a critical system vulnerability that Google’s security team publicized last Monday. The search giant controversially chose to acknowledge the bug before Microsoft had fixed it, claiming that hackers were already actively targeting it. As noted by ZDNet , the fix is contained in today’s release of monthly security patches. According to Microsoft’s security bulletin , any attacker who tricked a user into running a “specially-crafted application” could successfully exploit the vulnerability and gain the ability to “install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.” Microsoft believes that Strontium, a Russia-linked group, is responsible for launching “low-volume spear phishing attacks” that took advantage of the flaw, which leveraged vulnerabilities in Adobe Flash and the Windows kernel. Even before today’s monthly patch release, Microsoft said the attack could be detected by enabling Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection. (And people using Microsoft Edge as of the Windows 10 Anniversary Update were apparently protected.) Still, Windows VP Terry Myerson voiced displeasure with Google’s quick public callout of the problem. “Google’s decision to disclose these vulnerabilities before patches are broadly available and tested is disappointing, and puts customers at increased risk,” he wrote in a blog post last week. To be certain you’re in the clear, ensure that your Windows PC is updated with all of Microsoft’s latest security patches as of today. More From The Verge",

The update applies to all versions of Windows, from Vista through Windows 10. \nThis security update resolves vulnerabilities in Microsoft Windows. The most severe of the vulnerabilities could allow elevation of privilege if an attacker logs on to an affected system and runs a specially crafted application that could exploit the vulnerabilities and take control of an affected system.",

      "text": "\nMicrosoft has a vision of natural computing which involves Pen and Touch, and all of their Surface line of PCs feature both technologies.\nThey in fact favour active pens for improved accuracy and features such as buttons and hover detection. Unfortunately this means the pens need power, with the devices currently being powered by a tiny AAAA battery which lasts about a year. \nMicrosoft also notes that storing a pen can be an inconvenience, with internal storage meaning increased complexity for a device, and with tethers and lanyards resulting in a device which can easily be caught on another.\nMicrosoft’s solution for the later has always been the Surface Loop, a fabric tube which attaches to the Surface keyboard.\nNow in a new patent titled “ Inductive Peripheral Retention Device ” they propose a solution for both the former and the latter, proposing a USB-powered Surface Pen Loop which would attach to an errant USB port and which, via wires wrapped around inside the included loop, would charge an active pen via electrical induction, and which would provide a full charge in between half an hour to an hour.\nMicrosoft writes:\nInductive peripheral retention device techniques are described. In one or more implementations, an apparatus includes a plug configured to removably engage a communication port of a device to form a communicative coupling with the device. The plug is securable to and removable from the device using one or more hands of a user. The apparatus also includes a peripheral securing portion connected to the plug and configured to removably engage a peripheral device via an inductive element formed as a flexible loop and configured to form a communicative coupling between the peripheral device and the device.\nIn one or more implementations, inductance is detected of a flexible element configured to transfer power to a peripheral device via inductance. Responsive to a determination that the detected inductance is above a threshold, a first power mode is utilized in which a first amount of power is provided to the flexible element. Responsive to a determination that the detected inductance is below a threshold, a second power mode is utilized in which a second amount of power is provided to the flexible element that is less than the first amount of power.\nIn one or more implementations, an apparatus includes a single ferrous element formed as a single integral piece having a middle portion having a diameter about an axis that is less than a diameter of opposing ends of the single ferrous element along the axis and a coil wrapped around the middle portion such that the coil and the single ferrous element form an inductive coil that is substantially rotationally invariant around the axis when charging\nIt is of course not known if Microsoft plans to manufacture this interesting peripheral, but due to its non-integrated nature Microsoft could of course still manufacture it as a premium add-on for those who are happy to pay for something a little special.\nThe full patent can be read here .\nWhat do our readers think of this interesting idea?",

      "text": "Microsoft patches Google-outed Windows security hole Attackers are using the exploit, so you'll want to update quickly. Save Reuters/Robert Galbraith \nAs promised , Microsoft has issued a fix for the Windows security flaw that Google disclosed before a patch was ready . The update tackles vulnerabilities in numerous versions of Windows (from Vista through Windows 10) that would let an attacker get control of your system through a malicious app. You're already safe if you use Windows 10 Anniversary Update and an up-to-date browser, we'd add -- this is for people who can't or won't move to a newer operating system. \nYou have a strong incentive to upgrade quickly if you're affected. The attack is known to have been used by hacking group Strontium for a low-intensity but targeted phishing campaign. It's not certain that other organizations used the hole, but you likely don't want to find out about new attacks first-hand. \nThe patch ends a brief but tumultuous episode between Google and Microsoft. Google published details of the flaw after learning that it was already being used for real-world attacks, but Microsoft criticized the move as irresponsible. It put users at \"potential risk\" by making it easier for malware writers, the Windows creator said. Whether or not that's true, the question is whether or not the two sides are taking steps to minimize these issues in the future -- ideally, any security disclosure comes with a patch ready and waiting.",

If the existing options don’t quite do it for you, however, you can now set up a site for your team that can serve as a hub to work within. To help potential users get used to creating their own team sites through SharePoint, Microsoft has added a post to the Office blog that explains a bit about how it’s done. \nIf you’ve ever needed to organize a team for any reason, whether it be for a school assignment or a team project at work, Microsoft seems convinced that this is going to be the tool for you. All you need to do is fill in some information, and you’ll be ready to start collaborating online through SharePoint. \nThis functionality has now completely rolled out to every Office 365 First Release customer, so if you’re one of them, you should give this a shot. Microsoft’s full blog post pretty effectively holds your hand through the process. In this story stream:",

      "text": "Microsoft introduced Skype users to the mystical world of Doctor Stephen Strange, the newest Marvel Super Hero. The chatbot was created with PullString's artificial intelligence (AI) technology. Add the character as a contact on Skype and chat with it to play games or accomplish daily tasks. The chatbot searches for answers based on the query asked.\n\nBrands also have used PullString's technology to build bots for Facebook Messenger. Before Activation released \"Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare,\" the agency AKQA in partnership with PullString created a chatbot to introduce a new character, Lieutenant Reyes, for use on Facebook Messenger. It gave players a chance to meet the new character before Activation released the game.\nThe PullString platform, announced into general availability in September, allows advertisers to create an account and log in to build a chat bot.\nAdvertisers have yet to build an open search platform through a PullString chatbot where someone can ask a question and the chatbot would reach out to the Internet for answers, but Oren Jacob, CEO and co-founder, said there are several companies building a customer service chatbot scheduled for release in a few weeks that will reach into a pre-populated database to respond to some questions and queries such as phone numbers and addresses.\nI have high hopes for chatbots in the future. I see them as being a little scary and spooky, but fascinating. The next step, in my opinion, would be to pull in information across the company's Web site such as product availability or a phone number and then through the Web. Jacob said that in several months the focus on chatbots for some companies will turn toward ecommerce where it will be applied to the flow of purchasing such as collecting a bunch of products, putting them in a shopping cart to check out, and authenticating the purchase.  \n\"We see companies building their own Web sites rather than generically trolling eBay or Amazon,\" Jacob said. \"I have not seen anyone try to scrape Google for ecommerce. That seems ambitious to me.\"\nFrom PullString the chatbot needs the ability to reach out through an API into the Internet for answers. For instance, the chatbot script would query an API to get the correct weather forecast for a specific location. PullString does not scrape Wikipedia, for example, and answer a question with a paragraph on any topic.\nTo determine success, Jacob says companies measure several key performance indicators, not just one, such as retention and whether the bot allows the user to achieve specific goals.\nAt the MediaPost Search Insider Summit next month we will debate the future of artificial intelligence, chatbots and how they will change search.",

      "text": "Microsoft: Furthering our commitment to security updates Microsoft is committed to delivering comprehensive security updates to our customers. Information about the security updates we release are currently made available on the Microsoft Security Bulletin website. However, our customers have asked for better access to update information, as well as easier ways to customize their view to serve a diverse set of needs. This month we released a preview of our new single destination for security vulnerability information, the Security Updates Guide . Instead of publishing bulletins to describe related vulnerabilities, the new portal lets our customers view and search security vulnerability information in a single online database. Using the new portal you can: Sort and filter security vulnerability and update content, for example, by CVE, KB number, product, or release date. Filter out products that dont apply to you, and drill down to more detailed security update information for products that do. Leverage a new RESTful API to obtain Microsoft security update information. This eliminates the need for you to employ outdated methods like screen-scraping of security bulletin web pages to assemble working databases of necessary and actionable information. Security update information will be published as bulletins and on the Security Updates Guide until January 2017. After the January 2017 Update Tuesday release, we will only publish update information to the Security Updates Guide . You can send feedback on the new portal to .",

      "title": "Vanguard Software Releases IBP Connector for Dynamics AX and 365",
      "text": "Vanguard Software has outfitted its IBP platform for seamless, two-way integration with Microsoft Dynamics® AX and Dynamics 365 for Operations, the company announced today. Vanguard’s new connector and integration toolset brings it’s best-of-breed forecasting and planning applications to AX users in days, versus weeks or months for other enterprise-scale planning platforms. The integration is ideal for organizations in various industries that use or plan to use Dynamics AX or its latest evolution, Dynamics 365 for Operations.\nVanguard IBP applications help organizations optimize production scheduling, inventory management, logistics, and financial planning. They are also fully integrated to drive the entire S&OP or IBP process.\n“Unlike most other planning suites, the Vanguard IBP platform delivers easy, automated, two-way integration with AX in a manner that strictly follows Microsoft certification guidelines,” said Jamie Loeks, Senior DAX Specialist in Supply Chain for Argo Turboserve Corporation (ATC) , a Supply Chain Management (SCM) services company focused on Nuclear, Aerospace, Industrial Supply Chain, and Distribution & Services Industries. “Vanguard’s integration technology automatically updates forecasts, min-max inventory levels and other key data across the two systems. As a result, these data are always current in AX,” said Loeks.\nFast, Dynamic Integration for Fast, Dynamic ROI\n“We understand the scale and complexity of the ERP investment, and the difficulty that organizations have showing a positive net return on the process,” said Neal Goffman, VP of Sales and Marketing for Vanguard Software. “That’s why we’ve geared our solution to drive value from ERP — and in short order.”\nGoffman said Vanguard IBP applications can be integrated in days, which means improved forecast accuracy and optimization can start driving returns immediately. That’s in the form of lower safety stock, higher fulfillment rates, faster response to market changes, manual labor automation, and much more.\nVanguard IBP features detailed simulation and optimization modules that adjust for strong seasonal demand, limited historical sales, and more. It also features advanced automation, which applies the optimal forecast method (automatically), a key benefit for non-expert business users. Finally, collaborative workflow design ensures that the right people put the right knowledge and insight into the equation.\nBenefits: \n\nComplete set-up in days Live synchronization with database Dynamic data-push back to database: Forecasts, min-max inventory levels Multiple implementation options: AX (AOS), files, web services Unlimited time-series data capability Strictly adherent integration technology — Microsoft Dynamics best practices Web-based user access (on-premises and cloud) for real-time and remote data access, management, and reporting Enterprise-class performance in capacity, speed, security, and accuracy Vanguard IBP Dynamics AX \nAbout Vanguard Software \nVanguard introduced its first product for decision support analysis in 1995. Today, thousands of companies across every major industry and more than 60 countries rely on Vanguard Integrated Business Planning (IBP), forecasting and advanced analytic solutions.\n3000+ Customers \nSmall and medium businesses to global industry leaders\n$580 Billion, and Growing \nTotal value of forecasts managed using Vanguard\n68 Countries \nOur products create value worldwide\n$1.9 Billion \nAverage annual value of forecasts managed in Vanguard by the typical customer",

      "text": "Microsoft Internet Explorer and Edge CVE-2016-7195 Remote Memory Corruption   Internet Explorer and Edge are prone to a remote memory-corruption vulnerability. Attackers can exploit this issue by enticing an unsuspecting user to view a specially crafted web page. Attackers can exploit this issue to execute arbitrary code in the context of the currently logged-in user. Failed attacks will cause denial of service conditions. Internet Explorer 9, 10, 11, and Edge are vulnerable.   Recommendations Run all software as a nonprivileged user with minimal access rights. To reduce the impact of latent vulnerabilities, always run nonadministrative software as an unprivileged user with minimal access rights. Deploy network intrusion detection systems to monitor network traffic for malicious activity. Deploy NIDS to monitor network traffic for signs of anomalous or suspicious activity. This includes but is not limited to requests that include NOP sleds and unexplained incoming and outgoing traffic. This may indicate exploit attempts or activity that results from successful exploits Do not follow links provided by unknown or untrusted sources. Web users should be cautious about following links to sites that are provided by unfamiliar or suspicious sources. Filtering HTML from emails may help remove a possible vector for transmitting malicious links to users. Implement multiple redundant layers of security. Memory-protection schemes (such as nonexecutable stack and heap configurations and randomly mapped memory segments) will complicate exploits of memory-corruption vulnerabilities.  ",

      "text": "Microsoft SQL Server Master Data Services CVE-2016-7251 Cross Site Scripting   SQL Server is prone to a cross-site scripting vulnerability because it fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input. An attacker may leverage this issue to execute arbitrary script code in the browser of an unsuspecting user in the context of the affected site.   Microsoft SQL Server 2016 for x64-based Systems Recommendations Run all software as a nonprivileged user with minimal access rights. Attackers may successfully exploit client flaws in the browser through cross-site scripting vulnerabilities. When possible, run client software as regular user accounts with limited access to system resources. This may limit the immediate consequences of client-side vulnerabilities. Deploy network intrusion detection systems to monitor network traffic for malicious activity. Deploy NIDS to detect and block attacks and anomalous activity such as requests containing suspicious URI sequences. Since the webserver may log such requests, review its logs regularly. Do not follow links provided by unknown or untrusted sources. Web users should be cautious about following links to websites that are provided by unfamiliar or suspicious sources. Filtering HTML from emails may help remove a possible vector for transmitting malicious links to users. Set web browser security to disable the execution of script code or active content. Since exploiting cross-site scripting issues often requires malicious script code to run in browsers, consider disabling script code and active content support within a client browser as a way to prevent a successful exploit. Note that this mitigation tactic might adversely affect legitimate sites that rely on the execution of browser-based script code.  ",

      "text": "Microsoft Internet Explorer and Edge CVE-2016-7227 Information Disclosure   Internet Explorer and Edge are prone to an information disclosure vulnerability. Attackers can exploit this issue by enticing an unsuspecting user to view a specially crafted webpage. Successful exploits will allow attackers to obtain sensitive information that may aid in further attacks. Edge and Internet explorer 9, 10 and 11 are vulnerable.   Recommendations Run all software as a nonprivileged user with minimal access rights. To reduce the impact of latent vulnerabilities, always run nonadministrative software as an unprivileged user with minimal access rights. Deploy network intrusion detection systems to monitor network traffic for malicious activity. Deploy NIDS to monitor network traffic for signs of anomalous or suspicious activity. This includes but is not limited to requests that include NOP sleds and unexplained incoming and outgoing traffic. This may indicate exploit attempts or activity that results from successful exploits Do not follow links provided by unknown or untrusted sources. Web users should be cautious about following links to sites that are provided by unfamiliar or suspicious sources.

Attackers can exploit this issue by enticing an unsuspecting user to view a specially crafted web page. This could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the currently logged-in user. Failed attacks will cause denial of service conditions.   Recommendations Run all software as a nonprivileged user with minimal access rights. To reduce the impact of latent vulnerabilities, always run nonadministrative software as an unprivileged user with minimal access rights. Deploy network intrusion detection systems to monitor network traffic for malicious activity. Deploy NIDS to monitor network traffic for signs of anomalous or suspicious activity. This includes but is not limited to requests that include NOP sleds and unexplained incoming and outgoing traffic. This may indicate exploit attempts or activity that results from successful exploits Do not follow links provided by unknown or untrusted sources. Web users should be cautious about following links to sites that are provided by unfamiliar or suspicious sources. Filtering HTML from emails may help remove a possible vector for transmitting malicious links to users. Implement multiple redundant layers of security. Memory-protection schemes (such as nonexecutable stack and heap configurations and randomly mapped memory segments) will complicate exploits of memory-corruption vulnerabilities.  ",

      "text": "Even though there are plenty of phones that make it to the finish line and become available for purchase, there are others that remain in the shadows, never to see the light of day. Such a phone is Microsoft’s Lumia 750, which was supposed to occupy the space between the low-end Lumia 550 and the higher-end Lumia 950 and 950 XL , but was canceled before anyone could give it a chance. Now leaked images give us a glimpse of what might have been.\nAround front, the phone was rumored to feature a 5-inch, 1,280 x 720 resolution display, with a 5-megapixel selfie sensor and an 8MP main camera. Thanks to known device leaker Evan Blass, however, the first thing you will notice about the Lumia 750 is not the display or cameras, but its clean and colorful aesthetic . In terms of looks, it seems to be a combination of the Lumia 640 and Lumia 735, with the now-canceled phone possibly offered in multiple colors.\nMore: Microsoft to reportedly end sales of Lumia by end of year\nUnder the hood, Qualcomm’s quad-core Snapdragon 410 chipset and 1GB RAM were rumored to power the Lumia 750, with the meager 8GB of storage reportedly expandable through the MicroSD card slot. The 2,650mAh battery seems quite small, particularly when other phones include larger power packs, but thanks to the phone’s mid-range internals, it might have kept the Lumia 750 ticking from morning through the evening.\nFinally, the Lumia 750 might have run Windows 10 Mobile out of the box, but since the phone was in the works since 2015 , it might have also run Windows Phone 8.1.\nOverall, the Lumia 750 looks to have been a solid entrant in the mid-range phone space. The reasons surrounding its cancellation remain shrouded in mystery, though we assume they partly have to do with Microsoft reportedly doing away with the Lumia line and shifting resources to its rumored Surface Phone . Even then, Microsoft has quite the hill to climb, with the company’s mobile platform having captured",

      "text": "share It sounds like Microsoft has shelved its Xbox streaming stick The HDMI dongle was apparently scheduled for an E3 reveal this year; then the PlayStation 4 Pro happened. Save Timothy J. Seppala/Engadget \nPrior to Microsoft's keynote at E3 this year, a raft of rumors were swirling about. Microsoft's answer to the PlayStation 4 Pro (which we now know as Project Scorpio ) and the Xbox One S garnered most of the attention, but loose lips also suggested an Xbox-branded streaming dongle was in the works as well. The Chromecast-like device would've streamed Windows 10 apps and \"light Universal Windows Platform\" games in addition to content from an Xbox One. It would cost $99 according to Windows Central . Not anymore, however. \n\"Project Hobart\" (apparently the cool sounding codenames are reserved for gaming hardware), was pushed under the rug ahead of E3 to focus on the Xbox One S and revealing next year's high-end Xbox One, Project Scorpio. As WC tells it, Microsoft was going to order 300,000 units of the device and it'd release shortly after E3. Furthermore, Microsoft was apparently forced to prematurely reveal Scorpio after Sony spilled its guts to the Financial Times about PlayStation 4 Pro, just ahead of gaming's grand gala. \nThat last bit makes a lot of sense considering Microsoft has said close to nothing about the console in terms of real information, and chose to rattle off system specs and video of a motherboard instead of a console and games in June. \nBut this isn't all. The company apparently scrapped a few non-Xbox devices ahead of last month's Surface Studio event as well, according to The Verge . CEO Satya Nadella reportedly cancelled a Surface Mini tablet at the last minute, in addition to an Amazon Echo-like device that would feature the Cortana digital assistant. \nAgain, these are all reports with no official confirmation from Microsoft, so there's still the chance that we could see any of the aforementioned devices at some point in the future.",

      "text": "Microsoft patches 68 vulnerabilities, two actively exploited ones Two of the patched flaws are already being exploited and three have been publicly disclosed Related Use commas to separate multiple email addresses From Your message has been sent. Sorry IDG News Service | Nov 8, 2016 3:59 PM PT RELATED TOPICS Comments \nMicrosoft has patched 68 vulnerabilities in Windows, Office, Edge, Internet Explorer and SQL Server, two of which have already been exploited by attackers and three that have been publicly disclosed. \nThe patches are covered in 14 security bulletins , one dedicated to Adobe Flash Player which is upgraded through Windows Update in Windows 10 and 8.1. Six of the bulletins are rated critical and eight are rated important. \nAdministrators should prioritize the Windows patches in the MS16-135 bulletin, because they address a zero-day vulnerability that's already being exploited by a group of attackers known in the security industry as Fancy Bear, APT28 or Strontium. INSIDER: Traditional anti-virus is dead: Long live the new and improved AV \nThe vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2016-7255, was publicly disclosed by Google last week, only 10 days after notifying Microsoft about it. This caused a bit of friction between the two companies. \nGoogle gives vendors only seven days to fix vulnerabilities or to publish mitigation advice if those flaws are found to be exploited in active attacks. Microsoft disagrees with that policy and feels that Google's decision to make details about this vulnerability public put customers at increased risk. \nAnother Windows security bulletin that should be prioritized is MS16-132 . It's rated critical and fixes multiple remote code execution vulnerabilities, including another zero-day flaw that, according Microsoft, is already being exploited by attackers. \nThe vulnerability is located in the Windows font library and can be exploited through specially crafted fonts embedded into websites or documents. Successful exploitation allows attackers to take full control of the affected systems, Microsoft said in the security bulletin. \nThree other critical vulnerabilities in Internet Explorer and Edge, covered in the MS16-142 and MS16-129 bulletins, have been publicly disclosed before being patched. However, according to Microsoft they haven't been exploited in attacks yet. \nThe Office security bulletin, MS16-133 , is rated as important, but covers remote code execution vulnerabilities that can be exploited through specially crafted documents. \n\"Since Office documents are prevalent in typical corporate environments I think this bulletin should be treated as critical even if it is rated as ‘Important',\" said Amol Sarwate, director of the Vulnerability Labs at security vendor Qualys, in an analysis of the patches. \nMicrosoft SQL Server administrators should prioritize the MS16-136 bulletin which covers vulnerabilities in the RDBMS engine, MDS API, SQL Analysis Services and the SQL Server Agent. \n\"SQL Server vulnerabilities are relatively rare and although there is no remote code execution, attackers can gain elevated privileges which could allow them to view, change, or delete data and create new accounts,\" Sarwate said.
