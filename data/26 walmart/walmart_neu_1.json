      "text": "Walmart’s Black Friday deals on PS4 Slim, Xbox One S, Titanfall 2, Battlefield 1 and more Plus deals on Gears of War 4 , Overwatch and Mafia 3 share Electronic Arts Black Friday is just around the corner, and the biggest retailers in the country have started to announce what deals customers should expect in the coming days and weeks. Walmart revealed its deals on video games today, which include mark downs on the PlayStation 4 Slim and new releases like Titanfall 2 , Battlefield 1 and Mafia 3 . Walmart’s deals are pretty extensive and the list goes on, so we’ve broken it down section by section below to make browsing a little bit easier. PlayStation: One of the biggest deals is the $50 markdown on the 500 GB PS4 Slim bundled with Uncharted. The console, which also comes with The Last of Us: Remastere d and Ratchet & Clank , was originally $299, but Walmart has knocked off $50 and added a $30 store gift card. On the games side, NBA 2k17, WWE 2K17, Mafia 3 , the Destiny Collection, Overwatch, the BioShock Collection, Witcher 3, Call of Duty: Black Ops 3 Gold Edition and the Lego Harry Potter Collection will be available for $35 . Newer releases like Madden NFL 17, Battlefield 1, FIFA 17 and Titanfall 2 will be available for $27 . Mortal Kombat X, Grand Theft Auto 5, Plants vs Zombies: Garden Warfare 2, Batman: Return to Arkham, Ghostbusters, Mortal Kombat XL , Batman Telltale Series, Dying Light and The Division go on sale for $25 . Slightly older titles like Far Cry 4, Star Wars Battlefront, Need for Speed , and Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare will be available for $17 . Xbox: Like the PlayStation 4 Slim, Xbox’s slimmed down console will also be available for $50 cheaper than the current retail price. The white version of the 500 GB Xbox One S , bundled with Battlefield 1 , will go for $249.99. Those looking to pick up an Xbox 360 can also grab a 500 GB version of the console, bundled with Forza Horizon 2 , for $129.99. In terms of deals on games, it’s pretty similar to what Walmart is offering for PS4 users. NBA 2K17, WWE 2K17, Mafia 3, Overwatch , the BioShock Collection, Call of Duty: Black Ops 3 Gold Edition, Witcher 3 , and the Destiny Collection will be available for $35 . For $27 , Xbox One players can also pick up Titanfall 2, Battlefield 1, FIFA 17 and Madden NFL 17 . Mortal Kombat X, Just Dance 2017, Plants vs Zombies: Garden Warfare 2, Lego Marvel Avengers, Batman: Return to Arkham, Ghostbusters, Mortal Kombat XL , Batman Telltale Series, Dying Light and The Division are also available for $25 . Far Cry 4, Star Wars Battlefront and Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare will go for $17 . Nintendo: There aren’t as many deals on Nintendo products, but that shouldn’t be too surprising. The company is slowing down production on Wii U games as it ushers in a new console generation with the release of the Switch next March . Still, for those looking to pick up a couple of titles, there are a few deals. For those looking to get their hands on a new 3DS system, however, Nintendo did confirm earlier this week that its Black Friday special, which prices the console at $99.99, will be available at all U.S. retailers. Just Dance and Lego Marvel’s Avengers will be available for $25 , with Splatoon going on sale for $35 . Walmart’s Black Friday sale will kick off on Nov. 24 at 6 p.m ET and will run through Nov. 25. All prices are valid while supplies last. For other Black Friday deals, make sure to check out Polygon’s list of ongoing sales from different retailers including Target and Best Buy.

      "text": "Brace yourselves, everyone: Black Friday is nearly upon us. \nSEE ALSO: 60 heavily discounted Best Buy Black Friday deals you don't want to miss \nWith the annual shopping holiday/Thanksgiving hangover/consumerist feeding frenzy imminent, it's foolish to even consider entering the fray unprepared. Without a game plan, you might settle for a bad deal for that hot ticket item at the top of your list — or even worse, miss out on it entirely. \nKeeping that in mind, we've pored over the advertised discounts from one of the biggest holiday retailers, Walmart , to give you a cheat sheet for the best tech deals of the season. Especially if you're planning on winning the retail Hunger Games that is the in-store Black Friday experience (or avoiding the battle entirely by shopping online), knowing the savings beforehand can be a big help in knocking the must-haves off your list without completely maxing out your budget. Give the list a quick skim and keep an eye out for more print ads and online deals that roll out as zero hour approaches. Most of these prices are only available on Black Friday, so plan accordingly.\n4K TVs \n65\" Hitachi 4K Ultra HD LED LCD HDTV - $999.99 $599.00 \n60\" Samsung 4K Ultra HD LED Smart HDTV - $1098.00 $648.00 \n55\" Phillips 4K Ultra HD LED Smart HDTV - $498.00 $298.00 \nSmart TVs \n65\" Samsung Smart HDTV - $998.00 $798.00 \n60\" Vizio LED Smart HDTV - $698.00 $398.00 \n40\" Samsung LED Smart HDTV - $318.00 $248.00 \nHDTVs \n50\" Element or Emerson HDTV - $225 (in-store only) \n40\" Hisense LED HDTV - $198.00 $125.00 \n24\" Samsung LED HDTV - $229.99 $98.00 \nTablets \niPad Mini 2 (32GB) - $269.00 $199.00 \nLenovo Tab 10 (16GB) - $149.00 $99.00 \nSamsung Galaxy Tab E Lite (8GB) - $109.00 $69.00 \nGaming Consoles (discounts applied with gift card at purchase) \nXbox One S (500GB) Battlefield 1 Bundle - $299.00 $249.00 \nXbox 360 (500GB) Forza Horizon 2 Bundle - $179.00 $129.00 (in-store only) \nPlayStation 4 Slim (500GB) Uncharted 4 Bundle - $298.99 $249.00 \nWearables \nFitbit Charge 2 - $149.95 $129.00 \nFitbit Alta - $129.00 $99.00 \nFitbit Flex 2 - $99.00 $69.00 \nDrones \nDJI Phantom 3 Standard Quadcopter - $499.00 $369.00 \nPromark P70 3D VR Drone - $148.00 $99.00",

      "text": " Google+\nBrennan Linsley/Associated Press\nColorado began retail marijuana sales on Jan. 1, 2014. The marijuana industry in Massachusetts will face many of the same challenges.\nBy Dan Adams and Adam Vaccaro Globe Staff November 16, 2016\n“Big Pot” is not coming to Massachusetts.\nThough voters approved recreational marijuana last week, don’t expect a land rush to Massachusetts by out-of-state corporate profiteers who can quickly throw up a weed store on every corner.\nAdvertisement\nInstead, cannabis companies anticipate the retail market for legal marijuana here will be slow to develop and fragmented among numerous small firms, most of them homegrown startups or locally-owned partnerships with boutique pot companies from states such as Colorado.\n“There isn’t some megalithic industry that exists today,” said Kris Krane, the Boston-based president of marijuana investment and consulting firm 4Front Ventures. “The notion that there are these gigantic, big-money players running in to take this whole thing over is just a fiction. There’s no Philip Morris, no Anheuser-Busch, no cannabis division at Bank of America. Even the most successful company is still barely in the growth stage.”\nGet Business Headlines The absence of such conglomerates is due in large part to marijuana’s status as an illegal drug under federal law, which makes it very difficult for a single company to operate in multiple states and enjoy the economies of scale available to more conventional retailers. Colorado pot retailers that wanted to move into Massachusetts, for example, would essentially have to start from scratch here, building new growing and processing centers or partnering with a local cultivator.\nAnd despite pot’s much-touted upside — investment and research firm Arcview Group forecasts a $1.1 billion marijuana market in Massachusetts by 2020 — capital can be surprisingly hard to come by, again thanks to the federal prohibition, which scares off institutional investors.\nAs a result, experts predicted most marijuana storefronts — the most visible public sign of the drug’s legality — will be run by small companies with local ties and funding from boutique investment firms or even friends and family. Existing medical marijuana facilities will also likely play a role. Some retailers may partner with experienced operators from Colorado or Oregon, but a Walmart of Weed? There’s no such thing.\nAdvertisement\n“Unless you’re extremely well-capitalized and have a large workforce and are willing to re-create your business, jumping to a new state is extremely challenging,” Krane said.\nMassachusetts was one of four states to legalize marijuana last week, bringing the total nationwide to eight. That means companies that do have national ambitions have a pick of where to open next.\nThe biggest companies in the US pot business so far are not retailers — Colorado’s largest chain, Native Roots, has just 14 stores — but rather product companies that license their brands and recipes to dispensaries.\nOne of the largest such firms, Denver-based Organa Brands , has licensed its “O.penVAPE” brand of liquid marijuana concentrates to a medical dispensary in Salem. Organa makes concentrates for medical and recreational uses that are consumed through a vaporizer.\nOrgana Brands is planning an advertising push in advance of entering the Massachusetts recreational market, though president Chris Driessen said he would keep the tone of his marketing low key, to match the state’s somewhat more reserved attitude about marijuana.\n“I’m not going to have billboards blasting cannabis things all over the place,” he said. “We’re not the party crowd from Colorado trying to shove it down your throat.”\nJohn Blanding/Globe Staff/File\nThe immediate factor that will keep the recreational marijuana business from exploding overnight is Question 4 itself. Shops can’t open until January 2018 at the earliest.\nBut Organa and other cannabis companies are bracing for complications as regulators and state legislators consider changes to the ballot measure that could make any business decisions they make now moot. Among the proposals in play: raising marijuana taxes to offset regulatory costs, and extending the January 2018 timeline for the first pot shops to open.\n‘You’ve got to be flexible and patient. It’s not for the faint of heart’\nTim Keogh, Colorado marijuana grower Businesses also expect some municipalities will try to ban or limit marijuana activity ; in Colorado, just 75 of 321 local jurisdictions allow both medical and recreational pot shops .\nThose in the business said the tight government control and regulatory uncertainty recalls the troubled and prolonged roll-out of the state’s medical marijuana program .\n“It’s dynamic. You’ve got to be flexible and patient. It’s not for the faint of heart,” said Tim Keogh, whose Colorado company is raising money for a large marijuana greenhouse and processing center in Freetown.\nThe possibility of higher taxes is especially concerning for marijuana firms. They fear high rates will drive users back to the black market. Companies are also anxious about President-elect Donald Trump, who has sent mixed signals about whether he’ll continue the Obama administration’s hands-off approach to federal oversight.\nBut the most immediate factor that will keep the recreational marijuana business from exploding overnight is the language of Question 4 itself. Under the new law, residents can consume and grow their own marijuana beginning Dec. 15, but shops can’t open until January 2018 at the earliest.\nMoreover, the law gives existing medical marijuana licensees, or a company they designate, the first shot at recreational licenses for potentially as long as one year before other firms can apply.\nHowever, some medical dispensaries aren’t sure they even want to sell to the recreational market, given the uncertainty surrounding the law’s final form.\nOne medical dispensary, New England Treatment Access, has told patients it will seek a recreational license. But another, Beacon Compassion Center, which is opening a medical dispensary in Framingham, might not apply for a recreational license, even though it donated $5,000 to the legalization campaign, said director Steve Angelo.\nColumbia Care, a national medical marijuana company operating two dispensaries in Massachusetts under the Patriot Care brand, has a more complex outlook. It is only interested the medical side of the business, yet it is considering seeking recreational licenses in order to serve patients who are wary of registering with the state as medical marijuana users.\n“If someone comes to us and they want additional privacy, I don’t want to be in a position where we can’t help them,” said Columbia Care chief executive Nicholas Vita.\nDespite the long road ahead, cannabis companies are hopeful they’ll eventually be rewarded in Massachusetts.\nDriessen envisions the state becoming a major center of so-called “canna-tourism” that draws people from all around the populous Northeast region, as it and Maine are the only East Coast states to have legalized pot.\n“We came to the Massachusetts medical market knowing that, one day, recreational was going to come, even if the return was going to be a bit slower,” he said. “We’re always skating where the puck is going, not where it’s at.”\nDan Adams can be reached at daniel.adams@globe.com .

      "text": "This $6 Award-Winning Malbec Is Only Available At ... Walmart? Now you can get toothpaste, guns and award-winning wine all in the same store. 11/16/2016 05:35 pm ET Elyse Wanshel Associate Editor, Good News, The Huffington Post Purestock via Getty Images \nTo some, drinking a $6 bottle of wine seems like a pour decision. But one cheap Malbec is getting a lot of positive buzz. \nOn Monday, the award-winning La Moneda Reserva Malbec became available exclusively at 500 Walmart locations throughout the U.S. for $6.29 a pop. Asda \nThe Chilean red wine was named the best in the world in a blind taste test which comprised of 240 experts at the Decanter World Wine Awards — the world’s biggest and most influential wine competition. It nabbed the title of best in show in the “best single-varietal red under £15” category, crushing 16,000 other entries like a bunch of grapes. \nAccording to The Independent, judges described the wine as having “an excellent freshness” and a finish that was “full of energy.” It was also praised for its flavor of “freshly crushed black fruit, creamy vanilla yoghurt and pepper spice.” \nThe wine also pairs well with dark chocolate and barbecue favorites like lamb and pork, Walmart told Thrillist. \nThe ridiculously cheap red was previously only available at the British supermarket chain Asda, a subsidiary of Walmart, until it U.S. debut on Monday. \nExpect it to be sold out by Friday.

      "text": "Slide 3 of 7 \nBooks and other media \nWhen it comes to entertainment — be it books, music or TV shows — you’re typically better off shopping Amazon than Target or Walmart, says Konrad. For example, on Nov. 18th, Amy Poehler’s new book “Yes Please” was priced at just over $17 on Amazon.com, while it was more than $20 at Target.com; on that day, Walmart had the same price as Amazon.com on the hard copy, but on Amazon you could order the Kindle version of the book, which was only $12.99. Meanwhile, Taylor Swift’s 1989 album was priced at $13.88 on Walmart.com vs. $9.99 on Target (a temporary price cut, the site noted) and $9.99 on Amazon.com. Shutterstock Slide 4 of 7 \nBedding \nConsumer savings expert Andrea Woroch says that while Walmart and Target do have good prices on bedding, the quality — which is likely important to consumers since they spend six or more hours on their beds a day — often isn’t up to snuff. “The price for the quality is not good,” she says. She adds that you can often find better quality at reasonable prices at Macy’s M, +0.74% during sales and with coupons or at Homegoods and TJMaxx TJX, -0.33% Shutterstock Slide 5 of 7 \nFurniture \nFurniture is often one of the priciest things we buy for our homes, with many sofas and beds easily costing more than $1,000. But don’t assume you should buy these items from Walmart or Target to save money. Instead, Konrad says that IKEA is often the way to go for discount furniture (just come prepared with your patience as assembly is, well, challenging). Getty Images Slide 6 of 7 \nOrganic fruits and veggies \nIn recent years, stores like Walmart and Target have increased their organic food selection, so now you can buy some of the items you once might have had to go to Whole Foods WFM, -1.05% for. But Heffernan says that may be a mistake. “Shop Trader Joe’s for the best prices, especially in fruits and veggies,” she says. She says that doing so can sometimes save you 5 - 10%. However, Woroch notes that Target’s Archer Farms brand (some of its foods are organic) of food like milk, eggs, snacks and cereal is typically 10% cheaper than at grocery stores.

      "text": "As the potential of blockchains rattle beyond the financial realm, Walmart is the latest to try out the technology in the hopes that it can track food through the supply chain and pick out and recall tainted products.\nAs Ars has reported before, blockchain technology is essentially a ledger of data chunks—blocks—that link together using validation codes. Each block’s code references that of the one before it, creating an unbroken, sequential chain. Thus, all the blocks are preserved forever in the order in which they were added, providing a sort of built-in validation system—or as Ars previously described it, as a “ souped-up audit trail ”—locked from tampering. Better still, the chain doesn’t need to be stored in a master location but can instead be distributed among multiple computers still creating a linked record.\nThe technology was initially applied to secure money transactions, underwriting the rise of Bitcoin. But recently, there’s been a push to use it in other industries. In February, Ars reported that IBM was offering blockchain-as-a-service for businesses , particularly ones involving logistics, such as those in food supply. The idea is that food products could be tracked as they move from farms and factories to store shelves. Using tags and sensors, a product’s location, temperature, and other statistics could be recorded in a blockchain ledger at each step of the way.\nAs it happens, Walmart took IBM up on just that offer. In October , the commercial giant teamed up with IBM and Tsinghua University in Beijing to track pork in China as it moves from the farm to the shelves. Walmart is also tracking packaged produce in the US using blockchains. Walmart hopes that if anything goes wrong, such as the meat ships with contamination or spoils during delivery, affected batches can be quickly identified, tracked, and pulled from the reach of consumers.\n“It gives them an ability to have an accounting from origin to completion,” Marshal Cohen, an analyst at researcher NPD Group Inc. told Bloomberg . “If there’s an issue with an outbreak of E. coli , this gives them an ability to immediately find where it came from. That’s the difference between days and minutes.”\nFor a retailer such as Walmart, which serves 260 million customers a week, an efficient tracking system also means the difference between pulling a few affected shipments and needlessly tossing products from hundreds of stores as a precaution.\nThis week, Walmart offered an update on the trial. “So far things are flowing smoothly and as expected,\" Frank Yiannas, vice president of food safety at Bentonville, Arkansas-based Walmart, told Bloomberg . If the trial continues to be successful, Walmart plans to expand blockchain ledgers to multiple foods in the US and China.",

      "text": "0 \nWill go quick \nUpdate: Gdammit it sold out. You can set alert notification and all that but we'll also let you know if another retailer carries it. Lasted less than two hours. \nI'm not even going to start this post with some feeble attempt at an intro/small talk. Do you want the New Nintendo 3DS Super Mario Black Edition for $99 ? The one that was released just for Black Friday? If so, head to Walmart and claim your prize. New Nintendo 3DS Super Mario Black Edition — $99.99 (list price $100) Pre-order, most system arrives before December 15 \nThe similar priced White Edition is unfortunately all sold out - so you're stuck with the black model. While the deal is for the entire Black Friday period - we're pretty sure the Black Edition will eventually sell out well before Cyber Monday rolls around. \nAnd if its anything like other things Nintendo are producing (ahem, NES Classic), they never meet the proper demand level and the next time you'll be able to pick up a unit is God knows when.

      "text": "Reuters Slide 1 of 7 Most Americans have purchased at least a few items from discount stores like Walmart and Target — and many of us have spent thousands at these stores over the years. But despite their low-price and convenience-oriented reputations, you may want to rethink what you buy at these stores. \nBut first, here’s what you should consider buying at these stores. “You can find great deals on clothes, shoes, and most household items,”says Erin Konrad, a spokesperson for CouponPal.com . Meghan Heffernan, the communications director for Savings.com , adds that toys are often well-priced at these stores too. \nRead: Target beats own estimate with surprise profit \nBut just because — as Konrad puts it, “there are plenty of good buys at both Walmart WMT, +0.67% and Target TGT, +0.57% ” — you can’t assume that you have carte blanche to buy, buy, buy at these stores. Here are five items that you may want to consider purchasing elsewhere, experts say. \n\nShutterstock Slide 2 of 7 Wrapping paper and other holiday items \nWhen you’re doing your holiday gift shopping at Walmart or Target, it’s tempting to load up on wrapping paper, gift tags, greeting cards and other holiday items, but this may not be a good idea. “Dollar stores are hands-down the best place to purchase seasonal items” Heffernan says. “Dollar stores typically carry all your wrapping needs (paper, boxes of holiday cards, ribbons, gift boxes, gift tags, etc. of course all for $1),” she points out. \nOne year later: What have we learned from the Target data breach? \n\nGetty Images Slide 3 of 7 Books and other media \nWhen it comes to entertainment — be it books, music or TV shows — you’re typically better off shopping Amazon than Target or Walmart, says Konrad. For example, on Nov. 18, 2015, Amy Poehler’s new book “Yes Please” was priced at just over $17 on Amazon.com, while it was more than $20 at Target.com; on that day, Walmart had the same price as Amazon.com on the hard copy, but on Amazon you could order the Kindle version of the book, which was only $12.99. Meanwhile, Taylor Swift’s 1989 album was priced at $13.88 on Walmart.com vs. $9.99 on Target (a temporary price cut, the site noted) and $9.99 on Amazon.com. \n\nShutterstock Slide 4 of 7 Bedding \nConsumer savings expert Andrea Woroch says that while Walmart and Target do have good prices on bedding, the quality — which is likely important to consumers since they spend six or more hours on their beds a day — often isn’t up to snuff. “The price for the quality is not good,” she says. She adds that you can often find better quality at reasonable prices at Macy’s M, -0.71% during sales and with coupons or at Homegoods and TJMaxx TJX, +0.33% \n\nShutterstock Slide 5 of 7 Furniture \nFurniture is often one of the priciest things we buy for our homes, with many sofas and beds easily costing more than $1,000. But don’t assume you should buy these items from Walmart or Target to save money. Instead, Konrad says that IKEA is often the way to go for discount furniture (just come prepared with your patience as assembly is, well, challenging). \n\nGetty Images Slide 6 of 7 Organic fruits and veggies \nIn recent years, stores like Walmart and Target have increased their organic food selection, so now you can buy some of the items you once might have had to go to Whole Foods WFM, -0.19% for. But Heffernan says that may be a mistake. “Shop Trader Joe’s for the best prices, especially in fruits and veggies,” she says. She says that doing so can sometimes save you 5 - 10%. However, Woroch notes that Target’s Archer Farms brand (some of its foods are organic) of food like milk, eggs, snacks and cereal is typically 10% cheaper than at grocery stores. \n\nGetty Images Slide 7 of 7 Organic fruits and veggies \nIn recent years, stores like Walmart and Target have increased their organic food selection, so now you can buy some of the items you once might have had to go to Whole Foods US:WFM for.

      "text": "People shopped for Black Friday deals at a Walmart in Bentonville, Arkansas. \nRetailers are reporting stunning sales stats as Americans eagerly took advantage of Black Friday deals. \nAn eye-popping 137.4 million Americans are planning to or considering shopping during Thanksgiving weekend, according to a survey conducted by the NRF and Prosper Insights & Analytics. \nThat's more than the roughly 134 million ballots cast in the election , according to an ongoing tally by Cook Political Report. Target said that it sold more than 3,200 TVs per minute in the first hour of store opening. Macy's CEO Terry Lundgren told CNBC that some 16,000 people piled into the company's Herald Square flagship store when it opened at 5 p.m. Thursday — roughly 1,000 more people than last year, when the store opened an hour later. Amazon said that customers ordered more than 100,000 toys within the first few hours of Black Friday. \nBut retailers were cashing in even before Black Friday officially started. \nWal-Mart said it sold 150 million pounds of turkey and ham this Thanksgiving. During the month of November, the big box retailer said it sold more than six pies per second. That's a lot of sweet potatoes. \nStill, a survey from the National Retail Federation found that Black Friday is likely to remain the busiest shopping day of Thanksgiving weekend. \n— CNBC's Krystina Gustafson contributed to this report.

      "text": "Bill Burr wants you to know that there's absolutely nothing at Walmart worth getting trampled over for on Black Friday. Want an above-ground pool for 30 dollars off? Wait a week. Love those tasty Mint Milano Cookies? Don't be irrational, CVS is basically the same price. But in the event you defy Burr's wishes and make your way over to the Mart of Wal for a good ole'fashioned bargain, don't be in the front of the line — when the first wave of people inevitably fall down, you can run right over them, NFL style. Maybe you won't get trampled to death then.",
