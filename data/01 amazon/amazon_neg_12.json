      "text": "Learn More The American Heart Association and Amazon Web Services Launch Cloud-Based Precision Medicine Data Marketplace to Accelerate Scientific Discovery The AHA Precision Medicine Platform allows researchers and clinicians to access and analyze vast and diverse data to facilitate collaboration and accelerate breakthroughs in prevention, treatment and cures for heart disease and stroke.   Program   \nEMBARGOED UNTIL NOVEMBER 13, 2016 AT 4:00 PM ET \nNew Orleans – November 13, 2016 – Today, the American Heart Association (AHA) announced a milestone in its strategic collaboration with Amazon Web Services (AWS) – the launch of a global, secure cloud-based data marketplace that will help revolutionize how researchers and clinicians come together as one community to access and analyze rich and diverse data to accelerate solutions for cardiovascular diseases -- the No. 1 cause of death worldwide. \nThe AHA Precision Medicine Platform, announced at today’s AHA Scientific Sessions in New Orleans, will include a vast array of curated rich datasets, that are centrally stored, easily searched and accessible, and managed on the AWS cloud. This platform enables researchers and clinicians to aggregate and analyze a rich breadth and depth of data including longitudinal cohorts, proteomic, genomic, and gene expression data using a precision medicine approach to uncover critical cardiovascular disease insights that translate into medical innovations that positively impact millions of lives. \nThe Possibility of Precision Cardiovascular Medicine \nPrecision cardiovascular medicine takes into account an individual’s biology, environment and lifestyle and is driven by advanced methods of aggregating, integrating and analyzing patient data to develop prevention and treatment strategies for individuals. Derived from the fullest possible range of biological and environmental factors relevant to a patient’s cardiovascular health, the Platform will integrate data from clinical trials, long-running epidemiologic studies, clinical registries, and real-time health data acquired through wearable devices and technology. \n“The Platform will harness the power of big data to revolutionize the way cardiovascular research is performed and speed the promise of precision cardiovascular medicine,” said AHA CEO Nancy Brown. “The AHA remains steadfast in its commitment to eliminate the tragic global burden cardiovascular disease places on individuals, families, healthcare systems, and entire nations by mapping scientific discovery to the dramatic advances in biomedical research and technology innovation.” \nThe Power of Cloud Technology \nAWS, a leading cloud services provider, provides the computational and analytic power needed to manage an information ecosystem of this magnitude. Cloud computing is already accelerating scientific progress throughout academia, industry and government, helping to forge new models of open science, collaboration and discovery. Through a cloud-based infrastructure, the Precision Medicine Platform will advance our community of researchers together. to find solutions for patients. \n“AHA and AWS bring unique strengths and complementary expertise to the Precision Medicine Data Marketplace with AWS offering the immense computational and analytical power necessary to manage the information ecosystem of this magnitude,” said Teresa Carlson, Vice President Worldwide Public Sector, AWS, Inc. “We are very excited to work with AHA to quickly bring resources and advancements to patients more rapidly and to make these scientific discoveries a reality.” \nThe Promise of Precision Medicine Platform \nSeveral initial healthcare and research organizations are leading the way as data contributors to the AHA Precision Medicine Platform including: AstraZeneca, Cedars Sinai Heart Institute, Dallas Heart Study, the Duke Clinical Research Institute (DCRI), Intermountain Medical Center Heart Institute, the International Stroke Genetics Consortium, and Stanford Cardiovascular Institute. \n“AstraZeneca is pleased to work with the AHA, AWS and other groups on this important initiative. By contributing de-identified data from our clinical trials and bringing together - under one umbrella - the data, and the tools, this initiative will help scientists and clinicians advance our understanding of cardiovascular disease in a cost and time effective manner, to ultimately bring benefits to patients,” said Fouzia Laghrissi Thode, V.P. GPPS Therapy Area, Cardiovascular & Metabolism, AstraZeneca. \n“This platform will facilitate important collaborations that should help uncover new causal factors and targets for therapy.” said James de Lemos, MD of the Dallas Heart Study. \n“By making large numbers of data sources more easily available to researchers, this collaboration will accelerate the movement toward greater openness in clinical research,” said DCRI Executive Director Eric Peterson, MD, MPH. “It will also help speed the development of scientific discoveries into usable treatments for the patients who need them most.” \n“These findings could help stratify individuals, groups, and entire populations according to their risk of cardiovascular disease and likely response to treatments,” said Joseph C. Wu, MD, PhD, Director of the Stanford Cardiovascular Institute. Driving Precision Medicine through Data Grants \nTo spark collaboration, AHA is providing access to the Precision Medicine Platform through a series of grants. AWS is providing grant recipients free access to computational cloud storage and analysis as part of the AHA data grant portfolio. Grant submissions are in progress and the first round of recipients will be announced in April 2017. More information on submission deadlines for the Data Grant Portfolio can be found at http://institute.heart.org . \nThe Precision Medicine Platform will be available at https://precision.heart.org/ and is a marquee project of the AHA Institute for Precision Cardiovascular Medicine. Additional information can be found at http://institute.heart.org . ### \nAbout the AHA Institute for Precision Cardiovascular Medicine \nThe American Heart Association Institute for Precision Cardiovascular Medicine is the only organization dedicated exclusively to advancing precision medicine in cardiovascular care. The Institute aims to preserve and prolong health by architecting more precise scientific discoveries – those that take into account a person’s genetics, environment and lifestyle – for better prevention and treatment of cardiovascular diseases and stroke.

      "title": "Amazon confirms order problem has been fixed Korea-based servicemembers",
      "text": "More \nBy KIM GAMEL | STARS AND STRIPES Published: November 13, 2016 \nSEOUL, South Korea — U.S. servicemembers can again place orders with Amazon after the online retailer’s website blocked some shoppers from completing their purchases for several days. \nWith the holidays fast approaching, soldiers and others who use the military postal system in South Korea were shocked to find themselves unable to order from Amazon.com. \nThe problem was limited to certain zip codes and appeared to mainly affect South Korea, although problems also were reported in Italy. \nServicemembers quickly formed a Facebook group to share information and coordinate their response. Many reached out to Amazon’s customer service department only to be told repeatedly about the company’s shipping policy and restricted items. \nBut the online retailer was listening, and the problem was fixed for most on Sunday. \nAmazon said the problem happened while it was trying to increase coverage for military and State Department customers by adding a number of zip codes. \n“Unfortunately, in processing the change, we inadvertently removed a number of zip codes temporarily – the opposite of what was intended,” the company’s Kelly Cheeseman told Stars and Stripes in an email. “The issue is now resolved.” \nAir Force Tech Sgt. Brandon Peterson, who is stationed at Yongsan Garrison in Seoul, said he first encountered the problem on Thursday. \n“We finished watching all the election drama and then thought let’s just get our first big order of Christmas stuff done,” he said, expressing relief after he was finally able to place an order Sunday. \nTroops, civilian employees and others based overseas depend heavily on Amazon.com orders and other online services that use the military postal system, which allows them to receive and send packages via the U.S. Postal Service. \nA person at Amazon who was familiar with the issue said the problem was limited and was fixed by updating the APO, FPO and DPO zip codes that had been affected. \nThe reason some could create a shipment and others couldn’t depended on the location of the servers used for the requests, the person said on condition of anonymity. Once the updates are registered throughout the system, everyone should be able to use the system as usual. \nThose still having problems should try emptying their cart and closing the browser. Then open a new browser window and create a new order. Or send a help request via “contact us” on Amazon’s website. Twitter: @kimgamel Servicemembers at some locations overseas were unable to place orders at Amazon during the latter part of last week, but the problem appears to be mostly resolved. Ellen M.

      "text": "Business Amazon’s Next Big Move: Take Over the Mall Unable to resist any opportunity to sell you something, the e-commerce leader is opening up brick-and-mortar bookstores. But its online prowess doesn’t yet translate into a very good retail experience. by Nick Carr November 14, 2016 \nAs I pull my phone from my pocket and start snapping pictures, I feel like a private eye, or even a secret agent. I’ve just walked into Amazon Books, the Web giant’s flagship bookstore in Seattle, but my intentions have little to do with shopping. I’m on a reconnaissance mission. \nLike many authors, I have a love-hate relationship with Amazon. The love is transactional. Amazon sells about a third of all printed books purchased in the country, and some two-thirds of all e-books. The hate is a form of mistrust. The company’s size gives it immense power, and it has at times acted like a predator, trying to dictate the terms of bookselling while showing contempt for the traditions of publishing. I’m not entirely sure whether Amazon wants to be my benefactor or my undertaker. \nSo here I am, behind frenemy lines, taking photographs of shelving. Bezos may love books, but what he loves even more is the idea of total victory, with no survivors among the vanquished. \nAfter a half-dozen shots, I stow the phone and approach one of the four clerks in the store, a solicitous young man with a slightly antsy demeanor. He smiles when I ask why the leviathan of virtual retailing would bother opening a store in the real world. “We’ve accumulated 20 years of data on bookselling,” he replies, then adds, “And Jeff Bezos really, really loves books.” I sense he’s said these things before. I inquire about the store’s design, and he explains that it was modeled on the Amazon site. All the books are displayed with their covers facing outward, a visual echo of the thumbnail images that crowd the Web store. Beneath each volume is a small placard that displays the book’s Amazon star rating—only books that have earned at least four stars from Web buyers are stocked—and that also includes a brief excerpt from a customer review. One of the store’s displays offers “If you like this, you’ll love this” suggestions, a play on Amazon’s recommendation engine, while another promotes new books that racked up a lot of pre-orders online. \nI wander to the center of the store, between the fiction and the nonfiction sections, and find a series of low tables displaying, in Apple Store fashion, samples of various gadgets that Amazon sells under its own brand. There’s the Kindle Paperwhite e-reader, the Fire HD tablet, and the Echo voice-activated virtual assistant, along with a selection of headphones, wireless speakers, and other accessories. At the head of the hardware aisle, facing the shop’s entrance, is a big television running Fire TV, Amazon’s set-top streaming box. A little boy is sitting on a bench in front of the screen, engrossed in the video game Crossy Road. \nWhat’s Amazon doing with Amazon Books? That question has hung in the air ever since the Seattle store opened in November 2015. Speculation about the company’s motives intensified during 2016 when it opened two more bookstores, in San Diego and Portland, Oregon, and divulged plans for more in Chicago and suburban Boston. Since Amazon has said little about its strategy (it ignored my requests for comment), Wall Street analysts and tech writers have filled the void with conjecture. The stores are all about selling gadgets, goes one popular idea, with the books there just to lure customers. The stores are data-gathering machines, goes another, enabling Amazon to extend its tracking of customers into the physical world. Or maybe the company’s secret plan is to use the stores to promote its cloud computing operation, Amazon Web Services, to other retailers. \nThe theories are intriguing, and they may contain bits of truth. But the real impetus behind the stores is probably much simpler: Amazon wants to sell more books. \nNot long ago, the common wisdom held that Amazon would remake the book business in its own image. Its Web store would kill off bookstores, and its Kindle would render physical books obsolete. In an interview in 2009, 18 months after the Kindle’s launch, Jeff Bezos suggested that the “great 500-year run” of the printed book was coming to an end. “It’s time to change,” he declared. Readers had a different idea. After an initial boom, sales of digital books went flat and then started to fall—in the mainstream trade-book market, e-book revenues dropped 11 percent in 2015 alone, according to the Association of American Publishers—while sales of printed books, far from collapsing, held steady. Bookstores, too, have been making a comeback, led by small, independent shops. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, sales in bookstores grew 2.5 percent in 2015, the first uptick since 2007, and the growth rate strengthened to 6.1 percent during the first half of 2016. The number of newly opened bookshops has also been on the rise. “Pure-play Web retailing is not sustainable.” \nBezos underestimated the allure of bricks and paper. With his bookstore chain, he now seems to be admitting that if Amazon is to expand its share of the book market, it will need to invest in bricks as well as bits. Beyond the business rationale, it’s hard not to see a certain vindictiveness to Amazon’s move. Having come up short in its plan to supplant books and bookstores with digital alternatives, the company is taking its revenge by attacking traditional bookshops on their own turf. Unlike the mom-and-pop independents, or even the struggling Barnes & Noble chain, Amazon has the scale and the cash required to wage a war of attrition. It can sustain losses on its stores for a long time. Bezos may love books, but what he loves even more is the idea of total victory, with no survivors among the vanquished. \nThe limits of online retail \nAmazon Books may be just the vanguard of a much broader push into brick-and-mortar retailing by the company. In October, the Wall Street Journal revealed that Amazon is planning to open a chain of convenience stores, mainly for groceries, along with drive-in depots where consumers will be able to pick up merchandise ordered online. It has also begun rolling out small “pop-up” stores to hawk its electronic devices. It already has more than two dozen such kiosks in malls around the country, and dozens more are said to be in the works. \nEven after 20 years of rapid growth, e-commerce still accounts for less than 10 percent of total retail sales . And now the rise of mobile computing places new constraints on Web stores. They can’t display or promote as many products as they could when their wares were spread across desktop or laptop monitors. That limits the stores’ cross-selling and upselling opportunities and blunts other merchandising tactics. \nAt the same time, the smartphone, with its apps, its messaging platforms, and its constant connectivity, gives retailers more ways to communicate with and influence customers, even when they’re shopping in stores. This is why the big trend in retailing today is toward “omnichannel” strategies, which blend physical stores, Web stores, and mobile apps in a way that makes the most of the convenience of smartphones and overcomes their limitations. Some omnichannel pioneers, like Sephora and Nordstrom, come from the brick-and-mortar world. But others, like Warby Parker and Bonobos, come from the Web world. Now, with its physical stores, Amazon is following in their tracks. “Pure-play Web retailing is not sustainable,” New York University marketing professor Scott Galloway told me. He points out that the deep discounting and high delivery costs that characterize Web sales have made it hard for Amazon to turn a profit. If Amazon were to remain an online-only merchant, he says, its future success would be in jeopardy. He believes the company will end up opening “hundreds and then thousands of stores.” \nBeyond its expertise in Web sales, Amazon brings distinctive strengths to an omnichannel operation. Its vast, efficient network of warehouses and distribution centers can supply outlets and process returns. It has, thanks to the largesse and patience of its investors, a reservoir of cheap capital that it can draw on to fund a building spree. And it has a much-admired brand. What Amazon lacks is experience in the touchy-feely world of traditional retailing. The company’s proficiency in software and data crunching is unquestioned. Its people skills are another matter. \nVariable prices \nThe Seattle store sits between a Tommy Bahama and a tanning salon at the southwest corner of the upscale, open-air University Village mall. The exterior is clad in brick, with black-metal moldings around the windows. The floor is hardwood—handsome, tea-colored planks. The shelves and tables are built of thick, grainy boards. Even the big TV monitor up front is encased in a wooden frame. The lighting is bright, the signage crisp. Neither cozy nor trendy, neither retro nor modern, the space is pleasant without being distinctive. It suits the mall setting. \nAs I walk around, I overhear another clerk tell a customer that Amazon Books is “all about browsing.” But that’s not the way it feels to me. The narrow aisles and the head-high shelves, with all those outward-facing covers, produce a mild claustrophobia that discourages leisurely shopping. And the relatively small selection of high-ranking books, all arrayed in uniform rows, sends a message of fungibility. Every choice seems equally safe, a data-sanctioned “good read.” (The four-star cutoff tends to filter out the controversial and the experimental.) Despite a few armchairs and a long bench along one wall, the shop has a grab-and-go vibe, not much different from that of an airport bookstore. \nThe most distinctive feature of Amazon Books lies not in its design or its merchandising or even its technology—the tech seems about on par with what you’d find at a Starbucks—but in its approach to pricing. There are no price tags on the books, and what customers pay depends on whether or not they’re enrolled in the Amazon Prime loyalty program. Those without a Prime membership pay the list price. Those with Prime pay Amazon’s discounted online price. To find out what that price is at the moment, you have to carry a book to one of several bar-code-scanning stations set up around the store. Scan the code on the back cover, and the price is revealed on a screen. (As an alternative, you can scan a code on the book’s shelf placard with an Amazon app on your phone; that brings up the book’s page, with its current price, on the Amazon site.) The process is cumbersome, but it hints at what is probably another of the store’s goals: to promote the Prime program, which is central to Amazon’s strategy of locking in customers. \nHaving spent nearly an hour in amateur black-ops mode, taking photos and scribbling notes, I sense that the clerks are eyeing me with suspicion. Not wanting to blow my cover, I decide I should buy something and leave. I grab a copy of Joan Didion’s Slouching Towards Bethlehem (4.3 stars) and take it to a small checkout area tucked away near the cookbook section. A sign in front of the registers informs me that I have the option of paying with my phone, but that would require launching an app, scanning yet another code, and then handing the phone to the checkout clerk. It seems simpler to swipe a credit card. Not being a Prime member, I pay full retail: 15 bucks, plus tax. \nOutside, it has started to rain. I summon an Uber and sit in the back as the driver follows the route on his smartphone over the Montlake Bridge and through the city to the Courtyard by Marriott where I’m staying. Going up to my room holds little appeal, so I head into the lounge, order a vodka, and flip through my e-mails. Over the bar are three TVs, each tuned to a different ball game. I feel let down. I had convinced myself that I was going to witness something fresh and unexpected at Amazon Books. What I found was an annex to a website—a store that, despite the bricks and paper, retains the coldness of the virtual. \nNicholas Carr is the author, most recently, of the essay collection Utopia Is Creepy.

      "text": "Nov 13, 2016 10:45 PM EST Amazon Neglects Labor Rights? 'No Toilet Break' Experience Of Drivers Revealed Approximately 5,000 Amazon workers at the Leipzig and Bad Hersfeld warehouses have gone on a 24-hour strike in an effort to press the company harder in their ongoing labour dispute over wages and work hours. (Photo by Sean Gallup/Getty Images)(Photo : Sean Gallup / Getty Images) Labor rights are human rights and those who violate these can be termed as labor rights violator. Amazon, one of the leading online stores worldwide is alleged to be a violator after imposing illegal rules with their truck delivery drivers. Advertisement Amazon has been long outsourcing their drivers and other workers to agencies. All the rules and terms of references are then consulted with both parties before the signing occurs. However, it seems like the Amazon is breaking what was written and signed after increasing the quota of drivers per day. Drivers are expected to deliver 200 parcels a day, at the minimum. Some have been forced to break speed limits just to cut their travel time from one point to another, to be able to deliver more parcels per day. Advertisement In of the written documentaries of BBC , it stated how poor the condition was of the drivers of Amazon. As one driver told, there are times that they even defecate in bags because they got no time to go to toilet room s. He also revealed that he has been working for 11 hours straight and receiving no additional incentives for overtime . The Amazon has been facing a lot of labor rights violation to all its employees since last year. The administrator of Amazon was called to action after reports that their workers, who they call Amazonians, are crying into their desks after the longer time of duty and low compensation. Advertisement Amazon's chief spokesman continues to erase the disgrace brought by media on their company. \"This is an incredibly compelling place to work,\" said Jay Carney in his interview on CBS This Morning . The allegations against the leading online store in the world become more severe every year. Exploitation of workers has been one in the growing and most appealing issues. That is especially now that there are global circumstances to pose a significant impact on the said industry, Jobs & Hire reports.  ",

      "text": "2 \nWell I'm a PHP developer who know few linux commands to get my job done. \nI need to launch a symfony 1.4 website on Amazon EC2. Everything is fine except IMagick. I magick is also installed through following command: sudo yum install ImageMagick \nIts php lib is not installed/configured, if that do not happen with above command. In PHP, I'm using IMagick, but script is failing on IMagick. I know problem is with PHP IMagic extention but dont know how to fix that. On dev box, its as simple as turning it on on WAMP. \nCan someone please suggest where should I look to confirm if IMagick PHP extention installed and configured correctly?",

      "text": "Reply It's been this price twice so far, once in August and then in September. Seems like at the end of every month they dip the price down to £299, this time they've delayed it for \"black Friday sales\". Battery life is only 4 hours and it's difficult to find up to date reviews on it (There's at least 4-5 models with the exact same name but different specs). RAM is also DDR3 and the laptop is quite heavy at 2.8kg. Decent deal, but considering it's been this price several times before I wouldn't call it special or a must buy. Will keep on waiting and see what other deals \"Black Friday\" throws up.",

      "text": "Amazon is launching its new music streaming service in the UK in a bid to take on Spotify and Apple Music, priced from as little as £3.99.\n\nIt comes less than a month after the long-rumoured service was revealed in the US, and will feature music from top artists such as Adele.\n\n“We’ve been thrilled with customer reaction to the launch of Amazon Music Unlimited in the US last month and we’re excited to quickly bring the service to customers in the UK,” said Amazon Music vice president Steve Boom.\n\nAmazon is pinning its hopes on integration with its home assistant device to give it a leg up on rivals. Those who want to listen only via Amazon Echo will pay just £3.99 for the service.\n\nFor those who already have a subscription to its Prime service it will be £7.99, or £79 per year, while the standard price for non-prime members is £9.99.\n\nAmazon has been working on the launch of its streaming service in the UK since it first debuted Prime Music last July, which includes work on getting Alexa, the voice assistant of the Echo, to understand commands when people are asking it to play music .\n\nUnlimited will have millions more tracks and other features for users than Prime Music, which had already picked up more than one million users in its first year.\n\nA UK team will work on creating local playlists for the service and while the firm would not disclose the size of the team, Amazon's head of digital music Paul Firth in the UK said it now had more than twice as many people working on digital music than physical music and plans to increase the number in future.",

I ordered literally the minute they went live on the website and I've just had an email saying they don't know when it is going to be delivered. Mine is out for delivery. At work all day though :( Think I pre-ordered on the first day it was available. Amazon now saying stock will be available on 30th October. also the footnote on their PSVR item page is alarming: \"Note: Due to limited stock we are only able to offer one unit per customer per address. You will be notified via email of the expected delivery date closer to the time. We will be fulfilling customer orders in the order in which they were placed and expect to fulfil all customer pre-orders by 12 December, 2016. This product comes with a UK plug and therefore may not be suitable for use outside of the UK.\" I ordered from Tesco Direct back in May and mine is out for delivery along with Move Controllers, PS4 Camera V2 and Driveclub VR",

      "text": "Amazon’s new music streaming service arrives in the UK with an Echo hook An Echo-only subscription plan will cost you £3.99 a month share Amazon is launching its on-demand music streaming service, Amazon Unlimited Music, in the UK. The service was unveiled in the US last month , and offers 40 million tracks, Android and iOS mobile apps, and both hand-picked and algorithmically-generated playlists. But, it's not to be confused with Prime Music — a comparatively limited music-streaming service that Amazon bundles in for free with a Prime yearly subscription. In the UK, Amazon Unlimited Music will cost £9.99 a month for non-Prime members or £7.99 a month/£79 a year (that's £6.58 a month) for those that are subscribed to Prime. (Spotify, by comparison, charges £9.99 a month in the UK.) There’s also a deal where you can get access to Unlimited Music on just a single Echo or Echo Dot for £3.99 a month. To be clear, that means you can't use the service on phones, tablets, or PCs, but you get the same music catalogue from your Echo speaker at a cheaper monthly cost. Amazon is hoping tight integration with Echo and Alexa will be a big selling point for Unlimited Music. After all, Spotify has its brilliant music recommendations and Apple has its big-name exclusives; Amazon Unlimited Music has to have a stand-out feature of some sort, and that appears to be better support for Alexa. Using an Echo, you can ask for a band’s latest track, for example, or for music from a specific time period (\"Alexa, play David Bowie from the 70s\"). Combined with the cheap Echo-only subscription, this might make Amazon Unlimited Music a great choice for some households, but it's not clear how Amazon will compete with more established services.

      "text": "Amazon is launching its Spotify rival, Amazon Music Unlimited, in the UK with a headline price of £9.99 a month and access to a library of “over 40 million” songs.\nThose figures are comparable to competitors like Spotify and Apple Music, but where Amazon is focusing its competition is on a pair of special offers, as well as the tight integration with its own hardware ecosystem.\nThe service is cheaper for those with an Amazon Prime subscription, the company’s all-you-can-eat free delivery package. The monthly cost drops by £2, to £7.99, and an annual payment plan is available for £79 a year, taking the equivalent monthly fee to £6.58.\nThat’s how Amazon is hoping to entice users to upgrade from its other free streaming service, Amazon Prime Music. That service comes free with Amazon Prime, and offers a much more limited catalogue of just 2 million tracks (that figure has increased by 500,000 to coincide with the launch of Music Unlimited). Amazon’s head of Digital Music, Paul Firth, says that Prime Music is intended to be a gateway service for users who wouldn’t otherwise pay for a separate streaming service, with Music Unlimited the obvious next step.\nBut there’s an even cheaper option for some. Owners of Amazon’s Echo systems, the company’s range of smart speakers, can sign up for a heavily reduced subscription to Music Unlimited that only works with one Echo per subscription. The monthly fee is just £3.99, a cut that Amazon has reportedly arranged in conjunction with the publishers (as opposed to the discount for Prime members, which is apparently coming out of Amazon’s pocket).\nThat subscription, which can only be purchased with a voice command directly from an Echo, also enables Amazon to push its other killer app: a collection of smart voice controls that let users ask for music from the smart speakers without needing to think of a specific artist or song.\nAmazon Echo: the first 13 things to try Read more \nOne set of controls lets users ask for music by a time period, genre or mood: “sad indie music from the 90s”, for instance, or “happy 80s pop music”. The idea, Firth says, is to let music fans skip the step of having to think of a specific band that meets their mood, and just describe their mood directly.\nTracks in the database have been tagged with up to 11 moods; each of the moods had 5,000 songs tagged manually, and then machine learning took over. The same tags can be applied on a narrower basis, letting users ask for “Oasis songs from before 1997” or “happy Radiohead songs”.\nAnother set of controls is based on an enormous lyrics database that Amazon has integrated with its streaming service. Users can ask for a song based on its lyrics (“Play the song that goes ‘ Sasquatch, King Kong, Godzilla, Loch Ness ’ [Monster by Kanye West, in case you are wondering]”), or tap on a particular line in the Amazon Music app to jump straight there.\nAmazon is also attempting to take on Spotify in an area where the latter is already strong: personalised playlists and recommendations. Spotify’s Discover Weekly, Daily Mix and Release Radar functionality, which create personalised playlists based on the users’ previous activity, have been well-received by the userbase, but Amazon is hoping that its own success in shopping recommendations will transfer over.",

      "text": "One month after launching in the U.S. , Amazon has announced that its on-demand music-streaming service is now available in Europe too.\nArriving today in the U.K., Germany, and Austria, Amazon Music Unlimited (AMU) is essentially an extension of Amazon’s existing Prime Music service which offers a limited selection of tracks as part of Amazon’s annual Prime membership. With Amazon Music Unlimited, however, Amazon is taking on the big players of the music-streaming world, including Spotify and Apple Music.\nThe pricing and service of AMU is pretty much the same in Europe as it is in the U.S. Non Prime-members will pay €9.99 / £9.99 a month for access to around 40 million tracks on-demand, which is the same as Spotify or Apple Music. However, this price falls to €7.99 / £7.99 per month for Prime members, and €3.99 / £3.99 per month on an Echo subscription plan, which basically limits listening to a single Amazon Echo, a device which launched in Europe a couple of months back. There is still no family plan available through AMU, but Amazon has previously announced that it will make one available in the future — this will likely cost around $15 / €15 / £15 per month for a family of six.\nOverall, AMU is comparable with its competitors , with Prime members able to save €24 / £24 per year compared to Spotify or Apple Music. Amazon hasn’t given any indication that it will launch AMU in other markets, but given that it had specifically announced that the U.K., Germany, and Austria would receive the on-demand streaming service soon, it’s not likely to launch in other markets in the foreseeable future.\nGet more stories like this on Twitter & Facebook ",

Amazon Music Unlimited launches in the UK, with Echo as its secret weapon 0 Share: Enlarge Image \nAdele is one of the best-selling British artists available on Amazon Music Unlimited and Amazon Prime Music. Photo by Gareth Cattermole/Getty Images \nAmazon Music Unlimited has launched in the UK -- and if you team it with Amazon Echo , it's one of the cheapest streaming services around. \nAmazon Music Unlimited launched in the US in October and crosses the pond to launch today. Music Unlimited is a standalone music service, separate from the music service that comes with Amazon Prime . It's a rival to Spotify , Tidal , Apple Music and the like, boasting 40 million songs. But what really makes it stand out, according to Amazon, is how it works with the Echo speaker and Alexa voice-control system. \nYou can stream music on your phone or computer with Music Unlimited's app, the same as Spotify et al. Where it gets more interesting is if you own an Amazon Echo or Echo Dot speaker, because then instead of typing an artist's name in a search box, you can just say what you want the voice-activated Alexa to play from Music Unlimited. \nSay to your Echo, \"Hey Alexa, play Adele\", and the \"Hello\" singer's dulcet tones will fill the room. Say \"Hey Alexa, play some sad indie from the 90s\", and it'll draw on metadata tagging songs with their genre, mood and release date to play you an appropriate mix. 41 Here's everything the Amazon Echo can do \nCleverly, if you say \"Hey Alexa, play the new song\" from an artist, and it'll guess that you mean the song you've just started hearing on the radio rather than the most recent single released a while ago. You can also say some lyrics too if you don't know the title of the song. \nEcho and Alexa will also talk back to you. If it's playing a random selection and you hear a song you like, you can ask what it is and Alexa will tell you. Can the Amazon Echo speak British? We test out Alexa, Amazon's voice-controlled assistant, to see how well she understands British words, phrases and accents. Tally-ho chaps! by Richard Trenholm Close Drag \nThe combination of Echo and Music Unlimited is also attractive in another way: price. A subscription to Music Unlimited costs £9.99 per month, the same as a Spotify subscription, unless you get involved with other Amazon products. It costs £7.99 per month or £79 per year if you're already a Prime member, but that's on top of the £70 annual Prime fee. \nWhere it gets cheaper is if you have an Echo or Echo Dot. Whether you have Prime or not, Music Unlimited through an Echo costs just £3.99 per month. \nThe Echo speaker costs £150, but the smaller Echo Dot is just £50. So if you buy an Echo you have a full music streaming service through a voice-controlled speaker for just under a hundred quid a year, compared to Spotify or Apple Music's annual cost of £120.

      "text": "Amazon Music Unlimited Launches In The UK 10:14 am By Roland Hutchinson \nAmazon Music Unlimited is now available in the UK, the service was previously only available in the US where it launched last month. \nAmazon are offering their new Amazon Music Unlimited for £7.99 a month for Amazon Prime Members and for £9.99 a month for non Prime members and you can use it on any device with this plan. \n“We’ve been thrilled with customer reaction to the launch of Amazon Music Unlimited in the U.S. last month and we’re excited to quickly bring the service to customers in the UK,” said Steve Boom, Vice President Amazon Music. “Starting today, Amazon Music Unlimited offers our UK customers playlists and stations curated by our music experts in the UK, featuring leading British and international artists – we think customers are going to love it.” \n“Amazon Music Unlimited brings real value to the millions of people in the UK who are already Prime members, with a choice of subscribing for only £7.99 a month or even £79 per year,” said Jeff Bezos, Amazon Founder and CEO. “And if you want a sense of the future of voice-controlled music, go ahead and ask Alexa for a free Amazon Music Unlimited trial, and play around on your Echo. If you don’t know the name of a song but know a few lyrics, if you want to hear songs from a specific decade, or even if you’re looking for music to match your mood, just ask. Our U.S. customers love Amazon Music Unlimited on Echo, and we think our UK customers will too.” \nThe company is also offering a cheaper plan like they do in the US, where the Music Unlimited can be used on a single Echo or Echo do, this one will cost you £3.99 a month. \nYou can find out more details about the new Music Unlimited from Amazon at the link below, it is now available in the UK from today and you can try out a free trial for 30 days.",

      "text": "Music Unlimited’s cheapest price is available to owners of the Echo speaker. \nAmazon has launched its new Spotify rival, Music Unlimited , in the UK, offering listeners access to 40 million songs for as little as £3.99 a month.\nLaunched in the US in October , Amazon Music Unlimited offers UK customers the same three price tiers: £9.99 a month for regular users, £7.99 a month for Amazon Prime subscribers and £3.99 a month for owners of the company’s Echo speaker.\nThe Echo device, which features Amazon’s Alexa digital assistant, allows users to select tracks and playlists, pause and search for new music based on mood using voice control. It also controls connected home devices such as lights and thermostats.\nAmazon’s price point of £3.99 for Music Unlimited will make the Echo speaker very attractive to those who think Spotify and Apple Music’s £9.99 a month are too expensive. However, at £149.99, listeners would have to commit to the service for just under two years to start seeing any savings.\nMusic Unlimited isn’t the first streaming service to be launched by Amazon, which already has Prime Music available to Prime subscribers. But Prime Music has a much more limited catalogue – only 2 million tracks.\nEven with a £3.99 price point, Amazon faces an uphill struggle to gain a foothold in the streaming business. Spotify now has over 40 million paid subscribers , with Apple Music on 17 million.\nThe post Amazon launches £3.99 streaming rival to Spotify and Apple Music appeared first on FACT Magazine: Music News, New Music. .",

      "title": "Amazon Music Unlimited Makes Its Way To The UK",
      "text": "Amazon Music Unlimited Makes Its Way To The UK  36 PST \nLast month Amazon announced a new music streaming service called Amazon Music Unlimited . For those unfamiliar, the service is a new service that is separate from Prime Music, and the upside is that it is also available to non-Prime members, which hopefully will allow it to better compete against the likes of Spotify, Apple Music, and Tidal. \nThe good news is that if you don’t live in the US, you’ll be pleased to learn that Music Unlimited has since expanded beyond the US borders and has made its way to the UK where it will be priced at £9.99 a month for non-Prime members, and £7.99 for those who are subscribed to the company’s Prime service. This pretty much puts it on par with Spotify who charges the same amount, but if you are subscribed to Prime then it will be cheaper for you. \nFor those who plan to use the service only at home, there is the option to use with the Echo or Echo Dot and those plans are priced at £3.99 a month, which is actually pretty affordable, although admittedly rather limited in terms of availability and accessibility. However for those who know their usage habits are pretty much at home, then we guess it’s not such a bad deal. \nAmazon will definitely need to start expanding to other countries if they hope to compete with the likes of Apple, Tidal, and Spotify, but for now if you are in the UK you can check out the service if you’re so inclined. \nFiled in Audio > General .

      "text": "November 13, 2016 3:47 PM Amazon looks to clean house – literally \nBy Angel Gonzalez \nIs Amazon.com thinking of providing good housekeeping as its next Prime member perk? \nTwo Seattle job postings for “home assistants” on Amazon’s website suggest so. \nThey call for potential recruits to join “Amazon Assistants,” which the company describes as “experts in helping Amazon customers keep up their home.” \nThat means helping customers with “tidying up around the home, laundry, and helping put groceries and essentials like toilet paper and paper towels away.” \nThe goal is to provide, as part of a two-person team, “timesaving assistance to Amazon Prime members,” so they can run an “errand-free” home. \nAmazon didn’t respond to a request for comment. \nThe apparent venture serves to underscore how creative Amazon is becoming when it comes to reasons to join the Prime membership program. \nMembers pay $99 a year for guaranteed shipping and get perks that range from a Netflix-like streaming video service to photo storage and even free books. \nMembership also includes discounts to Amazon Music Unlimited, a Spotify-like music-streaming service, in addition to a more limited music library at no extra cost. \nIn exchange, Amazon receives cash flow that helps cover the cost of the perks. Most important, it gains loyal shoppers. Members spend twice as much as nonmembers do ($1,200 annually on average, according to Consumer Intelligence Research Partners, a research firm). \nThe success of the program has been such that it has become one of Amazon’s main “pillars,” multibillion-dollar revenue generators. Nearly half of U.S. households belong to the program, according to analysts. \nCIRP, the research firm, says membership growth is beginning to slow somewhat as it starts to reach the limit of households that can afford it. \nSo the obvious way to stir up more interest is by packing in more perks. CEO Jeff Bezos highlighted Prime in his most recent letter to shareholders, saying that “we want Prime to be such a good value, you’d be irresponsible not to be a member.” \nAmazon devotees can already hire a housekeeper through Amazon’s marketplace for independent home-service providers, launched last year. \nBut this seems different: Amazon’s job posting is for a housecleaning Amazonian, with benefits ranging from Amazon stock and health insurance, as well as possibly overtime pay. \nThe posting is written with the cheerful prose the company uses to entice engineers or data scientists. \n“If you love making a house feel like a home then this is the role for you,” the ad says. \n“Tasks you will become awesome at” include housecleaning alongside a professional cleaner, washing and folding laundry, restocking essentials and groceries. \nAlso, Amazon is looking for “outgoing, detail-oriented, and tech savvy” college graduates or those with an equivalent degree to fill the job. Five or more years of experience as a hotel concierge or a barista help, according to the job posting. Related content ",

      "title": "Google Home vs Amazon Echo vs Apple Home: Amazon's Music Unlimited lands in the UK - IT PRO",
      "text": "14 Nov, 2016 Amazon Music Unlimited features two pricing tiers and Alexa voice commands \nThe sci-fi vision of a connected home is quickly becoming a reality. Indeed, both Amazon and Google have unveiled smart assistants and an Apple offering based on the company’s HomeKit system is rumoured to be on the way. \nThese products are designed to act as standalone hubs for your digital life. Voice activation systems allow users to ask questions, perform tasks control their IoT appliances, without even having to touch their phones. \nWe look at how the three major smart assistant products compare to each other, based on the information we’ve currently got. We'll be updating this article as and when we know more so please stay tuned... See related Google Home release date, features and price: What is it and how does it work? Latest News \n14/11/16: Amazon has launched its new music streaming service, Music Unlimited, in the UK as a competitor to rivals like Apple Music and Spotify. \nIt offers around 40 million songs and over 1,000 playlists on demand to subscribers in the UK, Germany and Austria, after also launching in the US last month. \nPrime customers can use the service for £7.99 a month, while non-Prime members will pay the full price of £9.99. However, a second, cheaper tier, is also available. Tied to the Echo and Echo Dot, users can choose to pay a £3.99 monthly subscription, but they would have to upgrade to listen to music on more devices. \n\"We've been thrilled with customer reaction to the launch of Amazon Music Unlimited in the US last month and we're excited to quickly bring the service to customers in the UK,\" said Steve Boom , vice president of Amazon Music. \"Starting today, Amazon Music Unlimited offers our UK customers playlists and stations curated by our music experts in the UK, featuring British and international artists.\" \nAlthough Amazon Echo users may already be using Spotify, Amazon claims its own music service offers far more integration with the Alexa voice assistant. In one example Amazon gave, voice commands like \"Alexa, play the song that goes, 'I was doing just fine before I met you'\", Alexa will play 'Closer' by The Chainsmokers. \nUsers can of course play specific genres of music, artists, music from certain time periods and tell Alexa to put on a random shuffle of songs. Amazon has not yet allowed other streaming services to \"teach\" these functions to Alexa, and will hope its more sophisticated user experience can draw customers to the service. \n14/10/16: Amazon Music Unlimited, the company's challenge to Spotify and Apple Music, has a cheaper tier specifically designed for its Echo speaker. \nUnlimited will include tens of millions of songs and let users search for a song by its lyrics, and will cost $9.99. \nBut Amazon also promised a second tier of pricing for those who own its Wi-Fi speaker, Echo. \nEcho users will be able to download a cheaper $3.99 version of the service that works exclusively on Amazon’s speaker. This music service will be perfectly integrated into Echo, enabling users to ask Amazon’s virtual assistant Alexa to play a particular artist or song. \nAmazon started investing in music services in 2008, launching MP3, an alternative to iTunes, where users could purchase the songs of artists they liked. However, the service never appeared to reach the peak of iTunes, and Amazon now seems to be following the most recent music streaming service trend. \nThe Telegraph reported that in 2015 the number of people using streaming services rose from 41 million to 68 million. \nAmazon Music Unlimited could arrive in Europe later this year and should be first introduced in the UK, Germany and Austria. \n04/09/16: First announced at the company's developer conference earlier in the year, Google has finally taken the wraps off Google Home, its answer to the Amazon Echo. \nBuilt around the company's new Google Assistant, Google Home is designed to answer questions and perform tasks based on verbal interactions. As expected, it performs all the usual smart assistant functions, such as streaming music, telling you about traffic and the weather and controlling all of your smart home stuff. \nUnlike rivals, however, it also interfaces with the whole suite of Google apps, meaning it can tell you what you've got in your Google Calendar, give you directions and cue up videos on your Chromecast. It can even play music from YouTube and stream to Chromecast Audio. \nOn top of that, it does anything you'd expect Google search to do, which includes providing information about local businesses, answers to questions culled from Google's store of over 70 billion facts and featured snippets of content from other websites. \nDesign-wise, it looks like a plug-in air freshener more than anything else. It's got a wide, rounded base, tapering slightly to end in a flat, sloping top. The top acts as a capacative touchpad through which users can play and pause content, activate the Assistant and control the unit's volume. \nJust like the Amazon Echo, it's also got a mute button to ensure it won't be listening to you unless you want it to be. Like Alexa's 'flash briefing' service, it will give you a summary of everything you need to know in the morning, but alongside the latest headlines it will also give you the current weather, traffic updates and your schedule all in one go. \nBoth base and top are available in a selection of materials and colours designed to match your home or office décor, including mango, marine and violet options for the fabric base, and metal bases in copper, snow and slate. You can also have multiple interlinked Google Home units in the same house. \nHere's the rub, though - it might not be coming out in the UK. Apparently, the company \"hopes\" to bring it to non-US territories, but there's no guarantee that it ever will - which is a shame, because it actually looks really rather good. It costs $129 in America, so if it ever does make it to these shores, expect the price to be around £100. \n30/09/16: Thousands of BT broadband users who have bought the newly laucnhed Amazon Echo intelligent voice-controlled speaker have run into frustrating setup issues, rendering them useless and unable to connect to the internet. \nFor those not using BT broadband, the setup process, completed through Amazon’s Alexa app for Android and iOS or a web browser, was a done in minutes. However, scores of BT customers took to Twitter to rant how they had spent hours fighting with it, following the instructions and ending with stalled, inoperable devices. \nAn Amazon spokesperson said: “We are aware that a small number of customers are currently experiencing issues connecting their Amazon Echo to some BT routers. We are working with BT to resolve this issue as quickly as possible.” \n15/09/2016: The Amazon Echo family has officially been launched in the UK, with the smart home devices set to ship to customers this Autumn. \nThe Amazon Echo is a connected speaker that uses an AI core powered by AWS's cloud, called Alexa. Alexa can control smart home equipment, play music, answer questions and tell jokes. \nA number of key partners have already developed integrations for Alexa - known as 'skills' - including Spotify, Hive, The Guardian, Just Eat and National Rail. Amazon has also released an SDK for Alexa, letting developer freely create new skills and integrations. \nSome have voiced concerns about the privacy implications of having an always-on microphone connected to AWS in your home, but Amazon was quick to placate those fears. \nThe company assured critics that the microphone only listened for the 'wake word' that triggers Alexa, and will only begin streaming audio to the cloud once that word is detected. The Echo also features a mute button that physically prevents the microphone being activated while it is turned on, and Amazon lets users delete anything heard by Alexa. \nAs well as the existing Amazon Echo, the company unveiled a redesigned version of the Amazon Echo Dot, the smaller form-factor model that eschews the Echo's inbuilt speakers. \nThe redesigned Dot now features an updated language processor and is better at recognising user commands. It also features the full range of Alexa-powered voice control functionality. \nThe Echo is priced at £150, with a £50 discount for Amazon Prime members for the first two days, and the Echo Dot will be available for £50. Both will be available in black or white and can be preordered immediately. \nThe Echo Dot is also available in packs of six and twelve, with Amazon offering one and two units for free, respectively. \n13/09/2016: The Amazon Echo is set to launch in the UK tomorrow, according to a report. \nThe company has sent out invitations for a special event in London, bearing a design scheme remarkably reminiscent of the Echo’s blue LED-highlighted body. The Financial Times also cited “industry sources” who confirmed the release date. \nThe company sent out a now-deleted tweet (apparently accidentally) indicating that the sold out Echo Dot model was back in stock, with the price knocked down to $50 (£37.93) – a price cut of almost half. Apparently not? @amazonecho : Introducing the all-new Echo Dot. Add Alexa to any room - now for just $49.99. https://t.co/AQkwY5xbHh /s/Z-sj \n— Darrin (@Indypodcaster) September 12, 2016 \nThis could indicate that Amazon is gearing up for some kind of large-scale Echo-based announcement on both sides of the pond. The company could even be preparing to launch an entirely new version of its connected speaker. \n23/08/2016: Amazon hopes to launch two music streaming services next month, one to rival Spotify and Apple Music and another that will work exclusively with its Echo speaker. \nThe retailer’s main streaming service would be similar to other players in the market, costing around $10 a month and allowing people to stream unlimited amounts of music anywhere they like, according to Recode , citing anonymous industry sources. \nThis tier would also let people download music to play offline, and cut out adverts entirely. \nIts other tier may prove more daring, however, costing between $4 and $5 per month and being tied exclusively to Amazon Echo, its home speaker controlled via its own Alexa voice assistant. \nThis means it would not work on smartphones or other mobile devices, so people would be confined to their homes when using it. \nThe Echo speaker has sold one million units since Amazon launched the device last year, but TechCrunch reports that it discontinued the Amazon Echo Dot – a device that turns home theatre systems into an Echo speaker – after a limited pilot run. \nStill, the company expects to sell 10 million Echo speakers by 2017, according to The Information . \nAmazon did not comment on Recode 's report. \n14/06/2016: Apple's WWDC developer conference has come and gone, and while the company did not unveil a standalone hardware unit to compete with AI-powered smart hubs like the Amazon Echo, it has come a few steps closer. \nThe first and most important change is that Apple has opened up the SDK for Siri, meaning that developers can now build Siri's voice command functionality into their apps. \nUber has already announced that customers will soon be able to book rides through Siri, and other major manufacturers are sure to follow suit. This will introduce a vast amount of useful functions - potentially more than Amazon currently has. \nAdditionally, Apple also released a Home app. Tied into the company's HomeKit platform, it provides a central application that iOS users can use to control all of their HomeKit-compatible smart home appliances. \nUsers can monitor their smart home tech - seeing which lights are on, etc - and set specific 'scenes', such as dimming the lights, closing the blinds and turning on the TV when you're ready to watch a movie. It's all controllable through Siri, too. \nWhile it's not quite the ready to act a central hub for your connected lifestyle, Siri just got an awful lot smarter, and could be on the way to taking on Amazon and Google. \n13/06/2016: Rumours about Apple's potential rival to the Amazon Echo and Google Home continue to swirl, with the news that the company's WWDC developer conference will see the launch of a Siri SDK. \nWhile Siri, Apple's digital assistant, has been around for years, its usefulness has thus far been somewhat limited. This is because - outside of a few select partnerships - Siri does not support third-party integrations. \nThis is expected to change at WWDC, however, where Apple is rumoured to be launching a software development kit for the function. This would allow any developer to program Siri functionality into their apps. \nIf true, Apple is certain to have some major integrations to show off, in order to demonstrate the new capabilities. One possible contender is Uber, as hinted at by the line on the WWDC invitation, \"hello driver, fast as you can\". \nIn order to give developers adequate time to create new Siri integrations for their apps, Apple is likely to open up their SDK for use immediately. However, if the company also unveils a dedicated hardware unit to compete with Amazon and Google's offerings, it won't be launched until later on in the year. \nWhile smaller hardware like the iPhone is typically available within a week or so of its announcement, larger items can take as much as three months to reach the market. We'd expect a Google Home-style smart hub to follow this timescale, arriving in September. \nOpinion is currently divided as to whether or not the company will unveil an entirely new device, or roll the new and improved Siri into the next generation of Apple TV - which is coincidentally due for a refresh around three months from now. \n01/06/2016: Rumours of a massive forthcoming Siri upgrade have lent further credence to the idea that Apple is set to release a competitor to Google Home and the Amazon Echo. \nAccording to a report from Business Insider , the upgrade will be powered by VocalIQ, a voice-recognition startup acquired by Apple last year. \nOne of the key selling points of the technology is that it pays attention to context, which helps it understand conversational speech much better than other rivals. \nVocalIQ's system claims a 90% accuracy rate when parsing conversational queries, compared to a success rate of just 20% for other digital assistants. \nIt also remembers context forever, meaning that if you ask for directions to a Chinese restaurant with free parking within two miles, it will remember those details when you ask it to find an Italian restaurant instead. \nOther advantages include the ability to filter out background noise and better recognition of accents, alongside machine learning components that help the voice recognition systems improve over time. \nIf rumours are to be believed, these features will very shortly be rolled into Siri, vastly improving its functionality. It would also indicate that Apple has big plans for its digital assistant beyond its current applications. \nPrevious reports have hinted that the company's new AI hub will take the form of an updated Apple TV - allegedly rebranded as 'Apple Home' - but whatever device Apple releases, this new evolved Siri looks set to be the backbone of it. \n27/05/2016: Apple's rumoured Siri-powered rival device to the Amazon Echo might be contained within the new Apple TV, VentureBeat reports. \nThis ties into the company's plans to make the Apple TV an all-purpose device for everything a user needs at home, or, a \"hub of everything\". This would, however, require many hardware and software updates to the current Apple TV. \nOne potential problem is the tendency for users to put their Apple TV somewhere out of sight, which could present a challenge to a Siri-powered speaker. Apple TV already comes with a Siri-powered remote, but battery life is limited. \nThe option of creating a standalone device for Echo-like purposes was reportedly dropped for financial reasons, according to the site. \n25/05/2016: A Siri-powered device similar to the Amazon Echo may soon be available, according to a report from The Information (via The Verge ). \nAmazon's voice-operated digital assistant became widely available in the US last year, but the Siri speaker has been in development for much longer, according to the report. Some of the features of the new device would include turning on and off any appliances supported by Apple's HomeKit platform, and performing other tasks associated with automated bots. \nThe Echo is powered by the Alexa Voice Service, which remains confined to the English-speaking U.S., giving Apple a strategic advantage with the multilingual Siri. \nAccording to TechCrunch , the new Apple device will likely be more high-end than less expensive products like Apple TV, estimating the cost to be around $300, significantly more expensive than the $180 Echo. \nThe news comes on the heels of Google announcing its own Echo competitor called Google Home a week ago at the company’s I/O 2016 developer conference. The release date and price of this device are still unknown, but it is expected to be available later this year. \nApple is reportedly also opening Siri up to third-party apps, finally giving developers the chance to tap into the voice assistant. The Siri software development kit is likely to arrive before the Echo rival and may be announced at the Apple Worldwide Developers Conference in June. Pages",

      "text": "  Amazon.com startet jetzt mit seinem Musik-Streaming-Dienst Amazon Music Unlimited auch in Deutschland durch. Ab sofort haben Musikfans über den Musikdienst von Amazon.de die Wahl aus über 40 Millionen Songs, Hunderten kuratierten Playlists und personalisierten Radiosendern ihre Liblingssongs auszuwählen und anzuhören. Prime-Mitglieder sparen auch bei Amazon Music Unlimited. So bezahlen Prime-Kunden für den Musikstreaming-Dienst von Amazon.de 7,99 Euro pro Monat oder 79 Euro pro Jahr (6,58 Euro/Monat). Kunden ohne Prime zahlen 9,99 Euro pro Monat für Amazon Music Unlimited. Zudem entfällt für Nicht-Prime-Mitglieder die Möglichkeit, ein günstigeres Jahresabo für den Musikdienst abzuschließen. Wer über Amazon Echo verfügt, der kann auch das exklusive Abonnement für Echo-Besitzer buchen. Dann kostet Amazon Music Unlimited nur 3,99 Euro pro Monat, mit vollem Zugriff auf den Amazon-Musicdienst auf einem Echo oder Echo Dot. Um einen kostenlosen Testzugang für \"Amazon Music Unlimited für Echo\" zu starten, genügt der Sprachbefehl \"Alexa, starte meinen Amazon Music Unlimited Testzugang\". Wer Amazon Music Unlimited später auch auf zusätzlichen Geräten wie beispielweise Fire TV , iOS, Android, Web, PC, Mac oder Sonos nutzen möchte, kann jederzeit zu einem Standard-Abonnement upgraden. Auch das Familien-Abonnement wird noch dieses Jahr verfügbar sein. Damit können dann bis zu 6 Familienmitglieder gleichzeitig Amazon Music Unlimited für 14,99 Euro/Monat oder 149 Euro/Jahr (12,42 Euro/Monat) nutzen. Tests",

      "text": "uk \nHere in the UK, we tend to lag behind the US when it comes to video or music streaming services being launched, but we’ve only had to wait a single month for Amazon’s Music Unlimited that launched in the States last month. The service has more than 40 million songs available to choose from costs £9.99 per month. If you are an Amazon Prime customer of own an Echo , though, you can subscribe at a discounted monthly fee. Join us after the break to find out more. \nAmazon is endeavoring to reward its customers for already being part of its ecosystem, Prime customers can grab a subscription to Music Unlimited for £7.99 monthly, or save a little by buying a 12-month subscription for £79.99. Whilst it’s a saving whichever way you cut it, it’s still a chunk of cash to hand out. A cheaper deal is available for Amazon Echo owners though in the form of an Echo only subscription that will run you to £3.99 per month, or £47.88 per annum. The Echo only subscription is tied to a single Echo device but will let you control the music via voice control and allow you to search partial lyrics to find a particular song. The more you use the Echo, the more it will tailor its options to your personal tastes. \nCurated playlists are also available with either subscription, meaning that if you fancy rocking out to classic pop songs from the 80’s, or perhaps a specific genre, you are catered for. Besides the Echo device, you can access Amazon’s Music Unlimited service on Fire devices, iOS, Android, web browser, PC, and Mac on the standard package. If you aren’t sure whether Amazon’s Music Unlimited service is for you, you can always take advantage of the 30-day trial offer to check it out. \nFull Press Release: \nLUXEMBOURG – 14 November, 2016 —Amazon today introduced Amazon Music Unlimited in the UK — an on-demand music service that redefines music streaming by putting a catalogue of over 40 million songs and thousands of hand-curated playlists and personalised stations not just at the tips of your fingers, but also on the tip of your tongue. Amazon Music Unlimited makes discovering new music or listening to favourites easier and more fun than ever with the recently redesigned Amazon Music app as well as with innovative new Alexa voice controls. \n“We’ve been thrilled with customer reaction to the launch of Amazon Music Unlimited in the U.S. last month and we’re excited to quickly bring the service to customers in the UK,” said Steve Boom, Vice President Amazon Music. “Starting today, Amazon Music Unlimited offers our UK customers playlists and stations curated by our music experts in the UK, featuring leading British and international artists – we think customers are going to love it.” \n“Amazon Music Unlimited brings real value to the millions of people in the UK who are already Prime members, with a choice of subscribing for only £7.99 a month or even £79 per year,” said Jeff Bezos, Amazon Founder and CEO. “And if you want a sense of the future of voice-controlled music, go ahead and ask Alexa for a free Amazon Music Unlimited trial, and play around on your Echo. If you don’t know the name of a song but know a few lyrics, if you want to hear songs from a specific decade, or even if you’re looking for music to match your mood, just ask. Our U.S. customers love Amazon Music Unlimited on Echo, and we think our UK customers will too.” \nMore for Prime Members Prime members now have more choice than ever when it comes to music streaming. Millions of Prime members already stream music on Amazon Prime every month at no extra cost to their membership, making Amazon Music one of the most popular music streaming services in the world. The Prime Music catalogue has grown to more than two million songs in the UK and over one thousand hand-curated playlists and personalised stations. \nToday, with the launch of Amazon Music Unlimited, Prime members who want even more music have access to a catalogue of more than 40 million songs and thousands of hand-curated playlists and personalised stations at a breakthrough Prime member price of £7.99/month or £79/year (which equals only £6.58/month). \nEven Better on Echo Millions of customers have fallen in love with Alexa and have given Echo over 30,000 5-star reviews on Amazon. Since the debut of Echo nearly two years ago, music consistently has been one of the most popular activities on Echo; now Amazon Music has reimagined music listening on Echo with intuitive new Alexa voice controls that turn your Echo into the ultimate personalised jukebox. No searching or browsing required…just ask. And with the advanced machine learning of Alexa, the Amazon Music experience will become more conversational and personalised all the time. Have words to a song stuck in your head but can’t remember the name of the song? All you have to do is say a few words and Alexa will play the song. For example, just ask, “Alexa, play the song that goes, ‘I was doing just fine before I met you'” and Alexa will play, “Closer” by The Chainsmokers Ready to listen to Sia? Just ask, “Alexa, play Sia” and Alexa will create a playlist of Sia’s most popular songs Want to hear the latest hit by Clean Bandit? Just ask, “Alexa, play Clean Bandit’s new song” and Alexa will play their latest single “Rockabye” Want to re-live the music from your university days? You can ask Alexa to play hit music from a decade or a specific year or month. Just ask, “Alexa, play the most popular indie from the 90s” and Alexa will take you back in time Feeling down and need a pick-me-up? Just ask, “Alexa play ‘Happy Music'” and Alexa will choose a playlist based on your listening history like “Happy Friday Feeling,”“100 Greatest Feel-Good Classics” or “Pop Pick-Me-Up” Want to listen to early catalogue from a favourite artist? Just ask, “Alexa, play David Bowie from the 70s” and Alexa will play tracks from Bowie’s most prolific period Having friends over? Just ask, “Alexa, play party music” and Alexa will choose a playlist based on your listening history like “100 Greatest Party Songs”, “80s Hip-Hop Party Starters” or Dance Pop House Party” Not sure what to play? Just ask, “Alexa, play music” and Alexa will find something personalised just for you \nAmazon Music on Alexa also brings fans and artists closer together with behind-the-scenes artist commentary about their music, called Side by Side. Customers can simply ask, “Alexa, play the One Republic Side-by-Side” and Ryan Tedder will play and comment on songs from One Republic’s latest album Oh My My. Side-by-Sides are available exclusively on Amazon Music from top artists such as Emeli Sandé, The Chainsmokers, Sting, Two Door Cinema Club, Madness, Norah Jones, The Shires and Michael Buble, with more being added all the time. \nAmazon is offering an exclusive “for Echo” subscription plan for only £3.99/month, with full access to Amazon Music Unlimited on a single Amazon Echo or Echo Dot. To start a free trial to the “for Echo” plan, just ask “Alexa, start my Amazon Music Unlimited free trial.” If you decide later that you want to enjoy Amazon Music Unlimited on multiple devices, including more than one Amazon Echo, on Fire devices, iOS, Android, Web, PC, Mac, Sonos and more, it’s easy to upgrade to a standard plan for an additional £4.00/month for Prime members (£6.00/month non-Prime customers). \nSleek and Intuitive New App The Amazon Music app has been redesigned with a beautiful, new interface that emphasises artist images and album art and puts music discovery and playback front and center. Key features of the app include “Home,” which showcases selections by Amazon Music editors to help customers stay up-to-date on the music they love and what’s trending and popular; “Recommended,” where customers can find personalised music suggestions powered by Amazon’s recommendation technology; and “Now Playing,” where synchronized lyrics make it easy to follow along to your favourite music.

      "text": "\nAmazon ’s music streaming service, Music Unlimited, is rolling out in the UK, Germany and Austria. Amazon made the announcement in a press release today – a month after Amazon Music Unlimited went live in the US – bringing the subscription-based music service to Europe for the first time.\nAmazon Music Unlimited is Amazon’s second recent attempt at cracking the premium music streaming market, after offering access to two million ad-free songs for its Prime members with its previous product, Prime Music.\nComprising of more than 40 million songs, Amazon Music Unlimited is a larger service from Amazon, who also overhauled its music app to coincide with the launch.\nSee also: 10 best music streaming apps and services for Android July 5, 2016 The UK price structure Music Unlimited follows closely to the US: £7.99 per month or £79 per year for Prime members – or £9.99 per month for non-Prime members, and £3.99 for use of Amazon Music exclusively with an Amazon Echo device. The discounted Prime and Echo rates provide purchase incentive in a product which otherwise does little to differentiate itself from Apple Music , Google Play Music and Spotify .\nIn a statement , Amazon said it was “thrilled” with the US reaction to Music Unlimited and that it was excited about the UK launch, but didn’t provide figures on the adoption rate of its service.\nWhat are your thoughts on Amazon’s latest music subscription service? Let us know in the comments.",

      "text": "Joseph Karbousky \nBlack Friday 2016 is less than two weeks away and some of the hottest deals will soon be available in stores and online. Two of the biggest online retailers, Walmart and Amazon, are ready to go head to head this holiday shopping season by slashing prices and once again offering “price match guarantees” on many of their popular items. \n— iHoliday (@Halloweengal801) November 14, 2016 \nEvery year major retailers like Walmart, Amazon, Target and Best Buy always try to outdo each other on Black Friday, but sometimes shopping the Black Friday pre-sales online can save consumers big bucks too. \nWhen it comes to price matching, stores are much more lenient than they were 20 years ago because they know the competition is fierce. However, there are some details to keep in mind when it comes to comparison shopping. \nGottabemobile reports Walmart will price match to local competitors as well as to select online competitors, including Amazon, but if you are a real bargain shopper you need to keep this in mind. They may not match “limited offers” or items that they won’t be restocking for several weeks due to high demand. \nWalmart’s policy does state “Walmart.com will not Price Match from Thanksgiving Day through the Monday after Thanksgiving.” \nNow while that may sound bad, it really isn’t. Walmart is already running great deals from now until the Wednesday before Thanksgiving that they will price match, and some of them are just as good as they will be on Black Friday. Walmart Black Friday 2016 deals have hit the internet. [Image by Joe Raedle/Getty Images] \nAlready items such as a Hitachi 65″ 4K Ultra HDTV is marked down to $599, which is $400 off the regular price. And of course if you find it at a cheaper price somewhere else they will price match. They also have hundreds of other great deals leading up to Black Friday on the hottest video games, Xbox One bundles and children’s toys. \nOther great TV deals Walmart will have for Black Friday shoppers include a Samsung 50-inch 4K Smart TV for $398, a Samsung 60-inch 4K Smart TV for $648, and a Philips 55-inch 4K LED Smart TV for $298. The real deal of the day will be a Hisense 40-inch 1080p HDTV for the incredible price of $125. \nAs for Amazon, they are already in Black Friday mode as well. The online retail giant is already running their annual “Countdown to Black Friday” with sale prices on everything, literally. The only trick is that you need to continue to look into what is on sale each day. Every day from now until November 24, Amazon will be offering multiple “Lightning Deals” and one hour sales throughout the day on various in-demand items like laptops, beauty products, HDTV’s, Kindles and more. \nIf you are an Amazon Prime member, you will get early access to over 30,000 deals for Black Friday and Cyber Monday online shopping specials, which include laptops up to 35-45 percent off the regular price and discounted prices on their hot-selling Amazon Echo. \nOne item that is always popular during the holidays is video game counsels, and this year will be no exception. The Xbox One and Play Station 4 will be on the wish list for many this season. Right now, if you are an Amazon Prime member you can pick up various game counsels of the Xbox One 500 GB for $242. Amazon Black Friday 2016 has workers on alert already. [Image by Jeff Spicer/Getty Images] \nThe Echo has received excellent reviews from many media outlets and is one of the most sought after gifts of the season. The Amazon Echo is a voice interaction device that can do it all! From playing music of your choice on demand, making to-do lists, setting alarms, streaming podcasts, playing audiobooks, and providing weather, traffic and other real time information, this all in one device named “Alexa” is a great assistant to have around. It would make the perfect gift for anyone – including yourself. \nOf course, let’s not forget the biggest advantage of buying from Amazon, Walmart and other online outlets, you can do it all from the convenience of your own home. \n[Featured Image by Joe Raedle/Getty Images]",

      "text": "Read More \nAmazon's Echo device launched in the UK in September, and is likely to be key to the success of the music service. Listening to music has been one of the most popular uses for the Amazon Echo smart-speaker , but Amazon Prime music only had a database of two million songs. A combination of a much bigger back catalogue and the natural language processing of Amazon's Alexa service could make the service more interesting to music fans. \nTo drive interest, Amazon is offering Echo owners a £3-a-month subscription, which gives them access to Amazon Music Unlimited on a single Amazon Echo or Echo Dot. To start their trial, owners can simply say \"Alexa, start my Amazon Music Unlimited free trial\". \n\"With the advanced machine learning of Alexa, the Amazon Music experience will become more conversational and personalised,\" the company said. \nIt's often hard to remember the exact name of a track -- especially as the Echo lacks a display, so you can't scroll through a list of options as you would on a PC or smartphone. But the machine learning embedded in Alexa could help here; Amazon said the service will be able to find a song from some lyrics rather than the name. \nFor example, if you say \"Alexa, play the song that goes, 'I was doing just fine before I met you',\" Alexa will play \"Closer\" by The Chainsmokers, Amazon said. The service should also be able to respond to requests like \"Alexa, play Clean Bandit's new song\", whereupon Alexa will play the band's latest single \"Rockabye\". More on the Amazon Echo",

      "text": "November 14, 2016 FBA China Sourcing is a full service sourcing company for Amazon FBA sellers, based in Hong Kong. We have 25 years of hands-on experience in China-based manufacturing, specializing in custom-made electronics and accessories for the health, fitness and weight loss industries.   Sourcing in China can be challenging for many Amazon FBA sellers, but with us as your professional sourcing specialist, it won't be. We understand the business of being an Amazon seller, leaving the client free to focus on marketing & finding new best-selling products. Our FBA Sourcing service allows the client to sit back and let us do all the work from finding manufacturers to delivering the product directly to the chosen Amazon warehouse. We take care of everything; from sample management to packing, labelling, certification, to the final shipment. Once the client has decided on a product and approved the sample, we will negotiate to get the very best price. We approach multiple suppliers of the same product to ensure the best quality and price. If the client has an existing supplier or a preferred supplier, we can enter into negotiations with them on its behalf to lower the MOQ and price. We personally carry out Dupro inspections on all products. We also arrange for third party final random inspections. Using certified inspection services means that the final product matches the approved samples and that all of the FBA-specific requirements are met. Shipment can be made to the client or directly to Amazon US/UK/CE fulfilment centres: Whether ex-factory, FOB or a full door to Amazon Fulfilment Centres Service is required, we have the expertise, using sea freight, air freight or couriers. For shipment to the Amazon warehouses we need to be provided with the Amazon shipping labels PDF. Through our freight forwarders we can also advise on the most suitable duty rates applicable to the destination country.",

      "text": "Phil Simon | November 14, 2016 5 Tweet \nThere are many reasons organizations like Netflix and Amazon can glean fascinating insights into consumer behavior: their data is vast and eerily accurate. That is, employees don't have to spend a great deal of time scrubbing data for location, past purchases, preferences and the like. Put differently, these companies need not speculate on who their customers are, merely what they want. \nBig difference. \nLamentably, that's not the case for the vast majority of organizations today. Cleansing and verifying data for even basic reporting – never mind sophisticated analytics – often hamstrings their efforts. Analytics \" projects \" with ambitious charters and big budgets wind up barely offering anything remotely resembling value. Another one bites the dust. \nWith respect to data preparation, organizations are loathe to truly empower nontechnical employees for many reasons, some of which are legitimate. (Can anyone say SOX ?) Along these lines, David Loshin writes about conventional approaches to data preparation. In his words: The data warehouse approach balances two key goals: organized data inclusion (a large amount of data is integrated into a single data platform), and objective presentation (data is managed in an abstract data model specifically suited for querying and reporting). \nLet me paraphrase. By systematizing data preparation, organizations arguably do two things. First, they minimize the risk of the rogue employee going off the reservation. Second and on a related note, they curtail the risk of uninformed – if well-intentioned – employees making mistakes. In my consulting career, I've seen a few employees run massive purge programs in production only to find out that those programs do indeed work. Ending the blame game \nTo be fair, these risks aren't insignificant – but let's not overlook the costs of cementing IT's central involvement in all data preparation efforts. For one, it reinforces the toxic IT-business divide . Beyond that, it frustrates employees and costs the organization invaluable time to capitalize on time-sensitive promotions, opportunities and specials. \nEmployees with unfettered and direct access to sensitive production data? Insane, right? Perhaps, but make no mistake: This type of access promotes individual employee responsibility. That is, no longer can employees use IT as the organization's whipping boy when data issues manifest themselves. And, all else being equal, better data means better and more meaningful analytics . Simon says: Embrace self-service. \nDon't treat data self-service as a binary: all or nothing. Rather, why not experiment with limited self-service over the course of several months? Why not try an agile approach? Maybe the concerns mentioned here are well founded, not overblown. Maybe an organization's culture mitigates these risks. Feedback",

      "text": " 00 AM EST Amazon Selects Teams to Participate in the Inaugural Alexa Prize Competition (NASDAQ: AMZN)—Today, Amazon announced the sponsorship of 12 teams to participate in the Alexa Prize, an annual university competition dedicated to accelerating the field of conversational artificial intelligence (AI). \n( NASDAQ: AMZN )—Today, Amazon announced the sponsorship of 12 teams to participate in the Alexa Prize, an annual university competition dedicated to accelerating the field of conversational artificial intelligence (AI). \n“The response to the Alexa Prize challenge has been incredibly positive. With applications from over 100 incredibly well-qualified teams from 22 countries, we were unable to pick just 10 to sponsor,” said Rohit Prasad, Vice President and Head Scientist, Amazon Alexa. “We are eager to see what students from the 12 sponsored teams around the world—including one team of undergrads—create with Alexa.” \nMore than one hundred teams from leading universities across 22 countries applied to participate in the Alexa Prize competition. The selected teams are: Carnegie-Mellon University —Pittsburgh, PA, USA; Team Name: CMU Magnus Carnegie-Mellon University —Pittsburgh, PA, USA; Team Name: TBD Czech Technical University in Prague —Prague, Czech Republic; Team Name: eClub Heriot-Watt University —Edinburgh, Scotland, UK; Team Name: WattSocialBot Princeton University —Princeton, NJ, USA; Team Name: Princeton Alexa Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute —Troy, NY, USA; Team Name: BAKAbot University of California, Berkeley —Berkeley, CA, USA; Team Name: Machine Learning @ Berkeley University of California, Santa Cruz —Santa Cruz, CA, USA; Team Name: SlugBots University of Edinburgh —Edinburgh, Scotland, UK; Team Name: Edina University of Montreal —Montreal, Quebec, Canada; Team Name: MILA Team University of Trento —Trento, Italy; Team Name: Roving Minds University of Washington —Seattle, WA, USA; Team Name: HuskyBot \nThe goal of the inaugural competition is to have university teams build socialbots on Alexa that will converse with humans on popular topics and news events. The team with the highest-performing socialbot will win the $500,000 prize. Additionally, an award of $1 million will be granted to the winning team's school if their socialbot achieves the grand challenge of conversing coherently and engagingly for 20 minutes. In addition to receiving a $100,000 stipend for participating, the 12 teams selected for Amazon sponsorship will receive Alexa-enabled devices, free Amazon Web Services ( AWS ) cloud computing services, and support from the Amazon Alexa Skills Kit (ASK) team. Students will build their socialbots using ASK , which tens of thousands of developers are already using to build new skills on Alexa. \nBeginning in April 2017, as part of the research and judging process, millions of Alexa customers will have the opportunity to converse with the socialbots on popular topics. The feedback from Alexa users will be a factor in selecting the best socialbots to advance to the finals. The winning university team will be announced at AWS re:Invent in November 2017. \nFor Official Rules for the Alexa Prize please visit https://developer.amazon.com/alexaprize/contest-rules . \nAbout Amazon \nAmazon is guided by four principles: customer obsession rather than competitor focus, passion for invention, commitment to operational excellence, and long-term thinking.

      "text": "Coworking network Talent Garden lands €12M funding round for European expansion Posted Amazon’s Home Services adds 20 more metro regions as it preps new “Assistant” role \nThere are plenty of coworking spaces out there, but while the like of WeWork and TechHub focus on major capital cities, others have seen a fertile space emerge in developing economies. \nThus coworking network Talent Garden has landed a €12M funding round from investors including Endeavor Catalyst (supported by LinkedIn) and Italy’s largest investment bank, Tamburi Investment Partners. The funds will be used to expand into Europe, with the UK and the Republic of Ireland in the coworking network’s sights. Its expansion model focuses on ‘up-and-coming’ cities in North and Eastern Europe. \nFounded in Brescia – a small city in the North of Italy – Talent Garden has spread its network among a number of European cities in the last five years. \nIn reality that means it’s gone into a bunch of Italian cities which are cheap to operate in, as well as cities like Tirana, Albania and Bucharest, Romania. \nIt now has 17 coworking campuses, covering 1,500 digital professionals across five European countries (Italy, Spain, Albania, Romania and Lithuania) with new places opening in DACH area, France and more campuses in Spain. \nIt also runs a “TAG Innovation School” education programme which focuses on coding, UX, Ecommerce etc. \nTalent Garden CEO and founder Davide Dattoli has built the network by focusing not just on tech startups but on small businesses like designers and marketing companies. \nHe says they focus on “tier 2 markets” so (not London and Berlin) and creatives as well as freelance and corporates. 0",

      "text": "You are using an outdated browser. Please upgrade your browser to improve your experience. Amazon Music Unlimited Expands to Austria, Germany and UK The Apple Music competitor has begun its international rollout November 14, 2016 \nAmazon has started the international expansion of its premium music streaming service. \nAbout a month ago, the retail giant launched Amazon Music Unlimited — its answer to the likes of Apple Music, Google Play Music, and Spotify — initially in the U.S. Now, the service has made its way across the Atlantic: Today sees the debut of Amazon Music Unlimited in Austria, Germany , and the U.K. On-demand ad-free streaming On-demand ad-free streaming \nAs in the U.S., Amazon Music Unlimited offers in its new markets on-demand ad-free playback of “tens of millions” of songs from major and independent labels for a monthly subscription fee. It also features unlimited skips and downloading of tracks for offline listening along with hand-curated and algorithm-generated recommendations and playlists. Echo integration Echo integration \nThose are pretty much what you’d also find in competing services. But Amazon Music Unlimited does set its feature apart from that of the competition with the inclusion of tight integration with Echo , Amazon’s smart speaker that features Amazon’s intelligent personal assistant, Alexa. \nWhen used with an Echo, the service lets users control music playback and streaming with voice commands similar to those used with Siri for Apple Music , like “Alexa, play a song by Adele,” “Alexa, play the new album by Kishi Bashi,” or “Alexa, play Bruce Springsteen songs from the 70s.” To be sure, Echo also offers access to other streaming services, including Spotify, iHeartRadio, Pandora, and TuneIn Radio, but its more advanced features, like searching songs by lyrics, work only with Amazon Music Unlimited. Competitive pricing Competitive pricing \nAmazon Music Unlimited also has a lot going for it in terms of competitive pricing, particularly benefiting users of Amazon’s speakers and members of Amazon Prime. \nThe service is available on three plans: Echo, Individual, and Family. Echo may be used on a single Amazon Echo, Echo Dot or Tap speaker; Individual supports one account on all compatible devices; and Family provides the features of Individual to up to six users. \nAs in the U.S., Amazon Music Unlimited in Austria, Germany, and the U.K. offers discounts to subscribers under the Echo Plan and to Prime members opting for the Individual plan. As you can notice from the matrices below, the values are the same across all countries, and you need only affix the appropriate currency for a particular country. U.S.",

      "text": "[[ \"tip\" + \"s\" | replace:{subString: 'post', newSubString: 'deal'} ]] Top 12 Amazon Prime Tools to Use This Christmas November 13, 2016 Twitter Email \nHoliday shopping on Amazon is kinda a big deal. According to digital magazine ARC , 94% of people plan to shop on Amazon during the holiday season. That’s huge, people! With most of us shopping through Amazon, it’s only right that we dig up all the best Prime tools for you to use. \nHere are 12 of the best ways to take advantage of Amazon Prime this holiday season. \nVia Digital Trends \nTake advantage of Amazon Prime’s free 30-day trial while Christmas shopping. Its free 2-day shipping is perfect for sending gifts to out-of-town family members and friends. Plus, the money you save in delivery costs alone will make your holidays brighter. Once the trial period ends, it’s $99 per year. \nVia Android Central \nAccess Prime Photo, Amazon’s free unlimited photo storage from anywhere and from any device just by signing in to your Amazon Prime account. While it’s free to Prime members, non-members must pay $12 a year. But lucky for you and your top five loved ones, you can share Prime Photo for free. That way, you and five others can upload, share, and store the best photos of the season in Amazon’s Cloud Drive. \nDownload the Prime Photos app on your Android or iPhone , and rest assured knowing your precious snapshots are safe–even after you delete them from your phone. \nBONUS: Use Prime Photo to create holiday and greeting cards right from your albums. And get this: delivery is also free! \nVia Mirror \nStress no more. Amazon has consolidated, organized, and tailored a list of the top toys for the 2016 Christmas season . The list is even categorized into age blocks from birth to 12 and up. Filter your options even further by selected parent favorites, kids’ picks, or something the whole family can enjoy. \nThere’s even a Deals section that will let you know what toys are about to go on sale to help you save even more. \nVia Tech Advisor The gamer in your life will love getting that new release as a holiday gift, while you’ll love saving 20% on the price with your Prime account . Here’s how it works: order new games when they’re in the pre-order stage or within the first two weeks of release. That’s it; it’s that easy to get the latest games at a great price. For example, order Pokemon Moon – Nintendo 3DS Moon Edition , which is normally priced at $39.96. With your Amazon Prime membership you get it for $31.99 with free shipping. BONUS: Amazon Prime memberships now come with Twitch Prime , which includes free games, exclusive in-game content, and a free channel subscription every 30 days. This all means you won’t need to pay for the ad-free Twitch Turbo. All you do is link your account, and you’re ready to go–for free. \n\n4. Read free Christmas stories with Prime Reading. \nAmazon Prime Reading is a new feature that gives members access to unlimited books, audiobooks, and magazines with no due date. \nNeed a little holiday-home-decor inspiration? Check out your new free subscription to Better Homes and Gardens. Your kids are going to love the free access to hundreds of books like Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone and Sneezy the Snowman . \nAnd since Amazon has free Prime Reading apps for iOS and Android , you don’t need a Kindle to access over 1,000 titles. 5. Get a head start on the biggest discounts with Lightning Deals. Via Business Wire \nBeat other shoppers by taking advantage of your Prime membership and getting a 30-minute lead with Lightning Deals . \nAmazon features popular toys, electronics, games, and more for a fraction of the original price with Lightning Deals, but you’ll want to get on these deals fast, because they go as quickly as they come. \nWhen all the promotional discounts on a Lightning Deal are claimed by other shoppers, you’ll see a “Join waitlist” button. Click it to place yourself on the waitlist. When the promotional discount becomes available again, you’ll see an alert in the upper right-hand corner of your Amazon.com page. \nVia Business Wire \nAmazon Prime Now operates in 27 cities and is only available to Prime members. With it, you get free 2-hour delivery on grocery and non-grocery items (1-hour delivery is also available for $7.99). If you live in one of these cities , this is a great option when you’re under the gun and need to get that holiday gift out fast. See why I’m a fan in Amazon Prime Now: Get Free 2-Hour Delivery on Pretty Much Anything . \nTIP : If you need food delivered in a hurry for any of your holiday gatherings, Amazon Prime Now also delivers ready-made food from select restaurants right to your door in an hour.",

      "text": "New Study Identifies Keys to Success on Amazon for Retailers New Research Shows the Factors Consumers Consider When Choosing a Retailer on Amazon. President, Web Marketing Pros @ webmarketing007   \nIn the ever-growing sea of online retailers, many business owners have tried to make it easier to attract customers by setting up shop with online platforms like Amazon. Rather than build an e-commerce website and establish an online presence, Amazon retailers can skip these steps and piggyback on the name recognition and trust of Amazon. \nHowever, as more and more retailers turn to Amazon and similar online platforms, It becomes increasingly harder to stand out. A recently released study provides helpful data that can help business owners become more successful on Amazon and similar online selling platforms. \nOne of the most important questions for retailers on platforms with high amounts of competition is: \"What makes shoppers choose one vendor over another?\" There are, of course, obvious considerations like price. But on sites like Amazon or eBay, there are often many retailers with similar prices. Feedvisor recently a study which identifies factors consumers use to determine which Amazon seller they will use buy from. \nAccording to Feedvisor's new Amazon User Study 2016 , ratings are they key. From product rating to seller ratings, these scores play a huge role in determining which sellers consumers trust. The study found that nearly nine out of 10 (87 percent) shoppers on Amazon 'always/sometimes' check seller ratings before buying. \nThe rating of the product is even more important. With so many sellers with poorly made or knock-off merchandise on the web, it's important for consumers to feel secure that the items they buy will meet their expectations. According to the study, also found that most (92 percent) won't make a purchase for a product with fewer than 3 stars. \n\"Amazon users are savvy shoppers and they have high expectations of their eCommerce experiences,\" said Ohad Hagai, VP Marketing of Feedvisor, according to media reports . \"It's no longer enough for Amazon sellers to post their items on the marketplace and expect to make a sale. Since the vast majority of customers prefer free and quick shipping through Amazon, sellers might wish to consider Fulfillment By Amazon as a means to accelerating their sales.\" \nAs has been discussed multiple times in the past, shipping matters to online consumers and this applies to platforms like Amazon. According to Feedvisor's report, 85 percent of those surveyed saying they won't buy products that also include shipping costs. This goes back to the point that even if the cost of \"Free Shipping\" is just shifted into the price of the product, it serves the retailer better than having an artificially low price with a high shipping cost. \nThough this study specifically focused on data from Amazon, the insights of the report can be easily applied to other online selling platforms like eBay, Walmart, and Google. If this data proves anything, it's that consumers don't modify their behavior and put on blinders when they use services like Amazon. \nOnline shoppers are still paying attention to things like seller reputation, product reviews and shipping costs. Given their importance to consumers, business owners and retailers need to take care to improve these items in their online offerings. \nFor more information on how to become a better online retailer, read this article on metrics business owners can use to judge the effectiveness of their online marketing efforts.

Amazon expands its Home services 0 Share: Enlarge Image Photo by Jaap Arriens/NurPhoto via Getty Images \nAmazon will provide more customers with pros to install and assemble the things they buy from the online retailer. The company announced today that it will expand Amazon Home Services to 20 metropolitan areas, including Indianapolis, Las Vegas and San Antonio. \nAmazon created Home Services in 2015. Here's how it works: Service providers in participating areas opt-in to be included in Home Services. Then, if you order something that needs to be installed or assembled, you can order that service as part of your order. This is now available in more than 50 metropolitan areas. \nHere are the new cities in which Home Services is now available: Santa Rosa, Calif.",

      "title": "Why Amazon Is Cutting Wrapping Paper This Holiday Season",
      "text": "When Amazon amzn ships millions of gifts to customer doorsteps this holiday season, one thing will be noticeably missing from the majority of the brown cardboard boxes emblazoned with its logo: wrapping paper.\nFor the first time, the e-commerce juggernaut--which saw last year's holiday-quarter sales increase 22%, to $35.7 billion--is ditching its customary blue-and-gold wrapping paper in the U.S., Mexico, and Canada. Instead, Amazon will offer velvet gift bags in five sizes and three colors (red, silver, and blue) to fit presents of different shapes and sizes, ranging from a palm-size BB-8 droid replica from Star Wars to a DJI Phantom Drone. Pricing for the velvet bags will range from $3.49 to $5.99--the same as what gift wrap cost previously.\nAmazon’s velvet gift bags come in five sizes and three colors to fit presents of different shapes and sizes, offering a more environmentally-conscious option to traditional gift wrap. Photo: Courtesy of Amazon \"Our guiding North Star is the minimization of packaging,\" says Kara Hurst, Amazon's director of worldwide sustainability and social responsibility. \"Wrapping paper has no value.\"\nHurst joined Amazon two years ago in her current role, which was new for the 22-year-old company. Her mission: to help Amazon become more environmentally conscious as it looks to scale a multibillion-dollar e-commerce business as Walmart wmt and Target tgt try to threaten its lead. A big part of her job, Hurst explains, is determining how to streamline the packaging of millions of goods shipped each year.\nIn a small laboratory in Seattle, Hurst has a team tasked solely with brainstorming strategies to improve Amazon's packaging. She is more acutely focused on Amazon's 123 fulfillment centers worldwide--massive warehouses in which a mix of robots, industrial machines, and humans package and sort orders.\nThis holiday season robots will be working full-time as Amazon doubles down on deploying \"frustration-free packaging,\" explains Hurst. This type of packaging debuted in 2008, using recyclable cardboard while excluding excess materials, such as extra internal boxes and the plastic casings found around batteries. All box forms can be opened by hand without a box cutter. This year, Amazon says, more than 1 million items will be shipped with frustration-free packaging, instead of hundreds of thousands in years past.\nAn example of Amazon’s Frustration-Free Packaging. “The Love 2 Learn Elmo” doll, on left, uses recyclable cardboard--avoiding excess materials--and can be opened by hand without tools. The standard packaging, on right, uses more material and can be more difficult to open. Photo: Courtesy of Amazon But Amazon isn't turning to environmentally friendlier practices purely out of altruism. \"They can save money by reducing packaging costs and increase room on trucks for more sales by making -packages smaller,\" says Colin Sebastian, a senior equity research analyst with Robert W. Baird.\nWhile Hurst declined to place a number on the benefits of eliminating wrapping paper and superfluous boxes, she confirms that there is a \"definite cost savings for the company.\"\nSebastian concurs: \"This is classic Amazon.\"\nA version of this article appears in the December 1, 2016 issue of Fortune with the headline “Out of the Box.” ",

Kong recommends a 9mm diameter rope. I realize not everyone is into this sort of method and will continue to use the rope or slings and other means to safely secure themselves to the anchor or extend their rappel.

      "text": "Portfolio Armor Summary \nAs FANG tech stocks have slid in the wake of Trump's election win, various theories relating to Trump's proposed policies have been offered. \nThe Financial Times mentioned at least three: Trump tariffs threatening tech supply chains, tighter immigration affecting H-1B visas, and antitrust scrutiny. \nWe suspect antitrust is the biggest concern here and note the campaign context. We also update the reaction of one of our pre-election Amazon hedges to the stock's drop. Click to enlarge Post-Election Teething Pains For FANGs The Financial Times offered at least three different explanations for the slide in FANG stocks over the weekend. The caption under a chart of Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) on the front page cited \"fears trade wars could hit supply chains\". Elsewhere, the paper cited immigration : The paper's senior investment commentator, John Authers, was perhaps closer to the truth when he mentioned the potential impact of a Trump administration focus on antitrust in his Long View column (paywalled): \nDoes Mr. Trump mean what he has said on the campaign trail about breaking up oligopolies, and does he follow through when he bears a grudge? Attacking trusts and monopolies like a latter-day Teddy Roosevelt has great appeal. Nowhere is power more concentrated than in Silicon Valley. \nHence the stocks that roared ahead last year, and came to be known as the Fangs (Facebook [(NASDAQ: FB )], Amazon, Netflix [(NASDAQ: NFLX )] and Google [( GOOG , GOOGL ]), all fell preciptiously. It's worth noting here that at least three of the FANGs had some connection to the election campaign. Amazon got in Donald Trump's crosshairs last February, based on Amazon chief Jeff Bezos's ownership of the Washington Post , which tended to be critical of candidate Trump. In July ( Will Facebook Stop Trump ?) we speculated that Facebook might attempt to influence the election against Trump. Since then, Facebook has come under heat from both ends of the political spectrum for the way it handles its news feed. And as we noted the week before the election ( Google: Oh Schmidt! ), Wikileaks had reported Alphabet/Google's executive chairman Eric Schmidt's offer of extensive help to the Clinton campaign. So keep that political subtext in mind. Of the various explanations offered for the tech stocks' slide, antitrust concern seems the most accute because it could have the biggest impact. A crackdown on H1-B visas might force tech companies to pay slightly higher wages in the U.S. (or to employ more workers overseas), but an antitrust prosecution could lead to a wide-ranging settlement or even to a break up the companies themselves. An Update On Hedging Amazon Although we wrote about Trump's threat against Amazon in February, we didn't have it in mind last month when posted an updated hedge for the stock ( Hedging Amazon ). The nice thing about hedging a stock directly though is that the hedge can offer protection regardless of what causes the stock to drop. Since our October post, Amazon has dropped about 11.5%. We'll recap the AMZN hedge we presented in that article last month and show how it has reacted to the drop below. Then we'll consider current courses of action. The October 25th Optimal Collar Hedge: For our hedge, we assumed our hypothetical investor was willing to tolerate a drawdown of 15% but no more than that. We capped possible upside at 12%, which was higher than the potential return implied by Wall Street's 12-month price target for the stock and lower than the potential return calculated by the Portfolio Armor website at the time. As of October 25th's close, this was the optimal collar to hedge 200 shares of AMZN against a greater than 15% drop by late April while not capping an investor's upside at less than 12% by the end of that time period (screen captures via the Portfolio Armor iOS app ). As you can see at the bottom of the screen capture above, the cost was negative, meaning an investor would have collected about $410 when opening this hedge. Let's see where you'd be had you hedged then and held through Wednesday's drop. How The October 25th Collar Responded To AMZN's Drop Here's an updated quote on the put leg as of Friday's close: And here is an updated quote on the call leg: How That Hedge Ameliorated AMZN's Drop AMZN closed at $835.18 on Tuesday, October 25th. A shareholder who owned 200 shares of it and hedged with the collar above then had $167,036 in AMZN shares plus $5,130 in puts, and if he wanted to buy-to-close his short call leg, he would have needed to pay $5,540 to do that. So, his net position value on October 25th was ($167,036 + $5,130) - $5,540 = $166,626. AMZN closed at $739.01 on Friday, November 11th, down 11.5% from its closing price on October 25th. The investor's shares were worth $147,802 as of 11/11, his put options were worth $8,505, and if he wanted to close out the short call leg of his collar, it would have cost him $1,230, using the midpoint of the spread, in both cases. So: ($147,802 + $8,505) - $1,230 = $155,077. $155,077 represents a 6.9% drop from $166,626. More Protection Than Promised Remember, this hedge was designed to protect against drops greater than 15%, not drops smaller than that, like the 11.5% drop the stock has seen so far. But at the time of the calculations above, the investor was only down less than 7% on his combined net hedge + underlying stock position by this point. As with Chipotle's (NYSE: CMG ) gristly correction , this illustrates the impact of time value on a hedge designed to protect based on its intrinsic value alone. What Now? Portfolio Armor remains bullish on Amazon, albeit not as bullish as it was last month, and we remain bullish on it too. Jeff Bezos seems to be too savvy an entrepreneur to let politics derail his business. It's hard to see him letting The Washington Post act as a sea anchor on Amazon. We would expect the paper's editors to use Trump's recent post-election concilatory tone as an opportunity to perhaps reassess their approach to him. But of course we could be wrong, so if you're hedged as above, consider holding on to the put leg at least. You might consider buying-to-close the call leg if it gets cheaper, to eliminate your upside cap.

      "text": "As I pull my phone from my pocket and start snapping pictures, I feel like a private eye, or even a secret agent. I’ve just walked into Amazon Books, the Web giant’s flagship bookstore in Seattle, but my intentions have little to do with shopping. I’m on a reconnaissance mission.\nLike many authors, I have a love-hate relationship with Amazon. The love is transactional. Amazon sells about a third of all printed books purchased in the country, and some two-thirds of all e-books. The hate is a form of mistrust. The company’s size gives it immense power, and it has at times acted like a predator, trying to dictate the terms of bookselling while showing contempt for the traditions of publishing. I’m not entirely sure whether Amazon wants to be my benefactor or my undertaker.\nSo here I am, behind frenemy lines, taking photographs of shelving.\nBezos may love books, but what he loves even more is the idea of total victory, with no survivors among the vanquished.\nAfter a half-dozen shots, I stow the phone and approach one of the four clerks in the store, a solicitous young man with a slightly antsy demeanor. He smiles when I ask why the leviathan of virtual retailing would bother opening a store in the real world. “We’ve accumulated 20 years of data on bookselling,” he replies, then adds, “And Jeff Bezos really, really loves books.” I sense he’s said these things before. I inquire about the store’s design, and he explains that it was modeled on the Amazon site. All the books are displayed with their covers facing outward, a visual echo of the thumbnail images that crowd the Web store. Beneath each volume is a small placard that displays the book’s Amazon star rating—only books that have earned at least four stars from Web buyers are stocked—and that also includes a brief excerpt from a customer review. One of the store’s displays offers “If you like this, you’ll love this” suggestions, a play on Amazon’s recommendation engine, while another promotes new books that racked up a lot of pre-orders online.\nI wander to the center of the store, between the fiction and the nonfiction sections, and find a series of low tables displaying, in Apple Store fashion, samples of various gadgets that Amazon sells under its own brand. There’s the Kindle Paperwhite e-reader, the Fire HD tablet, and the Echo voice-activated virtual assistant, along with a selection of headphones, wireless speakers, and other accessories. At the head of the hardware aisle, facing the shop’s entrance, is a big television running Fire TV, Amazon’s set-top streaming box. A little boy is sitting on a bench in front of the screen, engrossed in the video game Crossy Road.\nWhat’s Amazon doing with Amazon Books? That question has hung in the air ever since the Seattle store opened in November 2015. Speculation about the company’s motives intensified during 2016 when it opened two more bookstores, in San Diego and Portland, Oregon, and divulged plans for more in Chicago and suburban Boston. Since Amazon has said little about its strategy (it ignored my requests for comment), Wall Street analysts and tech writers have filled the void with conjecture. The stores are all about selling gadgets, goes one popular idea, with the books there just to lure customers. The stores are data-gathering machines, goes another, enabling Amazon to extend its tracking of customers into the physical world. Or maybe the company’s secret plan is to use the stores to promote its cloud computing operation, Amazon Web Services, to other retailers.\nThe theories are intriguing, and they may contain bits of truth. But the real impetus behind the stores is probably much simpler: Amazon wants to sell more books.\nNot long ago, the common wisdom held that Amazon would remake the book business in its own image. Its Web store would kill off bookstores, and its Kindle would render physical books obsolete. In an interview in 2009, 18 months after the Kindle’s launch, Jeff Bezos suggested that the “great 500-year run” of the printed book was coming to an end. “It’s time to change,” he declared. Readers had a different idea. After an initial boom, sales of digital books went flat and then started to fall—in the mainstream trade-book market, e-book revenues dropped 11 percent in 2015 alone, according to the Association of American Publishers—while sales of printed books, far from collapsing, held steady. Bookstores, too, have been making a comeback, led by small, independent shops. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, sales in bookstores grew 2.5 percent in 2015, the first uptick since 2007, and the growth rate strengthened to 6.1 percent during the first half of 2016. The number of newly opened bookshops has also been on the rise.\n“Pure-play Web retailing is not sustainable.”\nBezos underestimated the allure of bricks and paper. With his bookstore chain, he now seems to be admitting that if Amazon is to expand its share of the book market, it will need to invest in bricks as well as bits. Beyond the business rationale, it’s hard not to see a certain vindictiveness to Amazon’s move. Having come up short in its plan to supplant books and bookstores with digital alternatives, the company is taking its revenge by attacking traditional bookshops on their own turf. Unlike the mom-and-pop independents, or even the struggling Barnes & Noble chain, Amazon has the scale and the cash required to wage a war of attrition. It can sustain losses on its stores for a long time. Bezos may love books, but what he loves even more is the idea of total victory, with no survivors among the vanquished.\nThe limits of online retail\nAmazon Books may be just the vanguard of a much broader push into brick-and-mortar retailing by the company. In October, the Wall Street Journal revealed that Amazon is planning to open a chain of convenience stores, mainly for groceries, along with drive-in depots where consumers will be able to pick up merchandise ordered online. It has also begun rolling out small “pop-up” stores to hawk its electronic devices. It already has more than two dozen such kiosks in malls around the country, and dozens more are said to be in the works.\nEven after 20 years of rapid growth, e-commerce still accounts for less than 10 percent of total retail sales . And now the rise of mobile computing places new constraints on Web stores. They can’t display or promote as many products as they could when their wares were spread across desktop or laptop monitors. That limits the stores’ cross-selling and upselling opportunities and blunts other merchandising tactics.\nAt the same time, the smartphone, with its apps, its messaging platforms, and its constant connectivity, gives retailers more ways to communicate with and influence customers, even when they’re shopping in stores. This is why the big trend in retailing today is toward “omnichannel” strategies, which blend physical stores, Web stores, and mobile apps in a way that makes the most of the convenience of smartphones and overcomes their limitations. Some omnichannel pioneers, like Sephora and Nordstrom, come from the brick-and-mortar world. But others, like Warby Parker and Bonobos, come from the Web world. Now, with its physical stores, Amazon is following in their tracks. “Pure-play Web retailing is not sustainable,” New York University marketing professor Scott Galloway told me. He points out that the deep discounting and high delivery costs that characterize Web sales have made it hard for Amazon to turn a profit. If Amazon were to remain an online-only merchant, he says, its future success would be in jeopardy. He believes the company will end up opening “hundreds and then thousands of stores.”\nBeyond its expertise in Web sales, Amazon brings distinctive strengths to an omnichannel operation. Its vast, efficient network of warehouses and distribution centers can supply outlets and process returns. It has, thanks to the largesse and patience of its investors, a reservoir of cheap capital that it can draw on to fund a building spree. And it has a much-admired brand. What Amazon lacks is experience in the touchy-feely world of traditional retailing. The company’s proficiency in software and data crunching is unquestioned. Its people skills are another matter.\nVariable prices\nThe Seattle store sits between a Tommy Bahama and a tanning salon at the southwest corner of the upscale, open-air University Village mall. The exterior is clad in brick, with black-metal moldings around the windows. The floor is hardwood—handsome, tea-colored planks. The shelves and tables are built of thick, grainy boards. Even the big TV monitor up front is encased in a wooden frame. The lighting is bright, the signage crisp. Neither cozy nor trendy, neither retro nor modern, the space is pleasant without being distinctive. It suits the mall setting.\nAs I walk around, I overhear another clerk tell a customer that Amazon Books is “all about browsing.” But that’s not the way it feels to me. The narrow aisles and the head-high shelves, with all those outward-facing covers, produce a mild claustrophobia that discourages leisurely shopping. And the relatively small selection of high-ranking books, all arrayed in uniform rows, sends a message of fungibility. Every choice seems equally safe, a data-sanctioned “good read.” (The four-star cutoff tends to filter out the controversial and the experimental.) Despite a few armchairs and a long bench along one wall, the shop has a grab-and-go vibe, not much different from that of an airport bookstore.\nThe most distinctive feature of Amazon Books lies not in its design or its merchandising or even its technology—the tech seems about on par with what you’d find at a Starbucks—but in its approach to pricing. There are no price tags on the books, and what customers pay depends on whether or not they’re enrolled in the Amazon Prime loyalty program. Those without a Prime membership pay the list price. Those with Prime pay Amazon’s discounted online price. To find out what that price is at the moment, you have to carry a book to one of several bar-code-scanning stations set up around the store. Scan the code on the back cover, and the price is revealed on a screen. (As an alternative, you can scan a code on the book’s shelf placard with an Amazon app on your phone; that brings up the book’s page, with its current price, on the Amazon site.) The process is cumbersome, but it hints at what is probably another of the store’s goals: to promote the Prime program, which is central to Amazon’s strategy of locking in customers.\nHaving spent nearly an hour in amateur black-ops mode, taking photos and scribbling notes, I sense that the clerks are eyeing me with suspicion. Not wanting to blow my cover, I decide I should buy something and leave. I grab a copy of Joan Didion’s Slouching Towards Bethlehem (4.3 stars) and take it to a small checkout area tucked away near the cookbook section. A sign in front of the registers informs me that I have the option of paying with my phone, but that would require launching an app, scanning yet another code, and then handing the phone to the checkout clerk. It seems simpler to swipe a credit card. Not being a Prime member, I pay full retail: 15 bucks, plus tax.\nOutside, it has started to rain. I summon an Uber and sit in the back as the driver follows the route on his smartphone over the Montlake Bridge and through the city to the Courtyard by Marriott where I’m staying. Going up to my room holds little appeal, so I head into the lounge, order a vodka, and flip through my e-mails. Over the bar are three TVs, each tuned to a different ball game. I feel let down. I had convinced myself that I was going to witness something fresh and unexpected at Amazon Books. What I found was an annex to a website—a store that, despite the bricks and paper, retains the coldness of the virtual.\nNicholas Carr is the author, most recently, of the essay collection Utopia Is Creepy.",

      "text": "Workers come and go at Amazon’s campus in Seattle. (GeekWire File Photo.) Amazon will significantly change how it assesses the performance of its employees each year — shaking up a controversial tradition that has emerged as an emblem of the technology giant’s exacting standards and hard-charging workplace.\nAmazon’s longstanding review process reflects CEO Jeff Bezos’ lofty standards for hiring and promotion. (GeekWire File Photo) “We’re launching a new annual review process next year that is radically simplified and focuses on our employees’ strengths, not the absence of weaknesses,” the company confirmed in a statement to GeekWire. “We will continue to iterate and build on the program based on what we learn from our employees.”\nThe buzz among employees is that Amazon will drop or significantly alter its existing employee ratings program as part of the changes in the broader review process. Amazon currently uses employee ratings as the basis for a forced curve or “stack-rank” system — also known as “rank-and-yank” — a controversial management technique used by companies to get rid of the lowest-performing employees and identify those with the most growth potential.\nBut the extent to which Amazon will replace or modify its current system isn’t yet clear. The company declined to confirm any details beyond its statement. The new approach is expected to start in February of next year.\nThe current approach has drawn external criticism and internal complaints. A widely-read New York Times story about the company’s “bruising workplace” last year spotlighted the current employee review process. “Preparing is like getting ready for a court case, many supervisors say: To avoid losing good members of their teams — which could spell doom — they must come armed with paper trails to defend the wrongfully accused and incriminate members of competing groups. Or they adopt a strategy of choosing sacrificial lambs to protect more essential players,” the New York Times reported.\nIt’s known internally as the “Organization and Leadership Review,” or OLR. CNN last year quoted an HR expert who compared it to The Hunger Games. \nAmazon disputed many elements of the NYT story , but it’s clear that the current review process is not a popular tradition inside the company. Managers and their direct reports can spend a staggering amount of time working on annual reviews, especially when someone is angling for a promotion, according to current and former employees.\nThe company’s traditional performance review process is a reflection of Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos’ exacting standards for the company, wrote journalist Brad Stone, author of The Everything Store: Jeff Bezos and the Age of Amazon , in a piece in Bloomberg Businessweek two years ago. Bezos “seems to believe his managers must raise the performance bar with every hire and promotion and that only exceptional talent should progress within the organization,” wrote Stone.\nAmazon’s challenge will be maintaining those standards while also streamlining and improving the review process.\nThe shift to a simplified review process is the latest in a series of moves by Amazon to create a more accommodating workplace. Last fall, the company expanded its parental leave benefits , which had been another target of criticism at the company. This summer, Amazon began testing a new program that creates technical teams consisting entirely of part-time employees who are still eligible for the same benefits as Amazon’s full-time employees.\nGeekWire Graphic. Source: Microsoft, Amazon and Google earnings. These changes come amid an unprecedented wave of growth at the company. Amazon’s worldwide employment recently topped 300,000 employees for the first time , up more than six-fold over five years, fueled by a massive expansion of its warehouse and distribution network.\nBut it’s not just warehouse workers. The company now reports 35,000 employees in Washington state, home to its Seattle headquarters. That’s up from about 25,000 employees in Washington state a year ago. Amazon last week opened another huge office tower on its new campus on the northern edge of downtown Seattle.\nThe stack-rank approach, aggressively managing people out of the company, can become daunting with such a large workforce and big growth ambitions. Amazon is also competing for talent against other tech giants that have already shifted away from performance review systems based on ratings and stack ranking.\nAmazon’s fellow Seattle-area tech giant Microsoft, for example, used the stack-rank practice for many years, rating employees on a fixed curve, which had the effect of giving a lower standing and compensation to some employees even in cases where their managers might have felt they deserved more.\nIn 2013, Microsoft replaced the process with a new system that lets managers hand out raises and bonuses as they see fit, within the limits of their overall budget for compensation. The company said that the prior system was designed for an era when Microsoft was focused on employees as individual performers within a vertical corporate structure. Some blamed stack ranking for fostering dysfunction at Microsoft and reducing morale among employees.",

      "text": "  8:14am CST | by Luigi Lugmayr , in News | Technology News Credit: Amazon The Alexa Prize is an annual competition for university students dedicated to accelerating the field of conversational AI. \nToday, Amazon announced the sponsorship of 12 teams to participate in the Alexa Prize, an annual university competition dedicated to accelerating the field of conversational artificial intelligence (AI). Don't Miss: Sam's Club Black Friday 2016 Deals \nThe Amazon Alexa Prize attracted students from the major US Universities including Berkeley, Princeton and Carnegie-Mellon. Of the 12 teams invited 7 are from the United States. \n“The response to the Alexa Prize challenge has been incredibly positive. With applications from over 100 incredibly well-qualified teams from 22 countries, we were unable to pick just 10 to sponsor,” said Rohit Prasad, Vice President and Head Scientist, Amazon Alexa. “We are eager to see what students from the 12 sponsored teams around the world—including one team of undergrads—create with Alexa.” \nThe goal of the inaugural competition is to have university teams build socialbots on Alexa that will converse with humans on popular topics and news events. The team with the highest-performing socialbot will win the $500,000 prize. \nAdditionally, an award of $1 million will be granted to the winning team's school if their socialbot achieves the grand challenge of conversing coherently and engagingly for 20 minutes. \nIn addition to receiving a $100,000 stipend for participating, the 12 teams selected for Amazon sponsorship will receive Alexa-enabled devices, free Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud computing services, and support from the Amazon Alexa Skills Kit (ASK) team. Students will build their socialbots using ASK, which tens of thousands of developers are already using to build new skills on Alexa. \nMore than one hundred teams from leading universities across 22 countries applied to participate in the Alexa Prize competition. The selected teams are: \nCarnegie-Mellon University—Pittsburgh, PA, USA; Team Name: CMU Magnus \nCarnegie-Mellon University—Pittsburgh, PA, USA; Team Name: TBD \nCzech Technical University in Prague—Prague, Czech Republic; Team Name: eClub \nHeriot-Watt University—Edinburgh, Scotland, UK; Team Name: WattSocialBot \nPrinceton University—Princeton, NJ, USA; Team Name: Princeton Alexa \nRensselaer Polytechnic Institute—Troy, NY, USA; Team Name: BAKAbot \nUniversity of California, Berkeley—Berkeley, CA, USA; Team Name: Machine Learning @ Berkeley \nUniversity of California, Santa Cruz—Santa Cruz, CA, USA; Team Name: SlugBots \nUniversity of Edinburgh—Edinburgh, Scotland, UK; Team Name: Edina \nUniversity of Montreal—Montreal, Quebec, Canada; Team Name: MILA Team \nUniversity of Trento—Trento, Italy; Team Name: Roving Minds \nUniversity of Washington—Seattle, WA, USA; Team Name: HuskyBot \nBeginning in April 2017, as part of the research and judging process, millions of Alexa customers will have the opportunity to converse with the socialbots on popular topics. The feedback from Alexa users will be a factor in selecting the best socialbots to advance to the finals. The winning university team will be announced at AWS re:Invent in November 2017.

      "title": "12 college teams try to build convincingly conversant chatbots in quest for Amazon’s $2.7M Alexa Prize pool",
      "text": "The Alexa family. Amazon has revealed the 12 university teams that will compete for the inaugural Alexa Prize — which challenges students to build a “socialbot” that can have intelligent conversations through the company’s digital brain Alexa about pop culture and news events.\nThe 12 teams include Amazon’s hometown school, the University of Washington, as well as universities from across the U.S., Scotland, Canada, Italy and the Czech Republic. The prize pool totals up to $2.7 million, with the winning team receiving a $500,000 prize, and Amazon will give another $1 million to the winning team’s university if its bot can converse coherently for 20 minutes. Amazon is giving each of the 12 teams a $100,000 stipend, Alexa-enabled devices, free AWS services, and support from the Alexa team.\n“The response to the Alexa Prize challenge has been incredibly positive. With applications from over 100 incredibly well-qualified teams from 22 countries, we were unable to pick just 10 to sponsor,” Rohit Prasad, vice president and head scientist of Amazon’s Alexa division, said in a statement. “We are eager to see what students from the 12 sponsored teams around the world–including one team of undergrads–create with Alexa.”\nHere are the 12 teams, some of which hail from the same university, competing for the prize:\nCzech Technical University in Prague : Prague, Czech Republic. Team Name: eClub Heriot-Watt University : Edinburgh, Scotland. Team Name: WattSocialBot University of Edinburgh : Edinburgh, Scotland. Team Name: Edina University of Montreal : Montreal, Quebec, Canada. Team Name: MILA Team University of Trento : Trento, Italy. Team Name: Roving Minds Carnegie-Mellon University : Pittsburgh, Pa. Team Name: CMU Magnus Carnegie-Mellon University : Pittsburgh, Pa. Team Name: TBD Princeton University : Princeton, N.J. Team Name: Princeton Alexa Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute : Troy, N.Y. Team Name: BAKAbot University of California, Berkeley : Berkeley, Calif. Team Name: Machine Learning @ Berkeley University of California, Santa Cruz : Santa Cruz, Calif. Team Name: SlugBots University of Washington : Seattle. Team Name: HuskyBot The teams will now have until the end of March 2017 to put together their bots before the first round of feedback occurs. The winners will be announced about a year from now at AWS re:Invent in November 2017.\nUsing the Alexa Skills Kit , teams will have access to numerous content sources, including Washington Post, to build their bots’ knowledge base. Bots will be available for owners of Alexa-powered devices like the Echo and Echo Dot to try out. Users can say “Alexa, let’s chat about,” and then pick a topic like baseball, celebrity gossip or scientific breakthroughs. Feedback from Alexa customers will factor in to which teams make the finals of the competition.\nThe competition is another example of Amazon crowdsourcing artificial intelligence on Alexa. She currently has more than 3,000 skills . Last year Amazon opened up Alexa to developers , and the company said tens of thousands of them are working on skills and projects for Alexa. Developers who want to add to Alexa’s abilities can write code that works with Alexa in the cloud, letting the smart assistant do the heavy lifting of understanding and deciphering spoken commands.",

      "text": "Starting in January 2015 Amazon offered authors and publishers the opportunity to buy ads on its site . The feature was only open to authors with titles in KDP Select, but earlier this year Amazon made it available to all KDP users.\nSelf-Publisher-Bibel.de has noticed that Amazon has updated its KDP support pages with new instructions on how authors can advertise their ebooks on Amazon.com. The ebooks have to be available in KDP, they must be written in English, and the ebooks also have to meet Kindle Author Creative Acceptance Policies( PDF ).\nSo long as the ebooks meet the minimum requirement, authors can buy ads on other books listing pages, on the Kindle and Fire tabletes, and they also have the option to buy ads which infest Amazon's search results .\n\nThis service is apparently only available on Amazon.com at this time. Or rather, we have a report that it is not available through Amazon.de, and I could not find it on Amazon.co.uk.\nBut since there is no mention that this service is restricted to US authors, all authors should be able access it through their KDP.Amazon.com account.\nSelf-Publisher-Bibel.de \nYou just finished reading Amazon Allows Paid Advertising for eBooks in KDP – KDP Select No Longer Required which was published on The Digital Reader . If you liked what you read, how about joining the discussion? ",
