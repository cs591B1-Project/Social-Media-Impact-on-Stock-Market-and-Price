      "text": "Ford Debuts Its EcoSport SUV on Snapchat with DJ Khaled The tiny SUV makes a splashy entrance. Cars November 15, 2016 \nD J Khaled, reigning king of Snapchat, was perhaps the best person on the planet for automaker Ford to use to debut its EcoSport on Monday in Los Angeles. With Ryan Seacrest, of course. \n“Ryan, you gotta bear with me, I gotta type out my caption, so important,” the prolific DJ and pure ray of sunshine told Seacrest, focused on his phone in front of an audience of a few thousand who waited, patiently. When he finished, he launched into “All I Do Is Win,” his 2010 global hit. People used Snapchat to record the moment. \nThe Snapchat debut of the EcoSport (pronounced “echo,” short for ecosystem, or ecology), was, according to Ford, the first-ever reveal of a car on the platform. To remind people, Khaled — later joined by Fat Joe and Remy Ma — shouted out “EcoSport!” more than a dozen times from a stage set up off the intersection of Hollywood & Highland, while flanked by two of the cars on stage. \n“If you got the keys like I got the keys to this EcoSport, put your hands up!” \nThe Ford EcoSport — a popular compact SUV launched in 2003 but primarily sold in Europe — is now being marketed to millennials who would rather spend their money on Coachella or Comic-Con, and want the car to help them do that. \n“It’s knowing that in your life, you’re going to make trade-offs,” Cristina Aquino, a Ford marketing manger told Inverse about Ford’s intended customer, after Khaled’s set ended. “You’re going to make a decision to focus on spending on a vehicle that will help you have the capability to experience the life you want.” Seacrest uses the EcoSport as a drum. \nThat means a smaller, less expensive, and likely more fuel-efficient car. If that sounds great, the bad news is that the EcoSport doesn’t go on sale for more than a year, in early 2018. \n“It’s not unusual, but for us, it’s also strategically a great idea to spend some time building a relationship with the customers,” Aquino told Inverse when asked about the long run-up. \nFord has not announced a price range, but it’s expected to be slightly below that of Ford Escape, which starts at $23,000. Ford’s got competition. The small SUV class is quickly becoming very competitive and crowded. For instance, also at the LA Auto Show, Toyota will debut the CH-R, another subcompact SUV. \nThe EcoSport features a slew of futuristic features, including an eight-inch digital tablet that sort of floats on the center dash, and there’s a B&O Play sound system trumpeted by Ford, that includes ten speakers on the high-end. There are two USB ports. There are some 30 “storage solutions,” many in the form of little bins to keep your stuff, Karen Sullivan, another Ford marketing manager, told Inverse . The car has a roomy interior, and at first glance, the exterior gives off the vibe of a hollowed-out, candy-colored jelly bean. (It will come in ten colors.) We just revealed the all-new #Ford #EcoSport at #LAAutoShow . Keep up with our new SUV here: https://t.co/zN35xrZMq0 pic.twitter.com/EfWtBZ9PJX — Ford Motor Company (@Ford) November 15, 2016 \nSo, Ford clearly has high hopes for this new car. The event on Monday was the first night of a three-day music and lifestyle festival called “Go Small, Live Big.” It’s all built around marketing the EcoSport and its attached lifestyle. A parking lot behind the El Capitan Theatre was filled with beach umbrellas, stalls selling fried donuts and acai bowls, two model tiny homes , and zoo housed in a geodesic dome (featuring a meme-ready porcupine, rabbit, chinchilla, and owl). There was a screen printing station and sand was trucked-in for a beach scene. DJ Khaled \nSo yeah, the affair was expectedly splashy . And if anybody during the free concert forgot why it was happening, Khaled was there to remind them. \n“I think he said EcoSport about a million times, we should know how to pronounce it by now,” Sullivan said.

      "text": "2018 Ford EcoSport First Look Review Motor Trend 6 hrs ago Motor Trend Staff 2018 Ford EcoSport First Look Review The subcompact crossover market is exploding in the U.S., and Ford is looking to get in on the action by bringing its Fiesta-based EcoSport stateside. The tiny crossover, which has been on sale in other markets around the world since 2003, gets a face-lift for its U.S. debut ahead of the L.A. Auto Show.\nResearch Make (e.g. Mazda) Acura Alfa Romeo AM General Aston Martin Audi Bentley BMW Buick Cadillac Chevrolet Chrysler Daewoo Dodge Eagle Ferrari Fiat Fisker Ford Genesis Geo GMC Honda Hummer Hyundai Infiniti Isuzu Jaguar Jeep Kia Lamborghini Land Rover Lexus Lincoln Lotus Maserati Maybach Mazda McLaren Mercedes-Benz Mercury MINI Mitsubishi Nissan Oldsmobile Plymouth Pontiac Porsche Ram Rolls-Royce Saab Saturn Scion smart SRT Subaru Suzuki Tesla Toyota Volkswagen Volvo The 2018 Ford EcoSport looks mostly the same as it did when the second-gen model arrived for the 2012 model year. The front end adopts the new corporate hexagonal grille along with new headlights and foglights. The interior has also been brought up to date with a free-standing infotainment screen and a simplified dash design.\nThe EcoSport will be offered in four trim levels: S, SE, SES, and Titanium. Buyers will have a choice between two powertrains: the 1.0-liter turbocharged EcoBoost I-3 or a 2.0-liter naturally aspirated I-4. Ford doesn't reveal specs for those engines, but the 1.0-liter EcoBoost makes 123 hp and 125 lb-ft of torque in the Fiesta and Focus, and Ford's 2.0-liter makes 160 hp and 146 lb-ft in the Focus. Both engines are backed by a six-speed automatic transmission. Models equipped with the 2.0-liter come standard with all-wheel drive. SES models feature all-wheel drive, a sport-tuned suspension, and unique styling cues such as copper interior accents.\nTo appeal to millennials, the Ford EcoSport will be offered in 10 exterior colors and will have seven interior ambient light choices. The EcoSport will also offer a Ford-exclusive 675-watt B&O Play audio system by Harman, which features 10 speakers, including door-mounted tweeters and a rear subwoofer. The EcoSport will also offer Sync 3 infotainment and Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone integration. With FordPass, drivers can locate, start, lock, and unlock their vehicle from their phone.\nTo help promote its newest crossover addition, Ford is opening a dedicated consumer space in Hollywood. There, prospective buyers can check out the EcoSport and do other things that millennials like to do, like post to Snapchat with a unique geofilter, learn how to do nail art, and dance to live music.\nWill Ford's late entry into the subcompact crossover market—and its aggressive campaign to attract young buyers—pay off? We'll find out after the EcoSport goes on sale in early 2018.\nSee more from the LA Auto Show | Follow MSN Autos on Facebook\nGo to MSN Home",

The 2017 EcoSport's styling is in-line with bigger Ford SUVs 7.51 Lakh * On Road Price (New Delhi) FIND OUT MORE At the outset, the 2017 Ford EcoSport features a reworked front styling and is now in-line with the automaker's new design family. The subcompact SUV now boasts of a massive grille, its most noticeable change as it foregoes the gaping lower grille and slim upper grille seen on the outgoing model. The hexagonal shape has been retained, but the unit is now wider and gets chunkier chrome bars. The headlamp cluster has been tweaked as well to complement the new grille and revised bonnet. You also see a sportier bumper with a faux skid plate, and larger fog lamps on the SUV. Changes are minimal to the EcoSport facelift's rear The side profile remains largely the same, save for the new alloy wheels, whereas new Ford EcoSport a revised bumper at the rear with a larger faux diffuser. The US-spec version misses out on the external spare wheel, so, the license plate has been moved to the tailgate. The cabin gets a clutter free appeal on the EcoSport facelift Inside, Ford has updated the cabin with a revised dashboard and a gets a more clutter free appearance. A new 8-inch floating screen takes centre stage and is now equipped with Ford's Sync 3 entertainment system and also supports Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. The system will allow owners to use Sync Connect with FordPass app that allows users to start, lock, and unlock the vehicle using Bluetooth. There's also the Bang & Olufsen sound system with 10 speakers that makes up to a claimed 675 watt. The 2017 EcoSport is now feature rich with new tech, gets upgraded upholstery too The 2017 EcoSport facelift also comes equipped with two fast-charging USB ports, a 12-volt power outlet, an 110-volt outlet positioned behind the center console, and another 12-volt outlet in the rear. As many as 30 storage spaces are now available in the cabin. Certain markets do not get externally mounted spare wheel on the EcoSport The US spec version will be available in both front-wheel drive and four-wheel drive options, while power will come from the 1.0-litre three-cylinder turbocharged EcoBoost or a 2.0-litre four-cylinder petrol engines. Both motors will be paired to a 6-speed automatic transmission. India will continue to get the external spare wheel on the 2017 Ford EcoSport facelift In india though, the Ford EcoSport facelift will continue with the existing engine options including the 1.0-litre EcoBoost, 1.5-litre petrol and the 1.5-litre TDCi diesel engines. Transmission options will include a 5-speed manual and an autobox, which will send power to the front wheels. The 2017 EcoSport rivals the Mahindra TUV300, Maruti Vitara Brezza and the likes The Ford EcoSport facelift was expected to be unveiled at the Sao Paulo Auto Show last week in Brazil, but the American carmaker chose otherwise. The EcoSport facelift will be going on sale in the US in early 2018 and will be exported from Ford's Chennai based facility. The India launch can be expected in the second half of 2017. It will be interesting though to see how many of the features make it to the India-spec model as well. Do expect to see price hike on the facelifted model when it goes on sale in the country.",

The tiny crossover, which has been on sale in other markets around the world since 2003, gets a face-lift for its U.S. debut ahead of the L.A. Auto Show. \nThe 2018 Ford EcoSport looks mostly the same as it did when the second-gen model arrived for the 2012 model year. The front end adopts the new corporate hexagonal grille along with new headlights and foglights. The interior has also been brought up to date with a free-standing infotainment screen and a simplified dash design. \nThe EcoSport will be offered in four trim levels: S, SE, SES, and Titanium. Buyers will have a choice between two powertrains: the 1.0-liter turbocharged EcoBoost I-3 or a 2.0-liter naturally aspirated I-4. Ford doesn’t reveal specs for those engines, but the 1.0-liter EcoBoost makes 123 hp and 125 lb-ft of torque in the Fiesta and Focus, and Ford’s 2.0-liter makes 160 hp and 146 lb-ft in the Focus. Both engines are backed by a six-speed automatic transmission. Models equipped with the 2.0-liter come standard with all-wheel drive. SES models feature all-wheel drive, a sport-tuned suspension, and unique styling cues such as copper interior accents. \nTo appeal to millennials, the Ford EcoSport will be offered in 10 exterior colors and will have seven interior ambient light choices. The EcoSport will also offer a Ford-exclusive 675-watt B&O Play audio system by Harman, which features 10 speakers, including door-mounted tweeters and a rear subwoofer. The EcoSport will also offer Sync 3 infotainment and Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone integration. With FordPass, drivers can locate, start, lock, and unlock their vehicle from their phone. \nTo help promote its newest crossover addition, Ford is opening a dedicated consumer space in Hollywood. There, prospective buyers can check out the EcoSport and do other things that millennials like to do, like post to Snapchat with a unique geofilter, learn how to do nail art, and dance to live music. \nWill Ford’s late entry into the subcompact crossover market—and its aggressive campaign to attract young buyers—pay off? We’ll find out after the EcoSport goes on sale in early 2018.",

      "text": "2018 Ford EcoSport First Look Ford’s Big Bet on Going Small   11 Photos The B-Segment crossover market is hot and getting hotter by the day. The Buick Encore, Chevrolet Trax, Mazda CX-3, Honda HR-V are among the current major players in the segment. The Jeep Renegade joined the fray last year, and new entrants are coming soon from other major names. One brand conspicuously absent from this market, at least in North America, has been Ford. In overseas markets, the B-segment EcoSport has been one of its hottest-selling models since 2003. When the last-generation global EcoSport was revealed overseas, we wondered out loud how much longer it would be until this model reached U.S. shores. Well, we have to wonder no longer. The EcoSport is destined for North America in the first quarter of 2018. The precise model year is to be determined. Stylistically, the EcoSport is for all intents and purposes a 7/8-scale Escape. The grille, rear and interior share a strong familiarity with Ford’s best-selling C-segment crossover. Proportions are slightly more cropped, with a smaller cargo area. The EcoSport breaks prevailing convention small crossover convention with a side-hinged tailgate rather than a top-hinged door. The exterior-mounted “skittle” spare tire cover on global models has been eliminated. North American models will get a fix-a-flat kit. The North American-spec EcoBoost will be powered by either the 1.0L EcoBoost I-3 for front-drive models, or the 2.0L direct-injection naturally aspirated I-4 out of the Focus for all-wheel-drive models. All EcoSport models will offer four-wheel disc brakes with ABS. Power output or estimated fuel economy figures were not announced.   11 Photos Photo 2/11 | 2018 Ford Ecosport Rear Gate Open The EcoSport will be offered in four trim levels, from the base S model, SE, sporty SES and top-of-the-line Titanium. The SES model will be offered with paddle shifters. All N.A.-spec EcoSports will come with a six-speed automatic transmission. North American EcoSport models will be sourced from Chennai, India, making it the first Indian-built vehicle sold in the U.S. market. Fit and finish of the prototype models shown looked up to developed-market standards. Higher-trim models will be offered with a 8-inch touchscreen Sync 3 interface with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto connectivity. Standard on the Titanium model is a 10-speaker, 675-watt B&O Play audio system. SiriusXM satellite radio and HD Radio are optional. In keeping with the vehicle’s target market of millennials, the EcoSport offers two high-powered USB ports in the front passenger area, with one USB port in the rear seat, and an available 110-volt outlet at the rear of the center console. Pricing will be announced at a later date, but expect it to be in the same ballpark as its peers, meaning a starting price of below $20,000 for the S model, and a well-equipped Titanium going in the mid-to-high 20s.

The question comes from all angles: from video producers, art directors, fellow judges, non-participating editors, photographers—even the honchos in corporate. We have been thinking about this topic ever since we saw the official invite list of vehicles, sometimes since the launch of a particularly impressive vehicle earlier in the year. We all have our favorites, but it’s our thorough regimen of testing that determines the winner. Nowhere are those numbers more important than for Truck of the Year. \nAn Of The Year contest plays out one of three ways: There’s no clear winner right up to the end; there are two to three potential winners and a nail-biting vote; or there’s a clear winner early on and the rest becomes a coronation. In this year’s Truck of the Year competition, we knew by the halfway point which truck would win. \nSometimes, one vehicle so clearly satisfies or exceeds our criteria that we spend more time looking for faults than attributes, just to be sure we haven’t gotten ahead of ourselves. In this year’s field, the Ford Super Duty trucks emerged as the intuitive choice, one that had to be scrutinized, analyzed, and picked apart in subsequent days of testing. Some competitors rose in standing in the course of our evaluations, but none so much that the Super Duties needed to sweat. Indeed, the Fords’ ability to remain cool under our extreme pressure, regardless of the circumstances, made it all the more clear they deserved this award. Advancement in Design \nDesign is inherently subjective, but there are many ways to objectively judge it. Is it cohesive? Do all the individual elements serve a purpose, and do they advance the design as a whole? Does the design separate the vehicle from the competition, and does it speak to its intended market? The Ford Super Duties answer all these questions in the affirmative. \nBy their utilitarian nature, trucks can be inherently hard to differentiate. Get too creative, and you risk impinging on the vehicle’s ability to get the job done—and for the working professional, that’s what matters at the end of the day. Clunky but proficient wins over gorgeous and inefficient. The Ford Super Duties strike this balance expertly, looking like no other truck on the road while keeping the customer mission front of mind. They are clearly and distinctly Ford Super Duties seen from afar, and the design doesn’t break down the closer you look. \nAlthough the design is busy in places, an obvious vision has been executed. Every panel relates to the adjacent one, even around corners, and every line serves a purpose. Critically, the design as a whole advances the direction of the previous generation without losing or abandoning its signature. From every angle, there is no mistaking this truck for anything but a Ford. Efficiency \nVehicles of this size—or, more specifically, this weight—are not rated by EPA. Fortunately, we have our own means of evaluating fuel efficiency thanks to our partners at Emissions Analytics. \nSubjected to our Real MPG testing regimen, the Ford Super Duties, in all configurations, handily outperformed the equivalent Ram trucks. Given the gas-powered F-250 weighs some 400 pounds less than the Ram 2500 with similar equipment, we expected an advantage and weren’t surprised to see the Ford return 11.0/16.4/12.9 mpg city/highway/combined versus the Ram’s 9.2/15./11.4. \nWe were far more impressed with the performance of the F-350 dual-rear-wheel diesel. Despite weighing in at 8,643 pounds—15 pounds heavier than the Ram 3500 dual-rear-wheel diesel—the F-350 returned an outstanding 16.3/20.5/18.0 mpg city/highway/combined. Excellent in its own right, the F-350’s result is all the more impressive compared against the Ram 3500 dually’s 13.3/17.3/14.8 result. Did we mention class-leading torque and towing/payload capability? \nThere are strong arguments to be made for technological advancement and environmental protection, but the Super Duties’ efficiency will most resonate with customers at the pump. Given these trucks do more physical labor than any other class of non-commercial vehicle, the Super Duties’ advantages in efficiency will be a boon to working professionals balancing costs with capability. Engineering Excellence \nFord ads tout the Super Duty’s class-leading 32,500-pound towing capacity. (Capabilities of the forthcoming Chevy Silverado HD had not been announced as of this writing.) That’s impressive. Equally so is the also-class-leading 7,630-pound max payload capacity. \nWhat the ads don’t tell you is how the truck actually behaves with 16 tons burdening the rear axle. With a class-leading 925 lb-ft of torque on tap, the F-350 Super Duty will begin rolling forward at idle when you release the brake—despite a gross combined vehicle weight of more than 40,000 pounds. That’s simply stunning torque. Give it some throttle, and it’s a strong, steady pull to freeway speeds. Braking from such speeds is handled with confidence thanks to a powerful exhaust brake, a well-calibrated Tow/Haul mode, and strong 14-inch rotors front and rear. \n“With 30,000 pounds in tow, the F-350 was remarkably unfazed,” Chris Walton said. “Sure, there’s a sense of weight behind, but not 15 tons. The engine pulled smoothly through the rev range, the transmission clicked off smooth, quick upshifts without surging, and when it came time to slow after the quarter mile, the Jake brake gave me so much compression braking that I felt extremely confident transitioning from off-throttle to gentle braking for the turnaround.” \nWe had the luxury in this test of having the Super Duty’s most direct competitor on hand, and it proved instructive. The Super Duties accelerated more quickly and smoothly than their Ram Heavy Duty rivals, braked comparably well, and handled better both on the skidpad and the figure eight. Towing at near max capability, the F-350 was quicker and smoother than the Ram 3500 and felt less burdened. In a trailering slalom test, the F-350 was able to carry considerably more speed than the Ram 3500 and experienced less body roll, increasing driver confidence. The same held true when comparing the gas-powered F-250 to the equivalent Ram 2500. \nOn the topic of the gasoline-powered trucks, the F-250’s aluminum body helped it save 400 pounds relative to the Ram. The F-350 weighs more than the Ram 3500, which Ford attributes to the reinforcements necessary to tow 16 tons. \nThe Fords’ advantage became inescapable as we transitioned to a real-world test—towing about 7,500 pounds of skid loader up the grueling Davis Dam grade. In a 35–55-mph uphill passing test, both gasoline- and diesel-powered Ford models clobbered the equivalent Rams in both passing time and distance. \nOf course, no vehicle is perfect, and we’d be remiss if we didn’t call out areas for improvement. The gasoline-powered F-250 goes light on the nose when towing uphill, which makes it prone to tramlining and requires more driver attentiveness. Also, on one occasion, the diesel-powered F-250 under cruise control gasped in the heat and failed to maintain its uphill speed despite having adequate power to do so. Finally, all three Ford Super Duty trucks were prone to moderate bump steer on especially bad pavement and expansion joints. Performance of Intended Function \n“I’m not sure I’ve ever evaluated a vehicle that hits this criterion so hard,” Jonny Lieberman said. None of us argued. Ford has spent an enormous amount of time researching its customers’ needs and wants and finding clever engineering solutions. We know from industry research that the vast majority of heavy-duty truck customers aren’t weekend cowboys. Capability and usability are king, and Ford has delivered both. \nThe suite of work-focused technologies baked into the Super Duties was also highly impressive. Although most folks who drive heavy-duty trucks are everyday pros, we noticed the Ford assistance features best helped rookies and those rusty in trailering. \nHeavy-duty truck customers aren’t weekend cowboys. Capability and usability are king. \nThe ability to extend blind-spot detection to cover a trailer adds an important layer of safety, as does the ability to monitor six trailer tires’ pressures and the trailer lights on the dashboard. Its 360-degree camera coverage greatly aides maneuvering in close quarters, as do forward- and rear-looking cameras. An additional camera mounted above the rear window, as well as the ability to zoom both this camera and the tailgate-mounted backup camera, makes connecting to a trailer a breeze for one person. A dash-mounted tailgate release saves time and effort when attaching a gooseneck or fifth wheel and when loading or unloading. The ability to add an additional wired backup camera to a trailer and display it on the center console is also helpful, as is the trailer-backing guidance with jackknife warning. \nJudges also gave the Super Duties high marks for the inclusion of four 25-amp and two 40-amp auxiliary switches, ready to be connected to power takeoffs and other equipment, and we appreciated the available 400-watt power inverter and two available 110-volt power outlets for charging tools, computers, and more. Safety \nThe 2017 Ford Super Duties had not yet been crash tested by either the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety or the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. However, we expect them to perform well because of the strengthened frame. \nOf course, we prefer a vehicle that can avoid collisions in the first place. To increase your chances, Ford has added a number of features, including collision warning, automatic emergency braking, and trailer sway control. All those cameras increase low-speed safety, as does the blind-spot warning system, especially when extended to cover a trailer. Adaptive cruise control helps maintain safe distances both laden and unladen and maintains a set speed on hill descent, even while trailering. \nThe Super Duty’s strong performance in the uphill passing-while-trailering test also indicated a measure of safety, as the trucks are able to more quickly remove themselves from an unsafe situation. CLEAN WIN Across powertrains, cabs, and capabilities, the Ford Super Duties proved themselves the new leaders of the class. Value \nHeavy-duty trucks are expensive. Regardless of make, they all start around $32,000, roughly the average price of a new vehicle in America. That doesn’t seem so bad. But fully loaded—and if you are using a heavy-duty truck to its capacity, you tend to load up on options—the price more than doubles. Value, then, is not synonymous with price. Rather, it is relative to the competition. \nHere again, the Super Duty compares favorably. When matched with the only other equally capable truck on the market, the Super Duties are priced roughly the same or better than the equivalent Ram trim level—especially at higher trim levels. It’s more than just dollars and cents, though. The Fords offer class-leading towing and hauling. They can also be equipped with a suite of trailering technologies Ram doesn’t offer. In terms of content per dollar spent, the Super Duties are the clear class leaders. Winners \nAs with any Of The Year competition, Truck of the Year is not a direct comparison test. Each truck is judged against our criteria, based on the class it competes in. The Ford F-250 and F-350 score remarkably well on all six—as well as against their direct competition. With its latest Super Duties, Ford has set new benchmarks for capability and functionality. We have no doubt the competition will race to meet Ford’s new standard. Putting the competition on notice and forcing them to catch up is a hallmark of an Of The Year winner. Consider the bar raised. 2017 Motor Trend Truck of the Year Contenders",

      "text": "Photography / Transportation ©2016 The-Transport-Guild With the classic lines of the original Ford Mustang ending in 1969, this generation of the mighty Pony Car modified the body to make it look more macho. Many Mustang enthusiasts I know choose to forget this particular generation, citing it as the beginning of the long slide down into obscurity that the Mustang went to in the 70's and 80's. Although one of these Mustang's did take part in the spectacular Las Vegas car chase in the James Bond movie Diamonds are Forever, the car simply had not the same style and magnificence that the 1968 model had obtained before in Bullitt. The 2nd Generation Mustang of 1974 however is where most Mustang enthusiasts believe the true spark was lost, with its big chunky panels and downgraded engine being considered a husk of the original, compounded by the 3rd Generation which was to be based off a Mazda!

      "text": " \nU.S. News & World Report has announced the winners of its 2017 Best Vehicle Brand awards. The annual awards recognize brands with top-performing vehicles in four major categories: SUVs – including crossovers and minivans – cars, trucks and luxury.\nBest SUV Brand: Honda\nWith comfortable interiors and family-friendly features, Honda leads the Best SUV Brand category. Honda’s lineup includes the Honda CR-V, Honda HR-V, Honda Odyssey and the redesigned Honda Pilot, all of which rank at or near the top of their classes in Compact SUVs, Subcompact SUVs, Minivans and Midsize SUVs, respectively.\nBest Car Brand: Mazda\nFor the second year, Mazda claims the No. 1 spot. Mazda’s lineup of cars, including the Mazda3 and MX-5 Miata, earn positive reviews for well-made interiors and driving dynamics.\nBest Truck Brand: Ford\nFord’s F-150 line of pickups have fuel-saving engine designs, some of the best payload and tow ratings in the class, easy handling and roomy cabins.\nBest Luxury Brand: Porsche\nIn recent years Porsche has expanded its lineup to include the Panamera, a super-luxury sedan, as well as the Cayenne and Macan SUVs. The models live up to the Porsche’s performance-driven heritage while also providing the rich interiors and connectivity features that today’s luxury buyers demand.\n“Consumers have an overwhelming number of factors to consider when comparing cars,” Jamie Page Deaton, managing editor of U.S. News Best Cars, said in a statement. “The Best Vehicle Brand awards simplify the process by giving people guidance on the top brands in the categories that matter to them.”\nThe Best Vehicle Brands methodology is an objective, analysis-driven assessment of quality across all of a brand’s offerings within the four categories. Brand ratings are based on the U.S. News Best Cars overall scores for each vehicle, which incorporate the consensus opinions of the automotive industry as well as safety and reliability data.\n ",

      "text": "DJ Khaled Just Introduced Ford's Latest SUV on Snapchat It's the first vehicle reveal on the app By Christine Birkner   Advertising & Branding DJ Khaled revealed the new SUV to his 6 million Snapchat followers. Sources: Ford, Snapchat DJ Khaled recently Snapchatted his son's birth to his 6 million followers, and he just did the same thing for the launch of Ford's new \"baby,\" the EcoSport SUV, which he revealed on Snapchat Monday night. It's the first car officially revealed on Snapchat, according to Ford. \"It's different than anything you've ever seen from Ford before, and it starts with who our customer is,\" said Cristina Aquino, marketing manager at Ford. \"Their focus isn't about having stuff—they wanted a car that enables them to have experiences. Snapchat lets you share experiences with friends and family, and there's no one who ties to that concept of Snapchat better than DJ Khaled.\" Ford isn't the first brand to tap into Khaled's larger-than-life personality. The so-called \"king of Snapchat,\" who's known for catchphrases like \"major key\" and \"another one,\" previously has inked deals with Apple, Ciroc vodka and Silk plant-based milk. Khaled also will appear at Ford's \"Go Small, Live Big: L.A.\" installation, timed to this week's L.A. Auto Show. It's a pop-up village in Los Angeles that will include local food from Smorgasburg LA vendors, a minizoo of tiny animals, a tiny home and demonstrations by professional skateboarders at a Venice-style skate park. The campaign is designed showcase the EcoSport as Ford's smallest SUV but with a big personality for those who believe in \"living big,\" as Khaled does.

      "text": "2018 Ford EcoSport Subcompact Crossover Revealed on Snapchat Small Blue Oval goes big on social media By: Ed Tahaney November 14, 2016 \nF ord went social for the launch of its new EcoSport subcompact crossover, unveiling the diminutive ute on Snapchat . FoMoCo used the personal video sharing service to promote the launch of its smallest SUV at an interactive reveal in Hollywood, California. \nThe pint-sized EcoSport packs a turbocharged 1.0-liter EcoBoost I-3 or a 2.0-liter I-4 with all-wheel drive. Both engines are mated to a six-speed automatic transmission. In all, the EcoSport will be offered in four trim levels, 10 colors, and with seven ambient lighting options. \n“More people are choosing to spend their time and money sharing experiences with friends and family instead of buying more stuff,” said Chantel Lenard, executive direct of Ford U.S. marketing, in a statement. “EcoSport fits perfectly into this growing lifestyle. It’s our smallest SUV, packed with features and personality.” \nFord claims that it is the world’s first-ever vehicle reveal on Snapchat. Speaking of Snapchat reveals and SUVs, a 19-year-old Texas college student recently crashed her Acura while taking a topless Snapchat selfie . \nIt seems like the competition’s SUV doesn’t offer the connected tech one can find in the all-new Ford EcoSport, which makes it easy to stay in touch with friends and family using the new and improved SYNC 3 system, that’s optimized for hands-free use. \nFord says drivers can start, lock, unlock, check fuel levels and find their EcoSport using their latest mobile app. Inside, there are two USB ports, a 12-volt power outlet, and a whopping 30 stowage pockets, bins, and hooks scattered throughout the vehicle. The rear features a moveable floorboard, fold away seats, and a swing-gate-style tailgate for hauling furniture. \nAn optional 10-speaker B&O PLAY premium audio system with 675 watts will help drown out the screaming siblings on those long trips to the soccer practice. Fortunately, it’s standard on EcoSport Titanium. \nLearn more about the reveal that continues this week at FordPresents.com and at the Los Angeles auto show. Ford invites EcoSport visitors to share their experiences on social media with Snapchat geo-filters. Just remember to keep it clean and keep both hands on the wheel.",

      "text": "A facelifted version of the Ford EcoSport has been unveiled at the 2016 LA Auto Show. This is the most comprehensive update for the compact crossover since it was launched in 2012 and marks its arrival in the American market. The new version of the SUV is expected to arrive in the Indian market sometime in 2017 and will be offered here with both petrol and diesel power.\nExternally, the updated Ford EcoSport gets a new grille and lighting package that has taken the SUV’s appearance from wide and gaping to muscular and angled. The revised headlamps have become sharper and now include projectors. The side profile remains the same but the wheels have undergone a revision. It’s a similar story at the rear but now a contrast coloured bash plate element has been integrated into the bumper.\nWhile the exterior changes are noticeable, the insides have undergone a major change both in terms of design and features. The single tone grey/black cabin now gets exterior colour co-ordinated inserts for the dashboard/door while the seats too have been given offset body coloured stripes. The fonts on the instrument cluster have been revised and there is a new colour digital display between the pods. However, the biggest addition is that there is now an eight-inch touchscreen system (with a floating display) fitted with the American automaker’s SYNC 3 system. It is also compatible with Android Auto and Apple CarPlay. Sound comes courtesy of a B&O 10 speaker sound system.\nThe American market will get the EcoSport with the 1.0-litre EcoBoost motor as well as a 2.0-litre four-cylinder engine. Both engines will only get the option of a six-speed AT and AWD will only be offered on the top-of-the-line trims. We in India will also get the car with the 1.5-litre petrol engine as well as the 1.5-litre diesel.\nThe growing demand for SUVs globally has probably prompted Ford to bring the EcoSport to the American market. While we consider it a C-segment SUV, it will, in the US of A, be an alternative to the range of compact hatchbacks that they have on sale and debut in early 2018.",

      "text": "Send Message Summary \nThanks to Trump, Ford may have to play a prominent role in addressing this new, politically-induced business challenge, that is, how to make its foreign investments work. \nFord could try to sell locally its foreign-produced cars, including those made in Mexico, where the company ought to substantially grow its market share. \nWithout having to sell anything back to the U.S. from overseas, Ford and other car makers would have to build up their U.S. manufacturing facilities to meet domestic demand. Ford Motor Company (NYSE: F ), repeatedly a target by then candidate Trump for shipping jobs to Mexico, must now have a contingent plan on how to make its foreign investments work if President Trump resorts to trade barriers to potentially block selling the company's Mexican-made cars back to the U.S. While businesses may find it easier to invest capital wherever profitability may take them, barring unusual governmental restrictions, they can face more fluid trade policies at the will of an administration that may or may not work in their favor at different times. It's been reported that prior to the election, Bill Ford had discussed with Trump the candidate's criticism of the company's plan to invest in Mexico. The discussion was later described as \"infuriating and frustrating\" by the executive chairman, seemingly suggesting no agreements were reached thus far. A potential solution for Ford may rest on whether the company can manage to shift its focus from trying to prevent rising trade tariffs to considering to sell locally its Mexican-made cars. Meanwhile, to fill any resulting shortfall in supplying the U.S. auto market, Ford would have to increase domestic productions and thus hire U.S. workers, a move that would be both a necessary business move and the right semi-political action. Ford reported 93,000 in wholesale vehicle units in 2015 from Mexico, a market of 1.4 million units of annual sales. It gives the company a market share of 6.7% in the Mexican auto market, less than half of the company's 14.7% market share in the U.S., where Ford sold a total of 2.7 million vehicles in 2015. Ford's U.S. sales alone are larger than the size of the entire Mexican auto market, making it easier for the company to scale up its Mexican productions. Ford could use its current investments in Mexico and potentially more in the future to gain market share there, especially considering its current 6.7% share of the Mexican auto market is a decline from the 8% in 2013. As Ford grows in Mexico by supplying its local productions exclusively to the Mexican market, it wouldn't have to worry about trying to sell some of them back to the U.S. Trump's manufacturing-related trade argument is based on the perceived U.S. companies' unfair practice of moving productions overseas for lower costs and then selling their foreign made products back to the U.S. domestic markets. Foregoing that argument, Ford and other multinational companies could still invest in international markets, but their investments in foreign, low-cost productions should lead to locally made goods being sold locally. Businesses generally like to expand their markets' geographic reach, including internationally, if they believe they could go in to compete and earn a profit. However, the globalization as we know may take on a lesser scale if it becomes common over time that locally produced goods using foreign capital is expected to stay in local markets. Thus, Ford and other domestic car makers would have to start considering to play each market separately using local productions if, for example, they could no longer tie their Mexican auto productions to the U.S. market. Incurring higher labor costs in the U.S. may cut into margins initially, and this can be particularly challenging for Ford whose various profit margins mostly trail those of its peers. While investing overseas and selling foreign-made products back to the U.S. is likely to be restrained under the Trump administration, other direct imports to the U.S. could also be negatively affected if tougher trade deals are to be proposed. For the U.S. auto market, this would potentially mean fewer cars imported from foreign companies such as the all-too-familiar Japanese and European auto makers. One way to still meet the U.S. car sales demand would be for foreign companies to invest more in additional manufacturing facilities in the U.S. This would allow them to produce cars in the U.S. and sell them to the U.S. market. However, as new capacities are being built up, there could be a certain degree of shift in market shares among auto companies. If Ford could ready its existing, unused production facilities more quickly than foreign rivals, it'd be in a better position to gain market share from companies that might have to break ground for new plants. Higher sales volumes would help Ford lower unit production costs and as a result, improve margins.

      "text": "Tweet \nFord’s a little late to the subcompact crossover party, so it’s making a lot of noise to make up for it. The company hosted a highly publicized live Snapchat unveiling for the EcoSport last night, complete with DJ Khaled chanting the vehicle’s name while gesturing at it and dancing around. \nFrom a global perspective, it’s technically not a new car . However, it will be new for North America, and serves to fill an important gap in the company’s lineup. With subcompact crossover sales increasing 30 percent this year, Ford needed to throw something into this crowded segment. \nSurprisingly, the United States is being offered the turbocharged 1.0-liter EcoBoost three-cylinder, in addition to a 2.0-liter four-pot. Drivers opting for the 2.0-liter get four-wheel drive as standard, and Ford says both engines will come with six-speed automatic transmissions. \nFord is also bragging about the EcoSport’s 30 stowage pockets, bins, and hooks. While that may not be incredibly exciting information to a normal person, those are the kind of touches that make a car more livable and get a crossover consumer’s mouth watering. \nAdditional practicalities include a horizontally swinging tailgate, movable floor boards, and fold-away second row seats, allowing drivers to turn the rear space into a flat open expanse for cargo. \nFeatures will be dependent on trim level and the little crossover gets all of the Ford staples: S, SE, SES and Titanium. The Titanium receives a B&O Play audio system with 10 speakers. Meanwhile, the SES gets copper accents for the interior, sport seats, and a tuned suspension. It seems that all trims offer an eight-inch infotainment unit in the center stack with Sync 3. \nThe EcoSport is expected to go on sale in early 2018. \n[Images: Ford Motor Company]",

      "text": "Honda, Mazda, Ford And Porsche Highlight 2017 Best Vehicle Brand Awards November 15, 2016 5:04 AM Filed Under: Ford , honda , Mazda , Porsche (credit: istock) \nDETROIT (WWJ) – U.S. News & World Report has announced the winners of its 2017 Best Vehicle Brand awards. The annual awards recognize brands with top-performing vehicles in four major categories: SUVs – including crossovers and minivans – cars, trucks and luxury. \nBest SUV Brand: Honda With comfortable interiors and family-friendly features, Honda leads the Best SUV Brand category. Honda’s lineup includes the Honda CR-V, Honda HR-V, Honda Odyssey and the redesigned Honda Pilot, all of which rank at or near the top of their classes in Compact SUVs, Subcompact SUVs, Minivans and Midsize SUVs, respectively. \nBest Car Brand: Mazda For the second year, Mazda claims the No. 1 spot. Mazda’s lineup of cars, including the Mazda3 and MX-5 Miata, earn positive reviews for well-made interiors and driving dynamics. \nBest Truck Brand: Ford Ford’s F-150 line of pickups have fuel-saving engine designs, some of the best payload and tow ratings in the class, easy handling and roomy cabins. \nBest Luxury Brand: Porsche In recent years Porsche has expanded its lineup to include the Panamera, a super-luxury sedan, as well as the Cayenne and Macan SUVs. The models live up to the Porsche’s performance-driven heritage while also providing the rich interiors and connectivity features that today’s luxury buyers demand. \n“Consumers have an overwhelming number of factors to consider when comparing cars,” Jamie Page Deaton, managing editor of U.S. News Best Cars, said in a statement. “The Best Vehicle Brand awards simplify the process by giving people guidance on the top brands in the categories that matter to them.” \nThe Best Vehicle Brands methodology is an objective, analysis-driven assessment of quality across all of a brand’s offerings within the four categories. Brand ratings are based on the U.S. News Best Cars overall scores for each vehicle, which incorporate the consensus opinions of the automotive industry as well as safety and reliability data.",

      "text": "DETROIT (WWJ) – The president and CEO Ford Motor Co. says he’s ready and willing to work with President-elect Donald Trump.\nSpeaking to WWJ’s Jeff Gilbert from the LA Auto Show, Mark Fields said now that election is over, it’s time for Trump to focus on policy — and he’s optimistic.\n“We believe the right policies are going to be put in place because I think, Jeff, we have, we all have the same common goal which is you know, we want a healthy U.S. economy,” Fields said. “And as we think about some of the policies that may be put in place we’ll engage, I think, in a very productive discussion all with that in mind, of keeping the U.S. economy very healthy.”\nTrump has criticized Ford for importing vehicles from Mexico — something that other carmakers also do — and has threatened tariffs of 35 percent on those cars. The president-elect has called NAFTA a “worst trade deal in history,” and a “disaster,” and has said as president he would negotiate for better terms with both Mexico and Canada.\nIf those countries don’t agree to his adjustments Trump said that he just may scrap the deal all together.\nWithout specifically addressing those issues, Fields said he’s very much looking forward to a conversation with Trump.\n“We have a proven track record going all the way back to the administration of Teddy Roosevelt, since when we were first founded, of having good working relationships with policy makers on both sides of the aisle,” Fields said, adding that he does believe there’s some common ground.\n“Of course we agree with the president-elect it’s about bringing people together and we look forward to working with him and the administration and growing the economy,” he said.\nMeantime, at this week’s auto show , Fields said he’s focused on engaging with the public about the future of the auto industry.\n“It’s really interesting because this is the first show that’s actually merging traditional auto show day with a connected car expo, so it’s the industry’s first integration of both a tech and an auto show,” Fields said. “So we’re making news on both sides as we transform to an auto and a mobility company.”",

      "text": "Pinterest Email In a day long reveal that featured a tiny house, tiny zoo, terrestrial surfing simulators , tiny hors d’oeuvres, a giant mural of John Ritter , a screen printing stand and DJ Khaled , Ford revealed their smallest crossover, the EcoSport. The EcoSport has been on sale elsewhere in the world since 2003 but this version, built in and imported from India, will be the first one sold in the US. When it goes on sale here in 2018, the EcoSport will be powered by either Ford’s amazing little 1-liter turbo 3-cylinder in front-wheel-drive spec or a naturally aspirated 2-liter four in all-wheel drive configuration. A six-speed automatic will be the only transmission offered. There will be four trim levels available and ten exterior color choices. 2017 Chevy Trax first drive: Refreshed crossover gets a familiar face \nThe Chevy Trax has spent just a few years on sale in the States, but it's been largely unchanged since its global launch in 2013. That, well, changes for 2017: You’ll still ... The interior will feel familiar to you if you’ve spent time in a current generation Focus or Fiesta . In the few moments I spent in the car, it felt comfortable and well designed, and surprisingly spacious with a few minor imperfections. It’s not a luxury car, there’s still that familiar oily-looking plastic, but it should suit the prospective buyer very well. It should be noted that the car I sat in was a pre-production model, so we’ll reserve judgement for when we get a look at the production version. The EcoSport will also come with a “floating” 8-inch touch-screen running SYNC 3, which finally works quickly and intuitively. Below the screen are two quick-charge USB ports to charge phones, but in continuation with a troubling trend now impacting a number of automakers the beloved 3.5mm “aux-cord” input is nowhere to be found. Speccing the Titanium trim package gets you a 10-speaker B&O Play stereo system. Ford made a point to say that the front tweeters and door speakers were actually branded B&O, while others are not. The rear hatch area is most notable for a gate that swings out and to your left when you’re facing it. The rear seats fold flat, and there’s moveable floorboard that can be raised and lowered so that items can be stored beneath it. Pricing, fuel economy and specs weren’t announced--we’ll post them as soon as we have them. \nBy Michael Martinez, Automotive News READ THIS NEXT",

Courtesy of Ephrata police \nAn Ephrata police sergeant crashed into the back of this occupied sport utility vehicle at East Main Street and Ridge Avenue in the borough Monday evening. \nNo one was seriously injured when an Ephrata police sergeant crashed his marked cruiser into the back of a citizen’s car Monday night, police said. \nAimee Andrew, 20, of Ephrata, was stopped on East Main Street, waiting for clearance to make a left turn onto Ridge Avenue at 7:15 p.m. when Sergeant Matthew Randolph struck her from behind, Ephrata police Chief Bill Harvey said. \n“We're very grateful that no one was seriously injured, and that everyone was able to walk away,” he said. \nAndrew was driving a 1999 tan Dodge Durango, and Randolph a 2016 Ford Explorer that is a marked police cruiser. \nMedical personnel examined Andrew and a young child in her sport utility vehicle at the scene and they did not require medical transport, Harvey said. Randolph later drove himself to WellSpan Ephrata Community Hospital, had a painful hand checked out and was released. He was able to return to work his following shift. \nThe crash caused extensive damage to the left front of the cruiser, which was only recently added to the department’s fleet, Harvey said. An estimate of the damage has not yet been determined. Both vehicles were towed, the chief said. \nEphrata police have not filed any charges in the crash, saying they are still investigating. \nHarvey said since Ephrata police have an accident reconstructionist on staff and the wreck did not include a death or serious injuries, a state police investigation is not required. \nRandolph was on patrol at the time of the crash, Ephrata police Lt. Chris McKim said. He was responding to a call, but it was not an emergency. \nRandolph “was checking dispatch screen for a suspicious activity in progress” when the wreck occurred, McKim said. The wreck may have been caught by a camera in the cruiser, but it may take some time to retrieve it due to the extensive damage. Tags",

      "title": "2018 Ford EcoSport: Ford enters the subcompact segment",
      "text": "2018 Ford EcoSport: Ford enters the subcompact segment Photo: Alain Morin Print \nIn the last few years, the subcompact SUV category has grown and isn’t showing signs of slowing down. It notably includes the Nissan JUKE, the Honda HR-V, the Mazda CX-3, the Jeep Renegade and the Subaru Crosstrek. Ford will soon be joining them with its new model, the EcoSport. \nIt may be new for us, but not the rest of the world. The EcoSport first appeared in 2003, and a new generation arrived in 2012. The model that just unveiled will hit Canadian dealerships in early 2018, so we can presume it will be a 2018 model. \nEcoSport doesn’t always mean EcoBoost In the powertrain department, we’ll find the 1.0-litre EcoBoost engine that’s also offered in the Fiesta, which will be connected to the front wheels only. There will also be a naturally aspirated, 2.0-litre four that will be exclusively matched to an all-wheel drivetrain. In both cases, output hasn’t been announced, but a six-speed automatic transmission will be standard. Curiously, while simple details such as curb weight, power and cargo space are kept secret, the vehicle’s chief engineer didn’t hesitate to talk about towing capacity, set at 1400 lbs. (635 kg) for the 1.0L engine, and 2000 lbs. (907 kg) for the 2.0L mill. Seeing how strained the 1.0L engine felt in the Focus, which is heavier than the Fiesta, we can’t imagine it being able to pull such a load. But anyway, we’ll see. \nFloating screen and storage space Inside the cockpit, the design is pure Ford, but the central eight-inch touchscreen is now of the “floating” type like in Mazda and Mercedes-Benz products. That’s progress, I suppose. SYNC 3, Android Auto and Apple CarPlay will be included. In fact, pretty much every connectivity option we can think of should be available in the 2018 Ford EcoSport, either standard or as an option. During the media presentation before the Los Angeles Auto Show press days, Ford invited DJ Khaled to entertain the crowd, a rapper that was previously unknown to me—but well-known judging by the younger people in attendance. If Ford wants to attract a younger clientele, it figured out how to do it.",

      "text": "Ram Reportedly Working On V8 Pickup Truck To Compete With Ford's Raptor 15 Nov 2016, 10:42   Rumors Ram , the American brand focused on pickup trucks and utility vehicles, is reportedly working on a production model that will become the direct competitor of the Ford Raptor. This September, Ram revealed a Hellcat V8 powered pickup truck , which was named Ram Rebel TRX. The vehicle was showcased as a concept, without any mention of a potential production model. However, the American truck maker made the prototype fully functional, and it operated without a hitch. It was claimed that the Rebel TRX could drive at 160 km/h (100 mph) “anywhere.” Evidently, they did not mean it could handle on water, but any crossable terrain that does not have a pronounced slope or any other element that could hinder travel could be driven on at the specified speed. This happened thanks to the heavy-duty suspension that was fitted to the Rebel TRX, along with the detuned Hellcat engine that still provided over 570 HP . The suspension itself has 37 inches of travel, which is 40% more than a standard Ram 1500. If that does not impress you, it had 37-inch tires, and the vehicle seemed to be able to match and beat a Ford Raptor in just about any territory. With over a month and a half since the moment it was first revealed, rumors have emerged that Fiat Chrysler Automobiles has approved the development of a production version of the Rebel TRX Concept. While we do not have anything official on the subject, one could expect FCA to sell a production pickup truck inspired by the Ram Rebel TRX. Even though V8 sourced from the Hellcat twins might not make it to production, it would not surprise us if it did. After all, Ram needs the numbers and bragging rights, while Ford would love a competitor in this segment . May the best souped-up OEM pickup truck win!",

      "text": "U.S.-spec 2018 Ford EcoSport Will Be Built in India 15 Nov 2016, 9:41   Car Profile In early 2018, the Ford Motor Company will start importing the EcoSport into the United States of America from India. Slated to be built at the manufacturer’s Chennai plant, the EcoSport holds the title of first U.S.-market Ford model to be produced in India. But first, a quick recap about the second-generation EcoSport. Introduced back in January 2012 and based on the Fiesta’s B2E platform, the EcoSport already went through a couple of minor updates. First and foremost, the EcoSport lost its swing-out door-mounted spare wheel in 2015 . After that, the European-spec EcoSport added a PowerShift transmission for the 1.5 Ti-VCT. Be that as it may, the 2018 Ford EcoSport represents yet another update for the crossover, one that transmutes the EcoSport into a more mature vehicle. Dubbed “perfect for the adventures that lie ahead” and aimed at people who want to “live big,” the 2018 EcoSport is noticeably more pleasing to the eye compared to the EU-spec 2016 EcoSport. The interior, however, is a significant improvement over the current model, thanks to a redesign of the dash and the addition of a Ford SYNC 3 8-inch infotainment system. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are on the menu, as is SYNC Connect, the smartphone app that allows owners to lock, unlock, and start the vehicle via their mobile phones. For those who want to go all-out with the options, there’s an available B&O Play audio system with 10 speakers and 675 watts to play with. Be that as it may, the interior still looks very, very plasticky. In terms of customization, customers have 10 paint choices, 7 ambient lighting options, and 4 trim levels: S, SE, SES, and the top-of-the-range Titanium. To be offered with either the 1.0 EcoBoost turbo-3 or a 2.0-liter 4-cylinder engine, the 2018 EcoSport comes as standard with a six-speed automatic transmission. All-wheel-drive is available only on SES and Titanium models equipped with the 2.0-liter mill. The visual updates performed on the U.S.-spec 2018 Ford EcoSport will trickle down to the European model, which is slated to go into production at Ford’s plant in Craiova, Romania , in 2017.

The EcoSport will be at the Los Angeles Auto Show, open to the public November 18-27. (Photo: Ford) \nToday is Tuesday, Nov. 15, 2016, and we're getting a look at what's to come in Detroit in January.\nThe Los Angeles Auto Show is underway, and compact SUVs are the stars of the show, particularly Ford's imported EcoSport , which is due to arrive in early 2018.\nThe 2017 Chevrolet Bolt EV took home Motor Trend magazine’s coveted Car of the Year honors last night. The highly anticipated Bolt, which is due in showrooms by the end of the year, offers an estimated 238 miles of all-electric range with a price tag of less than $30,000, minus a federal income tax rebate.\nMotor Trend also named the Mercedes-Benz GLC as its 2017 SUV of the Year, and the 2017 Ford Super Duty as its Truck of the Year.\nHere's what else we're covering today:\nCleaves in court \n\nThe preliminary examination for former Michigan State basketball star Mateen Cleaves on rape charges is underway this morning in a Flint courtroom. The rape charges are in connection with an allegation by a 24-year-old Mount Morris woman that the 39-year-old Cleaves sexually assaulted her in a Mundy Township hotel in September 2015 after she rode with him following a charity golf outing.\nPleading guilty \n\nA 41-year-old Plymouth-Canton Community Schools middle school teacher’s aide pleaded guilty Monday to remaining criminal charges in connection with allegations she engaged in oral sex with teenage male students, some of whom are believed to be her daughters’ 15-year-old friends. War crimes \n\nU.S. troops and CIA agents could face investigation and possible charges by the International Criminal Court after its chief prosecutor said in a report that they may have committed war crimes by torturing detainees in Afghanistan. Dancing with Megatron \nCalvin Johnson Jr. tangoed to “Seven Nation Army” by the Detroit-based band The White Stripes on Monday night.   (Photo: Video capture) \n\nFormer Lions wide receiver Calvin Johnson Jr. tangoed his way to the “Dancing with the Stars” finals on the ABC reality television show Monday night. Johnson and professional dancer Lindsay Arnold are among four remaining couples who will compete for the Mirror Ball Trophy in the show’s finals next week. The three other celebrities left in the the competition include singer Jana Kramer of Rochester Hills, Olympic gymnast Laurie Hernandez and IndyCar driver James Hinchcliffe.\nImplications of a Trump presidency \n\nAmong the things that could change under President Donald Trump: automaker regulations (minus those for cars made in Mexico), deportation policy, school lunches (Trump is a fan of fast food), and legal abortions (Roe v. Wade could be in peril, experts say). President Barack Obama is visiting Greece right now , his first international trip since the election. He's making assurances that the U.S. will remain with NATO, even after Trump said during his campaign that the U.S. might pull out of the NATO alliance if other countries don’t pay more. The protests against Trump continue as thousands of students left high school classrooms in California, Colorado, Maryland, Washington and other states, many declaring concerns over the president-elect’s comments about minorities and the effect he will have on their communities. Revival in New Center \n\nSeventeen months after the Fisher and Albert Kahn buildings were sold in a $12.2 million deal, owners of the New Center properties say they plan to invest up to an estimated $100 million to revive the architectural jewels. Sexiest \"Rock\" alive \nDwayne “The Rock” Johnson was named \"Sexiest Man Alive\" by People magazine on Nov. 15, 2016.   (Photo: Richard Shotwell / AP) \n\nFormer WWE champ Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson can add People’s “Sexiest Man Alive” title to his list of accomplishments. The wrestler-turned-actor was crowned this year’s winner Tuesday morning. \nHappy hunting \n\nHonoring a tradition that reaches back for generations, Michigan hunters will head to the woods today for the opening of deer season.

Auto Show 2016 live updates: Jaguar leaps into the all-electric market with an SUV Nov. 15, 2016, 9:30 a.m. \nThe Los Angeles Auto Show opens to the public Friday and ends Nov. 27. Take a look through our coverage from the four days of press previews and keynotes, known as AutoMobility L.A., to see photos and analysis of the latest high-tech offerings. Nov. 15, 2016, 9:30 a.m. Ford CEO: \"We are on the cusp of a mobility revolution\" Charles Fleming (Myung J. Chun   \nEmbracing rather than fleeing from a mobility future that will almost certainly not include the automotive industry in its current formulation, Ford CEO Mark Fields told attendees of the just-convened AutoMobility LA car convention that his company is running headlong into an era in which cars are no longer Ford's principal business. \n\"We are on the cusp of a mobility revolution,\" said Fields. \"While we will continue to make great vehicles, they are no longer our entire game.\" \nSpeaking to an audience of about 300 industry professionals, wearing a blazer and open-necked dress shirt, Fields lauded the Los Angeles Auto Show executives for rebranding the industry-only portion of their annual event as AutoMobility -- and for stepping toward a future that, so far, no one can quite define. (Myung J. Chun   \n\"We are attending the first major automotive show in the world that isn't just about cars,\" Fields said. \nThe CEO said the company's future will depend upon cooperation with cities, among other things, to design transportation solutions for metropolitan areas. Characterizing this as \"optimizing roads for the number of people on them, not the number of vehicles on them,\" Fields stressed partnerships such as Ford's with the urban shuttle service Chariot as key to future solutions. \nHe also said that his company will have autonomous cars on the road, in partnership with a ride sharing service, by 2021. \nHe also announced a partnership between Ford and former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg to work with cities to solve mobility problems. \nRaising the spectre of company founder Henry Ford's successful attempt to liberate working Americans from the personal mobility system known as the horse by introducing an affordable automobile, a century ago, Fields said, \"We've spent the last 100 years getting ready for this moment.\" Latest updates",

      "text": "Adam Jeffery | CNBC Mark Fields, CEO of Ford Motor Co. \nFord will not change its plans to fit with what President-elect Donald Trump has said about instating tariffs and bringing manufacturing back to the United States, CEO Mark Fields said on Tuesday. \n\"We all share the same objective: we want a strong, vibrant U.S. economy,\" Fields told CNBC's \" Fast Money Halftime Report .\" \nThe CEO said that the company will continue to produce some of its trucks in Mexico despite Trump's threats to impose tariffs on all vehicles built in Mexico for sale in the United States. Tariffs will impact the entire auto sector and economy, a risk the Republican administration would not want to take, Fields said. \nFields said that there will be no change to the number of jobs Ford creates within the U.S. with the new plans the company is implementing to utilize its \"global manufacturing footprint.\" \nFord reported a decline in October's U.S. sales of 11.7 percent earlier this month, lower than analysts' predictions of 10.9 percent.",

      "text": "Buy Photo Caption: Ford CEO Mark Fields on Tuesday, Nov. 15, delivers the morning keynote address at the Los Angeles Auto Show’s Automobility LA conference. (Photo: Michael Wayland / The Detroit News) Buy Photo\nLos Angeles — Ford Motor Co. has been in “constant communication” with Donald Trump’s transition team since the election, with CEO Mark Fields sending a congratulatory letter to the president-elect.\nFields declined to comment if Trump, who targeted Ford throughout his campaign for investing in Mexico, responded to the letter.\n“We have had conversations with the transition team,” he said Tuesday after a speech at the Los Angeles Auto Show’s Mobility LA conference. “I’ve sent a congratulatory letter to the president-elect and we look forward to working with the new administration and the entire newly-elected Congress.”\nFord, including Fields, went on the defensive several times during the presidential election, attempting to defend the automaker’s Mexico investment and to correct statements Trump made about the automaker shuttering plants domestically to move production south of the border.\nTrump repeatedly used as campaign talking points the announcements by Ford it would invest billions in Mexico and move production of the Ford Focus and C-MAX from its Michigan Assembly Plant in Wayne to Mexico.\nFields on Tuesday said the company has no changes to its plans, citing, as he has in the past, that Ford will add “two very exciting products that will be coming into the Michigan Assembly plant.” Those products, as reported by The Detroit News and other media outlets, are the Ford Ranger pickup and Ford Bronco SUV.\nTrump has indicated he would end the trade pact with Canada and Mexico and slap a 10 percent to 35 percent tariff on vehicles and parts made in Mexico that are imported into the U.S. He also has threatened tariffs of up to 45 percent exported from China to the U.S.\nFields on Tuesday said a tariff such as that on Mexico “could have a huge impact on the U.S. economy.” He said he continues to “be convinced that the right policies will prevail, because I think we all share the same objective, which is a healthy and vibrant U.S. economy.”\nCarmakers have banked on using low-cost Mexican labor for small-car production, which has lower profit margins. Automakers, including the Detroit Three, have announced more than $24 billion in Mexican investments since 2010, according to the Center for Automotive Research.",

Click here to submit a Letter to the Editor , and we may publish it in print. \nThe next generation of Ford’s Expedition SUV is expected to be offered in two wheelbases, based on new spy photographs of the vehicle undergoing testing on public roads around Ford Motor Co.’s product development campus in Dearborn, Mich. Photo credit: JIM DUNNE \nThe next Expedition is scheduled to debut in 2017, possibly as a 2018 model. \nAnd two different sized grilles indicate a variety of engines will be offered. Photo credit: JIM DUNNE \nThe engine lineup for the Expedition will likely mimic the F-150 pickup: a base 3.5-liter, 2.7-liter twin turbo V-6 and a high output twin turbo 3.5-liter V-6. A 5.0-liter V-8 or a 3.0-liter V-6 diesel, the same motor used in Land Rover SUVs, is also expected to be available. \nTransmission choices are likely to be six-speed automatic standard with 10-speed automatic optional. Photo credit: JIM DUNNE \nStyling of the vehicles in the photos shows shorter rear doors cut directly into the rear wheel wells, a more rounded roof and a smaller rear window, says Jim Dunne, the spy photographer who captured the images. The side mirrors also appear new. \nOne of the engineering vehicles also has a rear muffler with twin exhausts, a first for Expedition. You can reach Richard Truett at Tags:",

      "title": "Ford CEO Mark Fields: We're on the \"Cusp of a Mobility Revolution\"",
      "text": "Ford CEO Mark Fields: We're on the \"Cusp of a Mobility Revolution\" \"We're attending the first major auto show in the world that's not about cars.\" Cars November 15, 2016 \nF ord CEO Mark Fields offered his vision for the future of the car company Tuesday, which involves transportation services — ride-sharing, autonomous technology, and even bicycles — that he hopes expands the automaker’s revenue greatly in the coming years while presumably offering everybody more ways to get around their city. \n“We’re attending the first major auto show in the world that’s not about cars,” Fields said, before adding that “we really are on the cusp of the mobility revolution.” \nStanding in front of a projection of the 2017 Ford GT super car, Fields said cars “are still very, very important,” but continued to acknowledge the company’s forays into other methods of transportation. “While we continue to make great vehicles they are no longer our entire game., he said. (On Monday, Ford debuted the EcoSport, its compact SUV for millennials ). \n“While we focus on making the car of tomorrow, we also focus on the city of tomorrow,” Fields told the assembled auto industry players and media during a Tuesday morning keynote at the Los Angeles Auto Show’s tech-focused media days, branded as Automobility LA. Ford sees all modes of transportation services as its future, even bicycle sharing programs. \n“There’s a lot of talk these days about artificial intelligence and at Ford our intelligence isn’t artificial, it’s human,” Fields said, attempting to calm any fears of creeping automation in factories . “What would a city look like if more people were using shared services instead of personally owned vehicles?” \nFields said the addition of transportation services could double current revenue from global car sales. He announced on Tuesday that Ford would partner with the Compact of Mayors , a group of city leaders headed by former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg. \n“We have created Ford’s City Solutions team,” Fields said. The partnership is in the works in San Francisco, and other cities will follow soon. \nOne part of Ford’s transporation solution is the San Francisco start-up Chariot , now part of the Ford mobility team. The app-based crowd-sourced shuttle service specializes in the “first mile, last mile” needs of commuters. It’s expanded to Austin, Texas and will be in more cities soon. \n“We’ll see substantial revenue opportunities to providing mobility solutions to millions commuters,” Fields said, noting that there is a “growing work force in several cities globally, many of whom do not own vehicles today or do business with Ford.” \nFields’ keynote opened the first full day of Automobility LA before the actual LA Auto Show kicks off on Friday. There’s an increased focus on battery-powered cars, autonomy, 3D printing, and big data during the run-up to the auto show, which has traditionally ranked behind bigger shows in past decades. But LA’s influence on the design industry and the number of design studios here has raised the show’s stature. \nIn August, Fields said that Ford will be “ mass-producing vehicles with full autonomy within five years,” specifically with an eye on ride-sharing services.

Ford favors “free and fair trade.” \nPresident-elect Donald J. Trump’s proposal to levy a 35% tariff on cars made in Mexico would hurt the U.S. economy, according to the head of Ford Motor Co. (IW 500/4) -- the target of the future president’s tariff talk. \n“A tariff like that would be imposed on the entire auto sector and that could have a huge impact on the U.S. economy,” Mark Fields, Ford’s CEO, told reporters following a speech at the AutoMobility conference in Los Angeles. Ford favors “free and fair trade.” \nTrump has criticized Ford for planning to move all its North American small car production to Mexico, where wages are 80% lower than in the U.S. \nOn the campaign trail, he threatened to slap Ford’s Mexican-built cars with a 35% tariff. \nHe also said he would terminate the North American Free Trade Agreement that allows goods to flow between Mexico, the U.S. and Canada without tariffs. \nFields said the company has been in touch with Trump’s transition team and that he sent a congratulatory letter to the president-elect. \nBy Keith Naughton and Jamie Butters Popular Now",

Freep.com: http://on.freep.com/2fuIEL6   Join the Conversation To   Ford CEO Fields: 35% tariff would hurt U.S. economy Brent Snavely , Detroit Free Press 1:03 p.m.   On the campaign trail, Trump frequently criticized Ford for deciding to move the production of small cars to Mexico. Buy Photo Ford CEO Mark Fields speaks at Ford Design Center in the Product Development Center in Dearborn on Thursday, December 10, 2015. (Photo: Ryan Garza, Detroit Free Press) Buy Photo \nLOS ANGELES — Ford CEO Mark Fields said Tuesday that a 35% tariff on cars and trucks imported from Mexico – a policy promoted by president-elect Donald Trump – would have a broad impact on the entire U.S. economy. \nFields, who delivered the keynote speech at the Los Angeles Auto Show this morning, spoke about Donald Trump for the first time since the businessman was elected to become the next president. \nOn the campaign trail, Trump frequently criticized Ford for deciding to move the production of small cars from the U.S. to Mexico, leading to a feud between the candidate and the automaker. Trump also has promised to bring manufacturing jobs back to the U.S. and has talked about imposing a 35% tariff on cars made in Mexico. \n\"A tariff like that would be imposed on the entire auto sector, and that could have a huge impact on the U.S. economy,\" Fields said. \nIn September, Fields appeared on CNN to say no jobs would be lost in the U.S. as it moves production of the Ford Focus and C-Max hybrids to Mexico. \nExperts also say a punitive tariff imposed on a single country would violate the rules of the World Trade Organization, a global body of 164 countries the U.S. joined in 1995. \nFields said Ford sent Trump a congratulatory letter after he was elected. \n\"We have had conversations with the transition team. I’ve sent a congratulatory letter to the president-elect, and we look forward to working with a new administration and the entire newly elected Congress,\" Fields said. \nStill, Fields emphasized that Ford is a global company and believes in free trade. Trump, in contrast, has said he will try to renegotiate NAFTA or pull the U.S. out of the three-nation trade agreement. Trump also oppresses the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a 12-nation trade agreement the U.S. signed earlier this year but has not been approved by Congress. \nFord was against the Trans-Pacific Partnership because the automaker said it lacked adequate currency manipulation rules. Fields suggested today that that is one area that the automaker and Trump could work together. \n\"I continue to be convinced that the right policies will prevail, because we all share the same objective, which is a healthy and vibrant U.S. economy,\" Fields said. \nOn Monday, Ford revealed a new EcoSport subcompact SUV that it has sold around the world since 2003 but never in the U.S. Ford plans to import the EcoSport into the U.S. from Chennai, India.",

      "text": "President-elect Donald J. Trump’s proposal to levy a 35 percent tariff on cars made in Mexico would hurt the U.S. economy, according to the head of Ford Motor Co. -- the target of the future president’s tariff talk.\n“A tariff like that would be imposed on the entire auto sector and that could have a huge impact on the U.S. economy,” Mark Fields, Ford’s chief executive officer, told reporters following a speech at the AutoMobility conference in Los Angeles. Ford favors “free and fair trade.”\nTrump has criticized Ford for planning to move all its North American small-car production to Mexico, where wages are 80 percent lower than in the U.S. During the campaign, he threatened to slap Ford’s Mexican-built cars with a 35 percent tariff. He also said he would terminate the North American Free Trade Agreement, which lets goods flow between Mexico, the U.S. and Canada without tariffs.\nFields said that the company has been in touch with Trump’s transition team and that he sent a congratulatory letter to the president-elect.\n“I continue to be convinced that the right policies will prevail, because I think we all share the same objective, which is a healthy and vibrant U.S. economy,” Fields said. “We expect to work very effectively and positively with the president-elect’s administration as well as the new Congress.”\nJobs Dispute During the presidential campaign, Ford pushed back on Trump’s assertions that the company was moving jobs to Mexico. The Wayne, Michigan, factory losing the Focus small car and C-Max hybrid will get new production of a Ranger pickup and revived Bronco sport utility vehicle, people familiar with the plans have said. Ford has said no jobs will be lost at the Michigan plant.\nFord Executive Chairman Bill Ford, great-grandson of the company’s founder, even met with Trump, but the candidate’s criticism of the automaker continued.\n“We are everything that he should be celebrating about this country,” Bill Ford said in September.\nFields said Tuesday at the conference, which is the kickoff to the Los Angeles Auto Show, that company officials have talked to Trump’s transition team and expect to be able to work with him as president.\n“We look forward to working with the new administration and the entire newly elected Congress,” Fields said. “We’re in constant communication.”",

Take a look through our coverage from the four days of press previews and keynotes, known as AutoMobility L.A., to see photos and analysis of the latest high-tech offerings. Nov. 15, 2016, 10:49 a.m. 'Here comes that punk. Alexa, lock my Elantra!' Russ Mitchell \nFreezing cold outside? Ice on the windshield? Tell Alexa to start up your Hyundai and set the defroster to 85. See that punk teenager with the skateboard headed toward your house again at night? Tell Alexa to lock the car door. \nHyundai and Amazon announced “Blue Link Skill for Amazon Alexa” which the home appliance voice recognition system can communicate with late-model Hyundais. \nHyundai, the Korean automaker, said the system will be integrated with its upcoming line of Prius-fighters, the Ioniq , which will be available as a hybrid, a plug-in hybrid, and an all-electric car. \nYou could tell your car to start charging, for example, when utility rates are lower. \nAmazon is also working with Ford and BMW on similar deals.

Chief Executive Mark Fields warned President-elect Donald Trump's proposal that placing high tariffs on automobiles and other products coming from outside the U.S. would have negative consequences for the auto industry and beyond. \nA steep tariff \"would be imposed on the entire auto sector and that could have a huge impact on the U.S. economy,\" Mr. Fields told reporters on Tuesday on the sidelines of the Automobility LA car show. \"I continue to be convinced that the right policies will prevail because I think we all share the same objective which is a healthy and vibrant U.S. economy.\" \nMr. Fields said the company will stick with plans to assemble cars in Mexico, which Mr. Trump has singled out as a serious problem for American workers. The executive said Ford has been in touch with Mr. Trump's transition team as the president-elect prepares to take office in January. \nIt was Mr. Fields first public appearance since Mr. Trump was elected to the White House after a campaign that often had Ford in its crosshairs for manufacturing its products outside the U.S. \nCriticism of Ford reflected a wider concern that the U.S. is losing well-paying manufacturing jobs to countries such as Mexico and China. Mr. Trump has said he would renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement that came into force in 1994 and has been widely criticized as encouraging the offshoring of U.S. jobs. \nMr. Trump has also vowed to impose steep tariffs on Ford if the Dearborn, Mich., auto maker carries out its plan to move assembly of its Focus compact car to Mexico from Wayne, Mich. The company has said the move won't result in American job losses. \nMr. Fields reiterated Ford plans to move forward with its Mexico plans that he said will make room for two new products at the U.S. factory. \nOn Monday night, at a party on Hollywood Boulevard near the Dolby Theatre, Ford unveiled the EcoSport SUV it plans to bring to the U.S. market in 2018. The model will be built in a factory in India that already makes the vehicle for other countries. \nWrite to Tim Higgins at Tim.Higgins@WSJ.com  161345ET   This article appears in: US Markets , Economy More from Dow Jones Business News",

      "text": "Ford CEO says production plans on track despite election Updated 11:07 am, Tuesday, November 15, 2016 DETROIT (AP) — Ford Motor Co. CEO Mark Fields says the presidential election won't change the company's plans to move small car production to Mexico. President-elect Donald Trump has repeatedly criticized Ford for moving production to Mexico. Trump wants to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement and has called for a 35-percent tariff on goods shipped from Mexico. In an interview with CNBC Tuesday, Fields said Ford is proceeding with its plan to move Focus car production from Michigan to a new plant in Mexico by 2018. He stressed that no jobs will be lost, since the Michigan plant will make two other vehicles. Fields also warned that a tariff would affect the entire industry — and autoworkers' profit-sharing checks — since many companies sell Mexican- and Canadian-made vehicles or parts.

      "text": "Mobile Apps Ford CEO says production plans on track despite election \nDETROIT (AP) - Ford Motor Co. CEO Mark Fields says the presidential election won't change the company's plans to move small car production to Mexico. \nPresident-elect Donald Trump has repeatedly criticized Ford for moving production to Mexico. Trump wants to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement and has called for a 35-percent tariff on goods shipped from Mexico. \nIn an interview with CNBC Tuesday, Fields said Ford is proceeding with its plan to move Focus car production from Michigan to a new plant in Mexico by 2018. He stressed that no jobs will be lost, since the Michigan plant will make two other vehicles. \nFields also warned that a tariff would affect the entire industry - and autoworkers' profit-sharing checks - since many companies sell Mexican- and Canadian-made vehicles or parts.

Trump wants to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement and has called for a 35-percent tariff on goods shipped from Mexico. \nIn an interview with CNBC Tuesday, Fields said Ford is proceeding with its plan to move Focus car production from Michigan to a new plant in Mexico by 2018.

CEO Mark Fields says the presidential election won't change the company's plans to move small car production to Mexico. President-elect Donald Trump has repeatedly criticized Ford for moving production to Mexico. Trump wants to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement and has called for a 35-percent tariff on goods shipped from Mexico. In an interview with CNBC Tuesday, Fields said Ford is proceeding with its plan to move Focus car production from Michigan to a new plant in Mexico by 2018. He stressed that no jobs will be lost, since the Michigan plant will make two other vehicles. Fields also warned that a tariff would affect the entire industry — and autoworkers' profit-sharing checks — since many companies sell Mexican- and Canadian-made vehicles or parts. Today's Deals ",

Auto Show 2016 live updates: Ford CEO announces 'We are on the cusp of a mobility revolution' Nov. 15, 2016, 11:23 a.m. \nThe Los Angeles Auto Show opens to the public Friday and ends Nov. 27. Take a look through our coverage from the four days of press previews and keynotes, known as AutoMobility L.A., to see photos and analysis of the latest high-tech offerings. Nov. 15, 2016, 11:23 a.m. With the ReachNow app, you can order up a ride in a BMW or Mini Russ Mitchell \nSteve Banfield, chief executive of BMW ReachNow, wants to make one thing clear. “We’re not just a ride-sharing service!” he said at the L.A. Auto Show. \nIt’s not competing with Uber, either. But it’s making rides in BMW and Mini cars a lot more accessible to people who don’t own them. \nStarting in December, in Seattle, users of the ReachNow smartphone app will be able to order up a ride in a BMW or share a car with a Mini owner through a peer-to-peer car sharing service. Starting early in 2017, they’ll be able to rent a BMW in Seattle for two to five days. \nThose programs will be expanded next to Brooklyn. Future cities were not announced. \nReachNow, a BMW subsidiary, also announced a “fleet-sharing” program at a Manhattan apartment building, the Solaire, where residents will have access to 3-series BMWs and all-electric BMW i3s, parked on premises, with plans to expand to other residential high-rises. \nThe intention is not to compete with Uber. It’s in large part a marketing campaign: “People will have a chance to get in a BMW or Mini,” Banfield said. Latest updates",

CEO Mark Fields says the presidential election won't change the company's plans to move small car production to Mexico.\nPresident-elect Donald Trump has repeatedly criticized Ford for moving production to Mexico. Trump wants to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement and has called for a 35-percent tariff on goods shipped from Mexico.\nIn an interview with CNBC Tuesday, Fields said Ford is proceeding with its plan to move Focus car production from Michigan to a new plant in Mexico by 2018. He stressed that no jobs will be lost, since the Michigan plant will make two other vehicles.\nFields also warned that a tariff would affect the entire industry - and autoworkers' profit-sharing checks - since many companies sell Mexican- and Canadian-made vehicles or parts.\n ",

      "text": "Ford CEO Says Production Plans on Track Despite Election By The Associated Press DETROIT  Nov 15, 2016, 2:03 PM ET 0 Shares Email Ford Motor Co. CEO Mark Fields says the presidential election won't change the company's plans to move small car production to Mexico . President-elect Donald Trump has repeatedly criticized Ford for moving production to Mexico. Trump wants to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement and has called for a 35-percent tariff on goods shipped from Mexico. In an interview with CNBC Tuesday, Fields said Ford is proceeding with its plan to move Focus car production from Michigan to a new plant in Mexico by 2018. He stressed that no jobs will be lost, since the Michigan plant will make two other vehicles. Fields also warned that a tariff would affect the entire industry — and autoworkers' profit-sharing checks — since many companies sell Mexican- and Canadian-made vehicles or parts. 0 Shares",
