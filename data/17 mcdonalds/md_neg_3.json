We've seen everything from Burger King's Mac n' Cheetos to KFC's chicken sandwich where the chicken acted as the buns, but this latest creation is unlike anything we've seen before. \nOn Nov. 10, McDonald's posted a photo to Facebook introducing the \"Sweety con Nutella.\" That's right, Nutella. \nThe new \"burger\" looks to be just be the hazelnut spread sandwiched between two buns. \nGONE TOO FAR? Burger King creates the newest fast food abomination: the Mac 'n Cheetos \nThe post describes the product as \"soft bread with a creamy, indulgent center,\" which at the very least sounds interesting. \nHowever, before you get super excited and start asking your local McDonald's when these will debut, you should know that it comes with a catch. \nThe product will only debut in Italy, and there is no word on whether or not it will make it's way to the states. \nTake a look through the gallery above to see other bizarre products fast food places have put out over the years.

      "text": "McDonald's Big Mac Get's New Sizes! posted by Jenelle Forrester - share \nAccording to Buzz Feed News, in early 2017, McDonald 's will offer two new versions of he iconic sand which which uses two all beef patties, special sauce, lettuce, cheese, pickles and onions on a sesame seed bun. The two new versions will include the \"Mac Jr.\" a miniaturized Big Mac which will use one 1/6 lb patty and the \"Grand Mac\" which will use two 1/6 lb. patties. The class Big Mac has two 1/10 lb burgers. \nI don't know about you all, but it seems as if McDonalds has brought back \"Super Size\" without calling it that. For those who aren't aware of \"Super Size\" it was a size option on McDonald's menus, for example small, medium, large or SUPER SIZE! \nBoth the \"Mac Jr.\" and \"Grand Mac\" were tested earlier this year in Ohio and Dallas which were both selected for being \"beef-centric areas\", said McDonald's Chef Mike Haracz. “It was time to launch something like this,” he told BuzzFeed News. The rollout requires adding 1/6 lb. patties to restaurant kitchens and a larger bun for the Grand Mac. \nCan't wait to see whether these two new beefy patties taste just as good! \nEmEZ says, Hardwork pays off!\" He is EmEZ, Radio Personality, Producer and Host. TheStar!EmEZ's natural personality makes him a perfect radio personality. He transformed his deep love of radio/music at an early age, falling asleep listening to radio fueled his dreams.

EmEZ's now mentor, Malikha Mallette, approached him and asked a question, \"What do you want to do wity your life?\" The answer was, \"I want to do what you do!\" The rest as they say is history.

      "text": "Google Plus McDonald has enjoyed the start to his new role (photo: Getty Images) \nNow several weeks into his new role as Assistant Head Coach, Neil McDonald has been afforded time to reflect upon the early stages of his Hull City career with Premier League clubs settling into the international break. \"The players are in a good frame of mind\" \nDespite a run of form that has seen just one win since August, McDonald stated that he is \"very much encouraged by what I have seen so far and the players are in a good frame of mind\" . Always a challenge in a new role, the experienced campaigner admitted \"I've enjoyed getting back into it and getting to know everybody\" . \nThe former Carlisle United and Blackpool manager is hoping to build upon his knowledge of the transition between promotion in the Championship and establishing a place within the top flight. McDonald recalled his experience with a certain London club alongside Sam Allardyce , stating \"the last time was with West Ham, who got relegated and then came straight back up again. I’m very much encouraged by what I have seen so far and the players are in a good frame of mind\" . The former number two for Big Sam (photo: Getty Images) \"We seem to have hit it off\" \nMcDonald also opened up about how Mike Phelan offered the job and how their relationship has developed over recent weeks. He admitted “the first conversation was on the phone and he invited me across for a chat and to watch a game\" . \nSince then McDonald believes “we seem to have hit it off. Mike has a wealth of experience and some great ideas so I’m looking forward to working alongside him\" . Phelan's assistant also hopes to lean upon his own knowledge and experience from a career built predominantly in England, but also after spells in Jordan and Sweden. He suggested \"it’s been an eventful few years in terms of coaching, but hopefully I’ve got that experience to offer towards us getting the results that we need\" .",

Beginning with a press conference during which Ahmad Armoush, Chairman of Armoush Tourism Investment Co. Ltd. – the exclusive owner of the McDonald’s franchise in Jordan – spoke about the past 20 years and laid out future plans, the celebration saw the attendance of thousands of McDonald’s customers and fans, and a number of media representatives. \nThe day-long celebration featured multiple games and attractions all centered on a carnival theme that appealed to all ages. Attendees enjoyed two special performances by none other than Ronald McDonald, live music, and a burger eating contest. The last half of the event was live broadcast around the Kingdom to listeners who were unable to attend, and included an interview with Ahmad Armoush, audience testimonials, and an exciting light show, and ended with the cutting of McDonald’s Jordan’s 20 th anniversary cake and a big fireworks show. Also during the event, the winners of the campaign raffle, offering large cash prizes of JD 20,000, 10,000, and 5,000, were announced. The lucky winners were Ibrahim Noufal, Jina Salama, and Walid Al Nas’a, respectively. \n“The event was a huge success and surpassed our expectations,” said Ahmad Armoush. “We were so pleased with the overwhelming number of dedicated McDonald’s fans that we have here in Jordan and were more than happy to welcome all of them to enjoy the day with us. I cannot think of anything more perfect to do on our 20 th anniversary than to celebrate it with the very people that made our success possible. We at McDonald’s Jordan thank all of our stakeholders -- employees, customers, partners, suppliers, and communities – for two decades filled with unforgettable memories and big smiles.” \nLooking to the future, Armoush continued, “We optimistically await what comes next for us as a company. We hope to even further strengthen our inseparable bond with the community, effect positive socioeconomic change, and welcome the endless happy faces that we see every day from kids and adults alike that eat with us.” \nThe big 20 th anniversary celebration came after an exclusive trip to Aqaba for media and social media influencers that was held on November 5-6. During the trip, attendees were taken scuba diving in the Red Sea, where they embarked on a thrilling underwater adventure to find a large McDonald’s logo and “20” sign at the bottom of the sea.",

      "text": "Good news, world — McDonald’s has singlehandedly saved this god awful year of election losses and celebrity deaths with the creation of the world’s first Nutella burger. The only thing is, you’ll have to travel to Italy to get your hands on one.\nBefore you all shriek in horror at the thought of a beef and chocolate combo, the ‘Sweety con Nutella,’ as it’s named in Italian, is actually made with a very thick wedge of the popular hazelnut spread sandwiched between two of the fast food giant’s buns. It doesn’t contain any meat.\nIt comes in a signature burger box, just like a Big Mac or a Quarter Pounder, and will be served in the chain’s cafes. It was announced on the McDonald’s Italy Facebook page last week with the message: “A soft sweetness has arrived that you will not be able to resist.” You can say that again.\nMeanwhile, in Asia, McDonald’s is serving a deep fried katsu burger .\n",

      "text": "Getty Image\nFor centuries, the elusive McDonald’s curiosity known simply as the McRib has frustrated fans of weird fast food sandwiches with its limited time status . Are they delicious or is the uncertainty of their existence what’s really mouthwatering? TOUGH QUESTIONS IN THESE TOUGH TIMES, NOVELTY MENU ITEM FANS!\nThe McRib has reemerged from suspended animation once again and this time McDonald’s has made our sauce-slathered lives easier by providing a helpful McRib app . As noted by Brand Eating , the McRib’s return is a “select locations” sort of deal, so if you’re in a McRib-friendly area, this is a tool you can use to alert your friends to your temporary stockpile of limited time sandwiches.\nHere’s the bubbly bit of prose McDonald’s has paired their new app:\nThe McRib is back! And this year, finding a McRib and sharing the love is easier and more fun than ever. With the official McDonald’s McRib Finder app, you can find the McRib at a participating McDonald’s nearby, then share it with your friends—all without leaving Messages.\nThe downside for McRib enthusiasts is that the app is currently only available as an iPhone and iPad option. Android users will have continue hunting for McRibs the same way they would in the 17th century\n(Via Brand Eating )\n",

Dubbed the “Sweety con Nutella”, this sweet treat is meat-free (thank goodness) and consists of the delish hazelnut spread piped in between two buns. Essentially, it’s like a Nutella pastry, I suppose? But at this point, the only place you can get it is Italy. \nJeremy Renner may be skipping out on Mission Impossible: 6 in order to film on Avengers: Infinity War –to which I say: sure, okay. (via Comics Alliance ) Spirited Away ‘s Hayao Miyazaki is interested in directing another anime feature. (via Comic Book Resources ) David Blaine proves he can still get people to freak out over magic tricks by appearing on The Tonight Show and messing with Jimmy Fallon and The Roots. Mark Zuckerberg denies that Facebook directly influenced the election –to which I say: s re , okay.

If you’re both of those things, you are right now racing that ass to your nearest McDonald’s Italia! Buzzfeed reports that they’ve debuted the Sweety Nutella burger! It’s a dessert burger that consists of a big heaping serving of Nutella, sandwiched between two sweet buns.\n\nReaction has obviously been mixed:\nRegali di @claac_ 💕 \nA photo posted by fran / 18 / 🍙 (@luiginafan) on Nov 11, 2016 at 11:25am PST \n\nThe reason why you can’t seem to find any vacation flights to Italy right now is because Nutella-loving people have booked every possible flight to the kicking boot-shaped country to scarf down some of its goodness. They’ll be taking pics of themselves eating their Sweety Nutella burgers while pretending to hold up the Leaning Tower of Pisa. Look for it to become a meme. Ciao Italia!\nCheck out some footage of the Sweety Nutella burger below.\n#sweetynutella #macdonalds #nutella #sweety \nA video posted by Filippo Crucitti (@filippo_crucitti) on Nov 11, 2016 at 12:17pm PST \n\nPic: Facebook",

We can feel the cavities forming from here. McDonald's Italy is now serving up a Nutella burger 0 Share: Up Next What a Trump presidency means for tech \nGot a sweet tooth? Can you feel it rotting? McDonald's Italy announced a Nutella burger on Thursday, and the internet is equal parts horrified and envious. \nIt's called Sweety con Nutella, which makes it seem as if it were both invented and named by a 9-year-old. And it's really more a dessert than a burger, though someone decided to bake a dark brown stripe into the brioche bun to make it look like a meaty patty. \nThough it's only available in Italy, chocoholics from all over are drooling on social media. \nBut as with everything, some folks have to point out that it's not exactly health food.",

      "text": "NBC’s ‘The Voice’ rankings: Billy Gilman, We McDonald, Sundance Head lead top 12   \nThe top 12 contestants on “ The Voice ” are for the first time going to be competing directly against one another starting on Monday, and for the most part, this means one thing above all else to us: A chance to see where all of these singers stack up against one another. We can say all we want things about Alicia Keys’ team being the best or Adam Levine making some strange choices aside from Billy Gilman, but none of that really matters. All that does are the votes at the end of the show. \nIf you look below, you can get our quick take now on some of the projections that we have for these contestants! We don’t have too much to go on in terms of results, but we can chart these with a criteria that includes performance quality, screen time, the popularity of similar singers before, and also the popularity of the coach working with them. \n12. Sa’Rayah (Team Alicia) – We do think that she’s a very solid singer, but at the same time she’s not who we would have selected if we were in Alicia’s shoes. Instead, our choice would’ve been to select here someone in Kylie Rothfield who had a chance to bring a variety of different genres to the show. Sa’Rayah may be forgotten in the midst of some similar acts. \n11. Josh Gallagher (Team Adam) – Our sentiment is the same here about Josh, even if the public actually saved him before Josh needed to. On this past episode, he was competing mostly against other team members. When he’s up against so many other male singers, especially doing country, will he really stand out? \n10. Courtney Harrell (Team Blake) – Talent-wise, she should be higher on this list. There are two things we worry about: Whether or not her coach will pick the right songs for her, and whether or not she is going to get a chance to have a coach who knows the right songs to pick for her. Sure, Blake’s worked with non-country singers before, but it’s been a while since he’s had great success in her genre of music. \n9. Christian Cuevas (Team Alicia) – As we said, we thought going into the lives that Alicia had a stacked team. We worry about some of the choices that were made there, though, and we also wonder about Christian’s ability to pick some current song choices that will really play well with the audience at home. \n8. Darby Walker (Team Miley) – We never would’ve imagined that Darby would need her coach’s help before being safe in the Life Playoffs; maybe we overrated her. The reality is that she’s someone people are either going to love or hate, and while that probably will help her for the first week or two, after that she could have some trouble. \n7. Brendan Fletcher (Team Adam) – Brendan is another major enigma at the moment for us, given that he needed Adam’s help to stay around in the competition, and yet he is one of the only two artists on the show with any iTunes traction last week. The latter is a promising sign, so we’ll see what happens next. \n6. Ali Caldwell (Team Miley) – A very good singer, but one we worry about in terms of getting the attention and focus she deserves. We’re not altogether sure that she’s had that over the course of the competition to date. \n5. Aaron Gibson (Team Miley) – In general, Miley’s problem is that we assumed going into the live shows that Darby was her slam-dunk; we weren’t quite sure about anyone else. Aaron does have the potential to be a finalist on this season, but for him it’s going to be about song choice and innovation. Otherwise, he could just blend in. \n4. Austin Allsup (Team Blake) – Country singers on Team Blake always have an edge. We figure it’s even more so when there are some people out there at least reasonably familiar with them. We can easily envision Austin in the finale; we just hope that he really pushes himself and does some surprising songs between now and then. \n3. Sundance Head (Team Blake) – The one reason we rank Sundance slightly ahead of Austin is because he’s already got some reality TV experience and a comfort level there. Even if you don’t know him from “American Idol,” he’s so easily recognizable that this is going to be something that works in his favor. \n2. We McDonald (Team Alicia) – Probably the most talented singer in the entire competition, and someone who’s got a unique name, personality, style, and plenty of airtime to boot. People will remember her, and if she delivers on what we know she’s capable of, it’s easy to envision a path now where she makes it all the way to the end of the show. \n1. Billy Gilman (Team Adam) – As good as We may be, we’d be complete idiots to go against the one guy with the biggest fan following already out there. Not only that, but he also charted better on iTunes than anyone out there, and has a very strong voice in his own right. It’d be silly to coin anyone else the favorite for now. \nWho do you think is in the best spot now? Be sure to share in the poll below! \nWant to get some other news right now on “The Voice”?

      "text": "  McDonald’s to test simpler plan for custom burgers Published: 11/14/16 @ 12:00 \nMcDonald’s to test simpler plan for custom burgers \nCHICAGO \nMcDonald’s has scrapped its “Create Your Taste” customized burger program and will instead test a mix-and-match meat and toppings plan that’s easier to manage. McDonald’s calls the new program, which will be tested nationwide in select markets including its hometown of Chicago, “Signature Crafted Recipes.” \nCreate Your Taste was a two-year-long test that brought make-your-own burger kiosks to select McDonald’s locations around the country. It was the first time McDonald’s experimented with a custom sandwich in an effort to compete with so-called “better burger” chains such as Five Guys that have grown in popularity. It also was an experiment in new ordering technology for the world’s largest burger chain. \nThe make-your-own-sandwich ordering kiosks generally received positive customer reviews online. Some customers even tested outlandish combinations and posted videos of their experiences on YouTube. \nFacebook tweaks race-based ad targeting policy \nNEW YORK \nFacebook says it will no longer allow advertisers to use ethnicity as a filter when it comes to targeting or hiding ads offering housing, employment or credit. \nThe changes come after ProPublica reported that , besides hobbies and interests, advertisers could exclude specific races from seeing their ads. This could be illegal in some circumstances, such as with housing ads. \nAlthough Facebook doesn’t actually ask users their race, the service can make a pretty good guess based on other information users share. \nLast week, Facebook said discriminatory ads have “no place” on the site. Rather, it says the filters are designed for reaching “multicultural audiences with more relevant advertising.” Race and ethnicity filters will still be allowed for ads that aren’t about housing, employment or credit. \nToyota to pay up to $3.4 billion to settle US truck lawsuit \nWASHINGTON \nToyota will pay up to $3.4 billion to settle a class-action lawsuit brought by U.S. pickup truck and SUV owners whose vehicles lacked adequate rust protection. \nCourt filings show that the settlement reached on October 31 covers 1.5 million vehicles, dealing a financial blow to the Japanese automaker whose trucks were subject to corrosion that could harm their structural integrity. \nThe settlement applies to Tacoma trucks made from 2005 to 2010, Sequoias from 2005 to 2008 and Tundras from 2007 to 2008. \nThe settlement estimates the value of replacing the frame at roughly $15,000 per vehicle. Under the settlement, Toyota will inspect vehicles for 12 years from their initial sales or lease date to decide if the owner is eligible for a replaced frame or reimbursement. \nWire reports  ",

Try Sweety with Nutella now: soft bread with a creamy, indulgent center!” \nThe product hasn’t been released in North America, but who’s to say it won’t make its way here. \nThe post has received more than 53,000 shares, 53,000 likes and 47,000 comments.

      "text": "Email McDonald's testing Sriracha Big Mac \nMcDonald's is spicing up its Big Mac. The fast-food chain is testing a Sriracha Big Mac in 126 stores in central Ohio starting today, a possible prelude to a nationwide rollout.The Big Mac sandwich, which will be sold through the end of 2016, is topped with McDonald's signature “Big Mac special sauce” infused with Sriracha, the fiery red Asian chili that's become ubiquitous around the country amid demand for bolder flavors.The sauce also will be available a la carte for French fry and Chicken McNuggets dipping.“We're always trying new creations and we wanted to innovate with an on-trend flavor like Sriracha to give our customers in Columbus a new and exciting taste,” said Oak Brook-based McDonald's Chef Mike Haracz, in a statement.The addition of the Sriracha Big Mac comes after the successful test of a supersized Big Mac called the Grand Mac and a downsized version called the Mac Jr., which debuted in the central Ohio this spring. Based on strong sales during the trial period, the chain plans to launch each product nationwide in early 2017 as a limited-time offer.It's the latest attempt by CEO Steve Easterbrook to modernize and transform the burger company. Since he took over as CEO in early 2015, the company has dropped menu items, digitized menu boards, simplified drive-thrus, overhauled packaging and vowed to clean up food by removing artificial ingredients.They've even tinkered with the chain's signature items, including its Chicken McNuggets, Egg McMuffins and Quarter Pounders.",

Customers will now be able to customize any item on the menu with spicy sriracha until the end of 2016 at participating locations, according to the burger chain.\nCentral Ohio is the only market that will be featuring the new burger.

      "text": "McDonald’s is making every hazelnut-chocolate lover’s dreams come true with its new Nutella burger.\nCalled “Sweety con Nutella,” the chocolatey “burger” doesn’t actually come with meat--instead, it’s a spread of Nutella between two hamburger buns. The item is served, however, in the chain’s traditional hamburger box, according to Eater . Unfortunately, only Italy’s Nutella lovers can test the item as it’s part of the country’s McCafe menu.\n\nA picture of the menu item has already gone viral on Facebook fb : users have shared it nearly 100,000 times and left over 70,000 reactions. Eater notes that many people in Italy have already made their way to McD’s to try the sweet new creation.\n \nThis isn’t the first time the fast-food chain has experimented with chocolate. In January, McDonald’s mcd introduced the “ McChoco Potato “--fries topped with chocolate sauce. However, the item was only available in Japan for a limited time. And as of now, its not clear if the United States will get to taste the Sweety con Nutella.",

Will you be trying it? https://t.co/uKVV8nfRe6 pic.twitter.com/SoXMFoEl4U October 28thFavorite Foods:Any veggies, pizza and even though I'm a vegetarian, every once in a while, I order the biggest slab of prime rib on the menu (medium rare)Things I Hate:Rude people, uncomfortable shoes and wet lettuce (I'm a big salad person and if the lettuce hasn't been properly dried, it makes the dressing watered down and the entire salad gets soggy..GROSS!)Favorite Bars:I don't have a favorite, but I do enjoy a good dive bar. Pool tables and dart boards are always a plus, oh- and the music should never be too loud unless there's a live band or it's a bar with a dance floor. I mean, seriously, why should we have to listen to some crappy old song blaring over the speakers when all I really want to do is hear the the conversation at the table. Then again I do wear headphones everyday for work, so my hearing is probably less then fabulous.Favorite Country Artists:Gary Allan. I saw him before I was working in country music, so I didn't really want to go. Turns out the people who dragged me in ended up wanting to leave early, but I was loving the music so much, I stayed at the concert by myself. It was awesome! Also, I'd like to add Brad Paisley and Sugarland to the list...LOVE THEM!Something You Might Not Know About Me:Growing up in International Falls, MN, my family actually lived on an island in the summer. It's true. There was no TV, which is why I fell in love with radio, I listened non-stop. We had to take a boat across the lake everytime we wanted to go into town. It was a great way to spend the summers, that is, until I started caring about what my hair looked like- all summer I sported the \"wind blown\" look! To this day I can make a bonnet/wind protector helmet out of any camouflage coat, pants or vest you can throw at me.Confession:I'm a speed walker. For anyone who doesn't know what that REALLY is, you're probably saying \"so what\"? But for those who've witnessed how truly idiotic it looks, let's just say, \"you know what I'm talking about\". I get laughed at and taunted on a daily basis. Contact ",

      "text": "McDonald's Italy via Facebook Like us on Facebook \nFor Nutella fans in Europe, there’s now a new way to consume the chocolatey hazelnut spread: slathered between two burger buns. As Business Insider reports, the “Sweety con Nutella” is the latest concoction on the menu at McDonald’s Italy. \nThe item looks like a burger at first glance, but fortunately beef has been left out of the recipe. The official McDonald’s Italy Facebook page describes the fast food treat as “soft bread with a creamy, indulgent center.” \nInstead of serving the product alongside traditional burgers over hot food counters, it will be available at McCafés. The post doesn’t specify how much customers will be paying for the glorified Nutella sandwich, but based on the 75,000 \"likes\" it has received so far, plenty of people are eager to give it a try. This isn’t McDonald’s first bold attempt to mix sweet with savory: A few years ago, the fast food giant experimented with bubble-gum flavored broccoli aimed at kid consumers. (It didn't last long.) Time will tell if their latest endeavor has more success.",

      "text": "[Photo: Paul J. Richards / AFP/Getty Images] Intrepid McRib hunters are using a ridiculous new iPhone app to track down the elusive, limited-edition mystery meat sandwich that's beloved by many and feared by some.\nHere's the description of \"McDonald's McRib Finder\" via the App Store:  \n\"The McRib is back! And this year, finding a McRib and sharing the love is easier and more fun than ever. With the official McDonald’s McRib Finder app, you can find the McRib at a participating McDonald’s nearby, then share it with your friends—all without leaving Messages.\"  \nOk, sharing McRib locations does sound kind of pathetic, but McRib fans are hardly a prideful bunch. While it may be easier than ever to find one, skepticism still endures regarding its actual ingredients. Investigative efforts over the years have revealed that despite its oblong shape, the McRib is definitely (mostly)  pork-based .\nPerhaps its best not to dwell on the sandwich's precise makeup. It is  2016  after all, and we've got more important things to do than scrutinize mutant fast food abominations. \nIn the meantime, watch this maniacal genius build and consume a leaning tower of McRibs in the immortal video above.  \nh/t: Uproxx ",

Customers will now be able to customize any item on the menu with spicy sriracha until the end of 2016 at participating locations, according to the burger chain. \nCentral Ohio is the only market that will be featuring the new burger. The region will gather valuable feedback from consumers to determine whether the sandwich will expand to restaurants nationwide. Share this: ",

Unfortunately the decadent sandwiches are only available in Italy.\nDubbed the “Sweety con Nutella,” the new sandwich features Nutella spread between two hamburger buns and comes in a cardboard box similar to the hamburger containers.\nMcDonald’s Italy posted a photo of the new treat on Facebook Thursday. The post has been shared almost 100,000 times.\n“A soft sweetness has arrived that you will not be able to resist.

      "text": "McDonald's is testing a Sriracha Big Mac in the Columbus, Ohio, area, the latest attempt to spice up sales of its most famous sandwich.\nThe test is expected to run through the end of the year, but might be extended to other markets depending on the response. The sandwiches feature the traditional Big Mac sauce mixed with a kick of the Thai pepper-and-garlic sauce. McDonald's also is testing the Big Mac sauce with Sriracha in a dipping container for fries and chicken nuggets.\nThe Sriracha Big Mac sauce also is available in another test on the West Coast — through McDonald's new customized burger offering, which it calls \"Signature Crafted Recipes.\" That test includes about 600 California restaurants.\nSince the mid-1950s, McDonald's has been synonymous with burgers and fries in the U.S. Now it has more than 36,000 stores in 120 countries. Here's what you can find at Mickey D's around the world.\nMcDonald's is sparring with \"better burger\" competitors for a share of a growing young customer base. Only 1 in 5 millennials, now the largest generation, have tried the Big Mac, according to a report in The Wall Street Journal last month.\nMcDonald's has been tinkering with the Big Mac in an attempt to encourage more diners to order the double-decker sandwich. The world's largest burger chain, which is based in Oak Brook, also tested Big Macs in different sizes — the Grand Mac and the Mac Jr. — in Central Ohio earlier this year. Those sandwiches will debut on menus nationwide next year.\nsbomkamp@chicagotribune.com \nTwitter @SamWillTravel \n  McDonald's",

      "text": "These 7 Countries Have No McDonald's Locations posted by Michael Harthorne - share \n\n( NEWSER) - McDonald's is currently fighting for its right to serve Big Macs near two Italian landmarks, but the Telegraph reports that 10 countries have already won their burger battle against Mickey D's. A sampling: Bermuda: The island prohibits non-local fast-food restaurants, though there was a McDonald's on a US Naval Air Station there for 10 years. Iran: The only Iranian McDonald's shut down after the 1979 revolution. There is, however, a knock-off restaurant called Mash Donald's. Iceland: McDonald's left after the financial crash. The final McDonald's burger served in Iceland is preserved in a glass case for some reason. \nPhoto: Getty Images",

The announcement of the \"Sweety con Nutella\" on the restaurant's Italian Facebook page late last week caused an online frenzy. Before panic could set in, it became clear that the \"burger\" is, in fact, meatless. It consists of only a bun filled with Nutella. By midday Monday, the Facebook post had been shared more than 90,000 times and received more than 73,000 comments. The burger will cost two euros and be served at all 540 McDonald's and McCafés in Italy, according to a press release. \"Sweety is the sweetest burger ever sold at McDonald's,\" read the press release. Social media users from across the world rejoiced over the fast food chain's newest menu addition. But many were disappointed it's not yet offered outside of Italy. McDonalds is trying to save 2016. Their idea: A Nutella Burger. pic.twitter.com/cJvpPY7vOC — Tobias 🐼 Schneider (@vanschneider) November 14, 2016 Why did I ever leave #Italy ?

      "text": "McDonald’s Unveiled a Nutella-Stuffed Burger, and People Are Freaking Out Thank God there's no meat inside. Jackson Connor , Maggie McGlinchy Image via Flickr/Brian Cantoni, Frédéric BISSON \nIt’s no secret that the fast-food industry jumped the shark a long, long time ago. Somewhere between KFC’s Double Down and Burger King’s Mac ‘n Cheetos , the normal laws of nature no longer applied to the world’s chain restaurants. The most recent trend is stuffing chocolate and sugar into traditionally savory items ( e.g. Taco Bell’s Kit Kat-filled “Chocodilla” ) and now McDonald’s is getting in on the action, testing a “Sweety con Nutella” at McCafés Italy. \nFalling victim to Nutella’s sweet siren song, the Sweety con Nutella is, essentially, a burger with a hearty helping of hazelnut cocoa spread slathered between two buns. \nMercifully, there’s no actual meat in McDonald’s new item, but the Sweety con Nutella does seem to go to great lengths to appear as if it’s a real hamburger. According to Brand Eating , the dish comes in a standard clamshell box, and features a brown strip along the exterior that makes look like a burger is tucked inside. The Sweety con Nutella is also baked with the chocolate spread inside, which gives the burger “a bit of a crust at the edges and makes it a little like a beef patty,” according to Brand Eating . \nAs Eater notes , the announcement of the item caught fire on social media over the weekend. The Facebook post unveiling the Sweety con Nutella has garnered nearly 93,000 shares, 75,000 likes, and 74,000 comments, primarily in Italian. \n“A soft sweetness has arrived that you will not be able to resist,” the description of the item reads. “Try Sweety with Nutella now: soft bread with a creamy, indulgent center!” \nOnline, customers seem conflicted over the confounding new menu item. \n“You screwed me the idea, how will we deal with this? I'm angry?” one Facebook user wrote, according to a translation. “Come get one and make peace,” McDonald’s offered serenely. \nCan’t really argue with that.",

      "text": "The McRib is back at McDonald’s again, and here’s how you can find one Kenya Foy Pin it Share More After all these years, we still have no idea what is up with the one-food vanishing act that is the McDonald’s McRib, but it’s back and *sings* we know where you can find one! Eater reports that like last year, this exciting McRib news has an upside and a downside. Obviously, the bright side is that the McRib has once again blessed us with its presence, and with the help of a free McRib locator app (free on iTunes for iOS users), it can be yours for a reasonably small price. However, McRibs are only available in select locations and for a limited time. Well, that’s a hard, McRib-like pill to swallow. As Brand Eating notes, the McRib app allows you to send directions to your friends to help them find the closest participating location, but when it comes to the last available McRib and your friendship, we advise you to make the wise choice. Seriously people, McRibs are obviously popular, but whatever you do, don’t let a sandwich come between you and your bestie.",

And God opened up the skies and asked \"Why?\" Nov 14th, 2016 Photo: Ullstein Bild (Getty) \nListen, Americans love stuffing their face with fast food. I mean, some dude in Arizona actually pulled over at an In-N-Out while being chase by cops. And this woman completely lost her mind when she learned the Subway that she at was out of meatballs subs . So obviously we love food, which is why we are gross and overweight. \nBut can someone please explain to me why McDonald’s has decided to cover their burger buns in Nutella? I’m serious. Someone please explain this to me because I’m completely lost (as usual). Photo: Facebook \nThis bizarre and gross burger is happening in Italy, and they are calling it their “Sweety with Nutella” burger. Oh God. “Get a soft sweetness which you cannot resist. Try sweety with Nutella: soft bread with a heart of creamy sweet nutella!” they explain. Photo: Facebook \nAnd this person on Twitter probably feels the same way the majority of people feel about this new terrible creation. \nAlthough, since we are disgusting Americans it is only a matter of time until we see this in America with “extra Nutella.”",

The fun (but crudely named) This is why you’re fat used to collate the most outrageous food combinations that humans splice together. McDonald’s latest dessert, available only in Italy, is called the Sweety con Nutella , and has the shape and soft buns of a regular burger, but instead of a uniform slab of beef in the middle, it has a big gooey center of Nutella hazelnut and cocoa spread. This carb-heavy feast would surely get a place on the This is why you’re fat Reddit , if not the original site. A video posted by Filippo Crucitti (@filippo_crucitti) on Nov 11, 2016 at 12:17pm PST Like the regular McDonald’s burger, the Sweety con Nutella is smaller than it appears in pictures, though it still finds enough room to fit 256 calories per serving. If you want to look on the positive side of its nutritional info sheet, the treat does provide 1.9 grams of dietary fiber, so if you devour 13.2 Sweetys, you’d reach your daily fiber intake goal as determined by the American Heart Association . \nÈ arrivata una soffice dolcezza a cui non saprete resistere. Provate subito Sweety con Nutella: morbido pane con un cuore di cremosa golosità! Posted by McDonald's on Thursday, November 10, 2016 Judging by the overwhelmingly positive reception that the Sweety con Nutella has received on McDonald’s Facebook page, it’s not completely unreasonable to think it might make its way out of Italy and to other chocolate-loving places (which is basically the whole rest of the world).

A man in Texas recently got the ball rolling on the 2016 season by handing out money at a McDonald’s. \nCBS DFW reports that a regular customer of a Fort Worth McDonald’s handed out $100 bills to unsuspecting workers, asking for nothing in return. \nThe incident, which was caught on the store’s security cameras, shows the man walking up to employees and handing them cash. \nAt one point, a cashier can be heard declaring “Oh my God,” after receiving a bill. \nAn employee of the man — who does not want recognition for his good deed — tells CBS DFW that the act was the result of several factors: he had recently been diagnosed with cancer and had witnessed a fellow customer fall on hard times. \n“You could tell it blessed their day,” the man’s employee says. “They didn’t come in there [to work] thinking that was going to happen that day… and that was the best part about it.” \nIn all, CBS DFW reports that the man left enough cash for all 33 employees at the restaurant, even for those who were not working at the time. \nStaff at the restaurant are putting together a thank you card for the man.

      "text": "Image courtesy of Alan Rappa \nNovember 14, 2016 2:00 pm EST By Laura Northrup @lnorthrup elusive sandwiches McRib apps technology mcdonald's fast food pork-like objects \nHave you ever wanted to invite a friend out for a McRib, but aren’t sure where they’re available? This is probably an extremely rare problem, but McDonald’s has solved it nevertheless with a new app. The bad news: it’s only available for iPhone so far, and it’s not especially useful. \nThe app installs inside iMessage, the text-messaging app for iPhones and iPads, allowing users to find their nearest McRib, then invite a friend to go eat it. Users can also send McRib-themed “stickers” when they have the McRib app-within-an-app open. \nThis is a big deal, since normally McRib-hunters have to depend on crowdsourced data to find the sandwich. Consumerist tested the app, and found that it has one major flaw: it only searches for McRibs around the area where you and your phone are at that moment, and not the spot where the friend you’re texting is, or somewhere you plan to be in the future.

      "text": "Source: Thinkstock November 14, 2016: Markets opened higher Monday but the Trump rally cooled off after it appeared that it was off to another roaring start. Tech stocks continue getting beaten up while the financial and real estate sectors performed best today. WTI crude oil for December delivery settled at $43.49 a barrel, up 0.2% for the day after dropping to $42.20 earlier in the day. December gold dropped 0.2% on the day to settle at $1,221.70. Equities were headed for a mixed close before the bell as the DJIA traded up XX% for the day, the S&P 500 traded up XX%, and the Nasdaq Composite traded down XX%. The DJIA and the S&P 500 are trading less than 0.1% on either side of the break-even line, so the final tally could be different after the bell rings.\nThe DJIA stock posting the largest daily percentage gain ahead of the close Monday was UnitedHealth Group Inc. (NYSE: UNH) which traded up 4.12% at $152.45. The stock’s 52-week range is $107.51 to $152.92, and the high was posted late this afternoon. Trading volume was 30% above the daily average of around 3.4 million. The company had no specific news Monday.\nMcDonald’s Corp. (NYSE: MCD) traded up 3.35% at $118.05. The stock’s 52-week range is $109.60 to $131.96. Volume of about 5.5 million was about 20% above the daily average of around 4.6 million shares. The fast-food giant had no specific news.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE: JPM) traded up 3.16% at $79.11. The stock’s 52-week range is $52.50 to $80.44, a new high set earlier this morning. Volume was about 2.5 times the daily average of around 15.4 million shares. Another good day for financial stocks.\nAmerican Express Co. (NYSE: AXP) traded up 2.75% at $72.44. The stock’s 52-week range is $50.27 to $73.35. Volume was about 20% above the daily average of around 4.7 million shares.

The fast-food chain now has a Nutella burger which is a bun filled with the hazelnut spread. \nFrom the looks of it, it's only avaible in Italy for now. \nPhoto: Getty ON AIR: Weekdays 2PM-6PM Angie Martinez is recognized as one of the most influential personalities in popular culture and multi-media. Originally known as “The Voice of New York,” Angie’s nearly 20 years of on-air hosting experience has led her to become the media trailblazer she is today: multimedia host, spokeswoman, actress, recording artist, entertainment personality, author and philanthropist. Known for her signature laid back style of interviewing, Angie is well respected — and praised — for her unique ability to get up-close and personal with larger-than-life personalities. Her storied experience and poise on the airwaves while interviewing such global icons as Bill & Hillary Clinton, Derek Jeter, Spike Lee, JAY Z and Beyoncé resulted in Martinez adding Special NY Correspondent for Extra TV to her current scope of work, where she has (so far) worked alongside Oprah Winfrey, Lady Gaga, Robert DeNiro and more. In addition to her professional work across the media landscape, Angie has become a passionate cultural voice for her community and fan base through HealthyLatinEating.com, which she founded in 2014 to share her love for — and support of — healthy Latin cuisine. And most recently, Angie dedicated herself to training for and completing the 2014 TCS New York City Marathon in support of The PitCCh In Foundation, where her team raised over $200,000 to benefit inner city youth. Fans can tune into The Angie Martinez Show on New York’s Power 105.1, weekdays from 2pm - 6pm, and on Miami’s The Beat 103.5, middays from 10am–2pm. Fans can also access The Angie Martinez Show through iHeartMedia.com and the iHeartMedia app. Contact ",

      "title": "Pharrell Williams Talks New Hu Adidas Line: Serving Your Mind and Body While Being 'Cool as F—'",
      "text": "Pharrell Williams was an admittedly lazy employee mopping McDonald's floors as a teen in Virginia Beach, Va. And though he loved snacking on McNuggets more than he actually enjoyed the job, he does have fond memories of what he bought with the money he earned. \"I saved up my first check from working at McDonald's to buy a discounted pair of Adidas,\" recalls the 43-year-old acclaimed producer and designer. \"I'll never forget, they were the red and gold Instincts. After that was a [Los Angeles] Lakers-esque mustard and purple low-top pair. I didn't have enough money to buy clothes, so my mom still had to chip in and buy my clothes for the school year.\"\nFor every sentence that Williams utters while nestled here in the corner of the Adidas booth at the first annual ComplexCon - the expo set in Long Beach, Calif., that showcases and aligns music with fashion and pop culture - an audience of his fans and followers grows by two to four people. All are either trying to eavesdrop or aim to linger long enough to snag a picture. Amazingly, Williams keeps his focus on the conversation at hand and his eyes (hidden under white Chanel sunglasses) away from the 50 locked on him.\n\"I never ever dreamed in a million years that I would end up here,\" he says. Today, the kid who scraped together his cash for Adidas kicks is now promoting clothes and sneakers from his Hu collection , which is produced through his now two-year-old partnership with Adidas Originals. \"It's been crazy, having a brand with Adidas and doing things collaboratively with them,\" Pharrell says as he shakes his head in disbelief. Then he lists the good company he's in at Adidas: \"Kanye [West], Stella McCartney, Jeremy [Scott], Yohji [Yamamoto].\"\nRead more: Hollywood's Battles for the Best Bar Mitzvah: $5M Budgets, Justin Bieber and Camels\nWilliams' latest line is Hu Holiday, out in stores Thursday. It's the second iteration of Hu, which dropped at the end of September. This time, pieces that range from bucket hats to backpacks, tennis skirts to track jackets feature images of geometric triangle motifs and Japanese Katakana all-over prints.\nOverall, Williams' goal for Hu is simple: Galvanize. Throughout his more than 20-year career, Williams has been known as a purveyor of cool, seemingly able to make whatever he's wearing suddenly an \"It\" brand (the Smokey the Bear hat , for example) and providing the Midas touch to whichever artist he produced music for. Now his objective is to attach a greater message to his apparel. Pieces from the September line, which are still available online starting at $70, feature the phrase \"Human Race\" translated in English, French and Japanese languages on them.\nA photo posted by Pharrell Williams (@pharrell) on Nov 10, 2016 at 1:05pm PST\n\"There was an opportunity to use this moment - this agreement between Adidas and myself - to do something for other people,\" Williams explains, \"while we made creative, interesting, cool technology that services the body. That's what HU is. HU [stands for] Health Ultimatum. [I'm asking,] 'How can we strive for betterment in our work?' That's why you see all the different colors and languages. We're ultimately trying to bring people together.\"\nWhile crediting Adidas' Global Category Director, Statement Collaborations Rachel Muscat, who is sitting to his left, for bringing him on board, Williams says they're trying to promote messages of unity without \"sounding preachy. It can also just look cool as f - . It can feel cool as f - . It can sound cool as f - . That's what we're doing. What can I do to make your life better for your mind body and soul? And I'm not talking granola and shit. I'm talking about cool. Cool is healthy.\"\nAs far as ideal customers, Williams isn't targeting any specific race or age group, he says while scrunching his face in admonishment of such monotonous boardroom speak.\n\"We don't make anything for demographics as much as we make things for ambitions,\" Williams elaborates. \"If you've got the ambition to just do better, this is for you. [Hu] is not gender-specific. It's not sexually orientated. It's just for human beings with ambitions of better days.\"\nThis article first appeared on Billboard.com.",

      "text": "If you prefer to drink your Coca-Cola under Mickey D&apos;s golden arches, you&apos;re not alone. In fact, there&apos;s a reason why the Coca-Cola from McDonald&apos;s tastes better than it does at any other fast food chain—and it&apos;s not a secret recipe or added sugar. In a statement McDonald&apos;s shared on their website , the chain revealed, \"There are many reasons the Coca-Cola tastes so great at McDonald’s. We simply follow the guidelines set by Coca-Cola and take steps to ensure it tastes the same as when you buy it in a bottle.\" Well that&apos;s simple enough!\nThe statement continues, \"The water and Coca-Cola syrup are pre-chilled before entering our fountain dispensers with the ratio of syrup set to allow for ice to melt. We also keep our fountain beverage system cold so your drink can always be at the peak of refreshing. In order to ensure our drinks are always meeting a gold standard, we have proper filtration methods in place.\"\nAnd on a less obvious note, McDonald&apos;s straws also enhance your tasting experience. They explain, \"It’s slightly wider than a typical straw, so all that Coke taste can hit all your tastebuds.\" Ok, that part blows our mind a little bit... and makes us really thirsty. Could anyone else go for a cup right about now? We&apos;ll meet you under the arches.",

      "text": "CHICAGO -- McDonald's is testing a Sriracha Big Mac in the Columbus, Ohio, area, the latest attempt to spice up sales of its most famous sandwich.\nThe test is expected to run through the end of the year, but might be extended to other markets depending on the response. The sandwiches feature the traditional Big Mac sauce mixed with a kick of the Thai pepper-and-garlic sauce. McDonald's also is testing the Big Mac sauce with Sriracha in a dipping container for fries and chicken nuggets.\nThe Sriracha Big Mac sauce also is available in another test on the West Coast -- through McDonald's new customized burger offering, which it calls \"Signature Crafted Recipes.\" That test includes about 600 California restaurants.\nMcDonald's is sparring with \"better burger\" competitors for a share of a growing young customer base. Only 1 in 5 millennials, now the largest generation, have tried the Big Mac, according to a report in The Wall Street Journal last month.\nMcDonald's has been tinkering with the Big Mac in an attempt to encourage more diners to order the double-decker sandwich. The world's largest burger chain, based in suburban Chicago, also tested Big Macs in different sizes -- the Grand Mac and the Mac Jr. -- in Central Ohio earlier this year. Those sandwiches will debut on menus nationwide next year.\n(c)2016 Chicago Tribune\nVisit the Chicago Tribune at www.chicagotribune.com\n ",

REUTERS/Mike Blake/Files Chicago Tribune Nov 14, 2016 at 3:56 pm | Print View \nCHICAGO — McDonald’s is trying a Sriracha Big Mac in the Columbus, Ohio, area, the latest attempt to spice up sales of its most famous sandwich. \nThe test is expected to run through the end of the year, but might be extended to other markets depending on the response. The sandwiches feature the traditional Big Mac sauce mixed with a kick of the Thai pepper-and-garlic sauce. \nMcDonald’s also is testing the Big Mac sauce with Sriracha in a dipping container for fries and chicken nuggets. \nThe Sriracha Big Mac sauce also is available in another test on the West Coast — through McDonald’s new customized burger offering, which it calls Signature Crafted Recipes. That test includes about 600 California restaurants. \nMcDonald’s is sparring with “better burger” competitors for a share of a growing young customer base. Only one in five millennials — now the largest generation — have tried the Big Mac, according to a report in the Wall Street Journal last month. \nMcDonald’s has been tinkering with the Big Mac in an attempt to encourage more diners to order the double-decker sandwich. \nThe world’s largest burger chain, based in suburban Chicago, also tested Big Macs in different sizes — the Grand Mac and the Mac Jr. — in Central Ohio earlier this year. Those sandwiches will debut on menus nationwide next year. Your next Business articles",

      "text": "TAMPA, Fla. (WFLA) — McDonald’s of Tampa Bay introduced two new Mac sandwiches – the Mac Jr. and the Grand Mac.\nThe Florida region is one of the first to offer the new sandwiches to consumers, ahead of the nationwide release in 2017.\nThe twist on the iconic burger allows customers to enjoy the great Big Mac flavor in a junior and grand size.\nThe Grand Mac is made with 60% more beef for a total of one-third pound and iconic special sauce served on a larger sesame seed bun. The Mac Jr. is a single-layer Big Mac that’s easier to eat on the go. The 100% pure beef patty is bigger and packs in all the flavor of the Big Mac without the middle bun.\nAll three sandwiches are crafted with shredded lettuce, signature Big Mac sauce and melty cheese. In Florida, all Grand Mac, Mac Jr. and Big Mac buns are baked at the Turano Bakery in Orlando, Fla.\n \n“We carefully created the Grand Mac and Mac Jr. to innovate on the classic Big Mac,” said McDonald’s Chef Mike Haracz. “There’s an emotional connection to the Big Mac sandwich. The Big Mac is a famous and iconic American food. For many, it’s a treat that brings happiness and conjures up a nostalgic connection, especially for those people for whom Big Mac was their first ‘grown up’ burger.”\nShare your experiences eating the new McDonald’s burger with us on WFLA News Channel 8’s Facebook page. \nhttp://wx.wfla.com/oembed/app_promo/app_dl.html ",

      "text": "\nWe McDonald definitely took fans there with “Take Me To Church” by Hozier. The live playoffs are upon us as The top 12 hopeful artists compete to come out on top on The Voice. This time they will have to convince not only a potential coach but America to choose them. \nThe name Wé is Kenyan for “diligence,” which is something that Wé has had her entire life. Her father helped her get into vocal lessons at the Harlem School of the Arts, which she still attends after school and on weekends. Wé has performed at Lincoln Center, Carnegie Hall and, most recently, at the Apollo Theater. Although Wé has always found her place with music, she struggled to fit in at school. Kids teased her for her high-pitched voice and thick glasses, but she stuck it out and slowly things got better. Now she embraces her differences and is hoping her uniqueness will help her stand out on The Voice.\nThe top 12 hopeful artists competing on NBC’s reality competition series will have some southern comfort from five-time CMA Entertainer of the Year, Garth Brooks, on Monday’s episode. Share with us who you liked during the live playoffs in the comments section. Whose performance do you think was better? Who do you think will ultimately win the competition?\nThe Voice Social Media Reactions She slays my life❤️❤️❤️❤️ #TheVoice @we_mcdonald \n— Rachel (@RachelsArrts) November 15, 2016 \n\nAnd just like that @we_mcdonald transforms the room @NBCTheVoice . #VoiceTop12 \n— Diane Norris (@thisDianeNorris) November 15, 2016 \n\n@NBCTheVoice @aliciakeys Wè is the winner. #VoiceTop12 #TeamAlicia \n— Autumn Breeze (@AutumnFreedom) November 15, 2016 \n\n@we_mcdonald WOW!

She is so awesome. #TheVoice #VoiceTop12 \n— Rikki Champagne (@rikki_champagne) November 15, 2016 \n\nWhere there's a will, there's a @we_mcdonald #UnforgetableWe you rocked it tonight! ❤️ @aliciakeys bringing it on #TeamAlicia #VoiceTop12 \n— Gail Dickert (@enlightenedish) November 15, 2016 \n\nSuperstars Miley Cyrus and Alicia Keys join coaches Adam Levine and Blake Shelton and host Carson Daly this season. For the first time, a pair of female coaches will command the red chairs for NBC’s immensely popular musical competition series. The show’s innovative format features five stages of competition: the first begins with the blind auditions, followed by the battle rounds, the knockouts, the live playoffs and, finally, the live performance shows.\nIn the final live-performance phase of the competition, the Top 12 artists compete each week against each other during a live broadcast. The television audience votes to save their favorite artists. The three artists with the lowest number of votes are eligible for the “Instant Save.” These artists each perform a new song that represents why they should earn the save. Then, America has the opportunity to save their favorite performer by tweeting #VoiceSave along with the artist’s name. The singers with the lowest number of votes are sent home each week. In the end, one is named “The Voice” and receives the grand prize of a recording contract.\nPhoto Credit: Source \n",

      "text": "McDonald’s is testing out a Sriracha Big Mac, so there is some good in the world It’s been a rough few weeks, but as Aaron Eckhart said in The Dark Knight, “The night is darkest just before the dawn.”\nAnd dawn is coming, my friends.\nMcDonald’s is currently testing out Sriracha Big Macs at 126 stores around Columbus, Ohio. In addition to the new take on the classic double-decker sandwich, stores are also offering Big Mac Sriracha dipping sauce for fries or Chicken McNuggets — or for rubbing all over your body (I added that last part, but feel free to use my idea). The new products will stay on Columbus area menus through the end of the year.\nShutterstock McDonald’s also tested the dipping sauce and various Sriracha sandwiches at locations in Los Angeles, San Diego, and Seattle earlier this year.\nI may or may not currently be looking up flights to Columbus to try one of these.\nThe post McDonald’s is testing out a Sriracha Big Mac, so there is some good in the world appeared first on HelloGiggles .",
