      "text": "\nWhen Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life premieres on Netflix this Friday, some fans will inevitably skip to the end of the final episode. This act is not one inspired by some sort of When Harry Met Sally nihilism. Rather, they want to be the first to know—and share on social media—the last four words of the series, which have become the cornerstone of Gilmore lore.\nThe show’s creator, Amy Sherman-Palladino has had these words simmering in her mind for a decade. She had a reputation for plotting out every single aspect of the show, including the final words spoken on the series—words that were never uttered. Controversially, she and the WB parted ways a year before Gilmore Girls ended in 2007. Fans , critics and even the show’s stars consider the seventh and final season lacking, even beyond the missing final words.\n\nFor many fans those four words have come to represent an alternate reality where Sherman-Palladino stayed with the show and wrote a better, more satisfying ending. (This dreamy “what if?” scenario neglects that many show endings tend to be weaker than their beginnings or middles.) They’ve gained mythical status, thanks in part to their mystery: Sherman-Palladino has not even confirmed who utters the final words, though many fans have assumed either Lorelai Gilmore (Lauren Graham) or her daughter Rory (Alexis Bledel) will do the honors.\nAfter nine years of stewing over what could have been, many fans anticipate that Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life will be sort of a do-over. Sure, they can’t rewind time, throw a now 32-year-old Rory back into Yale and re-write her senior year. But they can rewrite the ending to these characters’ onscreen lives. This may be misguided: Sherman-Palladino told TIME that the new 90-minute installments are not just more episodes of Gilmore Girls . They endeavor to be deeper, darker and different.\nStill, fans will look to the new series for closure, hence the urge to discover those last four words. The creator is so worried about spoilers that she says they filmed several different endings to make sure the words didn’t leak. She also unsuccessfully lobbied Netflix to release the episodes piecemeal instead of all at once.\nNo such luck. Fans will either be celebrating or fuming on Friday night (or, rather, in the wee hours of Saturday morning) when they hear the words meant to end the series, the words which they’ve awaited for nine years.\n",

      "text": "When Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life arrives Friday on Netflix, one of the show's biggest mysteries will finally be solved.\nCreator Amy Sherman-Palladino long ago revealed that she had thought up the final four words she wanted the series to end on. However, when she and her husband, executive producer Dan Palladino, abruptly exited the series at the end of season six, Sherman-Palladino walked away from the chance to end the series on her own terms, as the series would be canceled the following year after production had already wrapped on the final episode.\nIn the years since, Sherman-Palladino never publicly divulged her dream ending on the off chance she would get to put those four words to good use. Nine years later, that long-awaited dialogue will be heard in the fourth and final chapter of the revival, titled \"Fall.\"\n\"They're so epic and beautiful,\" Liza Weil told The Hollywood Reporter at Friday's premiere. \"I think it's worth the wait.\"\nRead more: 'Gilmore Girls' Team Open Up About Netflix Revival and \"Journey\" to Those Final Four Words\nWith just days to go before the revival's release, THR asked the cast to offer their best (and craziest) guesses for the final words:\nVanessa Marano (April Nardini): \"Mom, I'm pregnant - psych.\"\nMike Gandolfi (Andrew): \"Rosebud was a sled.\"\nRini Bell (Lulu): \"Bring me more coffee.\"\nDavid Sutcliffe (Christopher Hayden): \"The aliens are here.\"\nKeiko Agena (Lane Kim): \"'It is tomato pie' - that's what I'm sure its not.\"\nRose Abdoo (Gypsy): \"Bring back more Gypsy.\"\nSean Gunn (Kirk Gleason): \"Luke, you're my father.\"\nJohn Cabrera (Brian Fuller): \"I have no idea and I won't even speculate. I don't even want to speculate. I don't think that the fans should even speculate. They should just enjoy when it happens.\"\nGilmore Girls: A Year in the Life premieres Nov. 25 on Netflix.",

      "text": "WHAT: The trailer for Netflix’s Obama biopic Barry .\nWHO: First-time actor Devon Terrell stars as the college-aged Obama, alongside The Witch ’s Anya Taylor-Joy, Boyhood ’s Ellar Coltrane, and Ashley Judd in Vikram Gandhi’s narrative feature debut.\nWHY WE CARE: The end of the Obama years have, of course, taken a surprising twist upon the unlikely election of his successor. But no matter who won two weeks ago, there’d be a lot of people mourning the final months of a President, by his very nature, was transformational for America. That’s why movies like Barry and Southside With You are fascinating: They’re not just biographies of important men as leaders, chronicling their rise to political power, like Oliver Stone’s W or Mike Nichols’s thinly veiled Clinton allegory, Primary Colors . These are stories of the young Obama—prequels, if you will, to the man who introduced himself to the world stage at the Democratic National Convention in 2004 and who became President just four years later. The fact that there’s such interest in chronicling those early days in films that bear the full weight of what he’d go on to accomplish is notable—and also notable is the way that Barry looks to present the quest of the college-aged Obama, seeking to understand what role America might make available to someone both bright and ambitious and uncertain about if he belongs anywhere. Knowing that, ultimately, America would elect him to the highest office in the land with more votes than any candidate in history blunts some of the sting of that search for understanding, but the results of November 8th also put us right back in the question that the movie seems to be asking: Obama may have earned two terms in the White House, but young people who look like him now are still wondering what roles America offers them. The answers probably won’t be found in Barry , but it’s a timely question to explore through the film.",

      "text": "Photo: Lester Cohen / Getty More by Kate Stanhope\nDave Chappelle is headed to Netflix.\nThe stand-up comic has set three new stand-up comedy specials at the streaming giant, it was announced Monday.\nChappelle and director Stan Lathan will produce an original stand-up comedy special exclusively for Netflix, with its premiere date to be announced. The two other never-before-seen specials hail directly from Chappelle’s personal comedy vault. Directed by Lathan and filmed at Austin City Limits and the Hollywood Palladium, the specials mark the comedian’s first concert specials in 12 years and are slated to be released simultaneously in 2017.\n“Dave Chappelle is a legendary voice in comedy — searing, vital, and now more than ever, essential,” Lisa Nishimura, Netflix VP, original docuementary and comedy, said. “Dave’s three new specials promise to be some of the most anticipated events in comedy, and we are honored he will mark his global return on Netflix.”\nThe news comes fresh off Chappelle’s SNL hosting debut, which nabbed the show its best rating in three years. The specials will also mark Chappelle’s first major TV project since he surprisingly and suddenly stepped away from his Comedy Central sketch series Chappelle’s Show in 2005 arguably at the height of the show’s popularity. The comedian subsequently spent several years out of the public eye, but has slowly returned to the mainstream. He performed 10 sold-out shows at Radio City Music Hall in 2014, and also appeared in a small roll in Spike Lee’s film Chi-Raq last year. He has continued to perform stand-up across the country, performing over 500 shows in the past three years.\nFor Netflix, the deal comes not long after the streaming giant landed two new stand-up specials from Chris Rock as part of a stunning $40 million deal. As it ramps up originals, the streamer has become a major player in the stand-up space, competiting against Comedy Central and HBO, among other platforms. Earlier this year, the streamer was able to land Dana Carvey’s first stand-up special in 20 years. In September, Patton Oswalt won an Emmy for his Netflix stand-up special, Talking for Clapping.\n“For us, it’s about having enough of a global audience and anticipated engagement that we can get behind all of these projects,” Nishimura told THR earlier this month when discussing Rock’s highly anticipated specials.",

The specials are slated to be released simultaneously sometime in 2017. \nThe specials will be Chappelle's first since 2004's For What It's Worth.

After a few years of sporadic appearances, he heavily returned to stand-up in 2013, performing nearly 500 shows in the past three years, but hadn't done televised stand-up until his instant classic monologue on SNL after the election earlier this month. \n\"Dave Chappelle is a legendary voice in comedy -- searing, vital, and now more than ever, essential,\" Lisa Nishimura, Netflix's VP of Original Documentary and Comedy, said in a statement. \"Dave's three new specials promise to be some of the most anticipated events in comedy, and we are honored he will mark his global return on Netflix.\" Netflix also recently secured the stand-up special return of another iconic comedian, Chris Rock, who will be producing two specials for the streaming service, the first of which will tape next year. Rock is reportedly being paid $40 million for the specials. The terms of Chappelle's deal are not publicly known. Rock and Chappelle appeared together on SNL on Nov. 12. \nOther Links From TVGuide.com Dave Chappelle About Us",

      "text": "Dave Chappelle Is Bringing Three Stand-Up Specials to Netflix  17 PM TV Guide \nHosting Saturday Night Live wasn't a fluke; Dave Chappelle is coming all the way back. \nNetflix announced Monday that the comedian will be releasing three stand-up specials on its streaming service in 2017: one all-new special produced by Netflix, and two from Chappelle's personal vault, previously recorded at Austin City Limits Live and The Hollywood Palladium. The specials are slated to be released simultaneously sometime in 2017. \nThe specials will be Chappelle's first since 2004's For What It's Worth.

After a few years of sporadic appearances, he heavily returned to stand-up in 2013, performing nearly 500 shows in the past three years, but hadn't done televised stand-up until his instant classic monologue on SNL after the election earlier this month. \n\"Dave Chappelle is a legendary voice in comedy -- searing, vital, and now more than ever, essential,\" Lisa Nishimura, Netflix's VP of Original Documentary and Comedy, said in a statement. \"Dave's three new specials promise to be some of the most anticipated events in comedy, and we are honored he will mark his global return on Netflix.\" Netflix also recently secured the stand-up special return of another iconic comedian, Chris Rock, who will be producing two specials for the streaming service, the first of which will tape next year. Rock is reportedly being paid $40 million for the specials. The terms of Chappelle's deal are not publicly known. Rock and Chappelle appeared together on SNL on Nov. 12. \n  Dave Chappelle About Us",

      "text": "Dave Chappelle Is Bringing Three Stand-Up Specials to Netflix  17 PM TV Guide \nHosting Saturday Night Live wasn't a fluke; Dave Chappelle is coming all the way back. \nNetflix announced Monday that the comedian will be releasing three stand-up specials on its streaming service in 2017: one all-new special produced by Netflix, and two from Chappelle's personal vault, previously recorded at Austin City Limits Live and The Hollywood Palladium. The specials are slated to be released simultaneously sometime in 2017. \nThe specials will be Chappelle's first since 2004's For What It's Worth. Dave Chappelle\" data-image-credit=\"Lester Cohen, WireImage\" data-image-alt-text=\"Dave Chappelle\" data-image-credit-url=\"\" data-image-target-url=\"\" data-image-title=\"Dave Chappelle\" data-image-filename=\"161121-news-dave-chappelle-hp-lg.jpg\" data-image-date-created=\"2016/11/21\" data-image-crop=\"\" data-image-crop-gravity=\"\" data-image-aspect-ratio=\"\" data-image-height=\"506\" data-image-width=\"740\" data-image-do-not-crop=\"\" data-image-do-not-resize=\"\" data-image-watermark=\"\" data-lightbox=\"\">\nChappelle has done very little TV work since walking away from his beloved sketch series Chappelle's Show in 2005. After a few years of sporadic appearances, he heavily returned to stand-up in 2013, performing nearly 500 shows in the past three years, but hadn't done televised stand-up until his instant classic monologue on SNL after the election earlier this month. \n\"Dave Chappelle is a legendary voice in comedy -- searing, vital, and now more than ever, essential,\" Lisa Nishimura, Netflix's VP of Original Documentary and Comedy, said in a statement. \"Dave's three new specials promise to be some of the most anticipated events in comedy, and we are honored he will mark his global return on Netflix.\" Netflix also recently secured the stand-up special return of another iconic comedian, Chris Rock, who will be producing two specials for the streaming service, the first of which will tape next year. Rock is reportedly being paid $40 million for the specials. The terms of Chappelle's deal are not publicly known. Rock and Chappelle appeared together on SNL on Nov. 12. \n  Dave Chappelle About Us",

      "text": "WHAT: The trailer for Netflix’s Obama biopic Barry .\nWHO: First-time actor Devon Terrell stars as the college-aged Obama, alongside The Witch ’s Anya Taylor-Joy, Boyhood ’s Ellar Coltrane, and Ashley Judd in Vikram Gandhi’s narrative feature debut. \nWHY WE CARE: The end of the Obama years have, of course, taken a surprising twist upon the unlikely election of his successor. But no matter who won two weeks ago, there’d be a lot of people mourning the final months of a President, by his very nature, was transformational for America. That’s why movies like Barry and Southside With You are fascinating: They’re not just biographies of important men as leaders, chronicling their rise to political power, like Oliver Stone’s W or Mike Nichols’s thinly veiled Clinton allegory, Primary Colors . These are stories of the young Obama—prequels, if you will, to the man who introduced himself to the world stage at the Democratic National Convention in 2004 and who became President just four years later. The fact that there’s such interest in chronicling those early days in films that bear the full weight of what he’d go on to accomplish is notable—and also notable is the way that Barry looks to present the quest of the college-aged Obama, seeking to understand what role America might make available to someone both bright and ambitious and uncertain about if he belongs anywhere. Knowing that, ultimately, America would elect him to the highest office in the land with more votes than any candidate in history blunts some of the sting of that search for understanding, but the results of November 8th also put us right back in the question that the movie seems to be asking: Obama may have earned two terms in the White House, but young people who look like him now are still wondering what roles America offers them. The answers probably won’t be found in Barry , but it’s a timely question to explore through the film.",

      "title": "Netflix Drops First Trailer for Pre-Presidential Biopic BARRY — GeekTyrant",
      "text": "Netflix has released the first trailer for their biographical take on the college years of President Barack Obama, and it looks pretty solid! Read the description and continue on below... A young Barack Obama, known to his friends as “Barry,” arrives in New York City in the fall of 1981 to begin his junior year at Columbia University. In a crime-ridden and racially charged environment, Barry finds himself pulled between various social spheres and struggles to maintain a series of increasingly strained relationships with his Kansas-born mother, his estranged Kenyan father, and his classmates.Barry is the story of a young man grappling with those same issues that his country, and arguably the world, are still coming to terms with 35 years later. I'm interested in watching simply for the fact that it's cool to remember that most Presidents of the United States started out simply as normal people. They had their vices like us, their times of doubt, and were once more human than they appear to be now. I don't think I'll ever have a shot at becoming President, but this trailer made me feel like a guy from the same background as me could be one day. Barry hits Netflix December 16th.",

      "text": "Watch the Trailer for Netflix’s Obama Biopic, Barry by Dana Eisenberg | 4:30   VIDEO \nToday, Netflix released the first official trailer for Barry , an upcoming biopic about President Barack Obama . The movie is set to be released on December 16th, just over a month before Obama leaves office, and it takes place during his junior year at Columbia University. \nDevon Terrell stars as Obama and depicts the young future president struggling to fit in and navigate his environment. At one point, when a friend comments that because he is of mixed race he can “fit in anywhere,” he responds by saying, “I fit in nowhere.” \nThe film was directed by Vikram Gandhi and written by Adam Mansbach , who wrote Go the F*ck to Sleep . Both are Columbia University alumni. \nWatch the trailer above, via Netflix. \n[image via screen grab]",

The specials are slated to be released simultaneously sometime in 2017. \nThe specials will be Chappelle's first since 2004's For What It's Worth.

After a few years of sporadic appearances, he heavily returned to stand-up in 2013, performing nearly 500 shows in the past three years, but hadn't done televised stand-up until his instant classic monologue on SNL after the election earlier this month. \n\"Dave Chappelle is a legendary voice in comedy -- searing, vital, and now more than ever, essential,\" Lisa Nishimura, Netflix's VP of Original Documentary and Comedy, said in a statement. \"Dave's three new specials promise to be some of the most anticipated events in comedy, and we are honored he will mark his global return on Netflix.\" Netflix also recently secured the stand-up special return of another iconic comedian, Chris Rock, who will be producing two specials for the streaming service, the first of which will tape next year. Rock is reportedly being paid $40 million for the specials. The terms of Chappelle's deal are not publicly known. Rock and Chappelle appeared together on SNL on Nov. 12. \nOther Links From TVGuide.com Dave Chappelle About Us",

      "text": "  4:30 PM \nNext year is going to be no joke for comedian Dave Chappelle. \nThe comic is bringing a trio of stand-up comedy specials to Netflix in 2017, marking his first such releases in a dozen years. \n\"Dave Chappelle is a legendary voice in comedy — searing, vital, and now more than ever, essential,\" Lisa Nishimura, Netflix's VP of original documentary and comedy, said in a statement. \"Dave's three new specials promise to be some of the most anticipated events in comedy.\" \nThe three specials — which will be released on the same unannounced date on the streaming service — will include previously unreleased performances produced at the Austin City Limits studio and the Hollywood Palladium. \nChappelle, 43, will work with director Stan Lathan to develop the third special. Dave Chappelle is returning to TV with three Netflix specials. (Brad Barket/Brad Barket/Invision/AP) \nThe announcement, which Netflix made Monday, comes a little over a week after Chappelle hosted \"Saturday Night Live\" in what was the highest-rated episode in three years. \nIn addition to his illustrious stand-up career, the funnyman earned a tremendous following for his hit sketch-comedy series \"Chappelle's Show,\" which aired from 2003 to 2006 on Comedy Central. \nHe becomes the latest big-name comic to ink a deal with Netflix, as Chris Rock also signed on for a pair of specials with the streaming service earlier this month.

(Photo by Scott Roth/Invision/AP) Scott Roth Previous Next \nNEW YORK (AP) — Comedian Dave Chappelle is headed back to TV with his first concert specials in a dozen years — a trio of specials to be released on Netflix simultaneously in 2017. \nNo exact date was given by Netflix, which said one of the specials is being produced exclusively for the network. Two additional never-before-seen specials \"come directly from Chappelle's personal comedy vault,\" Netflix said. \nChappelle's comedy career includes movie roles in \"The Nutty Professor,\"''Con Air\" and \"Blue Streak.\" In 2003, he achieved heightened fame and critical acclaim as mastermind of his Comedy Central sketch series, \"Chappelle's Show,\" until his abrupt exit in its third season. \nEarlier this month, he made his hosting debut on NBC's \"Saturday Night Live,\" mixing one-liners with serious jabs at race relations and politics.

      "text": "Netflix Debuts Trailer for 'Barry,' Streaming Premiere Set for December 16   12:30 PM PST by Steven Cohen A pivotal year in the life of a young Barack Obama will be explored on Netflix in December. Netflix has released a full trailer for its upcoming original film, 'Barry.' The movie will start streaming through Netflix on December 16. A young Barack Obama, known to his friends as 'Barry,' arrives in New York City in the fall of 1981 to begin his junior year at Columbia University. In a crime-ridden and racially charged environment, Barry finds himself pulled between various social spheres and struggles to maintain a series of increasingly strained relationships with his Kansas-born mother, his estranged Kenyan father, and his classmates. Barry is the story of a young man grappling with those same issues that his country, and arguably the world, are still coming to terms with 35 years later. Check out the official trailer below! The movie stars Devon Terrell, Ashley Judd ('Divergent,' 'Double Jeopardy'), Jenna Elfman ('Friends With Benefits,' 'Big Stone Gap'), Anya Taylor-Joy ('The Witch'), Jason Mitchell ('Straight Outta Compton'), Ellar Coltrane ('Boyhood'), and Avi Nash ('Learning to Drive,' 'Silicon Valley'). 'Barry' is directed by Vikram Gandhi and written by Adam Mansbach. Gandhi also serves as a producer along with Dana O’Keefe, Teddy Schwarzman, and Ben Stillman. Daniel Steinman is on board as an executive producer as well. Other upcoming Netflix premieres include ' Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life ' on November 25, ' 3% ' on November 25, ' Fuller House ' season two on December 9, ' Barry ' on December 16, ' A Series of Unfortunate Events ' on January 13, ' David Brent: Life on the Road ' on February 10, and ' Iron Fist ' on March 17. A current Netflix subscription starts at $10 for HD streaming and $12 for Ultra HD streaming.",

      "text": "President Obama Biopic, 'Barry,' Trailer Released by Netflix This is really important. Twitter \nAs we watch President Obama prepare for the last days of his presidency, Netflix is taking a step back to remember where it all began: with a 20-year-old college student in New York City who had big ambitions and even bigger hurdles in his future. Barry, which will premiere on Netflix on December 16, dramatizes the President's life before his career in politics, back when he was just, well, Barry. \nThe trailer, which is out today, depicts bits and pieces of what we can expect from the film. We see Barack, played by Devon Terrell, struggling with his heritage and identity (\"I belong nowhere,\" he says) as well as his relationships with his Kansas-born mother and Kenyan-born father. We see his life as it played out at Columbia University, when he was in his junior year. The events that take place shape his perspective on race, government and American life, ideas that carried into his platform and across his presidency. Ideas that would be the foundation of his legacy. \nThe film originally premiered at the 2016 Toronto International Film Festival, and co-stars Ashley Judd, Jenna Elfman, and Anya Taylor-Joy In a Variety review , it was described as being \"rooted in the murky, drifting [...] nature of college life that the movies almost never get right. This one does, and that’s one reason it feels bracingly authentic.” They went on to call it \"at once moving and revealing,\" and with good reason.",

The specials are slated to be released simultaneously sometime in 2017. \nThe specials will be Chappelle's first since 2004's For What It's Worth.

After a few years of sporadic appearances, he heavily returned to stand-up in 2013, performing nearly 500 shows in the past three years, but hadn't done televised stand-up until his instant classic monologue on SNL after the election earlier this month. \n\"Dave Chappelle is a legendary voice in comedy -- searing, vital, and now more than ever, essential,\" Lisa Nishimura, Netflix's VP of Original Documentary and Comedy, said in a statement. \"Dave's three new specials promise to be some of the most anticipated events in comedy, and we are honored he will mark his global return on Netflix.\" Netflix also recently secured the stand-up special return of another iconic comedian, Chris Rock, who will be producing two specials for the streaming service, the first of which will tape next year. Rock is reportedly being paid $40 million for the specials. The terms of Chappelle's deal are not publicly known. Rock and Chappelle appeared together on SNL on Nov. 12. \n  Dave Chappelle About Us",

      "title": "Witness the moments that defined Barack Obama in new Netflix film Barry",
      "text": "Witness the moments that defined Barack Obama in new Netflix film Barry 1 hour ago by Christina Marfice Trending writer \nChristina is a reporter based in Boise, Idaho. She's a veteran vegetarian, a political junkie and a huge grammar snob. On the weekends, she can usually be found binging on Netflix, playing the piano or petting her cats, Daisy and Dandelion. Netflix released the Barry trailer inspired by Barack Obama's life & we're all in   \nHistory and politics nerds, are you ready? \nMore: Here's what President Obama said to Malia and Sasha about the election \nA biopic showing President Barack Obama's years at Columbia University is coming to Netflix, and the first full trailer is finally out. \nThe trailer shows Devon Terrell's portrayal of the teen who would go on to become the 44th president of the United States, and he seems perfectly suited for the role (how well did he nail Obama's accent?!). In the trailer, we get to see some of the challenges a young Obama faced, like getting profiled by a racist security guard who demands his ID while letting other students pass, and a dramatic scene where he gets punched in the face by another character, who we can't identify from the short clip in the trailer. \nMore: President Obama wants Beyoncé to inspire recent college grads \nThroughout the trailer, Obama wonders where he fits in, being half black and half white. A friend tells him he fits everywhere, but, looking despondent, he replies that he feels like he fits nowhere (spoiler alert: He fits right into the Oval Office!). \nThen there are the inspiring moments, like when a young Obama describes his mother from Kansas and father from Kenya to a man who asks, \"Do you know what that makes you?\" Obama looks alarmed, like he's expecting something racist, before the man tells him, \"That makes you American.\" \nThe film is written and directed by graduates of Columbia University; director Vikram Gandhi actually lived next door to where Obama lived when he was attending the school. \nBarry premieres on Netflix Dec. 16, and I'll just be over here counting the days (and planning my nerdy viewing party) until then. \nBefore you go, check out our slideshow below.

      "text": "Dave Chappelle Is Bringing Three Stand-Up Specials to Netflix Monday Nov 21, 2016 at 3:30 PM Nov 21, 2016 at 6:17 PM TV Guide \nHosting Saturday Night Live wasn't a fluke; Dave Chappelle is coming all the way back. \nNetflix announced Monday that the comedian will be releasing three stand-up specials on its streaming service in 2017: one all-new special produced by Netflix, and two from Chappelle's personal vault, previously recorded at Austin City Limits Live and The Hollywood Palladium. The specials are slated to be released simultaneously sometime in 2017. \nThe specials will be Chappelle's first since 2004's For What It's Worth. \nChappelle has done very little TV work since walking away from his beloved sketch series Chappelle's Show in 2005. After a few years of sporadic appearances, he heavily returned to stand-up in 2013, performing nearly 500 shows in the past three years, but hadn't done televised stand-up until his instant classic monologue on SNL after the election earlier this month. \n\"Dave Chappelle is a legendary voice in comedy -- searing, vital, and now more than ever, essential,\" Lisa Nishimura, Netflix's VP of Original Documentary and Comedy, said in a statement. \"Dave's three new specials promise to be some of the most anticipated events in comedy, and we are honored he will mark his global return on Netflix.\" Netflix also recently secured the stand-up special return of another iconic comedian, Chris Rock, who will be producing two specials for the streaming service, the first of which will tape next year. Rock is reportedly being paid $40 million for the specials. The terms of Chappelle's deal are not publicly known. Rock and Chappelle appeared together on SNL on Nov. 12. \nOther Links From TVGuide.com",

      "text": "Deals Dave Chappelle to unleash 3 Netflix comedy specials in 2017 \nNEW YORK (AP) - Comedian Dave Chappelle is headed back to TV with his first concert specials in a dozen years - a trio of specials to be released on Netflix simultaneously in 2017. \nNo exact date was given by Netflix, which said one of the specials is being produced exclusively for the network. Two additional never-before-seen specials \"come directly from Chappelle's personal comedy vault,\" Netflix said. \nChappelle's comedy career includes movie roles in \"The Nutty Professor,\" ''Con Air\" and \"Blue Streak.\" In 2003, he achieved heightened fame and critical acclaim as mastermind of his Comedy Central sketch series, \"Chappelle's Show,\" until his abrupt exit in its third season. \nEarlier this month, he made his hosting debut on NBC's \"Saturday Night Live,\" mixing one-liners with serious jabs at race relations and politics.

      "text": "Netflix Set to Air Three Stand-Up Comedy Specials for Dave Chappelle in 2017   Jeffrey Harris Tweet \nNetflix officially announced today in a press release a new partnership with comedian and actor Dave Chappelle. Netflix will present three stand-up comedy specials on the streaming service later next year. These specials include one new one produced by Netflix and two from Chappelle’s personal vault from Austin City Limits and The Hollywood Palladium. \nThe specials are expected for a simultaneous release later in 2017. Speaking on the news in the press release, Netflix VP of Original Documentary and Comedy stated: “Dave Chappelle is a legendary voice in comedy — searing, vital, and now more than ever, essential. Dave’s three new specials promise to be some of the most anticipated events in comedy, and we are honored he will mark his global return on Netflix.” \nChappelle recently made a return to TV, guest hosting a recent episode of Saturday Night Live . He’s probably most well known for 2003 sketch comedy show, Chappelle’s Show , which was one of the highest rated shows on Comedy Central. Chappelle has performed over 500 concerts over the last three years. He also sold out 10 consecutive comedy shows at Radio City Music Hall.",

      "text": "Subscribe to 107.3 KFFM on \nNetflix released the official trailer for their forthcoming movie Barry , a film that chronicles President Barack Obama ’s time as a student at Columbia University. \nThe movie — which was well-received following its premiere at the 2016 Toronto Film Festival back in September — stars Australian actor Devon Terrell as the film’s titular character. Ashley Judd, Anya Taylor-Joy, Jenna Elfman, Jason Mitchell, Avi Nash and Ellar Coltrane fill out the rest of the cast. \nColumbia University alum Vikram Gandhi directed the film after first approaching fellow student Adam Mansbach, in a bid to tell Obama’s story. Mansbach agreed and wrote the movie’s script, according to Deadline . \nSee the full synopsis for Barry below, taken from the trailer’s YouTube description: \nA young Barack Obama, known to his friends as “Barry,” arrives in New York City in the fall of 1981 to begin his junior year at Columbia University. In a crime-ridden and racially charged environment, Barry finds himself pulled between various social spheres and struggles to maintain a series of increasingly strained relationships with his Kansas-born mother, his estranged Kenyan father, and his classmates. Barry is the story of a young man grappling with those same issues that his country, and arguably the world, are still coming to terms with 35 years later. \nBarry drops on Netflix on December 16. Check out the trailer above in the meantime. 25 Celebrities Who Supported Hillary Clinton For President Image of",

      "text": "Dave Chappelle Is Bringing Three Stand-Up Specials to Netflix Monday Nov 21, 2016 at 3:30 PM Nov 21, 2016 at 6:17 PM TV Guide \nHosting Saturday Night Live wasn't a fluke; Dave Chappelle is coming all the way back. \nNetflix announced Monday that the comedian will be releasing three stand-up specials on its streaming service in 2017: one all-new special produced by Netflix, and two from Chappelle's personal vault, previously recorded at Austin City Limits Live and The Hollywood Palladium. The specials are slated to be released simultaneously sometime in 2017. \nThe specials will be Chappelle's first since 2004's For What It's Worth. \nChappelle has done very little TV work since walking away from his beloved sketch series Chappelle's Show in 2005. After a few years of sporadic appearances, he heavily returned to stand-up in 2013, performing nearly 500 shows in the past three years, but hadn't done televised stand-up until his instant classic monologue on SNL after the election earlier this month. \n\"Dave Chappelle is a legendary voice in comedy -- searing, vital, and now more than ever, essential,\" Lisa Nishimura, Netflix's VP of Original Documentary and Comedy, said in a statement. \"Dave's three new specials promise to be some of the most anticipated events in comedy, and we are honored he will mark his global return on Netflix.\" Netflix also recently secured the stand-up special return of another iconic comedian, Chris Rock, who will be producing two specials for the streaming service, the first of which will tape next year. Rock is reportedly being paid $40 million for the specials. The terms of Chappelle's deal are not publicly known. Rock and Chappelle appeared together on SNL on Nov. 12. \nOther Links From TVGuide.com",

(Saeed Adyani/Netflix via AP) Saeed Adyani/Netflix \nLauren Graham and Alexis Bladel as Lorelai and Rory Gilmore on the return of \"Gilmore Girls.\" (Saeed Adyani/Netflix) Saeed Adyani \nThis image released by Netflix shows, from left, Scott Patterson, Lauren Graham and Alexis Bledel in a scene from, \"Gilmore Girls: A Year In The Life,\" premiering Friday on Netflix. (Saeed Adyani/Netflix via AP) \nLOS ANGELES- The familiar voices float softly from a black screen, as if in a dream. \nThere's Luke, gruffly: \"How many cups have you had this morning?\" \nAnd this parent-child banter: \"Did you do something slutty?\" Rory teasingly asks her mom. \"I'm not THAT happy,\" shoots back Lorelai. \nThankfully, it's not imagined. It's the reality of \"Gilmore Girls,\" returning Friday after a nine-year absence, during which longtime fans pined for what they'd lost and newcomers discovered what they'd missed through reruns. \nOpening-credit snippets of the show's hallmark dialogue kick off Netflix's sequel to the 2000-07 broadcast series with a promise: the characters, their snappy banter and the show's key notes will be honored. \nBut the four-part \"Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life\" is aimed at more than true believers, creator Amy Sherman-Palladino said in an interview. \n\"We want it to be something that fans are going to know, but if you haven't watched 'Gilmore' you can come to it fresh and take it on face value: It's a story of three women, an intergenerational, multigenerational story, and you are catching them at times that each of their lives is changing.\" \nThat trio around which the universe rotates consists of devoted single mom Lorelai Gilmore (Lauren Graham), her equally devoted daughter Rory (Alexis Bledel) and stern grandmother Emily (Kelly Bishop). As the first chapter opens, Lorelai and Rory are still the belles of fictional Connecticut hamlet Stars Hollow - so perfect, quips Lorelai, it belongs in a snow globe. \nLuke (Scott Patterson), Lorelai's on-again, off-again love is here, as are the supporting characters who gave the show, well, character. That includes official town nudge Taylor (now lobbying for a sewer system); reliably idiosyncratic Kirk (he's just launched Ooober, a non-app version of Uber) and even, in one episode, buoyant chef Sookie (courtesy of film star Melissa McCarthy's return to her TV roots). \nWhatever bliss viewers find in the girl-power dramedy's resurrection may be exceeded only by that of Sherman-Palladino, who wrote and produced it with Dan Palladino, her husband and creative partner on the sequel and the original. \n\"It was literally like no time had passed,\" Sherman-Palladino told a TV critics' news conference. \"It was joyous. It was fun. It was exhilarating. It was the old show. ... It was just like it was meant to continue.\" \nGraham sees \"Gilmore Girls\" as a welcome refuge from hard-edged TV and our prickly modern reality in general. \n\"I think it's because it's extremely comforting in a world that is lacking comfort and has a great choice of shows available that are stressful - great, but stressful, and so this kind of stands out in the way that it did then,\" she said. \nThere's a sad shadow, however, cast by the passing of family head Richard Gilmore. That reflects the December 2014 death of Edward Herrmann, the respected actor who played him in the original series. \n\"We all really felt his loss, and he would have loved it (working on the sequel) so much,\" Graham said in an interview. \"But I think the way the story is handled is a really nice tribute to him.\" \nThe 90-minute episodes follow the seasons and are titled for each, starting with \"Winter.\" While Lorelai and Emily face Richard's death in their own way, they also find their relationship affected by it. \nRory's romantic past is a factor as all of her ex-boyfriends appear in the series \"one way or another,\" said Bledel. So is the character's journalism career, and while Bledel is aware that her character's love life intrigues viewers, she'd like them to consider the complete young woman. \n\"There is so much more to her character that it's great when people focus on those things, on her ambition and her accomplishments and her goals,\" the actress said. \nGiven that all the episodes will be made available at once on streaming service Netflix, Sherman-Palladino sees trouble on the horizon. \nAfter holding close the four words she's long said should end the Gilmore saga (she wasn't in charge of the show's last season on the CW network), she wants viewers to avoid spoiling the experience, either by posting the phrase or by impatiently jumping to the final scene. \n\"It's going to mean a lot more if you've taken the journey, and it's going to mean a lot less if you just flip to the last page. ... It's a fun trip. It's worth it,\" she said. \nAnd does it end with \"A Year in the Life\"? Sherman-Palladino plays verbal dodgeball with the question: \"It's what it is right now. We put these together. We told these stories. And now we throw them out to the universe.\" \nLeave it to Kirk - OK, actor Sean Gunn, who plays him - to provide a skewed ray of hope that, perhaps, there will be more \"Gilmore Girls.\" \n\"I don't want to start any rumors, because I don't know,\" Gunn cautioned. \"But to take a step back and address that as a fan of the show, if the interest is there and we can get the scheduling right and Amy and Dan want to do it, I don't know why we wouldn't be able to, really.\" \nSo the miniseries' ending leaves an opening? \n\"The Earth does not get destroyed by a meteor at the end,\" he said, wryly. \"So the possibility of more must live out there somewhere.\" \n___ \nLynn Elber is a national television columnist for The Associated Press.

      "text": "Watch the Trailer for Netflix's New Barack Obama Biopic, \"Barry\" by Jessica Fu • Nov 21, 2016 at 2:23 pm Tweet \nNetflix has released the trailer for its new Barack Obama biopic, Barry . Set in the 1981, the film depicts the college-age president-to-be, played by Devon Terrell, as he moves to New York City and begins his junior year at Columbia University. Featuring an unassuming title and a handsome cast, the movie will present formative moments of young Obama's life and suggest how they shaped the politician he became. \nHere's the synopsis: \nIn a crime-ridden and racially charged environment, Barry finds himself pulled between various social spheres and struggles to maintain a series of increasingly strained relationships with his Kansas-born mother, his estranged Kenyan father, and his classmates. Barry is the story of a young man grappling with those same issues that his country, and arguably the world, are still coming to terms with 35 years later. \nBarry is the second Obama biopic of 2016, the president's final year in office. Back in August, the Michelle-Barack rom-com Southside With You gave us a fictionalized account of the first couple's first date. Sydney Brownstone described it as the story that America needed in the midst of the 2016 election. \nThat election is now over and Barry is another opportunity to cast light on Obama's legacy—one that is currently being overshadowed by the generally horrible behavior of his successor . \nThe film premieres December 16 on Netflix.",

The specials are slated to be released simultaneously sometime in 2017. \nThe specials will be Chappelle's first since 2004's For What It's Worth.

After a few years of sporadic appearances, he heavily returned to stand-up in 2013, performing nearly 500 shows in the past three years, but hadn't done televised stand-up until his instant classic monologue on SNL after the election earlier this month. \n\"Dave Chappelle is a legendary voice in comedy -- searing, vital, and now more than ever, essential,\" Lisa Nishimura, Netflix's VP of Original Documentary and Comedy, said in a statement. \"Dave's three new specials promise to be some of the most anticipated events in comedy, and we are honored he will mark his global return on Netflix.\" Netflix also recently secured the stand-up special return of another iconic comedian, Chris Rock, who will be producing two specials for the streaming service, the first of which will tape next year. Rock is reportedly being paid $40 million for the specials. The terms of Chappelle's deal are not publicly known. Rock and Chappelle appeared together on SNL on Nov. 12. \n  Dave Chappelle About Us",

      "text": "It’s only been a few days since the news broke that Amazon is rolling out its Prime Video streaming service in more than 200 countries to go head-to-head with Netflix . And now the e-commerce giant is said to be looking at putting together a premium sports package to go with it.\nThe company has been in talks with a wide range of different sports leagues about acquiring broadcasting rights, according to a report in the Wall Street Journal .\nObviously, Amazon would probably be most interested in the top National Basketball Association, Major League Baseball, and National Football League events, but it is also talking to the National Lacrosse League and the World Surf League, the newspaper’s sources said.\nThe big problem with trying to buy up basketball, football, and baseball programming is that the major networks--especially ESPN--have already locked up most of them for the next decade or so.\nGet Data Sheet , Fortune’s technology newsletter. \nFor example, the deal that ESPN has with the NBA doesn’t end until 2024, and the rights packages that ESPN, CBS and NBC have for National Football League games run into the next decade as well. Even college football teams have locked up rights with various cable networks.\nESPN’s parent Disney is also looking to expand its streaming offerings, including a new service that is expected to be launched soon. That’s why the entertainment giant recently spent $1 billion to buy a stake in BAMTech, the tech provider that handles streaming for Major League Baseball and a number of other clients including ESPN.\nAccording to the Journal , Amazon is “keenly aware” that the NFL Sunday Ticket games offered by DirecTV helped give that cable competitor a boost when it first launched, and therefore Amazon wants to do something similar by signing up whatever sports it can.\nAmazon gets a head start on Black Friday. Watch: \nAs with almost everything Amazon does, the content in this case is just a lure to get customers to sign up for its Prime subscription service, which generates significant returns for the company and now incorporates everything from free shipping on products to a Spotify-style music service.\nThere’s one big reason why we shouldn’t dismiss either the online giant’s sports ambitions or its global Netflix competitor: Namely, Amazon’s $380 billion market capitalization, and the massive river of cash that spins out of its Amazon Web Services division, where hundreds of Fortune 500 companies store their data. It generates about $10 billion in revenue every year.\nThat’s definitely enough to spend buying up sporting rights. All Amazon has to do is find someone who is willing to sell and who hasn’t already cut a deal with an existing network.",

Those two specials will be released at the same time in 2017.\nThe new original special has not release date as of yet.\n\"Dave Chappelle is a legendary voice in comedy -- searing, vital, and now more than ever, essential,\" Lisa Nishimura, Netflix’s VP of original documentary and comedy said. \"Dave’s three new specials promise to be some of the most anticipated events in comedy.\"\nChappelle was widely praised for his performance as host of \"SNL\" on NBC Nov. 12.\nDuring his stint, he revived old characters from his Comedy Central show, \"Chappelle's Show,\" and skewered the election in some skits. His opening monologue concluded with Chappelle saying, \"I'm wishing Donald Trump luck. And I'm going to give him a chance, and we, the historically disenfranchised, demand that he give us one, too.\"\nNews of Chappelle's specials come a month after the online streaming giant announced a similar deal with comedian Chris Rock .",

Netflix has announced they will be bringing us three new comedy specials with the comedian. News: 3 new Dave Chappelle comedy specials, coming soon. pic.twitter.com/OzrDukBPk6 \n— Netflix US (@netflix) November 21, 2016 \nNetflix just dropped a bomb today. The streaming service has revealed they have plans to drop three new comedy specials with Dave Chappelle. We’re expecting greatness. \nThis will be the first time Dave Chappelle will be on our television screens in long form since he walked away from his popular Comedy Central sketch show Chappelle’s Show almost ten years ago. \nThis comes just one week after Chappelle made his television comeback by hosting Saturday Night Live . This news also comes months after Netflix announced they have agreed to pay Chris Rock $40 million for two comedy specials as well. So it’s safe to assume that Chappelle just got “rich b*tch” again. \nThis news is also great for Netflix as the Black comedy specials they have given us so far from Chris Tucker, Mike Epps and Cedric The Entertainer were average at best. A tandem of Rock and Chappelle in 2017 with the state this country is in will be nothing less than monumental. Especially since Netflix is all for pushing envelopes and stepping over boundaries content wise. \nMore news as this develops. \nPhoto: Twitter",

      "text": " December is just around the corner, which means it's almost time to snuggle up with your BFFs or bae to enjoy some quality time together — and the second season of Fuller House — with some help from Netflix. The Tanners are back for another season of family drama fun and this time, they've included some very special guests like New Kids on the Block and a new Gibbler (aka Stephanie's new makeout buddy). Also coming to Netflix in December: Barry , the new biopic about a young Barack Obama starring newcomer Devon Terrell as the future POTUS; House of Wax (i.e. your fave Paris Hilton movie); and Captain America: Civil War , in case you missed it earlier this year. You still have a few days to watch the following titles one last time before they say laters baby to Netflix: 50 First Dates , Holes , American Beauty , Top Gun , and the entire Hercules series (if that's your cup of tea).\nNew on Netflix in December Dec. 1: Always\nAngels in the Snow\nBeverly Hills Cop\nBeyond Bollywood\nBlack Snake Moan\nChill With Bob Ross: Collection\nCompulsion\nD2: The Mighty Ducks\nDavid Blaine: Street Magic\nDreamland\nFor the Love of Spock\nGirlfriends' Guide to Divorce : Season 2\nGlory Daze: The Life and Time of Michael Alig\nHarry and the Hendersons\nHitler: A Career\nHoliday Engagement\nHoney, I Shrunk the Kids\nHouse of Wax\nHannibal\nMerli : Season 1 — Netflix Original\nMerry Kissmas\nNational Lampoon’s Animal House\nPicture Perfect\nRainbow Time\nRodeo & Juliet\nSwept Under\nSwitchback\nThe Angry Birds Movie\nThe Crucible\nThe Little Rascals\nThe Legend of Bagger Vance\nThe Rock\nThe Spirit of Christmas\nToys\nUncle Nick\nWaking Life\nWay of the Dragon\nWe're Back!

Featured Image VIA \nNetflix has announced he’ll be filming three stand-up comedy specials for them; the first time he’ll have done a TV special since 2004. News: 3 new Dave Chappelle comedy specials, coming soon. pic.twitter.com/OzrDukBPk6 \n— Netflix US (@netflix) November 21, 2016 \nThe world has needed more Dave Chappelle ever since he had that meltdown and flew to Africa all those years ago, so this is great news. It will also be a great way to cheer people up during the first year of Trump’s presidency which you know Chappelle will have some A+ jokes on. \nIf you haven’t watched Chappelle’s other standups, first slap yourself, then check out this clip from one of them below: \nWatch all his shows and skits and you’ll realise why he’s the best comedian to ever do it. \nSpeaking of great comedians, check out how this one shuts down a heckler who gives him shit over a parenting joke.",

      "text": "Courtesy of Netflix November 21, 2016 | 02:43PM PT \nWelcome back to Tune In, our weekly newsletter, offering a guide to the best of the week’s TV. \nEach week, Variety’s TV team combs through the week’s TV schedule, selecting our picks of what to watch and when/how to watch it. This week, Thanksgiving specials take over television, “ Dancing With The Stars ” crowns a winner and “ Gilmore Girls ” is back. \n“Fashion Police,” E!, Monday, 8 p.m. \nE!’s fashion gabfest, which used to air on a weekly basis with Joan Rivers, is now on solely for special events — this time, host Melissa Rivers is joined by Giuliana Rancic, Brad Goreski, Margaret Cho and NeNe Leakes to chat about last night’s AMAs . \n“Dancing With The Stars,” ABC, Tuesday, 8 p.m. \nThe two-night finale begins Monday night, culminating with a live episode on Tuesday that will end with one couple winning the mirror ball trophy for Season 23. The last four couples standing are Laurie Hernandez and Val Chmerkovskiy, Calvin Johnson and Lindsay Arnold, James Hinchcliffe and Sharna Burgess, plus Jana Kramer and Gleb Savchenko who’s been battling the flu, leading up to the finals. \n“Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade,” NBC, Thursday, 9 a.m. \nThe annual event kicks off Turkey Day and hits a major milestone in 2016, celebrating the parade’s 90th year. As always, Snoopy and Felix the Cat balloons will roam the streets of NYC, and will be joined by performers Tony Bennett, Brett Eldredge, Fitz and the Tantrums, Daya, Kelsea Ballerini, “America’s Got Talent” winner Grace Vanderwaal, Olympic gymnast and “DWTS” finalist Laurie Hernandez, The Muppets, Sarah McLachlan and more. \n“The Wonderful World of Disney: Magical Holiday Celebration,” ABC, Thursday, 8 p.m. \nJulianne and Derek Hough will host the first annual holiday special, held at Walt Disney World Resort. Filled with musical performances, special appearances and “unforgettable Disney magic moments,” the two-hour holiday fest will feature “Descendants 2” star Sofia Carson and Mariah Carey, who will sing her hit, “All I Want for Christmas Is You.” \n“Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life,” Netflix, Friday (CRITICS PICK) \nBreathe a sigh of relief: The “ Gilmore Girls ” we knew and loved is back, complete with rat-a-tat dialogue, way too much coffee, lots of fun cameos and town meetings that take odd turns. At its best, “A Year in the Life” is the equivalent of a platter of powdered donuts and extra-crispy French fries. Maybe it’s a little wobbly and indulgent at times — and rapid consumption of the four 90-minute episodes Netflix commissioned is not advised — but when it relies on the notable strengths of its core ensemble, it is television at its most warm and reassuring, our critic Maureen Ryan writes in her review .

He walked out on the Comedy Central hit \"Chappelle's Show\" about a decade ago.\n\"Dave Chappelle is a legendary voice in comedy -- searing, vital, and now more than ever, essential,\" said Lisa Nishimura, Netflix's VP of original documentary and comedy. \"Dave's three new specials promise to be some of the most anticipated events in comedy.\"\nStan Lathan is slated to direct the first stand-up show, along with two additional never-before-seen specials said to come from Chapelle's own personal comedy vault.\nA premiere date has not yet been announced.\n ",

(Photo by Jordan Strauss/Invision/AP) Fast-talking 'Gilmore Girls' returns ASSOCIATED PRESS | November 21, 2016, 8:39AM | Updated 6 hours ago. LOS ANGELES — The familiar voices float softly from a black screen, as if in a dream.There's Luke, gruffly: \"How many cups have you had this morning?\"And this parent-child banter: \"Did you do something slutty?\" Rory teasingly asks her mom. \"I'm not THAT happy,\" shoots back Lorelai.Thankfully, it's not imagined. It's the reality of \"Gilmore Girls,\" returning Friday after a nine-year absence, during which longtime fans pined for what they'd lost and newcomers discovered what they'd missed through reruns.Opening-credit snippets of the show's hallmark dialogue kick off Netflix's sequel to the 2000-07 broadcast series with a promise: the characters, their snappy banter and the show's key notes will be honored.But the four-part \"Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life\" is aimed at more than true believers, creator Amy Sherman-Palladino said in an interview.\"We want it to be something that fans are going to know, but if you haven't watched 'Gilmore' you can come to it fresh and take it on face value: It's a story of three women, an intergenerational, multigenerational story, and you are catching them at times that each of their lives is changing.\"That trio around which the universe rotates consists of devoted single mom Lorelai Gilmore (Lauren Graham), her equally devoted daughter Rory (Alexis Bledel) and stern grandmother Emily (Kelly Bishop). As the first chapter opens, Lorelai and Rory are still the belles of fictional Connecticut hamlet Stars Hollow — so perfect, quips Lorelai, it belongs in a snow globe.Luke (Scott Patterson), Lorelai's on-again, off-again love is here, as are the supporting characters who gave the show, well, character. That includes official town nudge Taylor (now lobbying for a sewer system); reliably idiosyncratic Kirk (he's just launched Ooober, a non-app version of Uber) and even, in one episode, buoyant chef Sookie (courtesy of film star Melissa McCarthy's return to her TV roots).Whatever bliss viewers find in the girl-power dramedy's resurrection may be exceeded only by that of Sherman-Palladino, who wrote and produced it with Dan Palladino, her husband and creative partner on the sequel and the original.\"It was literally like no time had passed,\" Sherman-Palladino told a TV critics' news conference. \"It was joyous. It was fun. It was exhilarating. It was the old show. ... It was just like it was meant to continue.\"Graham sees \"Gilmore Girls\" as a welcome refuge from hard-edged TV and our prickly modern reality in general.\"I think it's because it's extremely comforting in a world that is lacking comfort and has a great choice of shows available that are stressful — great, but stressful, and so this kind of stands out in the way that it did then,\" she said.There's a sad shadow, however, cast by the passing of family head Richard Gilmore. That reflects the December 2014 death of Edward Herrmann, the respected actor who played him in the original series.\"We all really felt his loss, and he would have loved it (working on the sequel) so much,\" Graham said in an interview. \"But I think the way the story is handled is a really nice tribute to him.\" The 90-minute episodes follow the seasons and are titled for each, starting with \"Winter.\" While Lorelai and Emily face Richard's death in their own way, they also find their relationship affected by it.Rory's romantic past is a factor as all of her ex-boyfriends appear in the series \"one way or another,\" said Bledel. So is the character's journalism career, and while Bledel is aware that her character's love life intrigues viewers, she'd like them to consider the complete young woman.\"There is so much more to her character that it's great when people focus on those things, on her ambition and her accomplishments and her goals,\" the actress said.Given that all the episodes will be made available at once on streaming service Netflix, Sherman-Palladino sees trouble on the horizon.After holding close the four words she's long said should end the Gilmore saga (she wasn't in charge of the show's last season on the CW network), she wants viewers to avoid spoiling the experience, either by posting the phrase or by impatiently jumping to the final scene.\"It's going to mean a lot more if you've taken the journey, and it's going to mean a lot less if you just flip to the last page. ... It's a fun trip. It's worth it,\" she said.And does it end with \"A Year in the Life\"? Sherman-Palladino plays verbal dodgeball with the question: \"It's what it is right now. We put these together. We told these stories. And now we throw them out to the universe.\"Leave it to Kirk — OK, actor Sean Gunn, who plays him — to provide a skewed ray of hope that, perhaps, there will be more \"Gilmore Girls.\"\"I don't want to start any rumors, because I don't know,\" Gunn cautioned. \"But to take a step back and address that as a fan of the show, if the interest is there and we can get the scheduling right and Amy and Dan want to do it, I don't know why we wouldn't be able to, really.\"So the miniseries' ending leaves an opening?\"The Earth does not get destroyed by a meteor at the end,\" he said, wryly. \"So the possibility of more must live out there somewhere.\"___Lynn Elber is a national television columnist for The Associated Press.

      "text": "Like Us On Facebook Like Us On Facebook \nOn Monday, Netflix released the trailer for “Barry,” the biopic on a young Barack Obama during his junior year at Columbia University in New York City. \nIf you weren’t already an emotional wreck about Obama’s time in the White House coming to an end , this will probably help you get there. \nForget Netflix and chill, this is going to be more like Netflix and weep uncontrollably. Giphy \nThe movie, which is set to be released on December 16 , examines what life was like for 20-year-old Obama trying to find his place in the world as a college student in 1981. \nThis is basically yet another movie about a college student having no idea who they really are or what they want to do, except it’s about the first black president in US history. \nIn the past, President Obama has spoken about his struggles to form an identity as a multiracial man who was raised by his white mother, and this movie seems to dig deeper into how Obama dealt with these issues as a young man. \nFor the president, it seems being multiracial has, in many ways, helped him define what America means to him and what it truly means to be American. \nThat’s what this film seems to be about: Obama discovering that being mixed race doesn’t mean he had to choose a particular identity, because being American means being connected to many different identities and perspectives all at once. \nThe young Obama in “Barry” is portrayed by Australian actor Devon Terrell, and Ashley Judd plays his mother, Ann Dunham. \nAccording to Variety’s Owen Glieberman, the movie “ feels bracingly authentic .” \nThe film’s director, Vikram Gandhi, who you might know from HBO’s “Vice,” is also a graduate of Columbia University. \nApparently, there were still many stories told of Obama’s exploits at the university up to the point Gandhi became a student, Huffington Post reports . \nWith America’s political system going through a period of discord at the moment, this movie could be a welcome and hopeful escape in the coming weeks. \nIf nothing else, it might offer more insight into the many struggles the US has faced in the past, and what we might need to do to overcome our present obstacles.",

      "title": "Netflix 4K Streaming Comes To PC, But Only If You’re Running Windows 10 And Kaby Lake",
      "text": "by Brandon Hill   Netflix 4K Streaming Comes To PC, But Only If You’re Running Windows 10 And Kaby Lake Netflix 4K streaming support has long been in place for high-end televisions and streaming boxes, but those with [seemingly] 4K -capable hardware on the PC have been left on the sidelines. That is until today — Netflix has announced that 4K streaming is coming to the PC, but the system requirements are so confined at this point that it’s unlikely that your current rig is supported.\nFor starters, you’ll need to be running Windows 10 and specifically use the Edge browser . While some enthusiasts may balk at using Windows 10, this is actually the least restrictive requirement. You’ll of course need at least a 4K display at your disposal, but most importantly, you’ll need to be running a Intel’s 7th generation Kaby Lake processors (due to its support for the 10-bit HEVC 4K video codec; something that isn’t found in Skylake or older Intel processors). \nConsidering that Kaby Lake is only currently available for notebooks and convertibles, finding a device that actually supports all of these requirements for 4K Netflix streaming on the PC will be quite difficult to come across. Whatever the case, Microsoft and Netflix seem to be using the arrival of 4K support mostly to hype up the upcoming release of Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life . \nAnd Microsoft once again uses its promotion of Edge to carpet bomb Google Chrome , with Microsoft’s Mollie Ruiz-Hopper writing, “When streaming Netflix on Microsoft Edge you can get through at least one more full episode of Gilmore Girls than when streaming on Chrome on battery – and you know one episode can be the difference between Chris and Lorelai casually dating and being a married couple.” \nSo while it’s a bit disheartening to see that those running Skylake won’t be able to stream in 4K, we’re sure that you can have a better experience by watching Netflix 4K content on your big screen TV instead of huddling around your desktop monitor (or notebook) screen.",

      "text": "NEW YORK — Comedian Dave Chappelle is headed back to TV with his first concert specials in a dozen years — a trio of specials to be released on Netflix simultaneously in 2017.\nNo exact date was given by Netflix, which said one of the specials is being produced exclusively for the network. Two additional never-before-seen specials \"come directly from Chappelle's personal comedy vault,\" Netflix said.\nChappelle's comedy career includes movie roles in \"The Nutty Professor,\" ''Con Air\" and \"Blue Streak.\" In 2003, he achieved heightened fame and critical acclaim as mastermind of his Comedy Central sketch series, \"Chappelle's Show,\" until his abrupt exit in its third season.\nEarlier this month, he made his hosting debut on NBC's \"Saturday Night Live,\" mixing one-liners with serious jabs at race relations and politics.",

      "text": "45 shares \nNetflix is one of the biggest providers of 4K content, but you generally can’t actually watch anything 4K on anything but Smart TVs or 4K streaming devices, even if you pay for a full 4K subscription. If you’re watching on your computer or phone, you’ll be stuck on 1080p at the most. \nNow the company is finally opening up 4K streaming to PCs … but only under very specific conditions. \nOne, it has to be on Microsoft Edge’s browser, so you’ll need to be running Windows 10. \nThis is despite the fact that Netflix has its own native Windows 10 app. And naturally, that automatically rules out Macs. \nTwo, you need to have a 4K-capable screen. There doesn’t appear to be a QHD streaming or other intermediate resolutions. \nThat’s despite the fact that there are many laptops, monitors, and phones with 1440p+ resolutions that would benefit from the quality boost of 4K. Heck, I bet there are more people with 1440p+ computer screens than 4K TVs. \nThree, the PCs must be on a 7th Gen Kaby Lake Intel processor. That means not even the new Surface Studio , with its beautiful 4500 x 3000 display, can watch display Netflix at the best quality. \nIt’s an unfortunate limitation I can play a 4K YouTube video on the Surface non-pro 3 without a hitch. Maybe Microsoft wanted to ensure battery efficiency, but I watch Netflix just as often with my laptop plugged in. \nThe most likely reason for this is security. All Kaby Lake processors come with native support for HDCP 2.2 , a protocol used to prevent the copying of 4K video. \nStill, at least its a small step in the right direction. Here’s to hoping Netflix relaxes its rules soon.",

      "text": "July 19, 2016 | 09:11AM PT \n“ Making a Murderer ” will return to Netflix with new episodes, the streaming network announced Tuesday. \nThe new installments will take fans of the documentary series back inside the story of convicted murderer Steven Avery, and his co-defendant, Brendan Dassey, as their respective investigative and legal teams challenge their convictions and the State fights to have the convictions and life sentences upheld. This next chapter will provide an in-depth look at the high-stakes post-conviction process, as well as the emotional toll the process takes on all involved. Executive producers and co-directors Laura Ricciardi and Moira Demos are once again helming the project, with an exact episode count and premiere date for Season 2 yet to be announced. Related ‘Making a Murderer’ Defendants Still Feeling Impact From Series \nThe episodes will offer exclusive access to Avery’s new lawyer Kathleen Zellner and Dassey’s legal team, led by Laura Nirider and Steve Drizin, as well as intimate access to the families and characters close to the case. \n“We are extremely grateful for the tremendous response to, and support of, the series. The viewers’ interest and attention has ensured that the story is not over, and we are fully committed to continuing to document events as they unfold,” said creators Ricciardi and Demos. Related What to Watch After ‘Making a Murderer’ \n“Because of Ricciardi’s and Demos’ incredible vision, commitment and keen eye, audiences around the globe became completely captivated by the personal stories of Steven Avery and Brendan Dassey and the unique lens their experiences provide into the criminal justice system,” said Lisa Nishimura, Netflix VP of Original Documentary Programming. “We’re thrilled to be continuing our longstanding relationship with the filmmakers, and look forward to giving our global viewers eagerly anticipated updates on this story.” Filed Under:",

By Elahe Izadi November 21 at 1:54 PM Follow @ElaheIzadi Dave Chappelle performs to a sold-out crowd onstage at the Hollywood Palladium on March 25 in Los Angeles. (Lester Cohen) \nComedy fans were elated when word came earlier this month that Dave Chappelle would be hosting “Saturday Night Live.” The elusive and incredibly popular stand-up comic hadn’t told jokes for a television audience in years, and his post-election episode brought in season-high ratings . \nIt turns out his “SNL” monologue was just a teaser for more material: Netflix announced Monday that it will release three new stand-up specials from the comedy giant. \nOne of them, an original special recorded specifically for Netflix, has no set premiere date, but in 2017 the streaming service will release a pair of unseen concert specials from Chappelle’s “personal comedy vault.” They were filmed at Austin City Limits and the Hollywood Palladium. \n“Dave Chappelle is a legendary voice in comedy — searing, vital, and now more than ever, essential,” Lisa Nishimura, Netflix vice president of original documentary and comedy, said in a release. “Dave’s three new specials promise to be some of the most anticipated events in comedy, and we are honored he will mark his global return on Netflix.” [ Read Dave Chappelle’s entire SNL monologue: ‘It’s been a long time’ ] \nHis last special, “Dave Chappelle: For What It’s Worth,” was released in 2004 and directed by Stan Lathan, who will direct all the new Netflix specials. \nChappelle, considered one of the greatest active stand-up comics, famously began performing as a teenager in Washington, D.C. He became a masterful comic, recorded several stand-up specials and landed various movie roles, including a part in the 1998 movie “Half Baked,” a cult favorite that he co-wrote. \nBut he catapulted to fame in the early 2000s with his wildly popular sketch comedy show, “Chappelle’s Show.” The Comedy Central series was marked by Chappelle’s unabashed and biting approach to joking about race and racism. But as the show took off, he became more uncomfortable with how the public was receiving his work. \nChappelle reportedly walked away from a $50 million deal to film a third and fourth season, and his departure to South Africa fueled rumors about his well-being. He told Time in 2005 that he had gone overseas for solitude and quiet. [ Dave Chappelle is the perfect host for the first ‘Saturday Night Live’ in Trump’s America ] \nHe also explained his decision to walk away from the show in 2006, telling Oprah, “I was doing sketches that were funny, but socially irresponsible. I felt like I was deliberately being encouraged and I was overwhelmed. It’s like you’re being flooded with things, and you don’t pay attention to things like your ethics.” Comedian Dave Chappelle made his hosting debut on \"Saturday Night Live.\" Here are some of the highlights. (Thomas Johnson/The Washington Post) \nChappelle has been absent from the small screen since, but he has been performing. If you wanted to see his new material, you had to see it live. \nAnd he has been prolific, too. In April 2007, he set a record for the longest performance at Laugh Factory in Los Angeles , with a six-hour, seven-minute set. (The previous record was nearly four hours shorter, set by Dane Cook.) Months later, Chappelle broke his record with another marathon set. \nAlthough elusive, he became known for dropping into comedy clubs and performing unannounced sets. But the popularity of “Chappelle’s Show” continued to plague him, as reports emerged of audience members interrupting his performances by yelling quotes from the Comedy Central show. During a 2013 comedy festival performance in Hartford, Conn., audience members heckled him , yelling, “I’m Rick James.” [ Chris Rock isn’t the only comedian who thinks cellphones are killing stand-up comedy ] \nThat prompted the comedian to stop and declare that he didn’t need to tell any more jokes, he just had to be on stage for the time stipulated by his contract. Some audience members then began booing. “You’re booing yourself,” Chappelle told them . “I want you to go home and look in the mirror and say ‘Boo.’ Remember, that’s how I feel about you.” \nIt seems that his audiences have calmed down since. Chappelle performed 10 consecutive shows at Radio City Music Hall in 2014. \nAccording to Netflix, Chappelle has performed more than 500 concerts in the past three years. \nThe deal with Chappelle continues Netflix’s dominance over highly anticipated comedic releases. The streaming service will also put out two new specials from Chris Rock, after an eight-year absence. Rock will record one of those specials in 2017, following a world tour. \nThe streaming service’s deal with Rock reportedly reached $40 million, according to Variety . \nRead more:",

      "text": "NEW YORK — Comedian Dave Chappelle is headed back to TV with his first concert specials in a dozen years — a trio of specials to be released on Netflix simultaneously in 2017.\nNo exact date was given by Netflix, which said one of the specials is being produced exclusively for the network. Two additional never-before-seen specials “come directly from Chappelle’s personal comedy vault,” Netflix said.\nChappelle’s comedy career includes movie roles in “The Nutty Professor,” ‘’Con Air” and “Blue Streak.” In 2003, he achieved heightened fame and critical acclaim as mastermind of his Comedy Central sketch series, “Chappelle’s Show,” until his abrupt exit in its third season.\nEarlier this month, he made his hosting debut on NBC’s “Saturday Night Live,” mixing one-liners with serious jabs at race relations and politics.\nCopyright 2016 The Associated Press.

Who cares if we have yet to hear a joke? We already know Chappelle’s forthcoming standup specials will be genius because OMG, they *have* to be. Plus he offers the comedic relief we need in stressful times, as proven by his hilarious election night Saturday Night Live sketch .\nAccording to The Daily Dot , Netflix confirmed Chappelle specials on Twitter and even though we’ve seen it with our own eyes, it’s still hard to believe. As the site points out, we haven’t seen a comedy special from the comedian since 2004’s Dave Chappelle: For What It’s Worth , so this announcement feels totally unreal.\nNews: 3 new Dave Chappelle comedy specials, coming soon. pic.twitter.com/OzrDukBPk6 \n— Netflix US (@netflix) November 21, 2016 Chappelle will team up with producer Stan Lathan for the exclusive Netflix special, which will be accompanied by previously unreleased performances that were taped at Austin City Limits and the Hollywood Palladium.\nWe’re so #sorrynotsorry, but there’s absolutely no way we can stay calm, guys.\n\nSIGH. This is probably the best news we’ve heard all day. We owe endless thanks to Chappelle for giving us at least three wonderful things to look forward to next year.\nThe post OMG Dave Chappelle will have THREE specials on Netflix next year appeared first on HelloGiggles .",

      "text": "4K Netflix is finally available on Windows 10 PCs But you'll want to check your specs before you upgrade your streaming plan. Save Pascal Le Segretain/Getty Images \nNetflix has been pushing out 4K content to its apps on streaming boxes and Smart TVs for awhile, but the entertainment industry's anti-piracy crusade and some DRM limitations have meant PC users looking to stream ultra HD episodes of Bloodline have been out of luck until now. Starting today, Netflix's 4K content is available to stream on Windows 10 PCs -- but only if your machine is a fairly recent one. \nThe catch: you'll need a new or new-ish Windows 10 PC with a seventh-gen Intel Kaby Lake processor and 4K display to take advantage. So, your options are basically limited to the Lenovo Yoga 910 and a handful of gaming laptops and desktop machines at the moment. Assuming your hardware is good to go, you'll also need to upgrade to the $12 monthly Premium subscription with Ultra HD streaming. Users with older Home Theater PCs are still out of luck, unfortunately. \nOn the bright side, the new partnership with Netflix -- which includes getting Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life in 4K a few days before everyone else -- gives Redmond the opportunity to tout battery life improvements they've made to their very own Edge browser . According to Microsoft, you'll be able to squeeze in one more episode before your battery dies if you're streaming on Edge instead of Chrome. Of course, a Chromecast Ultra would also do the trick.",

      "text": "Tweet \nThe biggest Marvel news of the past week concerned The Inhumans , who we’ll formally see first as a television show, with a big screen IMAX pilot debut in lieu of a feature film. The film was removed from Marvel’s announced slate earlier this year, and for those who follow Agents of SHIELD , the change feels like a more organic evolution of threads that were started on that show. They’ve already been using “Inhumans” - people with altered DNA who receive powers when exposed to a substance called Terrigen mists - without touching the identifiable Inhumans royal family. \nThat’s the group that includes long-time Marvel characters like Black Bolt, Medusa, Crystal, and Lockjaw (you can read our character guide here ). It’s easy to imagine those characters being the ones they use in the IMAX debut, especially since Collider is reporting some of the IMAX footage will take place on the moon - the home of the Inhumans’ secret city of Attilan. The bad news is that if the rumors of Vin Diesel as Black Bolt were ever true, that’s likely not happening now; Diesel commands more salary than a TV budget might allow. \nIt’s another “win” for Marvel’s hardcore TV faithful, who have been steadfast on Agents of SHIELD , while the rest of us may have dropped off only to tune back in recently to see what this Ghost Rider stuff is all about. That’s right - if you haven’t been paying attention, Ghost Rider is a regular addition on the most reason season of the show. With the Inhumans, this bolsters ABC’s roster of superheroes quite a bit. There were complaints in Season 1 that the ABC show didn’t have enough recognizable superheroes, but that’s not quite the case anymore. \nIn the tradition of just about every Marvel crossover ever, it’s time to pit heroes against heroes. We wouldn’t be good Marvel fans if we were making up hypothetical battles. It’s inevitable; we got Captain America: Civil War in 2016 and on the comics side, Marvel is following Civil War II with the IVX (X-Men Vs. Inhumans) crossover. Even DC Comics decided Superman and Batman might be better punching each other than teaming up. \nWith that spirit in mind, let’s look at the rosters of Netflix’s television superheroes against ABC’s. Only one team can survive. On the Netflix side, we have Daredevil, Jessica Jones, Luke Cage, Iron Fist, and non-powered outliers like Punisher, Misty Knight, and Patsy Walker. Knight and Walker are superheroes in the comics but haven’t been treated as such on their shows. We’ll even throw Elektra in the mix. \nOn the ABC team, we’ve got Deathlok, Mockingbird, Ghost Rider, Quake, the established Inhuman Lash and presumably the Inhumans royal family. That’d be Black Bolt, Medusa, Crystal, Trigon, Karnak, Gorgon, and Lockjaw. I would’ve easily given the battle to Netflix, but with the Inhumans added, does it tip the scales in ABC’s favor? We think before last week, everyone would’ve given the outcome to Netflix, but now we’re not so sure. That’s what I’m relying on you to find out. We’re still a ways away from The Inhumans on TV, but it’s still a fair question - who has the coolest roster of Marvel superheroes on television?",

Two additional never-before-seen specials \"come directly from Chappelle's personal comedy vault,\" Netflix said.\nChappelle's comedy career includes movie roles in \"The Nutty Professor,\" ''Con Air\" and \"Blue Streak.\" In 2003, he achieved heightened fame and critical acclaim as mastermind of his Comedy Central sketch series, \"Chappelle's Show,\" until his abrupt exit in its third season.\nEarlier this month, he made his hosting debut on NBC's \"Saturday Night Live,\" mixing one-liners with serious jabs at race relations and politics.\n ",

      "text": "The e-commerce giant is looking to acquire the rights to a broad range of sporting events. \nIt’s only been a few days since the news broke that Amazon is rolling out its Prime Video streaming service in more than 200 countries to go head-to-head with Netflix . And now the e-commerce giant is said to be looking at putting together a premium sports package to go with it.\nThe company has been in talks with a wide range of different sports leagues about acquiring broadcasting rights, according to a report in the Wall Street Journal .\nObviously, Amazon would probably be most interested in the top National Basketball Association, Major League Baseball, and National Football League events, but it is also talking to the National Lacrosse League and the World Surf League, the newspaper’s sources said.\nThe big problem with trying to buy up basketball, football, and baseball programming is that the major networks—especially ESPN—have already locked up most of them for the next decade or so.\nFor example, the deal that ESPN has with the NBA doesn’t end until 2024, and the rights packages that ESPN, CBS and NBC have for National Football League games run into the next decade as well. Even college football teams have locked up rights with various cable networks.\nESPN’s parent Disney is also looking to expand its streaming offerings, including a new service that is expected to be launched soon. That’s why the entertainment giant recently spent $1 billion to buy a stake in BAMTech, the tech provider that handles streaming for Major League Baseball and a number of other clients including ESPN.\nAccording to the Journal , Amazon is “keenly aware” that the NFL Sunday Ticket games offered by DirecTV helped give that cable competitor a boost when it first launched, and therefore Amazon wants to do something similar by signing up whatever sports it can.\nAs with almost everything Amazon does, the content in this case is just a lure to get customers to sign up for its Prime subscription service, which generates significant returns for the company and now incorporates everything from free shipping on products to a Spotify-style music service.\nThere’s one big reason why we shouldn’t dismiss either the online giant’s sports ambitions or its global Netflix competitor: Namely, Amazon’s $380 billion market capitalization, and the massive river of cash that spins out of its Amazon Web Services division, where hundreds of Fortune 500 companies store their data. It generates about $10 billion in revenue every year.\nThat’s definitely enough to spend buying up sporting rights. All Amazon has to do is find someone who is willing to sell and who hasn’t already cut a deal with an existing network.\nThis story originally appeared on Fortune.com . Copyright 2016 \n",

These releases will be Chappelle's first concert specials in 12 years.\n\"Dave Chappelle is a legendary voice in comedy -- searing, vital, and now more than ever, essential,\" said Lisa Nishimura, vice president of original documentary and comedy at Netflix. \"Dave's three new specials promise to be some of the most anticipated events in comedy, and we are honored he will mark his global return on Netflix.\"\nThe announcement comes just weeks after Chappelle's successful stint hosting the post-election episode of \"Saturday Night Live,\" which attracted the show's highest ratings in the last three years.\nNo premiere date has been announced for any of the upcoming specials, though the performances from Chappelle's archives are expected to debut simultaneously in 2017.\n(c)2016 Los Angeles Times\nVisit the Los Angeles Times at www.latimes.com\nDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.\nShare Comment",

But El Popo, as locals call it, rebuffed them with ash and belches of acrid gas—precisely what the scientists wanted to measure. They settled for installing the sensor lower down the mountain, and hope to move it higher next year. The goal is to measure just what—and how much—El Popo has been smoking, because the fumes may hold a promising way to forecast eruptions.",

Getty By Megan Friedman Nov 21, 2016 Dave Chappelle helped lead Saturday Night Live to its best ratings in three years, and his hosting duties helped everyone heal after a shocking election result. And he's not stopping there. According to The Hollywood Reporter , he's signed a deal with Netflix to air his first comedy specials in 12 years. Two of the specials will be from his own personal vault; one was filmed in Austin in April 2015 and the other was filmed in Los Angeles in March of this year. The third will be a new original special, created just for Netflix. And all three will be released at the exact same time, sometime in 2017. Haven't binge-watched stand-up comedy on Netflix before?

      "text": "by Kate Stanhope\nDave Chappelle is headed to Netflix.\nThe stand-up comic has set three new stand-up comedy specials at the streaming giant, it was announced Monday.\nChappelle and director Stan Lathan will produce an original stand-up comedy special exclusively for Netflix, with its premiere date to be announced. The two other never-before-seen specials hail directly from Chappelle’s personal comedy vault. Directed by Lathan and filmed at Austin City Limits and the Hollywood Palladium, the specials mark the comedian’s first concert specials in 12 years and are slated to be released simultaneously in 2017.\n“Dave Chappelle is a legendary voice in comedy — searing, vital, and now more than ever, essential,” Lisa Nishimura, Netflix VP, original docuementary and comedy, said. “Dave’s three new specials promise to be some of the most anticipated events in comedy, and we are honored he will mark his global return on Netflix.”\nThe news comes fresh off Chappelle’s SNL hosting debut, which nabbed the show its best rating in three years. The specials will also mark Chappelle’s first major TV project since he surprisingly and suddenly stepped away from his Comedy Central sketch series Chappelle’s Show in 2005 arguably at the height of the show’s popularity. The comedian subsequently spent several years out of the public eye, but has slowly returned to the mainstream. He performed 10 sold-out shows at Radio City Music Hall in 2014, and also appeared in a small roll in Spike Lee’s film Chi-Raq last year. He has continued to perform stand-up across the country, performing over 500 shows in the past three years.\nFor Netflix, the deal comes not long after the streaming giant landed two new stand-up specials from Chris Rock as part of a stunning $40 million deal. As it ramps up originals, the streamer has become a major player in the stand-up space, competiting against Comedy Central and HBO, among other platforms. Earlier this year, the streamer was able to land Dana Carvey’s first stand-up special in 20 years. In September, Patton Oswalt won an Emmy for his Netflix stand-up special, Talking for Clapping.\n“For us, it’s about having enough of a global audience and anticipated engagement that we can get behind all of these projects,” Nishimura told THR earlier this month when discussing Rock’s highly anticipated specials.",
