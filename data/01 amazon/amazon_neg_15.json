      "text": "Amazon Prime discounted to £59 for 'The Grand Tour' launch You can't watch Clarkson and co. without it. Save Tim P. Whitby/Getty Images for Amazon Prime Video \nGood news: The Grand Tour , Amazon's answer to Top Gear, is now only three days away from release. The bad news is that you'll need a Prime subscription to watch it. Amazon knows this, so it's sweetening the deal by slashing £20 off the price of its annual subscription for anyone who has yet to sign up. \nBetween now and November 18th, when the first weekly episode of The Grand Tour debuts, Amazon Prime will cost £59. That brings it down to roughly £5 per month. It's not the first time Amazon has done it -- the company quickly reduced the price shortly after confirming the name of its new motoring show in May -- but it'll likely be enough to tempt fans of Clarkson and co., who may have never previously considered a subscription, into jumping aboard the Prime bandwagon. \nSince signing the former Top Gear team, Amazon has put Jeremy Clarkson to work. He's now the face of adverts for the Fire TV and Fire TV Stick and recently became the voice (alongside Hammond and May) of a particularly annoying alarm notification for Amazon's Echo speaker. You can probably expect more TV spots as the show's launch draws nearer. \nEven if you're not a motoring fan, Amazon's Prime discount is still good value. Black Friday is approaching, meaning you can make use of the \"free\" next-day delivery, but the membership also provides access to music streaming and thousands of other TV shows and movies.",

      "text": "Amazon is determined to dominate all areas of online shopping, be that new products, products offered by third-party sellers, and of course digital downloads. But Jeff Bezos' company has also embraced used items and runs a trade-in program where gift cards are offered in exchange for goods.\nTypically, trading in an item takes around 10 days to ship and be processed before payment is received. However, if you want to trade video games , Amazon's service just got a lot quicker as the gift card credit is now added to your account instantly.\nTo take advantage of the offer there's a simple 3 step process to follow:\nSubmit the item you wish to trade after checking it is on the eligible list Receive your gift card credit instantly Ship the item using a prepaid shipping label from a UPS location You may receive credit instantly, but Amazon expects to have the item traded for the credit shipped within 7 days. Once the item is received, Amazon will verify its condition and decide whether or not to accept it. If rejected, an item will be returned to the customer without any fees being applied for shipping it back. If found to be counterfeit, Amazon will dispose of the item.\n\nThe value of individual items will depend on their condition, but Amazon has shared examples of what prices it is willing to pay for some of the more popular video game products out there this year:\nNintendo Wii U Console: up to $150 Sony PlayStation 4 500GB Console: up to $170 Microsoft Xbox One 500GB: up to $115 FIFA 17: up to $25 Paper Mario Color Splash: up to $30 Gears of War 4: up to $26 Amazon has posted details of the condition it expects games, consoles, and accessories to be in to qualify for trade-in credit. It's certainly worth reading before deciding what to trade.\nFor now, the \"Instant Payment\" offer is limited to video games, but there's every chance it will be expanded to other product categories if it proves successful for video games over the holiday season.",

      "text": "0 \nIt’s been seven months since a judge said that Amazon is liable for kids’ “accidental” in-app purchases . And just recently, the federal judge said that the top e-commerce site should start setting up a year-long plan to give back parents the money and reimburse them for those accidental purchases. A lump-sum payout worth over $26.5 million was suggested at first by a US regulator but was rejected. The result now is reimbursement which is actually slow but sure. \nAmazon is liable and John Coughenour, a U.S. District Judge in Seattle issued an order to pay the parents of kids who purchased apps without their knowledge. Collectively, those “accidents” racked up to about $86 million of charges that as we can describe now as unauthorized. \nThe case has been open since July 2014 when FTC accused Amazon of making it easy for everyone, the kids especially, to purchase apps and run bills. This order now calls parents to receive reimbursement this coming 2017. Parents are eligible to receive funds and they are guaranteed to receive them. \nAmazon’s first request to have the refunds be issued as gift cards was refused and the judge said they will only “undoubtedly recapture some of the profits that are at issue.” This is not the first problem with in-app purchases we’ve heard. Google and Apple both faced similar issues when the FTC filed cases against them back in 2014.",

Between free 2-day shipping, Prime Instant Video, Amazon Music, Amazon Drive, and so much more, the service is more than worth it's asking price of $99 in the US and £79 in the UK. If you happen to live in the latter of those two countries and still haven't subscribed to the service though, now might be a better time than ever to do so. In honor of the launch of Amazon's latest original series, The Grand Tour , the company is offering residents in the UK a discount on an Amazon Prime subscription. Rather than having to pay the regular price of £79 for a year of Prime, new subscribers in the UK will be able to get their first year of Prime for just £59. The offer goes up on November 18, and it is worth noting that after the first year, the price will then go back up to the regular cost of £79. As for The Grand Tour , the show will debut in both the UK and the US on November 18 and features the original crew from Top Gear. It certainly does sound like it could make for a great program, and if you've yet to hop on the Amazon Prime bandwagon in the United Kingdom, you now have no excuse not to do so.",

Somewhere between £1m and £4m.’\nThe Grand Tour debuts on Amazon Prime this Friday, and you can buy a subscription here .\nMORE: Jeremy Clarkson says he is heading for an early grave ahead of The Grand Tour debut \nMORE: There could be a sneaky way to watch The Grand Tour cheaper than expected ",

      "text": "Share \nIn the wake of Donald Trump’s surprise election a week ago, the stock market has divided in half. One of those halves is soaring, the other… not so much. \nTech is the not so much — and its losses have been heavy since the market’s bull run beginning when Trump acceded to president-elect status. The concerned consensus is that Donald Trump’s immigration and trade policies will take a bite of tech firms’ earnings to come. \nApple Inc., Facebook Inc. and Alphabet Inc. led the S&P 500 Information Technology Index down 1.7 percent in what was its biggest retreat since September — and that cluster of firms sticks out particularly, since the old normal was that these firms tend to rise in sync with the economy as a whole. Tech stocks in the benchmark equity gauge have slumped 3.1 percent over four days, trailing the S&P 500 Index by 4.2 percentage points, the most since May 2009. \nAgain, all of this is a pretty big reversal for tech — which is the largest group in the S&P 500 and one of the only ones to consistently post earnings growth over the last 18 months. Insiders — apart from citing trade and immigration issues — are in some cases also flat-out alleging campaign retaliation for the fact that Silicon Valley and its denizens overwhelmingly broke for Hillary Clinton during the election cycle. “Technology provides the productivity gains for the global economy and many of the large-cap names like Apple and Amazon were carrying the torch for the market,” Channing Smith, a managing director at Capital Advisors Inc. in Tulsa, Oklahoma, said by phone. The firm oversees about $1.8 billion. “Without their participating, that’s definitely going to create a headwind for the market.” Headwinds that could be buttressed by the fact that the biggest players are getting hit the hardest. The FANG block — Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google (technically it’s Alphabet now, but FANA is less cool-sounding than FANG) have each fallen at least 2.4 percent. And the drops just keep on coming — since the election, none of the FANG gang have notched anything but losses, and have instead shrunk 8 percent for the worst retreat since February. Amazon has been particularly hard hit — since Jeff Bezos found himself in something of a feud with Trump during the election. Trump accused Bezos of purchasing the Washington Post to gain political influence and avoid antitrust scrutiny. Shares of the online retailer have lost more than $30 billion in value since Tuesday’s vote. \n“It’s a big deal with what potentially Trump could do,” said Blake Harper, an analyst that covers internet stocks at Loop Capital Markets LLC in Chicago. “If you look at investors in Alphabet, Facebook and Amazon, they’re stacking some type of operationality for them to continue to expand internationally and also expand into other different categories outside their core markets,” he said. “He definitely indicated he would pursue antitrust measures against companies like Amazon. You’d have more restrictive policies to prohibit expansion.” \nFor now, the market seems to be holding up, with S&P 500 trading within 1.2 percent of an all-time high, as the retreat in tech stocks has been countered by rallies in financial and industrial companies. \nBanks were up 2.3 percent Monday, extending their gains since Trump’s victory to 11 percent, while industrial stocks have added 5.2 percent in that time. \n“The market is getting ahead of itself here and selling off and being hard on tech,” said Timothy Ghriskey, who helps manage $1.5 billion as chief investment officer at Solaris Asset Management LLC in New York. “Tech is where a lot of gains were, so as money gets shifted around to different sectors, meaning into financials and into health care and industrials, it has to come out of somewhere and a lot of it has come out of tech.”",

      "text": "Amazon Announces the Best Books of 2016, Naming Colson Whitehead’s The Underground Railroad the #1 Book of the Year\nAmazon book editors reveal the 100 best books of the year, selecting titles in over two dozen categories from Literary Fiction and Mystery to Children’s & Young Adult\n(NASDAQ:AMZN)—Amazon.com today announced its selections for the Best Books of 2016, naming Colson Whitehead’s novel The Underground Railroad the Best Book of the Year. The annual list features the Top 100 books of the year plus Top 20 lists across various categories. All lists are hand-selected by Amazon’s team of editors who read hundreds of thousands of pages throughout the year—choosing the best books of every month and then, finally, the best books of the year. To see the full list of the Best Books of 2016 and buy the print or Kindle editions, visit: http://amazon.com/bestbooks2016\n“The editorial team had a handful of books that we seriously considered for the top pick but in the end our choice of The Underground Railroad was unanimous,” said Chris Schluep, Amazon Senior Book Editor. “Colson Whitehead’s novel is timely, important, and a great work of literature.”\nHere are the Amazon Editorial Team’s Top 10 picks this year:\nThe Underground Railroad by Colson Whitehead : A brilliant, wise, fantastical yet grounded portrayal of a young slave seeking her freedom on a real underground railroad. The Wolf Road by Beth Lewis : Part literary thriller, part western, this is a debut novel about a young tomboy trying to survive a post-apocalyptic wilderness as she searches for her parents. Hillbilly Elegy by J.D. Vance : A very personal tour of a segment of our culture that’s losing its way in modern America. The Nix by Nathan Hill : A big, smart novel about so many things: family, politics, revolution and the things we choose to remember (and forget). Mischling by Affinity Konar : Affinity Konar’s beautiful novel about twin sisters who survive Auschwitz is precisely crafted, acutely sensitive and ultimately uplifting and hopeful. Lab Girl by Hope Jahren : An inspiring and entertaining memoir about work, life and love from a plant scientist who is just as adept at analyzing the natural world as she is at illuminating human relationships. Another Brooklyn by Jacqueline Woodson : A poetic, breathtaking novel about growing up female and black in the 1970s—a time of conflicting pressures and sometimes crushing assumptions. Pumpkinflowers by Matti Friedman : An unforgettable nonfiction account of men changed by war, told in a voice that is both straight forward and undeniably literary. Before the Fall by Noah Hawley : From the award-winning creator of Fargo, a thrilling page-turner about an airplane crash and its seemingly heroic survivors. Swing Time by Zadie Smith : A masterful novel that tackles big issues—race, class and the ups and downs of long term friendship—told with a dancer’s grace and ease. Here are some interesting facts about this year’s Best Books of the Year list:\nNumber of debut authors in the Top 20: 3 Number of science-related books in the Top 100: 6 Number of memoirs in the Top 100: 26 Number of entertainers who have authored books in the Top 100: 2 Number of books that were considered for the #1 spot on the list before the editors selected Colson Whitehead’s The Underground Railroad : 4 The top picks in Children’s categories include The Night Gardener (Picture Books), The Secret Keepers (Middle Grade – ages 9-12) and The Sun is Also a Star (Young Adult). Topping the list in other popular categories is Anthony Bourdain’s Appetites (Cookbook) and David Yarrow’s Wild Encounters (Arts & Photography).\nAbout Amazon\nAmazon is guided by four principles: customer obsession rather than competitor focus, passion for invention, commitment to operational excellence, and long-term thinking.

      "text": "Amazon Announces the Best Books of 2016 - Colson Whitehead's THE UNDERGROUND RAILROAD Hits #1 November 15   \n(NASDAQ:AMZN)-Amazon.com today announced its selections for the Best Books of 2016, naming Colson Whitehead's novel The Underground Railroad the Best Book of the Year. The annual list features the Top 100 books of the year plus Top 20 lists across various categories. All lists are hand-selected by Amazon's team of editors who read hundreds of thousands of pages throughout the year-choosing the best books of every month and then, finally, the best books of the year. To see the full list of the Best Books of 2016 and buy the print or Kindle editions, visit: http://amazon.com/bestbooks2016 \n\"The editorial team had a handful of books that we seriously considered for the top pick but in the end our choice of The Underground Railroad was unanimous,\" said Chris Schluep, Amazon Senior Book Editor. \"Colson Whitehead's novel is timely, important, and a great work of literature.\" \nHere are the Amazon Editorial Team's Top 10 picks this year: The Underground Railroad by Colson Whitehead : A brilliant, wise, fantastical yet grounded portrayal of a young slave seeking her freedom on a real underground railroad. The Wolf Road by Beth Lewis : Part literary thriller, part western, this is a debut novel about a young tomboy trying to survive a post-apocalyptic wilderness as she searches for her parents. Hillbilly Elegy by J.D. Vance : A very personal tour of a segment of our culture that's losing its way in modern America. The Nix by Nathan Hill : A big, smart novel about so many things: family, politics, revolution and the things we choose to remember (and forget). Mischling by Affinity Konar : Affinity Konar's beautiful novel about twin sisters who survive Auschwitz is precisely crafted, acutely sensitive and ultimately uplifting and hopeful. Lab Girl by Hope Jahren : An inspiring and entertaining memoir about work, life and love from a plant scientist who is just as adept at analyzing the natural world as she is at illuminating human relationships. Another Brooklyn by Jacqueline Woodson : A poetic, breathtaking novel about growing up female and black in the 1970s-a time of conflicting pressures and sometimes crushing assumptions. Pumpkinflowers by Matti Friedman : An unforgettable nonfiction account of men changed by war, told in a voice that is both straight forward and undeniably literary. Before the Fall by Noah Hawley : From the award-winning creator of Fargo, athrilling page-turner about an airplane crash and its seemingly heroic survivors. Swing Time by Zadie Smith : A masterful novel that tackles big issues-race, class and the ups and downs of long term friendship-told with a dancer's grace and ease. \nHere are some interesting facts about this year's Best Books of the Year list: Number of debut authors in the Top 20: 3 Number of science-related books in the Top 100: 6 Number of memoirs in the Top 100: 26 Number of entertainers who have authored books in the Top 100: 2 Number of books that were considered for the #1 spot on the list before the editors selected Colson Whitehead's The Underground Railroad : 4 \nThe top picks in Children's categories include The Night Gardener (Picture Books), The Secret Keepers (Middle Grade - ages 9-12) and The Sun is Also a Star (Young Adult). Topping the list in other popular categories is Anthony Bourdain's Appetites (Cookbook) and David Yarrow's Wild Encounters (Arts & Photography). \nAbout Amazon \nAmazon is guided by four principles: customer obsession rather than competitor focus, passion for invention, commitment to operational excellence, and long-term thinking.

      "text": "  Amazon Files Lawsuits in Increased Effort to Keep Fakes Off Site Published on . Most Popular \nAmazon filed two lawsuits against vendors allegedly selling counterfeit goods through its internet marketplace, stepping up efforts to keep fakes off the site heading into the holiday shopping season. \nOne suit targets ToysNet of Hacienda Heights, California; Disk Vision of Brandon, Florida; and individuals who Amazon says sold counterfeit Forearm Forklifts, straps used to carry heavy and bulky items. Amazon said it removed the fake items in June, and said Disk Vision forged an invoice to trick Amazon into reinstating the product listing. Another lawsuit targets several individuals who allegedly sold bogus TRX Suspension Trainers, an exercise system. The lawsuits were filed Monday in state court in Seattle. Amazon provided copies of the complaints, which couldn't immediately be verified in court records. Related Stories",

      "text": "Microsoft has announced a new partnership with OpenAI, the $1 billion artificial intelligence research nonprofit cofounded by Tesla CEO Elon Musk and Y Combinator President Sam Altman. \nUnder the terms of the partnership, OpenAI will use the Microsoft Azure cloud computing service as the \"preferred\" place to do its AI experiments. In return, Microsoft gets increased access to OpenAI's deep bench of robotics and experts, making Azure a better place for building AI-powered software. \n\"You want to get a good feedback loop going,\" says Microsoft Executive VP of Cloud and Enterprise Scott Guthrie. \"That helps you ultimately build a better platform.\"\nArtificial intelligence is going to be a big point of competition between Microsoft Azure, the leading Amazon Web Services , and the relative upstart Google Cloud over the months and years to come. As Guthrie says, \"any application is ultimately going to weave in AI,\" and Microsoft wants to be the company that helps developers do the weaving.\nThat's where the OpenAI partnership becomes so important, Guthrie says.\nBecause we're still in the earliest days of artificial intelligence, he says, the biggest challenge is figuring out what exactly can be done with artificial intelligence. Guthrie calls this \"understanding the art of the possible.\"\nMicrosoft \nWith OpenAI, a research institution focused largely on just that, it's a natural collaboration as they work to \"jointly build an even richer ecosystem around artificial intelligence\" and \"learn as fast as possible,\" Guthrie says.\nGuthrie highlights the fact that Microsoft customers like ThyssenKrupp and Uber are already working with Azure and its artificial intelligence capabilities to power things like fixing elevators before they actually break or making sure your driver is actually your driver.\nCombine that with Microsoft's expertise in serving large business customers and helping them build applications that can securely handle large amounts of data, and Guthrie believes  Microsoft really stands out from the pack. \n\"Combined, they help make Azure an even more differentiated platform,\" Guthrie says. \nNOW WATCH: China just showcased the world's most human-like robots, and they show how close we’re coming to Westworld reality \n",

      "text": "print Microsoft Executive VP of Cloud and Enterprise Scott Guthrie Microsoft \nMicrosoft has announced a new partnership with OpenAI , the $1 billion artificial intelligence research nonprofit cofounded by Tesla CEO Elon Musk and Y Combinator President Sam Altman . \nUnder the terms of the partnership, OpenAI will use the Microsoft Azure cloud computing service as the \"preferred\" place to do its AI experiments. In return, Microsoft gets increased access to OpenAI's deep bench of robotics and experts, making Azure a better place for building AI-powered software. \n\"You want to get a good feedback loop going,\" says Microsoft Executive VP of Cloud and Enterprise Scott Guthrie. \"That helps you ultimately build a better platform.\" \nArtificial intelligence is going to be a big point of competition between Microsoft Azure, the leading Amazon Web Services , and the relative upstart Google Cloud over the months and years to come. As Guthrie says, \"any application is ultimately going to weave in AI,\" and Microsoft wants to be the company that helps developers do the weaving. \nThat's where the OpenAI partnership becomes so important, Guthrie says. \nBecause we're still in the earliest days of artificial intelligence, he says, the biggest challenge is figuring out what exactly can be done with artificial intelligence. Guthrie calls this \"understanding the art of the possible.\" \nElon Musk jurvetson / Flickr \nWith OpenAI, a research institution focused largely on just that, it's a natural collaboration as they work to \"jointly build an even richer ecosystem around artificial intelligence\" and \"learn as fast as possible,\" Guthrie says. \nGuthrie highlights the fact that Microsoft customers like ThyssenKrupp and Uber are already working with Azure and its artificial intelligence capabilities to power things like fixing elevators before they actually break or making sure your driver is actually your driver. \nCombine that with Microsoft's expertise in serving large business customers and helping them build applications that can securely handle large amounts of data, and Guthrie believes Microsoft really stands out from the pack. \n\"Combined, they help make Azure an even more differentiated platform,\" Guthrie says.

      "text": "Amazon Refunds: Parents Are Getting Cash Pay Back For Children's Unauthorized In-App Purchases From 2011-2014 By Amanda Moore   15, 04:00 am Kids used their parents' Amazon's Kindle Fire to make unauthorized purchases and a judge says that the company is liable to pay back refunds. (Photo : Spencer Platt/Getty Images ) \nA federal judge has ordered Amazon to refund parents for their children's unauthorized purchases from 2011 to 2014 using the site's app. The decision follows a long-standing complaint that had the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) lodged in July 2014, citing Amazon for its failure to secure in-app purchases from children. Advertisement \nAccording to Reuters , Amazon's online store app didn't have any security feature that would prevent children from playing and purchasing items while accessing games like \"Pet Shop Story\" and \"Ice Age Village.\" These are popular among families with Amazon's Kindle Fire device. \nWith no such preventive measure, over $86 million charges have been made by children from 2011 to 2014, and unsuspecting parents have been raking up bills on their Amazon accounts. The federal judge ruled that Amazon refunds the amount to the parents in April 2016. \nYet it was only recently that the courts was able to outline the process for setting up the Amazon refunds. The court denied the FTC's request for a lump sum payment of $26.5 million to parents. \nInstead, Amazon refunds will start trickling down in 2017 and the federal court explicitly orders the e-commerce company to pay back in cash and not via gift cards. The judge ruled that Amazon would only profit from gift card Amazon refunds yet some terms to its notice process were approved. According to the Consumerist , eligible Amazon subscribers or parents should expect to get notifications about the Amazon refunds via their accounts within the next 90 days. Amazon has to actually refund parents whose kids racked up in-app purchases, not give them Amazon gift cards. https://t.co/EEwqKnnaJB — consumerist (@consumerist) November 12, 2016 \nSince the lawsuit, Amazon has already improved its in-app services for Kindle Fire, especially from unauthorized purchases. \"We look forward to making a case for full refunds to consumers as a result of Amazon's actions,\" FTC's head Edith Ramirez said, according to Engadget . \nAre you one of the parents eligible for getting an Amazon refund?

      "text": "Comments \nThe American Heart Association (AHA) announced a strategic collaboration with Amazon Web Services: the launch of a cloud-based data marketplace for researchers and clinicians. \nThe idea to target products for a vertical market is not new. What’s new is our ability to put meaningful data on public clouds that doctors and researchers can use to better understand the patterns of some disease. This is a great leap forward, considering that heart disease is the No. 1 killer in this country. [ Download the public cloud megaguide PDF: Amazon, Microsoft, Google, IBM, and Joyent compared . | Stay up on the cloud with InfoWorld's Cloud Computing Report newsletter . ] \nWhen released, the AHA Precision Medicine Platform will include a vast array of curated data sets that are centrally stored, searchable, and managed on Amazon's cloud. This will enable researchers and clinicians to aggregate and analyze the data, including longitudinal cohorts, proteomic, genomic, and gene expression data. For us laymen, this means they will use a precision medicine approach to uncover critical cardiovascular disease insights that translate into medical innovations. In other words, researchers and clinicians will gain the knowledge of thousands of cases, including diagnosis, treatment, and outcome. \nThis might not be a moneymaker at first. AWS will provide free access to computational cloud storage and analysis as part of the AHA data portfolio to some organizations -- likely a handful that are given a grant. \nWhat’s different here is that AWS will provide not only storage but the data itself. This positions AWS and other public cloud vendors as data-as-a-service providers. They can furnish the data points you need, as well as the processing and storage power. \nThe upside for users is that they don’t have to find, load, then do complex analysis on data. It’s there, ready for the exploration. The upside for AWS is that many researchers and clinicians are apt to become AWS customers or, more likely, expand their use of AWS. \nI suspect that this data service aspect will become a bigger trend within the larger public cloud providers. Think of all the opportunities if you can own both the data and the platform. That’s what's at stake here. RELATED TOPICS",

      "title": "Tech Giants Send Trump a Roadmap on Copyright, Encryption, Net Neutrality",
      "text": "David McNew/Getty Images \nA trade group that represents Facebook, Google and Amazon sent a letter to President-elect Donald Trump on Monday that included a roadmap of key policy priorities covering topics like immigration and net neutrality, as well as copyright and patent reform. The Internet Association, whose members also include Netflix and Uber and other tech companies, congratulated Trump on his victory and said the industry “looks forward to engaging in an open and productive dialogue” about key issues. \n“From standardizing data security and breach notification, to protecting encryption standards across digital technologies, leaders in public office must recognize the importance of the internet as a place where people can share their information and ideas and start and grow their businesses from anywhere in the United States,” the letter reads. \nBelow are some of association’s key issues: \nOpen Internet: “At its core, net neutrality is a principle that underpins a free and open internet. It ensures equal access to content by prohibiting paid prioritization, throttling, and blocking. The internet must be a place where companies can compete on a level playing field. Additionally, with more people accessing the internet through their mobile devices, any net neutrality rules must apply equally to mobile broadband. There is only one internet, and rules must be consistent no matter how consumers connect.” \nProtect encryption : \"Strong encryption is critical to national and individual security. Encryption is key to national defense, and it also protects our nation’s financial system and critical infrastructure. It also protects users from repressive governments looking to stifle speech and democracy, and it shields users from nefarious actors seeking to steal their sensitive data. Laws that require companies to engineer vulnerabilities into products and services harm personal privacy and endanger national security. Support for strong encryption makes America more secure.\" \nPatent reform: “Access to a cheap supply of vague, overly broad, low-quality patents in our system provides trolls the ammunition they need to engage in abusive litigation against unknowing businesses by asserting these unclear patents. There is no single action that would eliminate low-quality patents and the harm they bring to our innovation economy. Instead, a dynamic and multifaceted approach to reform all sectors of the patent system is necessary to maintain U.S. global competitiveness and economic growth.” \nCopyright reform: “Copyright policies must prioritize the public interest by protecting innovation and freedom of expression online, encouraging new forms of follow-on creative works, and ensuring users have access to legal content. Threats to the flexible framework, such as weakening limitations or exceptions to safe harbors, would create barriers to entry for internet startups and creators, which would deny users the ability to access content online.” \nOn the issue of weakening intermediary liability laws, the group also called on Trump to support copyright safe harbors, which they say “provide flexibility that creates a future-proof framework in which private parties are incentivized to efficiently comply with the law and work collaboratively on private sector efforts tailored to the unique needs of platforms and creators.” \nRead the full letter here .",

      "title": "Samsung SSD 960 EVO NVMe M.2 Review: Ultra Fast, Affordable Storage",
      "text": "Find The Samsung SSD 960 EVO @ Amazon Starting At $129 The Samsung SSD 960 EVO NVMe M.2 series drives will initially be offered in three capacities: 250GB, 500GB, and a 1TB. We’ve got a 500GB drive to show you here. All of the drives in the line-up have the same M.2 (2280) ‘gumstick’ form factor and offer peak read bandwidth of 3.2GB/s, with 1.5GB/s - 1.9GB/s writes, with various IOPS and endurance ratings.The Samsung SSD 960 EVO family features 3rd Generation, 3-bit MLC V-NAND Flash memory (128Gb on the 250GB drive, and 256Gb on the 500GB and 1TB drives) and a the same Polaris controller used on the 960 PRO, which has a native PCIe gen 3 interface and supports the NVMe 1.2 protocol. Arriving alongside the drive is a new revision of Samsung's NVMe driver (v2.0), which we used for all of our testing, though a version of Samsung's SSD Magician utility that supports the 960 EVO was as of yet unavailable. We're told it's coming though. Depending on the capacity, the drives also feature 512MB or 1GB of LPDDR3 DRAM cache, and the cache actually resides on the same package as the controller (to save space on the PCB). Other than its interface, details are scarce on the Samsung Polaris controller. However, in concert with the drive's firmware, it performs all of the functions you’d expect a modern SSD to do, like TRIM , garbage collection, S.M.A.R.T., etc., and it supports various encryption technologies too. Internally, the Polaris controller is packing 5 processor cores (versus 3 on the UBX controller from the 950 Pro series), with one of these cores dedicated to optimizing communications between the host CPU and SSD controller. Like previous generation EVO-series drives, the Samsung SSD 960 EVO supports Samsung's TurboWrite technology, though it has gotten more intelligent. TurboWrite essentially uses a small portion of the NAND as an SLC write buffer, which translates into improved write performance, as long as the buffer isn’t exhausted. The TurboWrite buffer size now dynamically adjusts based on the workload. Samsung is calling it Intelligent TurboWrite, and it works by identifying user workloads and tweaking the size of the SLC buffer accordingly. With the 500GB model, for example, if the user's dataset is under 4GB, intelligent TurboWrites uses the pre-allocated (default) TurboWrite region. If it is more than 4GB, however, the 960 EVO can use an additional 18GB dynamic SLC buffer for a total of 22GB SLC buffer on the 500GB drive. The default and dynamic sizes of the buffer are defined in the chart above. TurboWrite should allow the SSD 960 EVO series to perform very well in the vast majority of consumer-class workloads. As you can see in the screen-capture above (taken from HD Tune using a 500GB drive), writes are much faster when the TurboWrite buffer is being utilized, but once that 22GB mark is hit, writes taper off. Samsung warranties the SSD 960 EVO drives for 3 years and they have relatively high endurance ratings as well, considering the cost of the drives (up to 400TBW). Endurance specifications are significantly reduced in comparison to the 960 PRO, however. The drives also have built-in thermal protection, which is to say they’ll throttle to protect the NAND and controller if temperatures get too high, but this too has been improved over the previous generation. The Samsung SSD 960 EVO features a new heat-spreader design(in the label) that can dissipate heat more efficiently during heavy workloads. According to Samsung, the thermal trigger point is delayed by up to 16 seconds relative to the 950 PRO, which translates into roughly 60% more data that can be transferred before throttling.",

      "text": "The Insider Picks team writes about stuff we think you'll like. Business Insider has affiliate partnerships so we may get a share of the revenue from your purchase.\n\"The Grand Tour\" Amazon\nThe moment we've all been waiting for has finally come: \"The Grand Tour\" premieres this Friday, November 18.\nFor the first time since the trio left \"Top Gear,\" Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond, and James May will once more grace our screens with their witty banter, cheeky comments, and strange experiments ( like taking a Mercedes to a water park ).\nThe show is an Amazon Prime Video exclusive, which is undoubtedly great news for Prime members .\nIf you're not a Prime user yet, however, Amazon UK is dropping the price of a membership to from £79 a year to just £59 this week .\nWe've talked about the advantages of Prime before, but we will reiterate them for those who aren't familiar with the service. For a small yearly fee, Prime members can take advantage of free one-day delivery, unlimited photo storage, stream their favourite movies, shows, or music, read thousands of e-books, as well as enjoy early access to Amazon's lightning deals. If you haven't tried it already, you can also take advantage of a 30-day free trial .\nAmazon's Black Friday sales are also just around the corner, so signing up for a Prime membership now will definitely come in handy.\nWhether you need to do some Christmas shopping, want to binge-watch the newest TV shows, or listen to unlimited music, Prime is the one subscription service you should invest in. The offer only lasts until the launch of \"The Grand Tour\" on November 18, so anyone wanting to save on the yearly subscription fee should move fast.\nGet a year of Amazon Prime for £59 (instead of £79) now. Or try Prime for 30 days completely free of charge .\nDisclosure: Jeff Bezos is an investor in Business Insider through his personal investment company Bezos Expeditions.\nRead the original article on Insider Picks .

Industrial powerhouse General Electric is now aiming to be included on that short list. It may not have a chipper digital assistant like Cortana or Alexa. It won&apos;t sort through selfies, but it will look through X-rays. It won&apos;t recommend movies, but it will suggest how to care for a diesel locomotive. Today, GE announced a pair of acquisitions and new services that will bring machine learning AI to the kinds of products it&apos;s known for, including planes, trains, X-ray machines, and power plants.\nThe effort started in 2015 when GE announced Predix Cloud —an online platform to network and collect data from sensors on industrial machinery such as gas turbines or windmills. At the time, GE touted the benefits of using machine learning to find patterns in sensor data that could lead to energy savings or preventative maintenance before a breakdown. Predix Cloud opened up to customers in February, but GE is still building up the AI capabilities to fulfill the promise. \"We were using machine learning, but I would call it in a custom way,\" says Bill Ruh, GE&apos;s chief digital officer and CEO of its GE Digital business (GE calls its division heads CEOs). \"And we hadn&apos;t gotten to a general-purpose framework in machine learning.\" \nToday GE revealed the purchase of two AI companies that Ruh says will get them there. Bit Stew Systems , founded in 2005, was already doing much of what Predix Cloud promises—collecting and analyzing sensor data from power utilities, oil and gas companies, aviation, and factories. (GE Ventures has funded the company.) Customers include BC Hydro, Pacific Gas & Electric, and Scottish & Southern Energy.\nThe second purchase, Wise.io is a less obvious purchase. Founded by astrophysics and AI experts using machine learning to study the heavens, the company reapplied the tech to streamlining a company&apos;s customer support systems, picking up clients like Pinterest, Twilio, and TaskRabbit. GE believes the technology will transfer yet again, to managing industrial machines. \"I think by the middle of next year we will have a full machine learning stack,\" says Ruh.\nGE Wants to Give Industrial Machines Their Own Social Network With Predix Cloud GE is selling a new service that promises to predict when a machine will break down...so technicians can preemptively fix it. GE also just bought ServiceMax , maker of software for dispatching field service agents, for a cool $915 million. \"It&apos;s a unicorn, essentially,\" he says.\nThough young, Predix is growing fast, with 270 partner companies using the platform, according to GE, which expects revenue on software and services to grow over 25% this year, to more than $7 billion. Ruh calls Predix a \"significant part\" of that extra money. And he&apos;s ready to brag, taking a jab at IBM Watson for being a \"general-purpose\" machine-learning provider without the deep knowledge of the industries it serves. \"We have domain algorithms, on machine learning, that&apos;ll know what a power plant is and all the depth of that, that a general-purpose machine learning will never really understand,\" he says.\nGE Healthcare lobbed a shot across IBM&apos;s bow in announcing a deal with UCSF to develop AI-driven apps for the care of various diseases. (See my colleague Chrissy Farr&apos;s full coverage [[TK-Link here]] .) Health is the first industry IBM Watson targeted (starting with years of studying cancer data), and UCSF is a nice prize.\nNot synonymous with health is another new GE customer, McDonald’s, which is using a Predix service called Current to lower energy costs on items like heating and lighting. Most of GE&apos;s new offerings are in the energy realm, such as Digital Substation, which promises to use monitoring and AI to reduce downtime for power companies.\nOne especially dull-sounding new Predix service—Predictive Corrosion Management—touches on a very hot political issue: giant oil and gas pipeline projects. Over 400 people have been arrested in months of protests against the Dakota Access Pipeline , which would carry crude oil from North Dakota to Illinois. The issue is very complicated, but one concern of protestors is that a pipeline rupture would contaminate drinking water for the Standing Rock Sioux reservation.\n\"I think absolutely this is aimed at that problem. If you look at why pipelines spill, it&apos;s corrosion,\" says Ruh. \"We believe that 10 years from now, we can detect a leak before it occurs and fix it before you see it happen.\" Given how political battles over pipelines drag on, 10 years might not be so long to wait.",

The promotion, which gives access to Amazon’s Prime music, Prime delivery and Prime video services for just £4.92 per-month, is available to new Amazon Prime members only.\nThe list of benefits for Prime members includes:\nUnlimited, free one-day delivery on millions of eligible items Amazon Prime Video – unlimited streaming of thousand of TV shows and movies Amazon Prime Music – unlimited, ad-free streaming of 2 million tracks (not to be confused with Amazon’s new Music Unlimited service , which requires a separate subscription) Amazon Prime Photos – secure, unlimited cloud photo storage Kindle Owner’s Lending Library – more than 1 million books you can borrow only on Amazon hardware such as a Kindle or Fire tablet Early access to lightning deals on Amazon.co.uk Of course, Amazon will hope that consumers keep the subscription after the 12-month period, when the price will automatically revert to £79. By this point, customers may have become so accustomed to the service that they might not be able to peel themselves away.\nThat said, you can cancel the subscription at any time if you only want to cash-in on this for the first year. It basically works out at three free months.\nFind the deal over at Amazon.co.uk and let us know in the comments if you think it’s worth the money.",

      "text": "Amazon Switching From Wrapping Paper To Reusable Bags November 15, 2016, 10:54:00 AM EDT By RTT News Shutterstock photo \n(RTTNews.com) - As the holiday season is fast approaching, Amazon is planning to minimize package paper and to use eco-friendly reusable bags to packs gift. This will be implemented in the U.S., Mexico and Canada soon. \nThe e-commerce giant has realized that velvet bags can be re-used several times and it costs less than the traditional wrapping paper. Moreover, it takes much less time to pack in bags, than paper. \nThe bags will come in five different sizes and will cost $3.49 to $5.99. \nKara Hurst, director of sustainability and social responsibility at Amazon is spear heading the move to more eco-friendly approaches. Amazon has been using recyclable cardboard that can be opened by hand. \nFor comments and feedback: contact CLOSE X Edit Favorites \nEnter up to 25 symbols separated by commas or spaces in the text box below.

Amazon Prepares To Launch 'The Grand Tour' With Crashed Cars In London And Berlin Jeremy Clarkson Richard Hammond James May \nAmazon are also offering Prime subscriptions at a reduced rate until Friday. \nJeremy Clarkson , Richard Hammond and James May ’s long-awaited new show ‘The Grand Tour’ finally hits Amazon Prime this Friday. \nTo promote the show’s launch, the streaming service are continuing the trio’s tradition of pulling stunts, by leaving ‘crashed’ cars in London and Berlin. The only real acceptable use for a Prius. #TheGrandTour pic.twitter.com/ElazbLjivB — The Grand Tour (@thegrandtour) November 15, 2016 \nIn London commuters in King's Cross on Tuesday morning were surprised to see a “crashed” Toyota Prius abandoned against a red post box. \nThe destroyed car bore the personalised numberplate M4Y. \nThen in Berlin’s Hackescher Market another damaged Prius, this time with the numberplate H4MMOND, was left sticking out of the ground. \nFans are yet to find where Jeremy Clarkson has crashed his motor. \nAmazon have also been trying to entice fans to sign up for Prime by offering the service for just £59 (instead of the normal £79) until Friday. \nSpeaking about the new series to The Telegraph earlier this week, Richard Hammond said: “It’s like coming out of the Army, coming out of the BBC after all those years.\" \nMore: Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond And James May Appear On James Corden's Show \n\"We're not going to disappoint, because we can’t,” he added. “We've got to make this good or they will come and torch us - and rightly so.” \n‘The Grand Tour’ launches on Amazon this Friday, November 18. Unlike other Amazon series, only one episode of the show will be released per week, with episodes becoming availible simultaneously in the United States and United Kingdom. Contactmusic",

      "text": "The Grand Tour producer will judge show's performance using Twitter as Amazon won't disclose viewing figures By John McCarthy - 15 November 2016 15:43pm The Grand Tour being shot in Johannesberg \nThe production team behind Amazon ’s The Grand Tour has admitted they will not be informed of how well the show is performing after its launch. \nAs Amazon Video looks to grow its global audience by pushing Prime subscriptions, the company’s been especially protective of its viewing figures, apparently this mentally even extends to the producers of its shows. \nSpeaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme , The Grand Tour producer Andy Wilman said: “We'll never know the number, because, even to us, Amazon won't tell us what the viewing figures are.\" \nWhen asked on how they will rate the show’s popularity, Wilman added: “We'll get it from Twitter I would imagine.\" \nWith its disruptive viewing model, Amazon will release the whole season at once, meaning overnight viewing figures (which the Chris Evan’s Top Gear was often so critically rated on) matter not a jot to the company. \nAdditionally, the existence of its Prime subscription fee means Amazon doesn’t particularly need the show to be an instant hit, and has the benefit of accumulating views longterm – although with a reported budget ranging from £1m - £4m an episode, the company will hope its new franchise performs well. \nWilman concluded: “Over time hopefully millions will watch it, but we've said goodbye to that big figure coming in on a Monday morning.”",

      "text": "Amazon Announces the Best Books of the Year, 2016 Posted on 15 November, 2016 by Nate Hoffelder in Amazon // 0 Comments \nAhead of tomorrow night's National Book Awards , Amazon's editorial teams has announced its picks for the best books of the year. \nThe list features the Top 100 books of the year plus Top twenty lists across various categories and genres. \nThis year's list is headed by Colson Whitehead's The Underground Railroad , a book which is on many reviewers lists for best novel. \n“The editorial team had a handful of books that we seriously considered for the top pick but in the end our choice of The Underground Railroad was unanimous,” said Chris Schluep, Amazon Senior Book Editor. “Colson Whitehead’s novel is timely, important, and a great work of literature.” \nHere's the top ten. How many have you read? The Underground Railroad by Colson Whitehead : A brilliant, wise, fantastical yet grounded portrayal of a young slave seeking her freedom on a real underground railroad. The Wolf Road by Beth Lewis : Part literary thriller, part western, this is a debut novel about a young tomboy trying to survive a post-apocalyptic wilderness as she searches for her parents. Hillbilly Elegy by J.D. Vance : A very personal tour of a segment of our culture that’s losing its way in modern America. The Nix by Nathan Hill : A big, smart novel about so many things: family, politics, revolution and the things we choose to remember (and forget). Mischling by Affinity Konar : Affinity Konar’s beautiful novel about twin sisters who survive Auschwitz is precisely crafted, acutely sensitive and ultimately uplifting and hopeful. Lab Girl by Hope Jahren : An inspiring and entertaining memoir about work, life and love from a plant scientist who is just as adept at analyzing the natural world as she is at illuminating human relationships. Another Brooklyn by Jacqueline Woodson : A poetic, breathtaking novel about growing up female and black in the 1970s—a time of conflicting pressures and sometimes crushing assumptions. Pumpkinflowers by Matti Friedman : An unforgettable nonfiction account of men changed by war, told in a voice that is both straight forward and undeniably literary. Before the Fall by Noah Hawley : From the award-winning creator of Fargo, athrilling page-turner about an airplane crash and its seemingly heroic survivors. Swing Time by Zadie Smith : A masterful novel that tackles big issues—race, class and the ups and downs of long term friendship—told with a dancer’s grace and ease.",

      "text": "It’s been seven months since a judge said that Amazon is liable for kids’ “accidental” in-app purchases . And just recently, the federal judge said that the top e-commerce site should start setting up a year-long plan to give back parents the money and reimburse them for those accidental purchases. A lump-sum payout worth over $26.5 million was suggested at first by a US regulator but was rejected. The result now is reimbursement which is actually slow but sure.\nAmazon is liable and John Coughenour, a U.S. District Judge in Seattle issued an order to pay the parents of kids who purchased apps without their knowledge. Collectively, those “accidents” racked up to about $86 million of charges that as we can describe now as unauthorized.\nThe case has been open since July 2014 when FTC accused Amazon of making it easy for everyone, the kids especially, to purchase apps and run bills. This order now calls parents to receive reimbursement this coming 2017. Parents are eligible to receive funds and they are guaranteed to receive them.\nAmazon’s first request to have the refunds be issued as gift cards was refused and the judge said they will only “undoubtedly recapture some of the profits that are at issue.” This is not the first problem with in-app purchases we’ve heard. Google and Apple both faced similar issues when the FTC filed cases against them back in 2014.\nVIA: Reuters\nStory Timeline Google facing class action lawsuit for in-app purchases FTC files lawsuit against Amazon for easy in-app purchases FTC orders Google to refund unauthorized in-app purchases Judge says Amazon is liable for kids’ “accidental” in-app purchases",

      "text": "Julie Johnson \nThe Grand Tour is set to premiere on Amazon’s video streaming service, Amazon Prime Video, on November 18, and Amazon is giving some customers an opportunity to sign up for Amazon Prime at a discounted rate, just in time to catch the premiere episode, starring James May, 53, Richard Hammond, 46, and Jeremy Clarkson, 56, that was recorded in Los Angeles, California. \nJeff Bezos, Amazon’s founder and CEO, calls The Grand Tour , a new motoring show presented by the three former BBC Top Gear hosts, “very, very, very expensive,” as reported by the Telegraph back in December 2015. Bezos explained that he “goes weak at the knees when he meets another entrepreneur,” and that the popular trio, who have hosted together since 2003, are “worth a lot, and they know it.” \nAccording to Bezos, he was “very excited” to add The Grand Tour to the growing list of original programs distributed on Amazon through its instant video streaming service. But maybe not quite as excited as fans who were disheartened to see May, Hammond, and Clarkson all depart from BBC, after Jeremy Clarkson’s contract was not renewed in 2015, following a verbal and physical altercation with Top Gear producer, Oisin Tymon. \nAmazon was, of course, banking on the chemistry between the three friends to bring in new Amazon Prime subscribers for The Grand Tour Prime-exclusive deal that was announced at the end of July 2015, only four months after Clarkson was fired from Top Gear . At that time, The Grand Tour didn’t even have a name, but May, Hammond, and Clarkson were just happy to have a job again. I've got a job I've got a job I've got a job.Haircut, clean jeans and practice driving again. Forrrrw rd!! \n— Richard Hammond (@RichardHammond) July 30, 2015 \nFans were ecstatic to hear that May, Hammond, and Clarkson would be back together again on the small screen, hosting yet another automotive series, but were disappointed to learn that The Grand Tour would not be on Netflix. While Amazon has more subscribers in the U.S. than Netflix, Netflix was ahead of Amazon in the U.K., as recently as March of this year, as reported by the Guardian . Netflix had at least 5 million U.K. subscribers, while Amazon Prime Video didn’t even have 2 million U.K. subscribers, not even a year ago. \nBut Amazon is hoping to increase that number of U.K. streaming video subscribers by offering a discount on a yearly membership of Amazon Prime, with £20 off, but only until November 18, which coincides with the release date of The Grand Tour . Digital Spy reported on Tuesday that “huge fans” of James May, Jeremy Clarkson, and Richard Hammond, who may not be “huge fans” of Amazon Prime, might want to take advantage of the new discounted annual membership of £59, in order to catch at least the first 12-part series of The Grand Tour . #Android Amazon Prime UK price drops to £59 this week – Grand Tour tie-in gives new subscribers a £20 discount … https://t.co/fApU6k6Fnu \n— Mobile App Music (@MobileAppMusic) November 15, 2016 \nSo far, only 36 episodes of The Grand Tour are scheduled to be released, both in the U.S. and the U.K., over a three-year period on Amazon Prime Video, with one new episode airing weekly. According to Digital Spy , the discounted Amazon Prime membership for U.K. subscribers isn’t the only incentive to tune in to watch The Grand Tour , that was shot in ultra HD — Jeremy Clarkson has also reportedly promised not to swear, “even though he could if he wanted to.” \nSeveral new teasers for The Grand Tour launch have been released on the Amazon Video YouTube channel, including the newest sneak peak , titled The Grand Tour: Close Shave , where Richard Hammond has a close call with a speeding sports car, saying it missed him “by that much.” The Grand Tour producer, Andy Wilman, says that Amazon will not disclose viewing figures, so popularity will have to be gauged via social media, specifically from Twitter, “I would imagine,” where @thegrandtour has nearly 300,000 followers. \n— BBC News (World) (@BBCWorld) November 15, 2016 \nTop Gear ratings have suffered since its relaunch with Series 23 back in March, without Hammond, Clarkson, and May, with the last episode of Series 23 having not even 3 million viewers. In a new interview published on the Daily Mail , ahead of Friday’s The Grand Tour launch, Richard Hammond says that “he’s confident” Top Gear fans will enjoy The Grand Tour . Hammond went on to joke that if The Grand Tour isn’t good, the trio fears being “torched” by the public. \n“We’re not going to disappoint, because we can’t. We’ve got to make this good or they will come and torch us – and rightly so.” <noscript><iframe width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/E80MNut4PX4?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></noscript> \n[Featured Image by @c130gunner/ Twitter ]",

      "text": "This morning's press release about Amazon adding Bartell Drugs to its Prime Now service reminded of another partnership between the two retailers.\nIn October 2015 Amazon started testing the sale of Kindle ebook gift card in Bartell Drug Stores in the Seattle area . That pilot let consumers walk into a drug store and buy a gift card for a specific Kindle title. The buyer could then log into their Amazon account, type in a code, and add the ebook to their account.\nThat pilot covered 61 Bartell Drug stores which carried a hanging display with cards for 20 Kindle titles and 4 Kindle Unlimited card designs. It was launched so quietly that it took four months before anyone noticed, and now Amazon ended its Kindle gift card pilot program just as quietly as it began.\nAccording to my source at Bartell, the pilot ended in June.\nTo the best of my knowledge, the pilot isn't being rerun elsewhere, and since the relevant page on Amazon.com now only mentions KU gift cards this aspect of Amazon's brick-and-mortar retail efforts has either ended or, at best, on hiatus.\nGiven that ebook gift cards have succeeded elsewhere, this is more likely a hiatus than an end.\nGift cards have been used to sell digital textbooks , Christian books (Zondervan), and novels (in US Target stores , using card developed by Livrada).\nAside from a quietly successful platform in Germany and an ebook gift card startup in Canada, the idea has not had much success.\nBut that Canadian company, Enthrill, has gotten its cards into 3,000 stores in Canada, including Sears, Toys R Us, Safeway, Home Outfitters, Home Hardware, and Longos. Enthrill also supplies the Walmart-brand ebook gift cards in Canada and runs Walmart's ebookstore . That program launched in November 2014.\nGiven Enthrill's success in Canada, there's no obvious reason why ebook gift card can't work in the US market. And yet, in the past year there have been several pilots but no national launch. Livrada had cards in Target stores for a while in 2012 and 2013, but that ended.\neBook gift card have their downside; you can buy one on impulse but you can't start reading right away. That would limit the appeal to readers, but this wouldn't have any impact on buying a card as a gift.\nOne would think that drug stores and gift shops like Hallmark stores would want a rack of ebook gift cards. But we still don't have them in the US.\nHow soon do you think that will change?\nYou just finished reading Amazon Ends Pilot Test of Title-Specific Kindle Gift Cards which was published on The Digital Reader . If you liked what you read, how about joining the discussion? ",

      "text": "2 Carnegie Mellon teams chosen to compete in Amazon's socialbot competition   12:09 p.m.   17 minutes ago Two teams from Carnegie Mellon University will be among the 12 selected to compete in Amazon's inaugural Alexa Prize Competition. The teams will compete to build socialbots, computer programs that can simulate human behavior, for Amazon's digital personal assistant, Alexa. The programs will have to converse “coherently and engagingly” for about 20 minutes with people about popular topics and news, according to an announcement from Amazon about the competition. More than 100 teams from 22 countries applied to compete. “We are eager to see what students from the 12 sponsored teams around the world — including one team of undergrads — create with Alexa,” Rohit Prasad, vice president and head scientist of Amazon's Alexa program, said in a statement. The winning team will receive $500,000 and its school will receive $1 million. Teams also get $100,00 for participating and access to Alexa devices and other Amazon support. The competing teams are: • Carnegie-Mellon University—Pittsburgh, PA, USA; Team Name: CMU Magnus • Carnegie-Mellon University—Pittsburgh, PA, USA; Team Name: TBD • Czech Technical University in Prague—Prague, Czech Republic; Team Name: eClub • Heriot-Watt University—Edinburgh, Scotland, UK; Team Name: WattSocialBot • Princeton University—Princeton, NJ, USA; Team Name: Princeton Alexa • Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute—Troy, NY, USA; Team Name: BAKAbot • University of California, Berkeley—Berkeley, CA, USA; Team Name: Machine Learning @ Berkeley • University of California, Santa Cruz—Santa Cruz, CA, USA; Team Name: SlugBots • University of Edinburgh—Edinburgh, Scotland, UK; Team Name: Edina • University of Montreal—Montreal, Quebec, Canada; Team Name: MILA Team • University of Trento—Trento, Italy; Team Name: Roving Minds • University of Washington—Seattle, WA, USA; Team Name: HuskyBot More Allegheny Show commenting policy TribLive commenting policy \nYou are solely responsible for your comments and by using TribLive.com you agree to our Terms of Service . \nWe moderate comments. Our goal is to provide substantive commentary for a general readership. By screening submissions, we provide a space where readers can share intelligent and informed commentary that enhances the quality of our news and information. \nWhile most comments will be posted if they are on-topic and not abusive, moderating decisions are subjective. We will make them as carefully and consistently as we can. Because of the volume of reader comments, we cannot review individual moderation decisions with readers. \nWe value thoughtful comments representing a range of views that make their point quickly and politely. We make an effort to protect discussions from repeated comments â either by the same reader or different readers. \nWe follow the same standards for taste as the daily newspaper. A few things we won't tolerate: personal attacks, obscenity, vulgarity, profanity (including expletives and letters followed by dashes), commercial promotion, impersonations, incoherence, proselytizing and SHOUTING. Don't include URLs to Web sites. \nWe do not edit comments. They are either approved or deleted. We reserve the right to edit a comment that is quoted or excerpted in an article. In this case, we may fix spelling and punctuation. \nWe welcome strong opinions and criticism of our work, but we don't want comments to become bogged down with discussions of our policies and we will moderate accordingly. \nWe appreciate it when readers and people quoted in articles or blog posts point out errors of fact or emphasis and will investigate all assertions. But these suggestions should be sent via e-mail. To avoid distracting other readers, we won't publish comments that suggest a correction. Instead, corrections will be made in a blog post or in an article. Trending",

      "text": "Nick Kolakowski has written for The Washington Post, Slashdot, eWeek, McSweeney's, Thrillist, WebMD, Trader Monthly, and other venues. He's also the author of \"How to Become an Intellectual,\" a work of comedic nonfiction. nick.kolakowski@dice.com nkolakowski \nAmazon is adjusting how it judges employee performance. \nStarting next year, the company’s annual review process may abandon or change the controversial stack-ranking system, which requires managers to order employees on a scale from top to poor. Those employees who fall into the lower echelons often find their jobs at risk. (In a much-circulated New York Times article from 2015, an anonymous hiring manager referred to Amazon’s aggressive employee practices as “purposeful Darwinism.”) \nIn a note to GeekWire, which first broke the news about Amazon’s review shift, an Amazon spokesperson said that the new review process would focus “on our employees’ strengths, not the absence of weaknesses.” \nAmazon isn’t the first tech company to roll back or modify stack ranking. In late 2013, for example, Microsoft announced that it would end the practice, which had reportedly sparked a good deal of backstabbing and conspiring within the company, as employees did anything necessary to stay near the top of the ranking pile. \nAside from that statement to GeekWire, Amazon has offered no public details on how exactly it will alter its employee reviews, although anonymous employees told the publication that stack-ranking would undergo changes. When Microsoft (which is Amazon’s Seattle-area neighbor) finally stopped stack-ranking, a few executives told me that the company had made some failed attempts to “soften” the practice over the years. With that in mind, if Amazon only takes half-measures in reforming its own ranking, it may not halt the internal issues that led it to take up any changes in the first place. \nAt least on paper, the upsides of stack ranking are clear: the top performers are elevated and rewarded, while poorer employees are aggressively filtered out. In reality, though, the need to put somebody at the bottom of the stack means that some strong employees are inevitably rated lower than their performance would suggest. Confronted with that sort of environment, workers are less inclined to collaborate with equally innovative or hard-charging colleagues, and more likely to gravitate toward weaker teams where they will stand out—potentially slamming the brakes on innovation. Strong employees may also become demoralized and leave. \nWith tech-industry employment hovering around 2.8 percent last quarter—considerably below the overall U.S. labor market’s 4.9 percent unemployment—tech companies are in a pitched battle for the best talent. Evolved review practices are a good way to convince that talent that a particular company is an excellent place to work. Related Articles",

      "text": "After launching a $2.5 million initiative for university teams to further develop AI-driven conversational bots last month, Amazon just selected the teams it plans to sponsor for the challenge.\nAmazon received applications from more than 100 teams at universities across 22 countries. \nAs a result, Amazon selected 12 teams instead of 10 to receive a $100,000 stipend to develop their AI bots. Most of the teams selected are in the U.S. with others from Canada, the U.K., Italy, and Czech Republic. \nThe Alexa Prize, which launched last month , is a competition for university teams to develop ‘socialbots’ on Amazon’s Alexa AI platform that can hold a natural conversation with humans. Amazon initially planned to sponsor 10 teams to explore and further develop different areas of conversational artificial intelligence, such as natural language processing and common sense reasoning. \nThroughout the course of the next year, the 12 teams will develop their bots and the winning team will win $500,000. Additionally, if the winning team’s bot can ‘converse coherently and engagingly with humans on popular topics for 20 minutes,’ Amazon plans to award a $1 million research grant to that team’s university. \n“For the Socialbot Challenge, the goal is to build an Alexa skill that will converse with people about trending societal topics and events in a turn-by-turn format,” an Amazon spokesperson told the IoT Daily. \n“In order for machines to be truly intelligent, they must be able to participate in conversation, demonstrating an understanding of the world and cultural moments.” \nAmazon appears to not have a focus on any potential marketing and advertising implications of conversational AI bots. \n“The use cases for socialbots are not for marketing or advertising; instead, the goal is to make Alexa even more engaging and enable students to advance their research in this area,” Amazon told the Daily. \nHowever, some brands have already been using such bots for marketing and advertising purposes. \nFor example, agency executives discussed using chatbots to engage with consumers on behalf of brands at the MediaPost OMMA Bots and Chat conference during Advertising Week. \nIn that panel discussion, Natalie Monbiot, senior vice president and managing partner of strategic innovation at UM, said her team created a chatbot last year for a client as part of a broader campaign. \nThe chatbot was designed to engage with consumers as one of the characters of a new movie and received high engagement rates. On average, consumers engaged with the chatbot for 10 minutes, but some conversations were as long as two and a half hours, according to Monbiot. \nHere are the university teams selected for the Alexa Prize challenge: \nCarnegie-Mellon University (two teams) \nPrinceton University \nRensselaer Polytechnic Institute \nUniversity of California, Berkeley \nUniversity of California, Santa Cruz \nUniversity of Washington \nUniversity of Montreal \nUniversity of Edinburgh \nHeriot-Watt University \nUniversity of Trento \nCzech Technical University, Prague",

      "text": "By Derrick Miyao \nHappy Tuesday! \nAre you excited to see family and friends next week for Thanksgiving? If you are the cook and want to try something new, I highly recommend spatchcocking your turkey. You can have an evenly cooked, golden brown turkey (without basting or frying) in about 90 minutes. I didn’t believe until I tried it, but everytime I cook one I become the hero of Thanksgiving. Check out this article on how to spatchcock a Turkey . Practice on a whole chicken this weekend if you want to try it first. \n\nDeals are picking up before Black Friday and Cyber Monday. I’ve mentioned before that some of the best sales will be happening this week. They’ll be one offs that will go quick as retailers try to clear inventory before next year. Retailers take advantage of the massive hype around the two major sales days and quietly raise prices on products in combination with deep discounted gadgets. It is this week when you will quietly see fantastic deals. \nHave slow or dead spots of Wi-Fi in your home? When you switch rooms, do you notice lag or buffering on your streaming music? Or do you have children who you are trying to protect from the crazy sites on the internet? Or limited their internet usage altogether? \nToday’s sale is better than what you will get on Black Friday for next generation routers. \nThe Starry Station is a huge upgrade in current router technology. It takes less than five minutes to set up and will give you deeper security, while also giving you the ability to create parental controls for specific devices in your home. It also has a very strong signal for reaching to the far corners of your home. At $224, it still might seem pricey but consider it an investment in the internet service you already pay for. It’s also at a historic low price. \nNext up is the single pack of the Luma Home Wi-Fi system. Remember Google’s announcement of its own next generation Wi-Fi system that it has yet to release? Luma’s system does the same thing and at $99 it is $30 cheaper than Google’s unreleased product. You can buy multiple Lumas to spread throughout your home to create a mesh network. Repeaters are a hassle and just don’t work as well. You won’t find a cheaper price on the Luma all year. \nIf you have large homes, or homes with thick walls, these systems are designed just for you. They work. I’ve been testing a wide range of these products and will have full reviews in the upcoming weeks. \nYou all have a wonderful day.

It’s an odorless substance that slowly deprives you of oxygen and can make you violently sick or even kill you. Incidents of carbon monoxide poisoning sky rocket as the temperature drops. People turn on their heaters which haven’t been used all summer, and that’s when exhaust or malfunctions occur that increase the levels of CO. The Nest Protect rarely goes on sale, just like all Nest products, so at a $6 savings, this deal is better than nothing. I wanted to list this deal because CO poisoning happens a lot more frequently than it should and a simple investment can protect you and your loved ones. The smaller the body the faster they are to poisoning.

Echo Dot – Buy 3 and save $20 at Amazon , use discount code DOT3PACK \nAmazon was the first to make a speaker for the smart home. The Amazon Echo Dot is the cheapest of the bunch and arguably the most versatile. While the Amazon Echo and Google Home are both all-in-one smart speakers, their speakers actually aren’t the best performers. The Echo Dot is a fraction of the price starting at $49.99, making it $80 cheaper than the Google Home and $120 cheaper than the Echo. You can connect it to your own speakers as long as they have a 3.5mm audio jack. Right now for the first time ever, Amazon is running a promotion where you can save $20 on a pack of three which makes it the exact same price as the Google Home. That means you can put an Echo Dot in your bedroom, office and kitchen. They will also make for fantastic gifts this holiday season. \nIt can set alarms, play music, news and audiobooks, control smart home products, and even order a pizza and an Uber taxi ride.

      "text": "Hyundai adds Amazon's Alexa to its Blue Link connected cars Start your car from your living room, or switch your lights on before you get home. Share Save \nIt's no fun starting your commute by going at your car with an ice scraper on a frosty morning. If you own a 2016 Hyundai, you won't have to -- at least if you have an Amazon Echo at home. The car-maker has baked Amazon's Alexa virtual assistant into its Blue Link connected car app . This means you can start your car, and set the temperature (among other things) from the warm embrace of your comforter using just your voice starting today. \nHyundai isn't the first to think about connecting its cars to Amazon's smarthome kit. Back at CES in January, Ford announced it'd be integrating Alexa with its SYNC platform. That still hasn't come to pass, though. Hyundai still isn't technically the first, with its own luxury Marque -- Genesis -- adding the same functionality back in August . At least now, those of us without the budget for a G80, or G90 can get in on the action. \nWhat can you do from the driver's seat of your new Hyundai? Most of the things you'd imagine, which include starting/stopping your car, setting the climate control, lock or unlock the doors, toggle the lights, or even set off the horn (for scaring the bejeezus out of the mail carrier, we assume). There's no option to locate your car right now, but Hyundai tells us that's in the works. If you're familiar with Blue Link, you'll know that much of this functionality is already in the app, Hyundai's just adding in another layer of convenience. \nYou'll need to be a paying user of Blue Link of course, which costs $99 a month, but if you are, you're good to go starting today. Hyundai says that all 2017 vehicles will be compatible, and most of its 2016 lineup too. There are even a few 2015 models that will get the feature too, so be sure to check to see if your car made the cut.

Business Insider has affiliate partnerships, so we may get a share of the revenue from your purchase.\nAmazon\nIn the tech world, it's hard to find cheap products that are universally praised.\nBut Panasonic has done it. The company's sub-$10 headphones have gotten over 25,000 5-star ratings on Amazon .\nMake no mistake, these are no-frill earbuds. They don't have a mic for voice calls, and their L-shaped headphone jack might make them a no-go depending on your phone's case.\nStill, people really seem to like how they sound.\nRunners have ran with them, audio engineers have put them to the test, and those who've ruined their first pair in the wash have gone back and bought a second.\nBuying multiple pairs of these headphones was actually a common theme in many of the reviews. People like the sound of these so much that they've bought a spare pair in case Panasonic stops selling them.\nMost of the reviews are vague about the sound quality, saying they're \"good\" or \"great\" or \"clean\" or \"clear.\" Some more in-depth reviews describe their sound as a little extra bassy, but not enough to annoy you. The midrange and highs seem to be praised, too; so these should perform well regardless of your preferred genre of music.\nBasically, if you have an idea in your head of what $10 headphones should sound like, it seems like these perform better than that.\nAnother compliment these earbuds got consistently is that they're really good at staying in your ears. That can be a problem with gummy-tipped earbuds like these, but apparently they stay in even when you're running. Panasonic includes two different-sized tips in the packaging, so if you haven't had problems with earbuds like these before, you probably won't with these.\nNobody in the reviews said that these were the be-all and end-all of headphones. They seem to be perfect for people who want a cheap set of earbuds that don't sound or feel cheap. If you're into audio, these might surprise you, as they've surprised the audiophiles that have given them a shot.\nPanasonic ErgoFit In-Ear Earbud Headphones, $10.93, available at Amazon\nThis article was originally published on 10/7/2016.\nDisclosure: This post is brought to you by Business Insider's Insider Picks team.

      "text": "Amazon opens fulfillment center, to hire 350 workers Published 1:22 pm, Tuesday, November 15, 2016 PITTSTON, Pa. (AP) — The online retail giant Amazon says it has opened a nearly-400,000-square-foot building in northeastern Pennsylvania and is hiring 350 warehouse positions. The (Wilkes-Barre) Citizens' Voice ( http://bit.ly/2fW7su3 ) reports that Amazon opened a fulfillment center in CenterPoint Commerce and Trade Park West in Pittston Township. A Pennsylvania CareerLink Luzerne County spokeswoman says the company is recruiting for warehouse positions that pay $13 an hour. A spokesman inside the building and a representative of Mericle Commercial Real Estate Services both referred questions to Amazon's corporate headquarters, which didn't immediately respond to requests for comment.
