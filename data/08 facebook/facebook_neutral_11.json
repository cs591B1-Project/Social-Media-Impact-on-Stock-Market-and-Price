Obama doubled the debt almost 10 trillion dollars. Wouldn’t you say we already are bankrupt? One thing you can count on his that the dollar will decline from its 18 year high-- we will see more inflation whether it was Trump’s fault or Obama’s it won’t really matter. My suggestion is to buy gold and silver now rather than later",

      "text": "Are agencies still struggling with Facebook? By Katie McQuater - 22 November 2016 00:01am Ed Couchman, director of agency partnerships. \nAgencies are still struggling to fully grasp what role Facebook can play on the media plan, according to the social network’s director of agency partnerships Ed Couchman. \n“Previously we've been a bit guilty of talking too much about ourselves and not about how Facebook can fit into an overall marketing and communications strategy,” said Couchman. “We're trying to help understand that, so not just around social for social's sake, but asking what can we add or what incremental reach can we provide or what value can we add to an overall communications plan as the most important thing.” \nCouchman's observations came during The Drum's visit to Facebook’s offices to attend one of its Blueprint sessions, a certification and training programme to help agencies optimise the platform. \nThe programme is Facebook’s response to the quandary advertisers face in trying to stay ahead of the curve with innovation and understand the many iterations to the ever expanding suite of Facebook advertising products, according to Couchman. \nWhile the social network is as admittedly at fault in communicating its value, advertisers have also played their part; many marketers still view Facebook in terms of its social value, placing emphasis on likes and other vanity metrics, something the programme is keen to encourage agencies to move away from and focus more on the marketing objectives. \nHowever, Jerry Daykin, digital partner at Carat Global, believes the industry has come a long way from the early days of chasing vanity metrics to evaluate Facebook for the \"powerful media channel that it is - increasingly using 3rd party partners to truly validate it\". \n“We’re pretty clear on the roles Facebook can play in media plans, but of course the reality is that like with any media channel that role is not always the same: We incorporate their audience data in our AV planning to build a holistic plan across TV, Facebook and other channels; we tap into their vast audience to maximise reach of (near) static creative to reinforce key messages; we use their app install or direct response products when the brief requires; and we could go on. \n\"It is a big part of many of our clients plans today and will continue to be so, though of course it is not always the answer and as the platform continues to evolve so will our approach to it.” \nWhile one aim of the Blueprint programme is to simply keep marketers more informed, the more interesting objective, he said, is acting as a partner in agencies’ “digital transformation journey”. \n\"[We're] trying to answer this agenda that all agencies are looking to upskill their teams in digital and go on a digital transformation journey. All agencies are doing that – they might have different language but that's essentially what they're doing.\" \nOne of Facebook’s biggest strategic challenges, according to Couchman, is shifting perceptions of how work is created for the platform. Agencies are often still simply reusing work from other channels, rather than creating it purposely for Facebook's ad platform. \n“A large amount of work we see on the platform is still work repurposed from other channels like outdoor or TV. I think it's our biggest strategic challenge – we need brands to craft work for the platform because that's when the platform really shines – we see that across the board.” \nThe key questions Couchman hears from agencies are around whether they're harnessing the platform to its full capability and what success looks like on Facebook, and also the \"perennial question\" of Facebook's organisational structure – what to buy, and how to buy it. \nSabino Petruccelli, head of performance marketing at Starcom MediaVest Group, who attended the Blueprint session, wanted to ensure the planning teams had a better understanding of what data and targeting solutions Facebook offers. He said the session highlighted the importance of training across agency teams, particularly in evolving platforms. \n“Too often, knowledge might sit within specialist teams – and to some degree it obviously has to – but for cross channel planners working on a diverse range of clients with differing objectives, upskilling them so they have a greater understanding will guarantee they’re more comfortable in future discussions with clients,” he said. \nFacebook has faced recent criticism over its accountability to advertisers following revelations over miscalculated metrics , with the company moving to reassure brands of its plan to overhauling its measurement tools to resolve the issues. \nThis article is about: World , Facebook , Marketing , Digital , Technology Katie McQuater",

      "text": "‘My fake news helped Trump win’ Nov 22, 2016 0 87 \nPaul Horner, a Facebook fake-news impressario tells Caitlin Dewey: “There’s nothing you can’t write about now that people won’t believe.” Donald Trump embraces his son, Eric Trump, at his election night rally in Manhattan, New York. Picture: Carlo Allegri \nWashington: What do the Amish lobby, gay wedding vans and the ban of the national anthem have in common? For starters, they’re all make-believe and invented by the same man. \nPaul Horner, the 38-year-old impresario of a Facebook fake-news empire, has made his living off viral news hoaxes for several years. \nBut in recent months, Horner has found the fake-news ecosystem growing more crowded, more political and vastly more influential. \nIn March, Donald Trump’s son, Eric, and his then-campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, even tweeted links to one of Horner’s faux-articles. His stories have appeared as news on Google. \nIn light of concerns that stories like Horner’s may have affected the US presidential election, and in the wake of announcements that Google and Facebook would take action against deceptive outlets, The Washington Post called Horner to discuss his perspective on fake news. \nQ: You’ve been writing fake news for a while now. I’d call it hoaxing or fake news. You’d call it parody or satire. How is that scene different now than it was three or five years ago? Why did something like your story about Obama invalidating the election results (almost 250 000 Facebook shares, as of this writing) go so viral? \nA: Honestly, people are definitely dumber. They just keep passing stuff around. Nobody fact-checks anything any more. I mean, that’s how Trump got elected. He just said whatever he wanted, and people believed everything, and when the things he said turned out not to be true, people didn’t care because they’d already accepted it. It’s real scary. I’ve never seen anything like it. \nQ: You mentioned Trump, and you’ve probably heard the argument, or the concern, that fake news somehow helped him get elected. What do you make of that? \nA: My sites were picked up by Trump supporters all the time. I think Trump is in the White House because of me. His followers don’t fact-check anything, they’ll post everything, believe anything. His campaign manager posted my story about a protester getting paid $3 500 as fact. I made that up. I posted a fake ad. \nQ: Why? Why would you even write that? \nA: Just because his supporters were under the belief that people were getting paid to protest at their rallies, and that’s just insane. I’ve gone to Trump protests, no one needs to get paid to protest Trump. I just wanted to make fun of that insane belief, but it took off. They actually believed it. \nI thought they’d fact-check it, and it’d make them look worse. I mean that’s how this always works: someone posts something I write, then they find out it’s false, then they look like idiots. But Trump supporters, they just keep running with it. They never fact-check anything. Now he’s in the White House. Looking back, instead of hurting the campaign, I think I helped it. And that feels (bad). \nQ: You think you personally helped elect Trump? \nA: I don’t know if I did or not. I don’t know. I don’t know. \nQ: I guess I’m curious, if you believed you might be having an unfair impact on the election, especially if that impact went against your own political beliefs, why didn’t you stop? Why keep writing? \nA: I didn’t think it was possible for him to get elected president. I thought I was messing with the campaign, maybe I wasn’t messing them up as much as I wanted, but I never thought he’d actually get elected. I didn’t even think about it. In hindsight, everyone should’ve seen this coming, everyone assumed Hillary (Clinton) would just get in. But she didn’t, and Trump is president. \nQ: Speaking of Clinton, did you target fake news at her supporters? Or Gary Johnson’s, for that matter? (Horner’s Facebook picture shows him at a rally for Johnson.) \nA: No. I hate Trump. \nQ: Is that it? You posted on Facebook a couple weeks ago that you had a lot of ideas for satirising Clinton and other figures, but that “no joke; in doing this for six years, the people who clicked ads the most, like it’s the cure for cancer, is right-wing Republicans”. That makes it sound like you’ve found targeting conservatives is more profitable. \nA: Yeah, it is. They don’t fact-check. \nQ: But a Trump presidency is good for you from a business perspective, right? \nA: It’s great for anybody who does anything with satire, there’s nothing you can’t write about now that people won’t believe. I can write the craziest thing about Trump, and people will believe it. \nI wrote a lot of crazy anti-Muslim stuff, like about Trump wanting to put badges on Muslims, or not allowing them in the airport, or making them stand in their own line and people went along with it! \nQ: Facebook and Google recently announced they’d no longer let fake-news sites use their advertising platforms. I know you basically make your living from those services. How worried are you about this? \nA: I know ways of getting hooked up under different names and sites. So probably if they cracked down, I would try different things. I have at least 10 sites right now. If they crack down on a couple, I’ll just use others. \nThey could shut down advertising on all my sites, and I think I’d be OK. Plus, Facebook and AdSense make a lot of money from (advertising on fake news sites) for them to just get rid of it. They’d lose a lot of money. \nQ: Thinking about this less selfishly, though, it might be good if Facebook and Google took action, right? Because the effects you’re describing are pretty scary. \nA: Yeah, a lot of the sites people are talking about, they’re just total BS sites. There’s no creativity or purpose behind them. I’m glad they’re getting rid of them. \nThere are so many horrible sites out there. I’m glad they’re getting rid of those sites. I just hope they don’t get rid of mine, too. IOL TAGS",

      "text": "Facebook \nFacebook's plan to spread internet around the world with giant unmanned drones has had a hiccup.\nBloomberg reports that the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), a US agency, is investigating after an incident during its first test flight of its \"Aquila\" drone that left it with \"substantial damage.\"\nThe social networking company had previously mentioned — without elaborating — \"a structural failure we experienced just before landing\" in a July blog post about the test flight .\nBut the test was otherwise presented as a big win, with The Verge's Casey Newton — who was given access to the Facebook team after the test — writing that the company \"presented the flight as an unqualified success.\"\nHowever, the drone was reportedly \"substantially damaged,\" meaning it is no longer \"airworthy.\"\nThe Aquila drones are huge, with 43-meter wingspans — bigger than a Boeing 737. They're designed to stay aloft for months at a time at altitudes of 60,000, powered by solar energy and beaming down wireless internet around the world. It's an ambitious project — and it looks like there are going to be challenges along the way.\n\"We were happy with the successful first test flight,\" a Facebook spokesperson told Business Insider in a statement, \"and were able to verify several performance models and components including aerodynamics, batteries, control systems and crew training, with no major unexpected results.\"\nOne source with knowledge of the incident claimed that it happened 20 feet above the ground on a final decent, and that it happened after the team flew the aircraft in conditions that were windier than planned.\nIt's not clear why Facebook did not disclose that the NTSB was investigating.\nNOW WATCH: Scientists attached a camera to a polar bear and revealed this never-before-seen footage \n",

      "text": "\nInstagram is not playing around. It has grown to become a behemoth after being bought by Facebook over 4 years ago and it must find ways to make sure the now half a billion users don’t find the need to leave the platform.\nYesterday, Instagram announced two new features: Disappearing photos and videos for Instagram Direct and Live Video . These are features that affect Snapchat and Twitter’s own Periscope directly in a big way.\nSnapchat is the biggest casualty with Instagram’s recent onslaught. Instagram started coming after Snapchat when they launched Instagram Stories in August, which was a copy of Snapchat Stories. It was obvious that they were not pumping the brakes yet to tackle Snapchat yet as they announced disappearing photos and videos, which was once Snapchat’s idiosyncratic feature. The Live video feature was only the icing to the cake as it targeted Snapchat’s Live Stories.\nHowever, Instagram’s implementation beats Snapchat in several ways:\nInstagram has a bigger audience than Snapchat: 500 million versus the reported 150 million users on Snapchat. The photos and videos taken on Instagam are of higher quality than the ones taken on Snapchat. Your live stories will pop up on Explore, which according to Instagram is visited by over 100 million people monthly, so bigger audience. Current Instagram users will not see the need to use Snapchat or sign up for it, which is not good news for Snapchat. Instagram is more popular than Snapchat in developing countries. Snapchat has features that give it a leg up on Instagram like their Discover platform for users to consume news, fun geofilters that show where you are and their ridiculous Lenses which are updated weekly. These features can still keep the current crop of users happy, but Instagram could decide to add that soon judging from their current rate.\nPeriscope is also in danger with Instagram’s foray into Live Video. The company introduced its live broadcasting app last year and after being acquired by Twitter, it has received several updates and tighter integration within the Twitter network. Although it has made it easier to start a live video broadcast from the official Twitter app, it is still not as intuitive as Instagram’s implementation.\nInstagram will affect Periscope in the following ways:\nTechnically, it has a bigger audience (500 million vs Twitter’s 300 million) and this could materialize when they decide to monetize. Starting a Live video broadcast on Instagram is way easier than Periscope. The former only needs a swiping gesture on the app, while the latter would need several taps on the Twitter app or by launching the separate app. Instagram’s Live video will probably be a better choice for most people out there than Periscope. Snapchat and Periscope now have the arduous task of making sure that their platforms survive Instagram’s increasing feature set, which is geared to make it an attractive platform for millions out there. Sure Snapchat has their rare Spectacles which will definitely amp how people share stories. Periscope has Periscope producer and their VIP program which is a bid to keep the influential people on the platform, but they still need to do more to prevent a situation like the mass exit of top Vine stars to other social networks.\nRead On Web → Instagram Is Coming For Periscope And Snapchat And They Need To Step Up \n",

      "text": "Recently, tech blog BGR graciously linked to an older post of mine showing that the scale at which fake news stories trend on Facebook can dwarf traditional news in terms of shares. The BGR story ended with this paragraph:\nOn a related note, it stands to reason that most individuals prone to believing a hyperbolic news story that skews to an extreme partisan position likely already have their minds made up. Arguably, Facebook in this instance isn’t so much influencing the voting patterns of Americans as it is bringing a prime manifestation of confirmation bias to the surface.\nAs regular readers know, my core expertise is not data analysis of Facebook, but in how learning environments (and particularly online learning environments) affect the way users think, act, and learn. A long time ago I was online political organizer, but my day job for many, many years has been the investigation and design of net-enabled learning experiences.\nThe BGR conclusion is a common one, and it intuitively meshes with our naive understanding of how the mind perceives truth. I see something I agree with and I reshare it—it doesn’t change my mind, because of course I already believed it when I reshared it. However, from a psychological perspective there are two major problems with this.\nSaying is believing The first problem is that saying is believing . This is an old and well-studied phenomenon, though perhaps understudied in social media. So when you see a post that says “Clintons suspected in murder-suicide” and you retweet or repost it, it’s not a neutral transaction. You, the reposter, don’t end that transaction unchanged. You may initially post it because, after all, “Whoa if true.” But the reposting shifts your orientation to the facts. You move from being a person reading information to someone arguing a side of an issue, and once you are on a side of the issue, no amount of facts or argument is going to budge you. This may have been built into the evolution of our reason itself. In this way, going through the process of stream curation is at heart a radicalizing process.\nI’ve said many times that all social software trains you to be something. Early Facebook trained you to remember birthdays and share photos, and to some extent this trained you to be a better person, or in any case the sort of person you desired to be.\nThe process that Facebook currently encourages, on the other hand, of looking at these short cards of news stories and forcing you to immediately decide whether to support or not support them trains people to be extremists. It takes a moment of ambivalence or nuance, and by design pushes the reader to go deeper into their support for whatever theory or argument they are staring at. When you consider that people are being trained in this way by Facebook for hours each day, that should scare the living daylights out of you.\nIt’s worthwhile to note as well that the nature of social media is we’re more likely to share inflammatory posts than non-inflammatory ones, which means that each Facebook session is a process by which we double down on the most radical beliefs in our feed.\nIn general, social media developers use design to foster behaviors that are useful to the community. But what is being fostered by this strange process that we put ourselves through each day?\nThink about this from the perspective of an Martian come to Earth, watching people reach for their phone in the morning and scrolling past shared headlines, deciding in seconds for each one whether to re-share it or comment or like it. The question the Martian would ask is: “What sort of training software are they are using, and what does it train people to do?”\nAnd the problem is that—unlike previous social sites—Facebook doesn’t know, because from Facebook’s perspective they have two goals, and neither is about the quality of the community or well-being of its members. The first goal is to keep you creating Facebook content in the form of shares, likes, and comments. Any value you get out of it as a person is not a direct Facebook concern, except as it impacts those goals. And so Facebook is designed to make you share without reading , and like without thinking, because that is how Facebook makes its money and lock-in, by having you create social content (and personal marketing data) it can use.\nThe second Facebook goal is to keep you on the site at all costs, since this is where they can serve you ads. And this leads to another problem we can talk about more fully in another post. Your average news story — something from the New York Times on a history of the Alt-Right, for example — won’t get clicked, because Facebook has built their environment to resist people clicking external links. Marketers figured this out and realized that to get you to click they had to up the ante. So they produced conspiracy sites that have carefully designed, fictional stories that are inflammatory enough that you *will* click.\nIn other words, the consipiracy clickbait sites appeared as a reaction to a Facebook interface that resisted external linking. And this is why fake news does better on Facebook than real news .\nTo be as clear as I possibly can—by setting up this dynamic, Facebook simultaneously set up the perfect conspiracy replication machine and incentivized the creation of a new breed of conspiracy clickbait sites.\nThere will be a lot of talk in the coming days about this or that change Facebook is looking at. But look at these two issues to get the real story:\nDo they promote deep reading over interaction? Do they encourage you to leave the site, even when the link is not inflammatory? Next time you’re on Facebook you’ll notice there are three buttons at the bottom of each piece of content, outlining the actions you can take on that content. None of them says “read”.\nFacebook makes conspiracies familiar, and familiarity equals truth It would be terrifying enough if this existential problem—that Facebook was training people to be extremists and conspiracists through a process of re-sharing—was the worst bit. But it’s not. The larger problem is the far larger number of people who see the headlines and do not reshare them.\nWhy is this a problem? Because for the most part, our brains equate “truth” with “things we’ve seen said a lot by people we trust.” The literature in this area is vast—it’s one of the reasons, for example, that so many people believe that global warming is a hoax.\nIf you think about it, it’s not a bad heuristic for some things. If someone tells you that there’s better farmland over the mountain, and then another person tells you that, and then another person, then your mind starts seeing this as more likely to be true than not, especially if the folks telling you this are folks you trust. If someone tells you that there’s gold mines under every house in the town, but they can’t be touched because of federal laws—well that’s not something you hear a lot, so that’s obviously false.\nYou say—no, that’s not it at all! The gold mines are ridiculous, that’s why I don’t believe in them! The good farmland is logical! I’m a logical being, dammit!\nI’m sorry, you’re not, at least on most days. If enough people told you about the gold mines, and every paper in the town made passing reference to the gold mines you would consider people who didn’t believe in the hidden gold mines to be ridiculous. Want examples of this? Look at the entire sweep of history.\nOr look at Lisa Fazio’s work on the illusory truth effect. The effect of familiarity is so strong that giving you a multiple choice question about something you know is wrong—“The Atlantic Ocean is the largest in the world, True or False?” can actually increase your doubt that you are right, and even convince you of the false fact. Why? Because it counts as exposure to the idea that other people believe the lie. This is why Betteridge Headlines are so dangerously unethical. If I publish headlines once a week asking “Is There Gold Buried Under Sunnydale?” with an article that says probably not, eventually when you are asked that question by someone else your mind will go—you know, I think I’ve heard something like that.\nAll it takes is repetition. That’s it.\nDon’t believe me? Go check out how many people believe Obama is a Muslim. Or ask yourself a question like “Does Mike Pence support gay conversion therapy?” without looking up anything and then ask yourself how it is that you “know” that one way or the other. If you know it, you know it because it seems familiar. A lot of people you trust have said it. That’s it. That’s all you got.\nIf Betteridge Headlines are borderline unethical, then Facebook is well over that line. The headlines that float by you on Facebook for one to two hours a day, dozens at a time, create a sense of familiarity with ideas that are not only wrong, but hateful and dangerous. This is further compounded by the fact that what is highlighted on the cards that Facebook is not the source of the article, which is so small and gray as to be effectively invisible, but the friendly smiling face of someone you trust.\n\nThe article that intimated Clinton may have murdered an FBI agent and his wife and burned them in their home to conceal the evidence was shared by over half a million people . If we assume a share rate of 20-to-1 that means that over 10 million people were exposed to the idea that this actually happened. If we assume that there is a lot of overlap in social networks, we can assume that they were exposed to it repeatedly, and it came from many people they trusted.\nAnd that’s just one headline. People exposed themselves to Facebook multiple times a day, every single day, seeing headlines making all sorts of crazy claims, and filed them in their famil-o-meter for future reference. We’ve never seen something on this scale. Not even close.\nIf Facebook was a tool for confirmation bias, that would kind of suck. It would. But that is not the claim. The claim is that Facebook is quite literally training us to be conspiracy theorists. And given the history of what happens when conspiracy theory and white supremacy mix, that should scare the hell out of you.\nI’m petrified. Mark Zuckerberg should be too.\nThis piece originally appeared on Hapgood . Follow Mike on Twitter at @holden . Learn how to write for Quartz Ideas . We welcome your comments at ideas@qz.com . ",

      "text": "Follow KRLD: Facebook | Twitter \nOn November 22nd 1963 “As The World Turns” was on CBS Television when the first bulletins were broadcast. \n“Here is a bulletin from CBS News. In Dallas, Texas three shots were fired at President Kennedy’s motorcade…” announced Walter Cronkite to a disbelieving audience. \nWe all know the rest of the event of that day and The Sixth Floor Museum in Dealey Plaza tells that story and much more. \n“The museum explores the history and context of the 1960’s and provides those who remember the assassination, and those that don’t remember the assassination, sort of a window into the past” said Curator of The Sixth Floor Museum Stephen Fagin. \nYou will see Jack Ruby’s gray fedora that he wore on the fateful day he shot Lee Harvey Oswald on live television as well as hundreds of other artifacts. \n“We have the two key evidence areas recreated. The snipers perch in the southeast corner and then we have the area reconstructed where the rifle was found” Fagin added. \nTonight Alexandra Zapruder, the granddaughter of Abraham Zapruder, will discuss her book “Twenty-Six Seconds”. It is a personal history of the Zapruder, film shot by her grandfather, and the effect it had on history and her family. \nThe Sixth Floor Museum is open year around. Annually over 400,000 visitors come to this place where history was made on a sunny day in November 1963.",

      "text": "Facebook is opening up a new London office, despite Brexit uncertainty Facebook is opening up a new London office, despite Brexit uncertainty Facebook to expand presence in Britain by 50 per cent in 2017, despite uncertainty sparked over BREXIT. By: Reuters | London | Published:November 22, 2016 10:04 am Facebook said it would hire 500 new staff, adding to the 1,000 people it already employs in Britain. (Image source: AP) \nFacebook said it would expand its presence in Britain by 50 percent in 2017, joining other US technology firms in increasing investment despite the uncertainty sparked by the country’s vote to leave the European Union. \nThe social network firm said it would hire 500 new staff, adding to the 1,000 people it already employs in Britain, as Facebook gears up to open a new UK headquarters in London next year, following other firms drawn by talent and a thriving tech start-up scene. \nBefore the Brexit referendum in June, campaigners in favour of remaining in the EU had warned that international companies could seek to reduce their presence in Britain as a withdrawal from the bloc would make it a less attractive place to invest. \nSome big banks such as Goldman Sachs and Citi, which employ many thousands in London’s financial centre, are said to be considering shifting some jobs elsewhere in Europe as a result of Brexit, a worry for the British economy where financial services account for around 10 percent of output and provide some of the best paying jobs. \nFacebook’s UK expansion comes after Google , owned by parent company Alphabet Inc, said earlier in November that it would invest an estimated 1 billion pounds, and make 3,000 new hires in the Britain. \n“The UK is definitely one of the very best places to be a technology company,” Facebook vice-president of Europe, Middle East and Africa Nicola Mendelsohn said at a conference run by the CBI, an employers group, adding that it was too early to say what Brexit would mean for the movement of labour. \n“The movement of talent is something…that matters to us.” she said, adding that Facebook employs people of 65 different nationalities in Britain. Facebook opened its first engineering office outside the US in London in 2012 and has been growing rapidly in the UK since. Its main UK operating unit’s staffing increased by 90 percent in 2015 from 2014, according to its latest accounts, with more than half of those hired engineers. \nRead: Mark Zuckerberg lays out plan to tackle ‘Fake News’ problem on Facebook \nIt also employs hundreds of sales and marketing staff who tend to focus on larger clients or running regional teams, according to Facebook job ads and LinkedIn profiles of staff. Amazon, which created 3,500 UK jobs in 2016 at its head office, research and development centres, customer service centres and distribution depots, plans a further 2,300 jobs at three new distribution centres in 2017. \nAMAZING ECOSYSTEM \nSuch investments have helped Britain’s tech sector to shine at a time when some other firms are less optimistic. A recent survey showed that three out of four companies with sales between 100 million pounds and 1 billion pounds have considered moving operations to the European continent in the wake of the vote. \nMendelsohn said that Britain needed to work hard to keep its position as a global hub for technology. “We need to make sure that we continue to look outwards and not inwards; we need to stay competitive, and we need to remain a welcome home to tech,” she said. \nLondon ranked no.1 for start-ups in the 2016 European Digital City Index, and Google said the talent pool, educational institutions, and passion for innovation helped it decide to invest more in Britain, sentiments echoed by Mendelsohn. \n“It’s a place that our engineers want to come and work at, it’s a place that we see this amazing ecosystem, not of just tech companies but also of creative companies coming together inspiring, fuelling one another,” she said. \nFacebook has a complex corporate structure for tax purposes and declared Dublin as its European headquarters which means almost no taxable profits are reported in the UK. It also has significant historic tax losses on its books, which means any cut in corporation tax would have little impact on its finances. \nUK Prime Minister Theresa May is reported to be considering cutting corporation tax from the 20 percent headline rate in a move to attract companies away from other parts of the EU to Britain.

Under the definitions floating around, is M4Carbine General Discussion a \"Fake News\" site? No. It does not purport to be a news site. It does not have journalists looking for and reporting \"news\". (Theoretically objectively) A forum by definition would not be a news site, though we for sure discuss the news. And given how non-objective the press/news was lately I have seen posts here which highlighted a development or article I would not have seen otherwise. We can certainly learn of current events in a forum even if the forum itself is not a news org.",

She most especially loves it whenever the rain starts to pour and her two pets get sentimental. \n“My cats love to go outside and explore the world, but when it’s raining they prefer to stay indoors and stare outside the window,” she told Bored Panda. \n“A couple of months ago I tried to put a blanket on them, to take a sweet photo of them together and they didn’t mind it,” she added. “From that moment I decided to photograph my cats in front of the window, whenever it’s raining.” \nWow. We always knew felines were jerks, but we never realised they have a deep melancholic side too! \nSee more of Felicity Berkleef and her two cats on Instagram .

(AP) - Construction industry leaders are criticizing standards being imposed on subcontractors for Facebook's data center project in Los Lunas. \nThe Albuquerque Journal reports ( http://bit.ly/2fluZ5k ) that some industry representatives say the requirements will likely disqualify most New Mexico companies. \nFortis Construction, the data center's Portland, Ore.-based general contractor, announced last week that it would subcontract only with companies that are willing to have no more than 20 percent of their annual revenue committed to the data center project. They also said they require subcontractors to have excellent safety records and experience working on large projects. \nAssociated Builders and Contractors of New Mexico President Roxanne Rivera-Wiest says only 10 to 15 percent of New Mexico contractors could meet those guidelines. \nFortis officials say contractors who don't meet those requirements may still be able to become sub-tier contractors. \nInformation from: Albuquerque Journal, http://www.abqjournal.com  ",

      "text": "John chalekson was recently banned from linkedin.com. please follow me on Facebook. 6 mins ago Dear Mark Zuckerberg, Don’t Censor Our News Dear Mark ZuckerbergIn the wake of Hillary Clinton’s loss to Donald Trump in the U.S. presidential election, Facebook has been targeted by behind the scene oligarchic forces (George Soros/Media Matters) and their respective government representatives, such as President Obama, as being partially responsible for the outcome of the election through the spread of misinformation.Since the election, there has been a push to have Facebook censor “fake news” as forwarded by controversial social justice warrior professor Mish Zimdars, who released a “fake news” list that featured “False, Misleading, Clickbait-y, and/or Satirical ‘News’ Sources.” The problem is that only two of those modifiers suggest actual fake news —”false” and “satirical.” The other two words are judgment calls that we make, ourselves, as informed readers. And while many people welcome the censoring of clearly fallacious new stories, there is an insidious nature in the manner in which ideologically based news sites have been lumped in with satire and false news. There is a clear and present danger of a massive censorship regime that includes legitimate, ideologically based, news content on Facebook — an extremely slippery slope to traverse once venturing down the path of stifling the free flow of information.Many of the sites listed on Zimdars’ list, which was widely distributed across mainstream corporate media, are not “fake news,” but rather ideologically based sites that analyze facts through their unique lens. These sites, such as Breitbart, Zero Hedge, The Other 98% and us, here at The Free Thought Project, span the political spectrum from right to left. However, the one common thread they all share is that they provide a perspective outside of the mainstream interpretation of actual events that have transpired. As Reason presciently noted:So in an environment where “fake news” is policed by third parties that rely on expert analysis, we could see ideologically driven posts from outlets censored entirely because they’re lesser known or smaller, while larger news sites get a pass on spreading heavily ideological opinion pieces. So a decision by Facebook to censor “fake news” would heavily weigh in favor of the more mainstream and “powerful” traditional media outlets. What you are actually seeing transpire is a concerted effort by those in control of the media/state apparatus to regain control of the distribution of information shared within society, as the traditional gatekeepers of information have lost that control, due to social media, and can thus no longer control and shape the informational narrative as effectively. Throughout this election cycle, it was these independent/non-corporate media outlets that reported on WikiLeaks, as the corporate media simply ignored the daily revelations contained in the DNC and Podesta emails. And while the old media dinosaurs toed the line — forwarding essentially only government approved news — the alternative media blew the doors off the election campaign by reporting on a continuous stream of damning revelations released by the transparency organization. Essentially, U.S. mainstream corporate media has been weaponized as a means of controlling public opinion by propagandizing the American people. World renowned academic Noam Chomsky, in his book “Manufacturing Consent: The Political Economy of the Mass Media,” detailed how U.S. media frequently serve as an errand boy for U.S. corporate, military and imperial interests. Chomsky forwarded the concept of what he labeled the “propaganda model.” Although the book was written in 1988, it speaks precisely to what is currently taking place and clearly revealed in the Podesta emails.“The media serve, and propagandize on behalf of, the powerful societal interests that control and finance them. The representatives of these interests have important agendas and principles that they want to advance, and they are well positioned to shape and constrain media policy.” – ChomskyOne need only look at China’s policy of “Harmonizing” the internet to understand where this type of activity ultimately leads. In 2004, the Chinese Communist Party announced the goal of constructing a “Harmonious Society,” which underpins the Chinese government’s Internet censorship regime. China now employs over 2 million people to monitor and censor online content. While in an authoritarian state, such as China, direct force can be applied to control the direction of society and peoples’ actions (government censors), in a Western democracy, as Chomsky notes, it’s the narrative of information fed to the public that informs peoples’ perspectives which typically keeps the population in control. Mr. Zuckerberg, we implore you to not implement a Chinese-style censorship regime on Facebook, and to allow the continued free flow of information that underpins the fabric of American democracy. Please do not let your platform be the government proxy for state censorship! Signed,Please sign the petition below and share this on Facebook, tagging Mark Zuckerberg.

      "text": "Follow CBSMIAMI.COM: Facebook | Twitter \nTALLAHASSEE (CBSMiami/NSF) – In a highly unusual move, Florida Supreme Court Chief Justice Jorge Labarga has ordered an investigation of a death penalty lawyer who has repeatedly missed critical deadlines, was involved in a capital case in which roach-infested boxes of documents were destroyed by rain and who is currently representing two inmates who are trying to fire her.\nLabarga ordered the probe of Fort Lauderdale lawyer Mary Catherine Bonner “pursuant to the Court’s authority to monitor the representation of capital defendants to ensure that the defendants receive quality representation” on November 8th, seven months after prominent death-penalty lawyer Martin McClain wrote to the court outlining concerns about Bonner.\nBonner, included in a registry of lawyers appointed by the court to represent Florida Death Row inmates in post-conviction appeals, was rebuked by a federal judge several years ago for failing on two separate occasions to meet a one-year deadline to file habeas corpus petitions. Such federal appeals provide inmates a last chance to have their convictions reviewed on a variety of grounds.\nIn this month’s administrative order, Labarga appointed 3rd District Court of Appeal Judge Kevin Emas as the referee in the Bonner investigation and named Belvin Perry, a former 9th Judicial Circuit chief judge who presided over the Casey Anthony murder trial, to serve as special counsel to the referee.\nLabarga gave Emas 90 days to complete the inquiry and file a report on Bonner.\n“The referee shall make findings of fact and recommend any necessary remedial action, including the removal of Mary Catherine Bonner from the registry for postconviction capital attorneys, if appropriate,” the two-page order said.\nBonner did not respond to phone calls and emails seeking comment.\nNumerous death-penalty legal experts told The News Service of Florida that Labarga’s order appeared to be the first of its kind.\nFlorida’s death penalty has been under scrutiny for nearly a year, since the U.S. Supreme Court, in a case known as Hurst v. Florida, issued a ruling in January that struck down the state’s capital sentencing system as unconstitutional because it gave too much power to judges, instead of juries.\nState lawmakers hurriedly passed a new law intended to fix the deficiency, but the Florida Supreme Court last month overturned that law because it did not require unanimous jury recommendations for the death penalty to be imposed.\nLabarga ordered the Bonner investigation after McClain sent a letter April 4 to the clerk of the Florida Supreme Court raising alarms about two Death Row inmates, Alphonso Cave and Paul William Scott, whom Bonner represents in state court. Cave and Scott have independently asked the court to dismiss Bonner from their cases; both men alleged that their lawyer went for years without contacting them. McClain represented Scott for a period over a decade ago, as well as Cave’s co-defendant, who has since been executed.\nMcClain also wrote about Bonner’s court-appointed representation of two Death Row inmates — including Mark James Asay, whose pending execution was put on hold by the Florida Supreme Court earlier this year. McClain now represents the two Death Row inmates.\nIn 2009, U.S. District Judge Timothy Corrigan harshly criticized Bonner for filing federal appeals in the cases of Asay and William Greg Thomas more than 200 days after a one-year deadline had run out.\nBonner blamed the delays in part on health problems both she and her husband had undergone, but the Jacksonville judge was not appeased.\n“The terms ‘bad faith’ or ‘dishonesty’ capture Ms. Bonner’s conduct and are the type of egregious conduct that rises well above professional negligence or even gross negligence,” Corrigan wrote of Bonner’s handling of Asay’s petitions in 2009.\nBonner’s delays in filing the federal appeals prompted Corrigan to grant “equitable tolling” in both cases, allowing the missed deadlines to be ignored.\nThe Florida Attorney General’s office, which represents the state in capital cases, opposed giving the inmates more time to file the federal appeals but maintained that Bonner’s conduct warranted sanctions.\nEven so, the state opposes allowing inmates whom Bonner currently represents to fire her.\nIn March, Cave sent a hand-written letter to the Supreme Court requesting that Bonner be terminated as his attorney, saying he had not seen her in four years and she had not responded to his letters and calls.\nCave — whom Bonner has represented for nearly half of the more than three decades he has spent on Death Row — was concerned about the impact of the Hurst ruling on his case. That decision prompted the state court to put the scheduled executions of Asay and Cary Michael Lambrix on hold indefinitely.\nIn April, Bonner asked the state court to keep her on as Cave’s lawyer, saying she “took a very bad fall” and broke her shoulder. Bonner went on to describe in detail problems she encountered during her recovery, including “a terrible adverse reaction to pain medication” and lengthy waits at the hospital where she was being treated.\nBonner — who has a clean record with The Florida Bar — also wrote to Cave, asking him to keep her on as his attorney.\n“I care about your fate and will vigorously litigate on your behalf,” she wrote to the inmate on April 3.\nIn a hand-written response to the court dated April 11, Cave wrote that he simply wanted a lawyer who would file the appropriate documents on his behalf.\n“It is unfortunate and just not right that I had to write this Honorable Court to get my lawyer to correspond with me,” Cave, 57, wrote.\nCave’s letter is the latest document posted in his case on the Florida Supreme Court website.\nScott also asked the court to remove Bonner as his lawyer in state court. After the court refused that request, Scott appealed. That appeal is pending, according to the state court website.\nAsay’s case became the focus of attention earlier this year.\nMcClain took over Asay’s case in January, shortly after Gov. Rick Scott set a March execution date for the convicted double murderer.\nAfter being sentenced to die, Asay went for a decade without legal representation, and almost all of the paper records involving his case went missing or were destroyed.\nMcClain described difficulties he encountered trying to retrieve documents from Bonner, who had served as Asay’s lawyer in the federal appeals.\n“Despite the exigencies created by Mr. Asay’s pending death warrant, she repeatedly delayed ascertaining and advising what files she had. About a week into the warrant, she had four mold and insect infested boxes delivered to my office. One of the boxes was largely empty. All of the material in the boxes had been exposed to water and was ruined. The prevalence of mold made the boxes a health hazard,” McClain wrote to Florida Supreme Court Clerk John Tomasino on April 4.\nBonner later delivered more boxes to McClain “after they had been left outside in a driving rain storm,” he continued.\nThe boxes were “completely waterlogged” and “were literally disintegrating as they were carried to my office,” he wrote.\nMuch of the material in the boxes was unrelated to Asay’s case, according to McClain’s letter.\nThe News Service of Florida’s Dara Kam contributed to this report.\n",

      "text": "Alyssa Sanderford is a dog lover just like anybody else. So when she saw on Facebook that a mutual friend’s dog “Wiley” had gone missing, she shared the post so that someone might be able to help find him. The last thing she expected was that she would be the one who would find him!\nWhile driving through Dallas, according to SunnySkyz , Alyssa saw a dog that looked pretty similar to Wiley. Standing next to him was a man with long black hair who was about 5’9 or so. As Alyssa approached them both, the man took off! What ensued was an exhilarating chase. Alyssa has left her purse as well as her shoes in the car, but didn’t want the man to get away, so she decided to just go after the man while wearing NO shoes!\nEventually Alyssa caught up to the man and was able to wrestle Wiley away from him. She then, with the help of a few others, was able to get Wiley back home to his owners. How awesome is that?\nFor a full account on the chase, click HERE .\n",

      "text": "I have, so far, never done a live video. Not on Periscope or YouTube or Facebook or Snapchat, or now, on Instagram. \nI can only imagine a few instances where I might. If I was witnessing a news event (I imagine the worst kind), or sky diving (which I’ll never do), or at my own wedding (which, unfortunately, is not a once-in-a-lifetime event, so that’s out). This does not sound like a potent ad environment to me. Boy, am I wrong. \nAccording to eMarketer, Instagram has 67.2 million U.S. users now and will 95 million in 2020--almost 30% of the population. Its ad revenue from mobile devices will go up 70% between now and 2018, from $1.58 billion to $4.65 billion, after rising an astonishing 165% in the U.S. (and 788% worldwide!) from 2015 to this year. \nThe promotional video Instagram provides t o introduce its live capability is loaded with snippets of people doing the most unremarkable things, and all of these people are not just young but from the looks of it, junior-high-school young. Maybe it makes sense that a brief, live documentation of something they’re doing is enough. They recognize it is just a moment in time. It is not a photo they will look back at when they’re, oh 16, and say, I remember that. \nYou’d think--well, I’d think--the marketers of live video would want to carefully say the opposite. Photo images and even live video seems to be based on the idea that the subject of the video is interesting or significant. The old Kodak film used to talk about Kodak “Moments,” those times in life when an event was so noteworthy it might be worth 24 or even 36 images. Lately, Kodak re-introduced Kodak Moments as an app that would let a user create a kind of online scrapbook of meaningful images, getting away from the “seemingly endless number of selfies” infecting the image-creating world. \nWrong idea, probably Photos and video are so simple now they can replace two other heretofore more accessible ways of communicating, by voice or writing. A selfie is a phone call, or a sentence. \nAnd who cares if your image has nothing much to “say”? Oddly, it seems, no one young enough, who is otherwise bothered by any piece of visual or textual material that fails to grab them immediately, is bothered by tiresome live video. Look at the TV commercials Facebook produced touting their new Facebook Live app. With a touch of a button, you can go live with video of a. . . a bolt of lightning! Or a video of yourself exclaiming as your feet touch the water at the shoreline.  “Am I dreaming? No. I’m on a weekend getaway,” say you, our star. Friends, in theory, need to know this right now. \nI think the idea we’re supposed to have is that  live video is to show off something we feel is meaningful, as it is happening. I suspect, in practice, live may be a way to show your face that in fact removes the necessity of importance or significance or care to edit or think something out. Rather than special, it might be designed to be ordinary. Like a video home to your parents from your dorm room at a time you are sure they won’t see it live. It says something and it doesn’t, too. pj@mediapost.com",

      "text": "I have, so far, never done a live video. Not on Periscope or YouTube or Facebook or Snapchat, or now, on Instagram. \nI can only imagine a few instances where I might. If I was witnessing a news event (I imagine the worst kind), or sky diving (which I’ll never do), or at my own wedding (which, unfortunately, is not a once-in-a-lifetime event, so that’s out). This does not sound like a potent ad environment to me. Boy, am I wrong. \nAccording to eMarketer, Instagram has 67.2 million U.S. users now and will 95 million in 2020--almost 30% of the population. Its ad revenue from mobile devices will go up 70% between now and 2018, from $1.58 billion to $4.65 billion, after rising an astonishing 165% in the U.S. (and 788% worldwide!) from 2015 to this year. \nThe promotional video Instagram provides t o introduce its live capability is loaded with snippets of people doing the most unremarkable things, and all of these people are not just young but from the looks of it, junior-high-school young. Maybe it makes sense that a brief, live documentation of something they’re doing is enough. They recognize it is just a moment in time. It is not a photo they will look back at when they’re, oh 16, and say, I remember that. \nYou’d think--well, I’d think--the marketers of live video would want to carefully say the opposite. Photo images and even live video seems to be based on the idea that the subject of the video is interesting or significant. The old Kodak film used to talk about Kodak “Moments,” those times in life when an event was so noteworthy it might be worth 24 or even 36 images. Lately, Kodak re-introduced Kodak Moments as an app that would let a user create a kind of online scrapbook of meaningful images, getting away from the “seemingly endless number of selfies” infecting the image-creating world. \nWrong idea, probably Photos and video are so simple now they can replace two other heretofore more accessible ways of communicating, by voice or writing. A selfie is a phone call, or a sentence. \nAnd who cares if your image has nothing much to “say”? Oddly, it seems, no one young enough, who is otherwise bothered by any piece of visual or textual material that fails to grab them immediately, is bothered by tiresome live video. Look at the TV commercials Facebook produced touting their new Facebook Live app. With a touch of a button, you can go live with video of a. . . a bolt of lightning! Or a video of yourself exclaiming as your feet touch the water at the shoreline.  “Am I dreaming? No. I’m on a weekend getaway,” say you, our star. Friends, in theory, need to know this right now. \nI think the idea we’re supposed to have is that  live video is to show off something we feel is meaningful, as it is happening. I suspect, in practice, live may be a way to show your face that in fact removes the necessity of importance or significance or care to edit or think something out.

RELATED: Being Bubba “To be back home…my mom works in the candy shop,” he said. “The excitement around these businesses, the city of Pensacola realizes I love them. They brought me everything I have now. They took time to sponsor sporting events that I participated in. That’s the same thing I’m doing. I’m trying to help the community grow. “The first thing you do is some form of education. We talk inner city. It’s where the most growth can happen, no matter what background you are. But it all starts with education.” Sounds like the beginnings of a stump speech. There is a precedent to a tour player becoming a mayor. Rocky Thompson, who won three Senior PGA Tour events, was the mayor of Toco, Texas, in the '90s.",

Facebook confirmed Wiseman’s exit to CNET. \nThe six-year Facebook veteran is joining the philanthropic-focused venture capital firm Social+Capital as an entrepreneur-in-residence. \nWiseman started at Facebook as an engineer in 2007 after intern stints at Apple and Pixar. Over the years, he climbed the ranks to manage some of the social network’s most significant product releases, including Facebook Timeline. According to his LinkedIn profile, Wiseman also managed releases for Facebook flagship products such as photos, video, and chat. \n“I’ve sort of developed a desire to work on a more tangible social problem — like the health care industry — that I don’t think Facebook necessarily plans to tackle in the near term,” Wiseman told AllThingsD.",

      "text": "Like Us On Facebook \nI’ve studied astrology for about 15 years. \nI don’t remember what inspired my interest, other than a drug and alcohol addiction I was in full denial about and a vague desire to know what was wrong with me. \nWhen I got sober, I had no television, and Netflix didn’t exist yet. So, I read books. \nThey were astrology books to be specific because newly sober people are self-absorbed, and I wanted to read about myself. Giphy \nLuckily, all that time studying my own astrological birth chart filled me with enough meaningless knowledge on the subject to share everything you’ll need to know about interpreting your own. \nSo for any interested parties, here’s the basic run-down of what to look for, from the best sites to find a free chart to the basics of how to read it. Birth chart info \nFirst off, if you’re going to teach yourself astrology, you’re going to need all your birth information. \nThis includes the exact time of your birth (within the half hour), the city, the state and the date. \nThe exact time is usually the most important, and it would be best to verify it on your birth certificate, since a parent can have faulty memory. \nOnce you have your birth information, you can go to any number of sites on the internet, but my personal favorites are Astrodienst or Cafe Astrology , and both sites offer a free astrology chart. \nGot that? \nRegardless of the site you use, your birth chart will look something like this: Elite Daily \nI know it looks confusing AF, but it’s easier to break down than you think. \nThe only things you need to keep an eye on for a basic reading of your astrology are these three planets and their corresponding signs: Sun, Moon and (at the very bottom in bold) the Ascendent, also known as your rising sign. Sun signs \nThe Sun is the part of your chart that you most likely already know. It’s the sign you look for when you’re searching for your horoscope, and it’s determined by the day of your birth. Elite Daily \nPisces are known for being highly creative, prone to delusion and easily seduced, and all those things are true about me. \nBut, Pisces are also described as being shy, quiet and non-judgmental. \nSure, there are moments when I’m the shy one in the corner at the party (or when I see someone crying uncontrollably in public and I completely get where they’re coming from), but those are not consistent characteristics of my personality. \nSo, I don’t always identify with the description of a Pisces. \nIf there are characteristics of your Sun sign that you feel don’t describe you at all, I’m about to explain why. Moon sign \nThe Moon sign in your chart is determined by the place of your birth. \nWhen interpreted in the chart, the Moon (and the sign that corresponds to it) describes your inner self, the way you process emotions, your relationship to your mother and your subconscious thoughts. Elite Daily \nMy Moon sign is Virgo, which is known for being highly critical, perfectionist and logical to a fault. \nNow that I know these characteristics of Virgo, how does this change/add dimension to the qualities of my Sun sign? \nWell, for one thing, it removes the quality of being non-judgmental. \nWhile I’m very accepting of people’s faults (a Piscean quality), I’m also highly judgmental of them (a Virgoan quality). \nIn other words, I’ll accept that you’re an emotional mess, but you’ll also disgust me. This is why I can only be friends with people who are working to improve themselves. \nHopefully you’re starting to see by now that an astrology chart is as nuanced as your personality is. \nThese charts aren’t meant to give you a black-and-white description of who you are; they’re simply meant to serve as a map through those nuances of your persona. Ascendant (your “rising” sign) \nIf you scan down to the bottom of your chart, you’ll see the Ascendant. \nThe Ascendant is determined by the exact time of your birth, and in my chart, it corresponds to the sign of Taurus. Elite Daily \nThe Ascendant, also known as your rising sign, is the First House of your chart and has to do with your outward expression of self. \nIf you were to ask an acquaintance to describe your personality in a few short words, that person will most likely describe the characteristics of your rising sign or Ascendant. \nThe rising sign is a description of your outer surface characteristics. \nTo use my own chart as an example, Taurus is described as being down-to-earth, level-headed, reliable, practical and independent. \nThis is a far cry from the flaky, zoned-out characteristics of a Pisces. \nSo, while a casual friend might describe me as level-headed and practical, someone who knows me better might describe someone who sounds like they have Alzheimer’s disease because the truth is, I leave my keys in the freezer several times a week and am known for getting lost in my own neighborhood while walking the dogs. \nWhat can I say? I’m a walking contradiction. Wrapping up \nWhen you’re looking at these three aspects of your chart — the Ascendant sign, Sun sign and Moon sign — look up the characteristics of each sign and apply them accordingly. \nTo use the example of an onion, your Ascendent sign is the outer layer, your Sun sign is what’s underneath it and your Moon sign is the deepest layer, the one that makes you cry. \nThere’s so much more to learn, but your Sun, Moon and Ascendent signs are like understanding the ABCs of astrology. \nKnowing these things are a great introduction to anyone who wants to dip their toes in the water. \nIf you’re interested in learning more, check out the sites I referenced above and look into the meaning of Venus and Mars in the astrology chart. \nHint: Venus and Mars is where your chart gets sexy.

      "text": "Profit From Buying Into Facebook's Recent Weakness Nov.22.16 \nFacebook is around 12% off its all-time high, reached earlier in October. \nA slowing ad load growth rate has investors worried about future revenue growth. \nAd load is not the only driver of growth. Facebook will be able to maintain growth and investors should use the short-term weakness to buy the stock. \nLike many technology stocks, Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ) has taken a beating in the last month. The tech sector has been hit as funds are shifting into industrials, banks and biotech. However, Facebook seems to have suffered an even larger loss, dropping a little over 12% since late October. This article will investigate this exacerbated drop to see what caused it and if it's worth buying into. \nDespite the heavy media coverage, the selling pressure is not a result of fake news on the platform. Let's be real, people don't use Facebook as a research journal. Even so, Facebook already has a plan to combat the spread of these articles. Due to their success in combating ad blockers (18% ad growth in desktop), I'm sure Facebook will be able to algorithmically solve the issue of fake news. Inflated metrics could have some effect, but I believe the overall transparency in handling the matter should actually bolster confidence in Facebook's product over the long run. \nThe real reason Facebook lost around $40 billion in market cap over the last month has to do with one paragraph in its earnings report. Regarding future revenue projections David Wehner remarked that \"we continue to expect that ad load will play a less significant factor driving revenue growth after mid-2017…Ad load has been one of the three primary factors fueling that growth…we expect to see ad revenue growth rates come down meaningfully.\" \nFor a company trading at a PE of around 45, this warning on revenue growth caused the drop to current levels. While the slowing down of ad load was known, it still leaves future growth prospects uncertain. One of the only things the market dislikes more than bad news is uncertainty. However, investors should see the big picture at Facebook and realize that revenue growth isn't as uncertain as it may seem. \nAd load is just one of three primary growth drivers. The other two are DAUs and time spent by each user. Together, these three factors are driving advertising revenue growth. As you can see from the chart below, the pace that Facebook is adding DAUs is stable. Despite its already massive size, Facebook tacked on an additional 51 million DAUs in Q3 . \nClick to enlarge \nNext in the equation is time. By the last report, the average user spends 50 minutes of their day on any one of Facebook's platforms. This is another number that has been steadily increasing. And while there is a limit on the amount of time a person can devote to social media, I believe that limit has yet to be reached with Facebook. The continuing shift to video content and live broadcasting should keep users engaged and entertained for a larger portion of time. Just today , Instagram introduced the ability to \"go live.\" \nSo we can see that ad load is not the only lever Facebook can pull to drive growth. Secondly, the basic rules of supply and demand will help Facebook in regards to its ad prices. As it stands now, there are 4 million advertisers on Facebook. However, there are 60 million businesses that have pages but are not yet advertising. As the supply of ads stabilizes, demand will increase in accordance with more businesses signing on. As a result, Facebook will have the power to charge more for their advertisement spots. \nFinal Thoughts \nFacebook's core growth engine is not limited solely to ad load growth. Its other drivers are intact and higher ad prices will help offset the issue of slowing growth. Facebook's management team is fully in control of the situation. This is not something that has surprised them as the warned about it in Q2 as well. The team around Zuckerberg has had time to figure out a solution, and if past performance is any indicator, their execution should be near flawless. \nPast Facebook, the growth drivers of the future are bountiful. Oculus Rift has the chance to be the next computing platform. Instagram is growing quickly and working to stamp out rival Snapchat (Private: CHAT ). Facebook purchased each WhatsApp user for $42 . That's more than the $30 that they paid for each Instagram user, which should signal how valuable WhatsApp will be down the line. The company also has $6 billion cash on hand, which enables them the ability to invest, pivot, return cash to shareholders, or whatever business option they see fit. \nClick to enlarge \nFacebook is still on its upward technical trend, as you can see above in the chart from finviz.com. The trend was just reconfirmed as the stock bounced over 4% off the bottom of its trend line today. Despite this large one-day gain, Facebook should continue its upward trajectory. \nAuthor's Note: I encourage you to follow me as I cover a wide variety of current topics, with a special interest in the technology, retail, and entertainment industries.

      "text": "Rep. Peter Roskam (R-IL 6th District). Photo: Facebook.\nThe Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement is an “insidious” phenomenon that must be tackled head-on, an Illinois congressman who co-authored a new anti-BDS bill told The Algemeiner on Monday.\n“It’s unfair and it’s gratuitous,” Republican Peter Roskam said of the BDS movement. “And I think that there is recognition in Congress that a strong Israel is good for the United States, and we want a strong and stable partner in the Middle East. So we want to do everything we can to protect Israel.”\nEarlier this month, Roskam and Democrat Juan Vargas of California introduced the “Protecting Israel Against Economic Discrimination Act” — the purpose of which, according to its text, is to “amend the Export Administration Act of 1979 to include in the prohibitions on boycotts against allies of the United States boycotts fostered by international governmental organizations against Israel and to direct the Export-Import Bank of the United States to oppose boycotts against Israel.” This is a companion bill to legislation introduced in the Senate in September by Republican Rob Portman of Ohio and Democrat Ben Cardin of Maryland.\n 2:12 pm 0 Iranian Navy Boasts, Broadcasts Entry of Warships Into Atlantic Ocean Following the announcement by the commander of the Iranian Navy that two Islamic Republic warships had entered the Atlantic Ocean,...\nThe legislative push, Roskam told The Algemeiner , was prompted by the UN Human Rights Council’s decision in March to set up a database of Israeli companies operating in the West Bank.\n“We were successful [in 2015] in amending the US trade statute to make it a stated trading objective of the United States to push back against BDS,” Roskam said. “But now some of the activity has moved to these international governmental organizations, and this bill is basically a technical fix to address where the debate has shifted to…It more broadly defines what boycott, divestment and sanctions against Israel means, to include international governmental organizations that fall out of the typical categories.”\nA statement released by Roskam’s office when the bill was unveiled last week said, “The ‘Protecting Israel Against Economic Discrimination Act’ puts Congress on the record opposing the UNHRC resolution and other attempts to economically harm and delegitimize Israel. This legislation also requires the Export-Import Bank to consider BDS activity when evaluating potential applicants. US taxpayer-backed financing should not be available to those who choose to conduct economic warfare against Israel.”\nRoskam — who was re-elected two weeks ago to a sixth term in the House of Representatives — explained why he thinks there is “overwhelming” bipartisan support in Congress for the fight against BDS. “I mean, good grief, you got one nation that is held to a standard by which nobody else is held to,” he said.\nAsked about the prospects of his new bill becoming approved, Roskam replied, “Based on past experience, it’s more likely true than not true that this gets signed into law…It could either be signed into law as a stand-alone piece of legislation, or it could be included in a larger package as an amendment of some sort. But it is very much in line with the direction Congress has gone in the past. We’re not breaking new ground. We’re just kind of completing this.”\nFurthermore, Roskam noted, “When I’ve spoken to Israeli leaders about BDS, there’s an urgency, there’s a real concern that this is not something to be dismissive of…If you don’t attend to these things when they are brought to your attention, nothing good happens.”\nLooking ahead to the future of US-Israel relations after Donald Trump becomes president in January, Roskam said, “I think our ties are going to change and be much more positive. I think that the backhanded nature of the Obama administration’s treatment of Israel and the pressure on Israel to bid against itself vis-a-vis the Palestinian question are going to go away, and the Trump administration is likely to be much more forward-leaning in its vocal support for Israel.”",

Photo: Facebook.\nJNS.org – Israeli government members and their deputies may not contact US President-elect Donald Trump without receiving a green light from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office, the prime minister announced Monday in a directive sent to all ministries.\n“As per the instructions of the prime minister, cabinet ministers and deputy ministers are hereby informed that they may not make contact with the president-elect without getting the necessary approval from the Prime Minister’s Office or the Israeli Embassy in the United States,” Israeli Cabinet Secretary Tzachi Braverman wrote.\nEarlier this month, Netanyahu asked ministers not to comment on the incoming American administration, but Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman chose to speak publicly about Israel’s relations with the future president, expressing hope that the two sides would be able to reach an understanding over settlement construction in the West Bank. Other ministers, including Education Minister Naftali Bennett (Jewish Home), also said they would like to meet or speak with members of Trump’s team.",

      "text": "If this router is open, Facebook could help you find it. Photo by Josh Miller/CNET \nFacebook has begun testing a feature that lets you find nearby open Wi-Fi networks through its iOS app , a Facebook spokesperson confirmed to CNET. \nThe feature is still in early testing, and it's only available for iOS and only in select countries. To see if you have it, tap the menu icon in the bottom left corner of the app. Then, scroll down until you see \"Find Wi-Fi.\" If you want to use the feature, hit the tab and then choose \"Enable Find Wi-Fi.\" From there you can browse free and public Wi-Fi networks nearby. Not all users have the feature yet, so don't be confused if you can't find it in the settings. \nThe free Wi-Fi program is one of many examples of Facebook trying to help more people using the internet -- and therefore use Facebook itself. Although Facebook has sent out drones and satellites to give internet access to more remote locations, the nearby Wi-Fi feature is more of an urban solution. Facebook previously had a program that exchanged Wi-Fi access for Facebook check-ins at local businesses. \nAlso keep in mind that open networks are riskier to use than password-protected ones, so make sure you know how to stay safe .

      "text": "(Before It's News)\nMost people who use social media have figured out that Facebook and Google are in cahoots with the government, for those who are well aware of the issues it’s high time you switched over to Seen.life . It is a website that is similar to Facebook but without all the censorship.\nThe break-up of the United States into smaller republics is an unfolding story. I am shocked and dismayed at the rapidity of the decay of America. This article is not meant to provide an in-depth analysis of the six smaller republics that will emerge from a collapsed America. In fact, this story is so fluid, that it is very likely that the US will be comprised of several more and smaller republics before it is all said and done.\nThe purpose of this article, is to expose the existence of these six movements accompanied by a brief descriptionof the motivation behind each republic. In later articles, I will prepare a more in-depth analysis of this issue as I examine each emerging republic in a case by case basis.\nThe areas of interest are Reconquista movement (i.e. reclaiming the American southwest and points beyond and returning them to Mexico. Also included is Calexit, which is Governor Jerry Brown’s plan to exit America. Oregon and Washington have been approached about joining with Canada. The northern region of California and the Southern region of Oregon is forming the 51st state of Jefferson. According to local officials, the completion of Jefferson will be complete within 12 months.\nLa Raza: Reclaiming the Southwest\nEuropeans go home! Whites not allowed! These are the battle cries of a movement designed to recapture lost Mexican territory as a result of the Mexican War. Now there is a decided effort to return the previously ill-gotten land and our top governmental officials think that this is a good idea/\nOne has to look no further than S. 744, sponsored by John McCain at the behest of President Obama, to realize that the passage of this bill would have meant the end of a sovereign America. And now, Obama is promising to accomplish the same with the stroke of his Executive Order (EO) pen. Just what will that mean for the American people when Obama takes the law into his hands?\nPerhaps America’s greatest domestic strength lies in taking in immigrants and assimilating them into our country as Americans. However, what Obama wants and is in the midst of doing is nowhere near what we bargained for as a nation. There are two groups who have repeatedly called for the seizure of several states and make them into an independent country, and these two groups are La Raza and MEChA. The concept of Aztlan has been sanctioned by the UN. This is the same UN that is transporting military grade vehicles within the United States.\nThese groups have historically taught that Colorado, California, Arizona, Texas, Utah, New Mexico, Oregon and parts of Washington State make up an area known as “Aztlan”, a fictional ancestral homeland of the Aztecs before Europeans arrived in North America.\nMEChA’s founding principles are contained in these words in “El Plan Espiritual de Aztlan” (The Spiritual Plan for Aztlan):\n“In the spirit of a new people that is conscious not only of its proud historical heritage but also of the brutal gringo invasion of our territories, we, the Chicano inhabitants and civilizers of the northern land of Aztlan from whence came our forefathers, reclaiming the land of their birth and consecrating the determination of our people of the sun, declare that the call of our blood is our power, our responsibility, and our inevitable destiny. … Aztlan belongs to those who plant the seeds, water the fields, and gather the crops and not to the foreign Europeans. … We are a bronze people with a bronze culture. Before the world, before all of North America, before all our brothers in the bronze continent, we are a nation, we are a union of free pueblos, we are Aztlan. For La Raza todo. Fuera de La Raza nada. Chicano is our identity; it defines who we are as people. It rejects the notion that we…should assimilate into the Anglo-American melting pot…Aztlan was the legendary homeland of the Aztecas … It became synonymous with the vast territories of the Southwest, brutally stolen from a Mexican people marginalized and betrayed by the hostile custodians of the Manifest Destiny.” (Statement on University of Oregon MEChA Website, Jan. 3, 2006).\nMiguel Perez of the Cal State-Northridge’s MEChA chapter stated: “The ultimate ideology is the liberation of Aztlan. Communism would be closest [to it]. Once Aztlan is established, ethnic cleansing would commence: Non-Chicanos would have to be expelled — opposition groups would be quashed because you have to keep power.”\nThe National Council of La Raza and its allies in public office make no repudiation of the radical MEChA and its positions. As recently as 2003, La Raza was actively funding MEChA, according to federal tax records. However, since La Raza began to receive federal funds, La Raza has adopted a less militant stand, at least publicly, where they say that they no longer support Reconquista de Aztlan. However, when one examines where proposed federal money was designed to go, under S. 744, and to go in the pockets of La Raza and MEChA, it is impossible to believe that at its core, La Raza does not truly support the concept of Aztlan.\nWith McCain and Obama’s support, this movement is alive and well.\nNot Governor, but President Jerry Brown of the Republic of California\nThere is a strong movement to remove California from the United States and set up a new liberal republic is steadily gathering support.\nLeading campaigners for the Yes California independence campaign say that a breakaway from the United States is every bit as possible as the unlikely victories for Brexit and Trump.\nThe movement, formerly known as Sovereign California, borrowed its name and logo from the Yes Scotland campaign after the 2014 Scottish independence referendum.\nIn the face of a Trump win, could this hasten the planned departure? Without question a Trump presdiency will drive this liberal state out of the Union.\nI recently interviewed Paul Preston on this topic and what I learned is that the Bank of China is financially support Jerry Brown. Brown is also financing this move through drug trafficking. I have a source within the DEA which confirms most of Paul Preston claims. Drug trafficking in northern California (e.g. Fortuna) is rampant and al-Qaeda is working in conjunction with the Mexican drug cartels in this endeavor and part of the drug profits are going towards a “dark money” support of Calexit.\nIn Calexit, I am finding more corruption that I can shake a stick at. This issue will receive in depth attention at a future date.\nThe Great State of Jefferson\nAs many as 17 counties in Northern California and Southern Oregon are moving to secede/withdraw and join the state of Jefferson, the name of the intended 51st state. The movement has the support of local elected officials who are tired of the EPA trying to create dead zones of ranching and farming in this area. Once thought to be a pipe-dream, it looks as this may become a reality.\nPost World War III Courtesy of the UN\n The above map is the UN plan to divide America in the event of a World III gone bad for the United States in which America is carved up like the proverbial Thanksgiving turkey.\nCanada Wants to Annex the\nBest Coast” All three states on the Pacific coast voted for Hillary Clinton. The election of Donald Trump has spurred discussion about all three states leaving the United States and being annexed by, believe it or not, Canada.\nFrom the Seattle Times :\n“The #calexit movement, formed in response to Donald Trump winning the presidential election, has enveloped California’s West Coast neighbors and spiritual counterparts, Washington and Oregon. The three Pacific Coast states overwhelmingly voted for Hillary Clinton. She received 55 percent of the vote in Washington, 62 percent in California and 52 percent in Oregon.\nIs this crazy talk? Probably. But residents of the Best Coast have a lot in common with our northern neighbors. The three states have long been working with British Columbia to combat climate change . All three new potential provinces have legalized cannabis, which Canada is moving toward . Don’t forget Canada’s universal health care…”\nIt appears that Calexit will take California out of this proposal and the Canadians have modified their proposal to include just Oregon and Washington. The Canadian government sent 150 maple trees to Oregon and California as an enticement to follow through.\nG. Edward Griffin and Various Native American Tribes I was recently interviewing the G. Edward Griffin regarding a global warming conference he is hosting in Phoenix from December 2-4. In the course of the interview, Ed revealed that there is a plan to break up the United States by using inherent Native American dissatisfaction. This is a work in progress and more details will be forthcoming.\nConclusion It is hard to believe that these movements are not orchestrated. Trump was just elected and in the short time since, movements like Calexit could not have been implemented in that time.\nIt also very curious that the American entertainment industry is dominated by this theme.

It is a website that is similar to Facebook but without all the censorship. The World In 2017 According To Rothschild’s ‘The Economist’ – Analysis by Benjamin Fulford, David Wilcock, with Commentary from AscensionWithEarth.Com\nNovember 21, 2016\nAscensionWithEarth.com\nThe Economist magazine, owned and operated by the Rothschild clan, is known for putting out hidden messages in its cover art work and other media publications. Just in case you missed the past few years, here are the cover art for “THE WORLD IN XXXX” series, 2016 source link , 2015 source link , 2014 source link , 2013 source link . You may also want take a look at the AscensionWithEarth.com analysis of a dark and sinister media publication from The Economist Instagram feed, titled “ The Economist Magazine Puts Another Cryptic Message “666 & Illuminati Owl “.\nThe Economist magazine once again has released another cryptic message on its cover using classic occult symbology by means of a tarot card deck. Tarot cards are used as a divination tool and are used gain insight into the past, present, and future. There are many types of tarot decks but common occult tarot decks consist of 78 cards divided into two parts, with 22 cards associated with the Major Arcana and remaining 56 cards relates to the Minor Arcana part of the deck. The Economist uses their own artistic interpretation of the Major Arcana cards. Looking at the front cover of ‘ THE WORLD IN 2017 ‘, you will notice that they have selected 8 cards from the Major Arcana tarot deck and laid them out on top of an image depicting the cosmic space of the Universe. Many say that Space exploration is the “Final Frontier” for human kind, but I suggest that the “Final Frontier” is actually understanding and knowing who you truly are. Knowing YOURSELF is the final frontier, but I digress.\nI am not a Tarot card expert in any sense and do not know if the position of the cards play a role in the interpretation and meanings of the cards. With that said they are positioned starting with THE TOWER card, JUDGEMENT card is next, followed by THE WORLD, THE HERMIT, DEATH, THE MAGICIAN, WHEEL OF FORTUNE, THE STAR. I have taken screen shots of each card from The Economist tarot deck and included interpretations from multiple sources including Benjamin Fulford, David Wilcock, Tarot expert James Rioux, and a website called BiddyTarot.com. I have also included a few personal observation notes for your consideration.\nThe Tower Card\nBenjamin Fulford: “The first card, called “the tower,” shows the Catholic Church being split between its communist and traditional Christian factions.” Source Link\nDavid Wilcock: “ First, the Tower card is the Tower of Destruction, and symbolizes the fall of corrupt kings and queens. The Vatican is the spiritual center of the Cabal. This therefore refers to the destruction of the Cabal itself.” Source Link\nJames Rioux: (General Meaning) “When a building is old and decrepit, it must be demolished so that a new structure may stand in its place. The same is true of the symbolic Tower. When old attitudes and beliefs are outdated, you will have to let go of them, whether you like it or not.” Source Link\nBiddyTarot.com: (General Meaning) “When you see the Tower in a reading, you may feel afraid, shaken and insecure. It is a time of great turmoil and destruction as you seek to understand how you could have been so wrong, so naive, or so blind about a particularly situation. And now, what will you do and how will you manage in the face of this shocking truth? It is often descriptive of a major upheaval, disruption, emergency or crisis, and is likely to bring chaos in the aftermath of such an event. The most important aspect of the Tower is that with any destruction there comes creation. Thus, the Tower card represents an awakening and is about inspiration, freedom, reality and the release from bondage. It is a truth and honesty card that comes as a bolt of lightning to you through a shocking and impactful life event. ” Source Link\nAscensionWithEarth: The first card placed on this magazine cover should send the most vivid and powerful message. Seeing imagery of the Vatican Church crumbling to the ground does bring into question as to what is about to be disclosed to the public. One would think that the global Satanic Pedophilia network linked to the Vatican church is about to be come to an end. Remember back in 2014 when the Pope delivered a shocking message to the world stating that 2% of Catholic Priests are pedophiles ? I’m am sure that number is much higher than claimed but at least that was a significant acknowledgement to the satanic powers that permeate throughout the Vatican network.\nThe Judgment Card Benjamin Fulford: The second, called “Judgement” shows Donald Trump holding the symbols of power, meaning most likely they expect a Nuremberg type tribunal to be convened when he assumes office. Source Link\nDavid Wilcock: Secondly, the image of Trump on the Judgment card is a very clear homage to classic art of Christ sitting on the planet. This therefore is a mockery of elements of the public seeing Trump not only as their leader, but as a savior figure. Source Link\nJames Rioux: (General Meaning) Judgement is also a card of cleansing, representing a time where your slate is wiped clean and you can start over, with all your debts taken care of and with nothing to worry about. This may seem too good to be true, and for a lot of people it is, because they ruin their new chance with thoughts of the mistakes they made in the past. Source Link\nBiddyTarot.com: (General Meaning) The Judgement card suggests that you have had a recent epiphany or an ‘awakening’ where you have come to a realization that you need to live your life in a different way and you need to be true to yourself and your needs. Source Link\nAscensionWithEarth: Note that the JUDGEMENT card is tilted to the left and actually touches three other tarot cards. JUDGEMENT is touching the THE TOWER, THE WORLD, THE MAGICIAN. Is there a deeper meaning to this insignificant detail? The JUDGEMENT card along with the STAR card are the only two cards that are tilted. All other cards are perfectly centered.\nThe World Card Benjamin Fulford: The third, called “the World” shows symbols of the Gnostic Illuminati, the family owned central banks and monotheism unified under what appears to be a moon god. Above them are what appear to be Maria (the Goddess Isis), the holy book and the sun god. It seems they think the world will be unified under these symbols. Source Link\nDavid Wilcock: (No Explanation)\nJames Rioux: (General Meaning) After every obstacle has been faced and surmounted, after every path has been travelled and charted, there remains only the last step to the next level of existence – the World, the final gateway. Source Link\nBiddyTarot.com: (General Meaning) The World signifies completion, achievement and fulfillment. All of your efforts are finally paying off and you have reached the end of a journey or have completed a major life cycle. You have endured hardships and challenges along the way but these have only made you stronger and significantly wiser and more experienced than when you first started on your journey. Source Link\nAscensionWithEarth: Notice the three buildings sitting on top of the globe/map? Do these represent the three city-states of the world which are known to be controlled by the New World Order/Illuminati. Washington D.C., London, Vatican?\nThe Hermit Card Benjamin Fulford: The fourth called “the Hermit” shows North America leading a populist movement against TPP, TTIP and the EU, indicating they have gone against their “globalist” agenda. Source Link\nDavid Wilcock: (No Explanation)\nJames Rioux: (General Meaning) The appearance of the Hermit is a call to learn more about yourself and the nature of your existence, and everyone experiences this call at some point in their lives. Take this as a sign that your worldly problems and affairs can safely be put on hold; there is greater, inner work to be done now. Often this will refer to a problem you must solve or a part of your nature you must deal with before a situation can progress. Only in rare circumstances will this refer to a spiritual transformation, but when it does, know that it will be a powerful change requiring much effort and commitment. A more long-term withdrawal may be needed. Source Link\nBiddyTarot.com: (General Meaning) The Hermit Tarot card suggests that you are in a phase of introspection where you are drawing your attention and focus inward and looking for answers within. You have a strong need to understand, not just at the surface level but to really know why life is the way it is. The Hermit reflects that your consciousness has moved inward and you now realise that the truth and understanding you seek is within yourself and not in the distractions of the outside world. Source Link\nAscensionWithEarth: (No Explanation)\nThe Death Card Benjamin Fulford: The fifth, called “death,” shows plagues, tsunamis, fish die-offs, nuclear weapons and crop failures and is probably meant as a threat by the bloodline families to unleash these calamities if they are cornered. Source Link\nDavid Wilcock: (No Explanation)\nJames Rioux: (General Meaning) Death is one of the most powerful cards in the Tarot. When the Death card appears, big changes are heading your way. It has been said many times by many readers: the Death card is not a card of death – it is a card of transformation. Source Link\nBiddyTarot.com: (General Meaning) Death is symbolic of the ending of a major phase or aspect of your life that may bring about the beginning of something far more valuable and important. Similarly, Death indicates a time of significant transformation, change and transition. Source Link\nAscensionWithEarth: (No Explanation)\nThe Magician Card Benjamin Fulford: The sixth, called “the magician,” seems to indicate they expect 3d printing and virtual reality to be the biggest high tech trends of the year. Source Link\nDavid Wilcock: (No Explanation)\nJames Rioux: (General Meaning) The Magician’s number is One, the number of creation and individuality; his power is transformation through the use of his will. When the Magician appears he shows that you are ready to become a conduit for power, like he is. The forces of creation and destruction have always been at your command but now you have the wisdom and confidence needed to use them constructively. Source Link\nBiddyTarot.com: (General Meaning) The Magician Tarot card typically appears in a Tarot reading at a time in your life when you have the creative power and energy to create a new life cycle for yourself. You have the ability to take the power of the Universe and manifest your desires. The Magician Tarot card suggests that a situation has been (or soon will be) presented to you that has all the inherent components to allow the manifestation of your desires. Those desires may be spiritual (fire), physical (earth), emotional (water), or mental (air), and are each aligned with the four elements of the Tarot. You have the ability to make it happen! Source Link\nAscensionWithEarth: Some say THE MAGICIAN card represents the force that links the spirit worlds to the physical worlds via the magician who has the power to create what he/she desires. You can see that Virtual Reality and 3D printing are suggested as the top level theme for the coming industry boom associated with these new technologies. I also see another level being displayed, that of promoting and manifesting Artificial Intelligence and Transhumanism. VR, 3D Printing, and Transhumanism is the AI attempt to harvest and capture the organic nature of reality. The AI wants to become a creator so in essence will do everything possible to learn and become that of which it wants to mimic. People will become more focused on technology diverting the creational power “outside” of themselves for answers when they should be looking “inside” and discovering their divine nature of infinite potential.\nThe Wheel of Fortune Card\nBenjamin Fulford: The seventh, called the “Wheel of Fortune” shows a smiling Marine Le Pen and a frowning Angela Merkel waiting for the results of elections indicating they expect Le Pen to win and Merkel to lose. This writer could not identify the third person. Source Link\nDavid Wilcock: (No Explanation)\nJames Rioux: (General Meaning) The wheel is an apt symbol for the forces of Destiny and Fate because it shows how everything is connected in a cycle; some might call it the circle of life. The appearance of the Wheel of Fortune shows that change is not only likely to happen, it is certain to happen, and soon. Source Link\nBiddyTarot.com: (General Meaning) The lesson of the Wheel of Fortune is that you must accept that there are always ups and downs in life. The Wheel represents karma and reminds you that ‘what goes around comes around’. The Wheel of Fortune speaks of a pivotal point in your life, where new options become possible. The appearance of the Wheel of Fortune shows that change is not only likely to happen, it is certain to happen, and soon. Source Link\nAscensionWithEarth: (No Explanation)\nThe Star Card Benjamin Fulford: The final one, “the star,” seems to show pictures of pop culture personalities who will have strong financial backing during the year. The only one this pop culture knowledge deficient writer could identify appears to be Lady Gaga. Source Link\nDavid Wilcock: (No Explanation)\nJames Rioux: (General Meaning) There are few cards more positive than the Star, because when it appears in your life it is nothing less than a beacon of hope and inspiration. This is a time when miracles can happen, so kick off your shoes and wade into the pool, confident that the water will support you until you reach the other side. Source Link\nBiddyTarot.com: (General Meaning) The Star Tarot card brings renewed hope and faith and a sense that you are truly blessed by the Universe at this time. Courage, fulfilment, and inspiration are in your life. The Star Tarot card also indicates a generous spirit. You want to give or share your wealth with others to help transform their own lives. You have an open heart and you now want to give back the blessings you have already received so that others may benefit. Source Link\nAscensionWithEarth: The JUDGEMENT card along with the STAR card are the only two cards that are tilted. All other cards are perfectly centered. You can notice a faint portrait of individual people inside the center of the star. The STAR card is also touching two cards, THE HERMIT and THE WHEEL OF FORTUNE.\nConclusion Just so you can get a better grip and understanding about the Rothschild mindset of the past, here are two of their most famous Quote: s.\nMayer Amschel Rothschild:\n“Give me control of a nation’s money and I care not who makes the laws.”\nBaron Nathan Mayer Rothschild:\n“I care not what puppet is placed on the throne of England to rule the Empire, …The man that controls Britain’s money supply controls the British Empire. And I control the money supply.”\nI am sure many will spend time trying to interpret these images and messages coming from the infamous Rothschild dynasty. Whether or not these messages from the Rothschild/New World Order/ show them admitting defeat or just another psy-op to keep the public masses confused and suppressed in 2017, we the people of this world need to wake up and reclaim our power. The power of the human soul holds no limits, so let us join together and tap this infinite source to manifest a reality that emanates love for all within this divine creation.\nwww.ascensionwithearth.com\nhttp://www.ascensionwithearth.com/2016/11/the-world-in-2017-according-to.html",

      "text": "(Before It's News)\nMost people who use social media have figured out that Facebook and Google are in cahoots with the government, for those who are well aware of the issues it’s high time you switched over to Seen.life . It is a website that is similar to Facebook but without all the censorship.\nTrump destroys media stars face to face in his golden tower\nby Jon Rappoport\nIt was instant legend.\nTrump met yesterday with the rancid cream of media in his golden tower. They were there thinking it was all about creating a structure for access to the next president. Little did they know.\nCharlie Rose was there. Wolf Blitzer. Jeff Zucker, head of CNN. Martha “I weep for Hillary” Raddatz. Gayle King. Lester “the weasel-king of interrupters” Holt. Chuck Todd. George “property of the Clintons” Stephanopoulos.\nFake, fake, fake, fake, fake.\nThe whole gang.\nThe NY Post has the story:\n“It was like a f–ing firing squad,” one source said of the encounter.\n“Trump started with [CNN chief] Jeff Zucker and said ‘I hate your network, everyone at CNN is a liar and you should be ashamed,’ ” the source said.\n“The meeting was a total disaster. The TV execs and anchors went in there thinking they would be discussing the access they would get to the Trump administration, but instead they got a Trump-style dressing down,” the source added.\n“Trump kept saying, ‘We’re in a room of liars, the deceitful dishonest media who got it all wrong.’ He addressed everyone in the room calling the media dishonest, deceitful liars. He called out Jeff Zucker by name and said everyone at CNN was a liar, and CNN was [a] network of liars,” the source said.\n“…he referred to a horrible network correspondent who cried when Hillary lost who [also] hosted a [presidential] debate – which was Martha Raddatz who was also in the room.”\nSo…You can hate Trump, but if you can’t find joy in this story, you’re in need of a blood transfusion.\nWay back at the beginning of the presidential campaign, I said that if Trump does nothing but run against the media he’ll be doing the country a great service, because they’re all snakes and cover-up artists and liars and they’ve been hypnotizing the population for as long as they’ve been around. Trump went on to exceed my expectations in that regard.\nIf you can’t stand Trump, you can fantasize about some other theoretical president who might have carried off his attacks on fake news as well, and with the same effect, but this is the man who did it. And yesterday was a landmark event in history.\nUnderstand that these grifters—because that’s what they are—believe they own the news and the truth, even as they’re making it up by the ton. They and their masters—six companies that control 90% of big media—dispense fake reality to the populace 24/7. And now…\nThey’re lost inside their own bubble. They’ve never felt this kind of fury from a president. They don’t know what to do.\nThey’ve got money, they’ve got arrogance, and they’ve got the airwaves, and it’s not enough.\nOf course they’re outraged, and of course they’ll continue doing whatever they can to undermine Trump, but they know he couldn’t care less that they’re deeply, deeply offended. Their little trick—“how dare you insult us”—won’t work. In fact, it’ll make things worse for them. Not long ago, one survey placed the public’s trust in media at 6%, which is about on the same level as the trust in public bathrooms in scuzzy bars by the railroad tracks next to mining camps in the 19th century.\nThese media honkers can stand in front of their mirrors and keep combing their hair and they can bring in new make-up people, and adjust the studio lighting and build new desks, and they can laugh and smile at cocktail parties and pretend they’re still in the ascendance, but they’re rapidly turning into laughingstocks, and the derision keeps building. If you feel sorry for them, your sympathy is grossly misplaced.\nThe final straw here is Steve Bannon, Trump’s new chief strategist and special counselor. The editor of Breitbart, Bannon recently stated in an interview: “The media bubble is the ultimate symbol of what’s wrong with this country. It’s just a circle of people talking to themselves who have no f—ing idea what’s going on. If The New York Times didn’t exist, CNN and MSNBC would be a test pattern. The Huffington Post and everything else is predicated on The New York Times. It’s a closed circle of information from which Hillary Clinton got all her information — and her confidence. That was our opening.”\nTrump is carrying out a sustained war against big media. He hasn’t stopped. There is no sign he will stop. He knows, and Bannon knows, that the public is fed up with mainstream media.\nThe unchallenged authority of The News has been cracked like an egg.\nYesterday, Trump doubled and tripled down.\nWake up and smell the singed hair and the sagging plastic surgery. The media stars are fading in their fake sky.\nMost people who use social media have figured out that Facebook and Google are in cahoots with the government, for those who are well aware of the issues it’s high time you switched over to Seen.life . It is a website that is similar to Facebook but without all the censorship.\nFiled under: Uncategorized Jon Rappoport has worked as a free-lance investigative reporter for over 30 years. http://nomorefakenews.com/",

      "text": "The era of \" fake news \" is upon us and it's time to reconsider the ways in which we consume information.\nAfter multiple media reports documented a severe rise in incorrect articles being shared on Facebook, the platform announced its plan to break the \"fake news\" cycle.\nFacebook's CEO Mark Zuckerberg wrote in a post on Saturday the company will introduce a number of measures to help with the infestation of fake news, including stronger detection, easier reporting tools, warnings and new advertising policies.\nSEE ALSO: It’s time to stop blaming Facebook for fake news\nDespite this action, the spreading of false news, which even caught President Obama's attention , should be a serious wake up call to start looking outside your News Feed for factual information.\nBeyond simply learning to identify fake news , there are also precautions you can take to quit relying on Facebook and distance yourself from phony articles all together.\nHere are some alternative resources to help you broaden your horizons:\nfeedly\nImage: screengrab/feedly\nIt may be a little old school, but the reader is not dead.\nThe news aggregator application is a solid way to personally organize and filter the news you want to receive from legit publications. The RSS reader allows users to conveniently follow their favorite websites in one place and to see a constantly refreshable stream of new publications in real-time.\nAlong with the option to group sites into personal, customizable feeds, feedly also gives users the ability to share collections with others so you can ensure your teammates, friends and social networks are receiving factual news as well.\nFlipboard\nImage: screengrab/flipboard\nMuch like feedly, Flipboard presents the latest news on world happenings, technology, entertainment, design, health and more. However, it presents your news to you in an aesthetically pleasing magazine format, which is nice because sometimes reading news can be depressing AF.\nIn addition to reading its list of trusted sources , you can use Flipboard to filter topics that matter most to you and catch up on trending news via \"The Daily Edition,\" which is composed of hand-picked articles by the editorial staff.\nApple News\nImage: mashable composite: screengrab/apple news\nApple lovers, rejoice. You already have access to breaking news at your fingertips on your Apple devices. Apple's news app allows you to consume content in a similar fashion to Flipboard, with several customization options along with a slew of topics you can favorite. You can enable mobile or email notifications and easily share article on the app with others.\nImage: mashable composite: screengrab/apple news\nPodcasts A homage to the good old fashioned days of listening to the radio, podcasts are the perfect way to catch up on the news on the go. Daily, weekly or monthly, news podcasts give you the opportunity to hear comments from experts, journalists and thoroughly-educated people on the latest in world happenings and politics after the news has had time to set in. The educational discussions might even help expand your view on opposing issues. Some essential recommendations include:\nBBC Global News Podcast\nNPR Politics Podcast\nKeepin' it 1600\n60 Minutes\nThe Run Up\nReveal\nSlate's Political Gabfest\nPBS NewsHour\nDecode DC\nOnline newsletters Once you identify your core trusted news sites, consider subscribing to newsletters to ensure you don't miss a beat.\nDaily newsletters such as theSkimm , The New York Times , Need 2 Know , The Quartz Daily Brief , NextDraft , and Politico Playbook will often offer brief summaries on the most important events of the day, which you can use to inspire your more in-depth searches.\nInstant news alerts\nImage: screengrab/App store\nPretend you are a reporter and get breaking news on your phone as soon as it happens.\nMobile apps like AP News and Breaking News will deliver the latest in local, national and global headlines wherever you are. Plus, with instant alerts you won't feel the need to constantly scroll through your social accounts to ensure you're not missing any huge happenings in the world.\nIf you really want to stay informed it's also worth going the extra mile to download apps from some of your go-to news sites and tinkering with their notification settings.\nReputable news sites There's no better way to search for accurate news than by visiting reputable news sites directly. With tricky domain names trying to confuse users and send them into the fake news machine, it's important to pay close attention to the URLs being shared on social media sites.\nFor instance, you might think you're clicking on content from nbc.com, but you are actually being directed to an nbc.com.co address. The easiest way to avoid the confusion is directly seeking out the source of your desired content, the official website. Groundbreaking.\nTwitter\nImage: screengrab/twitter\nLike Facebook, Twitter can easily fall prey to the sharing of fake articles. Let's be real, sometimes it can be a total swamp. But if you give the social platform a chance and adjust some settings it can be a great source for news. Just ask the huge number of journalists lurking in the feed.\nFirst, it's a good idea to block those pesky fake-news-sharing trolls. Making use of Twitter's new \"mute\" feature is your first step to success. The feature will prevent certain keywords, phrases and conversations from appearing in your notifications section.\nTwitter has also introduced several changes over the past few years that will make your experience with the platform cleaner, such as the ability to flag abusive tweets , create a safety council and introduce a quality filter . Twitter Moments and Twitter Lists, such as this list of New York Times journalists, can also help with news gathering.\nThough trending hashtags are not always reliable, you can use the overwhelming stream of information to stay up-to-date with your favorite news outlets and follow reporters, government officials and celebrities to receive direct, personal updates.\nIf you are just getting started, here are a few interesting people to follow:\nBrian Stelter , CNN\nMolly Ball , The Atlantic\nWesley Lowrey , The Washington Post\nSamantha Bee , Comedian/Canadian Sweetheart\nJoy Reid , MSNBC\nEmma Watson , Actress and UN Women Global Goodwill Ambassador\nTrevor Noah , Comedian\nShaun King , New York Daily News\nAndrew Kaczynski , CNN\nOlivia Nuzzi , The Daily Beast\nLin-Manuel Miranda, Actor, writer, rapper\nGood luck out there, everyone.\nBONUS: Who the hell unfollowed me?",

      "text": "Keeping your secrets safe on Amazon, Google, Facebook and Netflix By Kim Komando, Komando.com photo courtesy of SHUTTERSTOCK When a relationship gets serious, we start to share more of our lives. We borrow each other’s cars. We move in together. Inevitably, we start sharing each other’s technology and even our passwords. But your device says a lot about you: Your pastimes, your taste in music, your curiosities and the things you shop for. So how do you maintain your privacy online, even with the people who are closest to you? Here are a few simple tricks to help you keep your secrets under wraps. (Note: Apps and websites do not always work the same across all devices and operating systems. If something isn’t located in the menus precisely as I say, look around for a similar action.) Amazon Amazon tracks not only what you have purchased, but also what you have browsed. If you share an Amazon account, both can pose a major problem especially this time of year. The good news is that you can easily cover your tracks. To erase your browsing history, from your account settings, look for Personalization. Go to Personalized Content >> View and Manage Your Browsing History. Here, you have a few options. You can remove only certain items or all items as well as turn off browsing history so you never have this issue again. Let’s say you want to make it more difficult for someone to find out what you have ordered. Amazon will not completely delete your order history, but you can archive individual orders. Casual snoops will have a harder time seeing what you have purchased. From your account settings, go to Your Orders. Select the item you wish to hide and select Archive order. You can use the Amazon app as an additional holiday security measure. Suppose you have purchased a pair of shoes for your spouse, you’ve archived the order, and now you’re waiting for the package to arrive. But you’re receiving so many boxes this time of year, how do you know which delivery to open and wrap? With the Amazon app, you can scan the barcode on the box to immediately find out what’s inside. It works like a charm – unless your spouse has secretly ordered something for you! By the way, Amazon has added a slew of new benefits for Prime members from unlimited photo storage to free eBooks. Click here for seven Amazon Prime perks you’re probably not using. Google Google often auto-completes your search terms based on personal information, such as your location and previous searches. Anyone looking over your shoulder or borrowing your device might be surprised by the guesses Google makes. Google products that collect your information include Chrome, Google Maps and YouTube. To delete your search history on Google, you need a Google account. Just log in, go to My Activity, and remove items individually. Most browsers have a similarly easy way to delete your browsing history, and the controls tend to be in your browser’s preferences. Keep this in mind, especially if you’re researching something a little unusual. Facebook For many of us, Facebook is like a sprawling digital yearbook. Maybe you have a family computer, and you usually forget to log out of Facebook. Other people use the same computer, they stumble into your Facebook account, and they notice your conspicuous search history. Your significant other may wonder why you’ve become so curious about the person you once invited to the prom, no matter how innocent your interest. The easiest way to avoid an awkward conversation is to open your Activity Log. Select More >> Search >> Clear Searches. Or you can remove each search item one by one. Your Facebook Activity Log stores a lot of data about you. Click here for tips to clean it up and prevent things from coming back to haunt you. Netflix We all have our guilty pleasures, especially when it comes to movies. You may have privately viewed Lars Von Trier’s \"Nymphomaniac\" and thought it was a great work of art-house cinema, but that could be hard to explain to a roomful of people. If you want to hide past screenings, just go to My Account >> Viewing History. Be advised that items aren’t always deleted immediately; it may take 24 hours for your lists to update on all devices. Netflix also allows you to create multiple profiles. Many households don’t bother with this unless they have children, but if you want to keep your viewing history private, you can create a personal profile and protect it with a password. Click here to learn how to do this as well as access secret Netflix categories. Go incognito Every major web browser including Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Internet Explorer, Safari and Opera has private, or incognito, browsing settings. Turning this feature on means your browser will ignore cookies including ad-tracking cookies and won't record your browsing history. It's almost like you were never online. Click here to learn how to enable this simple step to keep your browsing history a secret. Maintaining privacy is one of my favorite themes.

      "text": "  Progressive leaders are calling on Gov. McCrory to concede to Cooper. Facebook \nGov. Pat McCrory has formerly requested a statewide recount in the North Carolina ‘s governor’s race, as he trails his Democratic opponent Attorney General Roy Cooper by less than the 10,000 votes required to prevent it. \nThe votes are still being tallied and the McCrory camp said in a statement that they are aware the recount cannot happen until after that is done but wished to beat a deadline in the state. He is down by over 6,000 votes according to the State Board of Elections website . \nCooper, who has already named key members of his transition team and is claiming victory, tweeted out a statement from campaign manager Trey Nix, calling the move a “last-ditch effort from Governor McCrory to delay and deny the results of this election.” In response to Governor Pat McCrory’s request for a recount, Cooper for NC campaign manager Trey Nix released the following statement: pic.twitter.com/l0cnZDqYRK \n— Roy Cooper (@RoyCooperNC) November 22, 2016 \nMembers of Progress North Carolina, Equality NC and the Human Rights Campaign held rallies on Tuesday to tell Gov. Pat McCrory that it is time to move on. \nThe organization held two rallies calling on McCrory to concede to Cooper, one in Charlotte at the Government Center and one in Raleigh at the North Carolina Executive Mansion where McCrory resides. \nMcCrory has lodged complaints alleging voter fraud and previously asked for recounts in various counties. \nThere are also concerns that the Republican controlled North Carolina General Assembly could get involved in determining the outcome, which the state’s Constitution appears to allow. \n“I do think the likelihood [of the NCGA getting involved to determine the outcome of the election] is low at this point, but I have been surprised many times this year,” said Matt Hirschy, director of advancement at Equality NC. “And I am certainly never surprised at the bounds to which the General Assembly will go to do unconstitutional and crazy things. So while the North Carolina Constitution does provide a provision for them to step in and appoint a governor, I think they should let the people speak and let the rule of law in this election stand as it is.” \n“The number one message that we have is, Gov. McCrory, it is time to move on from this petty and partisian rhetoric that you’ve got around this poor excuse for trying to rig an election in your favor,” Hirschy said, adding that he is no longer needed in Raleigh and it is time to let Cooper take office. “McCrory needs to drop his filing for a recount and he needs to concede.” Matt Hirschy of @equalitync in Charlotte talks NC Gov. McCrory calling for a statewide recount. Asks him to #MoveOnMcCrory . pic.twitter.com/1CbWjHzqty \n— LGBTQ Nation (@lgbtqnation) November 23, 2016 \nWhile Republicans Donald Trump and Sen. Richard Burr managed to win in the state, McCrory saw his approval rating plummet after he signed anti-LGBTQ law House Bill 2 (HB2), costing the state thousands of jobs and millions of dollars and showing that going after the LGBTQ community can have electoral consequences. \nWatch the Progress NC, Equality NC, and HRC held rally in Charlotte, where McCrory was mayor before becoming governor, below.",

Post to Facebook Dak Prescott comments on throwing away trash Pick up your trash, people.  //usat.ly/2fPuLat   Join the Nation's Conversation   Dak Prescott comments on throwing away trash Alysha Tsuji , USA TODAY 7:16 p.m.   \nDallas Cowboys quarterback Dak Prescott (4) leaves the field after the game against the Baltimore Ravens at AT&T Stadium. Dallas won 27-17. (Photo: Tim Heitman-USA TODAY Sports) \nA video of Dak Prescott throwing away his water cup on Sunday has gone viral. \nPeople are amazed that Prescott picked up the cup after missing the garbage can on his first try. He easily could have left it there. Plenty of cups litter the field after games, and he didn't know anyone was watching him. But he did the right thing. It may seem small but this video says a lot about Dak Prescott. pic.twitter.com/kzUNRKP5bb — Arash Markazi (@ArashMarkazi) November 20, 2016 \nNow, we have the official comment from the Cowboys quarterback on what he thinks about this simple moment that fans have loved so much. Dak on viral video of picking up cup: More people need to pick up their trash if it was that big of a deal. I simply missed the garbage can. — Kate Hairopoulos (@khairopoulos) November 22, 2016 Prescott: Didn't think much of it. Get up & put trash were it belonged. On the miss: Still had some ice in it that messed up rotation. — Kate Hairopoulos (@khairopoulos) November 22, 2016 \nCowboys head coach Jason Garrett and team owner Jerry Jones have also commented on the viral video. \nGarrett told reporters that it shows Prescott is a neat freak, then added, \"I would say that's a positive story about Dak, yes.\" \nPer the Dallas News , Jones said: \n\"I'm proud of him for doing that,\" Jones said Tuesday on 105.3 The Fan's Shan and RJ show [KRLD-FM]. \"I'll bet you one thing, that mobile home he grew up in, it might have been modest, but I'll bet it was clean.\" \nThere you have it. Remember to always pick up your trash because Prescott says so, and because it's the right thing to do - even if no one's watching. Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2fPuLat Most Popular",

(Photo: Spike Mafford, Getty Images) \nTurkey and trimmings add up, but this year, the average cost of a Thanksgiving meal will be less than last year, according to the American Farm Bureau Federation. \nThe 2016 price for a traditional holiday feast is $49.87, down from last year’s $50.11. The calculation is based on feeding 10 people. \nThe classic shopping list the organization uses to calculate includes turkey, bread stuffing, sweet potatoes, rolls with butter, peas, cranberries, a vegetable tray, pumpkin pie with whipped cream, and coffee and milk. And yes, they factor in having lots of leftovers. Thanksgiving recipes Hasselback Yukon Gold Potatoes \nBut if cooks adjust for inflation, the total is $20.66, which is the lowest amount since 2010, the American Farm Bureau Federation calculated. \nThe marquee menu item, the turkey, will cost an estimated $22.74 for a 16-pounder, down 30 cents from 2015. Also decreasing are the costs for a 30-ounce can of pumpkin pie mix ($3.13, down 7 cents), one gallon of whole milk ($3.17, down 8 cents), a one-pound relish tray of carrots and celery ($0.73, down 6 cents) and miscellaneous ingredients, like butter, evaporated milk, onions, eggs, sugar and flour ($2.81, down 37 cents). \n►Related: Spice up the Thanksgiving bird and give spuds a twist \nOn the other side of the delicious balance sheet are foods that cost more than last year -- a dozen brown-and-serve rolls ($2.46, up 21 cents), two nine-inch pie shells ($2.59, up 12 cents), one pound of green beans ($1.58, up 6 cents), 12 ounces of fresh cranberries ($2.39, up 10 cents), half a pint of whipping cream ($2.00, up 6 cents), 14 ounces of cubed bread ($2.67, up 6 cents) and three pounds of fresh sweet potatoes ($3.60, up 3 cents). \nWhen the organization first began calculating the Thanksgiving figure back in 1986, the total was $28.74 \nThere's \"increasing productivity in the agricultural sector, where you have output growth, increasing in farm yield, so the supply of most agricultural products increases faster than the the demand for those products. When that occurs in the long term, prices tend to decrease,\" said David Schweikhardt, professor of agricultural, food and resource economics at Michigan State University. \"Thanksgiving is part of that larger trend of agricultural prices.\" \nPlus, Americans pay low tariffs for imported fruits and vegetables and food companies that see an increase in purchases at certain times -- like turkey farmers around Thanksgiving -- tend not to jack up their prices. \n\"The producers also know if that if there's an opportunity to sell, they're probably going to want to take advantage of that opportunity, because it's not going to come around the following week,\" he added. \nThe American Farm Bureau's just-under-$50 estimate is far from what Erica Lamb plans to spend. The 31-year-old Waterford resident, who's preparing for seven people, said she expects her tally to be $180, plus another $20-$40 for alcohol. \nSome of that is due to the many side dishes she likes to make, plus the special dishes or ingredients she needs for her vegan sister. Also, throw in bread and sandwich meats for lunch and a pre-dinner appetizer of hummus and vegetables. \n\"I've claimed Thanksgiving as mine,\" Lamb said. \"I do in-depth recipes. I’m doing roasted Brussels sprouts with pecans and dried cranberries. Apple pie with pecans and ($8-a-bag) almond meal, mashed potatoes with cashews, instead of cheese to make them creamier. I don’t buy all organic, but a lot. We don’t cut any corners.\" \nNot everyone is pulling up a chair around a dining room table, though. According to the National Restaurant Association, one in 10 Americans will have their holiday feast Thursday at a restaurant and one in 20 will order a full take-out menu. \nBut for the people hosting the 40% of Americans in the survey who will be going to other people's homes for the big Thanksgiving meal, there are ways to keep costs down: Turn the dinner into a potluck. Ask guests to bring side dishes and desserts. Forget fresh. Frozen turkey are cheaper. Do your homework. Compare prices at various supermarkets. Use coupons Think big. For people planning to have lots of guests, consider buying in bulk. Besides, more leftovers mean more for the hosts to eat into the weekend and early the following week. With freezing, that timetable can be extended even farther. Limit alcohol. This usually is a big ticket item, so cutting it from the menu can be quite the cost-saver. Use smaller plates. They'll look fuller. Don't go overboard with side dishes. A few is fine, especially if they're traditional holiday fare. If you're nearing double digits, stop. Keep centerpieces simple. No one's eating them right? \nContact Zlati Meyer: 313-223-4439 or zmeyer@freepress.com.

Post to Facebook Skip Bayless wants to end feud with Troy Aikman They haven't spoken in 20 years.  //usat.ly/2fPwnkx   Join the Nation's Conversation   Skip Bayless wants to end feud with Troy Aikman Andrew Joseph 7:38   \nSkip Bayless and Troy Aikman (Photo: ESPN file/USA TODAY Sports Images) \nWhen Fox Sports hired Skip Bayless from ESPN, former NFL quarterback and current FOX analyst Troy Aikman was not happy. He had no problem blasting the hire in an interview with Sports Illustrated . \nThat multi-decade feud still continues to this day. \nBefore launching a TV career, Bayless was a columnist at the The Dallas Morning News and covered Aikman's career with the Cowboys. In his book, Hell Bent , Bayless made an unsubstantiated claim that Aikman was gay. The two have neither seen nor spoken to one another since the book was published in 1996. \nBayless, though, would welcome a chance to speak to Aikman and work out their differences. \nHe said via The Dallas Morning News : \n\"For the record, I tried to get in touch with Troy after he seemed to have a public issue with it. I wrote him a note that said, 'I'm dumbfounded by this that you have any issue with this book. I would have thought you would have loved this book.' He was like the last American hero to me. And to this day I haven't seen Troy, and I would be happy to sit down with him today and talk to him.\" Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2fPwnkx Most Popular",

It is a website that is similar to Facebook but without all the censorship.\nThe following information is a new and chilling piece of the Podesta-Clinton email puzzle. It has even stronger connections to pedophilia and Satanism and connects some of the most influential people in the US, including: Barack Obama, George Soros, John Podesta, Tony Podesta, convicted billionaire pedophile Jeffrey Epstein and James Alefantis who is “one of DC’s 50 most powerful people”.\nYou will learn that George Soros donated $20k to ‘Comet Ping Pong’ pizza restaurant, owned by James Alefantis and where Obama goes frequently and even held a fundraiser.\nAccording to one email: “Obama spent about $65,000 of the tax-payers money flying in pizza/dogs from Chicago for a private party.”\nPizza and [hot-]dogs are alleged pedophile codes for “young girls” and “young boys.” You will see more references for yourself and, put into a wider perspective, the codes make sense.\nLady Gaga (left) also attended Marina Abramovic’s (right) Spirit Cooking Satanic “dinner” (it involves a mixture of blood, semen and breast milk) In the following infographic, by connecting the people in the ‘Podesta Emails’ and their alleged ‘pedophilia codes’ you will see strong references to:\nsex with children of both sexes and various ages (pedophilia codes, such as: pizza = young girl, hotdog = young boy, etc.) images from the Satanic ‘Spirit Cooking’ dinner hosted by “artist” Marina Abramovic and attended by John Podesta and his brother Tony, James Alefantis, Lady Gaga, etc. leaked picture of John Podesta making reference to “elite” god Osiris, which was murdered by his brother Seth and chopped into 14 pieces (his penis was never recovered because it was eaten by a fish):\nreferences to Moloch, the god of child sacrifice (Moloch is just one of the many names of Anunnaki god Marduk — Earth’s ruler after Enki was dethroned) multiple references to murder and cannibalism shady images of children posted by James Alefantis on his Instagram account, containing the already mentioned pedophilia hashtags business logos that are very similar to symbols used by pedophiles to identify their sexual preferences pizza restaurants that are possibly connected to this alleged Satanic network of pedophiles and child killers pictures of a metallic coffin pictures of an empty underground room containing the hashtags #killroom and #murder\nAnd let’s not forget the “Sacrificing a Chicken to Moloch” email, where “chicken” is believed to be a code-word for “child.”\nYou can study the infographic here (please take your time and make all the connections).\nsource:\nMost people who use social media have figured out that Facebook and Google are in cahoots with the government, for those who are well aware of the issues it’s high time you switched over to Seen.life .

USA TODAY Sports predicts what players could be available for the NHL's newest team.  //usat.ly/2ghdXHQ   1   What might the NHL's Las Vegas expansion team look like next season? Kevin Allen , USA TODAY Sports 2:58 p.m. EST November 22, 2016 General view as the Nashville Predators logo is projected on the ice during player introductions prior to the game against the Dallas Stars at Bridgestone Arena. (Photo: Christopher Hanewinckel-USA TODAY Sports) \nTonight’s unveiling of the Las Vegas NHL expansion team’s name and logo (8:30 p.m., ET, NHL Network) isn’t a beginning as much as it is a reminder that the team’s first training camp is just over nine months away. \nLas Vegas general manager George McPhee and his scouts have already started projecting which players will be available for the June 20 NHL expansion draft and prioritizing who they want. They can take one player from each team. \nHere is what you should know about the Las Vegas team as it prepares to play in 2017-18 as the NHL’s first expansion team since the Columbus Blue Jackets and Minnesota Wild entered in 2000: NHL puts 'John Scott Rule' in place for All-Star fan voting \nCoach search: McPhee hasn’t provided a specific timetable for hiring the team’s first coach, and he could wait until after this season. No hints about his candidate list have emerged. \nCoaches with NHL experience who could be in the mix include Bob Hartley and Kevin Dineen. Hot prospects include Phil Housley and Trent Green. One intriguing possibility: former Edmonton Oilers Ralph Krueger. He was the media darling at the World Cup of Hockey because of the job he did with Team Europe. His entertaining personality, coupled with his thorough coaching style, would make him an ideal choice for an expansion team. \nGoalie watch: Incumbent teams only can protect one goalie, meaning Las Vegas is going to be able to land three quality goalies in the expansion draft. \nBased on this season’s rosters, the potential expansion draft goalie pool could include Marc-Andre Fleury, Semyon Varlamov, Thomas Greiss, Jimmy Howard, and perhaps Roberto Luongo, although his age and contract make him less attractive to an expansion team. Changing NHL shootout rules would rob us of Marek Malik-like moments \nFuture Las Vegas players? : According to the expansion draft rules, teams can protect either seven forwards and three defensemen or eight combined forwards and defensemen. Players with no-trade or no-movement clauses must be protected. First- and second-year pros are exempt. Based on that, here are some players who might be available: \nJakob Silfverberg, Ryan Dzingel, Dmitri Orlov, Jonas Brodin, Tomas Plekanic, Mikkel Boedker, Trevor van Riemsdyk, Mikhail Grigorenko, Mathieu Perreault, Marian Gaborik and Ryan Sproul. Although the NHL is providing Las Vegas with more attractive players than previous expansion teams have received, it’s not as if Las Vegas will compete for the playoffs in its first season. \nMcPhee is expected to concentrate on younger players or veterans who can be moved to other teams for draft picks. \nFree agent head-start: Las Vegas has a 48-hour period before the expansion draft to negotiate with and sign potential unrestricted free agents. \nThe unrestricted list this summer includes goalie Ben Bishop, defenseman Brent Burns. Kevin Shattenkirk, T.J. Oshie, Karl Alzner, etc. \nIf Las Vegas signs a potential unrestricted free agent in that period, the team can’t take another player from the player’s former team in the expansion draft. \nThe 2017 regular draft: The Las Vegas team will be treated as a lottery team, receiving the same odds of winning as the team with the third-fewest points. The latest the Las Vegas team would pick in the first round would be No. 6. \nThere’s no Connor McDavid or Auston Matthews or Jack Eichel available in this draft. \nThe best prospect is 6-3 Canadian center Nolan Patrick who plays in the Western Hockey League. The best defenseman is Swede Timothy Lijegren who projects to be a dynamic, fast puck mover. Facebook Posted! A link has been posted to your Facebook feed.

Post to Facebook Demaryius Thomas FaceTimes Jimmy Butler for kids This is so awesome.  //usat.ly/2girY8r   Demaryius Thomas FaceTimes Jimmy Butler for kids Alysha Tsuji , USA TODAY 8:40   \nThese kids were really excited to FaceTime Jimmy Butler. (Photo: Denver Broncos, Twitter) \nBroncos wide receiver Demryius Thomas visited the Boys and Girls Clubs of Metro Denver on Tuesday. While he was there, he called up his buddy, the Chicago Bulls' Jimmy Butler, via FaceTime, and the kids freaked out. \n\"OH MY GOD! JIMMY BUTLER! JIMMY BUTLER! JIMMY! WHAT'S UP, JIMMY? I SEE YOU OUT HERE!\" — Broncos Off Field (@BroncosOffField) November 22, 2016 \nThomas is so casual while the kids go wild. It's so wonderful. And the story of how Thomas and Butler's friendship came to be is equally as wonderful. Ben Swanson wrote a nice feature story about it for denverbroncos.com . A photo posted by Demaryius Thomas (@demaryiust88) on Aug 30, 2016 at 7:18pm PDT \nButler reached out to Thomas about a year ago after reading about his childhood. They both went through tough times before becoming as successful as they are now, and they've bonded over that. \nAnyway, props to Butler for answering a quick call for the kids, and props to Thomas for taking time to visit them. Per the Broncos, it was a total surprise. Jaden made videos asking @DemaryiusT to visit the #Broncos Club, so when DT showed up, he was moved to tears.That is the power of sport. pic.twitter.com/934djClHnw — Liz Mannis 📎 (@liz_mannis) November 23, 2016 The kids asked @DemaryiusT to hang at the #Broncos @BGCMetroDenver Club, so he surprised them with a visit today! #BeAChampion pic.twitter.com/ZTye5Z6iYw — Broncos Off Field (@BroncosOffField) November 22, 2016 Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2girY8r Most Popular",

      "text": "facebook find wifi how dangerous is public wi fi we ask an expert More lightpoet/Shutterstock\nFacebook is selectively rolling out a new feature within its mobile app that pinpoints local free Wi-Fi hot spots.\nThe “Find Wi-Fi” function can be found via the menu options in the Facebook app. The platform will then prompt you to set your location access for the app to “always.” The feature essentially lists free and public Wi-Fi locations, and highlights them on a map, providing you directions to your chosen place, reports The Next Web . For now, the feature has only been spotted on the Facebook app for iOS.\nMore: Here’s how Facebook plans to fight the fake news empire taking over its platform\nFacebook has been experimenting with similar features for a few years now, starting with a “ Wi-Fi for check-ins ” partnership in conjunction with Cisco’s Meraki routers. The program allowed businesses to offer up their wireless internet to the public in exchange for check-ins on a Facebook Page. The project was later expanded in partnership with Netgear. The new “Find Wi-Fi” function could therefore be built upon the existing framework Facebook has in place.\nfacebook-wifi More The benefits for businesses are relatively straightforward: People seeking free internet will travel to your location, where they may be tempted into spending real cash on your services.\nWe reached out to Facebook for a comment, but did not immediately receive a response. It’s unclear at this stage if the feature is limited to certain countries.\nWith Facebook actively promoting its Live video service, and boasting of a major shift toward the format in the next five years, it realizes the data drain the strategy could have on its users’ devices. Consequently, helping people discover public Wi-Fi spots could be one way to make sure people can stay connected (and stay live-streaming).\nIt could also be utilized in emerging nations where connectivity is poor and data can prove costly. We already know that Facebook is testing free video downloads in India, which generally require a stable Wi-Fi connection to work. Additionally, better connectivity could prove a boon for the Facebook Lite app, which is only available in non-Western markets.\nLinkNYC heads to Brooklyn, where hopefully they won’t be used for porn LinkUK will take LinkNYC’s free Wi-Fi kiosks across the Atlantic Google Fi’s Wi-Fi Assistant comes to all Nexus devices",

Advertisement \nRecently, Blac Chyna landed a new gig as a MAC Ambassador for their new Shade Scents fragrances.

Commercial producers of Ghana’s home brewed alchoholic spirit more commonly known as Akpeteshie at Agodoe in the Akatsi South District have bemoaned the decline in sales of their products as a result of economic hardship in the country. The liquor which is sold to or associated with the poor and is priced marginally lower than other professionally bottled or imported drinks available on the market has now become a luxury for those who could afford it before, producers have told GHOne News’ Alice Aryetey. They said production cost has also become high as they are faced with many challenges including that of transportation as well. Torve, a local manufacturer told GHOne News they are forced to drink their own produce as a result. “We drink away our sorrows” he said. Adding “we have no choice but to drink the alchohol with our family and friends. Most of our youth are becoming drunkards because of the excess alchohol available to them”. Medical practitioners have said Akpeteshie has a high concentration of alcohol which consequently damages the liver at some point.",

The social networking site has said more than 99 percent of content people see on the site is authentic, but the issue will probably lead to demands in some other countries for more controls and even censorship of social media. \nChina passed in November a new cybersecurity law that gives it greater control over the internet, including by requiring local storage of certain data and requiring any major company working in the country to be subject to \"security reviews\" by the Chinese government. \n“We have long said that we are interested in China, and are spending time understanding and learning more about the country. However, we have not made any decision on our approach to China,” a Facebook spokeswoman wrote in an email on Tuesday, when asked to comment on the NYT report. “Our focus right now is on helping Chinese businesses and developers expand to new markets outside China by using our ad platform,” she added.

      "text": "In what is surely a mere coincidence, at the same time as Facebook has been embroiled in a scandal involving the dissemination of \"election tipping\" stories, which prompted Zuckerberg to release a 7-point plan to eradicate \"fake news\" and which many conservatives believe is a preamble toward wholesale banning of so-called \"fake news\" websites (as arbitrarily defined by an ultra-liberal, Trump-bashing \"professor\") by the social networks (when ironically, Wikileaks revealed that Google was actively engaged in developing a \"strategic plan\" to help the Democrats win the election and track voters), we learn that in an attempt to penetrate the Chinese market, Facebook has \"quietly\" developed a censorship tool to appease China's politburo in hopes the social network will finally get the blessing to address the world's largest market.\n\nAccording to the NYT, which first reported Facebook's strategy, the social network \"*has quietly developed software to suppress posts from appearing in people’s news feeds in specific geographic areas, *according to three current and former Facebook employees, who asked for anonymity because the tool is confidential. The feature was created to help Facebook get into China, a market where the social network has been blocked, these people said. *Mr. Zuckerberg has supported and defended the effort, the people added.*\"\n\nWhy would Zuckerberg support an effort that goes fundamentally against the premise of free speech? Why ad revenue, and profits, of course, because while it remains to be seen if organic revenue growth in the rest of the world is topping out, suddenly getting access to the Chinese market means making a compromise unlike any done previously in Facebook's history.\n\nTo be sure, Facebook has restricted content in other countries before, such as Pakistan , Russia and Turkey, in keeping with the typical practice of American internet companies that generally comply with government requests to block certain content after it is posted. According to its own data, Facebook blocked roughly 55,000 pieces of content in about 20 countries between July 2015 and December 2015, for example. But the censorship tool in China takes a step further by preventing content from appearing in feeds in China in the first place.\n\nThe NYT adds that Facebook does not intend to suppress the posts itself. Instead, it would offer the software to enable a third party — in this case, most likely a partner Chinese company — to monitor popular stories and topics that bubble up as users share them across the social network, the people said. Facebook’s partner would then have full control to decide whether those posts should show up in users’ feeds. In effect, Facebook is willing to admit its sold out its integrity to a third-party Chinese vendor and arbiter, simply to boost revenue, and its stock price (we are confident FB's stock price will rise on the news that the company may be close to penetrating the Chinese market, no matter the cost).\n\nOf course, there is the possibility that once the story becomes public that Facebook is now officially in the censorship game, that it may shelve plans: after all, the last thing Zuckerberg needs now is to be accused not only of spreading \"fake news\" but of engaging in premeditated censorship due to ideology or bias. The Facebook employees the NYT spoke with cautioned that the software is one of many ideas the company has discussed with respect to entering China and, like many experiments inside Facebook, it may never see the light of day. The feature, whose code is visible to engineers inside the company, has so far gone unused, and there is no indication that Facebook has offered it to the authorities in China. Although, it is hard to imagine why Facebook would spend millions developing such a project if it had no intention of using it.\n\nWorse, *the project illustrates the extent to which Facebook may be willing to compromise one of its core mission statements, “to make the world more open and connected,” *to gain access to a market of 1.4 billion Chinese people. Even as Facebook faces pressure to continue growing — Mr. Zuckerberg has often asked where the company’s next billion users will come from — China has been cordoned off to the social network since 2009 because of the government’s strict rules around censorship of user content.\n\nBut what may be the most interesting part of this story, is that Facebook's creeping censorship may have led to an internal \"whistleblower\" with a conscience: a Facebook \"Snowden: if you will:\n\n\n\nSeveral employees who were working on the project have left Facebook after expressing misgivings about it, according to the current and former employees.\n\n\n\nAn official statement from the company was non-committal: a Facebook spokeswoman said in a statement, “We have long said that we are interested in China, and are spending time understanding and learning more about the country.” She added that the company had made no decisions on its approach into China.\"\n\nCensorship notwithstanding, Zuckerberg may have trouble breaching the Chinese market even purely on its \"redacted\" merits: coming at a time when Trump is actively preparing for trade war with China, the last thing Xi Jinping will want to do is make a political concession that grants Facebook market share in China at the expense of protected domestic companies.\n\nIndeed, as NYT adds, the current climate for internet companies in China may not help Facebook. In August, the ride-hailing giant Uber gave up an expensive battle to crack the Chinese market, selling its Chinese business to an incumbent rival, Didi Chuxing. More broadly, China has streamlined and tightened its controls over the internet under President Xi, targeting influential social media celebrities and adding new reviews to popular online video sites.\n\nHowever, China may allow Facebook to enter, on one condition: that it is used to root out political dissidents, making the social network into a \"snitch\":\n\n\n\nSome officials responsible for China’s tech policy have been willing to entertain the idea of Facebook’s operating in the country. It would legitimize China’s strict style of internet governance, and if done according to official standards, would enable easy tracking of political opinions deemed problematic. Even so, resistance remains at the top levels of Chinese leadership.\n\n\n\nUltimately, what Facebook may end up doing is transforming itself into a mutant, minority version of itself where it keeps a portion of the upside, while letting a bigger partner deal with the local political headache: analysts have said Facebook’s best option is to follow a model laid out by other internet companies and cooperate with a local company or investor. Finding a partner — and potentially allowing it to own a majority stake in Facebook’s China operation — would take the burden of censorship and surveillance off the Silicon Valley company. It would also let Facebook rely on a local company’s government connections and experience to deal with the difficult task of communicating with Beijing, the NYT notes.\n\nFacebook currently sells advertising for some Chinese businesses from its Hong Kong office. Among its customers are state-media sites that act as the propaganda arm of the Chinese government, and that operate official accounts where they post articles. Chinese citizens who wish to gain access to Facebook must tunnel in using a technology known as a virtual private network, or VPN.\n\n* * *\n\nGoing back to the censorship tool, it is unclear when it originated, but the project is said to have picked up momentum in the last year*, as engineers were plucked from other parts of Facebook to work on the effort, the current and former employees said*. The project was led by Vaughan Smith, a vice president for mobile, corporate and business development at Facebook, they said. Like Mr. Zuckerberg, Mr. Smith speaks a smattering of Mandarin.\n\nUnveiling a new censorship tool in China could lead to more demands to suppress content from other countries. The fake-news problem, which has hit countries across the globe, has already led some governments - most notably Germany - to use the issue as an excuse to target sites of political rivals, or shut down social media sites altogether.\n\nCuriously, for whatever reason, several Facebook employees who were working on the suppression tool left the company over the summer. Internally, *so many employees asked about the project and its ambitions on an internal forum that, in July, it became a topic at one of Facebook’s weekly Friday afternoon question-and-answer sessions*.\n\nMr. Zuckerberg was at the event and answered a question from the audience about the tool. He told the gathering that Facebook’s China plans were nascent. But he also struck a pragmatic tone about the future, according to employees who attended the session.\n\n*“It’s better for Facebook to be a part of enabling conversation, even if it’s not yet the full conversation,” *Mr. Zuckerberg said, according to employees.\n\nAnd if Facebook is willing to go the full distance and compromise its core mission statement in China just to pick a few basis points of growth, how long until the social network will do the same in the US, where a witch-hunt against \"fake news\" unlike any other, has exploded in recent days and which effectively grants Facebook the ability to censor anyone it disagrees with. After all, we now know that the tool is in place - all Zuckerberg has to do is flip a switch.",

      "text": "The Huffington Post If you’ve been looking at Facebook lately, you may have seen that Pope Francis endorsed Donald Trump , a town in Texas was quarantined due to a deadly disease and Germany just approved child marriage . To be clear, none of these events really happened ― but that didn’t stop news of them from spreading like a virus.\nFake news articles ― especially throughout this election year ― have increasingly become a fixture on social media. These posts, designed to deceive, run rampant across the internet. Only later, if ever, do readers discover that the stories they shared may have been false.\nThe publication of blatantly inaccurate stories is certainly not new to the digital age, or even the analog era ― just check your local supermarket aisle for tabloids ― but what is new is how easy it is for a reader to scan a headline on Facebook, hit share and watch his 500 followers do the same.\nIn the final three months before the election, 20 top-performing fake news stories on Facebook outperformed 20 top-performing factual stories from 19 major media outlets in terms of engagement, according to a BuzzFeed study published last week.\nAs it stands, there are few checks and balances to prevent any outlet from posting an article that is made up of false facts. In the coming months social media platforms will need to address many broader questions, including what level of editorial control sites like Facebook should exercise over the content on their platforms.\nAfter initially downplaying the problem, Facebook announced on Friday that it would begin seeking out ways to weed out some kinds of fake news from feeds. Google, too, said it plans to stop fake news sites from using its ad-selling service.\nBut part of stopping the spread of hoaxes and misinformation also falls on readers who email these articles to friends and family or post them on social media, lending these stories their own credibility.\nIn order to prevent the spread of fake news, here is a quick guide to spotting it.\n1. Read Past The Headline One way that fake news gets amplified is that busy readers may not look past the headline or opening paragraph before they decide to share an article. Fake news publishers sometimes exploit this tendency , writing the beginning of a story in a straightforward way before filling in the rest with obviously false information.\nIn other cases, clicking through to the article will reveal that the story really has nothing to do with the headline at all or provides nothing to back it up.\n2. Check What News Outlet Published It Unfamiliar websites plastered with ads and all-caps headlines should draw immediate skepticism. Googling a site’s name and checking out other articles it posts should also help determine whether it’s trustworthy.\nMany fake news sites will outright say that they are satire or don’t contain factual information, but others are made to mimic major news outlets. Check the URL names of pages that look suspect , making sure that it’s not a hoax site that is pretending to be a trusted source.\n 3. Check The Publish Date And Time Another common element in fake news is that old articles or events can resurface and lead people to believe they just happened. Checking the publish time stamp is something readers can quickly do to prevent being misled.\nSometimes, however, finding out when an event happened can take a bit more work ― such as when the date of an article is current, but the events described within it are old. Click through links and read carefully to determine when the event described actually happened.\n4. Who Is The Author? Looking at who wrote the article can reveal a lot of information about the news source. Searching through the author’s previous articles can show whether they are a legitimate journalist or have a history of hoaxes.\nFacebookThe Event Handbook A Facebook post from The Event Chronicle falsely claiming that George Soros died. 5. Look At What Links And Sources Are Used A lack of links or sources for claims in an article is an obvious warning sign that the post is likely false. Fake sites may also provide numerous links to sites that appear to back up their claims, but are themselves spreading misinformation. Check to see that claims supported by links actually come from reliable sources.\n6. Look Out For Questionable Quote: s And Photos It’s incredible easy for fake news writers to invent false Quote: s, even attributing them to major public figures. Be skeptical of shocking or suspicious Quote: s, and search to see if they have been reported elsewhere.\nLikewise, it’s easy to take a photo from one event and say it’s from another. Images can also be altered for a certain story. Reverse image searches, either through Google or tools like TinEye , can help you find where an image originated.\n7. Beware Confirmation Bias People are often drawn to stories that reinforce the way they see the world and how they feel about certain issues. Fake news is no exception, and many of the articles that fall under its umbrella are designed to stir up emotion in readers and prey on their biases.\nIt’s important to check that news stories are based in fact, rather than sharing them because they support one side of an argument or bolster pre-existing political beliefs.\nFacebook A Facebook post on the page of American News linking to a false story. 8. Search If Other News Outlets Are Reporting It If a story looks suspicious or claims to reveal major news, search to see if other news outlets are also reporting the story. A single article from a suspicious source making a grand claim should be viewed with heavy skepticism. If no reliable news outlets are also reporting the story, then it’s very likely fake.\n9. Think Before You Share Fake news sites rely on readers to share and engage with their articles in order for them to spread. In extreme cases, these fake articles can balloon out of control and have unintended consequences for those involved in the stories.\nAfter fake news stories claimed that Hillary Clinton was sexually abusing children at a Washington, D.C., pizza restaurant , the business owner and his employees received death threats and vicious online harassment. The staff is still under attack even though these false claims have been debunked.\nMore Resources For Spotting Fake News: Snopes.com\nMelissa Zimdars’ List Of Fake News Sites\nOn The Media Fake News Handbook\nFactCheck.org\nPoynter’s Tips For Debunking Fake News\nTinEye Reverse Image Search\nWashington Post Fact Checker\nMore: Donald Trump Facebook Social Media Suggest a correction Comments From Our Partners Presented by LendingTree Close SUBSCRIBE TO & FOLLOW THE MORNING EMAIL Get top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day.

      "text": "Good design is hard. But more and more we all have to do it. Whether it's a nice Facebook banner, a clever profile pic, an eye-catching Instagram post or some well polished ideas for a work presentation, we all want something more than the terrible basic options offered up by Powerpoint.\nEnter Canva. The 5-year-old Australian startup is all about offering slick templates through a free service that is exceptionally simple to use. Whether through its website or the apps for iPhone and iPad , it takes just a few seconds to work out how to get started and make something that looks great.\nThis all sounds like an ad -- simple DIY design sounds too good to be true -- but a quick taste test proves how true the pitch is. And after a slow boil for its first few years, a rapid climb to over 10 million users across 179 countries (Canva says it just passed five designs per second) suggest this is something that is starting to resonate.\nCo-founder Melanie Perkins wants to give everyone the tools to make good everyday designs with minimal fuss.\nPhoto by Canva \"Having great quality ingredients for people to work with has been a driving premise behind Canva,\" says Melanie Perkins, co-founder of Canva. \"Before Canva, you'd have to be a professional designer to easily access beautiful stock photography and illustrations. There are template libraries out there, but again, they're only for designers who use professional design software.\"\nWhile the service is free, Canva makes money through the sale of stock images as well as a \"Canva for Work\" premium offering that lets a company set brand guidelines and templates to make it easier for people all around a company stick to core design principles without always needing designers to create every document, every presentation or whatever else may be required.\n\"Social media posts, pitch decks, proposals, marketing materials. Designers are getting spread really thin throughout organisations,\" says Perkins. \"They often have to neglect sales, for example, who often just string their own terribly off brand things together. This really helps to bring brand identity together. Colours, fonts, logos so everybody is on the right track.\"\nDemocratising design Exploring the Canva website, beyond the design tools the company also offers anyone who wants it a crash course in good design. There's a design school blog, design tutorials and a design stream where you can see what other people have been designing and offer likes and comments. Perkins suggests people have been conditioned to think they're just not creative, so they're often afraid to play around.\nEnlarge Image Canva's usage has been on a rapid rise, now surpassing five designs per second across its web and app platforms.\nPhoto by Canva When Canva first launched, the company's user research found people were inherently afraid to click things in case they messed something up.\n\"People were really conscious about not clicking too much and not playing around. But this is meant to be the exact opposite,\" says Perkins. \"So we introduced starter challenges -- put a hat on a monkey, change the colour of a circle, add a background to a page, really basic things. But each step builds confidence.\"\nOffering templates that don't get too repetitive is a big challenge, but Canva has tried to solve for this concern by inviting professional designers to share templates publicly and receive royalties whenever their templates are used by others.\nFor Perkins, it's the success stories of those who have been using Canva that make her feel like they're achieving their mission. From the story of a small US sheriff's office using Canva to create wanted posters, to the story of a woman who created an image to help track down her birth mother that worked after going viral on Facebook.\nAustralia's coolest tech company Canva is fast becoming the proverbial and literal poster child of the Australia startup scene. From humble origins in Perkins' mother's living room and \"incubating\" in San Francisco food courts, the company is now growing rapidly with a team of over 120 across 3 countries and a latest funding round of AU$19.8M at a valuation of AU$462M.\nCanva across the web, iPhone and iPad. \"Other platforms\" (read Android) are planned for the future.\nPhoto by Canva The company also provides classic Silicon Valley perks, with an in-house chef, free gym and yoga classes, flexible working conditions and more. It was all enough to land Canva the title of Australia's Coolest Tech Company two years running from job listings website Job Advisor.\n\"We're in the ridiculously fortunate position that before we took on this latest funding we hadn't spent a dollar from the previous round,\" says Perkins. \"We got the revenues to grow rapidly and everything sort of naturally moving in the right direction.\"\nThere's still a lot more to do. Getting apps on Android is an obvious one, but Perkins suggests the company is only scratching the surface of its larger, and far loftier, long term plans.\n\"If we can become the productivity tool, the productivity platform for the next generation, with all the crazy needs everyone has for visual content they need to create, that would be pretty cool.\"\n ",

      "text": "If this router is open, Facebook could help you find it.\nPhoto by Josh Miller/CNET Facebook has begun testing a feature that lets you find nearby open Wi-Fi networks through its iOS app , a Facebook spokesperson confirmed to CNET.\nThe feature is still in early testing, and it's only available for iOS and only in select countries. To see if you have it, tap the menu icon in the bottom left corner of the app. Then, scroll down until you see \"Find Wi-Fi.\" If you want to use the feature, hit the tab and then choose \"Enable Find Wi-Fi.\" From there you can browse free and public Wi-Fi networks nearby. Not all users have the feature yet, so don't be confused if you can't find it in the settings.\nThe free Wi-Fi program is one of many examples of Facebook trying to help more people using the internet -- and therefore use Facebook itself. Although Facebook has sent out drones and satellites to give internet access to more remote locations, the nearby Wi-Fi feature is more of an urban solution. Facebook previously had a program that exchanged Wi-Fi access for Facebook check-ins at local businesses.\nAlso keep in mind that open networks are riskier to use than password-protected ones, so make sure you know how to stay safe .\n ",

So I'm \"alt\" because I'm libertarian, somebody else might be \"alt\" because they're Amish, somebody else might be \"alt\" because they're Nazi. Putting me and Amish in the same basket as Nazis is, obviously, offensive. Therefore I advocate using the term \"Nazis\" if you specifically mean Nazis.\" Incidentally, among these many \"alts\" I see Bannon as anti-crony, anti-establishment, traditional values. Which puts him in \"Old Right\" (\"paleoconservative\"). The old right was Hitler's second nemesis after he dispatched his left-wing socialist competitors.",

      "text": "By Joshua Fields Millburn & Ryan Nicodemus · Follow: Facebook , Twitter , Instagram \nHere we are, in the midst of what is supposedly the most joyous time of year: the holiday season. And yet, for most of us, it’s also the most stressful time of year. At some point Santa Claus turned corporate, and the holiday season metamorphosed into the holiday shopping season. \nShopping. This one word, although birthed from great intentions, has fundamentally changed our outlook from blissful to grim, from jolly to anxious, from celebrating Christmas to surviving the holidays. It’s upsetting, and with consumption’s vicious inertia, it seems there’s no way for us to exit the speeding train of consumerism. \nThis Friday is the busiest shopping day of the year: Black Friday. (Boxing Day is the overseas equivalent.) Retailers prepare months in advance for this dark day—preparation that’s meant to stimulate our insatiable desire to consume: Doorbuster sales. New products. Gigantic newspaper ads. TV, radio, billboards. Sale, sale, sale! Early bird specials! One day only! Get the best deal! Act now! While supplies last. See store for details. \nBut as shiny as its facade may be, the pernicious aspects of Black Friday are not few. The pandemonium that takes place on this day is perhaps a broader metaphor for our culture as a whole—our consumer culture. On this day we consume gluttonously without regard for the harm we’re inflicting on ourselves. On this day greed becomes ravenous. On this day we live without real meaning, buying gifts to fill a void we can’t fill with material possessions. \nPerhaps Steven said it best: Black Friday is the day we trample people for things we don’t need, the day after being thankful for what we have. \nSadly, we participate in this insanity in the name of a holiday, as if buying gifts was an ideal way to celebrate Christmas. But thankfully we have options. \nInstead of embracing Black Friday, you can refuse to buy material items for people to display your love; rather, you can showcase your love, caring, and affection through daily actions—every day, not just holidays. \nIf you want to give gifts, why not gift an experience: a nice meal, tickets to a concert, a sunset on the beach? After all, the best, most loving gift you can give someone is your time and undivided attention. Presence is the best present. \nOr, if that doesn’t work, maybe you can buy everyone on your Christmas list a giant trash can so they can throw away all the presents they received, but didn’t ask for. \nWill you join us? Will you opt out of Black Friday? If not, why not? \nIf you found value in this essay, regift it to your friends and family. SHARE",

      "text": "Police investigating February Roanoke homicide search phone, Facebook records By Neil Harvey neil.harvey@roanoke.com 981-3376 Nov 21, 2016 ( … ) \nRoughly nine months into the homicide investigation of a northwest Roanoke man, police have seized cellphone data and Facebook records, according to search warrants filed last week. \nThe search is related to the death of Martavious Ra’shad Cook, 26, who was found fatally shot Feb. 23 inside his home in the 500 block of Westwood Boulevard. \nCook’s death marked the city’s first reported homicide of 2016. \nTwo search warrants filed Wednesday in Roanoke Circuit Court show that a DNA sample found during an examination of his body led police to investigate another individual. \nThat man has not been charged in the case, but according to the warrants, Cook’s own cellphone showed he communicated with that man less than two hours before Cook was found dead. \nInvestigators took data from the man’s phone and also examined his Facebook account, which “may provide further investigative information as to the incident; message history prior to and after the incident; and pre and post incident behaviors,” one of the warrants said. \nRoanoke police spokesman Scott Leamon said Monday that no arrests have been made in the case and the investigation is continuing. \nPrior warrants filed in February showed that a relative found Cook in his home, dead from a gunshot wound. \nPolice took numerous items from the home, including a locked black Sentry safe that an informant told them “contained US Currency and illegal narcotics,” according to one warrant. \n“Evidence on the scene indicated possible robbery of the safe as motive in the homicide,” the warrant said.

Sgt. Patricia Nunez reunites with her husband, Spc. Adrian Ramos, in Colorado Springs. (Photo: Jerilee Bennett, The (Colorado Springs) Gazette, via AP) \nThis Thanksgiving, negativity is in abundant supply. \nTwo weeks have passed since an unusually ugly and divisive presidential campaign. Many of the 70 million who voted for someone other than Donald Trump see the outcome as one of America’s darker chapters. Many of those who voted for Trump are thrilled, but many others admit their choice was made more out of frustration than affirmation. \nAnd for millions of Americans, just getting through the family dinner on Thursday without a major blowup seems like a reach. \nIn addition to the political worries, Americans are vexed by global terrorism, concerned their jobs may disappear or worried about other matters. But, as always, there are reasons to be thankful, starting with family and health. Beyond that, the past decade has seen remarkable breakthroughs in science and medicine, and substantial abatement of seemingly intractable problems. Among the positive trends that don’t often get the attention they deserve: \nThe economy is doing well. Negativity aside, the numbers on employment and economic growth are pretty good. Since the bottom of the Great Recession, 15.2 million jobs have been created, pushing the unemployment rate down to 4.9%. Just last week, 235,000 people filed first-time unemployment claims. That’s the lowest weekly figure in 43 years and marks the 89th straight week below 300,000, the longest streak since 1970. The biggest criticism of the economy — that it isn’t producing much wage growth — is getting harder to defend. Last year, annual median household income was up 5.2%, with all signs suggesting that the trend will continue into this year. Even the poverty rate has been dropping. Meanwhile, the stock market has been hitting new highs, bolstering Americans’ 401(k) accounts. \nISIL is in retreat. The Islamic State terrorist group, which uses Iraq and Syria as its base, is in decline in both countries. According to Army Lt. Gen. Sean MacFarland, the top U.S. commander in the region, ISIL’s numbers in those two countries have dropped from 60,000 to about 15,000. Iraqi forces are battling to defeat the remaining ISIL fighters in Mosul, their most significant holding in the country, while U.S.-backed forces in Syria have made impressive strides there as well. No one expects ISIL to disappear. But denying its fighters a base from which to operate, and showing that they can be defeated, should greatly diminish the terror group’s reach and appeal. \nTeen smoking is down. Smoking kills far more Americans than terrorists do, and most smokers get addicted as youths. Last year, smoking among high school students dropped to its lowest level in the quarter-century that data have been collected. The two years from 2013 to 2015 saw one of the steepest declines yet, as the 15.7% of students who smoked dropped to 10.8%, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . As recently as 1997, more than 36% of high school students smoked. The drops could portend a long-term improvement in the health of Americans. However, the campaign against smoking is far from won. Public health officials are still wary that e-cigarettes could help addict a new generation to nicotine. \nTeen births continue to fall. Just as teen smoking rates have declined, so have teen birth rates. Last year, 22.3 children were born to every 1,000 girls ages 15 to 19. That’s down by nearly half in eight years and a whopping 64% since 1991, when the teen birth rate was 61.8 per 1,000. The declines were across all categories, but were most pronounced in urban areas and among African Americans and Hispanics. In fact, teens in big cities are below the national average in having babies. Experts cite birth control as the prime cause of the drop, though some preliminary evidence also suggests a drop in sexual activity. In any case, the declines mean an easier path to college and successful careers for young women, and fewer children raised by mothers who are ill-prepared for their responsibilities — in other words, a win-win situation. \nDivorce rates are down, too. Divorce rates have dropped three years in a row and are at their lowest level in 35 years. From nearly 23 divorces per 1,000 married women in 1980, the rate fell below 17 in 2015, according to the National Center for Family & Marriage Research . The rate of marriages, meanwhile, ticked up slightly in 2015, continuing a modest upward trend following a long and steady decline. In 2015 there were 32.3 marriages per 1,000 adult unmarried women, up from 31.9 the previous year. The numbers on marriage and divorce are important because stable marriages are associated with other positive trends such as lower youth crime, more vibrant neighborhoods and greater educational attainment. \nNot to mention more intact families at Thanksgiving dinner. \nUSA TODAY's editorial opinions are decided by its Editorial Board , separate from the news staff.

Sorry There was an error emailing this page. China's Great Hall of the People. Credit: Michael Kan More like this Facebook drones will deliver Internet from the sky \nFacebook has reportedly developed a software tool that will help keep certain content away from users’ news feeds in certain geographies, reflecting the company’s apparent willingness to meet Chinese government censorship demands part of the way. \nThe social networking site has been banned in China since 2009 because of the government’s censorship rules and like many other U.S. technology companies would like to reenter the market with nearly 1.4 billion people. \nCEO Mark Zuckerberg has learned Mandarin, visited the country often and cultivated the local leadership including President Xi Jinping. \n[ Download the State of the CIO 2016 report ] \nThe new tool suppresses posts from appearing to people in certain geographies but will not be used directly by Facebook, reported The New York Times on Tuesday , citing three current and former Facebook employees, who spoke on condition of anonymity as the tool is confidential. \nThe software will instead enable a partner, most likely a Chinese company, to monitor popular stories and topics across the social network, and who would “have full control to decide whether those posts should show up in users’ feeds.” \nAt an internal event in July, Zuckerberg was asked about the controversial tool. “It’s better for Facebook to be a part of enabling conversation, even if it’s not yet the full conversation,” Zuckerberg said, according to the employees, NYT reported. \nThere is no indication that Facebook has offered the tool to the Chinese and like other experiments by the company, the tool could be shelved, the sources told the newspaper. \nFacebook is already facing criticism in the U.S. for fake news in its feeds in the run-up to the U.S. presidential elections. The social networking site has said more than 99 percent of content people see on the site is authentic, but the issue will probably lead to demands in some other countries for more controls and even censorship of social media. \nChina passed in November a new cybersecurity law that gives it greater control over the internet, including by requiring local storage of certain data and requiring any major company working in the country to be subject to \"security reviews\" by the Chinese government. \n“We have long said that we are interested in China, and are spending time understanding and learning more about the country. However, we have not made any decision on our approach to China,” a Facebook spokeswoman wrote in an email on Tuesday, when asked to comment on the NYT report. “Our focus right now is on helping Chinese businesses and developers expand to new markets outside China by using our ad platform,” she added.

      "text": "When Nabanita De scrolled through her Facebook feed recently, she felt afraid. There were so many posts with competing information and accusations about Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton that she didn't know how to begin deciphering the fearmongering from the reality.\nThe social media site has faced criticism since the presidential election for its role in disseminating fake and misleading stories that are indistinguishable from real news. Because Facebook's algorithm is designed to determine what its individual users want to see, people often see only that which validates their existing beliefs regardless of whether the information is true.\nSo when De, an international second-year master's student at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst, attended a hackathon at Princeton University this week where the goal was to develop a technology project in 36 hours, she suggested to her three teammates that they build an algorithm to authenticate what is real and what is fake on Facebook.\nAnd they were able to do it.\nThe four students — De, with Purdue University freshman Anant Goel and sophomores Mark Craft and Qinglin Chen from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign — built a Chrome browser extension that tags links in Facebook feeds as verified or not verified by taking into account factors such as the source's credibility and cross-checking the content with other news stories. Where a post appears to be false, the plug-in will provide a summary of more credible information on the topic online. A small blue box in the upper right-hand corner of the screen says either \"verified\" or \"not verified.\"\nFacebook fake-news writer: 'I think Donald Trump is in the White House because of me' Caitlin Dewey What do the Amish lobby, gay wedding vans and the ban of the national anthem have in common? For starters, they're all make-believe — and invented by the same man.\nPaul Horner, the 38-year-old impresario of a Facebook fake-news empire, has made his living off viral news hoaxes for several years....\nWhat do the Amish lobby, gay wedding vans and the ban of the national anthem have in common? For starters, they're all make-believe — and invented by the same man.\nPaul Horner, the 38-year-old impresario of a Facebook fake-news empire, has made his living off viral news hoaxes for several years....\n(Caitlin Dewey) They've called it FiB.\nSince the students developed it in only 1 1/2 days (and have classes and schoolwork to worry about), they've released it as an \"open-source project,\" asking anyone with development experience to help improve it. The plugin is available for download to the public, but the demand was so great that their limited operation couldn't handle it.\nIdeally, Goel said, Facebook would team up with a third-party developer such as FiB so that the company could control all news feed data but let the developers verify it so Facebook couldn't be accused of \"hidden agendas or biases.\"\nThe sponsors of the hackathon included Facebook and other major technology companies, but neither Facebook nor Google has contacted the students about FiB. Both companies have said this week that they will take steps to address the spread of fake news.\nThis year's presidential election has shown how the lines have blurred between fact and lies, with people profiting from the spread of fake news. More than 100 news sites that made up pro-Trump content have been traced to Macedonia, according to a BuzzFeed News investigation. The Washington Post interviewed Paul Horner, a prolific fake-news creator, who said: \"I think Trump is in the White House because of me. His followers don't fact-check anything — they'll post everything, believe anything.\"\nFacebook's Zuckerberg says fake news didn't drive election Sarah Frier Facebook Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg rejected the idea that fake news on the social network influenced the U.S. presidential election and said echo chambers aren't a problem on the site.\nThe company co-founder was responding to criticism following Donald Trump 's victory in the elections,...\nFacebook Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg rejected the idea that fake news on the social network influenced the U.S. presidential election and said echo chambers aren't a problem on the site.\nThe company co-founder was responding to criticism following Donald Trump 's victory in the elections,...\n(Sarah Frier) Melissa Zimdars, a communications professor at Merrimack College in North Andover, Massachusetts, said she's seen a similar problem with students who cite questionable sources. So she created a list of fake, misleading or satirical sites as a reference, not as a direct response to the postelection fake news debate but to encourage students to be more media-literate by checking what they read against other sources.\nThe list, which she has continued to add to since she made it public earlier this week, has gone viral. She included tips for analyzing news sources:\n\"Watch out if known/reputable news sites are not also reporting on the story. Sometimes lack of coverage is the result of corporate media bias and other factors, but there should typically be more than one source reporting on a topic or event.\n\"If the story makes you REALLY ANGRY it's probably a good idea to keep reading about the topic via other sources to make sure the story you read wasn't purposefully trying to make you angry (with potentially misleading or false information) in order to generate shares and ad revenue.\"\nZimdars said people have grown so distrustful of institutional media that they turn to alternative sources. A recent Pew Research Center survey found that only 18 percent of people have a lot of trust in national news organizations; nearly 75 percent said news organizations are biased.\nIt doesn't help, Zimdars said, that news media, to be profitable, rely on \"click-bait\" headlines that are sometimes indistinguishable from the fake stories.\nPaul Mihailidis, who teaches media literacy at Emerson College in Boston had a different take.\n\"I don't think a lot of people didn't know; I think they didn't care. They saw it as a way to advocate,\" Mihailidis said. \"The more they could spread rumors, or could advocate for their value system or candidate, that took precedent over them not knowing. A large portion of them didn't stop to critique the information. One of the things that has happened is people are scrolling though [Facebook] and the notion of deep reading is being replaced by deep monitoring. They see a catchy headline, and the default is to share.\"\nAnd the way people consume news, by a flick of the thumb on a smartphone, means they are less likely to cross-check what they're reading against other sources.\nThat's where the plugin tool presents a simple solution.\n\"A few days back, I read an article telling people they can drill a jack in the iPhone7 and have an earphone plug, and people started doing it and ruining their phones,\" De said. \"We know we can search on Google and research it, but if you have five minutes and you're just scrolling through Facebook, you don't have time to go verify it.\"\n Donald Trump Purdue University Princeton University",

      "text": "0 0 \nSpamming and ransomware are the most common forms of cyber crime encountered today. FBI records suggest that there has been $1 billion of money secured by cyber criminals in 2016 alone. As dangerous and untraceable as these crimes may be, encountering them on well-known, trusted sites make them even more perilous. This time, spammers have targeted Facebook . \nFacebook has been marked quarantine after falling prey to a ransomware attack that has spread like wildfire over the social network. The notorious spam campaign involves the spreading of the Nemucod malware downloader among users, which in some cases was seen downloading the Locky ransomware . To make it even worse, there is no free decryption program available for Locky. \nLocky ransomware is known to lock up an infected computer, encrypt its files then hold them ransom for a Bitcoin payment . There is still no concrete solution developed for Locky’s encryption so users have little hopes of ever recovering the damage. \nThe threat was spotted by two security personnel specialized in internet-based crime and malware, Bart Blaze . who handles Threat Intelligence for multinational financial services company PricewaterhouseCoopers and Peter Kruse . an eCrime specialist for the Danish CSIS Security Group A/S. The peril was generated in the form of spam messages spread via Facebook’s IM system. \nThe virus evaded Facebook’s whitelisting by pretending to be a .SVG image file and was sent from compromised Facebook accounts. The infected files, unlike other common file types, have the ability to contain embedded content like JavaScript and can be opened in a modern browser. The reason the crooks opted to share SVG images is because it is XML-based and allows dynamic content so it was easier to cloak JavaScript code right inside the photo itself, which in this case was a link to an external file. \nOpening the infected file redirects users to a spammy site, a copycat version of YouTube . The website doesn’t raise any red flags until it prompt users to install a malicious codec Chrome extension in order to watch the video. Upon allowing, the unsubstantiated extension will give it the capability to alter user’ data regarding the sites they visit. \nAs reported by Blaze, the extension will also spread the malware further on Facebook , compromising the victim’s account. The spammers can take over your account and further spread the malware among your social media friends by sending them spammy messages with the same SVG image file. Safety Measures \nFor starters, and this one is pretty obvious: do not click any SVG file. If your close ones send you a message with the ransomware attached, you should warn them ASAP about their account being compromised. \nDeny installing the Chrome extension and even if you do somehow click on the SVG file, one way to revert it is to go to the menu, navigate to ‘Extensions’ via Select More Tools, find the extension and then remove it before Necumod infects your system. \nThe next step would be to download a powerful internet security software . System Watcher is one of the most reliable tools to tackle the problem, developed by Kaspersky Lab . System Watcher is available on all of Kaspersky Lab’s main products like Kaspersky Anti-Virus , Kaspersky Internet Security, and the ultimate in computer security, Kaspersky Total Security. \nBut if you have gone past this, the safety ship has sailed and the most you can do now wipe your hard drive to get rid of the Locky ransomware and be more judicious about strange Facebook images next time. \n ",

      "text": "AP Photo/Ben Margot \nDigital Content Next (DCN), a US trade body that represents premium online publishers, has sent a letter to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Google CEO Sundar Pichai, calling on the two companies to do more to tackle the fake news being discovered and shared across their sites.\nThe letter, obtained by Business Insider (which you can read in full below) was written by DCN CEO Jason Kint, says both companies \"bear a special responsibility, one that you sometimes appear naïve to\" to clean up the \"garbage littering the digital media ecosystem.\"\nBoth Google and Facebook are facing increased scrutiny about their efforts to tackle fake news following the US presidential election.\nFalse stories claiming Pope Francis had endorsed Donald Trump and that Hillary Clinton had sold weapons to ISIS were widely shared on Facebook . Meanwhile, the top Google News result for \"final election count\" was at one point surfacing a fake story from a Wordpress blog, incorrectly claiming Trump had won the popular vote by a margin of almost 700,000.\nAfter first dismissing the notion that fake news on Facebook could have swung the presidential election as \"crazy,\"  Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg acknowledged a \"small amount\" of content on the site is hoaxes and said the company has more work to do in order to rid the site of fake news. Google CEO Sundar Pichai, on the other hand, was immediately more open to the suggestion that fake news might have affected the election and said the company has been looking at how to fact-check articles and promote stories from trusted sources. This month, both companies also moved to ban fake news sites from their ad networks. \nBut Kint of DCN says these efforts, while \"encouraging and constructive\" are not enough and that they should apply themselves to ridding their services of fake news with the same \"excitement, investment, and vigilance as their sexier forward-thinking technology projects, often referred to at Google as \"moonshots.\"\nKint writes:\n\"However, to paraphrase a recent New York Times editorial, we believe you owe your users, and democracy itself, far more. Your companies make it a point to celebrate 'moonshots' that require extraordinary vision, resources and engineering prowess. Your capacity to pursue these projects is built on your extraordinary dominance over the digital media landscape.\n\"Wouldn’t it make sense for you to pursue cleaning-up the garbage littering the digital media ecosystem with the same excitement, investment and vigilance with which you pursue these huge, visionary projects? We don’t see that in your public statements or actions. Over the years, you have claimed repeatedly that you are not media companies; instead, the word “utility” has been used, occasionally by your own executives. But if even 1% of the water in our local utility was polluted, wouldn’t it be right to move heaven and earth to clean it up?\"\nDCN represents more than 70 media brands including The New York Times, The Washington Post, Viacom, Business Insider, The Financial Times, Time Inc., Hearst, Gannett, Bloomberg, ESPN, AP, and BBC.com.\nKint says in the letter that these publishers — who do sometimes get things wrong but are trusted by consumers to provide accurate and fair coverage and admit when they have made mistakes — are willing to \"devote time, resources, and energy to help clean up this mess.\"\nSpokespeople for Google and Facebook were not immediately available for comment.\nHere is the letter from Digital Content Next CEO Jason Kint to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Google CEO Sundar Pichai in full: \nMark Zuckerberg\nChairman, Founder and CEO\nFacebook\n1 Hacker Way\nMenlo Park, CA 94025\nSundar Pichai\nCEO\nGoogle \n1600 Amphitheatre Parkway\nMountain View, CA 94043\nNovember 22, 2016\nDear Mark and Sundar,\nAs the trade organization representing brands that seek long-term consumer trust through the creation of high quality news, information and entertainment, we feel compelled to provide our perspective on the dangerous proliferation of “fake news” throughout the digital ecosystem. Digital Content Next (DCN) members include companies that have earned the trust of consumers for more than a century to companies born in the digital era.\nThe common thread that weaves these companies together is the trust they seek to earn every day by providing the highest quality content. We’re not suggesting that our members always “get it right,” but accuracy, depth and fairness are core to their mission. And transparency is vital when things go wrong. Your services succeed or fail depending on the efficacy of our work. We are writing this letter to offer our help in fixing the issue. We are the only trade association that exclusively represents more than 75 premium publishers – arguably the world’s experts at creating real and trusted content.\nTo be clear, our plea is not that you somehow attempt to evaluate bias or censor legitimate speech. Moreover, your recent statements about potentially identifying “fake news” for what it is, and depriving the providers of this noxious material the economic sustenance to create it in the first place, are encouraging and constructive.\nHowever, to paraphrase a recent New York Times editorial, we believe you owe your users, and democracy itself, far more. Your companies make it a point to celebrate “moonshots” that require extraordinary vision, resources and engineering prowess. Your capacity to pursue these projects is built on your extraordinary dominance over the digital media landscape.\nWouldn’t it make sense for you to pursue cleaning-up the garbage littering the digital media ecosystem with the same excitement, investment and vigilance with which you pursue these huge, visionary projects? We don’t see that in your public statements or actions. Over the years, you have claimed repeatedly that you are not media companies; instead, the word “utility” has been used, occasionally by your own executives. But if even 1% of the water in our local utility was polluted, wouldn’t it be right to move heaven and earth to clean it up?\nOur members serve the public across the political spectrum. The last thing we would want is a litmus test for truth. We celebrate the fact that new, trusted brands can emerge online and truly allow the First Amendment to flourish. No one wishes to go back to a world of “gatekeepers” and distribution scarcity. It is for precisely this reason that you bear a special responsibility in society, one that you sometimes appear naïve to. Our brands are proxies for the kind of accuracy that your users deserve. We won’t reprise here the many examples of untruths that were propagated during the recent election campaign. We will simply state that our brands exist to guard against these outcomes, and that we all win when advertisers and consumers are served the highest quality content.\nIn a world where ever-increasing numbers of people get their news and information through globally scaled, algorithmically determined “feeds,” it is simply unacceptable to tolerate the blatantly false and misleading “fake news” that has come to litter the digital landscape. We regard our relationship as symbiotic; we all want the citizens of our societies to have access to the best possible information. We are in this together and regard our companies as essential partners in this effort. We are ready to devote time, resources and energy to help clean up this mess and welcome the opportunity to collaborate on solutions.\nYours truly, Jason Kint CEO Digital Content Next\nNOW WATCH: Elon Musk just unveiled something that could revolutionize how you power your home \n",

FORWARDED BY ERASMUS OF AMERICA – NOV. 22, 2016.\nTHIS ACCOUNT CAUGHT MY ATTENTION BECAUSE A FORMER ARMY DEMOLITION EXPERT REVIEWED A VIDEO RECORDING OF THIS 9/11 ATTACK I GOT FROM A SPECIAL SOURCE WHO GOT A FOREIGN FILMED VIDEO OF THE ATTACK AT THE TIME THE 9/11 ATTACK WAS GOING ON. THIS FORMER MILITARY DEMOLITION EXPERT COMMENTED THAT LOOK AT THE EXPLOSIVE POWDER BLOWING OUT FROM EACH FLOOR AND THEN IT WOULD DROP. HE SAID THAT THIS WAS AN OBVIOUS DEMOLITION JOB OF A BUILDING DONE BY AN ENGINEER WELL QUALIFIED TO DESTROY A LARGE BUILDING THIS WAY. HE SAID HE WOULD SAY THIS PRIVATELY BUT NOT SAY IT PUBLICLY AS HE WOULD BE SHORTLY MURDERED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO SILENCE HIM IF HE SAID THIS PUBLICLY BEFORE THE NATION.\nANOTHER FRIEND OF MINE HEARD HIS COMMENTS THE SAME TIME AS ME. SEPARATELY ANOTHER HEALTH SOURCE PERSON WAS LATER MURDERED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AFTER BEING TOLD TO SHUT HIS MOUTH UP ON SCANDALS OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IN WASH., D.C. HE SAID OVER THE PHONE TO US THAT THE F.B.I. HAD DELIVERED THIS MURDER THREAT TO HIM WHEN VISITING HIS HOUSE AT ROANOKE, VA. HE OFFICIALLY COMMITTED “SUICIDE” A COUPLE OF WEEKS AFTER REPORTING THIS FEDERAL MURDER THREAT TO US OVER THE PHONE.\nHIS HOUSE WAS SET UP SO IT WOULD LOOK LIKE HE HAD COMMITTED SUICIDE BUT WE KNEW HIS LIFE STYLE TOO WELL AND THEY DID NOT KNOW HOW HE REALLY LIVED AND MADE MISTAKES SHOWING HE WAS MURDERED IN HIS HOUSE AND HAD NOT COMMITTED SUICIDE. THE MAN LIVED DANGEROUSLY AND HAD JUST MADE FOUR THOUSAND COPIES (I THINK THAT WAS THE OFFICIAL FIGURE FOR COPIES MADE) OF A DVD WHERE HE EXPOSED CERTAIN DEADLY SCANDALS OF WASH., D.C. THESE DVD’S STORED IN HIS HOUSE ALL DISAPPEARED RIGHT AFTER HE OFFICIALLY COMMITTED “SUICIDE.”\nWE HAD ONE COPY OF HIS DVD NOT KNOWN THAT WE HAD AND MADE COPIES OF IT AND SOLD IT TO PEOPLE ACROSS AMERICA AFTER THAT. WE FIGURED THAT HIS MESSAGE SHOULD NOT BE BLOCKED FROM BEING RELEASED IN AMERICA BY HIS MURDER FROM YOU KNOW WHO! HE HAD ASKED ME TO BE A SOLE NATIONAL DISTRIBUTOR FOR THIS DVD A FEW WEEKS EARLIER AND I HAD ACCEPTED HIS OFFER.\nIN TURN I THINK I SHARED INFORMATION WITH HIM OF MY VIDEO SHOWING THE TWIN TOWERS AS THEY WERE BEING ATTACKED. I HAD PUBLICIZED EARLIER HAVING THIS VIDEO AND WANTED TO SEE IF THE GUILTY FEDERAL PARTY WOULD TRY AND STEAL IT FROM THE OFFICE IN MY HOUSE. THEY FELL FOR THE BAIT AND STOLE IT FROM MY HOUSE AND NOTHING ELSE! I THEN I RELEASED A NATIONAL MESSAGE THAT I HAD MORE COPIES BUT HAD HIDDEN THEM ELSEWHERE.\nI JUST WANTED TO SEE IF THE GUILTY PARTY WOULD TRY TO RETURN THIS VIDEO TO MY OFFICE AND BLOW THEIR IDENTITY FOR SURE BY TRYING TO RETURN TO MY OFFICE THIS STOLEN VIDEO LEGAL EVIDENCE CONCERNING THE TWIN TOWER 9/11. THEY TRIED TO RETURN IT TO MY OFFICE AND EFFECTIVELY BLEW THEIR COVER BY HOW THEY DID IT.\nAS I HAD ANTICIPATED, THE MISSING VIDEO SUDDENLY REAPPEARED IN MY OFFICE BUT IN A PILE OF VIDEOS WHERE i WOULD NEVER HAVE PUT IT. I HAD A SPECIAL SECTION FOR DOCUMENTARY VIDEOS LIKE THIS. THEY DID NOT KNOW MY SYSTEM AND PLACED IT COVERED UP BY A FEW VIDEOS OVER IT IN THE PILE OF VIDEOS I HAD THEN IN ONE LOCATION.\nBY A TRICK SYSTEM I WAS ABLE TO IDENTIFY THE THIEF AS C.I.A. TRYING TO COVER THEIR TRACKS. IF YOU WANT TO KNOW WHERE THE MISSING MASS GOLD IS STOLEN FROM THE WTC COMPLEX ON SEPT. 11, 2001 DURING THE TWIN TOWERS ATTACK IN NYC., ASK C.I.A. AS THEY SHOULD KNOW WHERE THEY MOVED IT TO AND WHO POSSESSES IT NOW!\n(I USED A SORT OF A SHERLOCK HOLMES TYPE BAITED TRAP TO FLUSH OUT THE GUILTY PARTY TO THE 9/11 ATTACK AND MASS THEFT OF THE GOLD STORED IN THAT AREA.) I MENTION THIS FIRST AND THEN SWITCH OVER TO THIS DVD WHICH EXPOSED FEDERAL CORRUPTION IN THE MEDICAL FIELD. SHOWN HERE NOW IS THE DVD THAT WASH., D.C. THOUGHT THAT THEY HAD STOLEN ALL COPIES OF. I GUESS THEY DID NOT LIKE BEING EXPOSED FOR BEING CORRUPT AS A GOVERNMENT IN THE NATIONAL HEALTH FIELD. WHEN ALIVE, DR. DAVID GARST GAVE ME REPRODUCTION RIGHTS TO THIS.\nI PLAN TO RELEASE STEADILY FEDERAL SCANDALS UNTIL I SEE THE RV OCCUR AND THE 800# GIVEN OUT FOR THE REDEMPTION CENTERS FOR THOSE WANTING TO EXCHANGE THEIR SPECIAL CURRENCIES IN FOR THE GCR GOING ON NOW. UNLESS I CHANGE MY MIND, I PLAN TO RELEASE AS THE NEXT NATIONAL SCANDAL HOW THE ROTHSCHILDS SET UP THE SO-LABELLED “CIVIL WAR” OF AMERICA BETWEEN NORTH AND SOUTH FOR THE SAKE OF BANKING PROFIT OFF OF IT AND TOOK THE PROFITS THEY MADE OFF OF THIS TEARING APART OF AMERICA INTO TWO NATIONS AND CONVERTED IT INTO 60 TONS OF PLACER GOLD TO SHIP OUT OF AMERICA.\nPLACER GOLD WOULD BE UNTRACEABLE ONCE IT LEFT AMERICA. I UNDERSTAND THAT 40 WAGON LOADS OF PLACER GOLD WERE GUARDED BY TWO ARMED MEN ON EACH OF THE 40 WAGONS. WHERE THE GOLD DISAPPEARED TO IS NOT RECORDED. IF THE SHOCKED ROTHSCHILDS WONDER HOW I KNOW ABOUT THIS ROTHSCHILD SECRET, I HAD ACCESS TO THE FINAL SECRET PAPERS OF THE CONFEDERATE INTELLIGENCE SERVICE AND KNOW THE ENTIRE STORY AS REPORTED BY CONFEDERATE INTELLIGENCE BEFORE IT FINALLY DISBANDED.\nWHEN TOUCHING ON THE ROTHSCHILD, I MAY INCLUDE THE STORY HOW THE ROTHSCHILDS USED PAID OFF ELEMENTS IN FRENCH ARMY INTELLIGENCE TO TRICK NAPOLEON INTO INVADING RUSSIA WHICH HE HAD NO PLANS OF DOING UNTIL TRICKED BY THE ROTHSCHILDS INTO INVADING RUSSIA BY FALSE INFORMATION THAT THE CZAR OF RUSSIA WAS PLANNING TO SHORTLY INVADE EUROPE TO OVERTHROW THE FRENCH EMPIRE NOW ESTABLISHED UNDER NAPOLEON BONAPARTE. AND MAYBE I SHOULD TELL HOW THE ROTHSCHILDS GOT VIRTUALLY ALL THE CZARIST GOLD OF RUSSIA BY ENGINEERING WORLD WAR I AND THEN FINANCING THE COMMUNISTS INTO POWER IN PRIOR CZARIST RUSSIA.\nIF I DON’T SEE THE RV AND 800# NUMBER SHORTLY FOR THE CURRENCY TRADE OF AMERICANS WHO ARE BEING SWINDLED I UNDERSTAND WHILE ROTHSCHILD ASSOCIATES AND FRIENDS ARE BEING ALLOWED TO EXCHANGE IN AMERICA FULL REAL VALUE ON ZIM NOTES, ETC. AND GET FAR MORE MONEY THAN LATER ZIM EXCHANGERS, ETC., I MAY RELEASE ALSO HOW THE ROTHSCHILDS FINANCIALLY SET UP HITLER TO TAKE OVER GERMANY AND START WORLD WAR II WHICH WAS ANOTHER SUPER FINANCIAL DEAL FOR THE ROTHSCHILDS TO FINANCE TO GET SUPER WEALTH FROM AMERICA AND OTHER NATIONS IN THE PROCESS. THEY START WORLD WARS, ETC. TO MAKE THEMSELVES SUPER RICH BY THE WARS THAT THEY SECRETLY ENGINEER AND FINANCE INTO OCCURRING DUE TO THEM.\nAND WHY NOT THROW IN AS A BONUS REPORT HOW THE ROTHSCHILDS SET UP THE WORLD DEPRESSION OF THE ‘THIRTIES AND CRASHED THE STOCK MARKET OF AMERICA IN ORDER TO GET MUCH OF THE RAW WEALTH OF AMERICA IN THE BARGAIN. AMAZING WHAT YOU CAN LEARN FROM SECRET MILITARY INTELLIGENCE RECORDS AND RARE HISTORICAL DOCUMENTS NEVER SEEN BY THE PUBLIC.\nSINCE ONE OF THE ROTHSCHILDS LONG AGO BOASTED TO ME THAT HE AND SOME ASSOCIATES WERE THE SECRET GOVERNMENT OF AMERICA AND USED WASH., D.C. AS THEIR FRONT TO GOVERN AMERICA WITHOUT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE EVER KNOWING THIS, I SUGGEST THEY GET ME OFF THE WARPATH AFTER THEM SO I CALM DOWN WITH THE RV AND #800 NUMBER FOR REDEMPTION AVAILABLE TO THE ORDINARY AMERICANS PROMISED THIS BUT NOT DELIVERED ON DUE TO IT SEEMS ROTHSCHILD INFLUENCE OVER THE GCR OF WORLD CURRENCIES.\nOH A MINOR POINT. THE ROTHSCHILDS MURDERED NAPOLEON BY I THINK IT WAS 20 OR MORE DOSES OF ARSENIC AS CONFIRMED BY A SWEDISH DOCTOR AS I RECALL WHO DID A FORENSIC EXAMINATION OF FOUR HAIRS FROM DEAD NAPOLEON TO FIND OUT THAT HE WAS MURDERED BY ROTHSCHILD ARRANGED POISONING. AND THE SON OF NAPOLEON WAS APPARENTLY ALSO MURDERED BY ROTHSCHILD POISON AS WELL AS ONE OF THE CZARS OF RUSSIA.\nI THOUGHT THAT THE PEOPLE OF FRANCE, RUSSIA, ETC. MIGHT NOT WANT THE ROTHSCHILDS TO OPERATE IN THEIR LANDS AFTER THIS. THE ROTHSCHILDS ALSO ARRANGED THE SINKING OF THE AMERICAN SHIP THE LUSITANIA IN 1915 TO GET AMERICA INTO WORLD WAR I AGAINST KAISER GERMANY. I GOT ACCESS TO SUPER SECRET BRITISH INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION THAT A BRITISH SUB SUNK THE LUSITANIA IN 1915 UNDER ROTHSCHILD INFLUENCE IN ENGLAND AND BLAMED THE SINKING ON A GERMAN SUB TO MAKE THE GERMANS LOOK BARBARIAN IN WARFARE AND THEREFORE JUSTIFIED TO WAR AGAINST.\nIF NO RV AND 800# QUICKLY FOR MY FELLOW AMERICANS AND I KEEP AFTER THE ROTHSCHILDS (AND THEIR ALLIES THE ROCKEFELLERS) UNTIL YOU HAVE NO PLACE LEFT TO HIDE ON EARTH FROM COMING WORLD JUDGMENT AGAINST YOU! BY THE WAY, SINCE I WAS ASKED TO GIVE MY WORD OF HONOR NEVER TO REVEAL THE NAME OF THE ROTHSCHILD I MET YEARS AGO IN THE WASH., D.C. AREA, I MENTION I MET WITH A ROTHSCHILD BUT NEVER IDENTIFY WHICH ROTHSCHILD I MET WITH! I ALWAYS KEEP MY WORD OF HONOR IN MILITARY INTELLIGENCE! THAT IS WHY SO MANY ELEMENTS IN MILITARY INTELLIGENCE ALWAYS TRUSTED ME!\nTHIS ROTHSCHILD BOASTED TO ME HOW HE AND ASSOCIATES SECRETLY CONTROLLED THE MAIN NEWS MEDIA OF AMERICA AND COULD BREAK NEARLY ANY POLITICAL LEADER IN AMERICA WHO DARED TO CHALLENGE THEIR CONTROL OVER AMERICA. AS HE BOASTED, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WERE TOO STUPID, TOO IRRESPONSIBLE, AND TOO MORALLY UNFIT(? BY WHAT RELIGIOUS STANDARDS DID HE MEAN THIS? HE DIDN’T SAY! ) TO GOVERN AMERICA, SO HE AND ASSOCIATES SECRETLY DID GOVERN AMERICA THROUGH WASH., D.C. AS THEIR FRONT! PASS THIS REPORT AROUND TO ALL AMERICANS. BREAK NEWS CENSORSHIP IN AMERICA WITH THE TRUTH FOR A CHANGE! I ALSO THINK THAT DONALD TRUMP WAS NOT CONTROLLED BY THEM AND INTENDS TO BE AN HONEST PRESIDENT IN AMERICA.\nYOURS FOR GOD AND COUNTRY, ERASMUS OF AMERICA (PEN NAME FOR AN AMERICAN ECONOMIST WHO STUDIED WITH SIX OF THE MOST BRILLIANT ECONOMISTS OF AMERICA AND EUROPE).\n On the afternoon of May 7, 1915, the British ocean liner Lusitania is torpedoed without warning by a German submarine off the south coast of Ireland.

But five years ago I helped blow up the WTC complex. I was paid a half million dollars, tax free, for my time and trouble. I don’t know what the rest of my crew was paid–maybe a little more, maybe a little less. Not that I care much. In operations like this one, where dozens and dozens of top technicians operated like a team, nobody knew the entire operation or who was who, or what everybody got paid—the big picture, as people call it. Better that way. Better that the left hand doesn’t know what the right hand is doing.\nLiving on the beach here in Cartagena, Columbia I’ve had lots of time to reflect. Lots more time to wonder. What surprises me most, however, is how very few intelligent people in America question the obvious signature of the crime, even after five years.\nHow did we do it and why did we do it? The absolute audacity and cleverness still surprises me. The planners knew that success was the only option and so they spent years, not months, designing the perfect plan. What you call murder, I call the perfect crime. What you call an act of terror, I call the perfect diversion.\nThe intelligent people who run your country know that America depends on a continuous supply of oil. They also know that Americans use far more oil than they can produce here in America. They also know that if anyone in the Middle East were allowed to sell oil for euros–which Iraq attempted to do and Iran is threatening to do—and thus break the monopoly of US petrodollars, America might just go down the tubes. At least that is how it was explained to me, one of the reasons we were doing what we were doing, in the weeks and months during our furious preparations.\nBut if the US was attacked by terrorists, however, by rogue clients of ME states, then America could retaliate, occupy their countries, insert puppet leaders like the Shah of Iran, and continue siphoning oil forever. And hundreds of people would make billions, while thousands of multinational companies–not just Halliburton–would profit immensely.\nAnd so America needed to be attacked.\nBut the attack needed to be spectacular. And the targets needed to be high image targets that represented America but was really stuff that could be rebuilt. Rebuilt at a profit. And so you saw the Pentagon targeted rather than the Congress building. Because Congress still needed someplace to meet and declare war against those nations that attacked America.\nMY job was to wire explosives inside the various WTC buildings. We wired buildings 1, 2, 6, and 7. We hardwired some areas and attached explosives and electronic detonators to many other key structural joints. We did this weeks in advance. WTC-7 fell in a classic controlled demolition (See example) but the Twin Towers required a lot more ingenuity. The fellow who planned the actual sequence of detonations is a genius. He was rumored to have been paid seven or eight figures and is a fucking master. Almost like a composer of a symphony orchestra but better. Much better.\nEntry into even the most secure areas of the WTC complex was easy. The badges and identifications were specially made. We had a guy at the top, an insider, who supplied the entry passes. We were the invisible people, those people who you see everyday but don’t see. We were the janitors and maintenance men you take for granted but who have far more access in your own building than you’ll ever have. Like I said, this whole operation was designed years in advance and took months to assemble the teams of top specialists. Then we worked weeks together to attack each key area of the plan. Like a builder using a blueprint.\nThose people who say it couldn’t be done, or only hijackers in airplanes could do it, really piss me off. Because we did it. For example, instead of building the Hoover Dam we took it down, piece by piece in a couple hours, and made each step look believable. Made it look like the dam just burst naturally.\nThe majority of ignorant people say, “fires brought the buildings down.” We just smile and say, yes they did. Most people don’t know that steel doesn’t melt from fuel fires but melted steel was found weeks later in the substructure of the WTC. Nobody seems to want to know how that happened to perfectly good steel. Most people don’t know thermite was used in World War II or that explosives and detonaters can be attached and then remotely detonated from blocks away in whatever sequence you choose. That was why when you watched the middle part of the towers explode–pancake down as the experts claimed—the upper parts of the twin towers were being simultaneously detonated as the lower parts were crumbling. If we hadn’t done that you would have seen 30 to 40 story segment sitting on the rubble pile.\nLike I said it was a work of genius.\nAm I sorry that almost 3,000 people got killed? Sure. Are you sorry that you, personally, use so much foreign oil? And are you sorry that all these faked resource wars have to be concocted so that you can get that oil and live comfortably? Didn’t think so.\nInvestigators on those TV crime shows, the CSI people, always try to understand who benefits by the bloody crime. If you understand that many people benefitted by 9-11, by the WTC destruction, then you are more than halfway to solving the crime. Not just who dunnit, but how dunnit and why dunnit.\nThe benefits of the plan were manifold. Everyone involved profited. The political zealots at the Pentagon got there holy war, or wars, that would benefit Israel while weakening the entire ME. The corporate–connected people got billions in new contracts. The military people got new toys.\nMeanwhile the more pragmatic planners assembled a team to start removing gold and silver from below building 4 as soon as the remote-controlled planes struck the towers. We had teams taking bullion from the vaults immediately before and after the towers fell. Miles of tunnels connected the complex. Teams had seven hours to remove as much bullion as they could. The falling towers, the smoke, the fires, the sirens, that was all a grand diversion going on in the streets above. Like I said the plan was designed to appear to be an Islamic terrorist attack yet functioned perfectly as an enormous, gigantic bank robbery. The biggest heist in history.\nWas I underpaid? Probably. But I was just one cog in this smooth functioning yet risky machine. Some internet blogger speculated that only 50-51 men could pull off this perfect crime, but I think it had to be several hundred experts involved.\nWho were we? Americans, Israelis, South Africans, Brits, Irish. All top specialists. The best of the best. Like that popular TV show, the Mission Impossible force, that was us. Quite a few former special forces, several top intelligence men, financial wizards, some foreign mercenaries, Israeli demo specialists, electronic specialists, security specialists. You name it.\nHow to keep everyone quiet, you ask? You heard the old saying, two can keep a secret if one of them is dead? Well a thousand can keep a secret if everyone is happy and everyone is very well paid. You also heard that old saying, honor among thieves? Well why would anyone want to rat on someone else? And even if one person got shitfaced drunk and bragged about bringing down the trade towers, who would believe him. After all, we all saw the hijacked jets crashed into the Trade Towers, right? And then we all saw that fuel fires weakened the steel and brought down those same towers, right?\nNo one will ever catch us. Who would investigate? Hugo Chavez? We commited the perfect crime and got away with it.\nBut like I said at the beginning, the crime was obviously a crime to anyone who even glanced at the pictures on the TV. It was so fucking obvious it still makes me laugh. What happened was a classic diversion. The towers fell; two or three ME countries were blamed. A suitable villain was fingered.\nBut you have hundreds of millions in stolen gold–did Osama steal it? You have those jackpot insurance claims on a pair of architecturel white elephants, leased only months before (giving us enough time to wire them). You have fake pilots that couldn’t fly, doing maneuvers in Boeing jumbo jets that were electronically programmed not to allow pilots to fly that way. You have FBI and CIA head honchos looking the other way. I could go on and on. But isn’t that what your real CSI people should be doing–but aren’t? Isn’t that what your real detectives should be doing–but aren’t?\nIf a farmer finds his henhouse raided by a fox, he tracks the fox through the snow and discovers the burrow and sees the feathers and the blood. Well, you’ve seen the feathers and the blood all over the people who planned 9-11 but still you can’t seem to put the pieces of this great crime together. Why is that?\nLongtime Rense writer, Douglas Herman wrote the suspense novel, The Guns of Dallas, that features a confessed hitman revealing the perfect scenario for the murder of JFK. The above scenario is fiction but probably far closer to the truth than anything yet offered in the so-called fact based media.\nDisclaimer\nEmail This Article\nMainPage\nhttp://www.rense.com\n9-11 Research: Missing Gold 911research. wtc 7.net/ wtc /evide nce/ gold .html class=”m_-7739053324556342539m_865906326255280033m_-6895019935192789052m_8385612468601726674m_4400763639026843566m_1132294251399365745m_-2091110228852382458m_8690815509066300825m_-5288894024393945674m_532410863193887618m_4165699528704093026gmail-m_1498728701567922943m_3012860993298411093gmail-m_-5607041474477211329gmail-m_8717054389042526951m_-2347847596881863058gmail-st” style=”line-height: 1.4; word-wrap: break-word;”>The basement of 4 World Trade Center housed vaults used to store gold and … ingold and silver that the Bank of Nova Scotia had stored in a vault under the … WTC 9-11 Biggest Gold Heist In History | 911justicehalifax https://911justicehalifax.wordpress.com/…/ -biggest - gold -heist-i…_-7739053324556342539m_865906326255280033m_-6895019935192789052m_8385612468601726674m_4400763639026843566m_1132294251399365745m_-2091110228852382458m_8690815509066300825m_-5288894024393945674m_532410863193887618m_4165699528704093026gmail-m_1498728701567922943m_3012860993298411093gmail-m_-5607041474477211329gmail-m_8717054389042526951m_-2347847596881863058gmail-action-menu m_-7739053324556342539m_865906326255280033m_-6895019935192789052m_8385612468601726674m_4400763639026843566m_1132294251399365745m_-2091110228852382458m_8690815509066300825m_-5288894024393945674m_532410863193887618m_4165699528704093026gmail-m_1498728701567922943m_3012860993298411093gmail-m_-5607041474477211329gmail-m_8717054389042526951m_-2347847596881863058gmail-ab_ctl” style=”display: inline; margin: 0px 3px; vertical-align: middle;”>n class=”m_-7739053324556342539m_865906326255280033m_-6895019935192789052m_8385612468601726674m_4400763639026843566m_1132294251399365745m_-2091110228852382458m_8690815509066300825m_-5288894024393945674m_532410863193887618m_4165699528704093026gmail-m_1498728701567922943m_3012860993298411093gmail-m_-5607041474477211329gmail-m_8717054389042526951m_-2347847596881863058gmail-st” style=”line-height: 1.4; word-wrap: break-word;”>Sep 16, 2012 – 9-11 WTC Biggest Gold Heist in History: $300 Billion in Bars Uploaded by GalaxyGarden on … How Much Gold Was Under WTC Complex?

      "text": "  \n(Facebook courtesy of Final Fantasy XV) Chocobos can be helpful allies inside 'Final Fantasy 15' \nChocobos have appeared in numerous \"Final Fantasy\" games, and these feathery creatures will again show up in \"Final Fantasy 15.\" \nSimilar to how they functioned in previous \"Final Fantasy\" titles, Chocobos can again act as reliable means of transportation inside the upcoming game. \nAccording to the Final Fantasy Wiki , the upcoming game's Chocobos will still be swift, majestic creatures, and just like before, they will be able to help players navigate through large areas quicker. \nUnfortunately, Chocobos will still not be able to take to the skies in \"Final Fantasy 15,\" but they can swim. Advertisement \nPlayers will not be able to raise their own Chocobos, but they can rent them for up to a month. \nPlayers still need to be careful whenever enemies are nearby while they are riding Chocobos, as these fluffy allies may run away all of a sudden and just leave Noctis and his friends. \nAside from being helpful travel buddies, the Chocobos in the upcoming game can also participate in races. \nVJump recently livestreamed some \"Final Fantasy 15\" gameplay footage that included Chocobo racing. DualShockers shared videos featuring the different Chocobo races as they appeared during the livestream, for those who were unable to catch the broadcast live. \nThe videos show that there appears to be a dedicated track for Chocobo racing, though it's unclear if there will be more than one. \nPlayers will also have to navigate through different obstacles as they make their way through the track. While racing, players will also be able to listen to an updated version of the familiar Chocobo racing soundtrack that long-time fans of the \"Final Fantasy\" franchise have likely heard before. \nIf nothing else, Chocobo racing looks like it will be fun, so players may want to give it a try as soon as \"Final Fantasy 15\" is released on Nov. 29.

Shocking code of conduct for girls at National Institute of Calicut: From ban on Whatsapp, Facebook to wearing tights and talking to boys! Girls in hostels have long been fighting for same curfew timings as men but National Institute of Calicut yesterday gave the girls students a new set of reasons to rebel against. By: FE Online | Published: November 23, 2016 7:46 PM The restrictions also bar women from wearing certain things and quite explicitly explain how the girl students should dress. The list prohibits women from wearing “transparent and short dupattas” and even “Patiala”. (Website) \nGirls in hostels have long been fighting for same curfew timings as men but National Institute of Calicut yesterday gave the girls students a new set of reasons to rebel against. The institute yesterday issued a code-of-conduct-circular for the girl students of the university. The fact that the circular was meant only for girls and not for the boy students speaks volumes about the mindset of the administration of the University. For a national level institute which offers professional courses, this act has shown what exactly is wrong with our education system – gender bias. \nAccording to a report by India Today, the list issued by the National Institute of Calicut includes controversial instructions which do not have anything to do with education and if anything only restricts ‘exposure’. In addition to “No mobile, pen drives, sim cards, etc” the list bars women from having an account on social media. It seems that the university believes that men students are distracted by the “lose hair” of girl students and hence have come up with restrictions like “No Lose Hair hairdo”, “No hair colouring” and “No designer watch appearing big in size and in different colours”. \nThe restrictions also bar women from wearing certain things and quite explicitly explain how the girl students should dress. The list prohibits women from wearing “transparent and short dupattas” and even “Patiala”. It includes “No Banyan cloth type pant”. Moreover, the list also restricts women to even talk to boys. \nHanz M Antony, a member of the Students Affair Council, in a facebook post said, “The matter has already been discussed with the concerned warden. The notice didn’t turn out the way they wanted to, was the answer”.  ",

Sorry There was an error emailing this page. China's Great Hall of the People. Credit: Michael Kan Related Facebook said to create censorship tool... \nFacebook has reportedly developed a software tool that will help keep certain content away from users’ news feeds in certain geographies, reflecting the company’s apparent willingness to meet Chinese government censorship demands part of the way. \nThe social networking site has been banned in China since 2009 because of the government’s censorship rules and like many other U.S. technology companies would like to reenter the market with nearly 1.4 billion people. \nCEO Mark Zuckerberg has learned Mandarin, visited the country often and cultivated the local leadership including President Xi Jinping. \nThe new tool suppresses posts from appearing to people in certain geographies but will not be used directly by Facebook, reported The New York Times on Tuesday , citing three current and former Facebook employees, who spoke on condition of anonymity as the tool is confidential. \nThe software will instead enable a partner, most likely a Chinese company, to monitor popular stories and topics across the social network, and who would “have full control to decide whether those posts should show up in users’ feeds.” \n+ ALSO ON NETWORK WORLD Gartner on doing business in China: Privacy? What’s that? + \nAt an internal event in July, Zuckerberg was asked about the controversial tool. “It’s better for Facebook to be a part of enabling conversation, even if it’s not yet the full conversation,” Zuckerberg said, according to the employees, NYT reported. \nThere is no indication that Facebook has offered the tool to the Chinese and like other experiments by the company, the tool could be shelved, the sources told the newspaper. \nFacebook is already facing criticism in the U.S. for fake news in its feeds in the run-up to the U.S. presidential elections. The social networking site has said more than 99 percent of content people see on the site is authentic, but the issue will probably lead to demands in some other countries for more controls and even censorship of social media. \nChina passed in November a new cybersecurity law that gives it greater control over the internet, including by requiring local storage of certain data and requiring any major company working in the country to be subject to \"security reviews\" by the Chinese government. \n“We have long said that we are interested in China, and are spending time understanding and learning more about the country. However, we have not made any decision on our approach to China,” a Facebook spokeswoman wrote in an email on Tuesday, when asked to comment on the NYT report. “Our focus right now is on helping Chinese businesses and developers expand to new markets outside China by using our ad platform,” she added.

Follow The Points Guy on Facebook and Twitter , and subscribe to text message alerts from our deals feed, @ tpg_alerts . \nAirfare deals are typically only available on limited dates. We recommend that you use Google Flights to find dates to fly, then book through an online travel agency, such as Orbitz or Expedia , which allows you to cancel flights without penalty by 11pm Eastern Time within one day of booking.

      "text": "By ANITA LEE - 11/23/16 11:59 AM \nGULFPORT, Miss. — Kenneth Smith went on Facebook at age 79 for selling kindling on the side of the road. Well, not really for selling kindling. \nSmith went online because he has worked hard all his life and continues to do so. He went online because he is a kind person who believes in showing respect to others. And because he’s had it hard lately but doesn’t complain. He just smiles and waves at everyone who drives by. \nHe’s sells kindling — heart pine precisely split into small pieces with his hatchet — for $5 a bag. The neighborhood folks have known Smith since he started selling wood last year at the corner of Carl Leggett and West Taylor roads. His wife, Helen, was with him then, even though she was suffering from cancer. \nShe died Oct. 29. The Smiths lived on Social Security. Mountains of medical bills during her two-year illness ate up their savings. \nHe was selling wood by himself Friday when a funeral procession passed. He took off his wide-brimmed straw hat, placed it over his heart and stood at attention in his Dickie overalls. \nJessica Pittman snapped a picture. She put it on Facebook Sunday. By lunch time Monday, the post had been shared 8,189 times and liked by almost 5,000 people. \nSmith’s son set up a GoFundMe page. The goal for the page was $10,000, but contributions exceeded $13,000 by 1 p.m. Monday. One of the donations was from Australia. \n“I mean, it went viral,” said Smith, who turns 80 Wednesday. “It overwhelmed me.” \nSmith has been working hard since he was in fifth grade, when his family moved here from Texas. His father bought 80 acres of land in Woolmarket, for $10 an acre, in the 1940s and they started building houses. Smith tried college for a year in Memphis, and he worked on the side as a carpenter. He spent his earnings to buy a car and come home. \nMost of his working life, he built houses for Carl Leggett. He met Helen, his second wife, at Snowden’s restaurant and lounge in Gulfport, his after-work “pit stop.” \nShe survived throat cancer 15 years ago, but the lung cancer got her. \nSo, he’s alone on the roadside, selling his kindling reaped from stumps. He feels a little bad about all the attention and donations. In addition to the GoFundMe account, people were stopping by Monday to give him money. Several people laid $100 bills on him. A car or truck stopped almost every minute. \n“I appreciate it,” he told the Sun Herald between customers, “but I didn’t come out here to be a panhandler.” \nNobody thinks he is, especially the neighbors who have gotten to know him when they stop for kindling. \nDavid Myrick said, “He’s just a wonderful, kind man.” They’ve been talking about him for a long time on a community Facebook page that Myrick belongs to, but it’s been private. \nMyrick said he stopped a couple of weeks ago and said to Smith, “This warm weather’s not helping you, is it?” \nSmith just smiled and said, “No, but that’s all right.” \nWith all the new business, Smith said he reckoned he better get home and chop up some more stumps.",

Facebook Reportedly Built a Censorship Tool With China in Mind Published   Facebook has developed but not offered software that would let a third party control which posts appear in users' feeds, according to a report. Credit: Facebook Most Popular \nFacebook is so keen to return to China that it built a tool that would geographically censor information in the country, according to the New York Times . \nWhile that may help the Chinese government get comfortable with Facebook, the company's re-entry may not happen for years, if at all, given licensing restrictions and other regulations that favor locally owned companies. China, which blocked the world's largest social network in 2009, has few incentives to allow the social network in. \nCEO Mark Zuckerberg visits China frequently, and yet the company is no closer to putting employees in a downtown Beijing office it leased in 2014, according to a person familiar with the matter. The company hasn't been able to get a license to put workers there, even though they would be selling ads shown outside the country, not running a domestic social network, the person said. The ad sales work is currently done in Hong Kong. The person asked not to be identified discussing private matters. Related Stories \nThe censorship software is among the many projects Facebook has initiated and may never be implemented, nor has it been used so far, according to the Times. \nThe report comes as Facebook is under scrutiny for the ways it does or does not control the flow of information and misinformation in users' feeds in the United States, following a presidential campaign where so-called \"fake news\" often spread quickly. \n\"We have long said that we are interested in China, and are spending time understanding and learning more about the country,\" a Facebook spokeswoman said in an e-mailed statement. \"However, we have not made any decision on our approach to China. Our focus right now is on helping Chinese businesses and developers expand to new markets outside China by using our ad platform.\" The company declined to comment on the New York Times report or its real estate interests. \nWhile China represents the biggest untapped market for Facebook, information and web access in the country is strictly controlled and allowing the social network in would raise the risks that unwanted news and views would spread. \nIt also faces entrenched opposition. Tencent Holdings Ltd.'s WeChat has more than 800 million monthly active users tapping into similar services to those offered by Zuckerberg's company. \nChina and Facebook aren't engaged in ongoing talks about the conditions of a return, according to a separate person familiar with the matter who asked not to be identified as the matter is private. The ability to censor content would be a precondition, not the deciding factor, in any entry to the Chinese market, the person said. \nThe New York Times said Facebook's tool would block content from appearing in the news feed. It would be provided to Chinese partners to help them censor content, the newspaper reported, citing unnamed current and former employees. Zuckerberg has supported and defended the effort, saying that it was better for Facebook to enable conversation in a country even if it's not the full conversation, according to the Times. \n-- Bloomberg News",

      "text": "Share on Facebook 8 Though he's often credited as one of the founding fathers of footwork, it's only in recent years that RP Boo has been given the recognition he deserves. While others like DJ Rashad and DJ Spinn have garnered a broader audience much more quickly, RP Boo's slow rise and acknowledgment is belatedly hitting its payoff. Tired of working day jobs and finally having enough knowledge of the craft to take on producing and DJing as a full-time gig, RP Boo's subsequent releases have been products of his mastery. The Ultimate is an album teeming with colourful samples and incomparable percussive programming. Sesame Street 's Pinball Number Count gets a makeover on \"Bang with the Funk,\" its vocal samples chopped and tossed while keeping the '70s funk bass line and original electric piano. Meanwhile \"What Am I\" brilliantly pulls from Jocelyn Brown's classic \"Somebody Else's Guy,\" her vocals absolutely shredded and layered into a distressing call as rapid-fire snares and frenetic hi-hats run across the track. This six-track EP is RP Boo's call of freedom, and it's a welcome one at that. ( Planet Mu ) Get It",

Christine Emba November 23 at 11:32 AM Follow christineemba Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg gestures while delivering an address at a 2014 conference in San Francisco. (Ben Margot/Associated Press) \nYour former high school classmate has pictures of a new baby, your aunt has video of her great vacation in Majorca, and your presidential candidate has several articles accusing her of killing an FBI agent for leaking emails. \nOne of these things is not like the others (hint: it’s the last one), but Facebook will share them all if it thinks they’ll please you. It will even promote them further if it thinks that other users will find them interesting as well. To the algorithms that control the site, what matters is the “connection” you make with others via these snippets of information. Whether that connection is based on something true is an entirely different question. \nIn the current kerfuffle over whether the fake news and misinformation that proliferated on the site might have influenced the outcome of the 2016 election, Facebook’s difficulty in acknowledging whether it’s simply a provider of pleasant connections or a public utility with real obligations has come to the fore. The criticisms have illuminated Facebook’s crisis of mission: profitable lifestyle platform or force for common good? More than a decade after its launch, its creator is still trying to figure out what it’s supposed to be — but it’s frankly irresponsible to remain undecided for much longer. [ Confirmed: Echo chambers exist on social media. So what do we do about them? ] \nAs originally conceived, Facebook’s value was limited. In its 2006 mission statement, the company claimed that its purpose was simply to “ connect people through social networks ,” providing an engaging, friendship-enhancing experience. It was a lifestyle site — its limitations on what could be shared revolved mainly around whether content made the site a welcoming space for users. \nAs the site has grown in size, however, its aspirations have changed. Yes, you can still see pictures of your former classmate’s baby (or not, if you don’t think she’s that cute), but you are also encouraged to share experiences and connect in a way that “makes the world more open” and changes society. Today, Facebook’s mission is to make the world more open and connected and to allow people “ to discover what’s going on in the world .” \nFacebook now bills itself as a force for good, and its influence and reach are defining aspects of its value proposition : Sparking a revolution in Egypt . Publicizing police brutality . Registering millions of users to vote . Connecting billions of Indians to the Internet (okay, that one didn’t work out, but the point is that it tried). When we think about how the company functions today and what it signals as its future aspirations, it’s clear that the social network is no longer just in the business of lifestyle-focused, surface-skimming connection. \nAfter all, Facebook is not Instagram, where the focus is on aesthetically pleasing images rather than activism. It’s not Snapchat, where impermanence and limited impact are core values. Nor is it Pinterest, a content-agnostic recipe clearinghouse. Today, 44 percent of American adults get their news from Facebook, a fact of which the company is well aware. [ Facebook may soon have more power over elections than the FEC. Are we ready? ] \nUnfortunately, taking responsibility for that fact is an unappealing prospect, and understandably so. As Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg said in a post on his own Facebook page, “identifying ‘the truth’ is complicated.” Acting as an arbiter of fact — an important role to play, but one nearly impossible to fulfill successfully — opens you up to criticism and anger, something Facebook experienced this year in its tiff with conservative groups over possible bias in its “trending topics.” \nAdvertisers may not like it when the company takes a seemingly partisan stand. Countries with restrictive regimes probably won’t either. Hiring editors and losing the ability to blame “algorithms” for mistakes would be unwieldy next steps for a company that would rather focus on growth, regardless of what that growth might bring. Drawing difficult lines may shape what Facebook can do in the future and potentially limit its reach. \nBut at this point, Facebook knows that it’s more than a platform for pleasantries or consequence-free connections. If it aims to be something larger — and clearly it does — it needs to consider the responsibilities of its new role and to put new values into action. \nRead more:",

      "text": "A graphic advertising the march from Facebook. By NICO SCAVELLA Tribune Staff Reporter nscavella@tribunemedia.net THE country’s two umbrella unions yesterday put their support behind the upcoming “Black Friday” protest, calling for Bahamians and workers throughout The Bahamas to come out and “display their displeasure” in the country’s current state of affairs. Trade Union Congress (TUC) President Obie Ferguson, along with National Congress of Trade Unions Bahamas (NCTUB) President John Pinder, who is also the president of the Bahamas Public Service Union (BPSU), called on workers to “make an effort” to be a part of the march in order to “demonstrate your rights as a Bahamian.” The two union leaders made their statements during a press conference in Rawson Square, which was attended by a number of representatives of various civic, religious, and environmental groups who put their support behind the upcoming march. The silent protest, titled “We March”, will begin at Arawak Cay at 1pm on Friday. From there, participants will walk to Parliament and remain there until 1am the following day. The event posted on Facebook has attracted significant support from activists and civic organisations, including environmental group Raising Awareness about the Bahamas Landfill (RABL). According to lead organiser Ranard Henfield, protests are also expected to be staged simultaneously in Grand Bahama, Abaco, as well as in New York and Toronto, Canada. The march will be broadcast via Periscope and Facebook Live, according to officials. “I’m inviting all members of the (BPSU) and our umbrella organisations and our NCTUB, all workers, to certainly make an effort to be a part of this march, to demonstrate your rights as a Bahamian,” Mr Pinder said. “Too often we allow the police department and governments to frighten us from our own constitutional rights, to be able to express ourselves. Our Constitution allows for the freedom of expression, and that’s all we want to do is express our concern for our country. “So I’m inviting all of our workers to come out and display your displeasure on how long it’s taken out government to correct these outstanding matters.” Mr Ferguson, during his remarks, not only called on Bahamians to support the march, but to also register to vote in the upcoming general election and “vote your interest.” “We will not support you to destroy us. We will not support you to strengthen those persons who try to oppress the average man. Four, five, six years before a trade dispute can be heard. So what the worker suppose to do? Ladies and gentleman, I’m asking the church, and every union in this land, and every worker who is not a part of a union, to be on that march on Friday. “Be out there, support the movement, support yourselves. Let us get registered, so when that polls open up, we will go to the poll, and we will vote for our interests. So I’m looking forward for all workers, whether you’re in the union, outside of the union, whether you support the union or not, these are basic rights for all of us.” Meanwhile, Mr Henfield, activist and founder of the Our Carmichael Community Initiative, called on the public to join the “movement.” Aside from the march, Mr Henfield said a massive voter registration drive will be conducted by the Parliamentary Registration Department in Rawson Square that same day. He also said his group will begin to form “focus groups” to “allow “persons after this march to come together, put our minds and brains together to find and put forth solutions.” “We must stand in solidarity and stop the individual efforts to fight our individual causes, and come together and say to any administration and any political hopeful, that the people deserve better and we want a Bahamas for Bahamians,” he said. “We want an administration that looks out for us, and we want a country that serves the betterment, the empowerment and the enrichment of Bahamians. “We are prepared to draft the legislation that Parliament has failed to draft in our interests. We are prepared to file court actions on behalf of the people, actions that the (Office of the) Attorney General has failed to file. So we are prepared to move forward, this is only stage one.”",

      "text": "Despite China's strict censorship of social media, Facebook seems eager to enter the country anyway. https://t.co/kfcJXifbJg pic.twitter.com/518bTO2zmn \n— Kenneth Roth (@KenRoth) October 24, 2016 \n\nFacebook is blocked in China, but that may change as its CEO Mark Zuckerburg tries to make inroads with the Chinese government. \nKnown for keeping a lid on dissident opinions, China has banned many Internet services from China such as Google, YouTube, Twitter and Instagram.\nHowever, the New York Times reported that Zuckerburg has strengthened ties with China’s president Xi Jinping, and has overseen the development of a tool unprecedented in its censorship abilities. While censoring online content is nothing new in other countries like Iran, the ability to censor news before it’s posted is on another level. Here are some other countries where US internet services have been censored ranked by population size: \nChina: 1.4 billion Pakistan: 182.01 million Vietnam: 90 million Egypt: 82.06 million Iran: 77.45 million The NGO Freedom House named China the “worst abuser of internet freedom” in its 2016 report .(Freedom House)\nBy far, China’s 1 billion plus population dwarfs that of other regimes who closely monitor and censor dissident activity. The most populous country in the world presents a big opportunity for Facebook as it seeks to expand its user base. The country could be worth hundreds of millions of dollars to Facebook, according to an LA Times report .\nHowever, some Facebook employees with concerns about the tool have left the company. The new tool would allow a third party -most likely a Chinese company – to monitor news topics trends and filter them based on location, according to the Times. Addressing the discontent surrounding the censorship tool at one of Facebook’s weekly meetings in July, Zuckerberg said, “it’s better for Facebook to be a part of enabling conversation, even if it’s not yet the full conversation.” \nFacebook employees warned that the tool may or may not be used. Furthermore, a Chinese regime that is resistant to change would likely roadblock Facebook’s outreach efforts. Still, the New York Times reports that several of China’s tech officers have warmed to the idea. By providing data on bubbling topics, the tool could extend the surveillance arm of the Chinese state. \nIt’s possible for people in China to access banned sites with a VPN. However, 56 percent of Chinese adults uses a social media service, according to internet consultancy network Kantar’s annual social media report . In 2013, China purged influential personalities on the popular Sina Weibo microblogging platform who made critical comments about the government. Since then, China has censored material on other microblogging platforms as WeChat, also known as Weixing. A law went into effect on 2015 November 1 that would sentence people who spread rumors on social media to 7 years in prison. \nOh, so Facebook has a tool ready so users in China would only be able to see fake news. https://t.co/epvHsQ0KZl \n— Chris Buckley 储百亮 (@ChuBailiang) November 23, 2016 \n\nFacebook has already come under fire for helping spread fake news, which some people believe influenced the 2016 presidential election. The censorship tool under development has called into question Facebook’s claim to create more open conversations. In September, Facebook was held accountable for blocking ‘Napalm Girl’, a Vietnam War-era photograph of a naked girl fleeing a Napalm attack. \nFacebook’s censorship tool appears as a way to appease an authoritarian regime. China has a long history of prosecuting political opponents and suppressing public opinion. Reports that individuals from XinJiang province planned an attack on Tiananmen Square – the location of a massacre of protests at the military’s hands in 1989- were c ensored by China’s internet censors in October of 2013.\nTake Our Poll Edward Cox is a Heavy contributor.
