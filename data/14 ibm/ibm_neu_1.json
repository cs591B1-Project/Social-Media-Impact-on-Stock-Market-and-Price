      "title": "Virtualization: A Tester’s Dream? - DZone DevOps",
      "text": "Virtualization has been around for a long time. As early as the 1960s, IBM was supporting virtualization on mainframes to ease the cost of migration among multiple generations of their systems. Languages like Pascal, Java, and C# translate into virtual machine languages that are then either interpreted or further compiled (“just in time compilation”) into actual machine code.\nShielding applications from the details of underlying configurations is still a driver for virtualization — in particular, the use of virtual machines. This has the added advantage of providing more efficient physical hardware use. For testers, virtual machines can be a game changer. To what degree the game really changes depends largely on how an organization decides to work with virtual machines and how active the testers themselves are in recognizing and leveraging virtual machines’ possibilities.\nVirtual machines often need to be requested from IT departments, essentially making a test team be at the mercy of IT’s request. A tester won’t be able to write a script to dynamically generate virtual machines from images, run tests on them, and bring them back down as effectively without access to the virtual machine. An IT department might dimension virtual machines on physical machines based on manual use, but an automated test is typically more demanding than a human user.\nAnother issue is that it is often hard to predict timing behaviors of virtual machines. Automated tests often rely significantly on timing. Virtual machines might be swapped out during an operation, which then can take longer than the automation expects. We see tests break on virtual machines that previously were always running stably on physical machines. To address this, make sure to use “active timing,” wait for something measurable, don’t use hard-coded sleeps, and do allow a high maximum wait threshold for your tests.\nManaging virtual machines and their images can become a job in itself — in particular when virtual machines are used at a large scale, such as to mimic the many configurations of the application under test. Work with a plan and have a designated person own it. Some questions to be answered involve what configuration you need to and run virtual machines, when to run them, and what hardware to run them on.\nAn exciting new wave of virtualization is containers. These are processes that have their own pre-defined environment — file system, libraries, and settings. The containers have been made popular by the open-source tool Docker, which allows them to be moved around and quickly instantiated and started on any machine. Organized this way, the containers form mini-virtual machines with sizes measuring in megabytes rather than the gigabytes that full-blown virtual machines need.\nThe natural use of containers is running servers in a service-oriented architecture (SOA). The containers give operations a great tool to organize configurations and run instances of the system and its components. For testers, containers make it easier to build and maintain environments that are functionally equivalent to production. These benefits work even better if an ambassador pattern is used for the containers. It allows for easy replacement of major service providers, such as databases or external REST services, by mock-ups. When you use action-based testing, you can even consider controlling the behavior of the mock-up with actions. You could use them to let the mock-up capture requests coming from the process under test and to generate predefined replies.\nVirtual machines and containers can offer a great deal of opportunities to testers, in particular for the operations side of their work. A well-thought approach with the support of all involved can be very helpful in achieving these benefits.\nThis article originally appeared in Techwell .",

      "text": "SHOW LESS Unconventional multi- and many-core processors (e.g. IBM (R) Cell B.E.(TM) and NVIDIA (R) GPU) have emerged as effective accelerators in trial climate and weather simulations. Yet these climate and weather models typically run on parallel computers with conventional processors (e.g. Intel, AMD, and IBM) using Message Passing Interface. To address challenges involved in efficiently and easily connecting accelerators to parallel computers, we investigated using IBM's Dynamic Application Virtualization (TM) (IBM DAV) software in a prototype hybrid computing system with representative climate and weather model components. The hybrid system comprises two Intel blades and two IBM QS22 Cell B.E. blades, connected with both InfiniBand(R) (IB) and 1-Gigabit Ethernet. The system significantly accelerates a solar radiation model component by offloading compute-intensive calculations to the Cell blades. Systematic tests show that IBM DAV can seamlessly offload compute-intensive calculations from Intel blades to Cell B.E. blades in a scalable, load-balanced manner. However, noticeable communication overhead was observed, mainly due to IP over the IB protocol. Full utilization of IB Sockets Direct Protocol and the lower latency production version of IBM DAV will reduce this overhead.",

      "text": "Anybody can ask a question Anybody can answer The best answers are voted up and rise to the top up vote 0 down vote favorite \nI've come across and old IBM BladeCenter S and I'm having issues with the SAS/RAID system: \nIs possible to update the firmware for an IBM SAS RAID Controller Module (from R1.07 to 1.3.1.010) without having to telnet into the RAID subsystem, as per IBM's instructions? \nI can both use the web interface and telnet into the SAS switch subsystem. But I can't connect to the RAID controller subsystem; all I get is: telnet: connect to address 192.168.70.139: Network is unreachable telnet: Unable to connect to remote host \nI did succeed once, but the connection was dropped whenever I tried to run a command. I have yet to replicate it since, and I don't know which module (one definitely has issues). \nI have restored everything to factory defaults (AMM, I/O modules, blades) and updated the firmware of everything else, but still no luck. \nThere's an option to update the firmware in the module's web interface, but I have yet to come across a download on IBM's site for this file, or find it among the files that the firmware update script creates ( ibm_fw_bcsw_s0cl-1.3.1.010_linux_noarch.sh ). \nI know that one of the two modules has issues (according to the previous owner) and it will not perform a firmware rollback via telnet (see code B). Whereas the other has no complaints. I have tried disconnecting both from the system in case either was interfering with the other module. \nCode A, version info: MAIN> raid ITEM STATUS",

      "text": "By Mary Bellis Updated February 01, 2016 . \nOn August 12, 1981, IBM introduced its new revolution in a box, the \" Personal Computer \" complete with a brand new operating system from Microsoft, a 16-bit computer operating system called MS-DOS 1.0. What is an Operating System \nThe operating system or`OS is the foundation software of a computer, that which schedules tasks, allocates storage, and presents a default interface to the user between applications. The facilities an operating system provides and its general design exerts an extremely strong influence on the applications created for the computer. IBM & Microsoft History \nIn 1980, IBM first approached Bill Gates of Microsoft , to discuss the state of home computers and what Microsoft products could do for IBM. Gates gave IBM a few ideas on what would make a great home computer, among them to have Basic written into the ROM chip. Microsoft had already produced several versions of Basic for different computer system beginning with the Altair , so Gates was more than happy to write a version for IBM. \ncontinue reading below our video Should I Buy my House or Continue to Rent? Gary Kildall \nAs for an operating system (OS) for an IBM computer, since Microsoft had never written an operating system before, Gates had suggested that IBM investigate an OS called CP/M (Control Program for Microcomputers), written by Gary Kildall of Digital Research. Kindall had his Ph.D. in computers and had written the most successful operating system of the time, selling over 600,000 copies of CP/M, his operating system set the standard at that time. The Secret Birth of MS-DOS \nIBM tried to contact Gary Kildall for a meeting, executives met with Mrs Kildall who refused to sign a non-disclosure agreement . IBM soon returned to Bill Gates and gave Microsoft the contract to write a new operating system, one that would eventually wipe Gary Kildall's CP/M out of common use. \nThe \"Microsoft Disk Operating System\" or MS-DOS was based on Microsoft's purchase of QDOS, the \"Quick and Dirty Operating System\" written by Tim Paterson of Seattle Computer Products, for their prototype Intel 8086 based computer. \nHowever, ironically QDOS was based (or copied from as some historians feel) on Gary Kildall's CP/M. Tim Paterson had bought a CP/M manual and used it as the basis to write his operating system in six weeks. QDOS was different enough from CP/M to be considered legally a different product. IBM had deep enough pockets in any case to probably have won an infringement case, if they had needed to protect their product. Microsoft bought the rights to QDOS for $50,000, keeping the IBM & Microsoft deal a secret from Tim Paterson and his company, Seattle Computer Products. Deal of the Century \nBill Gates then talked IBM into letting Microsoft retain the rights, to market MS-DOS separate from the IBM PC project, Gates and Microsoft proceeded to make a fortune from the licensing of MS-DOS. In 1981, Tim Paterson quit Seattle Computer Products and found employment at Microsoft. \n\"Life begins with a disk drive.\" - Tim Paterson",

      "text": "A recent spate of potent anti-tumor drugs, from ones that target cancers like smart bombs to ones that work with the body’s immune system, have excited cancer doctors. But one fact has tempered their enthusiasm; given enough time, most cancers find a way to become resistant to the drugs, rendering them powerless and causing patients to relapse. The danger is that these doctors will have nothing more to throw at the disease.\nResearchers at the Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT are hoping to solve that problem by teaming up with IBM Watson Health to find answers that only reams of data can provide. The mission is to sequence the genomes of tumors from thousands of patients who have different kinds of cancer—first when they are diagnosed, then again when they stop responding to drugs that initially worked in controlling their disease. The data will allow scientists to find patterns of genetic changes in the tumors that might signal resistance and help them identify people who are at higher risk of developing resistance early on. That would allow them to prescribe different combinations of drugs that would bypass the resistance and give patients a better chance at remission.\nThe data will also help researchers figure out why some people fail to respond to certain drugs in the first place, and guide them to better-tailored treatments.\nSign up for and more view example “This is a genetic chess game with cancer,” says Eric Lander, founding director of the Broad Institute. “We make a move by applying a drug. Cancer makes a counter move. We need to know what that counter move is in order to think about what our second response might be. Eventually, we’re going to know all of its moves.”\nThe data will be made available publicly for the research community so cancer scientists can study it and contribute new insights in fighting cancer drug resistance. In order to generate as much genetic data as possible, the project will use the latest way of accessing a tumor’s genome: through the fragments of DNA it sheds into the blood. While still new, Broad’s Todd Golub says the “performance of blood biopsies is quite similar to that of biopsy material.” It has the added advantage of not requiring an invasive procedure in an hospital. For the study, participants don’t have to be located near one of the collaborating centers to provide genetic material.\n“The long-term vision is that a patient will come to the doctor, have the tumor analyzed and based on that analysis, know what caused the cancer,” says Golub. “The doctor will know what drug to use and anticipate what mechanisms that tumor will likely use to become resistant. So rather than wait for it to become resistant, the doctor can treat with a combination for drugs that cuts off that resistance at the pass. This project is laying the foundation for what those paths are.”",

      "text": "\nA recent spate of potent anti-tumor drugs, from ones that target cancers like smart bombs to ones that work with the body’s immune system, have excited cancer doctors. But one fact has tempered their enthusiasm; given enough time, most cancers find a way to become resistant to the drugs, rendering them powerless and causing patients to relapse. The danger is that these doctors will have nothing more to throw at the disease.\nResearchers at the Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT are hoping to solve that problem by teaming up with IBM Watson Health to find answers that only reams of data can provide. The mission is to sequence the genomes of tumors from thousands of patients who have different kinds of cancer—first when they are diagnosed, then again when they stop responding to drugs that initially worked in controlling their disease. The data will allow scientists to find patterns of genetic changes in the tumors that might signal resistance and help them identify people who are at higher risk of developing resistance early on. That would allow them to prescribe different combinations of drugs that would bypass the resistance and give patients a better chance at remission.\n\nThe data will also help researchers figure out why some people fail to respond to certain drugs in the first place, and guide them to better-tailored treatments.\n“This is a genetic chess game with cancer,” says Eric Lander, founding director of the Broad Institute. “We make a move by applying a drug. Cancer makes a counter move. We need to know what that counter move is in order to think about what our second response might be. Eventually, we’re going to know all of its moves.”\nThe data will be made available publicly for the research community so cancer scientists can study it and contribute new insights in fighting cancer drug resistance. In order to generate as much genetic data as possible, the project will use the latest way of accessing a tumor’s genome: through the fragments of DNA it sheds into the blood. While still new, Broad’s Todd Golub says the “performance of blood biopsies is quite similar to that of biopsy material.” It has the added advantage of not requiring an invasive procedure in an hospital. For the study, participants don’t have to be located near one of the collaborating centers to provide genetic material.\n“The long-term vision is that a patient will come to the doctor, have the tumor analyzed and based on that analysis, know what caused the cancer,” says Golub. “The doctor will know what drug to use and anticipate what mechanisms that tumor will likely use to become resistant. So rather than wait for it to become resistant, the doctor can treat with a combination for drugs that cuts off that resistance at the pass. This project is laying the foundation for what those paths are.”\n",

      "title": "What's The Value Of IBM's 'Strategic Imperatives' Segment?",
      "text": "The reason IBM stock is mispriced. \nIBM is shifting its resources to the \"Strategic Imperatives\" segment. \nDeclining revenue is pushing investors to neglect the growth side of IBM. \nWhat is the intrinsic value of the \"Strategic Imperatives\" segment? \nWith a $147 billion market cap and price/revenue ratio of just 1.84, the lowest among tech giants, it seems investors are not buying IBM's (NYSE: IBM ) story of growth transition. I don't see a reason for this - after all numbers talk. \nIBM's third quarter cloud revenue was $3.4 billion, higher than the $3.2 billion figure AWS recorded. However, analysts and investors are rewarding cloud sectors for companies like Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) with high multiples, while neglecting IBM's cloud, punishing it with utility like multiples. \nI believe that \"IBM Facing Revenue Decline\" headline is pushing investors to focus on the empty side of the glass while missing the valuable growth part of the company. \nIn this article, I will try to get an approximate valuation of IBM's \"Strategic Imperative\" segment - by valuing each segment as a standalone company. But first, I will give a quick justification for why IBM stock is mispriced by investors. \nWhy IBM stock is mispriced. \nAll those following IBM know the main driver of its stock price fall - decreasing revenue. Although revenues managed to stabilize in the last four quarters, accompanied with IBM shifting its focus into promising sectors, multiples (like low PE ratio) show investors are valuing IBM as a no-growth stock. \nThis shows investors' skepticism about the transition, postponing any move into the stock until the sky is clear. Personally, I believe in IBM's ability to transform itself. After all, we are talking about a tech company that was founded more than 100 years ago, and managed historically to follow tech frenzies effectively. \nHowever, investing in a company facing transformation is a risky bet. Especially when the sector it is transforming intois facing intense competition from players with deep pockets. In case IBM failed in its growth strategy, its stock can be \"extremely\" damaged, since its valuation will be based entirely on revenue declining sectors. \nBut in case IBM succeeded in its mission, how should the market value the \"growth\" sector? Let's see. \nValuing IBM cloud \nSince most companies don't disclose specific metrics regarding cloud operations, like net profit margins and in IBM's case operating margins, we can't precisely value the cloud segment. Thus, the most suitable way is to use the only available data - revenue. \nTo value the cloud business, take Nutanix (NASDAQ: NTNX ) and Salesforce (NYSE: CRM ) as comparables. Both companies are valued at an average of 7 times revenue. Apply this multiple on IBM's $12 billion trailing cloud revenue, and the cloud segment's value will be around $84 billion. That's 57% of IBM's current market cap. \nThis doesn't take into consideration IBM's moat, which is characterized by having the smartest machine ever built, Watson. Watson only works on IBM cloud. This will give the sector a competitive advantage by providing incentives for financial institutions especially to subscribe for the service. \nThat's because IBM is planning to provide Watson with the capability to help financial institutions in escalating regulations, risk management and searching for investment opportunities. And by the \"Machine Learning\" process, Watson is expected to increase its performance through time. \nIn addition, I believe that IBM's long dated relations with big businesses will strengthen its position to steal market share from other cloud competitors. \nValuing Analytics, Mobile and Security. \nI will apply the same methodology to other \"Strategic Imperatives\" segments. \nAnalytics: This is IBM's biggest source of revenue in the \"Strategic Imperatives\" segment, having more than $15 billion in trailing revenue. IBM Analytics helps organizations uncover insights that improve business operations and suggests ideas that can boost performance. In this sector, the German company Accenture (NYSE: ACN ) is considered a strong competitor, having $34 billion in annual revenue. Accenture has a price/sales ratio of 2.27. Apply this multiple on IBM's $15 billion trailing analytics revenue, and the segment's value will be around $34 billion. \nMobile and Security: Both segments contribute to only 21% of \"Strategic Imperatives\" revenue. The segment generated only ~$5 billion in trailing revenue, but with an average increase of 15% yr/yr and an expected market of $170 billion for cyber security in 2020, the company is expecting huge increase in segment's revenue. Fortinet (NASDAQ: FTNT ) is IBM's closet public competitor. Fortinet has a price/sales ratio of 4.49. Apply this multiple on the $5 billion revenue for IBM M&S segments, and both will have a value of $22 billion. \nConclusion \nAdding the parts, the \"Strategic Imperatives\" segment will be valued at $140 billion. That's close to 100% of IBM's current market cap. So the market is only valuing IBM based on this segment only, although \"SI\" contributes only to 40% of IBM's total revenue. Thus, buying IBM stock at these levels will give you the other segments for free. Not to forget that these segments, like \"Systems\" for example, are still profitable with high profit margins (7.8% profit margin for the \"Systems\" segment). In addition, you will also get Watson for free, since the metrics previously used doesn't take into account this competitive advantage in having the smartest machine ever built. I recommend buying IBM shares at these levels, but of course risks lies in management ability not to monetize Watson as expected. And to be honest, I'm skeptical about Rommety's capability in running the company effectively. The company needs fresh blood, and I would be more than happy to see a management change in IBM.

      "text": "Best Low-P/E Tech Stocks to Buy in November IBM, Baidu, and Apple are all trading at discounts to the overall market. Leo Sun ( TMFSunLion ) Nov 11, 2016 at 8:21AM \nWith the market near all-time highs, it can be tough to find \"cheap\" tech stocks worth starting new positions in. However, three well-known tech stocks -- IBM ( NYSE:IBM ) , Baidu ( NASDAQ:BIDU ) , and Apple ( NASDAQ:AAPL ) -- all still trade at steep discounts to the S&P 500's P/E of 23 and their industry averages. Let's take a look at why investors don't seem interested in these three tech giants, and why they could be great long-term plays at current prices. Image source: Pixabay. IBM \nIBM currently trades at 13 times trailing earnings, which is much lower than the average P/E of 21 for the IT services industry. IBM's 13% gain has outperformed the S&P 500's 4% gain this year, but that rally was likely fueled by its 3.7% forward yield in a low interest rate environment instead of any notable strengths in its business. IBM has hiked its dividend, which is comfortably supported by its payout ratio of 44%, for 16 consecutive years. \nBig Blue's main problem is its lack of revenue growth. Its quarterly revenue has fallen year-over-year for 18 consecutive quarters due to rising competition and sluggish enterprise demand for its aging IT services, software, and hardware. IBM's core strategy is to offset those declines with its higher-growth \"strategic imperatives\" (cloud, analytics, mobility, social, and security) businesses. Revenue from those businesses rose 16% annually to $8 billion last quarter, and accounted for 40% of IBM's trailing-12-month revenue. Unfortunately, that growth didn't fully offset the weakness of its other businesses, which caused its total revenue to dip 0.4% annually. \nLooking ahead, IBM's painful shift away from older products toward higher-growth ones should eventually pay off. Analysts still expect IBM's revenues to fall through 2017, but its earnings -- boosted by buybacks and a shift toward higher-margin services -- should improve 3.5% next year. It's a long road back for IBM, but its low multiple and high dividend should set a floor under the stock. Baidu \nBaidu, China's largest search engine, trades at just 13 times trailing earnings, which is much lower than the industry average P/E of 50 for internet information providers. Shares of Baidu have slumped 9% this year due to concerns about its spending and new regulations for its ads. \nTo remain competitive in the rapidly evolving Chinese internet market, Baidu has been adding O2O (online-to-offline) features -- like mobile payments, ride hailing, ticket bookings, and restaurant reservations -- to its core app. These investments are expected to cause its earnings to decline 12% this year. \nBaidu's top line has been weighed down by more strict regulations regarding ads for healthcare services and pharmaceutical products. The sale of its stake in online travel agency Qunar to Ctrip further distorted year-over-year comparisons. As a result, Baidu's revenue is expected to rise just 6% this year, compared to 35% growth in 2015. But looking further ahead to 2017, Baidu is expected to post 21% sales growth and 33% earnings growth as its O2O investments start paying off. Apple \nDespite being the most valuable company in the world by market cap, Apple trades at just 13 times trailing earnings -- a discount to the industry average of 17 for electronic equipment makers. The stock has barely outperformed the S&P 500, with a 5% gain this year, mainly due to ongoing concerns about sales of the iPhone, which generated 60% of the company sales last quarter. Image source: Apple. \nShipments of iPhones, iPads, and Macs all fell annually last quarter, causing Apple to post its first year-over-year revenue decline since 2001. Apple's response has been to diversify its hardware business with the Apple Watch, and its services business with Apple Music, Apple Pay, and other software platforms. But these businesses still only generate a small portion of the tech giant's overall revenues. \nBut looking ahead, Apple still has plenty of cash to spend on acquisitions, buybacks, and dividends to keep investors interested. New acquisitions could reduce the weight of its hardware business and give Apple new pillars of growth. Buybacks could boost its earnings growth, and its forward yield of 2% (supported by a low payout ratio of 26%) could easily be doubled to attract income investors. It's tough to see what comes next for Apple, but I certainly wouldn't bet against the tech giant's long-term prospects. Patience pays off... \nInvestors should remember that stocks generally have low P/Es because investors aren't eager to buy them. However, investing in companies with sound long-term growth prospects while their stocks are at low multiples could pay off over the long run. There's no guarantee that investors will suddenly fall in love with IBM, Baidu, or Apple again, but I believe the potential rewards outweigh the risks at their current prices. \nLeo Sun has no position in any stocks mentioned.

      "text": "Better Buy: Hewlett Packard Enterprise vs. IBM newsfeedback@fool.com (Leo Sun) Updated 5 min ago \nHewlett-Packard Enterprise (NYSE: HPE) and IBM (NYSE: IBM) have been major rivals in the enterprise hardware and software markets for decades. Both stocks are also considered slow-growth \"mature\" tech plays owned for stability instead of growth. Let's take a closer look at these two tech giants to see which is the better long-term buy at current prices. Image source: Getty Images. Understanding HPE's business model \nHPE split with HP Inc. (NYSE: HPQ) , which retained HP's PC and printing businesses, late last year. HPE generates most of its revenue from four main divisions -- the enterprise group (51% of revenues last quarter), enterprise services (37%), software (6%), and financial services (6%). \nThe enterprise group unit provides IT infrastructure solutions, the enterprise services unit provides IT consulting services, the software unit provides automated IT solutions, and the financial services unit provides financing options and scalable IT solutions like consumption-based pricing. \nEven before splitting with HP, HPE focused on downsizing its businesses. In a stunning move, it exited the competitive public cloud market last October. Earlier this year, HPE announced plans to spin off and merge its struggling IT services unit with Computer Science Corp. (NYSE: CSC) in an $8.5 billion deal. In September, it announced it would also spin off and merge \"non-core\" assets like application delivery management, big data, and enterprise security with Micro Focus International in an $8.8 billion deal. \nThose spinoffs, along with other cost-cutting measures, resulted in hundreds of layoffs. However, HPE is still making strategic acquisitions of higher-growth, data-driven businesses like supercomputer maker SGI, which it recently acquired for $275 million. Understanding IBM's business model \nIBM's top line is split between five units -- cognitive solutions (22% of revenues last quarter), global business services (22%), technology services and cloud platforms (45%), systems (8%), and global financing (2%). \nCognitive solutions include its solutions software and transaction processing software; global business services cover its IT consulting services, global process services, and application management; and tech and cloud platforms include its infrastructure services, tech support, and integration software. Systems include its high-end servers, mainframes, and OS software, and the financing arm handles financing and used product sales. \nLike HPE, IBM has been streamlining its business by divesting slower-growth units like its desktop PC, low-end server, and chipmaking businesses. But unlike HPE, IBM is more aggressively focused on bulking up its higher-growth \"strategic imperatives\" businesses (cloud, analytics, security, mobility, social) with acquisitions. Big Blue has already acquired a dozen companies in 2016 to strengthen those businesses -- which posted 16% annual sales growth last quarter and accounted for 40% of its trailing-12-month revenue. How fast are HPE and IBM growing? \nHPE and IBM are both struggling to grow their top lines amid sluggish enterprise spending, currency headwinds, and tough competition from nimbler rivals. HPE's sales fell 6.5% annually last quarter, and analysts expect its revenues to fall 1% next year. IBM has reported 18 consecutive quarters of year-over-year sales declines, and analysts expect its revenue to fall about 2% this year and another 0.3% next year. \nBut on the bottom line, HPE's earnings are expected to improve 4% this year and 7% next year thanks to aggressive cost-cutting measures, divestments, and buybacks. IBM's earnings are expected to fall 10% this year, due to a drastic reduction in buybacks and higher investments in its strategic imperatives, but possibly rebound 3% next year. Which stock is a better income play? \nHPE returned $2.9 billion to shareholders -- mostly through $2.7 billion in buybacks -- during the first three quarters of the year. HPE believes its cash position in fiscal 2017 will be strengthened considerably by over $1 billion in cash and debt transfers from CSC and a $2.5 billion cash dividend from Micro Focus. This means its current forward yield of 1%, which pales in comparison to HP's 3.3% yield, might get a big increase next year. \nIBM returned $6.6 billion to its shareholders over the past three quarters with $4 billion in dividends and the rest in buybacks. Big Blue currently pays a forward yield of 3.6%, and it has hiked that dividend annually for 16 years. The valuations and the verdict.... \nHPE currently trades at 10 times earnings, which is lower than IBM's P/E of 13 and the industry average of 21 for IT services providers. HPE also has a P/S ratio of 0.7, which is much lower than IBM's P/S ratio of 1.8. \nIt's a close call, but HPE's more streamlined business model, stronger earnings growth, and lower valuation make it a more compelling buy than IBM. IBM remains a solid income play for conservative investors, but I believe its stock currently has less upside potential than HPE's. \nA secret billion-dollar stock opportunity \nThe world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology. And we think its stock price has nearly unlimited room to run for early, in-the-know investors! To be one of them, just click here . \nLeo Sun has no position in any stocks mentioned.

      "title": "CDI-JSF: Using the CDI @Observes",
      "text": "Learn more about the advantages of moving from a monolithic to microservices architecture .   IBM . In this post, we will discuss using the CDI @Observes in a JSF application. Basically, we will exploit the fact that Java EE provides an easier implementation of the observer design pattern via the @Observes annotation and javax.enterprise.event.Event<T> interface. Note In the bellow examples, we will use CDI managed beans, but you can use EJB 3 beans also. Basically, the observer pattern is based on a subject and some observers : Subject : an object that changes its state. Observers : objects notified when the subject has changed its state. This time, the subject is a CDI managed bean named, MainFireStationBean: @Named @RequestScoped public class MainFireStationBean { @Inject Event<String> evt; public void fireStarted(String address) { evt.fire(address); } } The container injects an Event object of type String into the evt instance variable of the MainFireStationBean class (practically, this String represents the fire address). To activate an event, call the javax.enterprise.event.Event.fire() method. This method fires an event and notifies any observer methods ( observers ). Now the observable part is completed, so it is time to create the observers that listens for our String events. In Java EE, the observers are marked with the @Observes annotation. The addition of the @Observes annotation to the method signature instructs the container that this method should act as an observer of events of the type it precedes. We have three observers, ViningsFireStationBean, BrookhavenFireStationBean, and DecaturFireStationBean: @Named @Dependent public class ViningsFireStationBean { public void update(@Observes String arg) { System.out.println(\"Vinings fire department will go to \" + arg); } } @Named @Dependent public class BrookhavenFireStationBean { public void update(@Observes String arg) { System.out.println(\"Brookhaven fire department will go to \" + arg); } } @Named @Dependent public class DecaturFireStationBean { public void update(@Observes String arg) { System.out.println(\"Decatur fire department will go to \" + arg); } } So, the @Observes annotation precedes the type String and thus listens for events of that type. The @Observes annotation followed by an object type instruct the container with all the needed information. In order to test it, we just need to report some fires. We can do this in several ways, but let's do it quickly via two JSF buttons: <h:form><h:commandButton value=\"Report Fire at Home Park Atlanta\" action=\"#{mainFireStationBean.fireStarted('Home Park Atlanta, GA')}\"/><h:commandButton value=\"Report Fire at High Museum of Art\" action=\"#{mainFireStationBean.fireStarted('High Museum of Art 1280 Peachtree St NE Atlanta, GA 30309')}\"/></h:form> If we suppose that the Report Fire at Home Park Atlanta button was pressed then the output will be: Decatur fire department will go to Home Park Atlanta, GA Vinings fire department will go to Home Park Atlanta, GA Brookhaven fire department will go to Home Park Atlanta, GA So, everything works as expected. The complete example is available here . One step further and we will want to differentiate between the same object types of objects and set up different observers to listen for them. For example, we may need to distinguish between small fires and big fires. Depending on this aspect, a local fire station may send to the fire address one fire truck or multiple fire trucks. We can model this case via a qualifier: @Qualifier @Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME) @Target({ElementType.FIELD, ElementType.PARAMETER}) public @interface FireType { Type value(); enum Type { SMALL, BIG } } The two enum types (SMALL and BIG) will be used to act as annotation to mark the strings to be fired by the event instances. So, the MainFireStationBean will be: @Named @RequestScoped public class MainFireStationBean { @Inject @FireType(Type.SMALL) Event<String> small; @Inject @FireType(Type.BIG) Event<String> big; public void fireStarted(String address, boolean t) { if (t) { small.fire(address); } else { big.fire(address); } } } Finally, add the annotations to the observer part: @Named @Dependent public class ViningsFireStationBean { public void updateSmallFire(@Observes @FireType(FireType.Type.SMALL) String arg) { System.out.println(\"Vinings fire department will go to a small fire at \" + arg); } public void updateBigFire(@Observes @FireType(FireType.Type.BIG) String arg) { System.out.println(\"Vinings fire department will go to a big fire at \" + arg); } } @Named @Dependent public class BrookhavenFireStationBean { public void updateSmallFire(@Observes @FireType(FireType.Type.SMALL) String arg) { System.out.println(\"Brookhaven fire department will go to a small fire at \" + arg); } public void updateBigFire(@Observes @FireType(FireType.Type.BIG) String arg) { System.out.println(\"Brookhaven fire department will go to a big fire at \" + arg); } } @Named @Dependent public class DecaturFireStationBean { public void updateSmallFire(@Observes @FireType(FireType.Type.SMALL) String arg) { System.out.println(\"Decatur fire department will go to a small fire at \" + arg); } public void updateBigFire(@Observes @FireType(FireType.Type.BIG) String arg) { System.out.println(\"Decatur fire department will go to a big fire at \" + arg); } } Now, let's report a big fire and a small fire: <h:form><h:commandButton value=\"Report a Small Fire at Home Park Atlanta\" action=\"#{mainFireStationBean.fireStarted('Home Park Atlanta, GA', true)}\"/><h:commandButton value=\"Report a Big Fire at High Museum of Art\" action=\"#{mainFireStationBean.fireStarted('High Museum of Art 1280 Peachtree St NE Atlanta, GA 30309', false)}\"/></h:form> In case of a small fire, the output will be: Brookhaven fire department will go to a small fire at Home Park Atlanta, GA Vinings fire department will go to a small fire at Home Park Atlanta, GA Decatur fire department will go to a small fire at Home Park Atlanta, GA Note that in case of your own object types, you don't need qualifiers. Since the object type is unique, you can fire/observe your own object types by using the object.

      "text": "Slide: 1 / of 2 . Caption: IBM Research \nSlide: 2 / of 2 . Caption: IBM Research Author: Klint Finley. Klint Finley Business   IBM Is Using Tiny Tubes to Grow the Chips of the Future IBM Research \nThe reign of silicon may be coming to an end. For years, researchers and entrepreneurs hoped that carbon nanotubes would revolutionize microchip design. These tiny, molecular-level structures could, in theory, be used to make chips that are six to ten times faster than today’s silicon-based variety—and use far less electricity. \nIn addition to faster, more efficient chips for laptops and smartphones, tiny but powerful processors could enable new types of technology, such as bendable computers and injectable microchips, or nano-machines that could target cancers in the body. \nNow a team of IBM researchers say they’ve made a breakthrough that brings the nano-dreams of the past closer to reality. \nThe problem with nanotubes has always been their size. By definition, nanomaterials are incredibly small, which makes them incredibly hard to work with. Traditionally chip makers take a piece of silicon and essentially carve it into what they want–not unlike the way sculptors take slabs of stone and chisel them into the shapes they want. Chiseling patterns into carbon nanotubes, however, has proven incredibly difficult. IBM Research \n“The analogy I use is that it’s like building a statue out of a pile of blocks,” says IBM Research materials scientist George Tulevski, who will explain the new process tomorrow at TED@IBM. “You can’t place these nanotubes one by one into the pattern you want.” \nInstead, Tulevski and his team have figured out a way to “coax” the nanotubes into specific structures using chemistry. Instead of a “top-down” approach of trying to place each block manually, the team is treating the nanotubes with chemicals that cause them to assemble themselves into new structures. It’s a bit more like growing a crystal than carving a statue. \n“We’re trying to tackle that problem by borrowing from nature, because nature builds everything that way,” Tulevski says. “We think that’s one of the key missing pieces.” \nNanotechnology, a darling of 1980s and `90s science fiction, has been making something of a comeback in recent years. Tulevski’s breakthrough follows another milestone passed by IBM Research last year when a team developed a new way to pack more carbon nanotube transistors into a smaller space. Meanwhile, companies like Nanotronics Imaging have developed microscopes that could make it easier to manufacture nano-scale devices. \nBut the IBM Research team is still years away from being able to manufacture nanotube-based chips at scale. And because silicon chips are still getting faster, the IBM team needs to not only create a process for reliably manufacturing nanotube-based processors, but to make the processors faster than silicon chips will be in a decade. Let’s just hope it doesn’t take so long this time to get there.",

      "text": "International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) Stock Is Ready to Break Out! IBM stock is hopping aboard the gravy train By Serge Berger , Head Trader & Strategist, The Steady Trader | Nov 14, 2016, 7:58 am EST View All Posts \nInternational Business Machines Corp. (NYSE: IBM ) rallied sharply last week — like much of the rest of the U.S. stock market — following the results of the 2016 U.S. presidential elections. As a result, IBM stock is now flirting with a more substantial chart breakout. Naturally, active investors and traders would be wise to keep a close eye on this. \nBefore looking at the charts of IBM stock, though, allow me to to say a couple of words on the post-election rally in stocks, pertaining to investor psychology. \nAs I always reiterate in this column, building up large trading positions ahead of major news events (earnings events, election results) is a low-probability trading strategy. While I know some traders who got lucky last week and captured a good portion of the rally, they were actually positioned for a Hillary Clinton win. \nIn other words, yes, those traders made money … but they did so for all the wrong reasons. Very few market participants were positioned for a major stock market rally following a Donald Trump victory. \nWith the election over, I am hearing two predominant views on the post-election rally: The stock market has now fully priced in any potential good that could come from a Trump presidency. The “short covering” rally last week was just the beginning of a much larger stock market stampede higher, as economic growth is to resume. \nWhile I respect both views, it’s too early to tell, in my humble opinion. Still, we must respect the price action. IBM Stock Charts \nOn the multiyear weekly chart, we see that IBM stock at its February lows had retraced a full 61.8% of the entire rally off the late 2008 lows into the 2013 highs. This retracement number of course is important through the lens of Fibonacci analysis.",

      "text": "“Hello, Watson here, can I help with this diabetes situation?” Source: IBM I returned from the World of Watson 2016 conference held in Las Vegas a few weeks ago, hosted by IBM. I was quite amazed at the level of innovation and the number of entrepreneurs from both small and large organizations building useful solutions using Watson’s cognitive services to solve real problems across various industries. Watson is IBM’s cognitive computing technology platform that uses natural language processing and machine learning to reveal insights from large amounts of unstructured data. I came across several interesting and innovative solutions across various industries including transportation, retail, energy and others. I happened to be at the event specifically for the healthcare industry, given my role at IBM Watson Health , focusing on strategic partnerships.\nSource: IBM Speaking of healthcare, the amount of relevant data about each one of us over our lifetime is staggering, that IF tapped into could have a profound impact on our health. And I am not talking about your medical history only. Consider the demographic, socio-economic, fitness or activity or social data too. A big challenge in healthcare is making sense of all the medical + exogenous data together. Rapidly changing healthcare landscape leads to the opportunity to use technology to develop solutions for hospitals, doctors, and consumers focused on health and wellness. The explosion of data, coupled with the increasing use of connected everything (called the Internet of Things), is changing the way we all can help empower patients and impact health outcomes. Watson’s cognitive technology has the ability to understand, reason and learn, and aims to provide opportunities to assist doctors to improve patient health and help care managers to find new ways to help personalize and improve patient care.\nSource: IBM Take diabetes for example. Diabetes affects over 400 million people worldwide. If left unmanaged, it results in severe health complications and high healthcare costs. People with diabetes face daily challenges — managing their condition, knowing what to eat & when, knowing impact of food & activity on their glucose level. And speaking of diabetes, did you know that November is American Diabetes Month in the US? Throughout November, the American Diabetes Association encourages everyone to speak up and spread the word about what diabetes is really like. The social media campaign asks them to declare, “This Is Diabetes” using the campaign hashtag #ThisIsDiabetes to help educate others, break down stereotypes, correct myths and misunderstandings, and create a sense of urgency about the disease. Also note that today, November 14th is World Diabetes Day .\nSource: Medtronic I consider myself fortunate to work closely with Medtronic and their awesome team in their Diabetes Solutions & Services division, in a strategic alliance with Watson Health. We are working together on building a couple of diabetes management solutions that aim to help make a real difference in people’s lives. One will be a personalized mobile companion called Sugar.IQ with real-time glucose insights and predictions for individuals with diabetes to help make daily diabetes management easier.\nThe other solution is an integrated & personalized care program for healthcare systems, called Medtronic Turning Point, to assist people with diabetes using the power of cognitive care technology. IBM Watson Health is working with Medtronic by developing a new generation of personalized diabetes care management tools. IBM can help identify individuals at high-risk for hospital readmission due to diabetes. Using the resulting cognitive insights, Medtronic can provide an integrated and personalized care program to healthcare systems, to assist people with diabetes and help reduce cost of care. See video below. And check out 3 patient stories here .\nSource: IBM Watson Health & Medtronic are transforming diabetes care together using cognitive computing. And, by the way, we are just getting started in tackling diabetes.",

      "text": "Related Ticker: IBM Revenues will increase meaningfully at IBM over the next few years, but the jury is still out on earnings growth. Watson is the key to IBM's future, and IBM stock could be an all or nothing play on Watson. IBM carries more risk as an investment than other tech stalwarts. What's on offer is a high dividend and a cheaper valuation. Flickr \nInternational Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) third quarter results illustrated that the company is finally getting close to revenue growth, which speaks volumes about the growth in its 'strategic imperatives' division. Nevertheless, growth in the segment (which now makes up 40% of revenues) has come at a cost and this is something Wall Street is noticing. IBM stock looks more and more like an all or nothing play on Watson. Here's why betting on IBM can be risky, but worth considering. \nTop line revenues came in at $19.2 billion, which was only 0.3% behind the same quarter's figure in 2015. Gross profit margins in the third quarter slumped to 46.9%, which means the company's trailing 12 month average is 48.4% (down from 50% in 2014). Furthermore, operating margins have also taken a hit. The company's current trailing twelve month average is 16.4%, which is a sizeable 4.2% lower than the 20.6% number recorded in 2013. Therefore, when you couple the company's declining margins alongside the false boost in EPS in the third quarter (from a lower tax rate & IP income), you are looking at a company that is still heavily in transition at present. \nIBM Is Buying Growth In Its Strategic Imperatives Division \nThe problem that I have with IBM at the moment is that the whole 'strategic imperatives' segment has fierce competition, which will only intensify in the years to come. There is no doubt that areas such as \"Cognitive Solutions\" and the \"Cloud\" will continue to hold their own going forward, especially due to IBM's current acquisition rate. This is why I don't see a problem with its revenue growth, due to the $5.4 billion already invested in acquisitions thus far this year. However, IBM faces fierce competition from companies such as Microsoft (NSDQ:MSFT) , Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) and Alphabet Inc-C (NSDQ:GOOG) that will keep spending at similar levels (if not higher) to develop their own technologies. Therefore, the question that arises is whether IBM can grow its margins in a competitive environment such as this. Remember, IBM became a powerhouse in the tech sector because of the huge switching costs associated with its hardware, software and services. I don't see the same stickiness with many of the imperatives (Security, etc) despite their robust revenue growth at present. \nAlso Read: Is IBM Stock Out Of The Woods Post Q3? International Business Machines Corp. More The Acquisitions, More Valuable Watson Should Become \nWatson is the one area that has the potential to definitely stand out from the competition in years to come . IBM doesn't disclose Watson's quarterly or annual revenues but the investment that has gone into this in recent times should illustrate to investors the huge potential in this area. Down through the decades, IBM has always prided itself on making big bets and Watson could end up being the biggest of the biggest. For example, the Swiss bank UBS estimates that Watson will do about half a billion Dollars in top-line revenues this year, and that this figure has the potential to grow to $17 billion by 2022. IBM's bet is that if it can funnel as much valuable information and data into Watson as possible, the service will improve exponentially, which will ultimately deliver a meaningful increase in operating margins over time. Betting On IBM Is A Bet On Watson \nIn this rapidly changing sector, the companies that are going to be the most successful will be the ones with the highest switching costs. If Watson can deliver on its promise, which is that it will be used en masse, across multiple sectors in the world, then this will give IBM a strong competitive advantage in the AI space. Furthermore, IBM has stated clearly that Watson will only be available on its own cloud (and not competing ones) which again is a strong statement of intent by the management. \nAlso Read: AMZN Stock: Trump's Policies Could Actually Help Amazon.com, Inc. IBM Is A Cheap Stock In Tech & Pays Out An Above-Average Dividend \nPersonally though, I feel IBM carries more risk than the likes of Microsoft and Amazon, which are growing their cloud infrastructures rapidly. However the investor in question is getting paid in a sense to take this risk. Why? Because the company's earnings multiple of 12.7 is currently over four points below the industry average. Moreover, the company is currently paying out a dividend that translates to a yield of 3.47%, and is increasing its dividend at an attractive annual growth rate of 12.5%. Therefore, I see IBM as a more speculative play in the tech landscape. It doesn't seem to have as much downside protection as Amazon on or Microsoft, but it is much cheaper and pays a lofty dividend. Success in Watson will make or break this company. As usual, it's all or nothing with IBM. Summary \nIBM's margins have suffered in recent quarters and analysts are unsure if they can bounce back to previous levels. The risk/reward setup here is interesting. On one hand, I feel the company has less downside protection compared to the likes of Amazon, but on the other hand, it is much cheaper than the other options in the market and is paying a strong dividend. Position sizing is key here in case Watson doesn't deliver on its promise. \nEvaluating tech stocks? Check out Amigobulls' top technology stock picks , which have beaten the NASDAQ by over 104%.

      "text": "Make America's CEOs write open letters again\n16 Nov 2016 at 07:02, Richard Chirgwin Big Blue's big boss, Ginni Rometty, is hoping to dance on the tightrope that Big Orange has brought to the White House.\nTrump's unexpected election puts the technology industry in a tight spot, because many associate it with the economic conditions Trump exploited throughout his campaign. Globalisation demonised as a destroyer of American jobs; the feeling that multinationals like IBM leave the mundane business of paying American tax to individuals and the looming threat of having your job automated away can all be laid at the feet of technology companies, with productivity upsides conveniently forgotten.\nBefore the election, many tech companies scoffed at the Trump campaign – or warned against it – which makes a rapprochement inevitable, and it's into this environment that Rometty has penned an open letter to the president-elect offering five policy suggestions from IBM.\nMake those blue collars new IBM's “P-TECH” schools model only graduated its first students this year, but Big Blue hopes it's ( demonstrated enough success to be more widely adopted. Not everybody agrees the schools are a hit, as Fortune noted earlier this year, but Rometty says IBM hired “some of the first graduates” of its New York school and thinks that's a sign the incoming administration should adopt the model more widely.\nArguing that the tech sector needs vocationally-trained people as much as it needs college graduates, Rommetty writes that scaling up its model would create “a national corps of skilled workers trained to take the “new collar” IT jobs that are in demand here in America.”\nMake great cities smart again Digitising cities is an obsession among the likes of IBM and Cisco, not least because they'll need lots of hardware and consulting. So it's no surprise that Rometty calls for the incoming president to encourage states and localities “to build intelligent – and secure – roads, bridges, buildings and other public facilities”.\nHealthcare? So much health. You'll health so much you'll get tired of health IBM wants to update advice it gave to a much younger Barack Obama, from 2009, that the tech sector could trim $900 billion from the US health budget over ten years with analytics, electronic health records, and getting the government to put the squeeze on profiteering.\nRometty reckons the ideas are still worth pursuing, and tells Trump IBM can update its 2009 advice.\nGovernment? It's a fraud. A really bad thing. Just ask Doctor Watson Technology and fraud analytics – plus cybersecurity – will save $1 trillion, Rometty reckons, so the Technology CEO Council will dust off the recommendations it offered the Obama administration for another try.\nPsst ... can we talk about tax? IBM likes president-elect Trump's tax cut ideas a lot, and dangles a capital carrot: if he'll make US corporate taxes “competitive”, IBM will bring home all that money mouldering away in Bermuda or the Caymans, Ireland or The Netherlands). Today, bringing that money home would mean paying US taxes, despite some tax already having been paid in the countries it was raised. IBM promises, cross its heart hope to die, that if Trump sorts this out it really will spend repatriated cash on education and R&D. Really.\nWatson's got spare time for war veterans The letter wraps up with Rometty asking the administration-to-be to expand the collaboration, announced this year, with the Department of Veteran's Affairs, which uses Big Blue's Go-playing powerhouse to help with cancer treatment.\nThe full text of the letter is below. ®\nDear Mr President-elect:\nCongratulations on your election as the 45 th president of the United States.\nLast Tuesday night you spoke about bringing the country together to build a better future, and the opportunity to harness the creative talent of people for the benefit of all. I know that you are committed to help America's economy grow in ways that are good for all of its people.\nI am writing to offer ideas that I believe will help achieve you articulated and that can advance a national agenda in a time of profound change. I do so as the leader of the nation's largest technology employer, its leading patent creator, and the company that for more than 105 years believed that prosperity and progress can be achieved by unleashing the potential of all people. Permit me to offer a few specific suggestions.\nCreating “New Collar” Jobs Getting a job at today's IBM does not always require a college degree: at some of our centers in the United States, as many as one third of employees have less than a four-year degree. What matters most is relevant skills, sometimes obtained through vocational training. In addition, we are creating and hiring to fill “new collar” jobs – entirely new roles in areas such as cybersecurity, data science, artificial intelligence and cognitive business.\nYou've spoken about the importance of vocational education, and we agree. IBM has championed a new educational model for the United States – six-year public high schools that combine traditional education with the best of community colleges, mentoring, and real-world job experience. The first of these schools opened with IBM's support five years ago in New York; we have hired some of the first graduates. There will soo be 100 such schools across the country. With your support, we could do much more. Let's work together to scale up this approach of vocational training, creating a national corps of skilled workers trained to take the “new collar” IT jobs that are in demand here in America.\nBuilding Intelligent, Secure Infrastructure You've said we need to invest in America's infrastructure, and we agree. As we build big, let's also build smart. The country should focus on infrastructure investments that incorporate Internet of Things (IoT) technology and artificial intelligence to improve performance. And as infrastructure gets smarter, it also increases the need for cybersecurity, so that vital networks cannot be compromised. We recommend that your infrastructure package include incentives for states and localities to build intelligent – and secure – roads, bridges, buildings and other public facilities.\nHealthcare: Applying Lessons from Private Sector Experience IBM operates one of the largest employer-sponsored health plans in the United States. In 2009, IBM offered 15 specific ideas for how America could save more than $900 billion over ten years through some common-sense reforms to the healthcare system, leveraging lessons learned in the private sector. These included using data analytics to reduce fraudulent Medicare claims, improving the exchange of healthcare information among providers, and leveraging the government's purchasing power to lower the cost of drugs and care. IBM will update its recommendations for the healthcare system and hopes to work with Congress and your HHS Secretary to drive better healthcare at lower cost.\nUsing Data to Fight Government Waste and Inefficiency Eight years ago, IBM helped lead an effort to identify $1 trillion in savings the federal government could achieve through advanced data analytics, data center consolidation, and the use of cloud technologies to improve the cybersecurity of key government systems. As part of the Technology CEO Council of which I am a member, we will prepare an updated set of recommendations for how you could use technology and fraud analytics to save the government more than $1 trillion.\nBringing Money Home to Invest in America IBM supports your proposal to make America's tax system more competitive. Many billions of dollars of American companies' earnings do not come home because of an outdated and punitive ax system. Your tax reform proposal will free up capital that companies of all sizes can reinvest in their US operations, training and education programs for their employees, and research and development programs. We will support the efforts of your administration and Congress to pass tax reform early in 2017.\nTaking Care of Our Veterans – With the World's Best Technology All of us at IBM share your gratitude and devotion to the men, women and families who serve our country. More must be done to give our vets the best medical care possible. So, we recently announced a pilot program with the Department of Veterans Affairs to help its oncologists treat 10,000 veterans through the power of precision medicine and genomic analysis powered by IBM's cognitive computing system, Watson. We hope to work with your VA Secretary to expand this collaboration.\nMr President-elect, IBM's roots are in the United States. We are investing, hiring, and continuing to reinvent our company for long-term competitiveness. At more than 50 major locations across the country, we hired more US employees last year than in the previous five years. We are opening new innovation centers and business units across the country. We are proud of the work we do here in the United States, just as we are proud of the work we do in more than 175 countries around the world.\nIn the years ahead there will be issues on which we can agree, and issues on which we do not. But as you prepare to take office as our new president, I hope the ideas I have offered in this letter represent ways that we can work together to achieve prosperity that is broadly shared in our society.\nSincerely, Ginny Rometty\nhttp://www.theregister.co.uk/2016/11/16/ibm_makes_america_great_again/\nShare this More articles on Good Articles to Share >>\n[转贴] KWAP斥资7亿令吉，投资大马股市小资本股 - 資匯 The busy weekly - Nov 16, 2016 Ananda Krishnan playing the listing-delisting-relisting game again? - M.A. Wind - Nov 16, 2016 [转贴] 【中钢奶牛】- CSCSTEL(5094)盈利节节高升，丰厚股息可期！- Harryt30 - Nov 16, 2016 October vehicle sales drop 14% amid cautious sentiment before Budget 2017 announcement - Nov 16, 2016 KL-Singapore HSR agreement on track: Najib - Nov 16, 2016 Singapore to test digital currency in latest fintech initiative - Nov 16, 2016",

      "text": "\nThe Boston Consulting Group partnered with IBM and the Electronic Business Group, a leading French think tank, to interview digital leaders and C-suite executives on the topic of digital transformation. Harste recently sat down with Claude Czechowski, a senior advisor to BCG’s Technology Advantage practice, to discuss the challenges inherent in leading a digital transformation in a global company with roots going back more than 100 years. Edited excerpts from their conversation follow. \nat Swarovski? \nWe sell crystals to 5,000 different B2B customers, like Prada, Armani, and Gucci, but also to many, many others in the fashion and jewelry industries. Our customers produce finished products with Swarovski crystals—shoes with crystals, for example—and then they sell them through retail channels. Not only do we sell the crystals, we also help our customers sell their products. \nOur digital transformation is mainly designed to make our B2B customers successful in retail. We help them market and sell their products to their customers. As in other industries, online is becoming the dominant channel; therefore, it is very important for us to have scalable digital platforms through which we can help them sell products with Swarovski crystals. \nWe have 15,000 different SKUs for loose crystals and another 200,000 crystal products. In addition, because there are so many different application techniques, our crystals can be used in more than 1 million combinations. When customers want to use our crystals, they need to navigate effectively through our vast assortment. So, we created the Crystal Collection App, a digital catalog that lets consumers navigate through our whole assortment. This is great for our customers, and we also get live streams of transactional data that show what they are looking for and allow us to develop customer-specific recommendations that our key account managers can use in their B2B interactions. \nWe are also developing an e-commerce solution to sell all our loose crystals to B2B customers. The thing that’s tricky for us is that we sell directly to B2B customers, but we also sell indirectly through wholesalers. With our e-commerce solutions, we basically become competitors of our own indirect customers. This has been a big challenge from an organizational perspective. For the sales team, it felt like a huge channel risk. Are we crazy to compete against our own customers? How do I manage my own account and the revenue coming from the e-commerce solution, which is managed through headquarters? How does that feed into my net sales in the country? These discussions have kept us busy for a year and a half. \nHow has your B2C business evolved from a digital perspective? \nThe goal on the B2C side is to make our ingredient brand strong. Let’s take Jimmy Choo, for example. The Jimmy Choo company wants to crystallize a shoe and sell it in retail. It’s a Jimmy Choo shoe with ingredients—crystals—from Swarovski. The company can use a Swarovski tag or a seal on its product and use our brand in its communications. \nBut when it comes to digital communication, it’s important for us to make people aware of the ingredient brand. For example, Swarovski sponsors the Victoria’s Secret fashion show. If we do something with Victoria’s Secret, we create more than 100 million impressions and we get huge engagement on social media. In the end, if a consumer wants to purchase a product with Swarovski crystals, she may not find it. Why? Because online retailers may not include the right keywords when they categorize products. If they don’t say the ingredients are from Swarovski, there’s no way for someone seeking a product with Swarovski crystals to find it. \nSo, our digital solution was to develop a crystal hub [www.crystals-from-swarovski.com]. In our crystal hub, consumers can say, for example, “I want to see all shoes that include Swarovski crystals.” The consumer can see different brands of shoes, find the product, and then say, “I want to purchase this product.” We then lead the consumer to an online retailer, which handles fulfillment. This is very interesting because it will help our B2B customers sell products with Swarovski crystals to their customers. \nHow much value do you expect to create through e-commerce? \nWe have very big customers in B2B, and they will still be served through the normal offline channels. Our e-commerce is more for the smaller customers. So I expect we’ll have just 3% to 5% of our total revenue coming from e-commerce in three years or so. With B2C, the revenue stream is a little different because we don’t own the finished product for Swarovski crystals. If we help a customer sell 1,000 products, each of which costs €500, we don’t get €500,000; we get only the crystal share. For us, the bigger net sales advantage in B2C is in providing a service to our B2B customers. We provide a distribution platform and create loyalty. That’s more important to us. \nIn 2017, we will develop a marketplace where we own the customer relationship. We are one of the biggest jewelry manufacturers in the world, and we have 1,300 of our own Swarovski stores and 11,000 points of sale. If we can use that distribution and our loyalty program to drive traffic to our crystal hub, this would be a tremendous value. \nHave you had success partnering with startups? \nWe have an open innovation team with a huge network of startups. If we need a specific technology—like a tool to manage product feeds from the online retailers for our crystal hub, for example—these startups have the technology and experience. There are so many new technologies that it’s not so difficult to get information about what’s out there and what we can use. The more difficult thing is to have a clear strategy and understand what’s relevant for the business, how to monetize it, and how to integrate it into existing processes. \nWhat are some of the challenges you’ve faced over the course of Swarovski’s digital transformation? \nThe biggest thing is the mindset shift. We are a very old business. Swarovski started more than 120 years ago and has been very much an offline relationship business. We needed to get into the mindset that digital is important. Everybody understands advertising and building the brand through social media, but when it comes to commercialization and e-commerce, for example, that’s a huge mindset change for the organization. It’s very important that the people driving the digital-transformation agenda use every opportunity to talk to the business. We have had lunch lectures where people can participate and better understand the objectives, and they become more open to digital in the end, which is very important. \nWho is driving the digital transformation? The CEO? Or a business unit? \nMuch of it comes from the marketing side. For me, it’s logical that we use e-commerce as a lead generation channel and to better understand our small customers, which were kind of a black box for us in the past. \nBut the question of who drives everything is complicated. Where does e-commerce sit and who develops it? For us, e-commerce is developed in the marketing organization, but it could have been in sales or in a separate digital business. Furthermore, we should not underestimate the importance of adjacent functions, such as supply chain, IT, and finance. How do the P&Ls work together in the offline and online business? How do we incentivize our sales force to send small customers to the e-commerce shop? And when customers are big enough, they need to be sent back to the offline sales organization. It’s very important to get alignment on these points. \nWhich teams are driving the company’s digital transformation? \nFrom an organizational point of view, we have many different business units involved in the digital transformation: marketing, IT, the consumer business, etcetera. Everybody wants to drive the digital-transformation agenda. IT developed the digital-transformation agenda from a technical point of view. Other business units developed an agenda from their points of view. We are now in the alignment process, to bring all these together. In the offline world, the business units could operate separately. But it’s not possible anymore to tell the consumer, “Go to the sales organization,” because we have so many touchpoints now. In a digital environment, we have to provide one view to the consumer. I’d say we’re at about 80% in terms of alignment. There are still some really big nuts to crack, but these are more on the organization side, like having one customer loyalty program and getting the best people on board. \nThe most difficult thing for us was to get the right profiles on board. If you want to get into e-commerce, it’s not easy to find the right people because there’s huge competition. It’s so important to get really great people on board who have a network. That gives the organization credibility—people start to see that something big is happening— and then you get more people. \nHave you integrated the data and analytics as well? \nI would say we are at about 30% on data and analytics. We have tons of data. Through the Crystal Collection App, for example, we have so much transactional data from many different channels. We still need to create one view, but we have made a big step forward now that we have one customer relationship management system. \nAnother difficult thing is how to make use of the data. How do you bring it back to the consumer to create a cross-sell, an up-sell, or better lifetime value? \nI’ll give you an example. \nOur Crystal Collection App allows B2B customers to search through our product assortment to view a specific crystal by color, size, and cut. Our key account managers can now see transactional data based on past purchases and customers with similar purchase patterns, and they can make recommendations to the customer. That would be a great use case. But to make that happen, we have to get the key account managers to use the iPad with customers, understand how it can be used in the selling discussion, and so on. I think the most difficult part is to persuade key account managers to use it. You can analyze data until you are dead, but you need to create use cases, and behind each use case there needs to be an understanding of how to create more value for the business. Everything else should follow from this. ",

      "text": "In 2010, technology firm IBM surveyed some 6,500 employees across 16 cities in the US to find out how much time they spent waiting for elevators and inside them over a 12-month period. Turns out that New York workers spent a cumulative time of 92 years waiting for them and 5.9 years inside them. Readers of this newspaper likely to spend a tonne of time in elevators too. This is both limiting and liberating. Limiting because you cannot speak on your phone as the reception is poor. Liberating for that very reason. \nThere are a number of things you can do in the elevator: Read this newspaper, make a to-do list or fret over a meeting. This is over and above the usual things that we do while stuck in an elevator, which is, stare at the floor numbers and wait for that reassuring “ping” sound that will allow us to scramble out of that claustrophobic space.\nNow here’s a thought, and you know what’s coming right? Why not use the few moments to get that dreaded exercise word out of the way. After all, you missed your pilates class this morning. Since the elevator is crowded, try upper body stretches. Clasp your hands behind your back and roll your shoulders back to combat the hunch that comes from working at the computer all day. Look upwards for the full effect. The other thing is to face the wall and flex your feet. So your heel is on the floor and your toes are touching the wall. This gives your calves and lower part of the legs a nice stretch. Lean forward to amp it up a notch. \nIf you are a start-up entrepreneur, practise your elevator pitch. \nThe best thing to do in an elevator, however, is to lunge. This is particularly true if it is a small- to medium-sized elevator. You know the kind where you crowd in, shuffle around like a penguin, and hope that everyone is wearing deodorant. This is exactly the size of elevator that is perfect for lunges—if you are alone inside.  Spread your feet forward and do, say, 10 lunges. The only problem is if the elevator stops in the middle and people enter. In this case, you have to, well, suck it in.  \nIn Ashtanga yoga, there is a practice called  odiyana bandha , which in its original form helps awaken your  kundalini  and needs to be learnt from a proper guru. The amateur approach has to do with pulling in your stomach, and not just when we pose for a photograph. Trained yogi s can suck in their stomachs so that it goes flat below the ribcage. For the rest of us, simply doing the following practice can help. Exhale completely. Pull the stomach in as much as possible. Hold the position. Lift up your diaphragm and hold. \nMost of us begin by holding our breath while the stomach is pulled in. But my yoga teacher tells me to gently inhale and exhale using the top part of the respiratory canal while holding the stomach in. Do this for 10-15 seconds. Repeat. \nWhen I first went to the gym, a trainer began my session by making me lie on the ground and do “pretend ab crunches”, or pulling in your stomach without lifting the head like in a normal ab crunch. I can do real ab crunches now, but pulling in the stomach is what I do when no other options are available. The beauty of this practice is that it can be done pretty much anywhere. I do it in a crowded elevator. It has one added benefit: If I hold my breath, I don’t have to smell anybody or anything. \nShoba Narayan routinely lunges in the elevator.

      "text": "How NASA is working with IBM Cloud Video's Ustream to help viewers get their space fix By Adam Flomenbaum - 18 November 2016 03:16am iss_hd_earth_viewing_experiment2.png \nOne of the greatest moments in TV history was the broadcast of Apollo 11 landing on the moon in 1969. A lot had changed since then, including how people consume content of both historic and everyday events. \nIf anything, space exploration and scientific discovery should inspire more people today than ever before. That is partly because of how much content – live content in particular – is available at viewers’ fingertips. \nNASA began livestreaming missions in 2004, before people watched much live video on the web. In 2009, NASA partnered with Ustream (acquired by IBM in 2016) to help with its efforts, and since then, “NASA has created more than 60 Ustream channels since it began live-streaming, and 18 of those are currently active today,” Alden Fertig, VP of product at Ustream, an IBM Company, told Found Remote. “Last year, NASA's top three Ustream channels attracted more than 55 million views. The streams enable space enthusiasts around the world to engage with NASA’s program from the convenience of their computers, smartphones or preferred devices. Instead of just watching major events broadcast over TV, people around the world can get more detail and content about NASA and its missions.” \n‘NASA TV” now airs a mix of prerecorded and live programming 24 hours a day, and its broadcast of asteroid DA-14’s near-Earth fly-by in February 2013 drew a peak audience of 1.4 million concurrent live-stream viewers. \nEarlier today, Peggy Whitson (who becomes the oldest woman in space), along with colleagues from Russia and Europe, began a journey to the International Space Station (ISS) to carry the new Expedition 50-51 trio to its new home in space. NASA turned to IBM Cloud Video’s Ustream to stream the monumental event. \n“For an event that is literally out of this world, NASA needs a reliable provider that can stream video on a massive scale and quickly adjust to changing viewership levels,” said Fertig. “Viewer levels for NASA Ustream channels can go from a few people to millions of people depending on the event. This technology will be used today for a live-stream of the Expedition 50-51 launch that will enable viewers across the globe to tune in from any device.” \nThis article is about: North America , NASA , IBM , Found Remote , Digital , Brand Adam Flomenbaum \nAdam Flomenbaum is a global leading expert on social television, over the top platforms, TV Everywhere, and content marketing.

Learn how IBM API Connect provides near-universal access to data and services both on-premises and in the cloud, brought to you in partnership with IBM . When it comes to API design and the Swagger (OpenAPI) specification, there are few people that have the level of passion as Arnaud Lauret , best known as the API Handyman. Arnaud has worked in IT banking for almost 13 years — as both a programmer and project manager — and today works on API projects and governance as IT architect at AXA Banque. In September, Arnaud released the API Stylebook , which aims to help API designers solve API design challenges and build API design guidelines by providing quick and easy access to selected and categorized resources. Arnaud is the also the creator of a 10-part Swagger tutorial on writing the OpenAPI specification. His tutorial is a valuable resource for anyone that’s getting started with the Swagger open source tools, or SwaggerHub . Earlier this month, Arnaud was part of the API Expert Panel Developing an API Strategy for 2017 at SmartBear HQ. Prior to the panel, we sat down with Arnaud to learn more about his experience of getting started with Swagger, and common traits of good API design. Could you talk about your experience of getting started with Swagger? A few years ago, we started an API project and we wanted to have documentation for our API, so we started to use the Swagger annotation to generate documentation from the code. I was not aware at that time that behind this annotation was a format — the Swagger specification. The initial result was not really OK because we did not give enough instruction to the developers who write the annotation, so the result was not really usable as documentation. It was at that time that Swagger 2.0 came out — with a new specification, the editor, and the use of YAML. We needed to update our documentation, which was really complex because the documentation was in the code. So, I started to play with the format by retrieving the existing generated documentation and convert it to Swagger 2.0 and I realized it was really easy to parse and manipulate. I created another module which corrected many of the issues there were in the documentation. That was what triggered my envy to work extensively with this format. I had the sense at that time that we could do many, many things with that. We started by writing the specification with the OpenAPI specification format. We planned to write some controls during design time, just by parsing the specification to see if the newly designed API conforms to our guidelines — if the new documentation is complete, if there is description everywhere… It was step-by-step, discovering a new thing day after day. Eventually, I ended up writing a 10-part tutorial on my blog. The most important thing about the specification is that it’s really simple and you don’t need any complex things to parse it and do things with it. What are some of the common design traits/guidelines you see in REST APIs? All of the guidelines are really focused on — okay we want to do a REST API — what is a REST API? We have resources, we have to use HTTP protocols, the right HTTP status, and so on. They tell the story differently but they all explain the same thing in the same way from a very technical point of view. And it struck me when you asked this question, they do not talk about the real problem — how to see if an API as offering functionality. And not just offering resources with the HTTP protocol. We must have these kinds of documents because we need to put the frame around the API design from a technical point of view. But I think we also think all companies that need to design APIs, need functional guidelines how to design APIs from a functional point of view. There are books that talk about that but all of these guidelines are really technical.

      "text": "View Blog \nThis is a YouTube link to a PBS (Nova) documentary on IBM Watson: The smartest machine ever build - The first time I watched this, I thought 'hey something is wrong here'. I went back and watched it again. I got another person to watch and validate - there were no women scientists, and there are hardly any women speaking in this documentary. \nRecently I read this article written a few months back with the title - Artificial Intelligence Has a ‘Sea of Dudes’ Problem . The number of women in computing is low and it looks like the number of women in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence is even lower. Do you recognize these data scientists? Click here for source \nIBM's CEO Ginni Rometty says “I think in the next five years, you’ll use this kind of technology... With the cognitive intelligence we see in the the technologies that have become part of our everyday lives, she seems to be making a fairly accurate prediction. Siri now tells me 23 miles to get home and updates me on traffic conditions when I start driving! Companies like Microsoft, Apple, Google, Facebook and others are investing heavily in studying, researching and building applications that leverage machine learning and artificial intelligence. When the expectation is that this technology will impact every facet of our daily lives, I think there will be great value when contributions to such code, projects, and applications come from both men and women. \nWhat can be done to increase the number of women in this field? I am not sure I know the answer here but I am curious about what thoughts others have on this topic. \nThis article appeared first in LinkedIn . Views: 68",

Despite its successes in this area, investors are still skeptical about IBM’s turnaround November 20, 2016 | About: IBM +0% \nIBM has been in transition mode for more than five years running now, a period that saw its revenues decline year after year as the company shifted focus towards high-margin business lines that can work for the next several decades. But the market has refused to be impressed with the transition, which possibly went on for far too long for investors’ tastes. A quick search on the internet would lead you straight to articles that talk about how IBM has already jumped off the cliff and there is no way it can get back to its old self. \nTransitions are always painful, especially if you are company with tens of billion of dollars in sales. IBMs sold its personal computing division to Lenovo way back in 2005. The company was losing money in its PC division before it decided to pull the plug, a move which looks like a masterstroke ten years later, considering the way things have shifted in the PC world. IBM could have easily chosen to double down on the PC business but it moved away. Peter Lynch Chart of IBM \nThe Silent Sibling of the Cloud Fraternity \nIBM’s shift into the cloud business wasn’t an organic one. The company shopped around for the last five years, spent billions of dollars and bulldozed its way into the cloud business. Clearly, the company was late to the party and realised the need to move fast as its bottom line and top line were getting tighter and tighter with each passing year. The company was slow to act on that front, and it never really looked out the window in search of newer business streams when things were going well. \nEven now, when you look at the way discussions about the cloud industry happen, sadly, IBM gets left out most of the time as most of us stop our discussion with Amazon, Microsoft and Google. All three companies have shown enormous amount of dedication and effort in shaping the discussion, while IBM sadly watches it from the sidelines despite having a cutting edge Analytics division which is a stone’s throw away from hitting $5 billion in quarterly sales. \nMost of IBM’s Analytics division’s revenues can be counted against its cloud business because, invariably, the delivery system has to be a cloud-based one for it to be easily accessible. At five billion dollars in quarterly revenues, that unit alone will be pulling close to $20 billion or more very soon. But even in this space, any discussion about artificial intelligence and hyperscale computing includes Microsoft and Google, but not IBM. And, honestly, I believe it is IBM’s fault. \nA Long, Hard Look at IBM Analytics \nThere are plenty of reasons to believe that IBM’s Watson is already proving to be a great jewel in IBM’s portfolio. On the infrastructure as a service front, Amazon and Microsoft have pulled way far ahead of other companies while IBM has been focusing on the hybrid infrastructure model. Since none of the companies will give us the layer by layer breakup of revenues, it is really hard to break things down and compare one service against another. The best possible solution to that problem is to look at their growth numbers. IBM has so far kept pace with Amazon and Microsoft, both of whom have been growing their cloud businesses at high double-digit rates, staying around the +50% level. \nIBM’s as-a-Service run rate has moved from $5.4 billion during the first quarter of 2016 to $7.5 billion during the third quarter. When things keep increasing sequentially, then we can safely assume that there is enough momentum to carry the growth deep into several quarters in the future. \nOne point of concern that remains is their Analytics division, which grew 9%, 4% and 14% in the first three quarters of the year. With no clear competitor in this area, the growth could - and should - be much higher. If this segment keeps putting up strong growth numbers it will have a ripple effect on their other cloud products as well. The Analytics unit reported $4.9 billion in revenues during the second quarter and $4.8 billion during the third quarter, and if the company can post higher numbers during the fourth quarter and stay the course for next year, the new-age business streams will have then come a long way in shaping IBM’s future. \nIf you have invested in IBM, those are the key numbers you will need to watch: how much year-over-year growth their Analytics division reports, and how much it grew sequentially. \nDisclosure: I have no positions in the stock mentioned above and no intention to initiate a position in the next 72 hours.

      "text": "IBM is on a push to offer IoT from development to production To help enterprises, the company is combining Watson, cloud, consulting, and services Senior U.S. Correspondent, IDG News Service | Nov 21, 2016 11:52 AM   \nThe Internet of Things is Watson's next challenge. Reality check on the Internet of Things \nThe internet of things is so complex that some enterprises would rather turn to one vendor to determine the business case for an IoT deployment, design the system, roll it out, and operate it as a service. \nAt least that’s what IBM believes. The company’s combining several of its products and services into what it calls the IoT Solutions Practice. The move, announced Monday, is designed so customers can find all of IBM’s IoT offerings in one place. \nTurning IoT into a service isn’t a new idea. Consultancies like Accenture and carriers like Verizon, among others, say they can reduce the complexity of adopting these systems and making them pay for themselves. \n[ Download the State of the CIO 2016 report ] \nIBM says it alone has all the pieces to do the job from end to end. Many customers will combine those pieces with components from other vendors and service providers, so the company makes sure its offerings work with those of others. In fact, IBM has partnerships with several other enterprise IoT players, including AT&T and Cisco Systems . \nBut end-to-end expertise is IBM’s big sales pitch, and it's one that some customers may buy into. Complexity is up there with security as something that enterprises find hard about IoT, industry analysts say. \nAt the heart of the company’s offering is the Watson IoT Platform, which combines analytics, security, and other capabilities, including blockchain technology for authentication in some cases. The platform lets customers take advantage of a set of APIs (application programming interfaces), IBM’s SoftLayer cloud infrastructure, and all the analytical smarts that make up the Watson computing universe. Add consulting and ongoing support, and IBM can be a one-stop solution, the company says. \nImplementing IoT may have broad implications for a business beyond just deployment projects and changes in technology, said Jesus Mantas, general manager for IBM’s business consulting practice. For example, the way a company monitors its assets can change from a “pull” to a “push” process, he said. \n“You don’t need somebody to now go every day and check something,” Mantas said. “Event-trigger notifications do that. Well, that changes people’s jobs.” \nPart of what IBM can do for companies adopting IoT is help them through the business implications of the changes, he said. The IoT Solutions Practice applies to a broad range of industries, says IBM, which will first target automotive, electronics, industrial products, insurance, retail, transportation, and buildings. More than 1,500 experts at nine IoT centers around the world are dedicated to the practice. \nTo help enterprises work on how they’ll use IoT, IBM also offers free access to the Watson IoT Platform, said Brett Greenstein, IBM’s vice president for the platform. \n“They can use anything we have in our cloud, effectively, for free,” Greenstein said. As long as customer operations stay below a certain level, around a few dozen devices, they can keep the free access until they’re ready to move up to production scale.  ",

      "text": "By James Kobielus , IBM. \nThe experience of being a working data scientist is not necessarily what people think. A profession that some regard as “sexy” is, more often than not, a difficult job involving long hours, tight budgets, limited staff, daunting tasks, shifting requirements, endless meetings, and inflated expectations. \nFor the working data scientist, pain points may dominate the fabric of their experience. High-performance data scientists are those who automate, accelerate, and streamline the more tedious aspects of their jobs so that they can focus on finding data-driven insights. They will embrace any tool, platform, or approach that can help free up mental bandwidth for tasks that demand their creativity and judgment. \nData scientists do exceptionally complex work. Their productivity depends on having access to tools and practices they can use to streamline and accelerate the details in which they immerse themselves. As discussed in this recent IDG News article , the most fulfilling experiences of high-performance data scientists fall into three broad categories: Learning : This is the core value that data scientists deliver: learning what insights the data may reveal and what relevance they may have to the business problem at hand. According to a data scientist who was quoted in the article, “The first step is understanding the area -- I'll spend a lot of time searching the literature, reading, and trying to understand the problem.\" It also involves continual reassessment of the available and appropriate data-science computational approaches, algorithms, tools, platforms, and services necessary to tackle these problems effectively within constraints of time, budget, and staff. Collaborating : This is the process under which data scientists engage with team members, colleagues, customers, and stakeholders. These activities—such as meetings and emails--often consume a substantial part of the data scientist’s day. It involves everything from identifying a client's business problem to assessing available data, tracking progress, discussing reports, sharing findings, explaining results, and putting the insights into an actionable business context. Productivity in this respect depends on the data scientists’ consultative skills: their ability to guide stakeholders through the process of identifying how data-driven insights can drive disruptive business outcomes. In the words of another data scientist quoted in the cited article, “A lot of people know they need help with data, but they don't know what they can do with it. It feels like being a magician, opening their minds to the possibilities. That kind of exploration and geeking out is now my favorite part.\" Creating : These are the nitty-gritty data science tasks such as discovering and preparing data, building and refining statistical models, visualizing and assessing findings, and developing data-driven applications. Productivity in this respect depends on the data scientist’s ability to leverage high-performance data mining, predictive analytics, machine learning, artificial intelligence, and cognitive solutions to automate these tasks. It also depends on their ability to determine the appropriate analytics technique for addressing classes of business problems, with a clear understanding of both basic and advanced data mining techniques, ranging from regression analysis, cluster analysis, decision trees, neural networks and Bayesian machine learning methods to optimization, simulation and stochastic analysis. \nOne of the most frustrating experiences for any data scientists is when they have to work with disparate, fragmented tools and platforms in support of various lifecycle tasks, such as source discovery, data preparation, statistical modeling, and visualization. Considering that data science is increasingly a team-oriented discipline, it’s essential that diverse data professionals—including statistical modelers, data engineers, business analytics, visualization designers, app developers, and others—be able to pool their efforts within open, collaborative environments. The collaboration tools that data scientists employ can make a huge difference whether they experience productivity or frustration in their daily tasks. Lack of an integrated development environment has unfortunate consequences for data scientist productivity: results that are unshareable, team collaborations that are are awkward, and cross-project visibility that is limited or non-existent. \nTo power high-performance data science, an integrated development environment should facilitate the following development tasks: Acquire data from diverse data lakes, big data clusters, cloud data services and more Discover, acquire, aggregate, curate, prepare, pipeline, model and visualize complex, multistructured data Prototype and program data applications for execution in in-memory, streaming and other low-latency runtime environments Tap into libraries of algorithms and models for statistical exploration, data mining, predictive analytics, machine learning and natural language processing, among other functions Develop, share and reuse data-driven analytic applications as composable microservices for deployment in hybrid cloud environments Secure, govern, track, audit and archive data, algorithms, models, metadata and other assets throughout their lifecycles \nNow in open beta, IBM Data Science Experience (DSX) delivers all of these capabilities in an open and integrated environment for team data science. DSX provides the following productivity features for next-generation data science: An interactive, cloud-based, scalable and secure visual workbench for consolidating open-source tools, languages and libraries and for collaborating within teams to rapidly put high-quality data science applications into production Access to open-source tools and libraries—including Spark, R, Python and Scala—as well as solutions from IBM, IBM partners such as RStudio and H20.ai, and others through an extensible architecture A unified environment for data scientists and other analytics developers that allows them to connect with one another while accessing project dashboards and learning resources, forking and sharing projects, exchanging development assets (datasets, models, projects, tutorials and Jupyter notebooks) and sharing results, with follow-on releases aiming to include comments, user profiles, data science competitions, Zeppelin notebooks and real-time collaboration Built-in connectivity to diverse data sources as well as simplified data ingestion, refinement, curation and analysis capabilities, with follow-on releases aiming to include new features such as data shaping, Spark pipeline deployment, SPSS analytic algorithms, automated modeling and data preparation, model management and deployment, advanced visualizations, text analytics, geospatial analytics and integration with Watson Analytics \nFor more information on DSX and to participate in the open beta,",

      "text": "IBM is on a push to offer IoT from development to production To help enterprises, the company is combining Watson, cloud, consulting, and services Senior U.S. Correspondent, IDG News Service | November 21, 2016 Email a friend Use commas to separate multiple email addresses From Your message has been sent. Sorry There was an error emailing this page. \nThe Internet of Things is Watson's next challenge. 25% off Logitech Wireless Keyboard with Touchpad for Internet-Connected TVs -... \nThe internet of things is so complex that some enterprises would rather turn to one vendor to determine the business case for an IoT deployment, design the system, roll it out, and operate it as a service. \nAt least that’s what IBM believes. The company’s combining several of its products and services into what it calls the IoT Solutions Practice. The move, announced Monday, is designed so customers can find all of IBM’s IoT offerings in one place. \nTurning IoT into a service isn’t a new idea. Consultancies like Accenture and carriers like Verizon, among others, say they can reduce the complexity of adopting these systems and making them pay for themselves. [ Best Bluetooth speakers: We'll help you find the best wireless speakers for pairing with your smartphone or tablet—whatever your budget, and whatever music floats your boat. ] \nIBM says it alone has all the pieces to do the job from end to end. Many customers will combine those pieces with components from other vendors and service providers, so the company makes sure its offerings work with those of others. In fact, IBM has partnerships with several other enterprise IoT players, including AT&T and Cisco Systems . \nBut end-to-end expertise is IBM’s big sales pitch, and it's one that some customers may buy into. Complexity is up there with security as something that enterprises find hard about IoT, industry analysts say. \nAt the heart of the company’s offering is the Watson IoT Platform, which combines analytics, security, and other capabilities, including blockchain technology for authentication in some cases. The platform lets customers take advantage of a set of APIs (application programming interfaces), IBM’s SoftLayer cloud infrastructure, and all the analytical smarts that make up the Watson computing universe. Add consulting and ongoing support, and IBM can be a one-stop solution, the company says. \nImplementing IoT may have broad implications for a business beyond just deployment projects and changes in technology, said Jesus Mantas, general manager for IBM’s business consulting practice. For example, the way a company monitors its assets can change from a “pull” to a “push” process, he said. \n“You don’t need somebody to now go every day and check something,” Mantas said. “Event-trigger notifications do that. Well, that changes people’s jobs.” \nPart of what IBM can do for companies adopting IoT is help them through the business implications of the changes, he said. The IoT Solutions Practice applies to a broad range of industries, says IBM, which will first target automotive, electronics, industrial products, insurance, retail, transportation, and buildings. More than 1,500 experts at nine IoT centers around the world are dedicated to the practice. \nTo help enterprises work on how they’ll use IoT, IBM also offers free access to the Watson IoT Platform, said Brett Greenstein, IBM’s vice president for the platform. \n“They can use anything we have in our cloud, effectively, for free,” Greenstein said. As long as customer operations stay below a certain level, around a few dozen devices, they can keep the free access until they’re ready to move up to production scale. Related:",

      "text": "SHOW LESS (this item is currently being modified/updated with a \"derive\" task) This study invoices costs associated with the production of computer products and compares the cost of present computer printers to the cost of using the Xerox Computer Forms Printer (CFP), Xerox 1200 Computer Printing System, IBM 3800 Printing Subsystem or Computer output Microfiche (COM). The study is twofold. It first considers the cost of processing all multipart paper products on each of the alternate systems. The second consideration is a 40% conversion of these products to microfiche with the remaining products being processed on either the Xerox CFP, IBM 3800 or Xerox 1200. The anticipated 40% conversion to microfiche is based on studies in private industry and has been reviewed by Mr Steve Long, Federal Electric Corp, at Vanengberg AFB, who has been involved in computer-output-microfiche production for some time. Single part paper products were not considered for conversion in this report since we feel that some computer printerouts will still be required from the standpoint of convenience, and because the savings involved are minimal. Also, computer printers will still be required for certain special forms even though the Xerox and IBM equipment does have a forms overlay capability. (Author)",

November 22, 2016 From Switzerland to Princeton via IBM Research \nThis is the story of one of our recent Science Week visitors at our lab \nEach year, as part of our Science Week offering, the THINK Lab at IBM Research – Zurich hosts students who are considering a career in science, engineering, or other technical fields from many high schools in Switzerland. Our young visitors get to meet with our researchers, who describe their own careers and talk about what they do every day. We also show them our laboratories. \nWe’ve been offering the Science Week for over a decade, and the waiting list of schools that want to send us their students is very long. One school that is always on the list is our Lab’s neighbor: The Zurich International School (ZIS). \nThe hero of our story is Millian Gehrer, who studied at ZIS, and who actually visited us twice, having decided after his first visit that he too wanted to become a technologist. \nTo keep it short, he founded a software company as a hobby, got himself accepted to Princeton University, and worked this past summer at the Zurich lab as an intern. \nWhile he was here we interviewed him, and we think you will enjoy watching him tell us his views on what he experienced.

      "text": "IBM is on a push to offer IoT from development to production To help enterprises, the company is combining Watson, cloud, consulting, and services Senior U.S. Correspondent, IDG News Service | Nov 22, 2016 Email a friend Use commas to separate multiple email addresses From Your message has been sent. Sorry There was an error emailing this page. \nThe Internet of Things is Watson's next challenge. Samsung CES 2015 keynote in two minutes \nThe internet of things is so complex that some enterprises would rather turn to one vendor to determine the business case for an IoT deployment, design the system, roll it out, and operate it as a service. \nAt least that’s what IBM believes. The company’s combining several of its products and services into what it calls the IoT Solutions Practice. The move, announced Monday, is designed so customers can find all of IBM’s IoT offerings in one place. [ Read the InfoWorld reviews: Amazon eases developers into IoT . | Azure brings IoT to .Net developers . | Stay up on cloud happenings with InfoWorld's Cloud Computing Report newsletter . ] \nTurning IoT into a service isn’t a new idea. Consultancies like Accenture and carriers like Verizon, among others, say they can reduce the complexity of adopting these systems and making them pay for themselves. \nIBM says it alone has all the pieces to do the job from end to end. Many customers will combine those pieces with components from other vendors and service providers, so the company makes sure its offerings work with those of others. In fact, IBM has partnerships with several other enterprise IoT players, including AT&T and Cisco Systems . \nBut end-to-end expertise is IBM’s big sales pitch, and it’s one that some customers may buy into. Complexity is up there with security as something that enterprises find hard about IoT, industry analysts say. \nAt the heart of the company’s offering is the Watson IoT Platform, which combines analytics, security, and other capabilities, including blockchain technology for authentication in some cases. The platform lets customers take advantage of a set of APIs (application programming interfaces), IBM’s SoftLayer cloud infrastructure, and all the analytical smarts that make up the Watson computing universe. Add consulting and ongoing support, and IBM can be a one-stop solution, the company says. \nImplementing IoT may have broad implications for a business beyond just deployment projects and changes in technology, said Jesus Mantas, general manager for IBM’s business consulting practice. For example, the way a company monitors its assets can change from a “pull” to a “push” process, he said. \n“You don’t need somebody to now go every day and check something,” Mantas said. “Event-trigger notifications do that. Well, that changes people’s jobs.” \nPart of what IBM can do for companies adopting IoT is help them through the business implications of the changes, he said. The IoT Solutions Practice applies to a broad range of industries, says IBM, which will first target automotive, electronics, industrial products, insurance, retail, transportation, and buildings. More than 1,500 experts at nine IoT centers around the world are dedicated to the practice. \nTo help enterprises work on how they’ll use IoT, IBM also offers free access to the Watson IoT Platform, said Brett Greenstein, IBM’s vice president for the platform. \n“They can use anything we have in our cloud, effectively, for free,” Greenstein said. As long as customer operations stay below a certain level, around a few dozen devices, they can keep the free access until they’re ready to move up to production scale.

      "text": "How Trump’s Presidency Could Affect IBM and Its Peers PART 8 OF 9 What’s Providing Momentum to IBM’s Stock? By Anne Shields | Nov 18, 2016 2:07 pm EST IBM’s Strategic Imperatives segment \nSo far in the series, we’ve discussed how IBM ( IBM ) is going to be impacted under the regime of the new president-elect, Donald Trump. We know that given its 3Q16 results, IBM saw its 18th straight quarter without revenue growth. \nHowever, the company’s Strategic Imperatives segment, which refers to its investments in cloud, analytics, mobile, social, and security technologies, continues to grow. In the last 12 months, IBM’s Strategic Imperatives segment has garnered $32.0 billion in revenue, about 40.0% of the company’s total revenue. IBM’s initiatives and strategies \nIn 3Q16, in line with its keen focus on Watson , IBM launched a new service, the Watson Virtual Agent. IBM also announced a partnership with Siemens ( SIEGY ) to fuel the adoption of Watson in the healthcare space. IBM, along with Siemens, aims to help healthcare providers to deliver value-based care to patients with chronic ailments such as cancer and heart disease. \nThrough strategic acquisitions and partnerships, IBM is trying to boost its Strategic Imperatives segment, including its Watson cognitive computing system. According to IDC (International Data Corporation), cognitive computing is “one of six Innovation Accelerators that will drive digital transformation by opening new revenue streams, creating information-based organizations, and changing the way work is performed.” \nIBM is partnering not only in order to push Watson, but also to venture into rapidly growing and disruptive areas such as blockchain technology. In partnership with R3CV , Microsoft ( MSFT ) is also making a big stride in this space. \nLooking at consistent growth in IBM’s Strategic Imperatives segment, we can infer that the company is heading toward the future of information technology. The market sentiment seems to be improving for IBM’s stock. After hitting a six-year low in February 2016, it’s already risen by more than 35%. {\"metrics\":[\"Open\"],\"tickers\":[\"SIEGY\",\"IBM\",\"MSFT\"],\"ticker_names\":[null,\"International Business Machines Corp.\",\"Microsoft Corporation\"]} X",

      "text": "View Blog \nGuest blog by James Kobielus . James is IBM's Big Data Evangelist. He is an industry veteran who spearheads IBM's thought leadership activities in big data, data science, enterprise data warehousing, advanced analytics, Hadoop, business intelligence, data management, and next best action technologies. Prior to joining IBM, he was a leading industry analyst, with firms including Forrester Research, Current Analysis, and Burton Group. He has spoken at such leading industry events as IBM Information On Demand, IBM Big Data Integration and governance, Strata, Hadoop Summit, and Forrester Business Process Forum. He has published several business technology books and is a very popular provider of original commentary on blogs, podcasts, bylined business/technology press publications, and many social media. \nThe experience of being a working data scientist is not necessarily what people think. A profession that some regard as “sexy” is, more often than not, a difficult job involving long hours, tight budgets, limited staff, daunting tasks, shifting requirements, endless meetings, and inflated expectations. \nFor the working data scientist, pain points may dominate the fabric of their experience. High-performance data scientists are those who automate, accelerate, and streamline the more tedious aspects of their jobs so that they can focus on finding data-driven insights. They will embrace any tool, platform, or approach that can help free up mental bandwidth for tasks that demand their creativity and judgment. \nData scientists do exceptionally complex work. Their productivity depends on having access to tools and practices they can use to streamline and accelerate the details in which they immerse themselves. As discussed in this recent IDG News article , the most fulfilling experiences of high-performance data scientists fall into three broad categories: Learning : This is the core value that data scientists deliver: learning what insights the data may reveal and what relevance they may have to the business problem at hand. According to a data scientist who was quoted in the article, “The first step is understanding the area -- I'll spend a lot of time searching the literature, reading, and trying to understand the problem.\" It also involves continual reassessment of the available and appropriate data-science computational approaches, algorithms, tools, platforms, and services necessary to tackle these problems effectively within constraints of time, budget, and staff. Collaborating : This is the process under which data scientists engage with team members, colleagues, customers, and stakeholders. These activities—such as meetings and emails--often consume a substantial part of the data scientist’s day. It involves everything from identifying a client's business problem to assessing available data, tracking progress, discussing reports, sharing findings, explaining results, and putting the insights into an actionable business context. Productivity in this respect depends on the data scientists’ consultative skills: their ability to guide stakeholders through the process of identifying how data-driven insights can drive disruptive business outcomes. In the words of another data scientist quoted in the cited article, “A lot of people know they need help with data, but they don't know what they can do with it. It feels like being a magician, opening their minds to the possibilities. That kind of exploration and geeking out is now my favorite part.\" Creating : These are the nitty-gritty data science tasks such as discovering and preparing data, building and refining statistical models, visualizing and assessing findings, and developing data-driven applications. Productivity in this respect depends on the data scientist’s ability to leverage high-performance data mining, predictive analytics, machine learning, artificial intelligence, and cognitive solutions to automate these tasks. It also depends on their ability to determine the appropriate analytics technique for addressing classes of business problems, with a clear understanding of both basic and advanced data mining techniques, ranging from regression analysis, cluster analysis, decision trees, neural networks and Bayesian machine learning methods to optimization, simulation and stochastic analysis. \nOne of the most frustrating experiences for any data scientists is when they have to work with disparate, fragmented tools and platforms in support of various lifecycle tasks, such as source discovery, data preparation, statistical modeling, and visualization. Considering that data science is increasingly a team-oriented discipline, it’s essential that diverse data professionals—including statistical modelers, data engineers, business analytics, visualization designers, app developers, and others—be able to pool their efforts within open, collaborative environments. The collaboration tools that data scientists employ can make a huge difference whether they experience productivity or frustration in their daily tasks. Lack of an integrated development environment has unfortunate consequences for data scientist productivity: results that are unshareable, team collaborations that are are awkward, and cross-project visibility that is limited or non-existent. \nTo power high-performance data science, an integrated development environment should facilitate the following development tasks: Acquire data from diverse data lakes, big data clusters, cloud data services and more Discover, acquire, aggregate, curate, prepare, pipeline, model and visualize complex, multistructured data Prototype and program data applications for execution in in-memory, streaming and other low-latency runtime environments Tap into libraries of algorithms and models for statistical exploration, data mining, predictive analytics, machine learning and natural language processing, among other functions Develop, share and reuse data-driven analytic applications as composable microservices for deployment in hybrid cloud environments Secure, govern, track, audit and archive data, algorithms, models, metadata and other assets throughout their lifecycles \nNow in open beta, IBM Data Science Experience (DSX) delivers all of these capabilities in an open and integrated environment for team data science. DSX provides the following productivity features for next-generation data science: An interactive, cloud-based, scalable and secure visual workbench for consolidating open-source tools, languages and libraries and for collaborating within teams to rapidly put high-quality data science applications into production Access to open-source tools and libraries—including Spark, R, Python and Scala—as well as solutions from IBM, IBM partners such as RStudio and H20.ai, and others through an extensible architecture A unified environment for data scientists and other analytics developers that allows them to connect with one another while accessing project dashboards and learning resources, forking and sharing projects, exchanging development assets (datasets, models, projects, tutorials and Jupyter notebooks) and sharing results, with follow-on releases aiming to include comments, user profiles, data science competitions, Zeppelin notebooks and real-time collaboration Built-in connectivity to diverse data sources as well as simplified data ingestion, refinement, curation and analysis capabilities, with follow-on releases aiming to include new features such as data shaping, Spark pipeline deployment, SPSS analytic algorithms, automated modeling and data preparation, model management and deployment, advanced visualizations, text analytics, geospatial analytics and integration with Watson Analytics \nFor more information on DSX and to participate in the open beta, please visit this page . \nTop DSC Resources",

      "title": "IBM's computer vision research zeroes in on identifying skin cancer",
      "text": "ZDNet Japan IBM's computer vision research zeroes in on identifying skin cancer IBM's methods for identifying skin cancer in its tested data sets have performed as well as medical specialists. | Topic: Artificial Intelligence \nAfter years of working with New York's Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, IBM is using its cognitive computing power to zero in on a specific, all-too-common form of cancer: melanoma. \nA team of IBM research scientists has been testing computer vision techniques that could one day give doctors better tools to diagnose skin cancer. In a recently submitted report , the team is announcing that their system is now as good at recognizing melanoma as a medical specialist. \nGiven how deadly late-stage melanoma is, giving patients and doctors access to better diagnostic tools could have a major impact on public health and health care costs, Noel Codella, a cognitive computing and computer vision researcher at IBM, told ZDNet. \n\"Doctors can catch melanoma early, but it's costly to see your dermatologist, and dermatologists are not always accessible in all regions,\" he said. \"Even if you do see a dermatologist, they are prone to errors at times.\" \nDermatologists use an imaging technique called Dermoscopy to detect the disease in its early stages, but they tend to be overly cautious: up to nine lesions are surgically biopsied for every one melanoma discovered . Yet if the disease is caught early, patients who receive proper treatment have a five-year survival rate higher than 98 percent. If the disease progresses to the lymphatic system or beyond, the survival rate drops as low as 16 percent . \nIBM's vision is to use computer vision to analyze dermoscopic images for medical professionals: A doctor or nurse would use a Dermoscope attached to a smartphone or other camera to take a picture of the patients' lesion, send it to a cloud-based analytics service and get back a detailed report on it. The report could include information like a confidence indicator to help the doctor determine whether the patient has melanoma. It could also point out things like visual patterns on the lesion that could help determine a patient's risk. \nCodella likened the tool to a blood test. In other words, it would be \"a tool that helps a doctor provide a diagnosis, not a tool that provides the diagnosis in itself.\" \nThe IBM research team is still improving their algorithms and working to determine at what point their system could be clinically useful. There's currently \"no solid timeline\" for developing a product, Codella said. First, the team needs more data. \nAs Codella pointed out it a blog post , the IBM system -- even though it already performs as well as a clinical specialist -- has seen fewer than 3,000 lesions. That gives it the experience level of a medical student. \nThe IBM research team has trained and tested its system with a data set provided by the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC) -- the largest publicly available benchmark data set of dermoscopic images. \nWhile it's easy to envision a tool that patients could one day use to assess skin lesions themselves, Codella said \"there are a lot of concerns\" that need to be addressed before you put diagnostic equipment in the hands of consumers. \n\"You don't want to put a tool out there that unnecessarily calms them,\" he said. That being said, he added, there are already apps that help patients keep track of skin lesions so they can relay the information to their doctors. \n\"There potentially can be a lot of benefit from consumer applications,\" Codella said. \"At the end of the day, I think the field needs to try to figure out what is the best type of service that need to be provided that can help complete the workflow of clinical care while at the same time minimizing harm that could be done.\" Join Discussion",

      "text": "Reviewing IBM's $3 billion investment in Softlayer. \nTracking IBM's late arrival to the cloud party. \nFocus on a \"road map\" to $20 EPS has come at the expense of future earnings and growth at Big Blue. \nTen years ago, Amazon Web Services (NASDAQ: AMZN ) began offering cloud services, and soon thereafter, the company unabashedly proclaimed , \"In the fullness of time…computing is moving to the cloud.\" \nAmazon's \"everything-to-the-cloud\" enthusiasm caught a lot of people by surprise, and it was met with plenty of skepticism. Not surprisingly, it was heresy to the likes of IBM (NYSE: IBM ), seller of expensive hardware such as its zSeries mainframes. \nAfter all, IBM had turf to protect. Cloud data centers are not built around IBM technology, so if everything moved to the cloud - what would IBM sell? \nTen years later, it's clear: Amazon appears to have been right. Pretty much everything is moving to the cloud. The cloud is cheaper, faster, more secur e 1 , and, in our opinion, there's really no solid argument for staying with the inefficient and expensive hardware and software of the on-premise computing past. \nThe problem for IBM: It got a late start on the public cloud. \nLook at IBM annual reports in 2011 and 2012 and you'll see CEO Ginni Rometty casually dismiss cloud, barely mentioning the word in each of her first two letters. The planning and priority of IBM management back then, if you'll recall, revolved around a $20 earnings per share \"roadmap,\" a much ballyhooed 2015 earnings goal. \nThe realization finally came in 2013, seven years after Amazon launched its cloud business that, indeed, cloud computing is the future - and that future is already here. In our view, the company then made a hurried buy of SoftLaye r in mid-2013 to get in on some sweet cloud infrastructure action. They shelled out $2 billion, then went in hard with an investment of another billion dollars, bringing their total to a cool $3 billion. \nWhich gets us to IBM's $3 billion accounting challenge, an issue CFO Martin Schroeter, I believe, is surely aware of, and one that he must be planning on disclosing shortly. \nRemember Hewlett-Packard's embarrassing acquisition of Autonomy? \nSoftlayer is a comparable situation to and potentially just as embarrassing as Hewlett Packard's disastrous purchase of software maker Autonomy in 2011 for $10.3 billion. \nJust like with IBM's purchase of SoftLayer, HP appeared desperate to stay relevant in a rapidly changing world, and in our view rushed to buy Autonomy without performing adequate due diligence. HP ended up writing off 85% of their investment the following year in a maelstrom of controversy, and at last check, they're still pointing fingers in litigation. \nWe believe a write off of SoftLayer of similar magnitude (85%-90%) is almost certainly in the forefront of CFO Schroeter's mind these days. To comply with generally accepted accounting principles, a sizable write down is necessary, since SoftLayer is likely worth a tiny fraction of what IBM has invested. As we'll explain in a bit, SoftLayer is niche cloud player with limited functionality and limited upside. Its infrastructure products are not competitive in mid- and enterprise-level markets. \nBut first, let me mention a couple of twists to this story which make it particularly interesting. The first is that, in our view, IBM doesn't like to admit mistakes, especially when it comes its vaunted acquisition machine. There have been over 125 acquisitions since 2000, and I can't find a single write-down. The fact that IBM doesn't have any write-downs is suspect - nobody is that good all the time - and it just gets worse when you start looking at the $3 billion mess that is SoftLayer. \nAnother twist: HP came clean relatively soon after its botched acquisition of Autonomy, but IBM has yet to admit that the SoftLayer acquisition in July 2013 was a mistake. And, too, we believe IBM probably doesn't want to tell investors that it threw $1 billion more at the mistake and that effort failed as well. \nCompounding the problem, IBM management made numerous specific representations to investors about SoftLayer, assuring investors that it meets the needs of IBM's enterprise customers. \nCEO Ginni Rometty told investors on CNBC 2 that SoftLayer was built from the \"bottom up\" for enterprise, and that the acquisition was \"very wise,\" while CFO Schroeter made glowing representations, claiming SoftLayer was \"enterprise grade, enterprise capable,\" and that it was \"critical to the kind of enterprise clients we're attracted to.\" 3 \nIBM bought a small potatoes cloud operation. \nSo where are SoftLayer's enterprise customers, anyway? We can't find a single enterprise customer that selected SoftLayer over the hyper-scale data centers run by Amazon, Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) and Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ). \nEnterprise customers are IBM's bread-and-butter, the core of its customer base. IBM can get in the front door and pitch SoftLayer to enterprise, that's a given . So why doesn't enterprise want to move production workloads to the SoftLayer cloud? \nIt's likely because SoftLayer can't do the job. SoftLayer is a hosting scale provider and has never been anything more than that. It can't attract enterprise workloads because it lacks dozens of critical features and services that are routinely offered by hyperscale cloud providers. \nMeanwhile, in our opinion, IBM has not done much to add to SoftLayer capabilities. During the three years IBM has owned SoftLayer, the company has added just a few new services. By way of comparison, over the same time period Amazon Web Services added over 2,000 major new features and services to its cloud, many of which are game changers, like Aurora, Lambda and Workspaces. \nSo, wait a sec, you might ask, didn't IBM know it was buying a Little League cloud operation back in 2013? What sort of due diligence did IBM do on SoftLayer before its $2 billion acquisition? Shouldn't it have been obvious to IBM that there was a massive \"technology gap\" between SoftLayer and the hyperscale cloud providers that it wanted to catch? \nFounder Lance Crosby and VP Marc Jones were upfront with IBM about SoftLayer's technology when IBM came a-calling in 2013. SoftLayer's business model was built around purchasing off-the-shelf servers out of a Super Micro catalog. They took standard white box servers, connected them together, and rented them o ut. 4 T hat's it, nothing special, no super secret sauce, no unique edge in technology. \nWill IBM try to hide their mistake? \nAs CFO Schroeter knows, goodwill booked as a result of an acquisition can stay on the books indefinitely, but it must be tested at least annually to see if its value is still accurate. As Schroeter prepares to close the books, he'll have to gauge how much SoftLayer is worth in today's market. Is it worth anywhere close to the $3 billion that IBM has invested? \nUnfortunately for IBM, we believe a realistic value for SoftLayer is somewhere in the $300 to 400 million area, about one-half of its annual revenue. And that may be too generous. Values for smaller cloud providers have declined dramatically in recent quarters. Hewlett Packard, also late to the cloud, failed to find a buyer for its cloud, and simply shut it down. Same thing happened at Verizon (NYSE: VZ ). Others that have struggled include AT&T (NYSE: T ), Fujitsu, and CenturyLink (NYSE: CTL ). \nWhy are the values of smaller, hosting scale cloud providers headed south? It's due to the sheer breadth and scope of hyperscale cloud offerings - which encompass literally thousands of features and services that you can't find on SoftLayer. \nOne more thing you should know: Goodwill impairment charges - like the one that IBM should for SoftLayer - are non-cash charges. They don't cost anything. Billions of dollars have already been blown. And so you should think of an impairment charge as more like a confession. It's a way of being honest with shareholders as it tells them how much money was wasted and that management made a mistake. \nDisclosures: \nThe opinions expressed herein are those of Worm Capital, LLC and are subject to change without notice.

One of the primary reasons for the recovery was that the pace of revenue decline has slowed down in the last four quarters as contributions from their strategic imperative, the new group of business lines on which IBM is pinning all its hopes, have been on the rise. \nAlthough there are plenty of analysts who have written off \"Big Blue,\" saying that the company will never recover and that its glory days are over, it is hard to miss the fact that their new businesses are showing strong growth. Take their as-a-service unit, for example: in the last three quarters, the company’s as-a-service run rate has moved from $5.4 billion to $7.5 billion. The cloud unit has posted 46%, 50% and 65% year over year growth in the first three quarters of the current fiscal. \nHow does that compare with the growth of the cloud businesses of its rivals? \nThe top 3 cloud infrastructure companies in the world \nMicrosoft’s ( NASDAQ:MSFT ) and Amazon’s ( NASDAQ:AMZN ) growth rates in cloud infrastructure have been topping 50% during the same period, which means IBM has managed to keep up with its new-age competitors. Not bad for a company that many thought was fading away. IBM has, from the start, focused its efforts on the hybrid cloud model. Even though the jury is still out on whether that is the best direction for them, nothing is going to stop IBM’s IaaS offering - SoftLayer - from competing with Microsoft Azure and Amazon AWS. \nThe issue with IBM \nAdmittedly, IBM has been a bit slow and more reactive rather than proactive to developments in the cloud infrastructure industry despite being one of the earliest proponents of cloud. When compared to Amazon, who keeps launching new services at an alarming rate, any company would seem to lack the energy that Amazon possesses. Their AWS re:Invent conference keeps repeating the same pattern: the launch of myriad services. One of the primary reasons Amazon’s total revenue keeps growing at a fast pace while the company continues cutting back on its pricing (Amazon has slashed AWS pricing by more than 50 times since launch) is because it keeps adding more and more services to its stack. \nIBM does lack the kind of messaging power that says its cloud offering is the best and that it stays on the leading edge of innovation. This is possibly one reason why we do not talk about IBM SoftLayer in the same regard as Microsoft Azure or Amazon’s EC2. But fortunately for the company, that has not stopped it from growing. Their cloud business has been clocking a 50%-plus growth rate over the past several quarters. \nIncreasing competition in cloud infrastructure \nThe industry is still young and there is plenty more room to grow, but competition has increased manifold in the last year with Google ( NASDAQ:GOOG ) and Oracle ( NYSE:ORCL ) throwing their hats into the ring. The problem for Google is their own need. Their current infrastructure has possibly been stretched to its limit as the company needs to keep tracking information on the web, which keeps expanding on a daily basis. Oracle has no choice but to be in the cloud game because their database expertise will not save them if everybody moves into their competitors’ cloud. But both companies will need time to establish their data center networks. Though money will not be an issue for either of them, time will be. \nIBM, Microsoft and Amazon already have a huge lead over Google and Oracle, and if they can further increase the gap over the next year it will become even more difficult for the latter two to catch up. The speed at which IBM is able to move in the next year will be extremely critical for the company’s future. If they can continue to keep pace with Microsoft and Amazon, then it will be difficult to push it out of the competition. \nThe investment angle \nFrom an investor’s standpoint, this is the right time to get on the Big Blue Express. Their new business lines are growing and the decline in legacy businesses is slowing down. Very soon - within a few quarters - I expect them to return to growth. After that there is no turning back. They are already the leader in the analytics space with little to no competition and a leader in the hybrid cloud model. Their enterprise relationships are intact and they will leverage that to grow their analytics and cloud revenues to greater heights. What is not to like? \nDisclosure: I have no positions in the stock mentioned above and no intention to initiate a position in the next 72 hours.

He blamed a router failure. \nAustralian Bureau of Statistics boss David Kalisch told the same inquiry that the failure had cost taxpayers 30 million Australian dollars ($22 million). \nA report on the failure published on Thursday by Alastair MacGibbon, special adviser to the prime minister on cybersecurity, described the website's denial-of-service protections as \"inadequate.\" \nThe bureau's \"close and trusting relationship\" with IBM as a long-term contractor resulted in insufficient independent verification and oversight of critical aspects of the website, the report said. \nIBM had been awarded AU$1.55 billion in Australian government contracts since 2013 and the census website contract had been worth AU$9.6 million. \nMacGibbon recommended the government establish a \"Cyber Boot Camp\" where senior bureaucrats could learn cybersecurity fundamentals. \nHe found that no other information technology failure had done more damage to public confidence in the government's ability to deliver.

      "text": "View Blog \nGuest blog by James Kobielus . James is IBM's Big Data Evangelist. He is an industry veteran who spearheads IBM's thought leadership activities in big data, data science, enterprise data warehousing, advanced analytics, Hadoop, business intelligence, data management, and next best action technologies. Prior to joining IBM, he was a leading industry analyst, with firms including Forrester Research, Current Analysis, and Burton Group. He has spoken at such leading industry events as IBM Information On Demand, IBM Big Data Integration and governance, Strata, Hadoop Summit, and Forrester Business Process Forum. He has published several business technology books and is a very popular provider of original commentary on blogs, podcasts, bylined business/technology press publications, and many social media. \nThe experience of being a working data scientist is not necessarily what people think. A profession that some regard as “sexy” is, more often than not, a difficult job involving long hours, tight budgets, limited staff, daunting tasks, shifting requirements, endless meetings, and inflated expectations. \nFor the working data scientist, pain points may dominate the fabric of their experience. High-performance data scientists are those who automate, accelerate, and streamline the more tedious aspects of their jobs so that they can focus on finding data-driven insights. They will embrace any tool, platform, or approach that can help free up mental bandwidth for tasks that demand their creativity and judgment. \nData scientists do exceptionally complex work. Their productivity depends on having access to tools and practices they can use to streamline and accelerate the details in which they immerse themselves. As discussed in this recent IDG News article , the most fulfilling experiences of high-performance data scientists fall into three broad categories: Learning : This is the core value that data scientists deliver: learning what insights the data may reveal and what relevance they may have to the business problem at hand. According to a data scientist who was quoted in the article, “The first step is understanding the area -- I'll spend a lot of time searching the literature, reading, and trying to understand the problem.\" It also involves continual reassessment of the available and appropriate data-science computational approaches, algorithms, tools, platforms, and services necessary to tackle these problems effectively within constraints of time, budget, and staff. Collaborating : This is the process under which data scientists engage with team members, colleagues, customers, and stakeholders. These activities—such as meetings and emails--often consume a substantial part of the data scientist’s day. It involves everything from identifying a client's business problem to assessing available data, tracking progress, discussing reports, sharing findings, explaining results, and putting the insights into an actionable business context. Productivity in this respect depends on the data scientists’ consultative skills: their ability to guide stakeholders through the process of identifying how data-driven insights can drive disruptive business outcomes. In the words of another data scientist quoted in the cited article, “A lot of people know they need help with data, but they don't know what they can do with it. It feels like being a magician, opening their minds to the possibilities. That kind of exploration and geeking out is now my favorite part.\" Creating : These are the nitty-gritty data science tasks such as discovering and preparing data, building and refining statistical models, visualizing and assessing findings, and developing data-driven applications. Productivity in this respect depends on the data scientist’s ability to leverage high-performance data mining, predictive analytics, machine learning, artificial intelligence, and cognitive solutions to automate these tasks. It also depends on their ability to determine the appropriate analytics technique for addressing classes of business problems, with a clear understanding of both basic and advanced data mining techniques, ranging from regression analysis, cluster analysis, decision trees, neural networks and Bayesian machine learning methods to optimization, simulation and stochastic analysis. \nOne of the most frustrating experiences for any data scientists is when they have to work with disparate, fragmented tools and platforms in support of various lifecycle tasks, such as source discovery, data preparation, statistical modeling, and visualization. Considering that data science is increasingly a team-oriented discipline, it’s essential that diverse data professionals—including statistical modelers, data engineers, business analytics, visualization designers, app developers, and others—be able to pool their efforts within open, collaborative environments. The collaboration tools that data scientists employ can make a huge difference whether they experience productivity or frustration in their daily tasks. Lack of an integrated development environment has unfortunate consequences for data scientist productivity: results that are unshareable, team collaborations that are are awkward, and cross-project visibility that is limited or non-existent. \nTo power high-performance data science, an integrated development environment should facilitate the following development tasks: Acquire data from diverse data lakes, big data clusters, cloud data services and more Discover, acquire, aggregate, curate, prepare, pipeline, model and visualize complex, multistructured data Prototype and program data applications for execution in in-memory, streaming and other low-latency runtime environments Tap into libraries of algorithms and models for statistical exploration, data mining, predictive analytics, machine learning and natural language processing, among other functions Develop, share and reuse data-driven analytic applications as composable microservices for deployment in hybrid cloud environments Secure, govern, track, audit and archive data, algorithms, models, metadata and other assets throughout their lifecycles \nNow in open beta, IBM Data Science Experience (DSX) delivers all of these capabilities in an open and integrated environment for team data science. DSX provides the following productivity features for next-generation data science: An interactive, cloud-based, scalable and secure visual workbench for consolidating open-source tools, languages and libraries and for collaborating within teams to rapidly put high-quality data science applications into production Access to open-source tools and libraries—including Spark, R, Python and Scala—as well as solutions from IBM, IBM partners such as RStudio and H20.ai, and others through an extensible architecture A unified environment for data scientists and other analytics developers that allows them to connect with one another while accessing project dashboards and learning resources, forking and sharing projects, exchanging development assets (datasets, models, projects, tutorials and Jupyter notebooks) and sharing results, with follow-on releases aiming to include comments, user profiles, data science competitions, Zeppelin notebooks and real-time collaboration Built-in connectivity to diverse data sources as well as simplified data ingestion, refinement, curation and analysis capabilities, with follow-on releases aiming to include new features such as data shaping, Spark pipeline deployment, SPSS analytic algorithms, automated modeling and data preparation, model management and deployment, advanced visualizations, text analytics, geospatial analytics and integration with Watson Analytics \nFor more information on DSX and to participate in the open beta, please visit this page . \nTop DSC Resources",

So IBM shouldn’t offer its services to the federal government or the President-elect in order to take a political stance? It’s the wrong political stance to hurt the U.S. (by depriving the federal government of needed support) in order to hurt Trump. Ms. Rometty didn’t offer IBM’s expertise to implement Trump’s discriminatory propositions, rather other services that our federal government needs. It’s unpopular to offer the Trump administration support but we’ve also never seen such a shambolic President-elect and if there’s any incoming administration that needs help, it’s this one. Your ex-CEO was taking the high road.",

      "title": "How blockchain, the cloud, and design are joining to transform user experiences",
      "text": "IBM \nThis post was written by Sarah Plantenberg, Bluemix Garage Global Design Lead at IBM\nDesigners are constantly dreaming of and reimagining ways to make amazing experiences for people.\nEvery so often — or about once in a generation — a technology comes along that, when married with design thinking, throws off constraints and completely changes the game. Blockchain is our generation’s catalyst for a new wave of user experiences that may very well change the way companies think about themselves.\nBlockchain is a permanent and digitized chain of transactions, grouped together in blocks that cannot be altered, which creates an unchangeable record of every transaction.\nBlockchain is most powerful when transactions happen between multiple parties, because it enables true transparency without the need for a central authority. As such, relationships can be forged that never existed before, and very quickly.\nThink of any transaction in your life, perhaps one that might be challenging for you due to its complexity. If you’ve ever bought a used car, you likely wanted to know its history. The dealership or owner may have been able to provide you with this data, but could you trust it? Setting aside nefarious intent, is it possible the previous owner may have forgotten something?\nImagine if, throughout the lifetime of the car, every maintenance record was written onto a permissioned ledger. There would be no question about whether the car was properly maintained or had ever been in an accident or a flood. Complete transparency, anytime, anywhere — from banking to shopping to shipping. This is what blockchain offers.\nTo designers, such as those in IBM Bluemix Garages, blockchain is an inspiration. We can reimagine user interactions that previously had rules set by one party or another, and often without the consideration of transparency.\nWhen entrepreneurs and enterprises meet with the designers in our Garages, or our global network of collaborate hubs where product and design teams can come together to build with the cloud, they are able to reinvent entire transaction networks and ecosystems from scratch.\nOne of the best aspects of this new approach is that we can start designing new processes that benefit every party involved, from making complicated processes simplified for individual users to bringing new speed to entire industries.\nBlockchain holds potential that ranges from enabling new home buyers to be securely vetted for mortgages in as little as three clicks, to a Brazilian orange grower being able to easily and simply sell oranges on the global market.\nWe’ve already seen many companies around the world start to tap into the potential of blockchain to redefine their user experiences. For example, Singapore startup FreshTurf is working with a team at a nearby IBM Bluemix Garage to explore how blockchain might transform how individuals receive and track packages.\nOr consider KYCK!, another Singapore startup co-founded by three entrepreneurs who personally experienced frustrating inefficiencies when signing up for financial services. To help solve these, KYCK! turned to an IBM Bluemix Garage. \nBlockchain, combined with design thinking, enabled KYCK! to transform its processes completely, exploring how customers can more rapidly, easily and securely get up and running with financial services.\nAs designers, we’re continuously thinking of the user experience from all sides — from how companies operate to how they offer a product to customers. In many ways. Blockchain — and the ability to easily access it and work with it in the cloud — is what we’ve been waiting for. Blockchain has brought real change and transformation to industries around the world, and the way society experiences and interacts with them.\nWatch the video below to find out more.\nYoutube Embed:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/embed/kddX4GdScHM\nWidth: 560px\nHeight: 315px \n \nTo learn more about the new era of business, visit ibm.com/cognitive. \nThis post is sponsor content from IBM and was created by IBM and BI Studios. \n",

      "text": "American Airlines plans to use IBM’s public cloud to run some of its applications, both companies said early Tuesday.\nAmerican Airlines, like most large companies, has legacy applications to manage tasks and will move some of them to IBM’s ibm public cloud and use IBM’s BlueMix tools to modernize them. It did not specify which applications would move.\n“The agreement runs the gamut from software and services to infrastructure and also will include data analytics and Watson going forward,” said Patrick Grubbs, IBM’s vice president of travel and transportation. “ Watson” is IBM’s brand of artificial intelligence software that is being customized to suit various vertical industries.\nGet Data Sheet , Fortune 's technology newsletter. \nNeither he nor an American Airlines spokeswoman would put a dollar figure on the deal, which is not exclusive. In a prepared statement, the airline said that the cloud computing model, which lets companies add and delete resources as needed, will give it more flexibility and scale for some of its business software.\nIn September, American’s chief information officer Maya Leibman told the CIO Journal that the airline was evaluating a move to the cloud and expected to make decisions about it within months. This looks to be one of those decisions. The American Airlines statement noted that IBM was “a cloud partner,” so there is no exclusivity implied.\nAsked about that point, an airlines spokeswoman stressed that it is a big company that works with lots of tech providers. “We use the best and newest tools for the right applications,” she told Fortune . And, since this is new technology, there will be a lot of testing before it goes live.\nThe airline is not alone in this massive technology shift. Most large companies are weighing the need to keep building and operating their own data centers or moving more of those computing and data storage jobs to a third-party cloud provider like Amazon amzn Web Services, Microsoft msft Azure, Google googl Cloud Platform, or IBM SoftLayer.\nFor more on IBM, watch : \nThere will be more discussion about companies moving to the cloud at Amazon’s annual AWS Re:invent conference this week in Las Vegas, where Amazon will undoubtedly claim a list of customer wins . But while AWS is by far the largest public cloud purveyor, it doesn’t have this market to itself anymore. Microsoft , Google , VMware vmw , IBM, and others are all wooing enterprise customers with their respective public clouds.\nIt probably doesn’t hurt that IBM and American have a relationship going back decades. IBM, for example, worked with American Airlines on SABRE , the pioneering online reservation system.",

      "text": "Chris O’Conner, IBM’s General Manager for Internet of Things Offerings, has been involved with connected devices for almost 25 years. As a result, he has a unique view on the emergence of the Internet of Things (IoT), what it means for the future, and what we can learn from previous generations of technology. \nWe sat down with him as he prepared for IoT Slam to hear more and what he plans to talk about at the event. \nReadWrite : So as the General Manager for IoT, what does this mean for IBM? \nChris O’Conner : So for us at IBM it’s been a journey of experimenting with the IoT data, all these connected assets, And the early work that we did around Smart Planet. It proved that it was controlled, but the ability to do it in mass wasn’t quite there yet, and now we move to where we are today which is sensors are cheap, connectivity is easy given Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, low power long range capabilities, and cellular capabilities in abundance. As well as now the cloud is an accepted way to work both in both a public, private, and local fashion. And analytics are ruling the day in terms of being able to provide value and information, and thinking engines are now emerging as a way to understand the patterns and the variances of how well this data actually comes together. So you think about all this technology as the perfect storm and now these capabilities are becoming very affordable and can make the internet of things and its wealth of data actually processable by the average enterprise, company or corporation. \nRW : And that process is really important because the first way of IoT was sort of everyone running around the hooking sensors and then putting data streams onto everything they could find and it’s great I got these huge pile of data – okay, now what? And now you got to figure out how to take all that data and actually turn to insight and actable business information. \nCO : That’s correct. We think our clients need to think beyond the connection of the device. Fundamentally we see three types of the business that our clients strive for. The first is around operations and maintenance and product life cycle. This is driven by devices and I know whether it’s healthy, whether it’s well, whether it’s on, whether it’s off, whether it’s broken, whether it’s fixed. And I can more efficiently maintain that device to make something better for my enterprise if I know this. So many of the clients we work with can pay for the experimentation of an IoT system just by savings they get being able to change that equation. \nChris O’Conner, IBM General Manager for Internet of Things Offerings\nThe second pattern that we see is people talking to their clients. So many companies actually don’t really connect directly with their clients. They make devices, they put them into distribution channels, distribution channels, and then a retailer sells it. The manufacturer is not working with the client, it’s the retailer that actually talks to the client about the plus and minus of that particular product being sold. So with a connected device, the customer hooks it up and the manufacturer now has a direct connection for the first time and that’s a huge advantage. \nAnd then there’s a third area, just fundamentally watching all this information about how your products are being used. So, for example, you can change your warranty, so instead of saying a warranty is 36,000 miles for three years, you can have a warranty that says, if you drive your car into these cities and these geographies your warranty as this long. Or if you drive your car in these cities and these geographies, or if the car is exposed to salt and snow, you’d really re-invent your business and the service that you sell at the same time. \nRW : Do warranties even exist in five years? I mean if you’re building predictive models then you can sell products not as assets, but one with use case scenarios. If I’m selling tires and I had this information of where you live and whether there’s salt on the road and whether it’s at altitude, maybe I sell this product as a service and the idea of a warranty goes away. \nCO : I think that’s right. And the real benefit here is your predictive models get to account for all kinds of different variabilities and you get to also take the learnings from those predictive models to instantly tell other devices about it at the same time. \nAnd so it’s an individual process of learning, if you think of a car driving down the road with a certain set of conditions and then flips it can instantly tell all other cars about that flip and they can also account all other cars what to watch out, those cars now can watch, learn and take action instantly based off the knowledge of that first car. \nRW : And I love that because I think that’s where cognitive computing takes off when you start seeing the data pools overlap on each other and learning from each other and that’s when cognitive computing just kind of explodes. \nCO : Well, if you think about why we bought The Weather Company, it’s to be able to have that additional processing. And in the environment are other devices and then the context of weather plays into the variability of what should take place, so having learning points we think are the key aspect of IBM’s start with IoT. \nRW : Of course, with everything has been going on recently with all this data and all these sensors, over the last couple of weeks all of a sudden security is right back in the public eye. \nCO : If you think about security with IoT, we’ve solved this problem before. We solved this problem several times at the data center, we solved it when we went to client-server, we solved this problem when we started introducing cloud technologies inside the data center. But what you have going on right now is you have an end point. Some do simple things like a sports watch that simply transfers your heart rate, some do incredibly complex things like a car driving down the road or an airplane up the sky, and they require incredibly complex types of interaction. \nRW : But the thing about that is you’re saying we’ve solved this before, but we now have people entering this market who don’t have a data legacy, so the problem with IoT is people connecting devices who don’t have that background and don’t realize the implications. \nCO : That’s right. So if you’re going to be connecting your device you need to do a little business security pattern work even if it is something that seems non-threatening. You have to think that if you are putting together this system and you’re getting ready to sell something that you buy from suppliers, you need to sit down and map it out. Am I going one-way, am I going the two-way with my data, am I storing anything, do I take any personal information, where does that go? You actually need to kind of write the things down each step of the way. And we will learn as an industry and that’s part of the growth, unfortunately, but it’s part of the growth. \nRW : So based then on people learning, what do you going to be talking about on IoT Slam? \nCO : So IoT Slam , it’s a great time because it’s such a wonderfully diverse set of people from individuals to educational institutions to systems integrators to device manufacturers. We’re going to talk about some of the trends and directions we think are relevant around the IoT and we’re going to talk about some of the technologies that relate to business use cases around security, around usage of things like blockchain, around usage of the IoT platform and what is that do for you if you use one. Why do you want to use one versus putting one together, maybe, yourself and so we’ll talk a little about trends and directions and some best practices we see and generally use it as a way to seed the discussion for what we hope is really good forum and opportunity to get people to talk as individuals and groups around the internet of things. \nThe post How IoT is making IBM’s Smart Planet smarter appeared first on ReadWrite .\n",

      "text": "International Business Machines' (IBM) Management Presents at Credit Suisse Technology Broker's Conference (Transcript) Nov.29.16 International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE: IBM ) Credit Suisse Technology Conference November 29, 2016, 03:15 PM ET Executives Kulbinder Garcha - Credit Suisse Kulbinder Garcha Okay. Great. I think we'll get started. My name is Kulbinder Garcha. I’m the IT hardware analyst from Credit Suisse. We’re very pleased to have from IBM Martin Schroeter, who is the SVP and CFO of the company. So Martin, welcome. Thank you for attending. Martin Schroeter Thank you, Kulbinder. Kulbinder Garcha And there is a lot of questions I have for you, maybe a broad one to start off is, I think you've spoken about as many times over the last two years, IBM are going through their own transformation in a major period of transformation for IT. So, during that period of time like what are the disruptions IBM are facing and what are the opportunities you’re already pursuing trying to reposition the business? Martin Schroeter Sure, sure. It is a good high level high question with switch to start Kulbinder. So, our view of enterprise IT is really being forged around this idea that cognitive and cloud computing and I’ll talk more about each of those pieces in a moment, but those two elements are driving the agenda in enterprise. And the timing if you will is right for both of those, in one sense the amount of data that our clients have already and quite frankly the amount of data they’re creating everyday in order to -- when they run their businesses and in order to help them understand their clients and how they serve their clients best is creating an opportunity for us where we can no longer, nobody can any longer just program a computer to find relationships that you're looking for. It's just too much data and so in a world where a system has to learn about the data, you have to find a way to interact with it. That's roughly for a non-technical person, that's roughly what we're talking about when we say a system where cognitive will influence and affect every decision that companies will make over time. So the world of cognitive is here because of the amount of data that our clients and companies already have as well as how much is being created by the world today. Now all of that requires an amount of compute and amount of power that is not available for everyone to invest in, but that's where the cloud comes in and so there is obviously an economic element to moving into a cloud environment, but more importantly for our clients, we see an ability for access to these kinds of cognitive applications as well as an agility that you get from your business and running in a cloud environment. So when we think about those two disrupting events, cloud and cognitive, we think that those drive the agenda for our clients. Now for us, within IBM, we've been talking about both of those things now for a number of years, in fact nearly three years ago now we laid out our view of our parts of the business that were focused on those parts of -- on those parts of enterprise IT. We called them at the time as we did today, we call them strategic imperatives and we started talking about how big they were and their rate of growth and the kinds of things that our clients were doing with them. And then last year, beginning the last year, so nearly two years now beginning of last year we changed and formulated some solution units within IBM as our clients want to consume, have more of solutions offering said if you, will solutions mindset to how they want to consume IBM. We put together if you will solution units like security, which has both software and services and we put together a solution unit around commerce. Last year we formed the Watson Health Group. So, our response has been let’s build the leading infrastructure play. As you know, we bought SoftLayer and have since developed software quite dramatically into from what it was including acquiring some video capabilities to build the Cloud video platform. So we built the cloud platform now on top of which we've invested in a set of technology such as Bluemix to build a platform. So our clients can now build their applications the way they’re used to building them with access to their datasets in a secure environment. And then on top of that, we've added a whole series of data services and quite frankly data, which now brings a cognitive cloud if you will into existence, but it's always done on an industry basis. The Watson Health Cloud is a unique, that’s unique cloud. It runs on that infrastructure, but the data that's available is obviously relevant to -- relevant to an industry, the health industry. We have just announced Watson Financial Services, which will be focused on obviously the financial services industry, but firstly it will be focused on the regulatory and compliance elements of the financial services industry. So the trends again that we identified a few years ago have evolved the way we run IBM. We changed as you know earlier this year our segment reporting as we've changed the way we run IBM. Really is to again give our investors a focus on not only the idea of that trend of cognitive and cloud, but just as importantly, how we’re responding to that and where our investments are going and how big those businesses are becoming for us. Kulbinder Garcha And maybe two follow-ups and on the strategic imperatives side we're still seeing I think the businesses just over $30 billion in terms of size may be $32 billion and is going still quite well $0.15 in last quarter, but the real growth has slowed and that’s probably naturally comes now to $32 billion business. It wasn’t keep going to 25% to 30%, but do you think with the investments you’ve made, that level of growth is sustainable and what you know that in getting there is ultimately the real growth there determines when the entire business will actually probably one day start growing hopefully or should we expect deceleration or do you have to see dual acquisitions? How should we think about the growth profile of that segment specifically? Martin Schroeter Sure. So within strategic imperatives as you said, we grew about 15% last quarter. When we started talking about them as a part of our business, again nearly three years ago, we said that by the end of 2018 it would be about 40% of our business and it would be about $40 billion in total in size. So both a mix statement as well as an absolute size statement. As you noted in our last trailing 12 months, we're about $32 billion. So in terms of progress that most recent quarter of growth of 15% puts us what I would say is ahead of the track to get to $40 billion. Just if you do -- just do math, we have to grow between $10 million and $11 million from here in order to get to the $40 million and so I'd say we’re on track in terms of what we need and what we've counted on. Now the investments we've made are driving that growth and from an acquisition standpoint, clearly some of the rate of growth that sits in their are the acquired content that we bought, but when you think about what we bought for instance in healthcare, we bought four companies, we bought, Phytel, Explorys, Merge and Truven Health and we've put them together. And so the rate of growth that we're delivering out of those four is really the businesses they were in before. It's only now that our research and our development of solutions on top of that platform are starting to come into market and so while we will certainly wrap on the acquisitive content, we're going to start to see now the acceleration of the solutions we bring to market in Watson Health and that's true in a number of our acquired content. So we just closed on Promontory Financial, one of the leading regulatory and compliance specialist and FSS. Obviously not yet even in the ledger, but we will take the regulatory and compliance experts that Promontory have and we will turn that knowledge base into a cognitive solution, which will then get delivered in a cloud delivery model through Watson and so the banks will start to consume that, but that's all in front of us still. Right, so clearly within strategic imperatives, acquisitions have helped, but we're only now getting into that ramping point if you will of the things we build on top of each of those solutions. And so from a rate and pace, as you noted, we do --the growth rate slows because of the magnitude of the business. We were about $28 billion last year. So we added $3.5 billion in a year and while that $3.5 billion some acquisitions we do see -- we do see the rate and pace to make sure we get to the $40 billion and 40%. We're actually already -- we'll make the 40% this year, I would expect. But the $40 million and 40% by the end of 2018 is certainly a pace that's still ahead of us. Kulbinder Garcha I guess then switching to the other side of the business, we sometimes call core is the rate of decline more predictable now in a few years ago I guess for the entire organization of IBM to stabilize and grow? That's what investors are really waiting for I think at some point in the future. And so could you speak about has the rate of decline accelerated there? It looks like it may have done. Is it now more forecasted in the part of business? There it narrow cannibalization I suppose from one side to the other anyway, but just in terms of getting back to be a more stable entity, are we close to that environment, what needs to happen? Martin Schroeter Well a few things about -- again we do call it the core really because we never came up with a better name for it but when we look at that business a few things, one most of those businesses are in declining markets. So we are for instance, we continue to support high transaction processing content on our Power platform, but a lot of that's delivered in a UNIX environment, UNIX is a declining market. We continue to -- we continue to support our clients in businesses and processes that are vital to the way they run, but those are focused on really on productivity -- on their productivity and our client's productivity is another way of us saying that's a revenue decline for us. IT -- enterprise IT has always been about delivering productivity and so that's no different now and when we look at our revenue streams then, what our clients are doing, the behavior of our clients is exactly what you said, which is there is not a lot of displacement, it's not like one is going up and it's replacing the other. Our clients view it as look you run this process for me. It's a really important process, but I need productivity out of that just like I demand productivity out of all my business processes. So I'm going to take the productivity you give to me in that part of the business and I'm going to reinvest it in these new areas. So I can find new ways to engage with my clients. So I can find new -- build new tools to understand -- new models to understand my clients better. So our revenue streams as the incumbent look very much like the transformation that our clients are going through, which is deliver productivity to me in a set of businesses that I can then reinvest and therefore our revenue streams look as you said, we have one that continues to decline and one that grows fairly rapidly and at some point, the math would just say those will crossover and will get a different overall portal. Now within the core though, there is -- again their businesses that are in declining markets some of it though is by engineered shift out of certain businesses, so in our global business services business, our consulting business as an example, we have -- we were very big in implementing large scale ERP and we had all the right skills. It was a differentiated marketplace at the time, that our company's ability to implement those was -- your ability was differentiating and because of our client base global clients, we could line up well in a global way with them. So that was a differentiated marketplace, good margins, that started to shrink, those margins were put under pressure. There is a lot of price pressure in the marketplace because there are fewer of those large ERP deals. So we started pulling our resources away and we started shifting them into other areas and into labor-base business obviously. We have fewer people working on something. You're going to have fewer billable hours and therefore there is an engineered component if you will to that core decline as well. But the bulk -- again the bulk of the core is in declining markets and it’s a productivity-driven business, productivity for our clients and then it gets reinvested in these new areas. Kulbinder Garcha I said the deliberate part on the IBM side with let's say GBS where you've chosen to exit or minimize exposure, that's caused obviously some headwinds to revenues, are we past the hardest part of that on terms of headwinds to your company? Martin Schroeter Yes. Martin Schroeter I think in GBS, we look for a few things. First, the revenue in GBS in any given 90-day period is going to be driven primarily not solely, but primarily by the backlog. The backlog is build by signings. So we've gone through a process where we've taken again pools of people who are focused on signing clients to big contracts and shift them into other areas. So we did see continuous signings declines in GBS, which meant the backlog was declining. Now we have gotten the signings piece back to growth again first time and so as signings grow, that will build that backlog and when that backlog grows then the revenue will start to grow. So we've gotten step one of the process if you will through and now we have to build the backlog enough to deliver revenue growth in GBS, but the process from a more operational perspective if you will has a business now that has a little bit more than half of it in these new areas already. So it's mixed faster than IBM in total right has. As I said, about 40% of our trailing 12 months were strategic imperatives, but within GBS, it's a bit more than half just over half. So they're actually making the transition a little bit faster, but we do have to get through this, signings have to grow, so backlog can grow, so that revenue can grow. Kulbinder Garcha And maybe going back to Watson, I guess a lot of profile in the company on the health side I think, can you speak about the building blocks of scaling that business and in getting guys in the healthcare side it kind of settle with the four acquisitions you made over the last year or so, year and half, you're actually buying almost data to then like a lot of business that you apply to a vertical. Is that the risk to work for financials as well? Do you have to buy in a bunch of talent and resources in their terms, then you apply the Watson and should we think about this timescale wise or when the IBM let's say breaking out Watson and saying it's their significant business is at five years away? Is it longer? Do you think that's a very ambitious business model? I'm just trying to figure out when investors can see the benefit in the actual? Martin Schroeter So couple of points first on how we built healthcare because it is a good example, but it's not the only way to build a business like this. So our opinion in having -- we have healthcare clients now. We're doing different work than we are in our healthcare business, but in working with our clients, what was clear that the industry and quite frankly the bet we're making, the industry is going to go through a tremendous upheaval as it converts from to over-simplify a fee-for-service to a fee-for-outcome kind of a model right. And whether you're a payer with a profit motive like we have insurance companies here or if you're a government who has got to keep its citizens healthy, that pay-for-service to pay-for-outcome is a shift that the healthcare industry is going to. Therefore in our view the only way to survive, the only way to thrive, the only way to deliver proper healthcare is you have to have a system -- cognitive system that can ingest all of the data that exists today in a way that allows you to get the right method of treatment soon, that allows you to get the right linkages and the right clinical trials early and in a complete way, so that you can put together, you can put together that string of treatment and fit within whatever that envelope happens to be when that payer decides in total how much they're going to allocate. So that's the environment in which we -- in which we found ourselves. We didn’t have a role there except that as we talked to our clients, we had a role as being trusted by potential partners and we played the role there for that, if we can bring some of our own data into this mix and since they trust us with their data, now we can build a differentiated value proposition as this industry goes through that transformation that allows us to help deliver outcomes with the best most knowledgeable purpose of data that can exist. So our acquisitions got us into not only the healthcare space, but as you noted, they came with the lot of data and that data has by and large re-used rights. So when we bought Merge Healthcare, Merge Healthcare has billions of images, a percentage of which we get to reuse to train Watson, so that Watson now knows exactly what every broken bone looks like, knows what cancer cells look like, you can read an X-ray right. So when we say we taught Watson to read, we’re talking about reading an X-ray. When we bought Truven Health that came with analytics and came with data around payer data. So you can link now how much ultimately did the payer wind up having to fund as this person with this kind of condition go through the process. When we bought Explorys and Phytel, similarly they came with care management, patient management data or it came with clinical data couple hundred million lives worth of data. So again in this view of how healthcare was going to evolve in a pay for outcome world, we have the trust, we had to bring some data into this because otherwise it was just that our clients and our partner's data that was going to come in and that wasn't going to be enough them over the line. So we brought our own data in now our clients and our partners are bringing their data into the equation, but with a really important -- really important element of trust which is their data is giving them insights. It's not just feeding a giant health cloud for everyone to use. So our health cloud has our data in it and can we get some additional insight from their data, but by and large their insights go to them and so when we think about how that model applies to other industries, at this point I would say maybe. Now nothings like healthcare, right. What I just described is unique to healthcare in the financial and regulatory or in the financial industry it is not like that at all. There are elements, do banks want to share all their data only to the extent maybe it helps to manage risk, only to the extent it gives them some additional insight, but you need someone who can sit in the middle of all that and then there are single, there are single top of the list, single largest productivity inhibitor right now is trying to get through the regulatory frameworks because they’re so complex and so voluminous. And so Watson will be applied to help understand and ingest all of the financial and regulatory data, will have experts to help train Watson and then Watson will get deployed to help them navigate regulatory and compliance that's a lot different from building a healthcare business. So do I think we need to acquire something in every vertical, hard to know, it depends a lot on the industry. Healthcare I think was probably at one extreme because both the industries has to transform and the amount of data that’s there has to be dealt with in a way that preserves insights for our partners and in financial services, it’s a little different. A lot of the data is up in the brain already right and the experts and then obviously there's this big regulatory compliance and we’ll see if we build others, if we have to acquire, but these aren’t like Promontory was in billions of dollars right, Promontory is a much smaller investment for us. Healthcare was a big investment. Kulbinder Garcha And in terms of the benefits, the business on the benefits, so it's in the healthcare side to your clients the benefit is less misdiagnosis, significantly influence in their productivity and some of the wastage of healthcare costs around and those are very significant. They reduce some, is that the right way of thinking how they benefit and then how does the business move to IBM working those improvements that say inefficiency of the customers… Martin Schroeter Yes, so it’s a little bit different depending on, but the way that at the bottom at the base level of all this, it is a value priced offering. So in some cases we have -- we create value by preventing an expense for an emergency room treatment and so we will capture a piece of that -- of that savings or that cost avoided. In some cases it is getting through genomics data faster than they can do it today and so it's the number of, it’s the number of patients that go through it that get -- that we price it on. But typically again value-based pricing, cost avoidance, access to the database in some cases but it is very much a value-based pricing idea. Kulbinder Garcha And in terms of time horizon before like you think this could be something that what you talk about it very often but whereby it actually starts moving the needle on what's been an $80 billion business in that? Martin Schroeter So, Watson as -- the bulk of Watson sits in our software solutions business right, which is growing and as part of Cognitive Solutions. So, that’s a growing business today, but Watson is also -- it's a silver thread that runs through a number of these businesses right. So Watson Health is a business. Watson Financial Services would be a different business. Watson the platform is a different business again. So our engagement with an insurance company helping their clients which use to Watson helping their clients answer questions about policies and things, that’s a Watson platform element, which is the different from Watson Health. So Watson is sort of a silver thread, it's not a thing if you will. Now we will talk -- over time, we’ll talk more and more about Watson, but for now I think the way to think about it is how does -- how can IBM best leverage that technology into an ecosystem that makes that cognitive technology the most valuable if you will in these verticals, healthcare and banking and regulatory and that's what we're focused on now is building out that ecosystem and that’s why we've opened up for instance the APIs to Watson. So that anyone who wants to, anyone who has a dataset, they don't need to come to us. They can plug into the Watson APIs and embed conversation for instance into their work. They can embed Watson analytics into their work. So the Watson APIs are open and we’ll see how all of that develops over time, but right now it’s really important I think to build that ecosystem around Watson and make sure that it's a silver thread that runs through all of those offerings and then of course we use Watson internally as well for our own work and so it's a -- there is a productivity element for us as well. Kulbinder Garcha Do you think at some point you can start sharing more metrics on it or is that still years away? Martin Schroeter Well, we do talk about it. Now we’ve talked about it in the context of its capabilities. We talked about it and try to give, we've tried to give examples of our clients are deploying it. Those are I think the important things for people to really its again -- its not a consumer thing right. So for investors, for client, when you have a consumer thing, it’s easy to understand because you get to use it. So we’re trying to make sure people understand how Watson can be used and the way our clients are creatively using it today and so I think the focus again still has to be for us on grow that ecosystem, make sure it's a silver thread that runs through, but Watson will -- it will be the silver thread through many of these businesses. Kulbinder Garcha Great and maybe if we change slightly to workforce or balancing some of the efficiency you’re trying to drive across the organization. When I speak to investors there is still some confusion I believe about how to think about the benefits of this year's workforce rebalancing, which was much larger than we’ve seen some of the previous years. And I think what you said earlier on the shares can be a $1.5 billion charge, but it's potentially a $2 billion benefit over time. And what I am getting at is, is that more of a direct cost action whereby there is cost through it. If you take out and then you retain a certain amount and hence profitability is higher or do you more see as where you need to change the skill in our organization and so we maybe downsize in a certain area, but we are in effect rehiring into areas that Watson or areas on the growth side and in that drives productivity and in that ultimately helps you on the bottom-line which of those two extremes, how should we think about this year's workforce rebalancing? Martin Schroeter Yes, I would think about it in both of those ways actually because and we talked about this when we announced first quarter results and we had gotten -- we had gotten through the announcement if you will of what of what we did, we really did two things. So part of this was remixing our skills base. As you said some skills, the marketplace just doesn't value any more, we don't have demand for them. So we move those skills out and then we bring on a new set of skills. We were hiring doctors and nurses today. Five years ago, we didn’t hire many doctors and nurses to build their healthcare business. So there is an element of this that is skill shift and reinvestment into skills. There is also an element of it quite frankly that was, what I would call capacity reduction right, which will ultimately unless we replace the capacity, but we’ll do that when we have the right demand profile. So to the extent we don't see the demand profile capacity reduction will show up in the bottom line and even within capacity reductions, it's not a straight, it's not a straight reduction of spending. It's really a couple of things, there are not so much in the U.S., but in many of the countries where our services business for instance hasn't been able to work its way through a better delivery models and where there are very difficult labor laws that we have an inflexible labor market. We were able to reduce some of that capacity and put in -- put into place a better delivery, more productive delivery model to service those clients. And so we’ll get some benefit out of that. It's not a 100% down and therefore you get it all, but you do get some mixed benefit on a delivery model, again not so much in the U.S. but in other places. So the total that we talked about back in April when we did the first, the total was a pretty substantial number and as we get into -- as we get into '17, we will have a better view of how much capacity will actually stay out and how much are we going to reinvest and then how much of the skills that we still need to remix into. So it will be a mix of both of those things. Kulbinder Garcha And then also on the another area of investor debate is that every year there is in the IBM earnings as items are one-time in nature, that we might regard as one-time in nature, but tend to be more reoccurring sometimes as well, but this year however, I look as the Japanese tax settlement again or will that happen in Q1? Martin Schroeter It was a court ruling. Kulbinder Garcha Right and then so there was that and then there was a somewhat lower tax rate than we would expected in Q3 and these seems like more like less recurring items, does that create a headwind for earnings or when you look versus all the things that IBM and the levers you have to deliver earnings are they able to offset or perhaps we're now used to seeing, how should we think about that going forward? Martin Schroeter Well first clearly, we're a big company, 162 countries in which we do business. So there are always one-time elements that flow in or non-recurring I guess is the right way. So we do have a -- we do have a pretty long list of recurring non-recurring things, that's probably the best way to think about it. And the Japan tax case was a good one, right. It's been on the books for a number of years. We were glad we won right, but we we're not going to do that again. We don’t have another case in Japan that we're litigating. So that doesn’t mean that we're not going through audits in the other 161 countries and we got to settle all through that. So there are always this long series that Japan tax case win will not be repeated next year. Now having said that, the tax rate which in the third we're kind of in the same place where we started the year, 18 plus or minus 2, that's going to be a function of the mix of our business right. Again when you operate in a 162 countries and our income streams aren’t mix the same way as our revenue streams. So we have two-thirds of our revenue outside the U.S., but not that much of our income, not as much of our income is outside the U.S. We're more split 50-50 right. So we still have higher rate here in the U.S. and we've got the benefit of lower rates in some other parts, but depending on how the business evolves both in the quarter and next year, it's really going to reflect the mix of the income streams in all the countries in which we operate. It's neither a one time or a discrete element. It's just the flow of the business. To the extent we make more in low tax countries our rate goes down to the extent we make more in high tax countries our tax rate goes up. So we still think as we talked about on the call we said this year 18 plus or minus 2 and I still think that's what we still see. It depend a lot though on the mix of the business and we have because of the skew of our business, we have a lot ahead of us still and even in the fourth and then next year we will have a new different view of where the mix is for next year. As far as though other one-time impacts that we've absorbed and we try to talk about these on the call as well, we had to write-down for instance our shareholding in Lenovo earlier in the year. We've taken hits for revaluation in Venezuela. The same list well not everyone as Lenovo stock like we did, but the same list that a lot of others had right one-time and then we of course had a big impact from currency this year as we did last year. So if touch wood, if the currency environment stayed stable, we would not recreate the billion-plus impact to earnings next year that we had this year, but we don’t know what that impact or that impact might be. We do and I've always said that a weaker dollar is on balance better for IBM. But we don’t know where it's going to be. So yes there are a series, there are always discrete events that are not repeatable. The Japan tax is a good one, but there are also a bunch of other things that will not likely come back to us next year as well, at least not at the levels that were this year. Kulbinder Garcha Is VM on that point, is their workforce rebalancing, would you view it, it looks like a very big number compared to last five years. Is it exceptionally high this year just $1.5 million is that something else that would help for you booking in that obviously? Martin Schroeter Yes we'll talk more about next year in total, but right now I don’t see -- I don’t see that size of a charge in our earnings stream next year because it wasn’t just workforce rebalancing. It was also a capacity reduction and modernizing if you will or making more contemporary, the way IBM works. So we've been shifting our development teams into much more agile environments. We've been shifting our services teams into much closer proximity agile squads if you will and that means you have to change the way your real estate footprint looks around the world. And so in the first quarter in addition to workforce balancing, part of that charge was also to get out of certain sites of real estate that we don't have any more, again to get the teams back together as opposed to so spread out and become more agile. Do I think we’re going to recreate all of that. That’s an ongoing process, but again I don’t see the same level we saw last year. So at this point, I don't see that magnitude of an impact. Kulbinder Garcha Then on intellectual property one thing that in the last couple of quarters in your results, you've talked about more, it sounds like its slightly new intellectual property business model. I know you break this out quite clearly in the filings between I think you call it sales of IP, sales of IP and then custom development and licensing and it looks like there has been more on the sales side. So can you speak about how the intellectual property strategy has shifted over the course of last year is going very well this year. The sustainability of that number, is there any lumpiness that we should be thinking about? Martin Schroeter Yes, we’ve been working on rebuilding their IP portfolio in our IP pool for a while now. It used to be years and years ago. It used to be between $1.5 billion and $2 billion right. Now the mix of that was different, very heavily at the time many, many years ago it was a way for us to continue to invest in semiconductor manufacturing and semiconductor design when we were the subscale provider right. So even though we're subscale, that doesn't mean that the dollar it takes to be competitive there subscale, you have to invest at the same rate that the others are in order to stay competitive and at the leading edge of microprocessors and so the way we did that at the time was we brought in joint development partners, we brought in licensing partners who paid part of the way right, they paid for us to continue to develop leading as microprocessors and to give them share with them our semiconductor manufacturing technologies. That's diminished over time both because we've licensed everyone who wants to be licensed and then we divested of the semiconductor manufacturing operation so those aren’t -- bulk of those are in hours anymore, but that's been diminishing. Now we've always found other ways to monetize our IP and what you're seeing now is both an example of what we've been doing for a while which I'll talk about and then we have some new things that we're building as well. So today when we license, when we license not sell, but when we license some of our source code, the model we have is we look at the marketplace, we look at the software and we look at the market in which these products operate and if we see a declining market that means, that in order to keep that functionality growing because clients want improved functionality just because we see a declining market doesn't mean they don’t want that solution to continue to have new function. We see declining market place and therefore we don't want to take these really valuable skills and invest them into a declining market place, but we have partners who view it as a growing opportunity either because they don't have that part in their portfolio or they are in a different part of the world where that marketplace is growing and so they license from us the source code which they then, they invest their skills and they build it into a growing business. For us we jet in our INE if you will when we get, when we deliver the value, we book something. Both of that's still ahead of us because these business cases for our partners are built on the idea that they’re going to grow the revenue and as they grow it, we’re going -- they’re going to pay us a royalty for it an ongoing royalty. So   turn what is really a challenge in how you allocate scarce development skills when you have lots of opportunities that are growing, we can turn it into a future growth stream in terms of royalty by giving -- by licensing them. These are all non-exclusive, but licensing them the source code and letting them do it, that's not dissimilar to what we've done in the past. We have more that we're working on because it's quite a powerful model for us, but at the same time we are building with our new capabilities a set of intellectual property and royalty streams that don’t even show up yet. So as an example we have a partnership with a pharmaceutical manufacturer that we haven’t delivered any value yet. So there is nothing in the ledger, but it's really focused on helping them build a new blockbuster drug and the structure of the agreement is if and I will generalize it, but if we help them build a drug that has global sales of $100 million, we get some royalty X percent. If we help them build a drug that is blockbuster billion dollar, we get like 3X of the royalty. So it's a way for us with our data and what we've built in our health cloud again to monetize the IP of all the data we've collected helps them focus on blockbuster drugs and we'll build a future IP stream, none of that again is in there yet because we haven’t done anything yet. So we're building these future stream as well. So I would expect again does IP -- to answer your question is IP have -- is there a variability to it certainly. Each of these deals is variable but we have a pretty broad portfolio and we are focused on trying to grow this again. So while the semiconductor piece will continue to decline, this is still in hundreds of millions, but it will continue to decline. There are new opportunities opening up for us in order to keep that income stream trying to grow. Kulbinder Garcha Okay. Maybe one last question on the broad objective companywide margins, over the last two years I think the combination of some revenue pressure, business mix changes, reinvestments in the business, we've seen [bulk] of the PTI business, sorry the PTI margin X rebalancing and X gains. We expect I think a true measure profit of the business, there has been this pressure. How close are we to the trough in margins and then there is one thing I want you to specifically comment on, has the strategic imperatives margins, has that been coming down over the last year or two? I can't tell frankly by looking at the numbers because there are lots of moving parts in there, but has there been any pressure because of business mix there and if you could comment on that side because that's the growing part of it and margins keep seeing pressure there could be some risk there? Martin Schroeter Yes so a couple of things, first on the strategic imperative, the margins, the gross margins in the strategic imperatives, which is a way to try to value how much value add are you adding. The gross margins are actually higher than the rest of the business in total. So the places we're going to remain higher value than the places we're coming from. Now that shouldn’t surprise you in a high value model you would always expect to be moving into these higher value areas. Now those margins and the margins in total have been impacted by a couple of things. You pointed out level of investment that's absolutely correct. We did ramp up our spend rates in order to build some of these businesses and that's certainly in the margin profile that we have put forward in the last year and half or so. At the same time, we're investing not only expense to build these, but quite frankly, we're investing a lot of capital to build these as a service businesses, which means you put all the capital in place now, and you start it fairly low utilization on those assets and then as you add volumes, you build -- you build utilization and you have a better unit cost and we're just now getting to the point where we're seeing enough scale on those platforms to start to grow as a service part of the margins. So when we look at where we were strategic imperative margins already better than the core if you will the rest and that's with the handicap or with the heavy investment levels. So from here, I would say that the model of moving to higher value will still be in those margins, we'll just see better margin performance as we build more scale. Kulbinder Garcha On the heavy investment you referenced that impacts gross margins... Martin Schroeter And because again we're spending -- we're spending in capital, which drives a higher cost base obviously through your depreciation to build that all these cloud data centers and put these as a service properties on a set of assets, but we're also spending heavily in expense in order to drive the development and get these offerings out and to bring those acquisitions and to make sure that spending and the investment on those acquisitions get into the run rate. So both gross and net margins. Kulbinder Garcha Okay. Great. With that, we're out of time. Thank you very much, Martin.

      "text": "A Closer Look at IBM’s Growth-Chasing Strategy PART 2 OF 14 How Will Sanovi Enhance IBM’s Disaster Recovery Strategy? By Anne Shields | Nov 29, 2016 2:07 pm EST IBM is a leader in the DRaaS space \nEarlier, we discussed how Sanovi Technologies could enhance IBM’s position in the hybrid cloud space. Let’s see how Sanovi would complement IBM’s “disaster recovery strategy.” \nWe know that Sanovi Technologies would be integrated into IBM’s Resiliency Services, including DRaaS (disaster recovery as a service) and BaaS (backup-as-a-service). In June 2016, IBM was positioned as a leader in Gartner’s Magic Quadrant for DRaaS for the second straight year. \nGartner expects that from 2016 to 2020, the use of either IaaS (infrastructure-as-a-service) or DRaaS “to support the failover of production applications will grow by more than 200%.” \nThrough its acquisition of Sanovi Technologies, IBM intends to expand its Disaster Recovery Services to its Hybrid Cloud offerings. Martin Jetter, senior vice president of IBM’s Global Technology Services, stated, “As a cloud-native company, Sanovi will strengthen our resiliency portfolio to manage the broad range of applications, data, and IT systems of our clients balancing digital and hybrid cloud transformation with increased regulatory compliance.” Increased data generation is paving the way for disaster and recovery services \nLet’s see why we expect significant growth in the disaster, backup, and recovery space. Salesforce.com ( CRM ) estimates that over 90% of the world’s data have been generated in the last two years. The number of connected devices is projected to reach 75 billion by 2020. \nIf we consider EMC ( EMC ) estimates, by 2020, the digital universe will grow 300 times, from the present 130 exabytes to 40,000 exabytes. With such an explosion in data, the need for a backup and disaster recovery process can’t be ruled out. \nThis explains technology players IBM’s and Microsoft’s ( MSFT ) billion dollar investments and strategic focuses on the machine-learning space. {\"metrics\":[\"Open\"],\"tickers\":[\"CRM\",\"IBM\",\"EMC\",\"MSFT\"],\"ticker_names\":[\"salesforce.com, inc.\",\"International Business Machines Corp.\",\"EMC Corporation\",\"Microsoft Corporation\"]} X",

      "text": "A Closer Look at IBM’s Growth-Chasing Strategy PART 4 OF 14 How Are IBM’s Global Technology Services Performing? By Anne Shields | Nov 29, 2016 2:07 pm EST Strategic Imperatives continued to drive growth in IBM’s GTS segment \nEarlier in the series, we discussed IBM’s ( IBM ) acquisition of Sanovi Technologies, which would enhance IBM’s position in the hybrid cloud space, which is expected to see increasing adoption. IBM will likely integrate Sanovi into its Global Technology Services (or GTS) business. \nLet’s take a look at the company’s Technology Services and Cloud Platforms segment’s performance. This segment encompasses the GTS business and IBM’s cloud infrastructure and platform capabilities. \nIn 3Q16, IBM’s GTS revenue accounted for ~45% of its total revenue. As a result, its performance is crucial to IBM’s overall growth. In 3Q16, this segment rose 2.4% to $8.8 billion, as the above chart shows. In constant currency terms, the segment rose 1.4%. \nThe segment’s Strategic Imperatives business’s revenue rose 42% in constant currency terms. Hybrid cloud services played a prominent role in this revenue rise. IBM’s cloud revenue rose 55% in the segment. Amazon’s focus on hybrid cloud could impact IBM’s dominance \nThough IBM leads in the hybrid cloud space, the recently announced partnership between VMware ( VMW ) and Amazon ( AMZN ) is likely to impact its dominance. Through this partnership, Amazon should gain a foothold in the hybrid cloud space. \nAmazon is the undisputed leader in the cloud space. Amazon’s magnitude can be gauged by the fact that while Microsoft ( MSFT ) and Oracle ( ORCL ) reported 100% and 152% rises, respectively, in the cloud space in 2Q16, they’re still only one-third and one-sixth as large as Amazon in the space. \nAmazon, known for its competitive behavior, has the funds, the scale, and the presence to compete in the hybrid cloud space. In this way, IBM is bound to face pressure on account of Amazon. {\"metrics\":[\"Open\"],\"tickers\":[\"IBM\",\"VMW\",\"AMZN\",\"MSFT\",\"ORCL\"],\"ticker_names\":[\"International Business Machines Corp.\",\"VMware, Inc.\",\"Amazon.com, Inc.\",\"Microsoft Corporation\",\"Oracle Corporation\"]} X",

      "text": "I think that is fine and dandy — the Chief Science Officer of Cognitive Computing for IBM certainly has a right to his opinion re AI, and it carries a lot of weight. But what I believe he fails to realize at all, despite his tenure, is that enemies like ISIS or Al Qaeda, or North Korea or Somalia or Afghanistan or 100 other countries or rebel outfits could use it too, for evil intent, in the next few years. From CRISPR/Cas9 to nanotechnology to AGI, there are a million ways to make it monstrously evil, and a couple of eager beavers to try it out. Or the NSA or CIA will think that they have to do it quickly, before other countries do it first (and believe me, Russia and China are very robust enemies where AI is concerned) and will “cut corners” on the ethical programming — and Lockheed Martin and Raytheon and Halliburton will march to the Pentagon’s wishes.\nIt’s a brave new world indeed, and although AI has the potential for the greatest good, it also has the potential for horrible evil — and with that small of a planet, it only takes a few bad apples to make the human race completely extinct. I’m not kidding. That’s what I’m genuinely scared of — and I don’t think he has that message because he’s so into the challenge and the race to be first. He does not think of the truly big picture, which is terrifying.\nhttps://hbr.org/2016/11/what-it-will-take-for-us-to-trust-ai",
