      "text": "PARA, Brazil , Nov. 28, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- The ancient Kayapo tribe of the Brazilian Amazon have, from today, a crowdfunding campaign run on Gofundme by dedicated supporters who are seeking to raise funds to help the Kayapo protect their culture as well as the Amazon rainforest – which, along with being acknowledged as one of the planet's most vital ecosystems, is also the tribe's land.\nPhoto - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20161125/442977 \nHelp Kayapo While the Kayapo have historically focused on their traditions, way of life and natural balance with the Amazon treasures that surround them, the recent years have brought serious modern challenges that threaten to leave them displaced.\n\"Unfortunately, with the progress that Latin America's largest nation and economic powerhouse has experienced in the last decade, the land of the Kayapo has started to be claimed and disputed by the so-called agents of progress,\" stated Oz Arie, the Pro-Kayapo Crowdfunding Campaign Author.\n\"Loggers, ranchers and miners, as well as developers of planned infrastructure works, brought along deforestation and other threats to the rainforest and to the Kayapo's way of life, which prompted us to come in aid of the Kayapo, and of the Amazon, a natural treasure that we all should commit to respect and protect,\" Arie added.\nThe new threats that the Kayapo face have prompted the tribe to come out of their isolated life and start exposing these problems, using every available instrument to protect both their culture and the Amazon. This has left the tribe in need of raising funds to mark and defend the boundaries of their territory, to improve their agricultural practices, namely with solar power resources, to better feed their people, and to improve the education they offer to their young, so that they can learn and keep the Kayapo traditions alive, while learning how to become their very own lasting advocates under the outside world's rules.\nThis crowdfunding campaign is another initiative launched by Mr. Arie to support the Kayapo. His US-based Temporary Tattoo manufacturing company FreshJagua has been offering independent support to the Kayapo tribes in the last 2 years.\nMr. Arie has personally dedicated himself to the cause of the Kayapo after meeting with Alice Kohler , a Western photographer who had been trying to raise awareness about these issues for some time.\nAfter they both met, Arie subsequently visited the tribe in Brazil , and both philanthropists started an online shop on Etsy to help sell the traditional Kayapo-made bead jewelry, along with the crowdfunding campaign that they are both launching to bring the help that the Kayapo need.\nFor more information, please visit www.helpkayapo.org , www.freshjagua.com and www.alicekohler.org . \nTo support the crowdfunding campaign for the Kayapo people, visit: www.gofundme.com/helpkayapo \nTo purchase authentic beaded jewelry from the Kayapo Tribe in Brazil , visit: www.etsy.com/shop/KayapoArt \nMedia Contact: \nOz Arie\n135091@email4pr.com \n7862811819\n \nTo view the original version on PR Newswire, visit: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/protection-of-the-indigenous-kayapo-people-and-of-the-amazon-turns-to-crowdfunding-for-support-300368680.html \nSOURCE Oz Arie\nRelated Links \nhttp://www.helpkayapo.org",

      "text": " BY) Learn a new language, get a free tablet. Win-win. Rosetta Stone software is $100 off on Amazon today, which is a pretty good Cyber Monday deal. But that wasn't enough, so they're going full Oprah and throwing free tablets at us too. (Not literally—that would hurt.)\nToday only, select Rosetta Stone language sets come bundled with a Fire HD 6 for $149 . You can also purchase the same software set (levels 1-5) without the tablet for roughly the same discounted price ...but why would you when it's FREE? \nThe software set comes with a download activation key, and can be shared with up to five people. If a tablet wasn't incentive enough, you also get free earbuds with built-in mic and a three-month subscription to the Rosetta Stone companion app, which offers live online tutoring sessions with a native speaker. \nIf you're only in this for the free tablet, you may just want to upgrade to the Fire HD 7 , and buy it individually while it's on sale for $33 . But if we're talking value here, learning a new language is probably the best investment.",

      "title": "Amazon Gets Real About Fake Products on Its Marketplace",
      "text": "Amazon Gets Real About Fake Products on Its Marketplace Spencer Soper Nov 28, 2016 8:42 am ET (Bloomberg) -- Randy Hetrick first noticed counterfeits on Amazon.com Inc. in 2013. He had been selling his TRX Training System-- an exercise kit of suspension straps-- on the site since 2008. When he began noticing cheap imitations, he had his employees scour Amazon for more, then go through the tedious process of reporting them for removal. But new imposters would pop up right away, and by 2014, \"We realized this was an epidemic,\" said Hetrick, who estimates phonies cost him $100 million a year, twice his annual sales. Amazon's Marketplace gives inventors like Hetrick exposure to hundreds of millions of shoppers without the big expense of building and promoting a website from scratch. Merchants give Amazon a commission on each sale. But a hot-selling product on Amazon encourages counterfeiters to make flimsy knockoffs with cheap materials, steal sales and damage a brand with few consequences. Amazon has known the problem is getting worse, according to a source familiar with the matter, but for years, the company has been largely silent about the flourishing fakes. That has frustrated manufacturers and brand owners who bear the cost and responsibility of policing the site, reporting problems and hoping Amazon takes action. It's the subject of the latest episode of the Decrypted podcast (subscribe here on iTunes). SoundCloud: The Fake Reviews and Counterfeits That Amazon's Trying to Quash by Bloomberg Now, the world's biggest online retailer is getting serious. It has made fighting phonies a major goal for 2017, building teams in the U.S. and Europe to work with major brands on a registry to prevent fakes, according to a person familiar with the initiative, who was not authorized to speak about the matter and requested anonymity. Discussions with Major League Baseball and the National Football League about selling merchandise on Amazon hit a standstill earlier this year due to concerns about Amazon's lack of control over fakes, the person said. “Amazon has zero tolerance for the sale of counterfeit items on our site,\" Amazon said in a statement. The company said it was \"aggressively pursuing bad actors.\" In a statement, the MLB said: “It is our responsibility to provide our fans with reliable and secure marketplaces to purchase officially licensed merchandise. Given the rampant growth of online-only retailers supplying counterfeit merchandise, our policies must hold every distribution partner to that same level of commitment.” The NFL declined to comment. The new Amazon teams will encourage brands -- even those that don't sell on Amazon -- to register with the online store, the person said. Once registered, Amazon requires any marketplace merchants listing those products to prove that they have the brand's permission to sell them online. Amazon began experimenting with the registry earlier this year with Nike and other companies. The bigger push in 2017 will target thousands of large companies, including those that have been reluctant to sell on Amazon because of knock-offs. In addition, this month Amazon teamed up with Hetrick's business to sue three people, accusing them of selling fakes on its site. It filed another similar suit the same day against an alleged counterfeit ring. Moving the battle to a courtroom is an acknowledgment that despite spending tens of millions of dollars a year and employing an army of software engineers, investigators and research scientists tasked with fighting copycats, Amazon is not winning the war against counterfeiters. \"The depressing thing about it is, brands that invest the most to innovate and create new products are the ones that lose the most because they are the ones the counterfeiters target,\" said Hetrick, who is encouraged by Amazon's new vigilance. \"You end up becoming the sales and marketing arm for these shysters selling illegal goods.\" Amazon is desperately trying to bring order to the Wild West atmosphere on its marketplace, where more than 2 million independent sellers compete for the attention and money of shoppers. About half of the goods purchased on Amazon come from independent merchants, who help Amazon expand its inventory more quickly and with less upfront cost than Amazon could do on its own. It also makes the retailer and its customers more vulnerable to fakes because the simple online registration process currently in place is designed to make it easy for businesses to begin selling immediately. But that also makes it simple for counterfeiters to list fake goods, sell as many as they can before they're detected, and then vanish. Amazon’s suits targeting sellers were the first of their kind for the company, a warning to counterfeiters heading into the busy holiday shopping season when the most is at stake. It could be too little, too late. The shift of spending from stores with tight inventory controls to online marketplaces where it's tough to distinguish between fake and authentic is fueling a rise in counterfeiting that shows no signs of slowing. Alibaba and Ebay are also grappling with copycat products. Counterfeits made up nearly $500 billion, or 2.5 percent, of global imports in 2013, a figure expected to grow as more spending shifts online, according to an April report by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. China is the biggest source of phonies. Despite efforts to decrease them, complaints about imitations on Amazon have been growing along with its inventory since at least 2014, according to a person familiar with the matter. What Amazon has known internally for years is spilling into the public eye. Birkenstock announced it would cease selling products on Amazon in January due to concerns about counterfeits. And in October, Apple Inc. sued an Amazon supplier claiming the business sold fake Apple products -- some of them unsafe -- on Amazon. \"Online counterfeiting is never going to go down,\" said Stuart Fuller, director of commercial operations at NetNames, which helps brands identify marketplaces and websites where counterfeit products are sold. \"Amazon is the most trusted marketplace in the world. That in and of itself attracts this nefarious element because they know shoppers go there and trust what they are buying is genuine.\" Bret Rosenzweig is another inventor who has felt the sting of counterfeits on Amazon. His company, DC Innovations, makes the Urban Shelf, a collapsible plastic nightstand that wedges between a mattress and box spring. Bachelors and college students are the target market, and Amazon was the perfect place to introduce the product to the masses in 2009. Once his sales on Amazon started picking up around 2015, counterfeiters took notice, mimicked the design with cheaper materials and offered it for less. That's a double-blow to Rosenzweig, who loses a sale and now has a potential customer unimpressed with his brand (or what the customer thinks is his brand). Rosenzweig checks Amazon each day, scouring the marketplace for counterfeiters selling his product. The process of reporting the fakes to Amazon has been a time-suck. He spots a knock-off, buys the item and when he receives it, he takes photos and submits a report to Amazon. The company is usually quick about suspending the counterfeiters, but new accounts quickly spring up in their place and the game of whack-a-mole continues, Rosenzweig said. He can no longer order phony items to his home address because his adversaries know he is conducting a test purchase, so he has his business partner order them. Rosenzweig said he’d welcome any new effort from Amazon to crack down. \"Buying the fakes and reporting them is a waste of my time,\" he said. Amazon, EBay and Alibaba are largely shielded from legal liability as long as they have processes in place for brands to report fake goods and take timely action to suspend their sale once notified. The online marketplaces often don’t have the inventory, so there is nothing to seize. The result is an endless loop with brands buying and reporting fakes, marketplaces suspending accounts, and the fraudsters creating new accounts to hawk the same fake goods under new pseudonyms. EBay lets registered brand owners report suspected counterfeit listings for removal, as does Alibaba. But the retailers can only do so much. Shoppers worried about buying fakes during the holidays have to bear some responsibility, said Akino Chikada, senior brand protection manager at the firm MarkMonitor, which helps brands find online sources of counterfeits. She suggests looking closely at web addresses for subtle variations from brand names and probing websites for sloppy privacy and return policies, which can signal a phony. Bargain basement prices are another tell-tale sign, though sophisticated counterfeiters try to make the price difference less suspicious by coming in at 10 or 20 percent below other offers rather than half price, she said. \"Counterfeiters do a good job mimicking the look and feel of a brand,\" she said. \"It's so easy for people, in just a few clicks, to unknowingly buy counterfeit goods.\" Want more stories like this every week?

Both sale prices match what the company offered as part of its Black Friday sales.\nCyber Monday is a big sales day for Amazon. Last year, shoppers ordered more than 54 million items — 629 per second — on the Monday after Thanksgiving.\nAmazon Prime members, who pay $99 a year, will get early access to Lightning Deals. There will also be specific deals for shoppers using Alexa, the voice assistant in Echo.\nHere’s a look on what will be on sale Monday:\n50-inch 1080p LED TV for $145 50-inch 4K Ultra HD Smart TV for $249.99 Amazon Voyage for $169.99 Amazon Fire TV for $74.99 Sonos PLAY: 1 compact wireless speaker for $149 Nest Cam indoor security camera for $163.98 Up to 50% off select Nerf, Playskool and Play-Doh toys Blendtec Total blender for $239.99 Up to 50% off select Callaway Golf sets ",

Subscribe The Next Great American Metropolis Is Taking Shape In Texas (Photo credit: STR/AFP/Getty Images) \nArguably, the most important e-commerce battle in the world right now is not between Amazon and Walmart or Amazon and the new wave of omnichannel players like Warby Parker and Dollar Shave Club. Rather, it’s the Cold War between Alibaba and Amazon. It’s a battle that will likely span decades, and in the next few years, be most pronounced in Southeast Asia. \nThe players \nIn India, we all know the story too well. Flipkart and Snapdeal are faced with the rich American competitor, which is set to pump $3 billion into the country. In Indonesia, rumor is that Amazon will likewise pump $600 million into the country. In a sandwich motion, Amazon is attempting to conquer India in the west and Indonesia in the East. And with a potential new center point in Singapore , Amazon is picking its battles in the region carefully. \nIn the meantime, Alibaba has wasted no time, shelling out $1 billion to acquire the heavy spending e-commerce player, Rocket Internet’s Lazada. And via its financial arm, Ant Financial (with over $4.5 billion in the bank), Alibaba extends its interests into investments in finance in the Southeast Asian region. \nWith the large Chinese and American juggernauts entering Southeast Asia from all sides, is this a good thing? \nSoutheast Asia’s incumbents \nNo doubt, from the consumer perspective, the companies will burn as much as they can for marketshare. It’s good for consumers. That’s obvious. But what will it do for their competitors? The retailers and existing e-commerce sites in Southeast Asia? ",

      "title": "UPDATE: My kid's man-size feet are costing me a fortune",
      "text": "By Rachel Koning Beals\nZappos and Amazon offer choice, but that doesn't automatically make it easier -- or cheaper\nMy son is 9 years old, not extraordinarily tall, but wears a size-7 men's shoe.\nOr is that a kids' size 7?\nIt depends. Sizing categorization varies by brand, but size 7 can be slim pickings in the mens' or kids' departments in brick-and-mortar stores with limited inventory space. The online options are seemingly endless -- seemingly. Selection is much more select for boys in the big-pawed tween stage than for girls/women. And ordering mistakes require package returns. That's no fun for this procrastinator, even if retailers have made that increasingly smoother--shoe mega-mart Zappos and its parent Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN), have free return.\nOur household has been grumbling about its barge-foot burden for some time, but it was the hunt for dressier wedding shoes for that son -- and his 11-year-old brother whose toes look like fingers but who is at least in a men's size 8 with slightly better inventory -- that about did us in.\nThe issue is compounded by the fact that my kids have narrow heels (big feet are my gift; my husband bequeathed them the fade-away heel). That means it's key to have a sales person with any expertise on brand-specific fitting help us. And when the boys can test-drive in the store, even better.\nThe National Shoe Retailers Association, in a 2012 study, said that the most popular shoe sizes have increased over the last 30 years, from size 7 1/2 to 8 1/2 for women, and from size 9 1/2 to 10 1/2 for men.\n(http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/features/why-our-feet-are-getting-bigger-9481529.html)\nKids are growing faster, too. Their diets have evolved -- meaning that for better or worse, they're eating more and getting bigger, and that includes their base. In 1961, the average Western 11-year-old boy had size-3 1/2-to-4 feet and the average 11-year-old girl had size-3 feet. Now the average 11-year-old boy has size-4 1/2-to-5 feet (we smashed that average) and the average 11-year-old girl has size-4 feet, according to a British podiatry association. Some industry specialists also wonder if modern society's insistence in wearing casual, less-supportive shoes has pushed many of us into bigger sizes, which only reinforces the importance of finding the right shoe for growing kids.\nBut when boys do hit the men's department with no looking back, the styles start to look, well, noticeably less juvenile, especially in dressier options. What grade-schooler wants to slip out his sneakers and right into wingtips? Hiking boots were our wedding-shoe solution, declared \"dressy enough\" because I wouldn't let my sons scuff them up before the event and because we were toasting the new couple lake-side anyway.\nRead:What not to buy at Target and Walmart (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/what-not-to-buy-at-target-and-walmart-2014-11-19)\nWith those hiking boots came a man-sized price hike. A well-made boot is probably worth every buck of its typically $200-and-up starting cost. We snared ours on the L.L. Bean clearance rack for about $150, the most money I've spent to date on kids' shoes and I instantly wondered if they'd last growing boys a full season. Adults have a savings trick when shoe and apparel shopping -- buy classics off-season.Not so easy when kid sizes are a moving target.\nI wondered if I was just lacking resourcefulness? Likely, yes. But the challenge is real, confirmed my six-foot-tall friend, Mary, who with her six-foot-six husband made a smart and funny giant-footed boy who hit men's size 9 at age 10.\n\"A decent pair of athletic shoes with the support he needs is well over $100, so we are aggressive in the sale shopping,\" says Mary, who frequently uses Amazon. \"He has a pair of size 10s ready to go in his closet as they were end-of-season and between 60-70% off.\"\n\"And, yes, dress shoes are a living hell,\" she agrees. \"The last pair I got my son was from the Target (TGT) men's department for about $25: a decent, lace-up oxford. I am not investing in a good dress shoe until he becomes the ultimate preppy and wants penny loafers daily [like his mom], which I don't think will ever happen, or he stops growing, and I don't think this will ever happen either.\"\nAlesha Giles, with 12 years of youth-department buying experience at Zappos, Nordstrom Inc. (JWN) and Macy's Inc. (M) , said the youth-to-adult price hike depends on brand. The Converse \"Chuck Taylor\" black classic goes up $15 when pushing into adult sizes. Kids' Uggs running $99 to $139 go up to $154.95 for a similar style in the adult category.\nOpinion:Is buying a pair of Ivanka Trump shoes a political endorsement? (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/how-i-felt-about-buying-ivanka-trump-shoes-2016-10-31)\nGiles noted that Zappos is showing 907 options in size 7. They're there, I looked. That's an impressive number, but there is a noticeable dropoff of listings once you scroll down to \"big kid\" (http://www.zappos.com/boys-shoes8G?pf_rd_r=1SJB7BFJM2CYJ9KFW05B&pf_rd_p=468928c6-378a-42e5-81b1-dd7abc9761be). Lots of casual options. Dressy styles? Eh. Giles said that some brands on Zappos, especially European makers, are starting to carry so-called big kids' styles, in loafers, oxfords and other basics, up to U.S. size 8-9.\nBrands are also trying to be more trend-conscious by including what Giles called \"adult take-down,\" especially in dressy-casual. That means there's an adult-sized counterpart to select trending styles, including for Florsheim, Skechers, Sam Edelman (for girls) and the Vans Chukka.\nIn fact, the same dilemma that leaves me with a couple of Shoeless Joes in Chicago has long been a loophole for adults. Smaller-footed men and women could go for the lower price in similar or same styles by opting for big-kid sizing over small-adult sizing, especially in casual shoes like sneakers and sandals. You might think that walking around on a set of very small feet is a blessing then? Think again. Brands have caught on, says Giles, making consumers pay adult-size prices in that tricky crossover size range.\nFor my kids and Mary's son, the fact that they don't care so much about style is a blessing (moms and dads just pick) and a curse (give me at least a little clue, will you?). Says Mary: \"We usually give him a few to choose from online. He is pretty easy, as he does not care about the brand name--yet. One of his best buds is a label-whore already.\"\nAnd with that a bump up in our First-World grumbling. Adult-size.\nDon't miss:Is it better to buy stuff or experiences? Lin-Manuel Miranda and my Vitamix blender have the answer (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/hamilton-duels-with-my-vitamix-blender-to-settle-the-stuff-vs-experience-debate-2016-10-07)\n-Rachel Koning Beals; 0815ET\n ",

      "text": "November 28, 2016 Photo by aodaodaodaod / Shutterstock.com \nAmazon introduced tens of thousands of sales on Cyber Monday — but you don’t have to shop today to save. \nThe online retail giant unveiled its Cyber Monday deals early this morning. The total number of bargains tops 75,000, according to CNN Money . \nAmazon warns that many of its specials are in limited supply, and are likely to disappear quickly. However, if you miss one deal, another is likely to appear soon. According to the retailer: \nDon’t worry if you miss one, because we’ll keep adding new ones as often as every five minutes throughout the day and all week long. \nEarly on Monday, Amazon was offering deals such as: $50 off on a Fitbit Tracker 25 percent off on cellphone cases and accessories 33 percent off a Fire tablet 60 percent off a KitchenAid KL26M1XER Professional 6-Qt. Bowl-Lift Stand Mixer \nFor more holiday shopping tips and deals, check out:",

      "text": "Two of the biggest retailers in the world, Wal-Mart (NYSE: WMT) and Amazon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN) , have long been engaged in a sort of David vs. Goliath battle. At one point, Wal-Mart was the Goliath as it reigned over the American retail landscape with thousands of supercenters, offering rock-bottom prices and crushing the traditional mom-and-pop businesses in towns across the country.\nOver the last few years, however, those roles seem to have changed. Wal-Mart's growth has ground to a virtual halt -- last year marked the first time in generations that its revenue declined -- while Amazon is on track to top $130 billion in revenue this year, making it the biggest American retailer after Wal-Mart. \nThough Wal-Mart is still much larger based on sales and profits, Amazon's market value is nearly double that of its brick-and-mortar rival, as it's growing much faster. For investors, there's been no question as to which has been the better stock, as Amazon has delivered blockbuster returns for long-term investors.\nContinue reading ",

      "text": "November 28, 2016 at 09:49 AM EST Amazon Is Cracking Down On Fake Items This Holiday Season \nAmazon.com, Inc. ( NASDAQ:AMZN ) is taking big steps to fight counterfeit goods sold on its platform, as the influx of fake merchandise floods in from all corners of the globe. \nThe problem isn’t new, of course, but the issue is accelerating as more and more retailers sign up to sell their wares on Amazon’s ultra popular eCommerce platform. From Bloomberg : \nAmazon has known the problem is getting worse, according to a source familiar with the matter, but for years, the company has been largely silent about the flourishing fakes. That has frustrated manufacturers and brand owners who bear the cost and responsibility of policing the site, reporting problems and hoping Amazon takes action. \nThe company is finally taking the issue seriously, dedicating time and resources to fight fake goods, which include items ranging non-licensed sports team merchandise to designer handbags and everything in between: \nNow, the world’s biggest online retailer is getting serious. It has made fighting phonies a major goal for 2017, building teams in the U.S. and Europe to work with major brands on a registry to prevent fakes, according to a person familiar with the initiative, who was not authorized to speak about the matter and requested anonymity. Discussions with Major League Baseball and the National Football League about selling merchandise on Amazon hit a standstill earlier this year due to concerns about Amazon’s lack of control over fakes, the person said. \nExperts in the space urge consumers to use caution this holiday season when shopping online. Some tips for avoiding counterfeit goods include only shopping on reputable websites, and by avoiding deals that appear too good to be true. \nAmazon shares fell $12.52 (-1.60%) to $767.85 in Monday morning trading. Year-to-date, AMZN has gained 14.22%. You are viewing an abbreviated republication of ETF Daily News content. You can find full ETF Daily News articles on (www.etfdailynews.com) Related Stocks:",

      "text": "Here are some of the stocks the Yahoo Finance team will be tracking for you today.\nAmazon ( AMZN ) and other retailers are on investors’ watch list this Cyber Monday. The e-commerce giant says it’s offering 75,000 deals this week. Last year, Amazon customers bought 54 million items on Cyber Monday—a record-breaking 629 items per second. Amazon expects to top that record this year. Meanwhile, the Wall Street Journal reports that Amazon is preparing for the flood of holiday orders by using technology to reduce the time it takes to train new workers. The paper says Amazon is using touch screens, scanners and robots to get warehouse workers up to speed in as little as two days.\nPanera Bread ( PNRA ) is under pressure in early trading. Wedbush downgraded the stock this morning to neutral from outperform citing valuation. The firm points out that Panera’s shares are trading at a 20% premium to its peers, but it maintained it price target of $220 a share.\nSchlumberger ( SLB ) is grabbing headlines. The Wall Street Journal reports that the oil driller signed a preliminary deal to study an Iranian oil field. The contract would be one of the most prominent signed since Donald Trump won the presidential election. Trump has vowed to undo a nuclear pact that was signed last year with Tehran.\nInvestors are keeping close tabs on Baker Hughes ( BHI ) after Barron’s reported over the weekend that shares of the oilfield services company could rise significantly if the merger with General Electric’s oil and gas division is completed—even if we don’t see a big jump in oil prices. Investment firm Evercore believes Baker Hughes shares could rise more than 10% from their closing price on Friday to $69 a share.",

      "text": "Patrick Fallon | Bloomberg | Getty Images Jeff Bezos, chief executive officer of Amazon.com Inc. Amazon 's prices are often great. But they are not always the best.\nThat's a worthwhile reminder this time of year considering tens of millions of you are Amazon Prime members, which makes you less likely to compare prices before buying on Amazon.\nBut you should. Case in point: leading up to the holiday season, Google 's price comparison site showed better prices than Amazon on nearly 60 percent of Amazon best sellers, according to the pricing firm 360pi.\nMore from Recode:\nThe tech industry is reshaping philanthropy, one big bet at a time\nHackers took down the computer system for San Francisco's Muni metro line\nBlack Friday set a record as the first $1 billion mobile shopping day in U.S. history\nIn the lead-up to the holiday rush, some other online retailers showed signs they were going to be much more aggressive this year in matching or beating Amazon on prices. Walmart, as an example, was beating Amazon on 20 percent of top-selling toys that both retailers were selling. Walmart also matched Amazon's price on another 35 percent of these goods.\nOver at Jet.com, now owned by Walmart , you could find better prices on 46 percent of top-selling toys that both sites carried.\nAmazon is often still the best option, either because its price is the lowest or customers value its unbeatable selection and steady reliability this time of year over anything else. But spending a few minutes checking prices elsewhere can sometimes save you money.\n— By Jason Del Rey, Recode.net .\nCNBC's parent NBCUniversal is an investor in Recode's parent Vox, and the companies have a content-sharing arrangement.",

      "text": "(Image credit: Amazon ) \nDid you miss out on all the Black Friday deals this past weekend? No worries — you have one more opportunity with Cyber Monday. I've scanned the internet for the best deals of the day, and found the one thing you should probably spend your money on. Just like with the best deal for Black Friday , you don't even need to leave your couch for this purchase. \nIf you've been thinking about getting a KitchenAid stand mixer, for yourself or as a gift for your favorite cook, today is the day. For Cyber Monday, Amazon has put the bowl-lift KitchenAid stand mixer in Empire Red on sale for $220. Usually it retails for $550, so that's 60 percent off. That's a massive discount considering this iconic kitchen tool basically sells itself. Read More About the KitchenAid Stand Mixer",

      "text": "Big department stores with healthy online operations and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) led the way on Black Friday in part by getting a head start by kicking the shopping festivities off on Thanksgiving.\nDigital Black Friday sales started at most major retailers when the calendar turned from Wednesday to Thursday. That was enough to keep some shoppers at home -- still buying stuff, but not venturing out to stores on either Thursday or Friday.\nOnline sales were the big winner of the two-day period coming in at $5.27 billion, according to Adobe (NASDAQ: ADBE) Digital Insights . That's a 17.7% year-over-year increase, with Black Friday itself setting a new record by surpassing $3 billion for the first time at $3.34 billion, a 21.6% increase over 2015. Thanksgiving itself came in at $1.93 billion.\nContinue reading ",

      "text": "{ 0 comments } \nYou’re back to work this morning still feeling groggy and stuffed from eating too much turkey and pumpkin pie the past few days. It’s time to start working out… your index finger! It’s Cyber Monday and you’re going to be doing a lot of mousing and clicking today to find the best deals. My first go-to shopping destination is almost always Amazon because I’m a Prime member which means I get things cheap, fast and with no hassles. Click through to see some of Amazons best Cyber Monday deals that include the Amazon Echo, Echo Dot, phones and more. \nDevice Deals—Deals end at 11:59 pm PST TONIGHT",

      "text": "The Insider Picks team writes about stuff we think you'll like. Business Insider has affiliate partnerships, so we may get a share of the revenue from your purchase.\nAmazon.com's logo is seen at Amazon Japan's office building in Tokyo Thomson Reuters\nSince 2009, Amazon has sold a variety of products through its own brand, called AmazonBasics.\nTheir generic brand covers everything from tech to fitness or even dining supplies. The goal is to give you the most bang for your buck, and while their products might not be as flashy as their competitors', they get the job done.\nThey're also significantly cheaper, and if you can get a solid product in a major category for less, it's definitely worth it.\nI've used some AmazonBasics products before, and in some cases, check if they have something before looking at the rest of the market.\nSo I've sorted through the handful of AmazonBasics gadgets you can feel comfortable buying for less. None of them will ever be flashy, but, like an imitative box of cereal, they’ll get the job done. You might save some cash along the way, too.\nView As: One Page Slides Bluetooth speakers Amazon While it hasn’t made our list of the best budget Bluetooth speakers , the AmazonBasics Portable Bluetooth Speaker is a more exciting value than its bland name suggests. It’s no UE Roll in the design department, but it’s not ugly, and while it doesn’t have the fullest sound around, its bright, mostly clean profile is decidedly solid for a $40 speaker.\nAlso, it’s $40. That’s very affordable for something this respectable. For only a little more you can get Anker's SoundCore Sport XL, which is the best portable bluetooth speaker we've tested recently. But if budget is your main concern, Amazon's speaker will be just fine.\nAmazonBasics Portable Bluetooth Speaker, $35.99\nCables Amazon It’s never a bad idea to stock up on spare cables — they have a habit of being misplaced, you see — and much of AmazonBasics’ selection are among the better deals around.\nIts sturdy HDMI cables are particularly affordable, as you can grab, among other things, a pair of 10-footers for $6.49 . You shouldn’t pay more than a few bucks for these as a rule — just be sure to check out similar offers from other trustworthy cheap cable sellers like Monoprice to ensure you get the best deal for you at a given time.\nIt’s the same idea with microUSB and Lightning cables. We’ve extolled the virtues of having a lengthier charging cable before, and there’s virtually no reason to splurge $20 or $30 on \"name brand\" options from Apple and the like.\nThere are differences in speed and durability among cheap cables, but generally speaking, Amazon’s USB 3.0 to microUSB Cable and (MFi-certified) Lightning to USB Cable are reliable. They might not be the fastest or tightest — we like Anker’s selection , too — but they’re backed by great user reviews, and again, they’re super affordable. If you ever see them marked down, they’re worth jumping on.\nAmazonBasics HDMI Cable 2-Pack (9.8 Feet), $6.49\nAmazonBasics USB 3.0 to microUSB Cable (6 Feet), $5.99\nAmazonBasics Apple Certified Lightning to USB Cable (6 Feet), $7.99\nPortable batteries Amazon Seeing your phone’s battery icon flash red when you know you won’t be home for another few hours is a strange kind of anxiety, but one you can avoid entirely by investing in a portable battery. Thankfully, as is the recurring theme here, you don’t need to pay a ton to get a dependable one.\nWe’ve previously commended smaller packs from RavPower and larger ones from Anker and Monoprice , but you can toss the AmazonBasics Portable Power Bank right alongside them. Again, we can’t say it’s the absolute fastest around, but any differences won’t be significant to most people, and the whole thing is well-made. It’s about as affordable as our other recommendations, too.\nReally it comes down to how you want your battery to look. If you think a flatter, more phone-shaped pack would play nicer with your pockets, by all means, give this a go. We’ve linked to the 16,500mAh model below, which we find to be the best deal of the bunch, but there are other, more compact options.\nAmazonBasics Portable Power Bank (16,500mAh), $29.99\nComputer speakers Amazon They're not going to be as powerful or clear as a high-end pair of computer speakers from AudioEngine, or even Logitech. But, if you want better-than-laptop-speaker audio quality, either of these speakers will do that.\nAmazon's speakers come in two flavors: powered or USB, and there are a couple of differences between the two to keep in mind. The powered speakers are a little more powerful at 5 watts versus 3 watts on the USB model. Another advantage of the powered speakers is that they have a built-in headphone jack, so you can plug your headphones into them instead of your computer. That's actually a pretty nice feature if you keep your computer docked all the time.\nAgain, these aren't for the audiophiles, but if you're in need of a cheap pair of computer speakers, either of these pairs will fit the bill.\nAmazonBasics USB Powered Computer Spea kers , $13.99\nAmazonBasics AC Powered Computer Speakers , $19. 99\nOn-ear headphones Amazon There are a handful of nondescript headphones sold under the AmazonBasics brand, but the only pair you should consider picking up is its Lightweight On-Ear Headphone . Another boring name, yes, but it has a surprisingly competent, bass-heavy sound that really has no business being on a $15 headphone.\nNow, it certainly looks that cheap; with its dull all-black all-plastic frame, it’s not the kind of thing you’d get as a gift. Still, it’s not uncomfortable either. It’s reminiscent of a similar on-ear pair from Monoprice , which sounds more accurate and spacious but is also out of stock as of this writing. For a beater pair you can bring on the run, or a backup you can hang onto when your main headphones go out of whack, this is a good choice.\nAmazonBasics Lightweight On-Ear Headphones, $14.99\nLaptop cases and sleeves Amazon If you carry around your laptop around and don't feel like sticking it in a backpack , Amazon's laptop bag is a pretty good option. It has multiple pockets, so it can hold your laptop, tablet, and all your accessories without getting too bloated. I'd never buy a bag like this that didn't have multiple pockets, it's too convenient once you've owned one.\nIf you'd like to keep your laptop protected, even while it's in the bag, Amazon also sells laptop sleeves. I've used them before; they fit around my laptop pretty well and have a surprisingly thick layer of protection without being overly bulky. They're not as slim as a hard case, but they're certainly better than leaving your laptop as-is.\nAmazonBasics 15.6-Inch Laptop and Tablet Bag , $23.98\nAmazonBasics 15-Inch to 15.6-Inch Laptop Sleeve , $11.49\nRechargeable batteries Amazon Not much explanation needed here. We’ve noted before how a robust pack of rechargeable batteries is one of the few pieces of tech that can pay for itself over time — with its 4.5 rating after 2,500-plus user reviews, the AmazonBasics set qualifies as that, and it’s a better value per battery than similar packs like the Panasonic Eneloop .\nIf you're not into rechargeable batteries, but still want a good deal, Amazon still has you covered, though. For a bargain-basement price, Amazon has standard AA and AAA batteries, which have also gotten thousands of positive reviews\nAmazonBasics AA Rechargeable Batteries (8-Pack, Pre-Charged), $14.99\nAmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48-Pack), $11.87\nAmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36-Pack), $7.74\nKeyboards and mice Amazon We’d still recommend the Logitech K380 or Anker Ultra Slim Bluetooth to most people looking for a new Bluetooth keyboard, but if you aren’t going to use it a ton and just want to save a few bucks, the AmazonBasics Bluetooth Keyboard is a decent, no-frills alternative.\nIt’s sturdily built (if a bit drab), well-sized and comfortable enough , and, per usual, inexpensive. It’s entirely competent. It weirdly lacks a rechargeable battery, but it at least comes with a pair of pre-charged AAAs, and both user and professional reviews suggest it can get months out of them.\nIf you need just any mouse to pair with it, the AmazonBasics Wireless Mouse can work too. It’s the epitome of basic, but it’s functional, smooth, and not creaky. Ultimately, there aren’t bad products in tech so much as there are bad prices and misplaced expectations; for $12, this does what it has to.\nAmazonBasics Bluetooth Keyboard for Apple Devices, $19.99\nAmazonBasics Wireless Mouse with Nano Receiver, $8.99\nLaptop and monitor stands Amazon My apartment (and life for that matter...) is full of little gadgets, but I'm actually kind of an organization freak. One of the ways I keep my desk at home clean is by using a laptop stand. Mine holds my laptop vertically, but there are benefits to the horizontal-style stand here. The biggest is that you can keep your laptop's display open and have a dual-monitor setup, which, if you're a multi-tasker, is a game changer.\nAt work I use a stack of books to keep my monitor propped up, but I may end up investing in one of these monitor stands. Besides being way more stable than a handful of paperbacks, Amazon's stand is hollow, so I can store things underneath it.\nAmazonBasics Laptop Stand, $14. 99\nAmazonBasics Metal Monitor Stand , $14.99\nCar mounts Amazon If you rely on Google Maps as much as I do, keeping your phone in a cupholder is not an option. I did that for years, but after buying a car mount, I never looked back. Now, I can casually glance at the directions to confirm something, instead of devoting an unsafe amount of attention to my phone.\nI've reviewed a car mount before, and we've recommended the one that Uber drivers use in their cars, but there isn't a huge difference between most models. The only choice you have to make is whether you'd like one that attaches to your car through a suction cup or one clips onto your car vent.

He says retail winners included Amazon ( AMZN ) , Walmart ( WMT ) and Best Buy ( BBY ) . According to Adobe, online sales topped $3 billion for the first time ever on Black Friday. O'Shea said some retailers were offering doorbuster sales online, rather than just in stores. Based on early indications, O'Shea said it looks like holiday sales this year will be stronger than last year.",

      "title": "UPDATE: My kid's man-size feet are costing me a fortune",
      "text": "By Rachel Koning Beals\nZappos and Amazon offer choice, but that doesn't automatically make it easier -- or cheaper\nMy son is 9 years old, not extraordinarily tall, but wears a size-7 men's shoe.\nOr is that a kids' size 7?\nIt depends. Sizing categorization varies by brand, but size 7 can be slim pickings in the mens' or kids' departments in brick-and-mortar stores with limited inventory space. The online options are seemingly endless -- seemingly. Selection is much more select for boys in the big-pawed tween stage than for girls/women. And ordering mistakes require package returns. That's no fun for this procrastinator, even if retailers have made that increasingly smoother--shoe mega-mart Zappos and its parent Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN), have free return.\nOur household has been grumbling about its barge-foot burden for some time, but it was the hunt for dressier wedding shoes for that son -- and his 11-year-old brother whose toes look like fingers but who is at least in a men's size 8 with slightly better inventory -- that about did us in.\nThe issue is compounded by the fact that my kids have narrow heels (big feet are my gift; my husband bequeathed them the fade-away heel). That means it's key to have a sales person with any expertise on brand-specific fitting help us. And when the boys can test-drive in the store, even better.\nThe National Shoe Retailers Association, in a 2012 study, said that the most popular shoe sizes have increased over the last 30 years, from size 7 1/2 to 8 1/2 for women, and from size 9 1/2 to 10 1/2 for men.\n(http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/features/why-our-feet-are-getting-bigger-9481529.html)\nKids are growing faster, too. Their diets have evolved -- meaning that for better or worse, they're eating more and getting bigger, and that includes their base. In 1961, the average Western 11-year-old boy had size-3 1/2-to-4 feet and the average 11-year-old girl had size-3 feet. Now the average 11-year-old boy has size-4 1/2-to-5 feet (we smashed that average) and the average 11-year-old girl has size-4 feet, according to a British podiatry association. Some industry specialists also wonder if modern society's insistence in wearing casual, less-supportive shoes has pushed many of us into bigger sizes, which only reinforces the importance of finding the right shoe for growing kids.\nBut when boys do hit the men's department with no looking back, the styles start to look, well, noticeably less juvenile, especially in dressier options. What grade-schooler wants to slip out his sneakers and right into wingtips? Hiking boots were our wedding-shoe solution, declared \"dressy enough\" because I wouldn't let my sons scuff them up before the event and because we were toasting the new couple lake-side anyway.\nRead:What not to buy at Target and Walmart (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/what-not-to-buy-at-target-and-walmart-2014-11-19)\nWith those hiking boots came a man-sized price hike. A well-made boot is probably worth every buck of its typically $200-and-up starting cost. We snared ours on the L.L. Bean clearance rack for about $150, the most money I've spent to date on kids' shoes and I instantly wondered if they'd last growing boys a full season. Adults have a savings trick when shoe and apparel shopping -- buy classics off-season.Not so easy when kid sizes are a moving target.\nI wondered if I was just lacking resourcefulness? Likely, yes. But the challenge is real, confirmed my six-foot-tall friend, Mary, who with her six-foot-six husband made a smart and funny giant-footed boy who hit men's size 9 at age 10.\n\"A decent pair of athletic shoes with the support he needs is well over $100, so we are aggressive in the sale shopping,\" says Mary, who frequently uses Amazon. \"He has a pair of size 10s ready to go in his closet as they were end-of-season and between 60-70% off.\"\n\"And, yes, dress shoes are a living hell,\" she agrees. \"The last pair I got my son was from the Target (TGT) men's department for about $25: a decent, lace-up oxford. I am not investing in a good dress shoe until he becomes the ultimate preppy and wants penny loafers daily [like his mom], which I don't think will ever happen, or he stops growing, and I don't think this will ever happen either.\"\nAlesha Giles, with 12 years of youth-department buying experience at Zappos, Nordstrom Inc. (JWN) and Macy's Inc. (M) , said the youth-to-adult price hike depends on brand. The Converse \"Chuck Taylor\" black classic goes up $15 when pushing into adult sizes. Kids' Uggs running $99 to $139 go up to $154.95 for a similar style in the adult category.\nOpinion:Is buying a pair of Ivanka Trump shoes a political endorsement? (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/how-i-felt-about-buying-ivanka-trump-shoes-2016-10-31)\nGiles noted that Zappos is showing 907 options in size 7. They're there, I looked. That's an impressive number, but there is a noticeable dropoff of listings once you scroll down to \"big kid\" (http://www.zappos.com/boys-shoes8G?pf_rd_r=1SJB7BFJM2CYJ9KFW05B&pf_rd_p=468928c6-378a-42e5-81b1-dd7abc9761be). Lots of casual options. Dressy styles? Eh. Giles said that some brands on Zappos, especially European makers, are starting to carry so-called big kids' styles, in loafers, oxfords and other basics, up to U.S. size 8-9.\nBrands are also trying to be more trend-conscious by including what Giles called \"adult take-down,\" especially in dressy-casual. That means there's an adult-sized counterpart to select trending styles, including for Florsheim, Skechers, Sam Edelman (for girls) and the Vans Chukka.\nIn fact, the same dilemma that leaves me with a couple of Shoeless Joes in Chicago has long been a loophole for adults. Smaller-footed men and women could go for the lower price in similar or same styles by opting for big-kid sizing over small-adult sizing, especially in casual shoes like sneakers and sandals. You might think that walking around on a set of very small feet is a blessing then? Think again. Brands have caught on, says Giles, making consumers pay adult-size prices in that tricky crossover size range.\nFor my kids and Mary's son, the fact that they don't care so much about style is a blessing (moms and dads just pick) and a curse (give me at least a little clue, will you?). Says Mary: \"We usually give him a few to choose from online. He is pretty easy, as he does not care about the brand name--yet. One of his best buds is a label-whore already.\"\nAnd with that a bump up in our First-World grumbling. Adult-size.\nDon't miss:Is it better to buy stuff or experiences? Lin-Manuel Miranda and my Vitamix blender have the answer (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/hamilton-duels-with-my-vitamix-blender-to-settle-the-stuff-vs-experience-debate-2016-10-07)\n-Rachel Koning Beals;\n 1009ET\n ",

      "text": "Amazon.com Inc.’s first cloud-computing conference in 2011 was a curiosity. Many of its 6,000 attendees worked for startups that had chosen to buy access to processing power and data storage via the web from Amazon Web Services rather than own and maintain their own data centers.\nWith the fifth Amazon Web Services re:Invent conference set to start Tuesday in Las Vegas, the cloud-computing revolution that AWS largely pioneered has upended the world of corporate information technology, displacing on-site servers, storage, networking and software with more economical web-based alternatives. The company expects more than 32,000 people to attend the conference, said AWS Chief Executive Andy Jassy.\nWhile sales growth slows or even reverses at traditional hardware and software giants, sales of Amazon’s AMZN, -1.71% subscription-based, on-demand services ballooned 55% in the third quarter to $3.2 billion. The quarter’s rise was fueled not only by startups but also by big companies including Unilever PLC ULVR, -0.74% , Merck & Co. MRK, -0.62% , Coca-Cola Co. KO, -0.39% and Capital One Financial Corp. COF, -1.44% , according to Amazon.\nLarge companies need a wider array of services than AWS’s core computing and storage offerings. For them, Amazon has, in industry parlance, moved “up the stack,” building layers of software on top of its basic platform, from programming commands that help companies build customized services to full-fledged applications. The company has added databases that can handle many different types of data and programming tools that automate allocation of computing resources.\nAn expanded version of this story appears on WSJ.com\nPopular on WSJ:\nTug of war delays some of Donald Trump’s key hires\nRussian campaign in Syria exposes Moscow’s defense gaps\nMore from MarketWatch How Election 2016 Changed the Political Parties Why the rally by U.S. stocks is ‘just getting started’ — in one chart Stock market pulls back after record-breaking run",

      "text": "(Image credit: Amazon ) \nDid you miss out on all the Black Friday deals this past weekend? No worries — you have one more opportunity with Cyber Monday. I've scanned the internet for the best deals of the day, and found the one thing you should probably spend your money on. Just like with the best deal for Black Friday , you don't even need to leave your couch for this purchase. \nIf you've been thinking about getting a KitchenAid stand mixer, for yourself or as a gift for your favorite cook, today is the day. For Cyber Monday, Amazon has put the bowl-lift KitchenAid stand mixer in Empire Red on sale for $220. Usually it retails for $550, so that's 60 percent off. That's a massive discount considering this iconic kitchen tool basically sells itself. Read More About the KitchenAid Stand Mixer",

      "text": "Waze, the popular navigation app owned by Google, just gained a triumvirate of new celebrity voices as former Top Gear presenters Jeremy Clarkson, James May, and Richard Hammond are now available as voice-navigation options in the Waze app on Android and iOS.\nAbove: The Grand Tour: Waze\nThe move is to promote the trio’s new show, The Grand Tour, which is among Amazon’s biggest ever original content investments at around $250 million . The internet giant has been going all-out to promote the show and encourage the public to sign up to an Amazon Prime account, the only way you can currently watch the series.\nFounded out of Israel in 2007, Waze built a solid reputation for its community and suite of mobile apps that let anyone share real-time data on traffic and road conditions. It was the popularity of the apps, and the data they generated, that led to its $1 billion acquisition by Google back in 2013.\nWaze is no stranger to such tie-ups, having first introduced celebrity voices to the fray in November 2013. Previous big-name stars to land on Waze include Arnold Schwarzenegger and Kevin Hart, while Morgan Freeman jumped on board earlier this year to promote his new movie, London has Fallen .\nTo activate the new voices within Waze, head to your the settings area within the app, and therein you’ll find “English (US) – Clarkson, Hammond & May”, which will be available until the promotion expires on February 5.\n",

      "text": "Cyber Monday deal: Get the unlocked Motorola Moto Z with $200 off from Amazon It's the right moment to buy the Motorola Moto Z \nDidn’t get all you needed on Black Friday ? Not to worry, Cyber Monday is here with a great smartphone offer. The unlocked Motorola Moto Z is currently available on Amazon with a hefty discount. \nIf you too like Motorola , then this is the right time to acquire this high-end device. The Moto Z was previously sold with a $699.99 price-tag, but today you can get it for $499.99 (save $200). In case you’re really interested in the phone, you better hurry up because the promo ends in about 22h. \nFor those who don’t remember, we’ll remind you the phone arrives with a 5.5-inch display with 1,440 x 2,560 pixel resolution and 535 ppi plus Gorilla Glass 4. \nThe phone bundles a Snapdragon 820 processor clocked at 2.15 GHz, in combination with 4GB of RAM and either 32GB or 64GB of internal storage. If you’re not satisfied, you can always opt to extend memory capacity to 256GB via the microSD card slot. \nIn the photography department, the phone isn’t so impressive like the Moto Z Force Droid for instance, which takes advantage of a 21MP main camera. The Moto Z features a more modest 13MP back camera with f/1.8, laser autofocus and OIS. As for the selfie snapper, we have a 5MP unit onboard. \nThe phone is kept alive by a 2,600 mAh battery and is available from Amazon in Black. It’s unlocked and compatible with US GSM networks like T-Mobile and AT&T . \nAnother reason to take advantage of this promotion right now is that recently Motorola announced it will start rolling out the Android 7.0 Nougat update for the phone soon. The company says, the Moto Z is one of the first non-Google smartphones to gain Daydream VR (Google’s virtual reality headset) support. 1 of 10",

      "text": "Amazon.com Inc.'s stock AMZN, -1.74% fell 1.7% in midday trade Monday, which should come as no surprise to investors despite early reports of another big jump in overall Cyber Monday online sales. On the 11 previous Cyber Mondays, which was coined by Shop.org and the National Retail Federation in 2005, Amazon's stock fell six times, including the past three years. The median percentage move for the stock on the first Monday after Thanksgiving has been a decline of 0.2%, while the average move on the day was a decline of 1.5%. Meanwhile, the SPDR S&P Retail ETF XRT, -0.84% dropped 0.9% on Monday, which is exactly what history suggests. On the past 10 Cyber Mondays since the ETF's inception in June 2006, it has declined nine times, with an average decline of 2.5%. That includes a 10% decline on the 2008 Cyber Monday, which was in the middle of the financial crisis. Despite Monday's decline, Amazon's stock is still up 13% year to date, while the retail ETF has gained 6.9% and the S&P 500 index SPX, -0.38% has climbed 7.9%.",
