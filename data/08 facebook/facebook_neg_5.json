      "text": "Technology  58pm EST German minister says Facebook should be treated as a media company German Justice Minister Heiko Maas attends a cabinet meeting at the Chancellery in Berlin, Germany September 21, 2016. REUTERS/Stefanie Loos By Caroline Copley | BERLIN \nBERLIN Germany's Justice Minister says he believes Facebook Inc. ( FB.O ) should be treated like a media company rather than a technology platform, suggesting he favors moves to make social media groups criminally liable for failing to remove hate speech. \nUnder a program that runs until March, German authorities are monitoring how many racist posts reported by Facebook users are deleted within 24 hours. Justice Minister Heiko Maas has pledged to take legislative measures if the results are still unsatisfactory by then. \nMaas has said the European Union needs to decide whether platform companies should be treated like radio or television stations, which can be held accountable for the content they publish. \n\"In my view they should be treated as media even if they do not correspond to the media concept of television or radio,\" he said following a meeting of state justice ministers in Berlin. \nUnder current EU guidelines Facebook and other social media networks are not liable for any criminal content or hate posts hosted on their platform. \nInstead, in May Facebook, Google's ( GOOGL.O ) YouTube and Twitter signed the EU hate speech code, vowing to fight racism and xenophobia by reviewing the majority of hate speech notifications within 24 hours. But the code is voluntary not legally binding. \nThe state justice ministers meeting in Berlin called on the government to take swift action against hate speech on the Internet. \n\"We need concrete legislative measures,\" said Hamburg's Justice Minister Till Steffen and pressed Maas to start work on a draft law so that measures could be passed before federal elections next year. \nThe ministers called for more transparency and said social media companies should be obliged to regularly publish figures on how many hate posts have been deleted. They also wanted more public information on how notifications are processed and the criteria behind the decision making. \nIf a company refuses to delete hate posts, fines of up to 1 million euros ($1.1 million) should be possible, Steffen said. \nFacebook says it is a technology company, not a media company, that builds the tools to supply users with news and information but does not produce content. \nBut its content policies have come under growing international scrutiny amid several controversial takedowns and reversals in recent months, including the company's handling of a famous Vietnam war photograph of a naked girl burned by napalm. \n(Additional reporting by Hans-Edzaard Buseman; Editing by Greg Mahlich) Next In Technology News",

      "text": "Facebook fake-news writer: 'I think Donald Trump is in the White House because of me' 1 / 21 Back to Gallery \nWhat do the Amish lobby, gay wedding vans and the ban of the national anthem have in common? For starters, they're all make-believe - and invented by the same man. \nPaul Horner, the 38-year-old impresario of a Facebook fake-news empire, has made his living off viral news hoaxes for several years. He has twice convinced the Internet that he's British graffiti artist Banksy; he also published the very viral, very fake news of a Yelp vs. \"South Park\" lawsuit last year. \nBut in recent months, Horner has found the fake-news ecosystem growing more crowded, more political and vastly more influential: In March, Donald Trump's son Eric and his then-campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, even tweeted links to one of Horner's faux-articles. His stories have also appeared as news on Google. \nIn light of concerns that stories like Horner's may have affected the presidential election, and in the wake of announcements that both Google and Facebook would take action against deceptive outlets, The Washington Post called Horner to discuss his perspective on fake news. \nThe recent presidential election cycle sparked criticism of social media outlets over a failure to properly disclose fake news. This video explains how to report such issues. Media: Dianne de Guzman \nQ: You've been writing fake news for a while now - you're kind of like the OG Facebook news hoaxer. Well, I'd call it hoaxing or fake news. You'd call it parody or satire. How is that scene different now than it was three or five years ago? Why did something like your story about Obama invalidating the election results (almost 250,000 Facebook shares, as of this writing) go so viral? \nA: Honestly, people are definitely dumber. They just keep passing stuff around. Nobody fact-checks anything anymore - I mean, that's how Trump got elected. He just said whatever he wanted, and people believed everything, and when the things he said turned out not to be true, people didn't care because they'd already accepted it. It's real scary. I've never seen anything like it. \nQ: You mentioned Trump, and you've probably heard the argument, or the concern, that fake news somehow helped him get elected. What do you make of that? \nA: My sites were picked up by Trump supporters all the time. I think Trump is in the White House because of me. His followers don't fact-check anything - they'll post everything, believe anything. His campaign manager posted my story about a protester getting paid $3,500 as fact. Like, I made that up. I posted a fake ad on Craigslist. \nQ: Why? I mean - why would you even write that? \nA: Just 'cause his supporters were under the belief that people were getting paid to protest at their rallies, and that's just insane. I've gone to Trump protests - trust me, no one needs to get paid to protest Trump. I just wanted to make fun of that insane belief, but it took off. They actually believed it. \nI thought they'd fact-check it, and it'd make them look worse. I mean that's how this always works: Someone posts something I write, then they find out it's false, then they look like idiots. But Trump supporters - they just keep running with it! They never fact-check anything! Now he's in the White House. Looking back, instead of hurting the campaign, I think I helped it. And that feels (bad). \nQ: You think you personally helped elect Trump? \nA: I don't know. I don't know if I did or not. I don't know. I don't know. \nQ: I guess I'm curious, if you believed you might be having an unfair impact on the election - especially if that impact went against your own political beliefs - why didn't you stop? Why keep writing? \nA: I didn't think it was possible for him to get elected president. I thought I was messing with the campaign, maybe I wasn't messing them up as much as I wanted - but I never thought he'd actually get elected. I didn't even think about it. In hindsight, everyone should've seen this coming - everyone assumed Hillary (Clinton) would just get in. But she didn't, and Trump is president. \nQ: Speaking of Clinton - did you target fake news at her supporters? Or Gary Johnson's, for that matter? (Horner's Facebook picture shows him at a rally for Johnson.) \nA: No. I hate Trump. \nQ: Is that it? You posted on Facebook a couple weeks ago that you had a lot of ideas for satirizing Clinton and other figures, but that \"no joke ... in doing this for six years, the people who clicked ads the most, like it's the cure for cancer, is right-wing Republicans.\" That makes it sound like you've found targeting conservatives is more profitable. \nA: Yeah, it is. They don't fact-check. \nQ: But a Trump presidency is good for you from a business perspective, right? \nA: It's great for anybody who does anything with satire - there's nothing you can't write about now that people won't believe. I can write the craziest thing about Trump, and people will believe it. I wrote a lot of crazy anti-Muslim stuff - like about Trump wanting to put badges on Muslims, or not allowing them in the airport, or making them stand in their own line - and people went along with it! \nQ: Facebook and Google recently announced that they'd no longer let fake-news sites use their advertising platforms. I know you basically make your living from those services. How worried are you about this? \nA: This whole Google AdSense thing is pretty scary. And all this Facebook stuff. I make most of my money from AdSense - like, you wouldn't believe how much money I make from it. Right now I make like $10,000 a month from AdSense. \nI know ways of getting hooked up under different names and sites. So probably if they cracked down, I would try different things. I have at least 10 sites right now. If they crack down on a couple, I'll just use others. They could shut down advertising on all my sites, and I think I'd be OK. Plus, Facebook and AdSense make a lot of money from (advertising on fake news sites) for them to just get rid of it. They'd lose a lot of money. \nBut if it did really go away, that would suck. I don't know what I would do. \nQ: Thinking about this less selfishly, though - it might be good if Facebook and Google took action, right? Because the effects you're describing are pretty scary. \nA: Yeah, I mean - a lot of the sites people are talking about, they're just total BS sites. There's no creativity or purpose behind them. I'm glad they're getting rid of them. I don't like getting lumped in with Huzlers. I like getting lumped in with the Onion. The stuff I do - I spend more time on it. There's purpose and meaning behind it. I don't just write fake news just to write it. \nSo, yeah, I see a lot of the sites they're listing, and I'm like - good. There are so many horrible sites out there. I'm glad they're getting rid of those sites. \nI just hope they don't get rid of mine, too. \nCaitlin Dewey is The Post's digital culture critic.

      "text": "Follow CBSMIAMI.COM: Facebook | Twitter \nMIAMI (CBSMiami) – A man caught on camera unleashing a nasty tirade on a Starbucks employee said he did it because it took too long for her to make his coffee. \nIt happened Wednesday at coffee chain’s storefront near the University of Miami. \nPart of the exchange between David Sanguesa and employees in the crowded restaurant was caught on cell phone video. \nAt one point, Sanguesa calls the woman “garbage” and “trash”. He then tells her that he voted for Donald Trump to which she replies “so what.” He then demands his money back and is given it. \nA man behind the counter tries to intervene, telling Sanguesa that he can’t talk to people like that. The two then got into an argument until Sanguesa stormed out of the restaurant in disgust. \nSanguesa claims the woman deliberately took a long time to make his order because he is white and voted for Trump. \n“I was not served coffee and they said names, and I was called names from college kids, horrible names and I got upset, and I was wrong for getting upset but I didn’t deserve that discrimination or racism because of who I voted for,” said Sanguesa. \nSanguesa did not say why he thought his race or voting choice offended the woman. On the cell phone video, you don’t hear anyone call Sanguesa names. \nIn response to the cell phone video, which was posted online, Starbucks issued the following statement. \n“Embracing diversity and treating each other with respect and dignity is core to Starbucks values and something our partners take great pride in showing. We are committed to providing an inclusive, supportive and safe work environment for everyone.”",

      "text": "iStock Like us on Facebook \nThe United States may be experiencing some turmoil over its recent presidential election, but in Canada, political discussions of a different source are happening in the halls of government. Namely, is Parliament too dignified for the word fart ? On November 15, members of Canada’s Parliament began debating whether or not its members should reference flatulence on the floor, as Mashable dutifully reports. \nDuring a discussion of carbon taxes, Conservative MP Michelle Rempel got colorful, asking, “Why does the government treat Alberta like a fart in the room that nobody wants to talk about or acknowledge?” \nIn response, Green Party MP Elizabeth May of British Columbia decided to spell out just how offensive her word choice was. “I hate to interrupt my friend in her speech, but I heard her say a word that I know is distinctly unparliamentary, and I think she may want to withdraw it,” she declared. “The word was f-a-r-t.” Later, she explained that “the reason I feel it is important to make something of the member's choice of words is that she then accused people opposite her for reacting. In that context, decorum and respect are important in this place.” \nAnother Conservative MP from Alberta told her to sit down, and eventually someone broke out the rule book on Parliamentary language. The discussion later moved on to more serious matters, leaving the issue of the f-word unresolved. How will we ever know how to refer to flatulence in the halls of government now? \nBecause Canada is a beautiful place, the entire discussion has been transcribed by the independent, volunteer-run openparliament.ca, and can be viewed in its entirety here .",

      "text": "The rise of “fake” news, and the role that services like Facebook played in that rise has become one of the defining issues of the 2016 election. Did hoaxes and misinformation help Donald Trump win? And if so, what--if anything--should Facebook do about it? Who is to blame?\nWhat makes this issue so difficult is that hard answers to those questions are difficult to come by, if not impossible. And finding solutions is not likely to get any easier.\nLet’s take the first of those questions: Did fake news help Trump win? We simply don’t know. Some believe that false stories about Hillary Clinton murdering people or similar hoaxes definitely swayed the electorate , while others believe all these stories did was confirm biases that voters already had.\nThose who argue that fake news did play a role point to evidence that these kinds of stories were hugely popular on Facebook, and were spread far more widely than “real” news stories.\nA recent BuzzFeed investigation by Craig Silverman, for example, showed that the 20 most shared fake stories were far more popular with users than the top 20 real news stories from mainstream media outlets.\nGet Data Sheet , Fortune’s technology newsletter. \nThe top viral fake, entitled “ Pope Francis Shocks the World, Endorses Donald Trump for President ,” came from a site called Ending the Fed and was shared or interacted with on Facebook almost a million times. The top real news story from the Washington Post , which was about Donald Trump’s alleged history of corruption, fell well short of that mark.\nAs both New York magazine and journalism researcher Mark Bunting have pointed out--and Silverman has admitted--the BuzzFeed sample is a relatively small one, and it doesn’t mean that all fake news was more popular than all real news. It also doesn’t measure the true reach of either the fake or real news stories, because Facebook doesn’t make it easy to do that (which is a big part of the problem when it comes to determining the size of the fake news phenomenon).\nNevertheless, fake news is clearly spreading far and wide on Facebook, and the company’s response to it has been relatively weak. In effect, Facebook says it is concerned, but that it doesn’t believe it’s a big problem, and doesn’t think it affected the election.\nAs a counterpoint to that, the Washington Post recently spoke to someone who makes a business out of creating fake news. Paul Horner told the newspaper that he created dozens of fakes and saw them shared widely by Trump fans, including the presidential candidate’s campaign manager.\nMy sites were picked up by Trump supporters all the time. I think Trump is in the White House because of me. His followers don't fact-check anything--they'll post everything, believe anything. His campaign manager posted my story about a protester getting paid $3,500 as fact.\nSince Horner essentially admitted that he lies for a living, it’s difficult to know how much credence to give his report on the impact of fake news. Did it really help get Trump elected?\nEven if it’s true that fake news stories just confirmed what people already thought--a phenomenon that sociologists call “confirmation bias” --it’s still possible that having those beliefs confirmed every day on Facebook made people less likely to change their votes, or less likely to listen to competing arguments about a different candidate.\nBut when it comes to Facebook actually doing something about that, the issue gets even more complicated. For one thing, as journalist Jessica Lessing and others have pointed out , determining what is fake and what isn’t would give Facebook even more power and control over news content than it already has.\nFacebook is taking on Craigslist with this new feature. Watch: \nThe biggest problem when it comes to solving this, however, comes down to human nature . The fact that a news story is shown to be untrue--either by being labeled a fake, or being fact-checked by mainstream news organizations--doesn’t seem to affect whether people choose to share or believe it.\nNew York university professor and author Clay Shirky said recently that “people trade untrue stories that encapsulate things they believe about the world all the time,” and there is a lot of truth to that. People don’t share news stories on Facebook because they are true or factual. They share them because they feel true, or because sharing them is a way of signaling membership in a specific cultural group.\nAs Walter Quattrociocchi, the author of a study on social echo chambers, put it in a recent interview with the New York Times about fake news and Facebook, this “creates an ecosystem in which the truth value of the information doesn’t matter. All that matters is whether the information fits in your narrative.”\nEven the act of fact-checking a fake news story has been shown to actually reinforce the belief system of those who want it to be true. Mike Masnick of the technology commentary site Techdirt has said that he often gets responses from people claiming that Snopes.com --one of the Internet’s longest-surviving and most active fact-checking sites--is a liberal front.\nThis aspect of human nature is something that Facebook and other social networks have “weaponized,” as Josh Benton of the Nieman Journalism Lab put it recently . It is so easy to share something, and the social benefits are more or less the same whether it is true or not.\nSo what can we do about this kind of “post-truth” environment? It’s clear that Facebook could take some kind of action to identify hoaxes and block fake sites--although it is not in the company’s economic interests to do so, as Shirky noted . But even that won’t be enough.\nIt’s possible that the only way to stop people sharing fake news is to try to understand why they are sharing it, and spend some time getting at the root of those problems. Unfortunately, that’s a much more time-consuming and difficult task than fact-checking a news story. And it’s something that the fragmented media industry of today isn’t particularly adept at doing.\nCould Facebook help on that score? Could it find some way of introducing people to alternate viewpoints or promoting understanding rather than creating a cultural battleground? Only Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg knows the answer.",

      "text": "David Paul Morris—Bloomberg /Getty Images Mark Zuckerberg, chief executive officer and founder of Facebook Inc., reacts during a session at the Techonomy 2016 conference in Half Moon Bay, California, U.S., on Thursday, Nov. 10, 2016. Zuckerberg says he \"cares deeply\" about the company's fake news problem \nAs critics slam Facebook for the role they believe it—and in particular its penchant for fake news stories— played in the election of Donald Trump, CEO Mark Zuckerberg continues to resist any attempt to pin some of the blame on his company. But in doing so, he misses the point. \nOver the weekend, the Facebook co-founder took to the site to respond to some of those criticisms. He said he “cares deeply” about the fake news problem and wants to get it right. But he also said that he doesn’t believe fake news contributed to the election’s outcome. \n“Of all the content on Facebook, more than 99% of what people see is authentic,” Zuckerberg wrote. And since only a very small amount of those hoaxes relate to politics, and an even smaller number related to Clinton specifically, he argued that “this makes it extremely unlikely hoaxes changed the outcome of this election in one direction or the other.” \nThe Facebook CEO also scoffed at the suggestion that the company is actually a media entity, or that it should behave like one, something many have argued for some time. \n“Facebook is mostly about helping people stay connected with friends and family. News and media are not the primary things people do on Facebook, so I find it odd when people insist we call ourselves a news or media company,” Zuckerberg said. “We are serious about building planes to beam internet access, but we don’t call ourselves an aerospace company.” \nZuckerberg responded to the “filter bubble” argument by saying the company’s research shows that people “are exposed to more diverse content on Facebook and social media than on traditional media like newspapers and TV.” In other words, filter bubbles used to be worse. \nAll of these arguments are true to some extent, but they still miss the larger point. And if anything, they reinforce the idea that Zuckerberg is desperately trying to avoid responsibility for the way Facebook influences the media consumption of its users. Even some of his own staffers are wrestling with this problem , according to a New York Times report. \nAs a number of people have pointed out, the social network can’t have it both ways. It can’t argue that Facebook is hugely influential for advertisers, or that it plays a key role in social movements like the Arab Spring, and yet also argue that fake news has no effect on users. FB + Twitter cannot take credit for changing the world during events like the Egyptian Uprising, then downplay their influence on elections \n— this is not normal. (@karenkho) November 13, 2016 \nTo borrow Zuckerberg’s aerospace analogy, if Facebook flew planes and 1% of them crashed and killed all passengers on impact, most people probably wouldn’t accept the argument that this is a small number, and that in any case it isn’t really an airplane company because its real focus is the technology that keeps them from crashing most of the time. \nIn a sense, debating whether Facebook should call itself a media company or not is a red herring. Whatever it calls itself, it is one of the largest distributors of news that has ever existed. \nThis problem doesn’t just affect Facebook either. Google has also come under fire for pointing to fake news sites in Google News, including one site that topped its election results but had the wrong numbers. The company said it is “looking into” what happened. \nIn today’s news environment, traditional outlets have lost control over the distribution of their content, and platforms like Facebook and Google have taken over. In the process, they have become the most powerful media companies in history. And that brings with it certain responsibilities. It's in journalism's best interest to report news accurately.It's in tech's best interest to distribute news voluminously. \n— (((Josh))) (@Tyrangiel) November 14, 2016 \nIt’s obvious why Facebook doesn’t want to admit that it has these responsibilities, of course. As a prominent Silicon Valley venture capitalist and Facebook investor told my colleague Jeff Roberts recently, admitting this would open the company up to an avalanche of criticism for being biased on one side or the other. And that would be a recipe for disaster. \nThat’s exactly what happened during the Trending Topics fiasco, when editors responsible for weeding out bad sites were accused of bias against conservative sites. Facebook’s response was to fire them all and sweep the problem under the rug by pretending it could all be done algorithmically. \nAccording to a report from Gizmodo, Facebook’s engineers actually developed a way of using its algorithms to detect and block fake news, but a test of the feature found that a disproportionate number of these stories were from right-wing sites. \nBecause the social network was afraid of more backlash over allegations of bias, Gizmodo says the feature was never released (Facebook has since denied that this occurred). \nIn his post, Zuckerberg said the company is working on ways for users to flag fake news. But are users who see fake articles that reinforce their beliefs going to flag them? That seems unlikely. \nThe core problem for Facebook is that what it wants more than anything else is engagement, and as a former Facebook staffer argued recently , “bullshit is highly engaging.” That means despite Zuckerberg’s protest that he cares deeply about the problem, finding a solution is never going to be as economically advantageous as not finding a solution. \nOne other point: The Facebook CEO says he doesn’t want his company to become “arbiters of truth.” But the reality is—as technology publishers Tim O’Reilly pointed out in a recent blog post —that the social network is already doing this on a regular basis by deleting posts and censoring content it deems unacceptable. Zuckerberg is saying Facebook won't decide what \"truth\" is, even though on Facebook truth & credibility is defined by Facebook engagement pic.twitter.com/BMYAN7u3Z9 \n— Hamza Shaban (@hshaban) November 13, 2016 \nFiguring out what “fake news” consists of and flagging it in some way, or even down-ranking it in the news feed, may be a difficult technological challenge. And it may expose Facebook to charges of being biased in one direction or another. But the status quo is not going to work. \nRegardless of whether he personally wants to grapple with this thorny problem or not, Zuckerberg will have to admit that Facebook is a large and increasingly powerful player in the news business, and that certain duties and responsibilities come along with that. And the sooner he does so, the better. ",

      "text": "Pictures on Facebook showing a 12-year-old girl from Utah posing with carcasses from a series of hunts have been targeted for criticism.\nPeople from around the world have posted on Aryanna Gourdin’s page, including some who have issued death threats, according to media reports.\nOne of the most controversial pictures showed Aryanna posing with a dead giraffe, holding her rifle up in victory.\n\n“Thanks for reminding me that stupid people still exist.. Please consider using that thing in your head next time, that what we call A BRAIN,” one user wrote, according to Daily Mail.\nAryanna has been pictured hunting with a bow and a rifle. As well as African animals, like giraffes and zebras, she has also been photographed with animals native to North America like bears and deer.\nFamily friend Mark Martineau, who runs Rack Em Up Hunts and organized a safari to Africa involving Aryanna and her father, Eli, defended the girl.\n“All of these death threats towards a child because she chooses to hunt,” Martineau wrote on his business page.\n\n“You threaten her or her family and you'll have to come through her father and myself and thousands of others. I promise you I wouldn't hesitate,” he added.\nAryanna’s photos provoked even more extreme responses.\nComments included “Literally hope someone skins you,” “makes me wanna kill her” and “do the world a favor and kill yourself already before someone makes you disappear.”\nOthers have defended Aryanna, saying she is contributing to conservation work. They also point to the fact that the meat from the dead animals was donated to local orphanages.\n“No many 12 year olds let alone grown men have experienced as many hunts as this little lady has […] this little gal is the next big thing,” administrators on Rack Em Up wrote of Aryanna, according to SFGate.\nAryanna and her father are currently out of the country. Martineau says they will speak to the media upon their return.\n",

Post to Facebook Report: Fake election news performed better than real news on Facebook Buzzfeed investigation claims impact felt during final months of the presidential race.  //usat.ly/2fAyIzG   Report: Fake election news performed better than real news on Facebook Brett Molina , USA TODAY 2:15   Facebook changes its controversial affinity advertising program. (Photo: Karen Bleier, AFP/Getty Images)   \nThe story receiving the most engagement on Facebook in the final three months of the election was about Pope Francis releasing a statement endorsing Republican nominee (now President-elect) Donald Trump. \nIt was fake. \nAccording to an analysis by Buzzfeed , fake stories outperformed real news stories during the final three months of the election. Their analysis found 20 top-performing stories from \"hoax sites and hyperpartisan blogs\" generated more than 8.7 million shares, reactions and comments. By comparison, the top 20 performing stories from 19 major news websites including The New York Times and Washington Post generated nearly 7.4 million shares, reactions and comments. \nThe analysis follows recent criticism of Facebook for how it fails to weed out fake news stories, with some critics going so far to claim Facebook is to blame for influencing the results. \nFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg says it's \"extremely unlikely\" the social network had that kind of influence on the election, he did promise to offer users more tools to eliminate fake or hoax stories. \nMeanwhile, one creator of fake news stories — Sam Horner — appears to show some remorse in an interview with The Washington Post for unknowingly helping Trump's campaign. \nAsked why fake stories like his go viral so quickly: \"Honestly, people are definitely dumber. They just keep passing stuff around. Nobody fact-checks anything anymore — I mean, that’s how Trump got elected. He just said whatever he wanted, and people believed everything, and when the things he said turned out not to be true, people didn’t care because they’d already accepted it. It’s real scary. I’ve never seen anything like it.\" \nFollow Brett Molina on Twitter: @brettmolina23 .  ",

(Photo: EJ Montini) \nYou know the old saying about a picture being worth a thousand words? Well, here are several thousand words worth of venom boiled down in five pictures, conveniently provided to me by the letter writer. It's been a banner week for hate mail. These images were all taken from a single correspondence. \nIt begins with the not-so-subtle message that I need to start \"looking\" and \"listening\" to ... the right people, I guess. \nStep 1: The warning. \nThen, we move on to the racism. \nStep 2: Using the N-word, (Photo: EJ Montini) \nNext, a bit of anti-Semitism. \nStep 3: Anti-Semitism \nThen a statement of political preference. \nStep 4: Political preference (Photo: EJ Montini) \nFinally (and this item is what makes the letter so precious) we get a profession of faith. \nStep 5: Profession of faith.

      "title": "Alt-right retaliates against Twitter ban by creating 'fake black accounts’ | Technology",
      "text": "While Facebook battles with its fake news problem, Twitter is dealing with a different problem: fake accounts set up by the alt-right.\nGab: alt-right's social media alternative attracts users banned from Twitter Read more \nWhite supremacist website the Daily Stormer claims that it has already created thousand of what it refers to as “fake black person” accounts to troll Twitter and confuse its users. It is now urging its readers to do the same in retaliation for Twitter suspending high-profile right-wing users .\n“We’ve got a big campaign coming up,” said Andrew Anglin, the founder of the Daily Stormer, in a post. “Twitter is about to learn what happens when you mess with Republicans.”\nHere are Anglin’s instructions for creating a fake account: “Just go on black Twitter and see what they look like, copy that model. Start filling it with rap videos and booty-shaking or whatever else these blacks post. Read through their posts to get an idea of how they post. You need to be able to post in a manner which is indistinguishable from normal black tweeters.”\nTwitter has been clamping down on hate speech after it refreshed its “hateful conduct policy” and introduced new tools to allow users to mute specific conversations or phrases from their notifications.\n“Our hateful conduct policy prohibits specific contact that targets people on the basis of race, ethnicity, national origin, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, religious affiliation, age, disability or disease,” said the company. \nA number of alt-right Twitter users – including white nationalist Richard Spencer, former Business Insider CTO Pax Dickinson and alt-right personalities Ricky Vaughn and John Rivers – have had their accounts suspended for breaching the policy. \nFacebook’s failure: did fake news and polarized politics get Trump elected? Read more \nIn a YouTube video complaining about his suspension from Twitter, Spencer described the “great purge” as “corporate Stalinism”. \n“I am alive physically, but digitally speaking, there have been execution squads across the alt-right,” he said. \nIt’s not clear what the alt-right plans to do with these newly created Twitter accounts, but Anglin seems intent on damaging the company, arguing that it won’t be able to “maintain its prominent role in the social networking market when it bans all non-SJW [‘social justice warrior’, aka liberal] political accounts and becomes a safespace hugbox”. \nHe told his readers that “further orders will follow shortly”. \nTwitter did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",

      "text": "Facebook is adding donate buttons to charity Live videos The social network is concentrating on doing more 'social good.' Share Save \nAfter spending a week battling a fake news epidemic , getting to grips with privacy regulators in Europe and dealing with another admission of misreporting ad data , Facebook finally has some good news to share. In a bid to do more \"social good,\" Mark Zuckerberg and his team have announced a new round of updates to community tools aimed at keeping users safe and allowing them to help others. \nFirst is an update to Facebook's Safety Check feature, a tool that lets users tell their friends and family they are safe during a natural disaster or a potentially dangerous event. As we reported last week , Facebook has confirmed it's in the process of creating always-on Safety Check hubs called Community Help, which will let people mark themselves safe, but also offer or request things like shelter, food and supplies. Facebook will also put Safety Check activations in the hands of users, so when a lot of people share news of an incident in a particular area, they may be asked to confirm they are out of harm's way. \nNext is a way for non-profit organizations to do more of what they're good at: raising donations. Facebook says it's in the process of expanding its Fundraisers tool to more than 750,000 non-profits, which includes the option to add a donate button to Live buttons and posts. If someone is broadcasting their charitable event via Facebook Live, you'll now be able to donate instead of spreading goodwill via Likes and Heart Reactions . \nFor Movember, the charity drive that gives hairy dudes a valid reason to get hairier, US users will be able to collect donations directly via Facebook. To further promote #GivingTuesday, the company has teamed up with the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation to contribute up to $1 million to Facebook fundraisers. \"The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation will provide $500,000 in matching funds, up to $1,000 per Facebook fundraiser, and Facebook will waive up to $500,000 of fees on all donations,\" says Naomi Gleit, VP of Social Good.

One of them being that it’s hard to prevent fake, unreliable news from spreading incredibly fast.\nBut Uproxx just let us know that four college students solved Facebook’s problem in two days ! And it was a problem, because imagine reading about a rock concert and then discovering that it’s a hoax ( after you shared it with your friends). Or when misinformation could have serious ramifications, like, we don’t know, during a presidential election. \nSo how did these Princeton students figure out a solution for this majorly disruptive issue? \nWell, they built a link verifier called FiB, which you can install as a Chrome extension. Basically it scans and checks all the data, sources and images and marks the story “verified” or “not verified.” If you accidentally share something that’s fake, it gently informs you.\nOkay, this is officially genius. Especially if you’re sick of seeing fake news plastered all over your feed.\nKudos to these students for figuring it out before Mark Zuckerberg and his team! We expect great things from these youngins’. \nHopefully this extension makes Facebook more user-friendly, and discourages the whole concept of fake news in general. Because, why?!\nThe post These college students just solved Facebook’s fake news problem, and, woah appeared first on HelloGiggles .",

      "text": "A Houston television reporter has been fired after making a Facebook post that expressed joy at the winner of last week's presidential election and criticized the Obama administration. Scarlett Fakhar (KRIV-TV) \nIn a post Thursday on her professional Facebook page, Scarlett Fakhar thanked her supporters for their love and prayers. \n\"Fox 26 Houston fired me today for expressing my conservative views on my private Facebook page,\" she wrote. \"That is all I will say for now.\" \nFakhar, 25, posted last week on her personal Facebook page, which is viewable by the public, that she was \"happy and relieved\" after the election. \n\"I prayed for the best leader that will turn this country that has become more violent and racist under the Obama administration than ever âŚ into the America I once knew,\" she wrote in a since-deleted post. Houston TV reporter removes apology for pro-Donald Trump Facebook post \nShe continued, saying that President Barack Obama \"has made the entire country hate one another\" and that \"I hate to say it âŚ but the number of African Americans killing one another far outweighs the number of them being killed by whites.\" \nFakhar later apologized on her personal Facebook page \"for making public my personal views on the outcome of the election and other issues. \n\"It was wholly inappropriate, as a journalist, to do that,\" she wrote. \nThat post has also been removed from her page. \nA KRIV spokeswoman said last week that the station had no comment on Fakhar's original post. Fox Television Stations confirmed her firing from the Fox affiliate to the Houston Chronicle on Thursday. \nJournalism ethics seek to avoid bias; the Society of Professional Journalists' code of ethics advises journalists to \"avoid conflicts of interest, real or perceived\" as well as to \"distinguish between advocacy and news reporting.\" \nFakhar reported a story Wednesday night about an elementary-school student who said he was attacked by his classmates after a mock election in which he voted for Donald Trump. \nBefore joining KRIV in September 2015, Fakhar worked at TV stations in Austin and Lubbock.

      "text": "November 17, 2016 Andrew Hutchinson \nI’ve been debating whether to weigh in on the Facebook fake news issue and role the platform played in the 2016 US Presidential Election. For one, it feels like most people are largely fatigued by Trump v Clinton and need a bit of a break to take it all in and assess where we’re at, and Facebook’s involvement has also been so heavily covered on other platforms that I wasn’t sure it needed re-iterating here. \nBut readers have asked about it and why we’ve not covered it, so here are three points that I think are relevant to the debate and the lasting implications of the 2016 US Presidential Election result. 1. Facebook Absolutely Influenced the Vote \nTo deny this is illogical – Facebook now plays an integral role in the dissemination and distribution of news, and as such, it also plays a role in how people are informed, thereby influencing what they think. Add to this the fact that Facebook’s News Feed is fuelled by an algorithm which provides users with more content similar to that which they’re interacting with , and the link is fairly obvious. \nReally, it’s not even up for debate – as has been quoted elsewhere, research shows that 67% of Americans use Facebook , and two-thirds of them get news there, equating to around 44% of the entire population who get at least some of their news from the site. \nThat number's likely even higher now – this research was conducted by Pew Research back in in January and Facebook’s North American user base has grown by seven million since then. It's fair to assume that a significant amount of those new users are also now getting news updates from the site. \nContrast that against the declines in overall TV consumption and newspaper readership and the impact is obvious - one way or another, Facebook’s rising prominence as a media source means the platform absolutely wields significant influence over news delivery, which, in turn, impacts audience behavior – but the case has actually been proven even more definitively than that. \nBack in 2010, around 340,000 extra voters turned out to take part in the US Congressional elections because of a single election-day Facebook message . This is based on research co-authored by Facebook, in which they proclaimed that it was: \n“…the first [study] to demonstrate that the online world can affect a significant real-world behaviour on a large scale.” \nThe process they used to prove this was relatively simple: \n“About 611,000 users (1%) received an 'informational message' at the top of their news feeds, which encouraged them to vote, provided a link to information on local polling places and included a clickable 'I voted' button and a counter of Facebook users who had clicked it. About 60 million users (98%) received a 'social message', which included the same elements but also showed the profile pictures of up to six randomly selected Facebook friends who had clicked the 'I voted' button. The remaining 1% of users were assigned to a control group that received no message.” \nThe results showed that users who received the 'informational' message (the top message in the above screenshot) voted at the same rate as those who saw no message at all, while those who saw the 'social' message – with images of their friends included (lower example in above screenshot) were 2% more likely to click the ‘I voted’ button and 0.4% more likely to head to the polls than the other group. Based on this, researchers estimated that the social message directly increased voter turnout by 60,000 votes, while a further 280,000 people were “indirectly nudged to the polls” by seeing messages in their News Feeds - \"notifications that their friends had voted\". \nThis is direct influence on an election via Facebook content. It’s not even a hypothetical, this research - again, co-authored by Facebook - proves it. \nWanna’ find out if Facebook thinks you’re more Liberal or Conservative based on your on-platform actions? You can do that too – go to www.facebook.com/ads/preferences , click on the \"Lifestyle and culture\" tab under the “Interests” section, then look for a box in that section titled \"US politics\". \nAgain (and as noted in the image), this is based on your on-platform actions, Facebook is well aware of users’ political leanings and has been using it as a targeting option, so this factor definitely does have some influence on the content you see. These elements all point to the fact that Facebook absolutely influences political opinion and how people subsequently vote – and even on a basic level, on your own usage of the platform, you know this. \nFor example, let’s say you’re going through you’re News Feed and you’re a Donald Trump supporter and there’s a friend of yours who’s posting a heap of links to articles about how bad Trump is and how Hillary is great. He gets annoying. You unfollow him. Granted, this is within the control of the user, not the platform, but at best, Facebook facilitates the expansion of political echo-chambers by making it easier than ever to filter out anything that doesn’t align with your perspective – while the News Feed algorithm also uses those actions as signals in order to serve you more personally relevant content, and we know that Facebook can infer political leaning based on such actions. \nThe News Feed shows you more of what you engage with, which is likely what you agree with, and less of what you don’t. By design, its reinforcement theory in practice – but the question then is whether that influence was enough to change the vote. 2. Eliminating Fake News Probably Won't Provide the Solution \nFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has dismissed the notion that fake or misleading content could have influenced the election result, noting that it only amounts to around 1% of content on the network. That seems like an underestimation given the evidence. \nFor example, BuzzFeed recently published the results of their investigation which found that in the final three months of the US presidential campaign, \"the top-performing fake election news stories on Facebook generated more engagement than the top stories from major news outlets such as the New York Times, Washington Post, Huffington Post, NBC News, and others\" \nNow that's not all of the content on Facebook, it's only a subset as sampled by BuzzFeed - but still there's a clear trend from that May-July period. So what happened in that space of time that could have had an impact. The uptick in fake news engagement matches when Facebook put \"friends first\" over traditional publishers June 30th https://t.co/O5eHNblHdG pic.twitter.com/fZ43a4ZO8r — Josh Constine (@JoshConstine) November 17, 2016 \nThis seems to correlate with previous studies - as noted in the 2010 election experiment, people were influenced to act when shown the 'social' message, the image with pictures of your friends on it, which enhanced the peer pressure of the notification. The jump in fake news shares is based on the same principle - Facebook's algorithm change put increased emphasis on what your friends were sharing ahead of Page posts, adding to the wider reach, and also the implied peer pressure, of those viewpoints. If your friends were engaging and sharing more of this content, you were bound to see more of it - combine that with increased discussion around the election and the theory makes sense. The spread of fake news increases, more people are influenced by those reports, the outcome is delivered. \nBut even if those fake reports were reaching a wider audience, were they actually able to influence the way people voted? \nThis element is much more difficult to prove. It's clear now that fake news ran rife throughout the election period – even Facebook insiders have (reportedly) admitted this . Stories like the Pope endorsing Donald Trump , Bill Clinton being charged with child rape , the murder of someone who was set to testify against Hillary Clinton – all of these falsehoods gained traction online and likely solidified people’s support one way or another, but these tales only gained traction at all because of the bigger concern with Facebook’s news feed, that being that it actively works to deliver more content which supports your existing beliefs, while banishing alternate perspectives from view. From that perspective, it seems more likely that fake reports merely reinforced people’s pre-existing opinions as opposed to shaping them - but that discounts the huge amount of undecided voters who, given the final margin, would have influenced the result. \nGoing on the research quoted above, it would suggest that what your friends share is definitely able to inspire real world action, and with more fake stories being shared, the influence seems clear. \nBut even if that was the case, it's not fake news that's the core issue, it's the echo-chamber - people being shown more of what they agree with, and subsequently engaging with that content, has then lead to that content having more reach and influence. And because the algorithm learns from your on-platform actions, they're also getting less and less exposure to the other side's perspective, thus, their viewpoint is only being underlined further and further with each post. \nFor example, if you saw a post in your feed that said that Hillary Clinton knowingly funded terrorism and you clicked on it, Facebook would take that as an indicator that you're interested in that topic, and you might suddenly see more stories along the same lines, while opposing views would be lessened, based on your now noted political preference. \nThat polarization was highlighted in a study conducted by The Guardian in which they asked ten voters - five conservative and five liberal – to switch sides and view Facebook feeds from the other perspective in the final month of the campaign. The Guardian created two Facebook accounts, one that followed pro-liberal news sites and one pro-conservative, then handed them to the participants of the opposing view. \nThe participants were amazed at the coverage they were seeing – one described the experience as being “like reading a book by a fool”, while another said it was “like being locked into a room full of those suffering from paranoid delusions”. \nThe experiment showed that the content each side is seeing is very different - but it wasn’t necessarily fake news or lies that were influencing their choices. In fact, none of the participants changed their vote as a result, and none of them made specific note about lies being debunked by the other side. The participants had pre-existing beliefs which had been fueled by their own experiences and connections - what they were seeing on Facebook only helped to reinforce them. \nOne participant noted that: \n“I did unfollow a lot of friends because I didn’t want to feel enticed to correct what they were saying and get in a fight.” \nThis seems to be a larger concern than fake news, that people are so easily able to switch off dissenting views. We presume that those on the other side of the debate are seeing the same evidence we're seeing because we're totally eliminating the counter, which is why we're so incredulous when so many end up supporting the opposing view. \nIn this sense, the role that fake news played in the process is only part of the bigger issue. Definitely, the increased spread of fake stories would have helped justify people’s existing leanings, and that, you can assume, had subsequent influence on undecided voters. But on a broad scale, if you were to remove fake content from the equation, it may not have actually changed the result. \nWhile eliminating fake news is a positive step in any case, the echo chamber is the more divisive element, and the real concern we should be discussing in regards to Facebook. 3. What Comes Next? \nAnd here’s the bigger question. Now that Trump is the US President and the nation seems more divided than it has in years, what happens next? What influence will social media echo chambers have in reinforcing the existing divisions and pushing people to take sides? \nMore than ever, people need understanding - they need to understand why people would vote for one side or another, what lead them to this conclusion, because it seems that the majority were clearly shocked at the result and that people are genuinely struggling to see why voters of the opposing view have given their support to either candidate. \nRight now, that’s the perspective we need in order to see the problems and issues that are present and move forward, but the concern here is that with that echo chamber effect in place, that may not be possible. If people’s existing views are only being reinforced by the media they consume, then we’re likely to see those divisions become bigger, more significant concerns over time. And given the current state, that’s a huge issue, and something that needs to be addressed. \nIn this respect, analyzing Facebook’s possible role in the 2016 US Presidential Election should be less about how the results played out and more about how people are getting their information, and how we can ensure there’s more diversity of opinion being shared to better align these two opposing perspectives. Sure, we’re never going to all see eye-to-eye, but if we’re divided now, and there’s an influential medium in the middle that’s built, essentially, around fueling that division even further, it seems that the situation is only going to get worse. \nAnd the solution could be hard to pinpoint – Facebook works to give users more of the content they like and want to see, which ultimately puts the power in their hands. If users want to narrow their perspective, they can. Given this, how do you prevent people from shutting out opposing voices and gaining more understanding of those around them? \nIt used to be that you’d watch the TV news, you’d read the newspaper - all of these sources would at least provide some exposure to alternate perspectives or events. But now it's perspective-based, it's interest-based - you can hone in on only the things you’re interested in and just see more and more of that, underlining, reinforcing and growing your opposition or agreement. \nThis is likely to be one of the most pressing issues of the next stage of media development, and right now it feels like a flashpoint, a critical juncture where the true impacts of this new media construct are becoming clear. How we address them, now that we’ve come so far in this new self-curation and user-controlled cycle, is something no one can answer at this stage. Author Information",

Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print Claudie Haigneré, 59, reportedly had to “be restrained” after yelling the eerie caution prior to falling into a coma from an overdose of sleeping pills. \nA shocking video claims France’s first female astronaut screamed “Earth must be warned!” before she attempted suicide. \nClaudie Haigneré, 59, reportedly had to “be restrained” after yelling the eerie caution prior to falling into a coma from an overdose of sleeping pills. \nA six-minute YouTube conspiracy film by UFOmania has resurfaced this week examining her story. It has been viewed nearly a million times. \nIn 1993, esteemed scientist Claudie was a backup crew member for the 1993 Mir Altaïr mission, which included her future husband, Jean-Pierre Haigneré. \nShe made it to the Mir space station in 1996 as part of the Russian-French Cassiopée mission, and in 2001 became the first European woman to visit the International Space Station. \nThe asteroid 135268 Haigneré is named after Claudie and her husband. \nAfter retiring from space work, Claudie entered French politics and worked as minister delegate for research and new technologies from 2002 to 2004 and minister delegate for European affairs from 2004 to 2005. \nBut, despite her efforts, budgets for scientific research were cut. \nAfter leaving politics, she worked in a biology lab at the Pasteur Institute. \nAfter retiring from space work, Claudie entered French politics and worked as minister delegate for research and new technologies from 2002 to 2004 and minister delegate for European affairs from 2004 to 2005. \nBut, despite her efforts, budgets for scientific research were cut. \nAfter leaving politics, she worked in a biology lab at the Pasteur Institute. \nThat’s where the story gets strange. \nIn December 2008, it was widely reported that Claudie had to be rushed to a hospital after allegedly taking an overdose of sleeping pills. \nIt was reported that she was found conscious but had to be restrained while screaming, “Earth must be warned!” before lapsing into a coma. \nClaudie blamed the incident on “burnout syndrome” and is now the director of the Cité des Sciences et de l’Industrie — the largest science museum in Europe. \nHowever, alien enthusiasts believe she was trying to warn the Earth about life in outer space. \nThe YouTube video, which is narrated by a robot voice, is a conspiracy that blends fact and fiction. \nClaudie did attempt suicide in 2008, but the rest appears to be made up and continuously reappears on conspiracy forums, such as David Icke’s website. \nThe video says: “She had to be forcefully restrained after screaming ‘Earth must be warned!’ \n“More ominously, her laboratory where she worked at the forefront of human/alien DNA research was destroyed by fire.” \nThe video uses quotes from real reports by news agency AFP, but they’re taken out of context, with additional information. \nThere is no such thing as “human/alien DNA research” because we have never encountered any aliens. \nClaudie’s story often pops up when something happens to a prominent UFO expert. \nThe mysterious death of conspiracy theorist Max Spiers in October may have triggered the latest interest. \nSpiers was found dead on a sofa at a friend’s house in Poland days after warning his mother to “investigate” if anything happened to him. Friends also claim he had vomited a black liquid before his death.",

      "text": "Like Us On Facebook \nIT’S THE BEST OF BOTH WORLDS. \nWhere were you five years ago? I was 21 years old and not going out to binge-drink with my friends because I was an adult. \nJust kidding! No one invited me, and I was unironically watching the last episode of “Hannah Montana.” \nAnd, like a gift from the Gods themselves, “Hannah Montana” is set to come back to the Disney Channel on December 3. \nDon’t get too excited though. Despite Miley Cyrus’s onscreen brother Jason Earles wanting a reboot, all we’re going to get is a marathon. \nPlus, do you really see our girl Miley donning that wig again? I don’t think it’s in the cards, at least not for a very long time… \nJust for the holidays, Disney will be airing all four seasons of “Hannah Montana,” so you can relive your own childhood fantasy of being an international pop star who’s just a regular girl. \nThe Miley Marathon may just cut into your 25 Days of Christmas holiday binge watching, as it’s set to run all the way through to December 29. \nThis is perfect, because most of us will be returning home for the holidays, and our parents have yet to cut the cable cord. \nInstead of bickering over what Netflix movie to watch,or awkwardly sitting through some of the raunchier scenes of “Westworld” with grandma, you can reconnect with Miley, Lilly, Oliver, Jackson, Robby Ray and Rico. \nOr avoid family interaction all together. \nDisney is really kicking “nostalgia” into overdrive. I literally ruined my Memorial Day weekend by watching every single Disney Channel Original Movie ever made. College Students Dress As Disney Princesses And Visit Children's Hospitals To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video \nThen, they announced there would be a “That’s So Raven” sequel. \nMan, Miley Cyrus and Hannah Montana. Multiple personalities have never been so endearing! Meanwhile, I can hardly deal with one life, let alone a double life. \nSubscribe to Elite Daily's official newsletter, The Edge , for more stories you don't want to miss. Shares",

      "text": "President Obama took time during a press conference today to assail the spread of fake news online, particularly the way it travels on Facebook. “In an age where there’s so much active misinformation and it’s packaged very well and it looks the same when you see it on a Facebook page or you turn on your television,” he said, “if everything seems to be the same and no distinctions are made, then we won’t know what to protect.”\nObama’s remarks come at a time when Facebook has been subject to withering criticism for allowing fake stories and hoaxes to spread to millions of users at a critical time. A BuzzFeed analysis this week found that top-performing fake stories performed better on Facebook during the run-up to this month’s presidential election than accurate stories shared by traditional media sites.\nObama made his remarks during a joint press conference in Germany with its chancellor, Angela Merkel, during a valedictory tour of Europe . He appears to have been thinking about Facebook’s fake-news problem for a while: a profile about his final days as president in The New Yorker today said he had talked “obsessively” about a BuzzFeed report on how Macedonian teens were spamming Facebook with fake Trump news for fun and profit.\n“Everything is true and nothing is true.” In such a world, “everything is true and nothing is true,” Obama told New Yorker editor David Remnick. “An explanation of climate change from a Nobel Prize-winning physicist looks exactly the same on your Facebook page as the denial of climate change by somebody on the Koch brothers’ payroll. And the capacity to disseminate misinformation, wild conspiracy theories, to paint the opposition in wildly negative light without any rebuttal — that has accelerated in ways that much more sharply polarize the electorate and make it very difficult to have a common conversation.”\nFor its part, Facebook (along with Google) moved this week to ban sites that post fake news from using its advertising network to make money. But CEO Mark Zuckerberg has resisted the idea that the company played a role in influencing the outcome of the US election, calling the idea “crazy.” Still, he said the company would do more to combat the spread of fake news — while saying Facebook would resist becoming an “arbiter of truth.” \nYou can watch Obama’s full press conference below. His comments about fake news begin 48 minutes in.",

      "text": "Mark Zuckerberg may not think fake news is a problem on Facebook . President Barack Obama disagrees. Obama, speaking Thursday alongside German Chancellor Angela Merkel during his last international trip as president, called out the spread of inaccurate information, specifically on Facebook and TV, as a threat to free speech and democratic principles. “In an age where there’s so much active misinformation —- and it’s packaged very well and it looks the same when you see it on a Facebook page or you turn on your television ... if everything seems to be the same and no distinctions are made, then we won’t know what to protect,” Obama said. “We won’t know what to fight for.” Obama didn’t mention Facebook by coincidence. The social network is currently under fire for its role in disseminating fake news to users in the weeks and months leading up last Tuesday’s presidential election, particularly stories in support of Republican candidate Donald Trump . Facebook CEO Zuckerberg has defended his company, saying fake news accounts for a very small percentage of overall posts on the social network, and the idea that it influenced the election is “crazy.” A lot of people — including some of his own employees — disagree. Now you can add Obama to that list, too. You can watch the president’s full speech below. The Facebook comment comes right around the 48-minute mark. recode_divider",

      "text": "Turn on tldr \nAdam Schrader could have seen this coming. \nThe 26-year-old former Facebook employee was anything but shocked when the social network entered meltdown mode over being infested with fake news during the presidential election. Schrader had been under the hood. A former member of its now-defunct trending-news team, he monitored a feed of stories gaining traction on Facebook, vetted them for accuracy (or at least truth) and wrote a headline for Facebook’s public trending-news feed. \nBut a funny thing happened in August: Facebook fired its human trending-news curators and replaced them with an algorithm . Almost instantly, the social network was awash in false news stories that many users were treating as credible and sharing on their timelines. The 2016 election, polarizing as it was, fed the fake-news beast. Advertisement \n“Facebook has a fake-news problem, and I don’t believe that they recognize it,” said Schrader. “I think they’re in denial of the fact, but it’s a pervasive problem and they need to address it.” \nWith the dust still settling around the election — and many voters feeling burned by misinformation — the social network has responded by cutting publishers of false news reports off from its display ad network . And yet, at the same time, CEO Mark Zuckerberg has expressed reluctance in having Facebook play a more active role in weeding out fake news stories, saying that Facebook must be “extremely cautious about becoming arbiters of truth ourselves.” \nFor our latest Digiday Confessions, we talked with Schrader, who worked at Facebook for four months until July 2016, and another member of the defunct trending-news team who worked on the team in 2015 and chose to remain anonymous. \n‘Extremely disappointing’ Over the course of the year, false stories such as Megyn Kelly being fired from Fox News and the pope endorsing Donald Trump made rounds on Facebook, where users generally assumed them to be accurate. \nSchrader said that the fact that their trending section put out fake stories from disreputable publications on multiple occasions was “concerning.” \n“It’s incredible how much fake shit was pushed out this year and propagated on Facebook without any vetting,” the second source said. “It’s extremely disappointing; it’s like this petri dish of bullshit.” \nBoth recalled routine instances of fake stories surfacing in the trending tool for them to review and write headlines and summaries for. Once fact-checked, it would be their job to suppress it. There was once a video of an eagle snatching up a kid and flying away with it that was trending, for example, that later turned out to be false. \n“It happened almost daily,” said Schrader. \n‘Journalists are a great safeguard’ Both said that while it is understandable that Facebook may want to be careful about not appearing partisan, its sheer size and influence necessitates that it take the problem seriously. \n“There’s this Silicon Valley ‘free market’ mindset, where they don’t want to be nannies to their users,” said the anonymous source. “But they have 1.8 billion users, and a lot of those people use their site to get their news — and it can be extremely harmful to the way some people think if it is full of such content.” \nBoth felt that the journalists who made up part of the company’s former trending-news team served a very important function and that the problem has gotten worse since the team was disbanded. \n“The trending-news team was definitely the barrier that kept the fake news from trending, and that’s because we had the ability to fact-check in a way that an algorithm can’t and the news judgment to know what is real and what isn’t,” said Schrader. \n“I think journalists were a great safeguard against fake news,” said the second source. “From a tech standpoint, it was probably pretty inefficient since it takes time to summarize and fact-check, but at least they were monitoring stories and nixing inaccurate ones.” \n‘A media company in denial’ According to a survey by the Pew Research Center and the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation, 44 percent of U.S. adults said that they got news from Facebook in 2016. That’s greater than other news-focused social media sites like Twitter (9 percent) or Reddit (2 percent), and also other traditional media organizations. \n“Facebook is totally a media company, and they’ve totally been in denial this whole time,” said Schrader. “Just because you don’t identify as a media company, doesn’t mean that you aren’t one.” \nFurther, so many of its products are catered to journalists; just take Facebook Live, for instance. “It is a news tool; they are paying journalists to create content,” he said. “That is a news publisher.” \n“The fact that they have the trending section and allow publishers to put out posts puts them squarely in that region of a news company,” said the second source. “If they didn’t have that, then, yes, they can’t censor their users for sharing false information. But when you start featuring content on the trending tab, that’s when you need to take some responsibility.” \nFor Schrader, the correct response by Facebook would be, first and foremost, to acknowledge, that there is a fake-news problem. And then, it could work with news publishers to find a way to combat it — perhaps by coming up with some sort of a review tool for news before it’s published or by letting consumers report articles for being factually incorrect. \n“They need to pull senior editors from major publications to create a newsroom, and they need to have them overseeing the different products: news feed, trending news, events, any product that has an editorial function,” he said.",

      "text": "Share \nYou've been writing fake news for a while now - you're kind of like the OG Facebook news hoaxer. Well, I'd call it hoaxing or fake news. You'd call it parody or satire. How is that scene different now than it was three or five years ago? Why did something like your story about Obama invalidating the election results (almost 250,000 Facebook shares, as of this writing) go so viral? \nHonestly, people are definitely dumber. They just keep passing stuff around. Nobody fact-checks anything anymore - I mean, that's how Trump got elected. He just said whatever he wanted, and people believed everything, and when the things he said turned out not to be true, people didn't care because they'd already accepted it. It's real scary. I've never seen anything like it. \nYou mentioned Trump, and you've probably heard the argument, or the concern, that fake news somehow helped him get elected. What do you make of that? \nMy sites were picked up by Trump supporters all the time. I think Trump is in the White House because of me. His followers don't fact-check anything - they'll post everything, believe anything. His campaign manager posted my story about a protester getting paid $3,500 as fact. Like, I made that up. I posted a fake ad on Craigslist. \nWhy? I mean - why would you even write that? \nJust 'cause his supporters were under the belief that people were getting paid to protest at their rallies, and that's just insane. I've gone to Trump protests - trust me, no one needs to get paid to protest Trump. I just wanted to make fun of that insane belief, but it took off. They actually believed it. \nYou think you personally helped elect Trump? \nI don't know. I don't know if I did or not. I don't know. I don't know. \nI guess I'm curious, if you believed you might be having an unfair impact on the election - especially if that impact went against your own political beliefs - why didn't you stop? Why keep writing? \nI didn't think it was possible for him to get elected president. I thought I was messing with the campaign, maybe I wasn't messing them up as much as I wanted - but I never thought he'd actually get elected. I didn't even think about it. In hindsight, everyone should've seen this coming - everyone assumed Hillary (Clinton) would just get in. But she didn't, and Trump is president. \nSpeaking of Clinton - did you target fake news at her supporters? Or Gary Johnson's, for that matter? (Horner's Facebook picture shows him at a rally for Johnson.) \nNo. I hate Trump. \nIs that it? You posted on Facebook a couple weeks ago that you had a lot of ideas for satirizing Clinton and other figures, but that \"no joke ... in doing this for six years, the people who clicked ads the most, like it's the cure for cancer, is right-wing Republicans.\" That makes it sound like you've found targeting conservatives is more profitable. \nYeah, it is. They don't fact-check. \nBut a Trump presidency is good for you from a business perspective, right? \nIt's great for anybody who does anything with satire - there's nothing you can't write about now that people won't believe. I can write the craziest thing about Trump, and people will believe it. I wrote a lot of crazy anti-Muslim stuff - like about Trump wanting to put badges on Muslims, or not allowing them in the airport, or making them stand in their own line - and people went along with it! \nFacebook and Google recently announced that they'd no longer let fake-news sites use their advertising platforms. I know you basically make your living from those services. How worried are you about this? \nThis whole Google AdSense thing is pretty scary. And all this Facebook stuff. I make most of my money from AdSense - like, you wouldn't believe how much money I make from it. Right now I make like $10,000 a month from AdSense. \nThinking about this less selfishly, though - it might be good if Facebook and Google took action, right? Because the effects you're describing are pretty scary. \nYeah, I mean - a lot of the sites people are talking about, they're just total BS sites. There's no creativity or purpose behind them. I'm glad they're getting rid of them. I don't like getting lumped in with Huzlers. I like getting lumped in with the Onion. The stuff I do - I spend more time on it. There's purpose and meaning behind it. I don't just write fake news just to write it. Comments FAQ \nPhilly.com comments are intended to be civil, friendly conversations.

      "text": "MIGUEL PALACIOS/COVER/GETTY IMAGES Like us on Facebook \nAt its heart, making a good cup of coffee is about extraction. The water has to be hot enough, and the beans ground at the right consistency , with both components at the right ratio, to create just the right flavor of sweet, sweet caffeine water. Coffee is made up of more than 1800 chemical components, so it’s a pretty complicated thing to study. \nWith an eye toward making the perfect cup, a group of mathematicians recently tried to come up with a mathematical model that can describe the various factors that influence the cup of coffee that comes out of the brewing process, as the BBC reports . The paper was published in the SIAM Journal on Applied Mathematics [ PDF ]. They admit that “defining what makes a good cup of coffee is a nontrivial matter and to some extent a matter of personal preference,” but attempted nonetheless to figure out how variations in the brewing process can change the taste of coffee. \n\"The really surprising thing to us is that there are really two processes by which coffee is extracted from grains,” co-author William Lee told the BBC. “There's a very quick process by which coffee's extracted from the surface of the grains. And then there's a slower tail-off where coffee comes out of the interior of the grains.\" \nThe researchers took into account the grind and porosity of the beans; the temperature and velocity of the water; and the concentration and surface area of the grounds, among other factors. The models they came up with could potentially be used to improve the way drip coffee makers work, though they may not mean much to the average French press user. For instance, whether the water comes through a single fluid stream or multiple jets changes the process. “For fluid delivery with a single jet, the evolution of the coffee bed shape is important, as a central cavity may form in the bed which shortens the path fluid has to travel through the bed to exit the filter,” ultimately influencing the brew process, they write. \nBut unless you're a mathematician or a coffee machine manufacturer, you're probably best just brewing your coffee the way you've always done—as long as you have a good grinder, of course. Otherwise, just go ahead and visit a shop .",

The 92MB over-the-air update is going out now to European Galaxy S7 edge (SM-G935F) owners, and other models are likely to follow soon. \nA message given to beta participants says that this update only includes the Facebook fix, but that further updates will be rolled out based on feedback from beta testers. \nUrgent version release due to force close issue when running Facebook. \nDear Customer \nUpdate provided today is a software that fixes the problem of closing Facebook app. \nNew Beta software that is going to reflect all opinions sent by Customers is being prepared. However, there were also some Customers who raised complaints about Facebook problem and so we are sharing version firstly to deal only with that problem. \nGalaxy Beta Program Team \nThe new build number (for the GS7 edge) is XXU1ZPKC. \nIf you manually flashed the earlier Nougat build using the ODIN tool, without joining Samsung's beta program, you'll probably need to wait for a full firmware package to become available and manually update to the new build. Right now it looks like official over-the-air beta updates are reserved for Samsung's limited pool of testers.",

      "title": "Facebook Clarifies Errors with Metrics - What it Means for Marketers",
      "text": "Earlier this week Facebook announced that it had found some of the metrics it's been providing to advertisers are inaccurate.\nSound familiar?\nThat’s because Facebook did the same thing a couple of months back, when it found some of the numbers it had been providing on video views were also wrong.\nSo what should we make of this? Does this mean more of Facebook’s metrics are incorrect and we just don't know it yet? Do you need to revise your strategy as a result of the clarified data.\nHere’s a full rundown of the cause and effect of each, including the September video update.\nAverage Duration of Video Viewed In September, Facebook clarified that they’d been reporting their Average Duration of Video Viewed metric wrong.\nFor some time - years in fact - Facebook had been using this calculation to provide this stat:\nTotal time spent watching / Total number of people who had played the video for three or more seconds\nThis means that all those people who were watching for less than three seconds were not being counted in the result, meaning the actual average duration of viewed content was lower than what was being reported.\nThe impact of this is hard to define, as it’s a case-by-case proposition, but some have suggested that the error increased the total duration of video viewed count by around 60%.\nUpon discovery of the error, Facebook put out a statement saying that they’d fixed it and reviewed their practices to ensure it doesn’t occur again.\n“We informed our partners and made sure to put a notice in the product itself so that anyone who went into their dashboard could understand our error. We have also reviewed our other video metrics on the dashboard and have found that this has no impact on video numbers we have shared in the past, such as time spent watching video or the number of video views. We want our clients to know that this miscalculation has not and will not going forward have an impact on billing or how media mix models value their Facebook video investments.”\nPage Insights – Organic Reach Facebook reported this week that it's uncovered a bug which meant that one of the dashboards on the Page Insights tab was displaying incorrect data.\nThe element in question is this one:\nThis is the only figure affected – Facebook says the reach on this tab was miscalculated, showing a sum of daily reach but not removing repeat visitors from the count.\nAs per Facebook :\n“The de-duplicated 7-day summary in the overview dashboard will be 33% lower on average and 28-day will be 55% lower. This bug has been live since May; we will be fixing this in the next few weeks. It does not affect paid reach.”\nPage Insights – Organic Reach Change In addition to the reach error, Facebook has also reported that they’re making an improvement to Page organic reach stats to better match how they calculate the same for paid content.\n“On Pages, we’ve historically defined reach as a person refreshing their News Feed and the post being placed in their feed. For paid ads reports, we’ve moved to a stricter definition that only counts reach once the post enters the person’s screen (“viewable impressions”).”\nWith this change, Facebook estimates that reported reach for Pages will be 20% lower on average – so if you see a sudden shift, this may be the cause. Facebook says they’ll provide an update to all Pages via a notification within your Insights tab when this change comes into effect.\nVideo – Measuring Completion As part of their efforts to improve the accuracy of their data, Facebook's been working with measurement group Moat to add an extra layer of third-party verification. Moat has been analyzing Facebook’s current system, and they uncovered another reporting error related to video completion rates.\nThe problem occurs when the video and audio tracks on a piece of content don’t match up – as noted by Facebook :\n“When partners upload their videos to Facebook, the full video length is recorded, but when the video delivers to people’s devices, the length of the video can sometimes be a fraction of a second shorter or longer.”\nBecause of this, Facebook was sometimes failing to count completed video views because the audio was longer than the video element – so the video stops while there's still more audio left. Whenever this happened, Facebook didn't register this as a 100% view, which it should have.\nFacebook estimates that this may result in a 35% increase in the count of “video watches to 100%”.\nInstant Articles – Time Spent Facebook also found an error in their reporting of average time spent per article on Instant Articles, with a calculation mistake leading to an over-reporting of this stat by around 7%-8%.\nFacebook says that they were incorrectly counting the “histogram of time spent”, instead of reflecting the total time spent reading an article divided by total views.\nAnalytics for Apps An additional error was uncovered in their reporting of referrals from apps.\nIn the Analytics for Apps dashboard, the “Referrals” tab displays all the posts produced by people via an app or website.\nThis data's supposed to be a reflection of clicks that went directly to an app or website, but Facebook found that they were also counting other clicks on those posts, including clicks to view photos or video.\n“For power users of this metric (top apps that look at this data in the dashboard most frequently), we found that referrals have been overstated by approximately 6% on average. Other measurements of referrals, such as those appearing in Facebook’s ads reporting tools, are unaffected.”\nInterest Lists – Follower Counts Back in 2012, Facebook introduced ‘ Interest Lists ’ to help people follow content they might be interest in but didn’t necessarily want flooding their News Feed.\nThis meant that you could create a list for, say, “Fiction Writers” and add publishers and authors to it, or a “Basketball” list with NBA players and official team accounts, which you could then check in on whenever you wanted.\nBut the feature has never really taken off. Facebook ran a test earlier this year with a replacement for interest lists, which provided topic-specific News Feeds , but we’ve not heard anything about it since, so it looks like that wasn’t a winner either.\nBecause of this, Facebook has also announced that they’re removing Interest Lists as an option – which is no big deal, given that you probably don’t use it, but it will also result a reduction in followers for some Pages and Profiles.\nThis is because whenever you or your Page was included on an Interest List, that counted as another follow – but also, if someone were to be following you from their profile and via an interest list, that got counted twice, so all of those additional follower numbers will now be removed.\nFacebook says that most profiles will see a drop in followers of less than 5%.\nImproving Accuracy So there’s quite a few things to get through – and, I guess, the bigger issue, and concern for Facebook, is that these errors now bring all of their other metrics into question. How can we rely on Facebook’s data given that they’ve got so much wrong? How long will it be till another report comes out revealing that their figures were off?\nReally, the best way to counter this is to cross-check all data with your own on-page metrics and Google Analytics stats. Most of the figures noted above will have little impact on the more common business goals – being click-throughs and subsequent conversions. You can still track all the Facebook referrals for these stats in other ways, and it’s important to do so to ensure that what you’re seeing on Facebook matches with the rest of your stats.\nOn Facebook’s side, they’re working to facilitate more third-party verification of their data to give marketers more peace of mind, while they’re also improving the accuracy of their naming structures (e.g. “view content” → “website view of content,” and “video views” → “3-second video views”) and updating their glossaries to ensure there’s more consistent explanations of their metrics across the various platforms.\nBut really, how big an impact these errors will have, and how much trust you put into Facebook’s data, is up to you. As noted, it’s important to cross-check where possible and ensure the data you’re seeing reflects the end results.",

      "text": "Photo: Juliana Barrett/Facebook More A nursing mom’s Facebook post went viral after airport security made a spectacle of her breast milk. Juliana Barrett recalls the screening officer “squishing [her breast milk] in his hands, holding it up and commenting on how many ounces it was.” “People were walking by and staring,” she wrote. The traveling mom had done her research; she knew she was allowed to bring prepackaged breast milk on a plane. But no amount of careful planning could prepare her for an insensitive, poorly trained staff member. In a now private Facebook post, Barrett shared her experience: \nIt started with the TSA guy yelling about “everything out of your pockets” to everyone. I held the cooler bag and told him what was inside. He told me to put it on the belt anyways. It went through the scanner and I watched it sit. Patiently, I waited for the TSA screener guy to grab it. He ignored it until I finally pointed it out. He grabbed it and after I told him what was inside, he asked me where my baby was because “I don’t think you can bring this on without your baby present.” Uhhh, what?! Why would I have all of this if my baby was with me?! \n\nI let him know I was traveling for work. He then opens the bag and proceeds to pull my cold breast milk bags out (ALL 21!). Squishing them in his hands, holding them up and commenting on how many ounces they are, people are walking by and staring. … I begin to tear up as he’s handling my son’s food and throwing them into a bin to be RESCANNED! He makes comments that he’s not sure I can bring all of it on the plane. \n\nFinally, a lady TSA agent comes over and tells him he doesn’t need to do that. She tells him I’m good to go. I’m dying. The milk is warming up. I still have six hours until I get home. … His touching my breast milk was uncomfortable, creepy, and upsetting. That’s such an intimate, private thing to me. I’d heard horror stories of milk being poured out. This is my son’s food. Let’s keep in touch! Follow Yahoo Beauty on Facebook , Twitter , Instagram , and Pinterest .",

      "text": "What Facebook's Atlas Means for Brands and Agencies \nWith that size audience and the data insights that Facebook has into its users, there was less need for Facebook to build an open advertising technology ecosystem. Instead it has focused on serving ads to its own properties and the Facebook Audience Network, which delivers ads to outside apps and websites based on Facebook's targeting data. \n\"The idea of ad serving itself has become super highly commoditized,\" a person familiar with Facebook's Atlas strategy said, speaking on condition of anonymity. \"And Facebook has so much to focus on with Facebook and Instagram, so why bother.\" \nThere will be a transition period for advertisers now using Atlas as a server to find a new provider, Mr. Johnson said. But it won't change for the the hundreds of marketers that rely on it for measurement, he said. \nFacebook hopes that it's still positioned to do some business even in an area that Google dominates because advertisers choosing DoubleClick as an ad server might want Facebook for the measurement piece. \nFacebook is credited with having the best data on people, whom it can often find on desktop browsers, as they use apps and on the mobile web. \nThe Atlas announcement, however, does come at an awkward time for the company. Facebook revealed this week that it had found instances where it provided bad numbers to brands and publishers using its analytics tools on the social network. \nThe glitches that led to those errors were not related to Atlas, Mr. Johnson said. The Atlas team spent part of the week reassuring clients that their numbers were not impacted. \nFacebook in January closed LiveRail , moving its clients to Facebook Audience Network over the summer. LiveRail was another ad tech component that did not work out for Facebook when it was looking to build a traditional model for the industry. \nWith LiveRail, an ad exchange focused on video, Facebook said it found too much fraudulent and low-quality traffic, and decided it wasn't worth maintaining.

      "title": "Facebook kills its Atlas ad server to focus on measurement tools for marketers",
      "text": "Facebook on Friday announced that it will be “winding down” its Atlas ad server because the company believes advertisers are more interested in metrics and insights. No specific timeline for the closure has been revealed, but it’s expected to take a few months to help existing customers transition away from the service.\nThings at Atlas weren’t exactly perfect, as there were reports that suggested the ad service had failed to live up to its promise, frustrating marketers. It wasn’t able to provide service to mobile devices or even power video ads, resulting in brands having to deploy multiple advertising technologies which adds friction and compounds costs.\nHowever, according to the program’s lead Erik Johnson, “a top request we hear from advertisers when it comes to measurement is ‘more’ — more capabilities, more features and more actionable insights.” Facebook has opted to put a more positive spin on this saying it’s the right thing to do…but is it?\nDamian Burns, the global head of sales for Atlas, told Business Insider : “Throughout its lifespan, the focus of Atlas has been very loud around its measurement capabilities and ad serving was the thinner end of the wedge, if you will. It’s a very logical progression. The measurement capabilities are powerful, increasingly so, and we are seeing a lot of traction there … all the measurement capabilities that are integral to the ad server are also available outside the ad server. You can do everything you are looking to do without it. You have pixels on pages and ads that enable us to do the same counting but also apply people-based measurement to all the ads that run.”\nAtlas relaunched in 2014 after the social networking company purchased it from aQuantive and Microsoft. It was intended to be a challenger to Google’s DoubleClick but with a different take on ad serving. The focus was more on what Facebook called “people-based marketing” where people, not cookies, were at the center of marketing decisions. Over the past 18 months, it’s said that more than 300 of the top advertisers used Atlas, including Airbnb and State Farm.\nThe move into measurement isn’t without some controversy, as Facebook has recently had a couple mea culpas in providing accurate data back to advertisers, including around video and ad views . But the company has since promised more transparency into its metrics even amid critics who argue there needs to be third-party validation.\n",

Our team will continue to closely vet all prospective publishers and monitor existing ones to ensure compliance.” \nHowever, Facebook’s policy clarification does not touch fake news content shared elsewhere on the site — i.e. fake news shared by individuals on their personal News Feeds. \nIn the immediate aftermath of the election, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg minimized the idea that fake news on his company’s platform had an impact on this campaign season. \n“To think it influenced the election in any way is a pretty crazy idea,” Zuckerberg said. \nIn a statement last week, Adam Mosseri, vice president of product management at Facebook, struck a different tone, and acknowledged that “there’s so much more” the company needs to do to fight the spread of misinformation on its platform. \nIn the final days of his presidency, President Obama has emerged as perhaps the most visible critic of the rise of misleading information on Facebook and other social media sites. \nIn a new profile of the president and his legacy published in The New Yorker, Mr. Obama said that today’s media landscape “means everything is true and nothing is true.” \n“An explanation of climate change from a Nobel Prize-winning physicist looks exactly the same on your Facebook page as the denial of climate change by somebody on the Koch brothers’ payroll,” he told The New Yorker’s David Remnick. “And the capacity to disseminate misinformation, wild conspiracy theories, to paint the opposition in wildly negative light without any rebuttal—that has accelerated in ways that much more sharply polarize the electorate and make it very difficult to have a common conversation.” © 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.

The first post was from the “Last American Patriots” Facebook page and read, “Over 620,000 white people died to free black slaves and still to this day not even 1 thank you.” \nThe second post was shared from a Facebook page titled “Donald Trump, the Political Movement.” It showed a picture of incoming first lady Melania Trump with the caption “fluent in Slovenian, English, French, Serbian and German” beside a picture of first lady Michelle Obama with the caption “fluent In ghetto,” Talladega’s Daily Home newspaper reported . \nThe TPD responded in a statement saying it would not tolerate such conduct by any employee, adding that it takes seriously its responsibility to treat every person equally. \nFor the police especially, they have to guarantee the rights of everyone, regardless of race, creed, gender, religion, etc. Any time someone makes a statement like that that is biased, insensitive or derogatory, that reflects negatively on the department and all agencies of the city. \nOur responsibility is to our residents, to provide service to everyone. That especially includes law enforcement. The community trusts them to provide a vital service fairly. If a comment or post reflects a level of bias that says they cannot provide that service fairly, then we have to act. Rate this story",

      "text": "November 5, 2016 There is no such thing as the Denver Guardian, despite that Facebook post you saw \nSince the students developed it in only 1 1/2 days (and have classes and schoolwork to worry about), they’ve released it as an “open-source project,” asking anyone with development experience to help improve it. The plugin is available for download to the public, but the demand was so great that their limited operation couldn’t handle it. \nIdeally, Goel said, Facebook would team up with a third-party developer such as FiB so that the company could control all news feed data but let the developers verify it so Facebook couldn’t be accused of “hidden agendas or biases.” \nThe sponsors of the hackathon included Facebook and other major technology companies, but neither Facebook nor Google has contacted the students about FiB. Both companies have said this week that they will take steps to address the spread of fake news. \nThis year’s presidential election has shown how the lines have blurred between fact and lies, with people profiting from the spread of fake news. More than 100 news sites that made up pro-Trump content have been traced to Macedonia, according to a BuzzFeed News investigation. The Washington Post interviewed Paul Horner, a prolific fake-news creator, who said: “I think Trump is in the White House because of me. His followers don’t fact-check anything — they’ll post everything, believe anything.” \nMelissa Zimdars, a communications professor at Merrimack College in North Andover, Massachusetts, said she’s seen a similar problem with students who cite questionable sources. So she created a list of fake, misleading or satirical sites as a reference, not as a direct response to the postelection fake news debate but to encourage students to be more media-literate by checking what they read against other sources. \nThe list, which she has continued to add to since she made it public earlier this week, has gone viral. She included tips for analyzing news sources: \n“Watch out if known/reputable news sites are not also reporting on the story. Sometimes lack of coverage is the result of corporate media bias and other factors, but there should typically be more than one source reporting on a topic or event. \n“If the story makes you REALLY ANGRY it’s probably a good idea to keep reading about the topic via other sources to make sure the story you read wasn’t purposefully trying to make you angry (with potentially misleading or false information) in order to generate shares and ad revenue.” \nZimdars said people have grown so distrustful of institutional media that they turn to alternative sources. A recent Pew Research Center survey found that only 18 percent of people have a lot of trust in national news organizations; nearly 75 percent said news organizations are biased. \nIt doesn’t help, Zimdars said, that news media, to be profitable, rely on “click-bait” headlines that are sometimes indistinguishable from the fake stories. \nPaul Mihailidis, who teaches media literacy at Emerson College in Boston had a different take. \n“I don’t think a lot of people didn’t know; I think they didn’t care. They saw it as a way to advocate,” Mihailidis said. “The more they could spread rumors, or could advocate for their value system or candidate, that took precedent over them not knowing. A large portion of them didn’t stop to critique the information. One of the things that has happened is people are scrolling though [Facebook] and the notion of deep reading is being replaced by deep monitoring. They see a catchy headline, and the default is to share.” \nAnd the way people consume news, by a flick of the thumb on a smartphone, means they are less likely to cross-check what they’re reading against other sources. \nThat’s where the plugin tool presents a simple solution. \n“A few days back, I read an article telling people they can drill a jack in the iPhone7 and have an earphone plug, and people started doing it and ruining their phones,” De said. “We know we can search on Google and research it, but if you have five minutes and you’re just scrolling through Facebook, you don’t have time to go verify it.” Tags:",

      "text": "(Before It's News)\nIf by now you haven’t figured out that Facebook and Google are in cahoots with the corrupt government, then I feel for you, but for those who are well aware of the issues it’s high time you switched over to Seen.life . It is a website that is similar to Facebook but without all the censorship crap.\nDoes anyone else remember how we had to listen Barack Obama whine and cry daily for the first four years of his presidency about how he “inherited” a horrible economy from President Bush? It’s hard to forget I know, because Obama never shut up about it, but yet that is exactly what is Barack Obama is deliberately doing to President-Elect Trump! By allowing the rioting and the lawlessness to continue unabated, come Inauguration Day, Trump will inherit a nation on fire from the moment he assumes office.\nIn the first video below, I review in detail why it’s way too early to be popping Champagne bottles and celebrating last week’s historic victory. There are far too many political land minds between now and Inauguration Day that could set off a chain reaction in this country of incomprehensible proportions, and the Community Agitator-In-Chief is playing his hand perfectly so far. Reviewing the evidence, all of which is public information, I make the case that right now Obama has the upper hand while Trump is busy with his transition team. It’s as plain as day, for anyone willing to look!\nI also cover the nonsense we keep hearing from the “protestors” that the “will of the people” was expressed in the popular vote, which Hillary didn’t even win when you take out 3 million illegal aliens caught voting, and 4 million dead people who voted. Anyone who is buying into that level of utter foolishness, is hopelessly misinformed, and isn’t worth wasting your time with.\nThe “will of the American people” has been made abundantly clear by the fact that Democrats have lost 60 House seats since 2010, lost 242 state legislative seats, 30 state legislative chambers have completely switched from Democrat to Republican, and 2/3 of the states now have Republican Governors. Republicans haven’t had margins like this since 1929, so the “protestors” need to shut up about “the will of the people.” They people have INDEED spoken!\nIn the second video, Police Sgt. Demetrick Pennie and attorney Larry Klayman, who are both suing President Obama and Black Lives Matter, appeared on Fox News to weigh in on the dangers of the anti-Trump riots, and Obama’s response to them, or lack there of. When asked if the violence is going to continue, attorney Larry Klayman echoes what I’ve been saying for months. As President, it’s Obama’s job to come out, and to enforce the rule of law. That was the oath he took as President of the United States.\nBecause what are taking place around the country are not “protests,” or “demonstrations,” but acts of domestic terror, or riots, and Obama has a sworn duty to put an end to them, by whatever lawful means necessary. As Larry Klayman explains, Obama will never do that. Why not? Because what is happening is precisely what Obama wants to happen.\nSUBSCRIBE TO THE TOP STORIES OF THE WEEK IN THE NEWSLETTER HERE\nWWW.THELASTGREATSTAND.COM\nFOR MORE NEWS BY VOICE OF REASON CLICK HERE!\nMichael Snyder Writes:\nDonald Trump is not the president yet, and Barack Obama could still do an extraordinary amount of damage during his last two months in the White House. Prior to the election, I described the period of time ending on January 20th as “the danger zone”, and my outlook has not changed just because Donald Trump was victorious on election night. As you will see, the next two months are an absolutely critical time, and if we can get through January 20th without something major happening perhaps we can breathe a little bit easier (at least for a while). On the other hand, the events of the next two months could easily plunge this country into a period of unprecedented chaos. A lot of people are feeling really good about things right now because of Trump’s victory, but now is definitely not a time to relax and let down our guard.\nAnd the truth is that Donald Trump has not even won the presidency yet. As I detailed shortly before election night , the next president will not be determined until December 19th when the Electoral College meets.\nOn Monday, December 19th the members of the Electoral College will gather in all 50 state capitals to cast their votes for president. It is then, and only then, that the next president of the United States will be elected.\nThroughout our history, electors have followed the will of the people more than 99 perfect of the time, but there have been “faithless electors” before, and if Democrats can get enough of them to switch sides in December it is still possible (though not probable) that Hillary Clinton could win the election.\nBE SURE TO CHECK THELASTGREATSTAND.COM FOR SURVIVAL GEAR!\nFREE DETAILED GUIDE TO SURVIVING ECONOMIC COLLAPSE OR MARTIAL LAW HERE\nIn the video below, Police Sgt. Demetrick Pennie explains what the majority of the mainstream media refuses to; he explains that a huge percentage of those “protesting” are being paid to agitate, by none other than George Soros, the same man who said before the election that Western society must fall, before One World Government can emerge. Pennie confirms what many of us already know, which is that far too many of the people out “protesting,” don’t even know why they’e out there. Because of the sheer number of “protestors,” and their propensity for violence, he also explains how tactically police are too outnumbered to engage the “protestors” safely, putting the general public at risk.\nLast week, most of the country waged a peaceful revolution in the ballot box, but it’s time the American people Wake Up to the reality that the far-left has no plans to be anything even remotely peaceful. Racial riots are already breaking out in cities all over the country, and as you’ll learn in the video below, despite knowing the First Amendment right to “ peaceably assemble “ does NOT cover rioting, setting fires, property damage, or hurting people, Obama has gone as far as to compliment the “protestors” anyway, and encouraged their right to “protest.”\nEven more scary, is that on Inauguration Day, groups like Black Lives matter plan to lead one of the biggest political protests in United States history on the capital. They have already put up Facebook pages , websites , and the hashtag “#DisruptJ20″ is being widely used all over social media. Social media, with the full cooperation of Barack Obama, are allowing their platforms to be used for the organization and recruitment of acts of domestic terror, and to do so with impunity.\nJust so there is no question that we’re dealing with domestic terror, as a reminder, Black’s Law Dictionary gives the “legal” definition of terrorism as:\n“The use of force or threats of violence to intimidate or cause panic, esp. as a means of affecting political conduct.”\nWe’re dealing with domestic terrorists being allowed to run free. End of story.\nINSTAGRAM | FACEBOOK | GOOGLE+ | TWITTER | PINTEREST | STUMBLE UPON | TUMBLR\nWWW.THELASTGREATSTAND.COM\nCHECK OUT THE NEW GOOGLE+ PAGE!\nOne petition that is asking electors to switch their votes has already been signed by more than 4 million people. The petition claims that Donald Trump is “unfit to serve” as president, and that since Hillary Clinton won the popular vote by a wide margin she should be elected president instead. The following comes from a USA Today article entitled “ Could the Electoral College elect Hillary Clinton instead of Donald Trump? “…\nA Change.org petition, now signed by more than 4.3 million people, encourages members of the Electoral College to cast their votes for Hillary Clinton when the college meets on Dec. 19. The petition argues that Donald Trump is “unfit to serve” and that “Secretary Clinton WON THE POPULAR VOTE and should be President.”\n“If they all vote the way their states voted, Donald Trump will win,” the petition states. “However, they can vote for Hillary Clinton if they choose. Even in states where that is not allowed, their vote would still be counted, they would simply pay a small fine – which we can be sure Clinton supporters will be glad to pay! We are calling on the Electors to ignore their states’ votes and cast their ballots for Secretary Clinton.”\nPersonally, I don’t believe that this is going to happen. They may be able to flip a few electors, but the gap in electoral votes is almost certainly too wide for the Democrats to overcome.\nHowever, that is not the only concern we are facing. Ever since his victory on November 8th, there have been a multitude of violent threats against Donald Trump and his family. And without a doubt, there are a lot of very powerful people that would be very interested in finding a way to keep Donald Trump from getting to Inauguration Day. So let us pray for his safety and for the safety of his family.\nIf Donald Trump were to be incapacitated after he wins the Electoral College vote on December 19th, Mike Pence would take his place.\nBut if something were to happen to him before December 19th, his electors would be free to vote for another candidate – including Hillary Clinton.\nIf everything goes smoothly and Donald Trump successfully makes it to Inauguration Day, he could be facing one of the biggest political protests in United States history.\nIn an article for The Most Important News , I showed that the far left is calling for thousands upon thousands of protesters to descend upon Washington D.C. on January 20th in order to disrupt the Inauguration festivities as much as possible.\nThis giant protest is being organized by the usual suspects, and they have already put up Facebook pages , websites , and the hashtag “#DisruptJ20″ is being widely used all over social media.\nTraditionally Inauguration Day is a day of joy and celebration, but the far left seems intent on transforming it into a massive riot.\nLet us hope that they are not successful.\nBE SURE TO CHECK THELASTGREATSTAND.COM FOR SURVIVAL GEAR!\nFREE DETAILED GUIDE TO SURVIVING ECONOMIC COLLAPSE OR MARTIAL LAW HERE\nAnother reason why we will be in “the danger zone” over the next two months is because of what Barack Obama may choose to do at the United Nations.\nNow that it looks like Donald Trump is going to be our next president, the international pressure on Barack Obama to do something at the United Nations regarding the Israeli-Palestinian conflict before the end of his term has become even more intense.\nAnd this is something that Trump and his advisers are actively concerned about. In fact, I came across an article earlier today that discussed the fact that the Trump team is warning Obama “against making moves on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in his last months in office” …\nSaying that pushing agendas “contrary to the president-elect’s position” would not be in the “spirit of the transition”, Trump national security advisor for Donald Trump last week warned the Obama administration against making moves on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in his last months in office.\n“On big, transformative issues where President Obama and President-elect Trump are not in alignment, I don’t think it’s in keeping with the spirit of the transition…to try to push through agenda items that are contrary to the president-elect’s positions,” the advisor told Politico .\nSpecifically, the concern is that Obama may decide to support a UN Security Council resolution that would officially recognize a Palestinian state, set the parameters for a “two state solution”, and establish East Jerusalem as the capital for the new Palestinian state.\nJust a few weeks ago, an article in the Wall Street Journal entitled “ Obama’s Israel Surprise? ” reported that this is one of the options that the Obama administration is strongly considering right now. A UN Security Council resolution would be legally binding on both Israel and the Palestinians, and it would be something that President Trump would not be able to undo.\nThe rest of the UN Security Council is eager to support such a resolution, and so the decision about whether this resolution is going to happen or not sits in the hands of Barack Obama, and at this moment we do not know what he is going to do. The following comes from an article by Leo Hohmann …\nThe Wall Street Journal reported one week before Tuesday’s election that Obama had requested his aides provide him with a list of options to deal with the decades-old Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\nIsraeli diplomats, according to the WSJ story, are preparing for the possibility that a lame-duck President Obama “may try to force a diplomatic resolution for Israel and the Palestinians at the United Nations.”\nThe president is presumably now reviewing those options, which number about half a dozen.\nHe may be preparing to recognize a Palestinian state at the U.N. before he leaves office , WSJ reported.\nIf Barack Obama decides to divide the land of Israel at the United Nations, it will be the worst decision of his entire presidency. I have warned repeatedly that all hell will break loose in America if it happens, and it will also mean that many of the events that I warn about in my latest book are much closer than many had been anticipating.\nBut if we can get to January 20th and the land of Israel has not been divided yet, we may be able to rest easy for at least a little while, because Trump has already said that he would not support a UN Security Council resolution that forces a solution on the Israelis and Palestinians.\nWhen politicians are going to do something that they know people won’t like, they tend to try to sneak it through around the holidays when a lot of people aren’t paying attention. For example, yesterday I discussed how the legislation that created the Federal Reserve was rushed through Congress right before Christmas in 1913 .\nSo keep an eye on the period around Thanksgiving and the period around Christmas. If Barack Obama is going to stab Israel in the back, it may happen during one of those times.\nMy hope is that we can get through January 20th without anything going seriously wrong. If that happens, I know that I will be very thankful.\nAnd as I detailed in a previous article , Donald Trump will be 70 years, 7 months and 7 days old on his first full day in office on January 21st, and that will happen in year 5777 on the Hebrew calendar.\nCould that be a sign of better things ahead as many believe?\nOr will the next two months set off a chain of events that will be absolutely disastrous for this nation?\nI believe that this is an absolutely critical moment in our history, and let us hope that our leaders make the right decisions.\nBE SURE TO CHECK THELASTGREATSTAND.COM FOR SURVIVAL GEAR!\nFREE DETAILED GUIDE TO SURVIVING ECONOMIC COLLAPSE OR MARTIAL LAW HERE\nFOR MORE ON THE CHAOS COMING FROM THE 2016 ELECTION:\nTrump Supporters Have a Plan To Unite and Bring CNN to its Knees (Video)\nSorry Protestors: Looks Like Hillary Got Pummeled in the Popular Vote Too (Video)\nWhat is Obama Doing to Stop Planned BLM Chaos, Rioting, and Violence?

      "text": "For all its talk of a more connected world, Facebook has a tendency to silo us—its users—into feedback loops, those spheres of information where we're rarely subjected to views that differ from our own.\nNever was this phenomenon more pronounced than in the months leading up to the 2016 election, when it sometimes seemed as if people were living in entirely different, ideology-driven realities.\nThis interactive tool using analysis from the Wall Street Journal does a good job of illustrating how people with different viewpoints might inhabit completely different media worlds.\nBut you don't have to submit entirely to Facebook's take on the news. Below are some ways to hack your feed for a more well-rounded online experience.\nAdjusting your feed The bad news: Facebook’s proprietary news algorithm is an unpredictable black-box. The good news: There are ways to adjust your settings so that you see more of certain types of posts or sources than others.\nFacebook's \"News Feed preferences\" let you to set which accounts' posts you see as soon as you log in.\nThe tab can be found under the arrow in the righthand corner of your homepage.\nPut together a handful of well-rounded news sources to get a dose of different opinions at the top of your page.\nAds might seem like an irrelevant factor in the news you see, but oftentimes publishers will boost posts by promoting them among users whose interests line up with those of their prospective audience. Facebook's \" Ad Preferences \" control panel gives you a good idea of what ads you can expect to see based on your interests and lets you adjust those interests accordingly.\nTo access this tool, click on the arrow in the righthand corner of the desktop page, scroll down to \"settings,\" click \"ads\" in the lefthand column of that page and go to the row that says \"manage the preferences we use to show you ads.\"\nThe panel also gives a sense of Facebook's best guess of your ideological orientation. Remember that even if you don't spend a lot of time on the site, Facebook has ways of following you around the web with trackers and cookies, so its profile of your perceived interests might still be extensive.\nIt's worth noting that Facebook's been around a while and these interest pages tend to accumulate on your profile. Sometimes innocuous interest pages even adopt odd political beliefs that they broadcast out to followers.\nWhen I went through my preferences, I unchecked lots of pages I had subscribed to years ago and since forgotten about.\nWhen I went through my preferences, I unchecked lots of pages I had subscribed to years ago and since forgotten about.\nFollowing a well-rounded set of voices Playing with your News Feed settings can only get you so far. The only real way to ensure an ideologically diverse feed is a good working knowledge of the legitimate sources on all sides. Here's a starter list for some intelligent opinionated outlets.\nConservative-leaning prestige media\nThe National Review — Long recognized as a leading voice in intelligent conservatism, the William Buckley-founded magazine tends to hold a lot of weight in right-wing circles. Like most legacy conservative outlets, the Review was outspoken in its opposition to Donald Trump's candidacy.\nThe Weekly Standard — Bill Kristol's weekly magazine features an array of neoconservative viewpoints and informed takes from right-leaning Washington think tanks.\nThe American Conservative — The bi-monthly magazine is supposed to be a bastion of \"true conservatism\" and doesn't hesitate to call out Republican party views when it disagrees.\nLiberal-leaning prestige media\nThe New Yorker — While not explicitly liberal, The New Yorker’s editorial board leans left on most contemporary issues. Widely considered one of America’s best magazines, look to it for in-depth reporting, unique commentary and some humor — but watch out for fake headlines from uninspired satirist Andy Borowitz.\nThe Nation — The oldest continuously running weekly magazine in the United States, The Nation can be reliably counted on to provide a thoughtful liberal point of view.\nMother Jones — On top of some great investigative reporting, the San Francisco-based magazine provides incisive liberal punditry.\nConservative new media\nIndependent Journal Review —IJR seems to aspire to be a sort of BuzzFeed for the right with a heavy emphasis on social media and a bloggy tone.\nHeat Street —Rupert Murdoch’s answer to dominant conservative blogs, Heat Street brings a new media mindset to conservatism that’s geared towards a young, digitally in-tune audience.\nDaily Caller — The Tucker Carlson-founded blog looks at politics, culture, entertainment and other topics through a conservative lens.\nLiberal new media\nSalon — Salon was one of the early pioneers of online news, and the staunchly progressive site has a reputation as a launching pad for respected lefty voices like Glenn Greenwald and Joan Walsh.\nAlterNet — Another web pioneer, AlterNet is known for its liberal activism and policy critiques. It's syndication service has also made it a hub for content from liberal outlets of all stripes.\nTalking Points Memo — Run by respected liberal pundit Josh Marshall, the progressive blog helps set the agenda for liberal thought.\nLibertarian media\nReason — The decades-old magazine is widely seen as the publication of record for libertarian thinking.\nSocialist media\nJacobin — For anyone looking for voices even further to the left, Jacobin offers unabashedly socialist perspectives on contemporary events.\nInternational perspective\nAl Jazeera — It may be a state-run outlet for the Qatari government, but Al Jazeera has consistently proven it's committed to clear-headed thinking and in-depth reporting on issues facing the Middle East. It's a good go-to source for opinions and angles you might not be able to find in Western media.\nThe Economist — The vaunted British magazine features bold reporting-backed commentary on foreign affairs all over the world that might get little attention in the U.S. press.\nDer Spiegel (International edition) — One of Europe's biggest news weeklies, Der Spiegel offers an English-language international edition that gives readers a comprehensive window into continental politics.\nDig Deeper\nPro Publica — The Pulitzer prize-winning nonprofit is known for its in-depth investigative journalism, invaluable explainers and informative databases that demonstrate the tangles of interests at play in everyday institutions.\nNews Deeply — The media organization encompasses a collection of specialized sites dig deep on important issues. Syria Deeply, which traces the ongoing civil war in the country, is particularly well-regarded.\nThe Marshall Project — The investigative outlet — another Pulitzer winner — delves into criminal justice and law enforcement issues. It's editorial operation is headed by former New York Times executive editor Bill Keller.\nOutside the media-sphere\nMedium — Medium's Facebook page highlights the best and most popular posts from the blogging platform. It's a good place to look for perspectives that might fall outside the traditional media bubble.\nStoryCorps — StoryCorps is an independent nonprofit project that collects audio accounts of experiences from a diverse array of Americans.\nIndividual media figures\nMost prominent journalist frequently update their followers with news and links from their own perspective as well as insight into their work. Look for names connected with reputable organizations or other well-regarded personalities.\nWhat to avoid Any accounts that share fake news\nWhile thousands of people fall for hoax stories every day, it only takes a few minutes to check for the telltale signs of a bogus article.\nCheck the URL: Oftentimes, fake news sites will try to fool you with a site address that’s almost identical to that of a trusted news source — abcnews.com.co , for instance, is a real operating example of a scam news hub.\nBe wary of hyperbolic headlines: Any article headers with lots of caps, breathless adjectives or a shouty tone should immediately raise suspicions\nWatch out for common formulas: Many fake news writers rely on the same provocative set-up again and again. \" X celebrity is moving to [your hometown] \" is a common one for example. A quick Snopes search can easily debunk these.\nActually skim the article: Many fake articles count on the fact that most people don’t read beyond the headline and pad the text with complete gibberish. The text in the screenshot below, taken from a fake post about Barack Obama banning the pledge of allegiance, should be a dead giveaway. But this article racked up nearly 50,000 views and more than 700 comments — the vast majority seemingly unaware of its falsehood.\nImage: abcnews.com.co, screenshot\nQuestionable sources Breitbart — The website has essentially become a mouthpiece for Trump's campaign and now soon-to-be administration. Its executive chairman, Steve Bannon, is now Trump's chief strategist. The site has been known to pump oxygen into right-wing conspiracy theories and features a tag for \"Black Crime.\"\nRussia Today — Friendliness between the Trump camp and Russia's government has turned this Kremlin-controlled news service into a shill outlet for the president-elect. Aside from that, it regularly spouts Moscow-endorsed propaganda.\nInfowars — This one should go without saying, but considering how chummy site proprietor Alex Jones is with our president-elect, it's worth mentioning. Jones espouses several insane conspiracy theories; he believes 9/11 was an inside job, the Sandy Hook shooting was faked and Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton are literal demons, among other things.\nThe Gateway Pundit — Don't be fooled by the wonky-sounding name. This right-wing site has seemingly no qualms about running with erroneous information. Some greatest hits include a credulously outraged post over an obvious prank tweet about destroying ballots and a host of articles feeding the inane \" spirit cooking \" debacle.",

      "text": "Follow CBSDFW.COM: Facebook | Twitter \nDALLAS (CBSDFW.COM/AP) – A state judge has ruled a man mentally competent to be executed Dec. 7 for fatally shooting his two young daughters more than 15 years ago in Dallas while their mother, his ex-wife, listened helplessly over the phone. \nState District Judge Robert Burns ruled Friday after a two-day hearing earlier this week for 61-year-old John David Battaglia. \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has declared that a prisoner can be executed if he or she is aware the death penalty is set to be carried out and has a rational understanding of why. \nThree psychologists testified the former accountant doesn’t understand why he’s scheduled to die. A fourth said Battaglia is faking his delusions. \nA federal appeals court stopped Battaglia’s scheduled lethal injection March 30 so the competency questions could be reviewed. \nThree psychologists testified that Battaglia is delusional and should not be executed. But another told the judge Battaglia is putting on an act and had been fully cooperative when he needed to be. \nAs far as the information presented to the court, former Dallas County prosecutor Toby Shook said earlier in the week he thought the state may have the inside edge. \n“One expert gave testimony that he believes he’s malingering, that he’s faking mental illness. Also, the state produced evidence that the defendant had looked up how to become incompetent.” \nIt was 2001 when Battaglia shot and killed Faith and Liberty, his 9- and 6-year-old daughters, in his Deep Ellum apartment . \nHe had picked up the children from his ex-wife in the parking lot of a shopping center for a court-ordered and scheduled visit. Battaglia was under a court order to stay away from his ex-wife’s Highland Park home. \nNot long after the girls were given to Battaglia, he got his former wife, Mary Jean Pearle, on the phone. “Why do you want daddy to go to jail,” one of the girls reportedly said to Pearle over the phone. Seconds later, Pearle heard one of the children say “No, no, daddy,” then gunshots. \n(©2016 CBS Local Media, a division of CBS Radio Inc. All Rights Reserved.

      "text": "Obama won't stop Donald Trump protesters \nA Texas television reporter is out of a job after she criticized President Obama and praised President-elect Donald Trump on her personal Facebook page — claiming the country went “downhill” under the outgoing commander-in-chief. \nScarlett Fakhar said she was recently canned from her local news gig at Fox in Houston for posting last week that she was “happy and relieved” over Trump’s unexpected White House win. \nFakhar had said in the post, which has since been deleted, that Obama made the “entire county hate one another” and claimed God “had a hand” in the election. She also said she could “barely sleep from how happy and relieved she was” after Trump’s victory over Hillary Clinton. \n“Fox 26 Houston fired me today for expressing my conservative views on my private Facebook page,” Fakhar posted Thursday . “That is all I will say for you. But I want you to know how much your support has gotten me through this. God bless you all.” \nA spokesperson for KRIV confirmed to The Post that Fakhar, 25, was no longer with the station, but declined further comment. \nFakhar, who is originally from Wilmington, Delaware, graduated from Elon University in North Carolina with a degree in broadcast journalism, according to a biography on her Facebook page. Before joining the station last year, she worked at television stations in Austin and Lubbock, as well as internships at “NBC Nightly News” with Brian Williams in New York and at KTRK-TV in Houston. \nAfter posting the message announcing her termination, Fakhar wrote a message claiming that FOX 26 was trying to get her to take down her “fan page” from Facebook. \nFakhar also singled out the “liberal” Houston Chronicle, claiming the newspaper wrongfully reported that she criticized African-Americans, a reference to Fakhar’s original problematic post that stated the “number of African Americans killed one another far outweighs the number of them being killed by whites.” \n“The media has made this a RACE issue when in reality the matter boils down to a difference in political philosophy,” Fakhar wrote Thursday. “As a multiracial person myself, I never have been or never will be racist. I simply stated the fact that the media continues to misrepresent the factual realities that there is NO more white on black crime than there is black on black crime.” \nFakhar’s post did not elaborate on her ethnicity. \nShe previously apologized on her personal Facebook page for making her “personal views” public after the election, saying it was “wholly inappropriate.” That post has also been deleted from her page, the Dallas Morning News reported . \nMessages seeking additional comment from Fakhar were not immediately returned Friday. \nA review of Fakhar’s Twitter feed shows several of her most recent stories, including an exclusive on a student who said he was attacked by classmates for voting for Trump in a mock election. She also called out what she claimed to be “media bias” in October when CNN’s Christopher Cuomo referenced Joseph McCarthy in connection to WikiLeaks disclosures that reporters at a number of outlets, including CNN, met in secret and coordinated with Clinton’s campaign.

      "text": "print \nPaul Sawers / VentureBeat \nThe top four messaging apps — Facebook's Messenger, WhatsApp, WeChat, and Viber — now claim nearly 3 billion monthly active users combined, n arrowly outnumbering the combined active users on the world's four largest social networks, including Facebook. \nThese numbers have caught the attention of a wide range of businesses, publishers among them. N ews industry leaders including the Wall Street Journal, The Economist, and the BBC are establishing a presence on a number of chat apps in an effort to be out front and build an audience on the latest platforms where people are consuming content. These early adopters are experimenting to learn which chat apps work for their audience and how they can leverage chat for the distribution of digital content, including articles, images, surveys, and video. \nIn a new report from BI Intelligence, we look at the appeal of mobile messaging apps for publishers and how they're becoming a dominant platform for media consumption. We compare the leading chat platforms, including WhatsApp, WeChat, Facebook's Messenger, and Viber, and what features publishers should know about when thinking about how they might leverage these properties. We also look at strategies for content distribution across chat apps and finally spotlight some of the challenges that publishers may encounter as they begin to dip their toes into content distribution via messaging apps. \nHere are some of the key takeaways: There are dozens of messaging platforms, each with distinct user demographics and features, and these differences will determine which apps a publisher should try and what type of content is most fitting. Publishers like The Wall Street Journal, The Economist, and the BBC are experimenting to learn which chat apps work for their audience and how they can leverage chat for the distribution of digital content, including articles, images, surveys, and video. Chat apps are especially appealing to publishers because they allow these brands to tap into users' \"dark social\" activity. Dark social traffic stems from people sharing content privately through IM programs, messaging apps, and email, among other means. Because chat apps were once primarily used for peer-to-peer communications, publishers have an opportunity to reach audiences on these platforms through a more conversational exchange. \nIn full, the report: Breaks down the pros and cons of each major messaging app. Explains the different ways publishers can distribute content on messaging apps. Highlights the differences between native and linked content. Looks at the potential barriers that could limit chat apps' utility for publishers. \nInterested in getting the full report?

      "text": "print \nFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg. AP Photo/Pablo Martinez Monsivais \nSAN FRANCISCO — Mark Zuckerberg published a Facebook post late Friday outlining some of the steps the social network is taking to deal with its massive fake news problem . \nThe Facebook CEO is apparently looking to show that the site is taking the problem seriously after he initially appeared to dismiss concerns about fake news last week when he said the idea that Facebook was a hotbed for such content was \"pretty crazy.\" \n\"The problems here are complex, both technically and philosophically,\" Zuckerberg wrote Friday night. \"We believe in giving people a voice, which means erring on the side of letting people share what they want whenever possible.\" \nHe added: \"We do not want to be arbiters of truth ourselves, but instead rely on our community and trusted third parties\" to help moderate content on the site. \nTo that end, Zuckerberg outlined a few solutions that are in the works: Stronger detection: better technical systems to detect what people will flag as false before they do it themselves. Making it much easier for people to report stories as fake to catch more misinformation faster. Third-party verification via \"respected fact-checking organizations.\" Warnings: labeling stories that have been flagged as false by third parties and the Facebook community, and showing warnings when people read or share them. Working with journalists and others in the news industry to get input and better understand their fact-checking systems and learn from them. \nFacebook was sharply criticized during the last days of the US presidential election for hosting false news stories that were widely shared on the platform. Much of that content was election-related, leading to suggestions that the fake reports potentially influenced the election's outcome .",

      "text": "share Photo by David Ramos/Getty Images Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg doesn’t think fake news influenced last week’s presidential election. But it turns out he does think fake news is a problem on Facebook, and late Friday night he laid out a few details about a number of “projects we already have underway” to stop the spread of fake news on Facebook in the future. The general takeaway from the lengthy Facebook post is that the social network plans to be more proactive in identifying and removing fake news articles from users’ feeds moving forward. Until now, it has primarily relied on users to report and flag inaccurate stories. That will still be possible, of course, but Zuckerberg outlined a number of other updates that are apparently in the works. A few of the potential changes: Adding a warning label to stories that users have flagged as inaccurate. Working with more third-party fact checking organizations. Improving the accuracy of “related articles” that it suggests for users to read. Blocking fake news distributors from paying to promote their content. ( Facebook started that process this week .) Building better algorithms to automatically detect fake news. “This means better technical systems to detect what people will flag as false before they do it themselves,” Zuckerberg wrote. Zuckerberg did not say when these updates will be active or available, but did stress that it won’t be a simple fix. “Some of these ideas will work well, and some will not,” he wrote. Facebook has been under fire this week after reports found that fake news stories may have played a larger role in last week’s election than anybody thought. Zuckerberg has denied on multiple occasions that fake news played a meaningful role in determining the election’s outcome. But his post Friday shows just how big of a problem Zuckerberg thinks misinformation really is. Despite the looming changes, Zuckerberg emphasized that Facebook will have to walk a fine line between policing its feed for fake news and not infringing upon personal opinions and free speech. “The problems here are complex, both technically and philosophically,” he wrote. “We believe in giving people a voice, which means erring on the side of letting people share what they want whenever possible. We need to be careful not to discourage sharing of opinions or mistakenly restricting accurate content. We do not want to be arbiters of truth ourselves, but instead rely on our community and trusted third parties.” Facebook has long argued that it’s not a media company, but that it’s a technology platform that simply carries information. But the truth of the matter is Facebook and its algorithms determine what news articles hundreds of millions of people see around the world each day. That brings with it some ethical responsibilities as well. “The bottom line is: we take misinformation seriously. Our goal is to connect people with the stories they find most meaningful, and we know people want accurate information,” Zuckerberg wrote. “We understand how important the issue is for our community and we are committed to getting this right.” \nA lot of you have asked what we're doing about misinformation, so I wanted to give an update. The bottom line is: we...",

      "text": "Continue reading the main story Photo Mark Zuckerberg in April. In a Facebook post Friday, he said the issues involved in dealing with misinformation on the social network were “complex, both technically and philosophically.” SAN FRANCISCO — After more than a week of accusations that the spread of fake news on Facebook may have affected the outcome of the presidential election, Mark Zuckerberg published a detailed post Friday night describing ways the company is considering dealing with the problem. Mr. Zuckerberg, Facebook’s chairman and chief executive, broadly outlined some of the options he said the company’s News Feed team was looking into, including third-party verification services, better automated detection tools and simpler ways for users to flag suspicious content. “The problems here are complex, both technically and philosophically,” Mr. Zuckerberg wrote. “We believe in giving people a voice, which means erring on the side of letting people share what they want whenever possible.” The post was perhaps the most detailed glimpse into Mr. Zuckerberg’s thinking on the issue since Donald J. Trump ’s stunning defeat of Hillary Clinton in the Nov. 8 election. Within hours of his victory being declared, Facebook was accused of affecting the election’s outcome by failing to stop bogus news stories, many of them favorable to Mr. Trump, from profilerating on the social network. Executives and employees at all levels of the company have since been debating its role and responsibilities . Facebook initially tried to minimize concerns about the issue, with Mr. Zuckerberg calling the notion that the company swayed the election “ a pretty crazy idea ” at a technology conference last week. In a follow-up Facebook post, he said that less than one percent of news posted to Facebook was false. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story But questions continued from outside the company, with some complaining that it was being too dismissive of its capacity to affect public opinion. In a news conference in Berlin on Thursday, President Obama decried the spread of misinformation on Facebook and other platforms. Mr. Zuckerberg came to no conclusions in his post Friday, instead providing a list of possible solutions the company is exploring. One option, he said, could be attaching warnings to news articles shared on Facebook that have been flagged as false by reputable third parties or by Facebook users. Another could be making it more difficult for websites to make money from spreading misinformation on Facebook, he said. Mr. Zuckerberg made it clear that Facebook would take care to avoid looking or acting like a media company, a label it has frequently resisted. “We need to be careful not to discourage sharing of opinions or mistakenly restricting accurate content,” Mr. Zuckerberg wrote. “We do not want to be arbiters of truth ourselves, but instead rely on our community and trusted third parties.” \nFace",

      "text": "November 18, 2016 Andrew Hutchinson \nEarlier this week Facebook announced that it had found some of the metrics it's been providing to advertisers are inaccurate. \nSound familiar? \nThat’s because Facebook did the same thing a couple of months back, when it found some of the numbers it had been providing on video views were also wrong. \nSo what should we make of this? Does this mean more of Facebook’s metrics are incorrect and we just don't know it yet? Do you need to revise your strategy as a result of the clarified data. \nHere’s a full rundown of the cause and effect of each, including the September video update. Average Duration of Video Viewed \nIn September, Facebook clarified that they’d been reporting their Average Duration of Video Viewed metric wrong. \nFor some time - years in fact - Facebook had been using this calculation to provide this stat: \nTotal time spent watching / Total number of people who had played the video for three or more seconds \nThis means that all those people who were watching for less than three seconds were not being counted in the result, meaning the actual average duration of viewed content was lower than what was being reported. \nThe impact of this is hard to define, as it’s a case-by-case proposition, but some have suggested that the error increased the total duration of video viewed count by around 60%. \nUpon discovery of the error, Facebook put out a statement saying that they’d fixed it and reviewed their practices to ensure it doesn’t occur again. \n“We informed our partners and made sure to put a notice in the product itself so that anyone who went into their dashboard could understand our error. We have also reviewed our other video metrics on the dashboard and have found that this has no impact on video numbers we have shared in the past, such as time spent watching video or the number of video views. We want our clients to know that this miscalculation has not and will not going forward have an impact on billing or how media mix models value their Facebook video investments.” Page Insights – Organic Reach \nFacebook reported this week that it's uncovered a bug which meant that one of the dashboards on the Page Insights tab was displaying incorrect data. \nThe element in question is this one: \nThis is the only figure affected – Facebook says the reach on this tab was miscalculated, showing a sum of daily reach but not removing repeat visitors from the count. \nAs per Facebook : \n“The de-duplicated 7-day summary in the overview dashboard will be 33% lower on average and 28-day will be 55% lower. This bug has been live since May; we will be fixing this in the next few weeks. It does not affect paid reach.” Page Insights – Organic Reach Change \nIn addition to the reach error, Facebook has also reported that they’re making an improvement to Page organic reach stats to better match how they calculate the same for paid content. \n“On Pages, we’ve historically defined reach as a person refreshing their News Feed and the post being placed in their feed. For paid ads reports, we’ve moved to a stricter definition that only counts reach once the post enters the person’s screen (“viewable impressions”).” \nWith this change, Facebook estimates that reported reach for Pages will be 20% lower on average – so if you see a sudden shift, this may be the cause. Facebook says they’ll provide an update to all Pages via a notification within your Insights tab when this change comes into effect. Video – Measuring Completion \nAs part of their efforts to improve the accuracy of their data, Facebook's been working with measurement group Moat to add an extra layer of third-party verification. Moat has been analyzing Facebook’s current system, and they uncovered another reporting error related to video completion rates. \nThe problem occurs when the video and audio tracks on a piece of content don’t match up – as noted by Facebook : \n“When partners upload their videos to Facebook, the full video length is recorded, but when the video delivers to people’s devices, the length of the video can sometimes be a fraction of a second shorter or longer.” \nBecause of this, Facebook was sometimes failing to count completed video views because the audio was longer than the video element – so the video stops while there's still more audio left. Whenever this happened, Facebook didn't register this as a 100% view, which it should have. \nFacebook estimates that this may result in a 35% increase in the count of “video watches to 100%”. Instant Articles – Time Spent \nFacebook also found an error in their reporting of average time spent per article on Instant Articles, with a calculation mistake leading to an over-reporting of this stat by around 7%-8%. \nFacebook says that they were incorrectly counting the “histogram of time spent”, instead of reflecting the total time spent reading an article divided by total views. Analytics for Apps \nAn additional error was uncovered in their reporting of referrals from apps. \nIn the Analytics for Apps dashboard, the “Referrals” tab displays all the posts produced by people via an app or website. \nThis data's supposed to be a reflection of clicks that went directly to an app or website, but Facebook found that they were also counting other clicks on those posts, including clicks to view photos or video. \n“For power users of this metric (top apps that look at this data in the dashboard most frequently), we found that referrals have been overstated by approximately 6% on average. Other measurements of referrals, such as those appearing in Facebook’s ads reporting tools, are unaffected.” Interest Lists – Follower Counts \nBack in 2012, Facebook introduced ‘ Interest Lists ’ to help people follow content they might be interest in but didn’t necessarily want flooding their News Feed. \nThis meant that you could create a list for, say, “Fiction Writers” and add publishers and authors to it, or a “Basketball” list with NBA players and official team accounts, which you could then check in on whenever you wanted. \nBut the feature has never really taken off. Facebook ran a test earlier this year with a replacement for interest lists, which provided topic-specific News Feeds , but we’ve not heard anything about it since, so it looks like that wasn’t a winner either. \nBecause of this, Facebook has also announced that they’re removing Interest Lists as an option – which is no big deal, given that you probably don’t use it, but it will also result a reduction in followers for some Pages and Profiles. \nThis is because whenever you or your Page was included on an Interest List, that counted as another follow – but also, if someone were to be following you from their profile and via an interest list, that got counted twice, so all of those additional follower numbers will now be removed. \nFacebook says that most profiles will see a drop in followers of less than 5%. Improving Accuracy \nSo there’s quite a few things to get through – and, I guess, the bigger issue, and concern for Facebook, is that these errors now bring all of their other metrics into question. How can we rely on Facebook’s data given that they’ve got so much wrong? How long will it be till another report comes out revealing that their figures were off? \nReally, the best way to counter this is to cross-check all data with your own on-page metrics and Google Analytics stats. Most of the figures noted above will have little impact on the more common business goals – being click-throughs and subsequent conversions. You can still track all the Facebook referrals for these stats in other ways, and it’s important to do so to ensure that what you’re seeing on Facebook matches with the rest of your stats. \nOn Facebook’s side, they’re working to facilitate more third-party verification of their data to give marketers more peace of mind, while they’re also improving the accuracy of their naming structures (e.g. “view content” → “website view of content,” and “video views” → “3-second video views”) and updating their glossaries to ensure there’s more consistent explanations of their metrics across the various platforms. \nBut really, how big an impact these errors will have, and how much trust you put into Facebook’s data, is up to you. As noted, it’s important to cross-check where possible and ensure the data you’re seeing reflects the end results. Author Information",

      "text": "If fake news wasn’t on Facebook, people would find it somewhere else People no longer agree on what high-quality news is.   People no longer agree on what high-quality news is. By Gregory Ferenstein November 19 at 6:00 AM Follow @ferenstein Gregory Ferenstein is the editor of the Ferenstein Wire, a syndicated column, and author of \" The Age Of Optimists .\" (Dado Ruvic/Reuters Illustration) \nIn 2009, one of the world’s foremost political scientists published a prophetic research study questioning how much influence the media had in elections. In “ Does the Media Matter? ,” Alan Gerber, a professor at Yale, and his team found that randomly assigning participants to receive different newspapers or no newspaper had “no effect on political knowledge, stated opinions, or turnout in postelection survey and voter data.” Most participants, they found, had made up their mind before reading the news. \nThis was not a unique finding. In another recent experimental study , researchers found that fact-checking of inaccurate statements had little impact on changing the minds of Donald Trump voters. Participants were given a series of falsehoods Trump had said, then shown that they were not true. But voters maintained their unwavering support for him, even if they admitted to previously believing untrue information. \n“I guess it means that politicians like Trump can spread misinformation without losing support,” concluded the study’s author, Briony Swire-Thompson , a graduate student   Western Australia. \nIn many ways, Trump’s victory was a large-scale natural experiment reaffirming the findings in these research studies. We may never again witness the media’s united effort to condemn a major-party presidential candidate. Only six newspapers endorsed Trump, while several media outlets that almost always support Republicans urged their readers to reject him as an unambiguous threat to the world order. This unprecedented coalition was, evidently, ineffective. \nNow, rather than admitting the difficult realization of their own limits, many journalists are seeking to redirect blame. Facebook, where “fake news” spread virally side by side with real reporting, has become the go-to scapegoat. “Mark Zuckerberg is in Denial,” declared one piece in the New York Times that excoriated the social network CEO for defending the company’s role in the election. [ My ‘fake news list’ went viral. But made-up stories are only part of the problem. ] \nZuckerberg has called accusations that Facebook influenced the election “a pretty crazy idea,” citing internal data showing that fake news, hoaxes and alternative news sites represent a tiny fraction of the overall news shared on the platform. He says Facebook routinely introduces a diverse set of views to its users, but they choose to ignore them and don’t click through to stories that differ from their preconceived opinions. \nIndeed, research suggests that most links shared on Facebook aren’t even clicked on but are shared by partisans who already know what they want to believe. On the other hand, reporting by BuzzFeed suggests that fake news, most likely hyperpartisan in nature, was more popular than mainstream news just before the election. \n“Right now the problem isn’t that diverse information isn’t there . . . but we haven’t gotten people to engage with it in higher proportions,” Zuckerberg said at the Techonomy conference in Half Moon Bay, Calif. \nIt’s true: Scapegoating Facebook ignores more fundamental issues with our democracy. [ Facebook fake-news writer: ‘I think Donald Trump is in the White House because of me’ ] \nBefore the Internet and the proliferation of cable news, producers and newspaper editors enjoyed a golden era as the gatekeepers of the national conversation. Much of America was all fed the same news, while outlier views were excluded from TV and print. \nThe Internet is an unusually efficient vehicle for making money off the spread of fake and incendiary news , which is why Google, Twitter and Facebook have attempted to clamp down on ads paired with unscrupulous links. But the uncomfortable reality is that journalists no longer enjoy the convenience of a captive audience. Readers can find news wherever they like; Facebook makes it easier for people to encounter and share it, yes, but if that platform didn’t exist, something else would. \nUltraconservative outlets, such as the Drudge Report, are reporting record traffic. Self-selection is even occurring within conservative outlets, as Trump champion Sean Hannity for the first time beat his colleagues Bill O’Reilly and Megyn Kelly on Fox News Channel in the 25-to-54-year-old ratings demographic, according to the Nielsen data released in September . \nUnless we fix the demand for biased or fake news, no filter feature that Facebook or Google builds will make much of a difference. America will likely need to reform the education system to create a more informed electorate. Secretary of Education John B. King Jr. recently called for a greater emphasis on civics education, while many states are either ramping up their civics courses or mulling new graduation requirements. \nOf course, journalism has an essential role in educating the public and elevating national discourse. If 29 percent of Americans believe President Obama is a Muslim , that reflects the media’s inability to effectively convey ideas. Fixing that is our great challenge, our responsibility. \nResearch suggests that it is only possible to counteract rumors when readers trust the source. According to Gallup , trust in the media is at a historic low of 32 percent, down 28 points since 2005. \nThe proliferation of partisan news and conspiracy-theory outlets has likely fueled this distrust and made it harder for citizens to identify high-quality media. \nIncreasing trust in quality news publishers will likely require journalists to engage with voices and ideas they find deeply offensive, reaching out to the darkest elements of the Internet they might otherwise wish to avoid. \nI want to be clear: I’m not blaming my colleagues in the news business. But the reaction against Facebook is naive about the realities of the new media landscape and unduly pessimistic about the capacity of citizens to make good choices. \nThe inconvenient truth is that the Internet is a reflection of what people are saying and thinking, whether it’s on Facebook or alternatives like the Drudge Report and the massive underground of email chains that circulate conservative rumors . A billionaire CEO will not stem the rising unrest of American populism, and it’s troubling that anyone hopes one company should exert so much power even if it could. \nBefore we can solve Facebook’s problem, we need to fix our democracy. 0",

      "text": "Fake News on Facebook Is a Real Problem. These Students Came Up With a Fix in 36 Hours. The four students built a Chrome extension It tags links in Facebook feeds as verified or not verified They factor in the source's credibility and cross-check the content \nWhen Nabanita De scrolled through her Facebook feed recently, she felt afraid. There were so many posts with competing information and accusations about Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton that she didn't know how to begin deciphering the fearmongering from the reality. \nThe social media site has faced criticism since the presidential election for its role in disseminating fake and misleading stories that are indistinguishable from real news. Because Facebook's algorithm is designed to determine what its individual users want to see, people often see only that which validates their existing beliefs regardless of whether the information is true. \nSo when De, an international second-year master's student at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst, attended a hackathon at Princeton University this week where the goal was to develop a technology project in 36 hours, she suggested to her three teammates that they build an algorithm to authenticate what is real and what is fake on Facebook . ( Also see: Barack Obama Takes Strong Stance Against Fake News on Facebook )\nAnd they were able to do it. \nThe four students - De, with Purdue University freshman Anant Goel and sophomores Mark Craft and Qinglin Chen from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign - built a Chrome browser extension that tags links in Facebook feeds as verified or not verified by taking into account factors such as the source's credibility and cross-checking the content with other news stories. Where a post appears to be false, the plug-in will provide a summary of more credible information on the topic online. A small blue box in the upper right-hand corner of the screen says either \"verified\" or \"not verified.\" \nThey've called it FiB. \nSince the students developed it in only 1 1/2 days (and have classes and schoolwork to worry about), they've released it as an \"open-source project,\" asking anyone with development experience to help improve it. The plugin is available for download to the public, but the demand was so great that their limited operation couldn't handle it. \nIdeally, Goel said, Facebook would team up with a third-party developer such as FiB so that the company could control all news feed data but let the developers verify it so Facebook couldn't be accused of \"hidden agendas or biases.\" \nThe sponsors of the hackathon included Facebook and other major technology companies, but neither Facebook nor Google has contacted the students about FiB. Both companies have said this week that they will take steps to address the spread of fake news. \nThis year's presidential election has shown how the lines have blurred between fact and lies, with people profiting from the spread of fake news. More than 100 news sites that made up pro-Trump content have been traced to Macedonia, according to a BuzzFeed News investigation. The Washington Post interviewed Paul Horner, a prolific fake-news creator, who said: \"I think Trump is in the White House because of me. His followers don't fact-check anything - they'll post everything, believe anything.\" \n( Also see: Facebook Denies Report It Failed to Deploy a Tool to Weed Out Fake News ) \nMelissa Zimdars, a communications professor at Merrimack College in North Andover, Massachusetts, said she's seen a similar problem with students who cite questionable sources. So she created a list of fake, misleading or satirical sites as a reference, not as a direct response to the postelection fake news debate but to encourage students to be more media-literate by checking what they read against other sources. \nThe list, which she has continued to add to since she made it public earlier this week, has gone viral. She included tips for analyzing news sources: \n\"Watch out if known/reputable news sites are not also reporting on the story. Sometimes lack of coverage is the result of corporate media bias and other factors, but there should typically be more than one source reporting on a topic or event. \n\"If the story makes you REALLY ANGRY it's probably a good idea to keep reading about the topic via other sources to make sure the story you read wasn't purposefully trying to make you angry (with potentially misleading or false information) in order to generate shares and ad revenue.\" \nZimdars said people have grown so distrustful of institutional media that they turn to alternative sources. A recent Pew Research Center survey found that only 18 percent of people have a lot of trust in national news organizations; nearly 75 percent said news organizations are biased. \nIt doesn't help, Zimdars said, that news media, to be profitable, rely on \"click-bait\" headlines that are sometimes indistinguishable from the fake stories. \nPaul Mihailidis, who teaches media literacy at Emerson College in Boston had a different take. \n\"I don't think a lot of people didn't know; I think they didn't care. They saw it as a way to advocate,\" Mihailidis said. \"The more they could spread rumors, or could advocate for their value system or candidate, that took precedent over them not knowing. A large portion of them didn't stop to critique the information. One of the things that has happened is people are scrolling though [Facebook] and the notion of deep reading is being replaced by deep monitoring. They see a catchy headline, and the default is to share.\" \nAnd the way people consume news, by a flick of the thumb on a smartphone, means they are less likely to cross-check what they're reading against other sources. \nThat's where the plugin tool presents a simple solution. \n\"A few days back, I read an article telling people they can drill a jack in the iPhone7 and have an earphone plug, and people started doing it and ruining their phones,\" De said. \"We know we can search on Google and research it, but if you have five minutes and you're just scrolling through Facebook, you don't have time to go verify it.\" \n© 2016 The Washington Post",

      "title": "'Misinformation' On Facebook: Zuckerberg Lists Ways Of Fighting Fake News",
      "text": "Enlarge this image \nFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg says his company is responding to sharp criticisms over fake stories appearing in its news feeds. He's seen here speaking Saturday at the APEC CEO Summit, part of the broader Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Summit in Lima. Rodrigo Buendia/AFP/Getty Images hide caption toggle caption Rodrigo Buendia/AFP/Getty Images Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg says his company is responding to sharp criticisms over fake stories appearing in its news feeds. He's seen here speaking Saturday at the APEC CEO Summit, part of the broader Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Summit in Lima. Rodrigo Buendia/AFP/Getty Images \nFacebook could start labeling stories that might be false, company founder Mark Zuckerberg says, laying out options for how the site handles what he calls \"misinformation.\" Other ideas include automatic detection of potentially false stories and easier flagging by users. \n\"While the percentage of misinformation is relatively small, we have much more work ahead on our roadmap,\" Zuckerberg wrote in a posting to his Facebook profile last night. \nZuckerberg outlined seven projects his company is working on that could undermine fake news stories. The approaches range from consulting with journalists and fact-checking organizations to disrupting the flow of money in the often-lucrative online fake news business. \n\"We are raising the bar for stories that appear in related articles under links in News Feed,\" Zuckerberg wrote of one initiative. Of another, he said, \"A lot of misinformation is driven by financially motivated spam. We're looking into disrupting the economics with ads policies like the one we announced earlier this week, and better ad farm detection.\" \nThe project on classifying misinformation is sure to generate discussion. Zuckerberg says it would bring \"better technical systems to detect what people will flag as false before they do it themselves.\" He didn't specify what the effects of that determination might be — whether it would mean the removal of the content from certain news feeds or from the site altogether. Article continues after sponsorship \nSeveral of the highest-rated comments on Zuckerberg's post were positive in their reception, with this idea from George Papa ranking near the top: \"If people had a bit of brain and did some research on their own when they read something that does not sound right...we would not have this problem.\" \nThe moves signal another step in Facebook's evolution from its start as a tech-oriented company to its current status as a complex media platform. The company has come under criticism that its news feeds and ad payment systems are too welcoming of fake news, particularly after a contentious presidential campaign season that culminated in last week's upset win by Donald Trump. \nTrump's Nov. 8 election left many pollsters and pundits mystified. It also prompted social media users to complain that Facebook and other sites had kept people in bubbles of like-minded opinion; some also said that fake news had influenced the vote. \nDays after the election, Zuckerberg sought to allay those complaints, saying that fake news makes up a \"very small volume\" of the content on Facebook, as NPR's Aarti Shahani reported. And he said hoaxes existed long before his site went online. \n\"There's a profound lack of empathy in asserting that the only reason why someone could have voted the way that they did is because they saw some fake news,\" Zuckerberg said last week. \nAs Aarti reported Thursday , Facebook has long relied on users to flag suspicious or offensive stories — and it relies on subcontractors in the Philippines, Poland, and elsewhere to make quick yes-no rulings on those cases, often within 10 seconds. \nWith last night's announcement, Zuckerberg gave a glimpse of how Facebook is wading into an area that's often fraught with controversy: verifying or censoring content. \n\"The bottom line is: we take misinformation seriously,\" he wrote. \"Our goal is to connect people with the stories they find most meaningful, and we know people want accurate information.\" \nHere's the list of steps Zuckerberg laid out (here we're quoting his post): \n\"- Stronger detection. The most important thing we can do is improve our ability to classify misinformation. This means better technical systems to detect what people will flag as false before they do it themselves. \n\"- Easy reporting. Making it much easier for people to report stories as fake will help us catch more misinformation faster. \n\"- Third party verification. There are many respected fact checking organizations and, while we have reached out to some, we plan to learn from many more. \n\"- Warnings. We are exploring labeling stories that have been flagged as false by third parties or our community, and showing warnings when people read or share them. \n\"- Related articles quality. We are raising the bar for stories that appear in related articles under links in News Feed. \n\"- Disrupting fake news economics. A lot of misinformation is driven by financially motivated spam. We're looking into disrupting the economics with ads policies like the one we announced earlier this week, and better ad farm detection. \n\"- Listening. We will continue to work with journalists and others in the news industry to get their input, in particular, to better understand their fact checking systems and learn from them.\" \nSeveral items on the list hint at how daunting the task of silencing fake news may be. \nExclusive breaking news stories, for instance, could have trouble getting the green light from either an algorithm or an independent fact-checker; and both the reporting and warning features could become new tools in advocates' fights to push their own views — and reinforce the bubbles that have prompted Facebook users' complaints. \nZuckerberg has spoken about the difficulty of bursting those bubbles in the past. As Aarti reported last week, \"The problem, he says, is that people don't click on things that don't conform to their worldview. And, he says, 'I don't know what to do about that.' \"",

      "text": "Speaking today in Lima, Peru at an economic forum, Facebook co-founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg vowed that his company would do its part to help fight the growing tide of hate speech and fake news that has engulfed his and other social media companies in controversy.\nIn recent days, Facebook has been the center of a heated debate over its role in spreading misleading and false information during the U.S. election season. While Zuckerberg has insisted the amount of fake news on Facebook is small, and had little impact, critics insist the company needs to take its role as a global media company more seriously.\nAt the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation CEO Summit today, making a rare public appearance in a suit and tie, Zuckerberg said he believed Facebook could tackle these issues, but had no illusions about how difficult they would be.\n“I’m optimistic about all this. But as an engineer, I realize how hard it’s going to be,” he said. “We can work to give people a voice. But we also need to do our part to stop the spread of hate, and violence and misinformation.”\nZuckerberg noted that the company has been building AI-driven tools to help spot violent content, whether it’s from terrorists or more personal indications of someone’s suicidal thoughts. And he also pointed to the company’s Safety Check tool to help track people during disasters or violent events.\n“We live in a relatively peaceful time,” he said. “But there’s still too much violence.”\nHis remarks came as part of a broader speech in which he sought to encourage government and business leaders to set loftier and more ambitious goals to improve people’s lives. The APEC forum 21 member nations to discuss ways to improve social economic standing of people living around the Pacific Ocean.\nZuckerberg said that breakthroughs in science and technology should be harnessed to help do things like connect everyone to the Internet and cure all diseases.\n“It’s a time for greatness,” Zuckerberg said. “With accelerating progress in science and technology, our generation has the potential to do more great things than at any other time in history.”\nHere is his full speech:\n",

      "text": "Facebook has been struggling to keep fake news stories from infiltrating its trending sections and off people's newsfeeds. But it turns out all the social media giant had to do was work with some student programmers who found a way to sniff out fake news sites in just 36 hours.\nSEE ALSO: It’s time to stop blaming Facebook for fake news\nThe group of four students, including Nabanita De, who spoke to Mashable Friday, buckled down during a three-day hackathon event at Princeton University last week. They came up with a Chrome browser extension appropriately called FiB.\nDe said the idea struck her as she was on the bus to Princeton from UMass Amherst, where she is a grad student. The 22-year-old spoke with her hackathon teammates Anant Goel, 18, Qinglin Chen, 20, and Mark Craft, 19, about finding a way to tackle fake information that spreads through Facebook.\nTeam FiB (Anant Goel, Nabanita De, Qinglin Chen and Mark Craft) at the Princeton hackathon.\nImage: FiB\nAfter a 36-hour whirlwind, the team had come up with its fake news solution. The extension goes through your feed and verifies the sources of news stories, images and other links. The posts are tagged with a \"trust score\" of either \"verified\" or \"not verified\" to give users a sense of whether a post is B.S. or legit. The Washington Post showed how the extension works by using advanced web scraping to find links, posts and images that are sent to AI that goes through a collection of API calls.\nSince they released the tool, De said there have been something close to 50,000 downloads. \"Servers are crashing because they can't handle so much,\" she said. The group has left all its code open and free and De said she hopes others who have been working on the Facebook issue for a lot longer will reach out. The team is all about having everything out in the open .\nDe said the team hasn't been in touch with Facebook, but she'd be up for better integration with the platform.\nAlso this week, other Chrome extensions including the \" B.S. Detector \" and the \" Fake News Alert \" debuted as tools in the ongoing effort to fight fake Facebook stories. Maybe Facebook will jump on some of these, since it doesn't seem to have quite figured out how to handle the problem.\nBONUS: Signs your friend just bought a GoPro",

      "text": "LIMA, Peru (AP) -- Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg urged world leaders meeting in Peru on Saturday to help get more people online, saying it will help reduce income inequality and improve the quality of life for hundreds of millions of people around the world. Zuckerberg also asked those attending an Asia-Pacific trade summit to sign a \"connectivity declaration\" and commit to work with companies like his to create the infrastructure that will allow more people to have access to the internet.\nThe founder of the social network said the amount of spending on such infrastructure has declined despite the fact that online access can promote scientific development and economic growth.\nAbout half the world can't get online either because they have no access to a network can't afford it or don't appreciate the benefits, he said.\n\"If we can connect the 4 billion people who aren't connected we can lift hundreds of millions of people out of poverty,\" he said.\nFacebook has come under criticism in the U.S. in recent days for failing to rein in fake and biased news stories that some believe may have swayed the presidential election. Zuckerberg said in a statement he posted after arriving in Lima on Saturday that his company has been working to address what he called a \"relatively small\" amount of misinformation on the network with several initiatives that include making it easier to detect incorrect information and to report it.",

      "text": "print \nGoogle has done a much better job combating fake news than Facebook, but there is still a big problem it needs to fix: “newsy” Google search results that seem like they have been editorially approved, but actually haven’t been. \nEarlier this week, Google faced criticism when one of its top results for “final election count” was fake news. The top result in Google Search's “In the news” section was a Wordpress blog named “70 News,” which claimed Trump won the popular vote by a margin of almost 700,000. He didn’t. \nHere is what the Google results looked like at one point: \nBusiness Insider \nTo the average person, the above page might look as if Google News, the company's editorially-vetted news section, which has human oversight, had been duped by a fake news story. \nBut it hadn't. Google says that “70 News” was not part of the Google News roster of approved publications. \nHow is that possible? \nThe reason is because the “newsy” modules that sit at the top of many Google searches — the “In the news” section on desktop, and the “Top stories” section on mobile — don’t pull content straight from Google News. They pull from all sorts of content available across the web, and can include sites not approved by Google News. \nThis is particularly confusing for users on the desktop version of Google's site, where the \"In the news\" section lives. \nNot only does the “In the news” section literally have the word \"news\" in its name, but the link at the bottom of the module, which says “More news for…,” takes you to the separate Google News page, which is comprised only of articles that Google's editorial system has approved. \nBusiness Insider \nGiven these two factors, it's not a stretch that you might assume the results in that little box are from Google News. Often the are. But they aren't always, as evidenced by \"70 News.\" And that's perfectly OK by Google. \nThe newsy boxes appear to be a loophole in Google's system that provides another way for false information to seep into the public consciousness under the guise of trusted facts. \nWhile the viral nature of Facebook's social media platform has been blamed for much of the recent spread of false news, Google's efforts to position itself as the world's fist stop on the web has created another breeding ground for fake news that is still not completely understood. Ads versus ad-free \nSo why isn’t the “In the news” section just the top three Google News results? \nThe short answer is because Google sees Google Search and Google News as separate products. \nThe longer answer might have to do with advertising dollars. Google News does not include any advertising, which helps Google avoid recriminations from news publishers, already angry about losing traffic to Google, that Google is profiting from their work. \nGoogle's main search page, by contrast, does have advertising. \nBy features a box of news stories on its main search page, Google can generate ad revenue alongside popular news articles that are not technically \"Google News,\" while providing a link to its ad-free Google News section. (Google declined to comment on this aspect). \nWhatever the reason for the separation, the branding and placement of the “In the news” section seems likely to mislead users into thinking it’s a Google News product. The 80% Google News consensus \nNone of this would be a problem if Google News and Google Search had the same amount of editorial oversight. But Google has a stricter system of quality control on Google News, so users might inherently trust “In the news” in a way they wouldn't trust a simple search result. \nThe goal of Google News is to showcase the work of bona fide news sites, with authoritative voices. Publications have to apply to be part of Google News, and can be turned down. \nTo get into Google News, a site first goes through a low-level algorithmic check, which looks at things like site structure (is there an “About Me” page?). If it passes, the site then goes through a proactive review by a committee, which is encouraged to do extra research. In this committee, if the site gets an 80% or more consensus, it passes. If it gets rejected, the publisher is told why, and can reapply in 60 days. Google has let over 75,000 publications onto this platform, and there is a form anyone can use to report any bad behavior, which can get publishers kicked off. Google Search for truth \nGoogle’s search results, in contrast, are not editorially vetted, or assessed for “truth.” Google’s algorithms still do a good job at sniffing out fake sites because Google is set up to catch “spam.” But Google’s algorithms will likely never be 100% perfect at telling what information on a website is inaccurate. \nGoogle does, however, seem to want to wipe fake news from its platform. \n“From our perspective, there should just be no situation where fake news gets distributed, so we are all for doing better here,” Google CEO Sundar Pichai said recently. After the issue of fake news entered the spotlight after the election, Google announced it would ban fake-news sites from its ad network, choking off their revenue. \nBut even if Google's goal is to kick fake-news sites out of its search engine, most Google users probably understand that Google search results don’t have carry the editorial stamp of approval from Google. \nBut this expectation gets more complicated when it comes to Search sections like “Top Stories” or “In the news.” The 'Top Stories' on your phone \nWhen you search for something that relates to news on your smartphone, Google will often present you with a carousel of stories at the top labeled “Top stories.” \nHere is what it looks like: \nBusiness Insider \nThat carousel is not part of Google News. It is full of “ newsy” pages from both Google News and from Google Search. So it is a mixture of sites vetted and not vetted by humans. \nWhat ties all those “Top stories” together is that they are AMP sites, Google’s open-source project to promote faster-loading webpages. Basically, any website that conforms to a set of technical standards gets labeled an AMP site by Google, and gets an “AMP” tag (with a little lightning bolt). \nOne of the perks of being an AMP site is that you have the chance to appear in the “Top stories” carousel. \nBut though the “Top stories” carousel might strike you as similar to Google News when you hear the name, Google views AMP as a technical description, not as an editorial product. Anyone can publish an AMP site, and the pages don’t even have to be news-related — Ebay is one, for instance. \nBecause of this stance, Google has no plans to have humans make any editorial decisions about AMP pages. \nThe “In the news” section rests in a similar situation. It is a “Search” product not a “News” product, and so is not editorially vetted. And while Google’s algorithms are good, the “70 News” situation shows they can be gamed. \nThis whole situation seems like an easy fix for Google: Have the sections that appear to be news only pull from Google News, which has stricter oversight. As previously stated, Google declined to comment on the reason why Google News and Google Search are kept separate.",

Zuckerberg recently shared Facebook's strategy to fight fake news. (Photo: Ernesto Arias, EPA) \nFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg shared his plan of attack against phony news stories on the social media platform, following up on an earlier announcement on work \" to flag fake news and hoaxes \" in the wake of a vicious election cycle. \nIn a new post , Zuckerberg said Facebook previously relied on users to determine what stories were and weren't accurate, and said the company still believes in \"erring on the side of letting people share what they want whenever possible.\" \nWhile the CEO made it clear Facebook will continue to \"rely on our community and trusted third parties,\" he knows \"people want accurate information.\" So, the company plans to make some changes. \nZuckerberg outlined seven projects he said are underway to stop the spread of misinformation among Facebook's 1.79 billion users worldwide: Improve detection Make it easier for users to report false news Third party verification Insuring “quality” news appears in the News Feed Crack down on ads with misinformation Work with journalists to develop better fact-checking systems",

      "text": "The weeks since the 2016 presidential election has put Facebook under the spotlight for its role in the circulation of fake news articles, which included President Barack Obama weighing in during a press conference earlier this week. While CEO Mark Zuckerberg has made an effort to sidestep the blame leveled against his company for the rise of these articles, he had said that the company has more work to do in combatting misinformation.\nIn a post to Facebook last night , Zuckerberg outlined the steps that Facebook is taking to limit the spread of false information, but reiterated his belief that the company should not become the \"arbiters of truth.\"\nSome of the projects currently underway at Facebook include new systems that will help flag false information, better ways for people to report misinformation and flags to users once fake articles are reported, better recommendations when an article is clicked on, and updating its ad policies to discourage spam sites, which profit off of the exposure. He also noted that Facebook would be working with journalists and \"respected fact checking organizations\" to understand how they work to verify information, so that the company could learn from their efforts and experience.\nWhile Zuckerberg outlined a number of fairly straightforward steps to limit fake articles, he did not indicate any sort of timeline for when — if ever — these stories are rolled out to regular users, noting that \"some of these ideas will work well, and some will not.\" He also explained that the company has utilized user feedback and other sources to weigh the content appropriately so that it doesn’t spread as quickly through user news feeds.\nHowever, Facebook has had numerous problems with these sorts of automated systems in the past: after firing its entire Trending Topics editorial team earlier this summer, the site subsequently picked up a number of false stories, which gave false content considerable visibility . While Zuckerberg tries to avoid putting his company in the midst of a philosophical argument, it’s  clear that the automated systems that it presently uses are flawed and the spread of false information over the course of the election shows that there are considerable challenges ahead for the company.\nWe’ve reached out to Facebook for comment, and will update this post once we hear back.\nVia : Mark Zuckerberg (Facebook)",

      "text": "Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced new steps to counter fake news on the platform on Saturday, marking a departure from his skepticism that online misinformation is, as Barack Obama said this week, a threat to democratic institutions. \n“We take misinformation seriously,” Zuckerberg wrote in a post on Saturday. “We know people want accurate information. We’ve been working on this problem for a long time and we take this responsibility seriously.”\nZuckerberg said that the company has “relied on our community to help us understand what is fake and what is not”, citing a tool to report false links and shared material from fact-checking sites. “Similar to clickbait, spam and scams, we penalize [misinformation] in News Feed so it’s much less likely to spread,” he wrote.\nAs fake news takes over Facebook feeds, many are taking satire as fact Read more \nThis summer Facebook fired the human team of curators who watched its “trending” news items, leaving its algorithm to sort links. Fake and misleading news proliferated further , and Facebook earned scorn for high-profile embarrassments, for instance the deletion of a Vietnam war photo deemed too graphic. On Saturday, Zuckerberg called the problem “complex, both technically and philosophically” and said the company erred “on the side of letting people share what they want whenever possible”.\n“We do not want to be arbiters of truth ourselves, but instead rely on our community and trusted third parties.”\nFacebook has “reached out” to “respected fact-checking organizations” for third-party verification, Zuckerberg said, though he did not provide specifics. He said the company also planned to make reporting false stories easier and to create “better technical systems to detect what people will flag as false before they do it themselves”.\nZuckerberg also said Facebook would experiment with warning labels on stories, and try to better screen the quality of links in the “related articles” section, where the site has linked to false conspiracy theories about the September 11 attacks and Michelle Obama, among others.\nHe also said the company was “looking into disrupting the economics” of fake news, conceding that misinformation was driven, at least in part, by people profiting off of Facebook’s ad mechanics. \nBursting the Facebook bubble: we asked voters on the left and right to swap feeds Read more \nThe problem of misinformation online, once relegated to discussions of Russian propaganda , has drawn the attention of the president of the United States and the president-elect – albeit in different ways. On Thursday, Obama told reporters that the discrediting of news organizations and spread of misinformation threatened institutions. \n“If we are not serious about facts and what’s true and what’s not, if we can’t discriminate between serious arguments and propaganda, then we have problems,” he said at press conference .\n“If everything seems to be the same and no distinctions are made, then we won’t know what to protect,” he went on. “We won’t know what to fight for. And we can lose so much of what we’ve gained in terms of the kind of democratic freedoms and market-based economies and prosperity that we’ve come to take for granted.”\nPresident-elect Donald Trump has meanwhile made Steve Bannon, former CEO of the website Breitbart News, his “chief strategist” in the White House. Under Bannon’s leadership, Breitbart frequently published stories with misleading and partisan bent, often with racist and misogynistic tones .\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Barack Obama: fake news is a threat to democracy \nOnly a week ago, Zuckerberg dismissed the “crazy idea” that fake news could influence voters, despite a BuzzFeed analysis showing that fake news on the site outperformed real news , and Pew research finding that most Americans get their news from Facebook and Twitter.\nOn Saturday, the CEO insisted fake news was still a marginal problem, echoing his previous remark that “ more than 99% of what people see is authentic ”.",

      "text": "Published November 20, 2016 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre 0 Email Print AP \nBy Joe Bilello - Fox News @Joe_Bilello \nWe must thank the Democrats for constantly reminding us that the historical hate group known as the Ku Klux Klan technically still exists. Otherwise, no one but their 14 members would even know.\nThis week, retiring Nevada Senator Harry Reid claimed that the election of Donald Trump \"has sparked a wave of hate crimes across America.” Reid added, \"Many of our fellow Americans believe that Trump's election validates the kind of bullying, aggressive behavior Trump modeled on a daily basis.” Reid continued with his nonsensical race-baiting gibberish and attempted to link Trump to the apparently-still-in-existence KKK.\nWhen it comes to hate crimes, Harry Reid seems to be using a different standard to determine guilt other than the usual facts and evidence that the rest of us use. The man who once claimed that someone had told him that Mitt Romney didn't pay his taxes is apparently using the same burden of proof to convict Trump supporters of hate crimes. My cousin’s neighbor said that her gay friend was attacked by Trump supporters just for being gay. That's good enough for me. Case closed.\nA female Muslim student at the University of Louisiana-Lafayette claimed that she was assaulted by two men wearing Trump’s “Make America Great Again” hats. Again, that was good enough for many folks, including some in the national media, to convict these hate-filled apparitions. The problem was that no such event ever took place as the young lady later admitted to law enforcement that she made the whole thing up. And her story was not an anomaly.\nThe liberal media and Hollywood elites have already established the utter stupidity of the average Trump voter, right? But did you know that they are so stupid that they typically deck themselves out in full Donald Trump apparel before committing their hate crimes, according to many recent reports. Perhaps, in true \"The Godfather: Part II\" style, they say something like \"Donald Trump says hello\" before brutally attacking their victims. At least the brilliant, highly educated anti-Trump protesters are smart enough to cover their faces with hoods and bandannas as they loot stores, defecate in the street and set cars on fire.\nFake hate crimes have been on the rise for years. But Trump’s election all but guaranteed that we would see an unprecedented level of alleged hate crimes and hate crime hoaxes. The far left has become so emotionally invested in the idea that a Trump presidency would spark an onslaught of hate and violence that they simply cannot let these fears go invalidated. And when there are no actual hate crimes to be found, they must be fabricated.\n(Note to hate crime hoaxters: Be more creative. Use something other than the swastika. It's a dead giveaway that you're a fake.) \nThe fake hate crime has become almost effortless in the age of social media. A simple tweet or Facebook post like \"My friend was beaten by Trump supporters just for being gay\" is enough for some to hand down a conviction in the court of public opinion.\nHarry Reid claims that many Americans feel \"validated\" in hateful actions following the election of Donald Trump.  Democrat Congressman Jared Huffman added to Reid’s insanity by saying, “We must prepare for more of this because the Trump campaign has legitimized and given public space to some shadowy groups that used to hide from public view.”\nBut which of these scenarios is more likely?\n1). Now that Donald Trump is the President-elect, a group of young men feel perfectly comfortable and “legitimized” assaulting and shouting racial epithets at a young Muslim girl with little to no fear of repercussions. They will be praised by the public at large and law enforcement will most likely ignore if not commend their crimes. In the event that they are arrested and convicted, they need only to wait until January 20 when they will most certainly receive a pardon from President Trump?\nOr\n2). A left-wing activist is trying to prove that all the fear mongering surrounding the Trump victory was not unwarranted. They completely fabricated the alleged crime in the hopes of not being caught but in the event that their lies were exposed, they would simply claim that they were trying to \"raise awareness\" about the festering climate of hate and inevitable crimes that are sure to eventually take place?\nThere can be no doubt that a certain amount of misguided individuals genuinely feel some level of fear. There is also no doubt that purveyors of fake hate crimes believe, in their demented minds, that they are somehow helping these individuals. But if individuals are truly afraid of the inevitable hate crime, why exacerbate those fears with hate crime hoaxes? Most likely because, the supposedly inevitable hate crimes never actually happen.\nIt is possible that some guy in Kansas City mumbled a derogatory term to an Arab gas station attendant at some point. That behavior should be condemned by all, but is it a national crisis?\nClick on the links below to find out about some of the hate crime hoaxes that have taken place following election night.\nThe ‘hate-crime’ victims of Trump who weren’t \nThere is no violent hate crime wave in Trump’s America \n7 fake hate crimes that the media blamed on Trump and his supporters",

      "text": "How to avoid getting conned by fake news sites \nZuckerberg's post comes as Facebook, Google and others face a barrage of criticism for letting sham articles circulate by way of their sites. \nDuring the recent US presidential election, a number of bogus articles did the rounds , including made-up stories like President Barack Obama banning the playing of the national anthem at US sporting events, and an FBI agent tied to the Hillary Clinton email scandal being found dead. \nSome critics say the spread of stories like that on Facebook tipped the election , a charge Zuckerberg last week said was \" pretty crazy ,\" adding later that the social network had made progress in addressing fake news and would continue working at it. \nEven Obama has weighed in on the issue. \n\"Particularly in the social media era, when so many get information from sound bites and snippets off their phone, if we can't discriminate between serious arguments and propaganda , then we have problems,\" the president warned during a press conference Thursday. \nZuckerberg's Friday post suggests he's aware the issue can't easily be dismissed. \n\"I want you to know that we have always taken this seriously,\" he wrote, \"we understand how important the issue is for our community and we are committed to getting this right.\" \nZuckerberg urged patience, however, saying the search for a fix would involve trial and error and that some of the solutions being explored by Facebook might not pan out. \n\"Some of these ideas will work well,\" he wrote, \"and some will not.\" \nHere's the full text of the post : \nA lot of you have asked what we're doing about misinformation, so I wanted to give an update. \nThe bottom line is: we take misinformation seriously. Our goal is to connect people with the stories they find most meaningful, and we know people want accurate information. We've been working on this problem for a long time and we take this responsibility seriously. We've made significant progress, but there is more work to be done. \nHistorically, we have relied on our community to help us understand what is fake and what is not. Anyone on Facebook can report any link as false, and we use signals from those reports along with a number of others -- like people sharing links to myth-busting sites such as Snopes -- to understand which stories we can confidently classify as misinformation. Similar to clickbait, spam and scams, we penalize this content in News Feed so it's much less likely to spread. \nThe problems here are complex, both technically and philosophically. We believe in giving people a voice, which means erring on the side of letting people share what they want whenever possible. We need to be careful not to discourage sharing of opinions or mistakenly restricting accurate content. We do not want to be arbiters of truth ourselves, but instead rely on our community and trusted third parties. \nWhile the percentage of misinformation is relatively small, we have much more work ahead on our roadmap. Normally we wouldn't share specifics about our work in progress, but given the importance of these issues and the amount of interest in this topic, I want to outline some of the projects we already have underway: \n- Stronger detection. The most important thing we can do is improve our ability to classify misinformation. This means better technical systems to detect what people will flag as false before they do it themselves. \n- Easy reporting. Making it much easier for people to report stories as fake will help us catch more misinformation faster. \n- Third party verification. There are many respected fact checking organizations and, while we have reached out to some, we plan to learn from many more. \n- Warnings. We are exploring labeling stories that have been flagged as false by third parties or our community, and showing warnings when people read or share them. \n- Related articles quality. We are raising the bar for stories that appear in related articles under links in News Feed. \n- Disrupting fake news economics. A lot of misinformation is driven by financially motivated spam. We're looking into disrupting the economics with ads policies like the one we announced earlier this week, and better ad farm detection. \n- Listening. We will continue to work with journalists and others in the news industry to get their input, in particular, to better understand their fact checking systems and learn from them. \nSome of these ideas will work well, and some will not. But I want you to know that we have always taken this seriously, we understand how important the issue is for our community and we are committed to getting this right. Share your voice",

      "text": "Mark Zuckerberg Outlines 7-Point Plan to Fight Fake News on Facebook \n“We take misinformation seriously,” social media platform founder says Linda Ge | November 19, 2016 @ 12:03 PM Facebook \nMark Zuckerberg has outlined his plan to fight fake news being spread on Facebook. \n“The bottom line is: we take misinformation seriously,” the site’s founder, chairman and CEO posted on Facebook late Friday. “Our goal is to connect people with the stories they find most meaningful, and we know people want accurate information. We’ve been working on this problem for a long time and we take this responsibility seriously. We’ve made significant progress, but there is more work to be done.” \nThe seven-point plan Zuckerberg laid out didn’t get too into specifics, but are, as follows: Stronger detection: including implementing new technology to sniff out false info Easy reporting: for users who spot fake news Third party verification: from recognized fact-checking organizations Warnings: which would alert readers to articles that have been flagged as potentially fake Related articles quality: setting a higher bar for related links that appear below articles Disrupting fake news economics: including better “ad farm detection” Listening: working with journalists for input and fact-checking systems. \nZuckerberg initially downplayed the criticisms that fake news being spread on his social media site could have contributed significantly to swaying the 2016 presidential election, but later made concessions to the contrary. \nIn a post last week, he acknowledged the widespread criticism, noting: “After the election, many people are asking whether fake news contributed to the result, and what our responsibility is to prevent fake news from spreading. These are very important questions and I care deeply about getting them right.” Also Read: Facebook Bans Fake News Sites From Using Ad Network \nHowever, he insisted that 99 percent of the content on Facebook is authentic, and called it “extremely unlikely hoaxes changed the outcome of this election in one direction or the other.” \nMisinformation spread on Facebook included the notion that the Pope had endorsed Donald Trump. The social network had 1.79 billion monthly active users as of the third quarter of 2016. \nOf his new 7-point plan, Zuckerberg said: “Some of these ideas will work well, and some will not. But I want you to know that we have always taken this seriously, we understand how important the issue is for our community and we are committed to getting this right.” 6 Craziest Bets Facebook Is Making for the Next Decade (Photos) \nFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg unveiled a 10-year road map for the world's biggest social network, including projects in virtual reality and artificial intelligence, at its annual developers' conference F8 in San Francisco. Facebook \nZuckerberg said he believes virtual reality headsets will be no different than traditional pairs of glasses in 10 years. Screenshot/Facebook's F8 Live Stream \nThe company released a reference design for a camera shaped like a U.F.O. that can capture 360-degree video. Facebook \nFacebook Messenger is about to get an army of bots. Chatbots, which are programs powered by artificial intelligence that do simple things, are going to integrate into Facebook's instant messaging system. It makes it easier for companies like CNN to send you personalized stories and other tasks. Facebook \nFacebook is obsessed with live video, and it wants you to be able to stream live from any device -- even a drone. To mark a move opening up the programming to Facebook live streaming, Zuckerberg flew a drone out on stage that filmed everybody in the packed conference hall. Screenshot/Facebook F8 Live Stream \nZuckerberg kicked off the conference by making a veiled jab at Donald Trump. “I hear fearful voices calling for building walls ... Instead of building walls, we can help build bridges,\" he said, as he explained that connecting the world is key to Facebook's future. (Maybe Trump won't notice: His preferred social network is Twitter, after all.)

According to a study by BuzzFeed News , fake election news beat real news on Facebook in the final three months of the presidential elections. \"20 top-performing false election stories from hoax sites and hyperpartisan blogs generated 8,711,000 shares, reactions, and comments on Facebook,\" BuzzFeed reported.\n\"It may seem like the top stories get a lot of traction, but they represent a tiny fraction of the total,\" a Facebook spokesman told BuzzFeed Wednesday.\nIn the Friday post, Zuckerberg said, \"The problems here are complex, both technically and philosophically.\" He added that, Facebook would normally not \"share specifics about our work in progress, but given the importance of these issues\" he explained the efforts that are already underway.\nOne of the important steps the company is taking is to have better \"technical systems to detect what people will flag as false before they do it themselves.\" This goes hand-in-hand with the process of making it easy for people to report misinformation.\nZuckerberg said that Facebook has reached out to various third-party verification and fact-checking organizations and plans to learn from them too. \"We do not want to be arbiters of truth ourselves, but instead rely on our community and trusted third parties,\" he said.\nAlso from the Washington Examiner Obama's post-election advice to his daughters Sasha and Malia \"What I say to them is that people are complicated,\" Obama said.\nBy Meghana Kurup • 11/19/16 3:07 PM Top Story Mitt Romney meets with Trump   [Trump],  \n  2:46 PM  ",

      "text": "Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg Finally Details Fake News Countermeasures A week ago, Zuckerberg was dismissing the scourge of fake news on Facebook. 11/19/2016 03:21 pm ET David Bailey \nFacebook Inc, facing withering criticism for failing to stem a flood of phony news articles in the run-up to the U.S. presidential election , is taking a series of steps to weed out hoaxes and other types of false information, chief executive Mark Zuckerberg said in a Facebook post Friday evening. \nFacebook has long insisted that it is a technology company and not a publisher, and rejects the idea that it should be held responsible for the content that its users circulate on the platform. Just after the election, Zuckerberg said the notion that fake or misleading news on Facebook had helped swing the election to Donald Trump was a “ crazy idea .” \nZuckerberg then said last Saturday that more than 99 percent of what people see on Facebook is authentic, calling “only a very small amount” fake news and hoaxes. \nBut in his Friday posting Zuckerberg struck a decidedly different tone. He said Facebook has been working on the issue of misinformation for a long time, calling the problem complex both technically and philosophically. \n“While the percentage of misinformation is relatively small, we have much more work ahead on our roadmap,” Zuckerberg said. \nHe outlined a series of steps that were already underway, including greater use of automation to “detect what people will flag as false before they do it themselves.” \nHe also said Facebook would make it easier to report false content, work with third-party verification organizations and journalists on fact-checking efforts, and explore posting warning labels on content that has been flagged as false. The company will also try to prevent fake-news providers from making money through its advertising system, as it had previously announced. \nZuckerberg said Facebook must be careful not to discourage sharing of opinions or mistakenly restricting accurate content. “We do not want to be arbiters of truth ourselves, but instead rely on our community and trusted third parties,” he said. \nFacebook historically has relied on users to report links as false and share links to myth-busting sites, including Snopes, to determine if it can confidently classify stories as misinformation, Zuckerberg said. The service has extensive “community standards” on what kinds of content are acceptable. \nFacebook faced international outcry earlier this year after it removed an iconic Vietnam War photo due to nudity, a decision that was later reversed. The thorniest content issues are decided by a group of top executives at Facebook, and there have been extensive internal conversations at the company in recent months over content controversies, people familiar with the discussions say. \nAmong the fake news reports that circulated ahead of the U.S. election were reports erroneously alleging Pope Francis had endorsed Trump and that a federal agent who had been investigating Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton was found dead.

Daily Edition Mark Zuckerberg Shares Facebook's Plan to Crack Down on Fake News 11:14 AM PST 11/19/2016 by Arlene Washington , Natalie Jarvey Getty Images Mark Zuckerberg Zuckerberg's latest comments come as Facebook as been criticized for its handling of fake news that ran rampant during the election. \nAfter criticism that Facebook's fake news spread may have influenced election results, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg recently outlined the company's improved steps to filter out \"misinformation.\" \nZuckerberg's Facebook post Friday night explained that although the \"percentage of misinformation is relatively small\" the company plans to create better technical systems to detect what people will flag as false before they do it themselves\" which would also improve the types of stories under the related articles section under links in News Feed. He also noted that Facebook is exploring the option of labeling certain stories with a warning that it has been flagged false by third-party sites including fact-checking organizations. \n\"The problems here are complex, both technically and philosophically,\" writes Zuckerberg. \"We believe in giving people a voice, which means erring on the side of letting people share what they want whenever possible. We need to be careful not to discourage sharing of opinions or to mistakenly restrict accurate content. We do not want to be arbiters of truth ourselves, but instead rely on our community and trusted third parties.\" \nZuckerberg added that new ad policies would cut down the amount of financially motivated spam that triggers misinformation. According to the Associated Press , Facebook announced on Monday that the site will no longer display ads that are illegal, misleading or deceptive which includes fake news.\" \nZuckerberg's latest comments come as Facebook as been criticized for its handling of fake news that ran rampant during the election. After Donald Trump was named the next president, critics questioned the role that Facebook had played in that outcome. When first questioned about the role of Facebook in the election, Zuckerberg said that it was a \"pretty crazy idea.\" \nThe Washington Post also recently interviewed a man who claimed that his viral fake news stories helped swing the election Trump's way. \nFacebook has since cracked down on fake news sites, prohibiting them from using its ad network, which places ads on other people's websites. It's a move that Google also made earlier this week after a fake news story topped some of its election-related search results. \n\"Some of these ideas will work well, and some will not,\" writes Zuckerberg. \"But I want you to know that we have always taken this seriously, we understand how important the issue is for our community and we are committed to getting this right.\" \nRead Zuckerberg's full Facebook post below.",

      "text": "Facebook's Zuckerberg offers plan to cut down on fake news posts Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation Forum (APEC) in Lima EPA Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Peruvian President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski talk Saturday during an event at the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation Forum in Lima, Peru. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Peruvian President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski talk Saturday during an event at the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation Forum in Lima, Peru. (EPA) Geoffrey Mohan \nFacebook founder Mark Zuckerberg has outlined a seven-point plan to combat fake news sites that played a role in the recent election. \nThe social media site will attempt to hit the fake news purveyors where it hurts, by interrupting the way these users generate revenue through advertising. In addition, the company will devise algorithms based on users’ flags of false content to help detect future content likely to be fake, and then remove it. \nZuckerberg said Facebook employees were not trying to be “arbiters of truth,” but instead would rely on users to moderate the vast content on the site. \n“We believe in giving people a voice, which means erring on the side of letting people share what they want whenever possible,” Zuckerberg said in a post published on the site late Friday night. “We need to be careful not to discourage sharing of opinions or to mistakenly restrict accurate content.” \nThe company will make it easier for users to report and flag fake stories, and explore ways to include warnings to future readers of that content. It also will reach out to additional third-party organizations to help vet claims made in stories, and will “raise the bar” for how stories are displayed as “related content.” \nThe announcement came as Zuckerberg flew to Peru to address an Asian-Pacific trade summit in Lima, where he told world leaders Saturday that more connectivity will help raise people out of poverty. \nZuckerberg has been under public pressure since the election, when some observers suggested that fake news circulated through Facebook may have influenced voters who chose Donald Trump for president. President Obama has said the wide dissemination of false news presents a threat to democratic institutions. \nZuckerberg initially dismissed the notion that misinformation drove choice as a “crazy idea,” saying that 99% of the content on the site was reliable. He changed course, however, soon after Google announced it would ban fake news sites from using its advertising services. \nZuckerberg’s subsequent proposal to ban such users from its own advertising network drew criticism from analysts, who argued that most false news sites don’t use the service. \nFake news organizations usually run ads on their own sites, using marketing services such as Google AdSense, to place those ads around their articles. They then steer readers to their stories through Facebook. \nMost of the fake news services have little or no name recognition and rely on social media to find an audience and generate the clicks that help generate ad revenue. Facebook’s algorithm acts as a catalyst, spreading the content to other users’ news feeds as it rises in popularity. \nOne such ad scheme generated lucrative revenue for a group of young people in the Macedonian town of Veles, who had launched more than 140 fake news sites, Buzzfeed reported. \nAmong the false stories from that network was a report that presidential candidate Hillary Clinton would be indicted in 2017. It generated more than 140,000 shares, comments and reactions on Facebook, Buzzfeed reported. \nAnother false story suggested that Clinton in 2013 had said she thought Trump was “honest” and should be elected president. It drew more than three times that activity on Facebook. \nAmong those who praised Zuckerberg’s moves was Jeff Jarvis, director of the Tow-Knight Center for Entrepreneurial Journalism at the City University of New York. \nJarvis co-wrote his own plan, published Friday on Medium, that cautioned against censorship by the platform itself, including creation of blacklists of suspect sites and “whitelists” of reliable ones. \nJarvis urged Facebook to make it easier for readers to scroll over an article to see pop-up content that refutes its claims, and to provide a path for reputable news agencies and fact-checking groups to post that refuting information and its source. \nJarvis also suggested that Facebook more prominently display reliable media “brands,” such as large-circulation newspapers, and offer simple ways to track back to the original source of content so that users may judge its objectivity or reliability.

      "text": "Mark Zuckerberg outlines Facebook's ideas to battle fake news Mark Zuckerberg Josh Edelson / AFP/Getty Images \nFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg introduces a new messenger platform at the F8 summit in San Francisco, California on March 25, 2015. \nFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg introduces a new messenger platform at the F8 summit in San Francisco, California on March 25, 2015. (Josh Edelson / AFP/Getty Images) Abby Ohlheiser The Washington Post \nA week after trying to reassure the public that it was \"extremely unlikely hoaxes changed the outcome of this election,\" Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg outlined several ways the company might try to stop the spread of fake news on the platform in the future. \n\"We've been working on this problem for a long time and we take this responsibility seriously. We've made significant progress, but there is more work to be done,\" Zuckerberg wrote in a Friday night post on his own Facebook page. He then named seven approaches the company was considering to address the issue, including warning labels on false stories, easier user reporting methods and the integration of third-party verification. \n\"The problems here are complex, both technically and philosophically,\" he cautioned, repeating the company's long-standing aversion to becoming the \"arbiters of truth\" -- instead preferring to rely on third parties and users to make those distinctions. \n\"We need to be careful not to discourage sharing of opinions or mistakenly restricting accurate content,\" he said. \nWhile none of the listed ideas are particularly specific, Zuckerberg's post does provide more details on the company's thinking about the problem of fake news. \nFacebook's concern with fake news predates the 2016 elections. Hoaxes have long plagued the site's algorithms, which incentivize the creation of content that its users would like to share, true or not. Mark Zuckerberg rejected the idea that fake news on the social network influenced the U.S. presidential election and said echo chambers aren't a problem on the site.\nThe company co-founder was responding to criticism following Donald Trump 's victory in the elections,... \nFacebook Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg rejected the idea that fake news on the social network influenced the U.S. presidential election and said echo chambers aren't a problem on the site. \nThe company co-founder was responding to criticism following Donald Trump 's victory in the elections,... (Sarah Frier) \nBut fake news - and specifically, Facebook's role in spreading it - became a story of wide interest just after the elections, when critics accused the platform of influencing voters by allowing political hoaxes to regularly go viral - particularly those favorable to the now President-elect Donald Trump . Zuckerberg has strongly denied that this was true, saying last week that the idea that Facebook influenced the elections in this way is \"pretty crazy,\" and that fake news \"surely had no impact\" on the outcome. David Pierson Hillary Clinton was the choice of nearly every American newspaper editorial board. It didn’t matter. \nWhen it comes to influencing public opinion, the 2016 presidential election demonstrated with sobering effect the weakening role of traditional media and the ascendant power of social networks... \nHillary Clinton was the choice of nearly every American newspaper editorial board. It didn’t matter. \nWhen it comes to influencing public opinion, the 2016 presidential election demonstrated with sobering effect the weakening role of traditional media and the ascendant power of social networks... (David Pierson) \nZuckerberg did not contradict this denial on Friday, but his post reflects Facebook's growing acknowledgment that it's going to have to do a lot more about the plague of hoaxes and fake stories on the platform. On Monday, Facebook announced it was going to crack down on fake news sites that use its ad services to profit off hoaxes. \nOne of the ideas Zuckerberg presented on Friday indicates that the company wants to go further in \"disrupting fake news economics,\" and is considering more policies like the one it just announced, along with stronger \"ad farm detection.\" \nAnother promises stronger detection of misleading content. \"This means better technical systems to detect what people will flag as false before they do it themselves,\" Zuckerberg wrote. \nNews Feed can already make some guesses about whether a post is authentic or not based on the user behavior around it. On Friday, Zuckerberg specified that Facebook currently watches for things like \"people sharing links to myth-busting sites such as Snopes\" to determine whether a post might be misleading or false. Zuckerberg didn't go into specifics about what more Facebook might be looking to do on this front. \nFacebook also indicated that it's trying to find ways to rely more on users and third parties to help flag and classify fake stories. Zuckerberg listed \"stronger reporting\" methods for users, and listening more to \"third party verification\" services like fact checking sites. Zuckerberg also said Facebook was considering how to use third-party and user reports of fake news as a source for displaying warnings on fake or misleading content. \nThe site would also improve the quality of articles that appear in \"related articles\" under news stories that are posted to Facebook. And, Zuckerberg said, Facebook would \"continue to work with journalists and others in the news industry\" on the issue. \nWhile Facebook has attracted the majority of scrutiny this week, the platform is hardly the only company struggling to address the spread of fake news on the Internet. On Monday, the top Google hit for the search \"final election count\" was a site falsely reporting that Trump had won the popular vote. Like Facebook, Google has also taken steps this week to try and stop fake news writers from using their ad services to make money.",

(Photo: WZZM-TV) \nHART, Mich. — A pile of dead deer left on state land near a home near Hart was road kill left there by an employee of the Oceana County Road Commission. \nWhen she discovered the pile of eight decomposing deer about 200 yards from her house in Weare Township, Tami Smith says at first she wasn’t able to get an explanation from the DNR or road commission. But after an article and picture were published by the Oceana County Press, she says an apologetic person at the road commission called to say a new employee left the deer there by mistake and the carcasses were removed. \n► Related: Firearm deer hunting opener: Dollars or deer, it’s still big bucks \n“The deer are gone and that's the only thing I wanted,” says a relieved Tami Smith. “I don't want any of the coyotes or the creepy crawlies that would have drawn. Or the smell and stench. I’m a happy girl.” \n► Related: Backyard buck shot by poacher as residents watch \nSmith says the area where the deer were piled is a former dumping ground in Weare Township. But she says a representative from the road commission told her their policy is to only leave one carcass at a time and farther away from the road.

      "title": "Facebook's Zuckerberg Reveals 7-Point Plan To Eradicate \"Misinformation\"",
      "text": "Nov 19, 2016 7:44 PM 0 SHARES \nFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has a message for his billion-plus users: \"you're not capable of deciding for yourself what is 'news' and what is not, so we will do it for you.\" \nFacebook has been widely blamed - by the left-leaning mainstream media - for allowing the spread of online misinformation, amusingly much of it pro-Trump, but Zuckerberg has rejected the notion that Facebook influenced the outcome of the election or that fake news is a major problem on the service . \n\"Of all the content on Facebook, more than 99 percent of what people see is authentic,\" he wrote in a blog post on Saturday. \n\n\"Only a very small amount is fake news and hoaxes.\" \nWhich is why we found it odd that since such \"a very small amount\" of Facebook is \"fake\", why the left-leaning CEO would draft up his 7-point plan for eradicating \"misinformation\" from the social network (via Facebook )... \nA lot of you have asked what we're doing about misinformation, so I wanted to give an update. \n\nThe bottom line is: we take misinformation seriously. Our goal is to connect people with the stories they find most meaningful, and we know people want accurate information. We've been working on this problem for a long time and we take this responsibility seriously. We've made significant progress, but there is more work to be done. \n\nHistorically, we have relied on our community to help us understand what is fake and what is not. Anyone on Facebook can report any link as false, and we use signals from those reports along with a number of others -- like people sharing links to myth-busting sites such as Snopes -- to understand which stories we can confidently classify as misinformation. Similar to clickbait, spam and scams, we penalize this content in News Feed so it's much less likely to spread. \n\nThe problems here are complex, both technically and philosophically. We believe in giving people a voice, which means erring on the side of letting people share what they want whenever possible. We need to be careful not to discourage sharing of opinions or to mistakenly restrict accurate content. We do not want to be arbiters of truth ourselves, but instead rely on our community and trusted third parties. \n\nWhile the percentage of misinformation is relatively small, we have much more work ahead on our roadmap. Normally we wouldn't share specifics about our work in progress, but given the importance of these issues and the amount of interest in this topic, I want to outline some of the projects we already have underway: \nStronger detection. The most important thing we can do is improve our ability to classify misinformation. This means better technical systems to detect what people will flag as false before they do it themselves. Easy reporting. Making it much easier for people to report stories as fake will help us catch more misinformation faster. Third party verification. There are many respected fact checking organizations and, while we have reached out to some, we plan to learn from many more. Warnings. We are exploring labeling stories that have been flagged as false by third parties or our community, and showing warnings when people read or share them. Related articles quality. We are raising the bar for stories that appear in related articles under links in News Feed . Disrupting fake news economics. A lot of misinformation is driven by financially motivated spam. We're looking into disrupting the economics with ads policies like the one we announced earlier this week, and better ad farm detection. Listening. We will continue to work with journalists and others in the news industry to get their input, in particular, to better understand their fact checking systems and learn from them. \n\nSome of these ideas will work well, and some will not. But I want you to know that we have always taken this seriously, we understand how important the issue is for our community and we are committed to getting this right. \nSo to clarify, Facebook will make it easier for any Tom, Dick, Or Harriet to complain about a story that will necessarily cut the revenues from that entity and will rely on 'fact-checking' organizations, establishment 3rd parties, and the mainstream media for input. \nWell what could go wrong? \nAs we noted previously , while Facebook (or Google) have every right to tweak their ad policies however they see fit - especially if in the process their own ad revenue decline, as both companies retain a portion of the ad proceeds they pay out to content providers - the move is yet another step on a slippery slope, one which begins with determining just what is considered \"fake news\" and ends with blanket internet censorship along ideological lines . \nWhich we find especially ironic considering much of the \"pro Clinton\" press was terrified that it would be Trump who would be the one to hint at or enforce censorship. It seems the media does not need Trump for that: it can do it quite well on its own.",

Detroit Free Press Buy Photo Carlito Smith, 16, center, says some Detroiters just don’t see how much they have to offer. “We have a lot of great artists, musicians, athletes and a lot of very intelligent people, but they don’t see themselves that way, for whatever reason.” With him on the east side are his brothers, from left, Judah, 7, Ellington, 17, and Maximillian, 14.

The Free Press spent a year talking to children across Detroit about how they live and what issues they see as most important. Safe neighborhoods, schools, job opportunities, teen pregnancy and help for young parents were among key issues raised. Based on these conversations, as well as community meetings and a poll, the Free Press looked at efforts both locally and around the country. This project was done with a $75,000 grant from the Solutions Journalism Network, a New York-based nonprofit that partners with newsrooms around the country to do projects that focus on solutions to social issues. \nNearly 14 children per day are victims of crime in Detroit. \nThe average age of the victim: 13. The most common crime: assault. \nThose are the findings of a Free Press analysis of Detroit Police Department data, which shows that the agency investigated more than 33,000 cases involving youths up to age 17 from Jan. 1, 2009, to Sept. 9, 2015. \nAnd during that time, roughly 2 of 5 children — 43% — were victims of violent crimes such as homicide, sexual assault, aggravated assault and robbery. \nThe analysis was done as part of a yearlong project in which the Free Press talked with parents and children across the city about what worries them about the future. Crime and education topped the list. The majority of interviews were with young people, from grade school-age through high school. The Free Press also conducted a poll of 400 adults in the city. Solutions for our children Chicago program gives teens job opportunities year-round \nIn interviews, young people also talked about mentors and role models, broken homes and worries about being prepared for the future. \nAnd they talked about the importance of being surrounded by supportive family and friends, about making good choices and about heading off to college, though the latter was tempered with worries about readiness. \n\"I don’t like the schools in Detroit,\" said Dyante Murphy, 16, a Cody High School student. \"It feels like I haven’t learned anything in high school since ninth grade. ...I don’t even talk about school no more with my mama. They give us worksheets, but we don't know what we're doing. When I graduate, I want to go to college. But how am I going to go when I don’t know precalculus or anything like that? We don't even get homework.\" \nIn all conversations, worries about crime, gun violence and safety abounded, however — showing that even as parts of Detroit see a resurgence of wealth and growth, children remain surrounded by a cycle of crime and violence that contributes to an environment that is so stressful, researchers call it toxic. \nEighteen-year-old Michael Drayton knows the impact of violence too well. \nOne summer day in 2011 changed the life of his 17-year-old cousin when gunshots and screams rang out on the grounds of the former Mackenzie High School. \nMichael was supposed to be there when it happened. \nBut in a twist of fate, he wasn’t. He said he was planning to go, but at the last minute, something told him to just stay home. \nHis cousin, who attended a high school reunion on the grounds, nearly died after he and a 54-year-old man were shot multiple times on June 26, when rival cliques clashed on a basketball court. \n“I almost went,\" Michael, 18, recalled, shaking his head at the memory. \"That really could have been me.” \nThe rate of crimes against youths has declined in Detroit, from 27 victims per 1,000 youths in 2009 to 25 victims per 1,000 youths in 2014 — the last complete year of data. But it remains high. \nFor teens like him, leaving for college represents a fresh start — a chance to escape his neighborhood, in the West Chicago area on the city's west side, that he says has claimed many lives, and almost his. \n“I’m not going to lie,” he said. “I have a past. When I was younger, like 14, I would hang with my cousins. We used to rob and stuff, but I started putting my mind to football and other things, and I started realizing my cousins weren't going to do nothing for me but have me in jail or dead, and I had to change that. I'm my mama’s only child, and if I died, she'd have nothing left. And I just don’t want my family going through that.” \nMichael was offered a football scholarship in February to Siena Heights University in Adrian, and he became a freshman in September, after graduating from Cody. \n“I really want to do this because I’m going to be the first person in my family to go to a four-year university, and it was a good opportunity,” he said. \n“And really, I just don’t want to be in Detroit no more. Either you’re with your friends and your friends are doing bad stuff, or you end up in jail or dead. I just wanted to get out of Detroit. I needed to, for my life.” Buy Photo \nTanell McCalebb, 17, of Detroit talks about growing up in the city as Jordan Davis, 17, and Ervin Butler, 17, listen. (Photo: Eric Seals, Detroit Free Press) \nTanell McCalebb, 17, said that sometimes, his mind is on a constant loop, replaying the night a few years ago when he received a call that a childhood friend, someone he once played football with and considered his cousin, was killed. \nOnce inseparable, they had slowly gone down different paths as they got older: one toward a bright future, and the other toward violence. \n\"We were close, but as we got older, we started drifting apart because we didn’t want the same thing, we didn’t want the same stuff,\" Tanell recalled. \"I got a call from my mama, and he was out late at night, 2 or 3 in the morning. He took his daddy's car, and they (he and his friends) went somewhere they weren’t supposed to go. \n\"They got chased, and she told me the car got shot up and they shot him in the head so many times. The car crashed, and it was just smashed. And I feel like it’s my fault. \n\"Even though people say it’s not, it really is, because I could have stayed on him more. I could have just stayed close with him.\" \nMcCalebb, a senior at the Michigan Collegiate Academy, a charter school in Warren, has lived in Detroit his entire life and currently lives near Mack and Warren on the city’s east side. \n\"Just trying to stay out the streets and trying to survive is the hardest part,\" Tanell said. \"It's really upsetting that people so young get their lives taken away, but like I say, 'A bullet ain't got no name on it.' Sometimes, it's just a person at the right place at the wrong time. People need to understand that being in that type of environment isn’t cool.\" \nWith several incarcerated family members, Jonice Sylvester, 17, said she was determined not to become a statistic, so she focused on school. \n“It’s hard to get away from the violence,” Jonice said. \nJonice was accepted to Eastern Michigan University in Ypsilanti and plans to seek a degree in biomedical engineering. She said she’s eager for a new start and the chance to get away. \n“I can’t wait to meet new people,” she said. “I think I saw the road I could have gone down by the examples around me. My older cousin, I saw some of the stuff she went through, like her getting jumped by other girls with locks and bats. I said, 'Let me calm down.' ” \nHenry Ford High School student Moriah McGhee said being a young woman is particularly challenging. \n\"You can't just walk outside in the dark by yourself,\" Moriah,17, said. \"It's not safe. We worry about rape and stuff. Rapists and killers, or getting your stuff stolen by robbers.\" \nIn the period the Free Press analyzed, from 2009 to 2015, 51% of young victims were female, 48% were male and the rest could not be determined. \nDyante said he’d never had a problem in his neighborhood near 6 Mile and Schaefer until May, when he was robbed on his way to school. \nHe had walked to a gas station near his house around 7 a.m. to grab some snacks, and when he walked out, he felt a gun pressed against the back of his head. \n“Two other people checked my pockets and got everything out of it. I didn’t know what to do. I didn’t want to give them my money, but I didn’t want to die, either,\" he said. \n\"I ran and called my mom. She came and picked me up. I wouldn’t say I was scared. I guess I just took it the manly way. \n\"I went to school. I didn’t tell nobody really what happened. I mean, living in Detroit, that’s something you deal with. You could be standing at the bus stop at 6 in the morning, and someone’ll just stick you up. Stuff is crazy.” \nA majority of children affected by violence in the city — 88% — are African American; 8% are white, and about 4% are other or unknown. The data did not identify the ethnicity of the victims, only their race, so there is no differentiation between Hispanic and non-Hispanic youths.

Says Jordan, 17, “I try to block out everything.” (Photo: Eric Seals, Detroit Free Press) \nErvin Butler, a 17-year-old senior at Michigan Collegiate in Warren was walking home from a friend's house on the city's east side near 7 Mile a few years ago, listening to music, when two men walked up to him and demanded all of his money and his phone. Ervin said his school replaced his stolen items because he was so distraught. \n“I was kind of shocked, surprised a little bit,” he said. “I hear about people getting robbed all the time, but I never thought it would happen to me.” \n\"When I was younger, I lived in an imaginary world. I used to think everything was good. ...After that, I started thinking everything was crazy. That hit me hard right there.\" \nTanell has his own story of being robbed. \nA few years ago, he was walking home from football practice when he was robbed of all of his practice gear near Denby High School. \n\"I felt like my manhood got taken from me, and that kind of hurt,\" Tanell said. \"I came to realize it's not even safe out here no more, to the point you can’t even walk to the store. We used to go everywhere, but we realized it's getting worse and worse in some areas.\" \nKarlen Stanciel once thought that hearing gunshots outside the house was a normal experience. But now that he's older, he realizes that’s not the case. \n\"Recently, someone died over some Cartier glasses around the neighborhood near my school,\" said Karlen, 18, a recent graduate of Cody High. \n\"I just don't get it. … If I was to tell someone the stories of what I've been through, they would be so traumatized. I hear gunshots every night. I hear them every night. It just makes me strive to do better, to be something better.\" \nKarlen said he was a troubled kid. \n\"I used to be in a little gang,” he said. “I used to do all types of stupid stuff because I thought that was cool. ... Gangs used to come and try and fight us, and they were grown men, 18 and up. We were 13. \n\"I'm not really proud of it. I got myself together. I realized it wasn't the right thing to do. My cousins and my friends used to do bad stuff, and it just drew me in.\" \nRhionna Woolfolk, a 16-year-old senior at Michigan Collegiate , said violence is one of the biggest hurdles to growing up in Detroit. Wolfolk lives close to the downtown area, near Mack and Rivard within walking distance of Eastern Market. \nA friend with whom she went to elementary and middle school was killed last year after playing basketball with some friends. \n\"His name was Pierre,\" Rhionna said. \"I saw everyone on Instagram saying, 'RIP' to him. ... His grandma lived, like, eight houses away from me, so I went over and asked what happened to him. He got shot over a basketball game. His team beat the other team, and they were arguing. A guy shot Pierre in the head four times over a basketball game. ... It's something you just don’t come to terms with. \nA lot of stuff happens over misunderstandings, she said. \"They don’t seem to understand the repercussions, but it's just not fair for young people — or people, period — to get killed over stuff that could have, and should have, been resolved differently.\" \nXochitl Salazar, who lives in southwest Detroit on Springwells, said crime has also impacted her neighborhood, as recently as last week. \n\"My neighbor got robbed, so I think we always (have a fear),\" Xochitl,17, said. \"We can't even walk to school because something can happen. We always have to protect ourselves and watch our backs.\" \nJoi Arnold, 17, a Cass Technical High School senior, said she believes the city needs to be proactive in reaching out to youths about violence.

(Photo: Brian Kaufman, Detroit Free Press) \n\"I feel we wait too long to start to work on a solution,\" Joi said. \"There are neighborhoods that have leaders and if those people come together, I feel like that’s where things would begin to change.\" Love and dreams \nStill, she hasn't given up on the city. \nJoi has big dreams. \nDreams of becoming a behavioral analyst for the FBI. And dreams of coming back one day to Detroit, the city she loves. \n\"When it comes time to raise my kids, I want them to be in Detroit,\" she said. \"Detroit makes some of the strongest players …That's what I really love about Detroit.” \nCass Tech student Le’Elle Davis said growing up in the city has many perks — food and people among them. \n\"I just see Detroit in a way better place in the next 10 to 20 years,\" Le’Elle, 16, said. \"I wouldn’t trade my experiences here. Being from Detroit, it's kind of a motivational thing. You see all these people that have gotten out of the city, come back and have provided so many opportunities for others. You want to be like that.\" Buy Photo \nLe'Elle Davis, 16, a senior a Cass Tech High School in Detroit, wishes others could see what she sees. She's with 17-year-old Chance Carson of Detroit. (Photo: Brian Kaufman, Detroit Free Press) \nSoutheastern High School student Michol White said the city is filled with people who are trying to make a difference. \n\"I like living in Detroit because I know my city,\" Michol,14, said. \"I couldn't live anywhere else.\" \nCarlito Smith said he believes Detroit has a lot of raw, untapped talent. \n\"I think if people had that upbringing where they wouldn't accept anything less than excellent, we would have so many more good things come out (of) the city,\" Carlito, 16, said. \n\"We have a lot of great artists, musicians, athletes and a lot of very intelligent people, but they don’t see themselves that way, for whatever reason. \n\"But Detroit, it’s my home, so I love it. When people ask, 'Why do you like Detroit? Why do you like it?' I say, 'It's because it's just your home.' There doesn’t have to be a reason. Detroit is my home.\" \nContact Katrease Stafford: kstafford@freepress.com or 313-223-4759. \nReporter Kristi Tanner and photographer Elaine Cromie contributed to this report. 1 CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://on.freep.com/2g9A1UZ More Stories",

(Photo: Jayne Kamin-Oncea, USA TODAY Spor) \nPASADENA, Calif. — Sam Darnold passed for 267 yards and hit De'Quan Hampton for two touchdowns, leading No. 19 Southern California past UCLA 36-14 Saturday night in the Los Angeles rivals' 86th crosstown showdown. \nRonald Jones II rushed for 121 yards and two TDs for the surging Trojans (8-3, 7-2 Pac-12), who won their seventh straight game after a dismal start to the season. \nUSC claimed the Victory Bell for the second consecutive year, overcoming Darnold's two early interceptions and eventually taking apart UCLA's solid defense for 527 total yards. \nJordan Lasley caught two first-half touchdown passes from Mike Fafaul for UCLA (4-7, 2-6). After five losses in their last six games, the Bruins are assured their first losing season in coach Jim Mora's half-decade in charge. \nUtah's loss to Oregon earlier Saturday also kept the Trojans in the Pac-12 South race. A few hours after USC finishes the regular season next Saturday against Notre Dame, the Trojans would claim the division title if the Utes beat No. 12 Colorado, which lost at USC last month. \nTen years after UCLA stunned USC 13-9 and knocked Pete Carroll's team out of the national title race, coach Clay Helton's Trojans calmly beat their rivals for the 14th time in 18 meetings. Snap judgments from college football's Week 12 \nWith both teams wearing their home jerseys on a chilly night at the Rose Bowl, USC extended its longest overall winning streak since Carroll's last conference championship season in 2008. \nHelton also improved to 2-0 in the crosstown showdown: He got the permanent job last year two days after the Trojans' 40-21 victory over the Bruins and Mora, who had won his first three against USC. \nUSC went through the UCLA defense for 326 yards in the first half, just 30 yards shy of the Bruins' average yield for entire games this season. The Trojans eventually held the ball for 43:47 and ran 95 plays to UCLA's 51. \nDarnold provided his usual cocktail of brilliance and exciting flaws, throwing two interceptions in the first half amid a series of stunning athletic runs and throws. The redshirt freshman hasn't lost since his debut start at Utah in September, leading the Trojans back into contention with his freewheeling skills. \nBut the Bruins held an early 14-7 lead. Lasley took a mid-range pass 56 yards for a score in the opening moments, and he beat Adoree Jackson in 1-on-1 coverage early in the second quarter, right after Fabian Moreau returned Darnold's first interception inside the USC 10. Turning point \nUSC faced a deficit after the first quarter for the first time since its winning streak began, but Jones fixed that with his second TD run, bursting around the end for a spectacular 60-yard score. Hampton then made his first career TD catch with an exceptional 31-yard grab by the seldom-used sophomore. The takeaway \nUCLA: The Bruins have endured a miserable second half after quarterback Josh Rosen's season-ending injuries, but the defense has fought in every game. The overmatched offense kept it close early, but a thorough offseason recalibration seems vital. \nUSC: The Trojans just keep getting more dangerous, even if it might be too late to win the Pac-12 South. Along with Jones' latest big game, Darnold and Hampton made key plays against a defense that had allowed only eight TD catches all season. And it's no surprise that Darnold, the unflappable Orange County native, easily handled the road pressure in his first LA rivalry matchup. Up next \nUCLA: A trip to Berkeley for a rather drab season finale against California. \nUSC: The famed intersectional rivalry game with Notre Dame at the Coliseum on Saturday to wrap up the regular season. \nBEST OF WEEK 12 A link has been posted to your Facebook feed.

      "text": "(Before It's News)\nBIN NOTE: If by now you haven’t figured out that Facebook and Google are in cahoots with the corrupt government, then I feel for you, but for those who are well aware of the issues it’s high time you switched over to Seen.life . It is a website that is similar to Facebook but without all the censorship.\nAn interview with Katy Whelan by Dave Hodges, former CSS Health Reporter, Prepared for The Common Sense Show This is the best researched article on the topic of medical marijuana. Government has known of marijuana’s healing properties for 30 years and covering up the facts http://www.naturalnews.com/049651_medicinal_marijuana_federal_government_street_meth.html\n(NaturalNews) There’s a massive deception taking place at both the state and federal levels of American government as it pertains to the possession and use of all-natural cannabis, or as it is more commonly known, marijuana. As it turns out, the federal government, which still claims that there’s absolutely no medicinal use for cannabis, quietly holds two patents on cannabis as medicine , a specious hypocrisy and tyrannical affront to health and medical freedom in this so-called republic.\nFor more than 30 years, in fact, the Feds have known full well that cannabis contains unique cannabinoid compounds and antioxidants that act as natural neuroprotectants, protecting the human brain and body against disease.\nCannabis oil cures man’s cancer after he was given 18 months to live: why real cancer cures are always outlawed http://www.naturalnews.com/051009_marijuana_cancer_cure_cannabis.html\n(NaturalNews) A 33-year-old father from the U.K. is completely cancer-free, but not because of chemotherapy or radiation. David Hibbitt’s doctors diagnosed him with a “terminal” case of bowel cancer that they said would kill him within 18 months, but he successfully eliminated this cancer on his own by taking therapeutic doses of cannabis oil at a cost of about $75 per month. Father arrested in Australia for successfully treating his dying cancer-ridden toddler with cannabis oil\nhttp://www.naturalnews.com/048297_cannabis_oil_natural_medicine_Australia.html\nThe doctors at Lady Cliento Children’s Hospital claimed that there was a 50 percent chance of her recovery with conventional therapy, which started with surgery and is continuing with an 8- to 12-month series of chemotherapy treatments.\nAdam had decided to find and use medical-grade cannabis to help Rumer Rose recover. Adam claims he was just using high-CBD and low- or no-THC cannabis oil as an adjunct to “increase her chances of survival beyond 50 percent.” [2]\nBut Adam was surprised beyond what he had expected with Rumer Rose’s improvement from the medical-grade marijuana. He reported on his Facebook page “Fearless Father” that “Her cancer-ridden little body was ALIVE AGAIN – Rumer had almost instant quality of life.”\nCan cannabis prevent or reverse Alzheimer’s? http://www.naturalnews.com/049789_medical_cannabis_Alzheimers_dementia_remedies.html\n(NaturalNews) You’ve probably read about the positive effects of coconut oil’s medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs) to produce ketones that energize brain cells with dysfunctional brain metabolism and even reverse Alzheimer’s disease (AD).\nAlzheimer’s rate of occurrence has increased exponentially over the past few decades and has positioned itself near the elite disease killers of heart disease and cancer.\nThere are also herbs from Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) and Ayurveda that are helpful, while Big Pharma flounders with toxic failures to create a profitable Alzheimer’s pharmaceutical that might help more than harm. And now there may be another effective non-pharmaceutical solution to add: Cannabis\nhttp://www.naturalnews.com/049789_medical_cannabis_Alzheimers_dementia_remedies.html\nPharmaceutical painkiller deaths drop 25% in states with medical marijuana according to study http://www.naturalnews.com/049671_medical_marijuana_prescription_painkillers_opioids.htm l\n(NaturalNews) Groundbreaking research published in the respected journal JAMA Internal Medicine has revealed new benefits to the denouement of marijuana prohibition throughout the U.S. It turns out that states where medical cannabis use is no longer a criminal offense are reporting substantially fewer deaths associated with pharmaceutical painkiller use, suggesting that more people in legalized states are turning to the safe cannabis herb for pain relief rather than Big Pharma’s death pills.\nMan who treated stage III COPD with cannabis off all meds and back to work full time http://www.naturalnews.com/048001_chronic_obstructive_pulmonary_disease_cannabis_oil_medical_marijuana.html\n(NaturalNews) Back in April of 2014, this author presented an article about how cannabis is very helpful for COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease). The story of Jeff Waters, diagnosed with stage III COPD at the age of 36, was featured in that article. Some may wonder how he’s doing now\nJeff was on 15 pharmaceuticals including COPD drugs, high blood pressure meds and drugs for depression, anxiety, aggression, high cholesterol, insomnia and pain. Acute upper respiratory disease is a black box warning on some of them\nThough residing in a non-medical marijuana state, Jeff managed to get his hands on FECO (full-extract cannabis oil) made with full-spectrum cannabis that includes THC and uses grain alcohol as the solvent. He managed to get up to a half gram twice dailyJeff proudly states, “Now my inhalers and nebulizers collect dust in storage and I sold my oxygen concentrator and I walk every day and occasionally jog. I no longer set limits on what exercise or anything else I can do!”\nAs with most COPD cases, Jeff couldn’t work and was on disability. He wanted to go back to work but had to be selective. Many work places do drug checks and don’t understand marijuana’s medicinal properties, especially in a non-medical marijuana state. He’s proud to report that he’s working full time now, in a local grocery store\nTerminal stage IV lung cancer patient miraculously cured by cannabis oil http://www.naturalnews.com/047924_lung_cancer_cannabis_oil_medical_marijuana.html\n(NaturalNews) An Australian woman in her mid-50s recently posted a YouTube video explaining how she has eliminated her stage IV lung cancer with cannabis after being given a death sentence of six months with no treatment. Her oncologist suggested chemo as an option, but it wouldn’t cure her cancer. It would only prolong her life a few months with chemo side effects.\nTo protect her anonymity, she refers to everyone by title (husband, oncologist, etc), but she displays before and after PET scans in the video to prove that cannabis did indeed remove all traces of lung cancer within three months\nCannabis dissolves cancerous tumor in young infant, deemed a ‘miracle baby’ by physician http://www.naturalnews.com/046994_cannabis_cancerous_tumors_miracle_baby.html\n(NaturalNews) Instead of opting for chemotherapy and radiation in an attempt to shrink an inoperable brain tumor, the father of an eight-month-old baby pushed for alternative treatment with cannabis oil. The baby’s physician, Dr. William Courtney, was initially skeptical early in his career about cannabis as medicine but has since seen such impressive results that he’s now a staunch advocate for its use.\n“They were putting cannabinoid oil on the baby’s pacifier twice a day, increasing the dose… And within two months there was a dramatic reduction, enough that the pediatric oncologist allowed them to go ahead with not pursuing traditional therapy,” said Dr. Courtney in an interview with The Huffington Post .\nAt four months, the tumor was completely gone. And after eight months of treatment, the brain tissue was considered completely normal\n Cannabis kicks Lyme disease to the curb http://www.naturalnews.com/043834_cannabis_Lyme_disease_medical_marijuana.html\nWith Lyme disease, there are so many symptoms, so many debilitating, agonizing manifestations, that it’s often misdiagnosed as multiple sclerosis, chronic fatigue, lupus or a mental issue.\nLyme disease is caused by a spirochetal bacteria of the Borrelia genus. Spirochetes are composed of about 40% DNA and have double-membrane envelopes that make them difficult to trace and kill. They’re apparently able to hide in deep tissue and change shapes to disguise their identities.\nGoing through the medical system with Lyme disease is like being a ball in an old fashioned pinball game machine. Being on antibiotics forever is risking serious adverse events or at least reducing one’s immunity to invite all sorts of other complications.\nAll this without a complete cure. But now there is considerable hope with cannabis.\nShelly White’s Lyme disease was so debilitating that she had endured at least 10 seizures daily for a year and a half. She began smoking marijuana from a pipe and then switched to inhaling it through a vaporizer. Just from that, her seizures had stopped. Then she decided to go to the next level of using cannabis oil.\nAfter a month of the oil, she was able to return to work and school. At the time of writing her story, she was happy to announce that she could now move out and live on her own and enjoy a normal social life. [2]\nCannabis oil cures terminal cancer in 3-year-old after pharmaceutical drugs fail miserably http://www.naturalnews.com/051881_cannabis_oil_cancer_treatment_Big_Pharma.html\n(NaturalNews) A 3 year-old Utah boy, diagnosed with leukemia and told by doctors that he had mere days to live, is now alive and well not because he continued his chemotherapy, but because he obtained cannabis oil treatment instead. (1)\nThe family, fed up with the fact that the only treatment doctors could recommend was chemotherapy–even after little Landon Riddle kept vomiting dozens of times daily and refused to eat after two months of chemo–looked into cannabis oil treatment. After reading up about it online and researching the details, they traveled to Colorado where such a treatment is legal, to help Landon. (1)\nRead this story entire story. The video, which can be viewed in this article here , explains that the family was initially given an ultimatum: continue years of chemo and steroid treatments or refuse it, and potentially have Landon removed from their care. A lawyer willing to take on the case stepped in, expressing his thoughts that there is nothing detrimental about the family’s intentions.\nBut rather than give in to a death sentence and play into Big Pharma’s only recommendation, Landon began cannabis oil treatments. The results have been incredible. (1)\nWithin just days of the treatment, Landon showed signs of improvement. Instead of withering away, his appetite surged and his vomiting lessened. He rebounded, and as explained on a CNN video, is still cancer -free even months later. (1)\nRick Simpson and Race From The Cure video. PLEASE WATCH AND PASS THIS ON!\nhttp://phoenixtears.ca/\nPlease watch the video I have posted on my blog . Race from the cure. How a man named Rick Simpson procured a method of distillation of Cannabis oil and it’s been curing cancer in countless people. He went through hell helping people in his community and having amazing success and the Canadian government shut him down and for all intents and purposes chased him out of Canada. You may have trouble finding the video as the powers that be are doing everything they can do rid the internet of this video.. I found a version so please watch this and pass it on.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaSwtEbioNk\n20 Studies That Prove Cannabis Can Cure Cancer http://www.activistpost.com/2013/08/20-studies-that-prove-cannabis-can-cure.html\nBrain Cancer 1. A study published in the British Journal of Cancer , conducted by the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology at Complutense University in Madrid, this study determined that Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and other cannabinoids inhibit tumour growth. They were responsible for the first clinical study aimed at assessing cannabinoid antitumoral action. Cannabinoid delivery was safe and was achieved with zero psychoactive effects. THC was found to decrease tumor cells in two out of the nine patients.\n2. A study published in The Journal of Neuroscience examined the biochemical events in both acute neuronal damage and in slowly progressive, neurodegenerative diseases. They conducted a magnetic resonance imaging study that looked at THC (the main active compound in marijuana) and found that it reduced neuronal injury in rats. The results of this study provide evidence that the cannabinoid system can serve to protect the brain against neurodegeneration.\n3. A study published in The Journal of Pharmacology And Experimental Therapeutics already acknowledged the fact that cannabinoids have been shown to possess antitumor properties. This study examined the effect of cannabidiol (CBD, non psychoactive cannabinoid compound) on human glioma cell lines. The addition of cannabidiol led to a dramatic drop in the viability of glioma cells. Glioma is the word used to describe brain tumor. The study concluded that cannabidiol was able to produce a significant antitumor activity.\n4. A study published in the journal Molecular Cancer Therapeutics outlines how brain tumors are highly resistant to current anticancer treatments, which makes it crucial to find new therapeutic strategies aimed at improving the poor prognosis of patients suffering from this disease. This study also demonstrated the reversal of tumor activity in Glioblastoma multiforme.\nBreast Cancer 5. A study published in the US National Library of Medicine , conducted by the California Pacific Medical Centre determined that cannabidiol (CBD) inhibits human breast cancer cell proliferation and invasion. They also demonstrated that CBD significantly reduces tumor mass.\n6. A study published in The Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics determined that THC as well as cannabidiol dramatically reduced breast cancer cell growth. They confirmed the potency and effectiveness of these compounds.\n7. A study published in the journal Molecular Cancer showed that THC reduced tumor growth and tumor numbers. They determined that cannabinoids inhibit cancer cell proliferation, induce cancer cell apoptosis and impair tumor angiogenesis (all good things). This study provides strong evidence for the use of cannabinoid based therapies for the management of breast cancer.\n8. A study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America (PNAS) determined that cannabinoids inhibit human breast cancer cell proliferation. Lung Cancer 9. A study published in the journal Oncogene , by Harvard Medical School’s Experimental Medicine Department determined that THC inhibits epithelial growth factor induced lung cancer cell migration and more. They go on to state that THC should be explored as novel therapeutic molecules in controlling the growth and metastasis of certain lung cancers.\n10. A study published by the US National Library of Medicine by the Institute of Toxicology and Pharmacology, from the Department of General Surgery in Germany determined that cannabinoids inhibit cancer cell invasion. Effects were confirmed in primary tumor cells from a lung cancer patient. Overall, data indicated that cannabinoids decrease cancer cell invasiveness.\n11. A study published by the US National Library of Medicine , conducted by Harvard Medical School investigated the role of cannabinoid receptors in lung cancer cells. They determined its effectiveness and suggested that it should be used for treatment against lung cancer cells. Prostate Cancer\n12. A study published in the US National Library of Medicine illustrates a decrease in prostatic cancer cells by acting through cannabinoid receptors. 13. A study published in the US National Library of Medicine outlined multiple studies proving the effectiveness of cannabis on prostate cancer.\n14. Another study published by the US National Library of Medicine determined that clinical testing of CBD against prostate carcinoma is a must. That cannabinoid receptor activation induces prostate carcinoma cell apoptosis. They determined that cannabidiol significantly inhibited cell viability.\nBlood Cancer\n15. A study published in the journal Molecular Pharmacology recently showed that cannabinoids induce growth inhibition and apoptosis in mantle cell lymphoma. The study was supported by grants from the Swedish Cancer Society, The Swedish Research Council and the Cancer Society in Stockholm.\n16. A study published in the International Journal of Cancer also determined and illustrated that cannabinoids exert antiproliferative and proapoptotic effects in various types of cancer and in mantle cell lymphoma.\n17. A study published in the US National Library of Medicine conducted by the Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology by Virginia Commonwealth University determined that cannabinoids induce apoptosis in leukemia cells.\nOral Cancer 18. A study published by the US National Library of Medicine results show cannabinoids are potent inhibitors of cellular respiration and are toxic to highly malignant oral tumors. Liver Cancer 19. A study published by the US National Library of Medicine determined that that THC reduces the viability of human HCC cell lines (Human hepatocellular liver carcinoma cell line) and reduced the growth. Pancreatic Cancer 20. A study published in The American Journal of Cancer determined that cannabinoid receptors are expressed in human pancreatic tumor cell lines and tumor biopsies at much higher levels than in normal pancreatic tissue. Results showed that cannabinoid administration induced apoptosis. They also reduced the growth of tumor cells, and inhibited the spreading of pancreatic tumor cells.\nPODCAST FOR THE SHOW BIN NOTE: If by now you haven’t figured out that Facebook and Google are in cahoots with the corrupt government, then I feel for you, but for those who are well aware of the issues it’s high time you switched over to Seen.life .

They always have your back no matter what. Just take a look at TK. She is just a baby and can barely speak but that doesn’t stop her in any way to protect her big sister from trouble.\nThis video shared by Melissa Nunez shows a toddler standing up for her elder sister Emma when their mother pretends to scold her. Not only does she yell at her mom to stop but even strikes her arm with her small fist in a bid to stop her.\nOne thing’s for sure. Little TK can definitely be counted on in case her sister needs any help.",

      "text": "STOCKTON, Calif.—Last year, a retired Stockton police sergeant named Gabe Herrera was looking into the sale of unlicensed food . Working as an undercover investigator (“Robert Paine”) for the San Joaquin County District Attorney, Herrera joined a Facebook group called “209 Food Spot.” (209 refers to the area code in this part of central California.)\nIn early 2015, the San Joaquin County Environmental Health Department had received complaints about unlicensed food being sold on 209 Food Spot. One person even said they got sick as a result. So, the EHD, as a responsible county agency, decided to investigate.\nUnlike an unlicensed taco stand or another unlicensed food business that operates on the street and can easily be shut down, getting ahold of 209 Food Spot was trickier. Nearly everyone was cooking and selling from their own homes. The EHD contacted multiple sellers directly, warning them that they did not have adequate permits. But these warnings had little, if any, effect on the Facebook group. The EHD stepped up its game by sending letters to some of the sellers. Those warnings were ignored, too.\nBy December 2015, Sgt. Herrera decided to go after six different women, chosen at random from 209 Food Spot. One of those women was Mariza Ruelas, a 37-year-old single mother of six children. Posing as Paine, Herrera went to Ruelas’ house, handed over $12, and walked away with .32oz of ceviche. (He did not respond to Ars’ request for comment.)\nSix months later, in June 2016, Ruelas and five other women received a court summons for their arraignment to face state-level misdemeanor criminal charges for operating a food facility without a valid permit and engaging in business without a permit to sell . None of them were amongst those who had received prior warnings from the EHD.\nThe other five women were offered plea deals of a year of probation, 40 hours of community service, and $250 in fines. They immediately accepted. Ruelas, by contrast, was initially offered three years probation and 80 hours of community service. She was the only one who requested a lawyer and was provided a public defender.\n“I asked for representation because I felt that the punishment was a little harsh for the crime in question,” she told Ars over coffee following her November 17 hearing in county court.\nNot long after, the prosecutor then tacked on two additional counts: an alleged health and safety violation and an alleged tax violation. According to court filings, by late July 2016, Ruelas had even moved to a new, secret Facebook group called “Taste of 209,” where she and others continued to sell food.\n“It would be negligent for our office to ignore it,” Supervising Deputy District Attorney Robert Himelblau said during a November 9 press conference in Stockton . “We did not send anybody out there to go hunt people down. We are not trying to prevent people from cooking or sharing or potlucks or anything like that.”\nIn a press release , the DA’s office noted that the “Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that 48 million persons get sick, 128,000 are hospitalized, and 3,000 die from foodborne infection and illness in the US each year.”\nRuelas has been assigned a December 2 trial date, and she faces additional charges for allegedly thwarting the law. Ruelas could face a maximum penalty of two years in prison, but District Attorney Kelly McDaniel has repeatedly said she is not seeking jail time. ( According to the FBI , Stockton, a city of about 300,000 people approximately 80 miles east of San Francisco, has one of the highest rates of violent crime in California.)\nDuring the November 17 hearing, McDaniel told the court that her office had recently received and executed a search warrant for the contents of Ruelas’ Facebook account and messages she left on 209 Food Spot and other related groups. The social network recently coughed up over 72,000 pages of Ruelas’ Facebook records. The DA has since shared them with Benjamin Hall, Ruelas’ public defender, as part of the discovery process. Hall said he has had scant time to review them.\nCrime and punishment Since 2013, California has had a “cottage food” law , which formalizes the sale of some approved baked products, including breads, cookies, pastas, confections, and other items, to be sold locally (ceviche, which is made from raw fish that has been cured instead of cooked, is one of many items not on the approved list). After passing a short training, home cooks are allowed to sell.\nDavid LeBeouf, a Stockton lawyer who has been involved in numerous food-related legal cases but is not representing Ruelas, said he had never heard of a case quite like this one.\n“This to me is the biggest waste of time and the people's energy,” he told Ars. “Tell her not to, and if she still does it and still does it after maybe the third time, then slap her hand.”\nHe wondered how the law should treat ad hoc community food sales.\n“It’s like when schools or churches have a drive with tri-tip dinners, do they have to get permits or licenses? It happens once or twice a year, and they are clearly selling food on a small-time basis. How do you differentiate?”\nLeBeouf said if citizens want to buy unlicensed food off of Facebook, they should accept the risk.\n\"Come on, man, leave the woman alone,\" he said.\nSince Ruelas lawyered up, McDaniel has since reduced the plea deal so that Ruelas would only have to do 80 hours of community service as part of a “plea in abeyance.” That arrangement would dismiss all her charges and sentencing as long as she does not break the law for a year after completing her community service. Ruelas would not have a criminal record at all.\n“We’re not throwing the book at her, we’re not throwing her in jail,” McDaniel told Ars, noting that as a prosecutor she could seek thousands of dollars in fines and at least a year of jail time.\nBut Ruelas has refused to go along with this. She argued that, while she and the other women on the Facebook group did take small amounts of money for their food, they weren’t actually doing much more than covering their costs.\n“Trying to run a business is not something we were doing,” Ruelas said, explaining that others were selling phở, lumpia, barbeque, cheesecake, and other items.\nShe explained that oftentimes she would make large dinners for her family. Sometimes, she would sell the leftovers, which were often Latin American dishes like pozole and ceviche. By her own estimation, she was only selling a few times per month.\n“They got to eat, and I got my money back for what I put into it. A lot of times I would post stuff and no one would comment,” she explained, meaning it wouldn’t sell.\nYour tax dollars at work Enlarge Cyrus Farivar Ruelas said that as someone who volunteers in her community and may seek more formal employment in the future, she doesn’t want a criminal record, even a brief one. As of now, she noted, her primary source of income is government assistance.\n“I was willing to do community service, and the fine, but the misdemeanor, no, I didn't want that on my record,” she said.\nSo Ruelas is continuing to fight. She maintains that she did not actually violate the law.\nMeanwhile, the prosecutor doesn’t seem to be backing down anytime sooner, citing the rise of unlicensed food sales online.\n“It’s becoming a big issue, that’s why Environmental Health decided to go after it,” McDaniel said, explaining that if someone did get sick or even died as a result, county health inspectors would be considered derelict in their duty to protect the public.\n“They saw this growing, and their interest is always the public’s health and safety. When they see this volume of sales going on, and this risk to the community they feel they have to do something. This Facebook group was growing exponentially very quickly.”\nSpeaking to Ars by phone on Thursday, McDaniel seemed baffled that Ruelas had not simply accepted the plea deal—a deal that she still could accept all the way up until the trial.\n“Our interest is to resolve these cases. Trials are expensive. We feel that we have given a really reasonable offer in this case,” McDaniel said. “A plea in abeyance is the best deal you can get around here, except for a dismissal. It’s a pretty good deal!”\nRuelas, for her part, said that she's no longer selling, but still loves to cook. “I’m not going to stop sharing my food with people that love it,\" she said.\nRuelas’ next court date, set for November 23, is the final hearing prior to her December 2 trial.",

      "title": "Dez Bryant Brags On Cowboys’ Chemistry, And Leans On It, Too",
      "text": "Follow The Fan: Facebook | Twitter \n\nFRISCO (AP) — Dez Bryant hesitated to talk about playing a day after the death of his father, and preferred not to try to add anything to Tony Romo’s heartfelt statement about the quarterback situation in Dallas. \nThe Cowboys’ star receiver had already drained enough emotion on the field in a wild win at Pittsburgh, less than a week after his passionate reminder that critics didn’t think he’d still be around six years after he slid in the draft because of concerns over character. \nTo try to get Bryant talking, someone offered a description of his game against the Steelers , when he had six catches for 116 yards and a 50-yard touchdown that ended with him in tears on his knees in the end zone rather than in his customary “X” pose. \n“It was cool,” the 2014 All-Pro said, smiling as the brief answer stopped, drawing laughter from reporters. \nThere is another way to get Bryant going these days. Ask about the chemistry he’s been raving about for weeks on a team with the NFL’s best record (8-1) heading into Sunday’s game against AFC North-leading Baltimore (5-4). \nBryant wasn’t expecting that bond to affect him this personally, though. Not until he had to play so soon after finding out his father died, and while the team was on the road. \n“If I didn’t have my teammates or that type of vibe — if we didn’t have this type of vibe in the locker room — I don’t think I could’ve played in that game, to be honest,” Bryant said. “These guys are amazing.” \nThe scene in the end zone was rare for the normally demonstrative Bryant, who is tied with teammate Jason Witten with 62 career touchdowns, third in club history and nine shy of Hall of Famer Bob Hayes’ record. The full embrace with coach Jason Garrett is what stood out on the sideline. \n“I love Dez Bryant,” Garrett said. “Anyone who has had a chance to be around him loves him the same. He believes strongly in developing relationships with people around him. He loves this football team. He loves his teammates. It’s hard not to feel the same way about him.” \nBryant believes team chemistry helped ease the transition to rookie Dak Prescott, who has won eight straight games and is keeping the quarterback job even though Romo, the 10-year starter, is ready to play following a presaeason back injury. Romo has been the guy on the other end of most of Bryant’s 434 catches and 6,223 yards in his career. \nWhen Bryant offered enthusiastic updates on Romo’s recovery from the broken bone in his back from a preseason game, some interpreted it as his desire to get Romo back on the field. But Bryant had been clear from early in the season that he thought Prescott could be something special. \nPundits seized on Bryant’s pair of one-catch games with Prescott. Yet he also has three 100-yard games in the six he has played; Bryant missed three games with a knee injury. \n“I feel like I have been misunderstood for so long,” said Bryant, who had off-field issues early in his career and several emotional outbursts on the sidelines. “I’m really not supposed to be in the league right now, according to a lot of people. But I’m here. A lot of people try to say I’m a ‘me, me, me’ guy. That’s never been. That’s not how I was taught.” \nAnd he believes that has something to do with why he is still in the league, and signed his big contract. \nI genuinely care about people,” he said. “I’ve been around a lot of hate in my life. That’s something I try my best to eliminate every day. Like I said, I’m no longer interested in trying to get people to see who I am.” \nWitten, in his 14th season and the Dallas leader in career receptions, is among those who have tangled with Bryant in sideline episodes through the years. Those incidents never seemed to spill into the locker room during the week, and they’re less frequent. \n“That’s one of the relationships that I’ve cherished the most over the last seven years,” Witten said. “We talk about it all the time, but when you can have an impact like that and see a guy come along on the field, the skill set he brings, how competitive he is and then the growth that goes with it, he’s a brother of mine.” \nBryant felt that bond more than ever last weekend. \n(© Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.   rewritten or redistributed.)",

      "text": "Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg. Robert Galbraith/Reuters \nMore than a billion people use Facebook every single day. \nIt's the app you likely spend the majority of your time using on your phone or the website you pull up more than you care to admit. Whether you're finding the latest news or trying to stay in touch with friends, checking Facebook can become an addictive habit. \nWe've collected some of the best tips and tricks you may not know about — from hiding people you don't want to see on Facebook to managing notifications. \nIt's time to start using Facebook like a pro: See something interesting in your News Feed but don't have time to look at it now? You can save it for later. Tech Insider \nYour bookmarked links, videos, photos, places, and more are accessible from the \"Saved\" page on your Facebook profile . The page is included under the \"More\" tab in the Facebook mobile app. \nPerfect for saving all of Business Insider's amazing articles for later. Turn your profile pic into an animated GIF. Vimeo \nFrom the Facebook mobile app, select your profile picture and then \"Take a New Profile Video\" to upload a short video loop of yourself. The result looks like a mix between an animated GIF and a moving picture straight out of \"Harry Potter\" . Stories with this little lightning bolt are displayed in Facebook's Instant Articles format, which will will typically load faster and show fewer ads. Business Insider \nFacebook Instant Articles are native to the social network, which means that they load directly in the Facebook iPhone app with a clean, minimal layout. Dozens of media outlets (including Business Insider) are sharing Instant Articles, and Facebook claims that stories published in its format load up to ten times faster. \nIf a story is an Instant Article, you'll see a little lightning icon in the bottom left of the story thumbnail. Turn off auto-playing videos in your News Feed. Tech Insider \nIf you don't want videos on Facebook automatically playing when you scroll past them in your News Feed, make sure to turn the setting off. \nUnder the far right tab in the Facebook mobile app, tap Settings and then \"Account Settings.\" From there select \"Videos and Photos.\" You can choose to auto-play videos over cellular and Wi-Fi connections, just Wi-Fi, or never. Unfollow people you don't want to see in your News Feed but don't want to completely unfriend. Tech Insider \nIf you want to stop seeing someone's posts in your News Feed but don't have the guts to completely unfriend them, you can unfollow them to hide their activity. \nFrom someone's profile in the Facebook mobile app, tap on \"Following\" under their profile picture and then \"Unfollow\" to get rid of their posts completely. On the desktop site, click the drop-down arrow to the right of a post to unfollow a person. See your Facebook activity on the same day from years past. Facebook \nFacebook's \"On This Day\" feature shows your activity on its social network on the same day from years past. Think of it like your personal time capsule on Facebook. \nOnly you see your \"On This Day\" activity, and you can find the feature from the link Facebook.com/onthisday . Facebook also lets you hide certain people from showing up in your past activity , which is helpful for not seeing memories of your ex. Your Activity Log shows everything you've liked, shared, and commented on in the past. Business Insider \nYour Activity Log on Facebook documents all of your activity on the social network. It's easily accessible on your profile from both the mobile app and desktop site. Select profiles and pages you never want to miss updates from in your News Feed. Facebook \nIf there are certain people or pages you want to see first in your News Feed no matter what, you can select them in the Facebook mobile app. \nTap \"Settings\" under the app's \"More\" tab and then \"News Feed Preferences\" to get started. \nPeople and pages you've marked to see first will have a little blue star next to their posts in your feed. Tell people how to pronounce your name correctly. Tech Insider \nSick of people pronouncing your name wrong? You can teach them on Facebook. \nWhile editing your profile on the desktop, go to \"Details About You\" under \"About\" to get started. You can also add a nickname or maiden name for yourself to display with your profile. Know the distinction between a \"friend\" and a \"follower\" on Facebook. Tech Insider \nThere are two ways you can connect with someone on Facebook: by becoming friends with them, and by following them. \nBeing friends means that you and the other person have approved the connection and likely know each other, while following an account means that the person hasn't added you back as a friend. \nWhen someone follows you, they'll only see posts you share publicly. You can turn off the ability for people to follow your account at any time from the \"Followers\" section of your account settings . When you share a post, you can choose to hide it from specific people. Tech Insider \nYour Facebook posts can be shared with your friends, friends and friends of friends, or anyone who views your profile. \nYou can select these sharing options on a case-by-case basis from the drop-down menu at the top right of a post. On the mobile app, select \"Edit Privacy\" and select one of the options. From the desktop, just click the little friends or globe icon next to a post's time stamp. \nIf you want everyone expect a few people to see a post, you can choose to hide it from specific people by selecting \"Friends except...\" on the mobile app and \"Custom\" on the desktop. See what your profile looks like to people who aren't your friends. Tech Insider \nThis is handy for seeing what on your profile is visible to others, including individual friends you may have hidden certain information from in the past. \nWhen you're logged into Facebook on the desktop website, go to your profile, click the ellipsis and then \"View as...\" Hide your list of friends from everyone but you. Tech Insider \nIf for some reason you don't want people seeing who you're friends with, you can hide the list entirely. \nFrom your friends list on the desktop, click the \"Manage\" pen icon on the right and then \"Edit Privacy.\" Then you can change who can see your friends list, the people you follow, and your followers. Hide your relationship-status change from your friends. Tech Insider \nIt could be potentially disastrous for your Facebook friends to see your relationship-status change. The good news is that you can prevent relationship changes from being seen by anyone except you. This means the change won't show up in your friends' News Feeds. \nWhile editing your profile under \"Family and Relationships,\" change the privacy filter to \"Only Me.\" Hide specific photo albums and events on your timeline. Tech Insider \nIf you have certain photo albums you don't want people seeing, but don't feel like deleting them completely, you can hide them so only you can see them on Facebook. The same goes for events in your life, whether they be relationship changes, new jobs, or whatever. \nJust take note of the little gray icon next to a photo album or post. Two little people mean that it can only be seen by your friends, a globe means it's public, and a padlock means only you can see it. Block people from being able to contact you. Tech Insider \nIf someone is spamming you with messages or you just want to make sure they can't see your profile, go to their profile page and click on the three dots to the far right. Select \"Block.\" See everywhere you're logged into Facebook and remotely log out. screenshot \nFrom the Facebook mobile app, tap the far right More tab then Settings, Account Settings, Security, and finally \"Where You're Logged In.\" Tap the \"X\" to remotely log out of any device or Facebook app you're logged into. \nFrom your Security Settings on Facebook's desktop site, the \"Where You're Logged In\" menu shows active logins and lets you end them. Get alerted every time a log-in attempt is made for your account. Tech Insider \nFacebook Login Alerts and Login Approvals can be enabled under Security Settings in the mobile app and desktop site. \nYou can choose to get a Facebook notification or email whenever a log-in is made. Login Approvals mean that you'll have to enter a secondary code sent to your phone before you can log-in to Facebook on a new device. Too many notifications? StackExchange \nYou can customize exactly what kinds of notifications you get from Facebook, all the way down to u pdates for an event you've joined. \nIt gets better: Notifications you want can be customized on the desktop and your phone separately. Go to the \"Notifications\" section of your account settings on the desktop and tweak away. Unsubscribe from notifications for posts you've commented on. Tech Insider \nWe've all probably commented on a post and regretted it later because of the onslaught of notifications that followed from other people commenting. \nYou may not know that you can unsubscribe from activity on any post, which could be a godsend next time you decide to comment on a friend's politically charged opinion. \nWhen you get a notification for a comment or like on a post on Facebook's desktop site, click the \"X\" to the right of the notification and then \"Turn off.\" \nThe reverse is also true. You can turn on notifications for activity on any post from the right drop-down arrow. Turn off birthday reminder notifications. Tech Insider \nIf you're sick of Facebook notifying you about friends' birthdays every day, you can turn the notifications off. \nGo to the notifications tab in your account settings and turn the birthdays option 0ff. Get a notification every time a specific person posts something. Tech Insider \nIf you want to keep tabs on someone's Facebook activity, you can get alerted every time they share something. Just click the \"Friends\" drop-down menu from their profile on Facebook's desktop site and select \"Get Notifications.\" Search for posts and photos liked or commented on by a specific person. Tech Insider \nThis takes stalking to the next level: You can search for posts liked or commented on by one of your friends. Search for specific keywords and topics, not just profiles and pages. Tech Insider \nFacebook lets you search for a lot more than just other peoples' profiles. \nEverything that's publicly shared on the social network is searchable, which means that if you search for something like \"James Bond\" or \"iPhone 8,\" you'll see related posts from news sources, friends, and other pages. Make lists to separate groups of people you're friends with, like school friends and work colleagues. Tech Insider \nDesignating groups within your list of friends can be useful to filter between what everyone is talking about in your News Feed. For instance, you may want to see what everyone from your hometown is sharing or just your friends from college. \nFacebook creates list of friends by default based on common affiliation, whether it be the same hometown, school, etc. On Facebook's desktop site you can see all of your friend lists from this page and add people to them. This creates individual News Feeds within Facebook for you to browse. Give yourself a short bio. Tech Insider \nFacebook lets you create a short bio for yourself that sits above your other profile information, such as city, work, and relationship status. \nYou can edit it at any time from your profile on the desktop site and mobile app. \nPro tip: Make your bio completely out of emojis. Edit a post or comment. Tech Insider \nYour Facebook comments and posts are thankfully not set in stone. Not only can you delete them at any time, but you can also edit them. \nTap the drop-down arrow to the right of one of your posts on the desktop and then hit \"Edit Post.\" When viewing one of your comments, tap the little pencil icon to the right to edit or delete. \nTo edit or delete a comment from the Facebook mobile app, tap and hold on the comment.

      "text": "By Cameron DaSilva \nPublished November 20, 2016 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 Email Print ALLEN PARK, MI - AUGUST 8: DeAndre Levy #54 of the Detroit Lions watches the action during training camp on August 8, 2015 at the Detroit Lions Training Center in Allen Park, Michigan. (Photo by Leon Halip/Getty Images) \nLast week, Detroit Lions linebacker DeAndre Levy revealed that his proudest moment in college was breaking the leg of \"dirtbag\" Joe Paterno . His comments on the late Penn State head coach obviously stemmed from the sexual assault scandal at the university involving Jerry Sandusky, which Paterno said he wasn't aware of.\nLevy's declaration made its rounds on the web as many were taken aback by it, but he expanded on his stance a few days later. In a piece for the Detroit Free Press , which he does regularly, Levy wrote about why he deemed Paterno a \"dirtbag,\" and his thoughts on how sports are prioritized over humanity.\nHere's part of what Levy said:\nMore from FoxSports South Carolina State football team uses 55-year-old running back Joe Thomas Sr. T.J. Watt channels his brother J.J. with this pick-6 FOX Sports Florida Midday Minute 'Plus': Bucs, Jags, Dolphins hit the road Marc Marian is owning Friday | PROCAST I hope me speaking in jest about my \"proudest moment\" doesn't distract from the serious sentiment. Any person or institution, Joe Paterno included, that turns away from or fails to act against sexual assault is a \"dirtbag.\" \nLevy continues to explain his point by putting the Penn State scandal into perspective, making it more personal to readers. He asks them to imagine if it was their \"son, nephew, cousin or young male\" taken advantage of at a football camp, only to have the story break years later.\nLevy added:\nIf you're aware of sexual violence and don't use the full strength of your power to stop it, you're just as complicit and responsible. We have to stop prioritizing sport over humanity and the worse things a person can do, including failing to disrupt DECADES of sexual violence. \nYou can read Levy's full piece for the Detroit Free Press here .",

      "text": "World | Agence France-Presse | Updated: November 20, 2016 23:33 IST EMAIL PRINT COMMENTS Mark Zuckerberg said the world was under threat after Donald Trump's US election win and Brexit. Lima: Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg has called on world leaders to forge a more \"connected\" planet, something he said was under threat after Donald Trump's US election win and Britain's \"Brexit\" vote.Zuckerberg said in a keynote speech yesterday at an Asia-Pacific leaders' summit that while globalisation and interconnectedness have their problems, the world must fight the urge to \"disconnect\".\"As we are learning this year in election after election, even if globalisation might (boost) prosperity, it also creates inequality. It helps some people and it hurts others,\" he said.The 32-year-old billionaire said there was a \"fundamental choice\" to make in reacting to that inequality.\"We can disconnect, risk less prosperity and hope jobs that are lost come back. Or we can connect more, try to do more great things, try to work on even greater prosperity and then work to aggressively share that prosperity with everyone.\"The second option is better, but also harder, he said in his speech at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in Lima, Peru.\"Disconnecting is relatively easy. But connecting requires making big investments in infrastructure and generating the political will to make hard, long-term decisions,\" he said.Facebook has made headlines with its projects on connectivity and internet access.The social network has developed solar-powered drones and a satellite to beam internet service to remote areas.The company has helped more than 40 million people get online, Zuckerberg said.His comments came amid deep global uncertainty in the wake of the unexpected poll results in the US and Britain.Trump and the Brexit camp both appealed to working-class voters who feel threatened by globalisation and immigration, running on a populist politics of disillusionment with an increasingly borderless world.Trump vows to protect American jobs from cheaper labour overseas, while Brexit campaigners promise British workers will fare better outside the European Union than in it.Facebook, the world's largest social network with 1.79 billion users, has been criticised by some as helping Trump to victory by giving a platform to fake election news and extreme-right blogs with untruthful attacks on Trump's opponent Hillary Clinton.Zuckerberg has dismissed claims his company influenced the vote as \"pretty crazy\".

Mentors like Spencer Hill, left, also expose the children to experiences they might not otherwise have. He and Gary Clemons, center, took classmates Tyler and Brendan on a mini-golf outing.

Then, with approval of parents, they offer guidance to help keep the children from dropping out of school, becoming a young parent or getting in trouble with the law. \nThe program has succeeded by many measures. \nOnly a year ago, 11-year-old Steven was having a rough time in school, struggling with math and reading. When he got frustrated, he would kick garbage cans, throw things and walk out of his classroom without permission. \nWith help from the Portland-based organization, Steven today is showing progress and learning how to handle his frustrations and feelings better, said Brian Joy, 36, who has mentored the boy since kindergarten. These days, instead of walking out of class without permission, he asks his teacher for a bathroom pass. \nMentor Spencer Hill shows Tyler, left, and Brendan the ins and outs of mini golf in Portland, Ore., on Tuesday, June 7, 2016. (Photo: Greg Wahl-Stephens/Associated Press) \nMentors like Joy are assigned eight young people and spend four hours a week with each child, in the classroom and in after-school activities or peer-support groups. They do fun outings — camping, trips to the beach, going to the movies, mini golf, eating at restaurants — that the kids likely wouldn’t otherwise have the means to experience. The goal is for kids to have one mentor from kindergarten through fifth grade and another from sixth grade to graduation. \nThe mentors stick with the kids unconditionally, as long as they live within a 30-mile radius of Portland. Many of the mentors have spent their early careers working for children's organizations. They stay with the organization, on average, for seven years. Solutions for our children Chicago program gives teens job opportunities year-round \nThat level of attention and stability has helped Friends turn around the lives of children most at risk of generational poverty and a lack of education and opportunity. Friends leaders say 83% of kids in the program graduate from high school, 98% avoid becoming teen parents and 93% stay out of the legal system — three key measures by which the organization judges success. About half go on to community college or get four-year degrees. \nThe program has expanded from Portland to cities such as New York, Boston and Seattle, providing a level of commitment rare among mentoring programs. \nOn a spring day this year, Joy sat with Steven, whose mom was single but is now married, while students in his fifth-grade classroom took turns reading from “Mrs. Frisby and the Rats of NIMH.\" Steven's classmates take Brian's presence in stride. While some are initially intrigued by the adult mentors who attend classes with kids, they soon become accustomed to their presence, with no stigma attached, mentors say.

Steven used to express frustrations about his home life and struggles with learning by leaving class; now, he has better coping skills. (Photo: Matt Helms/Detroit Free Press) \nJoy knew that the reading exercise would be a pressure point for Steven. \n“One of the strategies I was using in there — because I know that was extremely difficult because it’s fifth-grade level reading — was every fourth word, I would be telling him a word. I knew that wouldn’t be frustrating for him because he likes to be helped,” Joy said. \n“I knew he would get exasperated from reading that much, so when it came to the third page, he was supposed to read, I was like, ‘I’m going to read this part, and all you have to do is follow what I’m saying,’ because I knew he needed a break.” \nIt’s that kind of close relationship and careful mentoring that’s behind the Friends' strong record of results. \nFrom its inception, founder Duncan Campbell said he insisted that the program be evidence-based, with mentors and managers using computerized methods to measure success and progress for each child in the program. Third-party evaluators assess the program’s effectiveness each year, and Friends is at the midpoint of a long-term, randomized, controlled study partly funded by the National Institutes of Health on the long-term outcomes of the program’s work with kids. \nCampbell, a self-made millionaire, said he formed Friends in the Portland neighborhood where he grew up as the child of alcoholic parents on welfare. \n“I was basically neglected,” Campbell said. “My dad was in prison twice and was gone often. I remember having the conscious thought that I would never want a child to have my life.” \nLater, he worked as a childcare worker for juvenile homes in Portland and Eugene, Ore., where he said he learned that by the time kids get into the juvenile justice system, there’s little left that can change their lives. \nCampbell said he started thinking that if those young people had someone in their lives who cared for them — a friend — it could help break the cycle of being poor, dropping out of high school and getting into trouble with the law. \nDuncan Campbell was inspired by his own difficult childhood to create the group. (Photo: Friends of the Children) \nCampbell became a lawyer and a CPA and founded an investment company that made him wealthy. But he said he carried the idea around for years that he could come up with a way to help kids who grew up like he did. \nCampbell said initially, he hired a PhD to look into ways adults could help young people improve their chances at better lives, and the initial research indicated that to create resilience in children, kids needed a long-term role model who shared strong values with them, starting at an early age. \nSo he set about to create a research-based program that today serves more than 1,000 children in the U.S. and in Britain, with goals of expanding to more cities. \n“I was in the investment business,\" Campbell said. \"For me, it’s all about outcomes — measurable outcomes, evidence-based.” \nA stable force when life is crazy \nThat focus on results has won Friends high praise from community leaders in Portland. \nVoters in Portland in 2002 approved a city property tax to support the Portland Children’s Levy, which raises about $15 million a year distributed through competitive grants to proven programs supporting early childhood development, child abuse prevention, hunger relief, academic achievement and family safety and stability. \nWhile Friends is primarily supported by donations from individuals and philanthropies, this year it received $635,000 from the levy and was among the largest recipients, said its director, Lisa Pellegrino. \n“It’s a unique program,” she said. “I’ve been in the business of funding social services for a long time, and I can tell you there’s not much like it.” \nShe described as “unheard-of” two things about Friends: first, the promise of 12 years of mentoring to each child; second, a commitment to stick with kids so long as they stay within a 30-mile radius of Portland, even if families move. That’s critical, she said, because families in poverty tend to be more transient. \nFriends providing “somebody who’s on the side of the child and who can be consistent through whatever other changes are happening is invaluable,” Pellegrino said. “To support the kid and to be able to provide them with some tools to be able to deal with the craziness of their lives, and another adult who’s helping to deal with the adults in the situation, is, I think, crucial.” \nLongtime Friends board member Carolyn Walker, a Portland lawyer who’s a Detroit native and University of Michigan graduate, said her support of the organization was cemented early after she was introduced to it, because of its emphasis on providing stability to children growing up in difficult situations. \n“I’ve not seen another organization that makes this kind of difference,” Walker said. “These kids, most of them come from a very tumultuous home life, so they don’t have a steady foundation.” \nWhat it means to be a Friend \nFriends mentors are trained and paid starting salaries of $35,000-$40,000 a year with full benefits. \nTheir goals are to bond with the children and find their sparks — the things that inspire and interest them. They’re taught social and emotional skills and how to deal with the lives they’ve been given. \nTerri Sorenson, national president of Friends, said it’s about showing the kids how to deal with life in better ways, building an inner resilience so they can handle what happens at home. \nMentors don’t aim to replace parents, but they can take on some of the roles of parents or social workers: helping navigate schools and setting up individualized education programs for students who need extra help or special education in school, finding tutors, arranging counseling and otherwise advocating for what the kids need. \nSorenson said Friends staff go into the schools with the highest levels of poverty or select children from the foster care system. \nThey look for kids who are missing too much school, who come wearing the same clothes every day, who are aggressive or withdrawn, or who were born to teen parents who often didn’t graduate from high school themselves and who sometimes have been incarcerated. Children with the most risk factors are brought into the program. \nOne of the schools is Lincoln Park Elementary in southeast Portland, whose principal, Rebecca Chase, said she’s a strong admirer of Friends and the impact it has on kids in her school. About 20 students there have been paired with a Friends mentor. \nChase said that while some parents may chafe at having their children identified as needing help — and what that may say about their parenting abilities — parents at the school have heard about what Friends does and welcome the support. \nWhen kids are selected and she contacts parents to let them know, “I always tell them it’s like winning the golden ticket,” Chase said. “Friends of the Children wants the same thing as they want for their kid, which is to graduate and to be successful and to not end up in prison and not have kids when they’re 15 and start that same cycle.” \nBenefits for parents and children \nJulie B. is one of the appreciative parents. Her son John, 15, has had a mentor since kindergarten. \nJulie is a mother of three and was addicted to meth for nine years, during which she lost her kids. Today, she’s in recovery and is a substance-abuse counselor with a better life, one she said has been helped by having a Friends mentor for John. \nJulie said John was diagnosed with an attachment disorder — an inability to form lasting relationships — and has had behavioral problems throughout school. \nOver the years, Friends mentors have helped her set up an individualized education program for her son, and they’ve worked with him, along with counselors, on coping skills for dealing with his emotions. Julie said John can give authority figures a hard time, requiring her to try to remain close with teachers to cheer them on in dealing with him. \nIf he gets a bad grade, Julie said, John thinks it means a teacher doesn’t like him, so he won't do homework or pay attention in class. \n“We have to wait through the storm, and when he finally gets a grip,” she said, “we can talk him through it, and then he’ll come back and make up” the work. \nBut he has shown growth. Julie described John as a superstar basketball player at his high school and said he is getting better grades and making plans to attend college. She said John wouldn’t be where he is without his Friends mentor. \nAs a single parent, “I knew that we needed help,” Julie said. John's father is not in his life. \n“I knew I was going to be doing it alone, so I was very grateful for somebody coming and saying, ‘We’re going to give your son a mentor, and he can be here until he’s out of high school.’ It was a relief to me, knowing that I wasn’t going to have to be all alone.” \nJohn has been mentored for the last six months by Spencer Hill, 30, although Hill said he has known John through the Friends programs for years. Hill said the behavioral problems he sees in John now are significantly less than what they were when he was a younger kid. \nHill said he has focused on working with John on his academic performance, which this year led to consequences that John took to heart. His freshman year GPA was about 1.1 early in the year, but by the end of the year, it had improved to 1.8. \nStill, that wasn't good enough to meet eligibility requirements to participate in a summer basketball league he really wanted to join. \n\"It definitely hit him hard, but I was very pleasantly surprised to see him pick himself back up,\" Hill said, adding that he's confident John will continue to do better in school. \n\"That was the most important thing,\" Hill said. \"He was showing an engagement in his academics and understanding the importance of it. It's the understanding for him that academics are going to play a part in the immediate future and the future to come, and for him to understand how sports and academics are connected.\" \nHill said John isn't a kid he worries will get into serious trouble. He said they've had honest conversations about drugs, sex and not running with gangs, and John seems grounded enough not to want to mess up the progress he's making. \n'This person really has my back' \nNatasha Durant has seen Friends from both sides, first as a young person assigned a mentor and later as a mentor herself. Buy Photo \nNatasha Durant, 30, has been on both sides: as mentor and mentoree through Friends of the Children. She grew up with an absent father and a mom addicted to drugs. Without a mentor, she says, she might still be in pain and emotionally withdrawn, and she wouldn’t have graduated from high school or gone to college. “Not only were they there to be my friend and they genuinely care about me, but they’re advocating for me behind the scenes,” she said. “This person really has my back.” (Photo: Matt Helms/Detroit Free Press) \nDurant said she was a painfully shy child. One of five kids, Durant said she doesn’t know her father, and her mother was addicted to drugs and lost custody. Durant and her brother were raised by their grandmother. \nThough she describes her childhood as “chaotic,” she said she did well in school and learned through mentors how to get out of her shell. \nShe was involved in athletics, and Friends helped her pay for fees and equipment and took her on trips, including camping, that she wouldn’t have otherwise had access to. \nFriends also pushed her to go to college, and she became the first woman in her family to graduate from high school and the first to go to college. She received a bachelor’s degree in cultural and ethnic studies from Evergreen State College in Olympia, Wash. \nToday, at 30, she’s a married mother of three in her fifth year as a Friends mentor after working as a college admissions officer and with youth organizations. \nShe said it wasn’t until she was a junior in high school that she realized what the Friends program was doing in her life. \n“Not only were they there to be my friend, and they genuinely care about me, but they’re advocating for me behind the scenes. This person really has my back,” she said. “But I really didn’t understand the full extent of what we do until I became a Friend.” \nDurant said she’s sure her life would look far different today had she not had a Friends mentor. \n“I probably would have never gone to college,” she said. “I’d probably be working at a retail store, and college would have been the last thing on my mind. I could have been a teen parent. It’s hard to say, but they really helped me make better decisions when I was going through those adolescent years.” \nThe work as a mentor can be challenging, Durant and others said. \nBuilding trust with children and teens from troubled backgrounds isn’t easy. Nor is navigating the challenges they face, from losing homes to difficulties in school to not having enough to eat. \nBut the rewards are in the successes of the kids, and the relationships between Friends and their mentees often last long after the kids have left the program. Two of Durant’s mentees who graduated from high school this summer are planning to go to college. \nOne of them is Lana, 18, who Durant said is “one of the strongest young ladies I know,” but whose life could have ended up with far less possibility. \nLana said she had a turbulent relationship with her mother, and there were substance-abuse issues in her family’s home; at one point, she lived with her grandmother. She said she was a headstrong student who got straight A's, but also has had counseling for emotional problems and fell in with the wrong crowd in her early teens — recklessness that she said included friends involved with drugs and gangs. \nFriends mentors helped her through it. \n“They were there to push me in the right direction,” she said. “If they hadn’t done that, I would probably honestly be dead, because the people I was hanging out with, they were not good people. Not at all. … It was bad.” \nToday, she’s planning to enlist in the Army to help pay for her schooling. She has dreams of becoming an obstetrician-gynecologist, grateful for what Friends provided her. \n“It’s a sense of stability,” she said, “because I don’t have a lot of that.” \nContact Matt Helms: 313-222-1450, or on Twitter: @matthelms \nMORE ABOUT FRIENDS OF THE CHILDREN \nFriends of the Children employs 56 mentors, called \"friends,\" in its Portland chapter, serving 460 young people. Mentors generally care for eight kids at a time, spending four hours a week with each. Counting other chapters in the U.S. and the United Kingdom, Friends employs 199 mentors who serve 1,011 children. \nIn Portland, friends staff and local child-welfare agencies observe kindergartners in three of the city's poorest schools — only those children whose parents have given permission — and they are ranked by criteria including behavioral issues, family background, abuse or neglect, substance abuse in the home, whether they have single parents or parents who've been incarcerated and other factors. The children with the highest scores — indicating the most risk factors — are selected to have a mentor assigned to them, limited to the number of mentors available. \nFriends has expanded to chapters in Seattle, Boston and New York, serving Harlem and the South Bronx, along with affiliate programs in the Tampa, Fla., area and in Cornwall in England. There is limited public money so far for the bulk of Friends' operations, which are 92% funded by donations from individuals, corporations and private philanthropies. \nIt's not cheap to provide mentoring. It costs about $10,000 per year per child, Friends says. But an analysis by the Harvard Business School Association of Oregon in 2012 found that for every dollar spent on a child in Friends, society saves more than $900,000 over the child's lifetime because of reduced costs associated with kids who might otherwise face incarceration, teen parenting, dropping out of school and higher health care costs. 6 CONNECT 1 COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://on.freep.com/2g9yUok More Stories",

      "text": "You're not the only one upset that the internet might have misled you . Kanye West cut short a Sacramento concert with an epic 15-minute speech where he railed against the state of the music industry, politics, and... the internet. The superstar says that people feel like they lost (due to the election, among other issues) because Facebook and Google \"lied to you.\" He even calls out Facebook chief Mark Zuckerberg by name around the 12-minute mark. Supposedly, the internet mogul reneged on a promise that he \"would help\" Kanye and then decided to \"look for aliens.\" We're not sure where that last part comes from, since Facebook's out-there projects are largely limited to Earthly concerns like solar-powered internet drones .\nHe also tells people to only put their iPhones in the air, since he wants \"only originals.\" Guess we know where he stands on smartphones, then (although he recently got rid of his phone to focus on creativity).\nIs Kanye presenting a complex, nuanced take on the problems of internet accuracy and corporate responsibility in Silicon Valley? Hell no. This is a shoot-from-the-hip diatribe. However, it shows that concerns over online authenticity are bubbling to the surface. If Kanye sees it as a problem as serious to him as unfairness to Obama and alleged corruption at the MTV Video Music Awards, you know it's in the mainstream consciousness. In that sense, efforts to fight fake news are overdue -- Kanye's speech is a reflection of frustration that, in some ways, has been simmering for months or even years.\nLost in all of this: 'If you ain't got an iPhone, don't put it up. Only originals.' He's in Ye mode now. https://t.co/0LYyxhz1Rz\n— Edgar Alvarez (@abcdedgar) November 20, 2016",

      "title": "Mark Zuckerberg on Facebook’s fake news: We’re working on it",
      "text": "The big news this week has been fake news .\nBuzzfeed found that the most-shared Facebook stories have been bogus pro-Trump articles, some of them produced by a fake-news mill run by Macedonian teenagers . A man who makes $10,000 a month writing bogus news opened up to a Washington Post reporter about his conflicted feelings . Sen. Ben Sasse (R-Neb.) suggested the media take note of \"paid rioting\"—referring to the persistent, yet evidence-free idea that anti-Trump activists were bused-in, paid protesters .\nFurther Reading It’s time to get rid of the Facebook “news feed,” because it’s not news Much of the concern has focused, naturally, on Facebook. On Friday night, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg posted his second statement in a week on the issue. Zuckerberg assured his critics that they're working on some solutions, but he also emphasized there's a limit to what can be done.\n\"The problems here are complex, both technically and philosophically,\" Zuckerberg explained. He continued:\nWe believe in giving people a voice, which means erring on the side of letting people share what they want whenever possible. We need to be careful not to discourage sharing of opinions or to mistakenly restrict accurate content. We do not want to be arbiters of truth ourselves, but instead rely on our community and trusted third parties.\nWhile the percentage of misinformation is relatively small, we have much more work ahead on our roadmap. Normally we wouldn't share specifics about our work in progress, but given the importance of these issues and the amount of interest in this topic, I want to outline some of the projects we already have underway.\nHe goes on to explain how Facebook is working on better systems for catching misinformation automatically, as well as making it easier for users to report news as fake. They're also considering including warnings on news that gets flagged, and are working with journalists and \"fact checking organizations\" that could help Facebook with third-party verification.\nFurther Reading Zuckerberg claims just 1% of Facebook posts carry fake news Some of the fake news is really \"financially motivated spam\" in Zuckerberg's view, and he said Facebook is \"looking into disrupting the economics with ads policies like the one we announced earlier this week, and better ad farm detection.\"\n\"Some of these ideas will work well, and some will not,\" he concludes. \"But I want you to know that we have always taken this seriously, we understand how important the issue is for our community and we are committed to getting this right.\"\nZuckerberg's post is an attempt to head off what may be a storm of negative public opinion, especially from disgruntled anti-Trump voters and organizations. On Saturday, The Washington Post ran an editorial calling fake news \"dangerous mischief,\" and suggesting news filtering is a job suited to humans, not algorithms. The New York Times was tougher, arguing that \"surely [Facebook] programmers can train the software to spot bogus stories and outwit the people producing this garbage.\" The op-ed concludes by holding Zuckerberg responsible for letting \"liars and con artists hijack his platform.\"",

      "text": "\nKick off each Monday with the best news and ideas in social media. SUBSCRIBE Facebook may start flagging fake news posts, says Mark Zuckerberg Facebook CEO outlines steps the social network is exploring to reduce the spread of fake news on its platform. Tim Peterson on November 20, 2016 at 5:23 pm More \nOn Facebook nobody knows if you’re a liar. But they might someday soon. \nFacebook is considering flagging to its users when a piece of content posted to Facebook has been reported as false by Facebook users or entities outside of Facebook, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in a Facebook post published Friday night . \nTo flag these fake posts, Facebook may label them as false when they appear in people’s feeds and/or alert people that a post has been flagged as false when they click to check out or share the post, according to Zuckerberg. \nThe hypothetical-for-now false-flagging system’s disclosure follows intensifying criticism of Facebook’s role in fueling falsehoods during this year’s presidential election . While Zuckerberg has tried to downplay Facebook’s role in influencing the election and the volume of fake news stories on Facebook , the fact is that the social network can serve as the ultimate rumor mill. According to a BuzzFeed analysis published last week , the most popular fake news stories often outperformed the most popular legitimate news stories, in terms of receiving shares, comments and likes on Facebook. \nIn addition to making people aware when they’re viewing a fake story, Facebook is working to improve its own ability to identify fake stories in order to reduce its distribution of those stories in people’s news feeds and in the “related articles” selections it displays beneath links. \nFacebook is also exploring how to make it easier for people to report a Facebook post as false to Facebook. Right now, to report a post on Facebook as false, you need to 1) click the arrow in the post’s top-right corner, 2) click “Report post,” 3) click “I think it shouldn’t be on Facebook” and 4) click “It’s a false news story.” About The Author Tim Peterson Tim Peterson, Third Door Media's Social Media Reporter, has been covering the digital marketing industry since 2011.

      "text": "Lima (AFP) - Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg called on world leaders Saturday to forge a more \"connected\" planet, something he said was under threat after Donald Trump's US election win and Britain's \"Brexit\" vote. Zuckerberg said in a keynote speech at an Asia-Pacific leaders' summit that while globalization and interconnectedness have their problems, the world must fight the urge to \"disconnect.\"\n\"As we are learning this year in election after election, even if globalization might (boost) prosperity, it also creates inequality. It helps some people and it hurts others,\" he said.\nThe 32-year-old billionaire said there was a \"fundamental choice\" to make in reacting to that inequality.\n\"We can disconnect, risk less prosperity and hope jobs that are lost come back. Or we can connect more, try to do more great things, try to work on even greater prosperity and then work to aggressively share that prosperity with everyone.\"\nThe second option is better, but also harder, he said in his speech at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in Lima, Peru.\n\"Disconnecting is relatively easy. But connecting requires making big investments in infrastructure and generating the political will to make hard long-term decisions,\" he said.\nFacebook has made headlines with its projects on connectivity and internet access.\nThe social network has developed solar-powered drones and a satellite to beam internet service to remote areas.\nThe company has helped more than 40 million people get online, Zuckerberg said.\nHis comments Saturday came amid deep global uncertainty in the wake of the unexpected poll results in the US and Britain.\nTrump and the Brexit camp both appealed to working-class voters who feel threatened by globalization and immigration, running on a populist politics of disillusionment with an increasingly borderless world.\nTrump vows to protect American jobs from cheaper labor overseas, while Brexit campaigners promise British workers will fare better outside the European Union than in it.\nFacebook, the world's largest social network with 1.79 billion users, has been criticized by some as helping Trump to victory by giving a platform to fake election news and extreme-right blogs with untruthful attacks on Trump's opponent Hillary Clinton.\nZuckerberg has dismissed claims his company influenced the vote as \"pretty crazy.\"",

      "text": "Facebook Inc. says it is taking fake news seriously, and has announced steps it is taking to crack down on its dissemination on the social network.\nMark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s FB, -0.65% co-founder and CEO, responded to a wave of post-election criticism at how misinformation may have swayed voters with a statement late Friday.\n“We’ve been working on this problem for a long time and we take this responsibility seriously. We’ve made significant progress, but there is more work to be done,” Zuckerberg said in a Facebook post .\nRead: This person makes $10,000 a month writing fake news\nJust over a week ago, Zuckerberg dismissed the seriousness of the issue , saying: “Personally I think the idea that fake news on Facebook . . . influenced the election in any way is a pretty crazy idea.”\nFriday’s statement took a more general approach, and did not mention the election.\nSocial Media Companies Tackle Fake News and Abuse (2:54) Twitter, Facebook and Google are taking steps to reduce fake news, misinformation, and harassment on the internet after users expressed concerns that false news stories and hate speech fueled divisiveness in the recent presidential election campaign. Photo: Bloomberg News\n“The problems here are complex, both technically and philosophically,” he wrote, expressing wariness at silencing opinions. “We believe in giving people a voice, which means erring on the side of letting people share what they want whenever possible.”\nZuckerberg said ultimately it is Facebook users’ responsibility to report false news stories. “We do not want to be arbiters of truth ourselves, but instead rely on our community and trusted third parties,” he wrote.\nRead: Facebook’s fake news problem might not hurt its stock long term\nZuckerberg then laid out seven ways Facebook is actively targeting misinformation, including stronger detection by its algorithms, making it easier for users to flag fake news and banning deceptive sites from its ad network , effectively cutting off their ability to generate revenue. He also said Facebook would be reaching out to third-party fact-checkers and journalists for input.\n“Some of these ideas will work well, and some will not,” Zuckerberg said, but “we understand how important the issue is for our community and we are committed to getting this right.”\nMore from MarketWatch Kellyanne Conway Discusses How to ‘Drain the Swamp’ What President-elect Trump means for every U.S. industry Why the gap between minority and white college graduates is growing",

      "text": "Continue reading the main story But as Mr. Zuckerberg went on to say that Facebook had to be careful not to mistakenly block “accurate content,” he added this: “We do not want to be arbiters of truth ourselves,” which was why he said Facebook would continue to rely on “our community and trusted third parties.” \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story His statement pointed up how much Facebook struggles to find the balance between its mission to be a free-expression utopia for its 1.8 billion users and its responsibility to protect them from all that is defamatory, dangerous (like terrorist propaganda) and untrue. But more to the point, it appeared to buy into the notion that truth is relative at a time when that notion has to finally go away. Do you really need an outside arbiter to determine whether a video suggesting — without basis — that Hillary Clinton was involved in John F. Kennedy Jr.’s fatal plane crash in 1999 should be allowed to stand? Really? Truth doesn’t need arbiters. It needs defenders. And it needs them now more than ever as the American democracy staggers into its next uncertain phase. With a mainstream news media that works hard to separate fact from fiction under economic and political threat, Facebook — which has contributed to that economic threat by gobbling up so much of the online advertising market — is going to have a special responsibility to do its part. Just imagine what things will look like if the unsavory elements that tore through the 2016 election — false narratives, fake news and aggressive efforts to delegitimize traditional journalism — come back into play as Donald J. Trump presses to enact his agenda. If the past week provided any indication of where politics are going, the next four years are going to require an all-hands-on-deck effort to keep the national conversation honest. The national security adviser Mr. Trump named last week, Michael T. Flynn, a retired Army lieutenant general, has subscribed to the conspiracy theory that Shariah law is taking root in the United States ( it isn’t ), contributing to his insistence that Americans have every reason to view Islam as “a threat.” He recently used Twitter to circulate a fake news item that the Federal Bureau of Investigation was sitting on evidence from Anthony Weiner’s laptop that would “put Hillary and her crew away for life.” \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Trump’s nominee for attorney general, Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama, has falsely claimed that hundreds of thousands of undocumented immigrants are successfully crossing the border annually. Then there was the announcement by the conspiracy theorist Alex Jones that Mr. Trump had called to thank him and his radio and internet audience for their support in the campaign. Add to that the fact that Mr. Trump was the most prominent promoter of the false notion that President Obama wasn’t born here, and didn’t hesitate to repeat the outrageous suggestion that the father of Senator Ted Cruz was linked to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy . Then consider what it may look like when Mr. Trump pursues policies regarding Muslim immigrants and undocumented immigrants. It’s not so outlandish to envision Mr. Trump’s attempts to sell his plans getting a lift from the likes of Mr. Jones or a fake site out of Macedonia — perhaps claiming that Democrats are working with ISIS to use undocumented immigrants to poison local water supplies or some such. President Obama seemed to have had something like that in mind when he told reporters in Germany on Thursday, “If we are not serious about facts and what’s true and what’s not,” and “if we can’t discriminate between serious arguments and propaganda, then we have problems.” Mr. Obama knows of what he speaks. He had to muddle through the first wave of this. You might remember how his health care plan was marred by a false accusation that the plan included so-called death panels that would decide who lived and who died based on their “level of productivity to society,” as former Gov. Sarah Palin put it (on her Facebook page!). The false “death panel” allegation was partly based on proposals to reimburse doctors for optional consultations with families over end-of-life care decisions. \nAdvertisement The accusations took on such power that even Newt Gingrich signed on to the falsehood despite the fact that he had previously expressed bullish support for end-of-life planning. (He explained himself in a 2009 letter to The New York Times .) News organizations, including this one , debunked the myth. But the bill’s authors stripped out the provision just the same. And by then the “death panel” fiction had negated any shot at a reasoned, ideological debate — you’re joining the Democrats’ plan to kill our infirm children and parents?! As Dan Pfeiffer, who was the president’s chief communications strategist at the time, so grimly put it to me last week, “The faux death panels were the canary in the coal mine about the coming death of truth.” Things have advanced since then. Today’s fake news is limited only by the imaginations of its inventors and the number of shares it can garner on Facebook or Twitter. (To wit: The one million shares of the preposterous notion that Mrs. Clinton secretly sold weapons to ISIS. BuzzFeed News — which has excelled at illuminating the fake news problem — highlighted that example in its alarming analysis showing that during the campaign cycle fake news was shared among Facebook users more often than real news was.) That’s why people who care about the truth — citizens, journalists and, let’s hope, social media giants like Facebook, too — will have to come up with a solution to this informational nihilism, fast. It’s easier said than done. The combination of attacks seeking to delegitimize serious news organizations and a drop in overall trust in the news media has made many people wary of legitimate fact-checking. And, as my colleague John Herrman noted last weekend , politicized voices can easily drown honest journalism all too easily on social media. There is growing talk of an ambitious journalistic collaboration to beat back the tide. Industry thinkers and leaders are coming together online to brainstorm solutions, as Jeff Jarvis , the City University of New York journalism professor, and Eli Pariser, the Upworthy co-founder, have done. (Check them out online.) And I’d say it’s high time that television news — with its still-huge audiences — gets into the act with more than just token gestures at fact-checking. But this much seems clear: The moment calls for some sort of hyperfactual counterinsurgency that treats every false meme as a baby Hitler to be killed in its crib with irrefutable facts. \nAdvertisement",

      "text": "Facebook \n– The Nigerian Senate has discovered what could become a major scandal in Nigeria as it concerns governors and ministers \n– The discovery was made by a committee of the Senate which embarked on an oversight function to Lagos state \nThe discovery of 1,500 exotic cars at a yard in Lagos may have sent cold shivers down the spines of governors and ministers, some of whom have been indicted. \nThe Senate committee on customs, excise and tariff led by its chairman, Hope Uzodinma, made the discovery when its members visited the Volkswagen Yard, on the Mile 2-Badagry Expressway in Lagos. Exotic cars were found in the Volkswagen yard in Lagos \nThe Punch reports that the vehicles had been packed since 2015 and that one of the governors indicted is from the south-east. \nREAD ALSO: TUC slams House of Representatives over exotic cars \nAccording to the report, the governor, whose name is withheld, owns 15 Sports Utility Vehicles (SUVs) intercepted and impounded by officers of the Nigeria Customs Service (NCS) and parked in the agency’s office in Ikeja. \nThe committee was said to have discovered that the yard looked deserted with disused equipment in its assembly plant scattered. \nThe report said officials of the company had refused to open the store for the senators to inspect it. They were however forced to open it after they were threatened. \nIt was learnt that the senators were shocked as they found 1,500 pieces of various models of Volkswagen products and other brands of vehicles in the warehouse. \nIt is yet to be known what action the Senate would take concerning the discovery.",

Lawrence , Detroit Free Press 10:48 p.m. EST November 20, 2016 Buy Photo Big Head characters march down Woodward Avenue during America's Thanksgiving Parade presented by Art Van in Detroit on Nov. 26, 2015. (Photo: Romain Blanquart, Detroit Free Press) Buy Photo \nOne of the key inquiries leading up to the Thanksgiving Day parade in Detroit for the last couple of years has involved the ongoing construction for the QLINE. \nBut the end is near. \nBy Thursday, the cones blocking traffic from certain lanes on Woodward should be cleared from the route for America’s Thanksgiving Parade presented by Art Van, which is to step off from Kirby near the Detroit Institute of Arts at 8:50 a.m. \n“The M-1 Rail construction team has been working nearly 24/7, rain or shine, to meet the deadline of open to traffic (on Woodward) by Thanksgiving, and that’s what we’re going to do,” said M-1 Rail spokesman Dan Lijana. M-1 Rail is the entity building the 3.3-mile streetcar line, which is expected to be operational next year. \n►Related: Holiday place card holders will make your party more special \nSome construction, including for the QLINE stations, will continue after Thanksgiving. \nAs always, the parade’s popularity brings a sea of people to downtown and Midtown. Parade Co. President and CEO Tony Michaels confidently predicted a massive crowd of well over 1 million people for the 90th-annual event. \n“We expect probably the largest crowd ever, because Woodward is done pretty much,” Michaels said. “It’s an opportunity to see the progress in Detroit like never before.” \nMichaels also said the lineup for the 62-unit parade, which has eight brand-new floats, is the best “we’ve ever had.” \nComedian Keegan-Michael Key, a Detroit native, and Judge Damon Keith are co-grand marshals. \nThe forecast as of Friday was not perfect, given last week’s balmy weather, but Detroiters have certainly seen worse. The National Weather Service was predicting a chance of showers with a high near 48 on Thanksgiving. \nAs always, getting to the parade, or the Turkey Trot beforehand, or the Lions Game afterward (the Lions host the Vikings at 12:30 p.m. at Ford Field) takes a bit of planning. The City of Detroit has announced numerous street closures: \nWoodward from West Grand Boulevard to Warren is closed from 5 p.m. Wednesday until 2 p.m. Thursday, and Woodward from Warren to Jefferson is closed from 2 a.m. Thursday until the end of the parade, which should be around noon. \nIn addition, numerous streets have limited access starting at noon Wednesday: Amsterdam/Piquette from Cass to John R. Harper from Cass to John R. Palmer from Cass to John R. Ferry from Cass to John R. Farnsworth/Putnam from Cass to John R. \nThese streets close at 5 a.m. on Thanksgiving: Michigan at Cass. Fort from Trumbull to Woodward. Congress from Shelby to Randolph. Larned from Shelby to Randolph. Shelby from Congress to Michigan. Michigan from Cass to Woodward. Monroe from Woodward to Randolph. Lafayette from Trumbull to Griswold. Washington from Adams to Congress. Atwater from Civic Center Drive to Third. \nThese streets, including Michigan Avenue and Washington, will reopen after the Turkey Trot at about 10 a.m., according to a news release from the city. The southbound Lodge exits at West Jefferson/Cobo and Larned, and the northbound Lodge exit at West Jefferson will be closed during the Turkey Trot. The Larned exit is to reopen after the Turkey Trot. \nGetting to Detroit should not be affected by any Michigan Department of Transportation projects. Spokeswoman Diane Cross said active projects will be on hold during the holiday. Other projects, such as work on I-94 near Detroit Metro Airport, should be wrapped up in time for the holiday. \nRiding the Detroit People Mover will be free from 6 a.m. to 7 p.m. on Thanksgiving. The closest stations to the parade route are Grand Circus, Broadway and Cadillac Center. \nThe parade and other activities will affect bus riders, who should expect delays beginning at 6 a.m. on Thanksgiving. East side Detroit Department of Transportation routes will lay over at the People Mover's Bricktown Station. Regular service to the Rosa Parks Transit Center for east-side routes resumes after 6 p.m. \nThe parade will affect the No. 7 Cadillac-Harper, No. 10 Chene, No. 25 Jefferson, No. 31 Mack, No. 34 Gratiot and No. 48 Van Dyke. The Turkey Trot will affect the No. 19 Fort, No. 27 Joy and No. 29 Linwood. \nNew this year is the limited stop, express refleX bus, which travels to downtown Detroit from either Mt. Clemens or Troy. The Gratiot route, which is operated by the Suburban Mobility Authority for Regional Transportation, will run on a Sunday/holiday schedule. Information about the Woodward route, which is operated by the Detroit Department of Transportation and would be affected by the parade, was not immediately available. \nThe city has also suggested several parking facilities. \nFor the parade, it suggests Ford Underground, at 30 E. Jefferson, and Millenium, at 423 W. Congress. Both are $10. \nFor the Lions game, it suggests Grand Circus, at 1600-01 Woodward ($20), and Premier Underground, at 1206-08 Woodward ($10). \nTo find lost children, call Detroit Police Department Downtown Services at 313-237-2850 or 313-237-2828. \nContact Eric D.

      "title": "Mark Zuckerberg and Facebook Must Defend the Truth",
      "text": " count=\"367\" data-total-count=\"367\">Friday night, the Facebook co-founder Mark Zuckerberg went on his vast social network to convince an expanding chorus of critics — including the departing president of the United States — that he honest-to-goodness wants to combat the “fake news” that is running wild across his site and others, and turning our politics into a paranoiac fantasy come to life. “We’ve been working on this problem for a long time and we take this responsibility seriously,” he wrote .\n“We’ve made significant progress, but there is more work to be done,” he continued, listing various steps Facebook was taking, like making it easier to report bad information and enlisting fact-checking organizations.\nIt was heartening to hear, especially after his earlier assertion that it was “crazy” to believe that misinformation on Facebook had affected the presidential election in any real way — despite copious evidence that it was disturbingly in the mix, whether it directly swung the result or not.\n But as Mr. Zuckerberg went on to say that Facebook had to be careful not to mistakenly block “accurate content,” he added this: “We do not want to be arbiters of truth ourselves,” which was why he said Facebook would continue to rely on “our community and trusted third parties.”\n His statement pointed up how much Facebook struggles to find the balance between its mission to be a free-expression utopia for its 1.8 billion users and its responsibility to protect them from all that is defamatory, dangerous (like terrorist propaganda) and untrue.\nBut more to the point, it appeared to buy into the notion that truth is relative at a time when that notion has to finally go away. Do you really need an outside arbiter to determine whether a video suggesting — without basis — that Hillary Clinton was involved in John F. Kennedy Jr.’s fatal plane crash in 1999 should be allowed to stand? Really?\nTruth doesn’t need arbiters. It needs defenders. And it needs them now more than ever as the American democracy staggers into its next uncertain phase.\nWith a mainstream news media that works hard to separate fact from fiction under economic and political threat, Facebook — which has contributed to that economic threat by gobbling up so much of the online advertising market — is going to have a special responsibility to do its part.\nJust imagine what things will look like if the unsavory elements that tore through the 2016 election — false narratives, fake news and aggressive efforts to delegitimize traditional journalism — come back into play as Donald J. Trump presses to enact his agenda.\nIf the past week provided any indication of where politics are going, the next four years are going to require an all-hands-on-deck effort to keep the national conversation honest.\nThe national security adviser Mr. Trump named last week, Michael T. Flynn, a retired Army lieutenant general, has subscribed to the conspiracy theory that Shariah law is taking root in the United States ( it isn’t ), contributing to his insistence that Americans have every reason to view Islam as “a threat.”\nHe recently used Twitter to circulate a fake news item that the Federal Bureau of Investigation was sitting on evidence from Anthony Weiner’s laptop that would “put Hillary and her crew away for life.”\n Mr. Trump’s nominee for attorney general, Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama, has falsely claimed that hundreds of thousands of undocumented immigrants are successfully crossing the border annually.\nThen there was the announcement by the conspiracy theorist Alex Jones that Mr. Trump had called to thank him and his radio and internet audience for their support in the campaign.\nAdd to that the fact that Mr. Trump was the most prominent promoter of the false notion that President Obama wasn’t born here, and didn’t hesitate to repeat the outrageous suggestion that the father of Senator Ted Cruz was linked to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy .\nThen consider what it may look like when Mr. Trump pursues policies regarding Muslim immigrants and undocumented immigrants.\nIt’s not so outlandish to envision Mr. Trump’s attempts to sell his plans getting a lift from the likes of Mr. Jones or a fake site out of Macedonia — perhaps claiming that Democrats are working with ISIS to use undocumented immigrants to poison local water supplies or some such.\nPresident Obama seemed to have had something like that in mind when he told reporters in Germany on Thursday, “If we are not serious about facts and what’s true and what’s not,” and “if we can’t discriminate between serious arguments and propaganda, then we have problems.”\nMr. Obama knows of what he speaks. He had to muddle through the first wave of this.\nYou might remember how his health care plan was marred by a false accusation that the plan included so-called death panels that would decide who lived and who died based on their “level of productivity to society,” as former Gov. Sarah Palin put it (on her Facebook page!).\nThe false “death panel” allegation was partly based on proposals to reimburse doctors for optional consultations with families over end-of-life care decisions.\n The accusations took on such power that even Newt Gingrich signed on to the falsehood despite the fact that he had previously expressed bullish support for end-of-life planning. (He explained himself in a 2009 letter to The New York Times .)\nNews organizations, including this one , debunked the myth. But the bill’s authors stripped out the provision just the same. And by then the “death panel” fiction had negated any shot at a reasoned, ideological debate — you’re joining the Democrats’ plan to kill our infirm children and parents?!\nAs Dan Pfeiffer, who was the president’s chief communications strategist at the time, so grimly put it to me last week, “The faux death panels were the canary in the coal mine about the coming death of truth.”\nThings have advanced since then. Today’s fake news is limited only by the imaginations of its inventors and the number of shares it can garner on Facebook or Twitter.\n(To wit: The one million shares of the preposterous notion that Mrs. Clinton secretly sold weapons to ISIS. BuzzFeed News — which has excelled at illuminating the fake news problem — highlighted that example in its alarming analysis showing that during the campaign cycle fake news was shared among Facebook users more often than real news was.)\nThat’s why people who care about the truth — citizens, journalists and, let’s hope, social media giants like Facebook, too — will have to come up with a solution to this informational nihilism, fast.\nIt’s easier said than done. The combination of attacks seeking to delegitimize serious news organizations and a drop in overall trust in the news media has made many people wary of legitimate fact-checking. And, as my colleague John Herrman noted last weekend , politicized voices can easily drown honest journalism all too easily on social media.\nThere is growing talk of an ambitious journalistic collaboration to beat back the tide. Industry thinkers and leaders are coming together online to brainstorm solutions, as Jeff Jarvis , the City University of New York journalism professor, and Eli Pariser, the Upworthy co-founder, have done. (Check them out online.) And I’d say it’s high time that television news — with its still-huge audiences — gets into the act with more than just token gestures at fact-checking.\nBut this much seems clear: The moment calls for some sort of hyperfactual counterinsurgency that treats every false meme as a baby Hitler to be killed in its crib with irrefutable facts.\n So hey, Zuck, let’s roll.",

REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration/File Photo GLOBAL BUSINESS WEEK AHEAD PACKAGE - SEARCH ''BUSINESS WEEK AHEAD JULY 25'' FOR ALL IMAGES \nLONDON Facebook said it would expand its UK presence by 50 percent in 2017, joining U.S. technology peer Google in boosting investment in Britain despite the uncertainty sparked by the vote to leave the European Union. \nSocial network firm Facebook said it would hire 500 new staff, adding to the 1,000 people it already employs in Britain, as it gears up to open a new headquarters in London next year. \nBefore the Brexit referendum in June, pro-Remain campaigners had warned that international companies could seek to reduce their presence in Britain as withdrawing from the EU would make it a less attractive place to invest. \nBut Facebook said on Monday that was not the case. \n\"The UK remains one of the best places to be a tech company and is an important part of Facebook's story,\" Europe, Middle East and Africa vice-president Nicola Mendelsohn will say at a conference run by the CBI, an employers group, later on Monday. \nFacebook's expansion comes after Google, owned by parent company Alphabet Inc, said earlier in November that it would invest in thousands of extra engineers as part of its move to a new London building. \nBritain is also benefiting from the growth of online retailer Amazon, which expects to create 3,500 UK jobs in 2016, including at its head office, research and development centers, customer service centers and distribution depots. \nIt plans a further 2,300 at three new distribution centers in 2017. \nFacebook said many of its new jobs would be in the high-skilled engineering sector. \n(Reporting by Sarah Young; editing by Kate Holton) Next In Technology News",

      "text": "Facebook to add 500 jobs in London by Charles Riley @CRrileyCNN November 21, 2016: 5:54 AM ET Facebook's latest app filters video into works of art Facebook plans to open a new office and hire 500 additional workers in London, making it the latest industry giant to show a commitment to the burgeoning tech hub. \nThe hiring spree will increase Facebook's ( FB , Tech30 ) total headcount in the capital city by 50%. \n\"We came to London in 2007 with just a handful of people, by the end of next year we will have opened a new HQ and plan to employ 1,500 people,\" said Facebook's Europe chief Nicola Mendelsohn. \nRelated: Facebook approves $6 billion stock buyback \nThe commitment is a major vote of confidence in London following Britain's vote to leave the European Union. Banks and other big employers in the city have said they may be forced to relocate staff because of the separation. \n\"The U.K. remains one of the best places to be a tech company and is an important part of Facebook's story,\" Mendelsohn said. \nThe Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, said the decision shows that \"London's strength as a tech hub keeps on growing.\" \n\"The capital's vibrant tech scene is the envy of Europe and Facebook's continuing commitment is another sign that London is open to talent, innovation and entrepreneurship from all four corners of the world,\" he said in a statement. The expansion of @facebook is another sign that #LondonIsOpen to talent & innovation from all corners of the world. https://t.co/hnpEX1QTdM — Sadiq Khan (@SadiqKhan) November 21, 2016 \nAbout one in three workers in U.K. startups come from outside the U.K., and most of these international workers are from the EU, according to research published last year by the start-up accelerator, Wayra. \nTech companies warned before the vote for Brexit on June 23 that leaving the EU could make it harder for them to recruit people from around Europe. The U.K. has made clear in recent weeks that it intends to restrict immigration from the EU when it is no longer a member. \nStill, Google ( GOOG ) confirmed last week that it would move ahead with a new 650,000 sq. ft building in London. Its campus in King's Cross will eventually be able to house 7,000 employees across three offices. \nThe new building will be the first to be wholly owned and designed by Google outside the United States.

      "text": "Facebook plans to boost UK headcount by 50% as gov’t signals corporate tax rate cut Posted Monsanto-owned The Climate Corporation acquires Estonia’s VitalFields \nFacebook has followed Google’s lead by trumpeting plans to expand its presence in the UK — despite ongoing uncertainty over the impact of this summer’s Brexit vote for the country to leave the European Union. \nSpeaking at the annual CBI conference in London today, Facebook’s Nicola Mendelsohn, VP EMEA, announced plans for the social network to increase its UK headcount by 50 per cent by the end of 2017, and open a new HQ in the country. \nMendelsohn said the aim is to grow headcount from 1,000 to 1,500 by then — with “many” of the new jobs touted as “high skilled engineering jobs”. \n“We came to London in 2007 with just a handful of people, by the end of next year we will have opened a new HQ and plan to employ 1,500 people. Many of those new roles will be high skilled engineering jobs as the UK is home to our largest engineering base outside of the US and is where we have developed new products like Workplace,” she said, also noting the company’s presence in Somerset — where its Aquila facility is working on designing and building solar power unmanned planes to bring connectivity to remote regions. \nIt’s not clear exactly what proportion of the additional jobs would be engineering roles vs other jobs such as sales. We asked but the company declined to provide any further details. \nFacebook’s announcement of an intention to increase UK headcount follows Google’s UK-focused publicity last week when the company re-announced a long planned expansion of its London campus — couching the move as a continued commitment to the UK in spite of Brexit. \nReporters were told that the capacity of Google’s new London HQ is 7,000 vs the 4,000 of its current building — with the implication being the company could employee 3,000 more staff in the UK by 2020. Assuming, that is, business conditions in the UK prove favorable — with CEO Sundar Pichai talking about the ‘absolute’ importance of open borders and free movement for skilled migrants. Two things that, absolutely, cannot be guaranteed, given the UK’s impending Brexit. So quite how many of those potential 3,000 additional Google UK jobs end up existing remains to be seen — like so many things affected by Brexit. \nFacebook’s UK expansion plans don’t mention any specific caveats or conditions for the company to grow headcount in the country. But in related PR it also makes a point of referencing its mission to “make the world more open and connected”. Which reads like a not-so-subtle argument for the UK government to push for a ‘soft Brexit’, rather than the tough on immigration rhetoric of the hard Brexiteers. \nEspecially as a “plan” to add an additional 500 jobs is in no way an irreversible guarantee. So again, it remains to be seen how many of the extra Facebook jobs survive the looming Brexit negotiations. \nUK Prime Minister Theresa May has said she intends to trigger the start of the two-year negotiation process to leave the EU by the end of March 2017. \nAlso speaking at the CBI conference today, the Prime Minister announced a series of business-friendly measures aimed at pouring some emollient oil on the troubled waters of Brexit — including a government funding boost for R&D worth £2BN by 2020; and a review of the UK’s corporate tax rate, suggesting it could move to substantially cut the rate below the current 20 per cent. (Albeit, such a move could in fact complicate the UK’s Brexit negotiations — given it would likely be viewed as a hostile move by EU governments .) \nAlso on the table: a possible boost for R&D tax credits to further support businesses conducting research in the UK. \nMay also announced a new Industrial Strategy Challenge Fund, overseen by UK Research and Innovation and funded by some of the £2BN R&D boost — aimed at supporting the commercialization of what the government is dubbing “priority technologies”, such as robotics, biotechnology and AI. \nOther emerging fields that could benefit from the new fund’s support include medical technology, satellites, advanced materials manufacturing and “other areas where the UK has a proven scientific strength and there is a significant economic opportunity for commercialisation”.

      "text": "Facebook working with fact-checkers to weed out fake news The social networking site will make it easier for users to report fake stories Bangalore Correspondent, IDG News Service | Nov 21, 2016 3:46 AM PT Email a friend Use commas to separate multiple email addresses From Your message has been sent. Sorry There was an error emailing this page. \nFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg speaks at a Samsung event in Barcelona on Feb. 21, 2016. Credit: Facebook Inside Google's Loon and Wing \nReturning to the controversy over fake news on the social networking site, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said over the weekend that the company was working with fact-checking organizations to put in place third-party verification of the authenticity of news on its site. \nFacebook has been criticized for fake news on its site, which is claimed to have tilted the recent U.S. presidential elections in favor of Republican candidate Donald Trump. \nZuckerberg warned in his post late Friday that the website needs to be careful not to discourage sharing of opinions or to mistakenly restrict accurate content. “We do not want to be arbiters of truth ourselves, but instead rely on our community and trusted third parties,” he wrote. \nBesides third-party verification of stories, the company is focusing on better technical systems for the detection of false news even before people flag them as fakes. \nOther measures by the website include making it much easier for people to report stories as fake, warning labels on stories that have been flagged as false by third parties or the community, and working with the news industry to understand its fact-checking systems. \nLast week, the social network clarified that under its policy, Facebook would not place ads through its Audience Network on websites and apps found distributing fake news . Google also announced similar measures after a false story figured on top of certain search results. \n“A lot of misinformation is driven by financially motivated spam,” Zuckerberg wrote. “We're looking into disrupting the economics with ads policies like the one we announced earlier this week, and better ad farm detection.” \nThe percentage of misinformation on the site is relatively small, Zuckerberg wrote, echoing his previous view of the issue. “Of all the content on Facebook, more than 99% of what people see is authentic. Only a very small amount is fake news and hoaxes,” Zuckerberg wrote in a recent post . He had previously described as “crazy” the criticism that fake news on Facebook's news feed had influenced the vote in favor of Trump. \nBut misinformation on social networks has attracted criticism including from President Barack Obama. Findings by the Pew Research Center indicate that 20 percent of social media users said they had changed their stance on a social or political issue because of content they saw on social media, while 17 percent said social media helped to change their views about a specific political candidate.

      "text": "Follow KRLD: Facebook | Twitter \nFormer Texas Governor and presidential hopeful Rick Perry has a meeting with the President-Elect at Trump Tower in New York City today to possibly fill a spot in Trump’s cabinet. \nMuch like Mitt Romney, Rick Perry was known to make his dislike of Donald Trump known during the presidential campaign. \nPerry once said, “Donald Trump’s candidacy is a cancer on conservatism and must be clearly diagnosed, excised and discarded.” \nHe also said in that speech Trump was a, “barking carnival act.” however, that won’t stop Perry from having a sit-down with Trump on 5th Avenue later today. \nThe talk is Perry is under consideration to become the next Secretary of Veterans Affairs, but there’s also been some speculation he may be a possible candidate for Defense Secretary. \nHe’s also been mentioned as a potential Secretary of Energy. \nPerry served in the U.S. Air Force from 1972 to 1977. \n(©2016 CBS Local Media, a division of CBS Radio Inc.   rewritten, or redistributed.)
