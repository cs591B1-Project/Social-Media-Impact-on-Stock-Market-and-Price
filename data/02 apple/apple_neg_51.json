      "text": "Foxconn is Apple’s main producer of the iPhone. The company is responsible for piecing together all of the various components and assembling them into the final product that many of us know and use everyday. So safe to say that employees at the company are pretty much surrounded by hundreds and thousands of iPhones on a daily basis. This is also why we can see how there might be some temptation to steal a couple and resell them on the black market. After all iPhones are worth quite a fair bit as far as smartphones are concerned. Unfortunately temptation did get to one employee, a senior manager at Foxconn who now faces up to 10 years in jail for stealing 5,700 iPhones worth nearly $1.5 million in value.\nAccording to the report, the manager forced eight of his surbordinates into smuggling iPhone 5 and iPhone 5S handsets out of the Foxconn plant in Shenzhen between 2013 and 2014. However it seems that these devices weren’t for consumer use and were designated for testing purposes, which is why they managed to get away with stealing so many without alerting anyone.\nIt was only after an internal audit was conducted earlier this year that revealed the theft.\nFiled in",

You now VP of Twitter products!\nFor a company that seems like it’s always on the brink of going out of business, its comes as some surprise that Twitter just bought a business. But that’s what just happened as team Twitter has scooped up app maker YES, Inc., maker of the social media and planning apps Frenzy and WYD, or “what you doing.” It wasn’t really the apps that Twitter was after, it was CEO Keith Coleman , who will now serve as Twitter’s VP of Products.\nColeman previously worked as VP of Product for another tech company called “Google,” whatever that is, so hopefully he can bring some new ideas to Twitter, which despite being an icon of the social media world, is seemingly always on the brink of oblivion. Yes was a seven-person outfit and no terms of the deal were disclosed, but here’s hoping some interesting new Twitter things take flight soon.\nCheap chargers, very expensive fires\nPowering and charging our gadgets is an ongoing struggle most of us deal with every day, and as we all know, chargers and cords wear out, burn up or get lost with maddening regularity. What to do? Buy more of them of course, but a new study by a British consumer safety group has found that pretty much all the cut-rate charger and cords sold online are basically fire hazards waiting to happen. Only 3 percent of the many units tested met British safety standards.\nApple has recently filed a lawsuit against a U.S. vendor selling knock-off charging bits on Amazon, and the online retail giant has also launched a crackdown of their own. Hey, we get it, 20 bucks is a lot to fork over to a company for an OEM charging cable, especially when you can get one that looks just like it elsewhere for, what, 79 cents? Great deal, but what’s your peace of mind worth? Especially during the holidays?\nFly and be free, and we’ll even let you fly for free\nHey it’s Friday and time for the video of the week, which is brought to you by JetPack Aviation! People have been dreaming about flying around with jetpacks since, well, jet engines were dreamed up, but it looks like the dream is getting closer to reality thanks to David Mayman and his team. Look at him go! No special effect here, folks, this real-deal jet pack flyin’. The JB-10 jetpack features two small turbines with ducted steering for control.\nSince it runs on jet fuel and not electricity, you can add more range just by adding more gas. Best off all, Mayman says it’s easy to fly thanks to modern stability tech and their simplified control system. It’s so simple in fact, we’ve partnered with JetPack Aviation to give YOU a chance to pilot the pack, and you’ll be the first civilian jetpack pilot if we draw your name. Hit this link to enter and start dreaming about soaring like a jet-powered bird.\nTwitter finally has a VP of product courtesy of its latest acquisition So what would happen if a drone hit a plane?

      "text": "Something odd is happening with iPhone 6 and 6S devices in China — they’re randomly shutting down, and the Chinese government is not happy about it.\nIt’s becoming such a big problem that the China Consumers Association (CCA) has issued a formal warning to Apple, demanding action from the company. Apple, however, is denying that the issues extend beyond some older iPhone 6S models. The issue has affected a “considerable number” of people, according to Reuters . The devices shut down and do not turn on again, despite the battery still having about 50 to 60 percent of its juice remaining. Plugging in a charger doesn’t help, and reports suggest plugging into a computer is the only way to turn the device back on.\nMore: Apple has begun its massive purge of apps from the App Store\n“In view that Apple iPhone 6 and iPhone 6s series cell phones in China have a considerable number of users, and the number of people who’ve reported this problem is rather many, China Consumer Association has already made a query with Apple,” the organization says on its website .\nThe CCA is state-approved, but it is not an official regulatory association.\nApple has been having a tough time expanding in China, due to heavy competition from Chinese smartphone manufacturers. In June, the Cupertino, California, company had to stop selling iPhone 6 devices due to complaints by another manufacturer that Apple stole its design . Apple is appealing the decision.\n“After hearing reports from iPhone customers whose devices unexpectedly shut down, we thoroughly looked into these reports, and collected and analyzed devices … We looked for any other factors that could cause an iPhone to shut down unexpectedly,” said Apple in a statement . “After intensive investigations, no new factors have been identified. We will continue to monitor and analyze customer reports.”\nMore: China to Trump: Don’t be ‘naive,’ or iPhone sales could suffer\nThe iPhone maker may run into more problems next year if President-elect Donald Trump is set on erecting trade barriers with China. The country has threatened that iPhone sales will “ suffer a setback ” if Trump goes ahead with high tariffs on Chinese imports.\n“None of the previous presidents were bold enough to launch an all-out trade war against China,” according to the state-run Global Times. “They all opted for a cautious line since it’s most consistent with the overall interests of the U.S., and it’s most acceptable to U.S. society.”\nApple seems to be in a standoff with both angry consumers and an angry China Consumers Association, and if it turns out that there really is a serious issue affecting a much wider range of iPhones, Apple could potentially be in for a costly replacement program.\nUpdated on 12-2-2016 by Christian de Looper: Added news about CCA giving Apple a formal warning.\nChina to Trump: Don’t be ‘naive,’ or iPhone sales could suffer Apple may face questions after iPhone 7 Plus reportedly explodes following drop Apple planning a second research and development center in China",

      "text": "Apple products: they just work, unless you hold them wrong, or apparently, they’re exposed to too much air.\nDON’T MISS: Here comes the OLED iPhone 8\nFacing a growing numbers of iPhone 6s devices randomly shutting down due to battery problems, Apple has instituted a free repair program for some devices. In a message on its Chinese site (spotted by Business Insider ), the company explained what it thinks caused the battery issues in the first place:\n“We found that a small number of iPhone 6s devices made in September and October 2015 contained a battery component that was exposed to controlled ambient air longer than it should have been before being assembled into battery packs. As a result, these batteries degrade faster than a normal battery and cause unexpected shutdowns to occur. It’s important to note, this is not a safety issue.”\nIn true Apple style, the statement goes on to remind people that if their iPhone is breaking, it’s probably the fault of the dumb humans:\n“We also want our customers to know that an iPhone is actually designed to shut down automatically under certain conditions, such as extremely cold temperature. To an iPhone user, some of those shutdowns might seem unexpected, but they are designed to protect the device’s electronics from low voltage.”\nThus far, Apple says the problem is only limited to a select group of iPhone 6s devices. You can go check your phone’s serial number on an Apple webpage, which will tell you if you’re eligible for a free repair.\nIf you do qualify, your best bet seems to be to make an appointment at the Apple Store. According to reader reports we’ve been hearing, the repair is performed as a one-hour in-store procedure, but it will take a few weeks for the battery to come in to the store, even if you have Apple Care.\nAccording to Apple, the battery fault only affects some iPhone 6s models produced between September and October 2015. However, the China Consumers Association has said that Apple needs to take further measures, as the battery problem affects other iPhone versions, including the iPhone 6s Plus, iPhone 6, and iPhone 6 Plus.\nThere’s also a theory going around on the internet that the problems are being caused by iOS 10.1.1, and are not limited to the iPhone 6s. Apple has been adamant that this is a limited hardware problem, but it is possible that iOS 10.1.1 has a bug that’s causing battery draining or abrupt shutdowns as well. Apple has steadfastly avoided addressing that possibility so far.\nRelated:\nFor more news videos visit Yahoo View , available now on iOS and Android .\nTrending right now:\nHere’s how much money your cable company actually loses when you unsubscribe NES Classic and Hatchimals might actually be in stock at one store this weekend 12 paid iPhone apps on sale for free right now See the original version of this article on BGR.com",

      "text": "Apple stores around Bay Area targeted by grab-and-go thieves Share this: December 2, 2016 at 5:50 pm | UPDATED: December 2, 2016 at 6:32 pm \nIf the four thieves hadn’t gotten jammed up at the door on their way out of the Apple store with all their loot, they would’ve matched the speed of a very similar heist at the same San Francisco shop four days earlier. \nThat one took 11 seconds. \nAnd it appears both grab-and-go incidents were part of a Bay Area crime wave underway by a group of young men prone to wearing hoodies as they sweep up tens of thousands of dollars worth of electronics while customers and salespeople look on. \nSan Francisco police have released video from inside the Chestnut Street shop on the evenings the thefts occurred, calling the crimes retail grand theft. \nThe first video, from Nov. 25 — shopping extravaganza Black Friday — opens with a half dozen shoppers and an equal number of salespeople in the front portion of the store at 5:40 p.m.. Three young men in hoodies come in, take a few steps then start running around snatching devices that appear to be mostly iPhones from two nearby tables and along a counter. \nThe young men work so fast they don’t even appear to stow much of the loot, instead gathering it in their hands and arms as they rip more devices from their moorings. The employees look on. \nThe video from Nov. 29 opens with just one customer and two salespeople at the front of the shop, when four thieves, again in hoodies, come through the door. This time, the iPhone bandits hit the floor running, grabbing devices off the same two tables and counter area. \nOne employee escorts the customer toward the rear of the shop, while another two approach the phone filchers as they’re heading out, one of the employees making a shooing motion. \nThe first thief to hit the doors has some problem, perhaps of the “push-don’t-pull” variety, and the other three pile up behind before they burst onto the sidewalk. So this time, it’s 12 seconds from start to finish. \nReports suggest the thefts are the work of a group which has proven itself capable of violence. On Wednesday, thieves hit an Apple store in downtown Burlingame at around 7:45 p.m., KTVU reported. \nPolice said six to 10 young men in hoodies took about 45 seconds to steal $20,000 in iPads and iPhones off tables, according to KTVU. The thieves pushed two security guards to the floor and tried but failed to steal a gun from one of them, the station reported. \nIt was the third time the same store had been struck in the past month, the station reported. \nAnd there have been 11 such crimes by young men in hoodies in Apple stores in the Bay Area since late October, according to KTVU. There was another in San Francisco — the Stockton Street shop was hit the same night as the second theft at the Chestnut Street store — plus three in Berkeley in one week, another two in Burlingame, one in Los Gatos and one in Corte Madera on Black Friday. \nInvestigators believe the thefts are the work of the same group, and that after the manhandling of security guards and attempted gun theft in the latest incident, in Burlingame, they’re worried the men may be “escalating,” according to KTVU. \nApple did not immediately respond to a request from SiliconBeat for comment. A company spokesman told KTVU Apple did not discuss security matters. \nAfter the Berkeley thefts, a woman wrote on the Nextdoor neighborhood-news forum that an employee at the store had been left stressed and fearful that his life was in danger, news website Berkeleyside reported. \nIn one of the Berkeley thefts, the criminals wore ski masks, a woman told Berkeleyside. “I felt like I was in a ninja movie,” said the woman, who was not identified. “It was so stealthy and so well planned. \n“I love the Berkeley store but after this experience I may have to go somewhere else unless they do something about this. It was scary.” \nLaptops were among the items stolen in the one-minute stealing spree, she said. \nIn one of the thefts at the Berkeley store, which is in the Fourth Street shopping district, about 50 devices were stolen, and some 20 were taken in another of the incidents, according to Berkeleyside. \nA uniformed police officer is now posted at the Berkeley shop seven days a week, KTVU reported. Burlingame police told KTVU they would meet with Apple officials to discuss having the company pay for an officer to patrol the store. \nIn the 1:45 p.m. theft at the Village of Corte Madera mall, thieves stole $35,000 to $40,000 worth of iPhones and laptops, the Marin Independent Journal reported.

This story appears in the {{article.article.magazine.pretty_date}} issue of {{article.article.magazine.pubName}}. Subscribe \nIn my \" Apple is Doomed \" post the other day, one of the many claims I noted that's been running around is: \"E ven Apple's hardware is terrible.\" And there have been high-profile hardware issues with both the iPhone 6 (\"Bendgate\" and \"Touch Disease\") as well as the 6s which suffered from battery issues . But while it should probably come as no surprise some of the hundreds of million of iPhones sold each year have hardware issues, the question is whether Apple's handling of this is evidence of some decline in quality -- however that might be measured. Better late than never: See if your iPhone 6s battery needs fixing \nA Galaxy of woes \nIn most years since the iPhone's introduction nearly a decade ago, Apple has released just one new phone annually. That puts a great deal of pressure on the company to get it just right. Back in 2010, though, the iPhone 4 was in trouble almost from the moment it was released . The \"Antennagate\" fiasco was caused by a design flaw that Apple initially remedied by a combination of blaming users , offering free cases, and then redesigning the iPhone in subsequent models. \nApple would then go 4 years before experiencing a truly embarrassing iPhone hardware fiasco. The iPhone 6 brought a brand new design, with a thinner chassis that had some very clear weak points . The result was that the phone was prone to bending if placed in back pockets. Apple generally offered replacements to affected customers and made some small but critical design changes to the iPhone 6s chassis to make it much more difficult to bend. \nOver time, it seems an unfortunate side effect of the chassis flex -- at least for some iPhone 6 Plus users -- is that they later suffered a problem with their screens that became known as Touch Disease . Only very recently did Apple acknowledge the problem with a reduced cost repair program . Similarly, a long-known battery issue affecting some iPhone 6s owners was also recently given special status . \nThe elephant on the airplane . That brand-harming announcement is likely to be made for years to come, in no small part due to Samsung's slow and arguably inept handling of the exploding battery issues with that model. Not only was the Note 7 an actual danger, the public-relations nightmare surrounding it meant it had to be removed from the market entirely. ",

Subscribe Samsung Is Going To Include An Ai Assistant In Its Next Phone \nFollowing an increasing number of reports over the weekend both in the media and in online forums, Apple has acknowledged that there is an issue with calendar entry spam in iOS on both the iPhone and iPad, but as yet there is no timescale on addressing the issue. Apple iPhone 7 (image: Ewan Spence) \nApple's iCal system allows unauthenticated invites to events to be sent to users. This has resulted in iOS users receiving notifications on their iPhones and iPads to make a date to buy items such as Ugg Boots and Rayban sunglasses. With a limited number of options, most users are ignoring the invites and refusing to give the spammers the confirmation that the address they hold is valid. Others are moving the entries to 'junk' calendars and deleting them en masse. \nNo matter the MacGyvered solutions, each piece of incoming calendar spam is harming the user experience on iOS. Apple's response acknowledges the problem and hints at its first choice for a solution... working to prevent spam reaching the iCal clients: \nWe are sorry that some of our users are receiving spam calendar invitations. We are actively working to address this issue by identifying and blocking suspicious senders and spam in the invites being sent. \nAs with any spam trap, the success of the automated system relies on the ability to train the system. For the moment this means Apple's engineers will need to provide enough data so bogus invites can be recognized. I would expect that in the future the ability to mark calendar invites as spam will be added to the iOS application. If that is the case, expect the next update to iOS 10 to add in a 'report' button when acknowledging invites. \nFor the moment, Cupertino is on the case. ",

      "text": "Apple Tells NHTSA That Companies Entering Auto Industry Should Get the Same Rights As Establishment Friday December 2, 2016 9:28 PM PST by Husain Sumra Last week, Apple wrote a letter to the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration telling it that \"new entrants\" to the auto industry should get the same rights as the established companies in the industry, reports Venture Beat . Apple points out that established car manufacturers do not have toÂ pursue exemptions to the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards when attempting to test cars on public roads due to the Fixing America's Surface Transportation (FAST) Act. New entrants in the auto industry, like Google and others, are not granted the same right under the FAST Act. The Cupertino company argues that the best way to maximize safety benefits for autonomous vehicles, ensure fair competition and encourage innovation is for the NHTSA to amend policy to state that seeking exemptions isn't necessary for internal development vehicles on public roads. The other half of the letter, which is dated November 22, addresses the Federal Automated Vehicles policy and a proposed data sharing program. \"Apple agrees that companies should share de-identified scenario and dynamics data from crashes and near-misses,\" the letter says. \"Data should be sufficient to reconstruct the event, including time-series of vehicle kinematics and characteristics of the roadway and objects.\" Apple also points out that data sharing should not come at the expense of privacy, and that companies should invest resources to protect the \"individuals' fundamental right to privacy.\" In October, it was reported that Apple was abandoning its car plans \"for now.\" After numerous layoffs and reassignments, the remaining members of the Apple Car team were said to be focusing on autonomous systems . Dozens of employees are also working on a car operating system in Canada. The letter was signed by Apple VP of Product Integrity Steve Kenner, who used to be Ford's Global Director of Automotive Safety. It's not known when Kenner joined Apple, as his LinkedIn still lists Ford as his employer.",

      "text": "A former manager at Foxconn, the company that manufactures Apple’s iPhone handsets, allegedly stole 5,700 iPhones and sold them for $1.5 million, according to AsiaOne . The Taiwanese manager faces 10 years in prison. The Taiwanese testing department manager, identified by his family name Tsai, reportedly had eight employees smuggle out iPhone 5 and 5s devices, valued at over $1.5 million, between 2013 and 2014. The company first noticed the issue after an internal audit. Tsai was then arrested and bailed in 2016.\nThai was charged with breach of trust and faces 10 years in prison according to prosecutors. Foxconn has been hit with a few scandals in recent years from employee misconduct to labor disputes, according to AsiaOne.\nIn fact, in 2014, five former Foxconn employees were charged with breach of trust in Taiwan for soliciting $160 million in kickbacks from suppliers in exchange for buying their equipment. They were sentenced up to 10 years and six months in prison by a district court last month.\nFoxconn is one of Apple’s biggest suppliers, helping manufacture iPhones and other products for the Cupertino company. Foxconn has more than 1.3 million employees and has also been under the spotlight over labor unrest, employee suicides and the use of underage interns in recent years.\nRelated Articles\nCBS All Access Will Stream NFL Games, Starting This Sunday Here's How to Spot Dangerous, Counterfeit Apple Chargers",

      "text": "\n* Higher yields bolster banking, securities shares \n* Shares of Apple suppliers pressured \nTOKYO, Dec 2 (Reuters) - Japan's Nikkei share average was poised for a weekly gain but dipped as investors locked in gains ahead of U.S. jobs data later in the session, with losses kept in check as higher Japanese yields lifted financial shares. \nThe Nikkei was down 0.5 percent at the end of morning trade at 18,425.45, but up 0.2 percent for the week, in which it probed 11-month highs. \nThe broader Topix as well as the JPX-Nikkei Index 400 were both down 0.2 percent at 1,480.79 and 13,287.41 respectively. \n\"Profit-taking ahead of the weekend is the likely cause of today's Nikkei drop,\" said Hiroki Allen, chief representative of Superfund Japan in Tokyo, noting a spate of event risks ahead. \nBut shares of lenders and securities firms rose in line with higher yields on Japanese government bonds after yields on 10-year U.S. Treasuries jumped to their highest levels since June 2015. \nThe Tokyo Stock Exchange banking subindex gained 3.2 percent, and the securities subindex was up 3.5 percent. \n\"The banking and financial sector is really kicking all of this up, but what we're seeing this morning is people reacting to the uncertainties,\" said Gavin Parry, managing director of Parry International Trading in Hong Kong. \n\"We've got the jobs data tonight, with more probability of a negative shock than a positive shock, because the positive is already factored in,\" he said. \"We also have the Italian referendum on Sunday, which is a toss of a coin.\" \nEconomists polled by Reuters expect the nonfarm payrolls report to show that U.S. employers added 175,000 jobs in November, compared to 161,000 in October. \nIf the government loses Sunday's referendum on constitutional reform it will be harder for Italy's struggling banks to recapitalise, Economy Minister Pier Carlo Padoan said on Thursday. \nApple Inc's Japanese suppliers underperformed the broader market, after Apple reportedly began reducing orders for iPhone 7, according to DigiTimes. \nAlps Electric fell 3.3 percent, Taiyo Yuden shed 1.8 percent, and Murata Manufacturing dropped 2.9 percent.

      "title": "Österreich: Hofer verkauft wieder Apple iPhones und iPads",
      "text": "» News & Magazin-Redakteur Wie bereits im vergangenen Sommer verkauft der österreichische Diskonter Hofer, ein Ableger der deutschen Aldi-Gruppe, auch ab 8. Dezember wieder Apple-Geräte. Diesmal hat sich Hofer für das iPhone 6s mit 16 GB Speicher sowie für das iPad mini 2 ebenfalls mit 16 GB onboard Speicher entschieden. Beide Geräte werden von Apple nicht mehr in dieser Speicherkonfiguration verkaut sondern nur mehr mit 32 oder mehr GB Speicher. Für das iPhone 6s mit 32 GB verlangt Apple 649 Euro, für das iPad mini 2 mit 32 GB 289 Euro. Das Hofer-Angebot ist im Vergleich mit 539 Euro für das iPhone 6s und 229 Euro für das iPad mini 2 günstiger, doch lohnt es sich wirklich dafür am 8. Dezember frühmorgens vor den Hofer-Filialen in der Kälte auszuharren? Wir meinen: Nicht wirklich, denn abgesehen vom sehr knappen und nicht erweiterbaren Speicher reicht ein kurzer Blick auf Preisvergleichsseiten wie Geizhals um viele andere Händler zu finden, die ein iPhone 6s mit 16 GB Speicher ab 530 Euro verkaufen, darunter auch die Großen wie Saturn und Mediamarkt. Etwas anders sieht die Situation beim iPad mini 2 aus. Hier liegt der aktuell günstigste Preis bei 260 Euro, da ließen sich also doch noch mindestens 30 Euro sparen, sofern man mit 16 GB sein Auslangen findet. Hofer ist kein offizieller Apple-Händler und bekommt Apple-Geräte daher nicht direkt von Apple selbst sondern über Zwischenhändler. Die mittlerweile regelmäßigen Apple-Aktionen dienen wohl hauptsächlich der Befeuerung des Hofer Mobilfunkangebots Hot, welches 2015 sehr erfolgreich gestartet ist und mittlerweile schon 650.000 Kunden in Österreich gewonnen hat.

      "text": "By Tiernan Ray One Street observer this morning thinks yesterday’s sharp sell-off in tech names was a great opportunity to pick up a valuable name, Qualcomm ( QCOM ).\nQualcomm shares yesterday closed down $3.97, or almost 6%, at $64.16. The stock is down 16 cents at $69.06 this morning.\nNorthland Capital Markets ’s Tom Sepenzis today urges investors to “buy on the dip” Qualcomm’s shares, which he rates Outperform, with a $75 price target.\n“Expansion into new markets including the IoT, automotive and eventually, the server market add several avenues for upside over the next few years,” for Qualcomm, he writes.\nSepenzis, moreover, thinks Qualcomm is going to come out on top in the war for mobile baseband modem chips, where Intel ( INTC ) has lately been its biggest obstacle.\nIntel, you’ll recall, this year won part of the business to supply the modem in Apple’s ( AAPL ) iPhone that Qualcomm had previously had to itself for several iterations of the device.\nBut Sepenzis points to reports that Intel’s modem is slower than Qualcomm’s, and thinks Apple might cut off Intel if it continues to lag Qualcomm:\nThere have been several reports over the past month that have compared the speeds associated with both the INTC and QCOM modems in their respective iPhone models, with INTC coming up short. Apple apparently has throttled the speeds on the QCOM modems to keep the experience consistent across carriers, with the QCOM X12 modem capable of 600 mb/s while the INTC XMM 3360 modem tops out at 450 mb/ s. While Apple will certainly keep a second source if possible, it isn’t going to do so for too long if it has to handicap half of its devices. This should give QCOM a path towards recapturing all of Apple over the next two years if Intel doesn’t find an answer. Currently, the next generation INTC XMM 7480 modem is still capped at 450 mb/s. QCOM has already introduced the X16 modem, capable of 1 gb/s, the first gigabit modem.",

      "text": " 07 AM EST LG Introduces New Ultrafine 4K and 5K Displays \nChicago— With Apple’s thunderbolt displays out of the market, LG has decided to swoop in on the opportunity and create products for its proprietary architecture. The newest Apple MacBook Pro laptops have USB-C ports, steering away from the thunderbolt only connectivity. But, with the LG Ultrafine 4K and 5K displays, the ability to use an already existing thunderbolt-only display is doable again. These flagship monitors are also IPS displays, giving true depth of color. \nWith the rise in high-quality content, including 4K, 5K, and HDR, consumers are finding the need to stay on the bleeding edge becoming more pertinent. Consumers are pushed to get the newest, latest devices to keep up with the everchanging tech industry. For many though, the problem lies when invested in a branding such as Apple and then support for certain products is dropped. Many Apple devices relied on the thunderbolt port, and for those who have committed there are only certain compatible devices that are capable. \nFortunately, Ultrafine Display has stepped in and made it easier for the customer to decide what is best for them. LG has begun manufacturing their Ultrafine Monitors that will specifically suit those under the Apple branding, allowing all HD content to be consumed easily and compatibly, accommodating those with the newer USB-C connections, as well as those with thunderbolt display ports. All of this is done on a crisp IPS display, in either a 21.5-inch or 27-inch option. Unlike many vendors, Ultrafine Display aims to inform to user, giving every customer the knowledge they need to make a quality purchase on their LG monitor. \nThey not only describe the monitors themselves, giving you all the specifications to assess your needs, but they also ensure customer satisfaction through thorough breakdowns of the display. Listing all their pros and cons, and all its features, they aim to not keeping you in the dark on any aspect. \n“For any current Mac users, we can’t recommend this display enough.” \nFor Apple MacBook enthusiasts, the LG monitor is an excellent choice, and through Ultrafine Display , the customer becomes more knowledgeable with their potential purchase and can better define what suits them. With thunderbolt displays on older MacBook models no longer being produced, the new LG displays bring back the support while also supporting those who have adopted the newer USB-C connections. All of this is consumed on a crisp IPS 4K or 5K monitor. Ultrafine Display aims to show users how and why the new LG monitors can integrate well into their lives. Consumers have been pleased with the honest review, leading many to purchased a new LG display through their sincere guidance.",

      "text": "Apple expresses interest in autonomous vehicle testing in letter to NHTSA By Friday, December 02, 2016, 10:58 pm PT (01:58 am ET) In perhaps the most public admission of its automotive ambitions, Apple in a statement issued to the NHTSA in November proposed a policy update that would grant industry newcomers the same opportunities as established manufacturers when it comes to testing on public roads. In a letter to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, unearthed by VentureBeat , Apple director of product integrity Steve Kenner says the Federal Automated Vehicles Policy ( PDF link ) paves a safe and flexible path toward the development of automated vehicles, but suggests proposed regulations could be more open for companies new to the industry. The proposed policy was introduced by the Department of Transportation and the NHTSA in September as a set of regulations designed to govern the coming driverless car future, a scenario that could see technology firms like Apple and Google intermingle with the likes of Ford, Toyota and Volkswagen. Kenner in part echoes recent offhand affirmations from Apple CEO Tim Cook that the company is interested in bringing machine learning and automation tech to the personal transportation arena. The letter goes much deeper, however, outlining specific areas of attention and potential regulation modifications that suggest Apple has been investigating the space for some time. In particular, Kenner says at least three ethical dimensions require attention: implications of artificial decision making on safety, mobility, and legality; ensuring privacy and security in automated vehicle design; and the impact driverless vehicles will have on the public good, for example employment. As can be expected, Apple suggests open sharing of anonymized data —without infringing user privacy, of course —from crashes, near-misses and the similar incidents toward the construction of a comprehensive dataset to be accessible by all industry players. Such collaborative methods would help carmakers design and deploy increasingly accurate driverless systems, Apple says. While Apple seconded a number of banal policy proposals, the company took issue with certain exemptions for internal development testing. Specifically, Kenner notes the proposed policy's wording suggests companies need prior exemption for public road testing of vehicles not compliant with Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards. The federal government requires auto manufacturers test upcoming vehicles on public roads, and to that end recently added a Fixing America's Surface Transportation (FAST) Act proviso that allows \"established manufacturers\" to conduct such tests without an exemption from FMVSS. That same document does not present the same opportunity to \"new entrants.\" \"To maximize the safety benefits of automated vehicles, encourage innovation, and promote fair competition, established manufacturers and new entrants should be treated equally,\" Kenner writes. \"Instead of applying for exemptions, all companies should be given an opportunity to implement internal safety processes summarized in a Safety Assessment.\" Though the NHTSA is unable to modify the FAST Act, it can update the Federal Automated Vehicles Policy to bypass the requirement for exemptions, thus streamlining road testing for companies like Apple. Rumors of Apple's interest in creating a branded car surfaced early last year . Dubbed Project Titan, the internal initiative was reportedly staffed by more than 1,000 engineers and other personnel working out of top secret labs in Sunnyvale, Calif., some of whom were pulled from important consumer product teams. After what seemed to be an aggressive ramp up in development funding, Project Titan ran into trouble last September when sources said top executives expressed displeasure with the group's slow progress. Subsequent reports indicated the team faced mounting unforeseen obstacles that ultimately culminated in the axing of dozens of employees . According to the most recent rumblings, Apple has pivoted away from a full-fledged self-driving car platform and is now focusing on the development of autonomous vehicle software and supporting hardware. Interestingly, Apple's driverless product, if it ever materializes, might intersect with the company's augmented reality initiative. In October, reports claimed Apple is currently testing AR-based navigation and other autonomous vehicle solutions using virtual reality simulators. Topics:",

      "text": "| Analysis \nApple quietly removed Paul Deneve from its leadership website, as first noted by MacRumors . Mr. Deneve came from the fashion world and was Vice President of Special Projects at Apple. Prior to his stint at Apple, Mr. Deneve’s resume included companies and brands such as Yves Saint Laurent, Nina Ricci, Lanvin, Courreges, and oil-giant ExxonMobil. \nHis image and name have been removed from Apple’s Leadership page , and his personal bio now resolves to a “Page not found” placeholder. Apple hasn’t announced his departure, nor has Mr. Deneve announced a move. Put another way, it’s unknown if he left Apple or was terminated. \nHere’s the Way Back Machine archive of his personal bio: Paul Deneve’s Apple Bio from the Way Back Machine \nSpecial Projects was the group that developed Apple Watch, and Mr. Deneve was involved in marketing the device. His background in the fashion world was part of Apple’s push to position Apple Watch as a fashion accessory. Before Apple Watch, smartwatches were marketed as gadgets and devices for tech savvy nerds (like us). \nApple was able to change those perceptions for Apple Watch, a feat which few have paid much attention to. It is, however, a key part of how Apple was able to get Apple Watch out in front of more people. Whither Mr. Deneve? \nThe question to me is why he left Apple. Did he simply get a new opportunity? Was Tim Cook unhappy with him? Is Apple backing away from its push to make Apple Watch a fashion accessory? \nWe simply don’t have any answers for such questions yet, but I suspect Mr. Deneve left on his own accord. There’s been no indication of a change in marketing direction for Apple Watch, aside from Apple playing up more of the device’s fitness-oriented abilities. Straps are still important, finish is still important, design is still important, and Apple Watch is still being pitched as a fashion accessory. \nThe reality is that executives like Paul Deneve are in high demand, especially when they did several years at Apple. He was first hired by Apple in 2013. It’s unknown when he left Apple, but it’s most likely this week. Share this:",

Pimp My Zimmer: Elderly residents at an Essex carehome look super fly \nStations affected included Victoria, Oxford Circus, Bond Street, Knightsbridge, Green Park, Holborn, Finsbury Park, Highbury & Islington, Marble Arch, Warren Street, Walthamstow, and Queensway. \nThis morning there is fresh hell on the Piccadilly and Northern Lines. The Piccadilly Line is struggling because of faulty wheels that need repairing. \nThere are also minor delays on the Central, District and Overground lines. \nYesterday evening a woman rushing for a train at Kings Cross slipped and fell off the platform causing chaos at one of the capital’s busiest stations. Public service message: don't even think about getting into Oxford Circus tube station pic.twitter.com/OcnCBYNqmu \n— Subhajit Banerjee (@subhajitb) November 30, 2016 \nA witness said she fell following a surge on the platform when it was announced a delayed train to Leeds would leave ‘in two minutes. \nShe told the Standard: ‘Moments after setting off the train stopped and we were advised that someone was stuck under the train and we were evacuated. \n‘I think it may have been more to do with the fact they confirmed the platform two minutes prior to departure so everyone was running to make the train.’ \nShe was taken to hospital where she was treated for non-life threatening injuries. \nPeople said there was an ‘information blackhole’ as they tried to make their way home yesterday evening.

Oxford Circus became a no-go zone with the enter junction pretty much blocked by commuters who couldn’t get onto the underground. \nZoe Loftus-Bell described the panicked scenes as emergency alarms sounded at Kings Cross. \nShe said: ‘I walked to Euston and by the time I arrived they begun to evacuate that too. To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video \n‘Staff told me to go into a tunnel then closed it from the other side so I felt trapped, everyone was panicking and flustered. I’m okay despite a few elbows to the head.’ \nA TfL spokesman said: ‘It was unquestionably a difficult day with issues on a number of different lines that made journeys home very difficult, for which we sincerely apologise.

      "text": "Even though Apple has long been one of the most successful, profitable and closely-observed tech companies on the planet, it’s absolutely dumbfounding how often armchair pundits and analysts manage to get everything wrong about the company. In a dynamic that still defies explanation, Apple’s success is rarely applauded; on the contrary, its success is often used to justify the position that the company has peaked and is about to undergo an unforgiving fall from grace. \nDON’T MISS:  Here’s how much money your cable company actually loses when you unsubscribe \nThat notwithstanding, the sentiment that Apple has lost its ability to innovate, meaningfully increase revenue and otherwise succeed has seemingly grown by leaps and bounds over the past few months. From critics bemoaning the MacBook Pro’s new Touch Bar as nothing more than a gimmick to analysts criticizing the iPhone 7 for sporting the same form factor as the two previous iPhone models, the idea that “Apple is doomed” is not only persistent, but is arguably more prevalent than it’s been in years.\nSure, Apple has the iPhone 8 coming out next year, and sure, analysts believe that the device will shatter all existing iPhone sales records, but that’s apparently as high as Apple will be able to go, according to some. In fact, analysts at Oppenheimer believe that Apple will soon “embark on a decade-long malaise.”\nIn a research note obtained by Business Insider , Opppenheimer writes: “Apple lacks the courage to lead the next generation of innovation (AI, cloud-based services, messaging); instead will become more reliant than ever on the iPhone … We believe Apple is about to embark on a decade-long malaise. The risks to the company have never been greater.”\nNothing in the tech sphere is ever predictable, but I think we can all agree that predicting where a company will be in 10 years is utterly absurd. Consider this: the iPhone didn’t even exist 10 years ago. Even in a more compressed time frame, look at how quickly Netflix managed to turn into an entertainment juggernaut and how quickly Microsoft managed to turn things around with Satya Nadella at the helm.\nThe idea that Apple lacks the “courage” to be at the vanguard of the next generation of innovation is certainly interesting, and not wholly without merit, but it completely ignores the fact that no one at this point knows what the next great area of innovation will be. Will it in fact be AI? Or will it be augmented reality? Or, perhaps, virtual reality? Or maybe it will be something completely different, something that’s not on anyone’s radar at the moment.\nMicrosoft famously missed the wave of smartphone innovation that Apple ushered in when it released the iPhone. Apple, however, has yet to miss a wave of innovation. Consequently, the idea that Apple is about to fall into a “decade-long malaise” seems a bit off the mark.\nApple certainly faces a number of challenges, but it’s always struck me as peculiar that Apple is never afforded the benefit of the doubt when it has a long track record of delivering innovative products to the marketplace.\nOppenheimer’s note concludes: “We believe its strong profitability, a cash hoard for protection, and one last ‘growth’ hurrah from the tenth-anniversary phone will keep investors interested in the company.”\nFunny thing is, analysts have been predicting Apple’s ‘last growth hurrah’ for years on end.\nTrending right now: \nYou get one last chance to buy a NES Classic Edition before Christmas NES Classic and Hatchimals might actually be in stock at one store this weekend This dude actually built a portable, wearable Tesla coil gun See the original version of this article on BGR.com",

      "text": "Apple founder Steve Jobs Advertisement \nHe changed technology and how the world communicates. Now, five years after he died, Apple founder Steve Jobs may be remembered in another way — on a Paris street. \n“Rue Steve Jobs” is among names shortlisted for one of the new roads in the French capital’s southeastern 13th arrondissement that will lead to a new incubator for hi-tech start-ups. \nThe tech titan’s name was put forward by the district’s socialist mayor who credited Jobs — whose company altered the face of computing, revolutionised music with the iPod and launched the iPhone and iPad — with “changing our daily lives”. \nBut the mayor, Jerome Coumet, has faced a backlash from elected Communists, who in a statement said “the reality of the legacy” of Jobs was “insufficient wages” and “forced overtime” for Apple subcontractors. Advertisement \nThey also hit out at what they alleged was the technology giant’s “use of illegal tax arrangements” across the globe. \nCoumet said he was not seeking controversy. “I wanted a name that speaks to as many people as possible,” he said. \nAmong other suggestions was Alan Turing, in memory of the British mathematician and computer scientist whose wartime work allowed the allies to crack German codes and defeat Nazism. \nGrace Murray Hopper, an American computer scientist and former Navy rear admiral who pioneered coding, is also proposed. \nCurrently dubbed Station F, names for the start-up hub are to be discussed by Paris council officials in December, before it opens in March next year.

      "text": "To ensure more buyers, it will move to a dedicated distribution centre managed by its global logistics partner, DB Schenker, at Bhiwandi, near Mumbai. (Reuters) How much does an Apple iPhone cost in India? While there are many models of the phone available, there is no one price that these, or for that matter, any Apple product, sell at. But the Cupertino-based tech giant may soon remove that anomaly, by setting up its centre in India; this would not only bring price parity, but also help stock products in adequate numbers. Starting 2017, the iPhone, iPad and Mac computers will be available in more Indian cities. That apart, the company will also work with a host of application providers. To ensure more buyers, it will move to a dedicated distribution centre managed by its global logistics partner, DB Schenker, at Bhiwandi, near Mumbai. That should add to Apple’s muscle at a time when it is the country’s second-largest-selling smartphone brand by revenue in FY16. It will also allow Apple to ease operations and streamline logistics and supply-chains for an easier transition to the GST regime.\nMoreover, once the Bhiwandi centre is set up, the company can provide hardware tailored to the needs of its corporate clients. But will the “pivot to India” be enough to revive Apple’s fortunes (they have sagged, lately)? For a country fuelled by aspirations, Apple represents a premium brand. But with the likes of Google and Samsung offering products at a premium and that too a plethora of new features, just new stores may prove to be a game-changer for the company.",

      "text": "As I started the DirecTV Now app on my Apple TV, Storage Wars spilled across my screen — and I couldn’t change the channel fast enough.\nMy reflex wasn’t related to my feelings about the A&E show. Rather, it’s a critique of DirecTV’s new cord-cutting service. Whether you watch its live television service through your Apple TV, iPad, iPhone, or computer’s web browser, the video feed comes on instantly — just like it would if you were watching a normal TV. And that’s both a great decision and terrible design, b ecause through over-the-top services like DirecTV Now, television essentially works like a utility. So, just like your water faucet or lights, beware of leaving the TV running, as I’ll explain.\nBut first, it’s worth explaining what DirecTV Now actually is. Pulling video from DirecTV (without needing a satellite dish), the service takes aim at cable companies by delivering television programming over the Internet. DirecTV Now offers four packages ranging in price from $35 to $70 per month, which include between more than 60 to at least 120 channels of live and on-demand video, along with some local stations. Though I only tested the service on Apple gear, it’s also accessible via Amazon , Android, Chrome and Google’s Cast devices.\nGet Data Sheet , Fortune’s technology newsletter.\nWith no installers giving me a four-hour setup window, wonky company-owned gear, or annoying contracts, DirecTV Now’s setup is advertised to be a snap. Despite a couple of hiccups, that claim held true.\nStill, immediately after plugging my credit card information into DirecTV’s website, my computer’s web browser required an update of Microsoft’s Silverlight software and a restart in order to view the video stream. Once that software was in place, the first show I pulled up, ESPN’s SportsCenter, froze, displaying an error message: “Hmm… this video is taking a little bit longer than usual to load. Thanks for your patience!” Given that it was launch day, it’s likely new users were rushing to the service, thus the clogged pipes. But since then, other errors have interrupted my viewing, something I never experienced while watching cable TV.\nAnd when it came time to watch my favorite shows, I encountered another unpleasant surprise. It began by me searching the service for “Colbert” and finding nothing. I looked for “Late Show” instead and found 15 shows and three movies, but not The Late Show with Stephen Colbert . (And demonstrating DirecTV’s unsatisfying search capabilities, the movies Clean Slate and 28 Days Later were two of the results). Turns out Colbert isn’t available on DirecTV Now, because CBS is surprisingly not included in the package, opting to go direct to consumers with its own subscription-based app instead.\nLeslie Moonves, CEO of CBS , on Maximizing Distribution for Content\nWith more than 120 channels, it’d be exhaustive to list every offering here. So instead I performed some highly unscientific research of asking my friends what their appointment TV-viewing shows are. HBO’s shows were a popular response, and the pay channel (as well as Cinemax) are available as add-ons or a rock-bottom price of $5 per month. Sports fans will delight that the MLB, NHL, NBA, and SEC’s respective networks are included, though DirecTV’s NFL offering is not. Reality TV connoisseurs will lament the lack of Survivor and Amazing Race, since CBS isn’t offered. Drama watchers get a mixed bag, missing out on shows like NCIS (CBS, again) but getting all of AMC’s award-winners. And kids make out great in the deal, with three different Disney channels and two Nickelodeons.\nAnother major selling point is DirecTV Now’s ability to stream local channels, which makes it good for people who enjoy their regional newscasts. But less publicized is that the local TV stations it offers are from major markets only, and vary wildly in consistency. For instance, if you live in Chicago, you’ll get local ABC and NBC, but not FOX. And it gets worse from there — there’s not a a single local station to be found where I live in the Pacific Northwest.\nDirecTV Now’s video has mostly streamed crisply and quickly, nearly equaling the responsiveness of my Comcast setup on my television and my iPad. But it’s worth noting that the resolution of the DirecTV video, while clear, didn’t appear to be high definition. Testing it on a 43-inch HDTV, the image looked slightly blurry, and I don’t have high expectations for better image clarity on a larger screen.\nHere’s Why AT&T’s DirecTV Now Service Isn’t as Good as It Could Be\nAnd speaking of that big screen experience, DirecTV Now’s Apple TV interface is a mess. When you launch the app, you’re thrust into whichever show is on the channel you left off watching. Swiping down on the touch pad reveals a bare-boned menu, the same display that appears when you press the remote’s ‘menu’ button. But if you swipe up instead, up pops a richer menu full of channel and show options. Swiping left and right changes the channel, which I wish I had known at the outset.\nCuriously, though you can use the Siri Remote’s microphone button to dictate search terms, you can’t use Siri to select a program on DirecTV Now, like you can with Hulu and other apps. I’d expect this to change in the near future, but Apple TV still feels like a hobby to the company, despite its claims to the contrary.\nYou can also pause live television on DirecTV Now, but you can’t fast forward or rewind it, at least not that I could tell. Some live programs let you rewind them completely to watch from the start, while others give you no such option. And there’s no obvious reason why this is the case — it’s probably due to obscure contract negotiations, but to a user it feels utterly random.\nThis odd twist doesn’t seem to involve DirecTV Now’s on-demand library. The service boasts more than 15,000 videoes, which may seem like a solid number until you start digging in to the offerings. For example, my wife hunkered down to watch the previous night’s episode of This Is Us , only to discover that the most recent episode available DirecTV Now was from Oct. 31., making it three episodes behind terrestrial TV. So while this over-the-top service may be good for people who like live television, DirecTV Now subscribers better not be late to the couch.\nThen again, a key selling point for this cord-cutting package is that AT&T wireless customers don’t need to watch TV on the couch at all. Though customers of any wireless provider can subscribe to DirecTV Now, AT&T customers get their data “zero-rated,” meaning it doesn’t count against their monthly data limits. The arrangement comes after AT&T acquired DirecTV in 2015 in a $49 billion deal.\nWhy the FCC Is Blasting Verizon and AT&T Over Net Neutrality\nThat’s a sweet deal for AT&T users. But it’s a controversial one, too. While telecoms like AT&T t love zero-rating deals because they can provide a competitive advantage, detractors argue such deals can make it harder for upstart services to compete, as users will opt to stream content via a service that won’t kill their data budget. It’s a bit of an abstract debate, but it’s worth considering as you weigh your streaming options.\nEven if zero-rating doesn’t bug you, DirecTV’s impact on your high-speed Internet bill just might. Just like years ago when mobile data providers started to clamp down on unlimited data caps, many broadband carriers recently have started doing the same. In the past, Internet Service Providers like Comcast have throttled the Internet speeds of customers who downloaded huge quantities of data. Now the country’s largest ISP is charging its customers higher rates when their monthly downloads exceed one terabyte. Today’s DirecTV Now customers may not have to worry about hitting that limit, but as more people stream 4K video (which is not currently available on this service, but is the future of video, and is not being earnestly deployed by data limit-free cable television services), this will be an issue to sweat.\nSo, when I say that I couldn’t turn off Storage Wars soon enough, this far off digital doomsday is what I was eyeing. While it’s nice to ape old school television with instant-on video feeds, it’s also entirely unnecessary, and will only eat up precious megabytes. This may seem like a minor point, but like DirecTV Now in general, it will be a major shift in how we think about television. People who leave the tube on for background noise or like to fall asleep watching television will need to change their ways if they subscribe to DirecTV Now. Forget Storage Wars . Bandwidth wars are up next.\nThis story was originally published on TIME .",

      "text": "There is a chance Intel could lose its hard won place in Apple’s iPhone if the performance of its wireless modem chips continues to lag behind competitor Qualcomm , an analyst warned on Friday.\nApple finally chose Intel to supply chips for a large portion of its iPhone 7 models. Qualcomm, which had provided all of the modem chips on last year’s iPhone 6s, supplied chips for the remainder. But a variety of reports have surfaced that the Intel chips lack some features and lag behind the performance of the Qualcomm chips.\nThe performance tests have been questioned, however. Apple told several web sites earlier this month that its own testing “shows there is no discernible difference in the wireless performance of any of the models.” That then led to allegations Apple was throttling the performance of the Qualcomm chips to maintain parity between different iPhone models.\nJust based on published technical specifications, Qualcomm’s X12 modem used in the iPhone 7 has a maximum speed of 600 megabits per second. That’s compared to a maximum of 450 megabits per second for Intel’s XMM 3360 modem, also in the iPhone 7, Tom Sepenzis, an analyst at Northland Capital Markets, pointed out in a report on Friday. And the next generation Qualcomm qcom modem, the X16, has a top speed of one gigabit per second compared to the same 450 megabits per second high end for Intel’s next-gen XMM 7480 modem.\nGet Data Sheet , Fortune’s technology newsletter.\n“While Apple will certainly keep a second source if possible, it isn’t going to do so for too long if it has to handicap half of its devices,” Sepenzis wrote. “This should give QCOM a path towards recapturing all of Apple over the next two years if Intel doesn’t find an answer.”\nIntel intc declined to comment. Fortune asked Apple aapl for comment and will update this story is a response is received.\nIt’s far from certain that Apple will abandon its two supplier strategy, however, Sepenzis tells Fortune . “I only mentioned it as a possibility if Intel doesn’t improve its throughput speed relative to Qualcomm over the next couple of years,” he says. Qualcomm could recapture the share lost to Intel, but the analyst says he wasn’t predicting that it “definitely would.”",

      "text": "Apple Drops Hints About Autonomous-Vehicle Project -- Update December 03, 2016, 03:05:00 AM EDT By Dow Jones Business News Shutterstock photo By Tim Higgins and Tripp Mickle \nApple Inc. took its biggest step toward acknowledging it is working on autonomous vehicles, writing a letter to U.S. regulators offering feedback on proposed guidelines for the emerging technology. \nThe letter from Steve Kenner, Apple's director of product integrity, to the head of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration offered no details on the project, but said Apple \"is investing heavily in the study of machine learning and automation, and is excited about the potential of automated systems in many areas, including transportation.\" \nApple has looked at doing an entire car, but more recently its focus has narrowed to developing an autonomous- driving system and software. Focusing on software is more in line with the company's historic expertise and fits its efforts to improve machine-learning capabilities that allow computers to adjust their behavior without being explicitly programmed. \nApple's five-page letter, dated Nov. 22, appears on the NHTSA website. It isn't clear when it was posted. \n\"We've provided comments to NHTSA because Apple is investing heavily in machine learning and autonomous systems,\" Apple spokesman Tom Neumayr said Friday. \"There are many potential applications for these technologies, including the future of transportation, so we want to work with NHTSA to help define the best practices for the industry.\" \nThe letter comes as the Obama administration rushes to put guidelines in place to help guide self-driving development. Alphabet Inc.'s self-driving project had already collected more than 2 million miles of public-roadway testing and General Motors Co. this year competed a $1 billion deal to acquire Cruise Automation to jump start its autonomous vehicle program. \nIn the letter to NHTSA, Apple called on the regulator to work quickly to adopt new safety rules and process requests for exemptions from existing traffic rules. Mr. Kenner said by \"improving regulatory flexibility,\" the agency would foster more innovation and encourage \"the development of life-saving technology.\" \nNot surprisingly, the letter showed Apple's autonomous-vehicle ambitions go beyond the U.S. Mr. Kenner encouraged the agency to work with international groups such as the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe and others to develop a \"harmonized approach to automated vehicles.\" \nWrite to Tim Higgins at Tim.Higgins@WSJ.com and Tripp Mickle at Tripp.Mickle@wsj.com (END) Dow Jones Newswires 12-03-160305ET Copyright (c) 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

      "text": "Instinet Equity Research lowered its iPhone sales estimates for the current quarter on \"sedate\" demand for Apple 's ( AAPL ) new flagship smartphone, the iPhone 7.\nOn the plus side, demand for Apple's high-end iPhone 7 Plus is \"robust,\" but the handset remains in short supply, Instinet analyst Jeffrey Kvaal said in a research report Thursday.\n\"Consumer preference for the supply-constrained (iPhone) 7 Plus model has left (iPhone) 7 demand solid if uninspired and leads our unit estimates back toward consensus,\" Kvaal said. IPhone 7 Plus wait times remain about three to four weeks, he said. The Plus model has been hindered by a tight supply of the dual-camera module, Kvaal said.\nKvaal lowered his iPhone sales target for the current quarter to 76 million units from 78 million, bringing him in line with consensus estimates.\nHe raised his estimate for average selling price to $693 from $687 thanks to a greater contribution from the premium iPhone 7 Plus.\n\"We believe consumers are in general waiting for the 7 Plus rather than purchasing other models, thus expect Plus demand to be slightly above seasonal in the March quarter,\" Kvaal said.",

      "text": "Apple's iCloud Activation Lock, designed to disable stolen iOS devices, can be bypassed by fiddling with the login screen and iPad smart cover, potentially letting thieves wipe the devices and resell them.\nIn a report published this week, a security blogger identified a creative way to disable Activation Lock. Hemanth Joseph, a self-described \"cyber security enthusiast\" from India, uploaded a YouTube video in which he floods an iPad's Wi-Fi network login screen with character inputs and then opens and closes its Smart Cover .\nDoing so takes advantage of a loophole in Apple's Wi-Fi login system: its password field apparently has no character limit, so entering an extremely long password will cause it to crash, after which opening and closing the iPad's smart cover will cause it to display the home screen. From there, a thief could restore the device as new and sell it online.",

      "text": "A former manager at Apple manufacturer Foxconn apparently had a lucrative iPhone theft scheme going on for some time, but is now the one about to pay.\nCiting Taiwanese prosecutors, AsiaOne reports that the man, who is identified by his family name Tsai, has been indicted for stealing thousands of iPhones in China. From 2013 to 2014, the man and his accomplices reportedly stole around 5,700 iPhones and sold them to stores, raking in nearly $2.2 million. Tsai alone reportedly pocketed $1.56 million in the scheme.\nAccording to the report, he worked in the iPhone testing department and \"instructed eight employees at Foxconn's factory in the southern mainland Chinese city of Shenzhen to smuggle out about thousands of iPhone 5 and iPhone 5s.\" They then sold the phones, which were supposed to be trashed, to stores in Shenzhen.\nFoxconn discovered the scheme during an internal audit, and alerted Taiwanese authorities, according to AsiaOne. Tsai has been charged with \"breach of trust\" and is facing 10 years in jail.",

      "text": "Home / News / Fitness News / Apple Watch now lets you buy accessories from the App Store Apple Watch now lets you buy accessories from the App Store \nby Sean Keach Read Comments \nApple will now let you make App Store accessory purchases using the Apple Watch thanks to a brand new update. \nThe latest version of the Apple Store app now includes purchase support for the Apple Watch. As of Version 4.1, users can buy accessories with a single tap on the Apple Watch. \nHowever, you’ll only be able to buy items from your ‘Favourites’ list, and you’ll only be able to add items to that list from another iOS device, or via the Apple websites. \nThe app update also introduces iOS 10 rich notification support for “many activities”, as well as various improvements and performance enhancements. \nTo get the new update, you’ll need to be running watchOS 3 on the Apple Watch, or iOS 9 on your iPhone or iPad. And if you want the rich notifications upgrade, you’ll need iOS 10 instead. The total download size for the app – with the new features – is 70.9MB. \nThe latest version of Apple’s flagship wearable is the Apple Watch Series 2, which launched back in September this year. \nWe gave the smartwatch a 4/5 score in our review, praising its bright, beautiful screen, great fitness tracking, versatile GPS, solid battery life, and snappy performance. \nThe watch features a 38mm or 42mm case (depending on your chosen model), built-in GPS, 50 metre water-resistance, a heart rate sensor, and a 1,000 nits OLED display. Here’s our verdict: \n“The Apple Watch 2 might not look any different, but the refinements that Apple has made are all spot on. If you want a smartwatch that doubles as a solid fitness tracker then this is a fantastic option.” \nWatch: Apple Watch Series 2 review \nWhat do you think of the Apple Watch Series 2?

      "text": "By Tim Higgins and Tripp Mickle\nApple Inc. took its biggest step toward acknowledging it is working on autonomous vehicles, writing a letter to U.S. regulators offering feedback on proposed guidelines for the emerging technology.\nThe letter from Steve Kenner, Apple's director of product integrity, to the head of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration offered no details on the project, but said Apple \"is investing heavily in the study of machine learning and automation, and is excited about the potential of automated systems in many areas, including transportation.\"\nCupertino, Calif.-based Apple has been working on its car effort, code-named Project Titan, for several years, but has never publicly acknowledged it. The secrecy has made the exact status of Project Titan hard to pinpoint. The Wall Street Journal reported in September that Apple had restructured some elements of the project, which has had several hundred employees working on it, after placing it under veteran Apple executive Bob Mansfield in July.\nThe five-page letter, dated Nov. 22, appears on the NHTSA website. It isn't clear when it was posted.\n\"We've provided comments to NHTSA because Apple is investing heavily in machine learning and autonomous systems,\" Apple spokesman Tom Neumayr said Friday. \"There are many potential applications for these technologies, including the future of transportation, so we want to work with NHTSA to help define the best practices for the industry.\"\nThe letter comes as the Obama administration rushes to put guidelines in place to help guide self-driving development. Alphabet Inc.'s self-driving project had already collected more than 2 million miles of public-roadway testing and General Motors Co. this year competed a $1 billion deal to acquire Cruise Automation to jump start its autonomous vehicle program.\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\nDecember 03, 2016 02:29 ET (07:29 ",

      "text": "Gene Kim\nFor Apple's important holiday quarter, management is guiding for the company's gross profit margin to drop between 160 and 210 basis points.\nWhen viewed alongside the year-over-year declines in the three quarters before it, this underwhelming guidance for the important profitability metric could be a cause for concern for some investors.\nBut a closer look at what's going on with Apple's gross profit margin suggests the tech giant is probably doing better than it looks when it comes to profitability.\nWhat's affecting Apple's gross profit margin? For its first fiscal quarter of 2017, which coincides with the fourth calendar quarter of 2016, Apple management expects gross margin to be between 38% and 38.5%, down from 40.1%. Even if Apple achieves the midpoint of its guidance range for gross profit margin, this would undoubtedly mark a notable decline. But investors shouldn't fret; there's good reason for the year-over-year pullback.\nWhen asked about Apple's lower-than-expected guidance for its first-quarter gross profit margin, Apple CFO Luca Maestri broke down the factors that are driving the difference in the year-ago gross profit margin and Apple's guidance:\n40 basis points in the year-ago gross profit margin were driven by a $548 million award for a patent infringement. 60 to 70 basis points of the difference between the two periods is simply due to currency headwinds. Finally, Maestri said he expected higher cost structures of new products to negatively impact the year-over-year comparison. In other words, after excluding impacts of Apple's patent infringement award in the year-ago quarter and currency headwinds, management only anticipates its first-quarter gross profit margin to decline between about 55 and 115 basis points year over year. Further, much of this expected year-over-year decline in gross profit margin is expected to be a factor of higher cost structures; so, Apple's profitability doesn't seem to be suffering from any negative secular trends -- unless, of course, this higher cost structure for the quarter is the beginning of a sustained period of rising costs.\nBut it's unlikely higher costs are here to stay. Apple has dealt with temporary higher cost structures in the past, when it launched the iPad Mini and at times when it refreshed lots of its product lines around the same time.\nZoom out Looking beyond a tough, and arguably unfair, year-over-year comparison, there's probably an even better reason for Apple investors not to be concerned: A zoomed-out view of Apple's quarterly gross profit margin over a period of several years shows that a gross margin of around 38% to 38.5% isn't really so abnormal for the company. Between the fourth quarter of 2013 and the fourth quarter of 2016, Apple's gross margin has bounced around between about 37% and 40.1%.\nThe Motley Fool\nSo Apple's expected gross profit margin during the first fiscal quarter of 2017 certainly isn't anything to be excited about. But it's also not worth worrying about.\nWhen should investors start worrying about Apple's gross profit margin? If the key metric ever begins to consistently trend downward for more than a few years, this could be more indicative of more secular negative factors, such as declining pricing power, permanently higher cost structures, or unfavorable products mix shifts, that could be here to stay.\nOf course, it doesn't hurt for investors to look into quarter-to-quarter volatility of Apple's gross profit margin, given how important it is to an investing thesis in Apple stock. As a cash cow, anything that hinders the company's ability to rake in high levels of profits is worth a closer look.\nIn this particular case, the driving force behind Apple's lower gross profit margin doesn't look like it's a problem. Indeed, I'd argue that Apple's gross profit margin today continues to support the company's impressive ability at sustaining pricing power and scale in evolving markets.\nRead the original article on The Motley Fool .

Are you a techie who knows how to write? Then join our Team! Especially wanted: German-English-Translator - Details here Samsung isn't the only company having battery problems this year: according to a document posted to Apple's website, the recent slew of iPhone 6s battery failures (which have led to an exchange program ) are the result of a component being improperly stored before battery assembly, reports ZDNet. The exposure of the component to air leads to faster battery degradation and failures. The manufacturing issue has no impact on safety and poses no risks at all to consumers, Apple stresses, eager to avoid comparisons between the iPhone 6s and Samsung's Note 7 battery woes. If you are an iPhone 6s owner, check here to determine if your phone is affected by this defect. The 6s's battery defect again draws the attention of critics to Apple's iPhone warranty service.

      "text": "The first fashion shoot with the iPhone 7 Plus Portrait mode \nHey, remember data? Well, it had a good run but… it’s dead now. \nWriting for MarketWatch , Bret Kenwell muses aloud “Did Google's Pixel Beat Apple's iPhone?” (Tip o’ the antlers to Philip Speicher .) \nAh! Good question! Turns out that the answer to that question is actually in the piece you wrote: No. \nYou should just look down a few paragraphs. Or not write link-baiting headlines. Seems like there are at least a couple of options here. \nGoogle's Pixel device crushed the iPhone on activation rates between Black Friday and Cyber Monday. \nThat is actually the exact opposite of what the data shows, but you can’t make a subtitle omelette without breaking a few truth eggs and getting the yolk all over the gas range and, oh, God, now it’s on your hands and the phone is ringing… \nDoes Pixel beat iPhone? Sort of. \nOr sort of… not. \nWhile Alphabet's Pixel phone may have seen very impressive activation numbers, the overall volume did not surpass Apple's iPhone 7 volume over the Black Friday to Cyber Monday stretch. \nSo. The iPhone beat the Pixel. The opposite of what everything up until now implies. \nOh, wait! is this piece meant to be a Choose Your Own Adventure book? What an exciting twist! \nThe Google Pixel saw activations climb a whopping 112% compared to the previous four weekends, according to Localytics. Meanwhile, the iPhone 7 saw activation growth of just 13%. \nActivation growth rates are predicated on original activation numbers. If original activation numbers are low… you see how this works. \nOne could argue the iPhone was introduced earlier this year (September) while the Pixel came out in October. \nYes! One could argue that! Since, you know, it’s exactly what happened. \nBut that excuse seems somewhat thin given that the period between Black Friday and Cyber Monday saw such record spending amounts. \nWhich Apple took more of, at least in part because there were deeper discounts for the Pixel than the iPhone (tip o’ the antlers to @mylestaylor ). What is so hard about this? \nDoes this bode poorly for Apple? Perhaps. \nActually selling more phones than Google is bad news for Apple. \nWelp. \nThere’s that.

      "text": "Home / Mobile / IPad 5, iPhone 5S to power Apple’s vacation season — file IPad 5, iPhone 5S to power Apple’s vacation season — file Admin 3 hours ago Mobile \nApple’s iPhone 5S is considerably outpacing the iPhone 5C in sales, and at least one analyst believes that trend will continue into the holiday season. \nThe iPhone 5S is outselling the iPhone 5C at a ratio of two.5-to-1, Can accord Genius analyst Michael Walleye wrote in a observe to investors on Wednesday. That news is obviously excellent for Apple, which generates extra income on the iPhone 5S than iPhone 5C, but it surely also cements Wally’s belief that Apple will promote 52.5 million iPhone during the closing quarter of the year. \nThe primary quarter of 2014 must also be bolstered by using China cellular, Walleye mentioned. The crown jewel in Apple’s Wi-Fi plans must ultimately start shipping the iPhone early next yr to its greater than 750 million subscribers, which may add over 10 million iPhone unit sales to Apple’s financials, Walleye said. \nThe iPad 5 could also be a winner for Apple thru the remainder of the 12 months. Walleye believes Apple will announce a major iPad 5 redecorate at its special experience on October 22 to be able to spur increased gross sales. Walleye can be unsure when the iPad Mini with Retina display might hit store shelves, further complicating gross sales forecasts on that tool. Therefore, within the quick-time period, Apple may expect the iPad 5 to force its pill sales. \n“We are modeling iPad 5 and iPad Mini gadgets at 12.9M/11.5M for the December quarter,” Walleye wrote to buyers. “We look forward to this sales mix will reverse to 8.4M/14.4M within the March quarter driven by way of the delayed launch of a refreshed iPad Mini with Retina display and increased iPad Mini demand from global markets, particularly in China around Chinese language New 12 months.” \nOne other tidbit from the Walleye document: he expects Apple to launch its lengthy-awaited smart watch and television in the future in its 2015 fiscal year, which starts in October of 2014. \nWalleye has reiterated his “buy” recommendation on Apple shares and has upped his 12-month value target to $580.",

      "text": "Reddit They apparently didn’t get the message about not naming cord-free earbuds with a singular naming scheme, so this new product from Bragi is awkwardly named, “The Headphone.” But branding aside, these earbuds have made quite an improvement over the company’s first-generation product called “The Dash,” which was one of the first to hit the market a year ago. My biggest complaint when testing The Dash was half-baked fitness features, unnecessary built-in storage, and sloppy touch controls that cluttered what could have been an otherwise decent cord-free earbud experience. The Headphone fixes a lot of those issues (mostly by simply removing the problematic features), and what you end up with is a basic but less expensive cord-free earbud that actually works well enough for everyday use. They’re also one of the first cord-free earbuds worth considering before the launch of Apple’s delayed AirPods . ",

      "text": "Reddit \nApple’s vice president of special projects Paul Deneve has disappeared from the Apple executive bios page on Apple’s website. Deneve joined Apple in 2013 after serving as chief executive officer at fashion brand Saint Laurent. His removal from the biography signifies a change in management structure; Deneve now reports to Apple COO Jeff Williams rather than Tim Cook directly. \nSince his arrival in 2013, Deneve’s duties have always had an air of mystery taking on the vague title of ‘Vice President, Special Projects’. Unofficially, he has been seen as one of the people leading Apple’s entrance into the fashion world, headlined by Apple Watch. \nHis contributions to the Watch project are now reaffirmed by his new role working under Jeff Williams, who leads the Apple Watch product division. \nIt’s interesting that Deneve has been moved from reporting directly to the CEO; the company (unsurprisingly) didn’t elaborate on the motivation for the change. He is still listed as a vice president of the company. Apple says that Paul Deneve is still at the company but now reports to Jeff Williams, who runs Watch, rather than directly to Tim Cook. 🤔 https://t.co/TbZTaBBlFZ \n— Tim Bradshaw (@tim) December 3, 2016 \nThe exec bio page currently lists all the chief employee positions, senior vice presidents and a subset of the company’s vice presidents.

      "text": "Do you use third party chargers for your Apple devices? Have you been warned against? Are you still using it? Well, this new piece of information might change your mind. According to a recent study, 99 percent of these third party chargers fail the safety test. The United Kingdom’s consumer protection body, the Chartered Trading Standards Institute (CTSI), commissioned the study, which tested 400 chargers purchased online. The shocking bit of this study is that out of these 400 chargers, mere three passed the safety test. And the most common issue found in the rest of the 397 chargers, was insufficient insulation to protect users from electric shock, a problem that could even cause fires.

Apple announced a repair program saying that “very small number” of iPhone 6s manufactured between the period of September and October 2015 have been affected by the issue. Under the repair program, Apple promises to replace the iPhone 6s battery for free of cost. However, although Apple acknowledged the issue and offered free battery replacement, the real reason that was causing the shutdown was still unknown. Now, in a support document posted on the company’s website, Apple says it has traced the problem. Apple is blaming “a battery component that was exposed to controlled ambient air longer",

      "text": "Apple loses key health technology executive  10am Apple loses key health executive, who was working on Apple Watch products. \nSenior Apple executive Yoky Matsuoka, who joined in May to help oversee its health technology plans, has reportedly left the business. \nBloomberg revealed the news, though neither Matsuoka or Apple have commented on it. \nShe was hired to steer the company’s plans for its HealthKit tracking applications as well as develop the patient medical service CareKit and ResearchKit products for running medical studies on Apple devices. Alongside these responsibilities, Matsuoka was involved in the development of those machine learning algorthms Apple could use for its health products. \nWhile at the company, she reported to Apple’s chief operating officer Jeff Williams, who leads the teams for the Apple Watch, health research and fitness applications. \nHer departure is seen as a blow for the technology business, which has high hopes for the health arena given ongoing investments in machine learning, wearable technology and fitness applications. Since 2014, the business has been filling its health teams with industry experts; Apple’s vice president in charge of medical research and related technologies Michael O’Reilly was previously the chief medical officer at health technology firm Masimo Corp. In 2013, the business hired famed fitness instructor and a consultant at Nike Jay Blahnik as director of its fitness applications. \nSource: Bloomberg  ",

      "text": "print AP \nApple's head of special projects Paul Deneve no longer sits within the company's top leadership team, meaning he has stopped reporting directly into CEO Tim Cook. \nOn Saturday, Financial Times reporter Tim Bradshaw tweeted that Apple confirmed Deneve is still with the company, but now reports into COO Jeff Williams, who also oversees Apple Watch and its health initiatives . Apple did not elaborate on why the change was made. \nDeneve's LinkedIn profile continues to state he is a vice president at Apple. \nDeneve joined Apple in 2013 from Paris-based luxury fashion house Yves Saint Laurent, where he was chief executive. \nQuite what Deneve has been working on since joining the Apple isn't entirely clear. His former executive bio page simply listed him as \"vice president of special projects at Apple, reporting to Tim Cook\" and he hasn't given interviews to the press or appeared on stage at the company's events. \nHowever, he has likely played a helping hand introducing Apple to the fashion world, particularly with the launch of the Apple Watch, which was quickly adopted by models, designers, and fashion magazine editors. And while Deneve keeps a low profile, he was recently photographed at the glitzy San Francisco Mid-Winter Gala. \nApple did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",

      "text": "The Wall Street Journal recently published a story on Apple 's (NASDAQ: AAPL) plans for the upcoming iPhone, which is expected to include a curved organic light-emitting diode (OLED) display. One passage really stood out: \"AppleInc.'s suppliers say they have been asked to increase output of thinner organic light-emitting displays and submit prototype screens with better resolution than ones from South Korea'sSamsungElectronics Co. to differentiate the U.S. company's models.\"\nImage source: Apple.\nThat Apple is asking suppliers to build OLED displays in support of its next-generation iPhone doesn't come as a surprise. What does, at least initially, is that Apple is apparently asking for display samples \"with better resolution\" than the ones that Samsung (NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) currently builds.\nSamsung's current curved OLED displays feature a high-resolution display of 2,560 by 1,440 pixels, or Quad HD. In contrast, Apple's top iPhone, the iPhone 7 Plus, features a display resolution of just 1,920 by 1,080 pixels, or Full HD.\nMore From Fool.com Motley Fool Founders Issue New Stock Buy Alert Forget GE!

      "text": "Credit: Ken Shiriff\nVirtually every counterfeit Apple charger in a recent test posed a safety risk. The problem is not with reputable third-party chargers, but rather those falsely marketed as being produced by Apple themselves.\nThe test was carried out by US safety research firm UL on behalf of a British consumer watchdog . It purchased a total of 400 adapters from eight countries. The safety check involved putting a high voltage through the chargers to see if they were adequately insulated. Only three of the 400 chargers passed the test.\nThe organization said common ways to spot dangerous chargers were that they don’t easily fit into a socket, or that there isn’t a gap of at least 9.5mm (the width of a ballpoint pen) between the edge of the pins and the edge of the charger.\nComputerWorld notes this blog post by Ken Shiriff from 2014 which takes apart both a genuine and fake Apple charger (pictured above) to show how the fake cuts corners on safety.\nOne safety difference is obvious: the Apple charger has much more insulation. The upper (high-voltage) half is wrapped in yellow insulating tape. Some components are encased in shrink tubing, there are plastic insulators between some components, and some wires have extra insulation. The counterfeit charger only has minimal insulation.\nThe build quality of the Apple charger is much higher. In the counterfeit charger, some components are visibly crooked or askew. While this doesn’t affect the circuit electrically, it indicates a lack of care in construction.\nThe post Almost Every Fake Apple Charger Fails Basic Safety Check appeared first on Geeks are Sexy Technology News .\n",

When viewed alongside the year-over-year declines in the three quarters before it, this underwhelming guidance for the important profitability metric could be a cause for concern for some investors.But a closer look at what's going on with Apple's gross profit margin suggests the tech giant is probably doing better than it looks when it comes to profitability.What's affecting Apple's gross profit margin'For its first fiscal quarter of 2017, which coincides with the fourth calendar quarter of 2016, Apple management expects gross margin to be between 38% and 38.5%, down from 40.1%. Even if Apple achieves the midpoint of its guidance range for gross profit margin, this would undoubtedly mark a notable decline. But investors shouldn't fret; there's good reason for the year-over-year pullback.When asked about Apple's lower-than-expected guidance for its first-quarter gross profit margin, Apple CFO Luca Maestri broke down the factors that are driving the difference in the year-ago gross profit margin and Apple's guidance:40 basis points in the year-ago gross profit margin were driven by a $548 million award for a patent infringement.60 to 70 basis points of the difference between the two periods is simply due to currency headwinds.Finally, Maestri said he expected higher cost structures of new products to negatively impact the year-over-year comparison.In other words, after excluding impacts of Apple's patent infringement award in the year-ago quarter and currency headwinds, management only anticipates its first-quarter gross profit margin to decline between about 55 and 115 basis points year over year. Further, much of this expected year-over-year decline in gross profit margin is expected to be a factor of higher cost structures; so, Apple's profitability doesn't seem to be suffering from any negative secular trends -- unless, of course, this higher cost structure for the quarter is the beginning of a sustained period of rising costs.But it's unlikely higher costs are here to stay. Apple has dealt with temporary higher cost structures in the past, when it launched the iPad Mini and at times when it refreshed lots of its product lines around the same time.Zoom outLooking beyond a tough, and arguably unfair, year-over-year comparison, there's probably an even better reason for Apple investors not to be concerned: A zoomed-out view of Apple's quarterly gross profit margin over a period of several years shows that a gross margin of around 38% to 38.5% isn't really so abnormal for the company. Between the fourth quarter of 2013 and the fourth quarter of 2016, Apple's gross margin has bounced around between about 37% and 40.1%.So Apple's expected gross profit margin during the first fiscal quarter of 2017 certainly isn't anything to be excited about. But it's also not worth worrying about.When should investors start worrying about Apple's gross profit margin' If the key metric ever begins to consistently trend downward for more than a few years, this could be more indicative of more secular negative factors, such as declining pricing power, permanently higher cost structures, or unfavorable products mix shifts, that could be here to stay.Of course, it doesn't hurt for investors to look into quarter-to-quarter volatility of Apple's gross profit margin, given how important it is to an investing thesis in Apple stock. As a cash cow, anything that hinders the company's ability to rake in high levels of profits is worth a closer look.In this particular case, the driving force behind Apple's lower gross profit margin doesn't look like it's a problem. Indeed, I'd argue that Apple's gross profit margin today continues to support the company's impressive ability at sustaining pricing power and scale in evolving markets.SEE ALSO:Caterpillar says Wall Street is too bullish on its sales for next yearJoin the conversation about this storyNOW WATCH: The pros and cons of drinking protein shakes after exercising",

      "text": "As the holiday season kicked off this week, some of Apple’s internal plans might have stepped out from the shadows.\nOver the last several days, rumors have been swirling that Apple is hard at work on next year’s innovations. Those reports suggest the company is eyeing major improvements to its iPhone and is drumming up ways to make its mapping service Apple Maps compete more effectively with market leader Google Maps. Meanwhile, Cupertino has remained silent about its future plans, preferring instead to let the rumor mill do its thing while the company works feverishly on whatever is next.\nBut Apple wasn’t silent about all matters this week. The company’s CEO Tim Cook spoke in detail about Apple’s corporate values and touted the iPhone maker’s ongoing support for AIDS research. He also hinted that the long-awaited Bluetooth-based headphones, known as Apple AirPods, might finally find their way to store shelves in the coming weeks.\nThis is Fortune's weekly roundup of the biggest Apple news this week. To see last week's roundup, click here . \nIt’s been an interesting week in Apple news and once again, as we detail the biggest headlines. Read on for more:\nGet Data Sheet , Fortune's technology newsletter \nApple is said to be testing more than 10 prototypes for its next iPhone . At least one of the models will come with organic light-emitting diode display technology and a revamped design . There’s also talk of a model featuring a curved screen like the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge. Apple, of course, isn’t commenting. The next iPhone’s design could be so appealing that it will break sales records , KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo told investors in a research note this week. He estimates that Apple could sell 120 million to 150 million iPhones in the second half of 2017, thanks to the device’s new design. During the second half of 2015, Apple sold 122.8 million iPhones. Apple Maps hasn’t been able to match Google Maps in navigation accuracy or number of features, but Apple could be working on that. The company has reportedly secured approval from the Federal Aviation Administration to fly drones over roads around the world to capture photos, videos, and other traffic data that would be bundled with Apple Maps. The company is also reportedly working on a feature that would let users navigate the inside of a building. If all goes well, at least some of the new Apple Maps features could be released next year . The number of iPhone 7 activations between Black Friday and Cyber Monday was up 13% compared to an average of the previous four weekends, according to mobile app analytics company Localytics. But that figure was down from last year’s iPhone 6s activation increase of 36% during the 2015 shopping weekend. Apple CEO Tim Cook said in an interview with USA Today this week that his company tries “thoughtfully” to “leave the world better than we found it.” The comments came after Apple announced it had expanded its support for the (RED) campaign , focusing on helping people with AIDS and hopefully eradicating the disease by 2030. Apple is offering a wide array of programs, all aimed at potentially donating millions of dollars in support of the fight against AIDS. It’s a bad idea to buy Apple product chargers and adapters from companies you don’t know. A UK watchdog named Trading Standards tested 400 counterfeit Apple chargers recently and found that just three of them were protected against fire and explosion risk . The counterfeits are being sold in Australia, China, and the U.S. and pose a serious safety risk. The organization’s takeaway: Spend extra cash on genuine products.

      "text": "By Tim Higgins and Tripp Mickle\nApple Inc. took its biggest step toward acknowledging it is working on autonomous vehicles, writing a letter to U.S. regulators offering feedback on proposed guidelines for the emerging technology.\nThe letter from Steve Kenner, Apple's director of product integrity, to the head of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration offered no details on the project, but said Apple \"is investing heavily in the study of machine learning and automation, and is excited about the potential of automated systems in many areas, including transportation.\"\nCupertino, Calif.-based Apple has been working on its car effort, code-named Project Titan, for several years, but has never publicly acknowledged it. The secrecy has made the exact status of Project Titan hard to pinpoint. The Wall Street Journal reported in September that Apple had restructured some elements of the project, which has had several hundred employees working on it, after placing it under veteran Apple executive Bob Mansfield in July.\nThe five-page letter, dated Nov. 22, appears on the NHTSA website. It isn't clear when it was posted.\n\"We've provided comments to NHTSA because Apple is investing heavily in machine learning and autonomous systems,\" Apple spokesman Tom Neumayr said Friday. \"There are many potential applications for these technologies, including the future of transportation, so we want to work with NHTSA to help define the best practices for the industry.\"\nThe letter comes as the Obama administration rushes to put guidelines in place to help guide self-driving development. Alphabet Inc.'s self-driving project had already collected more than 2 million miles of public-roadway testing and General Motors Co. this year competed a $1 billion deal to acquire Cruise Automation to jump start its autonomous vehicle program.\n 03, 2016 02:29 ET (07:29 ",

      "text": "By Tim Higgins and Tripp Mickle\nApple Inc. took its biggest step toward acknowledging it is working on autonomous vehicles, writing a letter to U.S. regulators offering feedback on proposed guidelines for the emerging technology.\nThe letter from Steve Kenner, Apple's director of product integrity, to the head of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration offered no details on the project, but said Apple \"is investing heavily in the study of machine learning and automation, and is excited about the potential of automated systems in many areas, including transportation.\"\nCupertino, Calif.-based Apple has been working on its car effort, code-named Project Titan, for several years, but has never publicly acknowledged it. The secrecy has made the exact status of Project Titan hard to pinpoint. The Wall Street Journal reported in September that Apple had restructured some elements of the project, which has had several hundred employees working on it, after placing it under veteran Apple executive Bob Mansfield in July.\nApple has looked at doing an entire car, but more recently its focus has narrowed to developing an autonomous-driving system and software. Focusing on software is more in line with the company's historic expertise and fits its efforts to improve machine-learning capabilities that allow computers to adjust their behavior without being explicitly programmed.\nApple's five-page letter, dated Nov. 22, appears on the NHTSA website. It isn't clear when it was posted.\n\"We've provided comments to NHTSA because Apple is investing heavily in machine learning and autonomous systems,\" Apple spokesman Tom Neumayr said Friday. \"There are many potential applications for these technologies, including the future of transportation, so we want to work with NHTSA to help define the best practices for the industry.\"\nThe letter comes as the Obama administration rushes to put guidelines in place to help guide self-driving development. Alphabet Inc.'s self-driving project had already collected more than 2 million miles of public-roadway testing and General Motors Co. this year competed a $1 billion deal to acquire Cruise Automation to jump start its autonomous vehicle program.\nIn the letter to NHTSA, Apple called on the regulator to work quickly to adopt new safety rules and process requests for exemptions from existing traffic rules. Mr. Kenner said by \"improving regulatory flexibility,\" the agency would foster more innovation and encourage \"the development of life-saving technology.\"\nNot surprisingly, the letter showed Apple's autonomous-vehicle ambitions go beyond the U.S. Mr. Kenner encouraged the agency to work with international groups such as the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe and others to develop a \"harmonized approach to automated vehicles.\"\nWrite to Tim Higgins at Tim.Higgins@WSJ.com and Tripp Mickle at Tripp.Mickle@wsj.com\n 03, 2016 03:05 ET (08:05 ",

After reviewing the images, videos, and stories that got us commenting and Liking in 2016, Instagram has rounded up the 10 emoji that reigned supreme. While many of the oft-used emoji have something in common with the most popular hashtag of the year (#love), there are a few surprising winners among the bunch. The party hat? Really? Given that 2016 was the year of the U.S. election, I would have thought the American flag emoji would have flown high. Or at least the flexed arm that seemed to have strengthened almost every post I saw all year. Oh well, maybe next year those will rise to the top. Click through to count down the most popular emoji to No. 1, and take a look at some of our favourite Insta posts that used them in the captions. \n10. Blue love \nThis Simone Biles-Zac Efron moment makes us feel dreamy, too. Photo: Apple.",

      "text": "Drew Angerer/Getty Images \nAn Apple official wrote that Apple is \"invested\" and \"excited\" about autonomous driving software in a recent letter to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.\nIt's the strongest official public sign that Apple is currently working on self-driving car software, an open secret that Apple has never publicly confirmed. \nIn the Nov. 22 letter , Apple Director of Product Steve Kenner wrote that Apple \"is investing heavily in the study of machine learning and automation, and is excited about the potential of automated systems in many areas, including transportation.\"\nThe rest of the comment in response to recently proposed guidelines  by the NHTSA is primarily concerned about the regulation and paperwork surrounding vehicles in the development phase before they are publicly released.\nIn one example, Apple expects that a company testing these kind of autonomous driving features could rapidly iterate \"multiple times within a four-month period.\" \n\"In addition, Apple expects companies may add functionality or change a particular design or function multiple times within a four-month period. This rapid iteration should not require multiple Safety Assessments, which would be a significant administrative burden for both NHTSA and companies,\" Apple wrote.\nThe letter offers several insights into Apple's overall automotive strategy. \n'Internal development vehicles ... never to be used by the general public' Drew Angerer/Getty Images Another priority for Apple is reducing the amount of paperwork it needs to publicly submit to run internal vehicles for development. \n\"To Apple’s knowledge, the [FMVSS] exemption process was intended for, and remains focused on, the sale of new motor vehicles to the public—not on the safe and controlled testing of development vehicles on public roads. However, the Policy suggests that companies must seek an exemption for public road testing of internal development vehicles not fully compliant with FMVSS .\" \nApple's preferred solution? It would like to perform tests without seeking an official exemption, which would slow down the process and possibly reveal secret details of Apple's progress. \n\"While NHTSA does not have the ability to amend the FAST Act, it can amend the Policy to state that exemptions are not required for the controlled testing of internal development vehicles on public roads, provided they will never be used by the general public,\" Apple writes. \nBecause Apple is so secretive, you're unlikely to ever see an Apple autonomous test vehicle on public roads. More likely, Apple is testing them on private courses such as Gomentum Station, in California . \nThe story so far  Drew Angerer/Getty Images Apple's work on an electric car is not a secret. However, Apple has never officially confirmed the existence of a project. Tesla CEO Elon Musk once called it an \" open secret .\"\n\"It's going to be Christmas Eve for a while,\" Apple CEO Tim Cook said  about the project.\nApple essentially has a separate organization of about 1000 people called \"Project Titan\" working on automotive projects in industrial facilities in Sunnyvale, California and other satellite facilities.\nWhen the project started in 2014, Apple wanted to build a complete electric car as a competitior to Tesla and other automotive companies by 2020. The automotive driving component was planned as a feature for an update.\nThe project hit some snags and there was political infighting in the division. Earlier this year Apple brought on Bob Mansfeld — a long-time respected Apple engineer — who decided to cut back and set new goals. \nNow, Apple is primarily working on autonomous driving software, and taking some interesting approaches, like using virtual reality to test and collect data. \nAt the end of 2017, the company will look at the progress made so far, and figure out what to do with the project, according to reporting from Bloomberg . Venturebeat first reported the NHTSA comment . \nRead the entire comment: RAW Embed \n \nNOW WATCH: What those tiny rivets on your jeans are for \n",

      "text": "By Tim Higgins and Tripp Mickle\nApple Inc. took its biggest step toward acknowledging it is working on autonomous vehicles, writing a letter to U.S. regulators offering feedback on proposed guidelines for the emerging technology.\nThe letter from Steve Kenner, Apple's director of product integrity, to the head of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration offered no details on the project, but said Apple \"is investing heavily in the study of machine learning and automation, and is excited about the potential of automated systems in many areas, including transportation.\"\nCupertino, Calif.-based Apple has been working on its car effort, code-named Project Titan, for several years, but has never publicly acknowledged it. The secrecy has made the exact status of Project Titan hard to pinpoint. The Wall Street Journal reported in September that Apple had restructured some elements of the project, which has had several hundred employees working on it, after placing it under veteran Apple executive Bob Mansfield in July.\nApple has looked at doing an entire car, but more recently its focus has narrowed to developing an autonomous-driving system and software. Focusing on software is more in line with the company's historic expertise and fits its efforts to improve machine-learning capabilities that allow computers to adjust their behavior without being explicitly programmed.\nApple's five-page letter, dated Nov. 22, appears on the NHTSA website. It isn't clear when it was posted.\n\"We've provided comments to NHTSA because Apple is investing heavily in machine learning and autonomous systems,\" Apple spokesman Tom Neumayr said Friday. \"There are many potential applications for these technologies, including the future of transportation, so we want to work with NHTSA to help define the best practices for the industry.\"\nThe letter comes as the Obama administration rushes to put guidelines in place to help guide self-driving development. Alphabet Inc.'s self-driving project had already collected more than 2 million miles of public-roadway testing and General Motors Co. this year competed a $1 billion deal to acquire Cruise Automation to jump start its autonomous vehicle program.\nIn the letter to NHTSA, Apple called on the regulator to work quickly to adopt new safety rules and process requests for exemptions from existing traffic rules. Mr. Kenner said by \"improving regulatory flexibility,\" the agency would foster more innovation and encourage \"the development of life-saving technology.\"\nNot surprisingly, the letter showed Apple's autonomous-vehicle ambitions go beyond the U.S. Mr. Kenner encouraged the agency to work with international groups such as the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe and others to develop a \"harmonized approach to automated vehicles.\"\nWrite to Tim Higgins at Tim.Higgins@WSJ.com and Tripp Mickle at Tripp.Mickle@wsj.com\nDecember 03, 2016 03:05 ET (08:05 ",

      "text": "\nMac App Store has all the Touch Bar apps Apple approved. So what about the Touch Bar apps Apple didn't approve. Well...\nApple's Interface Guideline for the Touch Bar on the MacBook Pro says that it is intended to be used as an input device, not a secondary display.\nThe Touch Bar shouldn't display alerts, messages, scrolling content, static content, or anything else that commands the user's attention or distracts from their work on the main screen.\nThat hasn't stopped some developers from creating uniquely useless apps that are fun, if not functional. You won't find these apps in the App Store because Apple wouldn't approve them, but you can download and install them directly and make your Touch Bar sparkle.\nNote : Apps on this list might not be from identified developers . When downloading apps outside of the Apple ecosystem, they have not been security checked by app review staff. That means they could have bugs, malware, spyware, or other problems associated with them. Please take this into consideration before downloading apps from unidentified developers and always backup your Mac .\nRead: All the apps that work with the Touch Bar Read: The best Touch bar Apps for MacBook Pro Here are the best Touch Bar apps you won't find in the App Store!\nTouch Bar Nyancat Knight TouchBar 2000 Touchbar Santa TouchBarBar Touch Bar Dino Touch Bar Space Flight SL on Touch Bar TouchSwitcher for Touch Bar \nTouch Bar Nyancat \nIt's Nyan Cat in your Touch Bar – complete with music!

      "text": "(Corrects to clarify that Shenmao Technology did not say it bought tin from the Wa mine)\n* United Wa State Army blacklisted by U.S. over drug trafficking\n* Mine run by armed group in \"Wa State\" is a major producer of tin\n* Top smelter Yunnan Tin indirectly buys big quantities of Wa tin\n* Many international companies list Yunnan Tin as a supplier\n* Sourcing tin from mine puts firms at risk of sanctions breach\nBy Yimou Lee and Joel Schectman\nYANGON/WASHINGTON, Nov 29 From a remote corner of northeastern Myanmar, an insurgent army sells tin ore to suppliers of some of the world's largest consumer companies.\nMore than 500 companies, including leading brands such as smartphone maker Apple, coffee giant Starbucks and luxury jeweller Tiffany & Co, list among their suppliers Chinese-controlled firms that indirectly buy ore from the Man Maw mine near Myanmar's border with China, a Reuters examination of the supply chain found.\nThe mine is controlled by the United Wa State Army (UWSA), which the United States placed under sanctions for alleged narcotics trafficking in 2003. The seven companies extracting tin from the mine are all owned or controlled by Wa military and government leaders, Wa officials and people with close ties to UWSA leadership told Reuters.\nThis potentially puts companies, which also include industrial conglomerate General Electric, at risk of violating sanctions that forbid \"direct or indirect\" dealings with blacklisted groups, according to a former and a serving U.S. official and lawyers with expertise in sanctions enforcement.\nSeveral sanctions experts said the U.S. government was unlikely to fine companies who unwittingly used the Myanmar tin. Still, it may force them to shift to new suppliers, they said.\nA Treasury Department spokeswoman said U.S. sanctions \"generally prohibit U.S. companies from engaging in any direct or indirect transactions or dealings with individuals or entities\" on a blacklist, but declined further comment on specific circumstances.\nThe situation illustrates the difficulties facing multinationals in monitoring supply chains that have grown increasingly complex.\nFollowing a 2012 U.S. regulation, companies have spent billions of dollars scrutinizing whether certain minerals used in their products come from mines controlled by armed groups in Central Africa.\nBut the regulations do not require them to assess the origins of minerals from other conflict zones.\nApple, Tiffany and GE, and other companies contacted by Reuters, said that to fulfil those regulations they looked to an audit programme designed by the industry group Conflict Free Sourcing Initiative (CFSI).\nA CFSI programme director said the group was \"aware of tin exports from Myanmar to other countries and of security and human rights issues in Myanmar\". The group said it was updating its audit requirements to include \"a broader definition of conflict-affected and high-risk areas\".\nTin supply chain expert at monitoring group Global Witness, Sophia Pickles, said companies must not wholly outsource due diligence responsibility to a scheme that has exclusively focused on central Africa.\n\"Companies, not schemes, bear the primary responsibility for ensuring that supply chains are responsible,\" she said.\nCIVIL WAR\nMost of the tin mined globally is used as solder in electronics, for making batteries and plating.\nThe Man Maw mine roiled the global tin market when huge quantities of high grade ore were discovered around 2013. Annual production is now estimated at about 33,000 tons of tin concentrate, more than a 10th of global output of the metal.\nThe mine is controlled by the UWSA, the strongest of the myriad armed groups that have kept Myanmar in a state of near-perpetual civil war for decades. Reuters visited the remote mine last month, the first international media organisation to do so.\nInterviews with officials running the mine, UWSA leaders and executives at Asian tin suppliers, together with an examination of public disclosures of suppliers made by companies in regulatory filings, indicate Wa tin likely ends up in an array of products made by U.S. and other international companies.\nTin from Man Maw provides revenue critical to the survival of the self-proclaimed Wa State and its rulers, who have refused to disarm or participate in Myanmar's peace process.\n\"There are dozens of trucks carrying tin ore to China every morning,\" the head of the Wa territory foreign affairs office, Zhao Guo An, told Reuters. \"Tin mining is the pillar of our economy. It's the biggest source of income.\"\nWhile Washington has lifted most sanctions on Myanmar, some have been kept in place, including those aimed at the UWSA. The group and several of its leaders are blacklisted under the Kingpin Act over accusations of trafficking in heroin and methamphetamine. UWSA leaders deny involvement in narcotics, saying the accusations are a smear by political opponents.\nPeter Kucik, a former senior sanctions advisor at the U.S. Treasury Department, said the findings highlighted the need for thorough due diligence.\n\"The facts suggest potential sanctions risk for the parties involved,\" Kucik said.\nThe world's No. 1 tin producer, Yunnan Tin Co Ltd , told Reuters that some tin it bought was from the Wa mine, the source of almost all Myanmar's tin exports.\nMandy Gan, a tin analyst from China's leading mineral research company, Asian Metal, and another tin expert, both of whom visited the UWSA mine this year, said many other Chinese smelting firms supplying global consumer goods makers also bought tin from the Man Maw mine.\nSanctions experts said even the indirect use of the tin might be considered a violation of U.S. sanctions law, which does not require authorities to prove intent. A U.S. government official involved in Myanmar policy consulted on Reuters' findings said the government was likely to investigate any ties to the UWSA.\nStill, Washington-based sanctions attorney Erich Ferrari said it was unlikely the Treasury Department would initiate an enforcement action against companies for an issue so deep in the supply chain. Once the ties were publicized, however, authorities could impose penalties if the companies did not wind down the transactions and find new suppliers, he said.\nSUPPLY CHAIN\nThe chain connecting some of the world's best known brands with a mine in one the most inaccessible corners of Southeast Asia has many links.\nOne key intermediary is state-owned Yunnan Cultural Industry International (YCII), based in Yunnan, southwestern China, which said in a statement on its website that it enjoys \"a long-term, stable strategic partnership\" with the UWSA statelet.\nYCII declined several interview requests.\nYCII is, in turn, a major supplier of tin to the world's top producer, Yunnan Tin, also based in Yunnan.\nYunnan Tin supplies many companies, including big contract manufacturers such as Foxconn Technology Co. It also supplies major solder makers such as Shenmao Technology , whose clients include Pegatron Corp, another large contract manufacturer. Both Pegatron and Foxconn count Apple among their clients.\nTim Lin, an executive overseeing sourcing at Taiwan-based Shenmao, said about a quarter of its supply of the metal came from Yunnan Tin. While it was possible Yunnan Tin bought tin from Myanmar, sourcing from the country was not regarded as problematic by the audit programme Shenmao follows, he said.\n\"Myanmar is not considered a conflict-affected area by CFSI...As long as smelters present a certified sourcing document, that's acceptable for us,\" said Lin.\nIn the last two years, Yunnan Tin has also shipped more than 12,000 tons of metal to the United States, according to shipment data from U.S.-based trade tracking company Panjiva.\nMore than 500 publicly traded companies in the United States say their suppliers use tin from Yunnan Tin or Yuntinic Resources, its San Mateo, California-based division, according to a review of the supply chain disclosures consumer companies make to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.\nTwo members of Yunnan Tin's board, vice chairwoman Yang Yimin and secretary and vice general manager Pan Wenhao, confirmed in interviews that a \"portion\" of the company's tin came from the UWSA-operated mine.\n\"We certainly buy tin indirectly from Myanmar,\" Pan told Reuters. \"We don't specifically pay attention to where they source their materials from.\"\nYunnan Tin mixes the Wa tin with metal from mines in central and southwestern China, said Pan, before processing it into products such as tin paste.\nThat means it is impossible to say for certain which shipments from the company contain Wa tin, but Pan estimated Yunnan Tin's purchases from the mine account for about a third of its total annual tin consumption, or at least 16,500 tons.\nApple said in a statement it worked with suppliers to help them meet stringent standards, \"and those who are ultimately unable or unwilling to comply are removed from our supply chain\".\n\"While we have no evidence of illegal tin from Myanmar in our products, we'll continue to investigate, address any issues we find and do all we can to raise standards and protect human rights,\" it said.\nFoxconn said it \"enforced stringent supplier management requirements in accordance with international and local conflict minerals legislation and has proactively communicated these requirements to our suppliers\".\nIt added that less than 1 percent of its tin was procured from Yunnan Tin, all of which was used in products for a \"single, non-U.S.-based customer\".\nPegatron Corp said it carried out \"annual due diligence on suppliers and encourage them to source from validated conflict-free supply chains\".\n\"Pegatron will continue working with customers and international organizations to investigate and source minerals responsibly,\" the company added.\nFROM JEWELLERY TO APPLIANCES\nCompanies that sell consumer products in the United States are required by the Dodd-Frank Act to publish their suppliers of tin and other minerals.\nAmong the companies listing Yunnan Tin, Tiffany said one of its suppliers had indirectly sourced a \"very small amount of tin\" from the Chinese smelter for use in silver solder for jewellery and hollowware.\nThe company added that, as Yunnan Tin was certified as conflict-free by the CFSI, \"use of this smelter by our vendors is consistent with our Conflict Minerals Policy\".\nStarbucks said small amounts of Yunnan Tin metal, sourced from second or third party suppliers, went into the ovens in its coffee shops.\nThe company had received no information indicating it was using minerals from Myanmar, a spokeswoman said, but was pushing suppliers for more detailed sourcing disclosures.\nA GE spokesman said the company strived to use ethical sourcing in its mineral supply chain, adding it had \"noted the concerns raised by Reuters and will address them through our internal process and with our external partners\".\nA spokeswoman from discount retailer Target said in a statement it was \"committed to responsible business conduct\".\n\"We take these allegations very seriously, and we are looking into this,\" the statement said.\n(Additional reporting by Antoni Slodkowski in Yangon, JR Wu in Taipei, Jussi Rosendahl in Helsinki and Helena Soderpalm in Stockholm, Paul Carsten in Beijing and Sijia Jiang in Hong Kong; Editing by Alex Richardson)",

      "title": "MacBook Air 2017 release date, rumors: Apple to discontinue lineup due to MacBook Pro 2016?",
      "text": "  \n(Apple) Rumor has it that Apple will be discontinuing the MacBook Air lineup. \nWith a new MacBook Pro out, fans are wondering whether Apple's other laptop lineup will be getting a major upgrade in the near future. However, rumor has it that the Cupertino-based tech giant might be doing away with the MacBook Air for good. \nSpeculations were rife that Apple would be unveiling the MacBook Pro 2016 and the MacBook Air 2016 at the company's October event . However, only the MacBook Pro was brought out, leaving its lighter counterpart behind. The new MacBook Pro was reportedly compared to the current-gen MacBook Air, which led to somewhat shocking revelations. \nAccording to reports , the MacBook Pro 2016 was overall smaller and thinner in size than the MacBook Air. Being bulkier and heavier than the MacBook Air was always one of the most distinguishable factors of the MacBook Pro. But with recent developments, it seems that this is no longer the case. \nThis has led to rumors that Apple might be discontinuing the MacBook Air lineup altogether. The MacBook Pro 2016 is more advanced and more portable, after all. Advertisement \nBut there are also those who believe that a new MacBook Air will still see the light of day. And while it may not land within 2016, Apple could still launch it in the new year. It can be recalled that the most recent change the MacBook Air got this year was an optional RAM upgrade, which was unsatisfactory to say the least. \nHowever, if a MacBook Air 2017 is really a possibility, then it is believed that Apple's virtual assistant, Siri, will come with the laptop. Apart from that, the new device is said to have a Retina display, Touch ID with Force Touch, and an E-Ink keyboard. Under the hood, the laptop may sport Intel's new Kaby Lake processor, ARM chips, and a more powerful battery. It has also been said that the MacBook Air 2017, if released, could be the company's cheapest offering. \nSince nothing can be known for sure at this point, readers are advised to take this news with a grain of salt.

      "text": "\n© 2016 Time Inc. All rights reserved. Apple’s Secret Weapon Isn’t the iPhone It’s Working On \nAs the holiday season kicked off this week, some of Apple’s internal plans might have stepped out from the shadows. \nOver the last several days, rumors have been swirling that Apple is hard at work on next year’s innovations. Those reports suggest the company is eyeing major improvements to its iPhone and is drumming up ways to make its mapping service Apple Maps compete more effectively with market leader Google Maps. Meanwhile, Cupertino has remained silent about its future plans, preferring instead to let the rumor mill do its thing while the company works feverishly on whatever is next. \nBut Apple wasn’t silent about all matters this week. The company’s CEO Tim Cook spoke in detail about Apple’s corporate values and touted the iPhone maker’s ongoing support for AIDS research. He also hinted that the long-awaited Bluetooth-based headphones, known as Apple AirPods, might finally find their way to store shelves in the coming weeks. This is Fortune’s weekly roundup of the biggest Apple news this week. To see last week’s roundup, click here . \nIt’s been an interesting week in Apple news and once again, as we detail the biggest headlines. Read on for more: Get Data Sheet , Fortune’s technology newsletter Apple is said to be testing more than 10 prototypes for its next iPhone . At least one of the models will come with organic light-emitting diode display technology and a revamped design . There’s also talk of a model featuring a curved screen like the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge. Apple, of course, isn’t commenting. The next iPhone’s design could be so appealing that it will break sales records , KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo told investors in a research note this week. He estimates that Apple could sell 120 million to 150 million iPhones in the second half of 2017, thanks to the device’s new design. During the second half of 2015, Apple sold 122.8 million iPhones. Apple Maps hasn’t been able to match Google Maps in navigation accuracy or number of features, but Apple could be working on that. The company has reportedly secured approval from the Federal Aviation Administration to fly drones over roads around the world to capture photos, videos, and other traffic data that would be bundled with Apple Maps. The company is also reportedly working on a feature that would let users navigate the inside of a building. If all goes well, at least some of the new Apple Maps features could be released next year . The number of iPhone 7 activations between Black Friday and Cyber Monday was up 13% compared to an average of the previous four weekends, according to mobile app analytics company Localytics. But that figure was down from last year’s iPhone 6s activation increase of 36% during the 2015 shopping weekend. Apple CEO Tim Cook said in an interview with USA Today this week that his company tries “thoughtfully” to “leave the world better than we found it.” The comments came after Apple announced it had expanded its support for the (RED) campaign , focusing on helping people with AIDS and hopefully eradicating the disease by 2030. Apple is offering a wide array of programs, all aimed at potentially donating millions of dollars in support of the fight against AIDS. It’s a bad idea to buy Apple product chargers and adapters from companies you don’t know. A UK watchdog named Trading Standards tested 400 counterfeit Apple chargers recently and found that just three of them were protected against fire and explosion risk . The counterfeits are being sold in Australia, China, and the U.S. and pose a serious safety risk. The organization’s takeaway: Spend extra cash on genuine products.

It’s a must-see. Check it out here . ",

App writers can download and test the new beta version.\nThe previous beta versions of iOS 10.2 includes Unicode 9 with a fresh batch of emoji, as well as new wallpapers, iMessage screen effects, camera settings, video widgets, and emergency contact alerts.

He changed technology and how the world communicates. Now, five years after he died, Apple founder Steve Jobs may be remembered in another way -- on a Paris street. \"Rue Steve Jobs\" is among names shortlisted for one of the new roads in the French capital's southeastern 13th arrondissement that will lead to a new incubator for hi-tech start-ups.\nThe tech titan's name was put forward by the district's socialist mayor who credited Jobs -- whose company altered the face of computing, revolutionised music with the iPod and launched the iPhone and iPad -- with \"changing our daily lives\".\nBut the mayor, Jerome Coumet, has faced a backlash from elected Communists, who in a statement said \"the reality of the legacy\" of Jobs was \"insufficient wages\" and \"forced overtime\" for Apple subcontractors.\nThey also hit out at what they alleged was the technology giant's \"use of illegal tax arrangements\" across the globe. Coumet said he was not seeking controversy. \"I wanted a name that speaks to as many people as possible,\" he said.\nAmong other suggestions was Alan Turing, in memory of the British mathematician and computer scientist whose wartime work allowed the allies to crack German codes and defeat Nazism.\nGrace Murray Hopper, an American computer scientist and former Navy rear admiral who pioneered coding, is also proposed. Currently dubbed Station F, names for the start-up hub are to be discussed by Paris council officials in December, before it opens in March next year.",

      "text": "Technology News |  27pm EST Apple shows ambition to get into self-driving car race An Apple logo hangs above the entrance to the Apple store on 5th Avenue in the Manhattan borough of New York City, July 21, 2015. REUTERS/Mike Segar/File Photo By David Shepardson | WASHINGTON \nWASHINGTON Apple Inc is wading in to the debate over regulation of self-driving cars, declaring it is excited about the potential for automated transportation and calling on U.S. regulators not to restrict testing of such vehicles. \nA five-page letter from Steve Kenner, Apple's director of product integrity, to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is the company's most comprehensive statement yet about its interest in self-driving vehicle technology. The Nov. 22 letter followed more than a year of industry speculation about the computer and iPhone maker's plans for expanding into transportation. \n\"The company is investing heavily in the study of machine learning and automation, and is excited about the potential of automated systems in many areas, including transportation,\" Kenner wrote. \n\"Executed properly under NHTSA's guidance, automated vehicles have the potential to greatly enhance the human experience — to prevent millions of car crashes and thousands of fatalities each year and to give mobility to those without.\" \nApple urged regulators not to impose too many restrictions on testing of self-driving cars, saying \"established manufacturers and new entrants should be treated equally.\" \nSince software would decide what actions to take in potentially dangerous situations, Apple said certain areas need special attention. These include the \"implications of algorithmic decisions\" for the safety, mobility and legality of automated vehicles and their occupants, ensuring privacy and security in design, and the impact of the cars on employment and public spaces. \nSome analysts forecast millions of jobs will be lost once self-driving cars largely replace truck, taxi and Uber drivers, and eliminate the need for most vehicle repairs, insurance adjusters and other functions. \nIn September, the Obama administration proposed guidelines for the development of self-driving cars in a 15-point \"safety assessment,\" calling on automakers to voluntarily submit details of their systems to regulators. \nApple executives have been coy about their interest in cars. Chief Executive Tim Cook has suggested that Apple wants to move beyond integration of Apple smartphones into vehicle infotainment systems. \nBut Apple has never confirmed reports last year that it was hiring automotive industry engineers and designers to develop a driverless electric car, or that those efforts have been sharply scaled back this year. \nOther companies pursuing self-driving cars include Alphabet Inc's Google unit, Ford Motor Co, Volkswagen AG, Daimler AG, Tesla Motors Inc and General Motors Co. \nApple has reportedly held talks about investing in British automaker McLaren Technology Group, but McLaren downplayed speculation that Apple had proposed an investment. \nApple joins a range of automakers and tech companies that have raised concerns about the proposed National Highway Traffic Safety Administration policy on self-driving cars, and plans by California state regulators to make complying with the safety assessment mandatory. \nAn auto trade group in November urged the incoming Trump administration to conduct a \"comprehensive regulatory review\" of all regulations and actions since Sept. 1, including the Obama administration's guidance on self-driving vehicles. \n(Reporting by David Shepardson; Editing by Richard Chang) Next In Technology News",

      "text": "Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends \nOver the course of several months, we’ve been in danger of suffering from whiplash as a result of all the swiveling back and forth to keep up with the countless rumors swirling around Apple’s so-called “ Project Titan ,” its mysterious (alleged) car project. But now, the tech giant has finally seemed to publicly acknowledge that there is indeed an Apple car in the works. In early December, a letter from Steve Kenner , Apple’s director of product integrity, to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration was discovered, in which Apple offered “comments on the proposed Federal Automated Vehicles Policy.” \nNow why else would the Cupertino company do that unless it had some serious skin in the game? \nIn the letter, which is dated November 22, 2016, Apple notes that it “uses machine learning to make its products and services smarter, more intuitive, and more personal,” and further, that it is “investing heavily in the study of machine learning and automation, and is excited about the potential of automated systems in many areas, including transportation.” \nMore : Study shows that most knockoff Apple chargers are unsafe \nKenner further noted that when executed properly, “automated vehicles have the potential to greatly enhance the human experience — to prevent millions of car crashes and thousands of fatalities each year and to give mobility to those without. It is vital that those developing and deploying automated vehicles follow rigorous safety principles in design and production.” \nUltimately, Apple said, “In order to best protect the traveling public and keep up with the pace of innovation, NHTSA should expedite requests for exemption and interpretation and petitions for rulemaking. NHTSA and Congress should also continue to explore new tools and authorities like those outlined in Section IV of the Policy — including expanded exemption authority — with the goal of fostering innovation, improving regulatory flexibility, and encouraging the development of life-saving technology.” \nAll this seems to suggest in no uncertain terms that Apple knows what it wants, and it’s a future in cars. \n“We’ve provided comments to NHTSA because Apple is investing heavily in machine learning and autonomous systems,” Apple spokesman Tom Neumayr said Friday. “There are many potential applications for these technologies, including the future of transportation, so we want to work with NHTSA to help define the best practices for the industry.” Also watch: ",

Apple may be dropping support for your machine. \nMacRumors got its hands on an internal memo stating that Cupertino will add four Macs to its list of vintage and obsolete products. That includes the 15- and 17-inch MacBook Pro from early 2011 as well as the Mac mini from early 2009 and the 13-inch MacBook from mid-2009. \nStarting next year, Apple and its Authorized Service Providers will no longer service your hardware or provide new parts if something on your machine breaks. If you purchased your device in Turkey or California, however, you're in luck: Apple will continue to make repairs on the aforementioned models until Dec. 31, 2018 thanks to local laws. \nFor everyone else, it might be a good idea to have your device checked out and backed up before the end of the year. Related New Footage Provides Another Look at Apple's Spaceship Campus \nAs MacRumors points out, Apple deems a product \"vintage\" if it was manufactured between five and seven years ago. It's \"obsolete\" if it's been discontinued for more than seven years. \n\"Apple and Authorized Service Providers make no distinction between obsolete and vintage products outside of Turkey and California,\" the report notes. \nMeanwhile, if you have problems with your iPhone or MacBook, you don't necessarily have to take a trip to the local Genius Bar. Apple earlier this year launched the @AppleSupport Twitter account to help people with their tech support issues. ",

      "text": "Share Tweet \nBy David Shepardson \nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - Apple Inc is wading in to the debate over regulation of self-driving cars, declaring it is excited about the potential for automated transportation and calling on U.S. regulators not to restrict testing of such vehicles. \nA five-page letter from Steve Kenner, Apple's director of product integrity, to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is the company's most comprehensive statement yet about its interest in self-driving vehicle technology. The Nov. 22 letter followed more than a year of industry speculation about the computer and iPhone maker's plans for expanding into transportation. \n\"The company is investing heavily in the study of machine learning and automation, and is excited about the potential of automated systems in many areas, including transportation,\" Kenner wrote. \n\"Executed properly under NHTSA's guidance, automated vehicles have the potential to greatly enhance the human experience — to prevent millions of car crashes and thousands of fatalities each year and to give mobility to those without.\" \nApple urged regulators not to impose too many restrictions on testing of self-driving cars, saying \"established manufacturers and new entrants should be treated equally.\" \nSince software would decide what actions to take in potentially dangerous situations, Apple said certain areas need special attention. These include the \"implications of algorithmic decisions\" for the safety, mobility and legality of automated vehicles and their occupants, ensuring privacy and security in design, and the impact of the cars on employment and public spaces. \nSome analysts forecast millions of jobs will be lost once self-driving cars largely replace truck, taxi and Uber drivers, and eliminate the need for most vehicle repairs, insurance adjusters and other functions. \nIn September, the Obama administration proposed guidelines for the development of self-driving cars in a 15-point \"safety assessment,\" calling on automakers to voluntarily submit details of their systems to regulators. \nApple executives have been coy about their interest in cars. Chief Executive Tim Cook has suggested that Apple wants to move beyond integration of Apple smartphones into vehicle infotainment systems. \nBut Apple has never confirmed reports last year that it was hiring automotive industry engineers and designers to develop a driverless electric car, or that those efforts have been sharply scaled back this year. \nOther companies pursuing self-driving cars include Alphabet Inc's Google unit, Ford Motor Co, Volkswagen AG, Daimler AG, Tesla Motors Inc and General Motors Co. \nApple has reportedly held talks about investing in British automaker McLaren Technology Group, but McLaren downplayed speculation that Apple had proposed an investment. \nApple joins a range of automakers and tech companies that have raised concerns about the proposed National Highway Traffic Safety Administration policy on self-driving cars, and plans by California state regulators to make complying with the safety assessment mandatory. \nAn auto trade group in November urged the incoming Trump administration to conduct a \"comprehensive regulatory review\" of all regulations and actions since Sept. 1, including the Obama administration's guidance on self-driving vehicles. \n(Reporting by David Shepardson; Editing by Richard Chang)",

      "text": "WASHINGTON, Dec 3 (Reuters) - Apple Inc is wading in to the debate over regulation of self-driving cars, declaring it is excited about the potential for automated transportation and calling on U.S. regulators not to restrict testing of such vehicles.\nA five-page letter from Steve Kenner, Apple's director of product integrity, to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is the company's most comprehensive statement yet about its interest in self-driving vehicle technology. The Nov. 22 letter followed more than a year of industry speculation about the computer and iPhone maker's plans for expanding into transportation.\n\"The company is investing heavily in the study of machine learning and automation, and is excited about the potential of automated systems in many areas, including transportation,\" Kenner wrote.\n\"Executed properly under NHTSA's guidance, automated vehicles have the potential to greatly enhance the human experience - to prevent millions of car crashes and thousands of fatalities each year and to give mobility to those without.\"\nApple urged regulators not to impose too many restrictions on testing of self-driving cars, saying \"established manufacturers and new entrants should be treated equally.\"\nSince software would decide what actions to take in potentially dangerous situations, Apple said certain areas need special attention. These include the \"implications of algorithmic decisions\" for the safety, mobility and legality of automated vehicles and their occupants, ensuring privacy and security in design, and the impact of the cars on employment and public spaces.\nSome analysts forecast millions of jobs will be lost once self-driving cars largely replace truck, taxi and Uber drivers, and eliminate the need for most vehicle repairs, insurance adjusters and other functions.\nIn September, the Obama administration proposed guidelines for the development of self-driving cars in a 15-point \"safety assessment,\" calling on automakers to voluntarily submit details of their systems to regulators.\nApple executives have been coy about their interest in cars. Chief Executive Tim Cook has suggested that Apple wants to move beyond integration of Apple smartphones into vehicle infotainment systems.\nBut Apple has never confirmed reports last year that it was hiring automotive industry engineers and designers to develop a driverless electric car, or that those efforts have been sharply scaled back this year.\nOther companies pursuing self-driving cars include Alphabet Inc's Google unit, Ford Motor Co, Volkswagen AG , Daimler AG, Tesla Motors Inc and General Motors Co.\nApple has reportedly held talks about investing in British automaker McLaren Technology Group, but McLaren downplayed speculation that Apple had proposed an investment.\nApple joins a range of automakers and tech companies that have raised concerns about the proposed National Highway Traffic Safety Administration policy on self-driving cars, and plans by California state regulators to make complying with the safety assessment mandatory.\nAn auto trade group in November urged the incoming Trump administration to conduct a \"comprehensive regulatory review\" of all regulations and actions since Sept. 1, including the Obama administration's guidance on self-driving vehicles.\n(Reporting by David Shepardson; Editing by Richard Chang)",

      "text": "rebel-held Myanmar mine@ (Corrects to clarify that Shenmao Technology did not say it bought tin from the Wa mine)\n* United Wa State Army blacklisted by U.S. over drug trafficking\n* Mine run by armed group in \"Wa State\" is a major producer of tin\n* Top smelter Yunnan Tin indirectly buys big quantities of Wa tin\n* Many international companies list Yunnan Tin as a supplier\n* Sourcing tin from mine puts firms at risk of sanctions breach\nYANGON/WASHINGTON, Nov 29 (Reuters) - From a remote corner of northeastern Myanmar, an insurgent army sells tin ore to suppliers of some of the world's largest consumer companies.\nMore than 500 companies, including leading brands such as smartphone maker Apple, coffee giant Starbucks and luxury jeweller Tiffany & Co, list among their suppliers Chinese-controlled firms that indirectly buy ore from the Man Maw mine near Myanmar's border with China, a Reuters examination of the supply chain found.\nThe mine is controlled by the United Wa State Army (UWSA), which the United States placed under sanctions for alleged narcotics trafficking in 2003. The seven companies extracting tin from the mine are all owned or controlled by Wa military and government leaders, Wa officials and people with close ties to UWSA leadership told Reuters.\nThis potentially puts companies, which also include industrial conglomerate General Electric, at risk of violating sanctions that forbid \"direct or indirect\" dealings with blacklisted groups, according to a former and a serving U.S. official and lawyers with expertise in sanctions enforcement.\nSeveral sanctions experts said the U.S. government was unlikely to fine companies who unwittingly used the Myanmar tin. Still, it may force them to shift to new suppliers, they said.\nA Treasury Department spokeswoman said U.S. sanctions \"generally prohibit U.S. companies from engaging in any direct or indirect transactions or dealings with individuals or entities\" on a blacklist, but declined further comment on specific circumstances.\nThe situation illustrates the difficulties facing multinationals in monitoring supply chains that have grown increasingly complex.\nFollowing a 2012 U.S. regulation, companies have spent billions of dollars scrutinizing whether certain minerals used in their products come from mines controlled by armed groups in Central Africa.\nBut the regulations do not require them to assess the origins of minerals from other conflict zones.\nApple, Tiffany and GE, and other companies contacted by Reuters, said that to fulfil those regulations they looked to an audit programme designed by the industry group Conflict Free Sourcing Initiative (CFSI).\nA CFSI programme director said the group was \"aware of tin exports from Myanmar to other countries and of security and human rights issues in Myanmar\". The group said it was updating its audit requirements to include \"a broader definition of conflict-affected and high-risk areas\".\nTin supply chain expert at monitoring group Global Witness, Sophia Pickles, said companies must not wholly outsource due diligence responsibility to a scheme that has exclusively focused on central Africa.\n\"Companies, not schemes, bear the primary responsibility for ensuring that supply chains are responsible,\" she said.\nCIVIL WAR\nMost of the tin mined globally is used as solder in electronics, for making batteries and plating.\nThe Man Maw mine roiled the global tin market when huge quantities of high grade ore were discovered around 2013. Annual production is now estimated at about 33,000 tons of tin concentrate, more than a 10th of global output of the metal.\nThe mine is controlled by the UWSA, the strongest of the myriad armed groups that have kept Myanmar in a state of near-perpetual civil war for decades. Reuters visited the remote mine last month, the first international media organisation to do so.\nInterviews with officials running the mine, UWSA leaders and executives at Asian tin suppliers, together with an examination of public disclosures of suppliers made by companies in regulatory filings, indicate Wa tin likely ends up in an array of products made by U.S. and other international companies.\nTin from Man Maw provides revenue critical to the survival of the self-proclaimed Wa State and its rulers, who have refused to disarm or participate in Myanmar's peace process.\n\"There are dozens of trucks carrying tin ore to China every morning,\" the head of the Wa territory foreign affairs office, Zhao Guo An, told Reuters. \"Tin mining is the pillar of our economy. It's the biggest source of income.\"\nWhile Washington has lifted most sanctions on Myanmar, some have been kept in place, including those aimed at the UWSA. The group and several of its leaders are blacklisted under the Kingpin Act over accusations of trafficking in heroin and methamphetamine. UWSA leaders deny involvement in narcotics, saying the accusations are a smear by political opponents.\nPeter Kucik, a former senior sanctions advisor at the U.S. Treasury Department, said the findings highlighted the need for thorough due diligence.\n\"The facts suggest potential sanctions risk for the parties involved,\" Kucik said.\nThe world's No. 1 tin producer, Yunnan Tin Co Ltd , told Reuters that some tin it bought was from the Wa mine, the source of almost all Myanmar's tin exports.\nMandy Gan, a tin analyst from China's leading mineral research company, Asian Metal, and another tin expert, both of whom visited the UWSA mine this year, said many other Chinese smelting firms supplying global consumer goods makers also bought tin from the Man Maw mine.\nSanctions experts said even the indirect use of the tin might be considered a violation of U.S. sanctions law, which does not require authorities to prove intent. A U.S. government official involved in Myanmar policy consulted on Reuters' findings said the government was likely to investigate any ties to the UWSA.\nStill, Washington-based sanctions attorney Erich Ferrari said it was unlikely the Treasury Department would initiate an enforcement action against companies for an issue so deep in the supply chain. Once the ties were publicized, however, authorities could impose penalties if the companies did not wind down the transactions and find new suppliers, he said.\nSUPPLY CHAIN\nThe chain connecting some of the world's best known brands with a mine in one the most inaccessible corners of Southeast Asia has many links.\nOne key intermediary is state-owned Yunnan Cultural Industry International (YCII), based in Yunnan, southwestern China, which said in a statement on its website that it enjoys \"a long-term, stable strategic partnership\" with the UWSA statelet.\nYCII declined several interview requests.\nYCII is, in turn, a major supplier of tin to the world's top producer, Yunnan Tin, also based in Yunnan.\nYunnan Tin supplies many companies, including big contract manufacturers such as Foxconn Technology Co. It also supplies major solder makers such as Shenmao Technology , whose clients include Pegatron Corp, another large contract manufacturer. Both Pegatron and Foxconn count Apple among their clients.\nTim Lin, an executive overseeing sourcing at Taiwan-based Shenmao, said about a quarter of its supply of the metal came from Yunnan Tin. While it was possible Yunnan Tin bought tin from Myanmar, sourcing from the country was not regarded as problematic by the audit programme Shenmao follows, he said.\n\"Myanmar is not considered a conflict-affected area by CFSI...As long as smelters present a certified sourcing document, that's acceptable for us,\" said Lin.\nIn the last two years, Yunnan Tin has also shipped more than 12,000 tons of metal to the United States, according to shipment data from U.S.-based trade tracking company Panjiva.\nMore than 500 publicly traded companies in the United States say their suppliers use tin from Yunnan Tin or Yuntinic Resources, its San Mateo, California-based division, according to a review of the supply chain disclosures consumer companies make to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.\nTwo members of Yunnan Tin's board, vice chairwoman Yang Yimin and secretary and vice general manager Pan Wenhao, confirmed in interviews that a \"portion\" of the company's tin came from the UWSA-operated mine.\n\"We certainly buy tin indirectly from Myanmar,\" Pan told Reuters. \"We don't specifically pay attention to where they source their materials from.\"\nYunnan Tin mixes the Wa tin with metal from mines in central and southwestern China, said Pan, before processing it into products such as tin paste.\nThat means it is impossible to say for certain which shipments from the company contain Wa tin, but Pan estimated Yunnan Tin's purchases from the mine account for about a third of its total annual tin consumption, or at least 16,500 tons.\nApple said in a statement it worked with suppliers to help them meet stringent standards, \"and those who are ultimately unable or unwilling to comply are removed from our supply chain\".\n\"While we have no evidence of illegal tin from Myanmar in our products, we'll continue to investigate, address any issues we find and do all we can to raise standards and protect human rights,\" it said.\nFoxconn said it \"enforced stringent supplier management requirements in accordance with international and local conflict minerals legislation and has proactively communicated these requirements to our suppliers\".\nIt added that less than 1 percent of its tin was procured from Yunnan Tin, all of which was used in products for a \"single, non-U.S.-based customer\".\nPegatron Corp said it carried out \"annual due diligence on suppliers and encourage them to source from validated conflict-free supply chains\".\n\"Pegatron will continue working with customers and international organizations to investigate and source minerals responsibly,\" the company added.\nFROM JEWELLERY TO APPLIANCES\nCompanies that sell consumer products in the United States are required by the Dodd-Frank Act to publish their suppliers of tin and other minerals.\nAmong the companies listing Yunnan Tin, Tiffany said one of its suppliers had indirectly sourced a \"very small amount of tin\" from the Chinese smelter for use in silver solder for jewellery and hollowware.\nThe company added that, as Yunnan Tin was certified as conflict-free by the CFSI, \"use of this smelter by our vendors is consistent with our Conflict Minerals Policy\".\nStarbucks said small amounts of Yunnan Tin metal, sourced from second or third party suppliers, went into the ovens in its coffee shops.\nThe company had received no information indicating it was using minerals from Myanmar, a spokeswoman said, but was pushing suppliers for more detailed sourcing disclosures.\nA GE spokesman said the company strived to use ethical sourcing in its mineral supply chain, adding it had \"noted the concerns raised by Reuters and will address them through our internal process and with our external partners\".\nA spokeswoman from discount retailer Target said in a statement it was \"committed to responsible business conduct\".\n\"We take these allegations very seriously, and we are looking into this,\" the statement said.\n(Additional reporting by Antoni Slodkowski in Yangon, JR Wu in Taipei, Jussi Rosendahl in Helsinki and Helena Soderpalm in Stockholm, Paul Carsten in Beijing and Sijia Jiang in Hong Kong; Editing by Alex Richardson)",

      "text": "\nHating on the hump is easy, getting to the bottom of Apple's battery case for iPhone takes a full review.\nUpdate: Apple has just released a new Product (RED) version of the Smart Battery Case to benefit World AIDS Day. Check out the new pictures below!\nThe Smart Battery Case, originally introduced last year for the 4.7-inch iPhone 6s and iPhone 6, now supports the new iPhone 7. At launch it generated an incredible amount of internet noise. Much of it was reactionary and superficial. The \"hump\" on the back overshadowed the very clever engineering going on, outside and in.\nSince then, though, it's become the go-to for people who need extra battery life for trips, conferences, and even everyday life. Even those who mocked the design seem to have been won over by its utility.\nThere's no version for the 5.5-inch iPhone Plus size, presumably because that line already benefits from a bigger power reserve. This battery case is intended to even the playing field — to allow you to have your smaller phone but use it longer too. So, does it?\nSee at Apple \nSmart Battery Case hump Because the Smart Battery Case is essentially Apple's silicone case for iPhone with a power pack embedded in the back, it looks like it has a \"hump\" or \"bump\". An iPod on top of the iPhone. Yoda on Luke's back. Whatever you want to call it, it's there and it's impossible to ignore.\n\nObjectively the design is fine. It's symmetrical, impeccably moulded, and enables significant functionality. Subjectively, it's awkward-looking. There's an unabashed minimalism to it that's not ugly per se, because it's not lopsided or ostentatious, but that's severely lacking in the elegant curves and lines we've come to expect from Apple.\nAnd that's made for some fascinating reactions.\nApple is routinely criticized for putting form ahead of function. In this case, though, putting function ahead of form has resulted in some of the loudest bouts of criticism in recent history.\nThe \"hump\" is the result of hard choices made during the design process. By not running the battery all the way along the back, and by not using rigid material to cover it, Apple can hide a hinge beneath the silicone. That hinge lets the top part of the case bend backwards so you can slide your iPhone in and then slip the case back over it.\nIt provides an alternative to the two-piece cases that require you to remove the top or back in order to put them on. They're typically fussier and more difficult to put on, and the extra parts are susceptible to damage or loss. So, even though the Smart Battery Case is less pleasing to the eye, the resulting one-piece design is a huge win.\nLikewise the reception. With other cases, the material can sometimes cause cellular signal to drop. Manufacturers have done a lot to mitigate that over the years, but in areas that already have bad reception, it can still be a problem.\nBecause of the Smart Battery Case's design, the antenna bands are essentially covered only by thin silicone portion of the case. Moreover, Apple has added coupled passive antennas to further maintain signal. As a result, even in areas where I typically have poor coverage, I haven't noticed any bars dropping. So, the Smart Battery Case may look awkward but the signal retention is another huge win.\nThat's critically important because when a phone loses signal it boosts the radio which drains power — the exact opposite of what you want with a battery case. It's something most battery cases suffer from, though, which makes them far less efficient.\nHere, Apple has solved for efficiency.\nThe lack of bulk around the sides is also great when you hold it. Because there's no padding to \"round it out\", it feels especially slim. For me, my index finger naturally falls right above the hump and the rest of it evaporates into my palm. That's considerably better than the slight stretching I feel when I hold other, more voluminous cases. Likewise, it's svelte enough that it slips into pockets without feeling bulky. So, not easy on the eyes but easy pretty much everywhere else.\nThe hinge, the antennas, the lack of bulk—none of these would be possible if Apple had gone with a more traditional design. None of that functionality would be there absent this form.\nFor some it won't matter. The hump will be a deal-breaker. They'll never be able to un-see it so they'll never buy it. For others, it'll be a non-issue. They'll frown at the hump once, then pick it up and seldom if ever think about it again.\nSmart Battery Case Finish The Smart Battery Case has a soft-touch finish that, for iPhone 7, comes in white and black — and, as of December 2016, Product (RED). The previous generation version for iPhone 6s and iPhone 6 comes in white and charcoal.\nTo my eyes, the white matches the Magnetic Charging Dock for the Apple Watch and the charcoal is similar to the Smart Keyboard Case for iPad Pro . The black is deeper and a better match for the (matte) and jet black of iPhone 7. The red, as with the rest of the Product (RED) line, is fire\nI like the new colors best. White looks crisp and clean on both models, but the black appeals to me far more than the charcoal did. And did I already say the Product (RED) is fire?\nI'm generally not a fan of soft-touch, though. Never have been. I dislike how much lint it holds onto. Whenever I have a soft-touch phone or case I constantly find myself trying—and failing—to keep it clean. I'm likely not in the majority on that, though.\nSince the soft-touch finish, especially combined with the shape, absolutely make the iPhone easier to hold, I think most people will appreciate it.\nSmart Battery Case Ports and Buttons The cutouts on the Smart Battery Case are great. There's ample room around the rear-facing iSight camera and flash, and around the mute switch. The acoustical port for the speaker channels sound to the front of the case. Not only does it prevent audio and calls from being muffled, it projects them loud and clear.\nThe edges of the case rise up above the screen so you can put it face down without scratching the glass. I was worried it might interfere with bezel gestures, like swiping to go backwards or forwards in Safari, but I haven't had any trouble.\nThe passthroughs for the other buttons, including the volume rocker and sleep/wake button, are similarly well done. You have to press a little harder but unlike some other cases they're move cleanly and feel precise.\nMy one grip is with how the 3.5mm headphone jack is handled. On the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6 version, the slim plug at the end of Apple's EarBuds fits into the hole at the bottom of the Smart Battery Case, no problem. Anything wider—and lots of headphone plugs are wider—and it won't fit at all. That's a problem.\nThe iPhone 7 version, of course, has no 3.5mm headphone jack and so has no need of a cutout. But it would benefit from providing one.\nJust like the iPhone Dock connects via lightning but provides 3.5mm out, it'd be great if the Smart Battery Case plugged into Lightning to charge the phone but provided its own 3.5mm out. That feels like it would fix the problem of the cutout on the version for iPhones 6 and provide additional functionality — and accessibility! — for the version for iPhone 7.\nSmart Battery Case Charging Apple has two huge home-court advantages with the Smart Battery Case. First, they get to use a fully functional Lightning passthrough—a Lightning port on the outside and plug on the inside. Second, they get full integration with iOS.\n\nSince the Smart Battery Case has a Lightning instead of a microUSB, you can charge it with the same cable you use to charge your iPhone. Moreover, since it's fully functional, you can charge both the case and the iPhone at the same time. That's one less cable you have to keep around or carry with you, and one less thing you have to remember to charge separately.\nThe charging is literally \"smart\" too. With the iPhone adapter, it'll charge the iPhone first then the case. With the iPad adapter, it seems to charge the iPhone and, because there's so much juice, charge the case at the same time. Either way, your iPhone gets priority, which means it'll always have the most charge possible.\nAlso, your iPhone knows when it's connected to the case rather than a plug so it's smart enough not to begin any backups or background tasks, or other processes that cause excessive drain. If you plug the case in, though, it's also smart enough to open up all those power-hungry processes.\nSome people might want a case to enable all that activity, of course, and plenty of cases do. Apple is doing something different: solving for maximum power efficiency in the lightest possible package.\nThat's why looking at milliamp hours is ridiculous. More gas doesn't help if you consume it faster. It's why Apple branded this the smart battery case rather than the big battery case. They're literally getting more bang from less battery.\nThanks to the iOS integration, charge status for both the iPhone and the Smart Battery Care is prominently displayed immediately on the Lock screen when you plug it in. Charge status for both is also available at any time from Notification Center. Simply swipe down from the top.\nLightning bolt icons show you exactly what is being charged and when. If the case is on, you see it charging the iPhone. If the case is plugged in, you see both the case and iPhone charging. And because you can see the exact percentage for each, which is far more precise then a sequence of four LED lights, you can make a more informed decisions about exactly how much power is left and exactly how you want to spend it.\nOther cases sometimes have independent on/off switches. That way, if you want them on your iPhone but not actively charging it, you can do that. Not so with the Smart Battery Case. If it's on, it's charging. That's a benefit. It's handling the power management so you don't have to, and in so doing, keeping the battery as healthy as possible.\nLikewise, there's no physical button and light system to show you charge level on the case. That means you can't just pick it up by itself and see how much charge is left. You have to put it on the iPhone.\nThere is a small LED light inside the case that, when you plug it in, will glow amber when charging and green when fully charged. It can't, however, tell you the level of charge. So, you're back to having to put it on your iPhone.\nAgain, unabashed minimalism. The case simply keeps your iPhone at the best possible power level at all times, and makes sure you're unnecessarily racing through your battery's charging cycles. You put it on and use it as needed—set it and forget it. For most people, letting the case do the work just works.\nSmart Battery Case Bottom Line At $99 to roughly double the charge capacity of the iPhone 7, iPhone 6s, or iPhone 6, the Smart Battery Case seems much more expensive than budget battery cases. Coming from Apple, that should surprise absolutely no one.\n\nJust like you can find cheaper phones than the iPhone, cheaper smart watches than the Apple Watch, and cheaper computers than the Mac, you can find cheaper battery cases than the Smart Battery Case. You just typically can't find them with the same level of materials, manufacturing, and integration. Those come with the Apple logo on the back.\nBeyond that, though, Apple is doing something novel here: They're trying to get the most power from the least battery. Bigger is heavier and that comes with a cost in the hand and the pocket or bag. Apple's case is for those who need a little extra juice some of the time, but want to be weighed down and bulked up as little as possible. That's what they're solving for.\nIf you don't care about any of that, then you should absolutely buy something else. If the hump isn't a deal-breaker, though, you should get the Smart Battery Case.\nSee at Apple \nOriginally written December 2015. Last updated December 2016 for Product (RED). \n",

      "text": "David Shepardson Apple joins a range of automakers and tech companies that have raised concerns about the proposed NHTSA policy on self-driving cars, and plans by California state regulators to make complying with the safety assessment mandatory. Photo: Reuters \nWashington: Apple Inc. is wading in to the debate over regulation of self-driving cars, declaring it is excited about the potential for automated transportation and calling on US regulators not to restrict testing of such vehicles. \nA five-page letter from Steve Kenner, Apple’s director of product integrity, to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is the company’s most comprehensive statement yet about its interest in self-driving vehicle technology. The 22 November letter followed more than a year of industry speculation about the computer and iPhone maker’s plans for expanding into transportation. \n“The company is investing heavily in the study of machine learning and automation, and is excited about the potential of automated systems in many areas, including transportation,” Kenner wrote. \n“Executed properly under NHTSA’s guidance, automated vehicles have the potential to greatly enhance the human experience - to prevent millions of car crashes and thousands of fatalities each year and to give mobility to those without.” \nApple urged regulators not to impose too many restrictions on testing of self-driving cars, saying “established manufacturers and new entrants should be treated equally.” \nSince software would decide what actions to take in potentially dangerous situations, Apple said certain areas need special attention. These include the “implications of algorithmic decisions” for the safety, mobility and legality of automated vehicles and their occupants, ensuring privacy and security in design, and the impact of the cars on employment and public spaces. \nSome analysts forecast millions of jobs will be lost once self-driving cars largely replace truck, taxi and Uber drivers, and eliminate the need for most vehicle repairs, insurance adjusters and other functions. \nIn September, the Obama administration proposed guidelines for the development of self-driving cars in a 15-point “safety assessment,” calling on automakers to voluntarily submit details of their systems to regulators. \nApple executives have been coy about their interest in cars. Chief executive Tim Cook has suggested that Apple wants to move beyond integration of Apple smartphones into vehicle infotainment systems. \nBut Apple has never confirmed reports last year that it was hiring automotive industry engineers and designers to develop a driverless electric car, or that those efforts have been sharply scaled back this year. \nOther companies pursuing self-driving cars include Alphabet Inc.’s Google unit, Ford Motor Co., Volkswagen AG , Daimler AG, Tesla Motors Inc. and General Motors Co. \nApple has reportedly held talks about investing in British automaker McLaren Technology Group, but McLaren downplayed speculation that Apple had proposed an investment. \nApple joins a range of automakers and tech companies that have raised concerns about the proposed National Highway Traffic Safety Administration policy on self-driving cars, and plans by California state regulators to make complying with the safety assessment mandatory. \nAn auto trade group in November urged the incoming Trump administration to conduct a “comprehensive regulatory review” of all regulations and actions since 1 September, including the Obama administration’s guidance on self-driving vehicles.

      "text": "Foxconn is the exclusive manufacturer of Apple iPhones, with its factories in Shenzhen, China. As reported by AsiaOne, A former senior manager at Foxconn Taiwan has been indicted for stealing thousands of iPhones. According to the report, the manager is identified by his family name as Tsai, who worked in the testing department. He’s been accused of stealing and selling 5,700 iPhones in China to pocket around $1.56 million.\nReportedly, Tsai instructed eight employees of the factory to smuggle out thousands of iPhone 5 and 5s. These were the testing phones which were supposed to be scrapped, but Tsai and his accomplices sold them to store in Shenzhen for $1.56 million from 2013 to 2014. Foxconn reported this case to Taiwanese authorities. Further, an internal audit was conducted, and Tsai was questioned after his return to the island earlier this year and later released on bail. He has been charged with breach of trust and is facing ten years in jail.\nFoxconn’s profit reportedly declined 31% in the second quarter of 2016, apparently, due to Apple iPhone’s poor sales performance same time this year. In that quarter, Foxconn made around $554.5 million, down from around $805 million in Q2 2015.\nFoxconn is one of the world’s largest contract manufacturers that assemble products for international brands including Apple and Sony. It has around 1 million workers in its factories across China. However, this is not the first time that Foxconn employees have come under the scanner. Back in 2014, five former Foxconn employees were charged with breach of trust for accepting a bribe of $5 million by suppliers to clear the quality checks and buy equipment. All of them faced the ten years and six months in jail.\nFoxconn had been under controversies since a long time for its factories’ working conditions as well. It has been accused of violating labour rights for many years. Allegedly, they keep their employees in overcrowded dormitories. They were made to work for excessive hours without any compensation for the same. In its defence, Foxconn said that they did overtime voluntarily. They are even accused of controlling every aspect of the lives of these workers and interfering in their personal lives as well. In 2013, there was a report of 3 Foxconn employees committed suicide.\nAlso, in September 2012 and 2013 , around 2000 workers started a riot protesting against growing economic pressure and poor working conditions. In May 2011, two Foxconn workers had died, and 16 were injured due to an explosion in one of the manufacturing plants. In January this year, a fire broke out in Foxconn’s main iPhone manufacturing facility in Zhengzhou, China.\nFor a company of this stature, it is highly embarrassing for Foxconn, over how they treat their employees and workers. In May 2016, Foxconn had reportedly replaced 60,000 factory workers with robots. Laying off this huge number of employees is against the Goodwill of any company.\nHowever, Foxconn is reportedly exploring the feasibility of shifting iPhone production from China to the U.S. Since China has cheaper labour and hardware costs, moving to U.S. will definitely increase production costs of the iPhones. It is estimated that the cost would increase more than double. The new U.S. President-elect Donald Trump, have also offered ‘tax cuts’ and ‘regulation cuts’ to Apple if they move its production to U.S.\n",
