      "text": "By Tiernan Ray\nAmazon.com ’s ( AMZN ) cloud computing conference in Las Vegas today offered up a Vegas-worthy stunt, a tractor-trailer truck that rolled up on stage, to much applause.\nAndy Jassy , CEO of the company’s cloud computing service, brought the truck, called “ Snowmobile ,” on stage toward the end of his keynote address. Snowmobile is an offering for companies that need to move “Exabytes” of data, he said, which turned out to be more companies than one might think.\nThe trunk is a follow-up to a data appliance that Amazon already offers called “ Snowball .”\nSnowball is a stand-alone computer that companies can take into the field to collect data, which later gets uploaded to their Amazon AWS account. Snowmobile is for companies that want to move huge amounts of data. Snowmobile drives to a customer location, plugs into the data center computes of the customer via a fiber-optic cable, and carts the data back to Amazon’s AWS facilities.\nAmazon also updated its Snowball product with a new version called “Edge,” which adds to the existing data storage capacity with on-board processing of data, so not everything needs to be immediately uploaded to AWS before it can be used.\nThe conference continues tomorrow with a keynote by Amazon’s colorful technical guru, Werner Vogels , at 8:30 am, Pacific time, 11:30, Eastern, and will be broadcast live on the conference site . You can check out the full schedule on the conference Web site .\nRecordings of the events after they’re broadcasted are being posted to a section of the site , in case you want to see something you missed.\nAmazon shares today are down $9.06, or 1%, at $753.46.",

One son has taken the family's wealth for granted and become a landlord; another is a thriving merchant and moneylender; the youngest, an ambitious general, is destined to be a leader in the country. Through all his life's changes, Wang did not anticipate that each son would hunger to sell his beloved land for maximum profit.\n",

      "title": "Amazon Extends Cloud Reach With Hardware",
      "text": "This week, Amazon Web Services gave its clearest acknowledgement to date that it doesn’t really expect everyone’s computing to happen in its data centers. With the advent of the Internet of things (IoT), which relies on millions of connected devices deployed nearly everywhere to collect and crunch data, the company knows it needs “feet on the street” in the form of its own connected devices in the field.\nTo accomplish that, Amazon announced Snowball Edge , portable hardware that incorporates both computing power and storage for customers to run some tasks and store some data locally. The Edge, announced at the annual AWS re:Invent conference in Las Vegas, is an offshoot of Snowball, a storage-only hardware appliance announced last year that stores corporate data for shipment to an AWS data center for uploading.\nBut unlike Snowball, Edge, pictured below, is meant to remain wherever the customer places it, to act as a local computing and storage node.\n\nAWS also unveiled AWS Greengrass , a small device powered by Intel intc chips and software written using Amazon’s Lambda tool. The software can then run both locally and in the AWS cloud, under the management of IT administrators.\nLambda creates what techies call “event-driven services.” It lets developers set up actions that automatically kick in once the software detects a certain condition like a user clicking on a web site, an image upload, or a sensor detecting a predetermined trigger. If your connected home alarm senses motion near the front door, the Greengrass device can fire off a text alert to you, your security service, the police, or all of the above--all without intervention by the homeowner.\nThe ability to divvy up computing between local and third-party providers is known as hybrid computing, and it’s been something of a problem for AWS, which has historically provided tools to move customer data to its cloud and to run all their applications there as well. But many companies see the need to retain some local data storage and computing, which is something legacy IT providers like Oracle orcl , IBM ibm , and Microsoft msft have driven home.\nIn the past, Amazon created polarization with enterprise IT people by saying they should leave many technology tasks up to AWS, said Peter Christy, research director for 451 Research. “Now it’s saying the enterprise mission is the edge of the Internet of things, that’s what enterprise IT should focus on, With the growth of IoT, we now understand the role we have in hybrid,”\nIn an interview with Fortune , Matt Wood, general manager of product strategy with AWS, said the notion of hybrid is simply the integration of infrastructure in the cloud with infrastructure not in the cloud,” That’s what Greengrass and Snowball Edge are all about.\nHaving said that, however, he reiterated Amazon’s long-held belief that over time, companies will need fewer of their own data centers, and allocate that work to what he calls a more efficient and agile public cloud infrastructure.\nStill, it’s clear that the company is betting that net flow of data into AWS will keep growing. To facilitate that, Amazon drove its latest data migration tool on directly onto the re:Invent stage in the form of a big-rig truck. This was the grand entrance of Snowmobile -- a secure shipping container that can transport 100 petabytes of data to an AWS data center, a task that could take months, maybe more, to do over a network connection. The truck’s unexpected arrival, with AWS chief executive Andy Jassy on stage, drew the biggest applause of the day.\nPer an AWS blog post .\nPhysically, Snowmobile is a ruggedized, tamper-resistant shipping container 45 feet long, 9.6 feet high, and 8 feet wide. It is water-proof, climate-controlled, and can be parked in a covered or uncovered area adjacent to your existing data center. Each Snowmobile consumes about 350 kW of AC power; if you don't have sufficient capacity on site we can arrange for a generator.\nSome people laughed at what seemed to be a low-tech way to transport data. Some attendees even thought Snowmobile was a parody but it’s a real thing. And given all the security enhancements it has, it’s hardly low-tech.\nFor companies that generate huge amounts of data that must be stored and made accessible as needed and that no longer want to foot the cost to do that locally, this is a viable data transfer option. For example, Snowmobile seems tailor-made for DigitalGlobe dgi , a provider of satellite imagery to Fortune 500 companies and the U.S. government. DigitalGlobe’s goal is to transition out of its own data centers into AWS over time, according to chief technology officer Walter Scott.\nDigitalGlobe, which collects 10 petabytes of earth imaging data annually, from its five satellites, had been using the smaller Snowballs to send data to AWS. But their capacity just wasn’t big enough, Scott told Fortune .\nGet Data Sheet , Fortune's daily newsletter on the business of technology. \nWhat most struck Constellation Research analyst Holger Mueller about the news was that AWS, known as a software and cloud power, is now offering customers hardware as well.\nFor more on AWS, watch: \nHe also noted that were Amazon really in tune with hybrid cloud, customers wouldn’t need a semi-tractor to move their data. Oracle, Microsoft, and IBM, all champion the hybrid model that enables companies to run their own private clouds while also using a public cloud for some jobs, make it easier to keep data where you need it--no truck required.",

      "text": "AWS Signals Big AI Push With Launch of 3 New Services Amazon Rekognition lets you leverage image recognition Polly lets you convert text to speech Lex lets you add a talking virtual assistant to your apps \nAmazon announced a big push into the AI space at re:Invent 2016, an annual conference hosted by Amazon Web Services (AWS) . Three new features form the crux of Amazon's AI push - Rekognition (image recognition), Polly (text-to-speech), and Lex (conversational technology). \nYou can now implement these features on any of your apps on websites that leverage AWS . Amazon Polly lets you convert text to speech in any of 47 voices available in 24 languages. Indian English is one of these voices, which is good news if your target audience is Indian. \nWhy would you need Amazon Polly? Text-to-speech technologies have plenty of uses, starting from reaching visually challenged people or those who have trouble reading to something like public announcements at railway stations or airports. Creating text-to-speech software has its own challenges. Words such as live, read, and some abbreviations such as St. have multiple pronunciations. Polly expands abbreviations including state names (such as WA), measurement units, and according to Amazon, knows how to pronounce words based on the context of the sentence.\nIn a blog post , chief evangelist for AWS Jeff Barr writes, \"In order to do this, we worked with professional, native speakers of each target language. We asked each speaker to pronounce a myriad of representative words and phrases in their chosen language, and then disassembled the audio into sound units known as diphones.\" \nBarr also says that Polly can be programmed to understand multiple languages used in the same sentence. It goes without saying that these have to be supported languages. \nAmazon Rekognition offers something entirely different - the ability to read images. You can use this to index your photos or categorise them based on the content of these images. Amazon says that you can even use this service to enable a technology like face unlock - authenticate user identity based on their face. \nAmazon Lex is powered by the same deep learning tech as the Alexa virtual assistant. If you want to create your own personal assistant on your app, you can use Lex to do that. During re:Invent 2016, Amazon demoed how these three technologies can come together. You could ask the virtual assistant to book flight tickets to some place with lots of lakes and hills. Now the assistant can show you a few photographs of such places and if you select one of these, it can book a flight to the nearest airport. \nThe key selling point of these features is that if you already use AWS, these features are very easy to add to your app or website. However, none of these features are free and some aren't available everywhere. Amazon Rekognition lets you analyse 5,000 images and store 1,000 face metadata for free for a year. After that you'll have to pay up to $1 (roughly Rs. 69) per 1,000 images. This feature is available in US East, US West, and EU regions of AWS. \nAmazon Polly lets you convert 5 million characters per month for free for the first year and charges up to $4 (roughly Rs. 280) per 1 million characters processed. It's available in all AWS regions. Lex costs $0.004 per voice request and $0.00075 per text request. \nDisclosure: Amazon sponsored the correspondent's flights and hotel for re:Invent 2016​",

      "title": "Amazon (AMZN) Sees Cloud Business as a Long-Term Opportunity",
      "text": " Amazon's ( AMZN ) biggest source of profit is its cloud-computing services division called Amazon Web Services, or AWS, but it's a long-term play, said AWS CEO Andy Jassy in a clip aired on CNBC's \"Power Lunch\" Wednesday afternoon.\n\"I don't think there will only be one successful company in this space. But I don't think there will be 30,\" Jassy claimed.\nThat's because these types of businesses require both scale and breadth of functionality, he explained. \"So I think the opportunity is really large, and it's one of the reasons why we often say that we think AWS has the potential to be the biggest business at Amazon long term.\"\nWhile Amazon.com has a \"commanding share\" of the cloud market, Alphabet's ( GOOG ) Google and Microsoft ( MSFT ) have the ability to challenge its sector dominance, particularly as the focus moves toward what the services can actually do in terms of functionality, analysts say, according to CNBC's Deirdre Bosa.\nIn addition, although President-elect Donald Trump notably called out Amazon for antitrust issues, Jassy said he isn't worried about that affecting the company's ability to get government cloud business. Amazon has been around since 1994 and doesn't change what it does based on who's president, he said.\n\"We will continue to listen to what customers want and deliver the right long-term customer experiences. We expect the same to be true here,\" Jassy said.\nShares of Amazon were lower in late afternoon trading Wednesday, as the e-commerce giant continues to miss out on the post-election Trump rally. The stock is down over 3% in the past month.",

      "title": "Amazon Extends Cloud Reach With Hardware - Fortune",
      "text": "© 2016 Time Inc. All rights reserved. Amazon Extends Cloud Reach With Hardware \nThis week, Amazon Web Services gave its clearest acknowledgement to date that it doesn’t really expect everyone’s computing to happen in its data centers. With the advent of the Internet of things (IoT), which relies on millions of connected devices deployed nearly everywhere to collect and crunch data, the company knows it needs “feet on the street” in the form of its own connected devices in the field. \nTo accomplish that, Amazon announced Snowball Edge , portable hardware that incorporates both computing power and storage for customers to run some tasks and store some data locally. The Edge, announced at the annual AWS re:Invent conference in Las Vegas, is an offshoot of Snowball, a storage-only hardware appliance announced last year that stores corporate data for shipment to an AWS data center for uploading. \nBut unlike Snowball, Edge, pictured below, is meant to remain wherever the customer places it, to act as a local computing and storage node. \nAWS also unveiled AWS Greengrass , a small device powered by Intel intc chips and software written using Amazon’s Lambda tool. The software can then run both locally and in the AWS cloud, under the management of IT administrators. \nLambda creates what techies call “event-driven services.” It lets developers set up actions that automatically kick in once the software detects a certain condition like a user clicking on a web site, an image upload, or a sensor detecting a predetermined trigger. If your connected home alarm senses motion near the front door, the Greengrass device can fire off a text alert to you, your security service, the police, or all of the above—all without intervention by the homeowner. \nThe ability to divvy up computing between local and third-party providers is known as hybrid computing, and it’s been something of a problem for AWS, which has historically provided tools to move customer data to its cloud and to run all their applications there as well. But many companies see the need to retain some local data storage and computing, which is something legacy IT providers like Oracle orcl , IBM ibm , and Microsoft msft have driven home. \nIn the past, Amazon created polarization with enterprise IT people by saying they should leave many technology tasks up to AWS, said Peter Christy, research director for 451 Research. “Now it’s saying the enterprise mission is the edge of the Internet of things, that’s what enterprise IT should focus on.” Thus the Internet of things has given AWS entry to a mode of hybrid computing. \nIn an interview with Fortune , Matt Wood, general manager of product strategy with AWS, characterized the notion of hybrid as “the integration of infrastructure in the cloud with infrastructure not in the cloud,” That’s what Greengrass and Snowball Edge are about. \nHaving said that, he reiterated Amazon’s long-held belief that over time, companies will need fewer of their own data centers, and allocate that work to what he calls a more efficient and agile public cloud infrastructure. \nSo it’s clear that the company is betting that net flow of data into AWS will grow. To facilitate that, Amazon drove its latest data migration tool on directly onto the re:Invent stage in the form of a big-rig truck. This was the grand entrance of Snowmobile — a secure shipping container that can transport 100 petabytes of data to an AWS data center, a task that could take months, maybe more, to do over a network connection. The truck’s unexpected arrival, with AWS chief executive Andy Jassy on stage, drew the biggest applause of the day. \nPer an AWS blog post . \nPhysically, Snowmobile is a ruggedized, tamper-resistant shipping container 45 feet long, 9.6 feet high, and 8 feet wide. It is water-proof, climate-controlled, and can be parked in a covered or uncovered area adjacent to your existing data center. Each Snowmobile consumes about 350 kW of AC power; if you don’t have sufficient capacity on site we can arrange for a generator. \nSome people laughed at what seemed to be a low-tech way to transport data. Some attendees even thought Snowmobile was a parody but it’s a real thing. And given all the security enhancements it has, it’s hardly low-tech. \nFor companies that generate huge amounts of data that must be stored and made accessible as needed and that no longer want to foot the cost to do that locally, this is a viable data transfer option. For example, Snowmobile seems tailor-made for DigitalGlobe dgi , a provider of satellite imagery to Fortune 500 companies and the U.S. government. DigitalGlobe’s goal is to transition out of its own data centers into AWS over time, according to chief technology officer Walter Scott. \nDigitalGlobe, which collects 10 petabytes of earth imaging data annually, from its five satellites, had been using the smaller Snowballs to send data to AWS. But their capacity just wasn’t big enough, Scott told Fortune . Get Data Sheet , Fortune’s daily newsletter on the business of technology. \nWhat most struck Constellation Research analyst Holger Mueller about the news was that AWS, known as a software and cloud power, is now offering customers hardware as well. For more on AWS, watch: \nHe also noted that were Amazon really in tune with hybrid cloud, customers wouldn’t need a semi-tractor to move their data. Oracle, Microsoft, and IBM, all champion the hybrid model that enables companies to run their own private clouds while also using a public cloud for some jobs, make it easier to keep data where you need it—no truck required.",

      "text": "  Amazon Is Working On New 7-inch Touchscreen Echo Speaker [VIDEO] According to Bloomberg and The Wall Street General, Amazon is working on its new tablet-like Echo Speaker with built in Alexa voice assistant. By Surav , EnStars on Dec 01, 2016 12:22 AM EST Amazon Dot and Amazon Echo (Photo : Getty Images/Luke MacGregor) Advertisement \nAmazon is developing a new premium Echo-like speaker with a 7-inch touchscreen which will be controlled and respond by Amazon's voice-based digital assistant Alexa. It's been two years since Amazon released the last model of Echo. \nIn May, The Wall Street Journal reported that \"Amazon is developing a new tablet-like gadget that contains its Alexa voice assistant built in.\" \nNew Amazon Echo will also control and respond through voice-based digital assistant Alexa. It will play music, provide information, news, weather, sports score and more instantly. Touchscreen could be used for easy access to a weather forecast, calendar appointment, etc. \n\"The latest Amazon speaker will be larger and tilt upwards so the screen can be seen when it sits on a counter and the user is standing.\" As written in Bloomberg . It has high-grade speakers which will make it sound much better than current Echo speakers. \nThe touchscreen will be of 7-inch, which is a new feature added by Amazon. Previous amazon echo did not have a touchscreen. Amazon will announce its latest Echo-like speaker in the first quarter of 2017. However, there is no confirmation received yet from Amazon the Seattle-based company. \nAmazon will give a good competition to Apple and Google on voice-controlled home devices with this upcoming touchscreen speaker. Amazon also tried to enter the vast market of smartphone and tablets but they did not succeed that much. However, Amazon's Echo speakers have been an amazing hit. It's estimated US sales is more than 5 million units since 2014. \nJust like Apple Inc., Amazon will also use single OS on all devices. The new device may use an optimized version of Fire OS, which currently runs on Fire Tablets and Fire TV set-top box. This new device will be costly compared to other devices such as Dot, Tap and Echo speakers which are currently available at $49.99, $129.99 and $179.99.  ",

      "text": "AWS Snowmobile Will Move Your Data to the Cloud in a Huge Truck AWS Snowmobile is a truck to move data to the cloud It can store upto 100 petabytes of data It is available in all AWS regions, including India \nEnterprise services and technologies often fail to excite those of us who aren't a part of the field. Amazon Web Services (AWS) , one of the largest and most profitable divisions of e-commerce giant Amazon, has unveiled a new service that's an exception to the norm. That service is called AWS Snowmobile. \nTo emphasise how unusual this is, Amazon drove in a 15-metre long truck to the stage while unveiling AWS Snowmobile during its re:Invent 2016 conference in Las Vegas on Wednesday. Is Amazon getting into the trucking business? Well, sort of. \n( Also see: Amazon Makes It Easy for Anyone to Add a Virtual Assistant to Their App ) AWS Snowmobile is the company's solution for enterprises that need to move massive amounts of data to the cloud. Each Snowmobile can move up to 100 petabytes (100,000 terabytes) of data to the cloud in one trip. This means that if your company has exabytes (1000 petabytes is 1 exabyte) of data to move to the cloud, AWS Snowmobile could do it in a matter of weeks.\nAmazon says this is the fastest method available for data migration as of now. The good news is that AWS Snowmobile is available in all AWS regions including India. Yes, Amazon will send a truck your way to help you migrate data to the cloud. \nAWS CEO Andy Jassy, at a press briefing session at the sidelines of the event, said this could cost companies something like 5 cents per gigabyte per month. The price will vary per company and its requirements, and the company's blog post doesn't mention any pricing information. \nFor those who don't need to move that much data to the cloud, Amazon unveiled the Snowball Edge - a 100TB hard drive stack with a rugged enclosure. It can also be used by those who need to carry their data to remote or offline locations. Snowball Edge pricing is listed online . \nDisclosure: Amazon sponsored the correspondent's flights and stay for re:Invent 2016​",

      "text": "There's no question that Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) is the king of cloud computing. Amazon Web Services (AWS), the e-commerce giant's cloud computing arm, generated $3.2 billion of revenue during the third quarter alone, putting the business at an annual run rate well over $10 billion. Few of its major competitors disclose detailed information, but according to Synergy Research, AWS controls 31% of the global cloud infrastructure market, compared to 24% for the next three largest players combined.\nImage source: Amazon.\nFor all the success that AWS has achieved, it's not exactly a simple service. Amazon likes to brag about how AWS is constantly adding new features, but those features present an overwhelming array of options for developers. Niche players have popped up in recent years in an effort to make the cloud more accessible, allowing customers to spin up virtual servers in minutes without much configuration. DigitalOcean, a start-up founded in 2011, is one of the most prominent.\nDigitalOcean offers five standard virtual private server options, with fixed compute, memory, and storage, and a set of configurations that customers can use to install applications like Wordpress instantly. In a few minutes, a fully functional virtual server is ready to go, with minimal effort on the part of the customer. The cheapest plan is just $5 per month, with resources sufficient for basic use cases. This business model has proven successful for the company. DigitalOcean claimed in August that it had 700,000 customers, compared to around 1 million for AWS.\n Amazon fights back Given DigitalOcean's success, it should come as no surprise that Amazon is going after the company. At the AWS re:Invent conference currently taking place, Amazon introduced a new service called Lightsail, essentially a carbon copy of DigitalOcean. While AWS has been leading the way in many areas over the years, this is a case where Amazon is straight-up copying a competitor.\n ",

      "title": "Amazon Uses Trucks To Drive Data Faster -- update",
      "text": "By Jay Greene By Laura Stevens\nLAS VEGAS -- In Amazon Web Services, Amazon.com Inc. has built one of the most powerful computing networks in the world, on pace to post more than $12 billion in revenue this year.\nBut the retail giant on Wednesday proposed a surprising way to move data from large corporate customers' data centers to its public cloud-computing operation: by truck.\nNetworks can move massive amounts data only so fast. Trucks, it turns out, can move it faster.\nTo the sound of throbbing heavy-metal music and flashes of strobe lights, Amazon drove a big rig onto the floor of the Sands Expo & Convention Center during the company's annual customer conference.\nThe tractor-trailer hauls a massive storage device, dubbed Snowmobile, in the form of a 45-foot shipping container that holds 100 petabytes of data. A petabyte is about 1 million gigabytes.\nTransporting data from companies to cloud providers has become immensely time-consuming as corporate data storage has ballooned from terabytes to petabytes to exabytes, each step a factor of roughly 1,000 larger than the last.\n\"When we started AWS [in 2006], the notion of an exabyte of data just seemed completely out there,\" AWS Chief Executive Andy Jassy said. \"Today, an exabyte of data is much more common.\" That is equivalent to about 250 million DVDs or one trillion books of 400 pages each.\nAmazon plans to drive Snowmobiles to its customers' offices, extract their data, then cruise to an Amazon facility where the information can be transferred to the cloud-computing network in far less time than it would for so much data to travel over the web.\nThe company, however, isn't promising lightning speed. Ten Snowmobiles would reduce the time it takes to move an exabyte from on-premises storage to Amazon's cloud to a little less than six months, from about 26 years using a high-speed internet connection, by the company's calculations.\nDuring a press conference, Mr. Jassy declined to disclose the cost of each Snowmobile unit but noted that the company has \"several\" of them. The trucks are currently available and customers are using them, he said. Snowmobile will cost half a cent per gigabyte per month of use, or about $500,000 a month to use its full capacity.\nThis isn't the first time Amazon has circumvented the web to move data faster. Last year it introduced a suitcase-sized data-transfer service appliance known as Snowball. Amazon on Wednesday upgraded that gadget, doubling its capacity to 100 terabytes.\nBut for customers who sought to move petabytes or even exabytes of data, the larger Snowball wouldn't be enough.\n\"The first thing we thought was, 'We're going to need a bigger box,' \" Mr. Jassy said.\nThe truck and the suitcase-sized device are part of the retail giant's bid to woo large corporate customers, who have invested heavily in their own data centers, to move to Amazon's cloud. Many have shifted key computing operations to cloud providers, but a significant number continue to run some jobs in their own facilities, even as they take advantage of public cloud providers, an arrangement known as hybrid cloud.\nRelatively rapid data-transfer methods such as Snowmobile and Snowball may spur them to move faster to use Amazon's services.\nNonetheless, Mr. Jassy acknowledged that the majority of companies likely would keep some computing operations in-house. \"Most enterprises are going to operate in hybrid mode for many years to come,\" he said.\nThat is one reason why Amazon announced a partnership last month with VMware Inc. to allow VMware customers to take advantage of AWS services without abandoning their data centers.\nVMware Chief Executive Pat Gelsinger joined Mr. Jassy on stage Wednesday and called the response to the joint offering \"overwhelming.\"\nAt the conference, Amazon also debuted new services intended to help coders build web-based applications that tap into the retail giant's artificial-intelligence capabilities.\nAmazon Rekognition will let software developers write programs that detect the number of people in a photo, spot their gender and identify objects. It also can match faces, which could be useful in comparing two images to confirm, for example, a person's identity.\nThe company also launched Amazon Polly, which converts text to speech. It lets programmers transform text input, such as \"The temp in WA is 75 degrees F,\" into spoken output that says, \"The temperature in Washington is 75 degrees Fahrenheit.\" This feature, available in 27 languages, could be used to build conversational applications.\nAnother new offering, Amazon Lex, affords access to the Alexa artificial-intelligence service that runs on the company's Echo device. LEX understands spoken input, enabling developers to build software that answers questions.\nA pizza company, for example, could build a web-based program that asks users what toppings they want when they order a pie. Such an application could keep track of previous orders so the system could ask customers if they wanted the same toppings again, Mr. Jassy explained.\n\"A lot of companies don't realize the heritage that Amazon has in the machine-learning space,\" Mr. Jassy said, referring to the area of artificial intelligence that makes such services practical.\nThe online retailer has thousands of employees focused on artificial intelligence, he noted. This could be used for services that show customers who bought a particular item; what other items they might like purchase or Echo's Alexa AI assistant.\n\"We do a lot of AI at the company,\" and Amazon Web Services customers wanted access to that, Mr. Jassy said.\nWrite to Jay Greene at Jay.Greene@wsj.com and Laura Stevens at laura.stevens@wsj.com\n(END) 30, 2016 19:34 ET (00:34 ",

      "title": "Amazon, Kohl’s, Home Depot, Nike and Dick’s Supply Chain Executives to Keynote at eft’s 2nd Annual D3: Dynamic Distribution Disruption – Retail Summit in New York",
      "text": "The biggest so-called holiday shopping weekend of the year just ended. The result: some shops wrecked due to big crowds, websites crashed due to high traffic, while other millions of shoppers decided to #OptOutside ditching Black Friday altogether. Regardless, one thing is certain – retail is going through a major disruption. This disruption is driven by consumer preferences, and can be solved through a robust supply chain. The movers and shakers of retail are gathering in May in New York for the D3 Retail Summit: https://goo.gl/3S2x4d . Leading physical and online merchants, including Amazon, Kohl’s, Home Depot, Aldo and Nike, will blaze a trail for the industry through an omnichannel future in which supply chain will increasingly represent retailers’ USP. The Home Depot recently announced that they will be returning in May for the keynotes. “The D3 Summit was an outstanding event. The opportunity to meet with high level executives in supply chain in an intimate setting, provided for great candor and conversation. Everyone walked away highly energized with a larger network of experts and friends to leverage in the future,” commented Scott Spata, Home Depot’s VP of Supply Chain about the summit this year, and will be representing the company at D3 in May.\nDiscussions will center around eight key themes: consumer-driven supply chain, demand forecasting, inventory strategy, warehouse optimization, supplier collaboration, logistics and last-mile delivery, network redesign and route optimization, and organizational alignment. Download the brochure for more details: https://goo.gl/3S2x4d\nPriyanka Asera, Head of Retail at eft and D3’s principal architect, believes that the excitement around the event is a reflection of the retail industry having arrived at a crossroads. “Distribution and supply chain are no longer backroom functions, they are a core part of every retailer’s business and therefore require a more holistic, strategic approach,” Asera explains. “It is also incredibly exciting that we have Amazon involved as part of the keynotes since Amazon is the biggest enabler of pushing retail out of its comfort zone. Alexis is fantastic – and she is also the former VP of Operations at Target so she brings a wealth of all-round experience with her.”\nConfirmed speakers include:\nAlexis DePree, VP Global Customer Fulfilment, Amazon Ratnakar Lavu, CTO, Kohl’s Scott Spata, VP Supply Chain, The Home Depot Eileen Meade, VP Omnichannel Strategy, Dicks Sporting Goods Darrell Edwards, Chief Supply Chain Officer, La-Z-Boy Jeff Girard, SVP Logistics, DSW Don La France, SVP Supply Chain Technology, 1800flowers Jonathan Parks, VP Global Operations & Logistics, Rent-a-Center Bryan Eshelman, COO, Aldo Neil Beckerman, SVP Supply Chain and Finance, New York & Co. Pooja Agarwal, VP Operations, Birchbox Mike Griswold, VP Retail Research, Gartner\nChairing the summit is Hugh Williams, Managing Director at Hughenden Consulting, who will oversee two days of lively debate encompassing a broad cross-section of departments and companies. Williams said, \"I believe it is critical for retailers to be conscious of the needs of the customer in everything they do. But that is only half the story. They also need to work closely with all their supply chain partners to ensure that they all move away from the traditional push system to truly being demand-led. Retailers must take responsibility for driving the supply chain and building true partnerships.\"\nSponsors of the D3 Summit include Mercury Gate, B-Stock Solutions, Convey, project44, Bringg, Macropoint, Transfix and AFS.\nFor detailed information on the agenda, 40+ speakers, venue and more, download the brochure: https://goo.gl/3S2x4d\nIf companies are interested in getting involved, they are encouraged to contact Priyanka Asera via the details below.

      "text": "0 The logos of Australian electronic goods retailers JB Hi-Fi and the privately-held 100-store rival The Good Guys are displayed at a shopping center in Sydney, Australia, May 19, 2016. Reuters/David Gray \nJB Hi-Fi chief Richard Murray said on Wednesday that he was not threatened by Amazon's retails offering in Australia. Instead, he said that the stores would keep up the competition. the company currently have 300 distrIbution stores that are conveniently located around the country. \n“Now obviously there are some things that Amazon has done very well, but the thing about it, be it Amazon or Alibaba or any of these pure plays is that I guess, the hype and the reality are always a challenge ... and you have to be careful not to overreact,\" Murray said during the American Chamber of Commerce lunch. \nHe also recognised that the US retail company has a high percentage of market share in the US around online sales. But he also noted that apart from Amazon, there are plenty of successful retailers in the US. \n“Competition drives us to be better, and Amazon has had an amazing journey overseas. But the reality is they have a high market share in the US around online sales ... and when we think about that, the power of in-store and online is incredibly powerful,” Murray said. \n“If we continue to keep on the money on price and we have the lowest cost of doing business — that is really powerful,” Murray said. “Across a basket of goods we want to be the best value in the market. Today we know we are and we plan to stay that way.” \nOn Nov. 25, Woolworths announced that it is already planning for the arrival of Amazon in Australia in 2017. \nRead more: Woolworths sets up a plan to compete with Amazon store's arrival in Australia 2017 \nOn Monday, JB Hi-Fi formally closed the $870 million acquisition of The Good Guys. \n\"The acquisition is a very attractive strategic opportunity for JB Hi-Fi since The Good Guys is a highly complementary business which is aligned with our management philosophy and significantly enhances our offering in the $4.6 billion home appliance market,\" Murray said in a statement.",

      "title": "Amazon announces three new AI services called Lex, Polly and Rekognition for AWS",
      "text": "Amazon has started to offer artificial intelligence based services on its AWS platform, to give developers more tools to engage with customers. The three new AI tools are called Lex, Polly and Rekognition. Lex is the technology that powers Amazon Alexa, and allows developers to integrate rich conversational experiences in their offerings. Polly is a state of the art text to speech service that has forty seven life like voices in twenty languages. Rekognition is an image processing service, that can identify content in images.\nRaju Gulabani, VP, Databases, Analytics, and AI, AWS said “The combination of better algorithms and broad access to massive amounts of data and cost-effective computing power provided by the cloud is making AI a reality for application developers. We are excited to see how customers use Amazon Lex, Amazon Polly, and Amazon Rekognition to build a new generation of apps that have human-like intelligence and can see, hear, speak, and interact with people and their environments”\nLex \nLex is the machine learning technologies that powers Amazon Alexa, with the key components being Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) and Natural Language Understanding (NLU). Lex can be used by developers to quickly make chat and voice bots, that can be integrated into services and applications. Lex is deployed as a fully managed service, requiring little time to set up, manage and scale.\nThe main concepts used by Amazon Lex. Image: Amazon.\nLex has an itnegrated development environment in a console. Developers can create bots, test them, and deploy them through the interface. There are some sample bots to start with as well. Bots built using Lex can be used on multiple platforms, and Amazon handles the authentication processes for different platforms. Lex can connect with Facebook Messenger as of now, but support for Slack and Twilio is being worked on. The Lex service is charged at the rate of $4 for 1000 speech requests, and $0.75 for 1000 text requests.\nThe testing interface for bots. Image: Amazon.\nBenjamin Stein, Director of Messaging Products, Twilio said “Developers and businesses use Twilio to build apps that can communicate with customers in virtually every corner of the world. Amazon Lex will provide developers with an easy-to-use modular architecture and comprehensive APIs to enable building and deploying conversational bots on mobile platforms. We look forward to seeing what our customers build using Twilio and Amazon Lex.”\nPolly \nPolly is a cloud based text to speech service that generates human like voice based on a text string. The files can be downloaded as an mp3 for use in applications and services. Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML) is supported for advanced functionality, such as mixed language text. Developers can use SSML to indicate to Polly that some words in an English sentence are in French. There is a vast language end region menu, with support for five regional accents for English, including Indian. There are two alternative accents each for French, Portuguese and Spanish.\nPolly supports plain text or SSML. Image: Amazon.\nThe SDK or console can be used to send text to Polly, which then converts it to speech in the cloud and beams it back. The service can be integrated into e-book readers, personal assistants, entertainment apps, public service announcement systems, or e-learning platforms. Polly can handle high volumes of text rapidly as well. Polly can return input over a command line interface as well.\nsome of the accents and languages available in Polly. Image: Amazon.\nJoseph Price, Senior Product Manager, The Washington Post said “We’ve long been interested in providing audio versions of our stories, but have found that existing text-to-speech solutions are not cost-effective for the speech quality they offer. With the arrival of Amazon Polly and its high-quality voices, we look forward to offering readers more rich and versatile ways to experience our content.”\nRekognition \nRekognition is an image analysis artificial intelligence. Rekognition can be used to recognise faces, objects and scenes in an image. The AI delivers a confidence score for each identification, which is a rating of how accurate the identification is likely to be. These confidence scores can be further processed by an app or a service. There are advanced facial analysis functionalities such as face comparison, and face search.\nRekognition gives scores on a picture, confidently identifying the image as that of a “dog” and a “pet”. Image: Amazon.\nSome of the capabilities of Rekognition include assessing if the mouth of a person is open or shut, whether or not they are smiling, if they are happy, whether they are wearing sunglasses and identify the presence or lack of facial hair. Applications for Rekognition include security services, smart marketing implementations that track user engagements, or automatic indexing and tagging for vast image libraries.\nAWS has advanced features for processing images of faces. Image: Amazon.\nDon MacAskill, Co-Founder, Chief Executive Officer, and Chief Geek, SmugMug said “SmugMug customers want to spend their time making more memories, not manually managing their photo collection. Amazon Rekognition will allow us to automatically identify the content in customers’ photos, unlocking a host of features that will allow them and their visitors to have more time to focus on enjoying life and celebrating their photos.”\nThe three new AI services are scalable and cost effective, with developers paying for only what they use. Amazon has simplified access to neural networks, data required for training, and expertise in machine learning. The heavy lifting is done by Amazon already, with the artificial intelligences trained for a wide variety of scenarios. Developers can directly start using the AI without building machine learning algorithms, training the AI with models, or commit to infrastructure investments up front.\n \nThe post Amazon announces three new AI services called Lex, Polly and Rekognition for AWS appeared first on Tech2 .",

      "text": "December 01, 2016 at 03:00 AM EST Tiger Group Experts: ABL Lenders Should ‘Have No Fear’ Of Amazon \nEcommerce giant has created a seamless, profitable liquidation process for buyers and sellers alike, write Tiger’s Andy Babcock and Ryan Davis in latest issue of ABF Journal. \nNew York, New York (PRWEB) December 01, 2016 \nSome asset-based lenders (ABLs) still hesitate to lend against inventory held at Amazon’s warehouses. However, savvy e-tailers, distributors and manufacturers increasingly see the upside of using the e-commerce giant as a closeout channel, write two liquidation and asset appraisal experts from Tiger Group in the November/December issue of ABF Journal. \nTypically, lenders cite Amazon’s lack of a collateral access agreement as well as its ban on liquidation language. But Tiger’s Andy Babcock, Director of Transition Services, and Ryan Davis, Director of Appraisals, note a dramatic increase in the amount of inventory moving through the company’s Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA) program. “Lenders would be wise to pay attention, as this shift will affect liquidation strategies, and therefore net recovery values, for a wide variety of companies,” they write in the piece (“Have No Fear: Why the Rise of Amazon Is Good For the ABL Sector”). \nBabcock and Davis explain the three avenues available for the sale of merchandise on Amazon. In the first, Amazon purchases and warehouses inventory in its own facilities and ships orders to consumers. “Amazon typically chooses the items it stocks based on historical and projected demand, focusing primarily on branded items with relatively fast turnover,” they write. \nIn the second, a company can use the marketing-through-Amazon approach. Here, products are listed on Amazon’s website through a seller account. “Unlike websites like eBay, which require sellers to write their own item descriptions, Amazon has developed a simple process: A seller can search for the exact item on Amazon, use that description and input the quantity available,” Babcock and Davis explain. \nThe third method is Amazon’s FBA program. “Here, Amazon serves not only as a marketing site, but as a third-party warehouse and logistics provider,” write the Tiger Group veterans. “Sellers send their inventory to Amazon’s warehouses and don’t have to deal with warehousing inventory or shipping products. The seller retains ownership of the merchandise, and Amazon automatically maintains the inventory and credits sales to the seller’s account.” \nImportantly, FBA merchandise qualifies for Amazon’s popular Prime program, which not only gives participating customers expedited free shipping, but also improves the seller’s placement in the search-results if there are multiple sellers, the authors note. “Amazon handles all packaging, shipping and — crucially — all customer returns,” they explain. “FBA program participants pay warehousing and shipping charges, as well as the standard per-unit sales commissions and fees.” \nToday, many disposition specialists prefer to see inventories liquidated through FBA, as opposed to the traditional jobber model, because the revenues and expenses are often more predictable and controllable than running a sale with company employees and facilities, Babcock and Davis write. \nThree options are available when liquidating inventory already situated in a FBA facility: a physical transfer out of Amazon’s sites, an ownership transfer and sale through FBA, or continued use of the debtor’s FBA account. According to Babcock and Davis, lenders can realize the best recovery when the liquidator works on a fee basis, selling the merchandise through FBA and utilizing the debtor company’s FBA account. “The total revenues generated under this fee-basis arrangement should, in effect, be the same as in the scenario where the inventory stays at FBA with an ownership transfer to the liquidator,” they write. “This method yields a lower profit for the liquidator, but generates more dollars for the estate.” \nThe article also addresses ABL lenders’ concerns about the lack of a collateral access agreement with Amazon. “Barring an extremely unlikely scenario — for instance, if the company had so few sales through the FBA channel that it actually owed more in fees than it generated in revenue — Amazon is likely to owe the debtor money and not the other way around,” they note. “Therefore, rather than pulling the inventory out of Amazon, the liquidator could continue to use the FBA service with no additional capital needed.” \nNor should lenders be overly concerned about the ban on liquidation language in this channel: “Selling through Amazon is almost purely about price,” Babcock and Davis explain. “Liquidators can spur demand by simply lowering the prices of a given product — without needing the strong sales language that they’ve used for decades to stir consumer interest in liquidation sales. \nWhile many lenders prefer to make all sales final in liquidations—a practice prohibited by Amazon policies—even this should not prevent liquidators from using Amazon, the authors maintain, citing the efficiency of Amazon’s return system. “The liquidator need only budget properly for the fees associated with returns to account for this factor,” they write. \nThe full column is available at: http://www.abfjournal.com/%3Fpost_type%3Darticles%26p%3D54815 \n### \nMedia Contacts: At Parness & Associates Public Relations, Bill Parness, bparness(at)parnesspr(dot)com, (732) 290-0121 or Mobile: 732-673-6852. \nFor the original version on PRWeb visit: http://www.prweb.com/releases/2016/12/prweb13890276.htm Nasdaq quotes delayed at least 15 minutes, all others at least 20 minutes.

Sorry There was an error emailing this page. \nAWS CEO Andy Jassy speaks at the company’s Re:Invent conference in Las Vegas on November 30, 2016. Credit: Blair Hanley Frank Does the Cloud Free up the Enterprise? \nAmazon Web Services continued to push its infrastructure offering forward on Wednesday with the launch of upgrades to its existing instance types and new tools for simplifying and accelerating computation tasks in its public cloud. \nAWS CEO Andy Jassy unveiled a new Elastic GPUs feature for the Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) that will let developers add flexible acceleration using parallel processing for their applications. \nOn top of that, Amazon launched a new Lightsail service that’s aimed at giving customers an easy way to spin up a straightforward virtual private server without having to orchestrate a fleet of different AWS services. Finally, the company also unveiled upgrades to its burstable, memory intensive, high I/O, and compute intensive instances. \n[ Download the State of the CIO 2016 report ] \nAll of these announcements are aimed at helping Amazon maintain its leading position in the infrastructure-as-a-service market. The company has positioned its IaaS offering as foundational to its cloud platform. \nThe Elastic GPU service will let developers attach GPUs to different EC2 instances, so they can get the graphical acceleration they need without having to pay for specific, GPU-accelerated instances. When users first spin up an instance, they’ll be able to attach up to 8GiB of GPU vRAM. If they need to change the amount of vRAM available, developers will be able to shut down, modify and then spin up the instance again. \nIt’s a service that will be useful for a variety of applications, like gaming, graphical rendering and machine learning. The GPUs will be available for all of Amazon’s instance types, once they launch officially in the future. Right now, the amount of vRAM that an instance needs determines which of Amazon’s existing GPU-attached instances customers have to use. \n“Developers will love having slices of GPU, instead of paying for it all the time,” IDC Program Director Al Hilwa said in an email. \nIt’s similar to functionality that Google announced earlier this month, which will let companies attach GPUs to any of the compute instances running in its cloud. Amazon’s OpenGL library will automatically detect and use Elastic GPUs, which will be a boon to developers. Amazon \nA pricing chart shows the different pricing available for Amazon's new Lightsail VPS service. \nLightsail will allow people to easily spin up a virtual private server on AWS without having to understand how to start up a compute instance, connect it to storage, handle networking and more. Instead, users make a few clicks to select what they want the server to do, pick out its hardware capabilities and give it a name. \nLightsail servers start at $5 per month, which gets users 512MB of memory, 1 vCPU, 20GB of SSD storage, at 1TB of data transfer. Users can go all the way up to $80 per month, with 8 GB of memory, 2 vCPUs, 80GB of SSD, and 5TB of data transfer. \nJassy said users that want to then take advantage of additional AWS services will be able to go “under the hood” with a Lightsail instance and connect with other AWS services. \nOn top of all that, Amazon also announced refreshes to a host of different instance types that it already has available. New R4 instances are an upgrade to Amazon’s memory-focused R3 instances. They sport up to 488GiB of DDR4 memory and up to 64 vCPUs. That’s twice the memory available with the previous instances, and twice the number of virtual processors. \nAmazon’s burstable T2 instances got new t2.xlarge and t2.2xlarge types , which provide twice and four times the number of virtual CPUs and memory compared to the t2.large instance type, respectively. \nThe high I/O I3 instance type, which will be available in the future, will support configurations with up to 488GiB of memory, 3.3 million IOPS, 15.2TB of NVMe SSD storage and 64 vCPUs. On top of all that, the forthcoming compute-intensive C5 instances will support up to 72 vCPUs and 144GiB of memory. \nAll of these infrastructure revisions are part of Amazon’s announcements at its Re:Invent conference. The company also announced a new instance type that lets users access field-programmable gate arrays to help accelerate particular applications.

      "title": "Tiger Group Experts: ABL Lenders Should 'Have No Fear' Of Amazon",
      "text": "December 01, 2016 at 06:47 AM EST Tiger Group Experts: ABL Lenders Should 'Have No Fear' Of Amazon PRWeb \nSome asset-based lenders (ABLs) still hesitate to lend against inventory held at Amazon's warehouses. However, savvy e-tailers, distributors and manufacturers increasingly see the upside of using the e-commerce giant as a closeout channel, write two liquidation and asset appraisal experts from Tiger Group in the November/December issue of ABF Journal. \nTypically, lenders cite Amazon's lack of a collateral access agreement as well as its ban on liquidation language. But Tiger's Andy Babcock, Director of Transition Services, and Ryan Davis, Director of Appraisals, note a dramatic increase in the amount of inventory moving through the company's Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA) program. \"Lenders would be wise to pay attention, as this shift will affect liquidation strategies, and therefore net recovery values, for a wide variety of companies,\" they write in the piece (\"Have No Fear: Why the Rise of Amazon Is Good For the ABL Sector\"). \nBabcock and Davis explain the three avenues available for the sale of merchandise on Amazon. In the first, Amazon purchases and warehouses inventory in its own facilities and ships orders to consumers. \"Amazon typically chooses the items it stocks based on historical and projected demand, focusing primarily on branded items with relatively fast turnover,\" they write. \nIn the second, a company can use the marketing-through-Amazon approach. Here, products are listed on Amazon's website through a seller account. \"Unlike websites like eBay, which require sellers to write their own item descriptions, Amazon has developed a simple process: A seller can search for the exact item on Amazon, use that description and input the quantity available,\" Babcock and Davis explain. \nThe third method is Amazon's FBA program. \"Here, Amazon serves not only as a marketing site, but as a third-party warehouse and logistics provider,\" write the Tiger Group veterans. \"Sellers send their inventory to Amazon's warehouses and don't have to deal with warehousing inventory or shipping products. The seller retains ownership of the merchandise, and Amazon automatically maintains the inventory and credits sales to the seller's account.\" \nImportantly, FBA merchandise qualifies for Amazon's popular Prime program, which not only gives participating customers expedited free shipping, but also improves the seller's placement in the search-results if there are multiple sellers, the authors note. \"Amazon handles all packaging, shipping and -- crucially -- all customer returns,\" they explain. \"FBA program participants pay warehousing and shipping charges, as well as the standard per-unit sales commissions and fees.\" \nToday, many disposition specialists prefer to see inventories liquidated through FBA, as opposed to the traditional jobber model, because the revenues and expenses are often more predictable and controllable than running a sale with company employees and facilities, Babcock and Davis write. \nThree options are available when liquidating inventory already situated in a FBA facility: a physical transfer out of Amazon's sites, an ownership transfer and sale through FBA, or continued use of the debtor's FBA account. According to Babcock and Davis, lenders can realize the best recovery when the liquidator works on a fee basis, selling the merchandise through FBA and utilizing the debtor company's FBA account. \"The total revenues generated under this fee-basis arrangement should, in effect, be the same as in the scenario where the inventory stays at FBA with an ownership transfer to the liquidator,\" they write. \"This method yields a lower profit for the liquidator, but generates more dollars for the estate.\" \nThe article also addresses ABL lenders' concerns about the lack of a collateral access agreement with Amazon. \"Barring an extremely unlikely scenario -- for instance, if the company had so few sales through the FBA channel that it actually owed more in fees than it generated in revenue -- Amazon is likely to owe the debtor money and not the other way around,\" they note. \"Therefore, rather than pulling the inventory out of Amazon, the liquidator could continue to use the FBA service with no additional capital needed.\" \nNor should lenders be overly concerned about the ban on liquidation language in this channel: \"Selling through Amazon is almost purely about price,\" Babcock and Davis explain. \"Liquidators can spur demand by simply lowering the prices of a given product -- without needing the strong sales language that they've used for decades to stir consumer interest in liquidation sales. \nWhile many lenders prefer to make all sales final in liquidations--a practice prohibited by Amazon policies--even this should not prevent liquidators from using Amazon, the authors maintain, citing the efficiency of Amazon's return system. \"The liquidator need only budget properly for the fees associated with returns to account for this factor,\" they write. \nThe full column is available at: http://www.abfjournal.com/%3Fpost_type%3Darticles%26p%3D54815 \n### \nMedia Contacts: At Parness & Associates Public Relations, Bill Parness, bparness(at)parnesspr(dot)com, (732) 290-0121 or Mobile: 732-673-6852. \nRead the full story at http://www.prweb.com/releases/2016/12/prweb13890276.htm PRWeb.com Nasdaq quotes delayed at least 15 minutes, all others at least 20 minutes.

      "text": "  Amazon Releases Ember Bold Font for the Kindle November 30,   Leave a Comment Ember on the left, Ember Bold on the right. \nAmazon has just released a new font called Ember Bold for the Kindle Oasis , Kindle Paperwhite and Kindle Voyage . This new typeface will give older readers and people with vision problems an opportunity to have the text in an e-book a little bit bolder, resulting in a smoother reading experience. \nOne of the biggest complaints that people with vision problems had with the Amazon Kindle line of e-readers is that regular weight fonts difficult to read. This has resulted in many users switching to Kobo e-readers, which have more versatility in font selection and allow for the importing of custom fonts. Others have elected to download specific apps for their smartphones and tablets. It looks like Amazon has just solved one of the biggest lingering issues with the advent of Ember Bold. \nYou should get the 5.87 firmware update pushed out to your Kindle e-reader within the next couple of days via WIFI. Once the update is installed you merely have to open up an e-book and select the new font from the dropdown menu.  ",

      "title": "Indie Authors Are Ruining The e-Book Discovery Process on Amazon",
      "text": "  Indie Authors Are Ruining The e-Book Discovery Process on Amazon November 29,   1 Comment \nThere is a flood of self-published e-books on Amazon, that tell you right there in the title what they’re about and how great they are. The Amazon Top 10 Book section is being flooded with indie authors optimising their titles to grab your attention, or in other words clickbait. \nThe big trend in 2016 have been indie authors implementing copylines into book titles on Amazon. They are taking advantage of the way book titles are displayed and how users search through book titles. This has resulted in thousands of books having the words “bestseller”, “bestselling” and “romantic” in their titles, ensuring that readers who search for these keywords will display their e-book. \nThe main culprit driving up these clickbait e-books are Kindle Unlimited and Kindle First . People who grab the e-books for free as part of their Prime membership are artificially inflating them to into the top 10 list. This has resulted in casual readers finding these books by browsing their favorite e-book genre or searching for the keyword “bestseller.” They see a price of $1.00 or $2.00 and often buy the book on an impulse. \nI feel that indie authors are ruining the e-book discovery process on Amazon with their cringe worthy titles in their desperate attempt to get them sales. I am hoping that Amazon cracks down on specific keywords being entered into the title because it’s things like this that contribute to the publishing industry consistently losing money on developing and marketing e-books.

Millions of Alexa devices were purchased this holiday shopping weekend. Fire Tablets sales were up 2x compared to last Cyber Monday. Fire Kids Edition has its best holiday shopping weekend ever—continues to be the #1 kids tablet in the U.S., across all retailers. Amazon Fire TV sales were up more than 2.5x year-over-year on Cyber Monday. Fire TV continues to be the #1 streaming media player in the U.S., across all retailers. The Kindle e-reader business continues to grow—customers bought hundreds of thousands of Kindle e-readers this holiday weekend. \n“Customers purchased millions of Amazon’s Alexa-enabled devices this holiday weekend—the all-new Echo Dot, the best-selling 7” Fire tablet, and the new Fire TV Stick with Alexa Voice Remote are all available for under $50 and all powered by Alexa,” said Dave Limp, Senior Vice President, Amazon Devices & Services. “It’s never been easier to have Alexa in any or every room, and we’re excited for millions of new customers to discover Alexa this holiday season.” \nMany Amazon device customers already enjoyed using Alexa this holiday weekend, as well as other festive Amazon content on their devices: Alexa helped customers prep and cook for their Thanksgiving gatherings. Customers asked Alexa to set nearly 2x as many timers on Thanksgiving Day as the day before, and customers asked Alexa nearly 3x as many questions about cooking during Thanksgiving week compared to the week prior. The top 3 most popular Kindle cookbooks downloaded during Thanksgiving week include: “Essential Spices and Herbs,” “The Healthy Pressure Cooker Cookbook,” and “Me, Myself and Pie.” Customers listened to 40% more Amazon Music on Alexa devices than any other device on Thanksgiving. The top playlist on Alexa devices for Thanksgiving was “Thanksgiving with the Family;” the following day, “Christmas Classics” became the #1 playlist. Prime Video’s hit new show “The Grand Tour” was the most streamed title on Thanksgiving Day, followed by “Goliath.” The most popular holiday titles viewed on Amazon Video on Thanksgiving Day include “Christmas Vacation” and “Charlie Brown Christmas.”  ",

      "text": "Deforestation Rates Skyrocket In Brazil As Country Struggles To Save The Amazon The Amazon rainforest is an important fixture in the fight against climate change. 12/01/2016 04:52 am ET Nick Visser Reporter, The Huffington Post Credit: Ueslei Marcelino / Reuters Roughly 3,000 square miles of rainforest was lost in the Brazilian Amazon in 2016. Deforestation rates in the Amazon rainforest in Brazil have soared , with an area roughly three times the size of Rhode Island illegally chopped down, an annual satellite survey by the country’s government shows. Brazil’s National Institute for Space Research found the rate of deforestation rose 29 percent from August 2015 to July 2016, representing more than 3,000 square miles of rainforest. The region has been under near constant threat from lucrative illegal logging and the expansion of cattle and agriculture plantations. An area roughly the size of California has been wiped out in the past 40 years. The Brazilian government has made a concerted effort to protect the rainforest, which is home to about 10 percent of the planet’s known biodiversity . Conservation efforts have cut the rate of deforestation by 71 percent since it peaked in 2004. But the recent uptick reflects the ongoing struggle the country faces as it seeks to completely end illicit logging by 2030 , in an effort to curb greenhouse gas emissions. Credit: Ueslei Marcelino / Reuters Rangers working with Brazil's environment ministry often dole out harsh, on-the-spot punishments for illegal loggers, like burning their vehicles. But they have a hard time catching them and are struggling to pay for basic needs like fuel. Credit: Ueslei Marcelino / Reuters The Amazon rainforest absorbs billions of tons of greenhouse gas emissions every year, an important role in the fight against climate change. The Amazon is an important fixture in the fight against climate change because it absorbs about 2 billion tons of carbon dioxide every year. When vast swaths of the rainforest are lost, not only is that ability hindered, but the carbon stored within the trees is quickly released back into the atmosphere, spurring more global warming. Researchers have warned that ongoing rates of deforestation also threaten more than half of all tree species in the Amazon as well as about 180 indigenous groups that live in and depend on the forest for survival. A report this week from Reuters news agency found the environment ministry doesn’t have enough funding to adequately patrol the forest after a 30 percent budget cut. The group in charge of that effort, IBAMA , can’t even afford fuel for vehicles and helicopters. “We haven’t even had enough money to pay for [$60] aptitude tests to allow our agents to carry guns,” Uiratan Barrossa, the head of law enforcement for IBAMA, told Reuters. “The loggers are better equipped than we are. Until we have the money to rent unmarked cars and buy proper radios we won’t be able to work.” Also on HuffPost Donald Trump's Environment Guy Doesn't Believe In Climate Change Donald Trump's Environment Guy Doesn't Believe In Climate Change 1 11 He does not believe in climate change. “There has been a little bit of warming ... but it’s been very modest and well within the range for natural variability, and whether it’s caused by human beings or not, it’s nothing to worry about,” Ebell told Vanity Fair in 2007.More than 97 percent of scientists agree that the world's climate is warming and it’s caused by human activities. Yet Ebell believes this consensus of climate experts is “phony” and “not based on science.” In 2015, Ebell called Pope Francis’ encyclical on climate change “scientifically ill informed, economically illiterate, intellectually incoherent and morally obtuse.”“It is also theologically suspect, and large parts of it are leftist drivel,” he added.

      "title": "Sony MDR-1000X Review",
      "text": "Buy at Amazon \nEarlier this year we took a look at the Sony H.ear On Wireless NC, and though many people were saying they were better than the Bose QC35s in every way, I was a little skeptical. Something about them just didn’t make them a clear winner to me. Since then a lot of you guys have been commenting and telling me to take a look at the MDR-1000X. I’m glad I did. Spoiler alert: I can get behind these 100%. What’s inside \nWhen you open the box, you’re first greeted with a hardshell carrying. In there is where you’ll find the headphones. You’ll also get a 3.5mm audio cable, a micro USB charging cord, and an airplane adapter. Then there’s the paperwork consisting of the instruction booklet and warranty information. Build & Design \nThe MDR-1000x have a similar design overall to the H.ear on Wireless NCs that we previously looked at. The one key difference you’ll find is on the outside of the ear cups. Where the H.ear Ons were entirely plastic, these have a synthetic leather covering the ear cups. It’s not real leather, but it does have a subtle smell that kind of reminds me of shoe shine polish. That fake leather is mirrored in the ear cups and headband where it’s stuffed with a really comfortable foam. I had no problem listening to these for hours at a time without discomfort. \nTowards the top of the ear cups are two small microphones that help with the active noise cancelling and ambient mode (more on them later). The ear cups do rock back and forth slightly so you can get the best fit possible, but they can also rotate 90 degrees and fold flat. Going a step further, you can fold them down at the hinges so you can fit them nicely in the carrying case (or just stuff them in your back). Along the bottom of the left ear cup you’ll find a 3.5mm input as well as the power, ANC, and Ambient Sound buttons. All of which have tiny grooves on them to help you easily distinguish between them while wearing them. The right ear cup only has a micro USB port for charging and a tiny microphone. \nThough the headphones are mainly plastic they do feel pretty solid. I wouldn’t go as far as to say that they’re durable, but they’ll definitely survive a bit more than your average twists and turns. Again, don’t go throwing these down a flight of stairs but if they’re in your bag they should be fine. Connection \nBeing a Sony product, these are particularly well suited to Sony lovers. If you already have a hi-res music player or something capable of playing LDAC files, you’ll get higher quality out of these as they support both. The rest of us will have to settle for Bluetooth with aptX codec, which is fine to me. Connection strength is solid and though you won’t be able to reach 100 feet like some of the other headphones we’ve recently reviewed, I was able to get to about 50 or 60 before skipping became a problem. So it’s not best in class range, but it is better than average. I was even able to get the mail out front with no skips in the music. \nThe only buttons on the headphones are on the bottom of the left ear cups. There’s a power/pairing button, a button to turn on active noise cancelling, and another that lets you cycle between the ambient sounds. This is the one that’s probably most interesting. You can choose between “normal” and “voice” modes. Normal mode will use the microphones to let most sounds pass through the headphones along with your music, while voice mode (as you might have guessed) will only let in voices. Once you decide which one you prefer, you can turn on ANC to completely block everything out. Then if you need to hear an announcement on the train or if someone walks up to talk, you can active ambient mode simply by placing your hand to the right ear cup. It’s touch sensitive and will automatically return to your music once you remove your hand. I did have some issues where ambient sound mode would turn on accidentally if I had to reach up and adjust my headphones, so just be aware of the touch pad sensitivity. Using that same touch sensitive ear pad you can pause/play music by tapping, skip between tracks by swiping left and right, and adjust volume by swiping up or down. \nThe controls are a little finnicky and sometimes when you want to raise the volume you’ll instead end up pausing the song which can get a little annoying. But one tip I can give is to swipe fairly slowly and with intention. If you hastily swipe at the headphones it will only register the tap and pause the music. Battery Life \nSony claims a battery life of 20 hours with Bluetooth and active noise cancelling turned on. In our testing we got a total of 18 hours, but that was on maximum volume. If you keep the volume at a respectable 60-80% like you probably should, I can easily see them reaching the full 20 hours. Sound Quality \nUnfortunately I don’t have an LDAC compatible device, but I do have some FLAC files that I did some of the testing with. Still, most of my testing was done on streaming services like Spotify, Google Play Music, and Tidal. \nLows \nSony isn’t new to headphones, and that shows with the MDR-1000x headphones. The low end is smooth and nicely controlled, but definitely can’t be described as strong. These might not be for bassheads who enjoy a thumping low end, but they’re right up my alley. \nMids \nMids are usually where a lot of companies put most of the emphasis into, and these are no exception. Vocals aren’t as forward as I’ve heard in other pairs of headphones, but on the brightside instruments that are usually way in the background sound great. The vocals in “Oceanside” by The Decemberists are clearly discernible, but the guitar and drums behind them sound full and clear. \nHighs \nHighs gave me an issue because even though they sounded decent for the most part, I felt like they only sounded really good when the headphones were on relatively high volume. Pushing the volume up gave the cymbals and hi-hats of “Stranger Things” by Local Natives greater detail. When on average volume it lost some of that airyness. Conclusion \nOverall, the Sony MDR-1000x headphones are exactly what Sony needed. It’s definitely expensive at $400, but that’s not unheard of in the class of Bluetooth ANC headphones that it’s competing in. The active noise cancelling was just as good as, and sometimes even better than the QC35s. These definitely tend towards the warmer end of the spectrum, so if that’s not your cup of tea you might find these disappointing, but again it’s right up my alley. Once you get the hang of the touch controls they do become fairly intuitive, but they’re still a little hit or miss. That said, they work more often than they miss and the ease of use definitely makes it a handy feature.",

      "text": "  Don't miss out on rebates By Ariyanna Norman, Komando.com \nAren't rebates great? Only if you remember to redeem them! If you're ignoring Amazon rebates then you're missing out on free money. \nAmazon offers mail-in rebates and online rebates on lots of items. If you find one, here's what you need to know so that you can get some cash back. \nMail-In Rebate \nThe rebate form does not come with your package so you need to print it from the details' page of the product you purchased. On that page, click where it says \"Rebate forms.\" Make sure you print the form before the postmark deadline. After the deadline, the link to the form disappears. \nYou may also need to print proof-of-purchase documentation, like the sales receipt. If you threw it away already, you can print a copy from your Amazon account. Fill out your rebate form and mail it in with the required documents. \nThese rebates have two deadlines. You must buy the eligible item by the purchase deadline and mail in the rebate form by the postmark deadline. If you submit the rebate, you can't return the item you purchased. \nOnline Rebate \nThere's a special portal on the Amazon website where you can check if an item you purchased is eligible for an online rebate . You'll need to have your order number and the email address on your Amazon account handy. You should also have the packing slip that was delivered with the item you purchased. You will use these documents to complete an online rebate form. \nTwenty-four hours after you submit the form, you'll be able to check the status of the rebate . The site can use your tracking number, order number, or your name and ZIP code to look it up. \nThese rebates also have the same two deadlines. You need to buy the item by the purchase deadline and submit the online rebate form by the postmark deadline. Also similar to mail in rebates, you can't return the item after submitting the rebate form. \nUnfortunately, rebates can take from 12 to 15 weeks to process. Make sure you read all the terms and conditions for each rebate. You can contact the Amazon Help Department if you have any questions. \nPlease share this information with everyone. Just click on any of these social media buttons. Email",

      "text": "Amazon Ad Getting a lot of Talk; is it a Dig at Trump? posted by iHeartMedia’s Cliff Saunders - Just now A new commercial from Amazon featuring a priest and imam is getting a lot of attention right now. And there are those who think it’s a shot that’s been fired at President-Elect Donald Trump. You might have seen ad where the priest and imam are friends, and buy each other the same gift. Michael Johns, co-founder of the National Tea Party movement, told KTRH you could say this is a dig at the President Elect. “It shows a disconnection between Silicon Valley and the nationalistic sentiments that emerged in the Trump candidacy,” Johns explained. Mustafa Tameez, a former consultant with the DHS under President George W. Bush, disagrees, and says it's not what you think it is. “He’s the President-Elect, but he’s not the center of the universe. Amazon is just trying to appeal to the 2.2 billion Christians and the 1.6 billion Muslims so they can sell a few more books online,” Tameez explained. \nAmazon would not comment to KTRH about the ad, but they did remove a doormat from its website that used the word 'Allah' after online criticism that it offended the Muslim community. \n",

He wonders what would happen if we were to take as our starting point that technology could be our best angels, not our worst. Introducing Amazon Lex -- Amazon's bot framework, basically building out from Alexa intents. CyberChef -- GCHQ's web app for encryption, encoding, compression and data analysis , which you can play with straight from GitHub . 12 Signs You're in a Feature Factory -- I'm crying, it's so accurate. The signs: No measurement. Rapid shuffling of teams. Success theatre. Infrequent (acknowledged) failures. No connection to core metrics. No PM retrospectives. Obsessing about prioritization. No tweaking. Culture of hand-offs. Large batches. Chasing upfront revenue. Shiny objects.

It also ties into other Amazon Web Services (AWS) tools so developers who are already using Amazon-hosted services can more easily create a bot experience.

      "text": "Youtube Amazon launches Kindle e-books in 5 Indian languages \nAmazon’s Kindle e-reader will finally support e-books in regional languages. Users will now be able to read e-books in a total of five India languages including Hindi, Tamil, Marathi, Gujarati and Malayalam. \nAmazon claims Kindle Book Store in India will feature digital books, including the largest selection of best sellers and hundreds of exclusive titles in aforementioned Indian languages. The catalouge includes bestseller titles such as “Ishq Mein Shahar Hona” by Ravish Kumar (Hindi), “Rajaraja Chozhan” by Sa. Na. Kannan (Tamil), “Mrutyunjay” by Shivaji Sawant (Marathi), “Ek Bija Ne Gamta Rahiye” by Kaajal Oza Vaidya (Gujarati) and “Aarachar” by K R Meera (Malayalam). The selection will also include translations of globally popular titles like Rhonda Byrne’s “The Secret”, and Robin Sharma’s “The Monk who sold his Ferrari” and exclusive titles like Satya Vyas’s “Banaras Talkies”, Madhanand’s “Ki.Mu.Ki.Pi”, Kaajal Oza Vaidya’s “Draupadi”. \nReaders can access these books on Kindle eReaders as well as the free Kindle apps for Android and iOS. Kindle already supports languages like Chinese, German, French, and Japanese among others, apart from English. Another important addition which comes with this announcement is that Kindle e-book readers will now automatically see Indic keyboards based on the language of the book purchased. \nAmazon has signed an agreement to acquire the publishing business of Westland Ltd., a Trent Limited subsidiary and one of the leading publishing houses in India. \nAmit Agarwal, Vice President and Country Manager at Amazon India said, \nIn just three years we have built India’s largest online store that customers can trust to find, discover and buy anything online. Our acquisition of Westland continues our commitment to India — enabling Amazon to bring Westland’s highly talented authors and their books to even more customers in India and around the world,”“Since investing in Westland earlier this year, we have built a great relationship with the company and its authors. With this acquisition, we are very excited to take our relationship with Westland to the next level.

      "text": "One slide shows why no one can catch Amazon's cloud (AMZN) Published by Business Insider on Thu, 01 Dec 2016 No matter how you measure it, Amazon's cloud is huge and still growing at an unbelievable rate.Amazon Web Services CEO Andy Jassy said on Wednesday that AWS was on track to do $13 billion in revenue this year and it's still growing at 50% over 2015.Whereas Amazon was once the bastion of startups who tended to use it until they were big enough to launch their own data centers, an astounding number of enterprises are now choosing to move their apps and data to Amazon and shut down some, or all, of their data centers.Amazon says it now has more than 1 million active customers including some of the biggest companies in the world.Amazon is now adding more servers to its cloud on a daily basis than it took to power all of AWS in 2003, Jassy said.As we previously reported, when Motorola opted to move everything to the cloud, the IT folks looked at Amazon, Microsoft, and Google and concludedthat \"Amazon had better technologies in almost all areas. Itis much more mature in terms of functionality,\" according to Leo Wang, head of cloud computing.But here's an interesting tidbit that should have competitors even more worried. As Amazon adds more customers and each one asks it to add new features, AWS is actuallyaccelerating in adding stuff to its cloud.In 2015, it added 750 new features, nearly 3 times as many as it had added in 2013. In 2016, it has so far added 1,000, or three new features every day.The company is now such the 800-pound gorilla in the market that one of its original huge competitors, VMware, threw in the towel earlier this year and signed on to help sell AWS and make its data center software workbetter with the cloud.And it's even winning contracts from the big cloud companies themselves. Earlier this year, Salesforce reversed course on its chummy relationship with Microsoft Azure. (In 2014, Salesforce moved its ExactTarget business unit to Azure.) In May, Salesforce chose Amazon as its \"preferred cloud partner.\" That meansit will use AWS to be its international data centerin countries where Salesforce does not yet have its own data center for its biggest apps, including its flagship customer relationship management apps. That's a deal worth $400 million over four years to Amazon, the Wall Street Journal reported.On Wednesday, Amazon announced another, similar partnership with cloud HR software provider Workday, where Workday will use Amazon's international data centers as well (starting with Canada).In a dig at Salesforce's and Workday's mutual rival, Oracle, Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff even tweeted about the partnership.Congrats @aneelb @Workday @awscloud pic.twitter.com/PtMjJxyyOz' Marc Benioff (@Benioff) November 30, 2016SEE ALSO:How Amazon snatched huge customer Motorola away from MicrosoftSEE ALSO:This 'Snowmobile' truck seems like a joke, but it's actually Amazon's new productJoin the conversation about this storyNOW WATCH: This hidden iPhone feature will boost your reception",

      "title": "Be Warned: How Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Google Could Use Technology to Control the World",
      "text": "Advertisement \nI'm a huge fan of technology . \nTechnology enables us to communicate with people all over the world in an instant. It helps us to learn at unprecedented scale and speed. And it helps solve serious problems that have plagued mankind for centuries, if not longer. \nBut technology is a two-edged sword. And I'm not referring to its power to destroy. (At least, not this time.) \nI'm talking about the power technology brings to manipulate. \nTwo renowned professors of law, Maurice E. Stucke   Tennessee and Ariel Ezrachi   Oxford, recently penned a thoughtful essay for Wired , entitled: The Subtle Ways Your Digital Assistant Might Manipulate You. In it, they argue that we are granting unparalleled control to the companies behind the technology we value most in our day-to-day lives. \nFor example, the authors cite a 2012 Facebook study in which users' news feeds were manipulated \"to examine how people transmit positive and negative emotions to others.\" When Facebook reduced positive content in a user's News Feed, that person's status updates also tended to be less positive. When Facebook reduced negative content, the updates followed suit. \nThe interesting thing is when this experiment came to light, many were outraged. The media unleashed a wave of fury--similar to what we're hearing now with respects to the problems of fake news and hidden influence. Many swore they were quitting Facebook. \nBut what's happened since then? \nUse of the platform grew. Facebook currently has ca. 1.79 billion active users --almost a quarter of the world's population. \nThat's a lot of power for one company. \nThe potential for manipulation will increase dramatically in the near future with the rise of the digital assistant, or butler (as referred to by the authors). Apple, Amazon, Facebook, and Alphabet (Google) each have a digital assistant (Apple's Siri, Amazon's Alexa and Echo, Facebook's M, and Google's Assistant and Home), and each is vying to \"become our head butler.\" These assistants already answer questions, dim lights and adjust thermostats for millions. As they learn users' preferences, they even make dinner or entertainment suggestions. \n\"And yet,\" state the authors, \"despite the promise of digital assistants, they also carry significant social, political, and economic concerns... The more we rely on our butler, the more data it collects on us, the more opportunities for the algorithms to learn, and the better the butler can predict our needs and identify relevant services.\" \n\"The more we use the butler, the more power it will have.\" \nStucke and Ezrachi envision a world where our digital butlers compliment and cajole us, encourage us to communicate, and even send personalized notes on our behalf--all of this potentially affecting our moods and those of our friends. \nIt won't stop there, though. \nThe authors continue: \n\"As the digital butler expands its role in our daily lives, it can alter our worldview...\"With two billion 'likes' a day and one billion comments,\" psychiatrist Dr. Eva Ritvo wrote in Psychology Today, \"Facebook stimulates the release of loads of dopamine as well as offering an effective cure to loneliness.\" Imagine the dopamine spike when your butler secures a personal record in the number of \"likes\" for a political message it suggested. Your friends won't know that your butler drafted the post. And none of us will know how that post might sway the public discourse in ways that benefit the super-platform.\" \nThis is important because the digital assistant is marketed as a butler for us . But in reality, the true master is the platform who controls it. In the end, it's far too easy for us to become pawns in a very dangerous, real-life game of chess. \nThere are a few ways to combat this influence. \nYou could, of course, simply avoid using these products. But as they increase in popularity, this decision will become more challenging. If you do use the product, it becomes increasingly important to sharpen your emotional intelligence --the ability to identify emotions, to recognize their powerful effect, and to use that information to inform and guide behavior. \nIn other words, learning how your emotions work, and how these technology platforms influence your emotions, you'll be better prepared to combat this influence . (I explore this in my forthcoming book, EQ, Applied, which illustrates just how EQ works--and doesn't work--in the real world.) \nNonetheless, the more reliant we become on these devices, the more powerful (and potentially dangerous) they become. \nWhich reminds me of a wise piece of advice an old mentor once gave me: \n\"Be careful with your time and person. \nExpose yourself to anything long enough, and you'll start to like it.\"  ",

      "text": "This Snowmobile truck seems like a joke, but it's actually Amazon's new product Published by Business Insider on Thu, 01 Dec 2016 On Wednesday, Amazon Web Services CEO Andy Jassy had a big finish to his hourslong keynote speech at the AWS customer conference in Las Vegas.He had someone drive a truck onto the stage, pulling out a giant container he called the Snowmobile.The audience laughed and cheered. It looked like a gag, but it wasn't.This is a real product from AWS, and easily the biggestif you're measuring in feetproduct announcement of the day.The story of the Snowmobile started a year ago.Now that every business, from startups to huge companies, is rushing to the cloud as fast as it can, AWS has turned its attention to a tricky problem: How do you physically get all of the data stored in a company's massive data center into Amazon's cloud'Last year, Amazon announced a solution it called Snowball, a handheld box about the size of a desktop PC. A company rents it from Amazon, stuffs it with a petabyte of data, and ships it back to Amazon to unload. A petabyte is 1 million gigabytes, and it used to be considered an insane amount of data. In this way, a company could transfer a petabyte per week into Amazon's cloud and eventually unplug its data center altogether if it wanted to.Jassy didn't think the Snowball would be much of a hit. He even \"chastised\" the Snowball team on stage for manufacturing too many of them.But he was wrongbig time. The team had to almost instantly \"go back and order 10 times the number of Snowballs we have,\" Jassy said. \"I can't believe how much data we've transferred with Snowball.\"It became such a big thing that IT folks started talking selfies with their Snowballs and sending them to Amazon.These days, there are companies that store so much more data they measure it in exabytes. An exabyte is 1 billion gigabytes.Using conventional means of transferring that data, \"it will take you 26 years to move an exabyte to the cloud,\" Jassy said.Enter the Snowmobile. \"With 10 Snowmobiles, it takes six months\" to move that data to the cloud, Jassy said.So for a company sitting on a mind-boggling amount of data, Amazon will drive a Snowmobile to its data center, load it up, and haul to back to Amazon.As for the popular Snowball, Amazon has upgraded it with more capacity and computing power because people have come up with all kinds of innovative things they want to do with it besides use it to ship data to AWS.Here's another view of the Snowmobile.SEE ALSO:Amazon's cloud boss Andy Jassy just slammed Larry Ellison and mocked his 'hand-waving and bombast'SEE ALSO:How Amazon snatched huge customer Motorola away from MicrosoftJoin the conversation about this storyNOW WATCH: Here's why some people have a tiny hole above their ears",

      "text": "According to a recent report by TechCrunch , an online publisher of technology industry news, Amazon.com Inc. ( AMZN - Free Report ) will start offering Frontier Communications Corporation ’s ( FTR - Free Report ) Internet service plans on its product site.\nIn Mar 2016, Amazon started selling cable TV behemoth Comcast Corp.’s ( CMCSA - Free Report ) Xfinity TV, Internet and landline services, ranging from pay-TV to broadband triple-play bundles, on its newly launched online ‘Amazon Cable Store’. It marked Amazon’s debut with respect to selling services from a pay-TV operator. Since the launch, there have been reports that Amazon is presently in talks to include Charter Communications Inc. ( CHTR - Free Report ) as well.\nToward this end, Amazon recently added Frontier Communications to ‘Amazon Cable Store’, which is now rebranded as ‘Amazon Internet | TV | Phone’.Frontier Communications is a leading regional telecommunication company in the U.S.and is way smaller a company in comparison to Charter Communications, with roughly 4.4 million broadband customers and 1.5 billion video subscribers.\nWhile Frontier Communications sells video, Internet and phone plans in 29 states, Amazon customers can only order Internet services from Frontier Communications. Amazon also helps customers order Double Play (TV and Internet) and Triple Play plans from Comcast.\nFrontier Communications’ services were made available to new customers on Amazon.com starting Nov 15. The terms of the deal have been kept under wraps.\nAmazon.com’s Offers\nThe Amazon online store offers customers a wide range of Internet plans and bundles from both Comcast Xfinity and Frontier Communications, ranging from starter plans for single device (10 Mbps+) to plans which support multiple devices (150 Mbps+).\nOn the product site, Frontier Communications’ 12 Mbps (for a single device), 24 Mbps (for 2–4 devices), 75 Mbps (for 4–6 devices) and 150 Mbps (for 6–8 devices) broadband plans are being offered along with similar Comcast Xfinity services.\nPrices for both Frontier Communications and Comcast’s products on Amazon.com can be compared to prices if ordered from the operators directly. Moreover, Amazon is presently offering some lucrative offers to its customers. If a Frontier Communications’ product is purchased, then the customer gets a $50 Amazon gift card and remains a customer for at least 45 days and those who order Comcast’s products will get a $100 Amazon gift card.\nWinding Up\nWe are impressed with Frontier Communications’ focus to rake in more profits through customer retention, market share gain, new product introductions, broadband expansion and improved sales and marketing initiatives.\nBoth Frontier Communications and Comcast have assured that their products prices offered on Amazon’s site are similar to the individual packages sold by operators. From the business perspective, both Frontier Communications and Comcast can benefit from their online partnerships with Amazon from where millions of customers shop every day. Amazon is not only the biggest online retailer but it also excels in customer services. For Amazon, it seems that the retailer may next look to reselling a broader array of bundles, apart from Internet or TV services.\nFRONTIER COMMUN Price\nFRONTIER COMMUN Price | FRONTIER COMMUN Quote:\nAMAZON.COM INC Price\nAMAZON.COM INC Price | AMAZON.COM INC Quote:\nBoth Frontier Communications and Amazon currently carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

      "title": "Seagate Introduces External Hard Drive That Automatically Backs Up To Amazon's Cloud",
      "text": "Seagate Introduces External Hard Drive That Automatically Backs Up To Amazon's Cloud Published by Slashdot on Thu, 01 Dec 2016 An anonymous reader quotes a report from The Verge: Seagate and Amazon have partnered up on a $99 1TB external hard drive that automatically backs up everything stored on it to the cloud. The Seagate Duet drive's contents are cloned to Amazon Drive, so you can be pretty confident that your important stuff will be safe. Getting set up with the cloud backup process requires plugging in the drive, signing in with your Amazon account -- and that's pretty much it, from the sounds of it. Drag and drop files over, and you'll be able to access them from the web or Amazon's Drive app on smartphones and tablets. If you're new to the Drive service, Seagate claims you'll get a year of unlimited storage just for buying the hard drive, which normally costs $59.99 annually. Amazon's listing for the Duet (the only way to buy it right now) confirms as much, but there's some fine print: Offer is U.S.-only; Not valid for current Amazon Drive Unlimited Storage paid subscription customers; You've got to redeem the promo code within two months of buying the hard drive if you want the year's worth of unlimited cloud storage; If you return the Duet, Amazon says it will likely reduce your 12 months of unlimited Drive storage down to three, which beats taking it away altogether, I guess.

Don't even hesitate, especially not at this price. Very different games despite them both involving network building and shares. Paris Connection is dramatically faster to teach and play. Being a Winsome game at heart the ridiculously simple ruleset and small number of choices per turn still offers a surprisingly interesting decision space for such a fast light game. It's fun to see how the groupthink evolves with repeated plays as folks grasp the various ways the game can play out. Thanks for the response. Purchased! Hope you enjoy it! Airlines Europe is one of my favorites and while I guess you are basically doing the same thing in both games -either placing pieces of one color on the board to increase its value, or attempting to acquire more interest in one of the colors- because of the fact that in PC all the colors are always available to everyone (until all used up) and the same pieces you are using to increase the value are also what you need to score for them (so the greater the value the less opportunity to score) it makes it a very different game, ime. Plus it's much faster and allows for one more player. I feel there's a lot more tension in PC than AE since I'm much more concerned about avoiding helping someone else out on my turn.",

      "text": "Amazon \nWe need more books like Thomas Foster’s Reading the Silver Screen . A book like this one helps to bridge gaps between academic study and general knowledge. In this case, however, it also offers an important corrective for academic study. \nYou may know Foster as the author of the successful How to Read Literature Like a Professor and its follow-up How to Read Novels Like a Professor . In a world where we may be less and likely to be required to take a humanities course in college, both titles serve an important function offering clear, practical advice to the everyday reader on how to approach literature as more than mere entertainment. \nReading the Silver Screen works in basically the same way, but it may be even more important than Foster’s previous books. After all, most of us have an intuitive sense that novels and poems demand some rigor, whether or not we know exactly how to approach them; in contrast, film is a subject we’re often encouraged to consume as “mere” entertainment. In fact, in the book’s preface Foster imagines a character, Dave, who sums up what most people feel about movies like Mad Max: Fury Road : “Art? I don’t think so. Art is those foreign guys. Bergman, Fellini, who’s that Japanese guy? Maybe Woody Allen. You know, dull stuff.” Foster steps in right away to correct Dave: “There is a misconception in the culture that if we study the works we read or watch or listen to, we will kill our ‘simple’ or ‘pure’ enjoyment. Seriously? Then why do all those music geeks tear into the meaning of songs by Pink Floyd or Tupac, or the Beatles or Pearl Jam […] Far from spoiling the fun, you’ll likely double or triple it” (xx). \nIt turns out the fictive Dave is an important figure in Reading the Silver Screen . We follow him throughout the book as his thinking about Mad Max deepens: “Well, this is not Max’s scene,” he comments some 100 pages in. “He’s gonna always be the outsider, but that’s okay with her in charge.” We are Dave, and as he begins to see past the surface of films so do we. \nFoster’s little narrative method is a smart bit of teaching in a book that’s filled with great teaching techniques. He takes us through an exhaustive list of film components, one at a time, laying them out separately so that we get a complete sense of how one works before moving on to another. He models the process of analysis, showing us how scenes and sequences work in The Bourne Identity and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid , or pointing out all the “variety of ways characters are impeded, excluded, caught, trapped” by the imagery in Casablanca . He does this not once or twice in a chapter, but over and over again, so that by the time we’ve followed him through his hundredth analysis, we’re able to make the moves for ourselves. \nHe also teaches us to think for ourselves, as when he teaches us the value of comparing and contrasting as a strategy for thinking about art, comparing the soundtrack of 2013’s The Great Gatsby with its predecessor from 1974. Finally, once he’s taken us through all of this material, he even offers us a chance to “Put it to the Test” by putting our own analysis of Argo —using all the tools we’ve learned—up against his. \nFoster simply knows how to teach, and by the end he’s taught the “Daves” among us how to read cinema. That’s an accomplishment in itself. But it turns out that academics can be equally as guilty as “Dave” of dismissing popular culture as “mere entertainment”. Foster’s previous books bring to bear the academic ideas and techniques of formalism (or new criticism) on reading literature. Formalism argued for seeing a literary work as a kind of machine, one made up of a number of potential “parts” that, when combined in different ways, create an experience, a meaning or a sensation. According to formalism, in order to understand how any given machine works, we must study the parts and their interactions closely, a process termed “close reading”. Formalism, and especially close reading, serve as the foundations of literary study, which makes them an excellent place to start teaching a non-academic audience how to read more “academically”. Yet as topics of study, these fields have been largely abandoned by academics in the last 50 years, as scholars have pushed into new fields, from psychological criticism, to reader-response criticism, to deconstruction, and cultural studies. All of these later approaches rely implicitly on close reading, and yet too often we as academics take this technique and the theory out of which it grew for granted (or worse yet, pretend it no longer has any real relevance). \nThat might be a workable situation for the study of traditional literature—poetry, drama, novels—since at this point most students of traditional literature simply absorb close reading techniques whether or not they’re formally taught how to use them. The trouble is, literature isn’t as “traditional” as it once was. As Foster himself notes in his preface, a whole host of “new” (leaving aside that some of these, like film, are over 125 years old now) media and multi-media artistic forms have sprung up in the form of popular music, video games, television, and film. \nAs Foster further argues, none of these “new” forms is quite like the old ones: “Movies are movies. They are not novels, biographies, short stories, dramatic plays, comedic plays, musical theater, epics, comic books, […] confessions, photography, painting, or holy texts” (xxvi). As the formalists argued about poetry, film “speaks its own language, which, like every language, obeys a grammar, or set of rules, that is particular to this language. We need to understand the rules of that language, the grammar of film, in order to fully decode the language and understand what movies do and how they do it” (xxvi). \nIn short, we need to establish some close reading strategies for these new media, to define terms the same way the new critics once defined metaphor and slant rhyme: so we can communicate effectively to others about what we “read”. Unfortunately, as these new forms came along, we in the academic world have jumped to talking about whether Jurassic World presents an outdated representation of women or what The Hunger Games may have to say about our collective political consciousness (both important questions, by the way) that we sometimes forget to stop and think about how these forms work, well, formally. \nFoster’s book reminds us of this missing link, but more importantly, it supplies this missing link. Perhaps, if we’re lucky, in a couple of more years we can look out for a work from him on reading video games.

      "title": "Cyber Monday 2016: Amazon, eBay & Walmart are the U.S. top retailers",
      "text": "German-English-Translator - Details here comScore today reported $29.7 billion has been spent online, marking a 12-percent increase versus the corresponding days last year in holiday season U.S. retail e-commerce spending from desktop computers for the first 28 days of the November-December 2016 holiday season. According to comScore Cyber Monday reached $2.67 billion in desktop online spending, up 17 percent versus 2015, representing the heaviest online spending day in history and only the second day ever (the other being Cyber Monday 2015) to surpass $2 billion in desktop sales. For the five-day period from Thanksgiving through Cyber Monday, online buying from desktop computers totaled $8.41 billion, up 17 percent versus last year. comScore says that 130 million Americans visited online retail properties on Cyber Monday using a desktop computer, smartphone or tablet, representing just over half of the total digital population. Amazon once again ranked as the most visited online retail property on Cyber Monday, followed by eBay, Walmart, Kohl's and Target. comScore CEO Gian Fulgoni: \"Cyber Monday had yet another outstanding day of online spending with $2.67 billion in sales from desktop computers to once again rank as the heaviest online spending day of all-time. The day remains the most important online shopping day of the year, driving an enormous amount of online retail traffic on both desktop and mobile devices. As we've come to expect, Amazon once again led all online retail properties in Cyber Monday traffic, but several multi-channel retailers such as Walmart, Kohl's and Target also had very impressive showings.\" Other recent holiday highlights include: Apparel & Accessories ranked as the top product category on Cyber Monday with more than $600 million in desktop sales, followed by Consumer Electronics and Computer Hardware, respectively. In addition to its huge sales total, Apparel & Accessories was also the fastest-growing category year-over-year on Cyber Monday, followed by Sport & Fitness and Consumer Electronics, respectively. The 130 million people who visited online retail sites on Cyber Monday edged out Black Friday by 14 million visitors. 78 million arrived via desktop and 89 million via mobile (with 37 million on both). Households making $100,000+ in annual income accounted for 44 percent of buyers and 48 percent of desktop spending on Cyber Monday, each several percentage points above what was seen on Black Friday. The holiday week ending Sunday, November 27 maintained its 70-plus percent share of desktop e-commerce dollars coming via transactions using free shipping. There have been 13 billion-dollar spending days on desktop through Cyber Monday this year, while last year at this point in the season only the five days from Thanksgiving through Cyber Monday had reached that threshold.

Today, half of all U.S. households are subscribed to the membership program Amazon Prime, half of all online shopping searches start directly on Amazon, and Amazon captures nearly one in every two dollars that Americans spend online. Amazon sells more books, toys, and by next year, apparel and consumer electronics than any retailer online or off, and is investing heavily in its grocery business. \nAs a retailer, its market power now rivals or exceeds that of Walmart, and it stands only to grow: Within five years, one-fifth of the U.S.’s $3.6 trillion retail market will have shifted online, and Amazon is on track to capture two-thirds of that share. \nAnd the numbers grow with every new product and sales event. \nBlack Friday weekend was Amazon’s best-ever , according to the company. \nAmazon device sales were up more than two times over last year and sales of Echo products increased sevenfold on Cyber Monday over last year.

      "text": "AWS isn't the cheapskate's cloud, and Amazon doesn't care AWS isn't winning because it's cheapest. It's winning because of innovation. By Matt Asay | December 1, 2016, 4:14 AM PST Google Plus \nImage: CNET \nIn case you're wondering, AWS likely isn't your cheapest public cloud option. That honor goes to Google in most scenarios, as ZDNet's Larry Dignan has spotlighted . But also in case you're wondering, it doesn't matter. \"Cheap!\" isn't a winning strategy Must-Read Cloud Subscribe to TechRepublic's Cloud Insights newsletter \nOh, sure. No one wants to get gouged on pricing. Everyone wants a deal. But cost isn't the primary driver of public cloud computing adoption. It never has been. \nInstead, enterprises have flocked to the public cloud, and to AWS in particular, because it unshackles them from the rigid constraints of data center investments. In short, because it's convenient and affords dramatic improvements in business agility. \nGoogle originally focused on price . It didn't work. With few exceptions, as Seth Godin explained , \"Low price is the refuge for the marketer who doesn't have anything more meaningful to offer,\" and the developers who have carried their enterprises into Amazon's cloud haven't done so to pinch pennies. So over the past year it has pursued a strategy of opening up access to the riches of its internal tech ( like Spanner ), which has borne more fruit. \nSEE: Cloud compute pricing bakeoff: Google vs. AWS vs. Microsoft Azure (ZDNet) \nAnd yet RightScale wants us to focus on price and calls out that most of the time, AWS won't be the low-cost price leader. Even taking this and other RightScale data into account, Dignan correctly concluded , \"AWS won't be the cheapest alternative in many scenarios. Then again—AWS has a bigger menu, more advanced cloud services, and the customer base where it doesn't have to go crazy on pricing. AWS just has to be fair.\" Innovation isn't free \nFair and... innovative. AWS has introduced new functionality at an ever-increasing pace , a pace that Workday CEO Aneel Bhusri has described as \"stunning.\" But that's somewhat secondary to the real AWS innovation that matters: what it does to the businesses that use it. \nAs Adrian Cockroft (former cloud architect at Netflix, now at AWS) has noted , \"There is an existential threat... that if you're doing quarterly releases and your competitor is doing daily releases and continuous delivery, you're going to fall so far behind in the user experience that you're going to suffer.\" While Cockroft was not discussing AWS or the cloud, specifically, it's precisely the freedom from infrastructure that makes it possible to follow his flexible development mantra. \nSEE: Amazon still crushing cloud competition, says Gartner Magic Quadrant for IaaS (TechRepublic) \nAWS product strategy chief Matt Wood helped elaborate on why this is so in an interview with TechRepublic: Those that go out and buy expensive infrastructure find that the problem scope and domain shift really quickly. By the time they get around to answering the original question, the business has moved on. You need an environment that is flexible and allows you to quickly respond to changing big data requirements. Your resource mix is continually evolving—if you buy infrastructure, it's almost immediately irrelevant to your business because it's frozen in time. It's solving a problem you may not have or care about any more. \nOf course, part of that cloudy business agility isn't baked into AWS itself but rather derives from its expansive partner network. As McDonalds declared from the AWS re:Invent main stage this week, one of the things that facilitated the quick serve restaurant giant moving to the cloud is that all its partners are happy to work on AWS. \nAll of which means that AWS can keep relentlessly lowering prices without ever bothering to be the cheapest public cloud. It simply needs to offer more innovation and a broader partner ecosystem to win... and charge a premium in the process. Impress your friends with your cloudy knowledge.

Full Bio The author is a Forbes contributor. The opinions expressed are those of the writer. Loading ... Loading ... This story appears in the {{article.article.magazine.pretty_date}} issue of {{article.article.magazine.pubName}}. Subscribe \nIn August, Amazon announced a plan that could potentially revolutionize the traditional workday and corporate America’s approach to work-life balance. \nThe perennial experimental tech giant will pilot a program offering a 30-hour work week to a small group of its thousands of employees. The participants will receive full benefits but 75% of their full-time pay. Their core hours will be 10 a.m. to 2 p.m., Monday through Thursday, with additional flex hours, and they can transition to full-time if they choose. \n“We want to create a work environment that is tailored to a reduced schedule and still fosters success and career growth,” the company stated in an Eventbrite announcement . “This initiative was created with Amazon’s diverse workforce in mind, and the realization that the traditional full-time schedule may not be a ‘one size fits all’ model.” Forbes Agency Council is an invitation-only community for executives in successful public relations, media strategy, creative and advertising agencies. Do I qualify? \nWorkplace Innovation Or Damage Control? \nProponents of the program are calling it a step forward in fostering a more diverse workforce and opening the conversation about helping employees maintain a healthy work-life balance. Cynics are calling it a ploy to minimize the fallout from a 2015 New York Times piece that painted a grim picture of Amazon’s hard-driving work culture. \nEither way, it’s a bold move for an innovative company known for its big thinking (delivery by drone , anyone?) and generally disrupting the status quo. And it could reflect a broader shift in employers’ understanding of what their employees truly value (spoiler alert: it doesn’t always boil down to extra dollars in their paychecks). ",

      "text": "Last week, Amazon announced new partnerships for their Dash Replenishment program, which automatically orders household supplies such as laundry detergent or paper towels when a home owner is running low, says Nick Lavars for New Atlas. The technology allows devices to monitor their own supply levels and automatically order more stock without the homeowner having to even think about it.\nOne such device is GeniCan , which is a connected device that mounts on the user's garbage can and scans bar codes of items as they are thrown out, or failing that, allows users to add them through a microphone and voice recognition. With a Wi-Fi connection, GeniCan can add scanned items to a user's shopping list, and now with Dash Replenishment integration, can re-order those items automatically.\nOther device-makers to join the program today are Honeywell, whose connected thermostats can now order replacement air filters and Nestle, whose Wi-Fi-enabled BabyNes machine can now order replacement baby formula capsules. Amazon also announced a couple of new devices from existing Dash Replenishment members. Available from next month, the Whirlpool Smart Dishwasher will orders its own detergent and PUR's Faucet Filtration System, available from today, will order its own replacement water filters.\nRead more >",

      "text": "The great cord-cutting revolution continues today with the news that HBO and Cinemax are now available to Amazon Prime subscribers for $14.99 and $9.99 per month respectively.\nThe news comes almost a year after Amazon Video opened to third-party video-streaming services , letting those on the company’s $99 annual Prime member service subscribe to the likes of Starz and Showtime all from within a single platform. Adding HBO and Cinemax to the mix is a major scoop, and serves as one more incentive for people to sign-up for a Prime plan that already includes free deliveries on goods, a Netflix-esque video-streaming service, among other perks. There are now somewhere in the region of 80 third-party channel subscriptions available through Amazon Channels.\nBoth new channels are available free for 30 days as part of the launch promotion, after which their respective monthly fees kick-in to effect.\nThe partnerships make sense for both Amazon, viewers, and the providers, as it alleviates so-called “subscription fatigue,” removes the need for multiple login credentials, and re-bundles only the specific channels desired by viewers, with no long-term contracts. It also lets subscribers create a single watchlist for programming across all their subscriptions, and view them within the one Amazon Video app.\n",

      "text": "Amazon's Snowmobile truck can haul 100 petabytes of customer data to the cloud It takes 10 days to fill with data on Dec 1, 2016, 6:15 AM TechSpot \nWhen it comes to cloud computing, Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the undisputed market leader. But for those customers that need to transfer petabytes or exabytes of data, the process can take years or even decades. Now, Amazon has come up with a solution for moving truckloads of information: an actual truck. \nThe Snowmobile can store up to 100 PB of data, allowing organizations to \"move exabytes\" of information to AWS within a timeframe measured in weeks rather than years. The truck follows the 80 TB AWS Snowball device Amazon introduced last year, which, while capable of transferring 1 PB per week to AWS, may not be sufficient for customers with large-scale on-premise storage. \nAmazon introduced the Snowmobile at its annual re:Invent user conference in Las Vegas yesterday. The 45-foot long, 9.6-foot high, 8-foot long wide container is climate-controlled and waterproof, meaning it can be parked in covered or uncovered locations. It consumes about 350 kW of power, and Amazon says it will arrange for a generator if a customer requires one. \nThe Snowmobile can back up data at speeds of up to 1 Tb/s spread across multiple 40 Gb/s fiber connections. Firms with networks able to transfer data at that rate will be able to fill the truck in about 10 days, at which point it will be transported to an Amazon endpoint where the data is uploaded. AWS will provide security while the Snowmobile is on site, as well as an escort during transit. Customer data is encrypted, of course, and the container provides GPS tracking. \nCompany chief executive Andy Jassy said that sending an exabyte of data to an AWS center at a rate of 10 Gb/s would take 26 years, but using ten Snowmobiles would take six months. \nThe Snowmobile is aimed at customers in the scientific, media, and financial industries that may need to move large swathes of information. It attaches to a network as a local, NFS volume, and customers can use their existing backup and archiving tools to fill it with data, which will be stored using Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) or Amazon Glacier . \nThere’s no official price on how much a AWS Snowmobile will cost; Amazon said it would work with interested customers to ensure it “is both faster and less expensive than using a network-based data transfer model.” Related Reads",

      "title": "Amazon's Snowmobile Transports 100PB of Data Using a Truck",
      "text": "Amazon's Snowmobile Transports 100PB of Data Using a Truck Updated 0 \nAmazon Web Services (AWS) is a cloud computing service all of us have likely used at one point or another. It's a massive cloud infrastructure that even Netflix relies on to function. Using AWS is as easy as setting up an account and transferring your data on to its servers, but there are companies and organizations out there who have petabytes or even exabytes (1 exabyte = 1 million terabytes) of data they may want to transfer, with no realistic way of doing so. Examples include scientific data collections, satellite imagery, movie vaults, or financial records. \nAmazon went part way to solving this issue last year when it introduced a data transfer appliance called AWS Snowball, which looks like a large desktop PC. Each Snowball can hold 80TB of data, which Amazon then ships back to a data center and uploads to AWS. However, 80TB at a time is too small when talking about petabytes of data, so Amazon had to think bigger. \nThis week, Amazon unveiled AWS Snowmobile. It's a shipping container measuring 9.6 by 8 by 45 feet, and is capable of storing 100 petabytes of data. The container hooks up to a customer's network and appears as a local storage volume that files can be transferred to in encrypted form. \nOnce full, the container is locked down to form a waterproof, climate-controlled storage locker that is GPS tracked and under video surveillance. Amazon even provides a security vehicle escort and dedicated security guards if required. \n100 petabytes is a lot of data. The Snowmobile can handle transfers at a rate of up to 1Tb/second, but even so, it will take a minimum of 10 days to fill. However, it still works out to be much faster and more cost effective than transferring the same amount of data over the Internet.The example Amazon gives is moving an exabyte of data using a 10Gbps dedicated connection. It would take 26 years, where as Snowmobile deliveries will achieve the same transfer in six months. \nPricing has yet to be confirmed, but Amazon states it will be a \"less expensive\" way of performing data transfers at this scale. Get news headlines sent daily   \nFor now, Amazon is offering AWS Snowmobile in all its data center regions for transferring data on to AWS servers. However, it is also looking into allowing data exports using Snowmobile, which some customers are already requesting. \nThis article originally appeared on PCMag.com . Tags",

      "text": "NASA You’ve got questions and Alexa’s got answers. Now, in addition to news about the weather, traffic, football scores, and other earthly information Amazon’s smart assistant can offer, she will also start educating you on … grander topics. Specifically, those concerned with Mars. It’s all thanks to NASA, which announced at the AWS re:Invent conference in Las Vegas that it had added its own skill to the popular artificial intelligence-based assistant , marking the first time the space agency collaborated with Alexa.\nTom Soderstrom, the chief technology officer at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory , unveiled Alexa’s newest skill, noting the impetus behind the decision was to spark further interest in Mars. Of course, it would seem that there is interest aplenty already — after all, Elon Musk is trying to colonize the Red Planet, which no longer seems like as far fetched of a dream as it might have just a few years ago.\n“Tomorrow you’ll be able to use Amazon Dots and your Amazon Echos, and you can ask questions about Mars,” Soderstrom said Tuesday. “This is all about exploring and getting crowdsourcing and getting people to understand and care about Mars and ask new questions.”\nMore :  NASA wants SpaceX to help it survey the Earth’s water surface \nWhile Alexa already has some basic knowledge about Mars (thanks, Google), the NASA skill certainly broadens (and deepens) its knowledge base. Once users have enabled the NASA Mars skill, they can make requests like, “Alexa, open NASA Mars,” or, “Alexa, ask NASA Mars: Why is Mars red?”\nBut that is not all NASA has in the works when it comes to Alexa. Soderstrom suggested that ROV-E, a smaller version of NASA’s exploration rover whose blueprints will be made widely accessible to schools and museums, will also be controllable by way of Alexa commands and capable of answering your most probing questions about one of our nearest celestial neighbors.\nSo get curious — there has never been a better time to have questions about the universe.\nWhat can’t she do? The best ways to use Amazon’s Alexa around the house Here’s what happened when we asked Amazon’s Alexa and Google Home a bunch of questions As billionaires ogle Mars, the space race is back on",

      "text": "Andrew Husband HBO/Amazon \nBetween Taylor Swift’s announced television channel and Netflix’s decision to finally allow subscribers to download and watch some programming while offline , cord-cutters are finding their market saturated with options. Such is the case for Amazon Prime users who, for a little extra money per month, can add premium cable channels and other streaming networks to their “Amazon Channels” feature. Now users who require regular doses of shows like Westworld and The Knick can watch both (and more) since HBO and Cinemax have entered the fray. \nAccording to a press release, Amazon Prime subscribers can now add HBO and Cinemax to their Amazon Channels selection for an additional $14.99 or $9.99 per month respectively. Each add-on includes access to original programming, as well as the many recent and popular films each channel currently possesses the exclusive television rights to broadcast. \n“HBO has produced some of the most groundbreaking, beloved and award-winning shows in television history. Their selection of blockbuster movies is unsurpassed, including hits like Batman vs. Superman , The Revenant , and Deadpool ,” Amazon Digital Video vice president Michael Paull said in a statement. “Prime members can now watch the latest episodes of the critically-acclaimed Westworld and Game of Thrones without the need for a cable subscription.” \nPrevious premium channels made available to Amazon Prime users include Showtime and Starz, as well as streaming-only services like NBC’s comedy-centric SeeSo and other fare. With the addition of HBO and Cinemax, over 80 video subscriptions are now available for subscribers to add as they see fit — thereby reducing the need for paid cable at home. Whether or not the new ease of access will help Westworld fans understand what the hell is going on , however, remains to be seen. Share This",

      "text": "Amazon Is Launching an Accelerator for Conversational AI The 13-week course, aimed at startups developing conversational AI, is Amazon's first foray into accelerator programs.   \nAmazon is partnering up with Techstars to launch an Alexa Accelerator for companies developing conversational artificial intelligence . \nStarting in January 2017, early-stage companies working on speech technology or voice applications in any industry--including, but not limited to automobiles, health, communications, wearables and connected home--can apply for the 13-week program, and a chance to win $120,000. \n10 to 12 startups will have a spot in the program, and live at the University of Washington beginning in July 2017. Participants will each receive a total of $20,000, and will have a chance to work with Amazon and Techstars mentors to develop strategies that will help further their business. A demo day will be held in October during which companies will share their product with investors, a select few will win an additional $100,000 at the conclusion of the program. \nThe online retail giant has already invested in 22 AI companies through its $100 million Alexa Fund, but this new accelerator will allow Amazon to cement its expertise in the space and get in on the ground floor with entrepreneurs. In the coming months, Amazon and Techstars will be hosting informational sessions in cities in the U.S. and abroad.  ",
