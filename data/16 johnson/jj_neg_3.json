      "text": "By Austen Hufford\nSwiss biopharmaceutical company Actelion Ltd. said Friday that it had been approached by Johnson & Johnson about a possible deal.\nAs of Wednesday's close, Actelion had a market value of about 16.7 billion Swiss francs ($16.4 billion). With a typical takeover premium of 25% or more, a deal for the company would be valued at more than $20 billion. Johnson & Johnson's market value is more than $300 billion.\nShares of Actelion rose 16% to 182.40 Swiss francs on the SIX Swiss Exchange.\nJ&J confirmed Friday that it is in \"preliminary discussions\" with Actelion. It isn't clear where talks between the companies stand or whether Actelion is receptive.\nActelion makes drugs for rare diseases, with a focus on pulmonary arterial hypertension, or PAH, a type of high blood pressure that affects arteries in the lungs and in the heart.\nActelion was founded in 1997 by Jean-Paul Clozel and other former Roche Holding Ltd. employees who left the Swiss drug giant after it decided not to pursue a project their group was working on, according to its website. In 2000, Actelion went public and its valuation has climbed sharply since then.\nLast year, the company reported revenue of 2.05 billion francs and a profit of 551.9 million francs.\nJohnson & Johnson, based in New Brunswick, N.J., makes an array of products from baby soap to Tylenol pills and devices that manage diabetes care.\nThe company has been acquisitive as of late. In September, it reached a deal to buy Abbott Laboratories' eye-surgery equipment business for $4.3 billion.\nBloomberg had reported Thursday that J&J had made an initial bid for the specialty drug company.\nShares of J&J rose 0.7% to $113.91 in morning trading in the U.S.\nWrite to Austen Hufford at austen.hufford@wsj.com\n 12:18 ET (17:18 GMT)\n ",

      "text": "By Paul Arnold and Ludwig Burger\nZURICH/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - U.S. healthcare company Johnson & Johnson said on Friday it was in preliminary talks with Actelion about a potential takeover of Europe's largest biotech firm, currently valued at about $20 billion.\nLung disease specialist Actelion confirmed it had been approached and said there was no certainty a deal would occur.\nAn acquisition of the Swiss company would boosts J&J's drug pipeline and diversify its prospects. J&J's biggest product, the arthritis drug Remicade, faces cheaper competition from Pfizer Inc .\nActelion shares surged nearly 19 percent to a peak of 187.70 Swiss francs on Friday, valuing the company at around $20 billion. They closed up 16.8 percent at 184.50 Swiss francs, more than matching the stock's total gains this year up to Thursday's close.\nThe company's focus on rare diseases makes it an attractive takeover target because drugs in that area are less prone to pricing pressure.\nAnalysts at Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Bryan Garnier said a bid for Actelion could be worth up to 220 Swiss francs ($217) or 250 Swiss francs ($246) per share, respectively, stoked by appetite in the industry for fast-growing businesses.\nActelion's Opsumit and Uptravi drugs to treat the life-threatening condition of high pressure in blood vessels to the lungs will generate more than $4.6 billion in combined 2020 sales, analysts forecast, up from an estimated $1.4 billion this year.\nJ&J's shares finished up nearly 1 percent at $114.13.\nJ&J's chief executive, Alex Gorsky, said earlier this year that the company was interested in deals to expand its main consumer, medical device and pharmaceuticals segments. In September, J&J agreed to buy Abbott Laboratories' eye care business for about $4.33 billion in cash.\nActelion has long been seen as a takeover target. However, Actelion co-founder and Chief Executive Jean-Paul Clozel, who holds a 3.5 percent stake in the company, has repeatedly said he wants it to remain independent.\nIn 2011, Clozel rallied shareholders against activist investor Elliott Management's campaign to put the biotech firm up for sale. Actelion's shares have more than tripled since then.\nThere may be broader interest from other suitors in Actelion, according to an investment banker who did not want to be named, who added that a competing bid could come \"most likely\" from larger Swiss peer Novartis AG .\nAnother source close to Novartis, however, said the company was not very impressed by Actelion's drug pipeline.\nA spokesman from Novartis declined to comment.\n(Additional reporting by Pamela Barbaglia and Anjuli Davies in London and Michael Shields and John Miller in Zurich and Liana B.

      "text": "Pin it Share LONDON (Reuters) - A costly blood cancer pill sold in Europe by Johnson & Johnson will be made routinely available to certain patients in Britain with chronic lymphocytic leukemia, after the U.S. company agreed to cut the price. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) said on Friday the discount offered by J&J meant it could now recommend Imbruvica as offering value for money to the state-run health service. The move comes as NICE reappraises all drugs covered by the Cancer Drugs Fund (CDF), which was overhauled earlier this year. Other companies including Novartis, Pfizer, Bristol-Myers Squibb and Eisai have also offered discounts to ensure drugs previously covered by the CDF are used routinely on the National Health Service (NHS). The list price for a year's supply of Imbruvica is more than 55,000 pounds ($68,000) per patient. The size of the NHS discount is being kept confidential.

Actelion and J&J confirmed the approach in separate statements Friday, saying it’s not certain that a deal will happen. Actelion is working with an adviser to explore options, and the deliberations are still at an early stage following J&J’s initial offer, according to people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be identified because the talks are private. The company may also attract other suitors, such as Novartis AG and Sanofi, separate people with knowledge of the matter said.",

      "title": "J&J (JNJ) Confirms it Approached Actelion for Possible Deal - November 28, 2016 - Zacks.com",
      "text": "Trades from $ 3 Johnson & Johnson ( JNJ - Free Report ) ) confirmed that it approached Swiss biotechnology company, Actelion Ltd. ( ALIOF - Free Report ) , with a takeover offer. J&J stated in a press release that it is “engaged in preliminary discussions” with Actelion regarding a possible transaction. However, both J&J and Actelion warned that there is no certainty that the discussions will culminate into any transaction. J&J said it will make additional comments on the topic only when a formal agreement is reached or when it is appropriate to do so. Actelion’s shares surged nearly 20% on Friday, while J&J’s shares rose 1% on the news. In fact, while the Zacks classified Drugs industry declined 15.8% over the past one-year period, the stock of J&J’s climbed 12.7% while that of Actelion shot up almost 32%. Last week, Bloomberg reported that the companies were holding initial talks. (Read More: J&J Reportedly Approaches Actelion for Acquisition ). Actelion is a leader in the pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) market with key drugs like Opsumit, Tracleer, Ventavis, Veletri and Uptravi. The newer drugs – Opsumit and Uptravi –have been well received and are poised to become blockbuster drugs. These should make up for the lost revenues from Actelion’s older PAH medicine, Tracleer, which is facing competitive pressure. Tracleer lost patent protection in the U.S. last year and will also lose exclusivity in the EU in early 2017. Sales of Tracleer declined 18% in constant exchange rates in the first nine months of 2016, while that of Opsumit surged 63%. Uptravi, which was launched earlier this year, recorded sales of CHF 160 million in the first nine months of 2016. Actelion’s strong sales performance enabled it to increase its 2016 guidance. A deal with Actelion will diversify J&J’s revenues and can pull up its top line as its largest product, the arthritis drug Remicade (partner: Merck & Co., Inc. ( MRK - Free Report ) , is facing biosimilar competition in EU. Also, Pfizer, Inc. ( PFE - Free Report ) will soon launch a biosimilar version of Remicade in the U.S. On the third-quarter conference call, when asked about its acquisition plans, J&J mentioned that as far as pharmaceuticals are concerned, it will most likely use an “acquisition type” strategy instead of a licensing strategy if it decides to add another major therapeutic area to its existing five major therapeutic areas. J&J also said it has specific areas of focus in the Consumer segment, mainly international growth in emerging markets, over-the-counter medications and the beauty space in Asia. Within the Medical Devices segment, J&J continues to look for bolt-on acquisitions in orthopedics and general surgery. Although certain areas like structural heart look attractive in the cardiovascular segment, the company was pretty clear about being disciplined from a valuation aspect. While J&J has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), Actelion has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). \nJOHNSON & JOHNS Price and Consensus \n\nYou can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here .

      "text": "REUTERS/Stefan Wermuth \nZURICH (Reuters) - Actelion Chief Executive Jean-Paul Clozel's desire to keep Europe's biggest biotech company independent after building it from scratch, means Johnson & Johnson will have to pay a steep premium if a takeover is to succeed.\nThe U.S. healthcare titan on Friday confirmed talks with the Swiss maker of medicines for deadly pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). While Actelion confirmed the courtship, it said there was no guarantee of a deal.\nActelion's rare-disease focus makes it an attractive target, since its drugs face less price pressure than other more widely used medicines.\nAnalysts estimate a deal could be as high as 250 Swiss francs ($247) per share, valuing Actelion at around $26 billion, or $6 billion more than its current price even after the share's 17 percent surge on Friday.\nHaving fended off reported approaches by Shire in 2015 and hedge fund Elliott Advisors in 2011, Clozel, a French-born cardiologist, has repeatedly asserted his desire to go it alone, with his three main PAH drugs and with pipeline medicines he hopes will create a broad-based biotech company.\nThis hard-to-get approach, coupled with the high value of recent deals in the sector, will drive up Actelion's takeover price, analysts said.\n\"Similar deals have been at a 40-plus percent premium and we view 240 Swiss francs as a possible floor takeout value,\" Jefferies analyst Peter Welford said.\nAnalysts at Bryan Garnier suggested a bid price of up to 250 francs.\nIn another recent biotech takeover, Pfizer paid $14 billion for cancer specialist Medivation, or double its pre-deal value. Switzerland's Roche in 2014 paid $8.3 billion for InterMune, a 63 percent premium.\nClozel and his pediatrician-wife, Martine Clozel, Actelion's chief science officer, own 5 percent of the company they founded in 1997. Close ties with Actelion's Swiss shareholder base suggest they can mobilize support, should an offer not live up to their expectations, Welford said.\nIf J&J fails to strike a deal, a rival like Sanofi could well step in, analysts said. Actelion's PAH portfolio is a potentially nice fit for the French drugmaker's Genzyme rare disease unit.\nSanofi, which lost out to Pfizer in the battle for Medivation, has said it is still looking for deals.\nA spokesman for Sanofi declined to comment on the company's possible interest in Actelion.\nNew drugs While the patent for Actelion's PAH blockbuster Tracleer expired last year, Clozel's two newer PAH drugs, Opsumit and Uptravi, are expected to take up the slack.\nOpsumit's annual sales are set to hit 1.9 billion francs by 2020, according to Reuters data. Uptravi sales could top 2.5 billion francs.\nClozel plans to use the cash to fund his late-stage pipeline, which includes medicines for treating diarrhea-causing clostridium difficile, as well as the multiple sclerosis drug ponesimod.\nStefan Schneider, a Bank Vontobel analyst in Zurich, doubts a deal will go through and said any sign that a potential buyer will tinker with Clozel's prized pipeline to cut costs could be a deal killer.\n\"We don't see how the CEO would part from the pipeline where he sees the value for Actelion to transform into the first European large-cap biotech company,\" Schneider said.\nActelion's shares have risen six-fold to nearly 190 francs since the start of 2012, just after Elliott tried to wrest control - on the grounds the company's stock should fetch 70 francs.\nAs retirement edges closer, analysts said it is possible Clozel is more receptive to handing over the reins, especially if a buyer agrees to retain Actelion's presence in Basel where the company, however successful, still plays second fiddle to giants Roche and Novartis.\n\"Actelion's shares have risen 400 percent based on the strength of the PAH portfolio alone,\" Zuercher Kantonalbank analyst Michael Nawrath said.\n\"Even when Clozel has always made the case for independence, it's possible a stock price at its zenith, combined with his 61 years, could prompt a change of heart.\"\n($1 = 1.0139 Swiss francs) \n(Editing by Ben Hirschler and Susan Fenton)\nNOW WATCH: The 3 worst things you do when you wash your face — according to a dermatologist \n",

      "title": "approaches $20B-valued Actelion about takeover deal",
      "text": "Actelion has confirmed Johnson & Johnson approached it about a possible acquisition. The news sent Actelion’s market cap up toward $20 billion as expectations that the perennial takeover target could finally accept a buyout bid rose.\nBuying Actelion would give J&J two drugs that are expected to start racking up blockbuster sales in the coming years. The products, pulmonary arterial hypertension drugs Opsumit and Uptravi, have both made solid starts to commercial life, cementing expectations that their annual sales will top out at approximately $2 billion. That would give J&J a ready-made source of revenues at a time when it is looking to M&A to offset the forecast effect of biosimilars on its blockbuster Remicade.\nActelion also has a clutch of late-phase pipeline prospects. A phase 3 trial of the antibiotic cadazolid in patients with Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea is due to report data early next year. The Swiss drugmaker is also closing in on data from further trials of Opsumit. More distant data drops include a readout from a Phase III relapsing multiple sclerosis trial of sphingosine-1-phosphate 1 receptor agonist ponesimod.\nThese late-phase prospects could be attractive to buyers, although a clearer picture of their value will only emerge with the phase 3 readouts.\nThe current situation is particularly muddy for ponesimod, which will need to deliver impressive data if it is to claim market share in a niche where multiple drugmakers are gunning for Novartis’ incumbent Gilenya. The uncertainties created by the upcoming readouts led Jefferies Analyst Peter Welford to pencil in late 2017 or 2018 as a more likely time for a takeover. By then, the effect of generic competition on Tracleer, another of Actelion’s products, should be clearer, too.\nJ&J has nonetheless added its name to the list of drugmakers to approach Actelion. Reports have linked the Swiss company to a laundry list of major biopharma companies over the past six years. A takeover by Shire was reportedly on the cards last year, but Actelion CEO Jean-Paul Clozel, who fought off an activist investor in 2011, has consistently talked up the merits of staying independent.\nClozel and CSO Martine Clozel own approximately 5% of Actelion and have a track record of getting investors on their side. If J&J or another company is to finally succeed in acquiring Actelion, it will likely need to pay a hefty sum as compared to the Swiss drugmaker’s forecast sales and persuade Clozel of the operational value of the deal.",

      "text": "  09:28 AM EST The New #19 Most Shorted Dow Component: Johnson & Johnson The most recent short interest data has been released for the 11/15/2016 settlement date, and we here at Dividend Channel like to sift through this fresh data and order the underlying components of the Dow Jones Industrial Average by \"days to cover.\" There are a number of ways to look at short data, for example the total number of shares short; but one metric that we find particularly useful is the \"days to cover\" metric because it considers both the total shares short and the average daily volume of shares typically traded. The number of shares short is then compared to the average daily volume, in order to calculate the total number of trading days it would take to close out all of the open short positions if every share traded represented a short position being closed.",

      "text": "Get the Future Market Projections for Hemostasis at: http://www.transparencymarketresearch.com/sample/sample.php?flag=B&rep_id=2401 Topical hemostats are mostly used in surgery settings for hemostatis. Collagen among these is majorly used as it acts immediately and starts blood clotting by natural pathway. Topical agents are preferred over other agents due to their ease of use, efficiency, biodegradable nature and cost effectiveness. The other major method to treat hemostasis disorder is by using infusible hemostats. The major products which consist of infusible hemostats include: - Platelet concentrates from donor blood - FVIII derived from blood - Fresh frozen plasma - Prothrombin complex This method of treatment is used very rarely to treat hemostasis disorder and is used only under some specific conditions. For instance, fresh frozen plasma and prothrombin complex is majorly used to treat severe hemorrhages. Advanced hemostats and sealants market consists of products which have came into existence in recent years and is considered as the best treatment option. Some of the products of this market are still under research pipeline. Advanced hemostats and sealants segment of the hemostasis market includes following categories: - Flowable - Fibrin - Synthetic sealants In the hemostats and sealants market, several formulations of fibrinogen and thrombin have been developed, the most popular and commonly used product being the liquid fibrin sealant product in which the fibrinogen and thrombin are stored separately as lyophilized powder or frozen liquid. The other popular product which has captured large share of market is recothrom by the Medicines Company. Recrothrom is the human recombinant thrombin used as an aid for hemostasis. The market for this segment is increasing rapidly as these products act quickly and are safe in comparison to the topical agents. Topical agents sometimes cause infection leading to fatal consequences. The hemostasis market is growing at a faster pace with Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) being the major market player. Johnson & Johnson offers distinguished products in hemostasis market under its wholly owned subsidiary Ethicon 360. Ethicon 360's all products which are under hemostasis product portfolio are approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Recently, in October 2013, JNJ received clearance from FDA for Harmonic Ace +7, the first ultrasonic surgical devices indicated to seal vessels up to 7 mm. Extensive research and the new innovative products are the major reasons which are helping the market to grow. As recently, Arch Therapeutics, Inc. has developed a revolutionary product to stop bleeding faster than any other product available in market by the name AC5. AC5 is currently in preclinical testing and takes an average time of 15 seconds to stop bleeding in comparison to 80 seconds to 300 seconds taken by other treatments methods. Read the Present Hemostasis Market Forecast at: http://www.transparencymarketresearch.com/hemostasis-market.html Some of the market players in Hemostasis market include Abbott Laboratories, Beckman Coulter, Inc., Becton, Dickinson and Company, F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd., Siemens AG, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc., Trinity Biotech plc, Chrono-Log Corporation and The Medicines Company.

Sometimes, bleeding disorder occurs due to vascular and coagulation abnormalities. These abnormalities could be inherited or acquired. Acquired disorders are the most common by far, majorly thrombocytopenia and other abnormalities include trauma, anticoagulant rodenticide, vitamin K deficiency, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), Von Willebrand disease (vWD), deficiency of intrinsic and extrinsic factors, dysfibrinogenemia, Monoclonal Gammopathy and congenital platelet function defect. The hemostasis market is segmented into three major categories based on the types of products, as topical hemostats, infusible hemostats and advanced hemostats and sealants. Topical hemostats are further fragmented into three main segments which include:",

      "text": "  Johnson & Johnson's Janssen Pharmaceutical Starts Study on Hepatitis C Therapy The goal is to investigate the treatment's efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetics November 28, 2016 | About: JNJ +0% MVRBF +0% \nMedivir AB ( MVRBF ) announced Janssen Research & Development, part of Johnson & Johnson's ( NYSE:JNJ ) Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies, has commenced a clinical research trial for JNJ-4178, a treatment for individuals with chronic hepatitis C. No placebo will be used for non-cirrhotic patients infected with genotype 1, 2, 4, 5 and 6 of the hepatitis C virus that have taken an anti-HCV therapy in the past. \nAccording to the news release, the study will evaluate \"the safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetics of the combination of simeprevir, odalasvir and AL-335, also known as JNJ-4178\" on the aforementioned patients. The clinical trial will be conducted in North America, Europe and Asia. \nPatients that undergo the trial will receive a therapy based on a combination of simeprevir, odalasvir and JNJ-4178, which will be administered for a period of six to eight weeks. Peter Lynch Chart of JNJ \nAccording to ClinicalTrials.gov , the first scope of this study is to determine how many patients will \"achieve the Sustained Virologic Response 12 weeks After the end of Treatment.\" \nThe U.S. National Institutes of Health estimate the data collection will be completed by August 2017 and the overall study is expected to be complete by October 2017. \nResearchers are evaluating the effects of the therapy on a group of patients whose livers show signs of compensated cirrhosis. \nCompensated cirrhosis \"means that the liver is heavily scarred but can still perform many important bodily functions,\" unlike decompensated cirrhosis that may \"eventually develop many symptoms and complications that can be life threatening.\" \nSimeprevir, Odalasvir and AL-335 are antiviral drugs that inhibit the essential protein responsible for the replication of the hepatitis C virus (HCV). The main difference between these drugs and competing drugs is that these new drugs act directly against the virus, blocking its replication process. \nOther drugs either stimulate the immune system's response to the virus or indirectly interfere with viral replication. \nPeople affected by this illness account for approximately 3% of the world's population (150 million to 200 million people). There are about 3.5 million new diagnoses every year. \nIn the U.S., about 70% of hepatitis C infection cases are related to genotype 1. The World Health Organization (WHO) has implemented a classification system that includes 11 HCV genotypes. \nDisclosure: I have no positions in any stock mentioned in this article.

      "text": "Tracking Stephen Mandel's Lone Pine Capital Portfolio - Q3 2016 Update (Seeking Alpha) \nJim Cramer said on CNBC's Mad Money that he would wait for Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ ) to drop to $110 before buying the stock. \nAnheuser Busch Inbev SA NV (ADR) (NYSE: BUD ) traded lower because of the strong U.S. dollar. Cramer added that Constellation Brands, Inc. (NYSE: STZ ) is a better buy because the President-elect won't target beer in relations with Mexico. Cramer explained that people expect that Modelo and Corona are going to be taxed and he thinks it won't happen. \nStarbucks Corporation (NASDAQ: SBUX ) is a buy, believes Cramer. He thinks the company has to work more on its mobile pay. Starbucks is a huge position in his charitable trust.  ",

      "text": "  10:56 AM EST Report: Johnson & Johnson Boosts Bid For Actelion \nIn a sign that a deal could be close to being struck, healthcare products giant Johnson & Johnson ( NYSE:JNJ ) has reportedly upped its takeover offer for European biotech giant Actelion. \nThe move follows Friday’s news that J&J was pursuing an acquisition of Actelion, which is a specialist maker of blood pressure drugs. From Bloomberg : \nJohnson & Johnson, the world’s biggest maker of health-care products, raised its takeover offer for Actelion as negotiations with Europe’s largest biotech firm progress, according to people familiar with the matter, Bloomberg News reports. \nAn acquisition won’t come easily, however. Actelion has repeatedly rebuffed takeover attempts in recent years. From the WSJ : \nThe Swiss company fought off an attempt by Elliott Management to force it into a sale in 2011, and a reported bid by Shire last year. That has had reasonable results for shareholders. Elliott thought Actelion could fetch 70 Swiss francs a share, less than half its current value. Shire’s approach, reported by The Sunday Times of London, would also have been below the current share price. \nA deal certainly won’t come cheaply. Thomson Reuters Eikon notes that Actelion currently trades at 20 times forward earnings estimates, versus a sector average of just 13 times. What’s more, the company would likely want to see significant upside to its current $18.5 billion valuation in a takeover bid. \nHow much remaining upside there is left remains to be seen, but it’s clear that JNJ is intent on getting a deal done soon. \nJohnson & Johnson shares fell $0.93 (-0.82%) to $112.20 in Tuesday morning trading. JNJ has gained 9.29% year-to-date, putting the stock roughly in-line with the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period. You are viewing an abbreviated republication of ETF Daily News content.

      "text": "By Pamela Barbaglia and Anjuli Davies | LONDON \nU.S. healthcare company Johnson & Johnson is raising its offer for Swiss biotech group Actelion in an attempt to win it over for a buyout, a source familiar with the situation said on Tuesday. \nActelion shares closed up 10 percent at 209 Swiss francs, rebounding from negative territory. \nThe source said Johnson & Johnson increased its offer amid reluctance by the Swiss biotechnology company to give up its independence. \nAn acquisition of the Swiss company would boosts J&J’s drug pipeline and diversify its prospects. J&J’s biggest product, the arthritis drug Remicade, faces cheaper competition from Pfizer Inc PFE.N. \nBloomberg News reported that Actelion had rejected an offer of 246 francs per share, which would have valued a potential deal at 25.5 billion Swiss francs ($25.15 billion). \nActelion was not immediately available for comment. A spokesman for Johnson & Johnson declined comment. \nThe companies had confirmed last week they were in talks about a possible transaction. \nDifferences between how Johnson & Johnson, the world’s biggest maker of healthcare products, and Actelion view a transaction have emerged, with Actelion seeking a new, major shareholder in a merged entity and the U.S. company favoring a deal where it would take control of the Swiss biotech, the source said. \nThe talks between the two companies had begun in October. \nThe companies had originally discussed a transaction without a big premium, with the dialogue focusing on some form of share deal or an asset swap, a nod toward Actelion Chief Executive Jean-Paul Clozel’s insistence that his company develop on its own, a second source familiar with the negotiations said. \nThat has unraveled, with Johnson & Johnson now focused on owning Actelion outright but being forced to offer a significant premium to convince Clozel, the source said. \nDriving the price higher could prompt some other companies that would have considered bidding for Actelion to back away, the source said, adding France’s Sanofi and Switzerland’s Roche could still be interested. \nClozel is French, and both he and his wife, Martine Clozel, Actelion’s chief scientific officer, worked at Roche before co-founding the company in 1997. \n($1 = 1.0140 Swiss francs) \n(Reporting by Pamela Barbaglia in London and John Miller in Zurich, Editing by Michael Shields) Share This:",

      "text": "Johnson & Johnson reportedly raises bid for Actelion By Manuel Baigorri, Matthew Campbell and Dinesh Nair Published 4:07 pm, Tuesday, November 29, 2016 \nJohnson & Johnson, the world’s biggest maker of health care products, has reportedly raised its takeover offer for Actelion, Europe’s largest biotech firm, as negotiations progress. \nPeople familiar with the talks said that Johnson & Johnson significantly increased its offer from an earlier bid of about $26 billion, which would be $242 per share, which the Swiss company rejected as too low. The people asked not to be identified because the deliberations are private. The new price couldn’t be confirmed. Actelion has given the American company access to some of its financial information as part of the negotiations, they said. \nWhile Johnson & Johnson would prefer to buy the whole company, it’s also open to discussing other structures for the deal to win the backing of Actelion’s Chief Executive Officer and co-founder Jean-Paul Clozel , the people said. However, it wants to ultimately gain control of the Swiss drugmaker, one of the people said. One option reportedly being discussed is the creation of a separate entity for Actelion’s experimental drugs and research activities. \nThe Financial Times reported on Monday that the companies were discussing a complex transaction that could allow the Swiss company to remain independent, and that Actelion isn’t actively pursuing an outright sale. Such a deal would bring together Actelion and parts of Johnson & Johnson’s pharmaceutical business, the newspaper said, citing unnamed people close to the discussions. \nSpokesmen for Johnson & Johnson and Actelion declined to comment. \nActelion shares rose 10 percent Tuesday in Zurich, giving it a market value of about $22 billion. The company’s shares jumped the most in more than 16 years on Friday after Bloomberg reported Johnson &Johnson’s interest. \nThe companies confirmed Johnson & Johnson’s approach in separate statements Friday, but said there’s no guarantee they’ll come to an agreement. There has been speculation that Actelion may also attract other suitors, including Novartis and Sanofi. \nClozel has said in the past that he wants Actelion to remain independent after years of speculation that the company, which specializes in treatments for a type of hypertension that affects arteries that connect the heart to the lungs, could be a takeover target. The CEO, who is one of Actelion’s largest shareholders, may now be more open to entertaining a sale at a sufficient premium. \nManuel Baigorri, Matthew Campbell and Dinesh Nair are Bloomberg writers.

      "text": "A \nLONDON: U.S. healthcare company Johnson & Johnson has raised its offer for Actelion, a source told Reuters on Tuesday, stepping up pressure on the Swiss biotech firm to accept a takeover deal. \nJ&J had increased its offer, which has not yet been made public, after nearly two months of informal talks which have so far not resulted in a deal, the source added. \nThe main stumbling block is that Actelion wants J&J to become a major shareholder in a new entity combining the Swiss group with some of J&J's activities, whereas the U.S. company wants a straightforward takeover, the source said. \nActelion shares closed up 10 percent at 209 Swiss francs, just off a record high, following news of the higher offer. \nJ&J has become one of the world's biggest healthcare companies through hundreds of acquisitions, in which it has nearly always bought entire companies or drugs outright. \nActelion co-founder and Chief Executive Jean-Paul Clozel has fended off previous attempts to wrest the Swiss firm from him, including a reported takeover approach by Shire last year and an activist campaign in 2011 by U.S. hedge fund Elliott Advisors. \nClozel and his wife Martine, who is Actelion's chief scientific officer, founded the business in 1997. They have been trying to expand its portfolio, which consists of three main drugs focused on treating PAH, a deadly buildup of pressure in blood vessels between the heart and lungs. \nEarlier, Bloomberg News reported that Actelion had rejected an offer of 246 francs per share, valuing the Swiss company at around 26.5 billion Swiss francs (US$26 billion). The Clozels, both physicians who worked at Roche before setting up Actelion, still own more than 3 percent of its shares. \nRecent pharma deals have commanded significant premiums, with Pfizer paying US$14 billion for cancer specialist Medivation, double its pre-deal value. \nRARE DISEASES \nActelion, whose rare-disease focus makes it an attractive target because its drugs face less price pressure than more widely used medicines, was not available for comment. \nA spokesman for Johnson & Johnson declined to comment. \nThe companies had confirmed last week they were in talks about a possible transaction. \nCitigroup is advising J&J, while Bank of America is working with Actelion, two sources said. Both banks declined to comment. \nAcquiring the Swiss company would boost J&J's drug pipeline and diversify its prospects. Its biggest product, the arthritis drug Remicade, faces cheaper competition from Pfizer Inc.. \nActelion is also growing. Although its blockbuster Tracleer's patent has expired, its new treatment Opsumit's annual sales are set to hit 1.9 billion francs by 2020, according to Reuters data, while just-introduced Uptravi sales could top 2.5 billion francs. \nThe talks between the two companies began in October, the first source said. \nThe companies had originally discussed a transaction without a big premium, focusing on some form of share deal or an asset swap, the source said. \nJohn Rountree, director with London-based consultancy Novasecta, said a structured transaction allowing Actelion to benefit from J&J's scale without losing its independence could work for both sides. \nOne option might be for J&J to mimic Roche, which bought 60 percent of Genentech in 1990, leaving it to operate independently, before acquiring the rest of the biotech in 2009. \n(Additional reporting by Ben Hirschler in London, John Miller in Zurich and Ludwig Burger in Frankfurt; Editing by Alexandra Hudson and Alexander Smith) - Reuters",

      "text": "Leaders celebrate new Johnson & Johnson center — and 500 Tampa jobs 1 Month Ago \nEnterprise Florida agreed on Wednesday — with Scott in attendance during the entire two-hour meeting — to hire former Tampa state Rep. Chris Hart IV to run the embattled quasi-governmental agency that oversees the recruiting of businesses to relocate to Florida. \nHart, 48, has run the state's job training development agency, CareerSource Florida under Scott and prior to that he was the interim director of the Office of Tourism, Trade and Economic Development under former Gov. Charlie Crist from Jan. 2010 to early 2011. A Republican, he was in the Florida Legislature from 1998 to 2002. \n\"I'd like to thank you for inviting me to be apart of this grand adventure with all of you,\" Hart told Enterprise Florida board members at a meeting in Miramar Beach in Northwest Florida. \"What better place than Enterprise Florida to help our fellow Floridians realize their hopes and their dreams and their aspirations.\" \nEnterprise Florida board members are touting Hart's past as a state legislator as a sign that the agency will work better with the Florida Legislature, which gutted Scott's job incentives programs last year by refusing to give Scott any of the $250 million he requested. Incoming House Speaker  Pasco County, has declared the incentive program as \"corporate welfare\" that conflict with his view of government's proper role. \nHart will take over an Enterprise Florida that is still paying for issues left over from former CEO Bill Johnson. Enterprise Florida announced this week it had spent $107,000 since June on an outside accounting and management firm that specializes in taking on \"distressed situations\" and \"helps clean things up.\" Another $10,000 might still need to go to that company, CFO Strategic Partners in Orlando, before they complete their task, said Rodney Ownby, vice president of accounting and finance at Enterprise Florida. \nJohnson left Enterprise Florida in June after Scott unceremoniously announced months earlier that he would be \"transitioning out\" of the agency. Scott never said Johnson was fired, but Johnson was given a $132,400 severance package on top of his $265,000 annual salary. \nAs Johnson was leaving, an outside review of the agency warned that it was overspending on management, travel and lacked internal financial controls to prevent fraud. Since then, the agency has cut employees from 80 to 57, trimmed management, reduced office space and put better internal controls in place. \nDespite the turmoil, Scott has been unwavering in his support of Enterprise Florida and has vowed to keep pushing the state Legislature for more money for job incentive programs — despite Corcoran's objections. Before Hart was officially hired, Scott praised Enterprise Florida for being instrumental in helping Florida add more than 1.1 million private jobs since he was elected. \n\"Bottom line is that it works in our state the way we are doing it,\" said Scott, who added that Florida has won over 500 competitive projects against other states since he took office thanks to Enterprise Florida. \nFlorida does not have a traditional commerce department like many other states. Instead, 20 years ago, Florida created Enterprise Florida to be quasi-governmental entity with a 64-member board of directors that runs it largely like a private business. About 90 percent of its operations are funded by taxpayers. \nFor much of Scott's tenure, Enterprise Florida has been a cherished organization charged with leading his efforts to recruit companies from other states and nations to move to Florida to create jobs — a central theme of Scott's 2010 and 2014 campaigns for governor. \nContact Jeremy Wallace at jwallace@tampabay.com.

The report, which was picked up by major outlets including Reuters, said that Actelion has outright rejected Johnson & Johnson’s most recent offer.

      "text": "Trades from $ 3 Johnson & Johnson ( JNJ - Free Report ) , the bellwether among healthcare companies, has a strong presence in the pharmaceutical, medical devices and consumer care markets across the world. This New Jersey-based company is well known for its baby-care products and brands like Tylenol in addition to drugs like Remicade and Concerta. In a year which saw the pharma sector struggling with media and political focus on high prices of drugs, J&J’s share price is up 9.5% in the year-to-date period. This compares favorably with the 8.0% fall for the Zacks classified Large-Cap Pharma industry. \nJOHNSON & JOHNS Price \nJOHNSON & JOHNS Price | JOHNSON & JOHNS Quote \nLet us analyse the reasons for the same. Consistently Strong Results; Regular Guidance Increases: J&J has consistently delivered strong earnings results. It also came up with positive sales and earnings surprises in all the three quarters of 2016. Moreover, the company raised its full-year earnings expectations in these three quarters. Pharma Division Well Poised: Johnson & Johnson has one of the most diverse revenue streams in the industry in the pharmaceutical division. The segment accounts for around 47% of its total revenues. The company boasts several multi-million dollar drugs covering a broad range of areas such as neuroscience; cardiovascular and metabolism; immunology; oncology and infectious diseases/vaccines. The segment continues to perform well despite challenges like generic competition for a few products, potential biosimilar competition and lower revenues from the hepatitis C virus (HCV)franchise. However, Pfizer Inc’s ( PFE - Free Report ) upcoming launch of biosimilar Remicade – Inflectra – creates some uncertainty regarding the segment’s sales prospects in 2017. In fact, this explains why J&J’s shares have declined 3.9% since elections compared to a 1% decline for the Large-Cap Pharma industry which gained significantly post elections. The company suffered the decline despite strong third-quarter results announced on Oct 18, wherein it beat on all fronts and raised the lower end of its earnings outlook for the year. However, we believe that the U.S. Remicade biosimilar impact may be manageable. J&J should be able to retain share as the 15% discount offered by Pfizer may not really end up in huge patient switches especially with the products not being interchangeable. New Products Driving Sales: New products like Imbruvica, Xarelto and Darzalex have been well received by the market. Zytiga and Imbruvica are notable among the company’s successful launches in the oncology portfolio. While strong patient uptake with new indications, approvals and demonstrated efficacy are driving sales of Imbruvica, Xarelto continues to gain market share and broader reimbursement. Darzalex is gradually gaining strong acceptance as a treatment for multiple myeloma. The company is also working toward expanding the label of currently marketed products like Simponi, Stelara, Zytiga and Imbruvica which should further aid its top line. Pipeline Matters: Johnson & Johnson, which has launched 12 new products since 2011, intends to seek approval for more than 10 new products between 2015 and 2019. The company said that each of these products have blockbuster potential. The company is targeting more than 40 line extensions of existing and new drugs as well. This should help it to lessen the impact of the genericization of key products in the pharma portfolio. Key candidates in the company’s pipeline include esketamine (treatment-resistant depression), apalutamide (pre-metastatic prostate cancer), imetelstat (myelofibrosis and myelodysplastic syndrome), sirukumab (rheumatoid arthritis and major depressive disorder), guselkumab (psoriasis) and niraparib (prostate cancer) among others. Conclusion Like many of its peers like Eli Lilly and Company ( LLY - Free Report ) and Merck & Co., Inc. ( MRK - Free Report ) , J&J is facing generic competition and pricing pressure for some products in its pharmaceutical segment. J&J also had issues with its consumer segment manufacturing facilities. Yet, we believe J&J’s diversified business model, deep pipeline, lack of cyclicality and strong financial position will continue to help the company navigate tough times. Meanwhile, J&J’s evolving product mix should drive growth in the face of biosimilar competition and market dynamics. J&J carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

      "text": "Actelion’s reportedly not interested in a straight-up takeover by suitor Johnson & Johnson. But the New Jersey drugmaker is, and it’s loading the pressure on.\nThe pharma giant has raised its offer for the Swiss biotech, Bloomberg’s sources say. The new proposed price isn’t known, but it’s a significant increase on the CHF 246 ($242) per share--or $26 billion--that Actelion previously rejected. That offer wasn’t public, though both companies disclosed late last week that they were engaged in deal talks. Actelion has also given J&J a peek at some of its financial information as part of the process, the news service says.\nAccording to Reuters, that process has been going on informally for nearly two months, but the parties haven’t been able to move forward. The hang-up? Actelion would rather form a new entity with a piece of J&J, with the behemoth becoming a major shareholder of that new entity. J&J, on the other hand, wants to swallow Actelion whole.\nIt wasn’t always that way, Reuters says. The companies initially talked over a transaction without a big premium--such as a share deal or an asset swap. And Bloomberg says J&J is still open to talking through other deal structures in order to win over Actelion CEO Jean-Paul Clozel. Ultimately, though, J&J--which is looking for new revenue streams as biosimilar competition creeps up on blockbuster Remicade--wants control of Actelion, according to Bloomberg’s sources.\nActelion, a frequent subject of takeover buzz, hasn’t exactly been shy about the fact that it wants to keep flying solo. Clozel, who founded the company with his wife Martine--Actelion’s chief scientific officer--after leaving an exec post at Roche, told Bloomberg in April that “if we want to continue to create shareholder value, the best for us is to remain independent.”\nBankers, though, are working to get other Big Pharma players to make their own Actelion approaches, the Financial Times reported this week. Roche, Novartis and Sanofi have all popped up previously in chatter concerning potential suitors.\nBut Actelion has plenty of experience fending off unwanted suitors. Last year, the company reportedly dodged an $18.9 billion bid from fellow rare-disease drugmaker Shire, and in 2011 it resisted activist hedge fund Elliott Advisors.",

Plaintiffs claimed the companies promoted the devices as lasting longer than devices that include ceramic or plastic materials. \nJ&J and DePuy are facing nearly 8,400 lawsuits over the devices, which have been consolidated in federal court in Texas. Test cases have been selected for trial, and their outcomes will help gauge the value of the remaining claims. \nMark Lanier, lawyer for the plaintiffs, said the verdict was \"a message loud and clear\" that J&J has \"a really nasty part of their business they need to clean up.\" \nJ&J did not immediately respond to requests for comment. \n(Reporting by Erica Teichert in New York; Editing by Jonathan Oatis)",

      "text": "By Reuters / Reuters | December 2, 2016 : 8:14 AM MYT Translated by Google Translator: Translated by Google Translator: \n(Dec 2): A federal jury in Dallas on Thursday ordered Johnson & Johnson and its DePuy Orthopaedics unit to pay more than $1 billion to six plaintiffs who said they were injured by Pinnacle hip implants. \nThe jurors found that the metal-on-metal Pinnacle hip implants were defectively designed and that the companies failed to warn consumers about the risks. \nJ&J, which faces more than 8,000 lawsuits over the hip implants, said in a statement it would immediately appeal the verdict and was committed to defending itself and DePuy from further litigation over the Pinnacle devices. \nThe six plaintiffs awarded more than $1 billion are California residents who were implanted with the hip devices and experienced tissue death, bone erosion and other injuries they attributed to design flaws. Plaintiffs claimed the companies promoted the devices as lasting longer than devices that include ceramic or plastic materials. \nBoth companies denied any wrongdoing stemming from the development and marketing of the devices. \nAccording to plaintiff's lawyer Mark Lanier, the total verdict of $1.041 billion included $32 million in compensatory damages. The rest were punitive damages. \nVerdicts of such size are often scaled back by courts. In July, the judge presiding over this case, U.S. District Judge Edward Kinkeade, reduced a $500 million verdict in an earlier Pinnacle implant case to $151 million, citing a Texas state law that limits punitive damages awards. \nJ&J and DePuy have been hit with nearly 8,400 lawsuits over the devices, which have been consolidated in Texas federal court. Test cases have been selected for trial, and their outcomes will help gauge the value of the remaining claims. \nThe verdict on Thursday came in the third test case, with the second producing the earlier $500 million verdict. J&J and DePuy were cleared of liability in the first test case in 2014 \nLanier said Thursday's verdict was \"a message loud and clear\" that J&J has \"a really nasty part of their business they need to clean up.\" \nThe company rejected a $1.8 million settlement offer from the plaintiffs before trial, Lanier said. \nThe plaintiffs in the second test case have appealed Kinkeade's decision to cut the award. Johnson & Johnson and DePuy have also appealed the jury verdict in the case. \nIn its statement, J&J criticized the trial judge over certain rulings it claimed help the plaintiffs. \n\"Today's verdict provides no guidance on the merits of the overall Pinnacle litigation because the court's rulings precluded a fair presentation to the jury,\" said John Beisner, J&J's attorney. \nHe said the company will ask the appeals court to postpone any additional trials over the implant defects. \nDePuy ceased selling the metal-on-metal Pinnacle devices in 2013 after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration strengthened its artificial hip regulations. \nJ&J and DePuy also paid $2.5 billion that year to settle more than 7,000 lawsuits over its ASR metal-on-metal hip devices. The ASR devices were recalled in 2010 due to high failure rates. \nJ&J shares fell 38 cents to $111 in after-hours trading. They had closed up 8 cents during the day. - Reuters Related Articles",

Plaintiffs claimed the companies promoted the devices as lasting longer than devices that include ceramic or plastic materials.\nBoth companies denied any wrongdoing stemming from the development and marketing of the devices.\nAccording to plaintiff's lawyer Mark Lanier, the total verdict of $1.041 billion included $32 million in compensatory damages. The rest were punitive damages.\nVerdicts of such size are often scaled back by courts. In July, the judge presiding over this case, U.S. District Judge Edward Kinkeade, reduced a $500 million verdict in an earlier Pinnacle implant case to $151 million, citing a Texas state law that limits punitive damages awards.\nJ&J and DePuy have been hit with nearly 8,400 lawsuits over the devices, which have been consolidated in Texas federal court. Test cases have been selected for trial, and their outcomes will help gauge the value of the remaining claims.\nThe verdict on Thursday came in the third test case, with the second producing the earlier $500 million verdict. J&J and DePuy were cleared of liability in the first test case in 2014 \nLanier said Thursday's verdict was \"a message loud and clear\" that J&J has \"a really nasty part of their business they need to clean up.\" \nThe company rejected a $1.8 million settlement offer from the plaintiffs before trial, Lanier said.\nThe plaintiffs in the second test case have appealed Kinkeade’s decision to cut the award. Johnson & Johnson and DePuy have also appealed the jury verdict in the case.\nIn its statement, J&J criticized the trial judge over certain rulings it claimed help the plaintiffs. \n“Today’s verdict provides no guidance on the merits of the overall Pinnacle litigation because the court’s rulings precluded a fair presentation to the jury,” said John Beisner, J&J’s attorney.\nHe said the company will ask the appeals court to postpone any additional trials over the implant defects.\nDePuy ceased selling the metal-on-metal Pinnacle devices in 2013 after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration strengthened its artificial hip regulations. \nJ&J and DePuy also paid $2.5 billion that year to settle more than 7,000 lawsuits over its ASR metal-on-metal hip devices. The ASR devices were recalled in 2010 due to high failure rates. \nJ&J shares fell 38 cents to $111 in after-hours trading. They had closed up 8 cents during the day.\n\n\n(Reporting by Erica Teichert in New York; Editing by Jonathan Oatis and Tom Brown)",

      "text": "Money News | Fri Dec 2, 2016 | 5:36am IST Johnson & Johnson hit with over $1 billion verdict on hip implants The logo of healthcare company Johnson & Johnson is seen in front of an office building in Zug, Switzerland July 20, 2016. REUTERS/Arnd Wiegmann By Erica Teichert \nA federal jury in Dallas on Thursday ordered Johnson & Johnson ( JNJ.N ) and its DePuy Orthopaedics unit to pay more than $1 billion to six plaintiffs who said they were injured by Pinnacle hip implants. \nThe jurors found that the metal-on-metal Pinnacle hip implants were defectively designed and that the companies failed to warn consumers about the risks. \nJ&J, which faces more than 8,000 lawsuits over the hip implants, said in a statement it would immediately appeal the verdict and was committed to defending itself and DePuy from further litigation over the Pinnacle devices. \nThe six plaintiffs awarded more than $1 billion are California residents who were implanted with the hip devices and experienced tissue death, bone erosion and other injuries they attributed to design flaws. Plaintiffs claimed the companies promoted the devices as lasting longer than devices that include ceramic or plastic materials. \nBoth companies denied any wrongdoing stemming from the development and marketing of the devices. \nAccording to plaintiff's lawyer Mark Lanier, the total verdict of $1.041 billion included $32 million in compensatory damages. The rest were punitive damages. \nVerdicts of such size are often scaled back by courts. In July, the judge presiding over this case, U.S. District Judge Edward Kinkeade, reduced a $500 million verdict in an earlier Pinnacle implant case to $151 million, citing a Texas state law that limits punitive damages awards. \nJ&J and DePuy have been hit with nearly 8,400 lawsuits over the devices, which have been consolidated in Texas federal court. Test cases have been selected for trial, and their outcomes will help gauge the value of the remaining claims. \nThe verdict on Thursday came in the third test case, with the second producing the earlier $500 million verdict. J&J and DePuy were cleared of liability in the first test case in 2014 \nLanier said Thursday's verdict was \"a message loud and clear\" that J&J has \"a really nasty part of their business they need to clean up.\" \nThe company rejected a $1.8 million settlement offer from the plaintiffs before trial, Lanier said. \nThe plaintiffs in the second test case have appealed Kinkeade’s decision to cut the award. Johnson & Johnson and DePuy have also appealed the jury verdict in the case. \nIn its statement, J&J criticized the trial judge over certain rulings it claimed help the plaintiffs. \n“Today’s verdict provides no guidance on the merits of the overall Pinnacle litigation because the court’s rulings precluded a fair presentation to the jury,” said John Beisner, J&J’s attorney. \nHe said the company will ask the appeals court to postpone any additional trials over the implant defects. \nDePuy ceased selling the metal-on-metal Pinnacle devices in 2013 after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration strengthened its artificial hip regulations. \nJ&J and DePuy also paid $2.5 billion that year to settle more than 7,000 lawsuits over its ASR metal-on-metal hip devices. The ASR devices were recalled in 2010 due to high failure rates. \nJ&J shares fell 38 cents to $111 in after-hours trading. They had closed up 8 cents during the day. \n(Reporting by Erica Teichert in New York; Editing by Jonathan Oatis and Tom Brown) Next In Money News",

      "text": "Get Unlimited Digital Access Your first month is less than a dollar. $0.99 for first 4 weeks Subscribe Now \nA federal jury in Dallas ordered Johnson & Johnson and one of its subsidiaries to pay more than $1 billion in damages Thursday for \"despicable and vile conduct\" in selling Pinnacle metal-on-metal hip implants that they knew were seriously defective. \nA jury of six women and three men ordered the New Jersey pharmaceutical and medical device maker and its DePuy Orthopaedics subsidiary to pay damages to six people -- all from California -- who suffered serious chronic and painful medical problems caused by the device. \nMore than 40 witnesses testified during the 11-week trial. The jury deliberated for nearly eight hours before returning with the verdict awarding $32 million in actual damages and $1.009 billion in punitive damages. \nThe trial was the third in a series of bellwether cases being held by U.S. District Judge Ed Kinkeade. More than 8,900 cases against Johnson & Johnson and DePuy have been filed across the U.S. The lawsuits have been consolidated in what is known as multi-district litigation. \nIn the first trial, held in October 2014, the jury ruled for Johnson & Johnson. \nLast March, a second jury ruled in favor of five Texans who sued the hip implant maker and were awarded more than $502 million in damages, an amount that Kinkeade reduced to $113 million as a result of legal caps on damages under Texas law. Dallas jury's $502m verdict for five hip implant victims may just be the first \nThe last verdict is on appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. \nMark Lanier, the lead lawyer for the plaintiffs in the multi-district litigation, said he plans to ask the Fifth Circuit to consolidateThursday's verdict with the two pending cases. \nIn Thursday's decision, the jury found that Johnson & Johnson and DePuy officials intentionally misrepresented the dangers of the product for the sake of monetary gain. \n\"Once again, a jury has listened to the testimony of both sides and returned a verdict affirming what we've known all along: a responsible company would settle these cases and take care of their injured consumers, rather than forcing them through expensive and vexatious litigation just to delay justice,\" Lanier said. \"This jury spoke loud and clear, and I hope J&J will finally listen.\" \nThe Pinnacle implant, according to Lanier, was designed with a metal, rather than a safer ceramic or polyethylene, socket. The metal-on-metal design causes the socket to rub against the ball head, which can lead to corrosion and can cause bone and surrounding tissue to erode over time. \nEach of the six plaintiffs in the trial had to undergo revision surgeries to replace the implants and repair the damage. \nThe fourth bellwether trial is scheduled for September 2017. \nFor a longer version of this article, visit texaslawbook.net .

      "text": "Johnson & Johnson Ordered To Pay More Than $1 Bln For Faulty Hip Implants December 01, 2016, 07:59:  Johnson & Johnson Ordered To Pay More Than $1 Bln For Faulty Hip Implants \n(RTTNews.com) - A federal jury in Dallas has returned a combined verdict of more than $1 billion on behalf of six people who suffered serious medical complications caused by defective metal-on-metal hip implants made by Johnson & Johnson ( JNJ ) and its subsidiary DePuy Orthopaedics Inc, Lanier Law Firm said on Thursday. \nThe verdict includes more than $30 million in actual damages for the six plaintiffs and more than $1 billion in punitive damages assessed against Johnson & Johnson and DePuy. \nThe verdict is the third bellwether trial among thousands of similar lawsuits nationwide that have been consolidated in multidistrict litigation (MDL) in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas. A bellwether trial is one that is typically representative of all the issues involved in the litigation of a mass tort case. \nLanier Law Firm noted that The Pinnacle implant was designed with a metal, rather than a safer ceramic or polyethylene, socket. The metal-on-metal design causes the socket to rub against the ball head, which can lead to corrosion and can cause bone and surrounding tissue to erode over time. Each of the six plaintiffs in the trial had to undergo revision surgeries to replace the implants and repair the damage. Jurors heard testimony that Johnson & Johnson and DePuy aggressively marketed the implants and employed tactics that included paying kickbacks to surgeons for using the device although they were aware of safer alternatives. \nA fourth bellwether trial, which will involve 10 patients, has been scheduled by U.S. District Judge Ed Kinkeade in Dallas for September, 2017. \nFor comments and feedback: contact",

      "text": "Johnson & Johnson hit with over $1 bln verdict on hip implants Before you go, we thought you'd like these... READ MORE Dec 1st 2016 6:20PM \nDec 1 (Reuters) - A federal jury in Dallas on Thursday ordered Johnson & Johnson and its DePuy Orthopaedics unit to pay more than $1 billion to six plaintiffs who said they were injured by Pinnacle hip implants. \nThe jurors found that the metal-on-metal Pinnacle hip implants were defectively designed and that the companies failed to warn consumers about the risks. \nJ&J, which faces more than 8,000 lawsuits over the hip implants, said in a statement it would immediately appeal the verdict and was committed to defending itself and DePuy from further litigation over the Pinnacle devices. FindTheCompany | Graphiq \nThe six plaintiffs awarded more than $1 billion are California residents who were implanted with the hip devices and experienced tissue death, bone erosion and other injuries they attributed to design flaws. Plaintiffs claimed the companies promoted the devices as lasting longer than devices that include ceramic or plastic materials. \nBoth companies denied any wrongdoing stemming from the development and marketing of the devices. \nAccording to plaintiff's lawyer Mark Lanier, the total verdict of $1.041 billion included $32 million in compensatory damages. The rest were punitive damages. \nVerdicts of such size are often scaled back by courts. In July, the judge presiding over this case, U.S. District Judge Edward Kinkeade, reduced a $500 million verdict in an earlier Pinnacle implant case to $151 million, citing a Texas state law that limits punitive damages awards. \nJ&J and DePuy have been hit with nearly 8,400 lawsuits over the devices, which have been consolidated in Texas federal court. Test cases have been selected for trial, and their outcomes will help gauge the value of the remaining claims. \nThe verdict on Thursday came in the third test case, with the second producing the earlier $500 million verdict. J&J and DePuy were cleared of liability in the first test case in 2014 \nLanier said Thursday's verdict was \"a message loud and clear\" that J&J has \"a really nasty part of their business they need to clean up.\" \nThe company rejected a $1.8 million settlement offer from the plaintiffs before trial, Lanier said. \nThe plaintiffs in the second test case have appealed Kinkeade's decision to cut the award. Johnson & Johnson and DePuy have also appealed the jury verdict in the case. \nIn its statement, J&J criticized the trial judge over certain rulings it claimed help the plaintiffs. \n\"Today's verdict provides no guidance on the merits of the overall Pinnacle litigation because the court's rulings precluded a fair presentation to the jury,\" said John Beisner, J&J's attorney. \nHe said the company will ask the appeals court to postpone any additional trials over the implant defects. \nDePuy ceased selling the metal-on-metal Pinnacle devices in 2013 after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration strengthened its artificial hip regulations. \nJ&J and DePuy also paid $2.5 billion that year to settle more than 7,000 lawsuits over its ASR metal-on-metal hip devices. The ASR devices were recalled in 2010 due to high failure rates. \nJ&J shares fell 38 cents to $111 in after-hours trading. They had closed up 8 cents during the day. \n(Reporting by Erica Teichert in New York; Editing by Jonathan Oatis and Tom Brown)",

Test cases have been selected for trial, and the outcomes will help gauge the value of the remaining claims.\nMark Lanier, lawyer for the plaintiffs, said the verdict was “a message loud and clear” that Johnson & Johnson has “a really nasty part of their business they need to clean up.”\nAdvertisement\n  Johnson & Johnson did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",

The amount is the third largest jury award of 2016. Pictured is Johnson & Johnson corporate headquarters in New Jersey. ( Mario Tama | Getty Images ) Advertisement A federal jury in Dallas, Texas has ordered Johnson & Johnson and its DePuy Orthopedics unit to pay more than $1 billion to patients who claimed to have been injured by the metal-on-metal Pinnacle hip implants. Flawed Design The six plaintiffs said that the companies hid the flaws in the artificial hips, which caused them injuries that required them to undergo surgery. The federal jury on Thursday determined that officials of DePuy Orthopedics, which makes the Pinnacle hips, were aware about the defects but failed to give proper warning to doctors and patients about the risk that the hip replacement would fail. The plaintiffs, all California residents, were implanted with the hip devices but due to design flaws, experienced tissue death, bone erosion and other injuries. They said that the companies that promoted the devices claimed that these last longer than devices made of ceramic and plastic materials. Third Largest Jury Award Of The Year The six plaintiffs were awarded more than $1 billion. Data compiled by Bloomberg show that the $1.04 billion in compensatory and punitive damages is the third largest jury award of 2016. The jury's decision marks J&J's second loss linked to its hip implants . It still faces more than 8,000 lawsuits associated with the Pinnacle hips. \"The jury is telling J&J that they better settle these cases soon,\" said Mark Lanier, the plaintiffs' lawyer. \"All they are doing by trying more of these cases are driving up their costs and driving the company's reputation into the mud.\" J&J And Depuy To Challenge Verdict J&J and its Depuy unit denied any wrongdoing in the development and marketing of the devices. In a statement released on Thursday, the companies said that they will challenge the verdict saying that they have strong grounds for appeal and that they are committed to giving long-term defense to the allegations. \"DePuy acted appropriately and responsibly in the design and testing of ULTAMET Metal-on-Metal, and the product is backed by a strong track record of clinical data showing reduced pain and restored mobility for patients suffering from chronic hip pain,\" said DePuy spokesperson Mindy Tinsley. Other Lawsuits Faced By Johnson & Johnson Johnson & Johnson faces a string of lawsuits related to its products. Of the seven largest product-defect verdicts in the United States this year, six have been against J&J units. Three of these were lawsuits that claim the company's talc products cause ovarian cancer .  ",

(© Arnd Wiegmann / Reuters/REUTERS) REUTERS Updated:  15 PM \nDALLAS, Texas — A federal jury in Dallas on Thursday ordered Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N) and its DePuy Orthopaedics unit to pay more than $1 billion to six plaintiffs who said they were injured by Pinnacle hip implants. \nThe jurors found that the metal-on-metal Pinnacle hip implants were defectively designed and that the companies failed to warn consumers about the risks. \nJ&J, which faces more than 8,000 lawsuits over the hip implants, said in a statement it would immediately appeal the verdict and was committed to defending itself and DePuy from further litigation over the Pinnacle devices. \nThe six plaintiffs awarded more than $1 billion are California residents who were implanted with the hip devices and experienced tissue death, bone erosion and other injuries they attributed to design flaws. Plaintiffs claimed the companies promoted the devices as lasting longer than devices that include ceramic or plastic materials. \nKnee, hip replacements raise heart attack risk: study \nBoth companies denied any wrongdoing stemming from the development and marketing of the devices. \nAccording to plaintiff's lawyer Mark Lanier, the total verdict of $1.041 billion included $32 million in compensatory damages. The rest were punitive damages. \nVerdicts of such size are often scaled back by courts. In July, the judge presiding over this case, U.S. District Judge Edward Kinkeade, reduced a $500 million verdict in an earlier Pinnacle implant case to $151 million, citing a Texas state law that limits punitive damages awards. \nJ&J and DePuy have been hit with nearly 8,400 lawsuits over the devices, which have been consolidated in Texas federal court. Test cases have been selected for trial, and their outcomes will help gauge the value of the remaining claims. \nHospital charges vary greatly for same care: report \nThe verdict on Thursday came in the third test case, with the second producing the earlier $500 million verdict. J&J and DePuy were cleared of liability in the first test case in 2014 \nLanier said Thursday's verdict was \"a message loud and clear\" that J&J has \"a really nasty part of their business they need to clean up.\" \nThe company rejected a $1.8 million settlement offer from the plaintiffs before trial, Lanier said. \nThe plaintiffs in the second test case have appealed Kinkeade’s decision to cut the award. Johnson & Johnson and DePuy have also appealed the jury verdict in the case. \nIn its statement, J&J criticized the trial judge over certain rulings it claimed help the plaintiffs. \n“Today’s verdict provides no guidance on the merits of the overall Pinnacle litigation because the court’s rulings precluded a fair presentation to the jury,” said John Beisner, J&J’s attorney. \nHe said the company will ask the appeals court to postpone any additional trials over the implant defects. \nDePuy ceased selling the metal-on-metal Pinnacle devices in 2013 after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration strengthened its artificial hip regulations. \nJ&J and DePuy also paid $2.5 billion that year to settle more than 7,000 lawsuits over its ASR metal-on-metal hip devices. The ASR devices were recalled in 2010 due to high failure rates. \nJ&J shares fell 38 cents to $111 in after-hours trading. They had closed up 8 cents during the day.  ",

      "title": "Danai Gurira’s Rising Star in Hollywood Puts HIV/AIDS in the Spotlight",
      "text": "Brought to you by: Johnson & Johnson (Photo by Diane Bondareff/Invision for Johnson & Johnson/AP Images) \nThis article is presented in partnership with Johnson & Johnson. \nTake Action now! This World AIDS Day you can help keep a baby HIV free with Born Free Africa or help provide medicine to a child with HIV with Nyumbani through the simple act of sharing a photo using the free Donate a Photo app. For every photo you share, Johnson & Johnson will donate *$1 to a great cause you care about - and you will earn (1) Global Citizen Rewards point. \nThe voices of those afflicted with HIV, especially in southern Africa, often go unheard. \nThat’s why Danai Gurira , the rising star in AMC’s “The Walking Dead ” and the playwright behind “Eclipsed,” the Broadway play starring Lupita Nyong'o, has devoted her career to giving voice to their struggles. \n“I was raised on the continent in southern Africa where HIV/AIDS hit the hardest globally in the ’80s and ’90s,” Gurira told Global Citizen about how HIV has come to inform so much of her work. “It was a part of my upbringing. It was a part of how I grew up, watching this epidemic not be there and then be there and change everything.” \nThe ability of HIV/AIDS to destroy families and communities left a deep impression on Gurira as she emigrated to the United States with her parents, studied at university, and launched her career as a playwright. Her first award-winning, off-Broadway play, “In The Continuum,” told the stories of African women living with HIV, and was performed across the United States, Africa, and at the United Nations. \nRead More: 'I Felt Alone, Different, and Dirty': 21 and HIV Positive, Robbie Is Fighting Back \nIn recognition of World Aids Day, Gurira has partnered with Johnson & Johnson to raise awareness about how the story of HIV and children in Africa is changing for the better, recognizing that there is still much work to be done. She is also showing people how they can help, through the Johnson & Johnson Donate a Photo app. For every photo uploaded, J&J will donate $1 to a cause, including HIV/AIDS related causes.* \nGurira spoke with Global Citizen about her own first-hand experience seeing HIV/AIDS up close, why the cause has become such a focal point of her career and philanthropy, and what she hopes to accomplish next. \nGlobal Citizen: Danai, you made your debut with “In The Continuum,” and it seems that HIV awareness has always been important to you. Why? \nDG: The thing about HIV/AIDS is it’s something very particular that connects through families and relationships, and both awareness and stigma come with it. It’s a very particular social illness in the way it affects a society, it can spread or be curbed. \nThere was something very crucial about that growing up, affecting our society and who we are and who we became. So yes, in my work, “In The Continuum ” was about telling that from the African perspective. The African woman has been the one to contract it and, more so than men, are left socially disempowered, so I wanted to give voice to that. I want them to be more than statistic. It was embedded in what I wanted to address and give voice to. \nI found the statistics unacceptable, and I was filled with rage. I wanted to give voice to that in any way I could. Then from doing that, we toured my first play across the US and southern Africa, and through that you meet a lot of on the ground activists and organizations and start to work with them and seek to garner more awareness for them and support them. \nRead More: 20 Years Old, HIV Positive, and Working to Stop the Spread of AIDS \nGlobal Citizen: What do you think people need to know about the HIV/AIDS crisis in Africa? \nThe issue of women and girls around world: women and girls are more likely to contract this illness because they are less empowered and that is true and real on the continent, where so many adolescent girls are HIV positive, and that doesn’t even go into whether they even made their own choice about sexuality, that’s a whole other issue. It’s something in the US that we need an awareness about. \nI also think people in the US should be aware that in the US, we have 1.2 million people living with HIV and one in eight of them does not know it. The act of awareness, of self-awareness, ‘have you been tested,’ ‘have I been tested,’ is so important. \nRead More: 4 Places to Double Your Donation to Help End AIDS \nGlobal Citizen: What does your work with J&J consist of? \nI’m partnering with J&J to fight HIV/AIDS on World AIDS Day, and I partnered with them for the Global Citizen concert a couple months ago, and it’s been a great experience. \nWe are working together to raise awareness of how the story of HIV and children in Africa can and is changing for the better, thanks, in part, to a sustainable community for children impacted by HIV in Kenya, called Nyumbani. Nyumbani offers a supportive living environment where children impacted by HIV/AIDS can survive and thrive, living in a supportive family environment, with education, healthcare and clean water. I am also asking readers to snap a photo of themselves to upload to Johnson & Johnson’s Donate a Photo app. For every photo uploaded, J&J will donate $1 to a cause that you care about, including Nyumbani and others. A donated photo for Nyumbani will help supply needed medicines for children living there. \nI grew up in southern Africa and the experience of watching the loss that happens when it hits the home, children are left orphans, left without a familial structure, so bringing awareness to that is so crucial. We need to make sure issues of global health are dealt with. AIDS is all about awareness, the more we know, the more we can curb this illness. \nGlobal Citizen: What can Global Citizens do to help? \nIf you want to help, you can, you can download the Donate a Photo app and from there you can donate a photo, once a day, everyday and J&J will donate $1 to one of the nonprofit partners, including Nyumbani. You can help even more people if you share your donated photos on your social media channels, to build awareness so that more people can do the same. Pretty amazing, simple way to help. You can also go to https://www.jnj.com/HIV to learn about more stories of hope and progress, and see additional ways to help. \nIt’s a massive problem. How do we stop it from going onto next generation? Well, you can donate directly by donating a photo, so can help while also seeing Global Citizenship occur, and this is very important to me, to have people learn about these organizations and communities and about his issue globally. If you’re not aware how can you care? \nRead More: Massive HIV Vaccine Study in S. Africa Could Be 'Nail in Coffin' for Virus \nGlobal Citizen: How do you divide your time between acting and writing, or do you have other projects and goals in the works? \nI’m still trying to figure that out myself. Currently I’m in preproduction for a Marvel movie, Black Panther, and I have finished this season of “The Walking Dead.” In terms of writing, I’ll be writing a Jessica Chastain-produced screenplay for a film about women in South Africa who are in an anti-poaching patrol unit, the Black Mambas. These women exist doing that work everyday. And I’m developing a pilot with HBO dealing with the African immigrant experience in the US. \nI get to do what I love. I look at young girls, my passion is around young girls and women, one of my non-profits Love Our Girls is about bringing awareness to girls and women. When I go to the continent and see girls faces that look like mine but without the opportunity I’ve had, it makes me work harder for the activism I do. There’s no reason for her not to succeed and excel and find all her greatness unhindered. That is the key thing I try to do, to tell stories that try to give voices to such young women we rarely hear from. \nThis interview has been edited & condensed. \nDownload the free app for iOS or Android to take action now. \n*Johnson & Johnson has curated a list of trusted causes, and you can donate a photo to one cause, once a day. Each cause will appear in the app until it reaches its goal, or the donation period ends. If the goal isn't reached, the cause will still get a minimum donation. ",

      "text": "By Erica Teichert\n(Reuters) - A federal jury in Dallas on Thursday ordered Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N) and its DePuy Orthopaedics unit to pay more than $1 billion to six plaintiffs who said they were injured by Pinnacle hip implants.\nThe jurors found that the metal-on-metal Pinnacle hip implants were defectively designed and that the companies failed to warn consumers about the risks.\nJ&J, which faces more than 8,000 lawsuits over the hip implants, said in a statement it would immediately appeal the verdict and was committed to defending itself and DePuy from further litigation over the Pinnacle devices.\nThe six plaintiffs awarded more than $1 billion are California residents who were implanted with the hip devices and experienced tissue death, bone erosion and other injuries they attributed to design flaws. Plaintiffs claimed the companies promoted the devices as lasting longer than devices that include ceramic or plastic materials.\nBoth companies denied any wrongdoing stemming from the development and marketing of the devices.\nAccording to plaintiff's lawyer Mark Lanier, the total verdict of $1.041 billion included $32 million in compensatory damages. The rest were punitive damages.\nVerdicts of such size are often scaled back by courts. In July, the judge presiding over this case, U.S. District Judge Edward Kinkeade, reduced a $500 million verdict in an earlier Pinnacle implant case to $151 million, citing a Texas state law that limits punitive damages awards.\nJ&J and DePuy have been hit with nearly 8,400 lawsuits over the devices, which have been consolidated in Texas federal court. Test cases have been selected for trial, and their outcomes will help gauge the value of the remaining claims.\nThe verdict on Thursday came in the third test case, with the second producing the earlier $500 million verdict. J&J and DePuy were cleared of liability in the first test case in 2014 \nLanier said Thursday's verdict was \"a message loud and clear\" that J&J has \"a really nasty part of their business they need to clean up.\" \nThe company rejected a $1.8 million settlement offer from the plaintiffs before trial, Lanier said.\nThe plaintiffs in the second test case have appealed Kinkeade’s decision to cut the award. Johnson & Johnson and DePuy have also appealed the jury verdict in the case.\nIn its statement, J&J criticized the trial judge over certain rulings it claimed help the plaintiffs. \n“Today’s verdict provides no guidance on the merits of the overall Pinnacle litigation because the court’s rulings precluded a fair presentation to the jury,” said John Beisner, J&J’s attorney.\nHe said the company will ask the appeals court to postpone any additional trials over the implant defects.\nDePuy ceased selling the metal-on-metal Pinnacle devices in 2013 after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration strengthened its artificial hip regulations. \nJ&J and DePuy also paid $2.5 billion that year to settle more than 7,000 lawsuits over its ASR metal-on-metal hip devices. The ASR devices were recalled in 2010 due to high failure rates. \nJ&J shares fell 38 cents to $111 in after-hours trading. They had closed up 8 cents during the day.\n\n(Reporting by Erica Teichert in New York; Editing by Jonathan Oatis and Tom Brown)",

Plaintiffs claimed the companies promoted the devices as lasting longer than devices that include ceramic or plastic materials. \nBoth companies denied any wrongdoing stemming from the development and marketing of the devices. \nAccording to plaintiff's lawyer Mark Lanier, the total verdict of $1.041 billion included $32 million in compensatory damages. The rest were punitive damages. \nVerdicts of such size are often scaled back by courts. In July, the judge presiding over this case, US District Judge Edward Kinkeade, reduced a $500 million verdict in an earlier Pinnacle implant case to $151 million, citing a Texas state law that limits punitive damages awards. \nJ&J and DePuy have been hit with nearly 8,400 lawsuits over the devices, which have been consolidated in Texas federal court. Test cases have been selected for trial, and their outcomes will help gauge the value of the remaining claims. \nThe verdict on Thursday came in the third test case, with the second producing the earlier $500 million verdict. J&J and DePuy were cleared of liability in the first test case in 2014 \nLanier said Thursday's verdict was \"a message loud and clear\" that J&J has \"a really nasty part of their business they need to clean up.\" \nThe company rejected a $1.8 million settlement offer from the plaintiffs before trial, Lanier said. \nThe plaintiffs in the second test case have appealed Kinkeade’s decision to cut the award. Johnson & Johnson and DePuy have also appealed the jury verdict in the case. \nIn its statement, J&J criticized the trial judge over certain rulings it claimed help the plaintiffs. \n“Today’s verdict provides no guidance on the merits of the overall Pinnacle litigation because the court’s rulings precluded a fair presentation to the jury,” said John Beisner, J&J’s attorney. \nHe said the company will ask the appeals court to postpone any additional trials over the implant defects. \nDePuy ceased selling the metal-on-metal Pinnacle devices in 2013 after the US Food and Drug Administration strengthened its artificial hip regulations. \nJ&J and DePuy also paid $2.5 billion that year to settle more than 7,000 lawsuits over its ASR metal-on-metal hip devices. The ASR devices were recalled in 2010 due to high failure rates. \nJ&J shares fell 38 cents to $111 in after-hours trading. They had closed up 8 cents during the day.  ",

      "text": "Johnson & Johnson to pay $1 billion for faulty hip implants By Stephen Feller | Dec. 2, 2016 at 1:48 AM Comments \nDALLAS, Dec. 2 (UPI) -- In one of the largest rulings of the year, Johnson and Johnson was ordered to pay more than $1 billion to patients whose artificial hips had to be removed because of dangers the company did not disclose. \nJohnson and Johnson plans to appeal the decision, but it is one of nearly 9,000 lawsuits patients have filed because of negative outcomes from the company's Pinnacle artificial hips and may set a precedent for how some of the other cases will play out. \nThe settlement, delivered by a federal jury in Dallas, includes more than $30 million for actual damages to six patients in the suit and another $1 billion in punitive damages. The company said it plans to appeal the decision, though some think that may not be the best idea. \n\"They may think they have good defenses to these claims, but they don't seem to be working with juries,\" Erik Gordon, a law professor at the University of Michigan, told BusinessWeek . \"There's no easy way out of these cases now that they have a billion-dollar verdict against them. They better start thinking of how they can settle these claims before the price goes up any more.\" \nThe lawsuits allege that the metal-on-metal implants leached chromium and cobalt materials into patients' bloodstreams, causing the devices to fail and requiring them to be removed. The suits contend the company knew about the danger, did not report it and ignored it while motoring ahead with sales of the devices. \nJohnson and Johnson won the first case filed on the hips in 2014, when a jury rejected a woman's claim that the hips gave her metal poisoning. In Dallas earlier this year, however, a jury awarded five patients $502 million -- it was later cut by a judge to $150 million. \nJohnson and Johnson, and its subsidiary DePuy, which manufactures the hips, asked the judge not to push through any of the other 8,900 lawsuits the company still faces for the devices as it appeals the current $1 billion-punishment. \n\"We have no greater responsibility than to the patients who use our products, and our goal is to create medical innovations that help people live more active and comfortable lives,\" Mindy Tinsley, a spokesperson for DePuy, said in a press release . \"DePuy acted appropriately and responsibly in the design and testing of ULTAMET Metal-on-Metal, and the product is backed by a strong track record of clinical data showing reduced pain and restored mobility for patients suffering from chronic hip pain.\"",

(2010 file photo provided by DePuy Orthopaedics via The New York Times) \nUpdated at 6:11 p.m. \nA federal jury in Dallas on Thursday ordered Johnson & Johnson and its DePuy Orthopaedics unit to pay more than $1 billion to six plaintiffs who said they were injured by Pinnacle hip implants. \nThe jurors found that the metal-on-metal Pinnacle hip implants were defectively designed and that the companies failed to warn consumers about the risks. \nJ&J, which faces more than 8,000 lawsuits over the hip implants, said in a statement it would immediately appeal the verdict and was committed to defending itself and DePuy from further litigation over the Pinnacle devices. \nThe six plaintiffs awarded more than $1 billion are California residents who were implanted with the hip devices and experienced tissue death, bone erosion and other injuries they attributed to design flaws. Plaintiffs claimed the companies promoted the devices as lasting longer than devices that include ceramic or plastic materials. \nBoth companies denied any wrongdoing stemming from the development and marketing of the devices. \nAccording to plaintiff's lawyer Mark Lanier, the total verdict of $1.041 billion included $32 million in compensatory damages. The rest were punitive damages. \nVerdicts of such size are often scaled back by courts. In July, the judge presiding over this case, U.S. District Judge Edward Kinkeade, reduced a $500 million verdict in an earlier Pinnacle implant case to $151 million, citing a Texas state law that limits punitive damages awards. \nJ&J and DePuy have been hit with nearly 8,400 lawsuits over the devices, which have been consolidated in Texas federal court. Test cases have been selected for trial, and their outcomes will help gauge the value of the remaining claims. \nThe verdict on Thursday came in the third test case, with the second producing the earlier $500 million verdict. J&J and DePuy were cleared of liability in the first test case in 2014 \nLanier said Thursday's verdict was \"a message loud and clear\" that J&J has \"a really nasty part of their business they need to clean up.\" \nThe company rejected a $1.8 million settlement offer from the plaintiffs before trial, Lanier said.",

      "text": "Johnson & Johnson Hit With $1B Hip Implant Verdict Company still faces more than 8K lawsuits By Rob Quinn , Newser Staff  44   People walk along a corridor at the headquarters of Johnson & Johnson in New Brunswick, NJ. (AP Photo/Mel Evans, File) (Newser) – Johnson & Johnson was hit with another stinging verdict Thursday when a federal jury in Texas ordered it to pay just over $1 billion to six people whose hip implants failed and had to be surgically removed. The company—which rejected a pre-trial offer to settle for $1.8 million, according to Mark Lanier, who represented the plaintiffs—still faces more than 8,000 lawsuits over the metal-on-metal Pinnacle implants and says it will appeal the verdict immediately, Reuters reports. The plaintiffs accused the company and its DePuy Orthopaedics unit of failing to warn consumers about the risks of its defectively designed implants. All but $32 million of the $1.04 billion verdict was punitive damages. This was the third \"test case\" involving the implant to go to court. J&J won the first, but a jury awarded the plaintiffs $502 million, later reduced to $150 million, in the second. \"The jury is telling J&J that they better settle these cases soon,\" Lanier tells Bloomberg . \"All they are doing by trying more of these cases is driving up their costs and driving the company’s reputation into the mud.\" University of Michigan law professor Erik Gordon agrees, saying that there's \"no easy way out of these cases now that they have a billion-dollar verdict against them.\" (In October, the company was hit with another huge verdict over its talcum powder , which plaintiffs said was linked to ovarian cancer.)",

      "text": "A federal jury in Dallas on Thursday ordered Johnson & Johnson and its DePuy Orthopaedics unit to pay more than $1 billion to six plaintiffs who said they were injured by Pinnacle hip implants.\nThe jurors found that the metal-on-metal Pinnacle hip implants were defectively designed and that the companies failed to warn consumers about the risks.\nJ&J jnj , which faces more than 8,000 lawsuits over the hip implants, said in a statement it would immediately appeal the verdict and was committed to defending itself and DePuy from further litigation over the Pinnacle devices.\nThe six plaintiffs awarded more than $1 billion are California residents who were implanted with the hip devices and experienced tissue death, bone erosion and other injuries they attributed to design flaws. Plaintiffs claimed the companies promoted the devices as lasting longer than devices that include ceramic or plastic materials.\nBoth companies denied any wrongdoing stemming from the development and marketing of the devices.\nAccording to plaintiff’s lawyer Mark Lanier, the total verdict of $1.041 billion included $32 million in compensatory damages. The rest were punitive damages.\nVerdicts of such size are often scaled back by courts. In July, the judge presiding over this case, U.S. District Judge Edward Kinkeade, reduced a $500 million verdict in an earlier Pinnacle implant case to $151 million, citing a Texas state law that limits punitive damages awards.\n \nJ&J and DePuy have been hit with nearly 8,400 lawsuits over the devices, which have been consolidated in Texas federal court. Test cases have been selected for trial, and their outcomes will help gauge the value of the remaining claims.\nThe verdict on Thursday came in the third test case, with the second producing the earlier $500 million verdict. J&J and DePuy were cleared of liability in the first test case in 2014.\nLanier said Thursday’s verdict was “a message loud and clear” that J&J has “a really nasty part of their business they need to clean up.”\nThe company rejected a $1.8 million settlement offer from the plaintiffs before trial, Lanier said.\nThe plaintiffs in the second test case have appealed Kinkeade’s decision to cut the award. Johnson & Johnson and DePuy have also appealed the jury verdict in the case.\nIn its statement, J&J criticized the trial judge over certain rulings it claimed help the plaintiffs.\n“Today’s verdict provides no guidance on the merits of the overall Pinnacle litigation because the court’s rulings precluded a fair presentation to the jury,” said John Beisner, J&J’s attorney.\nHe said the company will ask the appeals court to postpone any additional trials over the implant defects.\n \nDePuy ceased selling the metal-on-metal Pinnacle devices in 2013 after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration strengthened its artificial hip regulations.\nJ&J and DePuy also paid $2.5 billion that year to settle more than 7,000 lawsuits over its ASR metal-on-metal hip devices.

      "text": "Johnson & Johnson logo on a package of Band-Aids ( The Associated Press ) Johnson & Johnson Hit With Over $1B Verdict on Hip Implants \nPublished December 02, 2016 \nA federal jury in Dallas on Thursday ordered Johnson & Johnson and its DePuy Orthopaedics unit to pay more than $1 billion to six plaintiffs who said they were injured by Pinnacle hip implants. \nContinue Reading Below \nThe jurors found that the metal-on-metal Pinnacle hip implants were defectively designed and that the companies failed to warn consumers about the risks. \nJ&J, which faces more than 8,000 lawsuits over the hip implants, said in a statement it would immediately appeal the verdict and was committed to defending itself and DePuy from further litigation over the Pinnacle devices. \nThe six plaintiffs awarded more than $1 billion are California residents who were implanted with the hip devices and experienced tissue death, bone erosion and other injuries they attributed to design flaws. Plaintiffs claimed the companies promoted the devices as lasting longer than devices that include ceramic or plastic materials. \nBoth companies denied any wrongdoing stemming from the development and marketing of the devices. \nAccording to plaintiff's lawyer Mark Lanier, the total verdict of $1.041 billion included $32 million in compensatory damages. The rest were punitive damages. \nContinue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT \nVerdicts of such size are often scaled back by courts. In July, the judge presiding over this case, U.S. District Judge Edward Kinkeade, reduced a $500 million verdict in an earlier Pinnacle implant case to $151 million, citing a Texas state law that limits punitive damages awards. \nJ&J and DePuy have been hit with nearly 8,400 lawsuits over the devices, which have been consolidated in Texas federal court. Test cases have been selected for trial, and their outcomes will help gauge the value of the remaining claims. \nThe verdict on Thursday came in the third test case, with the second producing the earlier $500 million verdict. J&J and DePuy were cleared of liability in the first test case in 2014 \nLanier said Thursday's verdict was \"a message loud and clear\" that J&J has \"a really nasty part of their business they need to clean up.\" \nThe company rejected a $1.8 million settlement offer from the plaintiffs before trial, Lanier said. \nThe plaintiffs in the second test case have appealed Kinkeade’s decision to cut the award. Johnson & Johnson and DePuy have also appealed the jury verdict in the case. \nIn its statement, J&J criticized the trial judge over certain rulings it claimed help the plaintiffs. \n“Today’s verdict provides no guidance on the merits of the overall Pinnacle litigation because the court’s rulings precluded a fair presentation to the jury,” said John Beisner, J&J’s attorney. \nHe said the company will ask the appeals court to postpone any additional trials over the implant defects. \nDePuy ceased selling the metal-on-metal Pinnacle devices in 2013 after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration strengthened its artificial hip regulations. \nJ&J and DePuy also paid $2.5 billion that year to settle more than 7,000 lawsuits over its ASR metal-on-metal hip devices. The ASR devices were recalled in 2010 due to high failure rates. \nJ&J shares fell 38 cents to $111 in after-hours trading. They had closed up 8 cents during the day.",

      "text": "A federal jury in Dallas has ordered Johnson & Johnson and its subsidiary DePuy Orthopaedics to pay more than $1 billion to a group of plaintiffs over artificial hip replacements.\nA lawyer for the six plaintiffs said they suffered “serious medical complications caused by defective” metal-on-metal Pinnacle implants. The jurors found that the companies failed to warn patients and their doctors about risks related to the defectively designed product.\nEach of the patients had to undergo a second, or revision, surgery to replace the devices and repair tissue damage and bone erosion. At least one had received double hip implants.\nThe jury awarded more than $30 million in actual damages and more than $1 billion in punitive damages. Jurors ruled that Johnson & Johnson and DePuy were negligent in designing the implant; failed to warn physicians and patients about concerns over the product; failed to recall it; and intentionally misrepresented the product’s effectiveness to patients and their doctors.\n“Once again, a jury has listened to the testimony of both sides, and returned a verdict affirming what we’ve known all along: a responsible company would settle these cases and take care of their injured consumers, rather than forcing them through expensive and vexatious litigation just to delay justice,” said lead attorney Mark Lanier of the Lanier Law Firm in Houston. “This jury spoke loud and clear, and I hope J&J will finally listen.”\nBoth Johnson & Johnson and DePuy denied wrongdoing and said they will appeal.\n“We have no greater responsibility than to the patients who use our products, and our goal is to create medical innovations that help people live more active and comfortable lives,” said Mindy Tinsley, spokeswoman for DePuy. “DePuy acted appropriately and responsibly in the design and testing of ULTAMET Metal-on-Metal, and the product is backed by a strong track record of clinical data showing reduced pain and restored mobility for patients suffering from chronic hip pain.”\nThis is the third bellwether — or test — trial of thousands of similar lawsuits filed against the companies.\nIn March, a Dallas jury awarded more than $500 million to a group of plaintiffs who suffered similar complications from the hip implants. The judge in that case, who also presided over this week’s ruling, later reduced the amount of awarded damages to $154 million, citing Texas law. Johnson & Johnson and DePuy have appealed that ruling.\nIn the first trial, in 2014, a jury ruled in favor of the medical companies.\nA fourth bellwether trial is scheduled for September 2017.",

The jurors found that the companies failed to warn patients and their doctors about risks related to the defectively designed product.\nEach of the patients had to undergo a second, or revision, surgery to replace the devices and repair tissue damage and bone erosion. At least one had received double hip implants.\nThe jury awarded more than $30 million in actual damages and more than $1 billion in punitive damages. Jurors ruled that Johnson & Johnson and DePuy were negligent in designing the implant; failed to warn physicians and patients about concerns over the product; failed to recall it; and intentionally misrepresented the product’s effectiveness to patients and their doctors.\n“Once again, a jury has listened to the testimony of both sides, and returned a verdict affirming what we’ve known all along: a responsible company would settle these cases and take care of their injured consumers, rather than forcing them through expensive and vexatious litigation just to delay justice,” said lead attorney Mark Lanier of the Lanier Law Firm in Houston. “This jury spoke loud and clear, and I hope J&J will finally listen.”\nBoth Johnson & Johnson and DePuy denied wrongdoing and said they will appeal.\n“We have no greater responsibility than to the patients who use our products, and our goal is to create medical innovations that help people live more active and comfortable lives,” said Mindy Tinsley, spokeswoman for DePuy. “DePuy acted appropriately and responsibly in the design and testing of ULTAMET Metal-on-Metal, and the product is backed by a strong track record of clinical data showing reduced pain and restored mobility for patients suffering from chronic hip pain.”\nThis is the third bellwether — or test — trial of thousands of similar lawsuits filed against the companies.\nIn March, a Dallas jury awarded more than $500 million to a group of plaintiffs who suffered similar complications from the hip implants. The judge in that case, who also presided over this week’s ruling, later reduced the amount of awarded damages to $154 million, citing Texas law. Johnson & Johnson and DePuy have appealed that ruling.\nIn the first trial, in 2014, a jury ruled in favor of the medical companies.\nA fourth bellwether trial is scheduled for September 2017.",
